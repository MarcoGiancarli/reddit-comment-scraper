BurningMan,3e4q9p,Crocketteer,33,Tue Jul 21 23:04:10 2015 UTC,"They quoted me! Hooray.   I'm a dance music lover, I'll put that up front. Robot Heart sunrise? Yes please. Mayan Warrior parade? Of course. Random DJ setup in the middle of the city? Oh yea.   I also work the event, have helped build art, and co-run an unplaced camp with events. I see both sides.   Lineups need to stop. Halcyon made a damn good point in his video that there are tons of Burner DJs who will rock a party just as hard as big-name-douchebag 37, AND they'll actually hang around to contribute rather than flying in, playing a set, and leaving the next day.   Time slots should go away. The creep of people coming in hunting down sets needs to stop. It's inviting a negative element into the event.   I have a theory that the growth of the rockstar librarian guide is directly related to the coachellification of the event. It was only a few years ago that it was something like ten pages long. Now it's an entire booklet.   The party needs to slow their roll. The ravers should go to EDC or Coachella. I'd be on board with a serious reduction in dance music, a ban on lineups prior to the event, and ripping out placement of camps releasing time slots off playa and giving tickets to big name DJs to play two sets and leave within an hour of their final beat. Those tickets could easily go to people who want to contribute something more unique than a connection to unreleased music on a record label and well-honed computer usage."

BurningMan,3e4q9p,rezonate,3,Wed Jul 22 01:50:13 2015 UTC,"Quoting the ten principles as a defense is like using the ""free speech!"" defense of a hateful opinion.  If you feel the need to live by them, here are just a few ways in which the raver creep violate the principals:  Decommodification - Out of any group of people at Burning Man, the sound camps get in the way of this one the most. Sound camps have verifiably built a brand out of some of their experiences and gone on to sell their camp/art car/DJs in the default world. Advertising their lineups in advance serves to draw people to their camp as a business thing, not as an attendance thing. If you don't think there are some serious big money interests poaching talent from sound camps, you're absolutely blind. This could go in the way of Immediacy, too - Advertising a lineup with timeslots takes away from that by giving you a planned experience, and allowing people to build their week on seeing DJ after DJ rather than floating where their vibe takes them.  Leave No Trace - Sound camps and major sound mutant vehicles have verifably caused some of the worst messes the playa has seen. It isn't an accident that every spot Robot Heart parks just happens to be surrounded by an ocean of piss puddles, stomped cigarettes, and bicycles. Don't believe me? Go look at a Robot Heart dance floor around noon this year, even after they've done their MOOP pass. It's almost an expectation to see lines of yellow and red up and down 10/2, and it happens every single year.  Civic Responsibility - Major sound cars are literal roving weapons that can destroy the hearing of people who don't actually want to hear them. Major sound camps have their noise carry such large distances that catching peace and quiet in the deep playa is literally impossible nowadays. We have a responsibility to co-exist inside the trash fence, and sound camps/major sound cars can't seem to grasp the idea that not everyone wants to hear their music at a given moment. Ever talked to a camp who gets unwittingly placed near DISTRIKT without wanting to be there? It dissolves camps because its a terrible place to be if you aren't there for DISTRIKT. Across the street from an all-night rave camp bending the rules? Congratulations! You are forced to hear their gift all week.  Participation - I say this as a Robot Heart devotee: good luck actually riding their bus, or using their sound system. Are you a paid model who is under 25 and willing to dress skimpy? Nope, you aren't getting on. Dancing in front of a guy on a laptop or playing with 2 - 4 CDJs really tows the line between ""participating"" and ""observing."" Ask the conclave who got unwittingly blasted by the dancetronauts last year how much they loved participating near the dancetronauts.   And I say all that as a guy who loves these camps and cars."
BurningMan,3e4q9p,Rotationation,-1,Wed Jul 22 01:58:12 2015 UTC,I think it's pretty relevant to the discussion. The widespread sentiment about this seems to go completely in the face of Radical Inclusion. Do we not care about this principle anymore?  I don't always like everything I see on the playa either. I've been placed next to a camp that insisted on blasting country music at 5am nearly every day. It was annoying as hell but those people have just as much of a right to be there as I do and the same goes in this situation. A big part of what draws me to burning man is the freedom that we all have to create our own experience and the diversity we see as a result. Just because you don't like what people are doing doesn't give you the right to try to exclude them from the event and restrict the information that they communicate to the public.  I'm extremely grateful to have had access to the Rockstar Librarian Guide in recent years. Without it I might have missed some of my most cherished moments on the playa. I don't think restricting lineup information is a good idea at all.
BurningMan,3e4q9p,rezonate,2,Wed Jul 22 02:15:47 2015 UTC,"If you're calling it a discussion, you're going to have to offer considerably more than typing ""radical inclusion"" a couple of times and expecting people to go ""aha! the guy has a point!""    Single-principle-issue conversations rarely go well, as most people seem to get that there are all sorts of inherent contradictions in this set of at-best-guidelines.    Not for nothing do I compare people who scream ""RADICAL SELF RELIANCE!"" at every opportunity, like some sort of ""GOTCHA!"" at anyone who fails to have planned exactly as they have planned, to the idiots in the Westboro Baptist Church who've fixated on a line or two in a book to the exclusion of all the other content.  So yeah, as you were saying....?"
BurningMan,3e4q9p,markday,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:31:29 2015 UTC,"Is it not perfectly relevant to the topic? Radical Inclusion means we welcome all types of participation and don't exclude people based on their preference for on playa activities.  I think it would be far more useful to focus your efforts on discouraging specific behaviors and activities that we would all like to see reduced (moop, noise pollution, etc.) rather than generalize large groups of people based on their preference in music."
BurningMan,3e4q9p,rezonate,3,Wed Jul 22 02:43:01 2015 UTC,"There's a world of difference between your neighbors playing loud country music in the morning and Billboard magazine reporting on their month-early announcement about Garth Brooks and Tim McGraw headlining their camp, sunrise after the burn (excuse the dated country reference...), which is effectively what Mayan Warrior pulled this week.  There's nothing stopping Robot Heart, Mayan Warrior or any other large scale art barge sticking a chalk board outside their camp when they arrive on playa with their DJs listed, like we did in the old days. Nothing to stop you cycling over there to find out.    I'm an old fart who might go out dancing two or three times, if that, and of course I'd love to synch those few outings with the DJs I'd most like to see (but will probably only ever hear after the fact on Soundcloud) but, like a lot of other people, it seems, I'm willing to forego having all that information at my fingertips if it slows the Electric Daisy Carnival-ification of certain aspects of the burn.    And again, if you pull the single-principle ""master stroke"" and someone comes back at you with a list of ""well, what abouts....."" and the best you can come up with is, ""well, I think we should care more about the principle I cited, specifically...."" the person who seems to care the least about these principles is, well, can you see where I'm going with this?"
BurningMan,3e4q9p,markday,0,Wed Jul 22 03:15:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think the majority of people care about any of the principals, to be frank. They were written in the early 2000's as an attempt to codify the event to outsiders, they have tons of holes, and they don't even necessarily apply across the board. You know there are tons of private things on Playa that don't radically include anyone but those on a ""list,"" right? I know of a camp that goes every year that builds a sick shower. I camped near them in 2012 and I can use their shower because they love me. It's like a big tub of sexy water flowing all over your body, and the general public is sure as hell not allowed to use it. The commissary at Burning Man violates radical inclusion. Good luck getting radically included on the DPW parade or Gate party.  Rave busses and Sound camps have gotten years to try to perfect their trade. They clearly need policing at this point.  And this new rule is absolutely minor! They can still do everything EXCEPT set up 3+ hour parties anywhere they wish in the Deep Playa. All that is new is that six out of 500+ mutant vehicles must set up in a certain zone to play for longer than 3 hours at full volume!"

It has been strange the last few years, seeing the majority of my camp-mates running out to catch this dj or that dj. Knowing the set times of when everything is happening and being sure not to miss it. Just like they were at a music festival.

Hammering in the playa staples is easy and straightforward however; they go into the ground and they stay there till you yank them out by pulling directly up on them (an angled pull won't get you anywhere).    I've been using them for I'd say at least the last 7 festival trips I've been on and love them.

(I think) Someone in the other thread said their cordless impact driver was only good for half a dozen bolts on a charge - what's your experience with battery longevity for getting camp built?  I'm eyeing them as a nice-to-have for securing tents and misc bits and pieces - we're still using lots of rebar for structural reasons for the monkey hut and shade canopy.
BurningMan,3e3dxw,mudclub,2,Tue Jul 21 23:13:01 2015 UTC,"Mine was brand new with Lithium-Ion batteries, so it may have had a better charge than an older battery set.  I know my older Ni-Cd batteries tend to run out of juice faster, which is why I opted for a driver that came with a Li-Io 2pack when I bought it.  It was fully charged when I left and lasted for 35 or so bolts.  There was still a charge when I finished.  Mid week I tossed it in the charger and it was fine pulling them all up at the end of the week.     I guess that it really depends on how hard the deep playa is and the age/type of batteries being used.  If you only have a small ammount to do or don't mind swapping battery packs then cordless may work.  If you have access to a generator/inverter and a long extension cord then the corded might be better."

BurningMan,3e4yle,mudclub,2,Wed Jul 22 01:22:11 2015 UTC,"BARS ON THE PLAYA   Local law enforcement would like to see us continue to address the potential issue of underage drinking at our event.  Though we, the organization, are not offering alcohol to anyone and are not responsible for bars at Burning Man, there are possible consequences for camps with bars and us if we do not address this concern. Please read the following to make sure you are fully informed.  We do not believe that there are any rampant problems with underage drinking at our event that would merit investigation.  Unfortunately local law enforcement does not agree with us.  Therefore, you should be aware of Nevada laws on underage drinking.  Here are some useful facts:   It is a misdemeanor to serve alcoholic beverages to anyone under 21 years old in Nevada.  The law still applies if the alcohol is gifted as opposed to sold. Theme camps are considered public space and subject to enforcement of this law. (NRS 202.055)  In 2001 the Nevada State Supreme Court limited the application of NRS 202.055 to only servers who had actual or constructive knowledge that the person seeking the alcohol was under 21. This means that you must card someone who looks underage. Conversely, if someone looks of age you are not required to card him or her. It is a misdemeanor for a minor to consume or possess an alcoholic beverage in a public space (e.g., theme camps, open playa, center camp, etc). (NRS 202.020) It is a misdemeanor for a minor to pass him or herself off as being of age. (NRS 202.040) Misdemeanors carry the following penalties: Up to 6 months in county jail, and/or a fine up to $1,000.  Alternatively, community service may be sentenced in lieu of, or in conjunction with jail time and fines.  (NRS 176.087) If a minor loiters in a place where alcoholic beverages are consumed (besides a food establishment) then the minor could receive a fine up to $500.  (NRS 202.030) Also, if the person in charge of the ""tavern"" allows the minor to loiter then he or she could be fined up to $500 also.  (NRS 202.060)   Historically, enforcement of the laws is either done by carding the person outright, or through undercover sting operations. None of this is new and not terribly different from most other state laws.  But what can you do to #1 Avoid illegally serving minors?, #2 Avoid being cited, or #3 If cited, demonstrate the due diligence against serving minors you used when operating a bar on the playa?   Don't serve anyone without ID, who appears underage. Ask for ID for anyone who appears underage. Learn to read it properly and determine by the date of birth if the person is old enough to drink. Post ""No Minors Allowed - No Minors Served"" signs to discourage minors from committing a misdemeanor by loitering, requesting, or consuming alcohol at your bar. Do not allow minors to loiter at your bar: ask them to leave. Confer with a co-server -- get a second opinion -- when a patron appears ""youthfully"" over 21. Work together - if you have refused to serve a patron because they do not appear to be of legal age, notify all your bar servers of your decision. There may be undercover operatives working with local law enforcement that attempt to be served more than once.   (NOTE: Federal and local law enforcement priorities differ on one or more of these issue. If you find yourself in an unfortunate encounter please get a badge number and/or name and note what agency you are dealing with. It might come in handy.)  Bottom line: NEVER, NEVER knowingly serve alcohol to a minor! It's illegal and it's not cool."

A few things to note-   They do not have to give the PDF out just because they made the PDF. The license takes place on distribution, so if they don't distribute there's no license. You have no rights until you actually possess the PDF. Which brings the main point of the license- anyone who receives a copy of it can redistribute it on their own. They may have had to pay a fee to get it from ""the source"", but now they can distribute it on their own. They are also allowed to modify it, assuming it's the same license. However, they can't do it for commercial purposes, which is defined by the contract as ""primarily intended for commercial advantage or monetary compensation"". This makes this indiegogo campaign a pretty clear cut violation of the license. Whether something is a violation or not only matters in so far as anyone is willing to enforce it.

BurningMan,3e1adr,ZuchinniOne,6,Tue Jul 21 04:43:11 2015 UTC,"I like this change... and I'm a fan of rave busses. Like, a real big fan. I work hard, and I like to play hard, and my poison of choice is almost always a rave bus.  That being said, to be clear, this policy means that rave busses can only play for 3+ hours in the designated zone. If the rave bus wants to drive around and explore with a parade of folks - I believe it can go anywhere, as long as the sound is turned to an appropriate level. It can still be loud, it just can't be arena loud. They can even park somewhere and transform an art piece into the backdrop for a party, within reason. Want to throw a massive hours-long sunset to sunrise party? Bring it to the zone.  Got a smaller car with a smaller system? Play it anywhere! There's a massive difference between Robot Heart levels of sound, and something like the Disco Fish level of sound, and the smaller guys are free to do what they used to do.  What's lost here is playing hide-and-go-find-a-deep-playa-party. That's a sad loss, and there's no way around it. There is absolutely nothing like hunting for a deep deep deep playa party. Finding Robot Heart deep near the trash fence at 11:45 and Total-Bumfuck is an experience unmatched.   But, things do need to change. These massive cars cause massive MOOP problems, and to be frank, the stereotype that shitty burners attend the big art car parties in deep playa is absolutely true. Crawl the Robot Heart or Mayan Warrior post-sunrise-packing up dance floor and tell me that isn't disgusting. The piss ocean surrounding those busses is absolutely abhorrent and disgusting. And these cars just randomly set up deep in the desert... Playa Resto can only do so much. What happens if they happen to miss a spot where Burners danced cigarettes and other MOOP into the dust and the BLM happens to choose that spot for inspection? Bye-Bye Burning Man.  Dedicated porto-potties. A dedicated area to sweep for MOOP. A dedicated place to find all of those absurdly massive parties that have been happening. The only loss will be the deep playa serendipity. Good trades, all around. There truly aren't very many level 3 sound systems, so I have a feeling this zone won't overlap too much.

TO me, temple is a sacred place, I've only felt compelled to write something on it once but when I did it was for me to write, to let go of something, to watch it burn and to move on. If I saw my writing there forever etched in permanency of youtube I would feel let down by the burner who decided that my writing was for everyone. I get that it means something different to everyone, to me it's just like taking a photo of a girl or guy in their most private without their permission and posting it online with a message ""look how beautiful the human genitalia can be"" and saying it was done out of love or respect."

And just in case it wasn't clear, I made the video to because I joined this year's Temple team and am working on imminently-needed fundraising, to make sure the there is a Temple at all this year for people to leave their memories on.

That said, most videos are honoring what happens there and help another temple get built for soooooo many others. Two years ago I watched people at the temple from just inside its perimeter wall. One man walk in the walled area, went over to a small place for objects and pulled out a big poster with photos, writings, art etc. He unrolled it out of his pack as if it had been on a plane or some other cosy transportation. He took a moment to look at it, wept a bit, and then rolled it back up and put it inside the location, squeezing it under the bench. To me.....that was telling: he needed to leave it there, have that moment.....but it was only for him. With all the cameras, film crews and whatnot in the tempele, maybe we should all consider why we are making things visible to others .....or not visible at all."

We've used this for coming up on 5 burns.  1 burn was minus any type of shade which was rough.  The following ones we had the truck under a carport.  We have both a 10x20 and a 12x30.  With the 10x20 we will only cover the portion of the truck with our tent.  That will leave us a little extra room for a table and a chair and room to ""get ready"".  With the 12x30 we are able to shade the entire truck and still have personal space. We have several carports for our camp and the latest one that we bought last year from Costco was pretty fantastic.  The older models have pins that attach the legs and the elbow joints.  But the new one has push buttons that snap together.  This made assembly an absolute breeze.  If you have one or two helpers, you'll have it up in no time. We've also have ShelterLogic carports but those are more $$.  When going with the carport option - find one with 2"" diameter legs... anything less than that is flimsy for the wind.  In addition to anchoring in the ground with rebar we also use ratchet straps and anchor it to our truck wheels."

It is best to just leave your car sealed the entire week, and not to even start it during the week if possible. The old costco car ports are the best ones because they have thicker poles, they are fantastic to put a tent in but they look super plain unless you decorate them.

Our camp uses scaffolding lashed to other scaffolding with an overlap about 1/3 or more of the way up to the height we want to go for stability. We use scaffolding clamps to secure them together. Then we have another smaller, more bendy pole lashed to the top of that in order to be able to sway with the wind. We get ours probably 30-45 feet in the air this way. That's kind of specific and possibly not reasonable for a small camp, I know, sorry.  I think an HF or Amazon flagpole is unlikely to do the trick for a week, though. But the combination of solid on-ground structure attached to higher structure attached to something that can bend in the wind is the way to go."

Bring enough calories for survival and then be on the look out for food oriented events to round out your diet (Shameless plug: Cafe Surprise at 4:45 and B, check us out). Bring some water- but remember you can buy ice at the event, which rapidly becomes water (remember to have a container to melt it in). You can also buy coffee. As far as other necessities- if you are a drinker, remember that hard liquor is much lighter to carry per unit of drunkenness than beer. You can rewear clothes. Focus on shade and dust protection in packing.  Have a good burn.   Another way to go is look for a container leaving from you area and put some stuff in it- usually a small fee."

BurningMan,3dyztf,fuegopantalones,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:37:00 2015 UTC,"I've taken the Burner Express the past 2 years and will do so again this year. Coming from NY, I ship the majority of my things on a freight container (I know Philly also has one, too). The past 2 years I camped with a camp that provided water so that was covered. This year, I'm free-camping. So the majority of my items are coming in the container, flying with a carry-on, and my campmates driving in are bringing my water for me. If they weren't, I was going to buy my water during the ride. Burner Express has a shopping trip option where we stop at a supermarket along the way for an hour or two and pick up last minute items. Lots of burners buy their water at this stop. How they bring it to their camp from the bus stop at 6:00 and G is a whole other problem (oh right! I forgot about the shuttle. Still...bring a little red wagon).  Side note: Don't depend on that supermarket to have everything. The Reno supermarket we went to was wiped out of AA batteries before we got there, their El-Wire was $18 for a 3 ft length, and they didn't have enough booze.

There are options out there to augment things (ice from artica), you really don't want to over rely on those. Especially if it means relying on camps for food and drinks (as lots of camps will underestimate how much people like free food and run out before they plan).  Focus on survival first and then add extras if you have more room.  Check out the exact limits on what you can bring on the burner express and work under those constraints. The rideshare option might end up more restrictive as far as gear goes."

I have two of these 1.8w pumps powering it (not using the little solar panels).   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L8GM8YG?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s01  For the fan I'm using this 1.06 AMP one:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y1HLA8?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00
BurningMan,3dze5d,mudclub,2,Mon Jul 20 19:59:17 2015 UTC,"Why not use the solar panels that come with the pumps?  We're using a similar (larger, single) solar pump, but adding a connection & switch to a battery in case of panel failure.  re: the fan - still looking into that, BUT:  The amazon title for the fan says 1.06A, but the picture of the fan says 1.60A.  Big difference."
BurningMan,3dze5d,mudclub,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:26 2015 UTC,"I found the fan on an old newegg listing and it's showing 1.05 amp so I'm guessing that 1.06 would be correct. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835213003  Well I have 2 pumps running with a small solar panel each and then would need a larger one regardless to run the fan so my hope was to consolidate all of it into a single panel to make things easier for me.   I hadn't thought about panel failure, is that pretty common?"
BurningMan,3dze5d,mudclub,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"Dude.  Zoom in on the photo on the front of the fan.  Look at the current rating on the sticker that is attached to the fan.  See how it differs from the title?  Do with that information as you see fit.   I hadn't thought about panel failure, is that pretty common?   In isolation, no, but they're delicate, and that setup is cheap.  You'll be transporting it with other stuff, you'll be setting it up in a harsh environment, it will constantly get coated in dust, diminishing its efficacy, etc.  Just be prepared for the possibility of failure is all.  Also pay attention to the fact that the pumps run on 9V and the fan runs on 12V from (probably) a solar panel that puts out up to 20V.  Running 20V through a 9V device is a pretty good way to bring about its early demise.  On the plus side, if it comes down do it, you can run the pumps off 9V batteries (or a pack of 6 AA batteries in series), which is pretty cool and an easy fall-back."
BurningMan,3dze5d,mudclub,2,Mon Jul 20 20:44:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I know so little about electronics I didn't realize they print that info right on the unit.   After reading this thread I'm going to put a battery in between the panel and the cooler to avoid having to deal with varying voltage."
BurningMan,3dze5d,mudclub,2,Mon Jul 20 21:15:53 2015 UTC,"The battery plan is good.  Make sure you get an appropriate charging circuit for the type of battery in question, and make sure you step down the battery voltage for the pumps - the battery puts out way higher voltage than they're rated for.  If all else fails, a turkey baster (or a good shake of your swamp cooler bucket) will serve to keep your pads wet.  As for the batteries themselves, we use 12V 85Ah deep cycle batteries we picked up for about $80 a few years ago at costco.    A quick back of the envelope calculation shows that your gear will draw about 24W at full load - 1.8W x 2 + 19W + a little overhead.  With the caveat that I probably have no idea what I'm talking about, that's 2Amps per hour.  A 12V 85Ah battery should run that setup continuously for ~40 hours.  Bear that in mind during you planning.  If you can find a way to charge it for added power, great!  If not keep an eye out for snow koan solar at nectar village (probably around 8:30 & J-ish) - they have a ~2KW solar array and provide charging services to anyone who needs it."

BurningMan,3dze5d,mudclub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:27:10 2015 UTC,"using http://rapidtables.com/calc/electric/watt-volt-amp-calculator.htm it looks like that fan draws 19.2W, so you'll need at minimum a 20W solar panel (30 is probably way better) and a way to get the voltage up to 12V if it doesn't already put that much out.    I know shit all about the practical use of solar power, but that should get you started - and amazon returns a bunch of hits for 30W 12V solar panels."
BurningMan,3dze5d,mudclub,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:08:44 2015 UTC,"A simply little DC fan like that will starting turning at well below 12v. I can't imagine it puts out much air, but it'll work with varying voltage."
BurningMan,3dze5d,mudclub,0,Mon Jul 20 20:10:59 2015 UTC,"True, but how is that relevant?  Swamp cooler functionality is predicated on the volume of air they can push.  Assuming this is for a standard (H12) hexayurt, that fan is marginally underpowered even at max capacity - OP is probably going to need to squeeze everything he can out of it, not limp along anemically."
BurningMan,3dze5d,mudclub,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:21 2015 UTC,Are we speaking to my fan in general or my fan running off of solar?

BurningMan,3dze5d,mudclub,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:24:22 2015 UTC,"It will vary depending on the light the panel is receiving. It will go from barely turning at all, to blowing more than its rating at noon. You will need to test this specific fan, but blowing at, say 20V it will heat up and may fail.  You can even hook up an inverter to your panel, which will give consistent voltage, however they aren't meant for the large variance in voltage a panel will provide either. So you will also shorten the life of an inverter and cause it to heat up."

BurningMan,3duerb,easyEggplant,5,Sun Jul 19 16:03:16 2015 UTC,"The best way to do it to use the generator to charge your battery in parallel with feeding the motor. That way the battery can handle surges from acceleration. You will not find a converter big enough to go from 12v to 36v. You need to run the thing on 3x 12v batteries. You need isolated ground 14.4v dc power supplies to run the batteries. Judging by your questions, I strongly suggest testing the whole thing a lot before you bring it out. Take it on grassy offload to test for vibration and intermittent load conditions."
BurningMan,3duerb,MOSF3T,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:35:20 2015 UTC,"So charge the batteries at 12v in parallel from the generator?  This was actually my initial plan, but then it turned out that the whole set they had on the cart was feeding the motor 18v and I got confused."
BurningMan,3duerb,MOSF3T,2,Sun Jul 19 18:39:24 2015 UTC,"Look at the motor, the controller, see what they're rated for. If you do run everything at 1/2 voltage it will last longer.

BurningMan,3duerb,darklorddne,5,Sun Jul 19 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"I hate poopooing on ideas but your plan is way off from working.  Hopefully we can get you moving in a direction that wont leave you broke down on playa or seriously injured from high current electrical faults.  1st and foremost, the 12V output on a 2000i is 8A.  Even if you could find a step-up regulator capable of 36V/55A, the required input at 12V would be a whopping 165A (assuming 100% efficiency), 20x more than that outlet can provide.  Second, assuming you are able to convert the output of your genny to 36V DC, under full load and with no thermal loss (not going to happen), your motor is searching for almost exactly 2000 watts of power.  Now, Honda went ahead and proudly stamped ""2000"" on the side of that little red beauty but it is misleading.  That generator is rated for 2000 ""surge"" watts, and only 1600 ""running"" watts.  Running that golf cart directly from the generator will very quickly kill your generator.  Unfortunately, the normal way to run a golf cart is also the most economical.  You are going to have to purchase (6) 6v deep cycle batteries or (3) 12v deep cycle batteries, run in series.  The $20 motor controller will at the very least need to be completely sealed from the environment.  And very well cooled.  Playa and electronics do not mix, at all.  So now you need to build a finned, metal enclosure for that.  Why not just get a second hand, purpose made golf cart motor controller?    The bottom line:  Useable MVs are not cheap.  Cheap MVs are good camp furniture (assuming you can push it that far).    Also, HIGH CURRENT LOW VOLTAGE DC CAN STILL KILL YOU.  DO NOT FUCK WITH IT IF YOU ARE ""NEW"" TO ELECTRONICS."

BurningMan,3duerb,pacificmint,2,Sun Jul 19 18:42:44 2015 UTC,"IF: You are starting with a cart that only needs batteries to be fully functional, just plunk a set of deep cycle batteries in and splurge for a 36V/25A rapid charger, which will draw a fairly constant load on your generator (which you can strap to the back), thus optimizing both range and fuel efficiency.  ELSE: Gut it, buy a few used bikes to pillage the drive-trains from and make it human powered.  If you can make it self-powered, make damn sure all 36V connections are clean, tight, and smeared in dielectric grease."

Everywhere the mold is/was, has been eaten by the mold, and therefore has been structurally weakened. These will be the first places where the yurt will fail (and may already have holes in it, depending on how aggressive the mold spores were).  When you erect the yurt, go inside at night, and have someone with a flashlight shine it on the mold spots from the outside. (Press the flashlight on the spots, and move it around.) From inside the yurt you will be able to see exactly where the fabric has been weakened, because more light will come through there. Take a sharpie and outline all the weakened areas.  Later on - depending on the extent of the damage - you can sew patches over these sharpie-outlined sections, iron on fusible interfacing or some other ""iron-it-on-and-it-melts-to-the-surface-to-strengthen-the-surface"" stuff, or - if it's bad - plan to replace the fabric.

But last small camp I was at (2011) still used a regular evap pond.  It wasn't much hassle, certainly not a shitshow.  I guess we never needed a better solution.  Before that I camped solo a lot and just poured greywater into containers to take with me, didn't bother with evap.  I had seen some generator-powered mister things added to regular evap ponds to help them evap, but never seen an elaborate windmill based contraption on playa for evap."

Just by happenstance, our camp generates effectively zero grey water, but we're always prepared to implement that strategy, and we tested it two years ago on a neighbour's fuckup and it worked like a champ.  It's not designed for large volumes of water, but it works really well for small camps."

The main site is discouraging them now in favor of evapo-trons and other strategies.  Kiddie pools can be flipped by the wind, as can the black cement mixing pans/tubs (our choice).  we had to hide our black evap pan some years because it would mysteriously fill up overnight.  We still use it, but we do not rely solely on evaporation.  Basically we now pour our greywater into big kitty litter jugs and haul it out.    Shower: garden mister and wipes, stand on a towel on a tarp, ten hang the damp towel to dry.  Hair washing is trickier, but we manage with wearing a trash bag like a hair dresser's cape, funneling the water into a catchpan.  Haul it home in jugs."

However, as AMAZING as a shower feels on the playa, you are IMMEDIATELY dusty and dirty again within moments of the water shutting off.  I've taken a shower each year I've gone, and as awesome as it felt...  they were pretty useless.  I wouldn't bring my own gear to shower, but since my camp has one I have used it.

You can bring a camping shower (lots of grey water) or a garden mister (less grey water and can help with the grey water).  I tend to just do the baby wipes. Not great. But, everyone's noses are so clogged with dust that no one can smell you. The dust and humidity keeps you dry anyways. So the bacteria that makes you smell doesn't really get a chance to grow. Baby wipes just take care of the parts I want to feel comfy and clean.  As far as the grey water solution goes, the evaptron is a good solution. Evap pools seem like they never work. You could also use the garden mister to spray the water in the air after treating the water. This is what's suggested by the BOrg."

BurningMan,3dslt1,hickory-smoked,2,Sun Jul 19 15:35:19 2015 UTC,"I recommend against showers because they're a huge pain in the ass out there, but I tested a concept last year.  Running water showers are not worth it.  They will generate way too much grey water.  Way too much.  What I found worked okay given that my prime concern is ""do not generate grey water that we will have to deal with late in the week"" is one of these sorts of sprayers, washcloths, and a bottle of camp suds while standing in a cement mixing tub.  In my case, as I hadn't planned for washcloths, I cut a t-shirt into strips to make a bunch of washcloths.  The process:    set the sprayer to 'mist'.  Give yourself a light wetting.  You don't want water running off you - just make yourself moist.   wet a washcloth.  Apply a little soap (that stuff is super concentrated - use very little) and suds it up.  Scrub the pits and the bits in particular - just the very sweaty areas that are fabulous hosts to bacteria.  You do not want to apply the soap directly to yourself by hand as you will get WAY too much on yourself and it will be a huge pain to rinse it all off. Use the sprayer sparingly to rinse.   don't bother trying to shampoo - it's a total waste, and rinsing will leave you with a ton of grey water.  Find a shampoo camp to do that for you.  They're super great.   Over the course of the week last year, this process was done three times.  Total water consumption per use was ~1/3 gallon, and very little greywater resulted; most of it evaporated shortly after application to myself.  What little was left over evaporated in the mixing tub within an hour or two."

This should give me about three per day, but I'm thinking I might get more for a mid-day scrub since sunscreen seems to work better for me on cleaner skin. Use a bottle of water to wet the cloth and scrub down. And a giant zip lock bag to pop the used ones into so they can go right into the washing machine when you get back, but don't stink up the car on the way home. This year, since I'll have a fairly large geodome, I'm thinking of hanging them to dry over the day so I don't have a bag of damp cloths getting more gross."

Devices like this battery powered shower are great as well, just drop the feeder end into a bucket or large water container. I prefer these to solar showers as you do not need to hang them from anything.  Remember to conserve water turn it off when not initially getting wet or rinsing.   If in a larger camp you will need a bigger evap pond or you can rent a grey water tank to be delivered and picked up after the burn from United Rentals.

A week of that for me,plus shaving, plus approx. a liter of french press coffee a day added up to about 3gal of greywater that year.  Second year I was out there for two weeks. ended up with a rather larger amount of greywater about 6-7gal as I had to scrub down more often. (Was helping build camp, and a hotter year in general)  I am not very good at grey water minimisation, but a very good start is to control the amount you use.

BurningMan,3dslt1,cablemonkey604,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:31:23 2015 UTC,"I have been going for 10 years and have MASTERED the burning man shower.  Stake out a piece of black plastic or tarp with a footprint that is slightly larger then your shower cabana. Place a cement mixing tub from home depot inside the cabana. Then take a shower standing in the cement mixing tub. Most of the water will collect in the tub with spray hitting the tarp. When you are done with your shower use a wet dry vac to suck up the water in the mixing tub. You can either bring a few 5 gallon buckets and take the grey water with you OR buy a pumping voucher and have a pumping service pump the water from the 5 gallon buckets.   If you don't own a shower bag I would suggest the Nemo HELIO.  It is fully pressurized and you don't need to hang it.  ALSO, if you don't own a wet dry vac, home depot sells one for $21 that attaches to a 5 gallon bucket.  Keep in mind you would need to draw power for the vac.   Don't event try and build a evap pond.  They never work and people will just use it as a place to dump water they don't know what to do with.

Ross's objections come down to: risk, money, and copyright. Risk can be taken care of, very simply. Money is an arduous task but given the community and some effort, it will come. It does take some amount of faith and maybe chutzpah, but that is also the nature of the project. Then there is copyright. I can but point out that he put a stake in the ground that apparently he could not move. That is indeed on him. I respect his choice, but I believe the nature of BRC and how the Temple works means it would not be right to give him what he wanted.  We seem to like to think of the borg as the enemy. I don't agree with that. Somewhere between BRC and the default world, there are people trying to mediate, and it ain't an easy thing. Letting default world fears win is not the way I choose to play the game."
BurningMan,3doos9,i_am_pajamas,3,Sat Jul 18 17:27:10 2015 UTC,"Ross spent numerous paragraph describing how risk isn't taken care of ""very simply"". You stating this the way you do implies you either A: know more than the rest of us, in which case, go ahead and explain how it's ""very simple"", or B: don't know what you are talking about.   Read with some compassion instead of judgement and you might learn something. Burning Man is not perfect. the agents who do things out there are human. things are not always fair - AND THAT IS OK - the event is far too complicated to be some kind of exercise in egalitarianism and I wouldn't expect it to be (Did you see the 20 item list the org has to deal with? followed by the whine fest from opulent temple? that's a crazy line to have to walk, isn't it???).   But the challenges for some projects out there are very, very real, and your dismissal of them as challenges is pretty lame."
BurningMan,3doos9,noiszen,2,Sat Jul 18 21:59:03 2015 UTC,Thsnk you. Risk is not easy. Tag me next time so i can rebutt.
BurningMan,3doos9,FormerlyKraft,0,Sun Jul 19 20:58:31 2015 UTC,"As a volunteer for several years on large projects including temples, I feel I have some insight.

BurningMan,3doos9,i_am_pajamas,2,Sun Jul 19 05:06:47 2015 UTC,"I disagree about LLC liability being bulletproof - which is why we have insurance for these projects.

BurningMan,3doos9,dancerjess,2,Sun Jul 19 05:15:33 2015 UTC,"Ross had a team of people advising him who were well qualified in what they do. And so what if he is more risk adverse? He has substisntisl assets from a well respected carrier.  All of that could have been tsken away if a wind storm came and knocked over the temple and killed people. No one on playa, save the org, has that limit of liability. Unless you wanted to convice people to fundraise an extra 35k, or 15% of THIS years temple, which they are having a problem doing too, to cover the higher liability policy that should be in place for such a installation.   /u/formerlykraft has actually been on the side of being 100% responsible for the liability of a project. That is what the contract demands. It rightfully scares people who have assets built up, becuase shit can go wrong at burning man very easily.   The default world is the world we live in. Even when we are st burning man, we are still in the default world as much as people like to dismiss that fact."

Your help. Please, please read the article, share it, and give if you're able.    I don't know what the Temple means to you guys, but I know what it means to me. I hope this isn't too personal, but I lost my only sibling to a violent death that I witnessed when I was 15 and he was 13. That was a long time ago, and of course I cried when I was younger, but when I first went to Burning Man in 2010 (have been back every year since) it had been many years since I had let myself have a good cry and remember my brother.   Walking through the Temple that year, I went into one of the little cubby holes in the 'canyon' walls that made up that year's Temple, and wrote a little message to him. Then I completely broke down in tears. It was wonderful.  The Temple is the only ""church"" that has ever meant anything to me. Please help get it finished. It's on everyone to whom the Temple has ever meant anything to get this done."

BurningMan,3doos9,mudclub,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:24:12 2015 UTC,"I'm just curious about the design.  How thick is it planned to be?  How is it segmented and attached?  Would you remove before the burn?  It just seems kind of odd, a huge metal plate fronting a burn piece."
BurningMan,3doos9,pugworthy,2,Mon Jul 20 16:46:08 2015 UTC,"Very thin. I don't know how it's going to be segmented and attached though - not my area of expertise. We wouldn't remove it before the burn though, and it'd survive. We'd recover the copper and turn it into art to give to major donors.  We actually have three large metal trees that will sit in the courtyard of the Temple that will survive the Burn too."
BurningMan,3doos9,mudclub,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that just doesn't jive to my mind.  The collapse during the burn would be kind of clunky and awkward, and it being so large and on the front sort of blocks some fire visibility (contrasting that to metal supports on the interior of past structures).  Doesn't sound like an aesthetic reward sufficient for the price.  I'd go for some kind of metal-flecked paint on wood, or leaf if it sticks.  If a big honking metal plate is a must, have you considered electroplating?  It's pretty cheap and easy if you're working with regular shapes."

BurningMan,3doos9,mudclub,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:06:02 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that, while the BMorg puts up less of the cost than many people would like to see, of a projected attendance of 70K, ~800 people donated to the online fundraiser. The ""we"" of the community that actively work to make this happen is a very small percentage (800 donors + 200 builders + a number of private donors) .  While it would be great in some ways for a big ticket donor to step up and make this happen, relatively small amounts from a lot of people would also make a heck of a difference.  Again from conversations this week, ""the couple of hundred volunteers can only work on this because several more hundred people chipped in, and they are every bit a part of the crew for doing so.""

Things are great over here. People vomit less, for example. The pony population is manageable. There's less dust (just ask /u/mudclub).  If you're 3 & E on the corner, that's pretty fucking huge (much more central than being between 7:35 and 7:45 on D). No idea if they tell people those coordinates and give them a camp slightly to the side, but I'd doubt it. As far as I know, the corner means the corner, but I'm only speaking from having been given the corner with a major intersection as the address. If your camp is remotely large / interactive, I suspect you got it. And frankly, 3&E is nothing to sneeze at."

Now i'm not some asshole who rants against RV's. You wanna go in an RV, all good. But we're not exactly sad about being moved so much as we can't really nail down where we are and which way we're facing. I suspect our long side is going to face E which is going to be insane.

One corner of 3/E is a porta bank, so you wouldn't be there.  A thought--Did you put the correct subject line in your email to Placement? They always ask that the subject line has the name and sector number of your placement team so they can respond better. They are busy but will prob get back to you soon."
BurningMan,3dp5pa,ZacharyRD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind if you're emailing the placement team, it's a different placer in charge of that side; for example, Bravo and Level are our placers, in the area around 5:00 (doesn't help you) so you need to be very clear in your emails who you're trying to reach."

I avoid looking at schedules, the Rockstar Librarian, and the WWW specifically to let serendipity happen.  The only things I keep scheduled every year, are:  Friday Night/Saturday Morning at a certain sound bus (although I'm probably breaking that this year because the scene at that bus has gotten ugly in the past two years)  Leave for Man Burn early to walk the circle  Gate Shifts  Other than that... I just ""follow my bliss,"" I guess. Four years ago that meant being stuck wondering what to do while I biked naked aimlessly. Three years ago that meant avoiding every single sound camp in search of Deep Playa art. Two years ago it was avoiding going back to a failing theme camp and finding various places around the Playa to hang out at. Last year it meant sitting in my new awesome camp all day, yelling on a megaphone and finding new friends. This year...? Who knows. I just want to be dusty again."

There's a lot of vanity, a lot of trash on the ground, a lot of people higher than they should be (some guy drank all of the pee out of my pee jug...), and a massive cop presence at every single place it parks. Still a beautiful sound system (even if the bus itself looks a bit boring) and they have great music, but there's better places to go in my book. There's at least ten or so other big rave busses with big sound systems playing the same kind of music. I've spent a couple of years hanging out there for sunrise, time for something new!"

Also, park your bike in a very easy-to-find place, like lining it up directly with the front or back of the bus and counting paces, because that specific party gets a few thousand people + bikes parked around it.

We said fuck it, and took off, leaving them behind. Almost ran to the burn.  30 minutes later, as we are standing in the crowd, our whole camp rolls up on us.

He was absolutely there with us as the Temple burned on Sunday.   I also left a lot of personal ""baggage"" in the Temple. It was one of the greatest and most cathartic experiences of my life (which, thanks to the catharsis, led to my relationship with my now-husband a few months later). My most memorable moment was bawling my eyes out on a bench and having a stranger just sit down beside me and hold me as I cried. Then he bagan crying and I held him. When both were cried out, we wiped our eyes, hugged and went our separate ways. It was powerful to find that kind of fleeting love.   May you find that same ephemeral love. And keep your ""eyes"" open. You'll probably find hints from Ira that she's there with you.  I wish you light, joy, and an AMAZING burn! <3"

May I advise just to keep expectations low, say ""yes"" to whatever is being offered whenever possible, know that there will likely be moments that aren't so wonderful (i.e. too tired, some jerk, sad memory etc). Feel the full range of emotions, both good and bad. BRC is wonderfully accepting. Explore the art. Hang out in camp bars. Dance your ass off under the stars.   As a gay lad you might want to check out Comfort and Joy, I myself spend time with the queer women at Camp Beaverton.

BurningMan,3dp2hf,palikir,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:57:40 2015 UTC,"Lots of people do it.  You will want to have a sheet of plywood for the top and bottom. Unfortunately, 6x8 is not a sheet size.  I would use a 4x8 plywood sheet top and bottom, wrap a tarp around the whole thing, and tie it down really well onto a roof rack. On the sides, where the plywood won't reach, use a corner protector.  They aren't heavy, you just have to make sure it doesn't take flight or get destroyed by the strapping/wind."
BurningMan,3dp2hf,superhorsforth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:05:53 2015 UTC,"Yes. we've done this a few times. We didn't use the sheets of plywood at the top and bottom, but instead wrapped all of the yurt panels in the groundsheet we had, taped together like if you're wrapping a present. We also didn't have a roof rack, but used 4 of those truck straps that you can tighten. Each of the straps were passed inside the car to secure the yurt panels to the roof.   The first year we did this I tried emergency braking at 30 mph to make sure that it didn't move. It did not, and there was no movement on either the going or return trip. My only caution would be that in our case the first time, the panels were longer than the car, and you need to make sure that they won't decrease your vision at the front of the car...."

Only if you're really careful about your knots and how you tie it down under tension in both the front and back.  Note that if you don't make a plywood sandwich with the panels in between, you're likely to damage the panels.  If you don't know knots, look this up carefully on the internet first, or spring for ratcheting straps."

It was so good, she nearly finished a handle by herself in one day and almost got alcohol poisoning.  She kept saying she had heat exhaustion and we had to show her the bottle to prove how much rum she drank.  Fortunately she's a pro and had taken my desert survival pills.  After a lot of water and a supervised nap she was back to burning!  Anyway, the point I wanted to make was that Total Wine has a lot of booze that I've never seen before, and the staff posts tasting notes for almost all of it.

Searched the vehicle (insert standard 'never consent to a search' rhetoric here). Confiscated many bottles of fine scotch because they were purchased in Illinois and hadn't paid Michigan liquor tax.

In order to understand the severity of the need for fundraising can you add/include a list of budget items that this 10k would be going towards? As an honorarium project you've received some ORG $'s, will this cover the basic structure? I see at the end you include that this money is to repay personal debts incurred while working on the project + buy some welding machines.

BurningMan,3dnbyf,breefield,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:04:31 2015 UTC,"Good points on all parts.  On top of that, they're asking for 10 grand a couple of weeks (edit: alright, a month and a half, but that's still not a lot of time) before the event. They're calling it the last days of their fundraising even though they're only 3 days into their month long fundraiser.  The fact that they're this far in the hole just before the event doesn't inspire a ton of confidence. Maybe the lion share is dedicated to recouping already incurred expenses. But, that also makes me wary because it makes me feel like their planning isn't super great if they waited this long to fundraise.  Their project looks great.

Had a 2 year old chev crate 350 in it with less than 20,000 km. $2500. Removed the wall to wall gold shag carpet, repaired a minor roof leak and installed a new batteries and a bunch of wiring. So maybe another $2000. Took it heavily loaded in and out of Blackrock 5 times now and in 25,000 km the first issue I had was the fuel pump going. All rvs require maintaining. I chose an older unit as the price was good but also very simple. No computers, easy to fix. Also as a bonus and a problem, it's very heavy duty compared to newer  units, so very tough but not great on gas. We budget $0.5 /km but can carry 6 people and all their gear and then some. I was over 15,000 lbs going into the desert 2 years ago. That was too much. We don't have or want ac or an on board generator. We don't use shower at Burning man. Small solar array, evap pond. Simple swamp cooler. You also have to consider storage costs. I happen to have it on my property now so I can work on it easily."

BurningMan,3djf6h,mang0lassi,5,Thu Jul 16 19:25:35 2015 UTC,"I think they prefer ongoing stuff throughout the week to single events. I've seen a number of theme camps lose their placement because they just had one or two ""party"" days.  My theme camp (Costco!) is pretty much day-only, but we're also heavily interactive and serve a good chunk of the playa. Takes a lot of out of us as a commitment - we have to work at least 4 shifts a week - but the people who camp with CSTO are really committed to what we do."
BurningMan,3djf6h,ebbomega,2,Thu Jul 16 21:22:03 2015 UTC,"Do you know if it matters if you put all your events into the database or not?  Our plan is to have on going everyday or every-other day events but don't know if it's necessary to put them all into the events listing. Also, my camp asked for a very small space and somehow placement gave us a much larger space. I'm sure we'll find uses for it but the whole reason for the small space was to be compact in what we're doing and not over extend ourselves."
BurningMan,3djf6h,wolfraidernyc,3,Thu Jul 16 22:09:05 2015 UTC,You'll be okay. Just remember to keep it clean before you leave. Over-placed camps frequently get land encroachment from random campers. Make sure they know to follow LNT as well as you do or you're going to look bad on the MOOP map.
BurningMan,3djf6h,ebbomega,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:11:44 2015 UTC,That's exactly my concern: rando campers not respecting LNT and leaving MOOP in my camp. I don't care if I get blamed for it by the Borg so much as I care about being sure to LNT. And some of our camp will be leaving Sunday...  I'm also going to check with my neighbors when I land and let them know that I have extra space in case they too want to spread out slightly. ;-)
BurningMan,3djf6h,wolfraidernyc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:00:03 2015 UTC,Thing is your MOOP map score affects your placement in the future.
BurningMan,3djf6h,ebbomega,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:04:42 2015 UTC,Exactly. But that's a secondary concern compared to being a responsible burner.
BurningMan,3djf6h,wolfraidernyc,2,Fri Jul 17 20:38:12 2015 UTC,"Truth enough. There are plenty of reasons not to MOOP, the first and foremost are all centered around not being an asshole."
BurningMan,3djf6h,ebbomega,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:29:17 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to us in terms of space. I wish we had just been given what we requested, but I'm guessing it just worked out this way based on our block's structure."
BurningMan,3djf6h,theAlmightyGrant,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:30:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I recommend some kind of ongoing involvement with the community throughout the week. That has worked well for the camps I have helped with in the past.  For the last few years, our camp has run mostly day events, mostly early in the week (Friday or earlier) in addition to staying open with an activity (like ""Send a Postcard to Your Future Self""), and we have had incredible success with placement every year."
BurningMan,3djf6h,brcfire,3,Fri Jul 17 02:17:15 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I'd contact placement ASAP and let them know your plans. Telling them you plan daily activities then changing it to every other day or just a couple days is a surefire way to lose it for future years. Really, they will take it away and note your camp and camp leaders.  TL;DR: Be sure what you tell placement matches what you do on playa."
BurningMan,3djf6h,brcfire,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:00:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I'm looking for advice precisely for this reason; I'd rather not change the schedule in ways that placement would have an issue with. However, I'm sure there's some flexibility as long as we communicate."

Honestly I've had my head up my a** coding in python all day so I'm not thinking very clearly."
BurningMan,3djnea,theseekerofbacon,2,Thu Jul 16 21:09:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, stuff you need in your car before you leave.  Stuff you want to protect, but isn't quite as valuable, just leave it in your tent and make sure to close it up before you go. Almost every theft out there is because someone saw something shiny out in the open and deciding to ""gift"" it to themselves.  There's lots of tents out there. The chance of people hitting up yours is pretty low."
BurningMan,3djnea,brcfire,2,Fri Jul 17 03:06:25 2015 UTC,It's the best solution. Lockboxes only make it obvious that you have something valuable. Theft doesn't happen that often at burning man. But it would make you an easier target.
BurningMan,3djnea,Pink7172,5,Thu Jul 16 20:55:10 2015 UTC,"Security through obscurity applies to Burning Man just as much as other places. Making a big deal about valuables, like locking a safe/box to a public structure, is a bad idea. Theft at BM is minimal and mostly a crime of opportunity. That is, you leave something valuable exposed with no one around then yes someone might take it.  I come from the computer security world and one of the best ticks I've learned is to hide things in plain sight. For example, this inside a cooler. Or this inside your porta potty bag. The harder people need to look the less likely it will be taken. Or bury it in a bag next to your tent when no one is looking.  Again, this really isn't a big problem but a few simple tricks provide peace of mind."

BurningMan,3djnea,ShaggySkier,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:26:57 2015 UTC,Close your tent up at all times. Lock your bike up at all times. (already mentioned) wallet locked in car. Its rather simple. People won't go entering your tent. They will grab a loose bike though.

BurningMan,3djnea,cantremeberstuff,2,Thu Jul 16 22:18:57 2015 UTC,"You may want to keep your ID, ticket, and possibly a credit card on you. If you are involved in an accident and airlifted to Reno (or wherever the hospital is) having ID, a credit card, and your ticket stub will simplify things immensely. Your ID is useful if you get carded by a bar. The ticket stub may be useful if you plan on cavorting near the trash fence.   It sounds like you've got a techy bent, so you may want to backup the contents of your phone to someplace as well. An SD card with your ID, and on some sort of cloud storage would make replacing it simpler. Though as others have said, locking it out of sight in your car is the best option."
BurningMan,3djnea,cantremeberstuff,2,Thu Jul 16 21:55:57 2015 UTC,"I recommend carrying around photocopies of ID, medical insurance info, extra medical info for emergency helicopter ride to Reno, etc."
BurningMan,3djnea,UMFreek,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:00:19 2015 UTC,I like this idea of using photocopies. I don't have to risk losing my actual license but I still have a form (albeit unofficial) of identification.

BurningMan,3djnea,CSnarf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"ok so here are my two cents:  petty theft happens. I would say 99% of it is pilfering of alcohol and/or the theft of someone's bicycle.   Some advice:  put anything you don't want stolen in you car. Lock it. Leave it. As for your identification. MAKE multiple color PHOTOCOPIES of the front and back. If you get in a bind those will work, at the very least if you get carded out on the playa for a drink, that will be accepted. Leave you real ID at camp.   If you want to bring your phone around to take pictures or whatnot, I recommend setting your LOCK SCREEN BACKGROUND to an image that has your name, your burning man address, your burning man camp name(so they can leave it with a campmate) and your address back home in default. You will be surprised with how willing people are to return shit if they know where to bring/send it!   Other than that, bring a bike lock and lock your bike when you are on playa. I think other than that you should be fine.   Anything else you are worried about, stick in your car. If you are around your camp don't expect some thief to be sneaking around stealing shit. Don't leave obviously valuable things out and about when you leave camp..."

BurningMan,3dj9ym,LittleRadagast,7,Thu Jul 16 18:47:55 2015 UTC,"Theft does happen, esp toward the end of the week and moreso these past few years. I wouldn't store anything unlocked that you're deeply attached to.  Def lock your bike, at least thru the wheel or to your buddy's bike, and run the lock thru a loop of your bag. That should be enough.  A cable lock is better than a U-lock on playa.  Bigger problem is people leaving beer cans in your bike basket! I put a locking lid on my bike basket to hold a 6-pack but also to keep MOOP out!"
BurningMan,3dj9ym,prowlerSB,2,Thu Jul 16 19:12:47 2015 UTC,I don't mind people using my basket as a moop-bin personally. I'd rather it there than somewhere on the ground. At least I trust myself to LNT even if some douchebag hippie can't figure it out.

(when i confronted him he said, that my custom decorated bike was his.) )  Burning Man may have once been all safe and hippie like, but I can tell you that the last two years the culture has been just about as bad as major European cities."

I think that time is long past ever since ticket scarcity became a real issue. It used to be a bunch of frat boys could roll up friday night, buy tickets at the gate and fuck up the playa all weekend. Those aren't going to return any time soon.

BurningMan,3dj9ym,ebbomega,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:35:49 2015 UTC,Really? Because I've seen far more frat boys and douchebags than I've ever seen at BRC last year when tickets sold out in no time flat.
BurningMan,3dj9ym,Terrasquirma,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:12:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but that hasn't been my experience. Although, last year tickets were still plentiful right before gate. Our camp had many that were given away or sold for almost nothing.  We are still adjusting to this post-2011 sellout world. This year is a different story, and I'm sure next will be even harder to get tickets. But it is all a numbers game, if more and more bros get in the sale, then its a crap shoot."
BurningMan,3dj9ym,bolshi_bashi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:36:44 2015 UTC,"Whatever. The Bros are the reason it's been selling out faster. The more people get wind of Burning Man the more looky-loos will show up and the more we'll get douches just looking to get laid. Happened to the rave scene, happened to the punk scene, happened to the hippies, it'll happen to whatever cool and artistic happens next. I learned over a decade ago just to accept it."
BurningMan,3dj9ym,Tim_Theory,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:41:25 2015 UTC,"I learned over a decade ago just to accept it.   Doesn't seem like it. Since when did Burning Man not have douches looking to get laid?  You know what made all of those scenes go lame? The veteran insiders who sat back on their laurels and expected to reign supreme because they were entitled to it. There is still good shit in all of those scenes, they simply aren't defined by the ""good old days"" anymore. Douches have always existed, at Burning Man as well. As soon as you start calling others poseurs, its time to look in the mirror.  Every scene is lame, because it is a ""scene"". It all depends on your perspective."
BurningMan,3dj9ym,mudclub,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:04:35 2015 UTC,"It's not a matter of entitlement. The thing is it's a natural entropy that occurs. As anything gets bigger, it becomes more and more difficult to maintain that the new generation still gets the ""point"" of that culture. Does that mean none of the new generation gets it? Of course not. But it does mean the culture gets diluted on a big scale. And more and more you see it in quantifiable measures. More MOOP every year. More darkwads. More plug-n-plays. As it grows, the lowest common denominator gets lower. This is just cultural entropy and it happens EVERYWHERE.  Did douches and frat Bros exist at BRC before? Of course they did. Just like barstars were existent in the rave scene in the early 90s. The fix isn't trying to stop it from happening because you won't. What happens more often than not is that the people who come looking for the core values of the community and find it diluted is they move on to the next thing, whatever that may be. Heck, a bunch of the pre-camel burners have sworn off black rock city and just go shoot the shit out of Frogbat at Juplaya. A lot are even saying that's even gone the wayside now. Point is there's a real impermanence of cultures. Heck, I thought that was what the whole idea of lighting your art on fire was about exactly that. Learn, adapt, create, let go, destroy, repeat."
BurningMan,3dj9ym,ebbomega,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:36:56 2015 UTC,"More MOOP every year.   Actually, the cleanup crew said that 2014 may have been one of the cleanest years on record."
BurningMan,3dj9ym,Centralredditfan,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:57 2015 UTC,What do you lock your bike to most often? I usually mosey around with some friends and we all lock our bikes together. They aren't locked to anything in particular - just off the side of the road and all locked together. Usually 2-4 bikes depending on the situation  Edit - Thanks guys. Great advice!
BurningMan,3dj9ym,mudclub,3,Thu Jul 16 19:14:54 2015 UTC,I imagine just locking the wheel to the frame such that it couldn't be ridden away would be sufficient to deter most opportunistic thieves.
BurningMan,3dj9ym,ebbomega,3,Thu Jul 16 19:28:58 2015 UTC,Just lock the wheel to the frame.  People aren't looking to steal fancy bikes; they're looking for something they can ride because they're lazy.

BurningMan,3dj9ym,ebbomega,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:24:44 2015 UTC,"That's fine. It just has to be ""un-rideable"", because if at least one wheel is turning, people will take it. (And then cut the lock at their camp.)"

BurningMan,3dj9ym,FCB_TB,6,Thu Jul 16 18:51:47 2015 UTC,"2009 - some idiot came rolling into our camp with a ""borrowed"" bike (no, that green mountain bike with the EL wire all over it isn't a community bike)  2010 - my wife had her playa coat stolen from her bike  2011 - one campmate had his bike stolen from our camp, one friend camped elsewhere had two bikes stolen throughout the week.  2014 - one campmate had shit stolen out of her tent.  Pretty naive to think that in a city of 60k people, most of whom leave shit unattended for a large amount of time, that there wouldn't be douchebags looking to capitalise on said naivete.  Especially when it comes to bikes, you'll often get inconsiderate assholes who just think it's fair game to grab someone's bike and take it like a yellow bike. That's an added bonus because they just leave it behind wherever they're done with it and it now becomes MOOP.  Take the risk if you want. I've seen far too many people who have been in real shit because of stuff getting jacked."
BurningMan,3dj9ym,mudclub,3,Thu Jul 16 19:05:56 2015 UTC,I definitely didn't say it didn't happen.  I said it's a minimal problem.  Your experience is way outside the norm out there.
BurningMan,3dj9ym,keepitrail,2,Thu Jul 16 20:12:08 2015 UTC,"I'm just fairly connected with a lot of people in a lot of camps, and my camp is frequently fairly central to all the mayhem. There are, in fact, high risk areas. Parked outside of major clubs or attractions is a HUGE one. The higher the traffic, the more the crime of opportunity occurs.  I agree that, per capita, the amount of thieving that happens at Black Rock City pales in comparison to cities with actual slums and people that are really down on their luck. But that doesn't mean it's a minor problem. It happens a lot more frequently than most burners would care to admit. As a result, it's smart to ensure that you have some level of security to your shit. It doesn't need to be much. As I've said, all it really takes is enough to make it inconvenient for a potential thief to nab your shit. Bikes, for instance, you can just lock the wheel to the frame, and random party fuckwads who just want a ride home won't bother with it.  But it happens, and it happens a lot."

But shit like this pushes us closer and closer to Burning Man: Music Festival.  I'd like to see the BMORG make good on their promise to not welcome camps that do this, but... I'm also kind of an asshole.  edit: They want to make sure their dance floor is full? Come on, dudes. You guys have one of the loudest systems on one of the more mutated vehicles out there. Every night, people follow you around on bicycles and other cars, and it's always packed. You also seem to be able to skirt the rules and play full volume in the central Playa. And you're complaining about maybe not filling your dance floor, so you release the damn thing over a month in advance?  On the bright side, I'm really excited to see some of these names returning, and I'd love to find them serendipitously... but this is still kinda fucked."
BurningMan,3dg1nt,Rotationation,14,Thu Jul 16 00:37:18 2015 UTC,THE PLOT THICKENS
BurningMan,3dg1nt,ApesInSpace,12,Thu Jul 16 00:31:27 2015 UTC,"Their choice of venue to post their lineup says a lot, in my opinion.  If they wanted to ensure their dance floor isn't empty (sorry, but that's a pretty bullshit excuse having seen the crowds they draw) they should be spreading word of mouth among the BM community not on a music industry site.  This will only attract more electronic music fans who are not familiar with the BM culture and principle of LNT.  Drawing in ""fans"" to the event who are there purely for the music rather than Burners who already want to be there for all that BM offers is how you end up with red swaths on the MOOP map where some sound camp dance floors are."
BurningMan,3dg1nt,Crocketteer,3,Thu Jul 16 06:03:18 2015 UTC,"They were at EDC LV this year, they definitely want to capitalize on their new fans."
BurningMan,3dg1nt,Treebeezy,3,Fri Jul 17 16:36:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I'm hoping Further Future starts to really take off.  While there will always be electronic music and big sound camps/cars at Burning Man, at least having an alternate venue may relieve some of the demand - particularly for those who only go for the music and don't care to put in the effort on a theme camp, can't be bothered to contribute anything meaningful to the community (dancing at a sound camp in booty shorts doesn't count, sorry), or adhere to basic LNT.  As for the ""name"" DJs playing at any camp, I expect that most, if not all, of them are doing it for the love of music and the thrill of playing for people who appreciate their craft.  If that's the case, then blatant promotion of their presence there ahead of time isn't really necessary.  People who will already be there that want to hear them play will seek them out and the camps themselves can promote all they want during the event to ensure their dance floor isn't empty.  But if any DJs are getting paid or flown in on a private jet to play at Burning Man, well... fuck them and the camp that hired them.  I would love to see the big sound camps start to shift their external promotional focus to Further Future or some other new desert festival for that particular crowd.  The audience I'm referring to is more concerned with what the newest big party is anyway, rather than the actual culture of Burning Man.  And yes, of course you can be all about the music AND still contribute and immerse yourself fully in the culture and principles - I'm certainly not talking to you.  Want your Transformational Festival(TM) experience to revolve around music by amazing DJs on incredibly lit and decorated stages?  Want to spend your preparation time fawning over lineups instead of poring over survival guides and packing lists?  Want lower RV rental rates, plug-n-play camping/glamping, with a shorter drive (relative to the closest major airport), trash facilities on hand, and food and beverage for purchase?  Want to avoid a surly set up crew (winking at you DPW, you wonderful bastards) and crunchy naked hippies (who doesn't love a smiling, friendly hippy?) trying to hug you?  Then Further Future is a better festival for you.  TLDR;  While I appreciate what the big sound camps/cars are doing and the effort they themselves put in, I'm not too fond of the music-first, culture-second crowd they're attracting with their big name DJs."

BurningMan,3dg1nt,MrDERPMcDERP,8,Thu Jul 16 14:30:20 2015 UTC,Her (Marian Goodall's) comment in full :  You all should not be posting your Burning Man lineup in advance. Burning Man isn't a venue. It's a community. You are risking your status as a permitted art car. Theme camps risk the same by commodifying Burning Man. There are no extra tickets for Burning Man. Promoting music at the event beyond those that are able to attend creates a false impossible desire to attend due to the music and lineup. Please discontinue. We are currently creating and about to post the policy.

BurningMan,3dg1nt,radchad,5,Thu Jul 16 20:51:43 2015 UTC,"Ok, devils advocate here... Im all about ""preserving the essence of Burning Man"" and all. But that lineup is delicious. All ARTISTS that have great reputations and tasteful music. Trust me people, you don't need to worry about all the EDM teeny boppers suddenly clamoring to go just because they saw Maceo Plex on Mayan Warriors lineup.  Not like they could find a ticket right now even if they did.  That post honestly kicked me into BM gear and now Im dreaming about being back on the playa, dancing with all of you in front of that beautiful beautiful ART car, listening to ARTISTS gifting us their ART.  Still art people..... ok... rant over."
BurningMan,3dg1nt,MrDERPMcDERP,6,Thu Jul 16 05:47:21 2015 UTC,"Ehhh... whether or not Maceo Plex =/= Steve Aoki, it felt like a surprisingly rookie mistake from... a well-funded blend of high-calibre ego and generosity, with a fairly laughable explanation offered as to for why (and possibly since deleted).     It literally looked like someone went, ""see that graphic that got White Ocean into a bit of a sticky situation last year?  You remember the one?  Yeah, get me one of those, and get it online ASAP, before Robot Heart blows us out of the water with whoever they've booked this time.... I'm not fucking private-jetting Maceo Plex in for anything less than 'most anticipated set on playa' type crowds, it would look bad....""  Which I inevitably find kind of amusing...."
BurningMan,3dg1nt,So_much_power,2,Thu Jul 16 06:02:45 2015 UTC,"Further on this, after a little thought....   The BMorg does a (depending on your opinion) delicate/hamfisted job of balancing the contribution that Big Disco makes with the reality that Big Disco exists in more visible (and arguably corporate) ways off playa than most other stuff.  Mayan Warrior may not be bringing the DJs that will result in a deluge of PLUR tweens on playa, but the Mayan Warrior was at EDC Vegas this year, hosting an Insomniac Events new DJ take-over night, amongst other things.    And, of course, why shouldn't they be?   It's not like you can't see a bunch of Burning Man stuff at Coachella, for example (El Pulpo, say...).   It would be ridiculous to expect that stuff to only show up on playa.  And honestly, whether they and other bigger-name sound camps announce their line-ups a month out or word-of-mouth at the event, the ""best DJs in the world on the best sound systems in the most amazing environment"" cat is out of the bag regardless, and the event will be written about in those terms plenty much this year, as last year. And that may, or may not, continue to skew the event in some people's eyes.  With all that said, there's some sort of ""social contract"" in place regarding not treating BM as ""the latest -- and greatest -- stop on <Big Name DJs> latest tour"" (which is kind of the vibe White Ocean gives off to me, regardless of how generously Marian from BMorg may consider them in print).    It's surprising (or not?) to see Mayan Warrior wrong-foot this one...."
BurningMan,3dg1nt,Jazicle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:28:41 2015 UTC,Its actually not surprising to me.  BUT after 5 (?) or so years Pablo and crew should know better.  There is lots of new blood involved now that they broke off into their own camp.  Rookies it seems.
BurningMan,3dg1nt,doctor-yes,-12,Thu Jul 16 20:27:24 2015 UTC,The crew from MW are my really good friends. They're generosity on so many levels humbles me. I was a little shocked that they released their line up so early but who gives a fuck really? I'm blessed that they're giving not just an incredible gift of music but what I feel is one of the most beautiful art cars out there and the sound they put is better then anything anywhere you've ever heard. If it were Robot Heart releasing this early I might not be so understanding. Those guys are cocks!
BurningMan,3dg1nt,zerosetback,5,Thu Jul 16 02:56:33 2015 UTC,"I hope the BMorg punishes MW for doing this. I'm sure they are great people, but the rules must apply to everyone. I love the rave in the desert as much as everyone but it's important to maintain that BM is very far from a rave in the desert.  I've had my boss ask ""Oh BM? Who plays at that festival?"". ""Well you see it's not...blah blah"" After that he said he went and read about BM, but after a couple of weeks I said I went to a regional burn and again he asked about music. I could tell he could still not break the association between ""festival"" and ""big music stages"" in his head."
BurningMan,3dg1nt,Jazicle,5,Thu Jul 16 04:29:39 2015 UTC,"Well wait a second. I don't approve of what they're doing, but there are no rules against releasing a DJ lineup. There's a difference between community disapproval and asking the BMORG to take formal action to suppress the release of information by a camp. I think we can express disapproval without asking them to be censored by the org."
BurningMan,3dg1nt,zerosetback,2,Thu Jul 16 04:33:15 2015 UTC,"And isn't the issue more about releasing set dates/times? Any camp can say in advance what they're bringing to the playa, why can't a sound camp as long as they're not posting their full schedule?"
BurningMan,3dg1nt,Crocketteer,8,Thu Jul 16 04:45:17 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what the set time is, if you announce that Deadmau5 will be playing at your camp then the OMG ticket sales will be skewed."

Also, when all of the cells come together these forces are distributed through multiple cells through the circle and dampened further.

I wanted to build a monkey in keeping with our camp's theme, but ended up making my cat Luna Imgur The first version (the one in the pic) was made out of paper mache Imgur and lasted a few years until being eaten by rats while in storage. Imgur  The next version was made out of fiberglass and covered in fur and I could really tell what people were on by how they interacted with it. Drunk people ""woo hoo, pussy, I like pussy too! Woo hoo"" Molly ""can I pet (like really really pet) the kitty""? Weed "" red eyed nod of approval from a distance with a ""nice, I like cats/ have a cat,  too"" LSD, ""Woah, trippy eyes"" as they would get a closer look at the red lenses then look at me with black basketballs of wonderment. and by far the worst was the occasional old guy, drunk AND rolling that wanted to face fuck my art. Imgur that one burned up in a trailer fire on the way home, at a place called ""permaburn"" no less. Imgur The natural progression was to make it out of metal, but the best I can do for now is this...Imgur . This will be my 12th year of ""Meow""ing on the playa, and I hope this information was somehow useful or at least entertaining for you and fuck yer burn. :)"

BurningMan,3dg0pk,MemphisVK,15,Wed Jul 15 23:53:18 2015 UTC,I'm trying to find the best way to keep in touch with friends when we split up and wanna meet back up.   Don't worry about it; go have your own adventure.  Most affordable radios are worthless out there.
BurningMan,3dg0pk,mudclub,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:59:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Have heard mixed experiences with standard store-bought walkies. A campmate has access to Army Corps of Engineers walkies and they've worked pretty great, even up to a mile out there.  Probably expensive though and even then, we hardly used them."
BurningMan,3dg0pk,Crocketteer,10,Thu Jul 16 05:11:59 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to find the best way to keep in touch with friends when we split up and wanna meet back up.   Tell them you'll meeting them in a second over by that big blinky thing that is definitely not moving*.   They don't work very well. My recommendations (formed from many failed attempts at staying with the same people):   Be okay with splitting up. This is probably the best advice. Don't sweat it if you lose a group member (or if you're the group member who gets lost). Run around, find an adventure. Random serendipitous reunions are among the greater gifts you can be given out there - but don't count on em, and don't let forced-spontaneity ruin your night. You'll find everybody eventually, it just might be tomorrow. Wear distinctive LED stuffs on your person. This does not mean a blinky red light. It means a 3ft top hat made of pure light and a glowing dildo on top. Whatever you think is distinctive in your apartment - on playa, it's one more blip of light pollution. I've lost well-lit friends who were within a 15ft radius of me. If you're serious about sticking together, get serious about unique, distinctive personal lighting. This takes work. Temporary meet-ups that change throughout the night. E.g. ""if we get split up, meet at midnight at [insert easy-to-find landmark that doesn't move**]."" Give a window where you'll stay at that place (10 minutes, 30 minutes, whatever). Otherwise, cya tomorrow. Don't go out in stupidly large groups. Any group larger than four people is a nightmare. Herding cats. You'll spend too much time and energy corralling your friends, juggling preferences, waiting around. This is also why I dislike leaving camp in large groups (one person is almost ready, they swear, they just need to do eighteen things). Be okay with splitting up.   *Hint: it's moving.  **Hint: it moves."

BurningMan,3dg0pk,gibson_,2,Thu Jul 16 16:19:38 2015 UTC,Typical GMRS/FRS frequencies are useless out there because crowded.   Look into MURS channels and/or hurry and get your HAM tech license.
BurningMan,3dg0pk,brcfire,2,Wed Jul 15 23:57:25 2015 UTC,"This is a great little radio, we have one always tuned to MURS channel 5 (154.600 MHz), which is the BRC emergency frequency. This is kept by the first aid and a fire extinguisher. No need for a ham license if it is for an emergency.  Technically, this radio violates gov regulations on transmission power for MURS frequencies, as it can transmit at 4w - while the allowed power level for MURS is 2w.  Still, for the price, its great peace of mind. Its a fun little handset, just remember its technically a crime to hit the transmit button (in ham frequencies - FRS is ok.)"

They are not ""Type Accepted"" for FRS or any other free service.  If you use them, you risk a fine from the FCC.  If you use them out in the middle of a desert and don't interfere with anyone, the chance of that could be minimal.  That's your own choice.  Best bet is to get you amateur radio license, though I am a bit biased.  Baring any interference, you should have Playa-wide communication between two baofengs.  If not, there is an amateur radio repeater on a hill overlooking the playa.  Check out http://cq-blackrock.org/ for information on that.

BurningMan,3dg0pk,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:38:45 2015 UTC,"Rangers, ESD, and the other volunteers you see walking around with radios are supported via a very sophisticated network of repeaters and antenna masts. The individual radio units themselves cost over $1000 each and the network costs a whole lot more.  The kind of radios you would likely want to acquire yourself are considerably less powerful. I'm under the impression that the better ones you can buy have ~0.5 mile radius of transmit capability. If you think you'll all be within that range of one another, they could be useful. If you're hoping to make contact with your friends on the 10 side while you're at the 3'o'clock portal, you'll be out of luck.  There's also the concern about frequency crowding; you're not the first with this idea, so it's likely that FRS or other frequencies you'll have access to will have a lot of ""chatter"" from other folks too.  The best way I've found to keep in touch with friends is a whiteboard in camp."

In 2013 it was contagious wolf howls that stopped it from being totally silent.

Unless the dimensions they were given noted that they didn't have a regualar shape which is a possibility.  Also I heartily recommend getting yourself into the Theme Camp Organisers Group on Facebook. It's well worth it.

We've also used non-ratcheting webbing straps to link ratchets for long runs.  They're heavy once you get a couple thousand feet worth tho, lol.  You can also run Type IV paracord for something heaver than 550lb.   Final suggestion is mule (pulling) tape: tensile strength is closer to ratchet straps, and it's cheap per foot.

BurningMan,3d9vrp,total_tiger,4,Tue Jul 14 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"You can use accessory cord. It is climbing rope, doesn't stretch much, and is relatively affordable. Much, much better and stronger than paracord. It is what I use for guy lines, never had a single issue with it. It is brand new as well, and will last forever. This kind of cord isn't technically rated for climbing, which is why its called ""accessory"" cord, but it is super strong. 6mm is around 1700lb breaking weight, and 7mm is around 2900lb. The playa will not break this cord if used properly.  Here is a link to the stuff I've bought.  12"" lag bolts screw right into the playa with a drill, they work great."

BurningMan,3d82k4,lovelydreamer,2,Tue Jul 14 06:16:27 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you're not attaching the bungee balls correctly.  Wrap them around the ribs a couple of times to get a real good stretch.  If they aren't super tight, lengthen one of your spine pieces.  It's gotta be tight.  What's real important though is the tarp you're using.  If it's a 10mil heavy duty tarp, it will get destroyed in the wind.  You gotta use a seriously beefy tarp.  Footprint:  use string with loops on the end.  one for the entire length of one side.  one for the width.  and one for the diagonal of the corners.  *for a 15-foot monkey hut, need a 15-foot string, a 12-foot string, and a 18-foot string (the diagonal)  pound in your first stake.  then pound in the long length side.  then use your width and diagonal strings together to pund in the third corner.  then do the last corner.  On your length string, mark with sharpie where the middle ribs should be pounded in.]  when you're done with the string, get a piece of cardboard, wrap the string up on it, and write the length on the cardboard.  then store that shit in a bungee ball container."
BurningMan,3d82k4,faggot100,0,Tue Jul 14 18:19:05 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time finding a heavy duty tarp. Where did you get yours? I had a 10x20 silver/black ""heavy duty"" tarp from Amazon.

BurningMan,3d82k4,JaronK,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:43:20 2015 UTC,"About the gap: what's most important is that it's really tight.  if you can lessen the gap and still make it just as tight, that's even better.  I used to have like 3-4 inch gaps, but a huge wind hit the playa and destroyed my heavy canvas tarp.  got the tarp at mytarp.com.  I would use the chat program there and ask them which tarp has the best tear strength.  They'll get pricey for the good ones.    This is what i would probably buy unless i chose to get some sort of mesh tarp.  http://www.mytarp.com/10-x-20-white-polyester-canvas-tarps.aspx  only prob with these monkey huts is the tarp itself heats up.

BurningMan,3d82k4,ApesInSpace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:12:58 2015 UTC,"1:  Orient it so the wind blows through the hut and it will be far less likely to fall apart or blow away.  If you put Aluminet on the opening of the wind entrance side, it'll be quite comfy.  The wind usually blows up 5:30 towards the man, so use that information to orient.  2:  I've seen them held down simply by securing the top fabric properly, usually with rebar or construction stakes straight into the ground.  3:  If your bungees are loose, just double them up around themselves.  They should be able to tighten up as much as you need."
BurningMan,3d82k4,Crocketteer,2,Tue Jul 14 06:43:24 2015 UTC,"Orient it so the wind blows through the hut and it will be far less likely to fall apart or blow away   I actually do the exact opposite - set up the hut perpendicular to the prevailing winds. My first year I set mine up parallel (for max air flow) and had a gust of wind turn the hut into a giant sail, snap a rib in half. Would be interested to hear other monkey hut folks weigh in on this."
BurningMan,3d82k4,ApesInSpace,2,Tue Jul 14 16:05:16 2015 UTC,I agree with this.  I set mine up perpendicular to the wind with the ribs reinforced on the prevailing wind side.  Keeping the ends open and adding a hand pump misting system should help to keep it cool without the wind blowing everything inside around.
BurningMan,3d82k4,Crocketteer,2,Tue Jul 14 19:13:34 2015 UTC,"Yep - serious reinforcement of the side that gets hit with wind (or if you aren't perfectly perpendicular, reinforce the opening-end with a ratchet strap attached to the spine)."

It's now just another stop on the circuit. There's almost a competition between the sound camps and sound cars... Who had the most attendance, who had the highest ranked DJ... Fewer sound camps and sound cars might bring things back to the way they were. Not that EDM is bad or doesn't have its place, but it's the big draw now. Bringing DJ fans that just party in the desert for a week. No concern for the Ten, it's just a Coachella or EDC to them. They pat themselves on the back because they brought some shit to giveaway and didn't leave that much trash..."
BurningMan,3d6abl,mudclub,7,Tue Jul 14 06:40:21 2015 UTC,"Color me very surprised that a camp like that didn't get placed this year; as much as I rail against placement in general, camps of their scale of infrastructure are exactly the types that I think should be granted placement and early access.

BurningMan,3d6abl,DatoDave,14,Mon Jul 13 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"They weren't bringing the (awesome) OT setup this year. They were already going to take a year off to recoup financially from last year, so OT as we know it didn't apply for placement. As they said in the article they were still going to do OT events at other camps, and what didn't get placed is the camp where they were all going to camp."
BurningMan,3d6abl,Jovankat,7,Mon Jul 13 21:46:41 2015 UTC,They probably should have applied as an art support camp then.
BurningMan,3d6abl,DatoDave,2,Mon Jul 13 23:08:54 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they weren't expecting a rejection based on camp history. I'm also guessing they would not have been happy had they been placed at 7 and H based on level of interactivity.
BurningMan,3d6abl,Jovankat,2,Mon Jul 13 23:31:31 2015 UTC,Well that was a mistake on their part. You've gotta be realistic about what you're asking for and whether what you're offering the community means you actually deserve it.

BurningMan,3d6abl,Ruleryak,3,Mon Jul 13 21:42:02 2015 UTC,"I keep forgetting how well it went overall last year so I thought this was a joke, but nope - definitely green.  On a related note, my camp was denied placement this year too (our first time applying).  At first it was a generic denial, but I reached out and the gods of good timing smiled on me because I just heard back from AnswerGirl about 15 minutes ago.  We're having two public events during the week, and her response was:   While these both sound great, for a group of 30 people in a camp, we hope that you will offer something a few more times than that.  Next year if you could tell us the days you are offering things and the times of your events that really helps us out.   So it seems that the size of your camp is a huge factor in how interactive they'd like your group to be for consideration.  This definitely makes more sense to me with that piece of info so over the next year we'll come up with more and better events, schedule dates and times, etc within our group and try again.  If the group doesn't want to commit to two or three times more activities throughout the week, we'll know not to try for placement again.  We've been placing ourselves for years and our peak was 93 people on playa in 2011 so it's definitely possible to get in after gate open, get a space, and get all your people together with our without placement.  It's a nice extra (been in placed camps 3 years too), but it's just an extra"

So, maybe it's nice that they push the people who are doing art support or gate or other very important things back a bit, and let the crackheads who show up within 30 minutes of the gate opening a shot at the corner of 4:30 and D."
BurningMan,3d6abl,Jovankat,2,Mon Jul 13 23:32:09 2015 UTC,I thought art support camps were in the purple zone? I also thought that all the purple zone was reserved so even after the gates open there is only going to be space if a camp doesn't need all the land they were allocated?
BurningMan,3d6abl,Retsejme,2,Mon Jul 13 23:43:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that all the purple zone is reserved. Having been to BM a few times, I've noticed that something almost always goes sideways. I'm pretty sure most placement people have also been to BM a couple of times, and as such might do something like reserve more space than they think they need.  I also remember being directed one year not to camp before some letter (maybe E or D?) so that the non-placed camps that arrive early wouldn't score all the prime real estate."
BurningMan,3d6abl,brcfire,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:53:42 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. We are art support and not in a purple area. So there are exceptions.
BurningMan,3d6abl,-QuestionMark-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:22:09 2015 UTC,"Same here.  In general, if there is zero activity on a site when gates open it can be claimed by anyone, but you should ask people around a spot if it's really clear.   Usually a placed camp has a few EA pass people who should be there in advance to set up a beach head for the larger group that gets in post gate."
BurningMan,3d6abl,mans0n2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:22:06 2015 UTC,once the gates open any space is open and free to use...... even in the 'theme camp zone'
BurningMan,3d6abl,Jovankat,8,Mon Jul 13 23:47:39 2015 UTC,Unless camp has claimed it and it setting up on it. You can't just go and set up your camp in a theme camp's art car parking area or firelane etc. Even if it's just that they're saving space for campmates who haven't arrived. Early entry is only for a small portion of a camp and space can and is saved for those that arrive after the gate opens to park and set up. If it's later in the week or an abandoned plot it's different but if a theme camp tells you you're in their space and you can;t set up there they're right and the rangers and placement will tell you that when they're eventually called.  Either way it's a good idea to have a chat to potential neightbous before you set up so you don't end up finding ou they're gonna be playing your least favourite kind of music all week and the flimsy tent you've just set yours up next to is hiding their loud as fuck generator and a stinky camping toilet.
BurningMan,3d6abl,Retsejme,3,Tue Jul 14 00:25:00 2015 UTC,"Just a thought, you might want to ask what a good bar to getting placed is.  For instance, if you commit to 2x as many events that's still only 4. If those events are ~ 1hour long... Well, I'm not in placement, but I can see how that might not be enough.   I imagine they could give you some kind of guideline, with the caveat that it's not a guarantee."
BurningMan,3d6abl,Jovankat,3,Mon Jul 13 22:50:22 2015 UTC,Also not placement   I imagine some all day everyday elements out front of your camp would help a lot too.
BurningMan,3d6abl,JaronK,2,Mon Jul 13 23:17:19 2015 UTC,"If it helps any, our camp got great placement.  We're 20 people strong, and provide events from 7:30am-9am, from 10am-noon, from noon-3pm, from 11am-5pm, and from 10pm-2am daily (each is a different event).  Additionally we have two chill spots that are open to the public and one self running station that's always available.  So we basically have something going on almost constantly through the day."

BurningMan,3d6abl,Crocketteer,2,Wed Jul 15 06:48:31 2015 UTC,"My guess is that it's not enough to throw even a handful of events for your size camp.  Instead of increasing your number of events, which can be difficult to schedule if your camp mates would rather explore at their leisure, you can set up public area in your camp that is open whenever someone from your camp happens to be there and offer some fun interactive games or other activities like crafts.  No formal schedule needed.  As a benchmark for you, our camp has been around 30 people (but growing close to 50 this year) and have gotten placed the past two years.  We put on 2-4 scheduled events including workshops and parties, but we also have a comfortable lounge with some books and games that is open 24/7 for relaxing, plus a bar staffed six of the days for most of each day, along with interactive fun (action for reward) and music with frequent spontaneous dance parties."
BurningMan,3d6abl,Jovankat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:51:25 2015 UTC,"So it seems that the size of your camp is a huge factor in how interactive they'd like your group to be for consideration.   This is definitely true. I thought that was pretty clear but I guess not, and I can't think of exactly how I thought they'd made it clear so that also suggests it's not. I have definitely seen mention of your frontage all needing to look cool or be public elements but that's harder when your interactivity is events at specific times. I do know they give you an idea of how much space they assume groups of different sizes should need. Something like that for interactivity would be helpful but given the different kinds of interactivity I imagine it would be hard to express as simply as the list of  square footage ranges with no. of campers range alongside.   Better luck next year!"
BurningMan,3d6abl,Retsejme,2,Mon Jul 13 23:15:44 2015 UTC,On the other hand: huh. I wonder why.   They aren't an interactive camp. They are an art car support camp. Those don't usually get placed on the esplanade.

Basically their placement app was more ""mobile"" events (things they were doing in other camps or with art cars) this year. It sounds like they weren't planning on much in camp stuff- some happy hours, no big crazy dance stage extravaganza. Reading between the lines of that post, it sounds like finances were a big part of that decision.    Placement is strongly tied to interactivity, so they got bumped. I am a bit surprised that they didn't just get placed further out or in a smaller space. I get losing your esplanade spot if you aren't brining it every night, but completely off the list seems harsh.   To me it's just a really good reminder of impermanence.

That being said, while we were concerned when we were first moved of the Esplanade, we've found we enjoy camping off the Esplanade just as much as we used to enjoy camping on it. I don't really think that a support camp for an art car should have any placement based on 120 people and one car.   In terms of EDM and the loss of OT to that, well, surely this gives a great opportunity for new sound experiences and potentially new EDM camps this year.

A battery powered fan will probably be welcome too"
BurningMan,3d7g33,nonfat,2,Tue Jul 14 05:36:12 2015 UTC,"The rain fly will be a dust scoop, we never use ours.  Get a lightweight comforter or quilt, or a cheap pressed fiber blanket, and some spring clamps, and cover your mesh vents like this.  The heavy top cover keeps out dust, but also helps to insulate the tent and keep it warm at night and cool in the day, plus cuts down on the ambient light. Add a bucket swamp cooler and day napping is entirely possible.  Under shade?  Downright chilly. (That's a meshless tent, but the quilt still is a positive addition).  We still use a flat sheet to cover our bedding, just in case.  We don't change clothes in our tent, or wear shoes in it, that cuts down on the dust.    edit: that's at a regional, at  B-Man, we use a few more spring clamps for a better seal."

BurningMan,3d7g33,Maggiemayday,4,Tue Jul 14 18:27:35 2015 UTC,"I take a heavily meshed tent.  I don't bother with it most night; I spend most nights passed out on something comfortable in the middle of camp; I don't care about dust.   Take an extra sheet that is big enough to easily cover everything inside your tent.  Cover everything inside your tent with that sheet.  Whenever you feel like it, carefully remove said sheet from your tent and shake it out.  Your stuff will be fine."
BurningMan,3d7g33,mudclub,3,Tue Jul 14 02:52:19 2015 UTC,"Ok, so you do that, but that's not necessarily great advice for other people. You're pretty hardcore, dude.

I need to be in my tent, with earplugs and eye mask on, and preferably a fan going for more white noise."

I think I'm going to take your advice about a sheet or something else to cover stuff on the inside of tent.  And I'm going to take other people's advice and cover the vents too."
BurningMan,3d7g33,theseekerofbacon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:23:37 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. The rain cover will help, but barely. Unless you do something about the vents, you'll be covered in dust constantly.  My solution, if the vents are small enough, get stick on velcro strips. Run them along the edges of the vents and stick on AC filters.  If they're as big as the one I'm using, you'll have to find another means of sealing the vents. I'm pretty much planning on dedicating a few hours to duct taping the hell out of the vents so no air can move in or out. It'll end up making it hotter. But, I'm going to put it under an aluminet covered monkey hut and will have an extra tarp for more shade if necessary.  The very low effort and dust heavy solution is to bring a fitted sheet and put it over your stuff during the day. Take the sheet off and you'll have a reasonably clean bed to sleep in. But, you'll need to sweep it off and put the sheet back on every day.  I've only been twice, but the AC filter solution has been my very favorite. Allows for airflow but filters out dust. Though large vents end up costing a whole lot to cover and finding filters big enough is problematic."

BurningMan,3cxe1n,watchyourfeet,3,Sat Jul 11 17:50:56 2015 UTC,Thats the exact opposite of what the ticket FAQ says:  Q: I lost my tickets. Can you replace them?  A: No. We are not responsible for tickets lost in your possession and do not issue replacement tickets.
BurningMan,3cxe1n,pacificmint,4,Sat Jul 11 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"What the FAQ says and the reality of how it actually works are not the same thing.

I was asked if I had moved the tickets somewhere. I was a little confused by the question because previously I had wanted to put the tickets in a specific spot, and my wife didn't like the spot I had in mind, and told me she was going to put them somewhere. I didn't know where she planned on putting them, but I thought that it had already happened a couple days ago. So this morning after asking if I had moved them, I was told they were in the envelopes on the table. I had checked inside one envelope before burning both of them last night. I was only checking to see that the envelope was all paper material.   I had no idea tickets were in one, or that they hadn't been moved somewhere safe already.  4 tickets and two car passes were in the other envelope. fml"

Throwing away my tickets on accident is a fear of mine- in years past I  have opened the envelope to verify tickets, left them in there, and then immediately secured to a corner of my closet with pushpins. When on the road, I keep them in a secured pocket in a waist purse thing that stays on me at all times. I still get paranoid and check x3030303 to make sure they are there.

The Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia’s Altiplano region is the flattest place on earth.   Literally.   A fighter pilot drove a twin afterburning turbofan car to over Mach 1 there in October of 1997.   Yeah. I know. I was there. The Thrust SSC guys were pretty cool.    But they certainly didnt do it when 10,000 people were out there carving up the surface and kicking up the dust.   Yes the playa is pretty flat. But I was there last year when the rain came and people were told to not drive or ride bikes on the roads until the surface dried. People did anyway and every time a tire picked up a clump of mud, it deposited that mud somewhere else, which was then driven over and pressed semi-flat against the surface, leaving the roads pretty less-than-perfectly flat.   I have nothing against people in wheelchairs out there. What I have a problem with is someone not taking responsibility for their own existence. Maybe you have some good friends that are willing to take care of you while you're out there. I'm happy for you.

BurningMan,3ctgym,OverlyPersonal,13,Fri Jul 10 17:17:43 2015 UTC,"So, here's my suggestion: Forget brands. Think cheap. A battery is a battery if it works (well, not really, but for BM purposes this is ok). The battery will be exposed to the heat, dust, maybe rain. Once it's a BM battery it should be nothing else. Spend the money on a good charger / conditioner.  So, which brand? Any. That are free. Yes, free. Here's what I did: Wheelchair distributors use ~35Ah batteries for chairs. Two of them. When someone comes in to replace one, they are required by health regulations to replace BOTH! Often one or both batteries are just fine. Guess what they do with the batteries? Put them on a crate for recycling. I have a relationship with one of these places and now have unlimited access to as many batteries as I need. For free. Ask around CL or call up a local wheelchair place. You might be doing them a favor by hauling some dead weight off the lot.  (But, if you must get a new one, go Optima.)  Edit to add: For smaller batteries, free, ask around your local geek circles. My day job is a sysadmin and when UPS batteries are two years old or report a bad cell guess what? Free 7.5Ah small batteries. I can wire in series or parallel depending on my needs. With a simple conditioning 3/4 are just fine. Like the wheelchair place when a system reports a single bad battery the whole unit gets swapped out. Free batteries. drool"

Plus a cheapie charge controller from AliExpress which had sunlight detection to time the lights automatically at night."
BurningMan,3ctgym,EkriirkE,2,Fri Jul 10 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"IMO The technology used is more important than the brand. I think many of the brands turn out to be the same product, made in the same factory, with a different badge.  TL;DR:  I studied this problem at length some time ago and ended up with an array of 35aH AGM batteries from Interstate Batteries.  Why AGM? Very little discharge over time.  Can mount upside down or way you want. No electrolyte to replace/ruin/leak all over everything. Very nice level discharge cycle for slow discharge operations like running lights or a swamp cooler. Less damage associated with complete discharge (""oops I left the lights on all night"" does not fully ruin the battery.)  Why 35 aH? (why so small?) They are physically small enough for anyone to lift and move around without hurting themselves.  I can get many of them so if one is accidentally fully discharged I will always have another on the ready. I have many of them so they can be deployed in each yurt and shade structure independently. Was the maximum $/aH that was available from my vendor.  (Best bang-for-the-buck.) Disadvantage: 35aH is not very much so if you they can drain relatively quickly depending on what you're doing with them.  Low cranking amps. You wouldn't want to count on an AGM to run a Starter for a motor or anything like that.  Future: Lithium.  If I were to need to replace the entire bank I would seriously consider lithium.  They are much more expensive (like 6x) but theoretically should be a better value in the long run if you can get the full life out of them (which should be something like 7x as many cycles as a regular lead acid type)."
BurningMan,3ctgym,dcineug,2,Fri Jul 10 22:01:18 2015 UTC,"I've been running a 100Ah sunlyte deep cycle AGM VRLA battery fed from a 60W PV panel through a morningstar prostar regulator at the burn for years. Set it up, get the panel up high (on top of an RV or shade structure) and forget about it for the week. Runs my inverter for charging laptop, camera, etc., CPAP at night, and lights in the tent. Maybe wipe the panel off after a white-out. Simple and reliable.  Car batteries are not as good for this application for a few reasons. Mainly because they're often using a liquid electrolyte and are designed to provide a lot of current for a short time (starting) which is basically the opposite of what your intended use is. But if that's all you've got, then I guess that's what you're using.  I'm also a big fan of power-pole style connectors. Pre-wiring everything at home makes for easy playa set up.  I used to haul along a nice 40A smart charger and borrow a genny for a few hours every couple of days to stuff some coulombs back into the batter(ies) but once I got the PV panel it became set and forget."

Marine batteries are usually meant for deep cycle more than car batteries though. My robotic club runs a heavy-duty ground robot off of three of these things, and they're one of the few parts that don't get replaced from year to year.

BurningMan,3ctgym,Draymond_Purple,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:47:52 2015 UTC,"Brand really isn't important, you're not planning on continually using them outside of the burn so longevity after the burn isn't a concern.  Longevity BEFORE the burn is extremely important - by that I mean make sure you keep the batteries plugged in/charging until you head out.  Leaving them unconnected for even a month can kill the battery's capacity.  Keep them with a trickle charge until you're ready to use them, will keep them nice and fresh until the burn."
BurningMan,3ctgym,watchyourfeet,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:51:28 2015 UTC,"Wait...really? I never keep my batteries plugged in, although i use them lightly so I probably wouldn't notice if the capacity drastically dropped."
BurningMan,3ctgym,Burn-O-Matic,6,Fri Jul 10 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what kind of battery engineer you are but, your advice is completely wrong for flooded or sealed lead acid.  LA batteries should be stored at a float charge voltage with a proper charger (~2.25v per cell).  Letting LA batteries sit around for a long time and self discharge leads to sulfation of battery with reduced capacity and life."
BurningMan,3ctgym,hungriest,2,Fri Jul 10 18:53:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're right, sorry! Didn't read the title fully, didn't know we were dealing with lead acid batteries. Deleted so not to confuse anyone. If they're Li ion batteries, don't store at high states of charge."

Recharging them isn't too big of a hassle with a Generator or a Solar Panel setup. We just usually make sure to bring at least three of them (which isn't too crazy at 80 bucks a pop), and recharging one while we use the other one/two.  Also, a tip is that you can take back any battery to Batteries Plus within two weeks for a full refund (and within 45 days for store credit). We did store credit last year, but you could get away with not paying anything for the batteries if you time it right."

Map out your drive home, look for little places along the way, I stayed in Fernley last time i went, which was nice. but that's headed south.  look around see how much time you're looking to save or lose and decide accordingly."
BurningMan,3cqonq,ecco5,2,Fri Jul 10 01:55:15 2015 UTC,"If you're going to Colorado, I would assume you are driving south to I-80 and then heading east. Reno is less than 30 miles west of that point, but Fernley is the town where you join I-80 and it's got motels,  even a casino, I think. If it's rest you want, you can do that in Fernley. If you want a memorable ""rest"" go to Reno. Exodus is when you leave. Your decision."

BurningMan,3cqonq,SapientSlut,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:58:23 2015 UTC,"Book soon. Depending on what night you leave, some Reno hotels are already booked. For instance, I always book a room the night of Saturday, as I either leave right before the Man Burn, right after the Burn, or early Sunday morning. If I decide to leave Sunday morning, I eat the reservation, such is life, but I've also tried to grab a room that Saturday night spontaneously and there was nothing available in all of Reno or anywhere nearby. Had to go to Sacramento."
BurningMan,3cqonq,doctor-yes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:39:45 2015 UTC,"Book in advance.  Labor Day weekend is actually pretty big for tourism in Reno, and there are about 70,000 other BM-affiliated people who will be wanting to fill up the rooms if you don't.  If you wait until the week before the Burn (or, god forbid, try to use a cell phone after leaving the Playa) you're likely to find that there are literally no rooms left anywhere in the entire Reno metropolitan area.

BurningMan,3cpatl,lshiva,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:25:59 2015 UTC,"Home Depot or any other purveyor of fine construction goods works. 18 inches is fine for a tent. One for each guy line and strap, since you'll want to use everything the tent offers in the way of sturdiness and stabilization.   Along with the rebar get a small sledge, a large set of vice grips, a roll of duct tape, and some solar garden lights.   To get the rebar out after pounding it in with the sledge you clamp the vice grips on and spin while gently pulling. It should slide right out.   When transporting the rebar, bundle it all together and wrap it in duct tape. It will keep you from ripping up your hands, make sure you don't misplace a piece, and simplify carrying it around.   The solar lights go on the ends of the rebar. You could use tennis balls, plastic rebar caps, a wad of duct tape, empty plastic bottles, or whatever else, but solar lights make it easier to spot your tent and minimize the chances of drunks tripping over a guy line."

It provides wind protection as well as shade, so that you can use your tent comfortably (though having a fan for the tent is still recommended if you want to sleep anytime between 10am and 10pm).

USB is a standard -- not a product. Quality / durability depends on the manufacture. Some USB things are great, some are terrible. All depends on which specific items you're considering. Also, USB is roughly 5v out. Be sure to take into consideration how many amps you need for whatever you decide to power."
BurningMan,3cpjge,brcfire,2,Thu Jul 9 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"Let me be more specific. I am thinking of getting a solar panel+battery and using rechargeable USB batteries (like for your phone) to power things like glow (instead of batteries). I am curious about peoples experience using things like these http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J56XG8S.  Are they bright enough, last long enough, how many battery packs did you have to carry (did your pants/dress/kilt/nothing fall down from it?) things like that."
BurningMan,3cpjge,flickerkuu,3,Thu Jul 9 21:33:27 2015 UTC,"USB power?  Sound small and not very useful unless you are obsessed with checking your Iphone.  For real non-generator power, grab a Marine Battery and use that. With power inverters, solar panels, basically you can have normal electricity.  I ran lights and an evaporative cooler for a week without re-charging it. You can also jump your car with it later if needed.  Cool, quiet, efficient.  If you tried some USB system you would get a mess of drained batteries and nothing really powered."
BurningMan,3cpjge,the_real_xuth,2,Thu Jul 9 19:46:53 2015 UTC,"I think what OP is alluding to is only using things that are either powered through a USB port or have rechargeable batteries that are charged via a USB port rather than things that use small disposable cells.  As to the effectiveness, sure this would work just fine.  But don't go spending $50 on a big USB power brick and more money on a bunch of new USB lights and toys if you're only ever going to use them one or two times.  But this assumes extremely modest needs.  Personally I have a handful of 18Ah AGM lead acid batteries and 60W of solar panels.  This suits my needs but others would find it anemic."
BurningMan,3cpjge,Chris-Knight,2,Thu Jul 9 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"Rechargeable USB 'power packs' supply 5V at anywhere from .5A to 2.1A per USB port.  That's not a lot of power, but if you are light consumer you'll do OK.  You CAN light EL Wire and programmable LEDs with it.  You might even be able to light your tent if you don't need a lot of light.    The LEDs you referenced at Amazon do not list how much current they draw, so it is impossible to figure out whether you can run them on a 5V 2.1A USB port.  WARNING:  Almost every USB power pack is either Lithium-Ion or Lithium-Polymer, both of which get very unhappy when they are hot.  Do not leave your solar charger and batteries on the dashboard of your car during the daytime.

That and the browning of the sausage before adding the eggs.  Sausage and eggs, silly gift ideas, picklebacks and as cheesy as it is to say, an open heart and open eyes.  3)   I’m a huge fan of “positive graffiti” if you will. I would install faux brick or concrete walls around the playa with simple messages “You Look Nice Today”, “It’s OK, everyone makes mistakes”,  etc. That or maybe I’d screen print several passages from Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet. Each poem would be a journey, each line or stanza on a separate, near shear fabric which had to be stepped through to reach the next. A lot of fun could be had with this with natural light or colors after dark.   4)  I can’t possibly top the micropig in booties, but I can give you OC.  I’m a hasher which means I run drunk through the woods often with people in various states of undress while singing silly songs.

All of the alcohol we serve all week long was made by me personally, with care.   I don't know if that makes BRC a better place though, definitely more interesting. I also spent a bit of time helping make the twisted metal trees for the temple a few weeks back whilst visiting Oakland. We are as hospitable as can be, and our camp has grown over the years by taking in strays and making fantastic friends on the playa.  I also have a fire station alarm bell that is being mounted to my bike, to ensure people know I'm coming up on them and to avoid any collisions. I expect to see a lot of pants and kilt shitting by startled, wide eyed burners. This thing will drown out Root Society.  3) I really, really wanted to see somebody bring the old transport platform (it was for sale!) for the Space Shuttle to the playa, and place a massive interactive art installation on top of it. Circling the inner playa 24/7 very, very slowly. I wanted to place a massive fire based monochrome display on top of it, playing video and video games. We are talking VGA resolution, which is 307200 individual pixels. Little pilot lights that flicker in sync to display images.  4) My dog Chikin, when he was a pup. I simply can't think of a cuter baby animal.  5) Ya I'll go to the meetup. I'll even pinkie swear.  6) Tell me about it. I have a garage full of gear, thousands upon thousands of dollars of stuff - a lot of which doesn't seem to get used every year but gets hauled out there anyway. My first year, me and a buddy drove a 24' uhaul to the playa, packed front to back, top to bottom. I am well versed in self preservation on the playa, I live in a hexayurt, have a massive shade and bring a refrigerator. I bring more water, food and booze than I can possibly use, and share it all with glee.  Thanks for doing this, you are going to make somebody very happy."

BurningMan,3cn1rm,WanderingWino,5,Thu Jul 9 13:57:22 2015 UTC,"Awesome, great idea, true Burner spirit and attitude. Here’s my submission.   1) Tell us why you don't have a ticket yet. What's your particular reason why? NO SOB STORIES. FUCK YOUR SOB STORIES, THIS IS A VACATION. I am 100% serious.   Okay I’ll be honest here. I don’t have a ticket yet because during the main sale I was too busy masturbating to last year’s photos of myself straddling that rainbow unicorn. Denny The Lion I think his name was? Great guy. No but seriously though I couldn’t figure out how to get my Javascript hack working quickly enough so I could just blow past the queue completely and get summarily disqualified, so I waited in line like a rule-follower. SELF RELIANCE FAILURE!   2) What are you going to do to make BRC a better place? (You're going to be acting as my proxy, that shit had better be good, even if it's just delighting the jaded old fucks with your wide-eyed enthusiasm).   Here’s what I’d like to do: harass the plug n’ play camps (or just stare longingly in their direc— JUST KIDDING oh my god), talk to a pretty girl and totally strike out. Talk to another pretty girl. “How’s your burn going? Ah that’s great…” is how I suspect this conversation will start and end (the burned hand teaches best is a saying I heard once). I’m going to introduce my girlfriend to my other girlfriend for the first time. Should be a good show, all are invited, tix are going fast! I’m going to NOT wake my camp up at 5am by farting into the megaphone (are you reading this, Ethan you asshole?). I’m going to shut my fucking face during the Temple burn. I'm going to let someone cut in front of me in the ice line. I'm going to make maps of the playa porta-potties' locations on Day 1 and then disseminate them to everyone I see so we can minimize the 45-minute night-hunts for the two dull blue lights. Did anyone else have trouble finding those things last year? Because oh my god.   3) What was your favourite imaginary art piece that wasn't on the playa last year but should have been? (Make something up)   I know this was an unpopular one, but I really liked Denny The Lion. Lots of good stuff in the secret flap in the back. Anybody else find it? Yeah, it was located just beyond my common sense and David Bowie's asshole. I dunno, something about it just spoke to me (PM me if you saw it too!!).   4) Post a photo of the cutest baby animal you can find.   I love these lil guys and so does my pellet gun. Noooo just kidding. Give them a head start at least.   5) Pinkie-swear that you'll come to the goddamned reddit meetup and meet your community. (You ARE a member here, right? Not just some fucker joining for the first time to try and mooch a ticket?)   Yes I will do that! I lost my pinkies in a pinkie-related accident some years back. Can I give a thumbs-up instead? And here is a link to a comment of mine from last year calling out a guy for saying he/she “was so glad they closed the gate due to the bad weather” because it “teaches us that expectations are bad… newbies wanted the experience, well, this is the experience.” I didn’t realize at the time that Buddha posted on Reddit! This proves I have been part of this subreddit for 1 or more years and that I attended BM last year too.   6) Burning Man is expensive and requires lots of preparation. Post a paragraph that shows you understand the costs of getting there, and any preparation you've been doing to have all you need to survive, since IT IS JULY ALREADY. Convince us you're not going to be a burden.   A picture is worth a thousand words so looks like I gotta make this paragraph a thousand words (no). So I have a bike with glowy stuff, I’m pretty sure that’s a playa law (my lawyer friend Denny The Lion helped draft that law, so I know what I’m talking about). I just replaced four tires, got new brakes, and averted a catastrophic disaster by fixing the engine mount on my awesome PT Cruiser (standard model) in preparation for this pilgrimage. Most of my stuff from last year is reusable so they are all sitting in two big-ass bins labeled clearly with playa dust. I have two tents, one to sleep in and one to stash my… clothes in. I got lights of all kinds. Lights for me. Lights for my girlfriend. Lights for another girlfriend. Lights for strangers. You want lights I got lights. I’m basically a light guy is what I’m saying here. Well I can be, if they ask. You gotta ask. Darkwads? Get yourself a light! And like I said above, maps of porta-potties' locations in the playa. I’m about 1.5 grand or so invested already; that’s just the name of the game. I discovered last year through empirical observation that 6” platform boots are not that comfortable honestly so I will not be bringing them this year (a man learns, a man burns)."

BurningMan,3cn1rm,tossy_mctosserson,5,Thu Jul 9 05:17:35 2015 UTC,"1) I’m a winemaker who has been faced with a rather hot vintage and didn’t think that I would be able to attend because fruit would be coming in early. Because my future wife (we’re not engaged but just had a talk last night about doing that business on playa) will be attending for her first time. My business partner said I should go since her first time was with the man she is marrying now and it helped establish the foundation of their relationship.  2) Each year I go, I do a huge wine tasting in the French Quarter. This year, I am planning a perimeter fence bike race! As far as I know, this will be the first of its kind and I can’t wait! Additionally, I am a team for my camp (Porch Times 2:45 & A) and can’t wait to help facilitate all of the shit we have planned: huge burlesque show with the Seattle fire conclave, robotic mobile fucking couch (making it's second appearance,) 600 square foot massive porch (making its third appearance,) LED Photo Booth, shade dome with silks and daily naked happy hours!    3) That a massive trebuchet hasn’t been brought out to set the temple or man ablaze yet bewilders me. How fucking cool would THAT be?!  4) For some reason, this little fluff always makes me happy when I'm down.  5) I solemnly pinkie-swear to attend the reddit meet-up! Also, I can’t wait to!  6) My partner and I have been kitting out her voyager for this occasion for a year now. We have a 45 watt solar panel array on the roof that hooks up to a swamp cooler. Shade structure that the van sits under (the solar array gets moved to outside the van and is staked down with rebar that has tennis ball tips.) And since this will be my third burn, I’ve got all the gear I need from large 5 gallon water vessels to gold bond for my boys. My playa bike is well maintained and my EL wire has been checked and has fresh batteries (I used it for the World Naked Bike Ride in Portland last month.)  Anyway, thanks for being so kind! This is an incredibly thoughtful gift to give someone."

BurningMan,3cn1rm,BrettWilkinsonUK,5,Thu Jul 9 07:26:46 2015 UTC,"1) I did the usual get in line for the sales thing. Didn’t get a ticket, got in line too late or whatever. But I wasn’t too worried, because my girlfriend and some of her buddies from the Pier Crew and Embrace began work on a large scale piece for the playa (GBZ, a 30ft climbable hippy-trap bugzapper). So it was assumed that we’d be set for tickets. Everything went smoothly from the planning to getting early grants from the Org. But due to creative control, and people’s procrastination the financing for the project fell through, and we were unable to get enough funds to start work on the structure. It’s been shelved for next year, but the entire crew is now scrambling to find tickets that we were almost certainly assured we’d have.   2) I’ve spend the last 5 burns playing tour guide to starry eyed virgins and keeping them hydrated, spent time working as a temple guardian one year, worked in Reno on the Morris Burner Hotel, and multiple events keeping DPW and related essentials fed and sufficiently boozed. The plan this year has been to work with BRCU on their set-up and tear down, potentially working as a cook for them as well. I’ll also probably be doing some fluffer work for DPW around pre-burn (coming from Reno, making it up for the pre-burn isn’t too hard). And then I’ll likely spend a good chunk of the week traveling around to theme camps and making small-batch artisan cocktails to share.  3) I still want to see an iceberg art-car. There are so many goddamned boats out there that I want to see (well I want to make, but the cost is… lots) a decent ice-berg on wheels that I can park in front of the big party ships at night and suddenly turn the lights on. Just boat cruising around when suddenly, BAM! “Iceberg ahead!!!” It’s been kicking around in my head for years, but still haven’t seen anything like it out there.  4) fox pup http://www.acuteaday.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/artic-fox-pups.jpg  5) I swear to the gods above and below. I will be there.  6) I’ve done the burn for 6 years, I’ve got 30 gallons of water in jugs sitting in my garage. I’ve, for the last 3 years got food for myself, and at least three campmates. I’ve never once ran out of booze. I’ve never once gotten dehydrated on playa. I hand sewed a Bedouin tent from canvas, by myself, which holds up perfectly on playa. I have a car that smells like playa dust year-round. I spent last summer volunteering on the in-town build of Embrace and know how to bust my hump to get shit done. I have practiced packing my shit to go and last year it took me an hour to get everything in my car and get on the road. And I was the most prepped member of my 10 person camp. I’ve done this.   Please oh please let playadippidy help me go this year :)"
BurningMan,3cn1rm,SLOKnightfall,2,Thu Jul 9 18:03:48 2015 UTC,"I'm curious...with your cited work, why do you not have access to departmental tickets?  Or through the directed ticket sale for that art project?  The first round of that was long ago....long before any crumbling of the project, etc.   Did the Org revoke those tix?"
BurningMan,3cn1rm,TooBreezy,2,Thu Jul 9 18:17:03 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""early grant from the Org""? Never heard of such a thing. Projects either get grants for playa art or they don't?"
BurningMan,3cn1rm,nonfat,2,Thu Jul 9 22:13:05 2015 UTC,I remember this thread from last year! You are really awesome for doing this!  disclaimer: not sucking up. Already have a ticket. Just here for the cute animals.
BurningMan,3cn1rm,esqueish,2,Fri Jul 10 00:09:04 2015 UTC,"1) I don't have a ticket because I did not apply for one in the main sale. Last year was our first burn and loved every second of it, however my wife and I decided to try and have a kid this year so did not bother to apply on expectation she would be heavily pregnant. No luck as yet on the kid front but we have a had heaps of sex this year! Given it is so close to the burn we decided we had to go again. So far have found one ticket from a friend and need just one more (for my wife as I am taking dibs haha!).   2) Contribute more than we receive. Last year was our first burn,  we spent a lot of time 'making sure not to miss anything'. This year the goal is to flip around the ratio of personal energy vs community energy ie spend more time contributing directly to our camp for the benefit of the entire playa. The best part of theme camps is that groups can team up to contribute more than any individual. Our camp got placed on the Esplanade for the first time this year so time to step up to the big league.  3) Why wasn't there bicycle jousting? seriously a couple of re-enforced cardboard pipes for lances and some home made shields and cheering crowd as 'knights' fight for glory. I think this is very doable for this year..screw imaginary lets make that reality  4) Boom! http://www.earthporm.com/tired-dogs/    (on link scroll down... I am specifically referring to the second one on the list with the little dog poking his tongue out)  5) I swear. As mentioned above it is all about making the community better. (I must admit I have only recently joined Reddit and am finding my way around)   6) Coming from Overseas is crazy expensive with international flights, restrictions on luggage plus transport etc. We decided to rent an RV from vegas last year and drive which was expensive, however this year have purchased a Hexayurt and are now about to commit to purchasing flight tickets  from London, car rental, bike rental and camping gear with only one of us having a ticket!   Luckily we have an entire chest of fancy dress at home, LEDS etc and of course a mug with carabiner clip.  At end of day we are not going to be a burden because if we don't get a spare ticket for my wife then I will not go alone and re-gift my ticket to some one deserving. I should say we already have a vehicle pass so will of course re-gift this one.  Finally thanks for this opportunity and good luck to the person who ends up winning it. I have been to festivals all over the world and Burningman is so special. Enjoy your gift!"
BurningMan,3cn1rm,chronicENTity,6,Sat Jul 11 13:42:06 2015 UTC,"First off, thanks for giving back to the community and giving those of us looking for a ticket a chance for one.    1)  So the reason that I don’t have a ticket is because up to a few months ago I was planning on taking a break from the Burn this year and not planning to go.  But after months of persistent friends who want me out there trying to change my mind and having some PTO free up from previous vacation plans falling through, I decided to go if I could acquire a ticket.  I figure if it is meant for me to make it out this year, “the Playa Will Provide”.  Of course to maximize the chances for that to happen I’ve signed up for STEP, have been networking with my friends & local burners, planning on trying for a ticket during the OMG sale and have been keeping an eye out for opportunities like this. I’m now eagerly keeping my fingers crossed that I’ll be able to make it out to unwind a bit and enjoy some time with my friends and campmates that I only get to see out there.    2)  I try to make it a better place by keeping an eye out on ways I can help out while I am out wandering they city.  It could be as simple as a kind word and a hug to someone who looks like they could use some cheering up, to spending a few hours helping out a stranger put up their art project or camp.  I find these interactions fulfilling to me and appreciated by those I help.  I figure that if I can make a few people’s burn better, then their happiness will hopefully spread to those around them.  Plus I get to meet many strange and wonderful people.    I also try to spread the word about the area’s Honey-Bear Badger population and how to be safe when encountering them during the event.       3)  My favorite non-existent art piece from last year was the “Translation Station”.  It was a small enclosure that had collected messages of hope and translated them into a multitude of languages.  These messages were then inscribed on the walls with the words laid out in a way to create images when viewed from a distance.  There were also books where visitors could leave their own messages and translate messages left by others.    4)  For the cute animal I give you infamous Honey-Bear Playa Badger cub.     5)  I will Pinkie-Swear that I’ll try my hardest to make it to the meet up, baring getting caught up in some unexpected playa adventure on my way to it.  I’ve been a member of Reddit for almost a year now, and am eager to me other Reddit Burners.    6)  I’ve been heading out the Playa since 2000, so I’m at a point where I have everything I need to survive and enjoy myself out there. Part of what convinced me to head out this year was looking at last year’s packing & to do lists and realizing that there was not much that I needed to do to make it work.  The few things I would need to do, are the things that I would do shortly before the event anyhow, ie get food, clean water barrels, pack.  In preparation I’ve been sorting through my equipment and making sure every thing is still functional and listing what I need to dedicate more time looking for and/or replace.   The only real costs are for food & gas, and those are easy to budget for before the event."
BurningMan,3cn1rm,esqueish,2,Thu Jul 9 20:59:12 2015 UTC,"Just as a quick edit. im pulling myself from this... raffle? Contest? whatever it is. After writing the comment below, i took a hard look at going to burning man. I always said it would take me a year to plan on going to Burning Man. I looked at my intentions and decided that, it didnt matter. Free ticket or not. Im going. So in self-reliant mode, i got myself a ticket. 100% going. Ill see you guys at the meet up anyway. Thanks for doing this.  The reality is that I chose to go to my local regional. Flipside ticket sales are at the same time. I am part of a large theme camp at flipside and have a lot of commitments there. The money is also not there for me to do both otherwise I would.    Ive been to 9 local burns in the Texas area,  & the one constant need that i have seen in every one is being a volunteer. I volunteer my time at flipside by having been a greeter, perimeter lieutenant   as well as participating in the Combustion Chamber, which is a group of community members who meet every other week & help advise our LLC on what the community wants the direction for flipside to go. Volunteering is what helps (atleast local burns) maintain and continuing to prosper. So i would choose to volunteer at a post that might need help.     I missed out on the 30'x30' pillow pit, it would have been a great place to take a nap or find a new cuddle buddy.  Also it would be cool if Arc Attack finally went.   She is 13 this year, but she will always be my baby    I will absolutely go to the reddit community meet up if given a ticket, that would not be an issue, I welcome meeting fellow burners.    This all hinges on being awarded the ticket, however I already have a few friends that are making the trip out there and have been given permission to camp with them.  I have also been sponsored on the trip by my aunt who encourages these vacations. She is awaiting a budget for me to put together and between us, we are going to come together on how much gas would be needed for 3,600 miles, food, & water. I already have camping equipment so that is taken care of. Im going to see if someone local needs a ride to help with the cost of gas.~~~~"
BurningMan,3cn1rm,Hazhead,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:16:59 2015 UTC,"edit aahh still writing but it submitted:  you... just wow... you sir or madam rock!  ok here is my entry!   Why I don't have a ticket yet is 2 part. First is that I wasn't able to buy during the sale, lame but it is what it is. Second is that I haven't really been participating with my camp this last year as I tore a muscle in my left leg(the one that lets you put downward pressure with your toes,, it REALLY sucked) on Wed night last year during the white party.  That was a real bitch and I am still limping, I am almost better but it prevented me from doing a lot of activities with my usual camp mates (Firedrop, they are mostly local to me and do stuff through out the year), so no ticket via them this year either.  I will pick up moop.    I will prevent drunken people from trying to wave down sewage trucks in order to get sprayed with water (yep that happened) I will volunteer for temple guardian (I did last year, but not much as after Wednesday I was in crutches and unable to put any weight on my left leg)  I will walk around one one morning with a tray of freshly cooked bacon and make morning bacon miracles happen for some people. I will stay until Tuesday (omg screw leaving on sun night or monday morning,,, sooo not fun) and spend time making sure my neighbors didn't leave any little moops behind. I will participate.  This one is easy.  A large electric fence.  Covered in signs saying ""DANGER DO NOT TOUCH"" ""TOUCHING THIS WILL HURT"" etc etc.  And then have it setup to a small metal tower covered in lights.  Every time someone touches this fence it will shock them, and then light up in the middle (maybe with a counter) and make some noise.  Preferably this would be located somewhat close to the edges of the dance party zones either at 10 + esp or 2 + esp, so that it would shock many a sparkle pony. i think this is a baby? cute but makes me laugh, if that dog isn't baby enough, here is something i stole from /r/aww how did they find a shirt in his size? Yep, will come to meetup no problemo, I meant to come last year, but I got distracted by something shiny I have been 5 times, each time I did the prep work for both myself and my younger brother.  This year my brother just got a new job, and has a girlfriend that well, he has to skip a year.  Anyways, I have the stuff for two people for camping, I buy random ""this is for burning man"" things through out the year, both snackwise, lights, whatever. Here is my basement  It is a mess, but ya there it is.  Top Left is a few green tubs, this is actually a whole rack of tubs all filled with different burning things (pink), (light green) more tubs, (purple didnt come out at all, but there are a few random things back there), (teal) cooking stuff for burning man), (black is the hexayurt), and then there are various Christmas and whatever else things i can pile in the basement.  Thanks for the contest!   Cheers  Stop Being So Bossy! (ya that's my playa name)"

BurningMan,3cn1rm,participation_ribbon,4,Sat Jul 11 03:25:56 2015 UTC,"Lost job (actively looking, but the job market sucks for my field in my current location/city, so I'm worried I won't get another gig in time), so money's too tight for a ticket so far this year.  I will help my camp build more lights and interactive electronics/flame effects for our Esplanade camp (I've been with them for 3 years now and even though I won't be going this year, I'm still part of the camp and work on projects). Our camp will be bringing tons of booze, hundreds of gallons of propane for flame effects, and some of the best music entertainment from both our area and the SF area. Also, I would help redesign the lighting of another camp's awesome art car (I did the lighting for our camp's car last year, so it's already all set).  If I go, I'm working on a personal art project that I haven't told anybody about; it's honestly pretty sweet, but mum's the word until I get to show it on the Playa! A fire fountain with tiki god heads and the water/gas mixture is pumped through their glowing mouths into a lagoon-like basin. The water/fuel mixture would have flames, but would have been ""touchable"" by human hands. It also had a PIR motion sensor, so when people walked by, it would activate a light show and play various sounds through its built-in speakers.  Here's some baby chicks (future Glamcocks?) trying to keep warm against a coffee mug.  I will pinkie-swear that, even with ""Playa time"", I will make certain to both attend and represent at the Reddit Meetup. You will know my camp's address, so you can come hang me from our structure if I end up breaking this promise!  If I am able to attend this year, it will be my third year in a row making it out to TTiTD. In the two years I have attended, I've been part of Early Entry and have lived in the city for almost two weeks each year. I have setup an arrangement that if I am somehow able to acquire a ticket this year, I will have a friend/sponsor cover my camp dues as well as my transportation to and from the event. I already have my camp gear, shade structure, electronics/power generation tools, Playa bike, coolers, costumes, gifts, interactive games, moop bags, and storage containers ready to go. As somebody who wanted to go for a decade before they finally made the leap, I fully understand the costs (both monetary and emotional/spiritual) that are required to transport to and from and live in BRC AKA Home. Finally, I have a social safety net that I have built for myself that I can tap, if something goes FUBAR.    As always, THANK YOU!!! And best of luck to everybody! Whether I win or not, I sincerely hope to see all of your beautiful faces in the desert at some point in my future. :-)"

BurningMan,3cn1rm,PedanticPedant,3,Thu Jul 9 06:26:42 2015 UTC,Thanks but I'm not really interested in gifting you a ticket so you can gift her a ticket. I'm suspicious of people who do not use the Internet. ;)  I hope she makes it out!
BurningMan,3cn1rm,pogmo47,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:45:47 2015 UTC,"1)  I don't have a ticket because, although he started running at the sound of the starters pistol, my little green man was either short of breath or short of cash and wasn't awarded a ticket at the finish.  I'm registered for the OMG sale and STEP, so if I get a ticket through that, I will re-gift this one to a worthy burner.  2) I'm bringing back my art car.  It's 3 stories of fun and danger that never has a velvet rope.  I use it for Artery tours, and support other groups events with fun and sound as well as doing at least one greeter shift. See it in action here, or search PerVertical Playground: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG50gUIgw_w https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rN7S7r6yi4 Getting pretty nervous that with less than two months to go I don't have a ticket or vehicle pass.  I do however have DMV approval and early entry, and my crew and I are working diligently to get it in shape on the belief that tickets will come through somehow.  3) My favorite piece that wasn't there is the aforementioned art car, which had to stay home because I didn't have the time or money to make it happen.  I know it's not imaginary, but it is what is occupying my brain.   4) I just learned that pandas are considered the laziest creatures in the animal kingdom and have the approximate metabolism of a hibernating black bear.  I find this admirable and therefore here is a baby panda: http://i.ytimg.com/vi/O4pvFkRr8pI/maxresdefault.jpg  5) I'm new to Reddit but not for the purpose of mooching.  I don't know what the meet-up is yet but I'm willing to try [almost] anything.  6) This will be my 9th burn, and I am always over prepared.  Typically I spend 12-13 days on playa building my shit and helping others with theirs.  In addition to the necessities always have a welder, torch, generator, air compressor and excess food and water.  Every year I have helped out strangers in distress."
BurningMan,3cn1rm,sophiak12,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:27:16 2015 UTC,"First of all thanks for the opportunity.   1) Cleared my schedule and watched the screen for a couple of hours only to find out that there were none left.  - Don´t want to buy it from scalpers in Stubhub, plus I dont trust them.  - No luck with the STEP sale.  - Didnt want to mess with the low income as some people do.   2) First of all my awesome energy and vibe as well as im bringing the love of my life to BM for the first time to see how with a little love and purpose can bring out the best of humanity in the most desolate places.  - We are head of organising Camp Pipper a camp we built during BM last year with a group of frist timers we all met during the week. We became more than family.   3) The idea of ALL of the burners carrying light at night (wouldnt that be nice, no dark tards)  4) The cutest animal in the word is this pupp her name is Indi.  https://instagram.com/p/zVymWmQb3W/?taken-by=isi_romanovsky  5) A gentlemans agreement. You have my word.   6) I already have the RV Booked, The hotel to stay the night before, the plane ticket. Expenses money, food, bike, gas, treats, and our camp installation.   I think its awesome what you are doing I hope it works out.   Worth a shot.   IR"
BurningMan,3cn1rm,druiddesign,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:50:14 2015 UTC,"1) I honestly didn’t think I would be able to make it this year.  Now that I am in a position to go, I’ve been looking for an art project to volunteer with, signed up for STEP, the whole 9.  I’m also ready for the OMG sale if need be.  But I’m not worried, as the Playa provides!  I want this vacation more than anything; what better vacation is there than BM??  I guess I could visit my family on the east coast, but I would way rather visit my family on the Playa. ;)  I can’t think of anywhere else I would rather be.  And my will is strong.  I WILL see all you lovely people on the Playa this year.  My girlfriend already has her ticket and a vehicle pass, so I (or you) would give that to someone else in need that already has a BM ticket.  2) Oh I bring all the gifts of love, from hugs and good tidings, and wonderful cocktails I learned to make as a bartender (cucumber gin and soda anyone?). I will have extra water and extra lights in case I see someone in need.  I will be all over the MOOP and help with any LNT needs!  I can also help in camps as I love meeting new people.  I have strong technical skills, if that comes up.  I can also dance a mean jig.  3) Oh an amazing art project would be the giant Ewok village that spanned over and around the art projects to give a great vantage from higher up and shade for those down below.  It burns really good too…  4) Aren’t red pandas the cutest?!    5) Not only do I pinkie-swear, but I would insist on it!  I love meeting new people, and I would love to share stories and jokes (especially dad-jokes!).  6) My partner in crime and I have everything sorted out and paid for!  Special thermo tent, car port for extra shade, a camp (camp fees are even paid already).  My car is going through an inspection as we speak, and costume materials are bought (sewing to commence this very weekend!), all of the equipment one would need on the Playa from empty jugs for grey water removal, lights (ALL THE LIGHTS), bikes, Camelbaks, extra goggles, etc…  My partner even has her ticket already as well as a vehicle pass for us.  All that I am missing is my ticket!  Edit: for formatting.  Thanks for reading!"
BurningMan,3cn1rm,ecco5,3,Tue Jul 14 00:06:55 2015 UTC,"1) Sadly I don’t have a ticket as my Internet had chosen that particular (final sale) week to go down, and I (mistakenly) relied on the 3G wireless modem my ISP sent me.  Apparently the lag was too high, as I waited in the virtual line at ticket sale time until it told me I won the no-ticket-for-you prize.  Many sighs were had, but I figured it wasn’t meant to be at that time.  2) I’m going to make LED light suits for other Canadians coming from Toronto from the Centre for Social Innovation!    3)Last year was my first burn, and I was super stressed beforehand about fitting in and not making a mistake of some kind.  I knew I had to be lit up at night, so I did the best I could and glued some old LED’s to a jacket and pants.  I had lots of them, so it turned out brighter than I expected.  When I was out on the playa the first night people kept riding toward me following the light of my suit, and telling me they thought I was an art installation when they caught me!  They loved my suit, and the super warm welcome all night almost made me cry (I got a ‘participation ribbon’ from some people, which was a great moment of synchronicity for me!).  All through the week the amazing art kept inspiring me, and when I got back I kept having this vision of “Samurai’s of Love”, that were lit up in LED samurai armour and guarded a love box and shined love on others (it’s a work in progress).  Anyhow, I want to bring them to the playa as a strange wandering art installation!  4)Baby wombat ftw  5)I take pinkie-swears seriously, and I pledge my attendance!  6)Last year I did the tent thing and I still have all of my gear (including my awesome hiking boots, 3m air filter mask, camping gear, etc).  It was a great experience, and driving a rented minivan up from Vegas last time worked great (fly in for pre-trip vacay, max insurance on vehicle so I just returned it 'as is' post superficial clean-up, and weird place to decompress ☺ ).  I brought enough food and water last time and I’d do the same again!  p.s. Thanks for doing this, and congrats to whomever wins! Have a great burn! p.p.s. My LED suit! (but didn't wear spiderman mask of course :)"
BurningMan,3cn1rm,ecco5,2,Tue Jul 14 20:43:52 2015 UTC,"Four years in a row, I thought it would make sense to take a year off.  Then I met a girl.  I want to be there with her. I work gate and bring big art.  I have a project from my regional burn (Youtopia) that hasn't been to the big burn yet, and I would love to see it there.  It's called Cozy Danger. You know Edison's wax cylinders?  Like that, but big and steel.  And plays dubstep.  Takes four strong people to change out the cylinder, and two to get it cranking. Here you go! Ticket willing, I will be there. No worries on the prep stuff.  I spent over 100 nights in a tent in 2013, and right now my car isn't unpacked from my last trip."

BurningMan,3cn1rm,theseekerofbacon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:47:48 2015 UTC,"Big art, but not funded / placed.  The one I want bring (Cozy Danger) is like a jungle gym with soft places to relax and big spikes.  It will be in front of camp, and at one point at the regional burn had 27 people on it (and there was still a little room).  Big, but not huge.  I have had a staff ticket through gate the last two years, but tried out rangering last year and so didn't work enough gate shifts."

BurningMan,3cn1rm,pocketmonster,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:03:03 2015 UTC,"You rock for doing this! Thank you.    Signed in right at noon but my que was too far behind to get a ticket, and have not heard back from the STEP program yet. Since it was my first year last year, I can now focus not so much on survival, but how to bring and contribute more to the playa! I did boozy snow cones last year with my camp and plan to do that again. I also began helping out with the Carny Corral, which will be at the Midway this year. I just did my first videochat to discuss how to get more involved—I want  to help with decorations/volunteering (if I go) /fundraising. My camp crew is also devising a plan to create a mobile silent disco with LED lights, wireless headphones, and arm-flailing dancing.  Oh man. I’m thinking an art piece that’s like a carnival ride—Zeus would be the large center figure with his scepter shooting fire. The cars you get into circulate around it are different Greek Gods (Hercules, Hermes, etc) on clouds. It would work like The Scrambler.   Because, pugs.  Pinky swear!  I was one of the lead organizers for food for our camp of 17 last year, and am already planning that again! We premake, vacuum seal, and freeze our meals and then boil it there, which is delicious but also takes a lot of planning. I’m also starting to make my gifts, making outfits, and creating packing lists.    Have a great burn!"
BurningMan,3cn1rm,Jovankat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:18:55 2015 UTC,"I do not have a ticket because I figure everything combined I can't afford the trip.  Buying a ticket on top of everything adds a great expense.  Not to mention when ticket sales came around I didn't have enough money in my VISA debit account to purchase one.  Not sobbing, just the truth.   Honestly I visited Burning Man in 2007 and I don't know if I did any good or left any lasting gifts behind.  I keep in contact casually with a few people I met there but I feel like I stayed in my shell all week.  This reflection is perhaps after many years of overanalyzing though.  I have realized though that the best thing I can give is my time.  I am a very patient and resilient person though, I might not have the outgoing personality to volunteer bartend, but if you have any other chores that need done, cooking, MOOPing, building, hauling/lugging/lifting (I can lift up to 60lb easily), etc.  I am willing to do it.  Ultimately I would join up with a small-medium camp and fit into their volunteer shifts or duties and smile/socialize with as many people as I can.  Also ride sharing.  I would be bringing my own vehicle and would ride share anyone that could fit their gear in with mine. The unicorn stable.  A pearlescent white building with 6 stalls for the unicorns stabled inside.  Their bedding is pure glitter and christmas tree tinsel, which sounds MOOPy but unicorn magic keeps it contained to their stalls.  Burners are allowed to interact with the unicorns, who selectively talk or respond to random people, you can share your wishes or good messages of fortune or just find a friend to talk to, or just stand and pat them or interview them asking them questions about unicorn life.  Who wouldn't want to meet a unicorn! https://41.media.tumblr.com/d8a1acf835eaeb2deb4eb481548fc13b/tumblr_nr5kh1KoHk1qewacoo3_540.jpg I would be there for sure.  I would buy/borrow a watch for the event just to make sure I was on time. I already have camping gear I can borrow (collective family shared gear) and I have been to Burning Man before and way overpacked so I know what I would not take (I brought everything and the kitchen sink last time, I swear).  I know it is expensive and I would be driving, but the money saved on the ticket helps greatly and affords something like the gas required to reach the event.  When I went in 2007 I didn't start planning my trip or buy my ticket until July and I did okay.  I have some casual connections to possible camps that I could camp with and share facilities like shower and shade."
BurningMan,3cn1rm,fireproofsalamander,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:14:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you for doing this. It's pretty damned cool, one day i'll have to try and do the same.  3) The Baby Seal Club at Camp Why Bother. Tucked away 6:45 and Idon'tknow3rdbase! we had pillow ""clubs"" shaped like baby seals and we beat each other with baby seal clubs (think thunder dome meets cute pillow fight) and then when we finished we went over to the bar and had a non-alcoholic beer... i know, Why Bother?!  2) In order to make BRC a better place i'm going to bring a Virgin whose energy is super infectious and let her mind be blown all over Playa. I'll also be helping with one of the local midway projects, but as cool as that might be, I feel bringing this young woman is going to be like Leeloo saving the world. Me, i'm going to experience all the random cool stuff that goes on out there. Knife throwing, Capoeira, Samba, Rope Bondage at Asian Fetish Camp, and I'll probably check out the show that Ashram Galactica puts on... and I will definitely be stopping by the FOAM camp, going try to find the bijou theater this year. This might be my first year riding an art car. And i'm going to ring that damned bell when i get in, they've denied me twice already.  1) I wasn't planning on going. After Caravansicle and Lost Hotel incident last year and bORG trying to spin everything like it was good to cater to the wealthy, i was pretty upset with everything. I figured if they won't stand by their own principles and ask JT to step down, why should I patronize their event. Then JT stepped down, and I found out Marco Cochran was going to be bringing out the last of his big metal women sculptures (which i'm a big fan of)... So i decided, that was good enough for me. Time to get in step... a few months late. We'll see if i hear from them. Already have the OMG marked on my calendar, i will be there one way or another.  4)  Orangutan Baby  6) This will be my 3rd year. my second year i spend way too much on providing my camp with a chill space that was too big (3 Costcos), a large two person shower, pump sprayers for pressurized showers, tried building a evapotron, set up lighting for the camp, brought the stove, and provided the kitchen... I almost feel like i built camp, and almost all of it was paid for by me. It cost me a few thousand... not a sob story, more so, i know what it costs. In prep for this year, I'll be ordering missing parts for my costco tomorrow, taking my car in for inspection the week after, getting myself inspected, brownies for sharing, libations for sharing, buying Apple Fritters for breakfast because apple fritters are fucking awesome, I plan to downsize tremendously this year, i want to be able to see out of my rear window so i don't bend my playa bike around another new Hyundai.  5) I'll find it, I'll be there, might have pants on."

I'm working on it, the tricky part is delegating to the right people to make things happen, and getting people to come back year after year that are excited about it.  Camp Why Bother was an idea i came up with after making a new years resolution not to drink until i have abs that i can see... I'm really hoping that i'll allow myself to drink by the time BM rolls around.  Then I just smushed the two ideas together. we'll see how it goes. I'll keep the group posted."

BurningMan,3cn1rm,breefield,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:06:41 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I'm Elly. I'm going on my seventh year of being in school, with multiple major changes behind me. Needless to say every August I'm stuck in class, wishing I was a good enough student to be able to skip the first week of school and still do well. This semester, I was messing around with my class schedule and did something kinda crazy and signed up for a full load of online classes. Suddenly I started picturing myself free to take glorious adventures and study at my own pace. I also had amazing epiphany that I have the opportunity to attend Burning Man. Of course by this time tickets had already gone on sale, and the low income application deadline had come and gone. So here I am! Perusing my options. I'm excited.   I'd like to say I have some amazing talent that I can wow others with, mostly sword swallowing, but truly I find that when I'm traveling or out and about my best skill is listening to people. I have a natural gravitation to others who are in distress, and if I see someone having a bad time I can at least say that I always offer to lend an ear if it helps at all. Compassion and patience is definitely an asset in the middle of chaos.  The ultimate art piece would be a huge fish tank that you could plug headphones into and listen to ocean jams. It would be stocked with hundreds of glittery battery powered fish that would swim to the beat of the music. I'm suddenly really into this idea and want it in my house.  D'AW       I'm really excited to get involved in the Reddit burning man community! I usually don't post because I prefer in person interaction, but I'm willing to be a little more outgoing virtually.  I'm really lucky to live here in Reno, which means nearly every one of my friends goes to or has been to burning man. I have a TON of resources which save me a lot of money. I also backpack and camp out in the Black Rock Desert year round, so I'm pretty stocked up on survival gear for heading out. My closest friends are driving a few campers out there; I honestly won't be taking up any extra space than they already are.  P.S. THIS IS ULTRA COOL. Whatever your resource, it must feel really cool to give this awesome opportunity to someone! I work for a radio station and get to do a lot of giveaways of concerts etc. when there is a surplus, and I understand the frustration when people get greedy. I hope you find someone who really deserves it!"
BurningMan,3cn1rm,sparr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:55:10 2015 UTC,"1). I don't have a ticket because I didn't think I would be going. But my relationship status has changed and now I do not have the obstacle(s) in my way any longer. No sob story, it's actually quite a relief.   2). The way I will make BRC better is actually more of a slow game. I will obviously touch everyone, not inappropriately but on a personal connection kind of way. However, in the years to come my small camp will become larger and more exciting. This year we are planning on setting up a happy hour bar for everyone to come and enjoy and I will be bringing my sound equipment and will play some groovy beats for all that come and enjoy. Also I'm a beautiful man so people can stare in wonder and amazement.   3). The art that wasn't there but should have been...easy. A giant strand of DNA. The DNA strands will be made up of even smaller strands. It will continue until the strands are too small to be made. It represents mankind being each small in our own right but together we all make up a big and beautiful picture.   4). That's the cutest baby animal. His name is Charlie Marshall Big-Dick Winley. He's a Great Dane puppy and he lives with me.   https://www.facebook.com/scott.j.wike/posts/10100726421856679:0  5). Obviously. I'm a long time lurker and very rare to post. This is an exception.   6). We (Camp Rascal) have set up a bank of rascal and have been depositing funds so we can get camp in order. We have 2 yurts and 2 car ports for communal areas. I've been building a sound dampening box for the generator to keep our sound bumping throughout happy hour...I'm actually quite proud of it because it is going to look like a creepy spider of sorts. Personally I've been going to various thrift stores to get my outfit game strong. Obvious camping gear and of course reading up on newbies guides where I can. Oh, and my time off got approved."

My friends don't have any more :sniff:. And craigslist has nothing but wanted ads :sob:. I'm afraid I won't get a ticket :cry:cry:cry:  [5 minutes later]  2) Well, I'm going to be a willing participant and good citizen of BRC. Aside from being with all you lovely people making the best of things, I've got a few things up my sleeve.  I'll be giving folks a chance to ride around on my tall bike, forwards or backwards. I'll be juggling some clubs and torches! I'll be gifting some custom 3d printed memorabilia. I'll be hauling you and your shit around on my bike trailer cause i can carry some weight. I'll also be volunteering as a greeter so I can hug everyone as they come in. Shit I'm making quite a list here, and I'm still figuring out more plans.  3) An empty unused dumpster.

Sometime late last year, something within me decided I'm going this year and here we go! I've got the time off and the folks to go with! I'll be renting a truck a camp mate. We are going to try and bring as much infrastructure, bikes, food, and water as we can so others can fly in and take a bus. We already have the vehicle pass, so I'll have to give yours away (maybe reddit style?). Between work and circus training, I'm going to be finishing off burning projects and prep.

BurningMan,3cn1rm,ObscuredReasoning,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:34:01 2015 UTC,"1)  Burning Man wasn't on my radar when the main sale happened.  2 months ago a friend suggested I go with her and her friend who already had a ticket.  Thus the search for a ticket continues.  2) This will be my FIRST Burning Man experience along with my 2 friends.  I'll be bringing an opening mind and focusing on energy in the moment.  And beyond that touchy feely bullshit I'm hoping to use my expert knowledge of outdoor living to spread some comfort around.  Simple things like always having chapstick to give out or having a well stocked first kit on hand.  Backups for backups, that's how I roll.  I also have this idea in my head that I want to say 'no' to as few things as possible while I'm there.  Oh and my dashing good looks, I always bring those along.  3)  I'm not sure what was on the Playa last year.  I do however have a dream of an interactive art installation. A climbing wall, maybe 15'x15' at a slight angle painted white.  The idea would be to climb to a spot with markers and create your mini work for however long you can hold on.  The artwork would be very quick and fleeting as most people wouldn't be able to hang for long enough create a masterful work.  However by the end of the week the piece as a whole would come together.  4) BabyPika  5) Of course I'd like to come meet like minded people!  You can also find me hanging around the Dragon Ass Camp because they are pretty rad folks.  6) By trade I work in the outdoor industry.  I've slept on mountains in subzero temps, in blowing deserts, and humid jungles.  I own too much equipment, seriously who needs 4 tents?  My knowledge of surviving comfortably outdoors is thorough to say the least.  Additionally, I have many burner friends who have willing offered shade structures and other essential items.  I won't end up sunburned, dehydrated with blisters on my lips crying for someone to rub lotion on my wounds. Promise."

Praying for OMG and willing to donate as much time as needed to get to the playa.   2) I volunteer at the box office and my husband provides medical support so do our part of bettering the BM community. Off playa we try to take part in as much BM-related things as possible and LOVE the bM community. Last year we also instituted the HUG brigade and spent countless hours pooperatzi'ing - bringing joy to as many fellow burners as possible.   3) I want to see a giant squid art car floating around the playa that has lenticels that disperse fruit by the foots. I love fruit by the foot!  4) Pug puppies - say no more! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pPR7vk-e3Y  5) DONE! I'll do whatever  6) Having burned before, we have a great setup as a part of the Colorado Squids Camp but this year we are upping our shade structure with a huge monkey hut, painting our biked copper and relighting to be the best beacon for our crew and as a graphic designer, I'm designing custom BM 2015 stickers to give out as gifts to the wonderful burners we meet!

BurningMan,3cn1rm,ObscuredReasoning,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:18:07 2015 UTC,"1). I was there right at noon, refreshing like a mad man, and like so many of us, I sat in line, online, only to think I had reserved a ticket when in fact they had sold out. Pardon my run on sentence, but ever since then I've stopped caring about small things like proper grammer...and spelling.    2) Ok, so even though I don't have a ticket, I'm going to BM this year. I don't know how I'm getting my ticket yet, but I'm putting it out there in the universe and I have faith that the playa will provide. Maybe this post is how I get my magical ticket, maybe not. Why does this matter? My camp, the camp I am mayor of, was just approved yesterday. 4:45 and Geek is where you'll find the Heart of the Galaxy at this years burn. Complete with a Galaxy Dome with awesome UV painted galaxies, stars, planets, and moons inside. We also will have a Galaxy bar and a couple of awesome art features. This is how I am going to make BRC a better place. I'm committed to making this happen even without a ticket in hand because no matter what I'm getting to BRC this year, hopefully with your help!    3)  I'm waiting to see the horse sized duck running around the playa which opens up its belly to release 100 duck sized horses. Will 2015 be the year I see this? Time will tell...  4) My spirit animal, in baby form, accurately representing how I feel leading this camp without a ticket yet: http://photoity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cutest-Baby-Elephant.jpg 5) I will definitely go to the meeting! When and where?  6) I went last year for the first time and survived. I came well prepared due to the guidance of many burner friends. Now it's my turn to help others. My camp will be home to at least 10-15 virgins (camp will be no bigger than 30) and I'm helping them all plan and prepare. With the help of some friends, we have this amazing spreadsheet which you all should share with others! Hell, it might even remind you of something you may be forgetting. I managed all costs last year and will be doing so again this year. BM is expensive and I'm ensuring everyone is aware of the costs and that our camp is properly budgeted. I'm also reusing some supplies from last year (hello yurt and swamp cooler!)    Welp that about does it. I hope to receive your most gracious gift of a free ticket but if I don't, I'm sure it will be going to someone who well deserves it. And no matter what you do, make sure to stop by 4:45 and Geek and say hello to the aliens running around at the Heart of the Galaxy!"
BurningMan,3cn1rm,whatsupallday,0,Fri Jul 10 04:48:25 2015 UTC,"I don't have a ticket because I decided in the pits of winter that I'd sign up, get a ticket and then surprise my burner pals that I would be going for the first time.  Hindsight's 20/20 m'right? I plan on being completely overwhelmed with the majesty of art and people when I'm not passed out on my bedroll from running around, wide eyed having fun.  I want to stay up riding around the playa meeting people, drink cheap beer, sleep in and wake to a jug of cold brew coffee that after the fourth day is starting to get questionable.  If I go this year I'm also going to be volunteering with the Lamplighters!  The camp concept is awesome and the crew that I know are the best! A towering steel kinetic mechanotron decked out in flames, LEDs, occasional shouts of ""Ignore me!"" over loudspeakers.  And it will be decorated with legalese claiming it owns the airspace above it and all planes must give it a 5000' berth.

I have been preparing over the spring and summer for surviving on the Playa and any other extreme camping (Just did three days in Eastern Wa, triple digits and we didn't have to stop for anything but gas, we had it all in the car!)  I'm going to make sure to bring everything I need, things I can fit in that will help others and stuff for the camp.  If I can't make it by myself then I have no business being there, that's everything in life."

BurningMan,3cn1rm,sillybear25,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:59:01 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Thank you.
BurningMan,3cn1rm,ApesInSpace,-1,Thu Jul 9 20:01:17 2015 UTC,"1) One of my lovers doesn't have a ticket yet, partly because she thought they were easier to get.  She hasn't been in 7 years or so, but she used to camp with Heebees Healers (she's a massage therapist).  My theme camp had some extra tickets, but apparently, I didn't speak up fast enough and the last one got given to that guy no one really likes before I could jump on it.  2) I camp with Captain Pump's Raiders.  We're running the Playa's only gaming convention.  I'm running a classic World of Darkness game (Vampires, Warewolves, Mages, Changelings, etc) that takes place AT Burning Man.  My lover (who the ticket is for) is a massage therapist and she loves quick little games like Cards Against Humanity, Dixit and Smashup.  If she makes it, I imagine she'll be offering both massages and impulse gaming in our shade structure.  3) Our theme camp originally came together as if a bunch of Battletech Mercs were going to Blackrock City.  I even wrote a song about our company fighting off a clan invasion of the playa.  We're nerds, OK?  We run a gaming con at Burn!  For a while now, I've wanted to build a giant wooden battlemech and set it on fire on Thursday.  4) I've always thought this pair was adorable.  They're still friends and do a show together at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park.  Here they are all grown up.  5) I've been to the reddit meetup before.  I give away water.  I kept refilling /u/theseekerofbacon's mist cannon in 2013. I'll drag my massage therapist along this year and make her give massages.  6) I'm with a camp who's camp motto is ""We Don't Suck!""  I bring tons of extra water every year to give away.  Plus, the extra water in the van and reflective insulation on the outside keeps it nice and cool during the day and warm at night.  If my lover makes it, she'll be in my big van with me, full of supplies and a bed to sleep in."
BurningMan,3cn1rm,sillybear25,4,Thu Jul 9 22:11:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but I prefer people to ask for themselves. It feels weird to give you a gift so you can give someone a gift."

BurningMan,3cn1rm,ychirea1,-1,Thu Jul 9 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"1) I didn't get lucky in the main sale. Having moved to a new city recently, I don't have the same network to draw on for spare tickets that I might have in previous years. Later, at a local town hall for a regional burn, there was a ticket being given away. Everyone put their names in a hat. I folded my name in a way that made it more likely to be drawn. Then I got picked to draw the name from the hat, and accidentally drew my own name. Rather than have the whole room think I was a cheater, I told them what happened and drew another name. So close! Now I'm just reaching out to old and new friends alike, and waiting for the OMG sale.  2) I'll be bringing a lot of rope to gift to people in the form of shibari outfits. Along with my camp, we'll be bringing a lounge space and a light show.  3) I loved the one where each passer by stood in for one piece of a Rube Goldberg machine and once enough people were in place, the golf ball could eventually make the bell ring!  4) https://www.flickr.com/photos/bartdubelaar/462583446  5) Consider it pinkie-sworn. I've gotten some good advice from some folks here, and would love to thank them in person.  6) As I'm unpacking from a couple of regional burns recently I've been setting aside the gear that's going to get me through BM. I've coordinated with campmates for sharing a yurt for sleeping. I'll be stopping in Salt Lake City to make a monkey hut to go over part of our tent area. I'm driving out and already have a van, so transport for my person and gear is all sorted out. Except for gas, food, water, and a ticket, I think I've got everything I need already."
BurningMan,3cqc10,nimsu,7,Thu Jul 9 22:42:27 2015 UTC,"So, I built a figjam cooler last year. I can hardly tell the difference between my balls and a ball-peen hammer. I am clueless, but with help from Figjam's thread on Eplaya, this sub, and my local burner community, I managed to put together my pretty little Janky Bucket. I named him Janky Bucket, because I needlessly personify things.  Anyway, I had a big ass Kodiak tent with no shade over it... not ideal, but I would run my swamp cooler in, and holy shit, it was the most comfortable trip to Burning Man I've ever had. I legitimately could sleep in until 4pm or 5pm with it running, only re-filling it with ice/water when I'd get up to go to the bathroom. That thing blew colder than anything I've ever felt, and I have nearly no idea how. I assume voodoo magic.  Admittedly, I have no experience with that cooler you linked. However, I do have experience in freezing my balls off with a homemade home-depot-bucket based cooler. The figjam cooler takes nearly no power, not a lot of water, can be customized to your liking (timer switch? float switch? STICKERS!?), and it is tried and true and works fantastically.   I've answered none of your questions. Sorry!"
BurningMan,3cqc10,Rotationation,4,Thu Jul 9 23:12:10 2015 UTC,"The ""Figjam cooler"" is the tried and true method. It's named after a poster on ePlaya. Here is the original thread he started about the design. There are now 107 pages of discussion...   https://eplaya.burningman.com/viewtopic.php?f=280&t=33842  Also a search of this sub (as is suggested in the submission text you're supposed to read before starting a new thread) returns a bunch of results.   https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/search?q=Swamp+cooler&restrict_sr=on"
BurningMan,3cqc10,Jovankat,2,Thu Jul 9 22:57:19 2015 UTC,"Ya, the figjam cooler is a better design for the playa. The problem with this one, is it is meant to just sit in a room. It will not pump air into your tent, it will just make it cool until the humidity rises then it'll turn it into a swamp.  You want something you can duct, which will provide ventilation and cool air. Check out the thread /u/Jovankat posted. It isn't expensive at all to make, and you'll have the joy of having made it yourself."
BurningMan,3cqc10,flickerkuu,2,Thu Jul 9 23:09:43 2015 UTC,"I third the figjam design. I used a recycle bin version, ran it on DC power, was cool the entire burn.  I was also gifted 2 consumer models from some foreign neighbors at the burn. One of them had to be fixed. They work ok. You'll waste a lot of electricity running a generator just for a glorified fan like this.   Seriously you'll get more out of a cold hankerchief tied around your neck."
BurningMan,3cqc10,dovewrangler,2,Thu Jul 9 23:14:54 2015 UTC,thanks. was curious how a consumer model would do.
BurningMan,3cqc10,prowlerSB,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:24:52 2015 UTC,"I've used a consumer swamp cooler for a few years. Its not going to be like A/C, but the breeze will be nice, especially if it has a rotation feature. Pro tip, use the melted water from your cooler to fill it. Cooler water = cooler breeze. If you fill it with fresh water from a jug that has been sitting in ambient temp, one- you are wasting good water, and two- the water is already warm. Kinda useless. Another thing I did with mine was to filter my grey water (cheese cloth and a colander) into an empty cooler, with a block of ice. I filled my swamp cooler with that- now you have less grey water to deal with. Might waste a block of ice, but not having grey water to evap was nice. IMHO BM isn't that unbearable, although I come from Phoenix. The playa isn't as hot as it is here. A spray bottle and a fan is fine, shade is great. Sounds like you'll do fine."

I heard that there were only 500 fortunate souls that got to go and I'm not sure if I've never seen a more beautiful venue (truly majestic), support staff, crowd or shared experience. Because of the limited size, it was very intimate; perfect for getting to know people and forming new friendships. During the day it took on a fairytale quality reminiscent of Ferngully on DMT. During the night, we were able to see the Milky Way, shooting stars, etc. and all the camps went for broke. The dance parties at fucking Unicorns we my favorite - day and night. Lots of people going through transformations / catharsis in a loving and safe environment. Overall, it was one of the most magical events I've been to in 20+ years of ecstatic events. I was so fortunate to have gone considering the thousands who were not able to. My favorite names for the event were ""Nopogaea"" and ""Apologaea"" :) Special mention to mLe and her man for opening up Arapahoe Valley Ranch to make it possible.

BurningMan,3coxre,pacificmint,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:49:18 2015 UTC,"In theory, if you have a physical ticket, you can cancel the ticket (declare it lost) and then you can get a ticket via will call. That disabled ticket will then scan as cancelled, and the person trying to use it to get in will be denied entry. Sometimes tickets are thrown out or lost. So there are ways of dealing with this.  As for will call....  If you need extra proof that you should be receiving the ticket, you can have homeboy do the following: - print a scan of his id showing his name and signature - use a hand written letter (email sometimes suffices) with the following information:   Seller's Full Name (and/or name they used to buy the ticket) Sellers Contact Info (email, phone, address, MUST Match account) Order Number Purchaser's Name Exactly what is being transferred to the purchaser   Here's a great example:    ""Hi there lovely Box Office Staff. My name is [SELLER NAME], and I am transferring my ticket to  [PURCHASER NAME]. My order number was  [ORDER NUMBER], and it is for 1 ticket and 1 parking pass.  Here is my contact/account info:  [SELLER'S INFO]. You box office peoples are the nicest, sparkliest, most lovely people, and you're doing a great job. I really appreciate all the work you're dealing with, sorting everyone out, and if I was there, I'd give you a giant bear hug and bacon.  Love you always,  [SELLER NAME]   I guarantee you will get really great treatment if you are nice to the box office staff, and acknowledge that this is a tricky transaction."
BurningMan,3coxre,Cottontail_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:13:09 2015 UTC,"This is solid advice for sure but it's still not enough as there are NO guarantees with Will Call Transfers.   I am a veteran of Burning Man and have gone since 1998. I'd not gone since early 2000 and decided to go last year. I was scammed in a Will Call Transfer and the bottom line is that even when you follow all of the terrific suggestions the seller can do the same thing to many people.   This is what happened with me. The seller transferred the tickets to me and sent screenshots of my name as the owner and I even called TicketFly to verify. So the transfer is reversible on the scammers end and last year I discovered he'd scammed at least 5 people this way.   I had been mindful to keep a serious paper trail and showed the Box Office folks the emails and paperwork and they did allow me to buy a Replacement Ticket. But that took some doing.

And you're totally right, I would avoid transferring will call tickets as much as I possibly could.   Also, super fortunate that box office was able to find a ticket for you. I'm guessing that that's a really rare occurrence.   My experience with them is that they want to get everyone in, and the more that I could do to help them, the better they helped me. They're dehydrated and beat too, and those lines are wicked long. As much as it sucks to stand in line for 6 hours, they gotta deal with everyone, and that's gotta be a drag if everyone is cranky with them.   C'est la vie."

As long as you're prepared and not going to be a burden on others, there's not really any reason not to if you can't find a group.  However if it is a misunderstanding about how things work out there, you NEED to read the survival guide right away.  If it's more a case of just not wanting to go alone search facebook or google for local burner groups. For me I'd look up ""Los Angeles burners."" There's always a community near by and they might be your best chance of finding a solid crew.  Joining at a distance can work out, but I'd always like to meet people and get to know them a bit before committing to a week in harsh, stressful conditions around them.

BurningMan,3cm2xj,prelimar,4,Thu Jul 9 02:43:26 2015 UTC,"Having just read through the entire document actually quite a lot of the concerns seem totally valid, but they also wouldn't take much effort from BMorg to address.  Some of them are down to simple lack of organisation or poor procedures. Things like lack of incident reporting, lack of org charts, and lack of accurate population counts should all be easily solved.  Several are directly relating to either DMV not enforcing art car licensing regulations, or art car operators breaking the rules around fuel storage and where they're driving.   Some of them are just suggestions for how things could be a lot safer... ie, post medical staff near major events (including 'raves') or at the airport in case of an incident.   The one about the Sandmen is interesting as it's BLM complaining that the sandmen just released people back into the crowd after they tried to break the perimeter rather than detaining them... but the complaint seems to almost be that they're unhappy the sandmen aren't LEO's so can't physically restrain or detain people.   And some of them are a bit harder to handle... e.g, Someone needs to pay for highway 34 needs to be rebuilt.  On the whole there really isn't anything massively absurd in there (no demands for ice-cream at least)... I get the feeling that we might be making this out to be a much bigger deal than it really is... chances are it won't take them long to reach agreement on most of the stuff in here.... It's not like BLM are actually saying all of these items need to be 100% solved for 2015... They're just complaining that the BMorg haven't responded at all to most of the points."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,gargoylenz,6,Thu Jul 9 09:01:33 2015 UTC,Details on the 20 items listed at:   http://www.scribd.com/doc/270954881/BRC-Letter-March-12-2015-Enclosure-Safety-Health-Security
BurningMan,3cm2xj,mystikmike,6,Wed Jul 8 23:45:16 2015 UTC,"For those who are time/ effort challenged, the 20 items are:   The BRC Medical program is disorganized. BRC Fire, Rescue and Hazmat programs need to be improved. The response to last year's fatality was dis-organized and unprofessional. There needs to be better contingency planning for off-site traffic when stuff like last year's rain-closure happens. Public safety issues with both the Man and Embrace burns. Security/ Safety/ Legal authority (primarily regarding the Sandmen) during burns. Sanitation management (poop moop, sanitation pumping and hand sanitizer). The Early Arrival program is getting out of control. D-Lot Design and Management needs to be improved. Fuel Storage Management needs to be improved. (Forward) Deployment of Medical Staff needs to be improved. Need Emergency Vehicles at BR Airport. Highway 34 can't handle the current load and needs to be re-built. BRC needs to be able to accurately report the current population of the city to BLM at any time. BLM needs a detailed Org Chart 45 days before the event. BRC needs a detailed event management program description in their Plan of Operations. BRC needs to develop a detailed participant evacuation plan. BRC needs to report ""significant incidents"" immediately to BLM. Art Cars are being operated dangerously and this needs to be fixed. Participants are using ""illicit narcotics""."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,mans0n2,5,Thu Jul 9 05:39:04 2015 UTC,"id say thats a rather friendly summation.  if you want to know about this stuff, read the entire document.. theres all kinds of useful information that if you care about this event should be important to you.  ..upon reading the document id say their problem at the BLM isnt so much that people ""are using illicit narcotics"".... but that responding to medical incidents related to their use sucks up resources/vehicles which (as noted in other sections of the document) are already dwindling.  if some guy wigging out because he took too much of something means that there's nobody able to adequately respond to someone who just had their arm ripped off by an art car ......thats a perfectly valid concern in my mind."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,ShaggySkier,2,Thu Jul 9 06:25:37 2015 UTC,Anyone have a copy of this that isn't behind a mandatory app download wall?
BurningMan,3cm2xj,lshiva,2,Thu Jul 9 08:11:38 2015 UTC,The complaint about Early Arrival seems egregious to me.  Somehow it's a problem that people getting in early to perform vital services or build art aren't working like slaves 100% of the time and have time to ride bikes and listen to music.  Apparently after you finish your work for the day you're just supposed to sit quietly in your tent or something.
BurningMan,3cm2xj,pacificmint,3,Thu Jul 9 12:57:49 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, the numbers of EA passes have gone up dramatically over the last few years. The first time I got EA, the city was completely sparse on Friday pre event. I was almost alone on my city block, and that was on B or C street. They used to be super stingy with EA passes.  Then they got more liberal with the passes by the year. The city got fuller a little earlier every year. One year we looked at statistics, and it was basically that 25% of the city were there before opening. More people are getting early access, and they are getting it earlier than they used to.  Now, I don't have a problem with that, but apparently the BLM does. I suppose they feel that if the number of attendees is higher earlier on, they have to ramp their presence earlier as well."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,lshiva,4,Thu Jul 9 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"I've been noticing the effect during the week as well. Things didn't used to really get going until Wednesday or Thursday. Now many big projects are up and running right at the start of the week. It's an impressive change, but it obviously can't happen without lots of extra bodies there earlier in the week.   It probably also has a non negligible effect on traffic entering the event. Pulling  10+ thousand people out of that initial entrance rush has to do good things for the road capacity."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,pacificmint,4,Thu Jul 9 19:54:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, everything has become more front loaded. The first year I went, the number of participant arriving every day was about the same. In other words, the event ramped up linearly from Mon to Fri.  Now Monday night is as busy as Friday used to be. Traffic also shows that, with a huge chunk of the population arriving on Sun and Mon."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,Jovankat,2,Thu Jul 9 20:21:22 2015 UTC,I've heard several people talk about EA passes being limited as much as they are (they're still pretty sort after) is because the BLM charges BM based on how many people are on playa how early before the burn. Now this is just other random folk on the Internet so I have no idea how true it is but yeah... That is a thing I have heard. I'd be keen to know if it's true.
BurningMan,3cm2xj,pacificmint,3,Thu Jul 9 23:08:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm pretty sure that's correct. I am not positive on the exact details, but I think it's basically a fee per day per person. The more people are out early, the more fees they pay.  It seemed that that was a big driver to keep the numbers down. Yet at some point the Org definitely eased up on it (at least somewhat). They might have made a different arrangement with the BLM, or they might have simply had the cash to pay for it.  At the time it sounded like they did it because it helped ease ingress traffic, as well as to make sure that things are up and running. Used to be that many teams were working on their project till Wed or Thur before it was done. Heck, the first couple of years I went even the Temple was never open on Monday. If I recall correctly, at some point, maybe seven or eight years ago, the Org really started pushing to have things open on Monday."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,noiszen,0,Thu Jul 9 23:30:08 2015 UTC,"BLM and therefore the org doesn't want a lot of vehicles/camping near the temple while the event is open, which creates tension because temple crew may not be done until they are done. Last year we finished Tuesday 9pm, and we had to rush to hit that. Personally I feel that was awful, it creates an unsafe situation where people are stressed and not always working safely. There were a couple serious injuries on temple crew. Given that temple is all volunteer (well, with some DPW assistance especially from heavy), the org should back off and let us do our thing.  (Last year they gave us on-playa permits but I didn't get one because I was running errands, I could have been ticketed.)  Edit: personally I found it hilarious that we were working and people started riding up and trying to get into the work zone (thank you guardians for perimeter). Tourists! We even had a wedding show up, they did their thing anyway outside the fence. Some of the gawkers got a clue and offered to help, bless them."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,iotatron,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:30:18 2015 UTC,"It doesn't bother in the slightest that people have fun during early entrance, but damn, when I finish my work for the day I just want to go eat and pass out."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,mans0n2,2,Thu Jul 9 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"so a source inside burning man released documents to kick up a big fuss in the media about permit stuff about ice cream.........  and meanwhile the burning man people could only find the time to respond to 35% of the health/safety concerns ?  color me shocked!  hey! at least they got burners on their side! cuz theyre out there making sure its not too expensive.  ....yeah, sure.... they might not have a response to how theyll deal with the storage of fuel in a tent city which happens to be a preserved natural environment....... but at least we know we wont be paying extra for ice cream!  thanks BRC! always got your priorities in the right place."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,FormerlyKraft,2,Thu Jul 9 05:08:06 2015 UTC,"Now lists like this one are why I'm not throwing/beingresponsible for local burns anymore. That's a lot of bureaucracy to cut through in order to have a party. Obviously there's a smaller amount for a 2000 person event than the big burn, but doing that many plans/reports/organizational documents (which yes, are required in some areas not controlled by the BLM) is a huge effort that happens behind the scenes and is completely unthanked, and unpaid. No mas for me.   I think this increase in bureaucracy might be why most regionals cap attendance pretty low. if you keep the event small enough, it doesn't trigger this kind of huge effort. hmmm."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,mystikmike,2,Thu Jul 9 15:58:15 2015 UTC,"might be why most regionals cap attendance pretty low   and may be part of the reason the Org is trying to amp up the regionals as an extension of the main event.  Spreading the BM ethos into communities is good all by itself, but it's also an admission that we can't keep expanding the BRC event forever.  Sooner or later (sounds like now) the gummint will impose the kinds of structure that are anathema to many burners."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,20yearsofboredom,2,Thu Jul 9 16:22:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing this!  It seems that only three of those points (#2, #7, #10) are vaguely related to what BLM is supposed to be protecting – public land. Other items mostly try to instantiate more police-like control under the pretext of ""public safety"".  Safety is a holy cow of the mainstream Western culture (we all know how happily people exchange their privacy for even an illusion of safety), however not so much for most of the burners. To have fun you often need to do things that are a little unsafe. If you prefer safety, you probably should not spend a week in a desert setting stuff on fire surrounded by intoxicated people.  Does not BLM exceed its authority in this case? Should public safety be their concern? Can we remind them to focus on the land? Is there any government body in the US that supervises BLM where we can complain?"
BurningMan,3cm2xj,mans0n2,4,Thu Jul 9 08:05:51 2015 UTC,"i can understand where people get some anti-BLM sentiment from.  but ensuring the permit holder provides a safe environment for the 70,000+ participants (who cannot organize the health and safety of such a crowd on their own behalf) totally seems within the scope of their duties.  the BLM has this to say about SRPs in one region:  from the 'introduction'   Objectives of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Special Recreation Permit (SRP) system are to satisfy recreational demand within allowable use levels in an equitable, safe, and enjoyable manner while minimizing adverse impacts and user conflicts.    from the 'why do i need one' section   A SRP must be obtained for commercial use including vending associated with recreational use, competitive use, and if the BLM determines that it is necessary, based on planning decisions, resources concerns, potential users conflicts, or public health and safety.   from the 'what information must be provided' section   SRP applicants are required to submit supplemental information related to the proposed activity...  This information is a written explanation of the proposed activity and how the permittee will manage the activity. The plan will include Health, Safety, First Aid, and Medical information.   from the 'how will you decide if i get a permit' section   BLM has discretion over whether to issue a SRP. The decision is based on the following factors to the extent that they are relevant: (a) conformance with laws and land use plans, (b) public safety, (c) conflicts with other users, (d) resource protection, (e) the public interest served, (f) whether in the past the applicant complied with the terms of a permit.   from the 'will you cancel my permit' section   BLM may amend, suspend, or cancel a SRP if necessary to protect public health, public safety, or the environment.    whether or not you personally feel its their role to assure that certain health and safety protections are being minded when permitting use of public lands.... they certainly feel it is and let people know this when they give out documentation to potential users of the land (and this health and safety stuff has been signed off on by burning man for the entirety of this century)  ..If you want to complain, go for it. But I doubt you'll be getting much traction.  source: http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/ca/pdf/caso/publications.Par.23962.File.dat/SpecialRecreationPermit.pdf"
BurningMan,3cm2xj,20yearsofboredom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:32:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply. I am not very knowledgable with regard to how US government works, and the links you posted have been very useful.  So if I am reading this correctly, because BLM has a responsibility to protect public land, they get to make up the rules regulating people's behaviour on that land, and such rules must not necessarily be directed towards protecting the land, is that correct?  Is this something that is generally considered a good thing by American people? I would be very concerned if an agency that declared its mission as ""sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations"" was seemingly extending its authority far beyond that."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,mans0n2,2,Thu Jul 9 13:27:25 2015 UTC,"Does not BLM exceed its authority in this case?

I fit this description. It's a combination of being from a country that is SUPER safety conscious to the point of being a bit of a nanny state, just generally being a cautious kinda person who appreciates rules and order and working in an industry that marries risky work and the general public and thus has to be VERY safety conscious.  It's totally possible for me to have a good time at Burning Man though. I just don't do the crazy shit myself.    Just because ""safety third"" is a thing doesn't mean folks who aren't super comfortable with it can't be burners."
BurningMan,3cm2xj,iotatron,3,Thu Jul 9 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"Everyone has their own tolerance for risk, and everyone thinks any other tolerance level is either insanely dangerous or needlessly paranoid.

Seems this is a negotiation list to me. In large permits, there is often an ongoing negotiation between the regulators (in this case the BLM), and the permittee (Org). For Dam permits under FERC, there's a laundry list of concerns and items to be addressed, and how they get addressed (and/or who gets paaaaaid for 'impacts') is part of a lengthy study and negotiation process. I wouldn't be surprised at all, if this is what is going on here."

A bit dirtier than the traffic account, but interesting for comparison.  I wonder how they determine their estimates for announcement. The user data shows a much bigger penalty if you stay for temple burn (~3h), where these estimates have it in the 1.5h range. This data also shows more of a slow build over the day on Sunday prior to temple burn, where mine only had a major mid-day surge in 2013 (when there were widespread warnings of a big rain storm, so everyone tried to get out early)."

Fuck it.  here are the bullet points:  sub 2:  antiquated/insufficient extrication capabilities  sub 3: disorganized and unprofessional medical response  sub 4: lack of contingency planning (transportation re: rain closure)  sub 5: man support fuckups and concerns about being able to restrain the crowd until it fell  sub 6: sandmen, legality and duties of  sub 7: sanitation management inc. human waste at ""mobile rave sites"", hand sanitizer, etc  sub 8: Early arrival participants not engaged in the purpose of early arrival ticket allocations.

BurningMan,3clo0g,reasonweb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:25:29 2015 UTC,sub 8: Early arrival participants not engaged in the purpose of early arrival ticket allocations.    How do people have time to run around and party when they're EA? We were building the entire time w/ the exception of eating and periodically collapsing in a chair to rest.
BurningMan,3clo0g,Jovankat,2,Thu Jul 9 01:58:07 2015 UTC,It gets pretty difficult to work once the sun goes down but it's not late enough to sleep.
BurningMan,3clo0g,lshiva,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"If you're working a shift at Gate you're only working for 6-8 hours a day. I'm guessing it's similar for other departments like Rangers and Medical as well. That leaves plenty of time for the offense of riding bikes and listening to music.   And even if you're working hard getting shit done from the minutes you wake up until you collapse into your sleeping bag, are you telling me you never hopped on a bike to hit the blue room, buy ice, or meet up with a coworker on your project?  Complaining about Burners having a good time in the midst of hard work just seems like someone going out of their way to complain."
BurningMan,3clo0g,notseanmcbride,7,Thu Jul 9 15:06:33 2015 UTC,"Last year I spent some time standing out in front of my camp during EA, yelling at people to not have fun until Sunday 10am.     There were threats of reports and demerits.     I'm glad the government is finally addressing my concerns.  ETA: I'm hoping this year, early arrivals will wear only somber attire, drink alone in their living spaces and only play soothing reflective music.  They have a lot of work to do, and their minds should be on task."
BurningMan,3clo0g,reasonweb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:09:31 2015 UTC,"Note that I said 'party.' None of the things you listed fit into the category of 'run off and party.' And I will say that I've seen people out there go and just drink and dance instead instead of setting up like they were supposed to be doing. (Because I heard the complaints from their camp mates afterwards.)  Buying ice, hitting the porto's and discussing projects are not 'partying.'"
BurningMan,3clo0g,lshiva,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:50:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was focusing on the BLM complaint that listed riding bikes and playing music as questionable activities.   However, I don't see the problem with including a party with your other activities as long as you're sticking to your build plans. Certainly some people are going to fuck around, and they shouldn't be offered EA next year, but if you're getting your work done, what's wrong with taking some time to play?"
BurningMan,3clo0g,reasonweb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:52:37 2015 UTC,"My reply was also probably a bit biased based on the number of reports I've heard from other camps about their EA ppl running off and getting drunk and partying instead of doing the setup they're supposed to be doing.  I think the BLM is possibly over reacting on this one as how in the world can they tell what someone is doing. That being said, if there are any big parties going on, that's at the very least against what we're told we're allowed to do when we get EA passes.   I don't think there's anything wrong with grabbing a beer and relaxing to some music while you rest."
BurningMan,3clo0g,Jovankat,0,Thu Jul 9 22:03:42 2015 UTC,"Not everyone there early is building stuff though. Doing a 6 hour box office shift leaves plenty of time, and energy I'd imagine, to party. Last year I knew of at least two scheduled and planned EA parties before I even headed out there."

Barely any rises of poofy crunchy.. they existed but were shallow..  I had the luck of coming after several rains that week, but still, it was flat, barely curly if at all..   The storms had high winds and the playa was barely dusty at the time, which meant no white outs for me during my stay but it would heave up chunks only instead of dust. hurt like a bitch as usual..  we were camped on the city grounds from last year and it was really really good!!"
BurningMan,3cmm1x,SlowInFastOut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:51:51 2015 UTC,"I'll say though that I'd never lost so much camp structure in such a short time span.   Also, I've rarely used rebar..  but 12"" nails, and never had them pull up until now  (since '99)..   Most destruction didn't happen from lack of tie down, as much as it did from metal failure on the legs of shade and tents... as well as everything becoming a sail..  and making our tie down points work against the structures.. which is not new.. but damn.. it did well..  Odin was on our ass.   I almost want to reinforce the ratchet straps to open tubing on the supports to spread the load and the support along the legs...  shade structures had to stay very low too.  we rplaced the solid shade cloth with shade mesh which worked for a few days but then still caught the wind.     aluminet was solid.

BurningMan,3ckrxh,dovewrangler,3,Wed Jul 8 18:01:29 2015 UTC,I camped on the esplanade two years in a row near 9:00. We definitely had to be more aware of who was coming and going from camp. We were a sound camp so it was expected to have people wandering in and out at all hours. We were super vigilant about making sure shady characters weren't making there way into places they didn't belong.   Definitely adds some responsibility. We had a guy passed out so bad one morning we had to call the medics from the med tent and they took him away on a gurney. Just play it safe!   Playavision is a glorious thing though.

We were fortunate to have Rangers and/or ESD camping with us and a healthy support group of understanding folks. Upside: watching the Esplanade promenade is golden! Plan to have someone stay back in camp to keep an eye on the neighborhood during the Man burn, that's when the prowlers come out."

This guy came into our bar asking to be shocked with the taser, and I told him we didn't have a taser, we had a stun gun. He ignored me, he seemed like he might have been either not smart or permanently baked. So, I shocked him with my stun gun, and gave him some booze. Then he hung our bar for a while, and continued calling my stun gun ""taser"", I got to the point that I would correct him every time he would say ""taser"" by shocking him and repeating, ""stun gun"". It was good fun, and he was entertained.  I was biking around deep playa with some friends later that night and he saw me (from like 50 feet away) and shouted, ""Hey!

BurningMan,3cl1kw,sharpiefairy666,2,Thu Jul 9 23:52:21 2015 UTC,"Mine has a story behind it.  I camp with a group that fluctuates between about one and two dozen people and has historically been part of one of the larger villages.  During my second burn, a friend of mine had been feeling down for a few days and we thought it was just dehydration.  At one point one of his girlfriends shows back up at camp saying he collapsed in pain and was at Rampart.  We found out later that it was a giant kidney stone about three times the size of a normal one.  As soon as I heard, I helped ladyfriend take deep breaths and calm down.  I hopped on my bike, rode to Rampart.  He wasn't there.  Rode to the closest med tent to camp in case I'd hear wrong.  He wasn't there.  Rode back to Rampart.  Still wasn't there.  Found him at our friends' camp on the way back.  Told him to stay right there.  Biked to car while his girlfriend filled out medical exit/re-entry paperwork.  We loaded him in the car and I bombed it to Reno at top speed to make it to urgent care where we learned exactly how huge that damn thing was.  I offered to take him back to SF, but he called a friend who could pick him up the next morning.  We arranged for a room at a casino.  I got locked out of the room and both of them were dead to the world.  So I slept in car.  The next day, I got him to a spot where he could meet with his friend and drove me and his ladyfriend back to the Playa to find I'd been given a playa name in absentia.  So anyway, hi!  I'm ""Captain Responsibility"" and no, it's unexpectedly not ironic."

After a while someone showed me the Cinnabon hug (people join hands and circle the first person until you're wrapped up like a big cinnamon roll). I ended up giving that hug a million times. Also, I was wearing a bright red tutu, red combat boots, and a red tank-top. By the end of my shift I was given the name ""Cinnamon.""

BurningMan,3cmot4,Tim_Theory,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:28:06 2015 UTC,"This is the most banal question, I know, but everyone at BM every year keeps telling me of the amazing beverage holder they have. It allows for hot and warm drinks and keeps them hot or warm for like a week or something   I think it's called a thermos. Heh.  I've heard a few rave reviews of this thing, which is getting pretty popular - basically the size and shape of a Nalgene, but seriously insulated. The most popular one I see out there is the Bubba. I think the biggest size is absurdly bulky, but they have different sizes."

The best thing about a murs radio is being able to contact esd with out having to run to find someone with a radio. Plus those radios on Amazon are pretty cheap and the reviews are ok. I think that company makes another radio one model higher for about the same price, some of the reviews say it comes with a better antenna than that one.   They may be a little overkill for just getting ahold of your friends. But if you program it right, it'd probably do the job perfectly. So if you do get that one, buy the usb programming cable too!"

There was a small dance club across the street from me, a zipline just down the road, and a bar or two within a stone's throw.  Also several friendly folks to hang out and shoot the breeze with during the day.    It was a quiet residential neighborhood during the day, and most nights were reasonably quiet.  The dance club had a few party nights but it wasn't crowded or especially loud.  The only substantial noise was from the occasional loud art car cruising by.  Rare at night, since they usually cruise the open playa.  Obviously this may be completely different next year.  All it takes is one neighbor with ABBA on a loop to make things much more annoying. I'm planning on camping there again this year, so perhaps we'll run into each other.  I'll have a silver Honda Element with solar panels on the roof."

BurningMan,3clp6b,pacificmint,2,Thu Jul 9 20:09:56 2015 UTC,What? Who said that we're not answering in that case?   /u/Jovankat simply asked him her if he she was interested in it for himself herself or for a story.

BurningMan,3clp6b,Jovankat,4,Thu Jul 9 20:22:27 2015 UTC,I suspect it may have been upvoted so much because some folks around here might not be comfortable with being mined for info to write an article on a for-profit website.

BurningMan,3clp6b,psychonaughties,2,Thu Jul 9 04:21:07 2015 UTC,"It's about preference. I like freedom from rules and really wanted to get into the bootstrapping roots of Burning Man. I liked having problems to fix, and fixing them myself. Problems like how do I pee in the middle of the night when the goddamn honeypots are a quarter of a mile away. I love not being associated with a big camp: to mean it means I'm a full participant, like the Burner pioneers from days of old, rather than a consumer. I wouldn't camp in an RV for the same reason. Of course, you'd be in the minority out there these days doing it this way.  And to be fair, I have no idea if the ye Olden Burners did it this way, I wasn't there in '95.   I live in SF, so its not impossible for me to haul my gear up there - people coming from further away like the big camps because they don't have to bring or do anything except pay a little money and maybe work a few shifts at the kitchen. Some people like the convenience of a consumed camp experience. Allows you more free time for fucking off and spending time at the medical tent getting your dehydration treated. And if you don't have any friends going, its a good way to connect to community (I suppose, I wouldn't know).   As Larry made clear, the 10 Principles don't mean shit, so don't worry about whichever way you do it (producer/consumer). Just pick the one that works for you.  I still got a lot out of my time building a hexayurt and figuring out how to haul everything up there and plotting out campsites with friends. But those cats that fly in from Berlin on Wednesday and ride up to you on the playa at night on their posh new bike they didn't have to put together asking for directions to Distrikt sure do look comfy too.   Just remember its a party and don't take any of it too seriously and do what feels right."

I believe that many of the 38,000 tickets that were sold went to people buying 2 just in case a friend doesn't get their ticket. By this time, i'm pretty sure that those extra tickets were redistributed to those that needed them, or maybe even put back in STEP.  I know that the OMG sale will have a lot of people vying for tickets, but i don't think that it will have nearly as many as the main sale.

BurningMan,3chhxo,pion314,13,Tue Jul 7 23:13:01 2015 UTC,I'm too lazy to look for the thread now but someone on this board a year or two ago did some tests that indicated playa is not actually super basic when it comes into contact with skin (not very water soluble which would be required for it to form a high pH liquid on your skin). Much more damage is done from the tiny sharp edges of the silica and dryness of the playa.  tldr; baby wipes and a crap ton of high quality lotion. Use diluted vinegar if you feel like it.
BurningMan,3chhxo,brubakerp,2,Wed Jul 8 00:29:11 2015 UTC,"So much this.  Lots and lots of lotion.  I got in the habit of carrying some with me last year and applied it pretty much every time I washed my hands.  I normally get really dry hands out there, even when applying more lotion than I do normally.  It turned out I wasn't applying it often enough.  EDIT: I also tried a new lotion last year that I now use exclusively...  It's amazing.  Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Hand Cream in a tube."

BurningMan,3chhxo,mudley801,3,Wed Jul 8 03:43:18 2015 UTC,Thank you. I'll be sure to remember to walk on my feet and not my hands after I put lime juice on my feet.
BurningMan,3chhxo,thedustyfish,6,Wed Jul 8 03:50:45 2015 UTC,"So I can speak first hand how much it can suck to have this happen to you. It didn't occur to me on playa, but while traveling in central america and staying on a farm.   I was making lime juice from a huge box of fresh limes we collected from some local trees. After making about 2L of squeezed juice I diluted it into some bottles we had and put it away for lunch the next few days. I washed my hands, we ate lunch, and afterwards I went out and did a little bit of light work in the fields. I didn't have any issues that night at all, in fact it was filled with songs as we sat around in the kitchen.  Waking up in the morning, my hands felt HOT. Just my hands, hand a sensation of roasting heat, and within an hour blisters began to form. When one of the others at the farm woke up, they retrieved some highly medicinal aloe (according to him, the aloe on the property would help a little, but what he was growing behind his hut were highly medicinal strains of various kinds of plants) which had an amazing orange colour excretion when he cut it. I spent the rest of the day slicing off little bits of that aloe and rubbing it all over my hands. By the end of the day, the pain had subsided, and the blisters stopped growing, though I had problably covered about 20%-30% of my hands in some serious blisters.  I spent the last few days at the farm just taking it easy, helping where I could, doing my best to avoid popping the blisters and risking huge infection. Spent my last week in the country backpacking around doing a little sightseeing before heading home, carefully taking care of my hands.    If you're going to make lime juice, use thick gloves. Hell, just avoid it all together. It's can be pretty mean stuff.  Also I have photos of my hands just as they were starting to blister, and a week after. I can post them if people really want to see what it can do to you."

BurningMan,3claad,breefield,2,Wed Jul 8 22:19:16 2015 UTC,"FYI we asked for and received permission in advance for the DUSTFISH Village party raffle.  Edit: we've been digging into this and it looks like we had a verbal approval. The rules actually state you need written approval for something like this. We may actually pull the raffle until we get a formal approval.  Sextant, SK8Kamp and DUSTFISH are committed to doing the right thing. We thank the users in this thread for prompting us to take a longer look.  Edit 2: After reviewing the rules carefully, we've decided to cancel the raffle and refund the people who bought those tickets. We created DUSTFISH Village to be the best of what our 3 theme camps represent, and we're very serious about maintaining the spirit and the letter of the principles upon which our community is based. The Fundraiser itself is still on; let's party!!!"

When it gets called in, the cops come out and mark the tires and then come back and check it in 3 more days.  I'd say you'd be 99% safe leaving it for 6 days.  I just wouldn't leave it on an empty street, or a super crowded street.  Don't want to draw too much attention.  You could always just pay $10 per day to leave it at the airport parking lot."

BurningMan,3chz9p,brccarpenter,10,Wed Jul 8 01:34:12 2015 UTC,as someone who worked in the application approval meetings for a few years.... (but not in the past 2 years) I can assure that (at the time i worked) pretty much the ONLY safety concern that got any attention was trailers and the space between vehicles and trailers.  ..other concerns..... largely ignored or shrugged off as 'not really our problem'   trailer and area between vehicle? result of LOTS of debate/discussion and some feedback to owners.  really.
BurningMan,3chz9p,mans0n2,2,Wed Jul 8 07:13:22 2015 UTC,Thank you for your work and concerns on this. It's going to make a difference.
BurningMan,3chz9p,CannotExpectorate,3,Wed Jul 8 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"There are a few new DMV Policies for this year that are applicable to MV's with trailers and MV's with limited visibility...  Trailer Policy   For all Mutant Vehicles that have a trailer or trailers of any kind there must be a barrier in place that will prevent any person from intentionally or unintentionally entering the space between the trailer and the tow vehicle, and between one trailer and the next trailer. This barrier must have a minimum height of no more than 12 inches from the playa surface and a maximum height that is EITHER equal to the maximum height of the Mutant vehicle (this is intended to accommodate very low vehicles) OR no less than 36 inches above the playa surface. The barrier must be in place before the vehicle moves and must remain in place at all times when the vehicle is in motion. The barrier must be sufficiently strong as to stop the forward motion of a person who may unintentionally walk into it. No vehicle or trailer ingress or egress location (door, ramp, steps or other entrance) may be located in the space between trailer ands tow vehicle (or between two trailers) unless provisions are in place which will prevent motion of the vehicle while passengers are loading and unloading. No ingress/egress from second levels (eg. ladders, stairs) is permitted to be in the space between a trailer and tow vehicle (or between 2 trailers) at any time. At all times after sunset, the space between the trailer and the tow vehicle, and between one trailer and the next trailer must be illuminated in a manner in which it is easy to see regardless of ambient lighting conditions and in a manner that that will discourage any person from intentionally or unintentionally entering the space.   Walkers   For vehicles that are large or in instances where the driver does not have a clear view of the front and back of the vehicle, walkers must be used at all times when the vehicle is in motion. The number of walkers required will vary based on the size and type of vehicle, but must be a sufficient number of people to ensure safe navigation. The walkers must have some type of markings or attire that will identify them as walkers for that particular vehicle. Examples of markings/attire include; Reflective safety vests, brightly colored or reflective hats, Brightly colored or reflective bandanas, brightly colored or reflective shirts. A video surveillance system cannot be substituted in palace of walkers."
BurningMan,3chz9p,CannotExpectorate,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:26:17 2015 UTC,I can't tell you how thrilled I am to see this. It's beautiful. Please thank the group (of about ten or twenty in long discussions?) that worked to put this together. Hugs to you all.
BurningMan,3chz9p,gargoylenz,2,Wed Jul 8 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"I wonder why someone is down voting you all over this thread. While safety is third, I personally think an individual needs to consent to subjecting themselves to risk (like climbing a cool piece of art or fighting at the Thunderdome, no one is making you do that). Hopefully, this new DMV policy will keep participants safe and not cause too many problems to MV owners."
BurningMan,3chz9p,GaianNeuron,2,Wed Jul 8 18:41:08 2015 UTC,"If I was worried about down voting, I would never have put the thread up. I think a lot of good people at DMV thought this through and we will all be on the same page this year. This is great news."
BurningMan,3chz9p,manmeatsgoat,2,Wed Jul 8 19:58:24 2015 UTC,"Two deaths in 25 years at BM equates to four deaths per 52 weeks, just one year, if Burning Man was a full time event. Any place that had that death rate would be shut down.   However... 791 people killed by toasters last year! Over 25 years that's 19,775 people over 25 years!   19,775 people is 9,877.5 times as many people as have died at Burning Man from trailers.   Ergo, TOASTERS ARE OVER 9000 TIMES AS DEADLY AS BURNING MAN. (source)  We must ban toasters immediately!  But seriously, I'm all for safety on art cars. Trailers ARE dangerous, but so is lots of stuff at BM. There are and should be serious DMV rules regarding them but I don't think waving the banstick is the right way to approach this."
BurningMan,3chz9p,Jovankat,3,Wed Jul 8 12:38:29 2015 UTC,"Per capita, however:   TOASTERS: 791 / 7,000,000,000 = one in 8,849,557 people in 52 weeks. Even if only a quarter of the world has access to a toaster that's still one in 2,212,389. BURNING MAN: 4 / 70,000 = one in 17,500 people every 52 weeks.   Burning Man: deadlier than a toaster."
BurningMan,3chz9p,ivysneeze,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:22:06 2015 UTC,"Well, it turns out there are DMV rules this year (see below) because they (all volunteers) see the statistics and moral dilemma differently than you do. I guess that's the way they saw it, and it's their deal. BTW: Toasters that are not on a GFI electrical outlet can kill people that make innocent mistakes...as well as most electrical devices in wet areas like kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms, etc. That's why the electrical codes were changed years ago to require GFI outlets in those spaces, and hence....saved lives."

What I'm hearing when I read your post is that it's calling to you and it's not calling to your girlfriend. That could cause far more issues than dust and heat will.  The truth is when you're ready for it, when it's your year to do it you will do it. It's difficult to get out there and I think you have to really want it and really commit to it to make it work. Right now it sounds like you just aren't there yet, which is fine, and maybe you never will be. If you need convincing you probably shouldn't go, wait until the year when nothing and no one could stop you from stepping foot on the playa, that's the year to go."

It's hard to articulate the feeling of fun and community you get from the event because burning man is a lot of work and toil. I had this same problem with my girlfriend,  who kept asking ""when is it gonna get fun?""  when all we had been doing was packing planning and dealing with drama. That was a shitty feeling. Some people ""get it"" right away, I've brought other noobs who would've never asked that, and others don't.

BurningMan,3cgkvy,Jovankat,5,Tue Jul 7 21:26:42 2015 UTC,If you're camped next to them and a fire starts on their kitchen but the fire truck can't get to it because there's no fire lane it will affect you when your camp catches alight.   That's not a plug and play issue so much as a not following the safely rules for large camps though. My point was more they really don't seem to be on top of their shit.
BurningMan,3cgkvy,umdmatto,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:00:44 2015 UTC,No....I meant I wonder how the fire lanes will impact placement.  Our camp needs more space and even more now that we need to have the fire lane.  I hope we don't get shoehorned into an end cap again.

I've filled the theme camp application form in myself these last two years and there is totally a question about whether you want your camp listed publicly.  Also from Trilo on ePlaya when he posted the link to the list;   I say partial because this is by no means a complete list of theme camps. It's not even a complete list of the camps that registered for placement. This listing comes from those camps that submitted a placement questionnaire, provided some info about their camp, and chose to make that information available to the public. Please understand that being on this list is not a guarantee that a camp that filled out the form will be placed. Theme camp placement notifications should happen in early July.

BurningMan,3cgkvy,theseekerofbacon,5,Tue Jul 7 21:01:25 2015 UTC,"It is a plug and play. The BMORG has specifically and, in my opinion, rather hypocritically, given them in particular a pass to operate a plug n' play camp, citing their long connection with Burning Man and that many people who have camped there have worked on other art installations, blah blah. They even allocate a special block of tickets to Green Tortoise.  I suspect that whoever runs Green Tortoise is simply close to someone high up in the org.  Here's the BMORG's post on it: http://blog.burningman.com/2015/05/news/green-tortoise-the-exception-that-proves-the-rule/  Here's what Larry had to say about plug n' plays. Good luck reconciling it with their policy on Green Tortoise.  ""Instead, I think the current controversy over Plug and Play camps is not so much about equality, but concerns a very different though related concept: inequity – a basic sense of unfairness. Whenever a select group is allowed special access to tickets, especially when these tickets are in short supply, this can inspire ill feeling. This is doubly so if such a camp is widely perceived to be flouting nearly all of Burning Man’s Ten Principles."""

BurningMan,3cghyr,noiszen,3,Thu Jul 9 01:28:42 2015 UTC,"I went for the first time last year, and I went by myself. Here are some things that I will put more thought, energy and money into the next time I go.  Shade: I was lucky, I got stuck at the gate in the rain, and ended making friends and camping with the people stuck next to me. They had a badass shade structure, and I hung out under it every day. Partying all week (and I really didn't drink that much), plus the heat took A LOT out of me, which was unexpected because I've spent most of my life in Phoenix. I ended up leaving the event early because I was physically and mentally exhausted. I will definitely be putting more research and money into ways to help support my body in such extreme conditions.   Bike: If you are not very active, start practicing now. Ride your bike everywhere. Get used to riding miles every day. Since I got stuck at the gate, and it wasn't reopened until the sun was down, we were forced to try to find camp for 7 of us, plus 3 cars in the dark. We had to camp pretty far back, about 8:30 and K. As the week went on, the roads out there got worse. Your ass will be sore. Figure out something to make that seat comfortable. I couldn't sit on it without pain the last couple of days. Also, make sure you have extra tubes. We had to replace a tire twice.  Greywater: I tried to set it up so I could evaporate mine, but it didn't work. I had to pour it back into my empty water jugs and bring it back with me. It was fucking disgusting. Figure out/experiment at home how to properly evaporate it before you get there, and try to set yourself up so you're not using much water for anything other then drinking.  Trash: I didn't bring any paper plates or disposable silverware, because I didn't want to have to pack out much trash. Instead I thought I'd wash dishes, but as you can see above, greywater was an issue for me. Next time I'm bring paper plates.  Food: For convince, I'd definitely make 2 or 3 big meals that you can freeze and share with other burners. It'll help keep everything in your cooler cool until it defrosts (took about 2 or 3 days for my chili), and they were easy to reheat and serve. I made a huge batch of chili for myself and froze it. I ended up feeding my entire camp one night, and it was so awesome. Also, someone I camped with brought a giant stick of Genoa Salami and it was the tastiest, saltiest snack ever.  Ice: Speaking of keeping your cooler cool, I bought 4 bricks and set my cooler on top of them. I like to think they helped slow down the ice melting. My camp mates got dry ice, and it was good for about 4 days. I just got 2 10lb blocks before, which lasted about 3 days, and bought ice at the event for the rest of the week. I want to try dry ice next time.  Lights: Someone mentioned this, make sure you and your bike are well lit. You will be harassed if you do not do. It's very dark out there, and it's very dangerous to be walking or riding around without lights on you. If anything, just get a crapton of glow sticks from the dollar store.  Hope that helped! I'm sure you're going to be feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the information you're taking in. I'm no veteran to the event, but feel free to message me if you are feeling overwhelmed or need advice. I have a lot of acquaintances who have been going for years, and I'd be glad to reach out to them if I can't answer a question."
BurningMan,3cghyr,kockyspanks,2,Tue Jul 7 21:09:51 2015 UTC,Good list. I would say a flashlight is better than just glowsticks -- less trash too.
BurningMan,3cghyr,noiszen,2,Thu Jul 9 01:31:48 2015 UTC,"6 Months is tough for planning. Good Luck. It sounds like joining a group may be a good bet, but try to be as reliant as possible. Are you driving or flying? This festival can be really expensive or you can go budget, but learn as much as you can. I read almost everyday about planning aspects. Make sure you have a dust proof tent if possible, you can get super cheap led bike lights on ebay for $1, el wire on amazon for $3. Get a good extreme cooler if you don't have one. Freeze everything beforehand that needs to be cold. Invest in some good stakes for your tent and make sure they are playa tested. A low income ticket means you probably don't have much to spend, but focus on the survival necessities first."

BurningMan,3cgeae,UDubSconnie,8,Tue Jul 7 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"Roping off camp space for an unplaced camp during EA time is  a dick move.  If placement is on the ball, your markers will be removed and your EA folks will get a stern talking-to."
BurningMan,3cgeae,mudclub,8,Tue Jul 7 19:07:15 2015 UTC,I'm actually fairly certain that this is explicitly disallowed.
BurningMan,3cgeae,gibson_,2,Tue Jul 7 19:23:11 2015 UTC,It is.  Doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  I'm told placement is usually pretty good about policing the area.
BurningMan,3cgeae,mudclub,2,Tue Jul 7 19:26:44 2015 UTC,"Not only is it disallowed, but whoever they got their EA tickets from could lose them for next year.  EA tickets are for that camp and that camp only."
BurningMan,3cgeae,kersert,3,Tue Jul 7 21:16:27 2015 UTC,"You can get EA in a variety of ways, not just working for a camp. You can bring a mutant vehicle and be unplaced. You can be a volunteer who gets in early, and be unplaced."
BurningMan,3cgeae,Rotationation,6,Wed Jul 8 00:38:29 2015 UTC,"You're not supposed to land grab when you are there with EA. In my perception, Placement has been getting more and more diligent about enforcing this. I've seen a Placer actually remove ropes and stakes from the ground.  Worst case, you friends could actually get shit from the department or project that issued them the EA passes."
BurningMan,3cgeae,pacificmint,7,Tue Jul 7 19:22:08 2015 UTC,"When the gates open, the unplaced space is available for whoever gets there first.  Roping off space is equivalent to asking nicely ""please don't camp here"", which will only buy you a bit of time. By the time the surrounding area is filling up, you better have cars and tents taking up the space not just some rope; it's unreasonable to expect people to voluntarily camp several blocks farther out because someone might use the space later.  People will certainly get more bold as space gets more scarce; you'll leave for a few hours and come back to find someone has set up a complete camp in a empty spot they found, who ""didn't notice"" your rope and is ""sorry"", but they aren't going to move."
BurningMan,3cgeae,aaron42net,4,Tue Jul 7 18:58:13 2015 UTC,"Are you a ""placed"" camp?  This would mean you filled out an application and Bman approves you for a designated camp site, in this case yes: your early-arrival people can rope or flag off space. But if you are not an official ""Placed"" camp then it's different.  Your Early-Arrival friends presumably got Early passes through volunteering or some other art project (?) and they shouldn't/can't use that privilege to rope off a big camp site for their 22 other buddies."
BurningMan,3cgeae,prowlerSB,3,Tue Jul 7 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"Are you a ""placed"" camp? This would mean you filled out an application and Bman approves you for a designated camp site, in this case yes: your early-arrival people can rope or flag off space.   Actually, if they are a placed camp, the flags will be set for them by the placement team. Moving or altering the survey flags is a big no no.  You can use rope or something to make that delineation more visible, but it's already your space anyway. But don't set flags yourself, and absolutely don't move any flags that were set by Placement. (Saw a camp get in trouble for that last year)."
BurningMan,3cgeae,pacificmint,2,Tue Jul 7 19:26:33 2015 UTC,"They're definitely talking about a land grab, not about placement."
BurningMan,3cgeae,mudclub,2,Tue Jul 7 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I just wanted to clarify what GP said, cause he made it sound like placed camps can just arbitrarily flag off space, which is definitely not the case."
BurningMan,3cgeae,pacificmint,2,Tue Jul 7 19:30:20 2015 UTC,No we are not a placed camp.

BurningMan,3cgeae,mudclub,3,Tue Jul 7 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"Last year, folks with EA from departments but no placed camp were required to set up past 'G' street. I haven't seen anything about the policy for this year yet, but the map seems chock full of theme/placed camps from Esplanade to 'G', so it makes sense that that policy would stand. I'm guessing, based on my own observation pre-opening last year, that 'saving' space out past 'G' isn't really something the placers worry about; their concern is more with land hogs/squatters inside the placed zones. I've no judgement on whether it's right or wrong, just reporting how it seemed last year."
BurningMan,3cgeae,Jovankat,4,Tue Jul 7 20:46:57 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal:  If they are camping with you, they are welcome to claim space and use it.  If they are camping elsewhere, they are not even a little bit allowed to claim space for you."
BurningMan,3cgeae,lsdadventurer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:16:01 2015 UTC,EA pases aren't just for Theme Camps. There are HEAPS of ways people can get them.
BurningMan,3cgeae,lshiva,4,Tue Jul 7 20:05:28 2015 UTC,Be careful about getting there early. We arrived at 945 am last year gates opened at 10am we were placed in line and when the gates opened the let those who arrived closest to 10am in first. So those who got there really early had to wait for everyone else to get in first.
BurningMan,3cgeae,Rotationation,2,Tue Jul 7 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"A number of people have talked about how grabbing a chunk of land on Wednesday would be a jerk thing to do, but there is one option that nobody has discussed. Find the spot where you want your camp to be and then talk to anyone else who shows up. Unplaced land is wide open that early, and asking people to set up another 50 feet down the road isn't that big a deal if done nicely and perhaps accompanied by a cold beer. Then when the gate opens for everyone mark the spot you need for anyone else in your camp.   There's no sense of rushing to get a spot when you're unplaced with EA like there is with entering during the mad rush of gate opening, and in my experience people are a lot more laid back about picking their spots."
BurningMan,3cgeae,pacificmint,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:45:13 2015 UTC,"Not sure where people are getting the ""placers will rip up your stakes and rope!"" thing from. Past few years on EA, I've seen tons of rope'n'staking done for unplaced camps and they've never had a problem.  I usually build a shade structure and the rest of us on EA park in such a way that it is obvious where we are saving space. We'll fill in as needed with our own tents and other infrastructure. All the rest of our folks arrive on Sunday, so we fill it up quick."

I paid $150 last year which wasn't the cheapest but I'm coming from NY and taking the Burner Express so it was less hassle to rent. The thing I like about them is they will let you try a bunch of different bikes instead of handing you one. I'm very short and prefer a bike with gears so they let me try about 20 bikes before I found ""the one"". Downside is: returning it at the end (they were at 9 o'clock and I was at 3 o'clock) during the mad dash of breaking down. Prior to that, taking out all the decor I had put on before returning. I don't mind the bike decorating on playa because I hung out with a bunch of cool peeps at camp while doing it. Will probably use them again this year."

Also I heard a story last year of someone who always kept their tickets on the fridge until the last moment before they left. One year something happened and they didn't make it to the burn so the following year those tickets were still on the fridge and in their rush to leave they grabbed the wrong ones.

Making reservations through the central website/office/800# can mean that you get promised equipment that is not going to be there when you go for pick up.  It is -highly- recommended that you get on a first name basis with the people at the location you are going to pick up from to make absolutely sure that your truck will be there when you arrive.
BurningMan,3c9rxp,nastrus,2,Mon Jul 6 14:50:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this helps but we rented a U-haul truck from Reno last year and had zero problems.

They eventually got a different size one, but it screwed things up a bit.  UHaul is pretty awful, so I would strongly suggest not using them. It's not so much that you have to worry about them cancelling because you're a burner, it's that they oversell their stock so when there's a big event (and burning man is probably one of the biggest) the people who don't show up first get screwed."
BurningMan,3c9rxp,tedivm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"We've used uhauls the past 2 years for our theme camp. We are also based in SF. For the most part, they worked ok. However, two points of heads up;   They have switched our pickup location and details before to a different bay area locale. Didn't end up being a huge deal but it did create a bit of a scramble to get our driver to the right place at the right time (he had to leave work midafternoon to rush over to Walnut Creek instead of our original plan).  Plan to have a few hundred dollars extra in your budget for cleaning expenses beyond what they claim. First we got dinged for a dirty truck despite them claiming it did not need to be cleaned. Second year we took it to a truck wash; and they still tried to tack on the extra BM cleaning fees despite the fact it had been washed about 20 minutes before return. We had to argue with them for a while (after a very long breakdown and unload). I'm not sure if we got out of the fee that time or not.   Getting your reservation contract in writing seems like a good idea, if possible. Having a member whose not afraid to be a little diplomatic (and if need be, confrontational) might be helpful too.  Final note; do a little research on sleeping in that truck if you haven't before. Its not as comfortable as you might think.  Good luck with everything!"

BurningMan,3c7fuw,Au70,3,Sun Jul 5 16:24:15 2015 UTC,"If the batteries are in the same condition, charged and discharged together you won't have a problem.  Just never connect batteries together at different charge levels. Based on what you said of the battery size, you should stick with a 20A charger if you want the option of charging just one at a time. The rule of thumb is basically C/5 rate (105/5 ~ 20A).  My first recommendation would be to buy a NOCO genius g7200 and deal with slower charge rates but a far superior product (I love mine).  If you want quick and dirty with a something cheap, go with a Schumacher xc103w or similar."
BurningMan,3c7fuw,Burn-O-Matic,2,Mon Jul 6 00:52:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've been looking at the NOCO Genius chargers specifically, although I was thinking about the G26000. Mainly because I'll want to charge these while they're still hooked up in parallel.   If I'm charging them in Parallel, wouldn't C/5 be ~60?"
BurningMan,3c7fuw,Burn-O-Matic,2,Mon Jul 6 13:58:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 60A would be the max charging current for the 3 in parallel.  I say go for it if its in your budget.  You won't be disappointed.    You can charge single smaller batteries with the NOCO but it may take longer than expected because it will spend more time trickle charging instead of bulk charging at high amps.    Some final unsolicited advice:  Please use some type fusing right at the battery.  ATC style ones are better than clear inline glass styles.  A shorted battery can do serious bodily harm or start fires."

BurningMan,3c7fuw,cablemonkey604,2,Mon Jul 6 01:42:48 2015 UTC,"First you need to determine what type of battery you have.You say you are running deep cycle batteries so  I assume they are standard lead acid batteries, either gel cell (sealed- nothing comes out if tipped over) or the traditional screw top add water type. If this is true then buy the heaviest (in weight) automotive battery charger you can find with a fan, at least #4 cables and good alligator clips. Why heaviest? Because the current carrying capacity is determined by the transformer which is made of iron and copper- the more current carrying cap the heavier it is. The electronics are pretty standard and cheap, if a manufacturer is going to skimp it will be on the transformer. Why a fan? because heat kills transformers and air over will extend the life. This charger will have automatic and manual settings. Use the appropriate automatic setting. This will ""read"" the battery as it is charging and adjust current and volts as needed. Thirty or more amps is normal especially at startup on a dead battery. As the batteries become charged current will decrease. The manual setting just pushes unregulated power into the battery and can overheat it warping the cells.  Battery explosions are usually caused by low water which gives room for hydrogen gas to accumulate. If the plates arc it will explode. As you add charge the volume of the liquid increases and can cause overflow. Keep the battery topped off between the top of the plates andthe ring under the cap. This obviously for cells you can open.  It is fine to charge batteries in parlell. Just takes longer. FYI a 12 V battery consists of 6 cells each cell has a full chage voltage of 2.1 V or 12.6 V across the terminals. Full discharge is about 1.95V. A battery charger puts out up to 13.5 volts."
BurningMan,3c7fuw,cablemonkey604,2,Mon Jul 6 01:33:27 2015 UTC,"They're VRLA, so there's no way for me to add water.   I like the charger advice, it's solid. We have a charger for the vehicle itself that's a 36V 25A charger, and yeah, it's massive/heavy.   edit: 36V not 36A"

BurningMan,3c7fuw,asciiartvandalay,2,Tue Jul 14 13:56:22 2015 UTC,"The thing is massive   11.9 x 5.5 x 3 inches. Definitions of massive vary. I would be very surprised if they're 4 awg.  I think they look to be 10 at best. Which should be good for up to 30A, so you will be fine. I suspect that they wouldn't sell it with wires that it could melt. Although that might be entertaining under the right circumstances."
BurningMan,3c7fuw,Burn-O-Matic,2,Wed Jul 15 01:10:42 2015 UTC,"30A? You're going to fry those batteries. At most, you want to charge somewhere around 1-2A. For example:  If charging separately (a good idea): http://amzn.com/B000CIPHUI  If charging together, which is not a good idea in parallel: http://amzn.com/B002DU3S9A  Also, three batteries to power an art car and all the LEDs sounds a little under.

BurningMan,3c6dis,brcfire,3,Sun Jul 5 19:07:53 2015 UTC,"A couple things that sold me on the Yamaha:   In Eco mode the thing is near silent. You do not realize how important this is until out on playa with pesky neighbors. It has a port to connect another 2000i for 4000 total watts. So, you get one and someone else in camp gets one then, when needed, you can link them for additional power. Extremely fuel efficient. Space is limited and only needing a couple gallons for two weeks out there is great.   I don't remember seeing the Yamaha at Costco unless it's a new item. Definitely understand the need to go Costco. After much research and use I would buy the Yamaha first and Honda second. All 'consumer' Generacs I've encountered were crap. They make a great large product but for some reason the smaller stuff seems inferior. Check out reviews on Amazon to confirm.

There are several people there who are extremely knowledgable about generators; look especially for posts by Captain Goddamit.  Let me throw in that I hate generators at Burning Man. They're horribly noisy and obnoxious. People assure me that the Honda EU series are quiet, and my question is, Do you then put that quiet generator under your shade and run it while you're there? Nobody ever answers that one, although others have suggested putting the generator in the owners' RV or tents, but that's a little harsh."
BurningMan,3c6dis,gargoylenz,2,Sun Jul 5 20:18:42 2015 UTC,"Do you then put that quiet generator under your shade and run it while you're there?   Yes, I did last year. (well, the little Ryobi which they claim is even quieter than the Honda but is actually about the same).  As /u/Jovankat says, if they're running at fairly low load then you can happily talk over them at close range. If I had anything bigger I'd probably build a baffle-box for it.   We had zero complaints from any of our neighbours last year, but pretty sure all of them also had generators."

Hopefully there's someone in Reno who can service it at short notice if I really can't get it going, otherwise I'll just have to go buy another one."
BurningMan,3c6dis,nevadasteve,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"Seafoam is OK, but there's no reason for it to cost so much.  Berrymans doesn't have a social media marketing team so it's still cheap.  Plus it comes in both a spray can and a bottle.  The spray is good for cleaning out tiny orifices.  Be sure to protect your eyes and any painted surfaces when using it.   If you Google about generator carburetors you'll get a good idea of what goes into cleaning them.  I had to clean out an Onan generator in a RV.  The hardest part was getting the carb out of the generator.  I had to use tiny wrenches that I was lucky to have.  Once it's out it should be fairly obvious how to disassemble it.  Be careful not to turn any adjustment screws if you can help it.  I'd call around for repair shops ahead of time.  Small engine repair shops may be able to clean it, but probably won't stock any parts and may not have a quick turn around.  Good luck!"

BurningMan,3c0az4,gibson_,10,Fri Jul 3 16:36:13 2015 UTC,"This is actually a pretty good parallel. The sacking of /u/chooter and /u/kickme444 two weeks ago point to the idea that the upper management wants to change (and likely further monetize) its community interaction, and they're doing so by internally removing certain well respected community members. Part of what makes reddit great is that a lot of background work is done by volunteers that adhere to certain principles... and like you said:   If you ignore the volunteers, and try to monetize the free work that they are giving you, they tend to get upset about it."
BurningMan,3c0az4,ZanshinJ,3,Fri Jul 3 19:03:23 2015 UTC,"I just read an article that makes parallels between reddit mods and AOL chatroom monitors. The AOL mods revolted somewhat and sued AOL. http://priceonomics.com/the-aol-chat-room-monitor-revolt/  Although, this article lists several ways the reddit mods aren't exploited the way the AOL chat monitors were."
BurningMan,3c0az4,wakkawoot,-2,Fri Jul 3 22:36:17 2015 UTC,"It's nice to think that, but to be perfectly honest given the information that has come out regarding this, it sounds like a bunch of people taking their ball and going home. The only legitimate complaint that I've heard is that it leaves /r/IAmA kinda high and dry with respect to all the stuff she was set to do over the course of the next few weeks. So the mods have to figure out there what they're doing. But I really think the reaction of all the other subs is a little unwarranted. And frankly I don't give a shit about all these politics. And it's getting annoying that this is showing up in every other subreddit that isn't even affected by any of this.  So maybe it is close to Caravansicle in a big way, because frankly I'm tired of people who don't know the whole story acting indignant like they've been personally slighted even though this has absolutely zero bearing on what they do."
BurningMan,3c0az4,ebbomega,13,Fri Jul 3 16:43:58 2015 UTC,"Actually the mods are pissed about a complete and utter lack of communication between them and the admins and victoria was their only line of communication with them. Her firing was just another example of corporate reddit/admins not giving a single shit about what the mods have to do to keep their subs afloat. the AMAs weren't just confined to that single sub they also had impact in a variety of subs eg books, music, science, etc. The mods felt they were shit on (yet again) with no consideration,  no recourse and no communication. So they said 'thats it, we're done'."

BurningMan,3c09pc,brcfire,3,Fri Jul 3 16:43:31 2015 UTC,"Nope I read it all and it sounded like you hadn't googled cause there ain't nothin fancy about the results that get returned by a google search and there are plenty that have Reno pickup. I doubt you'll find anything much cheaper in Reno just before the burn, it's a seller's market they know you're coming and that you'll be desperate. Unless you use one of the rental services you run the risk of wasting a whole bunch of time driving around trying to find something cheap only to get a super shitty bike that will fail as soon as it hits the playa.   Your best option would be Elliot, his bikes are all in excellent condition, you'd be helping to support on playa bike repair and you won't be leaving one of your most important burn purchases to chance.

Walking distance to the Walmart (sorry, I know) and they have free shuttles to/from Airport whenever you want (yes, even at 4am). They have a pool (which is always empty and clean) and a nice experience if you want to stay away from the pool party scene. I have stayed with them the past 2 years (will do so again this year) before the burn. Last year, I did the Sands/Grand Sierra pool parties and it wasn't my scene.

I replied, ""People who love to read, and don't get enough time to enjoy it during their busy, 'normal' lives. I thought you could do anything at Burning Man?""  Fuck those who put down others for reading at Burning Man. Costumes and contraptions beyond imagination are ok, but exploring my own psyche with literature is taboo? Nope!  It makes me happy, doesn't bother anyone, and one of my best memories of the burn will always be idling by the hottest hours of the day in a shady hammock, icy drink in hand, reading Brave New World and relaxing into the words, enjoying the mindscape.

BurningMan,3byvfo,brodyqat,6,Fri Jul 3 16:11:21 2015 UTC,"I was walking down the street by myself in the middle of a white out sometime in the middle of the week my first year, 2004. I was out maybe Esplanade and 930. I was walking because my bike had been stolen my first night out at some big dance camp. I liked that bike: it was tuned up and was my size, and I had ziptied Alice in Wonderland figurines to the handlebars and body. I digress. So my first year and I was a little suspicious, a little unclear about what the playa was, who burners were, what I was doing there, what was public space and private space, and where the playa magic was for me. I was a mess, probably hadn't eaten in days, and was working some things out the best I could at 21. So I'm walking across the open toward esplanade and probably 930, wearing some outfit that understated my hot athletic body, alone with my Camelback, walking with no destination. 2004 had a fair amount of dust, and this moment was full of it. I was surrounded by white clouds. Every few minutes a few people would ride by on bikes, energetically pushing through the wind, and then would disappear into the white. I was prepared though, for being a newbie, with goggles and dust mask, functional shoes and a backpack full of all essentials, except for food of course, which is typical of the time of my life. Also typical was my being alone. I had spent the winter and spring with my running, writing, reading, and working. I was very lonely and sad, but I also had this secret sense of flow and magic. I had read William Gibson's latest novel and found solace, and acceptance, of my love of the Internet. Then a family member died tragically in the summer. In my grief I sought out comfort and community as best I could. I danced at raves in the desert, I visited friends in other cities, I decided to buy a ticket and go to burning man, an event I had only heard of and knew no one who also went. I sought out all of William Gibson's novels and read them, entered their worlds fully, grateful for the escape and melancholic landscapes. I had read all of them, except for one, which I just hadn't had time to acquire yet, although I really wanted to read it. I found a camp, then a ride, packed my bag and turned up at BRC, lost, sad and slightly hopeful. So there I am in the middle of a white out, talking to no one walking alone toward the Esplanade. It's 2004 so the playa is very low in population compared to now. I felt like the last human on earth. Alone with my thoughts, the last human out during the storm. As the wind blew, I saw something on the ground, blowing along the 930 intersection, which was empty of other humans. Good Samaritan that I was, I ran over to collect the MOOP book. I assumed it was a book that the hoi polloi would read: big print, small words, and zero literary value. I grab it and flip it over, to see that it is a copy of that one William Gibson novel I hadn't yet read. Playa magic became real for me in that moment.  Edit: All Tomorrow's Parties"

I'm guessing that since you're from the UK, you don't use RVs much (seems to be mainly an American thing, and only then a certain slice of the population). Trust me when I say that while it may technically sleep 6-8, the key word is 'technically' and in any practical sense putting 6-8 people in there for a week on the playa is borderline crazy imo. You will regret it, hard. You can't chose who to transfer tickets to via STEP. Not a big impediment to your plan, just a note.   Think hard about your plan! It may be that economics dictates what you do but I am 100% positive you will have a FAR better time on the playa if you're not coming back to a hugely crowded RV, which is what 6-8 would make for. Think of things like the possibility of radically different sleeping schedules and the fact that most of the beds in an RV are in common space, not their own room."
BurningMan,3bxdrw,doctor-yes,3,Fri Jul 3 00:17:10 2015 UTC,I can't agree more. I bring a 30' RV which claims to sleep 6 and anything more than three us unbearable.

Get a few small tents and rebar and have half of your crew sleep in a tent on the west side of the RV.  You can easily get 4 tents along the side of the RV.

Are you going to deliver it to them?  These trailers are $15k from Shasta and if you go get them yourself that's the end of it.  You've owned it for more than a day, so it's not worth $15k anymore - that's just the way it works.  There are dozens of these right now on RV Trader, all under $16k, several more realistically priced under $13k.  Your husband was a jerk, and you're left with an expensive toy that isn't worth as much as you want it to be.  Good luck selling it, but I'd highly recommend looking at the already flooded market and finding a much more reasonable price and you might actually get rid of it.

BurningMan,3bsomk,mudclub,2,Wed Jul 1 21:08:47 2015 UTC,"Wire doesn't make noise, inverters do.  In general, the cheaper the inverter, the louder its whine will be. The ones you can buy in packs from AliExpress are about as good as the ones you get from the shops at Gerlach (ie. noisy as hell).  It is possible to get higher-frequency inverters which are harder to hear, from memory both Coolight and Cool Neon sell those (look for 2kHz or higher frequency). I bought one 450Hz inverter and its whine is at a pitch that is very easy to hear (although its advantage is that it can run the 30' of wire on Pulse).  The only way to make an inverter that doesn't whine at all is to use a different kind of transformer circuit which is very difficult even if you are an electrical engineer."

BurningMan,3br94i,markday,2,Wed Jul 1 16:50:36 2015 UTC,"Pesto pasta with chicken chunks, feta and pine nuts.  Curry.  Curry was a big hit last year and it's not hard to get/make lots of it. Throw in some fresh veg or spinach when you heat it up and pour over brown rice/quinoa/barley/grain of choice.  Not a frozen idea, but quesadillas.  Easy to make, fast, and little prep needed."
BurningMan,3br94i,tiny_mouse,2,Wed Jul 1 14:59:36 2015 UTC,"My camp has around 50 people and we split into subgroups of about 10 each. Each subgroup or pod organizes a meal each day just for their pod, one person or couple taking responsibility for each day, rotating through the people in the pod. Organizing and cooking a meal for 10 is a lot easier and more feasible than 50. It also helps make sure not as many people miss the meal, because their pod can cook whenever everyone in the pod is around and not have to wrangle the entire camp (herding cats). My boyfriend and I made a veggie thai curry the week before, and froze it and brought rice to cook. Other members of our pod brought frozen pasta that they had made before and heated up, one member brought steaks which was amazing, one member made chili. Another pod had brought an oven and ingredients to make around 20 pizzas and we had pizza day for the entire camp."

BurningMan,3br94i,ttaacckk,2,Wed Jul 1 21:24:44 2015 UTC,"I'm part of a group that does large scale cooking events in the NW.  We have played a kind of game with ourselves where we see how many people we can feed for the lowest amount of money, and still have it be good enough that people think we're Jesus.  The key here is rice and beans, with just enough other stuff thrown in to make it good.  My particular favorite take on rice and beans is Indian.  Ghee is cheap.  Lentils are cheap.  If you know where to shop, spices are reasonable.  And you can throw in some protein which isn't necessarily cheap but a bit goes a long way.  If you're going the cook at home route, then seal-a-meal and freeze, I'd recommend a nice spread of dal makhni, saag paneer, and a modest amount of meat curry of some kind (butter chicken or pork vindaloo are both tasty and not too expensive).  All those dishes you can cook before you leave, then freeze and boil in a bag to reheat, with some fresh jasmine rice you prepare in a pot.  If you're cooking on site, you can go the same route, just bring the dry lentils, rice, and ghee; and the meat, spinach, and paneer in a cooler.  You'll want a turkey fryer or two, and a big-ass wok or frying pan.  Honestly, cooking at the burn can be a pain, so I recommend the boil-a-bag approach.  As much as I love to field cook for large groups of people, the logistics of it on playa can wreck your whole day."
BurningMan,3br94i,cgalv,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:39:08 2015 UTC,"We've done the small teams of people signing up to cook 1-2 meals and 1 person as the person in charge of the kitchen to coordinate for a long time. That kitchen person tended to burn out though. So we split the role into 2 people. A pre-playa person and an on-playa person.  Pre is basically a spreadsheet wizard who can refactor peoples recipes to identify what ingredient  can be a bulk purchase and the like. On-playa person can make those runs and set up kitchen early access, then make sure people make it to their shifts.  It takes a lot of the pain out of running a field kitchen to separate it out like that."

Pretty much anything that can be frozen can be brought to playa, not to mention fresh items earlier in the week. Basically, can you make a big batch of it and can you freeze it? Bring it!"

BurningMan,3br94i,Jovankat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:00:44 2015 UTC,We did a couple of large roast porks. Cook them and freeze them in heavy  bags. Unseal the top of the bag in one spot to let steam escape  (but clip to top of pot with clothespin so water doesn't get in) and put it in a large pot of boiling water. Great with instant mashed potatoes and bagged salad. Romaine seems to last longest. Leftover meat (if there is any) is great for sandwiches the next day. A real treat on the playa. Whole pork loin goes on sale every other month at Vons (Safeway)

Breakfasts are pretty easy- assortment of cereal, bacon and/or eggs, and bisquick for pancakes. Real maple syrup to get fancy.  Enjoy!"

So, when something bad does come up, we have plenty of friends on our side."
BurningMan,3bq432,james4765,6,Wed Jul 1 11:10:19 2015 UTC,So very true. Much of the work you describe is silent until something like this comes up. Just waiting for Norquist to chime in more than a tweet. BLM is essentially increasing taxes on the event.
BurningMan,3bq432,brcfire,13,Wed Jul 1 17:09:07 2015 UTC,"The site OP links to requires you to fill in a survey or connect social media. Here's the full text:  Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., said he spoke with Bureau of Land Management Director Neil Kornze Monday about the BLM's original request for more than $1 million encampment at the colossal Burning Man artsy wing-ding in the Black Rock Desert later this year.  Heller said the BLM requests – that included flush toilets, washers and dryers -- plus 24/7 access to soft ice cream ""was a bit over the top.""  He said Kornze feels the same way, predicting the request will be scaled down.  ""I think it was a bit over the top,"" Heller said about the BLM's original request. ""And I believe that Director Kornze believes the same thing – that it was a little bit over the top.""  Heller was speaking publicly about the BLM's proposed luxuries for the first time Monday.  ""They are going to augment it and come back to our delegation and let us know what it is,"" Heller said about the BLM's request. ""Then we'll see where we go from there.""  KORNZE, AN ELKO COUNTY native, was a senior policy adviser for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., before joining the BLM. Kornze took control of the BLM last April, just days before Cliven Bundy's standoff with the BLM first became a nation news story.  Now his agency is in another pickle in Nevada, again looking bad in his home state. Nevada's 2nd U.S. House District Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Carson City, has expressed ethical concerns about the BLM's requests.  There seems to be a concern from Nevada's federal delegation not to harm the Burning Man event. In about a quarter of a century, it has evolved into a cash cow for Northern Nevada, with estimates of its economic impact starting at $44 million annually.  Reid has been a major player in advancing Kornze's career. He delivered a 71-28 confirmation vote for Kornze when he was the senate majority leader, even though Republicans balked at Kornze's age of 35 during hearings, according to the Washington Post. Reid referred to Kornze as ""somebody that is just perfect for the job,"" after he received Senate confirmation as BLM director.  Now Reid is solidly against the BLM requests, making the BLM out as a bunch of pansies in a letter to Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell.  ""Part of Burning Man's philosophy is self-reliance and living with the elements is part of the experience,"" Reid wrote. ""Flush toilets and laundry facilities can be found about ten miles away in Gerlach, Nevada, if BLM's employees need such amenities.""  REPUBLICAN presidential candidate, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., appears to be doing well in Nevada. However, it may turn out to be a mistake on his part for meeting with Cliven Bundy for 45 minutes during a stop in Mesquite, which was reported by Politico.  Paul was on a major campaign trip through Nevada, becoming the first major presidential candidate to visit rural Nevada stops like Elko and Mesquite.  Giving Bundy so much time on a critical campaign tour -- may in some people's minds – align Bundy with the Paul campaign. That is risky. Bundy has broken the law and has uttered blatantly racist remarks. All the state's top Republicans have steered clear of Bundy, except for firebrand Assemblywoman Michele Fiore, R-Las Vegas. He seems a divisive figure for a campaign trying to unite a GOP base under the big umbrella.  Surely there are other conservative Republican ranchers in Nevada who pay their grazing fees and would be just as deserving of Sen. Paul's time and whose opinions of federal overreach of the BLM in Nevada should be taken as seriously as Bundy's."

You should also know that in the main sale (the individual sale) 40,000 tickets sold out in just over an hour. There will be less than 2,000 available in the OMG. Those odds aren't great so consider that when you're making your plans.  You're also quite late to be starting making plans for your first burn this year generally, but especially as someone outside the US. Going to Burning Man is a pretty huge undertaking even for someone within driving distance of it. Before you move on any plans this year I'd seriously recommend reading the Survival Guide and the First Timer's Guide. Both are required reading for the event so you're going to have to read them anyway, you may as well do it asap so you know what you're signing up for.  Once you've done that jump on Facebook and try to track down a local burner group. Get involved, make friends, help on  a project if there's one nearby and let everyone know you're looking for a ticket in case someone they know can't go.  There's a wealth of information in this sub about how to avoid getting scammed when buying a ticket on the aftermarket, the search function is your friend.

They have the money and cache, and longer periods of organization, and they look to recruit people from the sacramento area to support/fund/build their projects. I feel that's part of why there are no major projects that come out of sacramento - anyone who's got big aspirations just runs down the freeway to the mothership(s).   It's not really the RC's jobs to build community in Sacto tho, it's to support the larger BM burn-o-sphere, so I understand why they wouldn't care about that angle. I mean, they are compensated in the form of a ticket by the org to do that job, not the build locally job."

My, most likely under informed, world view was that the low income sale was for folks that couldn't be in the other sales."
BurningMan,3bnt4g,tedivm,8,Tue Jun 30 19:18:43 2015 UTC,"Low income tickers are for people with low income. Having low income doesn't mean they can't somehow afford the ticket, it means that there's a huge burden on them if they have to.  I don't think there are a huge number of people who would be completely unable to go to the burn without a low income ticket, but I do believe that for many it's the kind of thing that makes their burn a hell of a lot less stressful (not having money is hard).   As such, I have no problem with people joining both sales- in fact, because of how long it takes for applications to be processed and accepted I'd be shocked if people didn't join both, as in some way it would be irresponsible of them not to.  What I'd like to see is one of two things:   Modify the rule so that people can't buy multiple tickets, as opposed to them not being allowed to join multiple sales. In instances like this- where STEP came through first- they should simply allow the person to release the tickets back into step and keep the low income one. Run the low income sale earlier. Most people who need it are going to be the type of people who have to plan early anyways, as low income often means saving up for long periods for vacations and having to work around shitty jobs that aren't flexible in vacation time. Simply finishing the sale in January, before the other sales occurs, would resolve this problem."
BurningMan,3bnt4g,tossy_mctosserson,3,Tue Jun 30 19:24:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, no.  You are wrong.

BurningMan,3bnt4g,tedivm,2,Wed Jul 1 00:06:12 2015 UTC,"The website says nothing to back up what you're saying. All it says is that they do it based on need, and they collect a significant amount of documentation around that.  To be blunt, the type of person who can't afford the $190 difference in ticket prices are sure as hell not going to be able to afford the other $190 or everything else that goes with burning man. If that is who this sale is targeting then it's a failure unless the tickets are given away for free.  To put this another way, there are always ways people can raise $190 (which is what the current discount is for low income tickets). They can pick up side jobs, sell possessions, ask people to gift it to them, borrow it, donate blood, panhandle, and so many other things. Even the poorest people in the US can likely find that kind of cash if the need was high enough.  So I guess what I'm saying is an absolute position like the one your advocating just doesn't make sense."

It is the position of the Borg though. The tickets are meant for peple who would not be able to go without the $190 discount. That is the point of them.   Also this;   Even the poorest people in the US can likely find that kind of cash if the need was high enough.   is bullshit. There are people in American jails because they can't afford to pay traffic fines. There are others who are trapped in ridiculously unpayable pay day loans because they couldn't come up with the couple of hundred dollars they needed and got desperate. There are stories all over the internet of how an unexpected bill of only a few hundred dollars set off a chain reaction in a poor persons's life and basically ruined it.   There are absolutely ways folks can dig deep to come up with extra cash and I've used the exact kind of thinking you're using here to explain how anyone who buys a pre-sale ticket isn't automatically ""rich"" but suggesting that anyone in the US can do it is way off base."

Your link to the ticket exchange also does not prove your point at all. My point was that if they took the extreme and only allowed the absolute poorest people to get into the sale (those people with traffic tickets that you mentioned) then no one would actually get to use the program. That has nothing to do with whether burning man allows people to participate in multiple sales or not, which I am well aware of (which you'd know had you read my first post in this thread)."
BurningMan,3bnt4g,Jovankat,2,Wed Jul 1 05:24:24 2015 UTC,"No I don't think that people in jail for traffic fines are going to be able to afford burning man, with or without the discount. But you literally said this.   Even the poorest people in the US can likely find that kind of cash if the need was high enough.   I'd put staying out of jail higher up on the priority list than getting a ticket to burning man  and this   To put this another way, there are always ways people can raise $190    Yeah tell that to the folks in jail for traffic tickets of roughly that amount. if there truly was always a way for them to raise the money they wouldn't be in jail.  I'm not taking your statement out of context, you chose to remove the context by stopping being specific about low income BM attendees and invoking a huge generalisation about all poor people in America for dramatic effect. If you wanted to keep the conversation specific to the context of BM you shouldn't have brought ""Even the poorest people in the US"" into this because you're right, they can't afford to attend. By using them to try to make your point your privilege and/or ignorance showed enough that it deserved to be called out.  And there are absolutely ways the $190 discount could be the difference for someone going. Someone who had been before and thus has all the infrastructure but is now out of work and can't afford the ticket for instance. With ride share and spending the money they'd be spending on food for the week anyway the ticket cost is the major expense.   Didn't you have someone in your camp last year who pulled out when she didn't get a low income ticket?   I don't disagree that there are a lot of folk who could scrape that $190 together who do still deserve the help. But the position of the borg is if you're one of those people who could scrape it together do that and free up a spot for someone who can't. The wording in the FAQ answer makes it clear they're serious. They'll cancel your low income ticket for letting a friend use your credit card to buy their tickets. Regardless of what you or I think should be the eligibility criteria they seem to think if you can afford to put a ticket on your credit card, even someone else's they're presumably paying you back for immediately you don't deserve a LI ticket.  What your ""anyone can find the cash if they need to"" position doesn't take into account is that being poor changes the likelihood that you'll just say ""fuck it I'm going to make this work."" Being able to put it all on your credit card and worry about it later is a privilege. It's one I have, that was how I paid for my entire 2013 burn. And I know it's one you have. Others don't have that privilege and it really sounds like you're ignoring that being poor makes you take less risks and feel less entitled to things. So for plenty of folks being denied a LI ticket will result in them giving up on going.  And you said    The website says nothing to back up what you're saying.    I provided a link to the website that did back up what Tossy was saying. It showed that in fact the borg doesn't consider anyone who uses another sale to be eligible for the low income program. That is a very far cry from it being irresponsible of them not to try both, which you suggested. You also said you'd be shocked if people didn't try both which made it rather clear you weren't familiar with the borg's position.   I did read your first post but it read very much like someone who didn't know how the Low Income Program actually worked or what it's like to be poor, hence my reply."

My week started by being flown in from Australia, picked up from the airport and taken to a 5 star hotel, handed an envelope full of local cash and offered free tickets to a Castellucci show.   The following week I had a paid week off between Vienna Festival and Holland Festival so I took a train to Budapest to hang out. While I was there this guy I kinda only barely knew, /u/jazicle, convinced me to buy a mutual friend's ticket to this thing in the desert he was going to later in the year. I then spent all of my time in Amsterdam when not working holed up my hotel room watching Halcyon's youtube videos.

BurningMan,3blfmb,Jovankat,2,Tue Jun 30 17:20:23 2015 UTC,Good point. We transport 6 bikes this way each year. We do a quick wrap of duct tape around each set of pedals after they are removed and write on them which bike they are for. The tools are kept in my (where else? :) ) playa tool bag.

BurningMan,3blfmb,Jovankat,3,Tue Jun 30 18:59:59 2015 UTC,"You can vacuum pack clothes/food/etc.. Saves sooo much space. Or stuff sacks like you'd use for camping. Ziploc bags for things like toiletries vs. hard plastic cases. I like bins full of ziploc bags for different items. When possible, bring the amount of something you'll need, not just whatever size the store had. Look for things (like bikes) that can have a few parts removed and become less bulky.  Pack food etc. in nesting containers that can be consolidated as you go. Ratchet straps work wonders for things like pillows/blankets which won't be harmed by compression. 5 gal buckets for water = not bad Look for extra compartments (like where you keep the spare tire) in your car that you might otherwise not think about"
BurningMan,3blfmb,Rocketkar,2,Tue Jun 30 05:12:23 2015 UTC,Good good idea vacuum sealing the clothes. I've been using ziploc bags but the vacuum sealer is a good way to keep things fresh and prevent me from using them too early.
BurningMan,3blfmb,RTchoke,2,Tue Jun 30 15:08:46 2015 UTC,"I like to use them as laundry bags too.  Because not only does it contain your dirty duds in as small a volume as possible (who wants to fold or roll dirty shit?), but also contains the stank in your luggage/car.  edit: this only works on the manual vacuum bags that you roll/squeeze the air out of, shit outta luck if you need a mechanical pump."
BurningMan,3blfmb,ptoftheprblm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:59:03 2015 UTC,"The vacuum seal bedding bags are awesome for pillows, blankets and other bulky items like a faux fur coat and the like! You'll eat your food and drink a lot of the water you pack so you'll wind up with more room on the way home. Also would be willing to bet you could find someone with a shop vac to re vacuum seal the bedding when you're ready to pack it in and head back."
BurningMan,3blfmb,savax7,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:13:09 2015 UTC,5 gal buckets for water = not bad   Food grade buckets. Don't want chemicals leeching into your water.

BurningMan,3blfmb,ria1024,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:30:20 2015 UTC,Vacuum sealing only works if you can vacuum seal again on the playa to get everything out.

BurningMan,3blfmb,ria1024,2,Wed Jul 1 18:28:22 2015 UTC,"Depends what you pack in.  We eat most of the food, but everything else seems to take up a bit more space than it did when carefully folded & packed at home, except for empty water bottles."
BurningMan,3blfmb,yayj,3,Wed Jul 1 19:16:08 2015 UTC,"I really like the plastic 3 drawer units for my undies, socks, toiletries and snacks; not having to move bins around and dig for stuff is a good thing.

BurningMan,3blfmb,samhandwich22,2,Tue Jun 30 06:20:57 2015 UTC,I loved mine last year but I wish they made them a little more rugged. I think I accidentally stepped on one in the back of the rental truck and cracked the plastic.
BurningMan,3blfmb,i_am_pajamas,3,Tue Jun 30 15:07:46 2015 UTC,"I transported myself and another burner in my small mitsubishi mirage sedan last year, taking an incredible amount of stuff yet still had room to spare. However, I had roof racks and used those for the long and awkward items, such as the pvc pipe poles for my monkey hut shelter and fold out chairs.  I removed the floor from the trunk and left it at home, exposing the spare tire. I found that it greatly increased my storage room. Removing the cushion from the back seats (the seats themselves do not come out) also freed up space.  At target or similiar stores you can get wire frame cubbys that pull apart and reassemble with ease. They look like this: http://st.houzz.com/simgs/7431f59803409f8e_4-4750/contemporary-closet-organizers.jpg So transporting them was easy, yet yielded a large shelving system while I was on the playa! Its okay to use some bins, but when you pack them in your car, be sure that you fill the voids between them with items like clothing or food to save space. Durable plastic bags are also a great way to store and transport, they conform better to tight spaces."

Unpack your food and gear packaging at home. Ditch cardboard boxes and bubble wrap. Soft things like jackets, blankets, etc can squashed in between your luggage and to protect fragile items.  Bring a rope to set up a clothesline inside your tent. Bring lots of caribiner clips and keep stuff you use often suspended."

(Save Mart) The container-shipping is good idea but a problem with container-shipping thing is the location where your stuff will be dropped. Home Rule was on 4:45 & D last year and it's quite a walk to go there get your stuff and back to the BXB lot. But it could be a good solution. There is no communal shade in the BX lots.

BurningMan,3bj8ry,brcfire,3,Mon Jun 29 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"Congrats on being a bit further ahead than most of the newbies who post on here.   You might want to look into military C bags. It's a bigass bag that'll hold a ton of gear.  The shipping container is probably a safer bet, but there's no guarantees either way. It may be cheaper as your airline will probably add on heavy/oversize baggage fees.    Reno is a big city, you'll find water (I've been assured of this by other burners).   Suggestion on Soylent - live off of it for a week before you hit the playa. You don't want to get out there and figure out it sucks. I'm sure the people on this sub are tired of hearing this from me, but I went with this last year and it fucking ROCKED: http://www.thereadystore.com/mre-deluxe-food-and-water-supply-one-week The box on the right is just water, so no need to bring that along.   Not sure about the communal shade thing. I'd go self reliance and figure something out (bring shade cloth or silver tarps)."
BurningMan,3bj8ry,savax7,2,Mon Jun 29 18:26:11 2015 UTC,"For shade over your tent in your situation, I'd recommend aluminet or shade cloth. http://burn.life/tents.html has links to places you can buy them, pictures, etc."
BurningMan,3bj8ry,doctor-yes,2,Mon Jun 29 19:06:02 2015 UTC,"Soylent tastes best cold and needs refrigeration once mixed.  It's also pretty nasty if it goes rancid.  Keep in mind there isn't running water to clean stuff out.  Also, you'll spend a lot of time getting ice.    Unless you normally live on it, I would bring a larger variety of foods to Burning Man.    If you are looking for something shelf stable, you might also look into MREs (Meals Ready to Eat).  Some of these require cooking, but have a chemical heater.  Some taste good - some are crap.  Test them before you go to the playa.  Camping supply stores carry a bunch of prepared meals, though they are not really any better than Mac & Cheese you buy for a dollar.  Most require cooking on a stove or fire."
BurningMan,3bj8ry,randallfini,2,Tue Jun 30 00:06:49 2015 UTC,"With regard to the shipping containers... can't say how reliable that is, though it's really nice to have equipment shipped to the playa.  A friend of mine lets me FedEx boxes to him and he carries them in on a bus.  The savings of not needing a rental car more than offsets the shipping fees.    Just like checking bags, you should probably have your most critical supplies with you.  I'd carry at least 48 hours of supplies actually with you.  If there's a delay, you have time to get a ride into town to resupply or make friends who can help you out of your bind.  Make sure you have the minimal stuff from the Survival Guide.  Decorate your bin so you recognize it.  You'll feel much better being able to recognize it among the stack of them."
BurningMan,3bj8ry,randallfini,2,Tue Jun 30 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"second the aluminet over the tent but you NEED shade so you're not in your no matter what hot tent during the day. you can try staking out the excess if your tent has some height, so i'd double the footprint if you want to do that. alternatively this tri-awning is what i've taken 3 times and packs in a suitcase 25""x5"" stuff size. playa tested and abuts nicely against a tent w/ aluminet over the both of them. even one person can put it up and in high winds it just bows down and then bounces back up. for extra security when away from camp i free one of the poles from the grommets and lay it down flat and put a water jug on it. bonus it only needs 3 rebar."

BurningMan,3bh04x,FCB_TB,7,Mon Jun 29 12:42:19 2015 UTC,One thing I've never understood about the position on ashing is how can one reconcile not allowing ash from a cigarette to hit the ground when you've got hundreds (thousands?) of tons of burning wood and other materials billowing ash into the air on a regular basis over the course of the week?
BurningMan,3bh04x,swharper79,3,Mon Jun 29 20:12:08 2015 UTC,I think its two things;   Cognitive dissonance Avoiding at least some airborne ash when burning large art is a whole lot harder than ashing into a container when smoking.

BurningMan,3bh04x,Jovankat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:02:59 2015 UTC,"Part of it is to avoid fire--there's lots of tents, fabric, etc in the city streets and it's hot and windy, cigarette ashes flying around could be a fire hazard. The big sculpture burns are out further from the camping areas, not near any tents or fabric structures. Also it helps establish good habits, encouraging people to be aware of MOOP. But seriously if someone taps ashes off a cig onto the playa it's not a huge deal, IMO."
BurningMan,3bh04x,prowlerSB,2,Mon Jun 29 22:30:45 2015 UTC,"Do cigarette ashes come from the playa?  No, no they don't.  Therefore, cigarette ashes are moop.  That makes it a big deal if you give a shit about moop on the playa."

Wait until the art car has stopped.  Unless it's really obvious that you are welcome to climb on the car, ask for permission to board the art car.  Another faux pas I see is people biking around the playa to look at all the pretty art and sculptures, but not stopping to touch and interact with it.  Most of the art projects on the playa are designed to have some degree of interactivity.  And again, if the artist doesn't intend for people to touch it, it will be obvious you shouldn't touch it.

BurningMan,3bgfqc,turd_on_aisle_six,2,Mon Jun 29 00:25:24 2015 UTC,Is this one of the ePlaya threads you've read? If not you totally should. In it we talk about 40 foot and 50 foot huts with out spines and there's a link to some instructions for that. You can do it with spines of course too. The beauty of the monkey hut design is that you can scale it up as much as you like lengthways and quite a bit widthways too.
BurningMan,3bgfqc,Jovankat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:24:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks Jovankat, but I realized I used improper terminology. I'm actually looking to make a monkey hut that's taller and wider, not just longer (I should've said ""30ft ribs"")  I hadn't seen that eplaya thread, though. Thanks for sharing."
BurningMan,3bgfqc,Jovankat,2,Mon Jun 29 01:42:24 2015 UTC,Haha I did wonder if you meant ribs not spines! The google doc link I posted in that thread is to a set of instructions for making a hut that is 50 feet long and 20 feet wide with a rib length of 30 feet. Check it out it may be just what you need!
BurningMan,3bgfqc,Jovankat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:53:17 2015 UTC,Killing it! Do you have any opinion about whether going spineless with static rope would be better than relying on single/multiple pic spines?
BurningMan,3bgfqc,MountainWookie,3,Mon Jun 29 02:14:07 2015 UTC,As long as you have the room for the guy lines out either end and don't mind having them I'd say spineless is the way to go.   I just generally recommend against using regular PVC connectors because they are known for being unreliable. They're made out of different plastic to the pipes and are more brittle. They also aren't designed for the stress of the pipe being curved like the ribs are so that pressure can break them. The pipes can also just pop out of them easily.  The way to do connectors if you do go with a spine (or if you need to join lengths to get the right rib length) is to use sheaths made from the next size PVC pipe up. A sheath of about 18 inches covering 9 inches of each of the pipes you're joining then held in place somehow will be a lot more secure than a regular connector. You can hold the sheath in place with a good quality tape but after a week in the sun (or several as the years go on) that can get gross. If you have the time bolting through the pipe and sheath is a better option. If you're doing ribs the tension of the curved pipe bent against the inner walls of the sheath helps to hold everything together. For that reason we only bolted one side of each sheath. So our three piece ribs were made of two pipes with sheathes permanently bolted to them and one pipe that went between them and was held in place by tension.   Because the spine isn't under that same tension you'll want to bolt or tape each side of the sheath. Or you could run a rope down the centre of the hut to compress it and hold it all together but once you're doing that you're awfully close to having the rope instead of spine option...  Basically the rope instead of spine method requires less off playa prep work and less PVC to transport. It does take a little more time to set up on playa though but not that much
BurningMan,3bgfqc,Jovankat,2,Mon Jun 29 02:35:51 2015 UTC,"Another way to connect the ribs and the spines together is to use a bike inner tube and lash them together. The rubber on the inner tube is super grippy so it holds everything in place but also allows some flex when it gets really windy. For the regular size monkey hut I use 2 10 ft 1"" PVC to make 1 rib. They are connected together using a sheath of 1 1/4"" PVC that is 3 ft long. Then I just have 1 10 ft 1"" PVC for the spine and lash the spine to each rib using tubes. It's super easy to set up. For the tubes I use a carabiner for each one to connect the ends together for the lashing instead of tying... again it's easier. I've also been thinking about scaling this design up to 30 ft ribs and using 2 spines to stabilize everything."
BurningMan,3bgfqc,Jovankat,2,Mon Jun 29 14:27:56 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah, that's true, regular rope works to just not as well and knowing how to lash things properly is more important. I was more talking about end to end joins than cross joins."

BurningMan,3bgfqc,noalias,2,Mon Jun 29 18:30:25 2015 UTC,"Great advice on this thread! Has convinced me to go spineless for my monkey hut plan. Just going to use rope for the spine and anchored to the playa fore and aft, no need for couplings pipes and fittings. All the strain will be on the rope and the whole structure will be more flexible."
BurningMan,3bgfqc,ozzballz,2,Mon Jun 29 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"Our spineless monkey hut, based off of original monkey hut plans and updated to be spineless by our camp mate, were fantastic last year. We used tarps that were dark green on one side and a reflective silver on the other. Put the reflective side out and we stayed not only relatively cool all week, but we also stayed completely dry during the rainstorm at the beginning of the week."
BurningMan,3bgfqc,ozzballz,2,Mon Jun 29 18:44:14 2015 UTC,"Our monkey hut last year was 6x 30' pvc ribs, made from 3x 10' pvc pipes each. Each rib had a center piece with the connecter already glued/taped onto each end, + two side pieces that were slid into place on-playa. This way there was no taping/guing needed on-playa, we just slipped them in, and we could still transport everything as 10' pieces. Setup was under an hour, and a lot of that was tying the tarp onto the ribs, which required a ladder (luckily provided by the camp next door).  We had no rigid spines, but we did have 2x ropes running along the top of the structure (wrapped/tied along each rib) and then guyed down at each opening. This setup worked pretty well, but in the high winds (and after a few days of the PVC slowly bending) we started to get some issues with the sides of the ribs bowing and coming toward each other. We tied another rope onto all the ribs lower along the windward side to keep the ribs adequately spaced, and this helped, but it would have been better to have more rope, ideally in a zigzag or X pattern to rigidify the squares of rib-rope-rib-ground."

Dear Secretary Jewell,   I'm writing you to express my displeasure regarding the fees requested by the Winnemucca's office of the BLM to the Burning Man organization for our event this year. I am not affiliated directly with the organization, but as our community values civic responsibility highly I felt it was my duty to reach out to you directly.   Certainly Burning Man has enjoyed a long partnership with the BLM and the surrounding community. As Nevada Senator Reid has commented recently, our event contributes $35 millions dollars to the local economy annually. While Senator Reid is accurate in his figures, he failed to mention the contributions to the surrounding community such as the donated solar grid in Gerlach and Lovelock.   Our event is also founded on the principles of personal and environmental responsibility- something that I would hope your organization would also cherish, as it is tasked with protecting our national lands. Many of us who attend this event cherish the land where it is held, and it saddens me to see greed tarnish what could otherwise be a mutually beneficial relationship.   In recent years fees for the event have risen sharply from $858,000 in 2011 to an estimated 5.2 million in 2015. Certain the event is grown from a 50K population cap in 2011 to a 70k population cap for 2015- but it's hard to see how a less than 50% growth in our population size warrants a 600% increase in fees.   Particularly disturbing is the request this year for the luxury accommodations called the Blue Pit. I can't see how any rational person would consider this a fair and reasonable use of government funds.   I implore you to please address these concerns reasonably and swiftly.   Thank you for your time and consideration,"

However, this year's design is unique in some significant ways -- as Dan Swain, the architect, would point out, the highest point of a building is very rarely the entrance, for ""common-sense architectural reasons"".  Typically thew highest point is at or near the middle.  There is a singularity about the Temple of Promise design that's going to be very unique to experience, and an interesting contrast to the more ""filigree-detailed"" style we associate with Best. Best's Temples echo (in a good way) things we've seen in the regular world, and (as this video illustrates) can sit amongst other buildings in the way that you might, for example, find a Temple on a side-street in China (like so : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqF0PO1LX6k ). This year's design has a real ""only at Burning Man"" aspect to it, of a clear and simple design rising out of a wide open space."

It's not really Burning Man's fault- take any group of 70k people, someone might die in any given week.  But the year the event was held on private land on the Hulapai flat, the death of a participant caused some sort of legal liability issue that made them swear they'd never hold the event on private land again."
BurningMan,3b8n9a,mudclub,-3,Sat Jul 4 04:25:49 2015 UTC,"It would be way more expensive to move the event.  There is years of accumulated infrastructure sitting close to the event, for the BMORG, theme camps, and individuals alike. I personally know tons of people who keep an RV or Trailer up there and pay a local to Gerlach to maintain it, a few camps that have containers stored, and multiple art cars that are staged 30-45 minutes away on ranches and private land.  The Black Rock Desert is practically the only place the event could be at this point."
BurningMan,3b8n9a,Rotationation,7,Fri Jun 26 23:56:31 2015 UTC,"$5M will hire a whole lot of trucks.  If the fees stay as they are or keep climbing, we're 4 years from $20M and that's a whole lot more trucks."
BurningMan,3b8n9a,doctor-yes,-1,Sat Jun 27 00:05:41 2015 UTC,"I've seen some of the stuff up around the desert. It's not that simple, unfortunately. Only somewhat recently has the Black Rock Ranch gotten slightly ""organized"", and that's just the official stuff. It would require tons of trucks to just move that, and then you get to the dismantled art cars, the camps that kind of just leave their shit in a house in Gerlach, not to mention the tons and tons of trailers and RV's just chilling in the area.   I feel like it would cost not only millions of dollars, but it would require a massive volunteer effort working full time year round just to clean up and get things moving... not just on the BMORGs part, but on the part of tons of individuals and theme camps to move their shit. It would definitely kill Gerlach, as I understand it, since we are what keeps it afloat after the Gypsum mine closed in Empire.  If fees got that high, I could see it happening, but it wouldn't be pretty. I'm not quite sure how some of the stuff out there would move... some art cars were pretty much constructed simply to move around the event and then back and forth from the desert. Camps without big budgets who have storage containers sitting on land out there would need to figure out what to do. Not to mention, the income stream for tons of locals who rent out land for storage and maintenance would be completely zero'd.  I have a feeling Burning Man is there to stay, and if the desert became unusable due to BLM, that might just be the end of the event for at least a few years. There are tons of logistical reasons, beyond the storage of infrastructure, that make the playa the perfect (only) place to go.  I just don't think it's truly feasible. There is definitely a lot of stuff that isn't local to Gerlach/Reno that would have no problems moving around to a new event, for sure, but there is a large number of things just hanging out waiting for the event each year.  Hell, I know more than one house in Gerlach that is owned by Burners just for storage and camp usage."
BurningMan,3b8n9a,macegr,2,Sat Jun 27 01:06:10 2015 UTC,"No offense, but you're misunderstanding the work the Org has put in over the years building things like transportation plans with local governments, etc. There are a lot of intangibles that add up to an incredible amount of inertia in terms of keeping the event where it's at. That's not to say it couldn't be moved, but the idea of doing so is more than the apparent sum of its parts."

Those porta pots are the burning man porta pots, they don't get used for anything else all year so presumably they're stored pretty locally.   And before you suggest finding a new supplier that idea was raised back in the early 2000's when United were threatening not to do the event again the following year. The porta pot industry is very tight knit and the other suppliers wouldn't take up where United left off without their blessing.   And without enough porta pots there couldn't be an event.   That's just one element of what the Borg looks after that would need to be re-orchestrated.   That said I work in the event industry and I see ""impossible"" things done all the time so I have a lot of faith in the power of production logistics and creative problem solving.

My point is that there are millions of dollars being spent to keep the event where it is, and the trend for the past few years has been for those millions to become more millions with no beneficial effect for the event itself.  Those millions of dollars, if redirected toward relocating the event, would make a huge impact, especially if they result in potential multi-million dollar land-use savings every year.  Just for kicks, I went to https://www.unitedmayflower.com/portable-storage-mover/compare-uhaul-moving.html and got a quote to move a container between Reno and SF.  I did not shop around - for the scale of the job in question, I suspect the cost would be much, much lower, esp. because the containers are already owned and packed by the org, et al.    The number it spit out was <$3200.  While I realize this is a meaningless number, $5M works out to over 1,550 containers moved between those two cities.  As I said, $5M will move a whole lot of containers around."
BurningMan,3b8n9a,w_larsen,8,Sat Jun 27 17:28:33 2015 UTC,"So, obviously, these demands seem above and beyond what is actually necessary.   However, the specificity of the request is not too outrageous. The government ought to be extremely specific with its requests. Consider that the BLM staff are employees of the government, and the government has a responsibility to its employees. Burning Man is not a camping trip for these people. It is business trip. Imagine if you went on a business trip to a dangerous place with the expectation that there would be food, and the food ended up being Ramen noodles. Can you survive? Surely. But it wouldn't really meet your expectations as an employee. Hence, specific instructions designed to make the business trip less bad than it otherwise might be.   I'm not saying that their request is reasonable, per se, but I think its important to remember that BLM employees aren't on vacation. They are on a business trip to an extraordinarily inhospitable place, and are incredibly dependant on the facilities and amenities provided to them in order to survive and do their job."

This is exactly the type of stuff you'd find in the staff-catering area at any multi-day outdoor event.  It sounds crazy because it's burning man, but if this was the stuff that the police/whoever were asking for at some music festival, somebody would just have checked it off like ""yep, standard food stuff.""

And it's obvious when requesting something so elaborate to be set up to be used by officials for a 36 hour period that they are willfully wasting BLM money and Burning Man Org money.  It reminds me of when the President flies to a war zone and extreme measures are taken for comforts not afforded to everyone else.  It just screams about the whole situation ""This is Fake."""
BurningMan,3b6wv2,Ruleryak,12,Fri Jun 26 15:48:50 2015 UTC,"I liked how Abbey worded it.   ""Having been a career BLM employee, I expect agency employees to behave competently and professionally in their interactions with the public,"" Abbey said in his email. ""I don't see these traits being applied in their dealings with (Black Rock City).""   Nice way to say ""you're incompetent and unprofessional"" to the current BLM folks.  [Edit] I should note I think the bulk of the actual BLM officers out there, especially the ones that request assignment to the burn, are good folks doing a tough job and exercising their best judgement.  Most interactions with the public at the event are positive - it just seems like the leadership is at odds with the event"
BurningMan,3b6wv2,reasonweb,5,Fri Jun 26 16:29:33 2015 UTC,I've only had a couple of interactions with BLM officers out there and they were nothing but positive.   This strikes me as being a small number of officials at the top of the food chain pushing for something that the BLM officers that actually work out there aren't nearly as interested in.
BurningMan,3b6wv2,Treebeezy,3,Fri Jun 26 17:21:02 2015 UTC,Agree.  Abbey very eloquently called them out for requesting completely exorbitant facilities.  Every BLM employee+volunteer I've encountered has been great.    And agree with /u/reasonweb that the upper echelon BLM management thinks they can squeeze more cash or just put a strain on Burning Man Org for no good reason.     And now they've incited the wrath of 18th century warlord Harry Reid.  beat it Nerds.

BurningMan,3b6wv2,prelimar,13,Fri Jun 26 14:48:44 2015 UTC,"Harry Reid's letter to BLM about this is great...   I read today the account in the Reno Gazette-Journal of the unprecedented and extravagant requests allegedly being made by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as conditions for permitting Burning Man for their annual event in September 2015. Burning Man has been held in the Black Rock Desert for 23 years and, in addition to the untold cultural benefits that the annual festival brings to Nevada, the event contributes an estimated $35 million to Nevada's Economy each year.

BurningMan,3b6wv2,Cassaroll168,25,Fri Jun 26 22:35:02 2015 UTC,"As the event has changed and grown over time, Burners have worked to keep the BLM happy for years and years and years.  As Burners we go out of our way to do the following:   We are courteous and polite in the face of vigilant (and arguably aggressive) BLM Ranger traffic and drug interdiction; We regulate what comes into Black Rock City at the Gayte and Perimeter; We police ourselves inside Black Rock City with the Black Rock Rangers; We provide our own volunteer medical and paid EMT's for medical emergencies; We leave no trace when the event ends; and As most burners are citizens of the United States we collectively own and share all the BLM land with each other.   And in the face of all that some bureaucrats in Salt Lake City and Washington, D.C. cite some ""concerns about safety after a woman was run over and killed by a vehicle last year"" as a reason to ring up the BMORG for a $1 million+ dollar turnkey VIP camp called Blue Pit?  To top it off, most of the government bureaucrats who plan to attend will only be going to the event for a day or a day and half?    As Burners we work so hard to appease the BLM, and in return the BLM shits on us by demanding a turnkey camp for bureaucrats?  I hope the BMORG can stand up the BLM and say no to the BLM's request."
BurningMan,3b6wv2,scots,28,Fri Jun 26 14:54:57 2015 UTC,"Why can't we just move the event next year? Go somewhere that's private land owned by the BMORG like they do with Bonnaroo? Fuck the BLM, fuck Nevada. Let's go to Washington or Colorado and have legal weed at the event! So much bullshit averted."
BurningMan,3b6wv2,directional_delta,8,Fri Jun 26 19:27:53 2015 UTC,"I upvoted this to offset the people apparently frightened by change.  Burners need to look inwardly and ask themselves what makes the event special.  Is it just the playa, or is the culture that has grown around the event?    Black Rock Desert is centrally located to absolutely nothing.  It makes it fantastically difficult and expensive for the vast majority of the US population - everyone living East of the Mississippi  river - to attend the event.    Many large festivals sidestep government bullshit  by simply renting land from private landowners, typically farmers or ranchers.    If you advertised a $1-2 million dollar fee to rent 10,000 acres of someones ranch or farm for a month, you'd have to subcontract a call center to handle the volume of replies.  And that would probably get you land more centrally located to the entire U.S., less than an hours' drive to a major interstate and a large regional or international airport."
BurningMan,3b6wv2,scots,2,Fri Jun 26 20:46:28 2015 UTC,"Is there a short list of likely location candidates? I mean there must be, does anyone know what they might be?"
BurningMan,3b6wv2,Cassaroll168,11,Fri Jun 26 21:27:14 2015 UTC,"Given the BLMs recent behavior - demands for $1 million dollar VIP facilities, and federal land usage fees that have literally quadrupled in less than five years, drastically outstripping the attendance figures for the event - it would be absolutely foolish of BMOrg to not begin seriously researching the possibility of a new site as a Plan B hedge to guarantee uninterrupted operation for future events.   ""In case of douchebaggery, break glass. "".   Which would you rather hear?  1, to offset increasing costs, tickets for 2016 will cost 3x as much as this years tickets.   -OR-  2, The Bureau of Land  Management  got pissed off at our refusing their VIP building, made  phony excuses about safety and refused to issue a 2016 permit.  Sorry everyone, the event is canceled.   -OR-   3, "" ... in 2015, we- BMOrg- carefully researched site options, considering interstate access, proximity to nearby regional airports, geographic central location, and sent media kits to a dozen ranchers and farmers carefully explaining the rich history and culture of the festival, what to expect should they host us, insurance and security costs, statement of work for all cleanup, and the fees we would be willing to pay. Nine ranchers responded favorably, and a site was chosen.   Burning Man- ""Metamorphosis"" will occur on the 23,000 acre private Flying J Ranch in INSERTSTATE NAMEHERE, located only 47 minutes off Interstate 80, in a remote area with only 2 ranch houses in a 50 mile radius. Crystal clear views of the night stars are common on this fifth generation family ranch. Prairie conditions belie the fact that CITYNAME , population 300,000 is only 1 hour and 15 minutes away by car, with STATEROUTE and INTERSTATE 80 providing easy access to the large, 3-carrier regional airport. ""  Let's see .. Increase ticket prices to offset federal asshole tactics,  .. Lose the permit and/or cancel the event,  .. Or be proactive and secure your future. IF needed.   Hey guys, let's put the Wiley coyote genius hat on here. Don't pay the federal government $5 million dollars to use the black rock playa.   Buy $5 million dollars worth of scrub ranch land from a private party, sign a contract allowing them to continue running cattle on it - FREE- 10 months out of the year in exchange for them allowing use of access roads and putting up with the adjacent noise for a week- and everyone wins.  Future guaranteed. Private land. PRIVATE LAND!"
BurningMan,3b6wv2,scots,4,Fri Jun 26 22:01:54 2015 UTC,Seconded! Private land FTW!
BurningMan,3b6wv2,marssaxman,2,Fri Jun 26 23:01:22 2015 UTC,"Do you want an example?  There is information online claiming that the current total area used by BMOrg is 7 square miles.   There are 640 acres per square mile, so Burning Man is using about  4,480 acres of land.   Here is a 4,500 acre plot of ranch land for sale  priced at $3,187,500 - far less than the BLMs permitting fee + vip building.    It is nearly equidistant from Oklahoma City, Dallas or Albuquerque  at 3/4/5 hours by car.   It's a southern state, with warm temperatures nearly identical to the experience and challenges provided by the playa.   I found this in 2 minutes. The BMOrg people using a team to do due diligence in a careful search could find similar parcels with better proximity to major highways and airports."
BurningMan,3b6wv2,pacificmint,3,Sat Jun 27 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"There really aren't many places like the playa. There are many places one could hold a large festival, but a different location would be a different kind of experience, and some of the things we've all grown to know and love wouldn't be possible."

All those things you mentioned can be how policing is done in the real world instead of, you know, just shooting people. And in some places that is the case, the cliche of the good looking young beat cop giving directions, taking collection of a lost wallet, just generally being a visible positive presence in the community etc is  (and should be) a form/style of policing.  In Amsterdam the police are a lot like Black Rock Rangers.

BurningMan,3b6wv2,D3s3rtDw3ll3r,3,Fri Jun 26 19:16:44 2015 UTC,"A few things:  You can see the BLM complex on the satellite map. It's northwest of the greeter's station along the fenceline. Last year it was huge.   Last year was also the first time, I believe, that the BLM didn't eat in the staff commissary (which is off of 5:30 in the city.) You can see a large white tent on the southwest side of the trailer circle. There's a couple of refrigerated semi trailers backed into it. There are 4 dumpsters for their trash below it. That was their private commissary.   You may know that BM is big on recycling and that they have a trash crew that helps separate things out.  Not many know that they were not allowed into BLM's kitchen tent during meal times in case they overheard any 'shop talk'. So those folks on the trash crew had to go out there 3 times a day and sort the trash. At first, in the hot sun, until BMorg built some shelter for them to do it in.   So the BLM didn't mix with the event staff as they usually do. It was a big shift in the way things had been, and their complex was much bigger than previous years.   Edit: Google's showing me Black Rock City from 2013, but the above link is for 2014."

BurningMan,3b6wv2,-ghostinthemachine-,5,Fri Jun 26 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"So let me understand this -  BMOrg is thumbing their noses at the federal agency responsible for permitting their use of the Black Rock playa.     Yeah.  This will end well.    Solution:  Advertise in agriculture and farming magazines for ranchers or farmers that own large tracts (thousands of acres plus) that would be overjoyed to skip a year of barely break-even corn or soybean crop, and instead deposit a check of equal or larger value for doing.. nothing.    This is essentially what the Insane Clown Posse does when they hold their ""Gathering of the Juggalos"" - they rent from large, private landowners.    Hey folks, it worked for Woodstock.  (The original.)  I'll be blasted for saying this, but truthfully - There are probably sites in the plains states that are very remote, yet significantly closer to a major interstate, regional or international airport, medical services, shopping, and other considerations.    As a compromise, if necessary bmorg could lease a dozen of those 26 foot campers complete with air conditioning, a bathroom, kitchenette, gas stove, park them in a circle and roll a diesel generator on a skid off a truck in the middle of them along with four 250-gallon skid mounted diesel fuel tanks, and call it done.  House the VIPs in those, keep your permit, fed feathers smoothed over.    Or, fuck them, and call Ted Turner, who owns private ranches all over the U.S."
BurningMan,3b6wv2,marssaxman,3,Fri Jun 26 14:32:07 2015 UTC,"Meh, karma...I feel like I've watched BMORG try to convince us that VIP ticketing and turnkey camps are a positive thing for a couple years now.   I went to a Burning Man event at Soho House in Los Angeles and watched as Maid Marian and Larry basically recruited these people and offered them an opportunity to buy tickets when the event was already sold out. It was hella disappointing.   They don't like this because they're not getting to choose who the VIPs are and it's not lining their pockets. This is extortion, but I don't feel bad for them at all."
BurningMan,3b6wv2,Jovankat,2,Fri Jun 26 20:34:45 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound like the Blue Pit will be within the Burning Man grounds, but down the road some.    From the article  The headquarters will be located at the end of the 12-mile playa entry road, 12 miles north of Gerlach. The Blue Pit compound is about two miles past the playa on County Road 34 near an old gravel pit.  Is that right?  If they were squarely in the middle of the map I would be pissed, though.  If they could just step off their air-conditioned edifice onto the festival I would also have a problem with.    Well, the expense is maddening."

But it's windy and dusty everywhere so get ready to deal."
BurningMan,3b8kti,markday,5,Fri Jun 26 21:07:02 2015 UTC,"I have a minor gripe about recent temple construction volunteering.  The mantra I keep hearing is ""we need people on weekdays"".  I've taken time off work twice to come in on weekday afternoons/evenings on top of showing up for one or two days each of the last 3 of 4 weekends.    Last week, I took time off on whichever night turned out to be meeting night (a mistake I won't make again), and convinced a new burner friend to come out at well.  It was a clusterfuck.  There were a ton of people milling about (staff waiting for the meeting, presumably) and another dozen who were in for a tour of some sort.    When we got there, there were maybe half a dozen people working; one on the planers, a couple on saws and/or assembly, and that was about it.  I suggested to (build lead that evening - I can't remember his name offhand) that I train my friend on gluing/forming and asked if there were any new requirements.  Build lead was off doing other things, so we busied ourselves with general cleanup and prep of the station.  Cue spinning wheels for another 20 minutes until build lead deigned to set us loose.  We finally get to work.  An hour or so later, the tour began, and it spent another solid 20 minutes squarely in the middle of the area we were working in, preventing us from getting anything done, and the build lead knew damned well we were working right there.  There was no good reason in a warehouse that size to have your tour wrap-up discussion smack in the middle of an active work area.  Eventually, most of the other millers-about fucked off to their meeting, and I got disgusted, did a bunch of general cleanup, and left (but not before the fire truck showed up for, I think, the second time that week.  You're going to get your asses shut down and fined if you keep firing up that burn barrel.)  I skipped last weekend out of frustration, and I can't imagine that I'll take time out to come in on another weekday.  I think the profound lack of organization/attention/respect has driven off my friend as well.  TL;DR:  If you're going to beg for volunteers, don't waste their time.  Weekends are generally fine - there are plenty of people around to direct work, cope with volunteers, etc, but that night was a bad joke.  I'll probably be back on the occasional weekend, but it's no longer a priority.  And lest you think this is princess fit-pitching, all I needed was the go-ahead to work on gluing, a detail of any new requirements for doing so, and to be left alone to work, but that was way too hard.  We were there over 3 hours, barely managed to get an hours' work done, and finally left in disgust.  Goddamn, I'm getting angry typing this."
BurningMan,3b8kti,mudclub,3,Fri Jun 26 22:32:42 2015 UTC,If you want an alternative you could come over to AmSteel. The crew there is smaller and there are less tasks so it's kinda simpler. Also there's constantly sparks of molten metal flying through the air. It's rad.

BurningMan,3b8kti,mudclub,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:34:31 2015 UTC,"I should also add that the days that people are there to actually work have been excellent - the crew is great, all of the stations keep busy, and tons of staff and volunteers are chugging away all over the place.

BurningMan,3b8kti,solaronzim,2,Sat Jun 27 00:02:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry you had a bad experience. I guess the flow must've been off that day, which happens on any build that I've been on. Yesterday we built four arches. Super productive day. If there were more people we probably could've done another 2 or 3 arches before we reached our space capacity. But then again we have expanded our space even further. I am not responsible for volunteers as I am just building things but I have noticed that some days are better than others. I could also be biased because I was fed cookies.   Oh and yes the burn barrel is gone."

What you need is slow, increasing and prolonged exposure.  If you can handle looking at a clown picture, look at it one day. The next dry to double the amount of time you can look at the clown. If you can get to about 10 minutes, step it up and go to a place and walk by a clown. If you can handle that, watch the clown for a minute. Then add time.  It's about exposure to train your body into realizing that this stimulus shouldn't illicit the response.  Gone through my own issues with phobias. Eventually I got fed up and did everything I could that could involve being exposed to heights and I got over it.  Big disclaimer: I'm not a professional. Your level of impairment may differ. But, mine, I couldn't walk within five feet of the railings on the second floor of the mall without my legs starting to give out.  I also can't speak for your level of tolerance for exposure. Some people need a slower pace than I had. Some people have issues that can't be solved without professional help and/or anti-anxiety meds. Either way, it's a bad idea to just go around hiding clown masks around the house"

BurningMan,3b4dl1,Ruleryak,3,Thu Jun 25 21:52:05 2015 UTC,Why?  I'm not sure I like it either because fundraisers generate a lot of discussion and I think confining them all to one thread might limit that.
BurningMan,3b4dl1,Jovankat,6,Thu Jun 25 21:54:07 2015 UTC,Coupla reasons:   I tend to read stickied/monthly/etc threads once and then ignore them forevermore.   I think each fundraiser deserves its own discussion/thread. I think each fundraiser deserves whatever visibility it can drum up based on its own merits. To guarantee that /u/markday has no idea what my internal policies are.
BurningMan,3b4dl1,mudclub,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:34:53 2015 UTC,"We've been talking about a fundraiser thread for a while.  Sure it could be done better. But, saves the clutter.

BurningMan,3b427g,mudclub,3,Thu Jun 25 20:30:29 2015 UTC,"The main mod I did was trying different containers. The biggest issue I ran into was getting the hose positioned so that the filters would be properly soaked but water wouldn't end up on the playa.  Fan specs are also quite important. I tried just grabbing the highest airflow fan from the neighbourhood computer store and it didn't cut it. You don't necessarily need the exact model that Figjam uses, but it's a good idea to take the time to research fans and order a good one online."

Gallery here: http://imgur.com/a/Lq1ah  FANS: Sensflow (Delta) server fans they pull 1.5amps based on the label.Couple of protips. Server fans will be high CFM. PC case fans are designed to be quieter usually, and will likely have lower CFM. Delta brand fans are known to be HIGH CFM fans. They will be kind of loud but it's not too bother some in an already loud enviroment. The white noise kind of block most other sound out so you may like that.    DUCTING: All from.the hardware store. Tin couplers. Silver Jambro 400 Series flex dryer ducting. Worm clamps that came with the couplers. The nice thing about the dual ducts beyond having two fans, is each person gets cooler air in the Yurt. Also the air streams meet up at an angle and then mix the air streams around the hexayurt.    FLOAT SWITCH: Sea Flow. It's meant to be used with a boat bilge pump (higher amp draw). You wont need a relay, it can be wired in line. It will fit in the bottom of the bucket but it's tight. Make sure it will turn on/off with the correct water level, shim one side to accomplish this. Not too hard. Most smaller float switches will need a relay, or you will burn them up."

BurningMan,3b427g,theseekerofbacon,3,Thu Jun 25 22:43:14 2015 UTC,"I used figjam's version, but with a smaller fan, and managed to run it all directly from a 8"" by 16"" solar panel (no battery). It automatically turned on and off with the sun, and I didn't have to worry about charging and lugging around a deep cycle battery!"
BurningMan,3b427g,P_Schrodensis,2,Thu Jun 25 21:32:16 2015 UTC,Can you share more details on your setup?  I'm thinking of doing something very similar.
BurningMan,3b427g,OnwardLevvy,2,Thu Jun 25 21:49:18 2015 UTC,"I used the highest CFM computer fan I could find that would run on ~1 amp, and a cheap ""solar water fountain"" pump. I then hooked it all up to the solar panel that I tied to the roof of my yurt. I used a piece of clothes dryer ducting to route the cold air in the yurt, blowing cold air near the head out our bed, and the rest of the design (5 gal bucket + cooler pad) is basically figjam's (someone posted a link in another comment here). Note that it wasn't super powerful, more of a cool breeze on our faces while we slept."
BurningMan,3b427g,P_Schrodensis,3,Thu Jun 25 22:11:53 2015 UTC,"I built this based on one of figjams designs. It runs on 110v though, and is super powerful.

BurningMan,3b427g,Crocketteer,2,Sat Jun 27 02:35:00 2015 UTC,"No, thats all I have. It is basically what you see there though, plus a pump in the bottom. I use some metal strap bent into a C shape to keep the padding pressed against the grates, as the fan tends to suck them inward. The box fan goes into a hole cut into the side of a hexayurt.  It uses around 0.5 gallon per hour on normal usage (fan on low) and holds around 2.5 gallons in the bottom. It only needs to be on for a few hours a day to keep it nice and cool, but I run the fan 24/7 usually, just not the water."
BurningMan,3b427g,sillycyco,2,Sat Jun 27 03:47:28 2015 UTC,"One mod I did was use some insulated flexible ducting left over from our furnace.  PVC certainly works, but this stuff is insulated and probably a bit better.  It's made to push hot air in a cold attic or cold air in a hot attic.

BurningMan,3b427g,sillycyco,2,Fri Jun 26 00:28:06 2015 UTC,"It will work on a tent, it just will not work as efficiently as an insulated and sealed structure. If nothing else it will certainly provide ventilation. Shading your tent will work much better at keeping it cool though, so try to get that going first."
BurningMan,3b427g,Maggiemayday,2,Fri Jun 26 01:36:38 2015 UTC,"A shaded tent, yes.  We have a small tent under a carport.  With the swamp cooler snorkel hose (dryer vent hose in vinyl) pointing in the door (door slightly unzipped), and the back window slightly unzipped, it got so cool in there in the afternoon while I was napping, I had to pull the heavy blanket over me."
BurningMan,3b427g,lshiva,2,Fri Jun 26 04:17:10 2015 UTC,"In addition to providing cool air, it's also humid air. Perhaps it's a coincidence, but I had significantly fewer issues with dry sinuses and hang nails the first year I used a swamp cooler for my tent."
BurningMan,3b427g,pugworthy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:25:06 2015 UTC,"One other thing I did on mine (which is basic Figjam 101 style).  I got a big 400mm PC fan that pushes a LOT of air.  The more air you push, the more fresh you're getting in the structure.    Think of it this way.  If your yurt is 10x10x10, that's 1000 square feet.  If your fan pushes 50 CFM (cubic feet per minute), it's 20 minutes of fan time to totally recycle the air once.  I mean if it was pushing 1000 CFM you got a problem as it's probably going to blow the door off, but if it's 10 you know the air will be pretty stale."

Nah, mine does 2500 CFM on high (supposedly!) and while it does provide positive pressure in the yurt, it is very nice inside and the door stays shut if you have a latch. It will blow the door open without something holding it closed though."
BurningMan,3b427g,Le3f,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:35:03 2015 UTC,The positive pressure must be a nice dust deterrent.
BurningMan,3b427g,sillycyco,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:33:17 2015 UTC,"Ya it works great, but I only run it on high when I first turn it on to quickly cool things. It will eat 2-3 gallons of water an hour on high. On low it is closer to 1000 CFM. The wet pad inside filters out the dust coming in as well, even when the water isn't running."

I know we have the white shrink wrapped piping on corners as well, but those too have been getting stolen and/or covered completely by decorations. (this is also something people should not do.)

BurningMan,3aybcd,pugworthy,3,Wed Jun 24 18:00:49 2015 UTC,"So I think the thing you need to answer is, what do you want your yurt for?  Is it more for storing personal stuff and sleeping, or is it going to be a communal space?   If it's the former, then I'll say two 6' stretch yurts is fine, one for the couple and one for the other two.  If you want communal, then go big.  Last year for two of us (my daughter and I), had a 6' stretch for cloths, personal stuff and sleeping, and our shade structure was the communal space.  For us, it was great.  We didn't cook in it, hang out in it much, etc.  It wasn't a communal space.  And we didn't care that much that it had a lower ceiling, as we were there to change cloths and sleep or just chill out with the swamp cooler.  Here was the basic layout we did...    ___________  /bbbbcccbbbb\ /1bbbb   bbbb2\ \1bbbb   bbbb2/  \_______   _/     Two beds (b), common stuff (c), and our personal stuff in the triangular ends (1 and 2).  The ASCII art makes the ends look smaller than they really were, but we both had multiple totes with lids for cloths and such.  For us, it worked out fantastic.    Also, I made it in an all hinged design, so the whole thing would fold up into a 4' by 4' by 18"" stack, which made it super easy to pack in the back of our old Previa.   So again, personal space and sleeping only, or community?  If former, two 6' stretches, if latter, you'll have to go bigger."
BurningMan,3aybcd,FullMoonRising1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:16:40 2015 UTC,What is the size of this in transport? The diagram provided was great! Do you have any instructions to go along with it?  I'm looking to build a 2-3 person yurt with room for clothes/items.
BurningMan,3aybcd,pugworthy,2,Wed Jun 24 18:40:11 2015 UTC,"When all folded up, it is 4'x4'x18"".

It's at https://flic.kr/s/aHskefTxQr  This was super easy to transport for us in the back of a Previa van with all our gear."
BurningMan,3aybcd,HotterRod,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:41:43 2015 UTC,Yurts are a waste for storing stuff. Just put it in an uninsulated tent or plastic boxes on the open playa.
BurningMan,3aybcd,pugworthy,2,Wed Jun 24 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"All we kept were clean cloths, personal hygiene, etc. inside. Stuff you want to have handy when tired and sleepy. Nothing like waking up from a nap in a swamp cooler cooled space and putting on a clean, pre-chilled linen shirt."
BurningMan,3aybcd,pugworthy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:20:33 2015 UTC,Stuck with your recommendation and made two 6' stretch yurts this weekend. Was quite pleased with how large they turned out. Thanks for posting the photos of how you packed it. Will make transport much easier!
BurningMan,3aybcd,prowlerSB,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"Excellent! The folding/packing really helps a lot. Easier to work with, hold onto, etc. Plus a lot of seams you don't have to cut and redo. I think I mentioned that I sandwiched it between two sheets of 1/2"" 4'x4' plywood which helped protect it a bit. They became a table top in camp so no waste."
BurningMan,3aybcd,ballshagger,2,Tue Jul 7 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"4 could fit in a H12 yurt but it will be tight.  2 separate yurt probably better if you want some privacy. An h12 for a couple is pretty roomy and luxurious. A 6'stretch for a couple is cozy but certainly doable. Yurts are great for sleeping in, changing clothes and storage. But prob not what you want to just ""hang out"" in during the day. It's kind of a cave.  So standing room isn't critical, IMO.  You can stand up the peak in the middle and keep the bed and storage boxes around the edges. The big concern will be transport. Yurt panels are bulky and fragile. Build the biggest ones you can afford and reasonably transport. Consider an external shade-structure for your outdoor hangout area."
BurningMan,3aybcd,OverlyPersonal,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:38:23 2015 UTC,"Having just built an 6' stretch, there's no way it's big enough for two friends unless they are really close friends. It will work for a couple, I hope, but there's not a lot of extra room for stuff.   If I were you I'd build two H15s. That will stack 30 panels high which is a lot for a roof rack. If you package it well, really strap it down to a sturdy rack and don't drive fast it should be ok. You could go with H12s, only 24 panels high, but 4 tall people will miss the extra height.   In any case order you tape ASAP."
BurningMan,3aybcd,sillycyco,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems like 6 extra panels are worth bringing if it gives a bit more height.   Could you squeeze 4 in a H15? Or way too close for comfort?"
BurningMan,3aybcd,ballshagger,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:29:34 2015 UTC,"I'd consider two stretch yurts for a total of 14 sheets.  If you have the luggage space build them 2' higher for a total of 22 between the two structures, 6' walls are an unbelievable luxury, especially if you're a little older and less flexible.  That'd be for optimal sleeping, storage and privacy though, not hanging out in.   If you want one thing for everybody (I prefer socializing outside so I'd rather just have my own) the stretch would probably be big enough.  My first year someone in camp built a gigantic pyramid and put like 6-8 people in it.  Thing even had it's own AC and car stereo system lol."

BurningMan,3aybcd,Burn-O-Matic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:58:49 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer:  Longtime wannabe birgin here who's finally going this year.  Friends with other regulars and have done lots of planning for this year.  I'm also good at and enjoy designing/building stuff.   I originally planned on a H12 for my partner and I.  After researching, planning, and pricing out all the requirements for this year and next, I finally settled on no yurt at all and bought a Kodiak tent instead.  After pricing everything out including redoing the tape in two years, extra rigging for the halo, and the requirement for a trailer rental, the price was much closer the the Kodiak (on sale).    Now that I have the Kodiak and have used it, I'm very happy my purchase.  Some key points for me vs the yurt include:   Fantastic quality and truly waterproof.  Goes up in 15 minutes.  Definitely a lifetime tent. Packs in the trunk of our sedan squeezed between other stuff.  If we choose to fly next year, it could be checked luggage. We now have a great tent for car camping and other activities outside of BM."
BurningMan,3aybcd,HotterRod,5,Wed Jun 24 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"A tent, no matter how much it's done right, will have nothing on the comfort levels provided by a hexayurt on playa.  I can also build 2-3 stretch yurts for the price of your tent, or build 1 and buy 4 disposable Colemans.  I've driven a yurt up on top of my Subaru wagon three years now with zero issues whatsoever.  I'm not saying ""fuck yer tent"" but I am saying Hexayurts are the king of playa comfort for campers."
BurningMan,3aybcd,Burn-O-Matic,2,Wed Jun 24 18:22:18 2015 UTC,"I'll agree that the tent won't be as cool or quiet, but with 100% shade coverage and a fan it will be decent enough for me. As you said below, 6' walls are a luxury, and one I enjoy that goes a long way towards comfort and usability.  Yes, you might be able to 2-3 stretch yurts (assuming 6' walls) for the price of my tent ($550 delivered).  Since mine is 140 sq feet, you would get 50% more area at best per dollar spent.  What of future costs and time for taping and repairs that will be required.  Specific to my situation, even if I felt comfortable strapping 18"" or more of foam to the roof of my focus, it would add an appreciable amount of gas usage and drive time to my already 30+ hour trip from WI  (Drag ~ v3).  Besides the adage of buy cheap, buy twice, I don't like relying on cheap, disposable gear for important things like my shelter that have a tendency to fail when being used and needed.     All else being equal, the yurt wins on comfort and initial price no doubt about it.  But IMO, that is a narrow and short sided view.  It loses on virtually all other measures including OP's first consideration:  portability and packing space, plane transport possible, durability and longevity, ease of use, no construction required, utility for other purposes, etc.  For me, it was buying a overall superior product for what I would likely spend in the next few years."

BurningMan,3aybcd,mudclub,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:14:29 2015 UTC,"I'll be under a flat top BRH style structure with a wall to the eastern rising sun.  I'm contributing a 12'x20' extension to my camp.  Even at 9:30AM, the sun's altitude angle is only 34* above the horizon in BRC during the event.  You can't rely on coverage from above unless is draped over your tent which increases heat transfer.  I'm away from home but I think the specs are pretty close.  A malleable log of 30""x16"" for the tent body and 48""x5.5"" for the poles.     Total tent volume 5.55 ft3 Closes equivalent yurt (H18 I think) 24 ft3   While my portion of the camps shade structure (8 poles, tarp, fittings) would add about 3 ft3 to the total, 10' poles definitely aren't going in/on cars for long distances.  But part of that shade is communal socializing space."
BurningMan,3aybcd,OverlyPersonal,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:13:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, you're right that if you have camp shade a canvas tent is the better choice. But if you're being radically self-reliant I'd go for the hexayurt."

BurningMan,3aybcd,Burn-O-Matic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:36:20 2015 UTC,Well stretch yurts (not the big ones) are half as many panels and a lot less tape so that kind of explains it.
BurningMan,3aybcd,pugworthy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:41:23 2015 UTC,I'll be curious to know how these handle the extreme heat and if they keep out the dust as well as a yurt.  The true test will be:  How late can you sleep in?
BurningMan,3aybcd,Burn-O-Matic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:18:39 2015 UTC,"I fully expect the tent to win out on dust.  It has fully covered zippers on all openings.  Even with my expected 100% shade from a flat top shade structure and shade from the east, it will never win on temperature.  I'll have a fan and expect to make it several hours into daylight."
BurningMan,3aybcd,pugworthy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:44:51 2015 UTC,"However, if you set up an external air source (swamp cooler), you are creating a positive air pressure space as long as you filter the incoming air. Meaning dust doesn't get in (as much). This is true of a tent too if you can set up an external air system."
BurningMan,3aybcd,mudclub,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:11:16 2015 UTC,"I think that would be true if you sealed up the opening from the swamp cooler well.  The doors, windows, and vents are sealed by canvas and metal zippers behind a ~1"" flap of canvas.  Its hard for dust to drive in.  I sprayed the thing all over with a water hose on full and nothing got in.  Of course with anything, tracking it in is going to be a problem."
BurningMan,3aybcd,Crocketteer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:31:27 2015 UTC,"Yup I think any time you have filtered air being pushed in from outside, you're good.  Our yurt had a cat flap type hinged door held shut by gravity, and it would slightly be open all the time from the incoming air pushing it a bit.  It doesn't matter how the air gets out, as long as it can (and won't start coming in if the fan goes off)."
BurningMan,3aybcd,prowlerSB,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:44:16 2015 UTC,"Kodiaks are damned near dust-proof.    Being canvas, they suffer a little less than standard tents from sun exposure, but you won't be sleeping much past sunrise without shade or additional cooling."

I think you could easily sleep four people in a H12, H15, or H18 hexayurt, depending on the desired ceiling height and how many 1"" (or thicker for H18) panels you can fit in your trailer or on your roof.  You'll want to wrap your pre-cut panels tightly in a big tarp or pallet wrap to avoid them getting damaged in transit or pieces blowing off on the highway.  Consider a swamp cooler to offset the body heat of four people, and perhaps a curtain room divider for privacy (if you care about such things).  Both of these are covered in the above linked guide.

I usually don't bring a full length mirror so this helps because I already know what everything looks like together.

I always end up veering more towards simple street clothes for comfort and ""hurry up let's go do shit!"" reasons so definitely keep in mind comfort and effort factors.

What would happen if they didn't sell ice is that basically every camp would bring a generator and some kind of fridge.

After Americans and Canadians Aussies are probably the best represented nationality on the playa. Except maybe the French.   And that's just the ones who make the trek out for the Nevada regional. There's also the Seeders, Blazers and whatever we're calling the Modifyre folk.   Sounds like you need to come to 'Straya Day on playa and meet some folk!

I've been going for 5 years, i have my camp and i love it, I don't go there to socialize with other Aussies typically. But yeah there are a few communities excitedly building regionals here, I just don't get the time off work to do both so I focus on the main burn so when I've tried to connect found we don't have much in common. Also in saying that, most burners from Australia I've met come from Byron Bay or elsewhere in Sydney, where as i'm from Melbourne"

OP you might be lucky enough to find someone selling an extra ticket  who needs a VP but you'd be well served by waiting a few weeks till more folk actually have their tickets.

This year I have directed tickets, and I'm hearing rumblings about pre-sales going out.  I haven't heard anything about my tickets from the org yet but they should be next in the queue based on when they went on sale."

Although now I think about it I think there was actually a glitch with his order.  I do definitely remember that there was a couple of weeks difference between the first pair of DGS tickets arriving and the rest in my former camp. It was awkward because the couple whose address they were all being shipped to split up between the final address change date and mail out and there was some nervousness about that working out, which it totally did once they all arrived."

Segways fall under this, they are stand up vehicles.  Scooters with a seat must be registered and are generally not allowed; registered as handicapped is the exception.  Motorcycles may come in as a primary vehicle, but must remained parked once camped.  Two or three wheeled bikes with electric motors and working pedals are allowed, unregistered.  No gas powered bikes (edit: or trikes).  Four wheeled bikes are okay, but must not be power assisted.  Wheelchairs for handicapped people are okay.  Not handicapped?  Seat + power and four wheels = must be registered.  Anything with power (gas or electric) and four or more wheels must registered.  This includes motorized ice chests and bar stools.  If three wheels or less with a seat, must have working pedals to avoid registration.  Can you get away with stuff?  Sure, but don't whine when it is confiscated or in case you get ticketed.

BurningMan,3asr88,enjo13,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:15:55 2015 UTC,"its an art theme, I want to put a lifeguard tower on a powerchair. while rescuing people on the playa   Yes, but what you actually mean is you want a motorized means of getting about and a platform so you can have a better view for Burns.  I'm pretty sure this has been tried. More than likely you can 'get away' with it, but a Ranger sees ya they're gonna have to do their job and inform you it is unsafe. That's actually a part of what the DMV registration is about: making sure the art cars are safe.  Trying to bypass it is a risk just like anything else. I assume you already know people have been killed/injured at BRC for any combination of bad ideas, stupidity and/or intoxication. Hell, back in 2010 I actually witnessed an Art Car 'lose control' and run over a tent. Yeah, it was only going like 5mph, but it was a modified conversion van with platform (they were driving it by a system of pulleys and rope on top) and it completely rolled over a tent. They lucked out that nobody was in it.  I've also seen a spectator fall through the Thunderdome. It was 'only' 10 feet, but according to the Ranger, if you fall on your neck/head that's a crippling injury.  Sounds like you're combining the two. I wouldn't ride it. I'd just use my bicycle with trailer setup and bring a ladder to setup for the burns. Safer all around."
BurningMan,3asr88,pacificmint,3,Tue Jun 23 18:29:36 2015 UTC,"That's actually a part of what the DMV registration is about: making sure the art cars are safe.   Out of curiosity, does the DMV have actual safety engineers involved in the process?"
BurningMan,3asr88,infernalspacemonkey,2,Tue Jun 23 18:34:56 2015 UTC,"No, and /u/infernalspacemonkey is wrong, that's not what the DMV registration is about. The safety of the vehicle is the responsibility of the owner, and the DMV generally does not do safety inspections.  If there are obvious safety hazards, they will point them out and can deny registration, but they are not doing a safety inspection. The reason, as you said, is that they are not safety engineers.  Edit: The exception is the flame effects on the car, those are inspected by experts, but that's technically not the DMV, but FAST. Ditto for the new rules on Lasers."
BurningMan,3asr88,pacificmint,0,Tue Jun 23 22:11:09 2015 UTC,"No, and /u/infernalspacemonkey is wrong, that's not what the DMV registration is about.    Strawman. I said:   That's actually a part of what the DMV registration is about: making sure the art cars are safe.   I didn't say they did a safety inspection. YOU did. In fact, you confirm my statement about making sure the art cars are safe when you state.   If there are obvious safety hazards, they will point them out and can deny registration   The issues: /u/Saltywhenwet wants to build a powered vehicle with high center of gravity and short base bypass DMV registration.

BurningMan,3ar940,usernamerson,3,Tue Jun 23 03:59:12 2015 UTC,":)  Actually, last year's con was very successful, and because of that success, we decided to extend the con to two days.  Believe me, if someone is a hardcore gamer, they'll want to stay and play.  I believe we ran six games or so in the course of the day.  We started games at 10AM, 2PM, and 6PM.  Each game took about four hours with the exception of one game running for about eight.  Yes, six players stayed for eight solid hours and played a Cthulu game.  It was pretty amazing.  I think that maybe the main difference in playing on playa is that you're playing with total strangers.  You're getting to know the imaginations of people you've never met before.  Usually(not always), in the default world, you're playing with long time friends whom you've played with many times before.  Plus, since this is a fairly geeky endeavor, people LOVE coming together to express their passions about RPGs.  We actually had to turn people away because there were no more slots in the games that were running at the time.  Here's a photo album of last year.  I did not play in any of the games, but I helped run support.  I had a blast getting to know people, hearing the developing story lines, and handing out caffeine and candy. :) RaiderCon2014"

Think of the standard vacation - spend thousands of dollars to go to a beach somewhere, just to read trashy romance paperbacks and do jigsaw puzzles (which you could have done on your couch at home). RPGs aren't my thing, but I feel like I kinda understand that (and my idea of a good time out there - dozing through the day, staying out all night - is by no means everyone else's cup of tea)."

BurningMan,3atql7,Jovankat,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:29:29 2015 UTC,"My understanding about last year is that in previous years the 'accepted guideline' i.e. what theme camps just all did, was not release any lineups until after all ticket sales were over.  White Ocean had someone not familiar with Burning Man release their lineup early because they thought they were doing WO a favor. There was some talk of making it an official rule, but either way, White Ocean apologized for it. And I'm not sure Robot Heart even put out a lineup last year."

BurningMan,3ang4d,lynyrd_cohyn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:38:52 2015 UTC,What kind of float switch do you have? I ask because a lot of cheap ones off eBay use a magnet and reed switch and the contacts can weld together if used to drive more than tens of mA. They're only really fit for driving a relay.  So that's the only potential weakness I can see in your setup: make sure the float switch is rated for the current you're driving.
BurningMan,3ang4d,kaishichan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:06:55 2015 UTC,how would you wire a float switch into a swamp cooler then? (not so versed on EE aspects of DIY haha).  I assume wiring in series pump + fan + float switch to battery is not the ideal way to go?
BurningMan,3ang4d,lynyrd_cohyn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:01:08 2015 UTC,"Pump and fan in parallel if you want them both to run off 12v (rather than dividing the 12v between them which is what will happen if you wire them in series).  If you have a fairly solid float switch like what you might have for the bilge pump of a boat, you can drive the load directly from that. If you have a little plastic thingy like OP then you should probably use a relay (relay coil connected in series with the float switch)."
BurningMan,3ang4d,kaishichan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:19:55 2015 UTC,ah thanks for the explanation  if using a relay is to protect the cheap float switch from burning out by connecting directly to the car battery. do you use a secondary power source like a battery or something for the float switch and relay setup?  battery -> relay ->float switch + smaller external power source (switches on and off the relay [based on float switch] which powers the pump)
BurningMan,3ang4d,lynyrd_cohyn,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:36:52 2015 UTC,"Nope, you could drive the relay off the battery too. No need to complicate things by giving it its own power source. If there's not enough power in the battery to drive the relay, there won't be enough to drive the load anyway.  And a 12V relay will probably be happy with 6V or 18V with no ill effects.  Edit: to clarify - the cheap float switch would (potentially) be burnt out not by being connected to the car battery, but by switching a pump and a fan that consume more current than the switch is rated for. This current is still a tiny fraction of what a car battery (possibly hundreds of amps). The relay coil uses less current than the devices it's switching."
BurningMan,3ang4d,lynyrd_cohyn,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:43:52 2015 UTC,"woops sorry, yes the relay will be off the battery. however someone metioned that connecting a cheap float directly to a car battery would cause issues. how does connecting the relay and float switch in relay help prevent that vs using the float switch as a relay to open/close the connection to pump?"
BurningMan,3ang4d,flickerkuu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:47:47 2015 UTC,This is the one I was planning to use - it's rated for 1A of current: http://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Level-Sensor-Right-Switch/dp/B0076UHLWM/
BurningMan,3ang4d,sillycyco,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:30:36 2015 UTC,"That certainly looks like the kind I had in mind - little foam float with a magnet in it, doesn't make a sound when it switches on and off, potentially bullshit Chinese specifications.  Note it says ""Max carry current 1A"" but ""Max switch current 0.5A"". The first spec seems designed solely to confuse. What good is it if it can pass an amp through but can't switch it on and off?  This leaves you 150mA beyond what this thing claims to be able to switch, assuming your pump and fan really do consume 650mA (I'd suggest measuring them for real, if you have a meter)  Your design will probably work for a while as is, but I would either  A) add in a little 12v relay and drive the load off that  B) Prepare for the possibility of bypassing this thing if the contacts weld shut (or open)  For bonus reliability points, mount your relay on a piece of breadboard and add some screw terminals to the breadboard to connect the power source, float switch and load.  Good luck!"

BurningMan,3ang4d,LuminousElement,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:01:28 2015 UTC,"The float switch is just that, a switch. You have power going to it, and have power going from it to other devices. It switches on and off depending on the float level.  You just branch out from the + output of the switch to whatever devices you want switched. Make a splitter so you have one wire splitting to however many, or cram all the wires onto the terminal. Just make sure the load of all the devices does not exceed what the float switch (and wire) can handle.  You can use a common negative wire for all the devices, daisy changed together. Use a separate positive for each one, ie. do not run the positive from your fan to the positive for your pump. Wire from the positive on the switch to the pump, and another line to the fan."
BurningMan,3ang4d,pugworthy,2,Mon Jun 22 21:25:15 2015 UTC,"I would suggest a fan that moves more air.  More air means more cool going into your... say, what are you putting this into?

BurningMan,3ang4d,Burn-O-Matic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:35:01 2015 UTC,"Hey folks, virgin here trying to wire together a small power setup for my wife and I.  Nothing super fancy, just a standard FigJam Swamp Cooler, some rope lights for a monkey hut and a USB charger for various small electronics. This is the first time I’ve ever done something like this so I would really love a sanity check on everything before I pull the trigger and order everything.  I’ve been search and studying as much as I can online and this feels like the best setup:  Load items:   60’ of ""Warm White"" Rope Light from Cool Neon - (power draw:  0.68 Ah) NZXT FX-120LB 120mm Case Fan - (power draw: 0.3 Ah) Magicfly DC30A-1230 Water pump - (power draw:  0.35 Ah)   Assuming 5 hours of swamp cooler use and 10 hours of lights, my total comes out to 10.05 Amps / day.  Power infrastructure:   Solar Panel in the 30W-40W range. Charge Controller w/ USB port Big ass battery Manual switch + float switch for swamp cooler Dimmer switch + timer switch for rope light   A few questions that have popped up while putting this together:  All the load items should be wired off the controller, not directly off the battery correct?  Is it worth soldering the bare wire ends into the 12V barrel connectors when possible?  All the manual and dimmer switches I’ve seen use (like http://tinyurl.com/pzlh3dt and http://tinyurl.com/pfuph4a) use the barrel connectors.  I’m planning on using something like this to split the cooler from the lights - http://tinyurl.com/pv7ucba  How much does the charge controller matter for a setup like this?  Is something like this going to be fine?  (http://tinyurl.com/oot3f7o)  For the swamp cooler, should I be wiring the fan and pump to the float switch in parallel?  I have them currently in series in the design but I can see this being bad.  For the Rope light, will this work as a timer switch (http://tinyurl.com/oqykhmg)?   I’m assuming the timer should come before the dimmer in the circuit?  Anything else I’m missing?"
BurningMan,3ang4d,Jazicle,2,Sun Jun 21 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"Presumably these are A(mp) measurements rather than A(mp) h(our) measurements.  Regarding wiring your load off of the controller vs off the battery directly, it would be best to wire off the controller assuming that your controller has a low voltage cut-out (ie if the battery gets too low it will shut off power so you don't damage your battery.  It is certainly worth picking some standard connector for your electronics and then making everything so that it can use those (possibly with different types of connectors for different voltages).  Personally I use USB connectors for all of my 5V wiring and while I used to use barrel connectors for most of my other connections, I started getting really bad quality control issues from several suppliers of solderable barrel connectors (ymmv) so I gave up and have mostly switched to deans style T-connectors.  This has it's own issues and is gross overkill for what I'm using it for but they work for me.  Others will prefer some crimp type connection or whatever.  The biggest thing is just to standardize your connections.  I have very little experience with charge controllers but everything I've read suggests that they're all grossly over spec'd and that you should similarly get one that is much larger than you'll need.  Your current solar setup is about 4 amp so a 10 amp controller would be fine but the price difference between the cheap 10 amp controllers and 30 amp controllers on amazon was typically about $5-10 and this way when you get another 50 watts of solar panels next year you won't need a new controller.  (I recently acquired 3 20 watt panels, just because I wanted small panels that I could pack and move around easily).  You definitely want your fan and pump to be in parallel and not in series.  Otherwise they won't get the appropriate voltage."
BurningMan,3ang4d,FraggarF,2,Mon Jun 22 01:03:05 2015 UTC,It is very unlikely that you want the fan and the pump in series. You will want them in parallel and you will want their voltages both to match the voltage of your system / battery (so probably 12V.) Anything else is not likely to work.
BurningMan,3ang4d,Jovankat,2,Mon Jun 22 05:27:31 2015 UTC,"I think you are on the right track.  Answers   The solar controller you have listed has a switched load contact.  A lot of charge controllers have these and they are designed to turn the load (lights) on when the solar panel is no longer producing any current (read: it's dark out).  Use this for your rope light for sure - You will end up leaving them on during the day otherwise, trust me.  The swamp cooler should be wired directly to the battery. Otherwise there is no need to wire anything off of the charge controller. Not sure what you mean by ""soldering the bare ends into the barrel connectors""?  If you mean you are buying matching connectors to preserve the ability to plug-n-play then it depends on what is provided by that connector.  If you mean ""shove the wires into the connector on the switch/dimmer and solder them in place"" then NO - don't do this.  It will not hold and will be a nightmare for you to deal with all week.  Just chop those barrel connectors off and do a proper splice if the later is the case. On this setup you can consider ditching the charge controller.  The purpose of which is to prevent overcharging of the battery (boiling-off the acid).  I'm not sure how much damage will be done with a 30w SM and the loads you have over one week.  Another issue when foregoing a controller is that the SM can become a slight load (loss) at night, but a $0.10 diode will fix that.  You'll loose the ability to auto dusk-to-dawn your LEDs though. The pump and fan should be in parallel. The timer would work, but switched load contacts on the charge controller might be a better option.  You want to keep this simple - with the fewest things to go wrong.   Suggestions:   You should add fusing, and bring spare fuses.  The in-line automotive type fuse holders will do fine.  You might not have a lot that can actually catch fire, but none of this is going to work if you melt all the insulation off your wiring on the first day when something gets shorted.  Fuse the positive line leading off the charge controller to the lights, and the pos line leading to the swamp cooler.  Do this at/near the battery. When hooking all of this up be sure to connect the battery to the charge controller first.  Connecting the solar module to the charge controller before the battery tends to let the smoke out of cheaper charge controllers. Elaborating on the above, the battery in these systems acts as ballast.  It stabilizes the voltage.  Solar modules can produce 2 or 3 times their rated voltage when open circuit (no load).  This voltage comes down as load is applied (to basically 0, at short-circuit).  Even if the battery is fully charged (and with no charge controller) then it'll start to boil-off sinking the excess current which is not good, but better than destroying your semiconductors (LEDs, charge controller, dimmer). Bring tools, including a multimeter."
BurningMan,3ang4d,Jovankat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:44:46 2015 UTC,"You have amps and amp-hours the wrong way round (1 Ah = 1A x 1 hour).  The swamp cooler fan should be in parallel, not series, with the pump if both are 12V.  The barrel-jack wires might be a weak spot; make sure they can handle the current you want to run through them (if they don't, get some barrel hands with screw terminal blocks attached, and attach your own, thicker wires).  Is that NZXT fan a high-flow or a high-pressure fan? The more resistance you have (eg towels) the more the pressure will matter.  Other than that it looks alright."
BurningMan,3ang4d,justmehavingfun,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:53:12 2015 UTC,"I think you've got it right.  I had something pretty similar last year.  You'll end up having your powered items coming off the charger, but it will be getting power from the battery if that makes sense.  That is, you're always drawing off the battery, whether you're charging or not.  That way it doesn't matter if your panel is making juice or not.  My guess is you'll have power to spare, which is fine."

It will collect a lot less dust that way. When you get back to the default world, undo the braids and give it a good wash.

We do this at our camp with 3 pieces of pvc to hang it from, an inflatable kiddie pool to stand in and a manual bilge pump to empty the shower water into a bucket and from there our gray water system. I take a shower every 2-3 days, they're life changing out there!   Alternatively, bring a plastic wash basin and ask a friend (or friendly stranger) to wash your hair a couple of times during the week. But the full shower is nicer since you also get to clean the rest of your body.   You might also want to check out the steam bath project and the camp where they blast you with Dr bronners soap and then rinse you off."

I wear headwraps, cotton scarves, and hats on the playa.  Keeping the dust off my head has been the best tactic for me.  I rarely let my hair down in the literal sense as the wind does a number on it.  Also, protect your scalp from sunburn.  A burn along your part line can be uniquely painful.  If you want to try a no rinse or dry shampoo, give it a test run at home.  I found I hate those products, the dust felt better than that crap in my hair.  Awww, that first shampoo in a real shower off the playa ... my hair feels like silk."

BurningMan,3akcji,rucheleh06,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:08:53 2015 UTC,I have really fine hair and if it gets sweaty it becomes very thin.  I need to be able to clean and dry it and apply gel to thicken it out.  I'm guessing oil would do the opposite.
BurningMan,3akcji,fucking_unicorn,2,Sun Jun 21 04:26:54 2015 UTC,"It is so dry out there that your hair will become very brittle and literally break off. Especially if you have thin hair. You will get dust in it and the dust will dry it out even further. I do not recommend gel of any kind--it will attract more dust. Oil will keep any moisture in your hair in and give it a protective layer against the extreme conditions. Just a fingerfull, rub between your hands and smooth through your hair. Trust me, I've been to many burns and have not found a better solution after much experimentation."

Also, when using baby wipes, I keep a sprayer of 2:1 water and apple cider vinegar, and will spray it on the first couple of baby wipes. The playa is pretty alkaline, which isn't actually terrible on my skin, but prolonged exposure dries it out and can irritate it. The vinegar balances the ph out."

BurningMan,3ahvs9,madworld,2,Sun Jun 21 02:10:44 2015 UTC,"There isn't any very good rationale. Partly, it's grandfathered in; back in the day, there was actual commerce on playa (and a barter culture that persisted for awhile after cash transactions were discouraged). Larry Harvey wants Center Camp to essentially be a social space for people who aren't yet comfortable/acclimated to viewing theme camps as the main venue for socialization; in that sense, it's already got a default world mission. Not that it makes any difference in my book, but coffee profits are donated to charity.  The real mind blower (for somebody coming from regionals where all coffee is gifted) is that tipping is encouraged. If you ""volunteer"" at Center Camp you'll walk out after your shift with an extra 20 bucks in cash in your pocket.  And it's not just ice and coffee; there's a dozen or so sanctioned commercial transactions at Burning Man. The others are arguably essential (unlike coffee) and are mostly services, not goods. You can pay to have your RV pumped, get water delivered, take a bus into town, hire a locksmith, etc."

Also, I received a lowrider-style cruiser bike as a gift, and I was about to turn it into my next playa ride, but I have a feeling this is a bad idea because the wheels are small... like, 19 or 20 inches. Anyone have experience with riding a lowrider out there? I used a MTB for two years (and that thing still works perfectly, I don't why I just don't use that same fucking bike - burn masochism i guess, same reason I find it fun to stay up until sunrise every fucking day before getting a few miserable hours of swamp-cooler powered sleep... and I've even managed to get that bike out there four years in a row, either a friend rides it or it sits in camp collecting dust), and then a quadricycle for a year (TERRIBLE IDEA DO NOT DO THIS), a wal-mart cruiser one year (which fell apart on me instantly, yet another terrible fucking idea).

BurningMan,3ahhb0,Rotationation,2,Sat Jun 20 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"We're in the process of building our own similar structure.  The major differences:  BRH: 12'x10' modules, 8' tall.  Tarps as shade cover. Us: 10'x10' modules, (10' or 8' tall, tbd).  Spandex as shade cover.  We're build  a 2x3 scale structure - ie: 20' deep, 30' wide.  The closest BRH equivalent is 36x20 which runs $600(sold out), $700, $800, depending on when you buy it.   Our (preliminary) anticipated cost for the frame is ~<$250 for conduit and connectors, another $200 for spandex as shade cloth (it may be more or slightly less depending on how much cover it provides under tension), $40-65 to attach the spandex (PVC sheaths), + rebar and sundry.  We expect our final cost to be in the neighbourhood of $500 not including side covers.  If we go with 8' height, we will probably add another $40 to go to 12'x10' by buying couplers to use the 2' chunks we'll be lopping off the legs.  TL;DR: The early purchase price for BRH gear is fantastic.  The later purchase prices boil down to how much work you want to put into sourcing and building the structure."

It's something you can mess around with, do the measurement and soldering on.  EL wire (at least all the stuff I've found) is cheapo plastic tubes connected to a cheap control unit that breaks pretty easy. So you wouldn't want to use it in worn projects unless you have replacements.  Though I've only ever used the 5 buck stuff wrapped around my bike and taped down tight."
BurningMan,3ahhb0,darksabrelord,2,Mon Jun 22 23:00:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the difference between $5 and $25 is insane with el wire. I got some good stuff recently, and it lights up like the sun."

BurningMan,3ahhb0,doubleGnT,2,Thu Jun 25 02:11:20 2015 UTC,"Depends how good you are at soldering EL wire. It can be incredibly fiddly, especially with cheaper wire (the phosphor layer tends to be sticky and not peel back easily).  If this is a skill you want to learn then by all means do it. However, if the price is the same and you aren't all that fussed, consider the effort you'll be putting in against the reward you're getting out. It might be worth just buying the lengths you need with connectors attached. Just remember spares in case you get a break.  You won't get as much light out of EL wire as you will from LED string, but you can make much finer details with wire, since it's thinner and can curve more tightly. Wire is also a continuous light source rather than a bunch of somewhat-diffused points."

BurningMan,3ahhb0,ApesInSpace,2,Tue Jun 23 22:51:14 2015 UTC,Do it wrong and you can seriously damage your car. Look up a moneky hut. I've done small ones for as little as 90 bucks.

BurningMan,3ahhb0,i_am_pajamas,2,Sat Jun 20 18:42:59 2015 UTC,"If it's going to be used as your regular cooler, just use regular ice. Opening is going to let out the cold so often the dry ice isn't going to last.  I've heard a system where you use your big cooler as cold storage only intended to be opened once or twice a day, dry ice works very well.  You would then have another cooler to store the stuff you intend to get into all day long (food you're going to cook, water to be cooled, beer)."

BurningMan,3ahhb0,i_am_pajamas,2,Sat Jun 20 22:02:04 2015 UTC,"I brought my illuminated goodies over from Australia in a box in my checked luggage last year. The box made it to LAX, but somewhere between there and SFO, Virgin America lost it. It showed up months later, but for the 2014 burn I had none of the things I had built for the year.  Fortunately this was only my personal lighting and glow toys and not true necessities like clothing (which would have sucked to have to replace within the few days' margin we had).  Long story short, don't trust the airline baggage system any more than you have to. If you're staying at a hotel in Reno, one idea is to call ahead and ask if you can send a box via UPS or whatnot, and if they'll hold it for you."
BurningMan,3ahhb0,Rotationation,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:37:03 2015 UTC,"Unless you're doing some sort of standard freight shipping, most burners coordinate through some local hubs. Like the new york burners that run a shipping container.  At this point, they're all most likely filled and unavailable. So the idea of them losing your stuff is not really worth talking about.  But, if it's a bunch of burners throwing their stuff into a container. Just clearly label your stuff and you shouldn't have a problem unless they lose the container in general."

I bought it all on Amazon (amazon pantry for food) and I have amazon prime so it was supposed to arrive two days before I was going to get there. I let the hotel know, then called them to confirm it got there and it did. They were cool with holding on to it for a few days since I had already made the reservation.

BurningMan,3ahhb0,mini0ni0n,3,Sun Jun 21 05:16:53 2015 UTC,"I vape on the playa. Get some cheap mechanical mods from fasttech, or some cheap regulated devices. They will take a beating, but consider them disposable. Bring several, they can get lost or broken easily. An all metal tank is good so your tanks don't break. You will get the drip tip clogged massively if you drop it and through general use. If your tank is glass, bring extra replacement glass. Rebuilding coils can be a real pain in the ass out there, so disposable coils like in a kanger tank is good.  Otherwise, its not a big deal. The batteries do not like extreme heat, so charge them in the shade where ever it is coolest. Fill your tanks inside somewhere, to minimize dust getting in them. Bring lots of extra coils or wire and cotton. The dust will cause them to wear faster. Bring more juice than you think you'll need. Do not leave any batteries in your vehicle, that is just begging for it to burn down."

I'm taking it with my buddy, but I'm toying with the idea of trying to secure a vehicle pass before the big event.  I'm just scared that if I wait too long to get a bus ticket they will sell out, then I am super screwed.  My buddy insists that the bus is really convenient, but I'd really prefer to have my own vehicle to pack to the gills with luggage, you know?  It's my first burn and his second.  In before y'all mock me for even thinking I could get a vehicle pass in time."
BurningMan,3ahhb0,Cassaroll168,2,Mon Jun 22 22:27:02 2015 UTC,"No mocking. It's a real issue. If you can pull it off bare bones, then the bus is a great option. But, I understand the desire to over prepare. And the express is going to sell out pretty quickly.  The biggest factor has to be if you have any support on playa. If yes, then go ahead and do the bus. Meet up with your crew and have a good time. If you two are going on your own, I'd say maybe hedge your bet on finding a pass. Even for his second time, your buddy might not be completely prepared for how tough it'd be to have basically two outfits, a bunch of canned food and a bunch of sunscreen and trying to figure out how to get your water through ice out there.  From what I hear, passes came flooding back into the ether as the event got closer. People probably dialed in the number they needed this year. But, it shouldn't be too hard to find one. But, you also probably won't run into people just giving them away this year.  Either way, it's a risk. So, you'll have to see what you want to risk. Be prepared and deal with the anxiety of not knowing if you're going to get on playa (even if it's not a terrible bet) or guarantee getting on playa but making your first year way harder than it needs to be.  Either way, read the survival guide, check out the FAQs for the burner express and figure out what you think is best.  This probably doesn't help much."

BurningMan,3agbaz,DaJAckbot,5,Fri Jun 19 22:28:12 2015 UTC,"The 10 principles are vague and almost entirely unenforceable. Many actions could be seen to be permitted by one of the 10 and prohibited by another.  There are a series of operating regulations that have evolved over the years which are enforceable. Fuel storage, fire effects, open fire in the city, sound levels, speed limits, placement, entry/exit/be out by times/processes, drones, lasers, skydiving, fireworks and explosives, Leave no Trace/MOOP, many MV regulations, disabled mobility, firearms, IP enforcement, peeing and pooping on the playa, food handling for large groups, drugs, minors, assault, large art burns, more!  The online forums are filled with the sentiment that each person can interpret the 10 principles on their own in a vacuum or within the bubble of their friends without considering all the operating regulations or whatever anyone would like to call them.  And you will find that people will argue against every one of those regulations."
BurningMan,3agbaz,seethinksay,6,Sat Jun 20 00:26:38 2015 UTC,"The org's job is definitely not to enforce the 10 principles 'rigidly.' Remember that those principles were only laid out in 2004, 18 years after Burning Man started, and that they were explicitly described by Larry Harvey as descriptive, not prescriptive.  In other words, they're a statement of the reflection of general values of the community at that time, not a set of rules that we all must live rigidly by."

BurningMan,3agbaz,Plantdrew,3,Mon Jun 22 15:04:55 2015 UTC,"10 principles shouldn't be enforced, as they aren't really enforcable. They're guidelines to the communities culture, not rules. As seethinksay mentions, there are some rules; some of these rules pertain to mutant vehicle sound levels.  As far as Dancetronauts go, radical inclusion has nothing to do with it; the people involved can still come to the event, and they could even bring their vehicle and leave it parked at their camp. They just can't a license from the DMV to drive it around (another rule; can't drive unlicensed vehicles on the playa). Principle-wise, it boils down to the Dancetronauts radically self expressing themselves through loud music in a way that wasn't civically response.  And that's the thing; the 10 principles are self-contradictory, and that's intentional. Give me any two principles and I can give you a plausible scenario where they conflict. Radical self expression vs. civic responsibility: loud music. Immediacy vs. communal effort: you're on your way to do a volunteer shift when you pass a camp with something really cool going on; do you flake on your shift? Gifting vs. radical self reliance: if everybody has 100% of what they need at all times, gifting opportunities are limited."

I'll leave my post below unedited because I do think it has some value to anyone thinking about gifting on playa or even in daily life in the default world.    No no no no no.  Everyone in this thread so far has gotten it completely wrong. The idea if gifting is NOT about buying some shitty trinket or gift to shove off on someone else.  The act of gifting is about going around to everyone you see and thinking ""How can I make your day better?"" Maybe they dropped some trash and you are going to pick it up for them. Maybe they need a hug. Maybe they need someone to talk to. Maybe they ran out of sunscreen. Maybe they need a compliment.  This isn't about consumerism and buying something to hand out, its about you giving yourself to the community. The thing that makes burning man great in my mind is that sense of selflessness with the community helping to bring everyone else up.  The other important aspect of this is being able to receive a gift. A gift is a one way transaction and there is nothing expected in return. This is hard for some people to understand, but if someone gives you a gift and you repay it by giving them something in return it totally ruins the gift.  If someone offers you a gift and you respond with, ""Oh, but I don't have anything to repay you"" then you have just stolen their opportunity to make someone else feel better by making them feel guilty. Don't do it. Accept the gift with an open heart and pay it forward to someone else. This is what builds the community at burning man."
BurningMan,3aehlv,Nephyst,5,Fri Jun 19 18:11:24 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure OP was asking about getting a gift for someone who is heading to Black Rock City (like a secret santa situation) rather than gifting on the playa. In that regard most of the ideas on here are pretty good ones, including the sparkly unicorn dildo. I love the gifting community and definitely agree with some of the points you made but I'm not sure this is the appropriate thread for lectures on how everyone has it wrong and the right way to go about things.   I think /u/bluegreyscale  should get their secret magical gift person some EL-wire! because you can never have too much EL- wire. Or a pair of acoustically balanced ear plugs if they plan on seeing a lot of DJ's, these things are amazing because they don't muffle the sound but also save you from bleeding ear drums."

BurningMan,3aehlv,LumpyNV,2,Fri Jun 19 18:54:27 2015 UTC,You make some very good points about the process of gift giving which I agree with but I think you might have missed the part where this is for the redditgifts exchange.  Also the person receiving the gift lives the states where as I live in Germany and all I know about them is what information they provided in their profile (that they will be attending burning man among other things).

BurningMan,3aemhs,theseekerofbacon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:52:46 2015 UTC,transformus is more of a burn than burning man ;)

BurningMan,3aemhs,yasserkhan1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:38:16 2015 UTC,"2500 people, so the sense of community is much stronger than the big burn.  the level of art and theme camps for the size is astounding. you won't see as many advertisements or logos, no giant RVs.  It rains almost everyday because it's one of the only deciduous temperate rain forests in the country."
BurningMan,3aemhs,czarter,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:31:25 2015 UTC,"festival   noun  1. a day or time of religious or other celebration, marked by feasting, ceremonies, or other observances: the festival of Christmas; a Roman festival.  2. a periodic commemoration, anniversary, or celebration: an annual strawberry festival.  3. a period or program of festive activities, cultural events, or entertainment: a music festival.  4. gaiety; revelry; merrymaking."
BurningMan,3adg1g,Rsquared85,13,Fri Jun 19 05:32:48 2015 UTC,Oh god oh god the dust. >.<
BurningMan,3adg1g,Nephyst,3,Fri Jun 19 07:07:17 2015 UTC,Mobile dust storm? Do it.  Make sure you have good intake filters for the engine.
BurningMan,3adg1g,Jazicle,3,Fri Jun 19 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"I've wanted to make a fake one for years. A speaker playing a sound of the fans winding up, some hydraulics underneath lifting the thing up. Maybe a little fan to blow a small amount of dust out from underneath just for effect.  But a real hovercraft? Terrible idea."
BurningMan,3adg1g,LumpyNV,2,Fri Jun 19 17:32:23 2015 UTC,"If the dunes are bad this year, you could use it to scrub nice clean hardpacked playa paths between various destinations. You know, while still limited to 5 mph and sitting in your own dust cloud."
BurningMan,3adg1g,macegr,0,Fri Jun 19 09:42:34 2015 UTC,"""dunes"" lol."
BurningMan,3adg1g,BeigeListed,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:17:21 2015 UTC,What term would you use for wind-blown piles of dust?
BurningMan,3adg1g,macegr,2,Sun Jun 21 04:50:02 2015 UTC,A mound.
BurningMan,3adg1g,BeigeListed,2,Sun Jun 21 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"It would definitely kick up a lot of dust, but people might be okay with it if you decorate the hovercraft as the ""Playa Tornado"" or something similar."
BurningMan,3adg1g,rule2productions,10,Fri Jun 19 14:51:03 2015 UTC,have it blaring Sandstorm on repeat
BurningMan,3adg1g,Le3f,2,Fri Jun 19 15:14:11 2015 UTC,I think you'd beat out the Dancetronauts for most complained about art car pretty darn quick.
BurningMan,3adg1g,Albertafire,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:21:08 2015 UTC,Write to dmv.burningman.com.  I would guess that this would be a mess.
BurningMan,3adg1g,yayj,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:56:06 2015 UTC,"Here's an interesting video that looks like they're on something similar to the playa, but more dry mud than playa dust. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGw7qQlQWFM  +1 on playing ""Sandstorm"" on loop tho!"
BurningMan,3adg1g,wolfraidernyc,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:37:34 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem with hovercrafts is that the air intakes get fouled with dust. You can't go fast, so you can't outrun your own dust. So your engines are constantly going to be sucking in enormous amounts of the stuff, and either the filters will get clogged so bad the engine can't run (like cars and trucks in the middle east), or the moving parts will die due to grit, or... well, all kinds of things.  I do like the idea of building an art car that NOBODY wants to get near, though!! That is an AMAZING idea.  But yeah... that 5 MPH speed limit? It's to keep the dust down. So there's no way DMV will allow it.  Sorry."
BurningMan,3adg1g,happycj,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"I have a fuzzy memory of someone approaching the DMV a couple of years ago with the idea of bringing a hovercraft. They mulled the idea over for a while, and ultimately decided that it wasn't a good idea."
