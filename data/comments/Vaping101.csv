The Mavaton's Select Gold is the best cotton I've used.  http://www.cottonman.com/ms.html  I initially purchased a sample pack. The Mavaton's lasted several months --- the 1/4oz tin will last years.

Vaping101,3e5r7z,PM_ME_heartwarmth,2,Wed Jul 22 04:11:26 2015 UTC,As long as your having fun your fine. Less nic is recommended because you are getting more nic per hit. Some people get headaches from too much.
Vaping101,3e5r7z,TitsofErica,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:20:47 2015 UTC,"Headaches, nausea, shakes, passing out.   Nicotine overdosing is a horrible horrible thing, and can quite easily be achieved whilst vaping without realising it."
Vaping101,3e5r7z,Frisky_Frogs,2,Wed Jul 22 11:39:13 2015 UTC,It's just a lot of nicotine in one hit and it's usually not pleasant.
Vaping101,3e5r7z,theblackestbrotha,2,Wed Jul 22 04:22:05 2015 UTC,"Sub Ohm set ups draw in more vapor, thus more nicotine than regular set ups. So if you are used to using 12mg  through a high ohm setup, you would drop to around 6mg in a sub ohm to get the same amount of nicotine.   It's not that high nic is bad for sub ohming, it's just easy to over do it on the nicotine.  Also, blowing through 15-30ml of juice in a couple of days is fairly normal."
Vaping101,3e5r7z,burnstyle,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:23:49 2015 UTC,"Ah! Thank you all for replying, that makes much more sense now. I do enjoy using 12 mg over 6, since I very recently was a heavy smoker for so long. I don't have to sit and cape for as long to be satisfied (for instance, I don't have time to waste at work) and 12 mg definitely gives me more of a throat hit that I am looking for.   Surprise bonus question! The set up I have now (my first ever) is basically just a tube design with a button and air holes I can move around depending on what kind of airflow I want. The box vapes seem to have much more options, such as different wattages.   I do get headaches more often now that I've been vaping, im going to assume it's what you guys are referring to. One of the biggest reasons also for the 12 mg is that I feel more of a throat hit, which is what I prefer at the moment since I recently quit cigarettes. If I get one of these box kind of ones, will the variances in wattages help me get some kind of a throat hit better with a 6 mg juice? If that's the case, I'll upgrade to one of those sooner than planned."
Vaping101,3e5r7z,blowinmyself,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:47:34 2015 UTC,I went through several different ecigs until i settled on the istick 30w and atlantis 2.0.  This is the closest I have come to the satisfaction I got off smoking cigs
Vaping101,3e5r7z,blowinmyself,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:02:59 2015 UTC,Lol! I was just checking out that setup.
Vaping101,3e5r7z,snawsage,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:12:53 2015 UTC,This is what I was expecting when I got into vaping.  I run it at about 26.9w and it is not harsh or hot and get great clouds.  I usually try to get at least a 70vg/30pg mix at 6%.  I'm thinking about the Kanger Subbox just to try something new and have a backup in case something happens.  Both setups are about $60 and totally worth it compared to a month of cigs at $5 a box!
Vaping101,3e5r7z,snawsage,2,Wed Jul 22 05:51:40 2015 UTC,"By far my favorite thing about doing this is looking at my bank account and not seeing the amount of it depleting as rapidly as it has in the past. You know, also it's much more tasty. :) I think I'm almost 100% on going out and getting the setup you have right now on Friday. Maybe I'll just keep the old one around, or hand it off to a friend who is curious about vaping but doesn't want to spend the money yet."
Vaping101,3e5r7z,LikPik,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:00:15 2015 UTC,"since you were a long-time smoker (though i don't know how heavy a smoker) your headaches could be due to smoking cessation and not from your vape nic-level itself. you're still coming off a lot of things. note that i don't know if i'm right or wrong on this, and there are lots of variables, but that seems like a possibility to me."
Vaping101,3e5r7z,6745408,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:41:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm... This is true. I may be trying to make an excuse to myself to spend more money on a better setup, haha."
Vaping101,3e43pi,ucrecigarettestudy,2,Tue Jul 21 20:21:02 2015 UTC,I dont think this person knows anything about electronic cigarettes. How does a specific flavoring affect your health?
Vaping101,3e43pi,Semicolon_Expected,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:37:15 2015 UTC,Like aroma therapy?  Or menthol for respatory stuff
Vaping101,3e43pi,thetafour,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:39 2015 UTC,No like flavor profiles
Vaping101,3e43pi,Semicolon_Expected,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:33:32 2015 UTC,I'm sure thr flavours csn have some effect like aromatherapy does
Vaping101,3e43pi,thetafour,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:14:39 2015 UTC,"Im sure they can, but their wording is weird like what does each specific flavor profile benefit ie resperatory circular and etc. Menthol is the one that can do something, but it just feels like they dont really get it. Maybe its just their use of electronic cigarette often. Somethi g just rubs me wrong about the study"
Vaping101,3e43pi,Semicolon_Expected,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:20:12 2015 UTC,I agree that I don't get any other real Benefits from many other flavours. I would argue most of not all aside menthol is a mental effect

Vaping101,3e3yh0,telix,4,Tue Jul 21 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"Until yesterday, I was primarily vaping on a Nautilus Mini (full) and an MVP 20W (my MVP 3.0 Pro came in yesterday's mail). Still keeping the MiniNaut loaded with the ADV though, so it spends most of the time on my mod.   I don't think you have anything to worry about. If you don't want to get into rebuilding or subohming, the Mini has great flavor. It's just not the current flavor (no pun intended) of the month, which is what's being hyped and recommended to new vapers even when it's utter overkill.   Unlike me, you got decent gear right out of the gate, give yourself a chance to enjoy it before you let us start you on the Sisphyean gear treadmill. :)"
Vaping101,3e3yh0,Targren,4,Tue Jul 21 19:54:00 2015 UTC,I think the nautilus was a great choice. It has great flavor for mouth to lung cigarette style pulls.
Vaping101,3e3yh0,HocusKrokus,2,Tue Jul 21 20:00:34 2015 UTC,"seriously, use the same mod for 6 months and you'll have people calling it a ""classic"". It's pretty funny, honestly. Use whatever suits you! Most of this stuff doesn't fundamentally change, or if it does it's designed with a very specific purpose in mind that won't affect you unless you're waiting for it. If your setup is still satisfactory to you, you don't feel a need to upgrade and it's not physically worn/malfunctioning i would say you should just enjoy it! :)"
Vaping101,3e3yh0,razzamatazz,3,Tue Jul 21 22:00:07 2015 UTC,I think you'll be fine with that. I have nothing but good things to say about my experience with a Nautilus Mini.
Vaping101,3e3yh0,Toni_Too,2,Tue Jul 21 23:32:15 2015 UTC,"Vape gear is worse than computers, it's outdated before you get it home.

Vaping101,3e3yh0,havensal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:35:23 2015 UTC,I guess I'm more concerned that there are superior products that can do what I want. :)
Vaping101,3e3yh0,Targren,3,Tue Jul 21 22:05:43 2015 UTC,"What is it that you want to do, that you think you can't with the gear you have there?   The NautMini is about the best intersection of control, convenience, and flavor that I've seen. The MVP 3.0 goes up to what, 30W, which is plenty. Combine the two together and you've got a killer flavor-chasing, ciggy-quitting combination.   Use it for a little while. If you notice something that's not up to snuff, then look into upgrading. Don't just go chasing specs for something you'll never need. That's like paying $600 for a PC video card when you don't game or do graphics work. :)"
Vaping101,3e3yh0,logicalwayswins,2,Tue Jul 21 23:30:55 2015 UTC,"I know that feeling.  What I would recommend doing is accepting that no matter what, you'll always have outdated equipment.  I'll use computers as an example. I build my own desktops for many reasons and no matter what I buy, it's outdated. Something better is being designed, produced, or is already being made and will be available for sale soon.  So instead of trying to have the best, I try to get the most value for what I paid. Every time I build a desktop now, I try to find the sweet spot between performance and cost. Or, I try to get the most bang for my buck.  I try to do the same with vaping."

Vaping101,3e3yh0,thewomberchomby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:46 2015 UTC,"The only tank out there that I would say is better for flavor and tight draw than the Nautilus is the Kayfun v4. Nice tight pull, incredible flavor... But it's a tank that you have to build your own coils on, and is a little finicky. The improvements of the Kayfun vs the Nautilus aren't really worth the extra hassle. I think you did just fine picking your setup!"
Vaping101,3e3yh0,DarthRTFM,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:37:22 2015 UTC,"If by dated you mean that it's been around for a while, then yes.   As far as usability and effectiveness, no. You should always use what you like, and what works for you, regardless of what is trendy or what other people suggest, as not everything is for everyone.   If you are happy and satisfied with your kit, then you are good to go. There is always more to learn and new things to experience, but that should be done at your own pace. If you become like many of us, and you become obsessed with the new hot thing, you'll never be satisfied and your bank account will always been empty. =)"

Now that I'm a month in and smarter than I should be for what I do for a living...after all the experimenting and spending I've done...I've found I might have bought a different device....but...it's still solid.  At this point, I find its more tanks than power...I don't need to vape at 200w, I don't need to build coils all day for what I'm doing....What I need is two devices (sub ohm, and [plus ohm?] something at like 1.6+, something high nic, something low nic...I run the low nic mostly but when I really need a fix...the low power high ohm is there to fix that...if you're finding an issue, try a different tank...or device...i just wish the mvp had .1w selection instead of .5 increments."

Vaping101,3e48y5,lels11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:58:25 2015 UTC,"My guess is it would ultimately depend on the resistance of the coil you are using. From what I can see on Aspire's page for the Nautilus Mini, there are three different resistance coils that will work with it, and so that would be the major determining factor.  When I upgraded to my Sigelei 150W, I did the same thing. I was using my Kanger GeniTank with my sigelei. With the coil I had in the tank, I couldn't (shouldn't have?) fire it any higher than 10W, which is as low as the sigelei will fire."

Vaping101,3e25pd,CooKii3x,3,Tue Jul 21 11:18:33 2015 UTC,Usually it all depends on how much you vape!   Gotta get a feel for it :)

Vaping101,3e25pd,thetafour,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:39:25 2015 UTC,I usually get harsh throat hits when my coils are ready.   There is no set time really.   It's honestly all feel :)
Vaping101,3e25pd,ButteringToast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:23:48 2015 UTC,"It has an ""off"" taste when you need to change it. Usually you can just  dry burn the coils and change the cotton."
Vaping101,3e25pd,OneSoggyBiscuit,3,Tue Jul 21 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"Unless your coil pops, you can keep your coil for a long time. You're just going to want to change the wick when the taste starts going bad. Dry burn the coil and wash them off and you'll be good to go again."
Vaping101,3e25pd,420-THC,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:26 2015 UTC,"Im a rebuildable nut, and love to try new coil concepts. So if I find a real good coil I might keep it in for 1-5 days, and then I end up popping a new coil in there. I just love fucking with my atomizer, and trying new builds so my coils never go ""bad"". Honestly though I could probably make a set of coils last for a month or so with dry burning/rewicking."
Vaping101,3e25pd,Kangsai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:38:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on a lot, how much you vape, the juice, wick material, in some cases wattage.   When the taste starts to fall off, or gets a vad taste you'll want to change it. On my RTA I change when I change juice, usually once every week or so."
Vaping101,3e25pd,Flatlandrr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:40:25 2015 UTC,"I usually rebuild every week/every other week. Really it depends on the amount you vape+the juice you use. If you start to lose flavor try to rewick, if that doesn't work it'a time to rebuild."
Vaping101,3e25pd,Cardboard_Aficionado,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:29 2015 UTC,"As others have said, the coils themselves will last a long time.  I re-coil about every couple of months.  Honestly, they'd probably last even longer, but my fat fingers eventually mess up the coils while re-wicking.    But I re-wick about every week.  I don't get into very high wattage though."
Vaping101,3e25pd,Caladriel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:05 2015 UTC,"Juices with a cream flavor tend to accumulate black buildup on coils faster, I've noticed. I used to think it was sweeter juices, but I have a nice sweet fruity vape that I can go weeks on before it gunks up the coil.  That said, I usually rewick after about 30ml or so. If the coil isn't gunked up, I'll go longer. And I almost always rewick between flavors. With rewicks, you dry burn all that gunk off, so I might go 1-2 weeks before changing coils."
Vaping101,3e25pd,XMonkeyfishX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:41:40 2015 UTC,I change my coils when I feel like changing up my performance. I rewick and dry burn every morning but I've kept a coil for 2 weeks with no I'll effects.
Vaping101,3e0uzi,DeathRowe,3,Tue Jul 21 02:24:56 2015 UTC,"The MVP 3.0 is awesome.  I've always like the MVP line.  I use a PRO 60W right now and I absolutely love it.  It can deliver a very satisfying amount of vapor with the included isub-G tank. I do want to mention, that in the vaping world, you will always have extra parts.  You may want a few tanks so that you can change flavors at a whim or at least know that you have one on back-up in case something happens to a tank.  And you will always have to replace coils for your tanks (or build your own for RBA's but I don't want to confuse you - that's a slightly different, higher maintenance world).  But the MVP batteries are killer.  They have a nice large OLED screen, rechargable with pass-thru option, which means you can still vape from it as it is charging.  You can also charge other devices from them if you want.  It's like having an emergency battery pack.  Plus, they're durable.  I can't tell you how many times I've dropped mine and it keeps going.  My buddy jumped into a river with an MVP Pro in his pocket over a month ago and it's still working.  I wouldn't suggest submersing them in water though, if you can help it.  Something more affordable would be the MVP 3.0 with an isub tank.  Same awesomeness but it goes to 30W instead of 60.  Good pick.  I can't recommend anything better for a first vape."
Vaping101,3e0uzi,cali7x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:00:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. So i was looking to buy the MVP 3.0 from here:   http://www.myvaporstore.com/Innokin-iTaste-MVP-3-0-Pro-Starter-kit-p/ink-mvp3pa.htm  Would I need anything else besides juice to get started?
Vaping101,3e0uzi,owllady,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:06:14 2015 UTC,"Not the person you replied to.  But you will need some coils to go with that Isub tank.  Get some juice and you will be good to go.   DO you know about pg/vg ratios and all that?  You will want to get a high vg ratio to your juice.  Something like 70/30 vg/pg ratio.  80/20 would be good too.  Also you want to talk about nicotine levels.  Since you will be sub-ohming you will want to get a lower nicotine level.  Look into getting either 6 or 3mg nicotine.  WIth staring out I would suggest 6mg.  That way you will be able to ween yourself off of the cigarettes easier.  The reason I am recommending so low is that the Sub-ohming makes the nicotine vape more readily.  Just be aware of that.  If you are feeling frisky you can try out a bottle of 12mg.  Just be aware of nicotine overdose.  Sweating, nausea, heart palapitations.    I wish you good luck and happy travels.  If you need any more help check out /r/electronic_cigarette.  IT is a much busier subreddit for ecigs."
Vaping101,3e0uzi,Furiosis,2,Tue Jul 21 04:35:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely this....I haven't smoked for 66 days and when I got my MVP 3.0 Pro, which is an awesome investment, I used a 6mg juice and holy balls it was like smoking 10 cigarettes at once. I'm going to downgrade to 3mg as soon as my 6mg juices are gone. Be careful like owllady said."

Friend and I vaped on this thing together all day and the battery hardly went down.   Probably be buying another tank from them soon.  Currently using it at 11W and just under 4V.

Steam Monkey has this set up on sale for really cheap.  http://www.steammonkey.com/GigantopitheKIT_p/kit-gigan.htm  It is a great starter kit.  It is a subohm kit too.  You would be quite happy with it too.  These two kits I have recommended to you do not have adjustable vv/vw to them so if you want that you would have to go with a box mod of some sort.  THe Subox would be perfect for that.

If i get the Gigan one, would I be able to switch out the bottom for a different piece?Or would i have to rethread it to accommodate different pieces?"
Vaping101,3e197r,owllady,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:10 2015 UTC,YOu would be able to switch out the battery for a different piece anytime you want to.  The tanks are sub-ohm tanks though so you would have to get one that sub ohms.  So watch out for that.
Vaping101,3e197r,thewomberchomby,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, tube mods are kind of out of style at this point. They've all fallen way behind on what today's tech is capable of, so if you get one in this form factor, you may find yourself unsatisfied with it. The Subox is a great starter kit with room to grow, but if you're absolutely sold on a tube-style device, the Ego One is a good starter as well, just with fewer options for upgrades later on."
Vaping101,3e197r,Furiosis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:56:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment! I dislike the boxy looking mods, are there mods similar to the Kanger where its not a block but in a steel look?"
Vaping101,3e197r,buckeyenut45,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:56 2015 UTC,I would suggest the Innokin MVP 3.0 Pro....they have starter kits with this box mod as well... at www.myvaporstore.com ... It's a 60w mod with a huge battery that lasts literally for days. You probably won't need anything more than 60w for a good while. The tank included with it is a sub ohm tank that has great air flow and has a pretty nice size resovoir for your juice. Great flavor and can put out some nice clouds.
Vaping101,3e0en5,machinosaure,4,Tue Jul 21 00:12:06 2015 UTC,"Two things to consider:  1>Nicotine levels will affect your ability to work out. I realized after a little while I was vaping a lot after work and before the gym and my heart would be hammering and I'd run out of breath. don't vape for an hour or two before running  2> You haven't been running in a while. Not smoking doesn't fix that.   That said, I did a 1/3 marathon a while back and had no issues breathing, but I'd been training up for it too."
Vaping101,3e0en5,sungod23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did a half-marathon two months ago and kind of let myself go since then.   I'll take your advice and try to spare the vape before running. In the long term I'm aiming for nic-free juice anyway."
Vaping101,3e0en5,Furiosis,2,Tue Jul 21 09:39:02 2015 UTC,It takes a little over a month to clean out your systems and lungs. At least that what it took me. I've been cigarette free for 67 days now and feel great. It just takes some time man....
Vaping101,3e0en5,kenks84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:52:35 2015 UTC,"In my opinion vamping wont ""fix it"" as it's not a remedy.   After a while your lungs should start clearing up of smoke and stop producing extra phlegm.   But you should notice an improvement over time. Stick at it"
Vaping101,3dzwap,Sharkn91,3,Mon Jul 20 21:49:29 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you've got a Protank if you were using it atop a Vision Spinner. If you're not looking to upgrade your tank as well, you really don't need a device with more than 20 watts of power. To this end, I'd say either the iStick Mini 20w or the MVP 20w. The iStick is much smaller and more portable at the expense of under half of the battery life of the MVP. The MVP, while quite a bit larger than the iStick, can also be used as a portable power bank to charge your phone or other USB device. MVPs are also built like tanks, and will sustain a lot of abuse before crapping out."
Vaping101,3dzwap,thewomberchomby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:35:37 2015 UTC,"I'll look into them both! thanks!   Btw, Any idea on what the average battery life is on the iStick Mini?"
Vaping101,3dzwap,ButteringToast,0,Tue Jul 21 12:14:19 2015 UTC,The iSticks are known to fail pretty frequently. Stick with the MVP or the Sigelei Mini
Vaping101,3dzwap,ButteringToast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:55 2015 UTC,Holy shit. Thats a little pricey for me. I just want something basic that works with the Kangertech I have already. I dont vape a lot. Only when I get the urge and dont want to set up an entire hookah for a short smoking session.   What about the Aspire CF VV+ 1000 mAh? It seems basic enough and isnt bulky.
Vaping101,3dzwap,ButteringToast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:59 2015 UTC,That would work - Have you tried looking at FastTech if you are on a budget :  https://www.fasttech.com/search?mvp

Vaping101,3dzwap,dagormz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:24 2015 UTC,and cheaper? sweet as long as it doesnt crap out on me real quick.
Vaping101,3dzwap,dagormz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:06 2015 UTC,And it's authentic too :)  They have a 6 month warranty to and have great support. It may take awhile to get to you through but I use them all the time :)
Vaping101,3dzwap,MuffKilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:40 2015 UTC,Pay for the upgraded ePacket shipping so you'll get it in a week instead of a month.
Vaping101,3dyqss,thetafour,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:57:20 2015 UTC,"I cannot recommend TheVaporist enough @ http://thevaporist.org/ Phil had super fast shipping even all the way to BC, was able to help me choose between two mods and a tank, and was even awesome enough to throw me a few samples even though I was low on cash. Service was top notch, juice was delicious, and all equipment was authentic. Double major thumbs up!   Two others I have heard good things of but not tried are VaporNorth @ http://www.vapornorth.com/ I just placed an order with them and I'm waiting for it to come in. They're based in Ontario though and im in BC so im sure shipping to you would be faster. Prices are good, but I havent tried juice yet.  Lastly there is Dashvapes which again I havent used but I have heard great things. They have a huuge variety of juices at some decent prices and what I think is best is that they have a DashPak which is similar to a lootcrate and also they have a Mystery pack you can order. Dashvapes can be found @ http://www.dashvapes.com/  All three of these sites are greatly recommended and also have reddit accounts and are active over at /r/canadian_ecigarette"
Vaping101,3dyqss,kurtiscaston,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:16:01 2015 UTC,Dash vapes is my local shop :)   super guys at thr toronto location. I work just around thr corner and frequent them on my lunch breaks :p
Vaping101,3e0uhv,ovoallnight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:20:40 2015 UTC,"Youre gonna have to try different types of coils until you find something you like. You can make 2mm coils with the little blue screwdriver that comes with everything. I like 3mm when using single coils. I used a single parallel for a couple of months and loved it.  30w might not be enough for dual coil builds and things like twisted coils and clapton coils. Right now Im using a dual clapton with .24 ohms at 60w. If you want something cheap that works, take a look at the Smok M80. It gets some hate on here but mine has worked flawlessly for three months. Or if you want to go with the safe choice take a look at some Sigelei products. I managed to get the Sig 150w for $60 at wakeandvape.com Right now all that wattage will seem excessive to you, but when you get bored and start to get into crazy coils you'll understand why all the wattage"
Vaping101,3e0uhv,FloydRosita,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:36:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I will try experimenting when I get a new box mod."
Vaping101,3e0uhv,Zamibe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:42:59 2015 UTC,"Second you on the Smok M80. Ignore the hate, mine has worked perfectly for a month."
Vaping101,3e0uhv,thewomberchomby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:02 2015 UTC,"At 30w, you're a bit limited as to what gauge wire you'll be able to use effectively. Anything larger than 26ga will be too high-mass and 30w won't heat it up very quickly, especially if you do dual coils. Anything smaller than 28ga will likely be too hard to work with.  Steam Engine is going to be your new best friend when it comes to wrapping coils. Input the gauge of wire you're using, whether it's a single or dual coil setup, the size of the screwdriver or drill bit you plan on using(""inner diameter of coil"" field on the site)and your desired resistance, and it tells you how many wraps to use. It also gives you an idea of how warm your vape will be in the Heat Flux section of the Results area.   Once you get your IPV4, you should be able to build anything your heart desires using whatever gauge kanthal you'd like. Until then, pick up a spool of 26 and 28 gauge and experiment!"
