electronic_cigarette,3e1ucx,ProjectGrenades,21,Tue Jul 21 08:43:03 2015 UTC,"It remains to be seen if retailers will abide or give a flying fuck. They could always get a permit as required. I'll admit to just skimming but I didn't notice anything that said only Arkansas based businesses could get one. Holy fuck they are asinine. I hope the retailers do just ignore them. There's always china, they don't give a fuck. You might wait longer, but what's Arkansas going to do if you order your next mod or juice from China? Go there and bitch because the Chinese don't give a shit? Those communists don't care about some inbred U.S. states laws.   So TL;DR don't be a bitch and go back to analogs, keep ordering online until companies change their policies. Then order from China, they will not give a fuck."

Fuck em if something happens i will post here and let everyone know. But i mean only way they will know is if the vendor refuses, or usps opens the package and tells the governor. Which opening is a felony so fuck em."
electronic_cigarette,3e1ucx,ChildishCalvino,2,Tue Jul 21 09:00:46 2015 UTC,Please let us know how the ordering online goes. I'm interested on what they'll actually do. You could always ask for discreet shipping ;)

electronic_cigarette,3e1ucx,ScootiepuffJUNIOR,5,Tue Jul 21 09:05:16 2015 UTC,With any other vendor just shoot em an email asking for discreet shipping. I'm sure any vendor would be willing to do so

You could always order some Nicotine Base liquid now and DIY, Flavourings and PG/VG will still be easy as hell to get. With the rest, normally shops can provide discreet packaging so you will probably be okay anyway. I know FastTech won't care and they have a tickbox to request discreet shipping, shops that don't have a checkbox will still probably be fine with it if you just email them.  Stick it out.

USPS checks about 1% of packages and if they're out of state the law isn't enforcible by fines to them is f it.   Set up a deal with your 90 min away shop to hook up you're juice one month at a time   Diy  Arkansas is doing this for revenue

electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,Wo0d643,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:32:06 2015 UTC,Nickel and titanium wire can release toxic gases if they're burned hot enough that's why they need tc. They're safe with tc and also to basically work decent you need to have a mod with atomizer lock because nickel changes resistance as it heats.

electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,ConqueefStador,3,Tue Jul 21 14:02:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had the MVP 3 and had to upgrade to the Pro version cause 30 watts doesn't cut it. You can build higher on the RTA, like .8 ohms and it will be fine on the MVP 3. The stock coils, try the .5 Ohms, they run pretty good at about 25 Watts."
electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,TEFL0N_D0N,2,Tue Jul 21 14:05:31 2015 UTC,I build by own coils so I guess I'll be fine with the MVP3 then! :) Thanks!

electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,IsABot,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:31 2015 UTC,They tried to release a high continuous drain battery that didn't go so well in reviews.  Basically re-wrapped battery that oversold on its specs.
electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,skivian,2,Tue Jul 21 14:43:37 2015 UTC,Any solid website to find reviews on vape gear? It seems with most vape products (tank/mods/coils etc) there always seems to be huge hype and great reviews to start so I buy it and 3 months later I'm looking for something to replace whatever I last bought cause it crapped out.

electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,WordBoxLLC,12,Tue Jul 21 07:22:37 2015 UTC,Jesus. You'd be able to watch the juice visibly drain as you vaped it.
electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,IsABot,4,Tue Jul 21 08:13:51 2015 UTC,"What's the issue here? It's not like it would drain any faster than a dripper at 150w, and some people enjoy it. Everyone always complains about killing juice fast, so what"
electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,look_at_the_sun,5,Tue Jul 21 11:59:50 2015 UTC,This. And I make my own so I don't even care how much I consume. I need a beast of a tank that can compete with my dripper so... I'll be checking reviews on this when I finally get away from work and catch up on everything I've promised to everyone on this sub this past week.

electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,ChiefChiefertons,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:15 2015 UTC,Because tanks are a pain in the ass to fill. A dripper takes a couple seconds. Not to mention 150W in a tiny ass chamber is just nuts. Most people running 150W in a dripper have huge amounts of airflow to help compared to a tank.  Tanks != Drippers
electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,Recreant57,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:35 2015 UTC,Top fill makes it very easy. The Lemo 2 and even the Goblin are a hell of a lot easier to refill than worrying about overfilling or spilling an rda. Plus the Goblin is as good as a dripper.
electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,Mattycore,2,Tue Jul 21 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree with everything you said.   Lemo 2 sucks to fill with glass dropper bottles. It's fine to fill with needle bottles. But even then, you have to hold it the right way when you fill otherwise it comes out the airholes. Happens on the majority of tanks. You get some that comes out the airholes, you end up having to blow it out and wipe with a towel. That doesn't happen on a dripper.   Both goblins suck at filling, both require screwdrivers, the mini uses a flat head which is even worse. And the goblin still doesn't compare to a dripper, it has small airflow. The mini does a better job because it's slotted so the holes are much larger, but filling it still sucks. Mini is the closest one out of the the 3 that is similar to a dripper, except most RDA's don't have airholes that face the hole of your 510 pin. Not really good if you don't want juice in your device.  If you spill or overfill an rda, you probably weren't paying attention. It's a user error, not a device issue. Granted, bottom airflow makes it a little more difficult, but if you are paying attention to what you are doing, and you wick properly, it's not an issue.  Source: I own all 3 tanks. I've bought the majority of RTAs that came out last year. I barely use any of them."
electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,jarvey45,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:29 2015 UTC,"I wish people would acknowledge this more and agree... I don't know what drippers people are using when they say ""the goblin is as good as a dripper,"" but I bought one because I kept seeing that and it's nowhere even close. Maybe if you have something with really small airflow like a tugboat, but any of the attys I have easily beat it out in airflow."
electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,Nigh7mare,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:00 2015 UTC,"The goblins are good tanks for tanks. But they don't really compare to drippers. The Goblin mini is much closer to a dripper than anything else. But it still has it's quirks. And it requires tiny coils. It'll never have the surface area of a decent RDA. I have dual 5 wrap claptons, which is about as much surface area as you can fit in there."
electronic_cigarette,3e1js4,ScootiepuffJUNIOR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's just a very small build deck. I'm getting a used Zephyrus and I'm hoping that the increased airflow helps, but I still see most people building the same exact thing as they did for the Goblin, which is 7-8 wraps of 26 AWG, 2.5mm ID. I don't really see how much different it can be when the only variable you're changing is airflow, but I hope I'll be impressed."

I don't get the appeal but he's got a lot of subscribers and just bought a brand new hellcat challenger so he must be doing something right.. Maybe i'm becoming an old fart because this guy really annoys the hell out of me lol"
electronic_cigarette,3e0kmj,VapingSmooth,2,Tue Jul 21 10:03:40 2015 UTC,Now I'm very curious as to whether that would would actually work...
electronic_cigarette,3e0kmj,TheCuteSquad,5,Tue Jul 21 02:25:21 2015 UTC,It would work.  If you took off the lock for the plunger so you could control how long it stayed down. It heats just like a normal atty.  Toaster companies but watch out they don't het a C&D from those guys going crazy about post-less drippers.  Cause toasters did it first.  Anyways. It's just ribbon kanthal.  Keep the cotton wet and don't overheat the coils.  Is it smart... no! Can you do it...?  Yes!!!
electronic_cigarette,3e0kmj,VapingSmooth,2,Tue Jul 21 03:41:52 2015 UTC,It's not smart but I can still do it you say? That means I'll do it!
electronic_cigarette,3e0kmj,SvartHrafn,2,Tue Jul 21 04:23:26 2015 UTC,I mean other than over heating the juice.   There isn't s hazard. Nothing will explode.   You won't short it.  Just juice the cotton and stick it on the kanthal. Get a metal straw like device and vape that shit to the skull
electronic_cigarette,3e0kmj,VapingSmooth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:39:01 2015 UTC,"Get a metal straw like device and vape that shit to the skull   A gallon jug cut horizontally and then cover the toaster like a hood.

electronic_cigarette,3e0kmj,bigbrentos,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:56 2015 UTC,You'll need to line itvwith foil as to deflect heat from the plastic.  Were in this for safety and science ha ha
electronic_cigarette,3e0kmj,VapingSmooth,0,Tue Jul 21 15:43:39 2015 UTC,"It'd be pretty much the equivalent of throwing weed on your lit stovetop. It'll catch fire and smoke, but it probably would be a total bitch to hit."
electronic_cigarette,3e0kmj,bigbrentos,2,Tue Jul 21 10:29:34 2015 UTC,Why would it burn? If you controlled how long the coils stayed heating?
electronic_cigarette,3e0kmj,VapingSmooth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:32:37 2015 UTC,"I was using the analogy to talk about throwing weed on a stove. I imagine for making a toaster vape, you would have to find a way to keep the filaments at the right temperature and like any other wick, only subject it to a few seconds of continuous heating at a time. The device turns bread crispy, not heat cotton hot enough until juice vaporizes off of it. It's possible, but all and all its fairly silly and wasteful. The point I was trying to make was how little satisfaction you'd get for how much product you would be wasting."
electronic_cigarette,3e0kmj,VapingSmooth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:19:31 2015 UTC,Oh yea.  It'd be like doing hot knife hash hits lol.  Such a toasty hit!!!

electronic_cigarette,3e1246,kwistenbiebel,4,Tue Jul 21 09:32:12 2015 UTC,"But that is not always how democracy works. Usually it is the loudest voice that is heard, or the group with the largest budget. The truth is that most Americans don't care one way or another about vapes. It is why there was a larger turn out of vapers verses the anti-vapers for SB140. Pushing it though this way is not a benifit to either side. If they tax the fuck out of it they loose all the tax money they would have gotten locally and giving that money to other states. SB140 is a lose lose bill should it pass."
electronic_cigarette,3e1246,Hugh_Jass_Clouds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:45:10 2015 UTC,"In the hive mind, SB140 is a win-win. It brings back lost money to the pocket of the government, it also lines the pockets of big companies. It also gets rid of aberrant addictive behaviour or at least controls it. It also benefits general health and it is good for the children of the hive. Win-win-win-win."
electronic_cigarette,3e1246,kwistenbiebel,2,Tue Jul 21 10:25:15 2015 UTC,"Yea. So your looking at the short term wins for the hive mind that is not speaking up. The hive mind really does not have much of a voice, but they do have Big Phrama behind them as seen based on the sponsers of SB140. We just need to keep tossing our voice around and showing the science that proves what we are doing is safer. With vapes we could remove a huge burden off the health care system. So long long term it is lose-lose-lose-lose."
electronic_cigarette,3e1246,Hugh_Jass_Clouds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:55 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that it is lose-lose , it's difficult to go against the queen bee strategies though.

electronic_cigarette,3e1246,kwistenbiebel,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:52:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly. These 'truth' about vaping videos love to shape and form the evidence without giving multiple points of view to make it appear as some big conspiracy. Yes there is money they want to grab, but these videos will never bring up public skepticism or that vaping is still very much link to tobacco in the publics eye and nobody has a problem with taxing tobacco."

I don't really like the form factor of the ipv3, seems bulky and outdated. The IPv4 looks sleeker but every review I've seen states the build quality might be lacking in some areas. Not sure if this holds true for the IPv4-s also.   And then it comes down to the wattage and joules issue. Supposedly now since the update everything on the ipv4-s works the same as the ipv3-li except for the ipv3-li being able to reach 200 watts.  Can anyone confirm this? I've heard conflicting things like that the ipv3-li can hit a 100 joules with ni-200 and that the ipv4-s cannot.   Help me make a choice!! Haha"

electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,_ism_,22,Tue Jul 21 12:20:05 2015 UTC,I would recommend getting an inexpensive starter kit like an ego one or a spinner (battery with adjustable voltage or wattage) with a nautilus mini tank and some 12mg nicotine ejuice. Cigalike Kits with prefilled juice weren't able to satisfy my cravings and seem to not be satisfying yours either.
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,cpmerrill,3,Tue Jul 21 12:32:45 2015 UTC,"I had the same experience.  Tried a cigalike for a week, it ended up in the trash.  6 more months I was on analog cigs, and a buddy suggested I try a Spinner with an Aerotank and 18mg juice (pack and a half a day for 20 years).  I went to the vape shop down the street from work, and that was the day I smoked my last cig.  That 18mg really did the trick, I got a hell of a nic buzz on the way back to work, and it was only a mile drive.  Fast forward 4 months, and now I'm on a Sigelei 50W with an assortment of rebuildable tanks and worked my way down to 6mg juice.  I don't think I could handle 18mg again, let alone 12mg."

Although I recommend a bigger battery solely due to all day charge. I went to a istick 20w after a week, it will run nautilus mini at 10w for 2 days. Worked for me and now 4 months cig free!"
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,Symz58,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:33 2015 UTC,"I would honestly say, i felt the same with the started Ego kit the other guy recommended after a little time. Definitely better than the cigalikes however. But it didn't satisfy me, I kept using the highest nicotine to get my fix, which is a normal thing at first.  Then you start getting into building your own atomizers. Which is hard to break into at first, but extremely satisfying. I could never use an eGO again. I would not be satisfied.  There is a lot of information you need to absorb to understand how to do it safely.  Don't get discouraged. You can buy some nice cheap mods and atomizaers  to start learning on Fastech.com, Just don't buy cotton, juice or batteries there."
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,ferola,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:57 2015 UTC,"honestly when i started vaping i was SO concerned with the looks of a vape.  but dude as time goes on and you see these devices' properties... you won't care.  i went from cigalikes to evods to an ego one to, now, a box mod."
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,xhris11,4,Tue Jul 21 18:24:39 2015 UTC,"Did some rough theories what could be your problem, very rough, stats taken from their homepage and estimation. Take it with a mountain of salt.  One V2Cig cartridge I would assume contains roughly 1ml of 2,4% (or 24mg/ml) e-liquid and they rate that 1 cart lasts you 400+ puffs. They also say it equivalents to a pack.  If so, if a pack contains 20 cigs that means 1 cig equals ~20 puffs, which comes out to ~1,2mg of nicotine. Most cigarettes contains 8-12mg of nicotine, but only ~1mg actually absorbs into your body. If the same applies to vaping that means you only absorb ~0.12mg of nicotine. This might be your problem.    Also, V2Cigs is honestly not the most satisfying vaping experience. So a lot of the satisfaction you can get from vaping, this device simply can't give you.    I would recommend upgrading, either to a Kanger EVOD with a Ego C Twist or Vision Spinner battery.   Or if you feel like stepping up another level, go with Nautilus Mini and an Eleaf Istick 20w or 30w vaping at 10-14w (my recommendation, if you don't mind the shape)   And the ""extreme"" option would be a Kanger Subox Mini kit. Or if you absolutely can't stand the box shape get an eGo One."
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,crappy_guitarist,3,Tue Jul 21 13:44:18 2015 UTC,"Vaping does not deliver nicotine the same way. In cigarettes, nicotine is delivered into your body via ammonia, which is why you feel the nicotine ""surge"", when taking a drag.   In vaping, there is no ammonia, so, while you get the nicotine, you don't feel it immediately.   I think 24mg (2.4%) is too high for you. That's why you're getting the sore throat. I smoked a pack a day, and started with 6mg (.6%), but I think it was too low.  Might I suggest trying a 12mg (1.2%)?"
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,crappy_guitarist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:29:46 2015 UTC,I may order some weaker ones in the future and try that. How long do you take to feel nicotine from vaping? I suppose I need to find a guide specifically for those using it to quit smoking and stave off withdrawal symptoms

electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,EZLivin42,4,Tue Jul 21 12:51:56 2015 UTC,"I disagree. That's because you're at low nicotine.   With high nicotine and a decent setup, you absolutely feel it strongly right away.   With 24mg juice from a pack a day, if you chain vape for a few minutes you should be waaay more than satisfied.   I think the thing for OP to keep in mind is that it's more of a constant delivery system than cigarettes. While it works, going to take a few puffs every couple hours like cigarettes isn't really the sweet spot for ecigs. Take a couple puffs every couple minutes when you're able. You'll probably find it more enjoyable that way."

electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,LikPik,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:18 2015 UTC,"I started out 15 months ago with two EVODs from KangerTech. My girlfriend and I wanted to quit smoking, but I hadn't budgeted for it, and didn't know what I was doing. It was an impulse visit to a local B&M, and my thoughts on the matter were that I needed a ""cigarette"" looking ecigarette. The shop owner did nothing to convince me otherwise.  EVODs are horrible. They are something like 3.5w, barely make any vapour, and barely heat up. I struggled for a year, trying to eliminate cigarettes systematically. I failed. I dropped close to $200 on the kit, an extra charger, terrible juice, and coils, and it was a total waste of money. I kept buying higher strength nicotine, lower PG/higher VG, different flavours... nothing worked. At this point, my sunk costs had hit around $350 and I was getting mad about it.  I went into a better shop and joined this group. I talked to people, got recommendations, got advice about why the juice was hurting my throat, and learned about RBAs, higher wattage, and better quality juice. I got a variable wattage device that was compatible with my EVOD tank, and then upgraded the tank after a few days to a glass atomizer.  I immediately cut the amount of analogs I was smoking in half. Within two days I was down to 6 analogs a day. Within a week I was down to 2 a day. Within two weeks, I had quit. That was two weeks ago, and I have not been tempted to smoke at all. I have been camping and fishing, gone drinking, spent time with smokers - basically, all my triggers, and have not been tempted. I do not feel deprived of anything at all.  My girlfriend has also quit. She hasn't had an analog in three days. She works with smokers, and they take group breaks, so it was much harder for her to stop smoking at work than me - I work from home. She's handling it like a boss, and half of her coworkers now want a mod.  Girlfriend has an iPV3 Li with a KangerTech Subtank Mini. She runs 6 to 12mg of nicotine on 20w. I have an eLeaf iStick 30w and a KangerTech GeniTank, and I vape 6mg at 5 to 11.5w. I am rebuilding her RTA coils for her, because she doesn't want to build coils, and I'm considering upgrading to an RTA myself, because I hate Kanger coils with a passion. She has her resistance at 0.5ohm and mine is 1.5ohm.  According to my quit smoking app, I have now officially not smoked 305 cigarettes, and saved myself $122. I'm not certain of the math, but I was already trying to cut down before I quit. Realistically, I would be saving myself around $80 a week, if I had not cut back previously. With my girlfriend smoking, that's $160 a week, or $640 per month.  We've purchased the new mods ($300 +/-), plus the new tanks ($100 +/-), some wire and cotton ($20), and some DIY juice making supplies ($100), and will not have to buy anything else for a very long time. I predict that we will hit our break even point within a month, at which point, we are saving ourselves $7680 per year.  We will still buy premade juice, because we love our vape shops, and some of their lines, but really, our costs will be less than $200 per year to vape, assuming we don't upgrade our gear, nothing breaks, and we continue to DIY juice.  We tried patches, gum, inhalers, and those cheap disposable ecigs you can buy at gas stations. Nothing else worked. Nothing even came close.  At first, we got headaches, sick to our stomach, our throats hurt a bit.. but we powered through all that. I should be choking up black goo at this point, and while I am a bit phlegmy, I'm not suffering much at all.  If you order online, you can get an iStick 30w and GeniTank for probably half what I paid at the B&Ms here.  It's literally the best decision we have ever made, and I am so grateful to this group, and our local vape shops.  TLDR: with the right gear, we quit really quickly, aren't super tempted to smoke, and are saving ourselves over seven grand a year by not smoking. It does work!"
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,BeauSlow,2,Tue Jul 21 15:31:17 2015 UTC,I strongly feel that those disposable kits are designed to be unsatisfying. It wasn't until I bought a real kit that I enjoyed vaping. I tried the blu things and it did nothing for me and died in less than a day.   I believe the disposables are owned by the same people who own tobacco companies and they're trying to keep you as a customer by convincing you that the healthier option is worse than just quitting altogether.

You can try a 18mg or 12mg with 40pg/60vg or 50/50. just remember this, pg gives you throat hit with less vaper. vg gives you less of of throat hit but more vaper. I don't know if you vape tobacco/ry4 juice but its hard to find that cig taste and throat hit. Fruit juices also have a sharper throat hit."
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,Uppuli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:13:28 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. These came with my kit:  http://www.v2cigs.com/products/v2-flavor-cartridges-5-pack I had mostly tried the Sahara and Congress flavors (supposed to be Camel and Parliament knockoffs, I guess) but also Vanilla and Coffee, which I loved the taste of, but none of them seemed to address the nicotine fix. Maybe I really needed to adjust my expectations, not my supplies?"
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,MightyPenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:46:49 2015 UTC,"My vaping journey started with the V2 products. I had their clear refillable cartridges and used their menthol at 18mg. I used menthol because it had nice sharp throat hit that kind of felt like smoking. I recall their e-liquid being all PG. I quit smoking using the V2 stuff but I remember missing the nicotine rush. After two or three weeks and upgrading I got over not having the nic rush. Your best bet is to get some better gear. The stuff on the market now is miles ahead of what cigalikes offer. The Nautilus Mini is a great start, and soooo much better than the tanks I first bought. The recommendations in these comments should steer you in the right direction. Don't be afraid of spending money. One can acquire a good setup for less than the cost of a crappy prefilled starter kit."
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,fukitol-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:48 2015 UTC,"Just my 2 cents, but don't force the change. Let it happen a little more naturally.  I was smoking 24-26 self-rolled cigarettes most days until October 2014 when I got my EVOD2 kit and 24mg juice. Cigarette consumption dipped to about 14 for awhile, then crept back up to around 18.  Got a 20w iStick and Nautilus BVC around Jan/Feb of 2015, and dropped my juice to 18mg in May because I was still on icky-sticks and sometimes got the nauseous feelings of too much nic. However, last week something clicked and Tuesday I only smoked 11. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday I smoked 2 each day. Saturday and Sunday (around other smokers) it bumpped up to 4 a day. And yesterday was only 3. Haven't had one (yet) today. I am still not off the smokes completely, but I'm starting to see an end to them in sight, and I feel that it is from not giving up, even when I was only smoking ""less."" See every single cigarette you don't smoke as a step towards victory IMHO."
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,fukitol-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"Very much this^  Straight up dropping cigs and picking up vaping can be a really tough transition, especially because the nicotine hits you differently. You don't have give them up completely right away, wean yourself off of them by adding in vaping in the beginning, not completely replacing them with vaping right away.  Don't beat yourself up over it if you slip up once in a while and have a cig, just don't go back to them full time. Eventually you won't even like them anymore. I still smoke cigs sometimes at work (but it would take me two weeks to go through a pack) because it gives me a chance to get out of the building and get a break for 10-15mins, and I get that nic fix so much faster. But it's like a love/hate relationship, I love the nic rush, and I love the feeling of smoke in my throat (no vapor compares, regardless of temperature, nic content or PG/VG ratio), but dear god do I hate the taste and smell..."

Looks like you are due for an upgrade. There are very knowledgeable people in this sub who will definitely help you out. And, the next setup I got after V2 was MVP2.0 with iClear 30s tank which are all completely outdated now.

It's hard to describe but I would want a real cigarette immediately after vaping.   You're getting the nicotine. What you're not getting is the other 600 or so chemicals formed as a result of combustion of the tobacco and all the shit they treat it with. Basically just stick through it. The cravings for these other chemicals will wane, nicotine is the big one.  Switching to a super airy cloud setup helped me through this, because when I tried smoking again afterward I found the draw super tight and the cloud unsatisfying."

electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,laughingbovine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:04 2015 UTC,When I started vaping 5 years ago it took me a while to give up cigs complelty.  For the first month I smoked while vaping.  Gradually tapering down on cigs.  The only ejuice I found to be as satisfying as a cigarette was either dekang and hansung (don't think i spelled either right) 24mg USA mix.
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,Irishhavoc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:12 2015 UTC,"The reason is simple. You absorb nicotine much more slowly from vaping than from smoking. I used to have a really great graph that showed blood nicotine concentration over time for vaping versus smoking. I don't know how to find it, but basically for smoking, the nicotine level shoots up to max concentration within seconds of beginning to smoke a cigarette and then plateaus around that level, while for vaping, it steadily rises over 20 minutes before finally reaching the same level you get from smoking. And that's with high-nicotine juice. One of the key reasons is that vapor molecules are about 100x larger than smoke molecules. Your lungs simply can't absorb vapor anywhere near as efficiently as they absorb smoke."

electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,Targren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:18 2015 UTC,"Cigs have other stuff than nicotine which I think is why I get really pissed off at people when I haven't smoked but feel a little shaky when I haven't vaped.  Try smoking when you really need it, and get it as little as possible and let your body slowly adjust. The e cig will be there as a 'rag to bite' to reduce the withdrawals and mental cravings."

Smoking is a tough habit to break.  As others have said, get better stuff too."
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,kanliot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"When I started vaping, killing cravings was odd. It would take a bit longer than I expected for my craving to give and I would wind up over vaping as a result (headache etc). Then again I was not as heavy a smoker as you so YMMV.  Another thing to consider is that your craving might be tied to other things, not just nicotine. A big thing for me was the whole ""inhale/exhale smoke"" thing. In that respect the cigalikes are pretty awful. I would suggest upgrading. The Aspire Nautilus (any size) is basically a golden standard for intermediate vapors now... you should give that a try."
electronic_cigarette,3e2b2w,Boricano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in addition to the nicotine problem, it was also an unsatisfying throat hit. (Not sure I'm using that term right.) Somehow, I guess because I'm used to it, the awful tar and additive laden tobacco smoke hitting my throat feels so much better in comparison to the ""clinical/burning plastic"" taste of the v2 vapor. Like, smoking and vaping both irritate my throat, but vaping just irritated it in a different and less satisfying way. Addiction is so dumb, here I am talking about how great cigarettes feel when they irritate my throat compared to something safer :/"

Cig-alikes like the V2 kit are first-gen sort of stuff, they work like ass, taste like ass, and are generally just ass. Whether or not the theories about ""intentionally unsatisfying"" are true, the simple fact is that they don't work well.   For less than $30, you can get an entry-level battery/mod, a simple tank, and a bit of juice online (maybe $50 if you buy in a B&M instead). The difference is night and day.   The crappy gas-station ecigs never got me more than a day without smoking - at best, they were an alternative to going outside to smoke while I was tied up in an MMO and couldn't leave without pissing off my guildies.   I got started with a cheap eGo battery and a plastic kanger tank (don't do this, BTW. Go pyrex from the get go) and had my last cigarette 4 days later."

Second is Mt.Baker because I got a bad batch of juice and they refunded me in store credit(Juice is gonna be here today awwww yeaaaa) Finally this one isnt a personal one but mu close friend picked up some juice from Mitten vapors flash sale and they misplaced his order and after an email or two back and forth his juice is on the way along with a little extra and thats some quality customer service"
electronic_cigarette,3e3cl7,chuutoro,5,Tue Jul 21 17:17:16 2015 UTC,That seems crazy it would only last for 4ml. I have an Istick 30W which is 2200 mah compared to 2600mah for the TC and I can vape 10ml at 30W before I have to recharge. That doesn't seem to add up.

electronic_cigarette,3e3cl7,WhoKnowsWho2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:00 2015 UTC,I've never seen battery life this bad. Could be related to the battery heat problem I am seeing.
electronic_cigarette,3e3cl7,pencilvanian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:30 2015 UTC,I've never seen battery life this bad. Could be related to the battery heat problem I am seeing.    How does the battery life compare with the rdna40? It's a comparable 40w single battery mod.
electronic_cigarette,3e3cl7,kamros,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review, ive noticed that the battery life on mine is also pretty bad."
electronic_cigarette,3e3cl7,normsteadman,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review. I'm surprised at the short battery life, since I thought TC was meant to conserve juice and battery both."
electronic_cigarette,3e3cl7,kamros,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"It should, but you can only control the temp, not the watts. So the mod is always set at 40 watts and throttles back from there. Works great for a RDA since i usually have it set at around 40 watts anyways."
electronic_cigarette,3e3cl7,chaoticgeetarz,2,Tue Jul 21 17:31:37 2015 UTC,"I'm actually really happy with mine.  I've gotten a full days use vaping at 37watts using my Aspire Atlantis with extended thank and V2 coils and going through about 6ml of 50\50 a day.  Not a single heat issue when charging or using.  It's been pretty solid.    Edit:  At first the battery was acting weird.  Telling me I was at low battery about half the day, then it jumped up to about 3/4 after putting it down for a few minutes.  The last 3 days I have not had a problem."
electronic_cigarette,3e3cl7,owllady,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:04 2015 UTC,Is it supposed to get super hot like that?  Is that a sign that it is defective?

electronic_cigarette,3e3cl7,kortirion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:43 2015 UTC,"You should call them and see.  I don't think it is supposed to do that.  It does not sound right to me.  I have mods that get warm, but not super hot to the touch.  Though I do not have a temperature control mod, I do not think they are supposed to get that hot.  With the Isticks and their bad quality control, I would not be surprised that the one you have is defective."

electronic_cigarette,3e2p8a,vape3a,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:44 2015 UTC,200 watt + TC would be awesome. 200 watt + TC would still be awesome. Done and done.
electronic_cigarette,3e2p8a,KittenRaffle,3,Tue Jul 21 16:54:39 2015 UTC,I'm curious to know why there is ego threading on a 200 watt device. It's difficult for me to form an opinion considering there's not much information on it. Also I'm weary on any chip that is not yihi or dna when it comes to temp control.  this one:   https://www.3avape.com/mods/sigelei-150w-temp-control-box-mod.html  Would love a $2000 mod   registered.

electronic_cigarette,3e3gp5,Jajebooo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:56 2015 UTC,"I think you're mostly getting downvoted because this is a recurring topic of discussion, and one that has two highly opinionated camps.  I was in my then local B&M about a year ago, back when I was still living in the UK, and the guy showed me a mech of some sort, I can't remember which one it was. I just remember unscrewing the top and letting out an involuntary ""wow!"" at how smooth the threads were, something I'd never experienced before. Obviously the standard of manufacture and machining was much higher than I was used to from my horde of clones.  I can appreciate the work, research, care, craftsmanship and everything that goes into mods and atties, and for regulated mods I will always buy authentic.  But let's be honest, if generic acetylsalicylic acid is 32p a box and Bayer Aspirin is £2.10, I know what I'm going for."

electronic_cigarette,3e3gp5,James0015,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't ever knowingly buy clones. Clones typically don't perform the same as an authentic but that is my main reason.  I like to show support for these companies do I choose to buy authentics. Plus I think it's cooler to have a bunch of authentics than clones.   It's weird though because I pirate music (mostly unless they are small artists), movies and recently games. For whatever reason hardware I choose to buy it authentic."

I would choose to talk about such topics on forums, not sure if you'll get the ""good discussion"" people here unless you're talking about something else.  I've personally only purchased a few authentics, Lemo 2 being one of them but to be completely honest I can't tell much of difference between build quality - they all seem to have slight imperfections or quirks, sometimes clones more than authentics. Price obviously keeps me from going all out with authentics...  Thanks, good topic :)"
electronic_cigarette,3e3gp5,barchambault51,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:42 2015 UTC,"That's very true, I think that the clones fit a good niche in the market, but they're not for me!  And you're welcome, thanks for contributing your thoughts :)"
electronic_cigarette,3e3gp5,barchambault51,3,Tue Jul 21 19:23:06 2015 UTC,Honestly I buy authentic mods and tanks but clone RDA's. The RDA's perform pretty comparably to their authentic counterparts. On the other hand mods and tanks do not.
electronic_cigarette,3e3gp5,PorkRollAndEggs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted, but that's exactly where my problem is with clones. My first setup was a stingray and vertex v2 clone. No matter what I did, how many times I washed or deep cleaned that atomizer it would always taste like brass! My stingray would short on me sometimes because the switch would hardly ever make an even connection!   I've got friends who swear by fasttech and the clone market, but I try to stay away unless there are a lot of reviews out there for a product."

electronic_cigarette,3dzoua,vapingrammy,11,Mon Jul 20 21:38:23 2015 UTC,"Most definitely not. Vaping didn't actually cure anything for this man, it just helped him get off cigarettes, which in turn removed the harmful side-effects of smoking. Which is great and incredible for him, but Vaping itself didn't do anything other than provide a replacement for his bad habit."
electronic_cigarette,3dzoua,bluePMAknight,3,Mon Jul 20 21:48:24 2015 UTC,Correct hence why i phrased it as i did...vaping just helped me quit smoking which led to better circulation which in return helped the Bells palsy

This will not resolve permanent damage but will give you the nutrient levels you need and could help.    That being said, Soylent is a food product and is not a medicine and has not been claimed to or tested to cure any disease. (legal ass-cover)"

I could never feel that part of my leg since the accident. The surgeon said I would never feel that part of my leg again.  A month later, I quit smoking. My eGo ONE starter kit arrived and I had my last cigarette before opening the box.  Ever since, the affected area of my leg has been shrinking more and more. It started with a buzzing, then I pressed my hand to my leg. I couldn't feel it, but I could feel pressure. So I decided to test it. I threw a pot of water on to boil and threw a sewing needle in. After half an hour, I pulled the needle out, let it cool, and stabbed my leg.  I still can't feel the skin, but I actually felt the needle! The skin didn't hurt, but BOY did the flesh sting!  A month later when I went to see my doctor and informed him about my leg slowly returning to normal.  Doctor said it was because of smoking that it wasn't healing properly."

electronic_cigarette,3e2m0i,Jensen189,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:01 2015 UTC,I have been reading about the diacetyl a lot recently and am concerned over the juices that I have been using.  I read that the njoy artist collection is ok but i just picked up birdbrains by cuttwood.   What's the deal with this?  Should I be concerned ?  Have they been tested ?
electronic_cigarette,3e2m0i,OfBlinkingThings,3,Tue Jul 21 14:24:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about cuttwood, but there are many vendors who are diacetyl free. You can always email and ask before ordering.   As far as your concern...it's up to you. Read the research and research for yourself. I avoid diacetyl, but some of my juices have AP, which is another chemical that is under the spotlight. Personally, I'm not too freaked out and believe the industry will quickly adapt and find alternatives. I'm not sweating short term exposure."
electronic_cigarette,3e2m0i,turdfire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Allegedly, from what I've discerned, juices from Five Pawns, Suicide Bunny and Cuttwood, may have (or had) the issue. It's not the entire lines, just certain flavors. I noticed a long shortage of SB's Mother's Milk a few months back, and now everyone has it on clearance? Was it the old batches that were bad? Was the shortage due to a recall or halt in production? Who knows.  So I encourage you, and everyone, to do their own research and make informed decisions instead of just accepting my or anyone else's opinion. I'm a software architect, not a chemist. Everything you consume (ie. food, media, water, etc.) should be given that same level of scrutinization, not just ejuice, IMHO.  With that said, I feel strongly that whatever affect DA or AP have, in the short term, are far less harmful than smoking 40 analogs a day (which I stopped doing 9 months ago because of vaping).  In all honesty, I'd be more concerned about the damage done by GMOs and the chemicals in our pesticides, if I was looking for a truly harmful boogeyman."
electronic_cigarette,3e2m0i,vapemonst34,0,Tue Jul 21 17:50:32 2015 UTC,I'm a newb to vape and was wondering about safety as well. Do you vape as an alt to cigs? What nicotine level do you use? Will this get you as high as weed? Wondering about general benefits you see.
electronic_cigarette,3e2m0i,Jensen189,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:28 2015 UTC,.I smoked cigars weekly or so but that was about it.  I am using it as a method to control my sweet tooth when I cut weight to compete. I started off at 6 nicotine and will work my way down to 0.  I wanted to set the behavior and I figured nicotine is known to control appetite. After a few weeks I will be conditioned to it and should be able to control cravings with zero. Sounds kind of weird but it's worked quite well.
electronic_cigarette,3e2m0i,vapemonst34,0,Tue Jul 21 15:31:05 2015 UTC,"Using vaping as a diet aid? Why not just eat less instead of adding nicotine to your system if you're not a smoker. Always heard from my buddies, don't use nic if you aren't already addicted. OK to play with smoke and fiddle with your hands if you need to, but why would a nonsmoker add an addictive drug to the mix. I've been a smoker for 15 years, and finally I am nicotine free for several months. Nicotine is addictive and you get grumpy if you don't have it after awhile. There have to be better ways to control a sweet tooth than puffing chemicals. What about rebound weight when you stop? Happened to me with cigs. Really trying to focus on health as I get older.  EDIT: 6 mg is enough to get addicted. 3 mg is too. Other users have warned about it. Body becomes used to it and you don't even realize it. https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2ra0qy/can_i_get_addicted_vaping_3_and_6mg/"
electronic_cigarette,3e2m0i,Jensen189,0,Tue Jul 21 15:50:05 2015 UTC,Yeah. I understand what you're saying.  I have smoked cigars and chewed in the past as sort of something to do to help keep me occupied. This only happens when I'm on a weight cut to get ready to compete.  The nicotine is only going to be present for a very short while so I can associate the flavors with that satisfaction.   I know myself and am not worried about getting hooked as I've been doing it for years on and off.   Just trying to actually make it healthier down the line.
electronic_cigarette,3e2m0i,vapemonst34,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:22 2015 UTC,"Compete in what, out of curiosity. How long is the cut? Good luck with it man. I'm new to this and trying to read as much as possible on safety. Had a terrible run with nic and cigs. Not trying to force my ideas on you."

Major component in juice is propylene glycol. Wouldn't suck it into my lungs if u wasn't trying to quit smoking."
electronic_cigarette,3e2m0i,Jensen189,0,Tue Jul 21 17:08:08 2015 UTC,Yeah lung function isn't an issue.  I really only will Vape when I have a craving. It's not much
electronic_cigarette,3e2m0i,vapemonst34,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah you may not think so. How many miles can you run? If you're still reaching for the twinkies, heard meth and heroin also cut appetite. No diacetyl worries then."
electronic_cigarette,3e2m0i,zach797a,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:46 2015 UTC,"Diacetyl and the other things similar to it are mostly up to whether you feel comfortable with vaping it. I haven't seen any definitive evidence whether it's bad or fine for us, but only middle ground info. If it's not a huge deal, I would avoid whatever makes you uncomfortable to vape!"

Bombies does max VG and most people around here like them - personally, I think they're ok but overhyped and overpriced (bring on the down votes!!)  There were some juice lines I just tried this past weekend at the Vape League convention in Chicago that were amazing - those were: Vigilante's Twig & Berries line, Lock & Harbor (newer company out of Dayton, OH), No Name (Brew City's max VG line - out of Milwaukee), and Independent Vapor Co. out of Michigan."

electronic_cigarette,3e2iih,Portaljacker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"Got my new rig on Friday, 2nd pic is my 1st rig. Loving thevaporist.org, my order was big enough that my free shipping counted for same-day delivery since they're here in Montreal!  I'd been extremely casually vaping (0mg banana flavour, which was wonderful) with my old rig which I mostly got for testing to see if it was easy enough to give to my mom to help her quit (not sure still...plus I'd have to get one for my step-dad since quitting is easier together). But I felt like I wanted to try something a bit more fun.  So I saw an iTwist 50W on sale for $38CAD down from $60CAD. No warranty but tested before delivery. I got a Nautilus Mini and the nice metal latticework replacement tank to go with it. The juice I'm using is called Deer's Delight and it's really good!  I got it with 3mg of nicotine, because I honestly wanted to see the effects on me. I have a bit of anxiety and need help focusing and I've heard those are both things nicotine helps with when it's not being super addictive. I haven't used it too much yet but I honestly don't notice anything different feeling about me (I think?) but I'll keep up with it to see. It could be similar to how caffeine usually has little to no effect on me. I've drank some of those dumb energy drinks that have taurine in them and feel like maybe the slightest bit not tired after. I dunno.  Anyway, hope you enjoy my pictures! The 2nd one showing my first rig is just a V3 eGo Spinner with a Nautilus."

electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,nolvera506,12,Tue Jul 21 11:40:31 2015 UTC,Going over your batteries continuous amp rating can cause your battery to vent.
electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,I8G,3,Tue Jul 21 11:41:44 2015 UTC,"This exactly. Say amp limit is X, you go over X battery go boom"
electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,Wavingurpowersaround,6,Tue Jul 21 13:41:08 2015 UTC,"That's a gross oversimplification, and borderline fear mongering.  A batteries continuous discharge limit is the point where the amperage flowing through the battery generates enough heat that it can just be dissipated enough to keep it below a certain temperature and avoid thermal runaway and internal damage. Once it gets hot enough caused by this buildup you get thermal runaway as the internal resistance also increases with a higher temperature, increasing the heat buildup in the battery. At 25A on a 20A battery, this heat buildup could take minutes if ever before the battery goes dead. After all continuous discharge is saying X amperage for the ENTIRE charge of the battery. On a 2Ah battery with a limit of 20A, this is 6 minutes at a 20A draw. When was the last time you took a 6 minute long drag? It is NOT some hard limit where at 20.1A on a 20A limit the thing blows up like an IED.  Instead going over the limit puts you into a situation where A) You are damaging the battery by reducing it's life and capacity by overdrawing it and B) You get enough wattage heating the battery itself via internal resistance that the battery's temperature becomes an issue.  This is why guys in FB groups are pulsing single 18650 batteries at 30, 40, or 50A. The batteries can supply it, but with no hard testing you are in a situation where heat buildup becomes an issue it is impossible to tell the length of time the battery can run at that amperage before reaching a critical temperature. It's risky, but going over the continuous discharge limit does NOT turn your mod into a pipe bomb immediately."
electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,AbramsLullaby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:42 2015 UTC,"True. I regularly throw 0.12Ω builds on my VTC4s (35A), and I've never had an issue. Of course, I'm always paying extra attention to them when I do this, but there's never been an issue."
electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,Centrifuge28,0,Tue Jul 21 17:54:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Typical use in a vaping device is very far from what would constitute a continuous discharge. The peak discharge rating is probably more applicable here. I believe the manufacturers usually consider that to be the maximum safe amperage for 10-30 second bursts, and even 10 seconds is a long time to be pulling from a vaping device. It's just a matter of managing heat."
electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,TheShawnAvery,2,Tue Jul 21 18:06:28 2015 UTC,"This, and always check http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/ how to build within safe limits."
electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,xhris11,4,Tue Jul 21 14:09:47 2015 UTC,"The reason to be concerned or better yet, educated, is that amps are a measure of the energy through the circuit, the circuit in a mech mod includes the battery, the switch, the inside body of the mech (assuming tube mod here) and the atty. The higher the amps the more energy running through the circuit which builds up heat, the differing resistances of each part of the circuit is why your coil gets hot and depending on how many amps you are running how hot your switch, mod and battery get. This is why it's important to know amp limits and ohms law because as the amps increase things will get hotter. Max continuous ratings are given because for example a Samsung 25R can be ran at 20 amps continuously without getting hot enough (100'C+) to go into thermal runway, running a build low enough to go above 20 amps on a battery rated for 20 amps and you're basically playing with fire, whilst batteries can pulse higher you should build with continuous ratings in case of mechanical auto fire."
electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,summerhaze,4,Tue Jul 21 13:48:31 2015 UTC,those batteries are rated for 20a continuous  basically keep you builds above .21 and you're fine.
electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,SYEPCY,2,Tue Jul 21 11:51:26 2015 UTC,Alright thanks. I have all my builds at .26. Vape on :)
electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,bobbysavage,2,Tue Jul 21 11:56:14 2015 UTC,Amps = Voltage/Resistance       also written as   I=V/R    I - Amps  V - Volts  R - Resistance   So you said you are at .26 resistance  Your battery = 4.2 Volts @ full charge  I=4.2/0.26     so you are pushing about 17 amps.   edit: 17A at nominal (full) charge. My batteries will drop to about 3.7 volts before I feel the need to charge.  You shouldn't make a habit of over-discharging your batteries either (below 3.5-3.7V)

electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,futiledevices,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on the box.  Dual 18650s in parallel would increase your available amps, so yes in that case."
electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,Irishhavoc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:35 2015 UTC,"He asked about regulated though. Most chips run in series with a buck or boost, and the chip itself usually tops at 20 amps, but with a max voltage of 7.5 to 9.something. 20 amps at 7.5 volts is going to land you in the 150 watt range with a 0.3ish ohm coil on an unregulated. Built in safeties in the chip let you build to usually 0.1 on the 100 watt+ mods, and while still drawing 20 amps, they allow you to hit high wattages. I'm not an expert in any means, im just sharing the information I know, and I don't know it all, like how the chips do what they do, I only know that they do it."
electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,futiledevices,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:48 2015 UTC,"This is true - series batteries, a boost regulator, and safety protections of the chip allow for lower resistances as well.  Never understood why people felt the need to build so low on regulated devices though."
electronic_cigarette,3e27d6,TacoDelPaco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:29 2015 UTC,What question are you answering? This just seems like you're keeping people ignorant to battery safety.

We all need to have a sense of humor in our work. However, dying from smoking is not a laughing matter. Neither is being addicted to cigarette smoking and being unable to quit. Nor is being fearful of dying prematurely because of an addiction that you cannot easily overcome. When smokers try to quit by switching to e-cigarettes, it is a very serious matter. It's about their health and their lives. I don't find it something to joke about. Nor do I think it is appropriate to call those people idiots because they are forced to go to such extremes to try to break the smoking addiction.  This is what I am all about. Vaping is a positive way to stop smoking and smoking is killing 400,000 people every year and that is not something to laugh about. In my opinion tobacco companies are murders and they need to stop. Vaping can bring this to fruition."

electronic_cigarette,3e3jly,phelyan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't used a mech mod since that isn't my thing. Although wire I use is 24 26 28 really all the same, just you need to wrap the 24 more than the 28 to get the same ohm reading. Imo there's no reason to get a mech and just get regulated but that's my opinion. Since you will always be getting drop off in power with mech as it's not regulated."

Set it to check resistance, clip the leads together and it will give you how much resistance is in the leads. Then all you do is subtract that from what it reads on the coil."

electronic_cigarette,3e0ixv,causeicancan,59,Tue Jul 21 02:10:54 2015 UTC,"I hope you see this reply. DO NOT CONTACT HR. They will not protect you. You were in uniform as such you are a representative of the company. Anything you do or say while in uniform must align with your companies image and policies. I agree with you that a 2 day suspension is absurd, but if you want to keep your job take the two day suspension. When you return to work ask to speak with your manager. Don't point fingers at the smokers, rather review your break policy as it regards to smoking and address the vaping as if you were smoking. Ask for compromise ie if your boss is okay with you vaping in your car or behind a dumpster while in uniform. If he says no then take your uniform off and walk off the property for your break to vape. But having a rational conversation trying to compromise will get you further than lodging an HR complaint. Again, it sucks that you have to do this. However if you want/need to keep your job this is your best course of action. Hopefully you can reach a compromise."

Im just gonna take my 2 days off to come up with a reasonable response to my boss and the guy over him and find a way i could vape and not bother anyone. Maybe a smaller ego or something i could carry and use and just hold the vape in long enough that when i exhale its little to nothing. Anyways we will see what the future holds."

electronic_cigarette,3e0ixv,bananarap,3,Tue Jul 21 10:19:28 2015 UTC,"I realize it's probably hot there but you might ask about putting on a jacket or something to obscure the uniform.  I think they may give you a hard time with anything that isn't a cigalike and won't be swayed if you say you'll hold in the vape.    Not a popular opinion, but I kinda get where they're coming from though believe the suspension to be ridiculous.  There are so many people that just assume vapor is weed smoke, I've run into it with people I consider pretty darn sharp.    I'm all for taking a stand but you need to eat.  Perhaps ask to see the policy where this is outlined.  Good luck!"

electronic_cigarette,3e0ixv,Crapgeezer,2,Tue Jul 21 08:30:47 2015 UTC,"What state do you live in? Many states have ""Smoker Protection Laws,"" which generally prohibit employers from refusing to hire, disciplining, or firing employees due to the employee's use of a lawful consumable product on non-working hours off company property. It's worth taking a look at whether your state has one, and what its precise language actually is. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoker_Protection_Law.  However, even if you live in one of the states with a Smoker Protection Law, don't get too cocky. There are usually many exceptions to such laws, including where it creates a conflict of interest in the duties the employee owes to the employer. That might be arguable where you're still wearing your uniform. I don't think you're anywhere near the point where you should be talking to an attorney; just work out a compromise with your boss if possible. Plus, the remedies are often very limited--in my state, damages are strictly limited to lost wages and benefits caused by a violation; there aren't any punitive damages or other corrective measures allowed."
electronic_cigarette,3e0ixv,available_username2,6,Tue Jul 21 14:04:31 2015 UTC,Call regional hr.

My old boss would go for his after-lunch cigarette to the side (but decent foot-traffic and totally open/visible) of the building where the smokers went with the butt-pod. I went out to smoke one while he was out there at the same time one day, and the dude's smoking a joint - He was just presentable and didn't look like he was hiding anything but after I got to be personal friends with him, I found out he had been doing it daily for years.

electronic_cigarette,3e3cqy,saintcazorla,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:16 2015 UTC,I have found exhaling through both my mouth and nose simultaneously gives me a lot more flavor. If I exhale solely through my nose I get the same wet feeling you're talking about which isn't all that pleasant.
electronic_cigarette,3e3cqy,dupedgg,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:46 2015 UTC,It feels weird. I thought I was moving the snot in my nose but water droplets make more sense.
electronic_cigarette,3e3cqy,wheresandrew,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:11 2015 UTC,"not a shit post. Everyone deals with the water in the nose. its a pain in the ass. but i do it because blowing it out of my mouth causes my beard to soak. lesser of 2 evils, i guess"
electronic_cigarette,3e3cqy,crappy_guitarist,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:28 2015 UTC,Blowing out my nose too much causes my pedo stache to get damp as well.

It is uncomfortable, but necessary to get that delicious flavor."

electronic_cigarette,3e3cqy,PandaEatsRage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:27 2015 UTC,I have freaky taste buds and senses. I only get flavor/scent from my nose on the inhale. And not the exhale. So dont really bother with it

electronic_cigarette,3e2ib8,adultishgambino1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:12 2015 UTC,Kindly tell them that theres no reason for them to be doing this. The number on it is good enough. I dont know why a company in China is checking for fraud when they sell extremely discounted items.
electronic_cigarette,3e2ib8,Auxx,2,Tue Jul 21 14:04:04 2015 UTC,Because fraud and they don't have a better way.  Everyone should use PayPal for online shopping. No PayPal = no deal.

Some of their Flavours are rubbish (I'm looking at you ""Extreme Soda"") Others are fantastic (Sticky Bun, Hawk Sauce, Thug Juice, Blue Moo)  What really ensured my loyalty was on my last order they forgot a bottle in the parcel, I emailed them about it, they shipped it to me in Australia free of charge, no horseshit in store credit that would cost me twice as much to ship here, just a straight up company.  +1 MBV"

But we have access to free health care and if you are unemployed the government will give you $250 a week just for looking for work and gives elderly people about $350 - $400 a week if they have no savings to support themselves in retirement.  thats not even mentioning our minimum wage being pretty high and employees having alot of rights at work (paid maternity leave)  tl;dr shit is expensive here but income is pretty high too."

electronic_cigarette,3e1ary,Verraad,2,Tue Jul 21 06:24:30 2015 UTC,Good to know! It was my first online purchase and I ordered a huge 230ml bottle before sampling it. Was kind of bummed about the taste but here is to hoping another two weeks to a month will drastically improve the juice.
electronic_cigarette,3e1ary,SnapCrack1ePop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:29:04 2015 UTC,In my experience it becomes really creamy after about a month and a half where it tastes a lot less like blueberry syrup and more like a soft blueberry macaroon

electronic_cigarette,3e1ary,allaboutthatvapes,3,Tue Jul 21 06:01:35 2015 UTC,"I always get quick shipping from them and I am on the other side of the states. I DIY now, but still order their flavorings sometimes to do some lazy DIY at a better price. They were my first online site so I always have a place for them. Plus, when my taste had changed and I ordered a juice I used to like and was disappointed with they refunded it even after I denied the refund. They really do put effort into your service. Even though I see them as a bit of a vendor for newbies, I still see them as a valuable part of this community. Some eventually shit on them as being budget juice, but whatever gets you started on vaping and off of smokes is not shit in my book."

electronic_cigarette,3e1ary,Ashonym,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:35 2015 UTC,"Spicy? It's supposed to be a smooth blueberry custard/crumble. I've never heard of jizmoglobin being spicy. If your coils are old, it could be that, or perhaps the juice you were using before. It could even be your tastebuds, similar to how cilantro tastes weird to some people. Have someone else try it, if you can, and see what they think. If it's still spicy, get in touch with MBV. They will either issue a refund or offer you something else."

Last order I got was Hawk Sauce and Thug Juice (both with one extra flavor shot). The Hawk Sauce was alright (kind of tasted like crayons though) but the Thug Juice was seriously unusable because of how insanely intense the menthol was. It was like chugging mouthwash.  I liked MBV when I first started vaping because the juice is cheap and it ships quickly, but the juice flavor profiles are kind of meh."
electronic_cigarette,3e1ary,WillCreary,2,Tue Jul 21 08:07:35 2015 UTC,"Each flavor will vary depending on what device you are using. When I first discovered MBV, I was still vaping fruit flavors. Hawk Sauce was really good in a Vivi Nova, but not good in an Aerotank. Now, I prefer the dessert flavors (cinnamon roll, Sweet creme, vanilla cupcake, Jizmoglobin, etc) and they are almost always great from the start.   I've never tried thug juice though."
electronic_cigarette,3e1ary,Speezix,2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:31 2015 UTC,The juices definitely need time to steep I ordered a dutch apple pie 80/20 blend and I thought it was great right out of the box

electronic_cigarette,3e1ary,Nerdasaurusrexx,2,Tue Jul 21 11:03:40 2015 UTC,+1 for Mechsauce.  Just got my first order in and I have to say I'm blow away.  Gonna be putting in an order for a few 120ml bottles and maybe even a 500ml.  It takes about 10 days to get to your door but it's absolutely worth it.  Just put your order in before you need the juice.
electronic_cigarette,3e1ary,Verraad,2,Tue Jul 21 12:44:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I love Mt Baker. I have nothing but good things to say about their juice. I first ordered from them a few months ago when the Zamplebox circle jerk was happening and I've been buying from them ever since. I get the 236ml bottles. Moo Juice is definitely my favorite that I've tried so far. Everything always ships very quickly. I always get my order 2-3 days after actually placing the order. I'm going to continue buying from them!
electronic_cigarette,3e1ary,Yoy0lol,3,Tue Jul 21 06:19:40 2015 UTC,"All of these people have great experiences with mt baker, I've only had one and it's been terrible so far. I ordered my juice and got it about 4 days later, as soon as I opened the package all I smelled was a weird mixture of alcohol and chemicals. Tried to vape some of my juices and they tasted like complete ass.    Steeped them for two weeks, still smelled rank and tasted horrible. Emailed them and they said to steep with the cap off so they can vent, did that for 3 days. Still taste terrible. They're still steeping in my pantry, have been with the cap off for 6 days now. I'm going to try again tomorrow but my hopes aren't high at all."
electronic_cigarette,3e1ary,purple91gsr,0,Tue Jul 21 07:01:10 2015 UTC,"Stick with them man, they take a long while to be where I consider them delicious, I'll vape hawk sauce for example as soon as it arrives and it tastes like straight syrup, after its been vented and steeped for a long time (think 1 month+) is where it hits homeruns."
electronic_cigarette,3e1ary,clumz,2,Tue Jul 21 10:03:42 2015 UTC,"MBV is great!  There was a time I ordered 6 30ML bottles of different flavours. When I got my parcel and opened it up, I noticed that the bottles were in fact 15ML. Funny thing is, the label on the bottle clearly said ""30ML.""  Anyway, to keep it short: I contacted customer service via live chat and showed them a picture of my order via Google Drive. The customer service rep goes ""Okay. Seems like we shipped you 15ML bottles instead of 30ML bottles. We are going to send you the correct order now, free of charge.""  I was shocked. No ""let me speak with my manager"" no ""we need to investigate the issue"" it was as simple as 1 - 2 - 3. The new order came a few days later.  I basically got my original order +15ml juices."

In general, the device can fire as low as 0.2Ω. 0.3Ω.  At 50W, that's a tad over 15A under 13A, you just want to make sure your battery can handle that amp limit (continuous, not pulse).  So far, I've only used the 1.5Ω head, lasted maybe 5 days, but it may have been a bum coil, not sure.  FWIW, the rba base is easy to use, and vapes really good."
electronic_cigarette,3e2guc,teke367,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:20:49 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the info.   Is the amp limit over or under? Meaning for 15 amps like you mentioned, I want a a battery with >15 or <15? Sure I know the answer but just covering bases."
electronic_cigarette,3e2guc,Lanczer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:37:55 2015 UTC,"Kanger actually recommends a 20A limit or higher. I use samsung 25R and have never had a problem. As far a charging goes, I use a Nitecore D2 and would recommend it. Ive seen a few threads on peoples Suboxes stop working after using the USB charger."
electronic_cigarette,3e2guc,ColorblindGiraffe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:16 2015 UTC,Actually I think it fires up to 0.3 ohms.
electronic_cigarette,3e2guc,teke367,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:17:45 2015 UTC,"yep, you're right, I'll correct."
electronic_cigarette,3e2guc,Byron808,4,Tue Jul 21 14:27:43 2015 UTC,The only issue I've had with the subox kit is switching the Kbox mini off. The button can sometimes take 10-15 presses before it actually switches off.  Besides that it is a good kit for the price and the rba is pretty good for its size.
electronic_cigarette,3e2guc,SuperDave31190,3,Tue Jul 21 17:21:36 2015 UTC,I've had better luck with this if I wait until to the screen is off to lock/unlock it. Haven't had a problem since I made that connection

electronic_cigarette,3e2guc,lightmanmac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:57:39 2015 UTC,"Been using the subtank mini and its awesome! I have only ever used the .5 coil heads in it and they are awesome. Last me about 2 or 3 weeks before i start to notice a change in flavor, even then its still a good vape. The rba base is fun to use as well! I have the ""old"" version of it but it still wicks and hits well. Also, have only been using samsung 25r's in my regulated devices and they are great! Good battery life and really consistent performance."
electronic_cigarette,3e2guc,lightmanmac,2,Tue Jul 21 14:19:46 2015 UTC,Perfect. Thanks!
electronic_cigarette,3e2guc,GameBreak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:52 2015 UTC,The onboard charging works amazingly.   My battery reader is a little finicky in the display but other than that the device is amazing. The display will say I have no battery immediately after taking a hit and may not let me chain vape because of it.
electronic_cigarette,3e2guc,TechnologyFetish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:10 2015 UTC,"That's kind of annoying. I'm used to problems with the istick 20 connector, so was hoping everything just worked correctly on this one haha."

electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,kuse,15,Mon Jul 20 19:51:03 2015 UTC,"LOL. We had so many discussions about the twirl. This was one of the few scenes where I told them how to act, and I told her to act overly flirty. In the end I insisted it stay in because it's quirky and fun. It got your attention, didn't it? Hopefully so because in the end we all have a good laugh at it."

electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,ThePandaPoacher,11,Mon Jul 20 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"Also, the twirl distracts from the fact someone's underpants are hanging out to the right in that shot."

electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,particle409,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:36 2015 UTC,I cannot unsee that anymore and it will be the only thing I see at the end of the commercial from now on.
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,Cheech5,5,Tue Jul 21 03:15:25 2015 UTC,"Didn't get my attention as a vape thing, felt like it was starting to turn in a singles hang out. Was waiting for someone to mention the hottest singles in town."
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,Cheech5,3,Mon Jul 20 21:01:17 2015 UTC,"I agree. It seemed like the commercial couldn't decide which direction to go in with that part included. I like the idea of a vape shop that's mass market friendly. Uniforms, well-lit, clean, etc. The stores with the guys dressed in heavy metal t-shirts and are ok I guess, but the real market is with the average person who isn't in to that.  The girl being flirty would work well in a commercial that was all about a sexy new vaping store, but the tone of the commercial doesn't fit that."
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,BleuXShadoW,32,Tue Jul 21 01:41:33 2015 UTC,"Awesome commercial!  Just a side observation, and maybe I'm just getting old, but I love the fact that you guys have a uniform. I hate going in to vape shops where you can't tell who works there because they are all dressed in regular clothes, customers are behind the counter building and sales people are sitting in the lounge. I'm all for freedom of expression and the loose nature of vape shops, but this setup just looked professional and clean."
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,wheresandrew,51,Mon Jul 20 19:49:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you. That was my doing for the reasons you cited. We had the ""Jeans uprising of 2014"" where everyone suddenly wanted to wear jeans. It was squashed under my Khaki fist."
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,bazookafox,25,Mon Jul 20 19:54:01 2015 UTC,"Especially when you consider impending legislation! I mean, your shop looks like the BEST CASE scenario of where I'd want a local politician to come in looking to learn more prior to a legislative decision. While I'm all for freedom of expression and languish my own bizcaz outfits, there are some venues that having a great first impression make a huge difference in the long run."
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,bazookafox,16,Mon Jul 20 19:58:52 2015 UTC,"That's a tall statement and great compliment, thank you."
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,5tephenk,8,Mon Jul 20 20:00:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed, your stores are very professional and clean. I've always thought you've set the correct standard for how a vape shop should look and be ran. Keep up the awesome work! Commercial looks good! Can't wait to see it on tv! The only problem is I don't watch too much actual tv nowadays. I'm sure I'll see it soon enough though :)"
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,bazookafox,8,Mon Jul 20 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, still hoping to get together soon. I haven't seen it myself. It airs on sub-tier channels. I AM excited to see it during Sharknado 3."

electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,5tephenk,2,Tue Jul 21 01:42:33 2015 UTC,Is this a legitimate comment? That's the uniform. Many places have a dress code my friend. We're a great place to work with excellent compensation packages. I think it's a fair trade off to ask people to dress somewhat professionally for work.
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,SE555,9,Tue Jul 21 08:22:03 2015 UTC,"It can go too far though. My local B&M wears these douchey vests, I have a hard time taking them seriously.   Thank god I found another place to go."

electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,Winter_knights,5,Mon Jul 20 23:56:23 2015 UTC,"lol, you guessed it."
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,Raleighirishman,2,Tue Jul 21 00:02:14 2015 UTC,"I stopped going to Avail because most of their flavors taste muted to me and they only have their own brand at the same prices that I can get some of the more ""premium"" brands at the SS Vape across the street."
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,PorkRollAndEggs,2,Tue Jul 21 01:04:41 2015 UTC,"I still stop in to get Dirty Banana by them, but that's it.   Their hardware is overpriced (even for B&M) and most of their liquids are okay at best."
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,ishouldthrowaway,2,Tue Jul 21 01:37:36 2015 UTC,Exactly. The only flavor I ever really enjoyed from them was a blueberry cupcake one that they discontinued.
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,PorkRollAndEggs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:46:08 2015 UTC,"I don't get how Avail is expanding so quickly. They're opening 20 stores in Charlotte this year and 100 total in 2015. They sell only Avail brand and from what I hear, a small selection of hardware. To feed such feverish expansion requires huge capital. I guess they sold someone on the idea and get bookoo bucks, same thing Kure is doing."
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,FORKinmyDICK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"I think that's what it is. The store here is just isticks, subox minis, and rebranded emow kits. They have the Atlantis tank, and RDA wise they have about ten different ones, however they're all clones."
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,JoytechThrowaway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:42 2015 UTC,"Some of the funding comes from James Xu/Evergreen Enterprises. They're also offering franchises.  The customer base they're targeting is clearly new vapers/current smokers. The store I've seen (the new one near the WalMart in the University area) offers a limited selection of hardware, but it's the right type for new vapers: Kanger Subox, MVP's, etc. These items were decently priced for a B&M, with maybe a 10-20% premium over avg online prices. They did have a few RDAs as well; the only one I remember is the Freakshow, less competitively priced at $40+. For hardware items with a high volume of sales such as the Subox, Avail's size gives it an advantage (lower wholesale prices). The company's affiliation with Evergreen is probably helpful as well for direct importation of goods.  The only juice they offer is their own, of course, which is priced on par with ""premium"" juices and seems relatively flavorless.  What really struck me was the retail space, which is large, in a great location, and well designed/executed. Definitely capital-intensive. The space is dominated by a series of tasting bars; the real money in this business has to come from juice sales. There's also a lounge area toward the back of the store. To bring in traffic, they're planning to host various events there."
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,Dinks219,9,Tue Jul 21 12:58:27 2015 UTC,I am younger and I agree. I think nametags should be the bare minimum
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,Myspacecutie69,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:15 2015 UTC,Yeah just let your staff wear name tags or those VIP necklace lanyyard things for concerts. That's all you need to distinguish from customers
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,themadmasher,14,Mon Jul 20 19:52:04 2015 UTC,"For those interested, Time Warner Media claimed we were one of the first ""True"" Vape shops they've allowed to advertise on TV. This is their claim and I don't know how valid it really was. Lots of rules surrounding what we could and could not say, show and do. Very unique experience and the crew had a blast shooting it!"
electronic_cigarette,3dzen9,Myspacecutie69,4,Tue Jul 21 07:51:56 2015 UTC,I can tell you after being in 2 news adverts for the Raleigh area in a shop they promoted that seems like a weird thing for them to tell you.

Gives all of us a better image in my opinion.    There are some pretty sketchy vape shops around here, and I have a feeling they discourage quite a few people from dropping in and learning something.  I just can't see everyone being comfortable walking into a dark, vapor filled shop blasting obscene music staffed with what look like meth heads.  The idea is to appeal to everyone that wants to quit, and there are a TON of people that don't fit into the young slightly dirtbag image a few of the shops I've seen seem desperate to cultivate as their image."

electronic_cigarette,3e21vc,ScootiepuffJUNIOR,2,Tue Jul 21 12:01:56 2015 UTC,"Grab a microfiber cloth, it'll clean it up better than say paper towels"
electronic_cigarette,3e21vc,RohypnolPickupArtist,2,Tue Jul 21 13:11:29 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way on my VT, It's not your snow wolf thats the problem, it's temp control. I can't get that nice dense warm satisfying vape on ni200 with tanks or drippers. I've tried everything I can and now i'm back to my trusty kanthal/mech setup. I enjoy it so much more."
electronic_cigarette,3e21vc,TOO_FUTURE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:08:49 2015 UTC,It's definitely not temp control.  I have the Starre Pro but I mostly use my Beast Silo and with Atlantis coils I get fatter and tastier clouds than my kanthal OCCs. 480F/60W.

In an email chain with Michael at Asmodus, he practically confirmed the chip is faulty and asked me to send it back to them for them to send out a new one, with no guarantee that it'll work.  It's a shit chip."

electronic_cigarette,3e3b59,kurrptsenate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"Sure did, that's the first thing I tried. It was tight as could be, wouldn't budge any further (side note, it was up high enough that it wouldn't even read on my kbox mini without an adapter)"
electronic_cigarette,3e3b59,kurrptsenate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:41 2015 UTC,"ah that was you with the adapter the other day! thats rough. other thought would be to maybe take out the 510 pin, make sure everything looks good on the inside?  otherwise i would agree that its probably a poorly machined insulator."

electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,HeyItsHaley123,2,Tue Jul 21 14:20:37 2015 UTC,Those vertical coils are doody compared to the original ones IMO.
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,newnewdrugsaccount,3,Tue Jul 21 14:21:36 2015 UTC,I have to respectfully disagree. The vertical OCC one that came with the kit blew my replacements (non-vertical) out of the water. I suppose it could come down to the PG/VG ratio we use though.
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,kingkader,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:44 2015 UTC,Your wattage is probably too high. Are you priming your coils?
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,kingkader,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:52 2015 UTC,Yes. Who doesn't prime their coils? Like I said it was fine in the beginning.   I was using it at 18-20w.
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,Vinnymac_vapes,2,Tue Jul 21 14:23:14 2015 UTC,Like 80% of people who run into this problem.
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,eeezo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:06 2015 UTC,Isn't that why there's a warning in the box? I guess some people don't read.
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,selfproclaimed1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:59 2015 UTC,Did you drop the wattage with the higher ohm coils. Also if it's like my arctic if the coil isn't tight in the base I'll get a burnt taste.
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,selfproclaimed1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was using it at 18-20w."
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,CaptainKelly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:18 2015 UTC,20w is far too high for that coil. 15 would even be pushing it.
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,WillHo01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:44 2015 UTC,20w is on the high end for that coil. What ratio is your juice?
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,selfproclaimed1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:40 2015 UTC,50/50
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,PhriendlyPhocus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:26 2015 UTC,Id back it down to like 12w and give it a try.  Also you will not get the vapor production like the .5 or the nicotine delivery. If you're using the same juice for the 1.5 as the .5 it will be a completely different experience.
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,AJ_ninja,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:37 2015 UTC,Why should I have to use it at 12 when it says it will go up to 26?
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,BradRadcock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:04 2015 UTC,50/50 juice is recommended max 18 watts but I have the same issue with mine at 13 watts. The verticals are just junk compared to the originals. I went thru three 5 packs and never got more than 2 tanks out of a single coil before getting the death hit.
electronic_cigarette,3e2o7h,Papasmirf01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have a feeling they are junk. But I will try to use it at lower watts so that it doesn't go to waste. I probably won't buy another one though. I am still figuring out what I like and I think I can safely say I prefer sub-ohm."

electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,tbarley1,3,Tue Jul 21 01:14:00 2015 UTC,"Gorgeous mod, makes my reo grand jealous for sure.  What I can't understand though, is why most everyone building a VW squonker these days goes with a DNA40. I would pay top dollar for something like the innards of a sig 150w in squonker form. Why isn't this being done yet?"
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,DJApoc,4,Mon Jul 20 23:14:43 2015 UTC,"There seems to be two camps for squonking that I've seen; unregulated/high wattage building using 22mm BF modified atomizers and the more classic 14.5mm dedicated BF flavor atomizer builds. DNA 40 fits perfectly into the latter; (comparatively) smaller more compact chip to work with, runs well with single 18650, and temp control for a consistent vape. Personally I'd much prefer DNA40 over 75W+ on a regulated device."
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,beardedbigfoot,3,Mon Jul 20 23:48:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ever since I upgraded to the low profile reo, I've been using 22mm atomizers. I always prefer more power and airflow, but that's my preference. That's the great thing about vaping, there's something for everyone, right?  I can dream. Surely someone will make a 100w+ squonker soon... and hopefully not want $400+ for it like I see for custom dna40 squonkers on facebook groups."
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,similar_observation,2,Tue Jul 21 00:25:47 2015 UTC,I believe it has something to do with the fact that most squonkers  only support 1 18650 battery. Having that kind of extra wattage would only come with shitty battery life.
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,beardedbigfoot,2,Mon Jul 20 23:32:42 2015 UTC,"I'd be perfectly fine with it being on the large side to accommodate an extra battery. Just like with cell phones... stop making them smaller, just give us more battery!"
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,similar_observation,3,Mon Jul 20 23:44:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, so how exactly does a squonker work? I understand its bottom fed from a juice bottle, but is there a specific atomizer needed up top?"
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,K3R3G3,2,Tue Jul 21 00:48:47 2015 UTC,yes you would need a bottom feed atomizer or a conversion kit for a non bf one.
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,serosis,2,Tue Jul 21 00:58:05 2015 UTC,"The atomizer has a hole in the positive post running to the deck. When the bottle is squeezed, the juice runs up the pipe, through the 510, up the positive post, and into the deck where it soaks the wick.   There's conversion kits, but sometimes it's easy to modify as long as you have access to the tools (like a drill press)"
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,GobbleThisObelisk,2,Tue Jul 21 03:07:22 2015 UTC,"That's how I figured it all worked, thank you for the explanation!"
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,serosis,2,Tue Jul 21 03:46:07 2015 UTC,"I've been messing with the idea of making my own. So far I've converted a Tobh easily with a RDA BF Positive Contact Screw from fatdaddy vapes. It's nice because it comes with 3 screws. I'm going to try my derringer tommorow.  The conversion kit looks useful if you need the o-rings, but all the extra bits aren't necessary. If you can figure out modifying your own center post, you don't have to drop a separate $6 on the kit. Just buy the screws and squonker essentials kit."
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,AllKidsChooseGIF,3,Tue Jul 21 03:54:59 2015 UTC,"So, the buyer not only didn't want it to break when they dropped it...they wanted to break the concrete it will land on."
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,slickerxcuh,5,Tue Jul 21 17:02:17 2015 UTC,Is that a drain tube from the 510?  Do you just attach a plastic bottle to the end and basically save up your leakage?  This is like the mod equivalent of rolling a joint with a bag of shake that you cleaned off of a table.
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,serosis,6,Tue Jul 21 01:48:17 2015 UTC,"Nope. It is a 'bottom-fed' setup, colloquially known as a 'squonker.'  Basically upside down dripping through the 510 connection of the atomizer using a plastic squeeze bottle and tube.  PBusardo's Reo review goes into detail, relevant (and concise) time codes below.  Quick description @ 9m 24s  Up close demonstration @ 12m 35s"
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,Brown_eyed_pea,2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:51 2015 UTC,No shit?  So like a reverse tank feeding into a RDA. Neat.
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,EvilPlots,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:44:44 2015 UTC,Kinda. It isn't automatic; you have to squeeze the bottle to juice up your wicks. That's what the porthole in the case is for.  It still saves you from carrying excess juice around and the time it normally takes to drip. It's pretty cool.
electronic_cigarette,3dzqhb,digger585,3,Tue Jul 21 10:24:44 2015 UTC,"""This is like the mod equivalent of rolling a joint with a bag of shake that you cleaned off of a table.""  I LOL'd thanks for that"

If you're not into custard/creamy juices I have around a dozen other recipes that you may choose from.   PM me if you'd like to do a trade. I only have 30ml bottles, but I'll gladly exchange for a smaller quantity if that's what you have."

These new flavors all have a ""creamy custard"" base flavor profile.   Anyways, I would love to do an exchange! I only have 10 and 30 ML bottles. I'm more than happy to exchange a 30ml for something smaller as I feel 10ml's is merely a tease. Especially for the folks dripping like myself."

electronic_cigarette,3e2ebb,the-chickenman,2,Tue Jul 21 12:52:41 2015 UTC,I've had fantastic performance out of my 25R's.  There have also been a ton of great reviews for Illumn and the batteries are $5 apiece. I'd say get two so you have some to rotate.  Linky
electronic_cigarette,3e2ebb,Cheech5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:03:11 2015 UTC,"i think lightning vapes might sell batteries on their page and they have a perma -40% off coupon code (google it). Illumn is good too but no discount code i'm aware of so they will cost more. For batteries I always went with samsung 25r, or LG HE2 / HE4... but for a mech if you go very low sub ohm then might want to look into sony vtc4/5"
electronic_cigarette,3e2ebb,Losty_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:03:06 2015 UTC,As previously mentioned illumn is a good vendor. I use Samsung 25 r's as do many other people. If you get then from illumn and you order them in pairs of 2 they will give you a battery case which is something you should have.
electronic_cigarette,3e2ebb,jaykaizen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:26 2015 UTC,Along with the samsung 25's sigeli has started producing a 30 amp battery with 2500 mah. I have one and it kicks anus.

electronic_cigarette,3e2ebb,non-polarbear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:05 2015 UTC,"Hate to break this to ya, but you've been had. To date there has only been one company make 30 amp batteries, Sony. Those ""sigeli"" batteries your B&M sold you are most likely rewraps same as EFEST and other ""30amp"" or higher battery."
electronic_cigarette,3e2ebb,zombiemann,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:13 2015 UTC,I ended up grabbing a pair of the new LG HG2 to test out.  Been real happy with them for the past month or so.

electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,mmjpatient0912,6,Mon Jul 20 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"It would be cool, it would be even cooler if it had a name that actually said wtf it was, so that beginners could find it a little easier. But it is just that, a beginners guide to how to wrap a couple basic coils.   What the OP is suggesting sounds more like a comprehensive visual guide to advanced coil building..."

electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,surffishman,17,Mon Jul 20 18:15:29 2015 UTC,I have tried every coil type there is over the years and i have seen no noticeable difference at all between them as far as vape quality.  If a coil is wrapped correctly and wicked correctly they all (from my experience) vape equally well .
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,Crayonception,17,Mon Jul 20 19:15:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt downvote him for having a different opinion. I personally feel like different builds produce different results, though."
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,surffishman,20,Mon Jul 20 19:39:52 2015 UTC,"Trust me i don't care in the least if i get downvoted , i don't even pay attention to it .  What i do care about is telling the truth and that (from my experience) and being involved in many of these coil type discussions is what i believe .  If i cared about downvotes and upvotes i would of just agreed with the OP but since i don't,   i tell what i have noticed from my experience ."
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,Deriksson,3,Mon Jul 20 19:52:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with the most part, except with parallel vs non-parallel coils. A 5 wrap 28g parallel build vapes much differently than a 5 wrap 28g non-parallel build of equal resistance."
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,digiplay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:31:06 2015 UTC,How would yo even get the same resistance if they are both wrapped 5 wraps and one is parallel?

electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,m4xwellmurd3r,3,Tue Jul 21 05:23:17 2015 UTC,There are two coils types I've found that have a major improvement over standard coils. Parallel and Clapton. Parallels are super easy to build and I like the heat output so I use them most
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,tehspamninja,9,Mon Jul 20 23:15:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but this just doesn't seem right. There are advantages and disadvantages to different builds for sure."
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,surffishman,3,Mon Jul 20 19:28:17 2015 UTC,A basic single coil or double coil at the same ohm as the fanciest coils performs equally well is what i'm saying .  Check out the threads on VU about it and most agree that coil types make very little if any difference on vape quality when compared to the most simple basic coils.
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,NecarisOmnis,11,Mon Jul 20 19:40:47 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree.   Some coils ar giving a better flavor but it is not like a regular coil gives 50/100 and a twisted coil is 100/100.  If you ar able to make a nice single whatever ohm coil vs a super upsidedown twisted alien double dragon marley fused spogebob zipper drwatson fisted and flatend pyramid clapton stagared roxette coil you get maybe 5 points more for flavor but -10 points for ramp up time and spiting lava juice syndrom in your mouth.  Other coils might have a better ramp up time, but whenever you take a vape you send signals into space and aliens will come when you sleep and anal probe you. For some, this is a downside, others love it.  So there is a difference, but most of the time i dont think the downside is worth the extra flavor or vapor."
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,surffishman,3,Mon Jul 20 20:20:26 2015 UTC,Anal probe you?  I am definitely sticking to simple coils.
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,kione83,2,Mon Jul 20 21:03:18 2015 UTC,There is a doctor Watson coil?
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,Mykracosm,2,Mon Jul 20 23:10:04 2015 UTC,"The downside is rarely worth it. I like playing with other builds just to kill time wrapping ridiculous shit, but at the end of the day I end up going back to just standard dual coil nickel builds for that temp control.  Fused claptons have garbage ramp up time unless you slam crazy wattage through them. Staged heating helps, and I get them big ol clouds and crazy flavor, but with anything involving a fused clapton  and adequate heating my wick is dry in two or three hits instead of ten or fifteen I can get with my standard temp control builds.  Fun to do every now and then, but definitely not worth the cost."
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,anxdiety,4,Tue Jul 21 01:57:06 2015 UTC,This is not entirely true. A dual 0.3 ohm coil with 2 wrap of 30g wire is going to vape entirely differently than a dual 0.3 ohm coil with 5 wraps with 26g wire around the same 2.5mm mandrel.
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,surffishman,2,Mon Jul 20 20:01:39 2015 UTC,"Opinions vary ,  i respect that you have yours and i have mine .  I fully expect others may have a different opinion ."
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,lumberjawsh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:11:49 2015 UTC,I think he's more referring to something like a triple twisted fused clapton parallel majigger coil at .3 versus basic 6 wrap 24g at .3. Obviously different gauges of wire behave differently at similar ohm loads.
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,anxdiety,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"There most certainly is diminishing returns with complex coils. Finding the ideal vape is most certainly a balancing act between wire, wicking and device."
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,mxjf,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:43 2015 UTC,"To a degree, but then you get into things like the Clapton coil where the build actually provides more surface area for atomization to take place, a Clapton sort of looks like those bubble wands with ridges all along the hoop, adding surface area"
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,WhatTheFuckinFUCK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:53:01 2015 UTC,Some coils do have superior wicking properties versus a normal coil. A fused clapton can suck up 5 drops of liquid without any cotton.
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,surffishman,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:37 2015 UTC,I respect your opinion but like i said i just don't see enough of a difference to bother with making the fancy stuff .
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,WhatTheFuckinFUCK,2,Mon Jul 20 20:08:08 2015 UTC,Yeah it's not a huge difference. If you enjoy making coils then it's worth it but other than that it's not worth it to me either. I've just been sticking to parallel coils lately.
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,surffishman,3,Mon Jul 20 20:46:49 2015 UTC,If it was a very noticeable difference i would be using them but i just don't get that .
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,notbad112,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:55 2015 UTC,You are about right. i dont know why ppl downvote you but its all about the ohms. coil types dont really make a big difference.
electronic_cigarette,3dyynn,Awesummzzz,3,Mon Jul 20 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"To a certain degree it does make a difference. Take a fused clapton for example, the space in between the two core wires allows juice to wick directly into the coil, rather than just the cotton. Some say that improves flavor while others, like yourself, find there is no difference.  I have yet to make a fused clapton so I can't comment on the flavor personally"

electronic_cigarette,3e1i73,Dtkay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:26:32 2015 UTC,I didn't mention anything about breaking rules.

You can have it shipped to me and I'll re-ship it to you - and at my own expense, when I'm able. I am known and have a good reputation around here. Your juice is safe with me, and if you'd like, I'd be happy to throw in a 30ml or 2 of my increasingly good Unicorn Milk and other clones, before I re-ship to you, just so I can get some commentary/feedback.  This move by your state is bullshit and I'll help if I can. I'm offering the same option to Indiana vapers who face a similar situation.  Edit: I'm on the OH/WV border so keep shipping times in mind, but I'll gladly re-ship anywhere I can legally do so."

This isn't asking for anything, just frustrated. My timing is epic. I will have to look into how this pertains to DIY supplies (mainly nicotine). Good friend has been encouraging me to go that route. Now I think I have to do so. Thanks much for the offer. May ask to reship once I figure out what this all really means. Much appreciated."
electronic_cigarette,3e08vn,serfingusa,2,Tue Jul 21 03:32:24 2015 UTC,"You really should go DIY my friend. Juice vendors run a legit business, but keep in mind you're paying for them to mix, pack, and ship - you're not really paying for the ingredients, which are incredibly cheap in volume. Put it this way: for $50 upfront on flavorings and $15 on Walmart VG, I've made over a gallon of juice that would have cost several hundred dollars from even a cheap mass mixer like Vape Wild. A big bottle of nic and some 4oz bottles of Capellas flavorings, and you can vape your brains out for months and only need to hit up the drug store for a bottle of VG here and there.  Let me know if you need any help. I'm pretty new to DIY but will offer any suggestions I can. And if you decide on reshipping, I'm always here, and my post office is 2 blocks away."

I have heard that is the secret recipe to all the milk recipes. Just haven't had time to tiinker with it yet.  I have heard you need to use vanilla custard v1 in order to come close though."
electronic_cigarette,3e08vn,massive_cock,5,Tue Jul 21 02:39:36 2015 UTC,"Bingo. It's my starting point for any creamy/milky concoction. Now I'm just fiddling with the balance, and tinkering with marshmallow, custard (unflavored, just custard, it makes a huuuuge difference even in small amounts) and touches of lychee and others, to round it out. I can tell a huge difference between vanilla custard v1 and v2 - v2 lacks the cream."
electronic_cigarette,3e08vn,dataton,3,Tue Jul 21 02:43:49 2015 UTC,Yes sir :) Do you have a website or are you strictly DIY and help others in need?
electronic_cigarette,3e08vn,massive_cock,4,Tue Jul 21 02:47:46 2015 UTC,"Just DIY so far, but have had some amazingly good results that my friends harass me to make for them constantly now. Once I have confidence and consistency in a few of these recipes, I might consider making something of it. But for now, I'm just making juice for myself and a handful of people who can't really afford a lot of (good) juice.  Nice to meet you too, Mr./Mrs./Ms. Deluxeejuice!"
electronic_cigarette,3e08vn,surffishman,2,Tue Jul 21 03:00:54 2015 UTC,"That's how I started too. Started DIY , got a lot of my friends to switch over as well. Then I would start giving my friends and relatives free juice. It got out of hand though, so I charged them what it cost me to make it. My favorite flavors I nailed down are Keylime Pie and Sugar Cookie. Wish more people would try those flavors of mine. My best sellers are Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy, Glazed Doughnut and Blueberry Blast.  Thanks again for trying to help the community out!"
electronic_cigarette,3e08vn,A_Medical_Physicist,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:20 2015 UTC,Key lime pie and sugar cookies are two of my favorites. Do you have a site online where I can order?

electronic_cigarette,3e08vn,massive_cock,2,Tue Jul 21 03:44:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'm already realizing I'm going to have to ask people to chip in a bit, if I am to produce the volume all of us need. I've placed myself on the hook as sole supplier for 8 people at this point, and a lot more will come when my (college) students return in 6 weeks. Plastic is the most expensive part!  I had a good keylime pie from ... somewhere... months ago, but I find I have trouble with strong flavors now that I drip at 100w all day. I could crank down my box and enjoy the flavors more, but it just doesn't satisfy somehow. Sugar Cookie and Glazed Doughnut are very interesting options though!"
electronic_cigarette,3e08vn,westuh,2,Tue Jul 21 03:43:09 2015 UTC,"To be honest , I have never dripped yet. I started, like most, on an ego pen. I now use the kanger subox with the .5 occ coil at 30 watts (4.2 volts) and the flavor is just overwhelming. It would be a lot easier to try out new recipes with a dripper though. To be honest, I think the glazed doughnut is just alright, but people just go crazy for that flavor. Maybe it's just me. Another flavor that is spot on is Crunch Berries flavoring from the flavors apprentice. I forget what they call it there, but I use crunch berries. It taste exactly like a big ol' bowl of just the berries with a splash of milk. One of the few recipes I didn't have to mess around with. What are some of your favs?   And yes, unless you buy in major bulk, I actually find the flavorings to be more expensive. Followed by bottles and 100mg nicotine."

I may be misunderstanding that act, but I haven't heard squat about new anti-vape bills in Arkansas.  Edit: Holy shit, it does."
electronic_cigarette,3e08vn,SvartHrafn,6,Mon Jul 20 23:34:03 2015 UTC,"Any state law which affects interstate commerce must be:  (1) rationally related to a legitimate state concern and  (2) the burden on interstate commerce must be outweighed by the benefit to the state’s interests.  In determining whether the burden is outweighed by the benefits, a court must examine whether the state objective could be achieved by a means less restrictive on interstate commerce . Furthermore, it is important to note that promoting the economic interest of its own citizens at the expense of out-of-state citizens is not a legitimate state objective."
electronic_cigarette,3e08vn,cellphoneaccount,3,Tue Jul 21 00:17:43 2015 UTC,"I had taken this away mostly:   The “Dormant” Commerce Clause ultimately means that because Congress has been given power over interstate commerce, states cannot discriminate against interstate commerce nor can they unduly burden interstate commerce, even in the absence of federal legislation regulating the activity.   From the section you quoted I would think they may be able to put a license on it like how Indiana did, but I would see them having a hard time stating how the burden of this interstate commerce could be outweighed by any state benefit (They couldn't say, ""Cuz we're losing tobacco money!"" publicly) and there has been no concrete analysis on the dangers of e-cigarette use for them to file it as a legitimate state concern to a fair judge. IANAL but I think they may have a collective shot."

It's funny because you ask anyone that doesn't vape about any of these ""flavors being advertised to kids"" and none of them have ever heard of any of them because this industry doesn't advertise period.  Much less to kids.  If you find anything vape related you have to specifically search for it and based on the posts we see here on the forums every day, even once you find vape stuff it still isn't that easy to get started.  The things teens are using are gas station e-cigs that have nothing to do with vaping and aren't sold in any vape store.  That's the really sad part about the entire battle against this industry."

Also ... here's the Goliath v2 for anyone looking at this post that wants reference: http://vapenw.com/goliath-v2-by-ud ... Very sexy design. Worth twice the price? What are the major improvements?  Also, discussion on the V2: https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/goliath-by-youde.658029/#post15473914  It is single and dual coil compatible: ""Ever wanted to build a single coil in your Goliath RBA but the deck didn't allow you to? Well thats a thing of the past with the Goliath V2. Able to switch the build deck to a different one that is compatible with single coils, no longer is the builder limited to a dual coil. The Goliath V2 is also capable of using different decks that contain a dual nickel coil build for temperature control or a simple dual coil both build within a ceramic base. Along with the option to switch to a single coil deck or pre-build decks made of ceramic, UD also brought back the Goliath's famous liquid control."""
electronic_cigarette,3e28nu,TankBlaster24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:06:08 2015 UTC,"The v1 is geared toward dual coils, but with a little creativity, you can stick a single in it, you just need to get it between the posts. The v2 will be shipping with a plug, as the deck comes out, and gives you the option to use stock coils. The plug will cut the chamber on half and block off one of the airholes, and 2 of the juice channels.  Example of creativity, not mine, but impressive.  http://m.imgur.com/a/2MuqC  Edit: I liked the goliath so much I picked up another. I'm super stoked for the v2. Once I find a place that has it in stock, right in the cart it goes. But not FT, I cant wait that long."

electronic_cigarette,3e28nu,MFMFMFMFMF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:04:14 2015 UTC,"I second that recommendation. All RTAs will leak if not wicked properly. That being said, the Goliath is pretty easy to wick properly as there are channels where you are to place the wick on the sides of the deck. Fill them and don't have any cotton in the juice channels, and that tank will never leak, unless you put it on its side. The only 2 drawbacks are: size, it's a big assed tank, without a lot of juice capacity, and at least with the V1, there isn't a single coil option, (unless you get creative, as stated above)."

I've used mine about 90% of the time I vape since I got it when it first came out. Favorite build is 28 gauge twisted tight and then 8 wraps on a 2mm screwdriver at 60 watts or 7 wraps for a mech. Also, wicking is by far the easiest of any RTA I've used aside from the kayfun v4 which is just a different beast all together.   Enjoy :)"

electronic_cigarette,3dz3lz,catdumpling,54,Tue Jul 21 02:18:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a lifelong cat lover, but I'd like to point out that PG toxicity in cats relates to ingestion, not necessarily inhalation. I did a lot of reading up on it when I first started vaping, and couldn't find a single bit of data showing that 2nd-hand inhalation posed a problem for cats. That's not to say it absolutely doesn't, just that there's no data suggesting that it does. Anecdotally, I would assume we would've heard stories by now of it causing problems, but several years on and I don't think there's been a single issue reported (as far as inhalation goes, anyway.)"
electronic_cigarette,3dz3lz,pencilbagger,7,Mon Jul 20 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"I think the issue comes more from the pg settling on their fur, and as we all know cats groom their fur quite often. not saying it's enough to cause serious problems or death (its pretty likely it isnt), but cats in proximity to someone vaping more than likely will ingest at least some pg."

electronic_cigarette,3dz3lz,catdumpling,-4,Tue Jul 21 04:03:11 2015 UTC,"Inhaling pg is gonna produce the same effect as ingestion. In fact, ingestion would be safer since it goes through first pass metabolism. Inhalation goes straight to the blood. Really the only difference would be the amount entering the bloodstream, as airborne, second-hand pg would introduce a lesser amount of pg to the blood than straight eating it."
electronic_cigarette,3dz3lz,oxide1337,0,Tue Jul 21 00:48:20 2015 UTC,"In fact, ingestion would be safer since it goes through first pass metabolism. Inhalation goes straight to the blood.    No, and as far as I understand it, this is most likely why it's actually not as potentially dangerous as ingesting it: it's not being processed by the liver and kidneys. Combine this with the fact that it's further diluted when it becomes airbone, and it doesn't appear to be a risk as far as any information I can find.  Inhalation and ingestion do not necessarily produce the same effects, and the route a particular substance takes to get into the body can affect how the body handles that particular chemical."
electronic_cigarette,3dz3lz,catdumpling,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:19:14 2015 UTC,"Actually if ingested or inhaled it's still being processed by the liver. Ur intestines actually transmit nutrients from what you've eaten to the bloodstream. From your blood it eventually makes it to the liver. Usually the only difference is enzymes in your gut can alter chemicals before they get to ur blood (first pass metabolism). Best case scenario is ingestion between the two in terms of how the body handles pg. Also, like I said in my previous post, best case scenario in how much is ingested is inhalation."

Probably about 4 or 5 months after I started vaping, My girlfriends cat got sick. By this point I was playong with RDAs and subohming and all that fun. I recalled looking into animals and interactions with different constituents of e-liquid, and saw that PG wasnt good for cats. I looked further into it and read up on Heinz Bodies, and as soon as that stuck out, I told my gf to have the vet do a cbp (Complete Blood Panel), with focus on heinz bodies and other enviromental possibilities. Results took about a week, and when they came back, I was estatic. Turns out his sickness was a urinary infection, AND the growth of heinz bodies was within the normal range. Now this isn't to prove one way or the other, and you wont find me doing experiments, but it seems to me that the real concern for HBA in cats is more so with the ingestion, and not as likely/prolific in exposure to a PG aerosol emitted from an APV device  These are just my $.02 on the matter, and everyone vapes/handles thier pets differently. What works for you may not for me, and vice-versa.  Edit: clarification"

electronic_cigarette,3dz3lz,DrScottyB,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:03 2015 UTC,"""Max VG"" is a meaningless statement. It just means they put in the maximum amount of VG that they felt like using.

electronic_cigarette,3dz3lz,Galactic_Danger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:24:47 2015 UTC,It's not meaningless. It means they don't add any straight PG to the mix. Anybody who uses the term to describe a juice that is cut with PG that is not in the flavoring or nic base is using it incorrectly.
electronic_cigarette,3dz3lz,Mykracosm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:37:02 2015 UTC,"It means they don't add any straight PG to the mix.    As someone who DIY's, I fully understand that. But considering there's absolutely no set flavoring ratio, I still think ""Max VG"" is meaningless because it's so vague. ""Max VG"" could mean 10/90 pg/vg, 30/70, or anything in between, based on whatever flavoring ratio that recipe happens to use. It also doesn't tell you a single thing about whether or not the recipe uses distilled water in place of PG, or whether that juice maker is using non-PG-based flavorings (expensive and somewhat limited, but they do exist.)  I still argue that ""Max VG"" doesn't tell you anything useful and is mostly a marketing thing."
electronic_cigarette,3dz3lz,Derkek,4,Tue Jul 21 07:06:13 2015 UTC,"It's very easy to obtain nicotine suspended in VG as opposed to PG. what's not as easy is obtaining flavorings suspended in anything other than PG. they're out there, but it's definitely not as common as PG suspension."

If I remember correctly people were saying it was taking months for their product to come.
electronic_cigarette,3e1tfr,overachiever,2,Tue Jul 21 10:25:17 2015 UTC,I placed the pre-order on 28th May (the first day it was listed iirc) and received an email yesterday saying they can't fulfil the order due to demand.  They kindly offered to refund me using their GB wallet and I respectfully told them where they can shove that offer and demanded a refund to my PayPal account.  Still waiting on the refund but it's safe to say this will be my last dealing with this joke of a company.

Also both these devices are very different can't really compare them. If you have to choose though get the opus 200, it offers so much more with the DNA 200 chip."
electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,MrNobody24,-2,Tue Jul 21 08:13:24 2015 UTC,What makes you say they're so different. At their core they're both reliable temp boxes right?   I guess thats one of my main questions. Aside from the dna200 having some computer capabilities (don't know what exactly) and more power. What makes sets either one apart?  No o didn't fine it in stock. Kind of a pisser because i could've ordered one three days ago when they were in stock.
electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,lostohms,2,Tue Jul 21 08:47:56 2015 UTC,"As much as I like my SX Mini M, I would have to say Opus 200. Not so much for the power, but for it's versatility and the option of being able to use variety of wire types for temp control. But, if you want to be able to swap batteries whenever you want, the SX Mini M would be the way to go."
electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,abra5umente,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:09 2015 UTC,"FYI Yihi just released a test update to allow for Ti wire. I've just installed it and it works better - seems as though I get better battery life, too.  It also ups the max wattage in power mode to 75w and the max joules in temp mode to 75j when using titanium. People have reported that it works just fine and I have had no issues with using it with Ni200."
electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,lostohms,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've been using the update since it was released. I'm loving being able to use Ti wire. Now I'm curious about stainless wire...."

electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,lostohms,2,Tue Jul 21 14:56:47 2015 UTC,"It would, but I think it would make up for it in longevity. I find myself re-wicking way more often than building a new coil, and Ti is still is a bit on the soft side."
electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,abra5umente,2,Tue Jul 21 15:00:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I rewick once a week or so, just did it then actually. Not with Nickel though, this was with Kanthal.  I rewick my nickel once every 2 weeks."
electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,lostohms,0,Tue Jul 21 15:10:41 2015 UTC,Sone people complain of Ti and ive never tried it.  Does it work better than nickel? What about flavor.  I too would be interested in stainless though its not widely available yet.   Where do you buy your ti wire
electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,lostohms,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:47 2015 UTC,"After using Ti, my nickel spools will be gathering dust. I find it much easier to work with. Nickel is just so damn soft. As far as temp control goes, it's been working fine for me, and I don't notice any difference in flavor.  However, you do have to be careful about dry burning it (gently, at low watts), you don't want titanium dioxide forming on your coils.*  I bought my first Ti wire spool on eBay, but a lot of people on ECR and ECF recommend Unkamen Supplies. The thing to watch out for when buying Ti wire is that it has to be grade 1.  Edit:*"
electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,jesus0nadinosaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:11 2015 UTC,What are the chances the sx mini will get stainless?   I mean its been out in the states what 3 - 4months so would they update it or will it go into the next one i wonder.
electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,jesus0nadinosaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:40 2015 UTC,Wow. Everyone so far is saying opus 200   Guess my package is eating shipping and returning to sender.  I thought for sure sure sx mini fans would rock up and defend it as still better. In theory they could add more wire r Types. But i have a feeling they'll be coming down to $129 soon
electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,jesus0nadinosaur,3,Tue Jul 21 17:08:03 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, the SX Mini M and SX350J chipset has been very solid for me, and I've owned it since it came out. If a removable battery was a requirement, it would be my first choice. YiHi has also been pretty good about releasing updates. They may add stainless as an option, but there's been no mention of it yet.  The DNA200 will have more features and options right off the bat. However, until it's in wide use, we still don't know if any significant issues will crop up."
electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,jungleismassiv3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:31 2015 UTC,Get the sx mini I love mine. The dna200 haven't been our for long enough for me to defend them as rock solid. The sx MINI is about as good as it gets imo out of the 6 different tc mods I own.
electronic_cigarette,3e1rfj,jesus0nadinosaur,0,Tue Jul 21 17:33:26 2015 UTC,Youre the first!  The m class is also smaller and they could add stainless to it too.   In seeing the size between the two the m class is a fair bit kore pocketable for me.

electronic_cigarette,3e3nho,twin_sis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:05 2015 UTC,I agree. I tried taking it up to 30W and it was just horrid. I stay at 25 and it's  pretty perfect for me.

electronic_cigarette,3e3nho,87f,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:10 2015 UTC,Man my friend turned it to 80w instead of Firing and handed it to me. It was so bad I threw up.
electronic_cigarette,3e3nho,jesus0nadinosaur,0,Tue Jul 21 19:13:36 2015 UTC,You should probabaly use less cotton less is more in this situation. I just got a new subtank and with the rba 30w is about optimul.
electronic_cigarette,3e3nho,SupremeWizardry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:30 2015 UTC,"Less is more with the cotton in the RBA.  Also, IMO... placement matters more than anything else.  Don't cram it up against the juice channel holes.  Make sure it's all feathered out, and then push it just near the channels.  Remember, when the liquid saturates your cotton, it will expand and ""reach"" for the channels.  An ideal build (for me at least) will have the channels ""looking"" like they're blocked off from within the housing when in reality it's the cotton reaching its natural saturation point which will bring it right up against the walls of the RBA.  This way it's at an organic expansion point while being fluffed up, feathered out enough so as to allow for it to easily drink in more juice as I fire the mod."
electronic_cigarette,3e3nho,Jayteo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:09 2015 UTC,I think the subtank minis are just simply not good. I know they get a lot of praise here but I've owned 2 and don't know what all the hoopla is about.

electronic_cigarette,3e3ne7,xhris11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:04 2015 UTC,Yeah that's because there isn't airflow. Tc has to have airflow over the coil because without it it's hitting the temp limit instantly. It's normal nothing to worry about brother

electronic_cigarette,3e3n7s,Plumphone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I tried getting some straight nickel wire and the people at the store told me that I should use nichrome instead of nickel due to its similarity to kanthal. They said TC would still work using nichrome and the mod lets me adjust both the temp and wattage settings instead of locking me in only wattage or temp mode. Weird.
electronic_cigarette,3e3n7s,shamelessjames,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:34 2015 UTC,"They just bullshitted you into a wire purchase you can't even use for TC. Nichrome has been used for non TC for years even before the rise of kanthal. Sorry OP it ain't gonna work   Edit: they probably just told you that because they didn't have any nickel and didn't want to lose a sale. In all reality buy online, if you only buy 1 thing ever online make it wire,  Stores usully sell 1$ a foot, sometimes 5$ for a 10 foot spool for wire when you can find it online for 5-7$ for a 100 foot spool. It's a massive markup"

Back in the day I payed 2$ a foot for wire at my local store.  So I saved up 150$ I figured surely I can get it a little cheaper online. At 150$ for a 100 foot roll that would only be 1.50 a foot.  Maybe I can go online and get it for a bit less than that even.   What's the first thing I find... 11$ for a 100' roll, or 25$ for 300' I was fucking pissed . they literally charged me over 1500% markup"

electronic_cigarette,3e3lj7,Ferris419,3,Tue Jul 21 19:31:32 2015 UTC,"I was a pack a day (well 3/4 of a pack a day) smoker and when I switched to the Atlantis 2, my friend told me that 12 would be too much for me.  I laughed because of course I could smoke 12!  Then I put it in and coughed like I was a teenager behind the 7-11 with a 2 liter home made water bong.  I went to 6.  I don't know if you are like me, but I wanted to know why.  I was using 12 on my Naut mini and it didn't make sense that I couldn't use 12 on the Atlantis.  My friend told me that since it was a sub ohm tank, you get more out of it and the 6 mg will actually be the equiv to using 12 juice.  That made sense so I didn't question it.  Mix it, or if you are able, restock yourself in some 6 juice."
electronic_cigarette,3e3lj7,Oldvaporuser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:01 2015 UTC,Only you will know. 😄 try it but I wouldn't do 18mg at 30w maybe more like 10-15watts at the most. It's gonna be a strong hit.   My wife vapes 12mg at 11watts. With a nautilus tank. If it's to much nic do what the guy above suggested and by some with 0nic and cut it down
electronic_cigarette,3e3lj7,Bakercj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:56 2015 UTC,You can vape it but it will be really harsh. I suggest you get some of the same flavor in 0mg and mix it 50-50 that should take it down to 9 mg which should be a lot less harsh.
electronic_cigarette,3e3lj7,MitchNYM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:05 2015 UTC,You could try it. It wont hurt anything but your throat. If you take a hit and it is not comfortable then you have your answer. 18mg is pretty high. My aunt vapes 18mg and she offered to give me some juice that she doesn't use and I was not able to use it. I typically vape 3 or 6 mg. Hope this helps.
electronic_cigarette,3e3lj7,jesus0nadinosaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:30 2015 UTC,"If you're a recent cigarette smoker, the higher nicotine level shouldn't be an issue, though if you think you're ready to start and lower your nicotine intake, 18mg is quite high. I'd stick with the 6 and either get rid of the other stuff or buy that same juice in 0mg and mix them. 9mg is a nice middle ground."
electronic_cigarette,3e3lj7,vividsmoke,0,Tue Jul 21 18:21:05 2015 UTC,Shit I wouldn't even do 6mg 3mg is more what you should be aiming for. I smoked two packs a day and 3mg was more than enough. I vape 1.5 and 0mg now.

Look at global warming studies that have been funded by big oil... Hell, look at vape studies back in the day that were funded by the tobacco industry before they were buying into ecigs. Manipulating experiments and manipulating data is not very hard, and can be covered up pretty easily."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,SvartHrafn,12,Mon Jul 20 17:18:17 2015 UTC,"Bias does compromise research and you're fully correct on all counts. However, dismissing research just by an affiliation is not part of the peer review method and should not be. Take note that the researchers have an incentive to use dirty methods and do your part to read and comprehend the study to decide if their findings are reasonable, they spell out every single action and line of data in the study that can be analyzed by yourself.   Do not belittle the scientists and journal editor for publishing this study without having a scientific reason to dismiss the study. A conflict of interest is not a scientific reason, you've gotta put in the effort if you want to say they're not correct seeing as how their findings have been reviewed and published.  Edit: To clarify, I would actually love to have a discussion with you about why you may believe that these findings are not correct based on the testing method they used or any other reason pertaining to the study."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,bayfyre,3,Mon Jul 20 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I think I have an idea about where he/she may be coming from. First of all one of the big issues I have reading journal articles is the fact that I don't have enough to knowledge on the topics to access if their procedure is valid. I know that this is where we rely on the peer review process, but IMHO it has seemed like the reviewers on these e-cig articles don't really understand the product. This already makes me a little skeptical of any vaping related publication.  Throw on top of that this publication has a blatant conflict of interest in it's being funded by BTA. Not to say it instantly discredits the work, but the tobacco industry has shown a willingness to exploit the gap between the reviewers academic knowledge and knowledge of vaping.  I'm fortunate that I'm currently studying bio at a university, so I have a leg up on the general population when it comes to understanding this journal. Unfortunately though, I would say that most people on this subreddit don't have easily accessible resources to understand expert level material like this. So instead of putting in the time to really digest this, it's very tempting to just dismiss it on conflict of interest."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,SvartHrafn,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to explain this viewpoint to me. Most, if not all of what you said are very good reasons if any are to be had about not combing through the study, and I am aware and very cautious about the gaps that researchers can fill that are out of the reviewers' knowledge base.   A conflict of interest is reason to definitely be cautious, I would just like to urge people to not completely dismiss the study; The public has not dismissed the study where CE4 atomizers were used beyond their capability to show formaldehyde despite it's realistically low detection threshold in humans, which does show negatively on the reviewer's knowledge about vaping and brings the bias danger much closer to home. ""Won't be fooled again!"" whether it be good news or bad. I have no solution to those who can't comprehend the journals, however - It's a very unfortunate place to be.  On another note, do you have any thoughts or complaints with what you've read from this study? I've not found anything to put me off so far and as I posted above, I was very impressed by their VIRTOCELL system! It would be nice to have had a 10hr or 3-4 day exposure IMO but I'm not sure how stable those cells can stay in their own collective, so maybe they were worried about some sort of deterioration?"
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,bayfyre,3,Mon Jul 20 19:06:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't taken a close look at the study yet, as I'm pretty swamped at the moment, but I haven't seen anything that seems like red flag. This may just me being a pessimist, but I can't help but think that the 6hr exposure is a result of the researchers feeling the pressure of producing something publishable. I can't help but think that the shorter the exposure time, the better the e-cigs look. Although take that with a huge grain of salt, because I know very little about the procedures for these kinds of tests."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,chrisorange,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard this is the major problem. These studies are designed for other researchers and scientists to analyse and tear apart. You can be a ""journalist"" and either cherry pick what you want or just not have the mental fortitude to understand what something ACTUALLY means.  All of those studies Farsalinos picks apart for not being realistic vaping conditions for example. You're not Farsalinos and neither are these journalists. Would Farsalinos notice that NO one in vaping takes 2 hour long drags? Yes. Would a Journalist...maybe not. Does the public labor over trying to decipher complex things presented in scientific papers? No...they read journalists.  In the same day they will write some crap they don't know anything about and then talk about Kim K's ass for page clicks. So yes...I would belittle journalists when it comes to deciphering actual studies.  AND I don't mean to belittle their ""mental fortitude"" either. You can be a smart journalist and of course you can. It's just a way of saying even scientists don't know what the hell is going on in different papers or studies they are reviewing. The process is intense even if it's what you do for a living."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,SvartHrafn,2,Mon Jul 20 19:45:44 2015 UTC,"Woah, what I meant was the journalist/editor for the journal that the studies are published in! I'm sorry for not making that more clear; This article's journalist nor many other journalists in the sector of media aren't worth their weight for scientific information.  I'm not Farsalinos, though I do aspire to become such a driven doctorate holding research scientist and can understand the jargon and scientific method clearly enough to know when a study is completely bogus. No offense taken from that and I didn't mean to imply at all that I'm a scientist or that you need to be to get some of the main points and analyze the red flags that can come into play.  Again, major apologies for sticking up for the article's journalist if that is what I implied. I'm strictly speaking about editors and reviewers for the scientific journal that the study gets submitted to! My TL;DR is that denying the study based on perceived bias is something the highly trained reviewers and (scientific) journalists are already watching out for and that if they published it, it's worth consideration and may be legitimate without the expected bias."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,keboh,2,Mon Jul 20 22:04:29 2015 UTC,"Simply stated: nicotine (which is contained in the vast majority of electronic cigarettes, though an important note is that eliquid can be made without it) is linked to tumor growth, it promotes cancer growth. It is also a stimulant that increases blood pressure. This is a toxic effect... The click bait headline screaming ""NO toxic effects"" is already throwing up tons of red flags.  I will give you this though: I have not read the study itself in any sort of thorough fashion.

electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,futuretrash,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. From what I read in the article I'll link below, it seems that yes, flavors and coils do pose very little risk as far as toxicity (next to none!) BUT no one ever in the history in everdom has ever inhaled as much PG and VG as we do!  http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2458-14-18.pdf"
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,muricabrb,0,Mon Jul 20 22:33:23 2015 UTC,"Um, cannabis vapor seems to actually improve health and fights cancer. That's one."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,JustCallMeDave,0,Mon Jul 20 18:13:29 2015 UTC,"It is possibly non toxic, however the fact that PG/VG are both oil based chemicals could possibly be a problem in the long run.. Especially for the cloud chasing crowd."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,SvartHrafn,7,Mon Jul 20 20:27:26 2015 UTC,"Has NO Toxic Effect   There is already evidence that nicotine itself can cause vascular damage to the endothelial walls of the artieries so the title is pretty broad. Having said that, still much better than traditional cigarettes any day."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,JustCallMeDave,5,Mon Jul 20 19:45:08 2015 UTC,"Here's a study from Dr. Farsalino's site that showed no decrease of elasticity, surprisingly. I had this same worry initially.   http://www.ecigarette-research.com/web/index.php/research/2013/144-electronic-cigarettes-contrary http://www.ecigarette-research.com/EUROECHO2013-ecigs.pdf"
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,SvartHrafn,3,Mon Jul 20 16:23:47 2015 UTC,I don't know if this study is really helpful in that it took place over just the course of 20 minutes whereas hardening of the arteries takes place over years. My understanding is that vascularization of arterial plaques can be caused by nicotine and as such nicotine alone contributes to hardening of the arteries.
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,JustCallMeDave,5,Mon Jul 20 17:40:25 2015 UTC,"The study is helpful because we can see a significant strain of the arteries in that time period from cigarettes where there is no difference studied in that same period from e-cigarettes. I'm not going to deny that nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, but I would wager that it's damage is no more severe than caffeine use or exercise when it's not accompanied by multiple carcinogens, tars and toxins that cause conditions that can be exaggerated by vasoconstrictors."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,SvartHrafn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"I agree the strain aspect is helpful, but the vasoconstriction aspect is not the real concern from an arteriosclerosis perspective which was what my original point addressed. The artery walls can be affected by nicotine alone over the course of time so the jury is still very much out on the safety of Ecigs."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,JustCallMeDave,2,Mon Jul 20 18:08:26 2015 UTC,"You have a valid point and I would like to see in what ways short of long term exposure that we could use to test to see if this may be the case for vapers. I would hope that we would be at a decreased risk for arteriosclerosis, but I'm even less familiar with cardiovascular disease to begin to even make speculations. Good food for thought!"
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,SvartHrafn,3,Mon Jul 20 18:23:05 2015 UTC,I would like to see in what ways short of long term exposure that we could use to test to see if this may be the case for vapers   Mice everywhere just shuddered.
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,dfuqt,2,Mon Jul 20 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"That is exactly why I couldn't in full right livelihood conduct research in the medical or bio fields :/ We gotta get those cultured cells reliable and modified to age more quickly to get a possible look at long term effects, I'd think. I hope it's as easy as that - Not to de-rail, I just find the practice very saddening although I see the huge importance in lab mice."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,JustCallMeDave,3,Mon Jul 20 18:50:44 2015 UTC,"This is the part of vaping safety that I would love to see more on. Most vapers - myself included - report an improvement in breathing after switching from smoking. And that's great. But I have known only a small number of people who have suffered any pulmonary disease after years of smoking while the number of people with cardiovascular issues is huge.   I'm happy that vaping has to be safer than smoking, and I'm reducing the nicotine levels with the ultimate aim of giving up altogether. But that's some time off."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,dfuqt,2,Tue Jul 21 01:50:05 2015 UTC,"I have known only a small number of people who have suffered any pulmonary disease after years of smoking while the number of people with cardiovascular issues is huge.    I speak to people who smoke or have loved ones who smoke and Im shocked that they have NO idea that lung cancer is not the primary concern they should have from smoking, but rather, the cardiovascular aspects. Only 7-10% or so of smokers get lung cancer. But vascular diseases caused by smoking kill more smokers from heart attacks and strokes then cancer. Obviously vaping is better for you, but it will be interesting to see the data over how much better for you it is which will take time."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,JustCallMeDave,3,Mon Jul 20 18:16:57 2015 UTC,"This is exactly my concern. I currently vape at work with an ex smoker / current vaper who has suffered a small stroke, and a current smoker who's had a heart attack and had stents fitted. In my previous job one of my smoking buddies suffered two heart attacks in just a few months. I could see that the winds of shit were blowing my way, but it was only last year after a heart related scare that I finally gave up smoking for good."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,digger585,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"This is exactly my concern.    I think if more people were informed about the mechanism by which smoking cigs harms your body they would be more inclined to quit. And even if vaping does have some associated risks, it is still better than traditional cigarettes."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,JustCallMeDave,3,Mon Jul 20 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this adds to this discussion,but here goes. Years ago ( maybe 20 ) my doctor told me that he tells the younger male patients that smoking will decrease blood flow to the penis. Of course we all know this to be true. I just turned 61 January of this year. I quit smoking 13 months ago and have been vaping ever since. Probably going through 10 mils of juice a day every day. I can honestly say that blood flow to that area is EASILY back to when I was 40 years old. Don't mean to gross anyone out. I just feel this was worth mentioning."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,naazrael,2,Mon Jul 20 18:58:31 2015 UTC,Totally worth mentioning and probably worthy of it's own post. Living a long life is only worth it if you're still living....and part of that means the private reporting for duty. Sidenote: consider fish oil supplements if you don't already take them. Really improves blood flow.
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,dfuqt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:00 2015 UTC,New studies suggest that fish oil may not be as beneficial as we thought!
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,Qx2J,2,Mon Jul 20 21:09:42 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It kind of hits home how hard it is to quit when someone is standing next to you with a cigarette in one hand, with the other arm outstretched to show you the scar where the surgeon went in through an artery to install their stent. I still miss smoking sometimes, but I am never doing it again."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,surffishman,6,Mon Jul 20 22:45:28 2015 UTC,Guys lets not start citing biased sources. If we go down that road then were no better than the chicken-littles who say there is anti-freeze in vapor.

electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,Adavicro,2,Mon Jul 20 19:29:47 2015 UTC,Wait... so they're actually employing science to determine the nature of electronic cigarette cytotoxicity in lung function?! How dare they!
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,YaGottadoWhatYaGotta,2,Mon Jul 20 21:09:39 2015 UTC,"While I believe e-cigarettes are a magnitude more safer than analog cigarettes, there is no way it is completely harmless. Surely there are things we don't know yet about certain flavorings or the effect of PG and VG in the lungs, the science is still young in regard to vaping. Still, vaping is obviously the healthy option. We're all guinea pigs in this."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,Adavicro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:35 2015 UTC,"We also can't rule it out as being any more toxic then normal air though also at this point, and PG has been used in inhalers for years and if I recall is used the the air systems in hospitals for anti-bacterial reasons."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,YaGottadoWhatYaGotta,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:11 2015 UTC,"I would be curious to see a sample of air from say, downtown LA or mainland China vs. pure VG and nicotine, to see the effects. That would be an interesting study to see."
electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,portugalthephilosoph,2,Tue Jul 21 00:24:21 2015 UTC,"I live in Staten Island, NY, I almost feel like when I vape I am lessening my chances of disease(Slightly joking....maybe...?).....sadly.

electronic_cigarette,3dxe6q,christopherson,5,Tue Jul 21 00:31:30 2015 UTC,"The funding of the study is largely irrelevant.  If it's good science, it's good science.  If the procedures are sound and the conclusions follow logically from the observations, the funding doesn't matter.  If the procedures aren't described properly or if there are flaws in the science, then it's a bad study regardless of who funds it."

electronic_cigarette,3e0nwj,Socific,8,Tue Jul 21 01:27:51 2015 UTC,Welcome to the the Dark Side lol...but the Subox Kit is a great starter sub ohm kit...comes with a rebuildable deck as well...you should be fine...make sure to get up to date with battery saftey and ohms law before you begin building your own coils. Check VapeNW.com for the subox kit...i believe they were getting more instock. Youtube is a great source for help and so is this sub...any questions feel free to inbox me and enjoy your new vaping journey!

electronic_cigarette,3e0nwj,PorkRollAndEggs,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:23 2015 UTC,"If it's not too much trouble. I'll probably wait a week or two before getting it anyway, it might come back in stock by then."
electronic_cigarette,3e0nwj,PorkRollAndEggs,4,Tue Jul 21 02:06:25 2015 UTC,"This is just copy/pasta from what I said on a thread another day (since the SUBOX was already suggested). Some things may not apply to you since this is just copypasta:  Kanger Subox Mini.  Vistavapors.com with code vv3 and it should come to $51 with free shipping.  You'll need to buy replacement coils AND a QUALITY 18650 battery. Samsung 25r, Sont VTC4 or VTC5, LG HE2. Might consider an external charger as well.  Should be able to get all of that from that site (minus the charger) for about $70 if my math is correct.    Here's the screenshots for you.  http://puu.sh/iZAWb/84ca861677.png Vista Vapors. SUBOX Mini, with a set of 5 extra 0.5 ohm coils. Discount code vv3.  http://puu.sh/iZAZn/0b4bc43b95.png http://puu.sh/iZBg6/848a73736d.png Illumn.com , two Samsung 25r batteries, and a Nitecore i2 charger. Or you can go with the Nitecore D2 charger for a few $ extra.  You NEED at least 1 battery for the SUBOX, and you can also charge the battery through the SUBOX itself, although many do not recommend it.  Total comes to just over $92, but if you're going with the SUBOX Mini, you will need a battery that is good.  You could probably get a purple efest from vistavapors along with your order, and it'd be around $71 shipped if you don't want the stuff from illumn. However, if you upgrade in the future, most mods take the 18650 batteries and some of those don't have the ability to charge through the device itself. So you may need the batteries and charger anyway.    If you feel comfortable doing some rebuildable stuff, the SUBOX also comes with an RBA. You could definitely get by on what is supplied as far as the 2 coils, and I think the few parts for their RBA until next week as well (payday?).   With the RBA, you can buy some Kanthal and cotton (I don't know a site, or what wire size, nor price), and save a lot of money in the long run, while having fun and learning at the same time by building your own coils."
electronic_cigarette,3e0nwj,CWinthrop,2,Tue Jul 21 02:11:19 2015 UTC,"That's if you're wanting the SUBOX though. There's so many different things out there. You may want to also look into a TC device since that is the ""new thing"" and some tanks won't work on the currently SUBOX due to the fixed 510 connection. The newer SUBOX should have a spring loaded one."

Like what mod should I get, what batteries, what atomizer. That Subox Kit looks like a good starter kit. I'd highly recommend getting a subohm tank (one that you don't have to build) since they put out some good vapor and flavor. If you do have to buy batteries to put in a mod read up on some ohms law and battery safety and get a good charger.   When I first started vaping I had a cig-a-like from V2 and it was okay for a while but then I finally jumped off the deep end and got my first mod. That's when vaping really got interesting for me. I took a lot of time to read all the information I could about mods, batteries, chargers, attys, and building and just learned as much as I could. That's probably the best advice I can give you is just read as much as you can.   I hope you find the vape that you're looking for!"
