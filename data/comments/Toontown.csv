Toontown,3e3b9y,OtakuSRL,14,Tue Jul 21 17:36:49 2015 UTC,TTR is going to axe this likely very quickly.
Toontown,3e3b9y,GeekyGamerGavin_,7,Tue Jul 21 19:12:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know. It's not a threat. Most likely, Lefty is using a modified client of sorts, which would be hard to detect.  EDIT: Also, it looks like the actual message receiving is being handled on a server, separate from the webpage. The page itself is just getting it from that server. This means that the code to receive the messages is inaccessible, therefore making it harder to patch."
Toontown,3e3b9y,joshsora,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:07 2015 UTC,It's probably just a simple man-in-the-middle with interest in all playgrounds on that shard waiting for chat updates to come through.

Toontown,3e3b9y,ultgamer21,3,Tue Jul 21 17:28:43 2015 UTC,He probably has a modified client running in Vibrant Valley. Since everyone in that zone gets every message sent (Even the ones out of screen) the client sends it to a web server that the website feeds from.

Goofy had finally finished setting up his empire using permission from the trains of the cogs to move his barrels to facilities to be reminded of his monopoly. His money river was overflowing.   Suddenly, a small figure stood at the door. He introduced himself as Slappy, the head of the cogs, and a former toon that wanted vengeance on toonkind. While the cogs, especially the Cashbots, enjoyed the money that they got from Goofy using their express trains, Slappy thought on a different level. He pondered if Goofy was just using the cogs as a setup to restock the gags of toons to defeat the cogs.  Slappy Asks Goofy ""What do you plan to do with the money?"" Goofy responds with ""I will send money to Doctor Surlee to make more gags"" At this point, Slappy realized that his thought was true. Goofy was only using the cogs in order to promote toon gags while acting to help the cogs. The situation was desperate.  Slappy realized that if he did not burn the money and explode his facilities, then he may destroy all of his cogkind. Therefore, with a fearless quack Slappy used a torch to brind down his room and burn all of his money.  And now goofy cant afford doors or lights. Lik if u cri ever tim"

Toontown,3e1olw,joey19982,4,Tue Jul 21 12:47:13 2015 UTC,That means your account was created 285 days ago.

Some Toons may experience ""weird"" timings until they receive their next cattlelog.   That's my guess.  The old cattlelog probably didn't work right since it was created when the timings were still locked.  While your new toons immediately got a new cattlelog that did work properly."

It's oddly specific to that community as there really isn't ""another"" sort of side community to Toontown besides streaming and YouTube. Love 'em both, but still.      Somebody literally posted a picture of some streamer guy eating potato chips with a reference nobody understood as the title maybe two or so weeks ago. Funny, but not in the intended way unless you're in the 1% who understands the joke. That one wasn't even specific to a community or a streamer, it was to that individual stream. Then stick it on Reddit, the odds are quite low of anybody recognizing it. Plus everybody who would get the joke probably already laughed at it while it happened a minute earlier. :P"

As for SOS shopping just stick to doing it with dedicated groups (use the irc!) as the best measure. Otherwise inform everyone BEFORE joining groups/entering elevator that you're shopping.  The skipper is actually a hack and shouldn't be allowed, so keep away from it. The 'scare' tactic was a warning and the guy who got caught is VERY lucky that he didn't get terminated. If it were Disney running the game, he'd have got terminated first sight.  Overall it's almost impossible to get permanently banned. You'd have to be on a very special level of toxic for that to happen. People tend to tell biased stories when they get banned, usually disregarding other offenses they have committed. But obviously there are false positives on bans, and these can be rectified."

Level 50 hollywoods are the ones who mostly do this since they have unlimited access to VP fights (not having to get merits after), but anyone else can too if they want. It's considered greening if doing it in random groups who mostly want the promotion/helping lower toons since you're leaving everyone else to do a 7 man (potentially less if there's more shoppers in the group) and they might go green since they needed help."

Toontown,3dvoty,Me-Mow_,14,Mon Jul 20 15:05:19 2015 UTC,"Most of the videos you've seen there are made by people who hide a lot of facts. For most of them it is not their first warning even if they claimed it was, and it's not a coincidence that they got banned while recording it. Most of them only recorded cause they knew that they are going to get themselves banned, and they wanted to upload it to youtube to show how bad the mods are. They did it BECAUSE they wanted to get banned and then upload the video. If you are doing things trying to get banned - don't be surprised when you are really banned. I don't know if all of them are cases like that, but at least most of them are. So far all of those I've seen were people who twisted the truth and managed to hide the real facts from their viewers, only to make the TTR team look bad.  You really have nothing to worry about! Shopping is not allowed if you are going with the group who isn't all shopping and then leave them there alone. THIS is when you will break the rules, cause running can result them going sad. If you clearly said you are going to shop before entering, and they agreed to go with you anyway, you have nothing to worry about cause that is not greening.  Greening is not ""being on a battle with a toon who went sad"". Greening is leaving another toon to go sad on purpose. You will only break the rules if you took actions on purpose to result toons going sad, or if we found out you closed the game on purpose over and over again at the middle of battles in order to leave the toons alone to go sad. If you crashed/disconnected/didn't pick a gag because you lagged, you will not get yourself in any trouble. This only counts to people who clearly did it on purpose.  Being reported will not get you banned, all reports are being checked seriously, and action will only be taken if we can prove you did it. If you didn't pick toon up cause of lag and then someone reported you for greening, nothing will happen to you. All actions in the game are logged and our moderators can always check what exactly happen, a report only means that someone asked us to check it, but no action will be taken unless you really broke the rules.  People go sad on battles all of the time, you won't get in trouble of greening just because cold callers who were with you went sad, even if all of them went sad. It is only greening if you let them go sad on purpose.  Honestly I think you can be relaxed, don't believe anything you see on the internet. Judge for yourself, so far nobody has ever been banned forever from TTR without to actually break a rule. If someone was ever banned by mistake (humans make mistakes sometimes, we are not robots), all they would need to do would be just sending an email to have it checked again, and if it really was a mistake, the ban would ALWAYS be removed.  People who are banned forever - no matter what they tell you and no matter what they claim, they ALL really broke rules. Not a single person was ever banned forever without to clearly break rules.  As long as you don't try to do anything bad on purpose, you can feel completely safe. :) Don't let others scare you when you have nothing to worry about. It's our interest to have you keep playing, why would we ever want to ban someone who didn't really do anything bad on purpose?"

You don't have any idea about what goes on on the moderation side of things (and you've admitted that before). You're just parroting what you've been told to say.  The truth is one moderator handles 95% of the bans. He is the judge, jury and executioner. When you make an appeal, this moderator's opinion is the only one that matters. It also isn't as simple as ""sending in an email and having it checked."" The staff often runs behind multiple weeks on tickets. Most also claim that they ""do not provide support through the IRC,"" or any other outlet outside of email for that matter. This begs the question of what purpose contacting support in the first place has.  If in fact you are able to get someone reasonable and willing to help you, they will first give their opinion. If they rule in your favor, they will claim that they will ""see to it that this moderator looks into it and gets back to you."" This never happens however.  Just thought you should be informed on the subject.  Also, as an aside: No matter how noble a person might be there needs to be checks and balances. Giving someone unlimited power is a dangerous thing. History has shown us that."

They would ignore that and focus on a player who is only ""getting to places in a reasonable amount of time"", if you know what I mean.  It leads me to believe that not everyone on their moderation team is actually trained with some general guidelines. The ToS makes it so that bias is allowed in deciding if a player should be banned for being/doing/acting x. Even if it doesn't make sense, they can still ban.... for fun.  There should be role delegation and limits to how often they can ban people. Because I'm sure not every ban is considered critically before that button is pushed."

Toontown,3dpppx,DrakeFeatherwing,-6,Sat Jul 18 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"Well, this is really how they can sound. :P And the fact that they get super frustrated to the level where it emulates screaming in caps lock is why it makes sense, while the people who try to offer ideas to make the game better mostly maintain their composure, like me.

Toontown,3dpppx,TokiSpirit,2,Sat Jul 18 17:27:05 2015 UTC,"Nonacceptance of ""constructive criticism"" doesn't make opinions less valid, it just means that they don't agree with constructive criticism.

Honestly, posting on reddit seems to be a poor way to make constructive criticism anyway; just send an email to the staff.   while the people who try to offer ideas to make the game better mostly maintain their composure, like me.   kk"
Toontown,3dpppx,volcano_bake_meat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:26:11 2015 UTC,"Constructive criticism. And Reddit is where your ideas can be shared and addressed by others in the community who play the game. Emailing support just adds to their ten-ton pile of emails that will most likely never even be attentively looked at by the team (at least not for weeks), while posting to Reddit gets the attention of dozens."
Toontown,3dpppx,TheRealKingofmice,5,Sat Jul 18 19:50:50 2015 UTC,"I guess we'll just see where this attention gets us. I guess I've been lucky but support has always answered questions/taken suggestions within a day, and frankly I would expect that the information goes to where it needs to be much more efficiently than posting here where Reddit where certainly it gets the attention of many, but the wrong people.  Sorry if I come off as confrontational - I didn't intend to direct anything at you but I've seen quite a few of these ""short-sighted"" posts of this manner (again, by the community at large and not you specifically), especially in regards to the recent change to the whitelist. I totally get the grievances here, but I hope the TTR community understands that the staff are stuck between a rock and a hard place when balancing their obligations to both the community and the tenets of the game itself (especially when we have corporatist ""rats"" watching over to prevent degradation of the company name). IMO quite a few of those posts do come off as narrow-minded in respect to the atmosphere that TTR seems to have a faux-legal obligation to protect. And frankly, judging by TRD's responses, it seems like the staff is apologetic and sorry that we don't enjoy the decision (myself included) but I doubt that they are reversing the decision, or the trend. I guess my point is that we can decry things and give ""constructive"" criticism but nothing can be very constructive if 1) the criticism isn't delivered in a very constructive way or 2) the criticism is simply not something they are willing to change.  Sorry again for getting a little rant-y but this is how I've seen the situation. While TTR could do a lot more to improve on situations like this, sometimes certain decisions that make me vomit in my mouth a little need to be stomached because there's simply nothing to do about it. It's been in my mind that the devs of TTR have certain obligations to put over others (meaning familial, legal, how they want the game to be, etc.) that prevent meaningful change to take place in a meaningful amount of time. Again, I dislike the decision they made with the whitelist but any criticism against it fails to be constructive simply because it's a waste of breath; they are not in a place to do anything about it, or they simply won't. Either way, their decision with the whitelist should show their hand pretty clearly."
Toontown,3dpppx,mayormaynotbeatrash,4,Sun Jul 19 00:10:30 2015 UTC,I actually concur with this. It's getting bothersome seeing people complain about such a thing.
Toontown,3dpppx,DrakeFeatherwing,2,Sat Jul 18 07:40:39 2015 UTC,"I hate this argument. This and ""It's in BETA so stop complaining, of course there's gonna be bugs"". I'm seeing less of it now than I was when the game first went into semi-open beta. (Though, I don't know how it is on mmocentral right now. That place has always been the biggest culprit of these arguments) I think when the game first released, people were just so happy to have toontown back that they were willing to put up with whatever issues TTR had. But I mean, the bugs and glitches were also more understandable that time since the game first released. I really did suggest people step away from the game for a day or so during the early days when crashing and lag were non-stop, to people who were pulling the ""FIX YOUR STUPID SERVER"" from day one. Those kinds of complaints aren't constructive in any way.   TTR has made a lot of awesome progress since then, that's an undeniable fact. But it's by no means perfect. The game needs to know what's wrong in order for them to fix it. And if there's something (like the whitelist change) that makes the general playerbase unhappy, they have to know that a LOT of people dislike the changes if there's ever going to be even an attempt to fix it. I agree that not every complaint is constructive, but people shouldn't pull the ""BETA"" and ""FREE"" shields out to protect the game from any form of criticism."
Toontown,3dpppx,jman135790,3,Sat Jul 18 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"I very much agree. Yes, everyone should express their gratitude for the service the TTR mods have done for the Toontown community. I, for one, am very appreciative of all their efforts to make the game free and accessible for everyone who enjoyed TTO. So for any mods who may read this, I want to wholeheartedly thank you for all that you do.   However, whenever someone tries to make a suggestion or complaint in this subreddit, please don't misinterpret their input for ungratefulness or ill will. That person is also trying to better the game for the community by bringing up valid points. The TTR staff members' moderation of the game should not be exempt from constructive criticism or feedback just because they volunteered their services to the community. No. Always strive for improvement. Don't become complacent with anything less than your best effort, even if others appear to be fine with it. With greater openness to new ideas and opinions, maybe, just maybe, we could help bring this game to new heights. Just my 2 cents."

They have more players online than all other remakes combined have ever had.  Do you think that you can do better? Put up your own server and make the rules that you know everybody craves. If you're right, then people will leave TTR in droves for your server, and you'll have all of the business and be a hero. It won't cost more than a thousand or two to get online. Somebody with your savvy can swing it with no problem. Have fun fixing the bugs, dealing with the Leftys and Mavericks, responding to the hundreds of emails per day wanting one thing or another, and coming to Reddit and reading rants from all of the people who will complain that you aren't doing enough, are doing too much, aren't putting their special feature online, or are doing things the wrong way. It never ends, because you can't please everybody, and something that makes some people happy will make others unhappy.  So let us know when you open your fantastic server. Or just fling the downvote and a snide comment my way, and don't forget to mention that this is the first comment on an account created less than an hour ago.  I doubt you have a clue in this world what it takes in time, money, and aggravation to put a server like this up, keep it running, and try to make the majority of people happy.

Toontown,3dpppx,CaptainMax_,3,Sat Jul 18 12:58:56 2015 UTC,"Okay... my brief looks into the FNAF community and its YouTube comments have prepared me for this... I'm ready.   News flash. They ARE a successful server.   Then let me rephrase his point: If they want to be a more successful server. Honestly, I feel like you could have gotten that out of what he said without my help. Something can always improve its popularity (until it reaches a certain point, of course, but TTR isn't even close to that point) and if improving gameplay is what it takes, then that's certainly something to consider.   Do you think that you can do better? Put up your own server and make the rules that you know everybody craves.   And you rant on and on about this point for a good 2 paragraphs before ending with a ""You whiners make me sick."" which is pretty dramatic I have to say. But besides that, you make multiple ridiculous assumptions in the previous 2 paragraphs. First, you assume he's saying he has the talent TTR has. Whatever that talent is, he never said that and to assume someone with a lesser talent could create a server like TTR is just silly. Second, you assume that he has the resources to make a server like TTR. Not everyone does, and to throw this out as another assumption really doesn't work on your part at all. Tell you what, let's change it: Can the average team with TTR's talent and resources do as good as TTR has? Well, I mean probably, considering TTR has made it this far. I think we'd need a few different servers with TTR's talent and resources put together but with different mindsets. There would be a server focused on economy, a server focused on gameplay, a server focused on graphics, and so on. But until that happens, it's no good telling a single person to randomly create a server like TTR just because they had a few problems with it. And that brings me to the final assumption: A single person's work because you said so is good enough to create a large, successful server with a few thousand players and content. No, no, no. And the fact that this is your (basically only) argument is just silly. We're different people, and when one group does something wrong you have to point it out so they can make improvements. You can not assume the answer is to ignore it because ""you can't do better."""
Toontown,3dpppx,BlUeSapia,2,Sat Jul 18 15:07:45 2015 UTC,"Stupid question, but why would TTR care about popularity if they don't make any money?  Seems like they have no reason to care what we think.  Note that I am definitely against the current censorship policies."
Toontown,3dpppx,Garry95,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:31:29 2015 UTC,"Well I think popularity would be important to them because it means that Toontown has more attention drawn to it, which is good since it helps keep the community alive. Also, it must be very great to know that a product (even if it's non-profit) you spent time on is being used and enjoyed by more than just a few. That has always seemed to be their attitude towards it in my opinion. But they do make some money, just through Toonbook donations instead of ingame purchases."

Toontown,3dt8wm,marcus_colin,2,Sun Jul 19 06:33:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think Walt would keep it open as long as he knew it was making people happy. Looking at his life, he seemed to prioritize the happiness of others, and that's what made HIM happy. If he knew about all the stories of people and Toontown, he would keep it open.  I mean, the man wanted his company to build and run an entire city to keep people happy, Toontown wouldn't be anywhere as big of a deal."
Toontown,3dt8wm,ObeliskTheTormentor-,-2,Sun Jul 19 09:39:58 2015 UTC,well we'll never really know because i doubt none of us who play toontown knew him personally so who knows what he was thinking of doing with his company
Toontown,3dt8wm,archn,2,Sun Jul 19 10:27:19 2015 UTC,"That's where you're wrong.  Marcus colin couldn't be further from the truth.  How about you do some research on Walt Disney yourself.  Look up the prices of tickets to Disney World while he was the owner, and look up the prices immediately after Michael Eisner took over control of the company.  Walt Disney was a wonderful person, despite how his employees felt about him during the great depression.  It wasn't his fault that he couldn't pay them what they deserved.  If people can't afford to pay to watch his movies, he can't afford to pay them a full pay.  I think Walt Disney would be happy that someone decided to keep a Disney product open after his turned-evil corporation shut it down.  However, I do think he would be disappointed with some of the moderation, but that's another subject."
Toontown,3dt8wm,ObeliskTheTormentor-,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:21:32 2015 UTC,just remember one thing people always have two sides to them a good side and a bad side even research can't be 100% so its whatever i still think he would of shut down the 3 games disney already did because of hacking and such
Toontown,3dt8wm,TheSwagMuffinOG,2,Sun Jul 19 13:40:42 2015 UTC,you make Walt Disnet sound like he has some wierd twisted side. maybe if Walt Disney was alive he may of tried to stop all the hacking more hut at the rate toontown was going it was losing money. I men they defiantly kept it up longer than other companies would but the amount of people getting free member ships and district resetting just for the fun of it... it makes me mad when people say disney cares nothing for the fans. no company ishappy when shut down day comes.

To me, that comes off as a moderator not liking popular used words of the current generation, or perhaps they just did not know the meaning of the word, who knows. There's zero communication.  And, what's even more ridiculous, they're banning harmless word after harmless word when people decide to evade the censors. The most popular word being ""beach"", which was removed from people abusing the word. So, now it's summer, and I can't say beach because a couple of people evaded the censorship. The entire community was punished instead of those individuals themselves. How is that right? It feels like we're going to be left with a very, very simple vocabulary if this trend continues, and people are just going to resort to adding each other on Skype, which will lead to a whole potential load of other consequences TTR will be responsible for.   TTR needs a massive overhaul in moderation. We have unnamed moderators, who, instead of sticking around Vibrant Valley and filtering the garbage that goes on there most of the time, actually go out and, as they admitted it to an individual, LOOK for people to ban on accounts of greening. On top of that, some speak unprofessionally to the fans of the game, which also isn't right. Having some experience as a moderator/GM in another online game, moderation in TTR is very poorly handled in my perspective. I'm pretty disappointed in TTR."

Toontown,3dlxgt,glottal__stop,9,Sat Jul 18 04:20:02 2015 UTC,"Another issue in the Encyclopedia of Toontown Rewritten Safety Features:  Whitelist ""Improvements""  You really nailed it as to why the continued censorship is pointless. If there's a legitimate use for a word in the game, I don't see why it should be omitted. I understand why words like ""church"" or ""atheist"" were removed from the original whitelist, they have no purpose in the game. But with words like ""die"" and ""noob,"" there's a purpose for them in the game. I can't think of anyone who is offended by the term ""noob,"" , and if anything it is used as a playful insult, or to criticize someone's play. And for ""die,"" must the game be so in favor of toddlers that a cog can't even die, it must ""go sad""? Why not just disable the chat feature as a whole and go back to Speedchat if we're going back to this nothing-can-slide policy? Innuendo or unwanted phrases can always get past, there's that possibility and if you use SC+ you should accept that. It's like enabling child lock on your son or daughter who is a mature older adolescent. And, let's not forget that if there is a younger unsupervised child, I doubt the concerned parent would even let them use SC+ if they're that concerned.  The average player base of Toontown Rewritten is quite close to adulthood, so I don't see a logical standpoint in coddling the entire community because of the fact that there always may be a young child around. And why can't we just add phrases like ""go die"" or ""go dye"" to the blacklist and keep the words in the whitelist? We don't need a restrictive blacklist, AND a restrictive dictionary! But if anything, I'm always a proponent of a more lenient 13+ chat, with the whole ""parent's permission,"" and blah, blah, blah."

Toontown,3dlxgt,AnEdgyReturn,8,Fri Jul 17 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"It's just getting more frustrating as the game progresses. It's getting to the point where simple conversation is very difficult to manage. The other day I went up to a friend with my new hat and said jokingly, ""My hat will block you from the sunlight!"" Nope. Sorry. Sunlight becomes ""squeak"". Okay... how about ""My hat will give you shade!"" Ha. Try again, shade doesn't work. There was another instance where I was very low on laff so I quickly typed out ""Help, I'm hurt!"" I should have known. Hurt is censored as I see the toon run by my battle. I just don't understand why some of these words are being censored, and I'm sorry but it's really annoying at this point. TTO opened a long time ago and most of the current TTR players are teenagers. We know how to deal with each other and if there is truly a problem with a toon, then more drastic measures should be taken upon them. Hurting (oh sorry I mean wounding) the whole population is not the answer in my opinion."

Repressive chat filters never work, mostly they just annoy all the innocent people by crippling their dictionary while the scumbags find new ways to swear. Especially with capitalization, there are many, many ways to arrange words so that a human will pick up their (profane) message but a computer won't. For example, a lot of online games ban numbers because people might give out personal information. This hurts everyone else because there are many legitimate uses of numbers, and they now have to find a way around the filter. Meanwhile, the people who share too much will also find their own bypasses and give out their phone number to everyone. Moderation staff bans that bypass too, people find another, repeat until the dictionary is so crippled that everyone leaves. I had thought TTR was going to be better than this when I discovered I could use numerals."

Just ask any mod. <3  In the end, even I have to agree. Although I don't like removing average words, it's gotten to the point where if we look through what people have said, there has been more bad usage of the word rather than good. And that's a problem.  We would love for you to have free chat, and we know a lot of players are mature enough to handle it. Unfortunately, when (not just a few, but many, many) people start using it for inappropriate expression, that's when it has to go and it's removed for everyone.  Call it bad moderation or repressed communication, but many people have shown that they can't handle some words. Since we're still family-oriented and focused on safety, we'd rather get rid of words like ""kill"" so things like ""I'll kill you and your family"" aren't said to others. That's not the kind of environment we'll allow.   (And in my biased opinion, allowing that sort of chat just so people can say ""kill the cog"" is more-so bad moderation than anything. But that's just me. :P)"
Toontown,3dlxgt,TheRandomDog,12,Fri Jul 17 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"But see Point #2. People can't say ""I'll kill you"" in-game, but they can say ""I'll sKi 11 you."" It's impossible to stop people from bypassing the filters. You're not solving anything by blacklisting common words. You're just creating MORE problems, such as toons going sad because they're unable to warn their teammates that they're ""dying."""
Toontown,3dlxgt,TheRandomDog,-10,Fri Jul 17 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"I see you're reasoning. Yet there's no easy way to solve this problem. We can't allow this kind of chat, as we want maintain our family-friendly nature, one of the core things Toontown was built off of.  But if we have to figure out a way to not allow it, how do we go about it? In the end, people are forced to be ""more creative"" to use bad language, making it harder for an average (and by average, I mean someone not really familiar with all the lingo and just wants to have fun) person to actually recognize what someone is saying.  Although the person may have to be a bit less cognitive to understand, someone might be like ""I'll skill you? What? Okay..."". Especially in other cases, ""creative"" chat flies over someone's head.  What would you do instead, keeping in mind that we want to keep a family-friendly presence throughout our game? Obviously situations like these aren't ideal for every player, but a choice has to be made at some point to keep Toontown's ideals of safety and appropriateness."
Toontown,3dlxgt,coolfangs,10,Fri Jul 17 19:10:23 2015 UTC,These types of players are what mods are for.
Toontown,3dlxgt,TheRandomDog,8,Fri Jul 17 19:04:47 2015 UTC,"I understand the reasoning in that too, but I get the sense that stopping harassment is ultimately something that has to be done on an individual basis. I don't know the inner workings of the TTR moderation system, and I'm sure they take these things seriously - maybe the answer is dedicating people to the specific task of instantly responding to bullying/harassment reports. I don't know, but I understand the decision. Thanks for your responses."
Toontown,3dlxgt,AnEdgyReturn,2,Fri Jul 17 19:07:09 2015 UTC,"There are quite a lot of people doing that currently, which is why even though we take action on offenders, we also employ systems to make sure what they say can't really be said again.   So you're saying we should take our focus away from the chat and turn it almost entirely on the people who are abusing the chat? It might be a bit taxing, but I can definitely see why that'd be more beneficial."
Toontown,3dlxgt,TheRandomDog,7,Fri Jul 17 19:17:49 2015 UTC,"How about make it more noun-specific when it comes to touchy words.  ""I'll kill you"" could be blacklisted, but ""I'll kill this COG"" would be shown?  This could go for many, many phrases. This way, you just have to be a little more specific of how you're trying to communicate.  Either way, like Orpheus stated in his post, there are multiple nuances that allow one to evade the filters. However, going the extra mile and adding unquestionably inappropriate phrases to the blacklist while keeping the original word in WOULD NOT do any more harm. It would at least make it seem like the game had specific filters to keep it safe, but yet allow specific words in chat harmlessly when they have a purpose. .  And what about ""noob""? You can tell someone that you will kill their whole family, but what's so controversial about criticizing someone's incompetence, or simply using the word in a joking manner?"
Toontown,3dlxgt,poopoop60,4,Fri Jul 17 20:36:48 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting thought. Like, things relating to players such as ""dog"", ""cat"", ""toon"", ""you"", etc. would be classified as a noun relating to a player, and if something about a player was brought up, it'd be censored?  That'd take some implementation, but that's actually a neat idea. I'll bring it up."
Toontown,3dlxgt,Spike18,5,Fri Jul 17 21:03:49 2015 UTC,Disney kept the whitelist the same for a reason
Toontown,3dlxgt,TheRandomDog,6,Sat Jul 18 03:47:15 2015 UTC,"I believe that maintaining Toontown's family-friendly nature is crucial. I think, for Toontown Rewritten, a major moderation overhaul is needed. We cannot continue to just having words such as ""beach"", ""kill"", etc. censored because all this is doing is putting a tiny band-aid on a large gash -- it's ineffective. Worst of all, it persuades players to go to Skype to talk, which is unsafe and is defeating the purpose behind censoring words to begin with.  When I was a moderator for another game, we had an in-game chat channel dedicated to moderating, and I feel like TTR should try to do something similar, whether that be in-game or IRC. ANY player should be able to use this chat function to either ask a question or report another player and get an answer within a reasonable timeframe. AKA live-chat service. I could go more into detail of how a team of <50 moderators worked within this in-game chat to cater to the entire community if you'd like. I went from the lowest rank moderator to the absolute highest position, where I was in direct communication with the developers and managed the entire team with 4 others, so I knew all of the in and outs of how the system worked from all of the experience.  I think there is an approach that could be taken that is both fun and effective for TTR, too. There could be a Toon Trooper building built within TTC or another in-game playground. A section of this building would have Toon Troopers hanging around, interacting with the community, answering questions, and just having fun with Toons who choose to hangout there. These Toon Troopers could hold events and sessions within this building to teach Toons anything -- be it safety or even gag strategies. These would be the first rank of Toon Troopers, and do not possess any moderation power whatsoever.  Another area would have rank 2 Toon Troopers hanging out. These individuals are the moderators. They will respond to abuse reports from Toons in-game via whisper. If the report sounds like action needs to be taken, they will ask the user to come to the IRC or another chat where they can forward the report case and receive images as they decide what route to take in response to the report.   Lastly, the rank 3 Toon Troopers will oversee everything -- they'll be the head moderators so to speak. They will essentially manage the entire moderation team and ALL moderation efforts. When a rank 2 Toon Trooper takes action against someone's account, for instance, it will be documented by that rank 2 Toon Trooper and sent right to the rank 3 Toon Trooper for approval. Then, when the account holder questions why they've been suspended, it will all be right there in black and white, perhaps with a screenshot showing their offense.   All of the ranks will work in unison for the one goal of making TTR safe, if not safer than Disney kept it themselves. They will all be in direct contact with one another, have monthly meetings where they discuss the state of the community and moderation, and so on.  I'd be happy to help TTR with converting to this moderation model, if you guys want to take it up. If there is anything in the post or just questions you have regarding it, please let me know. There is nothing worse than a game whose moderation is insufficient, and I think this will be a very efficient way of fixing TTR's current moderation problems, while also making the game's community feel much more alive and safer!"
Toontown,3dlxgt,Spike18,3,Fri Jul 17 20:58:24 2015 UTC,"Kind of sounds like a police station.  You know, where they promote good actions and public safety, and you can come to or contact at any time to get some support or report suspicious or active behavior.  We'd probably want some more manpower to get people on around the clock, but I'm interested in hearing how your team managed in. The whole way it could fit in with ""Toon Troopers"" makes a lot of sense. I like the idea a lot, actually!"
Toontown,3dlxgt,zarlockthree,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:37:13 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's very similar to that. I think it would work so well in TTR, too! It puts the moderators directly involved with the community, gets them a response immediately so they feel assured their report was heard, and would give them all of that access without ever having to leave the game (unless requested to send screenshots of an incident). As far as manpower went, we did have around 50 people moderating as rank 2 mods. It was manageable, at times it felt as if it may have been too much. However, it was very important that there were enough rank 2 mods online to cater to the entire community at any given time, and we also wanted to have at least one of us rank 3 mods online at all times to manage.  So, as far as how our team worked, we had a rank system just like I described. All new incoming mods started at the first rank. They had the opportunity to join if recommended by one of us rank 3 mods, be it they seemed they'd be a good fit, would enjoy the role, etc. They were given a handbook .PDF file that described what was expected from them, their role, the mod team's goal, and so on (and I just found them as I was typing this :D).The first rank often gave tours around the game, held events, and interacted with the game's community. If they were doing a good job, they would be promoted to rank 2 and have actual moderation power. Before they could use moderation power, we (rank 3 mods) would spend time training them. It was only a few hours at most. Most of the mods within rank 2 would stay there for the entire duration of their time on the mod team. I actually had the great opportunity of moving up to rank 3 after only 4 months of being on the team. I was with about only 5 others managing the whole team, so it's best if rank 3 mods are kept to a very short number for management reasons.  Also, the rank 2 handbook gave lots of examples in regards to suspension and suspension time. The handbook suggested 1-4 hours for heavy cussing/complaints from other users, 24 hours would be if they had been warned before and just won't stop, and 168 hours (or a week) if they are just continue to break the terms of use/rules afterwards. Of course, before we'd even suspend we had access to other powers such as kicking them off the game, sending them a warning, and relocating them, so we did try to prevent suspensions any way we could.  Managing the team as a rank 3 mod was also enjoyable -- we held meetings monthly on Skype and would go over the mod list, discussing performance. We'd then decide whether or not we needed new additions to the team, and if so, who would be brought on. Afterwards, we would talk about any further improvements to moderation we could make and discuss it with each other. These meetings would sometimes last awhile due to the fact we constantly were laughing at irrelevant things. Somehow things got done. :P  There was also a specific amount of hours rank 1 and rank 2 mods had to put in weekly. We asked rank 2 mods to put in at least 10 hours per week and also attend the monthly mandatory meeting. If they had things that came up, we were all very understandable with it. If someone was to go offline for 30 days however, they would be booted off the team. We, rank 3 mods, would always observe to make sure they were making that quota and staying active. If they were slacking or did not make that quota multiple times, they would likely be booted off the team. Abuse of power was taken extremely seriously, too, and would also more than likely result in a removal from the team (but we rarely had this issue, thankfully). Lastly, another huge deal to us was professionalism -- and that was something I personally found to be . Moderators are representing the game and it's crucial that they set a good image of the game's staff to the community.   And I just typed an essay again. Sorry! D; I could still go even further in detail with the ins/outs if necessary, but I think I covered a good portion of it. And, again, if needed, I'd be more than happy to dedicate my time and experience towards ensuring this new system at TTR will work smoothly. :D"
Toontown,3dlxgt,DrakeFeatherwing,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:53:22 2015 UTC,"Better than just blacklisting commonly-used words that end up being misused, wouldn't a better solution be attempting to more aggressively enforce the chat rules? Hand out bans or mutes to offenders of the rules.  Are there chat logs and/or a report feature you could use to determine if somebody if is breaking the rules? Because in my opinion that would be a far better solution. (I haven't really looked)"
Toontown,3dlxgt,barry_the_cat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:07:41 2015 UTC,"There are chat logs, apparently they used them in order to determine whether or not the meme word 'shrekt' should stay (Apparently based on usage, or usage was referred to when discussed in a different thread regarding the same issue).

Toontown,3dlxgt,BalanceJF,3,Fri Jul 17 21:51:11 2015 UTC,"And apparently neither do you. So kindly mind your own business. Oh, and to clarify my point, while the Toontown name is still with Disney, the game itself is technically abandonware as Disney just stopped working on it and shut it down... Now this had been and still is a sketchy gray area where fanservers are concerned, as if the company catches wind, they can issue a C&D order for infringement to the IP, especially if there has not been any modifications made."
Toontown,3dlxgt,toon_king,-7,Fri Jul 17 21:55:13 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to see complaints and rants that support this post get upvoted, and anything that doesn't support this post get downvoted.  Remember to reserve downvotes for things that don't contribute to the discussion at all, not things that don't support the post's opinion. If you don't agree with the opinions of others, don't upvote it, but certainly don't downvote it either. Votes are not to offer your (dis)agreement on a post, but rather the quality the post brings to the discussion.  It's common Redditquette."
Toontown,3dlxgt,ledailydose,4,Fri Jul 17 22:10:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll admit that does happen quite often here on the subreddit, but I don't think that's what's happening here. You see, you and one other person are the only people who have commented anything on this post. The first made a post that basically mocked us for not knowing something that he claimed to be apparent yet he never said any thing else until someone asked him. That isn't contributing much because it's not even making a point, it's just pretending he has something to say then waiting until people ask to actually say something. And while your posts don't do that and do try to defend your point, you still aren't contributing much to the discussion simply because you kept sidestepping around the point that keeping chat friendly is what moderation is for, not heavy blacklisting. In your first comment, you only talked about it in a single phrase that was not very helpful (""Call it bad moderation or repressed communication..."") and it became even worse in your second comment. Sure, on a server with no moderation and no ability to ban players it would be bad but you ignore the moderation point almost every time. And when that's probably among the biggest parts of the other side's argument, ignoring it and trying to defend against something else doesn't contribute anything just like talking in an arrogant manner about how ""it's so obvious"" doesn't contribute anything.  Look, I'm not saying that your comments should have gotten that much downvoting and yeah, maybe the mindless downvote thing is a problem. But I think it's important to understand when the downvoting tool is used in a gray area comment that you can't ignore part of the issue and focus on another, especially when both parts compliment each other. By the way, those aren't the only things that are getting downvoted. Things that are annoying to read like people who bold their comments are also getting downvoted, and that's just because it doesn't contribute much to say something with such a huge distraction in the way."
Toontown,3dlxgt,Razors-Edge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:18:27 2015 UTC,"The bully-voting shows you just how toxic the bad people in this community are.  A lot of people are afraid to speak against them for fear of being downvoted and flamed.  The bad apples won't obey Reddit any more than they'll obey the rules of TTR, because it doesn't suit them to.  That's how self-absorbed people are.  They only care about themselves; the feelings of others don't matter.    The only way to deal with people like that in TTR is to hand out bans.  If they swear, give them one warning, then 24 hours, then 7 days, then a permanent ban.  They'll quickly understand that they won't be allowed to do as they please if it breaks the rules.  That may sound harsh, but it worked for me in the two MUDs, three forums, and one MMO I've moderated.       Now watch them make my point by this comment having a -3 score in about an hour.  Self-absorbed people are easy to manipulate."

Toontown,3dlxgt,3kittt,-12,Fri Jul 17 20:24:02 2015 UTC,So what i think is that there should be different options for people to chat in the game . first there will be the speed chat only toon so this toon can only use speed chat and any thing in speed chat plus will become meow grrr or woof . second there is also the normal chat option so these toons can use speed chat plus and they can see what other speed chat plus people are saying but there is a whitelist and blacklist so any red words will be banned and will become meow grrr or woof . third there is an option where you must go to the ttr website and confirm you are really old before you can use and it will give you no blacklist so you can say anything you want but of course if you try to break the rules you will still be banned by ttr . i hope this idea is good thank you .
Toontown,3dlxgt,Robobot1747,5,Sat Jul 18 03:05:19 2015 UTC,Disney had this for about 3 days a few years back.  It didn't go well.

With small toons, when lure does work, you only want one cog unlured at the start of each round, which is what lure-left attack-right is all about.

However, we can't prove with facts that he is an actual troll and not somebody with non-up-to-par-english-and-social skills, so this is a case where I can't do anything (yet; until he breaks rules) unfortunately and you'll have to rely on downvoting to deal with him. I'll try to implement some sort of system where often-downvoted users will have more restrictions on making comments, and the old thread-posting karma requirement is still in effect and has been while I was gone."

There comes a point where trolling crosses into spamming and that is when action is taken, however other than that we suggest using the downvote function (which is what it is there for) and do not interact. I've been seeing people making replies to these people like ""dude get out of here you're such a troll"" and even making threads TELLING us to ban somebody. The first one is how you start more trolling and arguments from them, and the second is how you could get a short ban yourself. Please (please) mod-mail us for inquiries like that. Unfortunately at the moment it isn't really acceptable to ban trolls (or suspected trolls), as this is just downvote worthy, however once they start being insulting or spamming the subreddit (see: /u/DarkSkyKnight) is when it is time to step in.

Toontown,3dmyso,TheSpYro,2,Fri Jul 17 23:09:09 2015 UTC,I like this idea!
Toontown,3dmyso,Razors-Edge,-9,Sat Jul 18 04:20:26 2015 UTC,You stole my idea http://www.reddit.com/r/Toontown/comments/3dlgja/toontown_food/ct6ac9o
Toontown,3dmyso,Koalacards,7,Fri Jul 17 16:19:22 2015 UTC,"He may have not even seen your idea, and it's not really stealing, it's more of adding on if even related at all.  You complain about getting downvoted and hated, but then you do this sort of stuff which can be pushy and even offensive. I try to be fair to both sides, but you have been sort of rude lately."
Toontown,3dmyso,Razors-Edge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:23:15 2015 UTC,im  sorry i was just angry because people were bullying me so i thought this person using the same idea was trying to steal from me because he was trying to bully me . i guess hes not thanks . good luck and may your sound miss very little you were nice to me .

Toontown,3do6j5,DonCherrysSuitAMA,3,Fri Jul 17 22:52:58 2015 UTC,But salsa is a great dip and nice dance!

Toontown,3dok8j,OtakuSRL,5,Fri Jul 17 23:52:14 2015 UTC,Flairs are for toon names only. I might have to stick it in the official list again still but I said it two days ago...
Toontown,3dok8j,Peppersnoop,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:00:58 2015 UTC,"But what if I go to TTR and make a toon called ""Fix it pl0x?"" Not that it would happen, but theoretically."
Toontown,3dok8j,Peppersnoop,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:29:19 2015 UTC,Then the name probably wouldn't get approved.
Toontown,3do9bk,Michael_SK,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:01:35 2015 UTC,i have absolutely no reason to be here but hey why not
