I called the landlord (he pays the water bill), and he said he had no idea why it was turned off. They were tearing down the house next door, so I asked if they had hit a water main or something. It turns out they were worried about hitting a pipe so they had the water company turn off the water to my house, without contacting me or my landlord. The demolition was finished around 2pm, but despite multiple complaints the water company didn't send somebody to turn it back on until the following afternoon."

I have a 2007 Yaris. It's right around 1030/yearly. Definitely shop around. If I had to pay 2K a year for insurance... yeah... I wouldn't have insurance!

I've been through a lot of roundabouts in other places and the one on Smyrna is the absolute worst I've ever been through.  They couldn't have made it smaller if they tried and they couldn't have made it any bigger else they would literally be on people's front porches.   Hell, it's already in people's yards as it is.  I feel sorry for those poor folks who had a roundabout shoved in their faces like that.      It already can't handle the traffic it's got and once Cooper Chapel is finished and the South entrance of the roundabout is open it's going to be awful.  I wish they'd dig it up and do a regular intersection instead.      I understand roundabouts to be safer from a fatality standpoint but with a higher rate of accidents but this one was just poorly thought out, not the place for one."

And I'm not saying you need to be some lane jumping asshole either.  Don't be an ass. Don't be nice. Just be predictable.  The only time you need to be anything like nice, is if traffic is bumper to bumper, and then only for people making rights.  / honestly, just go right a bit, then turn around safely. every time someone tries to make a left through backed up traffic, they almost get hit. or do, though I haven't had to bear witness to that yet"

Louisville,3e1i71,ds580,2,Tue Jul 21 06:06:33 2015 UTC,"I've thought about doing something like this before, as well.  Here's a website where you can buy disused plots from the city for peanuts.  They're generally not very big but you can make them pretty productive, I think.  Right now there's a lot of junk on the website that I don't think really is listed but if you dig around there's a few legit one.  702 M Street is fairly close to campus.  Get $1,000 together and a few hundred for raised beds and equipment and you could get something going.  There are some even cheaper than that.   There's also the one at E. Ormsby by I-65 and one over by the dump at near Burnett at Meriwether and Hancock.    On the map plots of land are marked green with a red outline.  I'm not sure what the straight-up green ones are but they don't seem to be anything.  The yellowish ones are properties i.e. run-down houses."

Louisville,3e1i71,IndustryGiant,2,Tue Jul 21 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"I started a burrito business that quickly absorbed all my time.  But don't underestimate the value of your labor and, as cheesy as it sounds, the earth's bounty.  Even just renting a place with a big yard--since you're going to rent a place to live anyway--you could produce quite a bit.  Then if you wanted to expand and have a few satellite locations or whatever.  Work slowly and take advantage of what time you have on your hands."
Louisville,3dzuk2,corn_baller,4,Mon Jul 20 21:36:49 2015 UTC,Did you check to see if it was towed? Sometimes the owners of that parking lot have cars towed that don't belong to the residence or the cigar shop.

I was told I'd have to work 3rd shift if I wanted the job once I got there. 1st shift wasn't available. So I called and talked to the lady there that gave me the job. She apologize for the mistake. She said she talked to the liaison there and get it straightened out and I'd have 1st shift. I go back two days later and they had no idea I was coming back. I wasn't allowed in the building. A HR guy came out and talked to me and basically told me to leave as they didn't want me. Since I was unwilling to work the schedule given to me initially.  I call back and talked to the rep once more and she placed me with a different company, but it would only be for 3 days. I work the 3 days and was done with them or so I thought. Fast forward a month later I get a $4.78 bill from their payroll department stating they accidentally paid for a half hour lunch they shouldn't have. I called and explained I wasn't at fault for that since they didn't have me clock in or out for breaks. Just sign in and out at the start of the day. Their liaison was suppose to take off the 30 minutes for lunch. I was told not worry about it. I got a letter the next month I called back and talked to them again. Same thing don't worry about it. Then another month later I get a letter from a collection company for it. I get it's less than $5, but for the hassle I dealt with I shouldn't have to pay it.

Louisville,3dw5eo,justjoeoc,5,Mon Jul 20 02:57:46 2015 UTC,"I'm licensed in OH, but moved back to KY a few years ago. A lot of real estate offices have gone to a ""team"" model, which functions like a mini brokerage inside of a brokerage.  In the team setup, the team leader manages the listings (the easy job) as the sellers agent, and employs (and takes a piece of the commission from) buyers agents who do all the driving and showing homes for team listings and all other listings.   Even if this is the case you shouldn't be getting pushed off. I'd be glad to refer you to a good realtor I know if you need any help."
Louisville,3dw5eo,Randomsignupjunk,2,Mon Jul 20 03:19:07 2015 UTC,"This is probably what's going on here. We have a realtor we've been working with about possibly selling our current house: she's been super helpful in identifying the updates and repairs we need to make to get the house in the best shape possible. I just hate asking her to show me a house that we may not pursue. We are at a point where it may make more sense to stay where we are, solely to recoup all we've put in to fixing our current house (foundation issues, yay!). This other house just happens to be in a better location for schools for our kids."
Louisville,3dw5eo,Yoked_Joke,5,Mon Jul 20 11:52:11 2015 UTC,"This is odd. The way the sellers contracts are usually written, if there is no buyer's agent, the seller's agent gets the whole commission (minus the kick-up to the broker). You'd think the guy would be happy to make more money on the sale...  However, there are a lot of Realtors (R) out there who are very protectionist of their jobs - they don't like that people can buy and sell houses without them, so they try to make it as hard as possible on anyone not working with a Realtor (R). Not to say they are all like this, but there is a sizable group."

Every apartment has a laundry/storage room too and you can rent a washer and dryer if you don't have one. It's real close to Jeffersontown"
Louisville,3du4mv,zai614,3,Sun Jul 19 14:48:27 2015 UTC,What's your price range? I'm moving this month and the place I'm currently in should be available august 1. Kinda pricy though. In the St Matthews/crescent Hill area
Louisville,3du4mv,wongo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:29:27 2015 UTC,We're trying to stay below $1000 for everything. Preferably $800ish. It's me and my girlfriend by the way.

They're always advertising leasing specials. My total rent is about $746, but I think I was grandfathered into a nicer payment. Includes water and trash. I think it's closer to $800 for new sign ups. Chestnut Ridge out in jtown. I think they're pretty nice apartments."

Louisville,3du4mv,jennthemermaid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:22:08 2015 UTC,oh really? I'm kind of surprised. They had rent special signs out for a while. I guess that makes sense; a lot of people move in this time for school.

They also pick up."
Louisville,3dswwe,canusa5,13,Sun Jul 19 03:36:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's pretty common for that parking lot. They have always been pretty good about having a security guard there that will tell you you're probably going to get towed if you aren't actually going into Walgreens, although maybe he doesn't work all the time. And, there are plenty of signs up that warn you that your car will be towed."
Louisville,3dswwe,louiskycards,4,Sun Jul 19 04:07:33 2015 UTC,"In my three years living in the area, today was the first time I witnessed them enforcing the signs to the extent of multiple towtrucks. It seemed out of the ordinary"

Plus, like I said, it's hard to miss the signs that say you'll be towed etc, etc. But, I'm sure a lot of people just wanna go have fun & accidentally miss the parking signs, which is understandable."

Louisville,3dswwe,0hn0N0tHerAgain,2,Sun Jul 19 14:41:46 2015 UTC,Indeed. I lived across the street from 2008-2010 and cars were towed on really busy nights.  There was usually a security guard warning people but I rarely go down there anymore to confirm if this still happens.
Louisville,3dswwe,thankyouforcallingin,19,Sun Jul 19 19:49:22 2015 UTC,"Also, it's really upsetting when your child is sick at home and you're trying to get to Walgreen's to grab some medicine and the parking lot is full of cars that aren't in the store so you have to drive around for 15 minutes waiting for someone to move before you give up and have to drive even further to another store."

Louisville,3dswwe,shuddleston919,8,Tue Jul 21 19:59:58 2015 UTC,That walgreen's has been in that location for decades. I don't see how it's ruined anything. The pic-pac there before was a blight.
Louisville,3dswwe,the_woot_shoot,5,Sun Jul 19 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"I've parked in that lot countless times after 10pm or so and never had a problem.

I just park on the street now, its not worth it."

Hope Louisville catches on to this advice quick.   This shouldn't be advice. Especially in the highlands. That's how every place is in the highlands is. Even if they are a business that closes at noon and you want to go to a bar at midnight they still won't allow you parking on their property if they see you doing it.  Hence the signs.

Find the ones that have been broken (hot water is required), reference them in a certified letter to your landlord's address. Tell them you intend to break the lease according to 'xyz' KRS statute, give them the proscribed amount of time to fix it, and then send them a final certified letter once you move.  If they sue you, bring your documentation to court. If they send you to collections, send the collector the documentation. If it shows up on your credit report, dispute it with your documentation."

Louisville,3dr9u5,Clonskeagh,5,Sat Jul 18 19:39:20 2015 UTC,"If arguing a constructive eviction or other violations of landlord-tenant law isn't successful, finding a new tenant for the apartment will limit the damages you owe for breaking the lease. If they can't rent the apartment for the remainder of the lease period, you would technically owe all of what you would have paid under the lease. But if they find a new tenant right away, then they can't double-dip so to speak and collect both from you and the new tenant. The new tenant would essentially forgive your debt to the landlord. I don't know your income level or if you'd qualify for services, but Legal Aid Society of Louisville does a lot of landlord-tenant work."

Louisville,3dqwuk,satansheat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:23:13 2015 UTC,You can do this but probably not legally. I have driven drunk people home in the highlands before and they paid me. I also once had a drunk guy give me 10 bucks to take him to the backdoor. This all happen outside value market at mid city. So essentially he gave me 10 bucks to walk him through mid city mall and to the backdoor. I was in high school at the time so I couldn't even go in.   Also just to make clear I never ask for money. These people offered it. One time me and a friend did take a nurse and her boyfriend home and they didn't pay. All she did was tell us how bad drugs are the entire drive. Then once dropping them off they had trouble opening the the door.   But in all honesty I don't recommend this. I have lived in the highlands my whole life and everyone I have given a ride we talked first or we realized we knew some of the same people (the nurse and boyfriend sat at our table at papalinos. So we got to know each other. The other group I knew one of the people's little cousins. Then the guy trying to find the backdoor I had know idea who he was. But the backdoor was so close I felt safe about it.)

Basically some very busy people have more things they aren't looking at so we can say they are monitored 24/7. Everything is recorded so if something does happen it will be on video. The point of the cameras isn't to catch one guy mugging someone, its to notice 100+ young kids acting foolish mobbing gas stations and mugging random people."

When we tried contacting USPS, we got the runaround (telling us to call a different branch, when we called that branch they said they didn't deliver to us, called the first branch to speak with the branch manager and was told he would call us back and never heard back from him even after we called again numerous times). I was more frustrated with their apparent apathy than the fact that the packages were missing in the first place."
Louisville,3dmj9f,evantheterrible,3,Fri Jul 17 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"since the end of 2012, usps has lost 470+ packages (cardboard envelopes, small merchandise) that we send out at my work. never been offered any means of recourse. we just chalk it up to the level of commitment to service excellence by government employees--and subsequently take a hit every time."

Louisville,3dmj9f,BirdPecker,2,Fri Jul 17 15:24:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it varies, but I've been having lots of issues with our mailman lately.   I've had three packages in the last two weeks end up in the wrong mailbox. Two of them were neighbors packages in my mailbox. One of them was my package in another person's mailbox. I got somebody else's electric bill a few weeks ago too.   I've been reluctant to complain to the post office. The guy seems really friendly. But, I wish whatever would need to be done to fix the situation would happen. I hate having to be paranoid that my packages aren't going to show up.   I saw a suggestion on another site to label the inside of your mailbox if you live in an apartment complex. I know this doesn't help OP, but might be a good tip for anybody in a similar situation as mine."
Louisville,3dmj9f,Bearninja36,2,Fri Jul 17 19:01:32 2015 UTC,I complained to our post office after a neighbor received (and opened) some very financially sensitive mail.   It was the last straw after many many many screw ups.   It's been three weeks since then and so far no misdelivered mail.
Louisville,3dmj9f,belethors_sister,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:49:18 2015 UTC,Hopefully you said something to your neighbor too.
Louisville,3dmj9f,natelyswhore22,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"I used to work at a place that received a lot of mail daily. We'd get a lot of misdelivered mail, mostly letters though. But sometimes we'd get letters that didn't resemble our address at all and even a few times letters that were addressed to different states. It seems unlikely that every single package would be misdelivered if you are getting your regular letters.  Ask your neighbors if they are having the same issue. If so, it's more likely theft.   If packages were delivered using priority mail, it automatically comes with $50 insurance so you can at least claim the amount the item was worth."
Louisville,3dmj9f,dawnofthemichael,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:44:22 2015 UTC,"Used to live on 3rd and hill in Old Louisville and had about 200 packages delivered successfully and about another 200 get picked up from my doorstep successfully.  I had 1 package get stolen that was delivered, and I had about $100 worth of 6 packages get stolen once from my doorstep.  More recently, I moved nearby the Louisville Zoo and I had a large desk and photography equipment delivered but it wasn't actually on my doorstep. Somehow it magically appeared 2 days later, and my theory is that it was delivered to a street nearby with the same address number, and the neighbor was cool and drove it over to my doorstep on a Sunday night."

Louisville,3dmj9f,sc37,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:25:53 2015 UTC,Contact the Office of the Inspector General with USPS. I had two Blu-Ray players go missing during the holidays and figured someone was snatching them from our common entrance. They were able to dig around and found that the shipping company actually had been screwing up my address on the labels.
Louisville,3dmj9f,jt_hans,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:45:55 2015 UTC,"Paid a crap ton of money to get some textbooks delivered a few weeks ago in two days (Now, I realize that's a special request, but it's not like it's one day), so I could have them before I left home for 2 weeks. Needed to study them so I could work on a project at work when I got back. They sent me an email saying they attempted to deliver a package and that they left a slip. Alright I'll just go pick it up personally. Got home, there was no slip whatsoever, and neither of our neighbors had any mail. Called to see if I could pick it up, they said I couldn't because it was still on the truck, and to pick it up tomorrow. Wasn't ideal as I was leaving, but I asked if they were open then and said okay. Show up at the post office the next day? They're not open on Sundays.  So, TL;DR, USPS sucks."
Louisville,3dmj9f,belethors_sister,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:58:51 2015 UTC,10 years ago I moved back to the U.S. and shipped some items I couldn't fit in my suitcase. No surprises the package went missing. The Danish post service was very swift to respond and sent 5 inquires over three months and the USPS never once responded.   Much like you I had sentimental items in there I didn't want stolen while they were in my suitcase. Probably would have been safer had I put them in there.   I guess all you can do is keep pestering them and maybe small claims court?
Louisville,3dmj9f,Kunstwaffen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. We have had quite a few big packages from Amazon come in and sit there for longish periods of time and never once got stolen. But then I have had two packages that said they were delivered and never showed up on my doorstep. I called the local post office the last time and they said it was just sitting in the back (St. Matthews, I live near Willis Ave.). I hope that's the case with this package because I ordered a replacement HD fro my laptop which I need badly before everything hits the fan. Terrible terrible. We've had them deliver mail to the wrong address, and also missed a birthday card which disappeared into nothingness."
Louisville,3dmj9f,DrQuantum,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:24:35 2015 UTC,"USPS is consistent Delivery, which makes it much easier to find and steal packages. You're saying this has happened more than once? I highly doubt the post office would make that many mistakes in their system. It could be that they are delivering to the wrong place. Have you asked your neighbors?   In any case, have you tried to contact the post master? You can contact him here, its his responsibility to make sure problems like this are resolved.   Stephen.L.Kirkland@usps.gov T (502) 454-1837"
Louisville,3dmj9f,cubedeathk,-5,Fri Jul 17 14:30:10 2015 UTC,How in the world can the post office afford paid Internet shills?
Louisville,3dmj9f,DrQuantum,4,Fri Jul 17 14:40:48 2015 UTC,"They don't need to pay me since they are the only ones to get my packages where they need to be on time with no issues and much cheaper. Its nice knowing that my postman comes the same time every day and doesn't leave a crappy note of when he is most certainly not going to deliver the package.   Secondly, it would be pretty hard for anyone to afford much when by law you have to have cash on hand for 75 years in advance Pensions."
Louisville,3dmj9f,cubedeathk,-12,Fri Jul 17 14:56:36 2015 UTC,Wow the cognitive dissonance between being anti-APWU and pro-public mail  must be astounding. I guess if you pay a man he will say even the most unbelievable shit.  Get off my sub shitbag.

Seeing if the packages make it or not and if the staff at the post office are efficient and friendly.  Makes you wonder how they can afford to pay people like me. They also reimburse me for the boxes I have to buy.  It's a fun gig though.  What varies a lot are the mail men. Definitely a hit or miss but if you get a decent mail man it will make all the difference. I've shipped and received many packages and if I had to rate the big three [when it comes to deliveries] it would go 1.USPS, 2.FedEx, 3.UPS. Don't know if I've gotten lucky or not but USPS has never failed me plus the mail man comes around the same time everyday so I know when I'm gonna get my package.  With the other two you usually get a delivery window that can span up to twelve hours."
Louisville,3dn0zz,AndrewWaldron,3,Fri Jul 17 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"Are there only a handful of gas stations in Fern Creek?    From what I've read sometimes gas stations will use zone pricing, which basically will raise all prices of gas stations in the surrounding area, in order for them to be able to compete with each other.  If there are only a few gas stations, with the same owner/supplier, this could explain why it is cheaper.  Perhaps it is much cheaper for stations to operate in Fern Creek?  If they have lower rent/land/operating costs it could contribute to those prices being cheaper in those areas.  Either way, fill up there!"
Louisville,3dn0zz,tswpoker1,3,Fri Jul 17 19:59:47 2015 UTC,"I moved to Fern Creek in February,  and I've noticed this too. It also seems that if there is a big spike in prices, the Fern Creek stations will be a day or so behind in raising their prices, but they will go back down when everyone else does. I don't really know why it's cheaper along that stretch of Bardstown Rd, but I'm certainly not upset about it either."

If your friend had evidence that the area surrounding his home was prone to flash flooding, then at the end of the day, it's on him for buying the house.

Louisville,3dk1cn,kittenbutter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:03:33 2015 UTC,"So I learned this from my lawyer friends tonight:  Kentucky Statute 431.510 This 1976 statute totally abolished bail bonding for profit. Individuals interested in pursuing careers as bail bond agents or bounty hunters cannot do so in the state of Kentucky. Licensed bounty hunters who are tracking fugitives from another state cannot arrest them in Kentucky without taking a chance they’ll be arrested themselves. A bounty hunter or bondsman from another state CAN go before a Kentucky judge to request a fugitive’s arrest warrant. If the judge is convinced that an arrest is justified, a warrant will be issued; however, the arrest can only be carried out by a Kentucky peace officer, not by the out-of-state bounty hunter or bondsman. The fugitive is then delivered to the court that issued the bail or remanded into the bounty hunter’s custody for transportation to the original jail. sauce  Now I kinda wish I had filmed what we saw..."

Sister Sparrow played Thursday too at Against The Grain downtown(they've been better than expected every time I've seen them).

The ones I'm not missing...

Louisville,3djp3x,RotaryJihad,2,Thu Jul 16 22:41:28 2015 UTC,"I meant to post this story to Reddit/Louisville when it happened but I just got lazy.... My father's vehicles were both stolen from his garage/driveway during the same night about a month ago.  We live on a very secluded hill near Iroquois Park, on 8 acres, with one looped driveway leading in and out, and we have lived here for over 30+ years without any issues.   He did leave his automatic keys inside his briefcase in his vehicle making it an easy steal (but we always felt safe on our fenced/gated property)...... luckily, BMW was able to track the location of his vehicle and send it to the police----his car was recovered about an hour after he noticed it missing in Gardiner Lane Shopping Center with 4 THIRTEEN-FOURTEEN year old boys, all races/nationalities equally represented, according to my father. The keys to his other truck, a Honda Ridgeline, were inside his briefcase which had since been removed from the vehicle.  The police and my father were able to coerce these juveniles to tell them where they took his briefcase, which ended up being in a vacant house off S 3rd Street, along with lots of other stolen property, but the keys to his Honda truck were still missing.   Well, in the midst of all this, whoever had possession of the Honda keys came back and stole that Honda.  We got a phonecall early in the morning the next day from a man out in Hillview who thinks he found the contents of someone's glovebox (the BMW) which was dumped in his yard. This neighborhood watchman saved the day. My dad told him about the Honda truck and this older man ID'd the color of the vehicle and told my dad he had seen it cruising through his neighborhood moments ago, full of mexican kids. (I am quoting the characters in this story verbatim---don't give me any racist stuff, these were correct descriptions)  SOOOO, my dad, who is kinda crazy-----goes out to this Hillview neighborhood and starts stalking the streets. He actually got a ticket from some Barney Fife Hillview cop for rolling through a stop sign (fucker).........He was there all day, almost gave up and left, when his Honda drove right past him. Neighborhood high speed chase ensues, they pull into a church yard and get out on foot, my dad got out and caught the fat one. He sat on him while police came, he was on the phone with 911 the entire time this was playing out. My father was really happy when the chief of Hillview police showed up, so that he could verbally berate the officer who ticketed him earlier for the stop sign violation. My dad seemed pretty pleased with his choice of words shared with that officer in front of his chief.   Long story short, both cars recovered... the Honda had the GPS ripped out of it and soda pop spilled everywhere, and they left box of smoke bombs.  They were KIDS, however surely working for someone else.....  OH, and my dad went to court and had that ticket dismissed.   Apparently, our neighborhood was cased that night----many houses on the street had their cars broken into, Garmins stolen. etc.  Don't gimme this Southend bull, there is more wealth hidden in the Southend than you could even dream about----we just don't have mortgages like y'all out in the Eastend.   My mom's favorite joke:  What do people in the Eastend call people in the Southend?....... Mom and Dad."
Louisville,3djp3x,mo_weasel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:30:38 2015 UTC,we just don't have mortgages like y'all out in the Eastend   Or corresponding property values to match all that wealth.

I can do it a jeep column in literally 5 seconds with #3 flat head, a hammer and #1 flat head to turn the cylinder. 5 seconds. thanks a ton chrysler. Hondas of that generation though are much more difficult to steal and drive away."

You have to walk to the Second Street Bridge, or the Big Four (walking) bridge but that's probably longer. It's fine if you've got the time, but it's also gonna be pretty hot all weekend, like mid-90s, so keep that in mind.   And Uber and Lyft are both prevalent around here."

After determining that wasn't going to keep me here, I had a lot of planning to do.  You see, I don't fly.  So for me to come out there and do my research, it requires a lot of planning and a lot of driving.  So just to be out there for six days, required two weeks of travel and time off. Throw in normal life set backs and considering I'm older and take my decisions more seriously, well there ya go."
