poledancing,3e3xc5,girl-replica,2,Tue Jul 21 20:33:25 2015 UTC,"AMAZING WORK!  Really incredible achievement.  I'm impressed and inspired.  What was your training process?  I've been working towards cup grip lifts for many months now and I'm feeling stalled.  I can hang for quite a while, actively pulling away from the pole, and my (crappy) iron-x has recently started connecting (coming down, not up).  I just cannot for the life of me lift my knees properly from the hang.  I always end up twisting out of position when I try.  Do you have any wisdom?"
poledancing,3e3xc5,girl-replica,2,Tue Jul 21 20:32:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you :D I haven't tried iron X yet. I might start working on it.  My TG deadlift was the next thing on from finally nailing my handspring and being able to do a few things in that position. I spent a long time trying to get a decent TG hang, which wasn't really happening. I saw a few suggestions to try it with the pole on spinning to get a bit of momentum behind it. And I was aiming for a move that we call matrix, but I can't really find anywhere under that name, expect for this one video where it was spinning rather than held. Looks like this.  I started off facing away from the pole and kicking up into the lift, then working towards actually deadlifting my legs.  I watched quite a lot of tutorials and found this one and this one really useful.  I also think that something which was holding me back was that I have a lot of bicep muscle but not a lot of tricep muscle, so I worked on strengthening my triceps as well.  Just keep trying it, but remember to warm up your shoulder muscles (as in that second tutorial) and don't do too many attempts in one go! I ruined my left shoulder for about three weeks getting carried away with TG deadlifts! Good luck with it :D"

poledancing,3dx19x,LydiaJaybird,7,Mon Jul 20 06:15:25 2015 UTC,"I'd quit temporarily and nab a home pole, it will serve you equally well since you could then practice stuff you learn when you inevitably go back for classes later.   Maybe you can set up something with your instructor to help clean up the studio in return for one class per week.  There are youtube videos on how to set up a pole and use a stud finder. In the long run this pays off, you keep poling/learning and eventually your instructor gets a student back."
poledancing,3dx19x,Wildernessinabox,4,Mon Jul 20 06:48:08 2015 UTC,In my opinion I would get a pole for home. Unemployment/underemployment has a nasty habit of dragging out longer than you anticipate. You seem to be on close terms with your instructor so I'm sure that they would be sympathetic to this.  I would just explain the situation to her and that you are intending on returning but if money stays this tight you would possibly have to stop all together for longer.   There is also a long term upside to buying a pole for at home too because once you've got the cash flow for classes again you will be able to practice more in between them.   Once again this is just my opinion and someone else might have a better idea but I hope it helps :)
poledancing,3dx19x,rocketcollecting,2,Mon Jul 20 06:52:17 2015 UTC,How much are you gaining from classes? If you aren't actively learning skills in class that you couldn't learn at home then go with the home pole for now.

poledancing,3dx19x,Mansinthe,2,Tue Jul 21 05:36:39 2015 UTC,"I also bought my own pole (after six months of been taught by a friend) and coming along since then fine. Sometimes it's a bit lonely to practice on my own, but then some friends join me. I'm learning with YouTube and Cleo The Hurricane DVDs. So if you're really scared you could lose to live that passion, you should by your own pole."
poledancing,3dx19x,angelagabbie,2,Mon Jul 20 14:28:02 2015 UTC,"If you really want to continue pole and are worried about expenses, then get the pole!! And if you end up getting hired sooner, you'll be able to have a pole at home to practice the moves you did in class, especially if you're only going 1/week.  As for your pole teacher, having to stop going to classes bc of finances is a very common dilemma for lots of students. I'm sure she'll understand and will still be willing to help you set up your pole. If you're worried about hurting her feelings, take her out for drinks or a fun meal as repayment and just assure her that you'll be back in her classes as soon as you find employment :)"
poledancing,3dx19x,angelagabbie,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:04 2015 UTC,"Also, if you get the X-Pole, it's a really easy pole to set up. When I first got my pole, I just followed the youtube vid and was able to set it up by myself in less than an hour (I'm a really small person too if that helps!) - the most difficult part is finding a ceiling joist, but you can do that yourself or get any handyman w/ a stud finder to do that for you."

Otherwise, I actually tend to use pillows and blankets as a ""crash pad"". I'll toss a blanket down on the floor so nothing slips, put a few layers of nice, thick pillows, and top it with another blanket to keep everything all together. I absolutely don't use this in lieu of a spotter or an actual crash pad, but sometimes it's nice to have beneath be even if I'm just working on a move I can do 99% of the time but I'm not 100% solid on yet."

If you are concerned about them falling off, you can try very large fishnets instead (like this, but even larger if you can find them), but you'll probably have to wear heels with them, or find a footless pair.

I find that the people who do hurt themselves are ones who don't build up the strength/core and just continuously rely on using a lot of momentum kicking up to compensate for their lack of strength - that's what I did! It's also just good practice to lift vs. kicking up since it'll make it easier to start doing aerial inverts. There's no ground to kick from when you're up on the pole :)

poledancing,3dgi8e,ssombraa,7,Thu Jul 16 02:18:15 2015 UTC,"Your body doesn't seem to comfortable with that position yet, even before you try to release your legs. Your shoulders should be on one level, head straight down and the pole should run along the middle of your body. In your attempts your body seems to tilt sideways, because your basic instinct is to get the head out of harm's way in a position where your body doesn't trust itself to hold it.  I'd scale back a bit and work on butterfly first. Try to get a solid, far from the pole butterfly, where you feel comfortable moving the legs around while your body remains totally vertical. If you lack the strength, it will help you build it.  After you are comfortable with the butterfly, work on extended butterfly, which force you to shift the center of your gravity further out and build more strength and confidence in that position.  Next, work on inverted D. Go into the butterfly, return the leg back without lowering yourself closer to the pole. Extend both legs and slowly start to push your butt away from the pole while the legs remain straight and together, and the pole between them. Catch the pole between the ankles.  After you are fine with the inverted D, you are probably strong enough for the Ayesha, and your body is familiar with the proper alignment so it won't tilt and hold the balance better. From Inverted D, slowly release the pole with both legs at the same time. Finding the balance might take some time, but once you feel secure enough you can get into a full straddle and enjoy your victory.  Good luck!"

poledancing,3dgi8e,_Bia,3,Fri Jul 17 05:52:45 2015 UTC,"Try letting your hands go, into a crucifix, then pushing up.  This will help you straighten out, then place your arms.  Once you feel straight and balanced here, lower your knees until at your chest, still gripping the pole.  Get your feet in front and gradually get your legs to the side.  Focus on your core and notice if you're leaning to one side: that's the oblique you need to strengthen."

This might be a hip and leg flexibility issue. If so, doing pancake stretches might help (sit with legs spread as wide as you can, reach arms forward and bring chest down toward the floor).   Also when I was first learning Ayesha I found it felt more stable to have my head tucked against my arm, although I don't always do that now."

Posting on here is smart- you should also look into studio veena. I tried shopping for used xpoles for quite a while before I just bit the bullet and got one brand new- I didn't want to risk a fake and get myself hurt wile using it.  In my opinion, unless you're buying directly from a friend you really trust, this is the one place where it is REALLY worth it to splurge."

A lot of fake/impersonator X-Poles end up on ebay and the best way to figure out if it's real is just to compare pictures, looking at the shape of the top base will make it pretty obvious.  Another thing to look out for is old (pre-2014 I think?) vs. new model of XPole. From what I hear it's a huge pain taking apart and assembling the old version since it's top-loading. I have the new model and it's a breeeeeze! I'm 5'1 and assembled my 9-foot pole by myself in 45min the very first time.  There are also facebook groups like Pole Dance Garage Sale where people sell their used pole-related things, though I notice that most of the members are international but it's worth a shot looking :)  In the meantime of not having a pole, I highly suggest a doorway pull-up bar ($20-25) for building strength.  Last thing! Other pole brands are Lil Mynx, Pole Danzer, & Lupit. I honestly don't know anything about their quality/pricing, but a blog post from Bad Kitty and another reputable pole blog have mentioned them as alternatives."

Also, learning to engage your larger back muscles instead of relying on small forearm muscles will help you.  If that's a tough thing, you might want to looking into working out at a gym.  I taught myself everything I needed, but you might want to learn from a friend who lifts or from a personal trainer.  Basically, learning to do a strict pull-up without pain will be the key (so lat strength, biceps, rhomboids, and stability/opposing muscles).  Even if your strength doesn't improve a ton in a short time, you will know how to engage the right muscles by practicing isolating them.  For me, the mental image that helped was ""pull elbows INWARD, not downward, as you pull yourself up.""    Disclaimer: if your pain is from things like flying body spirals, I'm not sure if my advice will help since that's not the problem I had.    Best of luck, fellow poler!  Edit:  stretching helped, too, but I found the root of the problem was muscular strength, appropriate muscular engagement, and muscular balance."

So it's not like 45 is good for strengthening, it's just it takes more strength to perform the same trick.  If you are thinking about competing then you'll probably need a 45 to train on.

I've found it helpful to already have my core engaged (kinda almost ""bearing down"") before I try to get my hips up.

poledancing,3czv2k,targar1,7,Sun Jul 12 07:51:37 2015 UTC,"Dry hands does not help grip, it just stops your hands from sweating. If your hands didn't sweat in the first place it could make them grip less because dry skin doesn't grip well. Also the colder the pole, the less grippy it is. Keep your pole warm, use dry hands only for sweating, use oil free moisturizer on you body if you skin is dry and maybe get a grip enhancer like Mighty Grip or iTac for your hands."

If you don't have a pole at home, you can do them on a pull-up bar too. On the pull-up bar, I like to tuck, tip back, and hold it for a few seconds. On the pole at class you can stand in the invert position and either do one controlled knee tuck at a time and hold it, or you can try to do as many as you can in a row without touching the floor. As for grip, I can't stick at all if I'm cold. I like to throw on some music and dance until my heart rate is up and I'm warm."

Once you have those down and can hold your knees up, tilt your head back and straighten your arms, taking you upside down. I teach to NEVER kick into an invert: keep practicing crunches until you can take that crunch into an inversion. Practice with froggy legs first, then you can extend. Make sure your crotch is right up against the pole to ensure your butt doesn't pull you back down. Good luck!"

I was taught to go upside down from standing, taking one step and using momentum to flip myself but I would like to use more of my own upper body and core strength as I know more advanced moves require that!  What other core exercises would also improve core strength other than pole crunches?"
poledancing,3czv2k,kcbrush,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:05:32 2015 UTC,"I also like doing shoulder mounts from the floor: lie flat on the floor with a shoulder against the pole (always good to switch off sides) and your hands cupped on the back of the pole. Try to keep your legs straight and lift them all the way up, bringing your butt with you and candlestick straight up so your whole body is parallel to the pole. Then you can lower back down, slowly rolling through your back to your butt, then lower your legs slowly. Usually the lowering part of any move, including pole crunches, is the hardest part if you control it. Hope that helps!"

I'm doing pole crunches and loads of sit ups and also some free weights. As for slipping, I've also found that if the pole is cold, I'm much more slippery. Try do a pole warmup where you are just walking around the pole and doing basic moves like hip swivels and body waves with your hands on the pole. I do that for a few minutes and the pole is normally warmed up after that."

poledancing,3cuw8x,HobbitGirl91,7,Fri Jul 10 23:44:07 2015 UTC,"I got my own pole after about a year. I was inverting easily, had many intermediate moves under my belt and just got my TG Ayesha. I was feeling confident being upside down, being off the ground and training without a spotter. Note that I wasn't pressured to start home training, I actually didn't pole at home much because the studio schedule filled up my week nicely, and I still felt safer to train in the studio rather than home.  Poling at home won't be the same experience as it is in your studio currently for several reasons. You don't feel safe enough, even if you did develop good saving instincts and enough strength. It's also harder to come up with your own training and push yourself as much as an instructor would. Lastly, you don't get the same support and mental reinforcement like you do when you train with others, and either you or somebody else succeeds, you are quite on your own there.  I'm not sure what level are you, but first and foremost you need to be able to train alone and not relay on spotting. You also need to know which moves are appropriate to your level and not rush to advanced moves. That said, you could always train dance, flow and floorwork at home and get your ""serious"" practice at the studio (I hope they will still have some classes!)."

But they only offer one beginners' class that fits into my work schedule, and that is the one that they have been cancelling a lot lately. I know that at the start of summer, there was talk of putting that class on hiatus until the school year started back up, depending on attendance. So if they decide to drop that class, and I can't attend any of their others, my only other option would be to look at getting my own pole (shy of dropping it altogether until they start that class back up). If I did that, I think I would still try to work in at least one class per month or something, so that I could touch base with instructors and make sure my form and technique aren't lapsing.

My strengthening includes all kinds of hansprings, deadlift training, shoulder mount deadlift, brass monkey press up and handstand press ups. See how this is probably not helpful to you at all? It's because your current strength training is determined by what you can already do and what are your next set of goals.  I second the suggestion to write down everything you work on in class. It's really great to reinforce what you learned with additional practice, and it also suits your level. If you have your own goal which is not being taught in class, you can add working for that.   Also, adding more training is awesome, especially if you fee like 1 hour a week is not enough. But remember that your muscles need rest days to heal and get stronger. So don't try to fill up your entire week all of a sudden. Gradually work your way up from 2 days, to back-to-back classes, to 3 days etc. I find that I can't squeeze more than 2-3 days of pole training a week, but I do tend to make it at least 2 hours each day I train."

I know one instructor that does a step around to a back arch/bend to a fan kick 5times on each side As a way to warm up the pole and your body. I thought that was pretty fun.  I usually warm up with a free dance and don't allow my feet to leave the floor for more than 3 sec.  I typically to a stretch routine that goes arms-shoulders-wrists, back and hips then legs and feet then straddle conditioning.  The actual specific moves vary from day to day but I always follow that structure of warm up before practicing.  Arms almost always include the grab the elbow behind your-head-move and back always includes cat-cow  and cobra, legs always include runners lunges and pidgeon."

poledancing,3csdy3,yumdonuts,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:42:53 2015 UTC,"I had to stop training for 3 months before. It's a little hard at the beginning, because you mind thinks you can do these moves, but your body just can't. You lose strength, but you also regain it much faster.   If you can shoulder injuries, I actually think it's good you had a forced time off. It's better to let it heal rather than keep agitating it. When I'm on forced time outs like this I'm partially grateful because it might let my shoulder soften and heal.  For me 2 weeks seems like not an issue. Don't overthink it, you'll be fine."
poledancing,3csdy3,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:01:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much. I've taken as long as 6 months off before - currently I'm looking at almost a year by the time my doctor gives me the okay - and I always get back to where I was before within a couple of weeks. (Though, for me, it's more of an issue of rebuilding stamina, which can take me a couple months.) This time might be different, but I plan to be a little more gentle with myself. I'm currently 37 weeks pregnant so I probably won't be allowed back on the pole until September.  TBH, since you're a relative newbie, your initial progress is MOSTLY your body learning to use your muscles in a certain way; you're not really building that much strength and flexibility just yet so there isn't much to lose. It's more about your body learning how to efficiently get into a move, and what sequence of muscles to activate. So I'm pretty sure with your relatively short break, you'll be able to pick up right where you left off!"
poledancing,3csdy3,wheezycat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:16:44 2015 UTC,"When I first started, I had to take a three month break for a business trip. Prior to my trip, I had been poling for about 3-4 months (about 2x/week) and was just starting to learn how to invert with a little jump and was getting the hang of flinging my body around the pole in reverse grab.  When I got back from my 3-month trip, I could still invert but needed way more momentum and my arm/shoulder could barely support a reverse grab. This was after THREE MONTHS - so I think a couple weeks should be okay for you.  If you're really concerned about losing progress, work in some stretching or quick abs & shoulder work-outs whenever you can. Do a plank and in the plank position, do shoulder shrugs. Bust out a few leg lifts or toe touches while you're watching Netflix. :)  Additionally, I found that it was pretty easy to get my strength back as I already knew what I had to do in order to build it and I also had that psychological benefit of already knowing that I'm capable of reaching that level of strength."

If you are kicking, please stop (& read this article!). I was a beginner when I was first taught to invert and constantly kicking into it strained my side a lot (the side touching the pole).  In either case of kicking up into inverts or controlled lifting, always consult a doctor if it's weird/unusual to you. Remember, you know your body best :)"
poledancing,3clixg,angelagabbie,3,Wed Jul 8 23:23:34 2015 UTC,"It's probably because you're not engaging your back when you go into your inversion as much as you should. I had the same problem and it took months for it to get better because I was stupid, refused to go to a doctor, and thought I could fix it myself with a couple ice packs and some advil. It's actually a pretty common injury though. Just about everyone I know has experienced this pain at some point or another. Part of it is just strength building but also make sure your form is correct. Try doing scapula stabilizing exercises and work on engaging your lats before to invert. Don't push too hard. If it's seriously bothering you, go to a (sports) doctor."
poledancing,3clixg,lovetheaftertaste,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:11:32 2015 UTC,It just bothers me the day of practice and the day after for the time being. I'll just make sure to stop inverting until I can just do it with strength.
poledancing,3clixg,missmichellepole,2,Thu Jul 9 14:07:24 2015 UTC,"First, head to the doctor (sports focus if you can) if you're having pain outside of when you're at pole. It's a sign of more permanent damage.   My guess is that you're hanging on the pole and then rotating on that hang instead of using muscle to stabilize your upper body and pulling your bum up. Can you hold a hang on the side of the pole for more than five seconds? ( like this: https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQLBo1U3HEHRQDjxKu1woVkYGrQPNKptqt_yGHkNBeoaY9v82yIDQ ) You may need a bit more strength before going upside down."

Make sure you aren't training for too long at a time especially if you weren't super physically active before you started pole.   I would definitely do the exercises missmichellepole suggests. And stretches everyday; I do at least 15 min of stretching for shoulders wrists and hips and have noticed a significant decrease in shoulder strains and wrist pain in the last few months.

Your head is in front of the pole instead of having the pole sit against your trap with your face towards the floor.  Your butt is maybe touching the pole?  I can't quite tell if that's true.

Unless specifically stated and provided, a pole is not designed to have anything in between it and the floor, and putting something there (even ""non stick"") is a falling risk.

I'm not worried about the pole moving on the floor, more concerned about it causing damage to the wood (since we're renting).

poledancing,3cgb98,purple_potatoes,2,Sat Jul 11 17:13:13 2015 UTC,"There is already rubber on the bottom of the pole. The pole will not damage the flooring.

Mine is about 5-10cm from hitting the ceiling.  The wobble is easy to get use to as its only apparent when you're near the top. The x pole lite does have stabilizers but I never use them as I have limited floor space in my bedroom and would trip over them.  The studio I go to for lessons uses a 45 brass pole where as my pole at home is a 50 stainless steel. I'm not so sure what poles they offer but at the time.

When the absolute lowest it gets here is 4 deg (at night.) I layer up looking like a marshmallow and still shiver :(  Im sorry you have to be uncomfortable thanks to the love of the sport!

poledancing,3c483b,melodyjknight,2,Sat Jul 4 23:19:38 2015 UTC,yes i did in the beginning. It took me about 6 months for me to stop bruising so much. I still get bruises after a long session but not as bad. Make sure you let them heal and work both sides as evenly as you can. It should reduce over time but some moves will cause more bruising than others of course.
poledancing,3c483b,lilfunky1,2,Sat Jul 4 23:47:55 2015 UTC,"As someone else's has said, it's partly because you have lighter skin so bruises show more easily.   However, and especially if you find you bleed easily in other ways (heavy periods, bleeding gums), it may be worth being checked out by a doctor just in case there is something you can fix.  Oh and when your muscles ache? Avoid aspirin as it increases bleeding."
poledancing,3c483b,daladoir,2,Sun Jul 5 12:25:01 2015 UTC,"When I first increased the amount of poling I was doing (from 2 days a week up to 5) I bruised like that, perhaps worse.  At some points I had more bruised than unbruised skin on my legs.  I looked like a bruise cheetah for a while.  It has gotten better over time.  I still get a bruise here or there but not quite so bad any more. Thankfully it was winter so I could just wear tights or long skirts all the time and didn't have to deal with the concerned looks from strangers or weird questions at a new job. Honestly I have a ton of pictures of bruises on my phone.  When I get a really good one, or a lot I take pictures.  I'm strange.  But I worked damn hard for each one of them. I too am pale, have to take a lot of iron every day, and bruise fairly easily."

Some people say it's a placebo but it's worked wonders for me. Also, try upping your vitamin C intake. That will help with keeping you from bruising that bad in the first place."

poledancing,3bzn2c,polecat123,3,Fri Jul 3 13:09:45 2015 UTC,Xpole will be bad for a plaster ceiling. I had to put my pole up in the porch outside because I had nowhere else to put it. I wouldn't suggest it.
poledancing,3bzn2c,082592,2,Fri Jul 3 18:00:54 2015 UTC,I'm pondering putting a pole up outside too... how awful is it?
poledancing,3bzn2c,Ms_Gaea,2,Fri Jul 3 19:07:24 2015 UTC,Well when I had my pole up I was back in Winnipeg and we had cold dry winters and very hot summers. It's kind of a pain in the winter but in the summer I didn't mind the heat in the evenings or nighttime so I would practice then. Just sucks walking by it every day when its cold and not being able to use it. Other than that I liked having it outside!
poledancing,3bzn2c,082592,2,Fri Jul 3 19:53:34 2015 UTC,You should ask your manager/landlord what type of ceilings are in the house and then call X-Pole and see what they say about it.  Another alternative is to purchase a free-standing pole (X-Stage). It's nearly double the price....but at least you can keep it inside and not even worry about damaging the ceiling. My friends who have X-Stages have had them for a long time and consider it a great investment. Plus the portability is a huge plus if you ever want to use it for a performance/festival or even just for some fun in the park.
poledancing,3bzn2c,angelagabbie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:11:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! There are definitely ceiling joists and my teacher seems to think it would be ok, but that's a good suggestion to phone x-pole to double check.  I would love an x-stage but I don't think I have the time/money right now, especially as I would need it adjusted for ceiling height too :("

For me the biggest problems were flexibility and technique rather than strength, although having more strength probably means you can overcome the other issues.   Hang out in that twisted grip position with the chest up towards the ceiling - with both feet on the ground, on your tiptoes, on one leg, dangling, spinning backwards (on spinny mode) Work on iron Xes, including going back up Place your bottom hand uncomfortably high - place your forearm horizontally to the pole, then move your hand an inch or two lower but no more Spin fast-ish for momentum Kick your top leg back past your shoulder (knee to nipple)"

poledancing,3bvcop,iheartlungs,2,Thu Jul 2 15:36:10 2015 UTC,"It might help you to take notes and draw diagrams in class if you're struggling to remember. Or to video yourself in class (or at home if you've got a pole) so that when you learn something new, you can watch it back again. Sometimes you remember in your head what it looked like or vaguely how you got into a move, but you forget the small details that can be the difference between getting a move and sliding straight down the pole.."
poledancing,3bvcop,MyMuddyEyes,2,Thu Jul 2 16:29:10 2015 UTC,Lots of videos and muscle memory! Taking videos of myself has been super beneficial for remembering things I've learned.
poledancing,3bvcop,angelagabbie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:18:15 2015 UTC,"I have a three subject notebook. The first subject is a table of contents, of sorts, and the second two are just for my log of moves. During class, I write the names of the moves in the TOC, and then I sit immediately after class and write the how-to for each move in the log. I always leave at least three lines after each move in case I come back to a trick I didn't get so I can add what works for me r and additional details I missed the first time.   It seemed involved at first and I didn't know if I'd stick with it, but it has been so nice, because now that I know so many more tricks, I can easily go back to moves that I haven't done in months and I have my own instructions on how each one works best for me. This also helps because when I'm writing a combo I can gloss over the table of contents and see moves that I'd forgotten about or that I don't do often that would work well.  My progress has skyrocketed since keeping a log, but it is something that you need to commit to each class or at least every few classes."
poledancing,3bvcop,missmichellepole,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:54:20 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat xD. I keep a sheet of paper taped to the wall with a list of moves that every time I go on I run through the check list.  If I come across one that I somehow forgot I look back up on previous day video and then I see how I did it. I'm now working on putting poses and floor work o the sheet and it's starting to get cramped xD. I'm also starting to link moves together that flow nice and that's helping a lot ^
poledancing,3bvcop,Tell_Tail,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:29:48 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely the nerd who turned pole moves into a spreadsheet. I have an Excel spreadsheet that I add moves to every time I learn a new one, and I classify it by type of move (spin, hold, floorwork, etc.) and have a column for how to do it + a link to a picture.  It's a bit to maintain, but now at the level I'm at, I'm so grateful I did that because otherwise, there's no way I'd remember all the little things I've done!"

I'll generally ask about a couple of inverted moves, a couple of poses, a spin or two, and a flex move.  A lot of times, it depends on the instructor.  Like, there's one I love who is VERY good at flexy, so I ask her for more flexy help. There's one I love for choreo.  There's another I love for flow.  It depends on what she's good at.  I'd take some of your long term goals in and some shorter term goals.  If she's got any signature moves, TOTALLY ask about those.  The local instructors I've taken from generally do a warm up and cool down, though some will expect you to come warm.   But, in general, it's your time.  You come with a plan and you can make the most of it!  The instructors I know will general level test outside of privates, so you may not even need to ask for it during your lesson time."

poledancing,3bbtkd,meowjanjan,2,Sun Jun 28 00:55:14 2015 UTC,"I'm usually such a sweaty hand girl so I was super scared for this!! But someone must have been looking out for me because i wasn't nervous at all (nerves equal even sweater hands for me). This is my cocktail of grip:  Tite grip original applying 1-2 hours beforehand and reapplying every time my hands start feeling slick   Dry hands a few times before going on stage  Small layer of firm grip righty before going on stage  The floor work that I did with my prop was also to give me a moment to wipe my hands if I felt like I needed to, although in the end I didn't have to :)"

poledancing,3b8eeh,bluemojito,2,Sat Jun 27 00:58:50 2015 UTC,"I'll try to type out my right/left split stretch routine... let me know if something doesn't make sense. Also, at all times, try to keep your back as flat as possible, starting from your lower spine, when stretching. It's more effective than just hunching over your legs, even if it looks like you aren't going as far.  Start standing in 2nd position (wide stance), and stretch down to the floor. Move your hands to the floor on either side of your right foot so that you're stretching over your right leg. Turn your right leg so that your right foot is pointing in the opposite direction of your left. Bend your left knee (make sure your knee does NOT go past your toes, and don't let the knee lean inwards. You want it directly over your foot). Try flexing your right foot if you don't feel much of a stretch. Straighten the left knee, and turn the leg to face the same direction as your right leg. Drop down into a right lunge. Try to balance in the lunge without your hands - if you can, try stretching your arms over your head and backwards to stretch out your back some. Bring your hands down to the ground and drop your back knee. Try to drop to your forearms (both arms on the inside of your front leg) and push into the lunge. (Again, dont let the knee go past your toe) You can also turn out your right leg while doing this for a slightly different stretch. This next part will be difficult to explain... Push back onto your left leg, so that your knee is at a 90 degree angle, and your right leg is stretched out in front of you. (Make sure your hips are squared - dont let one be further in front of the other, or higher than the other) Try to point your right foot so that its as flat on the ground as you can get it. Rest your hands on either side of your right leg and flatten your back. Then try to lean down over the front leg while keeping your back flat. Next sit back on your left leg - make sure that you dont sit completely on the left foot. You want just your left buttcheek to be over the left foot, right buttcheek should be trying to sit on the ground. (Just dont cheat and lean to the right) Front leg should still be stretched in front of you - lean over it. You can try flexing your right foot for a different stretch. And that's it!   For an easy transition to the left side, push back up into a lunge with the back knee down, then open your lunge up to the center and push over the the other side. Once you've stretched both sides, try your splits! If you're almost on the ground, but not completely, try taking your hands off the floor and letting gravity pull you down. Lean forward over the front leg, and try to arch your back over your back leg. Bonus points if you can grab your back leg and do a scorpion on the ground!  I hope that made sense... It's probably not the best stretch routine around, it's just what I do and how I got my splits. Once you have your right/left, try putting a yoga block or a phone book or something under your front leg in your split to work your oversplit. Once you've got that, get a friend to sit on a stool and use the rungs on the stool to increase your oversplit. (Pad the rungs first with a towel or something first, kinda hurts if a bare rung digs into the back of your ankle) Hope this helps somewhat!"

I've gone from totally terrible to my front calf is on the floor now over the course of about 9 months.  The key is just to keep doing it as often as you can.  My progress has sped up and slowed down depending on how frequently I'm stretching.  Try to put together a stretching routine you can do every day and really stick to it.  How often do you stretch?  How long have you been at it?  This stuff takes a long time."

I did have my splits last summer but then i pulled a hamstring (youre never as flexible as you think on when your drunk!) and ive just managed to bounce back from that!  I think its different for everybody, but for me i have to be really really warm, not have done a lot of strength work (i think that tightens all my muscles and all flexibility goes out the window) and then i use P+F stretching, getting people to sit on me, push and pull on the appropriate limbs! And breeeathe! Big deep breaths, lowering yourself with each out breath. Resist the stretch (tense all muscles, push against the pressure) for 5 seconds then release. You should drop down a little lower once youve done that a few times.  Just keep on! Its hard work, but well worth it!"

poledancing,3b1xne,N-amPleaca,6,Thu Jun 25 08:44:48 2015 UTC,"Hey!   Firstly before you get a pole, if you've never done pole before, I would really recommend trying even one or two pole classes to get some basics and help you start pole safely :)  The most popular brand of pole is probably x-pole. These are pressure mounted and don't require any drilling, though they do need to be fitted directly under a ceiling joist. Fitting instructions can be found here - http://www.x-pole.co.uk/component/content/article/55-technical-information/technical-information1/101-installation  (Sorry I'm on mobile with no clue how to link).   X-poles have various models. The ""sport"" version is static, and therefore doesn't spin. The x-pert version has a choice of static or spinning modes. You change between these using an Allen key. My personal advice is to work on a static pole until you have enough strength and control to try spin pole. Spin pole can be very fast and is, again in my opinion, more difficult. Get the basics down first!   I realise this sounds like a giant ad for x-pole. There are lots of brands out there and I'm sure they all have good points, I just trust x-pole the most!   Enjoy!

Cleo the Hurricane's rockin legs and abs dvd has a great warmup chapter that you might find useful, aside from the obvious stretching etc being good for preventing injuries, a decent warmup really helps you stick to the pole! I like to wear leggings and a long sleeve tee for a warmup to make sure I'm properly warm and stretchy :)"

poledancing,3b1xne,mai_z,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:09:20 2015 UTC,"I second XPole.  I would go with the x-pert version, that way if you want to move to spinning pole, you don't have to buy another pole.  I keep mine in static mode 90% of the time, but it's nice to have the option.  Also, even though you don't have to drill holes in the wall, don't be concerned about weight limits or anything - I've seen 350 pound girls throw themselves around those with no issues.  I also love how easy it is to put up/take down.  It takes 15 minutes or less.  That way, it's easy to pull down if your parents (or some other authority figure) come over and you don't want them to see it."

I'd recommend doing a class or two to make sure that you like it, an get some basics under your belt.  I just got an xpole xpert, and I LOVE it, but it's pretty slippery because it's new, so that can be discouraging. Other than that, it's great though; it's tension mounted, and you can put it up/down as you please but is best done with two people and takes at least 15 min. If you have popcorn ceilings, that's a bit of a problem, and it'll crush it and might shift a little."

poledancing,3b1s6b,iheartlungs,16,Thu Jun 25 07:25:52 2015 UTC,"I dunno personally I wouldn't have an issue with it(plus heels are awesome), but playing devil's advocate you also have to think about the audience they would be dancing for aka the groups friends and family, will there be younger kids there? Performing for other dancers and polers is one thing but families are something else.   The way I see it it's their house their rules.  Option one is probably the best route, something that's not aggressive and still professional.  Option two sucks, it's much less professional and seems more like just stirring the pot."
poledancing,3b1s6b,Wildernessinabox,9,Thu Jun 25 09:08:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with wilderness above. It's a private business and they're free to do as they wish - if they have an ""open house"" for families, I think it's reasonable to ask to keep the performances PG. Like a stand-up comedy venue, for example - a lot of comedians drop f-bombs, but that doesn't mean you have to swear to be funny. Or a club that makes its money on the EDM/house kids that dance there every weekend - naturally they'd turn away hip-hop or rock acts, no matter how talented, since it doesn't fit their audience.  That said, I agree that diversity in pole is part of what makes it so wonderful. It seems to me that the rival studio is missing an opportunity here. Maybe they should host their own show with more risque acts. If the first studio is bent on doing a fitness-oriented, family-friendly approach, surely there are polers looking for a more sensual approach whose needs could be met at the rival studio!"
poledancing,3b1s6b,tastysugar,4,Thu Jun 25 10:22:40 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely say something to the rival studio owner (she's one of the performers who got forbidden from dancing!).  The way things are looking now, her studio is flourishing while the other studio (the showcase organisers) are...not doing great. So. I guess the numbers speak for themselves."
poledancing,3b1s6b,meowjanjan,8,Thu Jun 25 11:53:22 2015 UTC,I agree with the others who are staying their house their rules. It does also bother me that they are banning a certain style of dance because that's what is so great about pole is that you can really make it what you want! It's a bummer they are doing that but I understand where both sides are coming from.
poledancing,3b1s6b,lilfunky1,9,Thu Jun 25 15:26:49 2015 UTC,"IMO, the erotic-performers are in the wrong.  They know the organizers/hosting studio of this showcase are not into erotic dancing, but wanted to stir shit up by trying to perform an erotic dance anyways at what I assume the organizers want to be a family-friendly event.  If they want to perform their for-adult-eyes routine so badly, they should just host their own showcase.  Picketing the event would be obnoxiously childish."
poledancing,3b1s6b,lilfunky1,0,Thu Jun 25 14:39:05 2015 UTC,"But don't you think that, since is the only event we have, it would be better to open it to all forms of pole?"

Not if the host-studio and organizers of the event don't want to open it to ""all forms of pole.""  In short: their house(studio), their rules.  Besides, what's stopping the pro-erotic-dancing studio from hosting their own showcase?  Then there will be multiple events for the locals to check out."
poledancing,3b1s6b,MakeupFeb,2,Thu Jun 25 14:49:04 2015 UTC,"Like everyone said, if banning the performance has to do with the target audience of the showcase, it's totally understandable and reasonable.  BUT if their only reasoning has to do with the fact that it ""brings down the sport,"" I think it's lame. Pole dancing, just like all other dancing, is about movement and expression. People go out to see burlesque shows all the time, which are usually much more risque than the ""sexy"" pole routines I've seen.  I think it's important to honor and remember that ""exotic dancing"" is a crucial part of pole dancing's history. Plus it also just perpetuates the shaming of club dancers. I know a lot of girls who pole dance for money at clubs and they're regular, nice girls who are just making sure they pay rent on time.  Of course, there are boundaries. There's obviously a difference between being sexy/sensual vs. being distastefully suggestive and vulgar.  I'd be interested in knowing if the hosting studio even saw the routine. They should at least give it a chance."
poledancing,3b1s6b,fotcfan1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:15:06 2015 UTC,"Apparently, they saw a video of it. In the video, one of the girls even went barefoot to show them what it would look like without heels (because they were willing to even dance without heels to accommodate the host studio). Apparently, even then it was deemed too lascivious. Someone I know who saw the video said that it was absolutely beautiful, and not at all over the top. It was just a mostly floor-work based piece, with a bit of sort of sensual 'body waves' and that sort of thing. Not vulgar at all."

Scour the internet for more that you want to learn that looks doable from where you are now.  This subreddit is good, so are Instagram, Youtube, and Studio Veena even without the paid subscription.  Fairly often I'll find a move or variation that I've never seen before at all, and they're not always super advanced either. Try stringing things you already know together in combos.  Find new ways to get in and out of moves.  Try stringing as many together as you can, or see if you can copy combos you find in videos online, then create variations.  This is fantastic for cleaning up your form on what you already know and conditioning your body. Dance!  Whether you're more into freestyling or want to make up a choreographed routine, dance it up.  It's tons of fun and great practice.  Video yourself to get an idea of what needs polishing. Keep up the conditioning.  In addition to whatever you do, just keep conditioning for your shoulder mounts and handsprings a bit every time you pole.  One day, you'll have a really awesome surprise.

You don't want to accidentally put up your pole not on a stud and have your pole fall/tear though the ceiling while you are upside down.

poledancing,3axk37,mai_z,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:10:25 2015 UTC,I second everyone's comments on the stud finder. What I'd add is try to find one that can read deeper than .75 of an inch. We live in an old building and we had a hard time finding the beam (like is this wiring etc) because it had been plastered over so many times!
poledancing,3auqi6,HurricaneTime,4,Tue Jun 23 17:44:55 2015 UTC,nice ! try to slower your hand on the pole so you can get your leg behind your shoulder and be more parallel to the floor :) flexibility-wise im sure you can !
poledancing,3auqi6,Saruz,5,Tue Jun 23 19:15:24 2015 UTC,Seconding this.   You want to be able to prop your leg over your shoulder so you have leverage to get your back leg higher up and parallel to the floor.

poledancing,3aqndc,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:52:43 2015 UTC,Thanks! Does that mean I grip a bit with the side of my body/armpit too?
poledancing,3aqndc,angelagabbie,2,Mon Jun 22 18:55:20 2015 UTC,"Not really. It can't be the same grip as in Inside Leg Hang, with the side of the tummy and the armpit.   I like this example for somebody who doesn't have a whole lot of back flexibility. The side of her rib might touch the pole, but as you can see the upper hand gets in the way of gripping with the side. Armpit grip is also usually not happening there, it should be more like a Butterfly lower arm placement.   Note that those with flexible back do this (bonus front view), which looks like the torso is not vertical and far from the pole, but it curves under the hips in a backbend rather than straight line away from the hips."
poledancing,3aqndc,false_light,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:17:36 2015 UTC,"I think your torso should be more in line with the pole rather in fron't of it.

Also turn your torso towards the pole, which will help you retain that thigh contact to the pole. This is a great beautiful picture of how your torso should be."

Heat and humidity in the room, which pole you're using, obviously. Also, if it's your legs that aren't sticking, it's good to know that freshly shaved legs are NOT your friend.

I don't know what hemisphere you're in, but I'm in the southern and everyone at my studio is getting more slippery than usual. It could be that you're more temperature sensitive than other people?"

poledancing,3aofb2,Reyalla508,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:14:42 2015 UTC,"Well, that's some relief, at least. In the routine I'm doing I'm then sliding my hands to the floor and going into a handstand. But obviously that involves being still, and I'm going so crazy fast that transitioning to 'still' feels impossible."
poledancing,3aofb2,Reyalla508,3,Mon Jun 22 08:35:58 2015 UTC,"Ok so since there isn't another aerial trick and you're headed for the dismount, my advice would be to try and start your initial spinning climb slower. I assume you're getting into the climb through a fireman spin type entrance? Remember, no actual swinging or jumping into the spin. Only lean into it and push off the floor gently. Try to go too slow. Consider how much force you used to do that, then add just a little more, until you're taking it as fast as you can handle. Eventually it will become a matter of getting more comfortable with the spinning and managing to transition despite the speed. Another option is to go into an extended crucifix, but that depends on your comfortability in that trick. The extended leg in the Gemini comes into the pole just like heading towards crucifix but remains straight. If you aim to grip more in the inner thigh that between the knees you'll be able to extend that leg further. The further you have limbs extending away from the pole the slower the pole will go. If all else fails just start sliding down and stop yourself with your hands on the floor. Hope this helps!"
poledancing,3aofb2,angelagabbie,2,Mon Jun 22 09:01:01 2015 UTC,Another alternative though very very similar to extended crucifix is Tammy (AKA dragonfly AKA gold digger AKA a lot of other things lol). You can get into it from gemini and has more of a hooked leg so is a little more stable.

You should keep your elbow slightly bent with this move to reduce risk of injury. Don't ever lock your elbow.   It sounds like you haven't built up the strength to do it yet, but maybe some form tips will help:      I'll say it again, don't lock the elbow. Keep the wrist of your bottom hand perpendicular to the pole. That is, don't allow the wrist to contact the pole at some weird angle.  Some people find it easier to do this trick with a smaller distance between hands. If your top hand is already as high as possible, try lowering it. Play around with the distance and see what helps and what doesn't.    This girl has good form, but a really wide grip."

People can seriously screw up their wrists doing it, and it's definitely a strain on your wrists. If you don't have the strength in your arms right now, there are definitely other grips you can use for a carousel spin - try the variation with one arm straight out in front of you and pushing you away from the pole, rather than an actual split grip."
poledancing,3amiml,082592,2,Mon Jun 22 12:30:44 2015 UTC,It's a strength issue. Do conditioning exercises for your biceps for about a week or two and you will notice an amazing difference! I also recommend getting a stress ball. Hand strength is also very important.

poledancing,3aj26g,Reyalla508,6,Sat Jun 20 21:25:51 2015 UTC,"I've never heard this complaint, lol... Usually dancers are annoyed if the spin slows or stops. But I get where you're coming from, you're not used to it yet. Spin mode tips: start off simple. Do your simple spins (fireman, sun wheel, front hook, back hook, etc) and practice getting into them with the precise amount of force that will keep you going, but not so fast that you feel out of control. No swinging or kicking or jumping into it, try doing the motion of the swinging leg, but instead of actually swinging just lean into it. You can always add a tiny swing or push off the floor to add momentum when youre more comfortable with it. In trick combos make sure you have an even combination of tricks that pull your body close to the pole and tricks where you extend your body and limbs away from the pole. The speed up and slow down will keep the pole going but not too fast. Example, fireman climb (slowly!) to pole sit (speeding up), plank (slowing down), back to pole sit with one arm in front of the pole (speeding up), and chair spin for a dismount (slowly!). When you're first starting out, spin mode should be all slow motion for you. You'll learn to feel in complete control of the spin speed, or at least your body will know what's coming and you'll feel prepared for the force changes. I hope this helps! :)"

poledancing,3a8qq6,Fairest_Lily,6,Thu Jun 18 03:02:21 2015 UTC,"What kinds of other exercises (Yoga, running, weights, etc.) did you find useful to help with Pole?   I'm sure yoga would be helpful for teaching balance and working on flexibility, but to be honest pole (and other related aerial disciplines) is the only workout I do because it's the only one I enjoy. I hate running and I'm not crazy about lifting weights. I progressed just fine :P For me, it was never about progressing, but rather about just finding something that I enjoyed.   How many classes would you recommend weekly/monthly to see visible results? (I know it varies, but I'd love opinions.)   Depends on your goals? Pole didn't help me lose weight, but it definitely built up muscle and made me more toned. For me, my overall shape is more determined by diet. I went about 1-2x a week when I was with a studio. After I quit taking formal classes, I practiced on my own on a ""whenever I feel like it"" type basis... probably close to 2-3x a week.   Is a home pole necessary?   Once you get to the more advanced levels, I think so. But prior to that, it's really just a matter of whether or not you'll use it.   I have sweaty palms. Is there any kind of grip/chalk/powder I can buy to help with gripping the pole?   Yes. Everyone I know swears by Dry Hands. If you have trouble sticking and it's because the pole is cold and/or your skin is too dry, I personally swear by Corn Husker's lotion, and I know quite a few people who are fond of iTac.    What were some ""major breakthrough"" moments for you? Like tricks that turned into building blocks for others, physical limitations overcome, etc?   My first one was getting my first invert into a gemini. Another dancer at the club showed me how to do it, and it took me a week of attempting it on random poles (including a structural pole in my then-boyfriend's basement!) before I finally got it. The other major one was the first time I went to a real studio and saw someone do a butterfly - that was the move that made me go, ""I wanna be able to do that!"" Having a solid butterfly really is the foundation to all the advanced moves like the handspring and the iron x, IMO."

poledancing,3a8qq6,adriennex1,4,Thu Jun 18 14:33:38 2015 UTC,"Yay! Welcome to pole :) before I even answer any of your questions I just want to point out that pole and the pole community are the best, most supportive bunch of people I've ever come across, they're awesome :)  Anyways, in terms of exercise apart from pole, I can't recommend free weights highly enough. Machines are good to an extent but I find free weights help a lot more with my strength, core and balance. I seem to get good results with augmenting pole with a couple of free weights sessions a week concentrating on shoulders, chest and core (and a little bit of arms). This gives me good control on the pole.   I don't have a home pole - I do one 60-90 minute class a week and do open pole sessions when I can. If your studio offers them, they're a good chance to practice and refine your moves, and you'll always find support from other dancers in my experience!   I have a really weird combo of terribly sweaty hands and a very dry body. For my hands, it's been a case of trial and error for me to see what works. An anti perspirant (I use Dirty Girl Poletice, though I've heard awesome things about dry hands too) and a little bit of grip aid works great for me depending on what I'm doing. I only need the anti perspirant for spins, while climbs, inverts and tricks need a grip. I like ones with a little bit of tack, my favourite is Stickum spray. That combo seems to work well for my hands, although I keep a towel close by just in case.   My best advice is to not be afraid to celebrate ""small"" victories like your first pole sit or the first time you can climb the pole. Do these with grace and control and you'll look as amazing as any ""advanced"" dancer! Take pictures. Show off! Climbing was probably my first ""eureka"" moment, being able to climb more than one ""step"" if you like. Basic inverts were also a huge mental block for me. It's little things - figuring out oh, that's a pull with the arms, not a kick with the legs etc. Now, it's a year and a half on and most days I'm astonished by what my body can do!"
poledancing,3a8qq6,adriennex1,2,Thu Jun 18 12:47:39 2015 UTC,"So glad to be a part of this community! I can't wait to be able to really climb. Right now, I can climb up like once (one scootch up) and hold myself vertically, but I can't get to that second scootch up, if that makes sense."
poledancing,3a8qq6,angelagabbie,2,Thu Jun 18 14:31:19 2015 UTC,"Second scootch was exactly what I got stuck on with this move!  3 things helped me - one, are my hands dry enough? I completely admit that at first, I would do one scootch, hang on tight with my legs and wipe my sweaty hands on my shorts to dry them off before continuing!   Second, how's my leg grip? Because of my dry skin, I need a little bit of pole moisturiser (I use Dew Point Pole, Corn Husker's will also work well for a non greasy hold), because otherwise it felt like trying to climb the pole with talcum powdered legs! I use just enough moisturiser to feel the pole ""grabbing"" the skin - just a little resistance and no more! Make sure you get a nice secure grip with the legs through the knees and shins.   Step 3 was the most important! This was figuring out that climbing the pole isn't just scrambling up and it's not a series of pull ups either! Let the legs do the work. As in, to get that second scootch, reach your hands just over your head. There should still be a bend at the elbow. Tighten everything up - as much as you can, engage the muscles in your shoulders, biceps and abs. The goal here is to keep your body nice and strong and secure exactly where it is. Then bring the knees up to meet the chest as much as you can, get that grip with the knees and shins, and push push push up with the legs to a standing position! And repeat. Sorry for the wall of text, but I got so disheartened thinking that I would never be able to do 5 or 6 pull ups to the top of the pole - turns out you don't have to! Hope that helps :)"
poledancing,3a8qq6,bluemojito,4,Fri Jun 19 00:47:35 2015 UTC,"Welcome welcome welcome!!  For supplemental exercising to pole, yoga/stretching, cardio, and abs are usually what most people will suggest. Lifting is good, especially to make sure you're working on both sides as pole tends to make you favor your dominant side.  I think 2-3 classes a week will make you see visible progress! I have a home pole, but I primarily use it for dance therapy rather than tricks since I'm terrible at warming up and warming up is super important for injury prevention.  As for fundamental moves you should have as you progress, a solid climb and what's on this list. Keep in mind that you won't be taught these moves immediately as a lot of these deal with going upside down which shouldn't be taught until you have proper strength.  Pole IS painful!!! This is one of my personal limitations. You will get bruised and banged up and your skin will feel on fire sometimes, but trust me it's worth it when you get that feeling of nailing a new trick or seeing how much stronger you are than before.  As you progress into your pole journey, you'll begin to acknowledge that there will be some moves that you won't be able to do due to physical limitations, but you'll also find what your strengths are. Whether it's the way you move when you freedance or the fact that you're super strong or that you can kill it in 10-in heels, everybody has their ""thing"" that makes them a unique poler.  Some other tips I always like to give pole babies:   Similar to my last point, don't be discouraged by other people's progress. I brought my roommate to a class and she nailed a move I've been working on for weeks on her FIRST try. Get out of that mentality like ""oh we started doing pole at the same time but she's doing way more blah blah blah."" Everyone's bodies are different! This will inevitably happen where you will go to a class and it seems like everyone else is on a higher level than you. Don't be intimidated! Tell the instructor that you're not ready to do this or that you've never done that before and if s/he is a good instructor, they will be able to give you an alternative move or a conditioning exercise to work towards that move. If you're lucky enough to have multiple pole studios around you, give a few of them a try before deciding to sign a 3-month contract or a 20-class package. The communities, culture, and instructors will vary from studio to studio. One studio may be all about strength and tricks, one may be all about sexy dancing and everyone wears heels, one may be all about exploring the dancer within you. Find one that feels like home to you :)   WHOA this reply got out of hand! So sorry if I'm overwhelming you - I'm just so excited to hear when people are trying pole for the first time! Again, welcome to the pole world <3"
poledancing,3a8qq6,meowjanjan,3,Thu Jun 18 17:52:25 2015 UTC,"I find good cardio & weight training to be very helpful. Good stamina is beneficial for being able to power through harder pole sessions where I'm really trying to get a new trick or where I have to pole climb a lot. Weight lifting, especially arm & upper back strengthening exercises, obviously will give you more strength to work with in pole classes. I also really like doing abdominal exercises to help with some inversion moves.  Two a week allowed me to make the gains I wanted at the speed I was comfortable with; one was the class and one was an open pole session where I could practice the stuff I wasn't catching onto as quickly.  Up to you! I can't afford it/don't have the space for one now so I use more open pole sessions to give myself the chance to get free time with the pole.  Tons out there! Aerial Amy's blog has a whole article about grip aids and some pros/cons of them (http://aerialamy.com/blog/grip-aids/). My previous instructor also said moisturizing your hands regularly outside of class helps since it keeps your skin's oil production more balanced so you're less prone to heavy sweating in class.  Once I got my pole climb I felt invincible & really started progressing more! I've also seen that the inversion is a lead-in to a bajillion other tricks.    Hope this helps and happy poling!"

I do pole 6 times a week. I have an active job and teach aquasize so I don't do any other fitness expect for 1 core strength class and 1 flexibility class. I'm with the other girl that eating right will get you the results. I have built a lot of muscle but you can only see it a little bit because I'm addicted to candy!  I use dry hands to keep my hands from being sweaty and I use A LOT of it! I don't have an at home pole they are really expensive and I look forward to going to the studio for open pole sessions so I don't see a need for one. Good luck on your pole journey, remember to be proud of all your accomplishments!   Major breakthrough was doing my aerial twisted grip extended butterfly after that I felt invincible and started progressing really fast!"
poledancing,3a8qq6,yumdonuts,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:37:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I'll definitely keep eating right in mind. I am trying to lose a little weight (nothing drastic, maybe 15-20 pounds max) and I think combining cardio, diet and regular pole will be great for me."
poledancing,3a8qq6,MyPigWaddles,3,Thu Jun 18 14:36:39 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  I don't attend classes at a studio, so my answers won't be as useful as others, but maybe some of this will help you.  1) Depending on what you're missing, weights can boost strength and cardio can boost endurance.  I lifted for a few months when I started pole because I was very weak, but once I was strong enough to do a few pole things, I let that be my continued strength development.  Also, stretching!  If you want to get bendier, start a stretching regimen and keep at it regularly.  Flexibility takes time to develop, so start the habits early if it's something you want.  2) Not sure about classes.  I have a pole at home that I work on 4-5x a week for 30-45 minutes and I was seeing obvious changes in my body within a couple of months.  I don't know if that much is necessary, though, I just like poling a lot.  It's going to depend a lot on where your body is now and your diet.  If you do enough pole, you'll probably develop the muscles in your arms, shoulders, back, and abs.  If you run a calorie deficit, you'll lose body fat.  3) Not unless you want to get competitive or practice really frequently, I don't think.  They're really fun though.  4) Many kinds.  I like Dry Hands for when my hands are sweaty.  5) So many.  It feels like everything along the way is a huge victory.  when I started, I did not have the strength to climb the pole, so that was HUGE, as was my first successful invert.  9 months into my journey my ayesha clicked into place and I was ecstatic (and wouldn't stop talking about it to my partner/pole widow for at least 24 hours).  Most recently, I've started getting aerial shoulder mounts to happen and it's making me feel awesome.  Happy Poling! :D"
poledancing,3a8qq6,iheartlungs,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:58:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I'm definitely getting some ""Dry Hands"""
poledancing,3a8qq6,iheartlungs,3,Thu Jun 18 14:30:21 2015 UTC,"Cardio could really help you building stamina, which you need to avoid dying after an hour of poling, or if you think about joining a competition soon. But I can tell you you should be fine without, I hate cardio, never do it, have horrible stamina, I'm dead after a combo but I'm gettin quite strong anyway. Two weeks were fine in the beginning for me, I saw a lot of improvement the first year, but now that I'm getting into more advanced tricks I feel like two classes a week isn't enough. But as you said, it varies, I've seen so many girls improving so quickly and doing a handspring after like 6 months while coming 2 or 3 times a week. It is if you want to improve even more, if you are self-disciplined enough to use it. I have it, I never use it nowadays. I became so lazy and I hate warming up at home, I'd rather just go to the studio even if it means wasting 1h30 going and coming back, but there's something about training at my studio, even if i'm at alone, that makes me more motivated. Try different grips and chalks until you find the one that works for you. I was lucky enough to try DryHands for the first time and finding it perfectly since the beginning for my hands, while others I tried from other people once or twice were absolutely useless. There are lists online where you can find most of the grips being sold.  I get myself injured quite easily, I think it's because I dont eat healthy enough, other things in life stresses me a lot so my body can't ""keep up"" with my training. And it isn't the sore-muscles-pain. I also can't go to my osteopath as often as I would like. So my main focus in classes and when I train is to be always aware of mylimitations, to be sure I'm able to do a certain trick based on mystrenght level, or have someone to spot me when I don't feel safe, to avoid injuries. This leads to me being a pussy and often not trying tricks at all because I'm scared even if I know I could do them on my own or I know there's no risk in getting injured. So my major breakthrough is every trick I couldn't do on my own first because I was dead scared and then finally I got them. i.e. I got the dragontail on my own yday !!"
poledancing,3a8qq6,yumdonuts,2,Thu Jun 18 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"Hooray! Pole is awesome. I've never been athletic but I loved pole because of how it made me feel :)  I started initially with yoga and capoeira so those helped me with core strength, flexibility,  and endurance. Currently I just exclusively do pole and hike on weekends. I did find that after a month of crossfit I was finding myself doing some strength moves with ease. If you're at a good pole studio, you'll slowly build up the necessary muscles to pole. Some people like strength moves, some are super flexible, some are just awesome dancers without the strength and flexible moves. Everybody develops their own style which I love.   Optimally I can only fit two pole classes per week, but I know the more you go the faster you'll progress.   I really like having my home pole, even if it's just to do some conditioning like ""pole ups"" and side crunches and whatnot. I also hate freestyling with people watching so I freestyle as a warm up when I'm practicing at home.  Dry hands is the best grip powder for me when I have sweaty palms. But you'e going to have to experiment with different things. Tuf-skin is my spiderman spray, but it does become slippery if I'm sweating too much. Different seasons/temperatures affect grip so you want to have a range of stuff to use. There's probably a thread somewhere with grip aids listed.  Major breakthrough for me was the extended butterfly, ayesha and shoulder mount (my teacher made us shoulder mount from the ground so we couldn't push ourselves off. It was like the biggest accomplishment to have enough core strength to do it from a sitting position).   Good luck :)"

Did yours seem like she was very experienced or new at this? Either way, if you weren't comfortable with her, try someone else! It's such a great activity, you deserve a teacher you love."
poledancing,3a8nwi,MyPigWaddles,2,Thu Jun 18 03:44:28 2015 UTC,"She used right and left as opposed to inner and outer? Or was she meaning stand to the right of the pole? If it was the latter she may have stood to left to act as mirror if she was facing you. Also, ten moves in one 60 hour class is a lot especially for a beginner class. Most classes only teach about 2-4 moves a class. In my opinion see what other options there are."
poledancing,3a8nwi,Lucky_Taco_Cat,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:25:01 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a lot for your first class! In my first class we did a a lot of skills on the ground, like body rolls, pole walks etc. then we did a front and back hook spin. The fireman and pole sits were saved for a few weeks after we had built up some strength. But our instructors are always clear on where our hands and body should be and we practice each move on both sides. Maybe look for a different studio or a different instructor if this class isn't working out"
poledancing,3a8nwi,OreoTart,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:47:24 2015 UTC,"I have a question, was it a""level 1"" type of class? Or was it a class specifically for first timers?  If it was a level 1 class or the likes, you will want to keep in mind that other students there have been taking those classes for weeks, sometimes months or longer. It can be difficult for an instructor to try and give first timers and level 1 students the instruction to meet their individual needs. To me it sounds like she was trying to keep level 1s engaged as well as teach you and your BF and whatever others were experiencing this for their first time.  Keep attending and the moves will start to sink in. Things that didn't make sense may have just been to fast for you to understand the mechanics of at this point. You'll get it eventually, you just need to keep at it.   Ps. What state are you in?"

Take a level and press it against the pole, walk around the pole with the level to make sure that it's level all the way around.  If you're really at a loss, you can try calling the manufacturer too."
poledancing,3a74ie,angelagabbie,2,Wed Jun 17 19:57:47 2015 UTC,"When you say ""wobbles"", do you mean that it bows from side to side?

I also find that the teacher doesn't even need to be fluent in English to make himself/herself understood.  Pole dance vocabulary is rather simple and in most cases the names of moves are the universal/English one.  Anyway, I think that the sphere of Europeans who pole dance is pretty much inside the sphere of Europeans who speak English.

poledancing,3998mf,Lucky_Taco_Cat,8,Wed Jun 10 04:17:19 2015 UTC,"poledancecommunity.com is a fantastic free resource. 30 day ab challenge at home has strengthened my abs incomparably to any fitness class prior.  I heartily recommend it to any pole dancer, access to a studio or no. cleosrocknpole.com is $24 a month, though I haven't tried it out. There are some DVDs out there, like Alethea Austin's, who demonstrates technique well, but her teaching style didn't explain things to me so I could really get them. There's plenty of people on instagram posting pole stuff if you just want to see moves executed well. You can get flow ideas from youtube posts of competitions. studioveena is a discussion forum, like this one, for tips.   It's important to have someone to spot you when you're learning new things, at least it's been essential for me, since fear is such a big part of the learning process."

They accidentally sent me the DVD first, so I happen to have that too as they told me to keep it for their mistake and sent the book. The book is quite nice as you can mark the pages you're working on, there's also space for notes on each of the moves and sometimes tips. It is still working free online, you just have to click PDC syllabus on the home page and then click the little flash thing. The DVD has exactly the same thing as that flash program, the book has all the stuff frame by frame. I prefer the book, I've yet to use the dvd"

poledancing,3998mf,mcnunu,6,Thu Jun 11 16:38:11 2015 UTC,"In general a couple of moves per class is a realistic expectation at any studio. Once you get to higher levels it's not unheard of to spend months on move before perfecting it. I feel like whilst video tutorials are useful, they should be used in combination with in studio classes as some moves are just explained way better in person, not to mention the safety factor.   Tantra Tutorials is by my studio, in addition to paid tutorials there are quite a few free tutorials by our instructors and international pole stars."

poledancing,393un3,SupermansLois,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:49:43 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like you're depending on your tendons/bones to hold you up in certain moves. I used to get shooting pains in my forearms as well, but I realized that I wasn't engaging as much muscle as I should and I worked on building up strength to hold myself up. Maybe that will help!"
poledancing,393un3,Battlecatbaby,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:27:30 2015 UTC,"For the forearm pain during carousel I assume it's in your lower arm and you're using a bracket grip? If so, it's because you're over-extending the joint in your wrist, placing too much pressure on the extensor muscles there; my instructor makes us always point our index finger downwards on that hand so you keep your wrist aligned properly and can't overextend it.  If you're keeping your wrist solid like that, you shouldn't experience any pain, and if you do get that shooting pain, stop immediately and try again - last thing you want is a sprained or torn forearm muscle or worse, a broken radius or ulna!"
poledancing,393un3,bluemojito,3,Tue Jun 9 03:44:59 2015 UTC,"See this is what worries me about learning pole at home, those small things like pointing the index finger are never talked about."
poledancing,393un3,Wildernessinabox,2,Tue Jun 9 04:31:18 2015 UTC,"My instructor actually had a student who'd previously taught herself at home (she'd used a lot of the videos available, StudioVeena, etc.) and said she was fairly solid because she watched them extremely closely, taking note of hand placement, how far/close to the pole they were standing, things like that. If you're planning to self-teach, use those online resources (a lot is free!) and scrutinize them so you can make sure you're staying strong and safe in your tricks/spins."
poledancing,393un3,bluemojito,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:46:39 2015 UTC,I do extend my finger on all of my moves with a bracket grip. I find it gives me a better grip! Is there any supports that I could wear to help with the pain?
poledancing,393un3,angelagabbie,2,Tue Jun 9 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure about supports, but it sounds like you can work on some extra conditioning.  My favorite conditioning exercise for bracket grip is really simple but pretty indicative of your strength in that grip. Hold the pole in bracket grip, stand on your tippy toes and try to come off the ground just by lifting your toes. Once that's easy, a more difficult variation is to lift legs into straddle."

poledancing,391y0t,Barbag,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:21:43 2015 UTC,Perhaps not for everyday use but if you have somewhere important to go and need to cover them try to color correct it and then use some concealer and lots of translucent powder so it doesn't transfer into your clothes or anything

Just be aware that your legs will be darker than the rest of your body unless you use it all over (I did at said club and it worked fabulously but was a bit ""Twilight vampire sparkle"" in sunlight). You can also mix the tan with lotion to make it lighter if it's too dark for you.    If you're just going out, then I recommend tights, pantyhose, or thigh highs. Just be aware that nude colors will still show the bruising underneath.    edit: spelling"

poledancing,38szkv,MyMuddyEyes,2,Sat Jun 6 15:41:27 2015 UTC,"Awesome way to train ayesha strength!  Nice work, that's a lot of reps.  Any tips for the handspring?  I've got a solid ayesha, but I cannot for the life of me kick up into it.  I've been working on it for a while without seeming to make progress, so I'm looking for tips that might put me over the edge.  Only CCW I see is your bottom elbow.  It looks like it's bending the wrong way slightly.  Can you keep avoid locking that elbow out, maybe by keeping a tiny bend in it?  It'll be kinder on the joint in the long run."
poledancing,38szkv,girl-replica,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:55:29 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks :D  Yeah, I see what you mean about the bottom elbow. I guess I'm overdoing it just trying to keep myself up there. I have seen tutorials and things saying that you should have a bit of a bend in that elbow but it's so hard to tell what you're doing with so many other things going on!  As for handspring tips, something which really helped me was placing my hands a bit lower. I was trying to put them a bit too high up when I first started trying it, but it was so much easier when my instructor told me to try it further down. Her other big tip is to put your head down. It's so tempting to look up to see if your legs are up yet, but it's easier to get them to go up in the first place if the rest of you is pointing down. I don't know if that helps you or not, but it's all I can think of right now!"

poledancing,38q63b,elle-o-saurus,6,Fri Jun 5 22:05:03 2015 UTC,"Towel exercises are perfect for this. Take a dish towel and lay it out flat on the floor. Use the toes from one foot to grab and pull the towel in small increments to one side, and then back again to straighten it out. Repeat with the other foot. Then, after doing this laterally, do this horizontally by scrunching the towel to your heels with your toes (you can do this with both feet simultaneously) This is great to do while watching TV or on the computer because it's pretty mindless."

poledancing,38ngtq,mrsdowney89,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:26:30 2015 UTC,"One of the most important parts of holding this move is actually two parts. Part one is to kinda stick your butt out (sinking back into your hips like you said). The second half of that is counter balancing with your legs. Your legs have to go back over the pole enough to balance your body out so you don't fall backwards. A great way to actually understand what that would look like is to sit down on the floor in a straddle with the pole in front of you. Grab the pole like you would when you're upside down and position your legs in front of you closer in so your calfs are now on the opposite side of the pole. That's the position your legs need to be in, in order to hold the handspring. Hope that helps :)"

Princess grip is done by having the straight arm on the same side as the shoulder on which the pole rests. I think it's a safer position for the outer shoulder.  Also try to practice the regular cup grip, it feels scarier because you can't hang on your arm, but it's harder to transition to it once you got too used to princess grip. :)"
poledancing,38jphz,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:56:12 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I can see what you mean - I think that's an accident, not intentional - I practiced it like you said the first times. I also practiced my cup grip during the lesson, and I can do it - I just find that I tend to end up in a hurtful position on my shoulder easier that way. :) But I'll definitely practice both - and thanks for pointing out the grip thing - it's definitely not on purpose, it was the last try for that class, and I think I just mixed them up somehow, but it's good to be aware of. :)"

poledancing,38b3vd,kitsunenaomi,8,Wed Jun 3 01:50:01 2015 UTC,"One of the first things some of my instructors teach on spin pole it how to control your speed based on how close or far you are from the pole. Spin into a basic fireman on spin mode and then pull your body up and in toward the pole, you will suddenly start spinning very fast. now push you body back out and down and you will slow down. Stick your arm or leg out and you will slow down even more. Experiment with that a little bit. It can have a nice dramatic effect to alter spin speed while doing a spin or trick sequence.  Another thing is that you need to get used to starting your spins more slowly, you don't need nearly as much momentum to go into a spin on spin mode. I see so many people who are new to spin mode try to launch into a spin with the same force they would use on static, they end up spinning way too fast, get dizzy and lose control. You really only need the slightest push to get the spin going.   Another thing to remember is to not rush through poses too quickly. Part of what makes spin pole easy is that you can hold certain poses for longer while your audience gets a 360 view and doesn't get bored and even though to you it feels like you might be sitting in that pose for too long, it still looks really interesting and dynamic to the audience. Seriously, practice holding certain poses for maybe 2 or 3 complete turns."
poledancing,38b3vd,baller_unicorn,2,Wed Jun 3 03:46:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this. It took me a long time to figure out that you don't need to push off fast at all to get a controlled spin. I basically forced myself to keep my pole on spin for a long period of time when I wanted to learn it, and at first I would only be able to do a couple of spins without getting dizzy. I got immune to the dizziness after a couple of weeks. Right now I still find it difficult to hold the poses long enough. It always feels too long when I'm doing it, then when I look back at the recording I realize I could have held it twice as long for a nicer effect."
poledancing,38b3vd,Cupcake1964,4,Wed Jun 3 22:59:20 2015 UTC,"Remember to spot when you're spinning! I think that will help. On static you're constantly changing your grip strength to speed up or slow down your body movement. In contrast, on spinning your grip stays fairly constant and firm (because you don't want to fly off!) but you change how close or far away your body is to the pole to affect the speed of the spin. I hope those tips are helpful!"
poledancing,38b3vd,MyMiniCheesecake,3,Wed Jun 3 03:28:20 2015 UTC,"Yes this! Many of the basic spin classes I've taken have started with practicing momentum control. Start by doing a single climb onto the pole and practice speeding up by bringing your body closer to the pole and slowing down by sitting away from the pole.  Dirdy Birdy on youtube is a huge spin-pole inspiration for me and her tutorials are great. :)  As for motion sickness, it will likely happen and is something you just need to get used to. Try spotting or staring at something that's spinning with you like the pole or your hands on the pole. Another way to help is to do a couple spins in the opposite direction - so if you're spinning clockwise, do a couple counter-clockwise spins. I've also heard chewing on some bits of ginger helps with nausea."
poledancing,38b3vd,angelagabbie,3,Wed Jun 3 18:28:59 2015 UTC,i actually find it much easier to move on a spin pole. strength moves can more or less be done the same you just have to desensitize yourself to the dizzy aspect. For spins your just holding on with your hands and doing the motions without having to actually propel yourself forward or backwards. if you're having trouble gaining spin swing a leg out and forward and then go into your spin of choice. hope that makes sense.
poledancing,38b3vd,Hatbearingoctopus,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:18:39 2015 UTC,"I think I know what you mean. Maybe I need to figure out more combos then?   Speaking of dizziness, desensitizing is something I need to work on. It is getting to me haha!"

The smaller shape you make, the easier it should be to hold it stable: think about how hard an iron x is! If your legs are in closer to your body, it'll be easier to hold than with your feet up on the pole.

poledancing,37yh4z,Mansinthe,3,Sun May 31 18:10:27 2015 UTC,"This link has a nice tutorial. The main thing about it that I'm noticing has to go with her torso placement. She has one long line from her bottom hand through her tailbone -- kind of dropping the butt to provide some counter weight against the top arm. I can see this line in both of your videos as well, but I think the butt could drop a little more. Additionally, the woman in the video reaches through her feet in a way that reminds me of how to coach a successful chopper - I wonder if that applied here as well?  Looking at your legs, it looks like the leg on the same side as your lower arm is most comfortable releasing first -- what if you try releasing the other leg first? That might help keep the right balanced left-to-right, creating kind of a spiral reaching through the body.  I'm just spit-balling, not sure if any of these questions or observations will be helpful... But I hope something works! I hope you post a successful follow-up! :)"

I always remind myself to do everything slow and controlled, but when I try, I feel like I can not control my butt movements at all... It's really weird I'm telling you.  My EG Aysha as of now is really stable and I worked on getting the legs more parallel to the ground. I also tried to go into the TG Aysha from the Extended Butterfly (take the extended leg back and release the other from the pole), but with no success...

Luckily for me, cracks aren't uncommon in our ceilings and it's pretty superficial, so my mom hasn't noticed.  Anyway, yeah, try to be as sure as possible that you have the joist. If you're having trouble finding it by knocking, you can try covering a hammer with a washcloth and gently tapping. Also, marking the ceiling and floor definitely helps (I recently had mine in a dorm and had to take it down a few times). After doing it by myself a few times, I can get mine up in about 20 minutes.

poledancing,37uqzx,Arcsis,3,Sat May 30 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"I would use a stud-finder to locate them and mark where they are with a pencil. When you're installing the pole, turn the wrench slowly after the top contacts the ceiling. If you start hearing any sounds stop and reassess the position. Once you get it up in the correct position, ensure the pencil marks are still accurate or make new ones. This way, you will know exactly where to put it next time."

I called xpole & spoke to Heydi. She gave me some ideas for dealing with my xpert.   There was a big plant hook left in the ceiling by the previous tenant so that seemed like a logical place to start. She has me begin to tighten the Pole very slowly, and watch the ceiling for buckling. If there's not a joist there, it moves quite a bit with low pressure. I eventually found a spot that was sturdy & in a good part of the room.   I'd recommend calling xpole. Their customer service is really good. Heydi was awesome!"
poledancing,37udo2,polesloth,5,Sat May 30 13:55:09 2015 UTC,Are you trying to lift into chopper with straight legs? That's a pretty advanced strength move. Try tucking into a ball first and then splaying over into your chopper. If you're already doing that then think about shooting your toes down to the floor and look behind you as you're inverting. Looking up at your feet tends to throttle the turnover.
poledancing,37udo2,lentil5,1 point,Sat May 30 15:39:21 2015 UTC,I've experimented both ways. I'm mostly tucking my knees first and trying to extend out. I have about the same success either way. That's a good tip about looking behind. I feel like I'm tensing my neck and looking at my feet. Thank you!
poledancing,37udo2,Scarlet_Night,2,Sat May 30 20:40:03 2015 UTC,"Well definitely watch a bunch of videos and note the way people are positioned right before they get into the move. I also took forever trying to do this (well 5 weeks, practicing every day), and only by the 4 week noticed that a) my whole body isn't supposed to be in front of the pole, just my hips, and b) once your knees are, keep moving and and look back at the wall.   But really, carefully watch a few videos, a few times each. Choose ones with good form where the person doesn't kick into the position because that's not good. Eventually the how-to does click with a ""woah, duh"" and you find yourself being able to do it more easily. :)  Also before getting into the move just practice tucking your knees up a few times on each side to warm up your core and arms before  the move."

Fear is what holds me back in all my moves, it helped me a lot to get into a basic invert and then lower my legs into the chopper to get a ""feel"" for the position, so it wouldn't feel so crazy and scary to invert straight into it when I felt more familiar with it.

Congrats on finding the bravery, it took me forever to do that haha :)  I think the way your bottom hand is wrapped around the pole may be preventing you from getting more stability and prettier lines. Your hand should be facing the other way so that you can push away from the pole, rather than pulling on it. Not sure if I'm explaining it that well, but your bottom hand should look like this: http://www.poledance-paris.com/12_repertoire/images/planche02_fig17.jpg  When I was first learning, my instructor had me point my pointer finger down at the floor to remind me where my hand should be."

If it was, she'd be more stable and able to go further back with her other leg."

It's actually a drop to pike hip hold, then you hook the inside leg and extend into inside leg hang. Practice by lowering yourself slowly, getting the pole behind your extended arm, and engaging the abs pulling your legs close to your chest in a tight pike. When that's working for you then you can try lowering down most of the way and dropping the last 6 inches. Then a little higher, and so on and so forth. When you're comfortable with the dropping part it's just a matter of hooking the inside leg immediately after the pike hip hold to give the illusion that you dropped directly into an inside leg hang. I could make a sma tutorial video if you'd like. This is my favorite drop to teach! :)"

I know with X-poles, the locking mechanism can slip a bit over time. I've had my chrome X-pole since 2012, and sometimes it slips a bit if I swing a little too hard... and I've taken pretty good care of it over the years. It's also a pain in the butt to get the hex keys out and screw/unscrew to switch between modes, but Platinum Stages is literally just a pin you can drop in to hold the pole in place.   Just don't get stainless steel finish. It's made of greased weasels and butter, I swear."

(I prefer my brass for spinning, chrome for static.)  I owned a stainless Platinum Stages a while back, and it was soooo slippery that I could never find the motivation to actually use it, because I could never do anything on the #($*&@#$ thing.

It's just an extra minor hassle to fish out the hex keys, crouch down, and unscrew the two little nuts that hold pole in place to switch between spinning in static. With a Platinum Stages, you just pull the pin out or drop it in, takes literally less than a second."

It helped pull me out of my first bout of depression and helped relieve some anxiety as well.   I had moderate to severe depression with severe anxiety before I started pole dancing. I did not want to treat it with medication. I was told that exercise will help along with changes to diet and overall lifestyle. That's about the time I started pole dancing.  I started not because I thought it would help with the depression but because I thought it would be fun. It was unexpected what it ended up doing for my emotional state.  The sense of accomplishment I get from sticking a move for the first time is incredible. This is especially true if it's something that I've been struggling with. I feel like I'm flying when I'm spinning; it is so freeing. And I would have never dreamed of doing inverts 15 ft in the air before I started pole dancing. Now, I'm doing things that I never dreamed of doing and it feels so good!  At my studio, each class ends with a free dance. That is the best part for me because I can tap into whatever emotion I'm feeling - good or bad - and let it out in a safe environment of supportive, non-judgemental people.

Not top leg, then bottom leg.  -you need to work on your chopper in your invert. This is the reason you have to do that littler ooch to place your knee in your leg hangs. If you chopper all the way back you'll be able to get your leg high enough above your hand to place it right where it needs to go.  -overall be mindful of pointing your feet. You get really good height and extension in your candy cane but your feet were not pointed all the way. Same in your climbs. You are advanced so you can start climbing with both feet pointed instead of keeping the bottom one flexed.  Overall, you are doing great. Those are some long combos with hard stuff and it looks like your endurance is good. Cleaning is just perfecting those little details to make it perfect!"

I like 45mm -- it's a good in-between size. 45mm is great because it's easier for most people to grip with their hands, while still being big enough to do leg-based holds.  It's not a huge difference to switch back and forth between 45 and 50mm, in my opinion, so it won't hurt you if you ever have to go back to 50mm."

As others have said, it makes intermediate things like the layback easier, but makes things later on like the ayesha more difficult. My studio uses 38mm so I'm actually thinking of getting a 40mm next! But yes I believe 45mm is more standard."

poledancing,35oo5p,shinosai,4,Tue May 12 06:48:36 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the competition - at APC this year, level 4 dramatic was won by a male pole dancer competing against female pole dancers, so they were all pretty much thrown into one category regardless of gender. Not really an issue in that case.   I don't know about other competitions though. It probably won't matter, since pole is equal parts an art and a sport, and just because you may have a physical advantage from being born male, doesn't necessarily put you at an ""unfair"" advantage in terms of artistic expression/technique/whatever compared to any other pole dancer. If anything, it might be a disadvantage depending on your style, since it seems like the petite dancer/gymnast build is very, very favored in most womens' competitions.  Honestly, I feel like the main reason why they even have different categories for gender in pole is because usually men are usually stylistically different than women - they tend to focus more on the athletic/acrobatic aspect, like throwing out 7 fonjis in a row without breaking a sweat. Which isn't to say female pole dancers can't fonji, but usually you see less of an emphasis on that type of thing."

poledancing,35oo5p,Felisitea,3,Tue May 12 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"I always found the whole division between trans women and cis women to be pretty artificial when it comes to competition, to be honest. Every body's different! I'm a xx lady-bodied person who produces more testosterone than most women, and I could out lift a lot of women even before I started pole.  In my (admittedly limited) experience, the pole community seems to be pretty welcoming of lots of varities of people.  Good luck, and let us know how it went!"
poledancing,35oo5p,_Bia,3,Tue May 12 17:43:32 2015 UTC,"Agh, the fact you're even asking this points out trans inequality, even in a place as open and accepting as the pole community.

I find it a lot easier to be fluid and string moves together well on spin, even when there's extra momentum to overcome.

poledancing,35ly8z,jellunalu,2,Tue May 12 20:56:08 2015 UTC,"If your studio has stretching class take up those. If not, find a stretching DVD (Cleo's Rocking Legs and Abs, Fit&Bendy DVDs, Alethea's DVDs ... plenty to choose from which are geared towards pole dancers). It would be much better than coming up with your stretching routine right from the start because there's so much to more to it than a bucket list of stretches."
poledancing,35ly8z,ClockworkMagpie,2,Mon May 11 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"I think Wildernessinabox has shared the perfect video for you! Just remember not to overstretch, and never go 100% when stretching! Always take it back a notch so that you can still feel it, but you're not going to do any damage.  Stretching DVD's are also great! Cleo's Rockin' Legs and Abs is amazing! It takes you through strength building and then stretching at the end, and the strength building also incorporates an almost very light ballistic stretch so that you don't overstretch anything, but you do still feel it. I would recommend it to anyone looking to strengthen or gain flexibility!"
poledancing,35ka1m,MyMuddyEyes,3,Mon May 11 04:22:25 2015 UTC,"You should really start off with a few lessons if you can. It's hard to get the basics down without proper instruction, and it can be very frustrating if you can't do anything, which will make you feel like giving up. Even if you can't afford to take lessons long-term, you'll find that you will progress much quicker with an instructor showing you what you should be doing.  Also, you're likely sliding off the pole partly because new poles have a very slippery coating which takes a long time to break in (studio poles at classes will be already worn in and so easier to work with to get you started) and probably also because you've not got the proper grip down yet. Definitely invest in some lessons."
poledancing,35ka1m,smudgeprincess,3,Mon May 11 08:13:06 2015 UTC,"You'll want to do even just a few lessons to get the general flow of things. The first two or three are easily your most important as your instructor can show you proper technique and form. Likely is you're not engaging a lot of the right muscles and are struggling because of that rather than lack of strength.  Dizziness passes, I promise. I get more dizzy than anyone I've ever met (grr genetics) and even now I don't feel it anymore. Your brain just needs to get used to it.  But seriously invest in a few lessons, an instructor will be able to guide you and help you work to your ability."
poledancing,35ka1m,jellunalu,2,Mon May 11 10:28:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, take some live classes either privately or with a group. That way, you have an instructor there who can correct and teach you in the moment, rather than watching the video and hoping for the best. Additionally, they'll be able to teach you the proper grips, which muscles to engage, and what your end goal is for that particular trick or pose. Being in a class is hard enough, I'm not sure I'd do very well being self taught!   If you're worried about price, maybe consider doing drop ins or a punch pass or something so it won't break the bank and that you can get a feel of what a beginner should be doing. It'll be very worth it and you won't feel like you wasted your money."
poledancing,35ka1m,Wildernessinabox,1 point,Tue May 12 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda in the same boat. My goal is to do some intensive stretching for a few months and do pole conditioning for a month along with attempts at basic spins and go from there. That way I don't jump into anything too intense and get a chance to gain some flexibility/strength.  Try windex and water on your pole it might help remove the factory slip coating. It also sounds like you might be dehydrated, I get dizzy when I haven't eaten enough or drank enough water."

That might explain why you can lift at the gym but not do certain tricks. It could also be that you're using the wrong muscles when you do pole tricks and thus making it harder for yourself. I would recommend starting with basic spins so you can build up your pole muscles. There's a lot of spins that require more strength and energy than you'd think!"

Some people manage it, but I really needed professional instruction to teach me how to pole safely and with good form, which is really, really, really important if you want to progress and have longevity in the sport. I have known so many girls in the club who have pulled intercostal muscles throwing themselves into inverts, fucked up their shoulders from doing twisted-grip everything, or just plain have bad form because they just copy what they see other dancers do.

I swear my life flashes before my eyes when I do that one.)  Mostly the only thing that's helped me is time, which probably isn't what you want to hear, but for at least one move I was in more pain than other people because my technique was off and my knees weren't where they should have been. So maybe there's some tiny positioning problem you have that you can look into? But most likely I reckon you just have to wait it out and keep practising. Maybe practise with loud music when you're really angry one day? That can reduce pain slightly!"
poledancing,35cnw4,MyPigWaddles,2,Sat May 9 06:23:59 2015 UTC,"So here's what I've noticed when it comes to skin pain: the more skin contact you have, the more evenly the pain is dispersed across the skin, instead of having it localized in one area. It's much more manageable that way in my opinion. For moves such as crucifix, I make sure the whole front of my thigh, knee, shin, and foot, as well as the whole back of my other leg are gripping the pole. This helps me feel a LOT more secure and seems to hurt quite a bit less.   And maybe this is bad advice, but if there is a day that I know I want to really nail a couple moves, I will take an ibuprofen. I don't think it actually takes all the pain away, but it does at least kind of act as a placebo. I tell myself ""I won't have any pain today because the ibuprofen!"" And I just give it my all, and I find it really helps.   Last but not least, the pain fades eventually. Bodies are incredible things that adapt to what they are trained to do. Just give it time."

Yes, inner thigh pain sucks... I know in a few months I'll have the joy of reconditioning my tender thigh skin ALL OVER again. I don't remember struggling THAT much with thigh pain though, probably because I was always so excited about practicing and working on new moves, that usually I didn't notice the pain until the next day, and that's typically more muscle soreness/bruising. I do remember hating the superman for like a year, because that one is especially a bitch on the inner thighs. The only way I got over that was just time - I didn't practice a superman EVERY time I got on the pole, but I ended up in one often enough that eventually I stopped noticing the pain.  /u/take5hi has a good point on the friction versus pressure thing. If the thigh pain is the main thing holding you back from a gemini/scorpio, you might want to shift your main point of contact from your thigh to your side ""pocket"". It is entirely possible (albeit very difficult) to do an inside leg hang even while wearing leggings as long as your midriff is exposed, which shows that the inner thigh grip isn't always the most important aspect."

I couldn't even do a basic invert on my right side for months on end because it burned too much. I even went to the doctor because of it and she said I was fine, no serious damage.  I hate medication, but once I took an ibuprofen about 45 min before class, the pain went away enough so that I could do holds on both sides! Pole burn not only causes skin issues but also may cause inflammation underneath the skin which the ibuprofen reduces. Seriously, taking that one pill has taken away the pain. Thanks modern medicine!   I also apply lavender oil, aloe vera gel and ice to the affected areas DAILY to minimize the burn and encourage the skin to heal.

She's sooo strong!  She's a volley ball fiend and is one of two women on an all male soft ball team.  But...I gave her all kinds of grip for gifts: mighty grip, dry hands even the sticky firm grip.  Unfortunately, she gave up.  Happy to read you've explored other methods.  I've had problems from time to time.  For me it depends on so much: type of pole, climate and if I don't exfoliate often, my skin becomes dry and slippery."

My hands and feet, though, just pure chaos and entropy. But it gets better now thankfully!"

poledancing,358rxt,artistchick2008,6,Fri May 8 01:31:18 2015 UTC,"Your 101 class is beginners but you're doing inverts? My beginner classes are mostly stretching and basic spins and body awareness--i would not be discouraged by total beginners doing inverts! It took several months before I was able to do a (sloppy) invert, I needed a lot more awareness of my body that I simply didnt have, as well as strength in places I didnt when I began either. How long have you been doing this 'beginners' class for? It takes everyone a different amount of time to get different moves--many girls even struggle with swings due to body awareness, grip, etc. You should definitely measure your progress against yourself, and not where the other 101'ers in class are at :)  I cant give any tips on size, though. The larger girls in my classes have typically excelled faster then me. We have a few particularly skinny girls that have a big challenge as the bone-on-pole is quite painful to them (and is for my bony areas) and some cant grip nearly as well as larger girls due to thin limbs, larger spaces between their thighs, etc."
poledancing,358rxt,badlcuk,2,Fri May 8 02:27:34 2015 UTC,"GIRL ( I assume you're a girl too). This was me. I'm a bigger girl as well and it took me 10 classes or so to climb. I remember going to an open pole session to only practice climbing and I still couldn't get it. Then one day in class, it just happened. I was overjoyed! Now I can forearm climb, side climb, and I'm working on cleaning up my no legs climb.  It took me a full year to get an invert. My studio makes us practice the steps needed to do inverted V so there was no chance to kick up to basic invert making learning the invert much harder. I found that exposing your midriff helps A LOT as a fulcrum point by which you can pivot up. It also helps not to have sweaty underarms as you need to grip tightly at the start of the invert. Helped a lot to have my hands at head height or even a bit lower as you then have less to pull up.   For bigger ladies or ladies with booty and hips, getting our hips up once we're in an inverted v is tough! I'm still working on perfecting that. But it's not impossible. You WILL climb someday. You WILL invert someday. Keep practicing and using the tips in this thread."
poledancing,358rxt,fotcfan1,8,Thu May 14 15:50:56 2015 UTC,"While I'm on the smaller side, I can 100% understand your troubles since I'm in a similar position.   I too felt that a 101 class was really like a 102 and felt so out of place. I checked the schedule afterwards just to make sure I was in the right place.   It took me five 101 classes to nail the climb. Turned out, the initial instructor did not teach me the proper leg to pole placement. It wasn't until that fifth class when I was taught the proper way and I nailed it. I was thrilled.   I still cannot invert to save my life, let alone anything that comes with it, but I believe that I need to build up my arm and core strength.  The most I can do successfully are spins. (But those are super fun, so no complaints!)  I guess that my advice (for both of us!) would be to build up your arm and core strength. Conditioning and basic calisthenics will be your friend here.  Also, work on your flexibility. Invest in a foam PVC roller; this will help with the hip flexors (you can grab one on Amazon for not that much) Also: yoga!  See if your studio offers flexibility training classes; these will often integrate the pole as a tool to help.   Does your studio have different instructors for the 101s? If so, take a class with each instructor to find one whose teaching style works! That's what I did and, it took a while, but my current instructor is phenomenal!   Some people take two 101s and others, like me, take six! While you shouldn't compare your progress to other students (as in, oh she's climbing to the ceiling and I'm here on the ground), you could look to them as a goal! That's what motivates me. I look to the back of the class, see one girl crushing splits and I use that as a goal.   Everyone is different!   Don't give up! It does take so so much time and everyone learns at their own pace! One day it will all just click!  Good luck!"

I've been weight lifting for the past year, so I guess that has helped me some, and I got a foam roller when I was training for my first 5k, and I love how great it is for stretching.  I signed up for a flexibility class tonight, and I've got more 101s next week :) Hopefully I'll get the hang of this stuff soon enough. I intend to keep going obviously, but it helps me a lot knowing that it could just be my leg placement thats preventing me from getting up properly"
poledancing,358rxt,PinnaCochleada,3,Fri May 8 19:14:54 2015 UTC,"Something you should ALWAYS remember is that some people are more inclined to pole than the others. Not everybody gets pole at the start. The big women you see doing amazing things may be more inclined to pole than other big women and find it easier to pick up. I teach a beginners class and I've seen girls who weigh literally 100lbs struggle with the basic climb as well. But the harder you work at it, the sweeter the success :) don't despair!"
poledancing,358rxt,stelur,2,Fri May 8 02:25:27 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about your size! Really. I know it can be hard to shut that off, but just think about your strength. If you've never been a weightlifter or a gymnast or a dancer, it's going to be hard regardless. I'm very petite and it took me longer than a month to learn to climb, I'll tell you that much! Work on building strength and don't worry about how others are progressing. Some people are naturals or have a solid background and some have to work for it. And I'm of the camp that studios should never teach inversions to beginners anyway. Just enjoy the journey, no matter how long it takes you!"
poledancing,358rxt,Wildernessinabox,2,Fri May 8 02:45:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I try not to let my size bother me, but it gets hard sometimes, in all aspects of life. I started weight lifting in 2013 and then ballet and hip hop in 2014, so I guess I could have a worse background for pole, but still a long way to go. Maybe by the end of the month I'll be able to get my climb. Thanks for the encouragement!"
poledancing,358rxt,lypiphera117,2,Fri May 8 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"Jeez that sounds like an intense class, most pole guides and such I have found recommend doing 4-5 weeks of solid pole conditioning and stretching before even getting to basic spins. Also something i've noticed is that you can't compare yourself to others in this sport, some just progress faster than others for seemingly no reason.  I would think building up your strength through stretching and conditioning would be better than doing stuff that's potentially out of your skill level and potentially injuring yourself.  So breaking it down   set your own goals don't compare yourself to others keep practicing have fun   But most of all push through any issues you have, the payoff will be so worth it."
poledancing,358rxt,DorienGrais,2,Fri May 8 06:27:13 2015 UTC,"I'm heavier, too! I've been doing this for three years and I still can't invert (though I've learned to do all sorts of amazing things with my body, mostly stuff like shoulder rolls, handstands, and splits), and the climb took me some weeks as well. Let me just say - four weeks is very little in the grand scheme of things, so definitely don't get frustrated by your rate of progress!  Do you have a dance background at all? I was never athletic but did have more of a foundation in dance, so one of the things I did was start going to the stilletto classes at my studio. The instructor has you do a routine. There are some inversions/climbs, but focuses more on the ""dancy"" aspects of pole dancing. The instructor always has a ""Plan B"" for the girls who can't do inversions.  If you still want to focus more on the climbing/inverting aspects of pole dancing, I think one thing to do is work on your strength, especially in your biceps and core.  Another thing: what are you wearing to class? More clothes = less friction = harder to stick to the pole, and when you're a beginner (and even when you're not), you really want every point of contact you can get. I was extremely body-conscious when I started, and was all about capris and workout tees, but after a while, I found that booty shorts and sports bras were just the way to go."
poledancing,358rxt,larafrompinkpony,1 point,Fri May 8 15:43:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Its nice to hear from a heavier girl. I do have a bit of dance background, sort of. I started taking ballet and hip hop last year, and while I'm not great, I still love class.  Currently, I've been wearing booty shorts and a form fitting work out top. I've surprisingly never felt self conscious wearing it, which I thought I would, until the last class I went to and this girl kept giving me dirty looks, especially while I was attempting different moves. I think that was the biggest part on why I got so discouraged. I don't think I've gotten a look quiet that horrible from someone since maybe the 4th grade when I was the new kid in school"
poledancing,358rxt,meowjanjan,1 point,Fri May 8 20:06:25 2015 UTC,"Ignore the 'looks'.  I'm a smaller dancer and a placing competitor; I still get the 'looks' every now and then.  Also, there are LOTS of tricks I can't do.  And I've been at it for years!  As for climbing: for some reason, that was the first thing I ever did.  Without instruction.  I've always had pretty strong arms before poling. I used my arms to climb at first but kept my body close to the pole and gripped with my upper thighs.  Not the best form, but it's how I taught myself.  Biceps help a lot.  I also started by 'jump starting' my climb on the pole.  Sort of like hopping on to the pole for my first climb and going from there.  Bad form aside, if you can get up there regardless of form, your instructor can help you smooth it out."
poledancing,358rxt,Arcsis,2,Mon May 11 18:59:53 2015 UTC,"Everyone moves at a different pace! Really, that's the mantra you need to keep in mind. I could invert before I could spin, but I was originally self-taught (and ended up having to go get a lot of professional instruction to fix all the bad habits I acquired along the way.)  I'll give it to you straight - it is definitely harder to progress when you are bigger. It is NOT impossible for you to eventually get just as good and do tricks though, as you've seen in those Youtube videos. However, it will definitely take more strength for you to do the same moves, and you have more physics to overcome. I'm currently pregnant, and even with a 20 pound weight gain, I can DEFINITELY tell a difference in stamina and how hard it is for me to climb a pole. I tried to do a shoulder mount a month ago, and it amazed me how I couldn't get my hips over my head anymore because of the way my weight is distributed now... and this is a move I could deadlift and have had down pat for years.   Be kind to yourself and give yourself time! It is normal to struggle. While you might have to work harder, you can definitely still get there.   I originally trained at a studio with a lot of bigger ladies, and having ""pole meat"" is definitely an advantage for some moves. Does your studio pole with shoes? I found the way that my old studio had things structured was helpful - shoes were mandatory, and boots are helpful for helping you stick during climbs. As you advanced though, the instructors started limiting your footwear (ie, you could only wear ankle boots for this class, or at the very highest levels, we were going completely barefoot.) A pair of slightly sticky thigh-high PVC fuck-me boots help a lot. (They will also make you super sweaty, so maybe wear some long socks underneath too.)"
poledancing,358rxt,jellunalu,1 point,Fri May 8 15:51:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I just need to keep reminding myself that every one is different. Some days its just harder to remember than others. Since my heaviest, I've lost 25 pounds, so maybe if I just stay on course, more weight will come off and I'll be better at lifting myself. No one at my studio wears shoes. I think its because the studio wants to push the fitness side more, which I will say def appealed to me, but I kinda want to try a class with them at some point to see if it makes a difference for me"

Afterwards is when you should be stretching to really relax your muscles since they're warm and you will get the most out of stretching then. Make sure to stretch after AS SOON as you're done with your pole routine otherwise your muscles will begin to cool down. Also if you can control your room temp, keep it on the warmer side."

After my classes is when I do the stretching most people think about, like bending over and reaching for your toes, which is more about stretching specific muscles for flexibility in those areas."
poledancing,350i4j,StrobesNQueens,3,Wed May 6 04:51:10 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I just finished a course on nutrition that had a fitness component.  There are two types of stretching: dynamic (where you stretch by moving and using the full range of motion in the joints) and static (where you stretch by pushing your muscles into one position and holding it).  Before your workout, use dynamic stretching. This helps warm up the muscles and joints. After your workout, use static stretching. This is much safer, as you're less likely to injure yourself in static stretches once your muscles are warmed up."
poledancing,3502lg,Arcsis,3,Tue May 5 23:58:23 2015 UTC,"Nothing. A skin tear that exposes new skin should be left alone. Put neosporin/vaseline on it and band-aide it up. Try to stay off the pole. The pole WILL rip off the band-aide & irritate/infect the skin tear. Your pole practice wouldn't be as satisfactory but it's better to let your body heal. If you insist on poling, use strong medical/sport tape with a cotton pad on the injury.  As you continue poling, your skin will get tougher and you'll get calluses that help you stay on better :)"

poledancing,3502lg,Miffieee,2,Fri May 8 00:34:42 2015 UTC,Just one of the things we pole dancers have to accept as a trade off for doing awesome tricks. You won't get calluses on the part of your skin tear. You'll mostly likely start seeing where your middle finger meets the palm. Wear them with pride!
poledancing,3502lg,jamielicious,1 point,Fri May 8 06:59:03 2015 UTC,I usually cover the tear with a band aid or medical tape.  On the finger isn't so bad because the band aid wraps all the way around and doesn't come off very easily.  Just remember that the bit of fabir will affect your grip a bit.
poledancing,34ze2u,Wildernessinabox,3,Tue May 5 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"I warm up a bit before I start poling and do my heavy stretching after.  I switch it up so I don't get bored, but it's usually a mixture of different core exercises that I try to do as quickly as I can to get my heart going.  I then warm up my arms and shoulders with some quick stretches and arm circles.  This isn't the world's most thorough warm up, so I'll do extra targeted stretching if I'm about to work on something that's particularly hard on particular muscles.  From there I just start slow.  My chrome pole needs its own warm up, so a few inverted crucifixes, caterpillar climbs, and assisted handstands help me finish warming up and get the temperature of my pole up enough that I can grip it well.  I do my flex stretching after I pole since that's when my muscles are warmest and most ready for it.  As for conditioning, I'll do it if I'm struggling to get a particular move, and I'll tailor what I do to that move.  Right now it's cup grip hangmans and dragon flags for me, on the long road towards the cup grip lift/handspring and the aerial shoulder mount.

poledancing,34jd1d,monvca,2,Fri May 1 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"You have some background in yoga, so I believe it will not be so hard for you when it comes about strength and flexibility. I suggest that you go to classes and take your time to see what it is more difficult for you and then you decided what to do. I have no background in dance or whatever and I only take classes once a week because of the time, but I have a pole at home.  The other advices I can give to you is:   don't rush into your movements, observe your body and do everything with security pole dance can be harsh sometimes because it will give you bruises and the friction with the pole is not good, but if you persist, all of this will pass with the time. So don't give up because of this! if you are going to dance, record it. It is great to see how much you evolved with time.  try not to compare yourself with other girls. I know it is easier to say than done (I do it all of the time), but everyone has its own time and its own way to do things.    And I hope you enjoy it! Good class!!"

poledancing,34jd1d,yumdonuts,2,Sat May 2 02:21:49 2015 UTC,I think for the time being it's best to take classes - the time you spend in those classes will build the appropriate strength for future moves.

It sounds like a combination of not quite having the strength in your hands and forearms (but only for now -- you'll get there!) and sweat.  These I understand very much.  The strength part you just have to continue to work on.  For the sweat, you gotta find that magical combination that works for you.  Try all the grips you can until you find your perfect fit.  For me, I wash my hands half an hour before pole, then apply Dry Hands and Tite Grip.  I have to reapply fairly often during class, but hey, it works!  Keep experimenting and practicing.

My instructor actually suggested it after a few weeks, but it didn't work for me because I apparently used it wrong. I didn't know that you weren't supposed to rub it into your hands; rather you should let it dry. I can stay on better now (maybe also because I've grown stronger since then), but my hands sweat like crazy, and I have to constantly reapply Dry Hands. Also, try some weightlifting gloves. I find that those on top of my Dry Hands are especially helpful for climbing and other moves that require staying on the pole for a longer period of time."
poledancing,34a6ok,mercuryfur,3,Wed Apr 29 15:03:13 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it wouldn't be safe to do a pressure mount (x-pole/platinum stage) because you risk punching through the thin layer and knocking the pole out, ruining your ceiling, and potentially injuring yourself. I had a lil minx pole in my old apartment that drilled into the stud in the ceiling (one bolt), but I think your teacher is right, you would need to put a hole in it either way. Check out the lil' Mynx rotator and see what your teacher thinks, or if you know someone who does construction... but I would suggest signing up for extra pole plays or working on conditioning at home until you can put a pole up safely. Not worth breaking your face or having to fix your ceiling more than once. You could also do an X-Stage, which doesn't attach to the ceiling."
poledancing,34a6ok,codenameisduchess,3,Wed Apr 29 15:42:28 2015 UTC,"And I will say, my brother totally put a hole in my ceiling by playing on the pole and causing it to ""bow"" because he was too heavy. The mount spun and basically cut a hole in the ceiling. DO NOT LET PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT GRAVITY OR POLE use your pole, you will end up puttying and praying to get your deposit back at the very LEAST (fortunately, I'm good with a putty knife)."
poledancing,34a6ok,codenameisduchess,3,Wed Apr 29 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"It depends on what type of pole you are installing.  If you are installing a non permanent one (one that you can attach and detach without drilling holes in walls) you will need some sort of support beam or joist.  You can find them by knocking around on your ceiling (if you are familiar with the sound difference) or using a stud finder.  Chances are you have some sort of beam or joist somewhere in the ceiling (right above the dry wall) but you may just be unaware of where it is exactly.  If by chance you cannot find a support beam or joist, I do not recommend using a non permanent pole.  You need the support beam/joist for the pole to stay stable (and to be safe)."
poledancing,34a6ok,XemiTalks,3,Wed Apr 29 15:52:13 2015 UTC,"Sounds like she has got a gypsum roof, which is pretty common when there's isolation space up there. Gypsum can be brittle, and may therefore crack under the pressure of a non permanent pole (like the X-Pole). This may not only give her trouble with her landlord, but may also weaken the mounting and cause the pole to slip.   I would not recommend mounting a pole on gypsum, because it's rarely mounted directly on the beams.   No matter what you do, and if my assumptions about your roof is wrong, use one of those measuring tools to check for the beams. :)  Safe poling! <3"
poledancing,34a6ok,FoxxedOut,3,Wed Apr 29 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, like what other people are saying, definitely doesn't sound safe for pressure-mounted poles.

They're pricier and heavy to lug around, but allows you to have a pole without making changes to your ceiling - bonus: you can pack it up and go anywhere with it!

My first class was only 60 minutes, and they did not throw a bunch of moves at me- my studio actually has a ""pole virgins"" class that everyone is required to take before they can move on to beginner 1. I learned how to walk, kick around, ""get up sexy,"" and I think spin one or two different ways on my first day. You should NOT invert on you first day, especially if you are not sure how strong you are! My studio does not teach inverts until beginner 2.   Although your first day was a little crazy, you should go back at least once or twice more and see if you settle in nicely! You may be surprised with what you remember! Good luck!"
poledancing,343ctj,Stuvs,3,Tue Apr 28 04:26:39 2015 UTC,"As an instructor, I taught beginner/intro classes pretty similar to what you described. To be honest... not my most favorite way to go about teaching. (But that might be more my personal preference as an instructor.)  Our intro/newbie classes were 75 minutes long, and we spent about 10-15 minutes on warming up and stretches. After that, we were expected to teach ""the pole walk"", a ""sexy move"" (usually a body roll), a strength move (usually some sort of pull up type thing), and one or two spins. If the class was smaller (~10 people or less) I could usually get two spins in, if it was a bigger class, we usually did just 1 spin. For each of these moves, I would demonstrate the move to show what it should look like, then demonstrate again more slowly while breaking it down, and then have the students practice on their own a few times while I walked around and made corrections. Then we were supposed to teach a little routine, though it didn't have to be 4 minutes long - just something to knit the moves together. I usually had enough time to run through it 2-3 times, and NO, you were not expected to know/memorize the choreography! Usually I did it with the students, and they just followed along the best they could.   As an instructor, it was frustrating for me because I got feedback that my classes were ""too hard"". I do NOT expect my students to get every move on their first try, or even their first class! Pole is not like step aerobics, where you're taking a movement you're already familiar with (stepping up and down) and doing it at a different tempo. Pole is a totally new form of movement for most people. But anyway, I think that students tend to get frustrated easily at the beginning, and that's why a lot of folks who come in, end up not coming back.   I also don't advocate teaching inversions at the first class. Some people are ready for it very quickly, but most aren't. I wish we had the freedom to teach individually, but the ""level up"" system is the next best thing we have. Unfortunately, people are always super eager to learn inverts because they're so cool, so if you don't teach them, they will find somebody else who will!"
poledancing,343ctj,larafrompinkpony,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:49:30 2015 UTC,"On one hand I'm so happy to hear I'm not alone, but on the other it's frustrating to hear that starting is a discouraging experience across the board! I'd be so happy to spend a class practicing pole walk plus one spin until I do it really, really well.   As an instructor,  how much time do you advocate spending in class vs. practicing alone in one month? The studios here push for beginners to take four classes per month, each of which would teach different moves and spins."
poledancing,343ctj,larafrompinkpony,3,Tue Apr 28 01:05:36 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a problem of economics for the studio. When you have a class of anywhere from 10-20 people, where some people are TOTAL newbies and don't have any previous experience and some have been to this class before, you don't want any of your students to be bored, either. You also can't invest all your time on one student helping them perfect that move, since everyone else is going to get restless... and some people just are NOT going to get it that day. They more they try, the more tired they get, the more discouraging it becomes. Usually 3-4 good efforts on each side is about as good as you're going to get.  It's hard to strike a good balance between not making things too hard for the complete newbies and still remain challenging for the non-virgins :P And to be honest - you aren't going to master a spin on your first class, and some people find it more encouraging to have a variety of moves to work on, because some things come easier than others. I personally would feel pretty crappy if ""the move of the day"" was just something I absolutely could NOT get, and would feel better if I could just kind of half-ass two or three moves that I can kind-of get (and then perfect on my own time.)  Four classes a month seems pretty reasonable... for a beginner, you don't really need much practice outside of the studio (in my opinion)... as you get more advanced, you might want to get a pole for use a home if it's something you enjoy enough to pursue further. Honestly when I first started pole, I loved it so much that I tried to go in 2-3 times a week if I could make it, but once a week was pretty typical. Really, you'll pick it up a lot faster than you might think. I tend to think of the first 3 classes as ""weed-out"" classes... usually by then you'll know if pole is for you. If you don't find yourself addicted by then, pole probably just isn't your thing!"
poledancing,343ctj,roserouge,3,Tue Apr 28 01:29:00 2015 UTC,My studio does things in series-type classes for progressions. This method works best for me because everyone in my classes are in the same boat and it was fun getting to go through levels with many of the same girls.
poledancing,343ctj,joiceiamara,3,Tue Apr 28 06:58:01 2015 UTC,"My class lasts one hour and then, the girls who feel comfortable, can do a freestyle while girls for the next class warm up.   My studio is small and we have 5 poles, so classes only support this number. Because of that, we don't have classes for different levels and my instructor can take care of everyone of us individually.   I am on the intermediate level but I have class with the newbies and it always the same. Warm up 10 minutes, walking around the pole, spins and floorwork. Because we only have 5 people per class, she can see if the girls is struggling with something in particular or if she can nail it right away. It is a more personalised class.   The good thing about it is that I learn a lot from the other girls and teach a lot to the other girls...."
poledancing,343ctj,Smileyface3000,3,Tue Apr 28 11:44:26 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a reasonable amount of stuff for a beginners' class.  One thing to keep in mind is that some of the items may have been directed at people who had already taken a couple beginner classes and are getting ready to move up to the next level (i.e. the ""flying showgirl"", and maybe rolling onto your knees).  Here is what we did in the 60 minute beginners classes I went to (note: all moves were done on the left AND right sides):   Warm up and stretching Walk around the pole Walk around the pole and switching directions Transitions (thread the needle) A dip (your ""gripping the pole and spinning with one foot on the floor"") A lifted dip (doing the same thing as the dip, but trying to take both your feet off the floor) The fireman spin (your spin with your knees bent) How to get up in a pretty way after landing from a spin Basic booty shaking tutorial Body waves Possibly a herkey spin (also called sundial or stag spin) or a chair spin if there were enough people in the class who had been to a couple beginners classes. Floor work (including ""flirts"", ""Hello boys"", and sexy bicycles) Build these moves into a 3-4 minute routine to a song and practice the routine several times Cool down"
poledancing,343ctj,Smileyface3000,2,Tue Apr 28 23:18:38 2015 UTC,Thank you for giving me the proper names of the moves! None were mentioned in the class I went to.
poledancing,343ctj,angelagabbie,2,Tue Apr 28 23:45:10 2015 UTC,"Aww, you're welcome!  I know the first few classes are rough, but if you are really interested, stick with it because eventually it will get easier and you will get much, much better!  Alternately, if you really don't like the way that studio ran their class, you could try another studio in your area.  Just PLEASE don't go to one where they say you can invert in your first class, that's not safe for 98% of pole newbies, not unless you have a serious athletic background."
poledancing,343ctj,angelagabbie,2,Wed Apr 29 02:00:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was REALLY shocked to see the studio advertising classes with inverts on the first day, considering how many post I've seen here where people are well into learning and struggling with inverts.   Thanks for the support. I'm definitely going to try again at a (hopefully) friendlier studio."
poledancing,343ctj,its_always_teatime,2,Wed Apr 29 02:05:49 2015 UTC,"The class you took sounds like it gave a good run-down of all the basics. My very first pole class was similar to yours: sexy basic moves and a couple spins. Some other beginner classes I've been to at other places teach you a full routine! It's do-able but a lot of the non-dancers and total newbies I see in class quickly get lost and confused.  As for the routine aspect of your class, my first class did the same, but it was more of a free dance. The instructor turned down the lights, put on a song, and let us dance it out and incorporate what we learned into our dancing.  I am one of those people that don't think inversions should be taught to beginners. Kicking into inverts can strain and hurt your back!"
poledancing,343ctj,dogoargentino,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:09:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I fell into the total newbie category which, when combined with the overall poor atmosphere of the whole studio, made the whole thing reeeeeally not fun. We got three chances to practice each spin and if we didn't get it, too bad, moving on. There was no time to get individual help.  How much time did you spend in classes versus practicing on a pole alone? The studios here try to sell it as needing to come to classes at least once a week, and in each class you learn totally different moves. After that class I feel like maybe I need to do one class and then spend the rest of the month practicing alone to try to process what I learned."
poledancing,343ctj,tahlialouise,2,Tue Apr 28 00:24:28 2015 UTC,"Time on the pole really depends on the studio. The first studio I went to had 10 poles so rarely did students ever have to share a pole, thus we got a lot of time to play around and practice during class.  On the other hand, one of the studios I go to has large class sizes so it always ends up 2-3 on a pole. Sometimes I prefer this as you have fellow classmates to help you out and point out issues in your form, but this is typically for intermediate classes that are more trick-oriented or cardio-heavy routines so you get breaks when you trade off poles.  If you have trouble remembering moves, ask the instructor what the name of it is, keep a pole notebook, write it down, and look it up (Pole Dancing Dictionary and Pole Dance Syllabus are great resources!) Buy your own pole so you can practice at home. If buying a pole is out of the question, see if you can attend open pole at your studio.  It also sounds like you might not enjoy the studios itself, not just the classes. Try out some other studios if you have options around you - I'm lucky enough to live in a 10-mile radius of 4-5 studios. Studios have different cultures - one may be clique-y, one may be super welcoming and supportive, some love sexy routines and all the students wear heels, another one might be more sporty/athletic and all about the tricks, or another is about incorporating dance and finding your own style of movement. Instructors will always vary too! Find one that you're comfortable with - I find that once I find a teacher with a style/curriculum that I like, going to their class becomes a regular thing and inevitably, you build a rapport with them."
poledancing,343ctj,takhana,2,Tue Apr 28 15:26:11 2015 UTC,"All of the pole classes at the studio I frequent are an hour long. The beginner's class is very basic, and focuses on gaining pole strength for the inversions class that comes after. That and spins.  Usually goes like this:   Warm up/stretching ~10 mins. Conditioning exercises ~10 mins Learning to climb ~10 mins. Fun stuff, e.g. dips, martini, fireman, reverse/forward sundial, reverse/forward chair, reverse/forward showgirl, mermaid, etc. ~15 mins. Stretching ~5 mins.   And with each instructor that schedule can vary depending on their mood or class size or whatever. It's not a strict method, but a general kind of beginner's pole curriculum that's up for optional modification.  I actually really, really like this method of teaching. It's very accessible to beginners, but is also setup in a way that you can challenge yourself and get a good workout if you've been doing this for a while. Class sizes are capped up to 14 students, so it never becomes too overwhelming for the instructor."

Most actually embrace it!  ... its usually the n00bs and the Midwest soccer moms who come in on Groupons who need to be reassured that it's okay to pole dance. One thing I didn't like about working as an instructor at a pole fitness studio was the emphasis on turning it into an aerobic drill style workout program, instead of a dance/artform.  It just makes me want to be like, ""dude, look at your pole dance pedigree. Look at your  instructors, and who taught your instructors. Chances are you'll run into WAY more strippers than Indian mallakhamb dudes and Chinese pole artists!"" Funny thing, actually... in India, females aren't allowed to do pole mallakhamb (they do rope mallakhamb) because the pole is supposed to be symbolic of Hanuman's phallus and it's considered way inappropriate :P"
poledancing,33vxc7,larafrompinkpony,2,Sun Apr 26 14:37:04 2015 UTC,"The thing about Indian pole /rope is super interesting!   I hate how people tend to distance pole from its stripper heritage with such disdain. I have to tell everyone I'm not a stripper, simply because I'm not. I'm not like ""Ewwww! No! I'd never do that!""  I saw a big ranty tumblr postabout that & how if you separate the 2, you're declaring yourself to be ""better than"" strippers.

poledancing,33vxc7,palimpsestnine,9,Sun Apr 26 16:53:10 2015 UTC,"It might be because I'm European, but I've never heard anyone deny that pole dance originated in strip clubs, or say that strippers are somehow worse than pole dancers.   While the article makes some good points, the author seems to gloss over the bit where pole dancing is not actually stripping.    But apparently, keeping their tops is really a substantive enough difference    Uh, yes, yes it is - it can hardly be stripping if your clothes stay on.  Sadly, stripping is still seen as something very negative and shameful by the general public, and I see no problem with saying 'no, I'm not a stripper' when you actually aren't.  Pole dancers want to distance themselves from the label of strippers because they're not actually strippers, and because by saying 'oh, you're a stripper', one completely invalidates everything the person is doing (even if they ARE a stripper - it's not like it's an easy job) and, at the same time, insinuates that the dancer is somehow a lesser person.   Does that suck? Absolutely. Should sex workers be respected more? Definitely. But I don't think berating pole dancers for not wanting people to think they're strippers is the way to solve this - it's a much much wider problem.   Tldr: society sucks"

Aren't strippers also sisters, activists, and friends?  (Unless, of course, I'm missing something, and all the women in that video made it a point to emphasize that they'd never been connected to stripping.) I also think that being associated with something considered erotic absolutely does hurt a woman's chance to make it in a different field, whether she's a pole fitness enthusiast or a stripper.

poledancing,33c61l,angelagabbie,5,Tue Apr 21 19:10:17 2015 UTC,"I haven't been very disciplined with my stretching. Most of my stretching is done in the warm-ups of my pole/aerial classes so maybe 2-3 hours a week? I also go to yoga or the occasional stretch class and over the course of a year of pole/aerial, my split is more than half way to the floor from where I started (I legitimately was maybe a foot of the ground when I started lol).  My favorite stretch to do quickly if I'm warm is this wall stretch for middle splits. Do not be fooled, this hurts a lot, but is easy to get into. I like to listen to a song and maybe two or three times during that song, try to push my legs a little lower. If you have heels, they make for some super cute ankle weights in this stretch too ;)"
poledancing,33c61l,PhotonInABox,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:25:45 2015 UTC,I read some people claimed they could do a split in about 6 weeks. I suppose that's not right then haha
poledancing,33c61l,larafrompinkpony,3,Tue Apr 21 19:10:06 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the person and how consistent they are with their stretching. Some girls I know are naturally more bendy and if they work hard, can get their splits in no time. There was a point where I always spent 30 minutes/day for a month on splits stretching and I noticed significant progress. But now that I have a real day job, it's so hard to do :("
poledancing,33c61l,girl-replica,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:26:46 2015 UTC,Same goes here - it's really not easy to stay with something like that when there's still work life :(
poledancing,33c61l,XemiTalks,3,Wed Apr 22 09:44:38 2015 UTC,"It's different for everyone but 2hrs/day seems a lot.  Every second day is reasonable and even then you can do different parts of the body.  The thing that takes the time is warming up before a stretch session in order to get the most out of it.  Before your muscles cool after pole class you can stretch, if you go for a run then stretch after.  This will save time.  Remember that flexibility takes a long time to improve so don't be disheartened if you can't do the splits within a year - this is normal.  My personal experience is not so typical because I've done gymnastics since I was 5.  BUT some girls in my pole class attend a stretching class (for 1 hr) once a week and they are making slow but steady improvement, particularly in splits.  The only other stretching they do is during pole so in total this is maybe 3-4 hours a week.  Finally, always stretch the upper back before the lower back, splits starts with the hips, hold each stretch for at least 30s and don't forget the shoulders!!  EDIT: and good luck!  If you continue pole then flexibility will serve you well in the future!"
poledancing,33c61l,DorienGrais,3,Tue Apr 21 13:07:16 2015 UTC,"It honestly really depends on your personal goals. Some people just aren't really flexy and they have to work a lot harder to get to the same level of flexibility that comes naturally to others. That doesn't make them worse pole dancers - there are still tons of impressive strength moves that don't require flexibility. I personally don't think 2 hours a day is really reasonable or doable unless you're training to be like... a contortionist. At least in my experience, I've seen people take flexibility classes for like an hour a week, and while they do make some progress, they don't maintain their gains after the classes stop.  This is just my personal experience - for me, I don't make much progress if I try to do the  ""stretch for long periods every day"" program, because ain't nobody got time for that. It's not a schedule that's maintainable for me, realistically. Pole is my hobby, not my job, and I pretty much won't do it if I'm not having fun and start thinking of it as a chore. But as long as I do it consistently - just making sure I pop into a split or a pancake or whatever I'm working on real quick for maybe 5-10 minutes every day or every other day, I make pretty noticeable progress and more importantly, maintain that progress."
poledancing,33c61l,DorienGrais,2,Tue Apr 21 14:57:28 2015 UTC,"It depends on your goals and your body.  Stretching more frequently and consistently will lead to faster progress, but stretching a couple of times a week is still better than nothing.  2 hours isn't necessary to see results, but it'll do more for you than 15 minutes.  Even so, you'll probably do better off overall with a routine you can stick to every day or most days than with a crazy intense and long routine you only manage once a week."

poledancing,32xyyt,angelagabbie,5,Fri Apr 17 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"Also as for core strength, I think leg lifts are super helpful and easy to do without a pole esp if you have a super stable thing to hold onto close to the ground (like the bottom of a couch or a standing friend's ankles!). Eventually you can move beyond that: when you have your legs stacked above your hips, keep lifting so that you end up on your shoulders.   This video shows the conditioning exercise I was trying to explain. All of the exercises are pole-assisted, but for many of them, if you can just find something sturdy to hold onto, you can adapt them. :)  I hope this helps!"

What I did was show them my all-time favorite performances to show how athletic and artistic pole is: this one by Bendy Kate and this doubles routine by Mina & Nadia. I feel like these videos are particularly effective since the style of movement is not at all sexy/strippery.  After watching those videos, it's hard to keep the opinion of pole dancing as only for ""sluts"" and ""strippers.""  Explain the health benefits! My mom noticed that I had lost some weight and I told her it was all because of pole, which was enough to convince her that it's a good hobby for me, esp since my mom is one of those moms that has no issue with telling you that you've gotten bigger, need to lose weight, etc. Also, I'm in the best shape of my life because of pole - if that's the case for you, tell them!

I was pretty surprised at the reactions. My mom, who is an immigrant from Hong Kong and usually pretty judgmental, just commented on what a great workout it is and that she's happy that I'm exercising. My dad, who is Canadian born and very liberal, wasn't as accepting. He understands that it's just a workout but I think it's mostly because of the stigma that exists and he doesn't want his little girl associated with it. He just doesn't talk about it at all.   I was expecting a freak out and my argument was going to be ""Mom does Zumba and she's not a salsa dancer!"" but it never got to that point, haha. Too bad!  I think maybe you should kind of...test the waters before you tell them. Maybe mention that you read an article about pole fitness or your friend started taking a class and you're interested. See how they react and tailor your ""coming out"" to them around that. Good luck!!"

I've been doing pole fitness for almost a year, but only my closest friends know about it. I like the idea of testing the waters first, so I'll probably try that.

Not because they thought I was joking or anything, but just because their ideas of pole dancers was so not me. I'm a tomboy and a slob, pole dancers are girly and pretty! My brother-in-law said the same thing: ""Well, I know some people who are pole dancers... and they are NOT like you!""  And on the one hand, that's cool, because I'm breaking their stereotypes. But on the other, what, you don't think I'm pretty enough to be a pole dancer?!  But I'll happily tell anyone in my family, even the conservative ones if it comes up. At the last get-together my mum handed around a video of me! She knows I care about the athleticism and I think she's pretty proud."

I explained that it was more similar to gymnastics than stripping and showing her some of youtube videos, but sadly my mom's reaction was still not very positive.  She went as far to tell me that I could be attacked by my neighbors for having a pole in my house because they would assume that I was 'open for business.'   However, at the end of the day, I pole-dance for myself and while it sucks that I can't share my progress and excitement, I have other friends who are supportive.  I would tell them, because it isn't something you need to hide, but be just prepared if they just don't get it.  Like any other relationship, you won't see eye-to-eye on every issue and I wish my mom did get it, but it hasn't destroyed our relationship."

For a while, they thought it was a silly hobby and didn't have much of a problem with it, but once I started getting noticeably stronger and more toned, they took it seriously. They even ask me to send videos!  Like angelagabbie suggested, show them videos of pole dancers you admire. This might help break it down for them.

I do have to admit that she's cooler than most. :D  On the whole, the response has been positive save for a few sheltered individuals. You just have to read your audience.

poledancing,32moop,stelur,2,Wed Apr 15 02:19:42 2015 UTC,"Like minminkitten said, your pole might be too cold, so you may need to warm it up first. Another issue is that your skin could be too dry. Much as it is frowned upon, I sometimes have to lotion up my legs before pole (or at least on my off days) or they will slide all over the place. The moisture in your skin allows for some ""stick""."

I can't stick to mine if it's chilly and I haven't warmed it up either.  The first thing I do after warming up every session is a couple reptitions of: hold an inverted crucifix for a while with my skin against the metal, then hold a handstand for a bit, on and off leaning against the pole.  Giving it some body heat helps immensely."

Also, when we got into this, she let go of the pole first to transfer her grip to my legs, and I let go second to lay back grab her legs--being the second person to let go makes me feel much more secure. But I think a lot of it is personal preference--some people might not want extra weight on them when they have to let go and so would prefer to let go first, or some people might get into it in a different order altogether, be more confident in one move than the other, etc!"

poledancing,32h6zj,dancingmanatee,3,Mon Apr 13 19:46:14 2015 UTC,"Stainless steel is by far the worst grip wise. You might find that even chrome is sufficient but usually people do find it slippery without grip aids. When it was warm and humid in the right amount it was gripping my skin nicely.   I had both TG and Brass. Brass is really grippy, much more than I would like. It was almost painful to grip on it, and sliding thighs or tummy down was kind of hard. I have read that brass deals with sweat better than any other finish. I have hyperhidrosis so it didn't help me much. Another thing to consider is that it oxidizes and turn darker unevenly. I thought it looked kind of rustic and cool, but I assume it could bug some people. You can clean it though.  TG is slippier than brass but on my skin feels much nicer. I can slide, but I grip well at the same time. The gold finish rubs off over (a very long) period of time but the grip remains. I had it for a month or so but I really like it so far for my skin. In the studio I always try to take on of the TG poles haha.  It's very individual but I wouldn't jump right onto the grippiest finish based on you experience with the Stainless Steel. It is awfully slippery pole, and if you manage to do anything on it, it could indicate you don't need that much more grip."

That is, under the titanium finish is stainless steel and the finish will wear off on high use areas of the pole.

Also, spend PLENTY of time in advance of opening on advertising and promoting. If I show up somewhere that I don't know for the first time and I'm the only one there, I probably won't come back.  You will want somewhere with high ceilings, minimum of 14ft if you want to have a competition team ever. Also you can't do too many drops in a shorter space.   I love the idea of two spaces, one for class and a smaller one. Have at least two poles in the smaller space, and allow open pole practice whenever the studio is open.

It sucks when an instructor just gives you a couple basic spins then devotes the rest of their attention to teaching ""cooler"" things to their other students.

When I choreograph I find I'll listen for a part of the song I want to emphasize, a great beat drop for drama, a sustained note for a graceful move I can hold (or milk for time!). See if there's a part of any of these that you can ""see"" a move or series of moves to and then build out from there [how will you get into or out of it? what comes next?]"
poledancing,3263uo,FancyPhilanges,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:43:14 2015 UTC,"Create a character and a storyline for that character. Do you want to be sexy, sad, happy, in love, angry, aggressive, etc. and build your movements/mood around that character.  Another tip is to create a list of moves/spins you have confidently and from that list, start thinking of transitions between those moves. And make sure to distribute your tricks so that you don't get tired.  Also, Jennifer Kim has a great routine to the song Blue Jeans. It's an advanced routine, but you can see the musical cues where she times her moves to create drama and ""oomph"" to her routine. :)"
poledancing,32014o,girl-replica,2,Thu Apr 9 14:20:26 2015 UTC,"There's really no way to totally avoid it, at least that I've found. I did notice that ankle boots/tall boots in general are the worst offenders, though. But I squeak/grunt/curse plenty even with no shoes on, so...  I'm sure it depends a lot on your points of contact and where you use the most pressure - some people climb with a flexed foot and use the top of their foot as a point of contact, but I think you can minimize the squeaking from that by focusing on keeping both feet pointed and focusing on your other points of contact."
poledancing,32014o,larafrompinkpony,2,Thu Apr 9 14:35:51 2015 UTC,That makes sense.  I'll try working around it and see how much I can improve things.  My main problems arise in inside leg hangs (I keep a pretty straight inside leg) and going into butterflies/ayeshas from a caterpillar.  I really like to slide my feet off the pole there.  Might be time to change some habits.  Thanks!

poledancing,31vucd,PoleZadeh,2,Wed Apr 8 19:08:13 2015 UTC,"I had this issue too. The best thing to work on is your hip and hamstring STRENGTH alongside your flexibility work. For example, if you can do the splits on the floor, but cant get your Jade split as flat as your floor split, chances are your hips and hammies aren't as strong yet and you're relying on gravity to do the work for you! (I mean, you're relying on gravity when you're sitting on the floor in splits position to push you down!). There are lots of DVDs and programs out there to help you work on being able to LIFT into your split instead of SINK into it :) my two favorite instructional DVDs are Cleo's Rockin Legs n Abs and Alethea Austin's Pure Splits. Wishing you the best of luck!"
poledancing,31vucd,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:05:12 2015 UTC,"In order to get an aerial split you need to strengthen your muscles to be able to pull your legs up there. So static vs spinning pole has very little to do with your active flexibility, or your flexibility in general. Pole requires splits in some moves, but the training itself doesn't really improve it much.  I can recommend you Fit&Bendy Bendy Body DVD, it focuses on active flexibility and making your splits usable off the ground. In the meantime, here's a thread at /r/flexibility right now that you might find helpful for your back leg."

poledancing,31texp,ssombraa,2,Wed Apr 8 00:43:26 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  If you're doing the Cross Ankle Release (as far as I could tell?), try to keep the bottom leg straight. It secures your grip on the pole by locking in the bent leg.   Also, at first try it hands free. The hands overhead grip it a little more advanced. When you push your torso with the arm your hip go out of the tilt that makes them secure and comfy, so it feels more dodgy than just hanging in there hands free."
poledancing,31texp,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:17:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! This one was (supposed to be) more like this example. I noticed that when getting into position to actually let go and lay back, I slide down a few inches (probably partially due to the the discomfort of the inner thigh skin holding) but I think keeping that leg straight will help keep me situated from the get-go.  Any tips for the (edit: Straight-Legged) Cross Ankle Release? Like this one. (Aside from keeping that other leg straight.) I have a lot of trouble figuring out where to actually grip with that one on my studio's 40mm poles--haven't tried on my 45mm at home yet."
poledancing,31texp,ClockworkMagpie,2,Thu Apr 9 10:41:19 2015 UTC,"Yes PDD have weird names sometimes, this is the Cross Knee Release in the rest of the world.  Another thing that will help you with the grip is holding onto the foot of the bent leg as you go down, it secures the grip of the knee and mostly makes you feel safer.  With Cross Ankle Release, the grip is not what it seems. You'd think your thighs are supposed to hold you in place, when in fact they don't play a major role here. You have to cross your legs super hard so that the pole won't be able to touch the insides of your knees. It created this stopping point just above the knees which is similar to a bent knee grip, only made of two legs (hope that makes sense huh).   When you lower yourself, before you lower the torso you bring the legs up, make sure the pole is pushing right against that leg crossing point above the knees, then you let your tailbone rest on the pole. The pole is now pushing against these two points and you can cautiously lower your upper body. No thigh grip as such.  Hope that helps!"

poledancing,31ryeu,larafrompinkpony,2,Tue Apr 7 19:06:39 2015 UTC,"Haven't noticed that effect on me :P But everyone is different. I definitely put on some muscle on my back and shoulders, but no effect on my waist.   My butt did get smaller/trimmer though... but I think that was part of general toning up/losing weight. My butt has returned to its former, er, juicy glory these past few months that I've been pregnant and off the pole."
poledancing,31ryeu,girl-replica,2,Tue Apr 7 19:09:41 2015 UTC,"It depends on where you're starting from and how your body composes itself.  If you've got extra bodyfat and use pole dance to burn more calories than you eat, your waist is probably going to get smaller.  If you do not have excess bodyfat and only put on muscle, your waist might take on a less curvy shape depending on your body type.  My waist has gotten slightly less curvaceous since I've been poling.  I began at a normal weight with almost nothing by way of muscles.  I've lost a little bit of body fat, but gained a lot of core and upper body strength.  That core strength is now visible on my stomach.  I have a high-sitting pelvis naturally, so there's not a ton of room between the top of my pelvis and the bottom of my ribcage.  I've added visible muscle mass to the top of my pelvis, which has shrunk that gap even further.  My arms are much bulkier now, and my shoulders a bit wider (and much more well-defined), but I'm bottom-heavy so I feel like it's balanced me out a bit better.  This has been over a period of almost a year now, with a pole in my home, working on it most days.  Your results may not be the same as mine.  I've got a short waist zone and a tendency to add muscular bulk more easily than most women.  What changes you'll see depend on your body, what condition you're in when you start, and what sort of things you do with it.  If you stick to beginner-intermediate pole with a focus on dancing, you're not going to tax your upper body or core nearly as hard as someone who is training advanced strength moves, and consequently you're unlikely to build as much muscle.  As for why pros tend towards a petite, top-heavy body type, it's a bit of a chicken-and-egg question.  That body type is the easiest to achieve super advanced tricks with, and poling works the muscles that push a body more in that direction (except the petite part).  All that aside, pole dancing is a blast.  There's so much more value in it than what it does to your body.  You definitely won't get a straight waist overnight (if your body is set up to get one at all), so give it a go and enjoy :)"
poledancing,31ryeu,DorienGrais,2,Tue Apr 7 19:37:57 2015 UTC,"I've been in classes pretty consistently since 2010.  I'm short and was about 113 when I started.  When I started performing in my first group recital I think nerves, over training and learning some tricks that were intimidating to me, dropped me down to 97 lbs.  And I was eating! I have a long torso for my short height, so my waist did lose about 2 ins and my ab def was really strong.  Around 2012, I started performing a lot more.  Before this, I was religious about using weights.  I stopped going to the gym so much.  Because of this, my once short muscular legs, with defined calves and a small but cute booty, got skinny.  I also had some problems with my knees from muscle imbalance and weakness.  Fast forward to now: I'm a much healthier 105, have nice muscular arms, my legs are looking better.  As for my waist; I may have added almost an inch.  That doesn't bother me.  I'm stronger, flexier and feel much better.  (Sorry so long)."
poledancing,31ryeu,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:58:59 2015 UTC,"I think it depends mostly on body shape. There are tricks that reply heavily on the obliques, which might take away from the waistline. I had almost no signs of hourglass-ness, and the new found obliques actually added a little bit of curve.   It IS an upper body workout, so most pole dancer out there get that triangle look from big shoulder and lats, and some do get more protruding abs, but you need to be very far out in your training, avoid stretching out your muscles, have an unfavoring physique and possibly actively do body building to look very manly. Most of the (fairly advanced) girls in my studio still look very soft and feminine.    Also, if you supplement it with lower body workout, you'll be able to get more proportional figure and a bigger booty. It will definitely take away that bulky triangle look and accentuate the waist. So there are ways, and it will take a while until it will start transforming your body."
poledancing,31ryeu,Polerina_,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:26:51 2015 UTC,"It depends a lot on your body type.

I'm not a very curvy person, so I haven't noticed any change in my waist but my shoulders have gained a little bit of mass.

poledancing,31ryeu,Wildernessinabox,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:31:53 2015 UTC,I'd think a lower body workout with plenty of squats about 2-3 times a week would round out anything and contribute really well.

In fact many in my studio are quite thin and the most buff girl we've ever had had a very slender waist. But yes, your shoulders and your back are bound to get big. That's simply the truth - and it's awesome. Look forward to that moment when you try to do a push up and you realize it's not hard anymore and you do eleven and think you could do like ten more, although in the past ten was a severe stretch for you."
poledancing,31ryeu,miz_fahrenheit,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:16:17 2015 UTC,"It depends on the type of workout you're doing to complement your workout. Pole work can develop a toned, feminine physique, but you have to be willing to spend a lot of time (I'd say 40% of your warm-up and 90% of your cool down working on your flexibility) If you do this, your core will shrink!  What will help you create a very strong core is taking every pole, wall, and floor movement suuuuuuper slow. Turn your focus inwards and focus on the heat your body is creating and the sensuality of that burn. The result is two fold - you get stronger quicker, and you look really freaking sexy when you move!!  Good luck, love!"

Also, don't take advanced classes unless you're there, otherwise you may not gain as much from it - and it would also hold the rest of the class back.

Here's an alternative escape route that's less exhausting. Having those options ready really helped me feel more in-control.

poledancing,31p4s6,eclaire_chappy,3,Wed Apr 8 00:14:38 2015 UTC,"When I first started pole, my dream move was a reverse grab (or flying body spiral to some) but the idea of throwing my body around the pole with only one hand terrified me. Skip to a year later and I can do it almost anytime (even without dry hands!) - it was really just a matter of building up strength and grip. Ask your instructors to give you variations of what's being taught or conditioning moves. (For example, to build up strength for a reverse grab, a great (and fun) conditioning exercise is doing slow and controlled one-handed spins on spinny pole. Engage your shoulder and hold on for as long as you can, even if it's just a step around the pole :)  If something is truly terrifying to you, build up your strength so you're confident entering it. Don't be nervous to ask your instructors to spot you and when they do spot you, trust that they'll keep you from injuring yourself! That's what they're there for. Also, if your studio has crash mats, don't be embarrassed to use them!! You should never be embarrassed for taking safety precautions.  And if your instructors are really just walking away and moving on to ""better"" students, that's pretty disappointing. If that's really the case, try out some classes at different studios. I've been in that position where instructors prioritize more advanced studios and let their beginner/intermediate students plateau in progress.

I actually own specialized elastic ribbons just for tying shoes to my feet. (It's cute, because I can match them to my outfits!)

I stretched for 15-20 minutes every morning and night, and got to the point where I can sit on the floor with my butt with only a few cms to the floor within two weeks.  I followed this guide about getting the splits in six weeks, only I did a frog stretch instead of the karate stance as I kept slipping doing that."

poledancing,310u2m,Idonthaveapoint,2,Wed Apr 1 09:41:46 2015 UTC,"First we have to define ""push past the pain"". I believe they're saying don't deepen a stretch if it already hurts. It's okay to sit in a stretch that hurts a little, but if you deepen it at that point you run the risk of pulling a tendon or otherwise hurting yourself. Things like hamstrings can take forever to heal."

More of a cross-training thing, but anti-gravity yoga (on silk hammocks) I think has improved my flexibility. The silks gently assist you into different positions (including splits) and when you invert, you can use gravity to get more out of your split (inverting in anti-gravity isn't like in pole. Most people are able to do it in the first 10 minutes of class). If you're looking for a fun way to increase flexibility, I'd recommend it!"

I injured my hip in December and I'm still doing physical therapy for it, so instead of stretching hardcore a few times a week, I stretch gently every night, and a little more intensely right after pole classes when I'm super warm. For me, consistency is key. Stretching every night made such a huge difference!"
poledancing,310u2m,AskSkeeves,2,Wed Apr 1 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"It just takes a lot of consistent effort.  My routine has changed over time, but right now I do 30 minutes of hamstring and front splits every other day and 30 minutes of middle splits and back the other days.  I'm not perfect, but I've gotten up to at least 5-6 days a week.  I've been at it for 6 or 7 months (I can't quite remember) and while I've improved a lot, I don't have any splits yet.  My front split is pretty close on my better side (no hands, front calf is solidly down on the floor), but the rest are still not that close.  No magic, just gotta do it.  The more frequent and consistent you are, the faster they'll come.  There area lot of resources out there, I recommend trying lots of different stretches and finding the ones that work best for you.  Good luck!"
poledancing,310u2m,girl-replica,2,Wed Apr 1 14:20:39 2015 UTC,"It's a little different for me because I've been a competitive dancer my whole life so my teachers kinda pushed my splits out of me (they would press on my shoulders to get lower to the ground)- I don't suggest doing this. Make sure your body is warm. Being warm will make your muscles for elastic and help prevent injury. I would do a full stretch before going into your splits: touch your toes with your feet together and then apart, lunges, butter fly, sitting in your center splits and reaching over to the side. Once your body feels more stretched out then I would ease into your split. Keep your hips square to the front and your body up straight. With each exhale sink a little lower to the ground. When it starts to get uncomfortable (not unbearable) hold that position for a good 30 seconds at least. Practice your stretching regularly and then before you know it you might even have an over-split!"

I've used blocks for over splitting off and on for over a year.  But the other night, right after a yoga class, I ran into a very flexy women who I had met once before.  She said that stretching your legs (to your head or over) in a supine position really helped her. I tried that with her helping me...and it worked. I was a couple of centimeters closer!  I was also super warm from yoga.  Much better than my blocks.  (A pro ballet friend got me started with blocks, but she uses like 3 blocks!)  The blocks def helped me w/ my right side, but I think my new flexy friend''s way of doing it may work better with me.

poledancing,3112m9,PoleL0ver,3,Wed Apr 1 07:10:38 2015 UTC,"I had a similar thing/have a similar thing happen to me with moves occasionally, what I think is happening is: you are getting 'good' at inverting, by that I mean your body is used to it, your muscles know whats up and maybe you are even starting to use different muscle groups to invert as they get stronger (eg using your core more as opposed to kicking up). That means it looks 'sloppy' but really you are just training to be better at it. So don't lose hope, keep pushing and really concentrate on how your body is moving and what muscles are engaged.   In terms of invert tips, remember to look over your shoulder towards the pole and mentally prepare to get your hips over your shoulders - if you do that, you find that you 'pop' up much easier :)"

poledancing,3112m9,harerituals,3,Wed Apr 1 11:57:16 2015 UTC,"There's a chance you could be over-training. If you don't give your muscles at least 24 but preferably 48 hours between training sometimes the muscles you've been working will just strait crap out on you.   At my studio no one is allowed to invert until they can do 5 pole crunches and hold a chopper. this insures that you are strong enough to do an invert and won't need to jump into an invert and therefore it won't make a difference whether you invert from the ground of aerially.   There have been times for me too when I know I have my invert but I just can't seem to get my bunz over my head and it's sooo frustrating. I recommend taking a break for a few days, then also do some conditioning with pole crunches.   Also sometimes what I do that helps me is instead of going straight into a chopper I do a ""tuck and bloom"". Without jumping I tuck my legs up to my chest while griping the pole, tip myself backwards while my knees are still at my chest and then once I'm up I extend my legs into a full chopper"
poledancing,3112m9,mai_z,2,Wed Apr 1 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be overtraining, I generally only do about an hour of training 2 or 3 times a week but I have been pushing it a bit more so maybe it could be.

poledancing,30vo8k,thebearded-one,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:01:08 2015 UTC,"It's not a comfortable move, for sure. I don't recall if it was that uncomfortable for me when I first learned the move, but it's not ""pop into a million pieces""-level bad, but I have a fairly twisty back. The main tip I have for the Janeiro is to LEAN BACK towards the pole as much as possible - its a pretty precarious balancing move. Leaning forward = fall on yo' face.   What's your entrance into it? I find it easier to get into from a brass monkey than from a layback/cross knee release."
poledancing,30vo8k,larafrompinkpony,2,Tue Mar 31 02:18:41 2015 UTC,"I definitely hear you on the lean back part! I'm getting into it from a brass monkey as well. I'm not a bendy person with my back, so that may be something I need to work on. I went to the drawing board and searched for pictures/videos of successful Janeiros. I've been settling the cushion-y part of my side onto my arm but it looks like most people have their hips resting on their arm instead. I may need to adjust that slightly."
poledancing,30vo8k,larafrompinkpony,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:28:13 2015 UTC,"I double checked a picture of me doing a Janiero, and it's definitely resting on my hip, and not my side. I creeped your post history, and since you're a dude, you might be able to get away with putting in your side... but it's definitely easier for me to rest my hip on my ""arm shelf"".   Oh! Other main tip I have for the Janeiro: your arm shelf should really be 90 degrees. A lot of people bend the elbow more, which gives you less effective ""elbow-shelf"" space, making it easier to slip off. A fail video of one of my first attempts at a Janeiro - notice at 0:14 that that my elbow is bent (relative to my body) at a very acute angle? My initial set up coming around the pole from the layback was not optimal. Either the hand should be a little lower, or I should not have let my body drop as much."
poledancing,30vo8k,iheartlungs,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:43:50 2015 UTC,I will definitely put this info to good use this week :) Thank you!
poledancing,30vo8k,iheartlungs,1 point,Tue Mar 31 06:00:53 2015 UTC,"Look you aren't going to feel GOOD in a janeiro, its kinda crushing your kidneys and lungs and back a little so at first its very uncomfortable but you certainly shouldn't feel 'popping' in your back. Discomfort is a good way of describing it, but it shouldn't feel BAD. Make sure you warm up your lower back super super well first, maybe do a few bridges and then counter stretch well too. What I found really helped me was using grip aid on my hand that's on the pole, and keeping that elbow at 90 degrees like a shelf, and also when you come down onto the arm try imagining that you are rolling down off the pole rather than lifting and moving your legs around."

poledancing,30u071,freemerged,6,Mon Mar 30 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"First class.. Expect to be frazzled and confused and, if you started uncoordinated and with the daily activity level of a rock (like me), expect to be out of breath and unable to keep up.  Also expect it to be a lot of fun, expect to be hooked, and expect not to be able to lift your arms for a few days after :)   Flexibility and strength is something you build up, and definitely not expected of you in a beginners class. You'll probably do a lot of floor work, walking around the pole, maybe some basic spins, but nothing that particularly demands flexibility.   Remember, some people in your class are (or have been) in the same boat as you, coming in from their corporate jobs to try this for the first time. Nobody's there to judge, so relax, have fun and get hooked!"
poledancing,30u071,Gemmacupcake,2,Mon Mar 30 20:44:48 2015 UTC,Thank you! You made it sound a lot less frightening. I'm excited to start now :) I signed up for a intro class so I'm ready to take this on! I've always been afraid of learning new things because of harsh critique but I will keep an open mind.
poledancing,30u071,mai_z,3,Tue Mar 31 13:57:38 2015 UTC,"Hello! Welcome to the pole world, I hope you're going to love it!  It's probably going to start out hard...you will hurt, and you will be pretty bad at it. But you'll also learn some fun/sexy dance moves to go along with it, and the sense of accomplishment when you nail a move you've been working on is AMAZING.   One thing to note, is that pole studios will generally fall into one of a few categories: 1) Dance-y , 2) Tricks oriented/ Gymnastics-y , or 3) Sexy . Depending on which broad category it falls in, it'll determine how much of a work out it is, and how much extra training you'll need. Flexibility isn't essential before you start, but it'll start playing into what you can do when you get more advanced.  Good luck, and have fun!"
poledancing,30u071,FoxWithNoTails,4,Mon Mar 30 21:44:47 2015 UTC,"Seconding the horse-trained core! While you might not feel super toned, I remember how much riding helped me develop my core muscles without my realising it.  My first lesson was crazy and challenging and painful and so much fun. I ached for days after, but it reminded me how accomplished I felt getting to the end of the class.  Even a little background in jazz is going to help your brain with coordination and foot placement and the like, which will leave most of it free to handle the new stuff. Strength and toning will definitely come, though muscle building (as far as bulking up) I've noticed tends to vary from person to person. I wouldn't say that flexibility is essential to start, and you'll build up to it. As with any sport/training, don't push your body too hard, too fast. Expect to fail, then do it again. At least once a class I end up on my butt in a terribly unsexy pile. I laugh, get up, start over. Because we do it for fun!  Best of luck and enjoy!"

poledancing,30u071,angelagabbie,3,Thu Apr 2 03:15:38 2015 UTC,"I used to ride too :) It's great for core strength so you'll probably find some of the moves a little easier than a beginner who's coming from an inactive lifestyle.   Pole is the most confusing, crazy thing I've ever tried but equally it's the most gratifying thing ever. It's very similar in my mind to riding - you know how they say that horses are great equalizers? Well, so is a pole!"

I originally learned to pole at a studio that is very plus-friendly ... my instructors were all about that ""pole meat"".   I think the main reason why you see mostly very fit/small people is that those are the people competing and winning the elite competitions. At it's core, pole is very similar to gymnastics... there's a physical advantage to being tiny. You can rotate faster during flips, have less inertia to overcome, less torque needs to be generated doing lever-type movements... The vast majority of champion pole dancers all have that gymnast/dancer build. Quite a few of them ARE former competitive gymnast/dancers.

And it's inspiring for ME to see their progress. There's a bigger girl who was taking beginner classes with me and I was jumping up and down for her when she climbed up the pole for the first time!"
poledancing,30fdrn,meowjanjan,2,Thu Mar 26 23:03:08 2015 UTC,"I second this, there is a lot of diversity in my studio as well when it comes to body type. I feel a lot of stuff on social media is professional/advanced pole dancers who are fit but it's probably because they work out/pole A LOT."
poledancing,30fdrn,girl-replica,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:32:32 2015 UTC,"Hadn't seen that video before, she's ace!"
poledancing,30fdrn,girl-replica,4,Thu Mar 26 23:10:12 2015 UTC,"There are definitely bigger girls out there who pole, though you're right that the ones you see around the 'net very often tend to be small and fit.  Competitive pole dancers are all going to be fit as hell regardless of size because of what they had to do to get to that level.  The more anyone poles, the more fit they're going to be regardless of size.  On top of that, as /u/larafrompinkpony pointed out, lighter-weight women are always going to have an advantage in sports where you need to fight physical forces.  That's just the mechanics of the situation, and it frustrates me to no end.  I'm sturdily-built, muscular, and unusually heavy for my size.  Every once in a while when I think about the fact that I'm always going to weigh more than most women of my size, and that it makes pole harder, I get a little mad.  Not at lighter women, just at fate.  I know how frustrating it can be to feel like you're fighting a handicap, and to see that feeling reinforced by images of successful people who almost all seem to be tiny.  It's a cruddy feeling.  I always remind myself, though, that it can all be overcome with enough practice and conditioning.  I'm heavy, I'm not going to get less heavy, so I'll just have to get stronger to overcome gravity.  Anyone can, and I keep in mind when I see bigger polers how much extra strength and work it took them to do this or that sick move.  I appreciate their achievements even more for that.  I second /u/MyMuddyEyes 's recommendation of Emy Dawn as an incredible poler with a larger build.  I also love Kristy Sellars.  She's really technically powerful and has a magnetic stage presence too, I think.  Sorry for the wall of text, you brought up a topic I think about a lot.  :)"

I was actually pretty surprised that Oona Kivela mentioned that she was 164cm in her AMA - she's the same height as me! I totally expected her to be like, 4'10 or something. Michelle Shimmy looks long and leggy in all her pictures and videos, but she's also my height. Same with Natasha Wang, Alethea Austin, and Marlo Fisken.

You're definitely on the muscle and not at all on the collarbone, yeah?  How are you working on your shoulder mount and what isn't working?  I did three things to work up to it:   Shoulder dismounts Tucking my knees as high as I could in a shoulder mount position Shoulder mounting very low on the pole.  I put my shoulder on the pole a few feet up, butt resting on the floor.  I engage my arms, lift my chest, then pull my legs up over the top, finally engaging my abs to lift my butt.

I feel like because I have a way longer upper body than I do lower body, it's just going to take me a while to nail this trick because I'm working with so much. I love these strength building exercises though! They really help out a lot!"
poledancing,30dplq,Cupcake1964,2,Fri Mar 27 22:14:38 2015 UTC,"I thought I'd never be able to do it either, but eventually it just clicked. I was hesitent to even take my feet off the ground because it felt like I would fall instantly, but once you get up there, it actually is really secure feeling. I started by walking out from the pole a bit so my body was lower, and cup gripping with one hand around head level, and the other a few inches higher. I then did tucks until I was able to comfortably lift my legs all the way up. Once you can grip the pole with the legs, going into crucifix happens pretty easily. It does kind of hurt at first, I had a big bruise after practising."
poledancing,30dplq,angelagabbie,2,Thu Mar 26 16:06:19 2015 UTC,"I don't have a shoulder mount either, but someone once told me to keep my elbows in and it helped tremendously (still don't have it, but that tip definitely improved my form). Maybe you do already do that and if so, then ignore :)"
poledancing,30dplq,MyMuddyEyes,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:34:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a tip I figured out too. If you squeeze your elbows together and keep those muscles engaged before you lift yourself up, it really does help to secure your grip and make you feel more stable."

If you're open to a brass pole, Platinum Stages' is cheaper than X-pole, too!  Lil' Mynx makes a decent pole, they're generally pretty well regarded, just not as popular as X-pole. Cheaper, too, and come in fun colors... as long as you don't mind a powder coat finish.  And there's always Amazon, particularly if you have Amazon Prime!"

It's worked perfectly for me other than having to warm it up before using it but from what I gather that is common with most poles. I'd like to have an X-pole but for the money you can't go wrong with a lil' Mynx pole.

For me once I've applied that it keeps me bone dry in that area for at least a week, so I've found that quite helpful for when I have pole lessons, hardly have to wipe down at all when I've used it the night before. I got mine on prescription but I'm fairly certain you can buy it direct from most pharmacies as well without one, usually about £7 or so. So worth it. There are also different brands of the same kind of thing, Obadan I found just as good and you can buy that online from the website."

I mean, I'm not going to be doing a fonji* with a baby strapped to me (though that mental image makes me giggle like an idiot) but Ashley isn't doing anything I wouldn't do with, say... a cat. Basically, if I can do it while holding a cat one-handed, I'm pretty comfortable with the idea of doing it with a baby strapped to me. Cats are sharper and wriggle around more anyway.   And of course, I feel like the people who are pooh-poohing it on the basis of pole dancing being dangerous and ""she might fall and hurt the baby,"" I think just don't know very much about pole. She's not inverted, and she's slow and controlled. To me, it's about as much risk of dropping the baby as, say, holding a child while you're trying to reach for something out of the kitchen cabinet, but I never hear anybody bitch about THAT.   *Completely irrelevant, but I've seen videos of Alex Magala doing one-armed fonjis, so going by my ""one arm and a cat"" rule, he could probably totally do a fonji while holding a baby."

I also plan to wear my baby, but more cautiously... like with a front carry, so I can grab with a hand if I need to, since I'm not as experienced.

To start with they were a little sore more so doing back flex stuff rather than pole contact, but now they're 6 months old, still a little sensitive with new jewellery but not really with 'tapping' the pole in moves or transitions (usually the inverted one taps due to jewellery position). Watch if it may get irritated by sweat/clothing fibres/any grip chalk product from on the pole or the pole cleaner your studio uses, for brand new piercings, but I've been ok with it and I'd say you would be fine too.  TIP: keep your original jewellery you were pierced with for practice, often a little longer (possibly thicker at some piercing venues), its great to pole with as it allows for movement in back-flex or tucks, contorted poses etc, with a little more bar to move with -may stick out a little more in some poses but gives your body and piercing enough space and helps with healing/not tearing etc. **There's a change you might get a little 'bubble/blister' near the piercing hole with pole training when its fresh or knocked around a bit more than usual, happened to me, but remember to clean twice a day, and after pole class and you should be fine, it will settle itself  :)"

If it has been bleeding you can do a sea salt soak (1/4tsp of sea salt (not table or iodised) dissolved in 250ml of hot water) and soak it in that which will help calm any irritation. If you are concerned about it you can patch it with one of those giant Band-Aid patches you get from the chemist and that will give it a little more padding against knocks. Hope this helps!

poledancing,2zit9n,angelagabbie,3,Wed Mar 18 22:45:01 2015 UTC,"My experience with workshops: you really want to make sure you're taking a workshop appropriate to your level. By that, I mean more that you're not trying to do an intermediate or advanced level workshop when you're a beginner. I've tried that once (at a Pantera workshop) and ended up crying my eyes out once I got home, because I couldn't do anything she taught, and felt like I didn't learn anything useful to add to my practice. On the other hand, I do find it useful as an advanced poler to take even beginner-level workshops, because there's always something new to learn. Not necessarily new tricks, but new ways of adding ""flair"" to your performance, or new transitions.   I do enjoy workshops for a couple of different reasons - I like branching out stylistically, and sometimes it's cool to just take a class with a ""polebrity"" and see them up close and personal. I still say I reached my peak as a poler when I went to Pole Expo last year and did a private with Natasha Wang... and she touched my butt. I swear she imparted some of her antigravity powers to me that day, because after that, I finally got my Iron X. No joke.  I personally get more out of privates rather than workshops, but small workshops are fun too, because you have other people in the class supporting you and spotting. Only thing I wasn't super keen on at my Pole Expo workshops was that there were usually 20-25 people/workshop, and I like individual attention.   I've taken workshops with Pantera (this was at my old studio in ATL), Mina Mortezaie (while terribly hungover... not a great experience, but my fault for partying too hard the night before), Carlie Hunter, and Samantha Starr. I've also taken David C. Owens' workshops on flexibility, though those were more informational than anything else, but I still find the stuff I learned useful for my flexibility training - what little of it I can do now, anyway!"
poledancing,2zit9n,larafrompinkpony,3,Thu Mar 19 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"Workshops are awesome. It's usually by world-class pole instructor and they are well thought through.   Usually when you train at one studio for long, you get stuck in the same set of moves and exercises and there's hardly anything new to learn, just practice. Workshops give you a glimpse of what's happening out there and rehydrate your training with new ideas. This once time, my instructor had a workshop with Dr. Ken, and she came back pretty stoked about it and taught us a bunch of these ninja moves he did there.   I'd go to one whenever I find a chance because it's an awesome way to shake up your routine.  I also went to a flexibility workshop once, and is was amazing. I felt empowered and motivated and enlightening by it. When I went back home after it, I was with a friend and I couldn't talk, all I could say was ""Wow""."

Create a list of spins/poses/transitions/floorwork that you can confidently execute and from that list, start connecting moves that flow together. Make sure to distribute range of difficulty throughout the song to keep yourself from getting to tired (ie. maybe after you do some super difficult aerial combo, roll around on the ground to give yourself a chance to catch your breath).

I personally just got my first pole today so I know how intimidating it can be, I had so much fun though swinging around my house blasting music after stretching."
poledancing,2zfk9n,Wildernessinabox,2,Wed Mar 18 04:23:40 2015 UTC,You're definitely right! I know it's going to take time.  I guess I'm just having difficultly looking up at this mountain I have to climb.  I know I've only taken a few steps but I just want to progress and have it come naturally (and quickly)  :p have a pole as well :)  it is fun blasting music.  Thanks for your kind words of wisdom.  I'll try to remember that when I get discouraged!  :p
poledancing,2zfk9n,Wildernessinabox,2,Wed Mar 18 05:05:59 2015 UTC,"Figure out what you need to learn first and work on one thing each week that you can string into something else.  Ex first week just swinging around on the pole, next week climbing the pole week after that pole skating and integrate each into the consecutive weeks workout. This way you have a goal in mind and you aren't getting hung up on the other stuff."

I've been doing pole for about 7 months (classes a couple times a week at best, no pole at home).  By any objective measure I am terrible at it.  I'm still in beginner classes.  I still can't invert.  Sometimes I start comparing myself to other people in class and I feel like a failure.  But you know what?  I freaking love pole.  I can climb.  I can spin.  I have more upper body strength than I have ever had in my life.  And for the first time, I love working out.  So even if I'm on the slow side, I've achieved something awesome for my life and fitness."

Pretty sure it happens to everyone! I've been staving it off by really paying attention not just to what I can do, but what I've learned. Even if I didn't get better at, say, inverting last week, I definitely learned more about them, and that's a victory too because I like knowledge and it will help me improve next week!"

I can't climb for beans, & my apprentices are iffy at best. I just don't have the strength to make them work yet. The thing that keeps me going is the spins. They're not very good at this point, but are super fun.   Each class, everything sucks a little less. Once you get into a class, if you're having trouble your instructor should be able to give you pointers to help. The other girls in my class are wicked encouraging, and I hope yours will be as well. That camaraderie helps me stick with it too. (That, and I know I need to keep at it 'cuz I wanna do flips & shit. :-P)  If your studio is worth their salt, they'll welcome the newest of newbies and help you get the skills you need.

poledancing,2zfk9n,thisisbelinda,5,Wed Mar 18 05:15:51 2015 UTC,"Seriously! I was so nervous for my first class being a complete virgin to pole, and being a male poler. I couldnt have been welcomed more warmly. I have found that this community(pole fitness in general) is so accepting and supportive. Granted there will be debby downers in every bunch but lucky for me theres only one and my pole sisters have my back like a bra strap! I have only been polling for about a month and i was so awkward at first because im tall and skinny and awkward. But now ive mastered the shoulder mount, invert crucifix, regular invert helicopter, climbing and side climbing...etc (although i do go 3x a week and do two a days) you can do this trust me!! The sport will push you to your limit, bruise you, stretch you and tire you out like no other...but it is SO worth it. You got this girl!! If anyone tells you otherwise just ignore them. I know that i get so excited to see my pole divas improve and i am honored when people newer than me ask for help on  the spins and moves i have mastered so far!

poledancing,2zfk9n,Felisitea,3,Wed Mar 18 11:55:25 2015 UTC,"After my first pole class, which was called Pole 101, I went up to my instructor and asked, ""Uh.... so, is there maybe a class that's at a more basic level than this... maybe called, 'Pole for Dummies'?""  Fast forward to three years later. Though I've progressed a lot, I still can't invert! It doesn't help that I was overweight and at a pretty low fitness level in general when I started pole. At the beginning, I slipped a lot when I tried to climb, I couldn't even spin, and I couldn't walk for days afterward because I just wasn't used to using those muscles. These days, I can climb high, I can do a complete split, I can spin. And my recovery time after a workout is far, far shorter.   As for how I overcame that discouraging feeling, I'm not going to lie; it wasn't easy. I just have to keep repeating to myself: I have a right to be here. I paid money to be here just like anyone else. Even now, there are totally days when I want to give up and ask who I am even kidding. But I just tell myself that if I keep on keeping on, there will be a chance that I will be able to do all the awesome things that my instructors do. But if I give up now? Then it's pretty much guaranteed that I will never be able to do it. Progress has been slow, but my body has done cool things that I never thought I'd be able to do, and I try to look forward to the cool things that I have yet to do. And of course, there's the liberating feeling of being able to express myself as I dance/do the floorwork.  I hope this helps! Just know that if I can do it, anyone can!"

poledancing,2zaeh5,ClockworkMagpie,2,Mon Mar 16 23:10:33 2015 UTC,"Really awesome work!  I've been working on this for a long time, but mine is shaky at best.  Every time I  push my torso up, I feel incredibly unstable, so I never push up very far.  Any tips?"
poledancing,2zaeh5,girl-replica,3,Tue Mar 17 13:47:51 2015 UTC,"I think that the free leg helps with stability here. When I push it out while trying to bring it above me I'm much more shaky. So before you even begin to exit the brass monkey, just lower that leg as much as you can, and then try to push out.  You might be gripping too high with the hand that is on the pole, which is less stable than lower grip. So that's something to play with. Or maybe you you don't keep the back of the thigh on the pole, and that knee grip is not as tight as in inside/out leg hangs.  Or maybe you just need a spotter a couple of times to gain the confidence in this position. It feels much more scary than it is, because the brass monkey leg grip is kind of odd to us.   Let me know if any of these helped!"
poledancing,2zaeh5,girl-replica,2,Tue Mar 17 15:22:02 2015 UTC,"Aha!  I got it!  It was definitely the thigh.

I stick to brass like crazy to the point that I ripped skin off of my wrist because my body was spinning but my hand wasn't and my wrist started to wrap the pole and kept going with the momentum of my body.  Then on the 3rd class I realized there were some chrome poles in the back and I started using those instead. NIGHT and DAY I tell you! I feel like I'm able to do all the same things that everyone else was able to do on the brass now and I love it. Check with your studio to see if there are different types of poles and, if so, try them all out and see if you notice a difference. If not, definitely try some of the suggestions the other people have already posted. Best of luck to you!"

poledancing,2z2l7c,candy_heart,4,Sat Mar 14 23:55:42 2015 UTC,"Totally normal to bruise behind the knees on any kneehold-based move, as least when initially training it. Are you holding your cupid by grabbing on to your leg with one arm? If so, you might be pulling too hard. The goal with a cupid is to be able to hold it hands-free, and bruising usually isn't THAT bad.  If you can't invert on your left side, just start training conditioning exercises on that side until it ""catches up"". I'm sure there was some point where you couldn't invert on your right side either, but you got there eventually with practice, right? :)"
poledancing,2z2l7c,larafrompinkpony,1 point,Sun Mar 15 01:36:10 2015 UTC,"for the Cupid I hold on to the pole with my hand(s) until my knee grip is super tight, then I let go and reach back for the pole when I feel like it's too much. I think the only way to hold yourself is just with a death grip behind your knee, right? my lower foot steadies me but I don't want to rely on it completely in case it slides off."
poledancing,2z2l7c,larafrompinkpony,7,Sun Mar 15 01:42:29 2015 UTC,"Noooo! Actually, the Cupid is a push-pull balance move! It's deceptive looking! My top leg is definitely hooked, but it's not really gripped onto the pole as tightly as I would grip with my hand!  For me, the trick to a good cupid is to 1.) push your hips forward as much as possible. Like, REALLY thrust your cooch forward. COOCH FORWARD. 2.) To make sure you're getting a good geometry for the push/pull, I bend my lower leg before I plant it on the pole. As I plant my foot on the pole, I'm pushing my hips forward, and my foot slips down a little bit.   The sweet spot is when my top leg is about perpendicular to my torso, and my bottom leg is straight and planted on the pole. I'm pushing against the pole with my foot on the bottom leg, and I'm leaning out as much as I can while keeping the top leg hooked.   Having a good, stable geometry really helps keep you in the position with an minimum expenditure of energy, though grip behind your knee and on the bottom of your foot definitely matters."

I started taking bromelain(pineapple stem supplement) and arnica(leopards bane) supplements along with vit E.

There's always ""body waves""...  Honestly, I don't see much value in choreographing a dance using pole move names. A casual observer isn't going to know the names of the moves, so they won't get what you're trying to go for.

poledancing,2yx5rt,Thingssezme,3,Fri Mar 13 15:56:14 2015 UTC,I find it easier with a chair to be resting my bottom hand lightly against the pole rather than gripping so that I can get that push with my shoulders and arms.
poledancing,2yx5rt,takhana,2,Fri Mar 13 16:50:36 2015 UTC,"The grip is a fine balance. it has to be tight enough that you don't fall off the pole immediately, but if you grip too tight, you lose momentum and ultimately fall down the pole.   Try loosening up just a tiny bit and seeing if it helps. I also recommend the bottom hand to be ""pushing away"" on the pole rather than gripping it."
poledancing,2yx5rt,mai_z,2,Fri Mar 13 16:06:20 2015 UTC,"I also recommend the bottom hand to be ""pushing away"" on the pole rather than gripping it.   That is good advice.  In a chair you don't need to close the fingers of the lower hand.  It's just for pushing."
poledancing,2yx5rt,PhotonInABox,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:54:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I definitely realized I was gripping way too hard, and was able to finally complete a partial spin by easing up."
poledancing,2yx5rt,Naibii,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:09:18 2015 UTC,It sounds like you're gripping a little bit too much so allow yourself to relax a little bit but obviously while still holding yourself up. Doing an elegant chair spin took me ages as well and what really helped me was bracing my lower hand against the pole instead of gripping on. It's easier to keep your body at a distance from the pole and allows your hand to spin with your body. So just put the palm of your hand against the pole while spinning and it should help. also make sure your upper hand isn't too high above your head.

poledancing,2yrva6,Arcsis,11,Thu Mar 12 07:48:49 2015 UTC,"agreed. it's really upsetting to me that I'm not comfortable sharing my pole accomplishments with acquaintances or coworkers because I'm afraid that they'll judge me. I especially don't want the uninvited sexual comments that will surely follow. I even hate when guys learn that I'm doing this and they look over at my husband with a leery grin and congratulate him. ugh. Why can't it be recognized just as other dancers' arts are?

poledancing,2yr2na,_pi9,6,Thu Mar 12 02:27:51 2015 UTC,"Its super easy. I always do it alone. Just screw the pole up enough that it wont fall when you let go, then take a level and hold it against the pole and walk with it in a circle around the pole. (Hope that part makes sense.) If you get to a spot where the bubble changes, shift the pole as needed, and when you've got it all straight then tighten it up the rest of the way.  And of course, make sure you put it up on a stud. I made pencil marks where mine goes. Its hardly noticeable on the ceiling and makes it way easier to put the pole back up in the right place."

My method is: Put it up not super tight, check it with the level from different axes until you find a direction that's off, loosen it slowly so it's just barely movable, adjust in the problem direction, and start the checking over again.  Once you can't find an angle that's off, you're done.  It's a bit of a pain, but you can do it with one person.  :)"

poledancing,2yjxtp,leecheese,2,Tue Mar 10 15:21:03 2015 UTC,"Ha, I'm in Florida and like the FB page of the magazine she drew that for. Definitely tank tops are the biggest seller in the pole world, but they have to be the right style: thin, maybe burnout or the kind that have raw edges, racerback... and black is always a good color, but we tend to go for bright colors as well! I'd love to see that style of art with several different moves, and not the super hard ones. There are tons of pole prints but the silhouette of the dancer is always in an incredibly advanced pose, where tons of flexibility is required. I never want to get those because then people will inevitably ask, ""Can you do that?"" and when I say no, they assume I'm not that good. Well, I'm decent, but I can't touch my head to the back of my knee! My studio sells custom printed tanks and we just found a local printing place that does them. You can either bring in your own shirts - say from Target - or buy from a catalog there and they screen print them. I agree with at least one other poster: Kickstarter might be a good idea for her."

Yeah society6 is great- they do a lot of the hard work involved with selling stuff- but the artist ends up making very little on things like shirts. I think you're right it's a really great way to see what designs are popular without investing a lot. Once she is sure the interest is there- we're hoping to open an etsy shop and sell more designs and hopefully grow this.  And yeah, I'm really excited for her. Pole and the community and lyra and all that stuff- it's her life. She loves it, she's so passionate about learning new things and improving. And I guess I've always worried that there will be a time where her body can't really continue to do it the way she does it now, (hopefully way in the future!!) and she'll be sad to leave this world in the past, but hopefully selling merch and maybe even doing so at competitions will be a fantastic way for her to stay involved in the community for years and years to come."

I like wearing cute and/or subtle pole-themed shirts around, and I had to go through a ludicrous amount of tacky silhouettes and tasteless joke shirts to find the, like, four cute shirts I have.  Kudos to your friend, her art is lovely.  For me personally, I know that I would be most likely to buy a tank top (in black, rather than white, because I am a walking disaster zone when wearing white), a print, or a water bottle for class.  I personally wouldn't buy blankets or throw pillows, because that's not really what I'm into.  My guess, just based on my own preferences, is that shirts and prints would sell best, followed by totes.  I can't wait to see what else your friend comes up with!"

Which isn't to say that they can't be used! I've had lots of people telling me they installed one, and had big 250 pound dudes jumping on it and it's held up fine, blah blah blah. But for me personally, I don't trust plastic, particularly because torsional strain weakens it over time so much more than metal. People who buy the prop-poles tend to only really use it for very, very occasional use - like Valentine's Day/bachelorette party type occasional usage. They are probably not working on full moons or handsprings, or extended sequences of moves. For that, I would rather have my pole be waaay overengineered, rather than ""my buddy jumped on it a couple times and it was okay.""   Looking at the amazon reviews for the Bada Bing pole, it looks like a knockoff of the first generation of X-poles, where they had you screw each piece together instead of using the X-joint that they use now. I'm told the main reason X-pole discontinued that style is because they are IMPOSSIBLE to get apart after a while. The threads get stuck or something. It's not truly a removable/takeapartable pole like the X-jointed poles. Another part that concerns me is that the top of the pole that inserts into the ceiling dome looks like it's made of black plastic, instead of solid one-piece steel construction like an X-pole. That could be a potential critical failure point.  Anyway, if money is tight - check your local craigslist. I see X-poles up there for sale all the time, often for very cheap."

poledancing,2xu1pk,ClockworkMagpie,2,Tue Mar 3 23:09:48 2015 UTC,"We just had a discussion about cross training!   Flexibility is a great practice for the days where you are off the pole, and you'll save yourself a lot of frustration later on. I haven't worked on flexibility from the early on, and one day I realized all the tricks for my level also require the flexibility I did not work on.    Floorwork and acro can make a good supplement for pole training, and you don't have to have a pole for them.  Other than cross training and flex training, I try to schedule rest days as much as training days. Sometimes the best way to gain power is to let your body rest, regroup and recover."

poledancing,2xqxl8,astrophela,3,Mon Mar 9 13:03:44 2015 UTC,"I have a tendency towards foot cramps as well.  The two things that help me the most are hydration and warming up my feet.  Dehydration is a common cause of muscle cramping, so I try to drink a lot of water throughout the day, not just when I'm about to pole.  I also warm up my feet by, while standing, pushing the top of one foot into the ground while the other is flat, and then switching feet every few seconds.  The other warm up I do is one-footed calf-raises.  I bend the unused knee to tuck the unused foot at my side, hold pole or wall for balance, and try to lower myself down slowly after going up as high as I can."
poledancing,2xqxl8,girl-replica,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:47:20 2015 UTC,"Depending on how low your diet is in salt, and how much you sweat/workout, you might want to think about hydrating with electrolytes in your water (or buy Gatorade).  Hydrating is one thing, hydrating smart is another.  It's easy for some athletes to get too much water and too little electrolytes.  Just depends on you and your routine."

poledancing,2xqxl8,ClockworkMagpie,2,Tue Mar 3 20:14:57 2015 UTC,I used to get much more foot cramps back at the time. I feel like just working on my pointe and strengthening the foot muscles helped. After all you try to hold that muscle for extended period of time in a state it's not used to.
poledancing,2xqxl8,vampire_kitty,2,Tue Mar 3 23:36:16 2015 UTC,"Muscle cramping is generally related to a deficiency of magnesium, as several others have suggested. If, like me, you prefer to get your RDA vitamins and minerals from real food instead of supplements, check out squash and/or pumpkin seeds (VERY high in magnesium), mackarel, and (if you like it, I hate it personally) dark chocolate. These are fairly high in magnesium with things like avocados, dried figs, and (if you eat them, I personally do not) beans and lentils coming in close behind.  While spinach and certain whole grains are also high in magnesium, they also have many nutrients included that hinder absorption by the body. The bioavailable amount of magnesium in these foods is much lower than their straight up values, which is exactly the same with supplements (some of them being absorbed at as low as 4% of the dose in the supplement). This lengthy article references many topics about absorption and bioavailability of magnesium which highlights some of those topics.  Additionally, I haven't researched this personally and a cursory internet search is not finding a lot of research-based or very detailed information, but Epsom salts are magnesium-sulfate and are highly regarded as a good soak for when you have muscle cramps. I'm going to assume it's because of the magnesium and it's effects on muscle cramping in general but I cannot say for sure. In any case, that's another option as well for you to research and implement if you feel it would be right for you.  In any case, increase your magnesium and your cramping should go away. Obviously you want to be well hydrated, between 8-12 glasses of water per day, but you already indicated that you are drinking plenty of water so I'll assume that's already covered. Best of luck!"
poledancing,2xqxl8,angelagabbie,1 point,Fri Mar 6 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"There are a bunch of sports articles that say eating pickles or taking a shot of pickle juice helps with cramping. Also like WiggleBums said, I've heard of magnesium helping too."

poledancing,2xoz6n,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:22:32 2015 UTC,There are so many levels people can be at with their stretching that can range from beginner to contortion that putting together a routine would be quite difficult. I encourage everyone to find something at their level (and that relates to their sport of choice) to help them advance.

I guess to make it more comfortable to those who may be new that photos of them in booty shorts and a sports bra with a sweaty face wont end up on some random person's blog or website or shown to men? I dunno, that's my best guess. A LOT of places in my geographic region are like this - no photos allowed (except by approved photographers the establishment provides, usually only for advertising purposes) and no men allowed. In fact, this particular establishment got railed on yelp for not allowing transgender women to attend. I'm going to be moving soon and wont be sad to find a new studio that allows men as well as photos and videos."

poledancing,2xfwxb,ClicheTheCamgirl,8,Sat Feb 28 06:54:39 2015 UTC,"Arching your back is not a good cue in this Ayesha variation, especially for somebody who just started to learn it.  When your back is arching, it I'd harder for your core to engage and hold your hips in, and it feels like they are about to roll out with the rest of the legs. In more advanced variations, for example when you extend legs into a split, arching the back needs to happen to lower the back leg, and the entire thing requires much more strength than straddle legs.   So since you are not there yet, no arching the back. You are trying to release the legs, but you fall forward because you don't allow your hips to move back enough. Your body thinks it is dangerous to be away from the pole, when in reality the most steady position is when your torso continues the line of the bottom arm, instead of going straight up.  To train this, work on your inverted D first. Invert, caterpillar up, switch the grip, and slowly release the knees while still catching the pole with the ankles. Push your body out until the legs are straight and the ankles are near your upper hand.  In this position, you body learns that it is not scary to be away from the pole, and actually rather stable. Practice only this for a while until it becomes comfortable. Once you are confident in your Inverted D, try to slowly, carefully, release the ankles and test our the balance. Once you are able to balance, you'll be able to move your legs into the straddle, and this time your hips will do the right thing."
poledancing,2xfwxb,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this detailed description. I've never heard of ""inverted D"" before, I'll go look that up."
poledancing,2xfwxb,WesternGate,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"This is good advice, the inverted D position will help you get your hips the correct distance from the pole and also help you find the right distance for your grip and shoulders. I came to add that when in the D position, start thinking about your core and your pelvic tilt. To tilt your pelvis slightly in and down with your lower core helps to keep you balance and keep the larger muscles of your abdomen tight and engaged. To do this, think of taking your belly button and tucking it in your pockets (as if you were wearing pants). In twisted grip, it will also help you keep your hips squared to the ceiling, as your grip will want to twist you out of square. This way, if someone were to come and touch your tummy while in Ayesha, they would feel every muscle of your abs drawn tight!"
poledancing,2xfwxb,ayamami,4,Sun Mar 1 05:38:29 2015 UTC,I got this recently and I'm still working on pushing my legs down. However what helped me was to push me butt backwards so I do a proper inverted d. This forms a straight line from bottom arm up to butt to make a nice triangle.
poledancing,2xfwxb,mspunctuated,4,Sat Feb 28 11:20:08 2015 UTC,"I think the ""look at the ceiling"" is a better cue for your neck and shoulders than your back. If you look at the form on this move - even in your illustration, the back is not arched at all - it's very straight! Looking at the photo: she is making a straight line from her base arm all the way to her butt! No curves at all! You can look at the ceiling without arching if you are keeping your core engaged!  I agree with /u/clockworkmagpie - it's probably safest to work on a simpler variation until you get the form down. We also use the Inverted D in my studio as a prep for this move.  Incidentally, you already have your regular Ayesha, right?  Once you get the ""inverted D"" with your feet on the pole (maybe use a crash mat and/or a spotter!), try going into an ""egg"" - make a ball with your body, knees in. THEN once you've developed the strength, muscle memory, and form to hold this ""egg"" position, moving into the 'twisted grip ayesha' should be cake! From there you can work on extending out and cleaning up the lines.  Also, I think a lot of your form issues in this move will be corrected with the strengthening and engagement of your core. It can be frustrating to concentrate your training in a different direction, but ultimately patience with developing your form will make you a better dancer.  Finally, be very very careful with your shoulders here. Check out your form on your shoulders - make sure they're engaged and squared. The twisted grip handspring/hold has claimed many shoulders!  Good luck, congrats on your progress so far, and keep us updated!  (Edited for clarity)"
poledancing,2xfwxb,larafrompinkpony,3,Sat Feb 28 20:13:56 2015 UTC,"Previous comments on body position and widening the distance between your arms are all REALLY good advice. If your body is leaning in towards the pole like that, it's a really unsafe/unstable position, because you are not fully engaging your shoulder on the bottom arm. This is a bad habit I've seen in a lot of self-taught polers who are strong and light enough to hold the position - but it's definitely not good for you in the long run! Especially if you want to progress to more advanced moves!  How's your butterfly and extended butterfly? Get those down like you could do them asleep before going further with the split grip ayesha. I really like the popup butterfly (apprentice to butterfly) as a way of training stability on this position and finding a good position for your hands.   (Side note -- you're doing a split grip, not a twisted grip!)"
poledancing,2xfwxb,larafrompinkpony,1 point,Sat Feb 28 19:33:10 2015 UTC,"My butterflies are strong, been doing those for 2 years now. And I agree about the pop-up butterfly being a great trainer! It's really a great move to get comfortable with being inverted, etc.    I'm not totally self taught, I was part of a studio for a year and half, but had to quit (no money), so my arms span in this move comes from my instructor who said to keep it small. But I will totally try it the way you're saying, and the other commenter mentioned, I'll extend it."
poledancing,2xfwxb,riotmaker37,2,Sat Feb 28 20:39:09 2015 UTC,"In that case, you can go easily into an inverted D from an extended butterfly. It's just leaning out from the pole as much as you can - and keeping both your toes/feet on the pole for balance. In gymnastics, that ""bowing out your back"" you mentioned is called ""hollow body position"" and it's pretty essential in holding a stable handstand - and that is exactly what these split/twisted grip positions are on the pole. It's not really curling your back so much as doing a crunch and holding your abs in, keeping your hips tucked forward. A lot of people arch their backs in handstands, and it's mostly because they are not extending their arms out and engaging the shoulders as much as they could/should be. I suspect practicing handstands or even forearm stands will help you quite a bit too with the body positioning!"
poledancing,2xfpy1,soundslikeapotato,13,Sat Feb 28 05:26:08 2015 UTC,"The difference is the engineering.   You really don't want to be part of a fail video, you don't want something with all the engineering of a shower rod spring.    The $250-$400 poles you see for sale are not just a pole, but they are built out of special material (chrome, brass, or TITANIUM) with a screw in the top of the pole, to pressure mount it. The pressure mounting is a big deal.    It not only saves one from pounding nails into the ceiling, but stabilizes the pole to a degree that cheaper poles just can't.   I went on Amazon in 2012 and bought a 45mm titanium static X-pole for $400 that you can get for $250 now. And it's never budged, paid for itself, been totally worth it.    I've seen youtube videos of girls making their own poles, but the real problem is they are made out of steel. Which, in my opinion, just isn't super awesome for what you need to slide and grip. I love titanium and powdercoat paint."
poledancing,2xfpy1,ClicheTheCamgirl,2,Sat Feb 28 07:11:00 2015 UTC,"Great response to this question. The poles we use have very specific coatings - some are even scientifically engineered to interact with your skin! No, your pole doesn't have to spin, and sure, you could probably use a hardware pole to work on very beginner moves such as a simple pole walk or even a full bracket stand. In the long run, though, you will almost certainly either become frustrated and give up on pole entirely, or you will end up spending the extra money on a real pole anyway. A hardware store pole simply does not have the correct coating to support your skin for holds and intermediate to advanced spins (or spins at all, more likely). If you don't believe it, try playing around on a stop sign.  On safety: Pole fitness is a sport, and it can be a very dangerous one. In certain moves, your head is the closest thing to the ground. Are you confident enough in your pole to literally trust it with your life? You should be. Can you find a pole for less than $200 that you trust with your life? Probably not. Used poles from reputable dealers can be ok, but PLEASE do not overlook the importance of researching the type of pole that is best for your safety, your climate, and the type of activity you are using it for. (Want to compete? Better make sure it's a competition width! Just want to practice what you're learning in the studio? Find out what kind they have. You fight as you train!)  I can't stress the amount of research that should go into this decision. For example, I have never had one myself but I hear brass poles have a lot of upkeep (plus they always make my hands smell all brassy and have too much give, but they are great for beginners!) Powder coats can burn your skin, and some poles don't work well with certain grip aids.  When my students begin asking questions about poles I tell them, if you were into, say, mountain climbing, you  wouldn't be like, ""I bet I could just buy some hooks from the Dollar Store!"" Buying a cheap pole is just as risky! You're right about those fail videos - even if you know what you're doing, you can still really set yourself up for injury by using an unsafe pole. OP - Xpole, Lil Minx, and Platinum Stages are all reputable companies, explore their pricing and maybe start saving!  /u/clichethecampgirl: I have had a titanium coated X-pole since 2010 and I HATE the grip, and powdercoats too! Powdercoats BURN on spins and drops! And the titanium coating on my pole is absolutely terrible in my humid climate. I believe the titanium are mostly discontinued at this point, and you won't find them in many studios or competitions. You're really the first person I've heard mention them (besides Aerial Amy) in a positive way! What am I missing? I'm curious as to what grip aids, if any, do you use on your Titanium? Do you prefer the coating because you have a strong preference for holds or spins? What specifically do you like about it?"
poledancing,2xfpy1,mspunctuated,2,Sat Feb 28 20:49:49 2015 UTC,"I've never met anyone who wasn't a fan of Titanium. It warms up perfectly, it's great for everything. I use just regular ole Dry Hands when I need a grip aid.    True, though, about the powder coat poles..they can burn, but are great for beginners. The studio I used to go to had powder coat poles (Studio Rio in VA) and I loved them when I first started. They toughened up my skin in a good way to start with.    Brass is my least favorite, there's just no balance for me with my skin type. It's either I stick, and bleed, or I get zero grip because I'm the slightest bit sweaty. I don't get that at all with my Titanium.  What do you use MsPunctuated?"
poledancing,2xfpy1,ClicheTheCamgirl,3,Sat Feb 28 21:01:27 2015 UTC,"That's crazy! I suspect the titanium coating could be partially a climate thing - I didn't really mind mine as much in Maryland (and when I was a relative beginner), but in the south it's really difficult for grips and I don't like the way certain aids - especially tac - interacts with it. You're in VA? What do you think?  I never thought of powder coats as being a way for beginners to condition the skin, the burn is just awful! I won't do spins or drops on them at all, but I could see how they might be useful as training aids.  Thanks for asking! My personal pole is titanium coated, 50mm Xpole sport, non-spin. It's sturdy, but it's so outdated I use it mostly just for strength training at this point. Although of course there are certain moves (like the Titanic!) that are better on 50mms!  For my first two years of pole (in Maryland), I learned on a brass 50mm, and have taught workshops at a studio that uses brass. They are great for beginners, but not my preference either. Like you, I find that they are too rough on my skin!  My home studio has a few different types of poles in different rooms, but our advanced classes use competition poles - 45mm chrome, which is my STRONG preference. Every competition I have been to has used this type, but I hear overseas they are moving into 40mms and even 35mms! What!  We also have 50mm powder in another room, but we no longer use them for pole (they have hooks for other aerial equipment such as lyra and aerial yoga)."

And although we were all trying to look sexy, there's a lot of grunting with effort.  A lot of pretty un-sexy noises.  People asking questions of the instructor.  A little cursing when someone gets a new pole bruise.  Music in the background.  Everyone looks and feels like they're working out- a little sweaty and gross and trying to stop their ponytails from getting in their faces.    Remember, the photos on the websites are taken when someone comes down to a likely advanced class with a camera, takes some shots, edits out everyone who happened to look weird at that particular moment, and then chooses specifically images that will make the studio look appealing to the masses, like they produce the ""pretty, fit... girls"" you observed.

Everyone, even the most advanced girls, and even the girls you see in those photos was once a beginner. It doesn't start off sexy, it doesn't feel graceful. It hurts, you fart in an invert, you get nasty bruises, but you put in the work and build the strength and the grace comes. If you walk into a pole studio and project the judgements you have toward yourself as coming from other people, you are closing yourself off to the way pole helps you grow. Pole is a community of women strengthening each other. The body comes with training, patience, and practice, it's not a requirement. You become inspired by the advanced girls and you get excited by the progress of your classmates.   But you'll never know if you don't try! Get at it girl!"

poledancing,2xbrni,MyPigWaddles,3,Fri Feb 27 22:07:37 2015 UTC,"Do it!!! One of the best pieces of advice that I got from my instructor that I still remind myself of all the time is to not compare yourself to other people. Pole is such an expressive art and it can be so personal, let that shine through and do your thing! There is always going to be someone who can do a move you can't etc... But it doesn't matter because it's not about them it's about you! I hope you go give it a try and if you do update us on how it was! Also take a picture or video of your first class or two and if you keep with it video yourself after a few more classes, you will be amazed and so proud of your progress!"
poledancing,2xbrni,cacciatore_love,2,Fri Feb 27 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"About fitting in with the people, it'll be like any other activity: you'll get a variety of people there, probably most of them very nice, and you may or may not have a gigantic amount in common with them. If there are a couple of studios near you, chances are one of them at least will have a group you feel comfortable with.   About fitting in skill and confidence-wise, like others have said, everyone starts out a clumsy beginner. You may suck for a while, but you'll get better. Everyone does. Or you may surprise yourself and find that you're really good right away! The most important thing in my opinion is not to look at others' early progress and assume you suck more than normal if they get something you don't! If you can get used to focusing on and being proud of your own achievements and improvements, you'll really enjoy yourself. What I love about pole dancing is how easy it is to see yourself learn new things. It's not like being, say, a basketballer, where the improvement is barely noticeable day by day; last week I learned 2 new moves, and therefore I am better than I was 2 weeks ago, even if it's only a little bit. I find that really rewarding and worth it, even if I still suck at some things.  I hope you give a class a try and enjoy yourself!"
poledancing,2xbrni,command-t,2,Fri Feb 27 09:32:49 2015 UTC,"You're who we all were once.  None of us were polers, but we became polers with practice. I took my first class in soffe shorts or Capri sweats I don't remember. Try it and the rest will follow. If you like it, you'll start buying short shorts, become comfortable losing clothes throughout a class as you need more grip or get warm, and you'll become strong and confident if you about yourself and work at it. :)  That pole studio I tried was the first place I ever truly felt that I fit. If you do not discover the most accepting, encouraging group of people you know, try other studios. In general, polers are not the catty, insecure, destructively competitive types you might expect in other female dominated sports. We understand that everyone is on a different journey and we all have something to learn and to teach one another. Being on the same level as someone else does not mean you will know all of the same things or be good at the same moves. Don't ever compare yourself to others, just to who you were before.   Try it. It might be the best thing you've ever done."

I'm not totally out of shape or overweight, but I definitely have a different body than the others in my class. And I care less and less about it each lesson.  I also had to specifically buy clothes for pole, as I'm sure everyone has to. I hated it at first, as I felt odd and exposed in short shorts and tank tops, but now I don't think twice about it - everyone's in the same type of clothes anyway. Everyone's got their own complexes about their body, but at lessons we're all just excited for each other - one girl who finally nailed a move that required strength she didn't have before, or another girl who was able to pull off an inversion with a lot more grace than in the previous lesson, etc. The silly little things you notice - you're straining with a not-sexy face or squishing your belly/arm/leg fat in a weird way, etc. - are things that everyone deals with. When moving around on the mats for floor work, I make the same weird sounds as does the girl who's been doing it for months or years!  Lastly, like others said - for better or worse, the studios are basically required to use the best shots for their website. Think about the pamphlets for a university and then about the actual group of people you spent your college life with - probably much more diverse!"

poledancing,2x7kok,BearSmasher,1 point,Thu Feb 26 07:01:47 2015 UTC,"Rohto Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion Moist    I've only used this on my face, but it's oil-free and won't get slippery if/when you get sweaty like lotion tends to do. It has a watery texture, not quite a gel but thicker than water. You only need a couple drops for your whole face so I'd imagine it could go a long way on your body too. It's best to put on slightly moist skin such as after you shower, but for my face sometimes I just wet my face and towel dry before I apply it.    I have super dry skin on my arms and legs too, so at night after I shower I use oil (mineral, coconut, avocado, vitamin e are all good) before I go to bed to seal in moisture and let my skin heal from flakes. It completely absorbs by morning and also doesn't get slippery again if I get sweaty (like during run sessions) or wet (from rain or humidity)."

There are other pole-specific lotions but I think you can make do with water-based, non-greasy lotions you can buy in the store w/o dishing out a little more $$$ for such a specific lotion that you'll have to order online.  Baby lotion is great! One time in class my legs were soooo dry that I had zero grip when climbing. My fellow classmate busted out some Johnson's baby lotion and she put just enough on the BACK of my hand, NOT my palm, and told me spread it on my legs like that. It worked!!

poledancing,2x7cov,girl-replica,2,Thu Feb 26 05:35:01 2015 UTC,"The simple answer is: your booty is too high in the air. It's easier to hold a shoulder mount in that position because your weight is ""stacked"" in a ~45 degree angle, instead of extended out at ~90 degrees, which is way more work. This is actually pretty normal and common, and maybe just something to just work on as you build strength while holding a shoulder mount-V. For me, I know I'm at a 90 degree angle when I feel like I'm precariously holding onto the shoulder mount and about to fall out of it!  Shoulder slipping down is also pretty common with a shoulder mount - it's a habit I share as well. It will make extending your back harder, so try to minimize the slipping."

poledancing,2x5yrq,MyMuddyEyes,3,Wed Feb 25 22:42:12 2015 UTC,"Protein powders or shakes are really only necessary if you find yourself having trouble getting the recommended amount to support muscle growth -- most recent figure I've used is .8g of protein per lb of bodyweight. That said, you are going to experience almost zero muscle growth if you also don't eat enough calories to build it, though you may get stronger without putting on mass. So you might want to track your calories and protein intake for a bit to get an idea as to whether you even need the protein or extra calories, or if you get enough through simply eating food.  As far as timing goes, it doesn't really matter that much, it's mostly broscience. If you aren't a bodybuilder, going by the amount of protein you get in a 24-hour period should be sufficient."

I think /u/trialblog is right that it doesn't matter when you eat a protein supplement.  I eat mine for breakfast at work and it keeps me energized and focused until lunch time.  I think that's just because it's food I wasn't eating before, though.  My biggest problem is that I hate the taste.  The best I've done so far is mix 1 scoop with a little cup of greek yogurt.

You'd have to be able to straddle and/or bend your knees and it's not very pretty when you do both and impossible to do with a flat, regular straddle.

You definitely have the strength to do a straight leg invert, since you came down very controlled in a straight leg fashion.

I'm looking to get foot thongs to keep them together so that even when I stand on my toes (they normally splay out so much when I rest on the balls of my feet) they would look more graceful and ""normal"". is there anything you would add to body movements?

poledancing,2wx4xe,mai_z,2,Tue Feb 24 00:50:54 2015 UTC,"I'd say that going into your invert is a little messy. I think it's to do with your legs going up at different times? You kind of fling one up in a spin and then the other one joins it a bit awkwardly. You should be deadlifting your weight, really rather than kicking into it. When you bring your legs back down it's lovely and controlled, though. Try to aim for doing exactly that but in reverse when you invert, because that looks lovely.  Other than that, you might need to work on the fluidity of transitions between moves, but I think that some of the stunted feeling is partly because of space restrictions and because you are (I assume) freestyling more than doing an actual routine.  Once you've got something a bit more defined set out, you can polish up your transitions and your lines and work on getting a bit more confidence and attitude into the performance. You look like you've got good stamina and strength, so I think it's just those finishing touches that you might want to work on. But you're starting from a good place :)  Good luck in the competition! You'll have to let us know how you get on!"

The feeling of achieving something new is such a high that it's made me care a lot about practicing and taking care of myself physically.

So, like most studios, it was a room full of poles and mirrors floor to ceiling on two facing walls. They light it like a club with black lights so some of the outfits were dayglow which was spectacular.  In any case, I've certainly taken many dance classes of various sorts in the past, I've done exercise in gyms full of mirrors and the whole bit. I'm comfortable with my body, but I don't pay too much attention to it on the whole. But at that class? I was looking in the mirror and thinking, ""hot damn, that's ME?? ~I~ made that sexy move right there?? REALLY??!!??"" I had NO concept of how amazing and yet easy it was to look extremely seductive just doing something as simple as standing up from the bottom of a spin, holding the pole and leaning out away from it. That's definitely a movement that's not possible without holding onto something else so I've never seen my body make that sort of movement or look like that in a mirror before. It was REALLY awesome and I can't even imagine how mesmerizing it will look and feel once I know how to actually do a proper movement, not just some fumbling around during my very first class ever. :D  So yes, the answer to your question is yes!"

poledancing,2wso4l,Fuzz_Buttz,2,Sun Feb 22 20:58:35 2015 UTC,"So a music video is an awesome medium because you can actually play with lengths of your combos and the speed of the recording.   You can always do short combos as separate takes and cut from one to the next. This will be way easier than making a full length fluent choreography, not to mention executing it perfectly (shooting on a pole is very tiring, don't expect to be able to hang up there for more than 2-3 hours, and that is a bit much). You'll be able to jump from one move to the other, from up the pole to the floor, cut out awkward entrances and just spin in a pretty position.  The other cool thing is slo-mo. Slow motion is so awesome to showcase how epic some moves are. Even a simple swing around can look exceptional is you do it in slo-mo. Hell, just do a hair flip in slo-mo and it would look epic. It will also lengthen each piece and allow you to do less to fill up the entire song.  Lastly, work with what you know. New moves will look not as good as the ones you know well, and will frustrate you more during the shoot. Keep new moves for training, stick to your trusted guns when it's showtime."
poledancing,2wso4l,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:25:50 2015 UTC,"The way I've been taught to work is: you write down your list of moves. You put them in order of easiest, or least tiring, to most difficult, or most tiring. Obviously doing easier moves at the end of the routine is better because then you won't be exhausted. Once they are in order, you think of about 2 transitions between each move, and any floorwork that you want to incorporate too. Then you have a long list of moves that should technically 'flow' into each other. Bam, you have your routine."

poledancing,2wpy6j,MacabreChaos,7,Sun Feb 22 02:18:38 2015 UTC,"I recommend 45mm. It's just kinda become the de facto standard everywhere, other than in strip clubs which seem stuck on the 50. At the studio I learned on, all the poles were 50 and I can do most moves on 50, but I find 45 easier. My hands are on the small side as well.   I'm honestly not super keen on 40mm, because I can't do leg holds or knee-hold based things on those to save my life. Also, if you ever pole in public... you can be sure the pole will usually be a 45 or 50mm, and never a 40mm. It'll probably be more challenging at first, but I think you can't go wrong with a 45mm (it's not terribly hard to adjust up OR down from there) but getting used to 40mm would preclude you from poling on anything other than 40, if that makes sense.  As for finish - I like chrome, as it's also the de facto standard. I find my grip to be better on brass, but chrome works just as well as long as I'm nicely warmed up. (Also, brass gives you that yucky brass smell..)"

I might be in the minority, but my grip is fucking killer on the 40 and I can hold a tg for hours on it. So I totally get why it's tempting to get one. That being said, I would still recommend getting a 45. It's small enough that your hand grip will be good, but big enough that your leg grips won't suffer. Shoulder mount/anything with elbow/knee/thigh grip will be harder to learn on a 40. Also, like many others have mentioned, 45 is the standard, which means it makes sense for you to practice on one so that your tricks will be transferable, even if on a 50.   Purely anecdotal, but my best friend (who also poles) and I were on vacation and a club we went to had a pole in the VIP room! Naturally we got all up on that shit. It was a 50, but luckily we'd trained on my 45 so we could still do 90% of the cool tricks. If we'd been training on 40s, there would've been no way. So if only so you can impress random strangers at a club out of town, get the 45 :)"

I havent had any trouble switching between the two but I do notice that certain things are easier to do on the smaller pole. I would imagine switching between 40mm and 45mm to be pretty similar.  However, take into consideration, if you go for the 40mm at home and go to a studio with 50mm you might have more difficulty switching between the two. This could affect your progress in class."
poledancing,2wpy6j,angelagabbie,2,Sun Feb 22 04:14:00 2015 UTC,"45mm chrome is pretty standard here at most studios in Los Angeles (and rest of Southern California area).  I think 45mm is a safe bet.

Sometimes it feels like it's hard to help appearing sexual just because my shape (wide hips and small waist) comes off that way naturally.   I really want to improve my ability to turn my movements and the shapes my body creates into art.   And I used to look down on the entertainment side of the house, then I saw some videos showing girls doing things in clubs that were just as difficult and more so than what I do in a studio...

Most of my experience in performing pole has been in strip clubs, so my style is definitely on the heels-wearing side, but I particularly enjoy crazy tricks. I love spending as much time as possible airborne. I tend to find body waving and extended sequences of rolling-around-touching-yourself-on-the-floor to be pretty boring... I'll throw them into a routine, but mostly as a chance to catch a breather between stunts! Despite my  preference for acrobatics though, I really value making them pretty and sensual at the same time - really luxuriating in the movements, making smooth transitions, and interacting with the crowd. Stylistically I aspire to something like Michelle Shimmy or Felix Cane. Sexy, but also high on the athleticism. I also really really love Natalia Tatarinseva's style - so clean, fluid, and pretty.  For clarification, I would define ""artistic pole"" as someone like Danielle Romano, ""athletic pole"" as someone like Oona Kivela.

With your head able to directly look at the pole, get into a bracket hold. From the bracket hold, go into something closer to a chair position (chest straight away from the pole, and knees closer in line to the hips, so your shins are parallel to the pole, holding you up.) From that, you should be able to feel much of the pressure on the bottom and top hand, and your heel should be pressing into the pole. From that you can bend your other leg back (if you were in left heel hold, your right foot goes back, right heel hold, left foot goes back). From your picture you are more suited to drop into a gemini/scorpio or pull yourself up into a jasmine rather than a butterfly because you currently have a knee pit hold instead of being held up by mostly your arms with a little bit of pressure from your heel hold."

If that doesn't make sense I'll take a photo of what I mean when I get my little one to sleep :p"
poledancing,2wha16,emm21tm,1 point,Thu Feb 19 22:40:36 2015 UTC,"Your hands are okay, they should straighten out with your body. But you need to push push push with that bottom arm. That is what is really going to rotate you out into the right place. If you push your bottom arm all the way straight and you still aren't vertical then you may need to place your bottom hand higher to give you more room to push up."

For a cross-knee release, you can get into it, and if you are strong enough and feel comfortable enough with your hold, you can squeeze your thighs together once you are secure and slowly straighten the bent leg into a full layback. It's nice because you are already in the right spot for the hold, and if you feel unsteady, you can always reverse the movement to catch yourself back into a ckr."

poledancing,2w8d74,polerrina,7,Tue Feb 17 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"The best exercise that helped me get it were doing crunches as though I were going to invert.  Hold the pole like you're going to invert, engage your shoulders, then lift (don't kick) your knees up to your chest.  Hold them for a second, then slowly lower them back down (you'll get more out of the exercise this way than if you drop them).  Once you can do that comfortably, inverting is just crunching up, letting yourself tip backwards, and straightening your arms.  What finally made it all click for me, once I had the strength, was lifting my knees and then thinking about getting my junk on the pole.  Hope that helps!  You can do it :)"
poledancing,2w8d74,girl-replica,3,Tue Feb 17 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you!! That is good advice. I think if I just make it a habit to practice crunching like that even just a little bit every day, I'll reach my goal :)"
poledancing,2w8d74,Barbag,2,Tue Feb 17 20:51:42 2015 UTC,"My teacher has new students do this from a seated position on the floor at first and just tuck knees up to elbows in a crunch.

poledancing,2w8d74,dancing_marcy,1 point,Wed Feb 18 02:53:10 2015 UTC,"Prep yourself for inverts by crunching, make sure you control the whole way up and when coming down, this is what will really strengthen you. Next is the tipping back, this requires a fair bit of upper back strength, pull ups will help with this and can be done using your pole. if you can't do a full pull up try reversing the action and lowering your self instead of pulling up.   The biggest thing I find with girls learning to invert is they don't aim where to put their foot, they aim for the ceiling, really high up the pole or not at all! As a beginner aim to get your foot just a little above your hands. Look at this spot the whole time during the invert, once you're up keep your chin tucked to your chest and slowly slide down."

poledancing,2w5nmv,iheartlungs,2,Tue Feb 17 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"When you lean back, make sure that the pole is lying flat along the length of your thigh (maximising skin to pole for better grip). You can actually even hold the foot thats crossed over (with the hand on the same side of the pole), it really helped me at first to make sure there's a good ''seal'' there between your leg and the pole. The grip you are looking for isn't from your knees down, its from your thighs. You can practice the grip from the floor if you like, but its much more difficult than off the pole :|"
poledancing,2w5nmv,grimmaul,3,Tue Feb 17 06:58:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, the grip is from your thighs - for me it's really really high up (the pole should be closer to your crotch, not your knees). I'm actually able to release my ankles because I have such a strong grip with my thighs.

poledancing,2w3j70,Saruz,8,Mon Feb 16 18:04:00 2015 UTC,"First of all...breathe.  This event is going to happen, things will occur, and then it will pass.  And no matter what happens, you will learn something and grow from it.  If stamina is an issue, see if you can tone down a few sections.  Unless there's a rule saying ""you must always be transitioning through tricks"", take your time in some of them.  Something that I've discovered is that when I think I've reached the end of my move, then go on to the next trick - the audience doesn't actually have time to process what's happened.  I had a butterfly that I couldn't even tell I had hit (in a video recording).  So I added in a two-count hold, giving myself a moment to breathe, and then moved on.  I could actually see the move now.  It takes up more time, but you give the viewer a snapshot, something to remember and reference you by.  There's nothing wrong with taking a moment to extend a movement and catch your breath.  My first solo I had two aerial-choppers in there so that I could very slowly control my body down to go into a hood ornament.  Having those two relatively simple but strenuous movements in there made the dance stupidly hard.  Remove those two and taking my time going into and extending my hood ornament?  The entire dance suddenly became do-able.  Is there a lull in the music?  Put some slow floorwork in, add dynamics and choreograph in parts that will give your arms a break.    Heck, my doubles-partner and I specifically choreographed in a ""wipe our hands off on our shorts"" moment because our hands were always slick by a certain point in the piece.  So long as you can commit the changes quickly (it's a skill that can be developed) - I don't think there's a rule that says the choreography you came up with at the very beginning HAS to be what you do by the time you perform - evolution of choreography can be as important as the final product itself.  Three days may be a bit difficult to make a change though, depending on how much exercise your ""pick up choreography quickly"" muscle got while growing up.  Sliding happens.  It sucks, but it's a fact of (poledance) life.  Here's the trick I teach in all of my classes - strike a pose, smile (if appropriate), and keep moving until you can find your place in the music and choreography again.  The audience didn't choreograph this.  They don't know what to expect.  So long as you don't let it show on your face or in your body language, they'll never know that they didn't see exactly what you intended for them.  Case in point - two Saturdays ago I did my second ever live (pole) performance.  For my character, I wear a short white wig (which I had intended to keep on the entire time) and a full face mask (which I removed as a part of the character development during the piece).  Sometime during warmup, my elastic strap slipped so the very first time I inverted during my performance: SHWING!  There goes my wig.  My brain went into a fog.  I forgot half of my choreography.  I have no idea what I did to cover it up (other than completely missing my intended ending move), all that I know is that I didn't stop moving.  It was admittedly quite easy to not let it show in my face because I was wearing the full-face mask, but absolutely everyone came up to me afterwards and said that they loved it...ESPECIALLY how I got the wig to fly off that started the whole transformation.  Now the next trick (that I need) to learn is to not tell them they're wrong and that I actually messed up.  If they think your mess-up was amazing, don't let them know it was a mess-up.  ;-)  Be careful about over-exerting your arm.  Try and give it a day's rest - or at least try not to put it through hell.  Drink plenty of water to keep your muscles hydrated, get proper sleep to keep your mind going and elastic.  If it's well and truly shot to all hell...any chance you can tweak the choreography that's hardest on it?  And finally...the reason I actually started responding.  I remember reading an ELI5 recently that asked how we can ""zone out"" while driving down a high-way, not remember any of it, but get to our destination safe and sound.  The top response was along the lines of  ""...we have two parts of our brain that control our body - the forefront and the subconscious.  Muscle Memory lives in the subconscious.  You do it over and over again, it gets stored there and can be recalled at a moment's notice.  The problem for athletes and such is when their ""other"" brain - the one that has to really try like when you're first learning a move - gets activated and tries to perfectly do EVERYTHING by itself rather than calling up the muscle memory.  This is why you'll sometimes see athletes flub up on something that should have been natural to them.  Best advice - step back and take a deep breath (and then try not to think about it).  Supposedly the deep breath quiets your ""forefront"" mind and lets the subconcious muscle memory take over more easily."" ...so that was probably a bit of a bastardization from what I remember of the thread, but I think I got the gist of it...which is ""it's not that your muscle memory has gone on vacation, it's that your brain thinks it knows better and has effectively stuffed a sock in muscle-memory's mouth, then proceeded to trip over its own feet"".  I hope this has given you some hope and food for thought.  Performing is an amazing experience, but it is definitely something that can take some getting used to.  Best of luck to you in your competition, and I hope that it's a wonderful experience for you (even if it doesn't go quite how you imagined).  :-)"

I tried my choreo once today and it was shit but went home instead of trying again because my arm hurt a lot, tomorrow Im getting it taped and hope it helps.

poledancing,2w3pqj,larafrompinkpony,2,Mon Feb 16 20:46:41 2015 UTC,I bruise a lot too. I think some people are just more prone than others. I end up with huge welts whereas my classmates barely get a thing. Arnica doesn't work for me either. I just ice them to reduce swelling and that seems to work the best. I even bruised so bad from my lyra last year they left a deep shadow for over 6 months before clearing up!
poledancing,2w3pqj,ilikedessert,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:55:26 2015 UTC,I think that the skin gets used to the pinching in the thighs and elbows and the pressure from climbing. Over time you may bruise less frequently in the areas that you train often. I always end my night after pole class in a bath with epsom salt to help reduce bruising.
poledancing,2w3pqj,redbudclimb,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:42:36 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to why but to manage the bruising I would recommend topical arnica gel for the area, magnesium and maybe even some glucosamine. As you improve you will begin to place your limbs instead of rough contact which will help. Also your body isn't quite used to it yet!

My knees bruise just from floor work. But I've always kind of bruised like a ripe pear so my main concern about my bruises is fending off awkward questions when people see them.  The bruising will get better with time/experience, I've noticed mine aren't nearly as big or as bloody-looking as they used to be, and they heal a lot faster than they used to. I've heard a lot of good things about Arnica gel, so that might be worth a try? Other than that, if this kind of bruising is not typical for you, maybe see a doctor, try a multivitamin, or eat some leafy green vegetables? (Kale, collard greens, and spinach are high in vitamin K, which is important for blood clotting!)"

I also have a lot of trust in my instructors because they praise us on our progress but stress safety and not getting caught up in trying to move forward too quickly. It's so easy to want to jump ahead but practicing something until it's perfect is really important and the instructors address that in a really caring way  We're also a really friendly studio and try to be supportive and welcoming to each other :)

A little tip to make your life even easier: when descending into an iron x first lower your body to horizontal while the legs remain in a straddle facing up. It would be easier than what you did because none of your legs extends out like in the photo, so you might be able to hold this. If you do find that you can hold this, turn your straddle legs to face to the side but don't leg them be further from the pole than your butt. The further away they are, the more power you need to hold yourself."

If poling at home makes you more comfortable, I think it'd be a good idea to supplement your home training with a drop-in class every so often, especially if you want to attempt more advanced tricks."
poledancing,2voh2p,angelagabbie,5,Thu Feb 12 19:56:09 2015 UTC,"With online tutorials, you don't have anyone there to see your form and correct you, or to encourage you when you're struggling in the same way that you get at a studio.  Also, and I think that this is very important, there is nobody to stop you from doing something dangerous. When you see an amazing move online and you watch tutorials, they always make it look so easy, but you're not always learning appropriate moves for your level of skill or strength.  I tried to practise handsprings in class, which I had been practising at home for a few weeks, and my instructor told me off. She said that I didn't have anywhere near the core strength for it yet and that trying handsprings now was a good way to break my back. She showed me some strengthening exercises that I can do in the meantime to prepare my body, but I haven't tried a handspring since because she told me that it was dangerous."
poledancing,2voh2p,MyMuddyEyes,2,Thu Feb 12 19:48:35 2015 UTC,"trying handsprings now was a good way to break my back   I would love to see how this could happen. While I agree that trying handsprings before you're ready is dangerous, I cannot, for the life of me, see how it is going to break your back.  It is more likely to wreck your shoulders and even tweak your elbow, if you hyper extend the bottom arm, which is common if you don't have enough strength.  I see more people not kick hard enough in handsprings rather than kick too hard. The result of not kicking hard enough is that your feet come straight back down. The result of kicking too hard is that you slam your legs into the pole and end up in an inverted crucifix (with a bruised shin). I have done both on many occasions while learning, but not once have I come close to breaking my back.  Sorry for the rant. I have a thing about teachers who scare students unnecessarily."
poledancing,2voh2p,water_lily,2,Fri Feb 13 07:23:19 2015 UTC,"When I was first learning to handspring and I overtrained it a bit... oh god, my sides. They were so, so sore. I could definitely see straining a lat from trying to handspring."
poledancing,2voh2p,larafrompinkpony,5,Fri Feb 13 16:52:13 2015 UTC,"Online tutorials are much cheaper and more convenient time wise. You can advance at your pace, which can also be nice. If you don't have a studio close by they are probably your only option.  Actual classes are more structured, most likely have a level distinction, beginner intro series to ease a newbie into training. They are safer because there's an instructor that gives you feedback on your form and spots you. It's also nice to be surrounded by other polers who struggle just as you and nail moves and give you motivation. You usually succeed more in a studio, poling alone at home can be intimidating.  I would strongly recommend attending a studio if there is one near you. Especially if you are a beginner, because it's important to learn how to safely train on the pole and it's very helpful when an instructor does a form check and gives you feedback. As you get more confident and experienced, training at home can be a great supplement."
poledancing,2voh2p,ClockworkMagpie,3,Thu Feb 12 19:48:49 2015 UTC,"I generally treat online tutorials as secondary to studio classes, because I definitely need a spot the first few times before I get a move. They can be useful for a different perspective on learning a move you're stuck with, though. I'm also the reckless type that flings herself into moves they're not ready for - sometimes with okay results, but sometimes with... not so good results.   In my experience as an instructor, a lot of self-taught/youtube polers tend to have bad habits that catch up to them later (myself included!) and they end up spending longer having to retrain themselves out of their bad habits."

poledancing,2voh2p,Spicy_lentil_soup,2,Thu Feb 12 22:48:21 2015 UTC,"Other than basic safety, having someone to spot you, and progressing in a level appropriate manner and with proper form, going to a studio builds community and and encourages growth/advancement. I feel that it's important to start out at a studio to build a strong foundation to continue to progress at home, alone. But the reason I keep going to a studio is because it inspires me to keep learning."
poledancing,2voh2p,snadypeepers,1 point,Thu Feb 12 20:55:50 2015 UTC,"I would say to at least work in a gym for six months on a regular basis before switching to a purely ""at home practice"". In pole, especially for beginners, there are a lot of moves that look deceptively easy and these are when the irreversible injuries come into play. Working on a split grip too soon can doom you to a lifetime of physical therapy if you hyper extend your wrists. Same thing with trying to invert without enough core strength. You can strain your back muscle and make it feel like you broke a rib or something. It takes months to heal up too.   This even happens at gyms when students get too ambitious to heed warnings or the instructors are inexperienced. My current gym is brand new in town so many of our students have no pole experience whatsoever. There is also a brand new instructor who is irking me because she thinks that split grip is a perfectly suitable move for beginners when most of the girls at my gym can barely keep their bottom arm straight to push themselves out in standard grip.  I'm restarting pole after having to stop for a few years, so I don't think its in my place to correct our instructor, but while this  gym is led mostly by girls who come from the red light scene and have learned things sporadically themselves (never teaching before), my last gym was led by a highly experienced instructor who is pretty well known in the national competitive arena, and she did not let me split grip until I had been attending regularly for almost three months. I am also no slouch when it comes to what I used to be able to do.  I could handspring shoulder mount and DVD before I had to stop doing pole at my old place. So, I  do quietly tell the girls to switch to standard grip when I see them rubbing their wrists because it hurts....  It's amazing to be a beginner again because even I can feel strain on my bottom hand if I even attempt a split grip now. The difference is, I remember how things are supposed to feel   and I can stop and properly modify myself if anything feels off.  It's hard being patient though, remembering what I was capable of before..."

What helps with me with foot placement: don't just stick your leg out straight and plop it on the pole. Bend your leg first, place it on the pole, THEN push out. That will help you extend your torso out and through the hips - the hips being pushed forward are what really helps keep you in position for this move."

poledancing,2vo311,cupcakery,3,Thu Feb 12 19:49:48 2015 UTC,"What helped me nail cupid was to not hook my top leg too high. In the picture you posted you can see that the angle made by her crotch is greater than 90 degrees, which makes it way harder. Shoot for hooking right at 90 degrees/hip height. When you place your bottom foot on the pole, make sure you're actively pushing. You're looking to be PUSHING with the bottom foot and PULLING with the top knee hook.     Alternatively I know some people have better success getting into cupid from an outside leg hang/gemini. Hit the leg hang then reach up over the hooked leg and pull yourself up, then let your inside/bottom leg drop down and push against the pole.    In both situations, tacking up the bottom foot can help if you're finding it's a sweat issue!"

I always say that it took about two years, I can't tell you the exact amount of time, because I started stretching in 2010 as a part of kickbox-training (which I did at the time). Never took it serious back then so it was more of a forced stretching. I quit kickboxing in 2012 and began pole dancing in 2013, so there is also a one year gap where I did absolutely no stretching.

I really need to add some back stretches and get back to doing it more often.  Make sure you're good and warm when you stretch, and do it as often to you have time for.  Take a break if something is hurting in a bad way.  If you don't overdo it, you can stretch quite frequently, and more frequent work will lead to faster progress.  Best wishes on your road to bendiness :)"

I feel like most pole dancers who don't enjoy working out love pole because it's just so fun that it doesn't feel like work.  And my thing I ALWAYS say to first timers is that everyone is built differently. Some people may take a few classes to perfect their fireman soin while others may get it on first try. Don't compete with others, just yourself :)"

Big name studios are owned by champions and train many of them, but in little podunk towns, pole studios without big names generally barely get by.  My entire paycheck for 2 weeks of teaching at my last studio? $75. Studio didn't even bother giving me my last couple of paychecks. I wasn't doing it for the money - I really, really loved teaching - but it was frustrating considering I wrecked my damn car trying to get to the studio to teach. The studio before that, I didn't even bother filling out the paperwork to get paid because half the time I didn't have any students show up, and I was only getting paid like $3 per student anyway.  I do have a friend who teaches privates out of her house - it's an extra $1000/mo or so for her, but not her main hustle. (She dances at a club as well.)"

I left the 4th class in tears cos everyone else could it but I couldn’t. But I went back the following week and guess what happened? I got it. It clicked. I climbed that damned pole first try on my 5th class and sat up the top cramped against the ceiling for what felt like 10 minutes but was probably only 20 seconds or so revelling in my glory! I felt like Mike frigging Tyson! Everyone has that move or spin that they personally will struggle with so don’t put too much pressure on yourself. It will feel amazing when you get it."
poledancing,2vb0mz,tahlialouise,3,Sat Feb 14 17:16:03 2015 UTC,"I learned to climb a few weeks ago.  The way that clicked for me was ""hand, hand, back foot, front foot, caterpillar, repeat.""  The caterpillar motion up the pole was the bit that really got it for me. When I moved my body away from the pole, I used my legs more to push rather than just try and drag myself up with my arms. It literally looks just like a caterpillar humping it's way up the pole, but hey, I'll fine tune it later!  Tonight was the first night that I tried to climb in proper pole shoes, and they made it all so much easier on my climbing foot. The ""toe strap"" (or whatever) kept the grip on my foot for me, and so I wasn't pushing as hard. No bruises there tonight!  Best of luck with it all!"
poledancing,2vb0mz,takhana,3,Wed Feb 18 11:57:54 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've been poling since October and we've recently started to sit and stand on the pole. It really frigging hurts.

poledancing,2vb0mz,iheartlungs,2,Mon Feb 9 15:36:58 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain! But I guess the more you practice, the more your muscles get used to it. Thanks!"
poledancing,2vb0mz,Melorix,3,Mon Feb 9 18:02:32 2015 UTC,"OK so I always say this to students and I'm like 90% convinced of the truth of it, but my reckoning is that as your muscles get stronger under the surface of the skin, the whole thing 'moves' less when you put it against the pole. Which hurts less. So in other words, as your muscles get stronger, your skin hurts less. Seems to work for me :)"
poledancing,2vb0mz,Melorix,2,Tue Feb 10 10:48:39 2015 UTC,"We've all been there!  It really hurts at the beginning, I know.  But like others have said, you kind of just have to grit your teeth and bear the pain until eventually you'll find it doesn't hurt anymore.  Bruises are part of the sport, too.  Someone else beat me to the Arnica suggestion, so I'll just second it.  There's a few factors that may be giving you trouble for climbing.  Since you've just started, you may not yet have the upper body strength or the grip strength in your hands.  The only remedy for that is to just keep at it!  Sweaty palms may also be a contributing factor.  If you find that's true, try using some grip aids/antiperspirants.  Dry Hands and Tite Grip work absolute wonders for sweaty hands (speaking from experience here -- my hands sweat like CRAZY!).    The beginning of your pole journey can be really disheartening sometimes.  When I was about three months in, I wanted to quit because I hurt.  Everywhere.  But in my heart of hearts, I knew I loved it too much to give it up.  It can be really easy to fall into the, ""Damn, I suck"" mentality, but give yourself a break -- you're only getting started and it's unfair to beat yourself up.  Try not to focus too much on what you're not doing (yet) and focus instead on what you do well. :)"
poledancing,2vb0mz,angelagabbie,2,Mon Feb 9 19:58:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's discouraging when you feel like you just can't get the move, especially when others in the class make it look like a breeze. But thank you, colour me determined."
poledancing,2vb0mz,adriennex1,2,Tue Feb 10 03:50:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it can be really hard to not compare yourself to others in your class.  But everyone has their own journey, and everyone has particular moves they're great at without a second thought as well as nemesis moves.    For instance, I can do leg switches down a 20 foot pole and call that a pretty fun ride, but a cross-ankle release is sheer terror.  I'm envious of the people who can do huge blind hand grab spins, but others are often envious of my control and fluidity on spinning pole.  We all have our unique strengths and challenges.  It's part of what makes the sport so great. :)"

In our studio we started ""sitting"" the stage before climbing, and sitting took weeks for me to do comfortably (by comfortably I mean I don't feel like my flesh is being ripped off). They told me ""eventually it will stop hurting, but then you will learn something new that will hurt. That is part of pole - we are a sadistic bunch!"" haha.   P.S. I can't even inch my way up either and I expect it to be that way for a few weeks. I was the ""below average"" sitter in my class last stage, everyone else was moving on to piking and leaning back and letting go and I couldn't even stay up for 3 seconds. But I'm all caught up now :) and I'm sure you will get it soon too!  *oh also, I've found the itac2 grip for my contact points on my legs during the climb has made a WORLD of difference. Just use the back of your hand to apply it or you won't have a good time with any grips or spins haha."

Strength and making moves pretty comes with time and practice. Don't be afraid of shorts/sports bra, people aren't judging your looks and if they are they're an asshole. The more you pole, the better you will be at pole. Listen to your body, if you are hurting address it.  Don't let injuries linger. Don't be afraid to ask questions about things. If you go to pole jam and you see somebody doing an awesome move that you want to try - ask them (or the teacher) to break it down and give it a shot. Don't be afraid of not getting a move right away.  Sometimes they take time.  Sometimes they come immediately.  It's different for each move and each person.  The only way to fail is to not even try. Don't be afraid to try things (different types of styles/classes/etc) you don't know what you'll love until you've done it. Working on flexibility is never bad. Take lots of pictures and videos.  It seems silly at the beginning, but it's amazing to have them to look back at how much you've progressed.  They can also be used to encourage newbies that are nervous/scared/doubting themselves.

Almost 3 years ago, I was suffering from a major muscle imbalance.  I had been working with weights pretty consistently since I was 20.  In 2012, I slacked off because of my involvement with the pole.  I started to do exercises to balance myself out.  I had to focus, but it was worth it.  My advice: Cross train.  Other athletes do it, we should too.  Trust me.  Also, if you're not flexy naturally, work on it.  It makes a lot of tricks so much easier & makes them look more awesome & pretty.

I took a couple classes and quit for other reasons (there were 5 poles and 15 people in the class, you could hardly get anything done during the lessons). So I ordered my own pole and started poling every other day. I've been doing it like this for a year and a half and I love it more than I ever did when taking classes.  Some tips:   Set attainable goals. Someone mentioned the PDC syllabus in another thread recently, which is fantastic. Or you could use Pole Dance Dictionary. Be safe. Not having a spotter is a disadvantage. So if you're trying out moves you're unsure about, put down a few pillows/blankets. Or invest in a crash mat.  Film your poling sessions and review afterwards. There's always things you miss when you're practicing. I also take notes about this (e.g. look towards the ground in bow and arrow, straighten your right leg more, stuff like that).   And in the words of Jake the Dog: ""Sucking is the first step to being sorta good at something."" Keep going and you'll be great!"

I write down combinations and tricks I want to work on, broken down into categories of things I have down 100%, ones I have down okay but could use work, and ones I could only hope to one day achieve. That way I always have something to work towards, something to perfect, and something to do that makes me feel accomplished on a fail day :P  Last year on my birthday I started a year-long list of goal of moves I'd like to work towards, kind of a progression, each with a ""due date"". Moves I knew would take me longer to get were scheduled for later in the year. I didn't beat myself up too much if I didn't get a move by the ""due date"" but having a set timeline helped push me a little further on my goals. (I was 48 days past ""due"" with the spatchcock, but hey, it eventually happened! It never would have if I didn't keep at it.) I also liberally rearranged my timeline once I realized whether or not it was realistic... like when I realized I was definitely not going to get a phoenix before I got a deadlift handspring, which was not going to happen before a consistent Iron-X.    Had to put it all on hiatus though, when I got knocked up :( Still have 9/12 goals to get through!"

I packed all the pieces bubble wrapped separately in its original bag secured by the straps to the best of my ability. You better off keeping the original tubes instead of the bubble wrapping. I secured the bag with tape all around and just checked it in as oversized baggage. I had no problem on departure (though it was check by TSA or whatever security group in the airport, they left me a note that my pole was inspected). On arrival I was stopped and delayed because they thought I was flying a weapon or something. Pole arrived safe and whole without a single scratch.

Although it would be very expensive, your best bet would probably be to check it, just because it will be heavy. It mostly depends on the airline. Check with the airline you're using on what their size and weight restrictions are. The only way I can imagine you bringing it in a carry-on is if you can fit it in a duffle bag. I've seen people use those on domestic flights within the US, although international flights may be a different issue, so again, check with your airline."

poledancing,2ui6nt,roserolling,5,Mon Feb 2 10:28:12 2015 UTC,"That layback move is known as a Cross Ankle Release, and to me it seems maybe a bit irresponsible to teach that move to someone who has only been pole dancing for three weeks the first time they climb the pole. I only learned that one after about 10/11 months of poling (and after several exercises to prepare for it), and I just now learned the bow and arrow after a year. The Cross Knee Release is indeed easier and safer and I learned that one after about 3 months.   I know there's a lot of differences in teaching styles and speeds, but make sure you are safe. I would advise you not to do stuff that you are not comfortable with and make sure you have the coach there to spot you at all times, you can hurt yourself badly if you fall out of a CAR.  Anyway the trick for the CAR is not just to squeeze the pole with your thighs, but to really rotate your legs and knees in towards each other, that way you create a sort of lock."
poledancing,2ui6nt,grimmaul,3,Mon Feb 2 14:48:52 2015 UTC,"raises hand  Fell out of a CAR when I'd been poling for 4 months, during a class where we were being taught a bow 'n arrow. My instructor spotted me the first time and I seemed to have it okay, and then when I tried it again alone... Landed on my head in a weird flopping motion and tweaked the FUCK out of my back. Felt a twinge in my back for weeks afterwards, was afraid to get back on the pole for months. It's been almost 4 years and I'm still a little wary about that CAR! I got lucky I think - there was a woman in England that ended up paralyzed because of a bad fall from a CAR.  Fortunately, just about ANYTHING you do from a CAR can usually also be done from a CKR, so I don't consider it a completely ""essential"" move.  EDITED TO ADD: I don't know where in China you're taking your pole lessons, but I have family in Shanghai, and I stopped by a studio there. I don't think all pole studios are equal, but jesus, it was a hot mess at that particular one. Really no regard for safe teaching practices compared to the studios I've been to in the US...  I'm not saying to quit that studio and stop poling, but don't feel pressured to move at a faster pace than you feel comfortable with. I was scared out of my mind of most moves when I was a beginning poler and I deliberately repeated classes and took the ""easier"" track at my pole studio, and I think it helped me build a stronger foundation... I'm just as advanced of a poler as anyone else that I trained with now, and I would argue more fearless than most others because I learned how to safely bail the fuck out of moves :P"

You wouldn't believe the accidents that happen here... I'm sure this studio's safety is a fraction of a US studio's.

poledancing,2ueoem,MyMuddyEyes,3,Sun Feb 1 14:09:39 2015 UTC,"Start with the starters. You probably can't do anything the bad side, but you also couldn't anything on you good side when you started pole. So just the easiest spins, climbing with the other side, starting to invert on the other side, and so on.  An year into my poling I did nothing on my bad side, and when I started trying to train it, I could do literally nothing. I trained the very basics on it, and got to the point that I can equally well perform static spins on both sides, as well as Gemini and Scorpio and some others. It's still a struggle for more advanced moves, but if you make a point of equaling the time you spend on your good and bad side, slowly and surely it will pay off in your training and muscles."
poledancing,2ueoem,ClockworkMagpie,3,Sun Feb 1 18:55:32 2015 UTC,I've started taking beginning classes again but doing them entirely on my bad side. I also make it a point to do a few pole pull-ups on my non-dominant side.
poledancing,2ueoem,angelagabbie,2,Mon Feb 2 18:27:47 2015 UTC,"I have practice sessions specifically for training my weaker arm. I make it a goal to spin the other way/practice moves on the bad side for the whole session.  Even when I practice normally, I always end my practices by forcing myself to do a couple of moves a set number of times on my bad side. For example if I know I did a trick on my good side about 5 times that practice session I'll force myself to do it on my bad side for 8 times (or more, depending on how I feel) because I know my bad side needs more training.   What I found best for grip was doing one armed swoops. You can easily adjust how low & how wide you swoop depending on how strong your arm is."
poledancing,2ucjlm,sirynfollyfallen,2,Sat Jan 31 22:31:33 2015 UTC,Spatchcock is more to do with flexibility in the straddle position than splits (either front or middle).  Give it a try! :)
poledancing,2ucjlm,ari_reyne,2,Sat Jan 31 22:44:37 2015 UTC,"Short answer: NO.  Long answer: eeeeeeehhhh... you better be REALLY close to your middle split. If I'm middle splitting against the wall, my crotch is about about 2-3"" from touching the wall. You better be able to pancake like you're made of flour, baking soda, and eggs. Ideally if you can get your legs past the level of your body with blocks, even better. In a spatchcock, your ankles are behind the rest of your body. It allegedly took Felix Cane two years practicing with a broomstick to get this trick...  I made this video about two months before I successfully spatchcocked. I was CLOSE with my spatchcock then, but it's really really hard to get that bottom leg hooked if your legs don't bend that way. I definitely spent a couple months with my bottom leg flailing around, failing to make contact with the pole. It's still not consistent - definitely not a move I can get into with ease."

poledancing,2ucjlm,emm21tm,3,Mon Feb 2 02:22:12 2015 UTC,I would not try it until you have an oversplit in the middle. Put a yoga block under each foot and try to get your belly on the ground. Thats the position you need to be in for spatchcock. Until you can do this comfortably don't try it on the pole. I've known so many people who have torn their hamstring trying to shove themselves in this move. Even harder about this is you have to have passive flexibility not just active flexibility to place that bottom foot behind the pole.  Just be careful and keep stretching. There's so many other awesome tricks to try in the meantime!

poledancing,2u87o0,meowjanjan,3,Fri Jan 30 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"I've never had much fear of inverting, though CAR is probably the scariest thing for me because I can never tell if I'm stable until I'm down in it.  What I like do do is lean back while still holding on with one hand on top, grab the pole below with the other hand, let go on top and make sure I feel secure that way before letting go completely.  I've gotten more comfortable the more times I've done it.  Try using that bottom hand if you haven't already.  Work on your cross knee release if you haven't yet, that feels way more secure (at least it does for me).  Hold the ankle for the CKR if you're feeling scared.  More exposure to the world of lying back upside down will decrease the fear eventually. :)"
poledancing,2u87o0,girl-replica,3,Fri Jan 30 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"Inverts and being upside-down can be really scary, but you just need to learn to trust your grip. Make sure that your core is engaged and squeeze hard with all of your points of contact. Squeeze really hard with everything you've got and don't let go until you feel secure. Being secure is what you're learning rather than overcoming the fear. Have a spotter help you and just try inching back bit by bit. If you feel uncomfortable, come back to the pole. Everyone has off days but you get used to it the more you do it."
poledancing,2u87o0,MyMuddyEyes,3,Fri Jan 30 20:42:08 2015 UTC,"I totally get your mental block, took me a while to get over it. I actually used the aerial silks a lot to help out, because there are a lot of beginner moves in which you go upside down securely.  It also helps to practice head stands and hand stands... Especially if you learn how to sit out of a pole headstand. You eventually get used to it and your perception of being upside down kind of... Shifts? I dunno. Just practice, each time you act against your mental block, the weaker it becomes."

I always had my teacher or someone else there to spot me until I felt safe doing it by myself. It's all a matter of getting the right grip and technique and it will become a natural thing over time. I love all the upside down stuff now and have no more fear, except maybe a little when learning something that's all new.  I agree with the other commenter that the cross knee release is easier and feels much more secure than the cross ankle release, so maybe it's a good idea to start with that one and don't start working on the CAR until you feel very comfortable in the CKR."

poledancing,2tsois,madame_au,19,Tue Jan 27 02:40:51 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Based on the way you were describing the invert I think that you are trying to use momentum to get upside down. A basic invert should be down with control. Make sure that you have the strength for it by doing this exercise: Stand next to the pole, hips in front of the pole, inside arm gripping the pole in the bicep, both hands pulled down next to your face, elbows bent and shoulders down. Hold this position as you lift your legs off the ground. Try to do multiple crunches in this position without needing to put the feet back on the floor. If you can do this then you can try to invert.   Begin in this same position for the basic invert. When you lift your legs in a strong crunch, straighten out your arms allowing your head and shoulders to come down as the hips go up. Hook the pole with the outside leg. To come down put your chin to your chest and slide down to the floor. Try to avoid swinging, stepping into, or kicking into the invert. Also do not come out of the invert by letting the legs flop back down to the floor. If you come down by bringing the legs down, do so with slow control.   Injuries really do happen when an invert isn't done in a controlled manner. I know of bruised and even cracked ribs, pulled back muscles, even cartilage tears between the ribs. I don't mean to scare you or discourage you, I just want you to be safe! :)   Happy Poling!"
poledancing,2tsois,Reyalla508,3,Tue Jan 27 05:55:37 2015 UTC,"this, this and more this! You should use strength to invert not momentum. You are less likely to get hurt this way! It will take longer to get it this way, but not as long as correcting bad form, with practice you can totally develop the strength to do it!  2 other drills that may help you out is doing pull ups on the pole (grip the pole like you were going to invert, grip even harder, then try to lift your body off the ground). This will make it easier to get your booty above your hands when you are hooking your legs to invert.   Fan legs, same grip as before, and if you can't pull your body up, just squeeze your abs really tight to lift one leg at a time across your body like a fan or helicopter, trying to keep your legs as straight as possible.  I guess a third drill would be a progression of the tuck lifts. When you can do these on both side a few times without letting your feet touch the ground you can try to straddle your legs up and then pike your legs up in the same fashion. Holy burning abs batman is that a killer.  Happy poling, and always have a sexy spot!"

poledancing,2tsois,msstyps,6,Wed Jan 28 06:04:45 2015 UTC,"Hi! I would strongly recommend going to a class. If you're a bit shy or selfconsious then maybe a private lesson with an instructor. If you are unsure of how to do the basics, you could potentially hurt your ribs (been there, done that and it's PAINFUL!). Even with one lesson, you may still struggle (at first) but at least your instructor will be able to show you the right way so you don't hurt yourself. Pole is tricky and will take time to perfect anything you do. Just keep trying. Don't give up or beat yourself up over not being able to do something straight away. What i learnt when inverting, breathe! Don't hold your breath. Try relax. And aim to look up at a spot on the ceiling. Works for me anyways. =) Keep me posted on your progress! Good luck!"
poledancing,2tsois,hangonavocado,3,Tue Jan 27 04:03:50 2015 UTC,Just want to say THANK YOU everyone for the excellent tips!!! I am working on invert too at my studio :-D We will get there!
poledancing,2tsois,angelagabbie,2,Wed Jan 28 01:32:11 2015 UTC,do you have someone to spot you? I would imagine it would take much longer to get comfortable (and be potentially dangerous) without having a spotter. Just a thought! I inverted for the first time with a class last week - it wasn't particularly easy for any of us. It made a world of difference having an instructor put our legs into the proper position before letting us hold our own.
poledancing,2tsois,feygiraffe,2,Tue Jan 27 03:08:15 2015 UTC,I'll ask my boyfriend if he could help out. It is pretty scary!! How long did it take you to get upside down? I've been working at it all night and am starting to get discouraged.
poledancing,2tsois,SableMinotaur,5,Tue Jan 27 03:10:07 2015 UTC,"ALL NIGHT? Girl, it takes people several classes, weeks, months to do a proper invert. Pole is a beautiful sport, but it can't be rushed.  Since you're self-taught, my suggestion would be to look up youtube channels for pole. Dirdy Birdy is great and has beg to adv tutorials, even one on inverting :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrQ0RaBNxc8"
poledancing,2tsois,APacman,3,Tue Jan 27 19:13:24 2015 UTC,My pole instructor has told us over and over that it could take a good 3 months or more of proper training to get into an invert correctly.  If you are using momentum to get yourself inverted you are doing it wrong.  Take the advise from the people here about how to do it right and you will be able to do it eventually without hurting yourself.  Keep working on the moves to build up arm and ab strength and then revisit inverting.  Don't take away your ability to do the sport by hurting yourself with bad form!  Good luck and have fun!
poledancing,2tsois,Eionyx,2,Tue Jan 27 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"you should ask your boyfriend to support you while you correctly position your legs and grip. we were not allowed to go upside down by ourselves that class yet so we all got up pretty fast with instructor support, but that's nowhere near as difficult as what I imagine you must be trying to do on your own! you need to get a feel for where your legs need to be before you start needing to place them with a time limit.

When possible, try to make sure you're keeping your wrist straight so that force can be applied down the length of it rather than at an angle, if that makes any sense.  As as recovery and prevention, it may be worth doing regular exercises to strengthen the wrists, and keep them mobile.  Regular wrist stretches can be useful.  You could take a look at these:  These 'novel movements' for the hands, wrists, elbows: www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hlWgH3_0NU  This wrist routine which has some stretching and strengthening elements: www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmMfW2kCkeE  Seeking out other ways that people strengthen their wrists (e.g. for handstands) may be useful.

poledancing,2tmf8o,MyPigWaddles,3,Fri Jan 30 01:31:09 2015 UTC,"You don't suck.  As adults, we forget how hard it is to learn new physical stuff, especially if we don't regularly learn new physical skills.  Remember learning to ride a bike? Someone can explain that you ride the bike by leaning slightly from side to side to maintain your balance, and can tell you that going forward faster makes the balance easier.  And your brain can understand that idea much sooner than you can actually do it.  You have to develop the muscle memory and intuition slowly over time.  Same thing with dancing and other new physical activities. It just takes time and repetition for your body to feel the motions and execute the thing your brain already understands.  You'll get stronger, and it'll get easier.  It can be quicker for some people because they have already trained their body to do similar motions before in other activities - you're just not seeing all the practice and struggle they put into that other sport when you're side by side in your pole class.  I've been taking classes for months and am just sort of starting to be able to climb. And am just now starting to have a gut feeling for the balance and momentum in the basic spins (But the one handed stuff? Still disastrously worse than my classmates but it'll happen eventually. I learn this stuff slowly, and I know that, but I know it'll eventually happen if I repeat the motions for 10-15 minutes a day until it ""clicks."")"

poledancing,2tmf8o,batnip,3,Thu Jan 29 15:10:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, you suck. Do you know why? Because you're a beginner. We pretty much all sucked at the beginning, and in some ways we all still suck at various parts of like dancing. There are a lot of aspects to consider. Sure, some of us came into it stronger than most, or more graceful, or flexible, but we all had to learn it from the beginning.  Notice what you suck at and what specific things you need to work on improving- but you need to also acknowledge what you have accomplished. Every one of us has a different body. We are going to find different moves more or less challenging. There is no standard of what you ""should"" be able to do at any level. Listen to your body and go at your own pace.

One of the best things about pole in my opinion is that there are SO many moves and so many types of moves that you can't really put a level number on most of them. You'll never be truly stuck or completely bored. There will be basic things you are never really comfortable with, and more advanced things that you're ready for before others at your level. You pole journey is your own. Don't compare it to anyone else's, just try to improve on where you were the week before. :)"

poledancing,2tmf8o,hangonavocado,2,Thu Jan 29 15:23:57 2015 UTC,"Everybody starts at a different place and has a different journey to get to the same location. It's very hard in the beginning not to look around and feel intimidated by other dancers being stronger, more flexible, more graceful, sexier, thinner, whatever.  At least for me though, I've found the longer I stick with pole, the more that thought process has changed for the better and I've stopped doing it.  I'm grateful that I have because that thinking isn't good for my self esteem. It can be hard to make yourself remember that everybody comes into pole with a different background and starting abilities.  Also, something to remember about pole is that different moves will come easier or harder for to different people.  Even the best dancers have moves that they struggled with or took them a long time to learn. It's also important to remember that you get better at pole by doing more pole.  Every attempt or rep you do is another step toward mastery. I've been poling for around a year and a half, and have started going to one level 1 class per week.  I remember when I was a newbie, and I watch them while participating in the class.  Some of these women get things right away others take some time, and others have been struggling with the same move for a month now.  But they're all coming back and trying.  I help with tips and pointers when I can. Perhaps try thinking about something else you've started from zero with in your life.  How it took time to learn specifics and ins and outs.  Does the food come out perfect every time you cook or bake?  What about when you were young and first learning the basics?  Pole is a skill, like so many other things in your life and will at times take some patience and a bit of persistence to learn.    As another bit of info I'm around your height and weighed 120 pounds more than you when I started pole.  I'm working to get down to your weight currently.  I struggled for a long time.  I was always behind the other girls but I kept going.  I kept working.  And things tarted to click.  There are some moves from a year ago that I still can't do.  But I can do lots of things that are harder. For the grip, if you are using dry hands over and over it (or any grip aid for that matter) it leaves some on the pole.  You may need to clean the pole now and again throughout class.    tl;dr - you get good at pole by doing pole.  repetitions and determination are what it takes for success.  try not to compare yourself to others, we all have different roads to travel.  you've got this."

I guess I don’t follow Lady Gaga as closely as I should because she has SOME story to tell.  Did you know that the singer comes from a super wealthy family, went to the same Catholic girl’s school as Paris Hilton, and… was a STRIPPER?  Lady Gaga was most certainly a rebel!   On being a stripper and loving the human form:  “I have a strong sense of my own sexuality. I love the naked human body and I have huge body confidence.  “I was working in strip clubs when I was 18. Girls from my background weren’t meant to turn into someone like me. I come from a wealthy Italian family, went to a good school. You’re meant to live with Mom and Dad until they die. I went against all I was brought up to be; I moved out of home, wouldn’t take any help from my parents and supported myself with waitressing jobs and stripping.  “My act was pretty wild. I’d wear black leather and dance to Black Sabbath, Guns N’ Roses and Faith No More. Very rock ‘n’ roll.”   ... Sounds like a traditional stripper to me! Not that she couldn't have done both; I have friends who do. But from what I've heard, you do burlesque for the love of performing, and you strip for the money so you can afford to keep doing burlesque."

I couldn't walk properly for weeks and couldn't do real exercise for longer (I tried a rowing machine about 6 weeks in and my whole back froze up. People had to basically carry me away.) I'm still in pain sometimes when I lie down badly or stay on my feet for too long, and my back flexibility is abysmal. I'm using pole to try and build strength there again but I have to go insanely slowly.  Please, please, don't let anyone be mean to your back. It sucks so much when it's injured."

I love to be physically pushed when stretching but its a process. Your partner pushes slowly while your breathing deeply and only on the exhale should you push. And all with communication. Yes it can be uncomfortable but not painful.   You might need to pull them aside and just ask them not to do this to you. Make up an excuse about an old injury if you have to. I don't think this is safe."
poledancing,2tj9li,ilikedessert,3,Sat Jan 24 20:51:44 2015 UTC,"Not normal for pole classes, but it's a different culture obviously. I've had Russian ballet teachers yank my legs around and my godmother got in a lot of trouble when she pulled an american girl's leg up and it tore a tendon. It's not safe, especially if you're not very warmed up and if they're pushing you beyond normal stretching discomfort and into injury territory. This is particularly dangerous for back bends because you run the risk of compressing a disk if you're not engaged in your core and lengthened out. If it gets passed the point of an ""assisted stretch"" and to the point where you feel you're going to get hurt don't let them do it. It's your body and you need to take care of it regardless of if it's the status quo there."

I was never injured from it (I worked with her for one season and I was maybe 11-12 at the time) and it did improve my flexibility. Granted, I was much younger, and every body is different.  Still, I would request to not be stretched in this way. I'm guessing you're comfortable in Chinese, so if you'd like an assist (I do personally find gentle pressure helpful), maybe that's something you can communicate."

I teach pole now and I realize that a lot of the self taught girls that come in have to clean up their tricks and style. I would also look at Pole Dance Dictionary and Dirdy Birdy (who is self taught but awesome). Just make sure that you look at videos from people who generally know what they are doing or have been at it for a while, there's a lot of filtering to do on youtube."

I think most pole-rs don't love liquid chalk (or dust) because it'll get on your clothes etc. Dry hands is more for people who tend to be sweaty on poles, which causes us to slide. If your hoop is taped, I'm not sure if it's the same kind of issue."

poledancing,2t6pnn,FancyPhilanges,2,Wed Jan 21 17:54:57 2015 UTC,"typically it's just general grip for holds. Not so much that you are sweaty and slide, but that the skin on the hands is generally pretty smooth on its own. You want a grip aid to essentially fake the texture of calluses until you build them. You need added texture to the hand (or knee, or elbow) to aid in your hold. I second Firm Grip! It's great for both. However, if you like a lot of spin on static pole, Firm Grip can be a bit too much."
poledancing,2t6pnn,mai_z,1 point,Wed Jan 21 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"Try Mighty grip? It's more of a grip-aid than a sweat inhibitor. that's probably the other 'pole grip' for the masses, and seems like it's closer to what you're looking for."

So it's not like pole where you just slide down to the floor if you can't grip.  eg. this position, if I don't have grip my top fingers just start letting go, put a bit of grip on and I can sit there for ages."

I've had an excellent experience with my x-pole and would recommend it, though I've never played on a standalone so I can't compare it to that.  Be wary of really cheap poles.

Also, very easy to put up AND take down (I'm 5'1 and can do it all by myself, ~30min set up). All you need is a level (which all iPhones have) and figure out where there's a support beam in your ceiling.  The standalone pole (X-Stage) does sway and is also MUCH more expensive and heavier than floor-to-ceiling poles, though it is nice bc you can bring out with you, like the beach or park!"

Keep in mind that this off brand one doesn't come with a bag and it's also not bottom loading. I had 8"" popcorn ceilings in my old place and it wasn't a hassle necessarily, but you do need a ladder or step stool or something. You would need one anyway to find the joists in your ceiling. Other than that I really can't tell the deference between mine and the official XPole ones my studio has.

During a one to one you could try a load of new moves with them there to make sure you get the idea, then practice them at the all level classes.

I look online to see particular moves in my level that I haven't learnt and then show it to my instructor to ask her to teach me. Luckily some of the beginners are now at my level so we're progressing together.
poledancing,2sk44p,kemirea,13,Thu Jan 15 21:33:05 2015 UTC,"I think this would be great. And really handy to be able to have it so portable, so you could take it with you to classes.  It would also be cool if it had a function where you could check off each move once you can do it so you can track your progress. And a 'similar moves' thing like Pole Dance Dictionary to help you to figure out what to learn next.  Would it only be images, though? Having videos of spins would be helpful for the user but would obviously require much more memory than just images.  I think there are a few similar things out there already, such as this but I'm not sure that there's anything out there which is particularly extensive, though I haven't really looked into it much."
poledancing,2sk44p,MyMuddyEyes,6,Thu Jan 15 21:43:38 2015 UTC,"The images/videos would be cloud-based, so wouldn't require so much memory on the device. I personally find videos to be a lot more helpful in learning a move, so I'd like to have a mix of both. Possibly a video of the whole movement, and then a still image of what the move should look like at the ""final"" point.  A bit of technical rambling, but I was thinking of also caching the assets of the most recently viewed moves so that if you're in an area with poor/no network connectivity, you'd still be able to see the pages for the most recent moves."

For the source images, getting in touch with them is definitely worth a shot, never know they might want to fund you.  Also how about the spin city pole bible? Or you could contact pole professionals that post their pics on facebook/instagram and ask for their permission to use those?

I'm a much less avid mobile user than most, though, so I there might be lots of interest that I just don't share.  Teaming up with PDD would make sourcing videos much easier, and adding a community aspect with comments and tips naturally indexed by move would be so useful.  Overall my personal opinion is that I really like that additional community aspect to a move database, but I'm meh on it being a mobile app.  I wouldn't see myself posting much text from my phone, though it would integrate nicely with photos and videos taken with the device.  Mobile does have that advantage.  Regardless of what my or anyone else's interest is, though, if you're passionate about this project, DO IT!

Can't hurt to ask them, just don't hand over your work without some kind of contract you've understood fully and agree with.  Sorry I don't have more advice for you.  Another thought might be, if you go the social-networky route, not to provide any native pictures/videos of moves, but let users submit them?  As your user base grew, so would the content depth.  A few people could populate the basics pretty quickly if they wanted to be the first face of a bunch of moves.  Probably just need to be careful to write a good ToS for whatever you're going to do with that content (ie, do you keep it up if the person closes their account, etc).  Good luck!"

I don't know whether many others would agree with me here but I quite dislike when apps/websites with pole videos have a whole bunch of different people performing the moves. I prefer (like with pocketpolelite) how they have the same few polers. Just as the examples of the moves but have like a separate section where you can view uploaded ones?

I had some trouble navigating the website, but I was thinking of something similar to that but with more ways for users to interact with each other, i.e. rather than emailing them for tips with a nemesis trick, you ask the community. It looks to me like they're updating their app relatively quickly (around once every couple of months is what they say), but since I don't know if that includes adding new moves. I'd definitely want there to be some way for users to submit new moves, which would have to be approved before being added to the database. But this becomes a problem later on if there are too many users and submissions come in faster than can be approved.  One other change is that I'd like to make the app completely free if at all possible.

Maybe what I figured out about the move will help... the leg that you hook is on the same side of your body as the arm that you keep low in ayesha. When you first release into brass monkey you will have to switch your arms (the normally high one is the one that has to be low) and you'll need to twist the wrist of the lower arm (basically if you bring that arm down and it feels ""right"" - like it's actually able to bear your weight while in brass monkey - you need to flip it at the wrist so that it feels totally wrong - once you transition to ayesha it'll feel right again!)."

Brass is extremely sticky, so I can understand your troubles if that's what you were used to. Playing around with different grip aids might help you. I use a combination of Tite Grip and Dry Hands with chrome poles. Mighty Grip isn't as useful in my experience but everyone's different. For body grip I used a layer of Dew Point Ultra (in the winter). It really helps get the skin to have that base stickiness that makes you feel secure. Then I put iTac on specific areas like knee pits and such. Other than that you may have to squeeze harder than you're used to. It'll be good for you, strength wise! ;) at this point I prefer a nice warm stainless or chrome pole over brass. I like the maneuverability I have on chrome where I would be too sticky to do that on brass. With practice you will get used to it! :)"

Are you using lotion or a moisturizing shave cream? If so, stop that. It makes you and the pole slippery.  Watch some tutorials or go to a class and really pay attention to where their body is in relation to the pole, and how their back leg holds the pole.

Do not listen to anyone telling you not to use lotion...you should absolutely be putting lotion on in the winter time as soon as you get out of the shower hours and hours with PLENTY of time before you dance and exercise. If your skin is too dry you will absolutely not stick to the pole. With that being said, you also should NOT put lotion on 4 hours or less than when you pole. There is a very fine line between being too greasy to pole and too dry to pole. When you are in a cold and dry weather climate you have to take care of your skin. I speak from experience. I slipped all last winter with no idea what I was doing wrong until I bought mighty grip cold climate formula and actually started to put lotion on. My lack of lotion was doing me less favors.

poledancing,2s1b9y,rainamew,6,Sun Jan 11 05:26:39 2015 UTC,"It looks almost like your hands are getting trapped by your legs, which probably means you need to bring your hips up more when you invert and before you actually place your legs on the pole. Are you able to get into and hold a chopper? In that position, your crotch should be as close as possible to the pole. That way, when you do bring your legs up and wrap them around the pole, very little if any of your hands should be under your legs."
poledancing,2s1b9y,kemirea,6,Sun Jan 11 08:18:38 2015 UTC,"I think you just really need to grip with your legs, lock them in as tight as you can. It is much easier with a spotter too because then they can show that you are actually holding yourself rather than freaking about dropping on your head.  Also the crucifix(?) Pose can be a good start to letting go, once you are comfortable and confident. Once your legs are up and locked, bring your body round so you are in a straight line and the pole is between your boobs, then straighten your arms to the side :)"

poledancing,2s1b9y,Fridky,4,Sun Jan 11 06:02:01 2015 UTC,"I did this too! Try inverting with your hands lower and not so spread apart. If you're doing what I was doing, You're trapping your hands between your legs, and if you try harder to grip with your legs, you're just going to lock your hands onto the pole even more.   So, hands closer together, closer to your shoulder/head. I put my bottom hand next to my neck, and my top hand never goes above my head on the pole before I invert. It might take more ab strength to get up there but it'll look cleaner and you won't get stuck!"
poledancing,2s1b9y,WampaCat,6,Sun Jan 11 08:33:08 2015 UTC,"Your hands are waaaay too far apart.  They should be right next to each other, at the same height as your shoulders, or a little higher.  So once you correct that, you'll solve the problem of your hand getting caught between your thighs when you grip.  Then - you need to squeeze your legs harder than you've ever squeezed before!  When I first learned this move, my instructor said imagine you really really really have to go to the toilet, and you've been holding on for hours - that kind of squeeze!  Don't let go with your hands until you're 150% sure that your leg grip is solid.  I suggest sliding down a bit so that you're not too far off the ground, then take one hand off and put it on the ground while you're turning your body to face the pole.  Then, when you're ready, take the other hand off, and slide your legs down.  Hope that all makes sense - let me know if you want a video.  Good luck!!"
poledancing,2s1b9y,ari_reyne,5,Sun Jan 11 09:48:50 2015 UTC,"Your problem is your hand positioning, you need to start with your hands at head level at most, your right hand is so far up it's getting in your way.  Since your hands are too high they then get in the way of your thighs when you are inverted.  They need to squeeze the pole, just like crucifix position the other way up.  So get your thighs glued to the pole instead of your hands :)"
poledancing,2s1b9y,APacman,2,Sun Jan 11 16:22:41 2015 UTC,"Your hand position should be more like lower hand next to you chest and top hand in front of your face. You'll find that this way, you hand will be closer to you pelvis as opposed to between your legs."
poledancing,2s1b9y,snadypeepers,2,Sun Jan 11 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"your hands are glued! In between your legs. If you find them getting stuck between the thighs (in this example) you're not bringing your hips up enough (although your hands are also very far apart, making it even more challenging). Try starting with your hands lower on the pole (at my studio, we do one across the chest, one at face height) and instead of hooking your foot alone, make sure to be pulling your hips up towards the ceiling. If you need to hook your foot, you should also be pulling your hips up (and your feet up) to exposure your grip from between your thighs."

I'd especially recommend doing (I think its called) chopper, where you leave your hands where they are and bring your legs right up and over.  From there I'd do (again I could be wrong on names) falling star - from chopper, bring your legs back onto the pole and grip on, while gripping with one hand and legs bring one hand off the pole and regrip over your head (closer to floor) and bring your legs back out.  Those two moves (and the small difference between them) helped me to learn different gripping positions when I didn't have much confidence in my leg grips. Hope this helps :)"

As everybody else said. Once youve got that hand position changed youll be well away!  As for taking your hands off, the best thing to do is get a spotter. They dont have to know anything about pole, just anyone nearby. The best thing for them to do is stand behind you and put their hands on the side of your thighs or knees and help you squeeze. That way. If you start sliding they can grab you round the waist to stop you falling and hurting yourself. That way, you know youre safe and will not be too scared to let go! If you do slide, tuck your chin to your chest and ever so gracefully slide to the floor.   Inverting alone when youre inexperienced is scary and can be dangerous, be safe and good luck!"
poledancing,2s1b9y,SBibskii,1 point,Sun Jan 11 21:51:14 2015 UTC,"Others have mentioned some of these but here are my tips:  Don't try to hook your outside leg so soon. It's half kicking up and won't help you build strength. Instead, focus on getting your chopper/inverted v DOWN PAT before even getting your hips up and placing your calves on the pole. Setting aside some time to do pole crunches on both sides every time you pole will help you.  Expose your midriff! Use your back skin to help you grip and invert. Works wonders.  Lower your hands to eye level/top of head level. They are way too high and it's way harder to straighten your back and get your hips to clear your hands."

I don't think the child is old enough to really comprehend that pole dancing can be used in intimate situations. Besides that, the mom's moves weren't overtly sexual. The only thing that I thought was a little irresponsible was spinning around the child. The little girl could get injured if the mom bumps into her by accident.   Really, this bit in the article enraged me the most:    People think of pole dancing and immediately think of well-oiled naked bodies dancing on a pole with money being thrown at them.   I work in a club and any girl that is stupid enough to use oil gets verbal death threats and sometimes actual ass-beatings from the other dancers. Just thinking about a hypothetical girl oiling up before stage makes me furious. Fuck that nonsense!"
poledancing,2ryz0v,booger_nose,4,Sat Jan 10 23:44:54 2015 UTC,"this was gorgeous. I don't agree with those of you that are saying the body waves or ""stripper pushups"" are inappropriate for children. in her own words this is a display of:  ""shared display of divine femininity, sensual acceptance, power and open, unapologetic love for self and for my child""  I think we forget that a lot of the ""sexy movements"" in pole exist in and originate from other dance forms. If these were done in the context of modern or jazz, no one would be saying that she shouldn't be doing that around her child. her child has no context for pole anyway, it's the same as any other kind of dance.   Furthermore, I don't think that moving in a way that could possibly be construed as sexual should be avoided or shamed. What I see is a mom comfortable in her body and femininity. I think the feminine aspect is what's freaking people out because it's powerful and entrancing to watch.   Shouldn't that be a good example for a little girl? That your body is yours to move and you can feel comfortable in it?   Maybe when she's older it might get weird if mom is doing body waves and heel clacks, but for now she's just watching mom move in a beautiful and honest way.   Bringing it back to pole, most of us are women, so just about any movement we do can be construed as sexual by someone, it comes with the body. We shouldn't contribute to censoring someone else's style because it's a little too sexy for us.   If you wanna do pure gymnastic/modern pole, more power to you, if you wanna bang the floor and crawl around, please do. The gymnastic side of pole informs the sensual side and the sensual side informs the acrobatic. We can't and shouldn't whitewash the fact that the sport was brought up by strippers and pushed forward by traditional dancers and gymnasts.   Without both sides we don't have a community where everyone can find a place. This conversation made me a little uncomfortable because I felt like we were censoring or judging someone (regardless if they have a kid, only thing that made me nervous was the spinning, but it looks like she has great control) which doesn't really have a place in a community that accepts everyone.  /rant"

It could be a very serious hazard to use an unsafe pole, I have read of people buying such a pole that have injured themselves when it suddenly fell down or even broke in half, so I just want to notify you of this. Please be careful."
poledancing,2rjijb,grimmaul,3,Tue Jan 6 21:10:36 2015 UTC,According to the reviews it is quite sturdy.
poledancing,2rjijb,grimmaul,7,Wed Jan 7 06:39:41 2015 UTC,"""Quite sturdy"" wouldn't cut it for me, I personally wouldn't trust my body weight with anything less than a completely reliable pole from an established brand.

Best advise I can give is get a really good grip on the top arm, rest your wrist on your bases bicep and reach you hand all the way around their arm! It's easier if the base holds onto a pole to start so they will stay steady and it will be easier for you to balance! Once you get the hang of that then you can make it so they're not holding anything.  I can send you a video of getting into the move if that would explain it better!"

I'm currently on the outs with my studio as they started charging me insane amounts of money without my permission. We're talking four months membership fees within a two week period, while I was injured and my membership was supposed to be on hold. So it then took four months for the issue to be resolved and they still only gave me back half the money I'm owed.  So I got a home pole and was practicing on there..  YouTube is your best friend. I keep in contact with regular polers who are at a higher level than me so any technique questions I ask them. Just be safe at home and don't try anything you know is beyond your level without having a spot and a crash mat. Also don't forget about conditioning. Learning tricks is fun but you'll never nail them until your strength and flexibility are at their best.  Some additional advice... don't let two drunken 250lb guys swing on your spinning pole at the same time. Mine is currently out of commission due to a huge hole in my wall and a crack in the ceiling.  So I'm feeling your pain. Practice is pretty much impossible for me at the moment and I feel like giving up on life. Haha Good luck at home. Be safe."

I've never used a pole instruction video, just watched demos, so that could turn out to be a really helpful resource over the next few weeks. Conditioning is actually the thing I'm worried the most about (I don't want to lose all the hard work from the last few months) so maintenance is way more important at the moment than learning new stuff.   Thanks for your help, I hope you get your pole back soon! Hang in there and be safe as well."

I was lucky enough to meet a pole dance instructor out of chance (my boyfriend's best friend's girlfriend) and she's been giving me private lessons since July.   Other than that, just focus on getting stronger and perfecting what you can already do. When you want to learn something new, there are plenty of YouTube tutorials out there, you just have to be careful when doing them without a spotter. Get a big mirror to check your form, maybe a crash mat, and you could definitely teach yourself for the time being :)  Edit: spelling is hard"

I'm not bendy by nature and have some damage from years of contact sports, so this is a slower one. I'd like to be able to walk down the wall, flat wall or stall bars.

poledancing,2r4fwt,angelagabbie,1 point,Wed Jan 7 18:38:22 2015 UTC,"I would recommend working your upper body and your core muscles, as these are both important in pole for lifting and controlling your whole body weight, which will likely be the bit that you're not used to.  Pull-ups/chin-ups will help, and anything like push-ups or even lifting dumbbells as a start for the upper body. And there are lots of core-related exercises that you can do to work on your abs area, though I personally don't find crunches to be very beneficial. Things like planks, flutter kicks, bicycle kicks, that sort of thing.  Even with being flexible, make sure to continue to stretch and work those joints, because you'll be putting a lot of body weight on them. In particular, I find that my hips and shoulders can give me real pain if I don't work them, and I'm also pretty flexible."

poledancing,2r4hqo,missmichellepole,3,Fri Jan 2 18:59:57 2015 UTC,"I know they can be expensive but I think you should either save up for a new one or if you are set on a second hand one, make sure it is the 2014 version (they've just released a new version with much better features). One feature I love is the xjoint (piece of expanding metal which holds the pole pieces together) has a new fixture to keep it in place. After a while they spin around in the pole so you can't put the allen key in and have the pole completely stuck together-which is extremely annoying if you have to keep taking it apart. The new 2014 poles have been adjusted so this doesn't happen anymore. Defo go for xpert one (static and spinning) as you will progress and want a spinning one, its worth the extra £50.  Also if you ask your pole school about it, they get a 20% discount from X-Pole and could do you a cheaper deal (I run one myself and give my students the full 20% discount instead of making a profit)."

poledancing,2r4hqo,PoemanBird,2,Sat Jan 3 06:02:46 2015 UTC,"If your studio or city has a poling facebook group (and you're on facebook) I'd recommend joining.  I know that occasionally people will post selling their pole for one reason or another. Alternately, if your studio will allow it, maybe put up a note saying you're in the market to buy a pole if anybody is selling?  Or at the very least just ask around at the studio, you never know. Outside of that, tuck money away with a goal of buying a new one.    Good luck!"
poledancing,2r4hqo,jamielicious,2,Fri Jan 2 20:02:47 2015 UTC,"I actually have an x-pole I am looking to sell. I would be interested in selling it and discussing with you, if you'd like. Not that it's the same, but I've sold TONS of makeup on r/makeupexchange and have excellent feedback. PM me if you want to discuss more."
poledancing,2r4hqo,knockknockneo,1 point,Fri Jan 2 22:09:39 2015 UTC,"As tempting as it is to save a bit of money by getting a used one, I would be wary of buying one second-hand, as you don't always know how well they've been looked after - especially if you want to get the X-Pert, which has more moving parts and mechanisms.  I take good care of my pole, but even I've messed up when putting it back up and screwed in screws without lining everything up properly (because it slipped my mind). From what I can tell, this has done some minor damage to the internal screw threading in the extender mechanism, which makes a section of it more difficult to screw/unscrew. This isn't something which would be visible when looking at it, unlike scratches, for example.  When I bought my pole, I waited until I had enough money to buy a new one directly from X-Pole so that I knew that it was both genuine and brand-new for my own peace of mind (and safety). That being said, a lot of people complain that the brand-new poles have a slippery coating which is difficult to work with, which may be a factor that could put you off getting a new one.  If you get one second-hand, make sure that you're really familiar with how the pole should be and what you should check for. If possible, it would be great if you could get the person selling it to you to give a demonstration of putting it up and taking it down just so you know that everything works okay.  Either way, just be sensible about buying it, as it's a lot of money to waste if it's no good - as well as potentially being unsafe. And make sure to check your ceilings BEFORE buying one. You don't want to find out AFTER you've bought it that you don't have solid ceilings, which happened to a friend of mine..."

If you look around, there's usually a 5-10% off coupon code floating around. I have both a 2010-2013 and 2014 X-pole from him.

poledancing,2r3wbg,TwoSparks,6,Fri Jan 2 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"First of all, congratulations on taking the first step and finding the inspiration, motivation, and bravery to try!    The first time I saw a video of Emma I'd been poling for a bit.  She's amazing.  I love watching her and find her inspirational.  When my brain decides to tell me stupid things, watching her reminds me that you don't have to be tiny to be strong, flexible, or graceful.  Pole is pretty and awesome at any size.    I've said a lot of this here many times but here's a bit about my background -  When I started in September 2013 I couldn't do a single sit up, I couldn't lift my weight off the ground. I still had a great time in class.  I hurt a LOT after, but that ache and pain is just your muscles growing. I was scared and nervous and for the first 3 levels of classes my teacher had to encourage me to sign up for the next set (I wanted to, but constantly doubted myself). I kept going to classes, and over time something changed.  Not only did I really look forward to class, I started going to extra practice time.  My muscles grew, and my confidence started to soar.  Now I can do tricks I wouldn't have dreamed of on that fateful day over a year ago. For me pole was also the first step toward motivation to lose weight.  A bit melted off just adding the pole class, but it took a diet change to make it really start coming off.  I've moved from morbidly obese to just regular obese with sights on normal weight.  Pole has been an essential part of that for me.    Things to remember - If you're sore after your first class, that's normal.  Your body isn't accustomed to the things you're going to ask of it.  Todays aches and pains are tomorrow's strength and muscles. - Try not to compare yourself to the other students or teacher's abilities we all have our own path to get to the end destination.  Everybody moves at their own speed.  Different things will come harder or easier to each person. - Try not to be self conscious - every pole dancer was a newbie when they started too.  If you put in the time and the effort, you too will be doing those amazing tricks some day. - If you feel overwhelmed or like a move is too hard, speak up.  Many moves have modifications so ask your teacher. - Trust your teacher.  They are trained and know their stuff.  They're also a lot stronger than they look, and know how to spot moves safely and properly. - Pretty comes with practice.  Don't be discouraged if things aren't as beautiful as you want when you learn them.  Every time you repeat the move you'll be working slowly toward it being prettier.  Eventually pointing toes and adding this flourish or that flourish will become natural and something you do subconsciously. - Don't worry about being uncoordinated.  Many people come to pole with no dance background at all.  Some of us come to pole as a lifelong klutz.  Coordination and grace will develop over time. - Take pictures!  If the studio allows it (even if it's the last class of the level/session) get pictures now and again.  It helps with perspective when you can look back and see how far you've progressed. - People aren't there to judge each other, everybody came to pole dance to get some fun exercise.  In fact, once you're a bit familiar with your classmates their successes can be just as exciting as your own.  A supportive studio is the best studio. - Most importantly - HAVE FUN with it.  That's what pole classes are for.  To get a bit of exercise and have fun.  Take it serious enough to be safe, but not so seriously that you get stressed and forget the fun.  I look forward to hearing how your first class went.  I hope you find a new hobby that you love.  But if not, that's ok too.  Not every activity is right for every person.    Sorry for babbling on so much.  I sometimes get a little too excited talking about pole and meander into polevangelizing a bit :)"
poledancing,2r3wbg,jamielicious,2,Fri Jan 2 19:54:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you so, so much for the encouragement and tips. It really means a lot coming from someone who started pole in a place quite similarly to myself. I am definitely obese according to BMI charts (though, I've never considered myself to be anything beyond overweight just from looking at myself) and definitely cannot do a sit up to save my life. Hearing how far you've come thanks to pole is incredibly inspiring!   Do you mind if I ask how much modification you made to your life in order to achieve your weight loss? I mean, yes you started pole and made a diet change, but was it really over the top restrictive, or just general better eating? And did you add anything else as far as physical activity aside from just the one pole class to achieve your weight loss (not counting when you eventually started going to practice class, too)? Because while I am definitely doing this for fun, I do hope for weight loss as a side effect."
poledancing,2r3wbg,jamielicious,2,Fri Jan 2 20:23:09 2015 UTC,"The only exercise I do is pole.  Class once a week, and practice when the sessions, my schedule, and my body will allow.      Back in July of this year my husband and I gave up all the bad carbs and are following a ketogenic type diet which essentially boils down to no sugar, flour, or starches.  Eating in a way that  keeps your blood sugar level as flat as possible.  I personally don't find this terribly restrictive because I can still eat so many yummy things that I love.  I also cheat around 1 time per month just for sanity.  But some people do find it harder than doing a caloric restriction because denying yourself bread/pasta/sugar can be incredibly hard.    Another tip, I bring a litre water bottle full of ice water to every class.  I find I get through most of it in a class.  Staying hydrated is always good, and having a sip is a good chance to take a second to catch your breath if you need it.    If you have more questions, don't be afraid to ask.  /r/poledancing is full of amazing people and I'm personally a pretty open book. I'm incredibly excited for you to try classes and begin your fitness journey!"
poledancing,2r3wbg,jamielicious,2,Fri Jan 2 20:39:35 2015 UTC,"Yay, that makes me feel better about only getting out to one class! And who knows, schedules could change and something might eventually fit into my schedule to do more. Either way, its just nice knowing that one session a week can actually make a difference.   Hmm, yeah, I have tried ketogenic diets in the past... Very difficult for me! There was a modified ketogenic diet that I was on for some time wherein I lost a lot of weight that allowed me very minimal servings of certain grain products, though, so I may modify to trying to do something similar to that.   Really?! A whole litre of water?! That seems like so much! Wow, I'll make a note!  Anwho, thanks again for answering my questions! I'm really excited, too! As a girl who has been big her whole life (with sporadic points of MAJOR weight loss as a result of diet that were not sustainable, and therefore caused a return in weight, throughout her life), I really hope this is something that could change the way I've viewed fitness. Look for me around this time next Saturday (January 10th), and I'll have an update on how my first class went! :P"

poledancing,2r3wbg,Melorix,4,Thu Jan 15 16:00:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry! Last few days have been crazy, and before that my arms weren't functional enough to type on a computer, haha.  Okay, so... A run down.  I was admittedly a bit disappointed to find that I was the biggest girl in the class. That definitely had me starting off feeling a little discouraged, but I kept hopeful because even as the biggest, I recognized that I wasn't surrounded solely by teeny tiny fit women.  The workout was hard, haha. I was super shaky half the time, and was quickly able to confirm that I have zero upper body strength. I was also, as I expected, super klutzy and struggled to keep up with choreography 100% of the time, but I did way better than I expected at keeping up.  Focused on floor work obviously, but we were introduced to the fireman and the pole hold. Fireman was literally the most terrifying thing ever for someone like me, haha, but I actually managed it a few times -- granted, my form was pretty poor, but it was my first class, so I'm not discouraged yet. Really struggled doing it with my non-dominant side leading, though... Pole hold was real bad, and I felt kind of shitty because I feel like I definitely got some giggles when I pathetically clunked to the floor. But I'm just super self-conscious like that; I could tell they weren't being malicious with their laughter as everyone was being silly and most (save for like, 2 people) were having a bit of trouble. Hopefully with time, I'll get it.  I felt super sore after, but I had so much fun that I went ahead and signed up for the remaining five weeks! I sucked, but I've never had a good time with physical activity so the fact that I enjoyed it and actually didn't want to stop at the end had me on a high. I made sure to sign up before I knew the real hurt would set in... For like, three days that followed, I was a horrible, stiff mess. Could barely move... But no regrets! So excited to keep going, and hoping that I stick with it. Not going to lie -- I so badly want to get this that I've actually thought about joining a gym so I can work on building muscle in order to get that pole hold (and more!). And its because I genuinely WANT to. That's so crazy coming from someone like me.  All in all, this is the greatest thing I could have ever, ever done."
poledancing,2r3wbg,missmichellepole,2,Thu Jan 15 18:24:02 2015 UTC,I'm so happy to hear this! It's also amazing how much of what you say sounds exactly like me when I started. I can't wait to hear about your victories going forward. Also BIG BIG BIG APPLAUSE for your Fireman victory and BIGGER APPLAUSE for signing up for 5 more weeks and making that commitment to fitness. Congratulations.
poledancing,2r3wbg,missmichellepole,3,Thu Jan 15 19:29:37 2015 UTC,"First of all, a MASSIVE congratulations for finally dispelling the bullshit excuses and deciding to take the plunge.  I commend you.  Okay, tip time.    Fair warning: POLE HURTS.  You'll eventually end up bruised and with various sore muscles that you forgot you had.  You may even find yourself needing to field questions from your doctor because they're concerned for your safety.  This happened to me on more than one occasion.  They have to ask if they see cause for concern, like legs and/or arms that are bruised all to hell.  It's going to be very hard, but try your best to NOT compare yourself to the other members of your class.  That is the quickest way to lose motivation (and I speak from experience here).  Moderate your expectations for yourself.  This is a brand-new thing you're learning, and if you don't have previous dance/gymnastics/etc. experience, it can take a little while to click.  But don't worry about not having previous experience!  One of the best polers at my old studio didn't have any, either, and now she's absolutely phenomenal because she stuck with it.  Which brings me to my final piece of advice.  At some points, you may feel like giving up.  If pole is truly not for you, then that's the right decision.  But there will be off days, days you doubt yourself, days where you just can't seem to execute anything you've learned.  Those days are few and far between, but they are very frustrating.  Work through them.  If it is overall making you happy, stick with it.  Again, congrats on taking that big first step.  Deep breaths, smile, and have fun with it!  :)"

poledancing,2qqqs4,AndStartAgain,3,Mon Dec 29 20:27:41 2014 UTC,Most of my classes are group classes but i take privates as well. Privates are a lot more expensive but i find i learn more in privates as i get to learn what moves i want and i feel i advance quicker this way but i like the atmosphere in group classes  We learn combos during classes and moves but depending on the level of some of the people in the class i dont learn as much as I'm an advance poler
poledancing,2qqqs4,myweelamb,3,Mon Dec 29 20:44:44 2014 UTC,"I think it also depends on how big the groups are. I personally can't afford private lessons, but I strategically pick which classes to go to based on how popular the class time is. (I know the Monday pole tricks class fills up, but the saturday morning one only usually has two or three people). Since I tend to go to the smaller classes for tricks, I don't personally feel the need to pay for private.   It also depends on what you're doing. Are you competing? You may want one on one time for feedback. Are you working on new tricks? You may want a private again, as u/yumdonuts said. Are you into the dance side of pole? Then group lessons are probably better value."

I do use twisted grip occasionally, if it's convenient, but I find that a lot of people learn twisted grip handsprings first and then get overly reliant on it, and never bother to train a cup or normal grip handspring, which ultimately limits them as polers. Just my opinion, though."

poledancing,2qgyg1,takhana,3,Fri Dec 26 23:56:54 2014 UTC,"Best thing to do is get your doctor's advice.   However, in my experience as long as you have a low risk pregnancy you should be able to pole fairly normally (but carefully!) during your first trimester and after that keep off the ground and only do very gentle spins.  You don't want to increase your intensity at all, but if you keep it at the level of exercise that you were at previously then you should be okay."
poledancing,2qgyg1,zydego,2,Sat Dec 27 10:25:15 2014 UTC,"Both owners of both pole schools I've learnt at have poled up to about two weeks before they gave birth. However. Both were poling for at least an hour every day every week of the year before pregnancy. Both said it's OK as long as you're sensible (not much inverting, simple stretches and holds) and listen to your body.  If you're experienced I can't see why not."

My doctor told me ""the body wants to keep doing what it's been doing,"" and to keep active... but he also said that I should be more cautious because my ligaments and muscles are more relaxed now, and I could be more prone to accidents. I was still doing silks/lyra up until last week, but this week I'm starting to feel my joints getting hypermobile... hip joint popping out; ankles rolling really easily. I'm also getting hit pretty hard by the first trimester fatigue, so I generally don't feel like moving too much anyway.  I'm staying with my parents and they are way overprotective, so no aerial antics for me :( I'm quite sad about it, because I can't help but think about how far behind I'll fall and how long I'll have to be off the pole.

I've been quite lucky with the ceiling because there are no marks on it from the pole being up, just from when I tried to move it without loosening it properly :p  I've also been quite naughty with leveling my pole; I never do it (except i did get a cool tool kit for xmas so I think i'll have to starting from now) and I haven't had any problems with it. But I don't do spins or anything too hardout on my pole because i have limited space/I'm quite bad at spins   Finding a stud was quite difficult because the stud detector was picking up my entire ceiling but luckily a couple of my studs are semi visible under certain lights so I just improvised again"
poledancing,2qck5d,potttaaattoooo,3,Thu Dec 25 07:58:23 2014 UTC,"My pole gets taken down whenever guests come over since its right in the middle of the living room, but I usually just loosen it to the point where I can get it down then put it behind the sofa until it goes up again.  Finding a joist was ok, my partner showed me how to knock on the ceiling to find them - knocking until you find something that doesn't sound hollow, then knock along to make sure, then across to make sure how wide it is.  I would definitely recommend getting a good spirit level though."
poledancing,2qck5d,oddsockies,3,Thu Dec 25 08:36:29 2014 UTC,"I'm a uni student, so I move rooms at least once a year, changing between dorms. I mostly only take it down if I'm moving. I've found that magnetic stud finders, or even just strong magnets, have been the best for finding ceiling joists.  I have a level too for keeping it straight, but I used to just kind of eyeball it before. Finding the joists is the biggest pain though... I'm usually standing on beds and desks on my tiptoes thinking ""this would be easier if I had my pole up"" but of course I don't because that's what I'm trying to do."

poledancing,2qck5d,TraumaBunny,2,Fri Dec 26 17:52:33 2014 UTC,"I should probably take mine down more often, lol. But finding ceiling joists wasn't too hard. A little awkward trying to hold the detector up against the ceiling, but if you move it around enough you can find a pattern that makes it clear where the studs are. I recommend making pencil marks. Also once you find a good spot for the pole, make some little pencil marks around the edge of the dome on the ceiling. No one ever notices it and it makes it super easy to put it back up again.  Edit: side note, if you put it up on carpet, check the tension after a day or two, and again after a week or two. Just give it a good shake. Eventually it will sink into the carpet padding and need to be tightened a little bit again. Just a little though, and only once. It won't get loose enough to fall, but it'll give you a good startle, lol.  Edit edit: aaalllssooo, if you get a little short level, mine is like a 6 inch one, and place it vertically along the pole, and then walk with it in a circle around the pole, that's the easiest way I have found to check if its level."
poledancing,2qck5d,snadypeepers,2,Thu Dec 25 15:53:46 2014 UTC,"I have lath and plaster ceiling/walls so it's damn near impossible to find a joist. Methods like knocking on the ceiling,  inserting a small nail to find one, and using a stud finder do not work well with my ceiling.  My SO was kind enough to go up to our attic to identify where the joists are and we found that they were ~3 inches to either side of our light fixture. That's the marker I now use when putting up the pole.  I rely on the door frames/window frames to help ""level"" the pole when I'm putting it up. That means walking around the pole and finding at least three points to check against. Then I verify with a level when it's almost fully tightened.  I leave it up almost all the time. The only time I take it down is when I don't want to explain it to guests - older generation of my family/conservative guests."

Finding the beams isn't hard at all. I actually find it easier in older places cause you can often actually see them as well. I just use a sensor thing I bought.   I am completely obsessive about getting my pole straight. I figure it's a safety issue so I take it seriously. Probably another reason I prefer to leave mine up is that it will take me a while to get it straight. I believe it's worth the extra time and the very small cost of buying a level.

What's changed - confidence.  At the beginning my teacher had to reassure me a lot.  Now I do the reassuring of other girls.  It's no longer I can't do that, it's I can't do that YET.

I even managed to get my shoulder mount last month (and that was a huge surprise because I was showing my friends what I'd been practicing and I literally said ""I can't do this move yet"" two seconds before doing it for the first time).

I have a lot of (reasonable) goals for 2015, but the big ones are: - Splits training (not necessarily to get my splits, but to consistently work on them).  - Ayseha, elbow grip.  - Handspring, cup grip.  - Dance once a week in pants (so I'm not using tricks in dancing, just spins and floorwork)"

I danced in front of a lot of people on a big stage for the first time and loved it. I made new friends and found this subreddit. I got my splits, lost them, got them back (well, nearly...). And I got sooooo much stronger.  For 2015 my goals are:   getting my splits back for good (and hopefully getting a lot lower on middle splits) more dancing on stages, it's fun nailing that ayesha and getting my handspring (well, after the shoulder is completely healed - today was the first day in weeks where it didn't hurt in the morning, so yay) doing a professional pole-photoshooting, that should be fun learning even more new tricks than 2014  more freestyles!

I've come along way, though, especially since I've been working entirely on my own from square 0.  I've gotten my aerial inverts, supermen (supermans?), various hip holds, extended butterflies, rough shoulder mounts, and I've gotten way closer to front and center splits than ever before.  What I'm most proud of, though, is that I'm poling consistently.  I had long periods of ""I'll never be able to do this"" when I started.  Now, I aim to pole and stretch every day, knowing that I won't be perfect, and I still usually hit 5 days a week.  Coming from a totally sedentary lifestyle, I'm really happy with that.  So I really want to keep it up in 2015.  I need to avoid relapse in my attitude and maintain the discipline.  As for more specific things...   Smooth shoulder mounts, aerial shoulder mounts.  There's so much I want to do with those I drool just thinking about it. Ayesha.  I've got inverted D and extended butterfly, so I just need to break whatever mental block prevents me from taking both feet off the pole in that position.  Then, start training the handspring and the lifts. One handed inverts.  I've seen them a couple of times and they're just so cute. Tornado Roll.  I've coveted this for a long time.  I've got a rough brass monkey (though my entrance looks like poop), but that's as far as I've gotten so far. Get my front and center splits.  I've come along way, I think I can probably get them both in a year if I keep up at the rate I'm going. Start training back flex.  I decided not to work my back initially so my stretch routine didn't take forever, but once I've got my splits pretty far along, it'll be time to start doing my back too. Take a damn class.  At least to try it out.  I haven't gotten up the courage, and even if I don't decide to take them regularly, I want to see what the whole class thing is like."

I did manage to nail extended butterfly, though I'd like to make it more ""extended"" this year. I almost have my flat side splits, but it's still not as flat as I'd like. And I really slacked off on trying to get a freestanding handstand, but I do feel more comfortable with handstands now. This coming from someone who was absolutely terrified of them.  This year, my pole-trick goal is the ayesha. I just started shoulder mounting a month ago and can do it pretty consistently and comfortably, so I don't think this goal is too crazy. I'd rather set the bar lower and surprise myself when I find out a new trick is not so hard, than feel disappointed that I still can't do a certain move after a year of attempts.  :P"

poledancing,2pqf9x,Fridky,6,Thu Dec 18 23:30:38 2014 UTC,"Work on your grip both positioning and tightness! I winced when I saw you invert then immediately start sliding, it's so easy to injure your neck or back in a position like that! I recommend slowly lifting your legs in a tucking motion adjusting your grip until it feels secure. You really shouldn't be sliding plus the tucks will help build core strength and help you learn to invert without kicking."

The arm that's closest to the pole grips below, the arm that's furthest away grips above the other. Also try to straighten your legs in the chopper, that makes it look better."

I would recommend a grip aid if you're impatient like me! I put some i-tac on a rag and rub the rag on the pole. I clean the pole with rubbing alcohol if it gets too dirty, but it's pretty low maintenance.      It sounds like your pole is permanently attached to the ceiling? At any rate, just to be safe, I'd recommend checking the points of attachment once a month. Better to spend an extra minute, than risk serious injury and damage!      Also, remember not to wear an jewelery/shoes that could scratch the pole. Pole scratches=cuts in weird places. Be safe and have fun!"

Some things to think about when you find a few options for studios:  -Are you looking to do this for fun, fitness, or to try something new? (or all three) If you're doing it to get fit or to compete, look on PSO's page, or see if they make note of any competitions that they do on their website, things like that.  -What are you comfortable doing? If you're really not a sensual person (like me! haha) you probably aren't going to find that a studio where all of the classes have 'sexy' or 'exotic' in the title is the best fit for you.   -When you have two or three options, email or call them to see if they do tours or drop in classes so you're not committing to a multi-week workshop before you know if you like it.

Then practice bringing your body in front of the pole and maintaining the hang. Once you're there it's really easy to maintain grip while you're messing around with trying to find your ankle and rolling into the hold. Also, practice your hold from a standing position so you can easily grab the foot and roll the elbow out and over, if you can do it standing then you can do it upside down as gravity is way more on your side when you're inverted :D"

poledancing,2pbmcs,notchappedlips,6,Mon Dec 15 03:08:57 2014 UTC,"I did, once upon a time. For about 3 years, I did no form of exercise except walking/ biking places I needed to go and doing my pole routine. By the end of it, I was jacked. People would comment on how muscular I'd become.  The catch of this is that I was a stripper at the time, which means that pole dancing was a decent part of my life. I was committing a couple hours a day (15 minutes every hour for 6-8 hours) 5 days a week to pole work in addition to any dancing I did off stage and any extra, unscheduled time I got to practice on stage while there were no patrons in the club, which wasn't an infrequent occurrence.   If I were to go back and do it again, I would have also worked on reducing my calorie intake and included more cardio outside of dancing. As strong and muscular as I became, I never lost much fat or otherwise achieved the look I wanted.   So, the answer is yes, you can become toned with pole dancing. But it would possibly take several hours a day of practice and should also be used in conjunction with  reduced calorie diet in order to lose weight, if that is a goal of yours. Good luck and have fun."
poledancing,2pbmcs,dabunbun,5,Mon Dec 15 05:42:53 2014 UTC,"I didn't lose any weight from pole dance, but I definitely developed a good bit of muscle tone. Mostly, though, I'm just really proud of learning a new skill and pushing myself to be able to do more things than I ever thought I would be able to do. I never thought of myself as athletic until I started pole!  Oh, yeah. I despise most forms of exercise. So, running? No. Weights? No. I pretty much just do pole exclusively, though recently I started branching out into other aerial arts (lyra and silks.)"
poledancing,2pbmcs,larafrompinkpony,3,Mon Dec 15 06:10:19 2014 UTC,"My upper body strength has for sure gotten a lot better over just several weeks of practice, I've noticed bicep and tricep development and I can do more pullups on a pullup bar. I've heard that as you progress things like abs will be worked harder so I'm excited for that. If it weren't an exercise I probably wouldn't be as interested in pole, the muscle aches are a sign of muscles being worked out and developed."
poledancing,2pbmcs,MyMuddyEyes,3,Mon Dec 15 05:39:20 2014 UTC,"I have definitely noticed increased strength and have become noticeably more muscular in the five or six months that I've been doing pole. My shoulders have got a bit bigger as well, and I'm noticing a much more athletic figure, and pole is the only exercise that I do (other than walking to work and back).  As other people have said, however, just doing pole probably isn't going to do much on the weight loss side of things. If you're wanting to lose weight as well as becoming tones, you'll probably want to add in more off-the-pole cardio.  But if pole is something that you will enjoy and will do, then go for it. I personally wouldn't ever go to a gym. I know that I just wouldn't bother going, but I love pole and can't get enough. Having a form of exercise that you actually enjoy is so important because you will actually do it and enjoy it, rather than feeling like you're forcing yourself to exercise."
poledancing,2pbmcs,girl-replica,3,Mon Dec 15 11:40:37 2014 UTC,"In 6 months of pole, I've become a lot more visibly muscular, especially in the arms (biceps, triceps, shoulders, forearms) and abs.  It's done nothing visible for my legs, though I've seen a tiny bit of gain in my upper glutes.  I've also lost a noticeable, though not huge, amount of fat.  However, I was eating at maintenance before I started, didn't change diet, and added pole to an otherwise 100% sedentary life.  My weight has decreased a few pounds, though weight loss is not a goal of mine.  So I'd say yes, pole can definitely build you muscles, and thereby increase muscle tone if your body fat percentage is low enough.  You may want some other form of training for your legs, though.  It won't make you lose weight/fat unless you're eating a deficit, just like everything else.  (Disclaimer: I built muscle like crazy for no particular reason, so I'm not sure how common it is to bulk up quickly the way I have.  Your mileage may vary.)"
poledancing,2pbmcs,angelagabbie,3,Mon Dec 15 15:16:33 2014 UTC,"I DETEST exercising, except for pole! So yes, pole is my only form of exercise though I have started lyra and silks.  My roommate over the last few months has commented that I've been losing weight, but that was when I first threw myself into pole fitness and since then I've plateaued in weight loss, but that's also because I haven't been incorporating any cardio which is necessary for getting lean as opposed to very bulky. To remedy that, I've been taking more dance-y choreo classes that keep your heart rate up.  Also, both my roommate and my boyfriend have commented that my butt has gotten way more toned AND bigger. Hell ya.  EDIT: Weight loss will also of course be impacted by your (or your studio's) training regimen. Some studios I've been to only do a short warm up consisting of stretching and some head rolls, whereas all the instructors at the studio I go to now always start the class with a well-rounded warm up for the abs, shoulders, thighs, flexibility, etc. So I would also say don't be afraid to visit other studios and find one that has a structure/instructors best suited for you."

poledancing,2p2l5c,misskittycharms,2,Fri Dec 12 11:44:49 2014 UTC,"So, I think if you try this, you can get it to look a little flatter: your hand needs to be more toward the lower back/upper butt, and then you let your pelvis tilt back and your butt roll over your hands into an 'ass on a platter' position(this photo illustrates what I'm talking about).  That's going to let your back leg drop lower if you don't have the active flexibility to just throw it back there.  How close are you to having your splits on the floor?  Do you work your reclining splits? This is what you're aiming for.  You don't really have to keep your hips square in this one, so you can sort of fake the flexibility and let your leg that's down come across to the centerline of the your body so you can pull the top leg down further.  This is really handy for both your assisted and true jades.  Jade is a hard one to make look right, but even sticking to the pole in it like you're doing is a huge accomplishment, so good on ya!  Keep working on your flexibility and you'll get there in no time!"

Also, this gets my Jade waaayyy flatter but is not for everyone: try gripping the leg closest to you on the outside of your ankle instead of inside. Like instead of your hand going over your ankle and gripping on top with your thumb towards your foot, let your hand go between your leg and body/under your leg instead I over and grip your ankle thumb down/away from your foot.  Like this: http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/c1/51/9a/c1519aaeab61505538dd0e472b1e3a63.jpg  Definitely not for everyone method: try the tip above and twist your body away from your leg and pole. You must be able to keep steady balance and the grip on the pole with your hips square and only twist from the waist up. You'd be facing slightly away from the pole this way instead of directly up but it also makes it flatter."

poledancing,2oqhw2,angelagabbie,1 point,Tue Dec 9 21:38:24 2014 UTC,"It's possible to pursue poling at home.  I think it depends on your level of free time and ability to self-motivate how well it will go.  I don't see any harm in giving it a try.  If you find yourself poling less or wanting classes for some other reason, you can just start taking them again, or taking fewer as /u/missmichellepole suggested.  I've never gotten up the courage to go to a class, but have been learning at home for about 6 months.  There are a lot of good free resources online.  Aerial Amy is great, Julia Wahl (emotioncatcher on youtube) is also one of my favorites.  Random youtubers can be surprisingly helpful, and I'll usually watch several different tutorials if something is vexing me so I can get many perspectives on how to do a move.  I don't know about SV or other pay sites.  I haven't tried them.  Especially since you already have significant experience, I think you could give solo poling a try.  You can always change your mind if it doesn't work out.  :)"

poledancing,2ohjld,flow-er,2,Tue Dec 9 07:07:47 2014 UTC,Diva Dive is another good move to get into Brass Monkey.  You do need to shift your hips over to the side of the pole to get the correct grip though.
poledancing,2og1vr,MrsCano,4,Sat Dec 6 07:57:47 2014 UTC,"I still have this problem sometimes. I think the best advice I have received on it (which will be hard to explain in text) is to swing your leg around really big, and don't lift your other leg off the ground until you have to for your own balance. Kind of fall into it, if that makes sense?"
poledancing,2og1vr,bluemocha,5,Sat Dec 6 15:52:46 2014 UTC,"I had a similar problem and this is exactly what worked for me. I used to just walk into the spin. Lift your leg up and away, swing and lean into the spin a bit to get the momentum going."
poledancing,2og1vr,larafrompinkpony,3,Sat Dec 6 18:07:47 2014 UTC,"How long have you been poling? If you're a newbie, this is pretty common and normal. It takes a while for the muscles to sort themselves out and ""click"" on a move. After that happens, usually your muscles will be like, ""this is totally inefficient... I can stop doing that and save myself some energy."" Can you post a video?   When I teach spins, I always teach them with a 3 step entrance. (Inside, outside, pivot on inside foot and swing outside leg around into the spin.) I find that it gives enough momentum to stop most people from jumping into spins. I feel like most people tend to jump into spins because they feel like they're not getting enough momentum or height.  I also practice spins without the spin - like, I just lift my body into the position I want to hold during the spin, like I'm doing a pullup. Mostly I do this to make sure my lines are good, but I think it might help with your habit of jumping as well."
poledancing,2og1vr,lentil5,1 point,Sat Dec 6 22:04:11 2014 UTC,"You get your momentum from whatever leg is sweeping you into the spin, not from your jump. Try sweeping bigger and see if that helps. For example, the fireman (I like to call it firewoman!) it's your outside leg that sweeps and hooks your ankle on the back of the pole - so make that sweep really big and let that movement carry you through the spin. We also forget that spins do require engagement in the upper body, so really think about pushing that pole into the ground like you're driving a fence post. This will help you keep your body away from the pole, which will also drive your momentum. Let us know how it all goes!"
poledancing,2oe861,anxious_squid,23,Fri Dec 5 20:20:17 2014 UTC,"Honestly, the best way to get better at pole is to do more pole! The strength will come naturally as you practise. I was exactly the same as you on my first lesson in the summer and now I'm able to lift and hold my whole body weight with my arms no problem. I've got legitimate arm muscles and even my back is suddenly muscular. And I don't really do any exercise other than pole.  Don't get discouraged because you're not as strong as the other girls, especially when they've been doing it for a few months already. Generally speaking, everyone starts out weak, uncoordinated and graceless. You'll get there with practice. And if you enjoy pole, give it a few more tries. You'll quickly notice that you're getting stronger because you'll be working those muscles in class. In your first few pole classes, you'll be using muscles you've never used before, so it's no wonder they aren't very strong yet.  If you want to work on your upper body strength, get a pull-up bar (or do pull-ups/chin-ups at the gym). That will help you more than something like push-ups, because it will get you used to lifting your whole body weight with your arms. Good luck!"

If you do pull-ups/chin-ups it is also good to do a ""push"" exercise such as push ups or you can develop a muscle imbalance.  There's a great saying that I continually like to remind myself of: Don't compare your beginning to someone else's middle. If you stick with pole I'm sure you will see progress.  Then in a few months you can be an inspiration to a beginner who is in the position you are now!"
poledancing,2oe861,teslastrong,13,Tue Dec 16 05:12:09 2014 UTC,"I started in September 2013.  My first class I could not do a single sit up without putting my hands on the ground or lift myself off the ground at all.  I hurt for DAYS afterwards.  Like made my husband stir things that I was cooking because I was so sore.  But, I kept going to class, and the progression just came. Here I am December 2014 (had to take 2 months off for surgery) and I can climb, invert, and when I do a layback I can basically do a situp to get upright again.  The nice thing about pole, is that the strength and abilities come as you do it more. It's easy to compare yourself to others and feel bad, I know, I've been teaching myself to not do that anymore.  We are all individuals and have our own journey to take.  Each person in class has a different history and a different body. I wouldn't fret too much about not having strength out of the gate, the muscles will build over time.  If you want to help them along a bit, do your warmups between classes."

I've been practicing pole for over a year and the thing I've noticed with a lot of newbies is that they believe their strength is the issue where it's actually a combination of technique issues and fear. I was lucky and had done a fair amount of body weight strength training so doing pole moves came easily to me, that and the fact that I really am not afraid to attempt new moves even if I'm unsure whether I will be successful with it. I find pole is so much of a mind game, often people convince themselves that they can not do it when they would be perfectly capable of pulling off they move."

As cheesy as it sounds you need to learn how to handle the pole because at first your grip will be too loose, or too strong, and that'll make you struggle with your spins.

poledancing,2oe861,looseleafliesoflow,1 point,Sat Dec 20 08:49:50 2014 UTC,"Part of any sport or dance is conditioning; e.g. ballet dancers often do yoga, and the male ones lift weights regularly, and any football player will tell you that a good deal of their practice sessions involve running sprints and doing pushups.  You just need to exercise your weaker muscles when you don't have class so that you can build your strength to execute proper technique and form when you do have class.  Try doing some pushups and leg lifts for your upper body and core, and just see how many you can do in a minute.  Do this every day for a month (maybe after a run?) and notice the difference in how many you can do.  Push yourself, reward yourself with a liter of water and some protein, and watch your abilities improve over time."

I had a friend take a picture last week and I never realized how twisted and non-planar my body ends up when I do that move.  It needs a lot of work so I can, eventually, start trying inverted Ds."

poledancing,2o20nc,kcbrush,1 point,Tue Dec 2 22:14:01 2014 UTC,"Wow, that one looks great too.  I think I like the straight-legged look of the wrist sit combo a bit more, but I think I already have the components of the double knee hang version.  Might as well just work on both.  Thanks!"
poledancing,2o20nc,girl-replica,3,Tue Dec 2 23:07:42 2014 UTC,"I had a great workshop last week and finally got my janeiro! For some reason I could never hold balance in that trick but she gave me a tip that just made it all click. I'm also able to do this little press up thing into it. So I'm playing around with leg variations of that. I'm also going to work on some cool dance type spin combos. I'd like more combos that I love and am familiar with for free style purposes so I want to build up my repertoire.  I'm hoping to work on some elbow grips in open studio later this week. I also need to start training my twisted grip from now on because I'd like to be able to balance endlessly in it.  My yearly goals have gone well surprisingly. I spent many months with injury but I still managed to get a lot accomplished. I choreographed three solo routines (2 lyra, 1 pole), I performed in my first full length aerial production which I also helped choreograph, which also got me on cube, a new apparatus for me. I wanted to work on handstands and now I'm taking a weekly class at my studio and participating in the handstand challenge this month at r/bodyweightfitness. My strength also seems better than ever which I love!"
poledancing,2o20nc,uargvak,3,Tue Dec 2 19:54:46 2014 UTC,I am trying to use more core more when I invert (and a million other things) rather than just using my arms so much. Other than that just general practice. =D

Even if you can't nail it right away, lifting your legs or tucking your knees to your chest and bringing them back down slowly is amazing core conditioning.  At least for me, that kind of conditioning greatly improved the quality of my inverts."
poledancing,2o20nc,Saruz,3,Wed Dec 3 14:56:20 2014 UTC,"Russian split. I tried it one day from the floor tons of time, only to discover that it's way easier on the pole. Tried it twice last practice time at the studio with my teacher spotting me, now it's time to try it on my own to get comfortable since I'm putting it in a choreo. Handspring! I've been poling for 1.5 years and for some reasons never tried it, so when I first tried it tonight from an invert I got it ! Now to practice, practice, practice. It's not really a trick, but I got accepted at Pole Art Italy and I'm working on a story for my choreo. It's harder than training."

poledancing,2nltv9,Zerogravity86,4,Fri Nov 28 15:09:32 2014 UTC,"Hey.  I'm a guy as well that does a lot of pole stuff.  I know what you mean when you say that you're trying to find routines are aren't too ""sensual.""  Sometimes it's hard but there are a lot of really impressive guy performers out there that are pretty amazing athletes.  These are a couple of the guys that I follow on youtube:  Evgeny Greshilov  Alex Schukin  Vladimir Karachunov  Kenneth Kao  Evgeny is probably my favourite because he's absurdly strong and a lot of the moves he does aren't super flexi which is nice because I personally am not very flexible.  I'm like you, in that, i'm looking for routines that are move about impressive feats of strength rather and the ""sexy"" routines.    Keep with it.  You'd be amazed at how quickly you'll advance.  Guys tend to be much stronger and are able to pull off the inverts and the leg hangs much sooner than some guys.  I've been doing it for less than a year and I've already moved into the really advanced classes.  Feel free to PM me if you want some more advice.  Good luck with it."
poledancing,2nltv9,Zerogravity86,1 point,Fri Nov 28 11:38:35 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback :)  You say that you're doing this for a year now - how often, and were you athletic at the beginning? I did some sports and dancing in the past, but fell out of shape recently - and I'm curious when I'll be able to do anything properly.  Also: do you get issues with sweat? I sweat a lot, and I guess men do sweat a lot more than women in general. I wonder if there are any pro tips regarding this (aside from using that white powder available in the class)"
poledancing,2nltv9,Crochetems,2,Fri Nov 28 15:09:08 2014 UTC,"I was doing it once a week when I started but I'm up to about 3 classes a week now, 1 on Monday and 2 over the weekends.  As for athletics, I had been doing some strength training for about a year before I started pole so I had a good base to build off of for pole and I still doing training during the week which I think really helps me out.  You may want to look into some basic strength training stuff as the guys that I've seen that do that as well advance a lot faster than guys that just do pole.  Sweating...Yea, it's a problem.  I know a guy that specifically uses gloves because his hands sweat a lot but most guys I know that do it just tend to use a shaving gel or dryhands but try out a bunch of different grips and see what works best for you.  Grip tends to be pretty personal.    Also, on that note, you may want to look to shaving your legs or chest if you've got a good amount of hair.  Having your body hair getting yanked out on a pole is not a good feeling."

poledancing,2nky4r,jirujnte,3,Thu Nov 27 14:58:22 2014 UTC,"Hello!  In regards to staying in this position longer, do you mean you are slipping out of it? If so, squeeze your thighs together like you intend to cross your knees. Think of it like closing a pair of scissors with a pencil in between the blades. Your legs are the blades, the pole is the pencil. Cross-squeeze your legs without actually crossing your legs. This provides a strong hold.   As for hand placement, not sure what you mean, but you should already be able to let go with your top hand in this picture. Your bottom hand is alright. You bed to have a firm grip with your thighs though. If you want to get more horizontal, your bottom hand needs to move way down and your hips need to turn down. Basically a whole other pole move (look up ""plank""). Otherwise, I'm not sure what your specific concerns are with your hand placement. For any move like this, if you want a bigger back arch/extension off the pole, slide your bottom hand lower and let go with the top, but not so much you tip over!  Let me know if you need any clarifications or have more questions :)  -former pole instructor"
poledancing,2nky4r,brittanybangs,1 point,Thu Nov 27 17:29:23 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much! And I guess what I meant was how low my hand should be (chest level? belly button level?) to grip in order to have a good back arch. I'm always scared of tipping over, but I guess it's the fear I should get over."
poledancing,2nky4r,brittanybangs,1 point,Fri Nov 28 02:02:50 2014 UTC,"No problem! And your hand should go probably around chest height, a bit lower, if you are just wanting to do a back arch. Experiment with how bent your elbow should be vs. straight. Otherwise, you are getting into plank territory and you need to angle your hips, lock your thighs, and brace yourself with a hand on the bottom of the pole.  Just experiment with where you feel comfortable. Look at your body in the mirror and try and make the shape you desire by playing around. And if you are worried about tipping over, put a mat under you! In fact, always put a mat under you whenever you are practicing a new move, a difficult move, or a move you are not 100% confident in. It has saved me more times than not! If you don't have a mat, use pillows or couch cushions! :)"
poledancing,2nky4r,riotmaker37,2,Fri Nov 28 04:53:55 2014 UTC,"We do ""open"" moves like this in my class a lot. I think an option for you could be to tilt your hips away from the pole (towards the camera) to get a lot of contact and hold with your ""top"" leg (the one behind in the picture. Then you should be able to let go with your bottom hand and tilt your shoulders towards the camera as we'll to increase the friction on your leg and get an even stronger hold. If you are still slipping at this point, that would lead me to believe your skin is dry and not sticking to the pole enough. Hope that made sense."
poledancing,2nky4r,missmichellepole,3,Thu Nov 27 18:58:06 2014 UTC,"Tilting your hips is super important- when I learned it, we were taught that your belly button should be about four inches to the side of the pole. Also, try crossing your ankles to get a tighter grip. With these two things combined, you should be able to sit with no hands for as long as your skin can handle-- if you're doing it right, it'll feel like someone's giving you a snakebite (remember those from elementary school?) where your upper thighs grip the pole"
poledancing,2nky4r,missmichellepole,1 point,Thu Nov 27 19:33:31 2014 UTC,"Wow that sounds like a hell of a burn, but I'll try tilting my hips anyway! Haven't tried that out yet.  Thanks for your responses!"

poledancing,2nky4r,MyMuddyEyes,1 point,Fri Nov 28 16:28:41 2014 UTC,I would recommend dropping the top arm lower or letting go of the bottom arm. The positioning of the top hand right now seems too high.

If they can't get it straight in their head that I've never been nor shall I ever be a stripper, well that's their problem.   I am currently a pole instructor and professional performer. I've performed at a fancy local talent show and a fashion show in my city. I also do pole community events and competitions. There are opportunities to perform outside of a club.   I have a pole at home. Since I train so much at my studio my home pole doesn't get much love though. My husband could literally care less about sexy pole dancing. When you've lived with a pole dancer for five years it kind of loses its allure. He's impressed by any new tricks or feats of strength and flexibility I conquer, but he really only comes to my shows to support me, there's no private dancing going on.   People find it weird I guess. When I first started weird would definitely be the term I'd use. In five years the public opinion on it has changed. Nowadays I get mostly intrigue. Usually people already know that non-stripper pole dancing exists. The way I present it now is different too. I am quite confident in my choice to be a pole dancer now... back then it was just a hobby."

Again, pole dancing is very different from stripping/sexy dancing-- There is some overlap, but they're not the same. I would highly recommend you look at competition videos on youtube to get a better idea.   Its not that people are trying not to perform for their partner, but that's not the point/goal of doing pole for 95% of people, especially those that do it for a workout"
poledancing,2nlj45,Lisho,2,Mon Dec 1 04:35:51 2014 UTC,"I often work out in front of my partner, but putting up a show takes time and effort to make a routine, or a great amount of confidence and skill to be able to freestyle. Therefore I guess most poledancers just don't care to make the effort to put on a sexy show for their SO, when they can have a great workout without the hassle instead.  Also the sexy type of pole isn't for everyone, and the ones who are into pole for fitness may not feel like their SO would be interested in a private performance when it's not sexy and erotic. Or maybe they have issues with the whole idea of sexy, I know for myself that I feel silly trying to be sexy and I know that if I made a mistake I would blush and panic for ""ruining it"". I would like to put on a show for my boyfriend sometime, just need to find the confidence first.  In the end, poledance isn't as sexy as it looks on performance-vids. It's a tough sport, it makes you sweat, being upside down using all kinds of muscles can make you queef and fart, you bruise, sliding down the pole makes weird squeeking-noises, some moves are awfully painful and it's damn hard to make all the moves and transitions look pretty and graceful. I guess it's a occupational hazard of being a poledancer, suddenly it's not so sexy anymore when you get to know the whole package :)"
poledancing,2nlj45,missmichellepole,2,Mon Dec 1 02:31:51 2014 UTC,"That did used to be a big stereotype, and it would be wrong to deny that pole dance did evolve from stripping and sex work, but as it gets more popular, people see that the exotic side is just one style in the sport's wide range. In my experience, either people are immediately in awe, or they draw from the stripper stereotype- it depends how much they know about how the sport actually is.  As far as what one does with this experience- it seems like an odd question to me. What does one do with soccer or football experience outside of joining a league? In pole, you join a studio and take classes.  As far as your questions about putting on a show for their lover, you certainly can, but pole dancing isn't something you do for other people, it's something you do for yourself. I would recommend you look up some competition videos on youtube, and you'll see that pole sport is quite different from what you think it is.  Many studios put on shows a few times per year, or you can compete through organizations like Pole Sport Organization, who has a regional and national competition each year. Or you can take classes and just keep learning new moves! Again, the connection you seem to be missing is that pole dancing and stripping are not the same thing, (although more erotic dancing is one of many styles of dancing you could do) and you do it for yourself, not to impress a lover or anyone else.  When people see what pole dancing really is (basically yoga and gymnastics combined and in the air) they don't find it weird at all."
poledancing,2nlj45,larafrompinkpony,4,Thu Nov 27 19:29:37 2014 UTC,"Actually, pole dancing didn't originate from stripping and sex work! I think it only got associated with that in the late 60s really. The pole dancing most of us frequently practice here is closer related to a traditional indian sport:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallakhamba"
poledancing,2nlj45,Crochetems,11,Fri Nov 28 01:06:38 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I disagree. I feel like a lot of polers like to trot this one out to whitewash the history of pole dance - they either bring up Mallakhamb or Chinese Acrobatic Pole. But let's be honest - most of us polers learned from female instructors, who were either former/current exotic dancers themselves, or learned from one. Fawnia Dietrich, Leigh-Ann Reilly, Karol Helms, Alethea Austin, Felix Cane, Pantera and Alena Downs were ALL exotic dancers at some point. Pantera gets called the ""grandmother of pole"" because she invented/popularized moves like the elbow grip ayesha and the kneehold. Jamilla Deville came up with the Jade/Deville splits, and then there's Allegra King with her namesake move. Sarah Cretul invented the twisted grip lift handspring. All are former dancers and/or trained by one. Even Sheila Kelley, the actress who a lot of people credit with popularizing pole dance with the general public with her appearances on talk shows and doing the ""S-Factor Workout"", was inspired to take up the sport because she did a movie about strippers. Yeah.  Indian Mallakhamb is traditionally a men's sport, and so is Chinese Acrobatic Pole. I went to Pole Expo in Vegas this year, and there were NO Indian dudes in loincloths there. Modern pole dance is definitely more woman-focused (though there's room for everyone of course) but the pole dance we practice - on metal poles 45-50mm in diameter, definitely originated from stripping and sex work. I don't disgree that there is definitely some cross pollination going on though, especially with moves like the Fonji and the Kamikaze coming from Chinese pole."
poledancing,2nlj45,larafrompinkpony,3,Fri Nov 28 18:05:40 2014 UTC,Modern pole exists because of exotic dancing but I think he/she meant pole sport of some sort pre-dates that and obviously pole today comes from both.

I admit I don't know enough to make that distinction for myself yet.  Also I'm confused by your use of whitewash, wouldn't whitewashing the history of pole dance be claiming that it completely originated from white strippers and not giving credit to non-white origins? I feel like I must be misunderstanding because it doesn't really go with what else you are saying haha"

I've also heard some arguments for pole dancing originating in the circus, from performers dancing on circus tent poles. I don't know how many of these sex workers would even get the opportunity to train in a men's sport like Mallakhamb. Even if they did pick up some tricks here and there from CAP and Mallakhamb, you can't deny that the greatest shapers of modern pole have been primarily women who were exotic dancers. From my experiences talking to them, they were mostly self-taught and/or learned in the club from watching other women. IMHO, there's really only so much you can do on a pole - I would say it's more a case of convergent evolution rather than divergent. There are many elements seen in modern pole that aren't found in Mallakhamb or CAP, like spins, and a lot of foundational moves requiring inner thigh grip. (As you an imagine, moves like the Superman or a layback would be, ah, problematic for male pole dancers... especially with small diameter poles.) All that points, to me at least, to a different origin than Mallakhamb and CAP.   When I said ""whitewashing,"" I meant more in the sense of hiding/denying pole dancing's exotic origins in favor of making it more sanitized and palatable for the suburban housewives who don't want to do anything too scandalous :P Makes it more marketable to people who want to claim that it's all about fitness, and not ""what those icky strippers do""."

poledancing,2nlj45,DorienGrais,11,Fri Nov 28 20:03:02 2014 UTC,"I think it's interesting you bring up the idea of cultural appropriation! It's actually something I've spent some time thinking about. While I can say (as a stripper) that it doesn't offend me that non-strippers pole dance, it's not like I speak for all strippers and I can't, like, write you an official pass that sanctions it for you to bust out in case anyone questions you about it.  For me, cultural appropriation is only problematic when a privileged class rejects the original culture it came from... Does that make any sense? Like, ""it's OK for ME to pole dance because I make it about art and fitness, but when strippers do it, it's gross and skanky.""   I also think that pole dance has also grown beyond what you typically see in the club. Some of the greatest pole dancers, including some of the ones I admire the most, were never exotic dancers: Natasha Wang, Heidi Coker, Oona Kivela, David C. Owen... and they have definitely contributed more to the art than I ever have.   I think it's more important that you just approach it with a sense of respect for the art as a whole, including the origins. I got into a bit of an internet slap fight a while back with a (white) girl who did a traditional Chinese Lion Dance as part of her act as a feature stripper. I called it cultural appropriation, she got mad at me because she thought I was against her doing it because she was white. What I actually took offense to was her and her partner calling it a ""Dragon  dance"" (a completely different style) and naming her ""Dragon"" after a cartoon charter from a Disney movie voiced by Eddie Murphy. Nevermind that it's a culturally significant dance with ceremonial purpose, traditionally performed by men, she should have the right to perform it in leg warmers and a bikini top because it's a cute costume and I was racist to object to it! Plus she totally got an official pass from the people that taught it to her so it should be okay.   My problem with it wasn't that she was white and doing this dance, but rather I found it disrespectful to my culture and anyone who truly understood the dance and the culture would never have performed it in that context.  However, I don't think pole dance really has a specific religious or ceremonial significance any more than ballet, tap or jazz. It's not appropriation to do something different and outside of the traditional strip club style of pole. But for those sanitized suburban housewives poling in 7"" platform heels, waving feather boas and booty-shaking, trying to say they are doing something derived from Mallakhamb and CAP and not the strip club? Um, no. Bye Felicia."
poledancing,2nkeg3,FoxxedOut,3,Thu Nov 27 09:39:16 2014 UTC,"Just found this post going through /r/poledancing... I'm not sure why I don't see all posts here, but oh well. I definitely like elegant, long lines, but hands can definitely be used for effect. I think if you're reaching, make your entire hand splayed, so that it's very clear it's intentional to have your thumb separated. This is the photo that Alloy/PSO chose to use for the SEACC winner photo. Also, holding a more hollowed hand with strong fingers, palm up, can be a really cool emotional effect that doesn't look like just one finger is breaking the line. I do prefer extending the line of the arm though, but there has to be energy pushing through your fingers, even in a soft, graceful dance. All fingers in a flat line together doesn't look right unless you're being a robot. :) Like this picture, it's ok if some fingers aren't in a straight line. Like you said though, it's generally the thumb that makes it look wonky. Try to keep your thumb tucked in to your hand more, and the other fingers can make pretty shapes at different angles. I dislike my face in this picture, but my hand is nice. Good topic! Hands are so important in dance and can portray so much. :)"
poledancing,2nkeg3,kcbrush,2,Sun Nov 30 02:52:59 2014 UTC,"The hollowed hand is by far one of my favorite tools to use.  Here is an example from my PPC 2014 performance (please ignore the ghastly not-straight extended leg).  Putting this little detail into my pose made it come alive -- it looks like I'm truly reaching for something intangible, versus just stretching out.  See also how my gaze follows my hand, lifting my head and further adding to the ""out of reach"" feel.    As far as OP's picture goes, I think the palm up approach would have conveyed more of the reaching.  Would also be interesting to see how it looks with the palm turned to the side (facing the audience) with splayed fingers."

(I know the performance wasn't spotless, but we're all university students, and have been working at this for only a couple of weeks/two times a week)  What I want to talk about is the lines I make in the picture. The artistic aspect of it all is that I'm reaching for my partner on the other pole. The idea was great at the moment, but seeing the result on photo I hate the way my thumb sticks out ruining my line.   What are your takes on (elegant) lines versus artistic effect? I am pro being artistic and building a story and everything, because I don't want pole to become too much like gymnastics, but the thumb thing just isn't right.    Feel free to post pictures as examples :)"

poledancing,2ncrb9,missmichellepole,2,Tue Nov 25 08:18:52 2014 UTC,I've only been poling for 6 months so not sure if I'll be much help. But one thing that helps to take the pressure off the knee a bit is to get the hands in place real well and really use the bottom arm for good support before you fully lift the other leg out. I feel like my arms do a lot of the support in that pose more so than my knee.   Yea I did bruise behind my knee but nothing as crazy as my inner thighs get in general. I actually think jasmine bruised my inner thigh more than my knee.
poledancing,2ncrb9,twentythree2,2,Tue Nov 25 11:33:53 2014 UTC,"No, I don't think you're distributing pressure the wrong way.  Different people bruise in different places and they generally aren't great indicators of whether or not the pose is right or wrong.  If you feel secure in the pose, If you're not getting any lasting or shooting pain, if you're able to get in and out of the pose safely all tend to be better indications of a successful pose.    The jasmine specifically can be prone to bruises because you're hand is helping close the knee and because you're putting a lot of pressure around the knee itself.  Now that's completely normal and correct and like it or not, the bruise is probably just because you're body isn't used to being that way.  If you really are worried about it, talk to an instructor and have them look at your form but don't put much credence into a bruise being a good way to tell if you've got bad form or not.

Mostly conditioning exercises, spins, spin mode, pole sits and planks, and some knee pit grips (ex: two handed Jasmine, Stargazer while holding the leg) to help them condition their skin. We will move a student up when she can do a pull-up, hold a pencil spin for at least 3 rotations, do 5 straight-leg leg-up crunches on the pole, and a controlled handstand. We are very strict about waiting for a certain strength level before moving someone up. When ready the student can perform a controlled tuck invert right away and can usually hold the chopper fairly easily as well. In intermediate we cover laybacks, armpit grips (teddy, yogini, etc), elbow grips, inversions (leg hangs, hip holds), butterfly and extended butterfly, and finally shoulder dismount and mount. Once they have a nice controlled shoulder mount and have solid leg hangs and butterfly, and are familiar with the whole intermediate curriculum, we move em up to advanced. Advanced gets them into ayshas, starting with elbow grip and split grip, working up to twisted and cup grip. We work on drops and tumbles, unique body grip tricks (like janeiro, Allegra, Jade meathook, etc), long combos, repeated spinning inverts, aerial shoulder mounts, and anything else we think they're capable of. We've got several girls that can climb arm over arm with no legs, iron X, fonji.... Things are getting crazy over here, lol."
poledancing,2maljh,Crochetems,3,Fri Nov 14 17:59:25 2014 UTC,Our classes are very much mixed. What she'll do is she'll have a sequence of moves to demonstrate. Depending on skill level and what of it you already know it'll get broken down into what each person needs to work on.   There's no fixed levels of classes or skill requirements. Everyone develops on their strengths very quickly while more specific focus is given on weaker areas.
poledancing,2maljh,itnever3nds,3,Fri Nov 14 18:10:09 2014 UTC,"My studio is more competitor focused (Soft Sensuous Moves in San Antonio). We have 12 levels, then an Advanced class and Masters Class. Master's is the highest level, it's mostly instructors, and you have to try out to be in the level. It's a pretty elite group, led by Jennifer Huff (look her up, she's freaking great).  Each level is 4 weeks long, and they have to test out to make it into the next level. The levels start to be a little longer as the students advance, and if the students aren't getting a concept, we will sometimes introduce half levels (8.5, 9, 9.5). It usually takes them about 2 years to make it into the Master's level, which is our definition of ""advanced"" (depending on the level of fitness they start with.) Although we have a lot of students, very few students make it this far. We do allow them to test up if they don't feel challenged, but we place a lot of importance on correct form. (Stuff like if you are inverting but are kicking in to it, you don't advance). We are very strict but the students are strong, and tend to place well in competitions. It's still a very fun environment and in the 3 years I've been working there, I've seen almost no injuries. The only injuries that happen are when students get impatient and try things outside of their level or without an instructor's guidance.  There is a lot of scaffolding in our curriculum, and I think it's brilliantly done, assuming the students have the patience to stick with it. They don't attempt to climb until level 3 (three months in) and they don't attempt to invert until around level 5 (five months in).  In answer to your question, our ""Intermediate"" students are working on getting things like shoulder mounting, super man, etc.  Our ""Advanced"" students are typically working on getting their Ayesha, aerial invert, and straight edge type moves.   In Masters, our most advanced level, we are working on things like the Titanic, the Rainbow Marchenko, and advanced combos involving cup grip handsprings, etc.  When I first moved to the studio, I had almost 3 years of pole experience and was considered an advanced student in my studio in Maryland (which only had 5 levels and was much more ""gym"" oriented). At the time, I tested into level 8. I think there is a huge difference in levels and classifications across the country and world, but pole is still a relatively new sport! (As a side note, I am VERY glad I went into level 8 instead of Masters. I had a lot of bad habits and form issues that Jen beat out of me! I wouldn't have been able to advance much further with these habits. Form is important, guys!)  I started in 2009 and I remember seeing a handspring for the first time and thinking, that is the most advanced thing ever. That is some next level stuff right there! I would have never dreamed how far pole would come in just these past 5 years. I am so excited to see how it continues to advance!"

I've only done two levels.  Level one: spins (fireman, martini, stag, split, diamond) as well as tango turns, body rolls, thread the needle, etc. Half the class was conditioning.  So far in level two we've just started sitting and doing our spins one handed. Oh and the chair spin + diamond hook have been fun.   Our studio also does fitness, skills and choreography classes which can be neat.   Edit: level two also is half conditioning. I think all the levels are."

At my studio, we have (what is basically) an intro level, advanced beginner level, intermediate level, and advanced level. The intro level started with the basic fireman spin, but quickly moved you up to pole climbs and sits. I think the most difficult moves I did while taking the intro level classes were figurehead/hood ornament and CAR with one hand holding the crossed ankle. My advanced beginner classes have been a lot of side climb and inversion moves: jasmine variations, superman, cupid, jade, inside/outside leg switches, etc. My instructor has been pushing for me to start taking the intermediate classes for the past couple months, and my schedule just freed up this week for me to finally sign up. From what I've seen, the classes involve even more inverted tricks, shoulder mounts, aysha, brass monkey, possibly handsprings. The advanced level class is taken by most of the instructors."
poledancing,2maljh,jazzan,1 point,Fri Nov 14 19:10:24 2014 UTC,"Ours is linear progression based, with two branches, in five week series blocks. One branch is spins, transitions and floorwork, and the other is climbing, handstands and inverting. There is a year and a half of spins stuff and the inversion classes just continue on. You can't move up a series until you've completed the series before it. It's awesome for slow, consistent progression but it does require commitment."

Ikea has curtain hanger things that are just a sturdy wire that has metal clips all along it, you can install some of those on the ceiling/walls and either buy or make some sheer curtains that are easily light enough to be held up on the ceiling. That way you can section off the room if you don't want the pole to be the immediate focal point in the room. I would put an area next to it with a bunch of floor mats, pillows, blankets, other comfy things over there, and maybe a television or something. That way you could pull back the curtains and watch videos while you work out, but you could also leave the curtains closed and watch a movie with friends without your pole in obvious view. I would definitely put a mirror on the pole side of the curtains."

I think its more important to be the odd one out & comfortable rather than participate & be uncomfortable.    There's many different styles of pole ""dancing"" - sexual, athletic, circus, artistic, etc. Seems like you're more interested in the athletic type and that's a totally valid style of ""dancing"" too! Rather than trying to distinguish between pole ""dancing"" and pole ""fitness"" I think we are here to just celebrate everything that has to do with pole.  Talk to your teacher about your concerns, try another class, try another teacher, try another studio. And if that doesn't solve it just do your own thing. I started to not like the classes offered in my area so I just poled at home and it has really continued my love for pole. I don't understand what you're asking..."
poledancing,2m8s8p,Miffieee,2,Fri Nov 14 02:55:17 2014 UTC,"^ yes! Especially ""try a different teacher.""  There are maybe three of us who teach the intro class at my studio, and we all have VERY different styles. I'm lucky that our studio owner encourages us to develop our own teaching styles and she wants us to put our own personality on the classes we teach. She even allows us to pilot new classes, taking advantage of the unique styles the instructors have. I developed and teach a Contortion 101 class, another instructor teaches Burlesque, and another ""Power Pole"". We are lucky to have this freedom, but my point is that the styles are very very different, and none of us could teach each other's classes. I would be laughably bad at teaching Burlesque, and the Power Pole instructor couldn't teach Contortion at all. I think in general my classes have more stretching, the burlesque instructor uses a more classical dance style (she incorporates 8 counts), and the third intro instructor has a more urban/soul vibe.  You can check out most of the instructor profiles on our website to give you an idea of our individual style before you sign up for a class with us - check and see if your studio has this feature as well. Maybe there is an instructor with a gymnastics or fitness background that may be more enjoyable for you!  Even though three of us teach a class called ""Try Me Intro to Pole"" and even though the moves are roughly the same, the teaching style and execution are so different, it's almost like a different class.  And please don't let this turn you off to pole. Like /u/miffieee said, there are SO many styles to explore! If you stick with it, you may be surprised at how your style changes. I began with an athletic style, but now I've moved into a more circus-y attitude.  Understand that as instructors - especially at the introductory level - it's difficult for us to come up with an hour curriculum that will please everyone in the class. My personal goal is to make sure my students have fun, feel good about themselves, and get a little bit of a workout. Of course I'd like them to come back as well, but that's only a secondary goal. If I met the first goal, the second will naturally follow. Some students come to us because they want to learn how to be sexy, others just want a workout. Sometimes you even get the girls who were forced into it by a friend and who really don't want to be there at all! It's hard to please all sides of this spectrum.  Above all, don't give up! And keep us updated! Good luck! XOXOXO"

poledancing,2m8s8p,lentil5,1 point,Mon Nov 17 19:17:28 2014 UTC,"Hey, sorry for the late response! I got into contortion through pole, although I do have a gymnastics background.  I love the Fit and Bendy DVDs for a great intro to contortion stretching regiment. This is a good place to start. Also, check out a few books on the science of stretching. Education is always the most powerful thing you can do. Know the name of the muscle you are stretching and its counter muscle.  Also, [shameless self promotion] I write a monthly column about contortion in Pole2Pole Magazine. Each month you can find contortion related information there. Last month was Pro Stretching Tips from top competitors, this month I interviewed breathing experts on the importance of proper breathing for contortion (and how to do it!)  I think the best advice I could give to someone new to contortion is: be patient, respect your body. Be humble, there is always more to learn. Be vigilant, be persistent, and celebrate your successes.  Cold muscles don't stretch, always raise your core temperature before stretching! (My favorite time to stretch is after a good run.) Stretch every day. Do not miss a day! Some contortionists stretch for 1-3 hours a day, but even if you can only fit in 30 minutes a day you'll be better than most. Counter stretch. Build muscle to prevent injury (don't just stretch, incorporate strength training as well!) look up passive vs. active stretching, and dynamic vs. static stretching, and learn how to blend them. Recruit a partner.  Good luck, and keep us updated on your progress!"

Some classes will be just sort of dancing to a pole. Some will be straight up conditioning and strength and flexibility. Depends on the studio and what you're looking for.  2) Find a place/instructor that fits to your needs! Took me a while to find a place that kicks your ass the first 45 minutes then sort of relaxes to various spins and poses the last 15 mins.   3) Yoga, running, weight lifts?

I think that people often use the term ""pole fitness"" because there can be negative connotations with ""pole dancing"" (i.e. strippers). I think that it just comes down to the individual classes that you go to and how they like to do things.  The first studio I went to, it was very much on-the-pole, doing spins and climbs and not a lot else. The one I go to now also includes a lot more tricks, as well as of off-the-pole strength exercises, like doing headstands, so this class feels more focused towards fitness than just spinning around.  Try going to other classes in your area if you can, but what you've described doesn't sound like how a pole class should be. If you're not comfortable then you shouldn't go to that one."

A lot of pole dance includes floorwork and off-the-pole dancing as well, so there's definitely room for belly dancing around the pole.  I would think about maybe doing some belly dance near to/holding the pole, maybe adding in some pole slides, then transitioning with a spin, maybe moving to the other side of the pole for more belly dance-type moves.  You could find positions on the pole that you could hold while incorporating belly dance perhaps? Can you climb? Are you able to sit on the pole? Maybe an inverted crucifix would work?

The pole should end up in your ""pocket"" (the area directly between the lowest rib and the top of the pelvis), so if you have your hips pressed up against the pole as you bend down you won't hit the right spot. The pole should not be pressed against your hip bone. Secondly, bend over quite a bit before putting your arm around the pole. This serves to help you extend your back leg more horizontally because your upper body will be a bit more horizontal. You'll still need to squeeze the crap out of that gluteus to help extend that leg higher though. And finally, when you put the top arm around the pole, pull the elbow down as far as you can get it. Think super bent elbow as close to the body as you can. This will get the upper arm horizontal so when you straighten it out the whole arm will be horizontal as well."

poledancing,2lsr3m,mlg1972,2,Sun Nov 9 21:58:00 2014 UTC,I would start with competitions in your area first. There are quite a few in the uk.   Does you pole class do routine classes as I find they're useful. Also its worth practicing combos trying out if moves flow well together. I watch routines as well for inspiration  Also another tip is only put moves in the routine that your confident in doing. A routine isn't about putting difficult moves in your routine but its about fluidity and entertainment
poledancing,2lq63n,kemirea,3,Sun Nov 9 01:56:45 2014 UTC,"I've personally never had issues with this (I always practice with my hair up, and I've only ever performed as a short-haired character).  However, I've definitely noticed it in some of the videos I watch.  Specifically, I remember noticing that Anastasia Shukhtorova tends to get her hair in her face a lot (because it's long and silky and I'm so jealous of it).  Looking through her stuff I realize that she (perhaps subconsciously?) choreographs in a lot of hair-flips to get it out of her face (you can see one at about 2:15 in the video).  When I do want my hair long but definitely out of the way, I'm a personal fan of...I can't for the life of me find a picture of this thing (it's one of the default hair options in Skyrim).  It's basically the front hair is braided down the back in two braids, with the rest of the hair still free/down.  Works best if you don't have bangs, or are like me and have bangs that are in the process of being grown out.  Take the top 1/3 of your hair, part it down the middle.  Make two braids, french braid if you want more security (for bangs not falling out).  If you don't want the ""braided down the back"" look, you can just french-braid until you run out of new hair to grab and then tie it into tails (so like pigtails, but on the back of your head).  Although both of these still give the ""pulled back"" look for the bangs, so not sure what to suggest if you don't want that look."
poledancing,2lq63n,ZeldaPoleart,1 point,Sun Nov 9 04:02:39 2014 UTC,"I've french braided my hair for some performances before, and some went better than others. I think part of the problem may be that I have very layered hair and bangs as well, so some bits always slip out. Anastasia does get her hair in her face, but I don't know if I would've noticed it if you hadn't pointed it out. So maybe it's more of a nuisance to the performer than the viewers."

poledancing,2lq63n,TianaYeesha,3,Sun Nov 9 20:37:49 2014 UTC,"My hair is quite long and love to dance with it while it's open and free. Practice makes perfect, when I first started I tended to get the hair everywhere and slip on it (while doing a leaning arch on the floor... xD), but it really does get better with time. Hairflicks help a lot too. And I think not getting it in the face gets easier, the longer it gets (mine tends to stay behind my back most oft the time).   So, as with everything: it really does get better with time, when you teach yourself all those little head movements to get it out of everything. :)  Just doing floorwork with your hair down can be a really good practice too, because there are a lot of moves, where you really get it in your face... xD   For practice and learning new tricks I prefer to put it in a bun or braid (best method: braided bun with hairsticks, so I can just pull the sticks out when the bun gets in the way, like for a headstand), so I don't have to worry about where my hair is all the time. ;)  If I want to flip my hair around without getting it everywhere, I like to do a bun with a bit of hair hanging out of it. Makes it a lot shorter and keeps it out of the face. It's basically a knot in the hair and stays put when I put one or two hairsticks in it. Or, just ja short braid, like braiding 1/3 of the length and leave the rest flowing around.  ETA: Oh, I totally forgot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPQtqvosVtk Pink Puma, my biggest role model for dancing with long hair (she opens the bun at around 1:42)... <3"

poledancing,2lq63n,Miffieee,3,Sun Nov 9 20:23:59 2014 UTC,"You can definitely manage long hair while dancing, and quite easily too.    hair flicks (the fast your flick, the more your heavy long hair moves out of your face) when hair flicking, use your chin! Exaggerate the movement by moving with your chin if you do a slow hair flick, you can still get your hair out of your face by raising your chin up up up at the end use your forearm to brush hair out of your face (forearm sweeps over your head and down your neck) use your fingers and run it from forehead to hair ends, make it pretty too! do pirouettes/swoops/etc as in-between moves, the fast movement should get hair flowing.  notice and control the distance between the pole & your head.

It's about creating the necessary angles between your hips and arms so you can balance. Your body needs to be far away from the pole to be able to get that counter-balance.

I emailed asking if I could attend, and the instructor asked the girls if it was ok beforehand. The first few lessons I probably felt more uncomfortable than they did, as I was desperately trying to give off ""I'm here to work, not perv"" vibes!   They have all been really accepting of me though, and it wasn't long before we were helping (or jovially laughing at) each other. In fact I have a rep now for pushing folk to just keep trying to nail a move.   I have however found that most of the classes is tried to attend before were women only. The instructors would offer private lessons instead, but £40 a session is not in my budget!   I hope you can find a co-ed class, it's really so much fun and a great way to keep fit and build strength."

poledancing,2le694,omicronpersei69,1 point,Thu Nov 6 03:55:06 2014 UTC,I've seen your post on the bodyweight sub. You're pretty skilled already so honestly most studios would be glad to have you since you would pick up techniques quick. I'm nowhere near your level and I was skipped to intermediate after my first class. You could probably take the advanced class at vertitude that was mentioned by another poster.  Aside from seeing if pole studios have coed options. See if there's a circus arts school in your area. Mine has pole dance and Chinese pole options. On top of silks and rings. I'm in New York though.

poledancing,2le694,jeengurr,1 point,Thu Nov 6 16:57:07 2014 UTC,"There's actually a male instructor at the studio I teach at. He's more 'acro-oriented' than dance/fluidity oriented, but he started out in regular classes like the rest of us. We also have a few regular men in higher level classes, which is where they typically start out due to the inherent strength they already have. I would definitely recommend just getting in touch with the studio you're interested in and give them a good idea of where you are with strength and flexibility. Typically, more advanced students are totally comfortable with males being in class with them."
poledancing,2le694,marithim,1 point,Thu Nov 6 17:55:01 2014 UTC,"Partially commenting to say that it is a tricky subject. I know that my studio is female only, but they advertise as a private women's fitness studio. I've heard of some studios in LA that are co-ed, but I also know that it's crazy expensive down there. The owner of my studio took some sessions down in LA when she started and she couldn't keep affording it, it was so pricy.   I would say, since a lot of the beginner classes seem to be female only from what I hear, is to see about trying to find a pole. A good pole is around 300 if you want it to be spinning as well as static. Cheaper for Static only. Classes are obviously preferable, but if you can't spend 30-50 a class (which is what I hear it can be), your own pole and online sessions are very helpful. I personally supplement my classes (1x a week as it is a small fitness studio and doesn't just do pole) with my pole at home and Studio Veena lessons. www.studioveena.com. She's very good with her videos and has a very active discussion forum. She has a three day trial subscription, and she does it by month or by year. I personally paid during a sale so I only paid $79 for the year. Usually it's $99. But it can be really helpful when I'm at home and I forget how to do a move, or learning another way to do the same move.   Good luck! And I'm actually quite excited to see your interest. I've been following a lot of your bodyweight routines (especially the weak wrist ones) to  help supplement my poling and my excusrions into aerial hoop. And your flexi stuff that I can't seem to keep on track for (sorry!!)  edit: Also if your friends are taking classes, chances are one of them may have already bought a pole. Perhaps you can ask them if they could teach you the basic spins and sits on their pole so you get a beginner feel."

poledancing,2l7m8e,shiftcommathree,2,Tue Nov 4 00:20:12 2014 UTC,Looks great! I'd love to get to get this someday. How long have you been specifically working toward the Iron X? Any tips or training suggestions?
poledancing,2l7m8e,Parfaite,6,Tue Nov 4 04:45:21 2014 UTC,"I have had my ayesha for I think over a year, but I only started turning it towards an iron x this past month or so. Honestly, everyone tells you to go into ayesha and twist as far as you can without falling, and then bring it back up. But I just fell out of it every fucking time, the moment I started twisting. There was no way what would effectively be taking my legs off the pole and putting them right back on was going to help me at all!   Then an instructor at my studio told me to first move my hips as far away from the pole as possible, THEN start turning. She said if I think I've drawn back far enough, I need to go two inches lower. I immediately started seeing improvements--in order to get that low, I had to let my hooked elbow arm out a bit, making the angle between my humerus & forearm closer to 90. I also turned my wrist so that my hand was no longer curled up palm towards me, but palm towards the sky. But I still fell out of it about halfway down. Never once in my life have I gone any percentage of the way down and then come back up to prepare for my iron x.  Then, one fateful day, I was still dropping out halfway through, and I went to go do some pike handstands against a wall. For the first time, I did them with access to a mirror, and realized the angle I was making with my legs was nowhere near 90. So I tried to put it down to 90. Shit was HARD! I was engaging my hamstrings, my lower core, my shoulders more---everything was squeezing tight, fighting from collapsing out of the pike handstand. I did a few reps. Then I tackled the pole again and really focused on piking the fuck out of my legs, just like I had done in the handstand.   BAM all the way down for the first time ever--AND held it!! Turn down your volume, celebrations at the end haha :)"

poledancing,2l7m8e,polymanwhore,2,Tue Nov 11 03:36:20 2014 UTC,"When training for the iron x, you need to train for the ayesha first. Once you have a strong ayesha then you can start twisting you body to the side slowly and when you feel like falling then go back to your ayesha. Doing this trains your core for the iron x. Each time I tried I started getting closer and closer to my iron x"

I'm a guy and still beginner (started pole only 10 months ago) with no flexibility at all!   Height: 72 inches (1m83)  Wingspan: 75 inches (1m90)  Time to first invert: 0 (first try, first day, like most guys)  Preference towards strength or flexibility moves? strength (by lack of flexibility)  Grip preferences: I do prefer cup/double cup by far, I can't stand using any twisted grip. I'm not using a lot of elbow grip yet to rank it.  Additional notes: I can't do an Iron-X or a flag and I'm nowhere close to it, I already know that with my size and wingspan it will be a lot of work.

poledancing,2ksg5g,makasha,2,Tue Nov 4 23:54:10 2014 UTC,"YES! Most of the movements we are asked to do in pole classes are not what we'd consider ""natural"" movements. It is totally normal to feel awkward for your first few classes until you are more familiar with the movements.   Think back to when you first tried to walk in heels. You were off balance and probably looked a bit like a baby colt. That is because you had not yet learned where to put your weight and how to move your body comfortably. I bet now you can even jog a bit without missing a step!   There is a bit of a learning curve, but stick with it and it'll become easier! Having a sense of humor about it helps a great deal. I teach an intro class for spinning pole and when my girls get frustrated we always take a quick silly break to prevent negative thoughts.   Never say you ""can't"" just think ""not yet""!"

It's something I've just started working on, but that tutorial came to mind since I don't have my shoulder mount down yet either.  A couple other moves I've found useful for getting accustomed to thigh-grippy type holds like titanic are the butt superman and flying V.  Maybe work those as a stepping stone?  That's my plan, anyway.  Still don't know if it'll work yet :)"
poledancing,2kk93a,APacman,5,Tue Oct 28 12:26:44 2014 UTC,"I had this problem too, pole sits were mentally impossible for me and everyone in my class seemed ok with them. All I can say is ""it does get better"", i'm about 7 months in and pole sits are now tolerable, I can do a figure 4 layback, but not a straight leg one it's a work in progress. For months I would challenge myself to hold at least 3 sits for 10 seconds at the end of my practice in hopes of getting used to them.  I'm currently working on elbow holds. Pole is a slow quest to desensitize your skin to pain."

poledancing,2kk93a,rinakrack,2,Tue Oct 28 17:43:23 2014 UTC,"They definitely help, especially if you practice tilting around and stressing the poor inner thigh in different ways. For me laybacks are partially a fear thing, like the pain works into the fear and although I could probably do it physically I just let the fear + pain mix together into a shitty failure cocktail. I had the same thing happen with superman, but did eventually get over it. It'll get better. I was convinced everyone was lying to me when they said it would get better cause it took so long for me. But it eventually does. Super strong pinky swear. Just keep at it."

poledancing,2ka8gl,CeciliePrintz,2,Mon Nov 17 05:46:19 2014 UTC,"I didn't even know you could get silicone poles. That's awesome. What's different with this one compared to.. for instance chrome? I could imagine that the grip would be better, but how about bruises etc.?"
poledancing,2ka8gl,Mystic_Wolf,3,Sat Oct 25 18:48:42 2014 UTC,"I don't know if they're available in the US or elsewhere yet cause we somehow tend to get finishes first in Australia (go figure).   They are a 45mm chrome/SS (not sure which) pole wrapped in silicone, they only come in 48mm. However, you absolutely do not notice that they're slightly thicker because of the extra grip. They are super, super grippy. It's not even comparable to a metal pole. I've been on brass on days I was so tacky I actually took off skin, but this is a different feel entirely. Wearing pants was really scary because they were so much grip and I couldn't list loosen off to slide down. Hence the first bit is me just like, ""how the hell do I get down without sliding?!""   Bruising really depends on what you're brushing from. Is it from hitting the pole to hard? Then less. I can do jumps onto the silicone without bruising because of the padding. Is it from falling into a move and pulling at your skin? Much, much worse. This type of bruising will get worse as your grip gets better. General bruising from gripping the pole? Possibly slightly worse but it's hard for me to tell having only used it once.   As I said in the comments on the video this is a great conditioning tool, but not a substitute for a metal pole. I bought it for conditioning and to work on strength, so I'm really happy. This is a pole you can move to on days you're too sweaty to be productive or on days it's too cold to take off your leggings. It isn't something you can work on general flow and dancing on if that's what you're into though.   Afterwards (straight away plus the next day) I felt it a lot in muscles it's usually hard for me to train because I can't trust my slippery hands. It might seem counterproductive to train on something with ridiculous grip because intuition might say that you need to learn to go it on the metal pole. However, in my experience if you can practice the move and build strength you'll get better on both. Because the pole is thicker your trip strength will improve. Many beginners thing sweaty hands is a problem because of sweat, but it's also about strength. As my grip strength improves I can do more and more even with sweaty hands cause I'm strong enough to counteract it. I expect thicker and more grippy pole will really help.   So basically don't get this instead of a chrome (or whatever your finish of choice is) pole, get it as well as one. The only time I'd suggest getting this for home instead of a metal pole rather than as a second pole is if you're super happy with your access to practice time at a studio or you only want to work on strength and movements at home."
poledancing,2ka8gl,Mystic_Wolf,1 point,Sat Oct 25 19:48:54 2014 UTC,Thanks for this! I'm looking at getting a pole and I'm really torn between chrome and silicone. I'm sometimes so sweaty that I slide right off the brass poles in my dance classes. Are there things that you can't do on silicone that you can do on chrome?
poledancing,2ka8gl,marithim,2,Wed Oct 29 00:14:59 2014 UTC,"The most simple answer: Dance and static spins.   I'm sure there are people who find they don't mind dancing on the super grippiness but I never could.   I find it too grippy to dance in the same way you would on a metal pole. It's way too grippy to do any static spins on. It's almost impossible to slide on it at all in clothing but kind of possible in shorts.   I think the decision will have to come down to what you want it for. Do you want to train your strength up at home? Or do you want to practice moves in a similar environment?   As a fellow sweatater let me give you some advice if you choose a metal pole: Do not get chrome! I had a chrome pole originally and i sold it to buy a TG.   How long have you been poling? If you're fairly new to it then you've got two things working against you: Sweaty hands and lack of grip strength. Swear gets easier to deal with both because you leave which grip aids work for you but also because you get stronger. The stronger your grip the more sweat you can have before it begins to effect you. Sounds weird to some beginners, but it's absolutely true. You need to build your strength up, but you can't do this if you can't even hold on to the pole without slipping to help build it! This is why I don't recommend chrome to sweaty beginners. I had much better grip on brass or TG and found that after a while I went to use a chrome pole and I could do most everything on it because I had built up the strength. This applies even more so with the silicone. I'm building strength in muscles (as well as grip strength) by doing extended butterfly on the silicone pole but I can't do this on a metal pole yet. Everything is easier, but I find my muscles get a much better workout.   Which brings us back to our first question, what do you want to focus on at home? If you want to worn on strength and conditioning at home and want to work on the mechanics of tricks knowing full well they'll be a lot harder on a metal pole then go the silicone. If you want to recreate the studio/dance environment for practice at home then go metal."
poledancing,2ka8gl,TraumaBunny,1 point,Thu Oct 30 12:11:14 2014 UTC,"Thank you! I decided that what I really wanted was to work on strength and individual tricks more easily (I took up pole to work on strength anyway), so I've gone with a silicone pole. Very helpful advice!"

poledancing,2k8709,hound_and_fury,8,Fri Oct 24 20:04:51 2014 UTC,"I practiced doing them against a wall first then slowly lifting my legs away from the wall.  I could only hold it for a second if even that when I started but as I did it more often I started doing it on my own but close enough to the wall in case I fell backwards  Now I dont use the wall at all and can control mu handstand better. You dont need to be able to get into it straight away, I found it easy this way"
poledancing,2k8709,myweelamb,3,Fri Oct 24 20:38:54 2014 UTC,"I suggest that you practice the ""float"" with a wall behind you. It's a great way to help alleviate the anxiety some feel regarding handstands. Place your hands about 6-8"" away from the wall, shoulder width apart, with the pointer finger forward. Your palms should be flat on the ground and fingers rounded slightly (like a claw gripping the ground). Lift one leg up and straight, push off the ground with the other leg. As soon as your foot leaves the ground you should be pressing through your shoulders and lats (think shoulders to ears, which we never do aside from handstands). Work on kicking up high enough to ""float"" at the top for a hot second. Leave the leg you pushed with still pointed towards the ground for comfort. Once the float feels comfortable and not scary at all you can work on bringing the pushing leg up with the other one at the top of the float as well as pushing up hard enough to put your butt on the wall. When you are confident with this you can try it with the pole behind you instead of the wall. Always remember, push push push! A great exercise once you're getting your butt to the wall and are holding the handstand is to do shoulder presses. Try lifting yourself up a few inches higher with your shoulders, pressing up then back down, aim for reps of 6. I hope this helps!"
poledancing,2k8709,Reyalla508,2,Sat Oct 25 01:55:30 2014 UTC,Thanks so much for these details! I will work on trying it this way.
poledancing,2k8709,SunLovesCupcake,1 point,Sat Oct 25 02:48:58 2014 UTC,"I second u/myweelamb, I learned handstands against a wall first. You ultimately want to be just lifting your legs up into a handstand, rather than kicking into it, because then you learn how to balance better and when you move away from the wall, you won't have to deal with the excess momentum while getting your balance."
poledancing,2k8709,iheartlungs,1 point,Sun Oct 26 03:33:35 2014 UTC,"Iif you have a buddy you can practice with its even better than a wall, you kick up to them and then they can coach you about where you are going wrong. Whats great is once you are up there, they can gently hold your ankles and slowly remove their hands so you have the chance to try balance alone. If kickign up is your issue, which it was for me, try going in with your bbody bent at 90 degrees first - for some reason, this worked for me rather than cartwheeling in from standing up straight!"
poledancing,2k8fsq,CinematicKarma,2,Fri Oct 24 21:25:17 2014 UTC,"Nah, it's less common, but I've seen it a couple times as an instructor. You can try a stopgap measure of making sure your hands aren't too dry and you don't have too many calluses, but the biggest thing is going to be training your grip so that you're more in control of how tight you're holding the pole. Soooo... Practice, is all."
poledancing,2k8fsq,PoemanBird,1 point,Fri Oct 24 22:16:57 2014 UTC,Yeah I am having that problem at the moment. I'm just starting though so I hope I'll be able to regulate my grip with more practise. At the moment even just walking around the pole leaves it rubbing against my wrist as it rolls down my hand. I'm also having troubles sliding down.
poledancing,2k8fsq,in_essence,1 point,Mon Nov 10 13:33:13 2014 UTC,A lot of people tell me it's my grip. That I am holding on too tight from fear but I have the same problem with my shins and knees sticking. It's like I have to much friction with the pole. I have found a tiny dab of lotion helps me out. I am still new though so we will see how it goes. Good luck on your pole adventures
poledancing,2k7mg3,rinakrack,6,Fri Oct 24 17:04:05 2014 UTC,"This is very common. It's difficult to have strength and flexibility in the same spot. It can be done with a lot of effort though. Once in a stretching class the teacher told me I could make up for my lack if shoulder flexibility with really open hip flexors (for back flexibility, this doesn't apply to everything) so i work on that a lot.   I like to use a yoga strap, hold it out in front with both hands. Try to lift up and over rotation your shoulders as you take it behind you. Try to move your hands closer and closer together. Also stand facing a wall, put your hands on the wall above your head and try to get your chest/armpits pressed against the wall. Walk your hands further and further down. Another good one is backbend with your chest against the wall and try to press through your armpits keeping them as pressed to the wall as you can.   And be careful with that old injury! They can haunt you!"

poledancing,2k7mg3,Megan_Joan,1 point,Fri Oct 24 18:53:06 2014 UTC,"As already said it's hard to have both. When you lengthen a muscle it becomes weaker, as you strengthen it again it gets shorter and less flexy. This is why being strong AND flexy is so impressive.  Personally, I work on both concurrently. I am slowly getting more flexible through my shoulders while getting stronger at the same time. I simply don't neglect my should stretches. The wall one is great. I also like to work on handstands that stretch out my back and shoulders.   It is possible to work on both at the same time, but progress on both will be slower. So it's a matter of deciding what works for you and what you need for your particular pole style. :)"

The biggest hassle for me when I tried to move my pole into a smaller room upstairs were my ceiling fan and my ceiling joyces. If I had it properly positioned on a joyce, then it was too close to the ceiling fan. It ended up not working out in that room :( Now it's downstairs in a highly visible area, but I have plenty of room at least and guests (the guy into fix our AC, my friends parents, etc.) usually don't comment.   I would definitely recommend getting a pole for home to work on the things that you're mentioning. I got one for home because I wasn't getting enough privacy at the studio to let myself go and really work out expressing myself through dance. Now that I don't go to a studio anymore (for a number of reasons) I'm on it 4 or 5 nights a week. It'll change how you dance : )"
poledancing,2k3w64,BreesusisMagic,1 point,Thu Oct 23 17:13:10 2014 UTC,"Ah, I never would have thought of the ceiling/fan issue! I am planning to put it in my bedroom, and there is indeed a fan in there. I will be sure to double check!  I've very encouraged to hear that you are using the pole so frequently during the week, and that you are finally learning to express yourself! I also find that I'm having trouble finding my style/flow in class. Perhaps working on it at home will be the key!  Thank you for all the awesome advice and encouragement :)"
poledancing,2k3w64,ilikedessert,2,Thu Oct 23 18:06:08 2014 UTC,I had mine in a small space back when I was competing. It was only 8 feet high and i could touch the walls with my toes easily. But it was very helpful to have at that time. It would be harder for me to practice in that space now as my combos are much more complicated and need a lot of height. But when i was at a lower level it was extremely helpful. Sometimes you just need the privacy of your own home to work the way you need to without interruptions.  I took the ceiling light down when I had my pole up and just used lamps and took all the furniture out of the room. It worked pretty well.
poledancing,2k3w64,RacingHumanBeans,2,Thu Oct 23 18:21:43 2014 UTC,"I have a pretty small space to work with - I can touch the walls on either side and am only 5 foot tall- but since there are no classes in my area it's all I have used to learn and it's definitely worth it. Just modify any moves that you would need more room to do. (also, if you usually wear heels it's better not to in a small space for obvious reasons). You won't be able to do much for floor work or for powerful combos but for tweaking and perfecting inverts and poses it's still good (minus some of the flexi ones if youd end up kicking walls). BASICALLY a small area should work if you are a beginner-intermediate level."

poledancing,2k2oct,charlucapants,7,Thu Oct 23 06:15:01 2014 UTC,"i don't know if there are any lifts that specifically helped on pole, because i felt that pole was already such a good arm/back workout i mostly focused on legs at the gym to balance it out.  however, i would think squats/deadlifts as your workout to build strength for pole is not really helpful because you don't need as much leg strength. i did a lot of pullups, chin ups, lat pulldowns, chest press, bicep curls, tricep dips to gain strength in my upper body and that really helped with pole. but nowadays, i pole 2-3 times a week for 2-3 hours at a time so i don't work out my upper body at the gym anymore because you need to give your muscles a break too!"
poledancing,2k2oct,h0l,5,Thu Oct 23 06:54:47 2014 UTC,I did lots of pull ups and chin ups and basically built my biceps up as I didn't have a whole lot of substantial upper body strength. I thought I had a semi strong core when I started but I was proved wrong so I've started working on getting it super hard :)
poledancing,2k2oct,potttaaattoooo,3,Thu Oct 23 06:57:32 2014 UTC,"lat pulldowns, overhead presses, and basically anything that works your deltoids and trapezius muscles (because shoulder injuries are pretty common with pole). For non-weight related exercises, planks for core and pushups (arms&core) are great because you're working against your own weight which is exactly what you do with pole. (I personally try to work on my leg muscles more simply because I have always had better arm strength in comparison to my legs but apparently most girls are opposite of that.)"
poledancing,2k2oct,RacingHumanBeans,3,Thu Oct 23 07:37:08 2014 UTC,"A full body three day split with weights. As another comment said, strengthening shoulders is a great idea as those injuries are so common. Anything that gets your core stronger, pull-ups, all of it! Balancing out your muscles will only help your pole dancing, make you stronger and less likely to be injured. Pole can create muscle imbalances. Once I started cross training with weights it helped me with my pole and aerial sooooo much!  I work out at home with a program called x train. I love it!"
poledancing,2k2oct,ilikedessert,2,Thu Oct 23 15:23:58 2014 UTC,"Literally everything.  Shoulders (lats, traps, delts) are huge for me because I've got hypermobile shoulders and the extra muscle helps stabilize them.  Forearm work, grip work, and curls of various types have helped a lot.  Honestly, I'd say what's helped the most has been the shoulder and accessory work up there.  Presses, push presses, lateral raises, etc.  But, anything that builds strength in an area you don't currently have strength or enough strength is good.  I'd say to look at what you're struggling with for pole and find exercises that boost that."
poledancing,2k2oct,pantherchild,2,Thu Oct 23 12:04:19 2014 UTC,"I lift in between pole classes. I never do pole and then lift on consecutive days. I believe there should be a day of rest in between. With that being said, I do bent over rows, lots of core so various types of sit ups. Anything to work your back and lats as well. My biceps get lots of work on pole, but my triceps and pectoral muscles not so much so I always make sure to work the those in the gym.   Mostly three sets of 10 reps each of each exercise. Planks sometimes while I'm resting between sets working non-ab muscles (I recommend 1-2 minutes rest between sets). If I'm moving up in my weight I make sure I can do at least 8 reps. If I can't even do 8... I'm lifting too much.   Last random thing I find important: get a full range of motion in your movements while you lift and make your movements slow and controlled.  Sometimes if something doesn't feel heavy enough, I just slow my movements and everything gets a lot more challenging! It helps work all the little muscles and really does a great job strengthen your muscle groups if you go slow. All those people you see lifting who are rapidly and aggressively pumping out several sets in quick succession? Don't do that!  I'm sorry I couldn't give more specific lifts. My vocabulary is poor with weight lifting. But I hope the other tips help!"
poledancing,2k08br,RadioPixie,10,Wed Oct 22 16:35:22 2014 UTC,"Yay! I'm excited for you!  Okay, for a total newbie, you can just wear a tank top + athletic shorts for your first lesson. When you start doing more advanced moves, you might have to wear crop tops or hotpants to get enough grip on the pole, but for beginners you don't really need that much skin for grip, just your hands + legs :) You will probably be learning some basic spins and climbs for your first couple of lessons. Beginner moves don't take much strength so don't worry if you haven't been working out much before, you will build up strength as you pole. Classes start with stretching and a warmup, so make sure you're not late so you can stretch properly!   btw are you learning on static or spin?"
poledancing,2k08br,h0l,8,Wed Oct 22 16:43:31 2014 UTC,"Try not to use any creams or lotions before the class as it might make it harder for you to grip.  I'm not an athlete either (not flexible nor strong :P) but pole has made me a little bit more of both those things. It's important to remember that you're just starting out! Don't have too many expectations, just have fun! Keep trying and don't get too discouraged if you don't stick a move the first time. People who have been doing this for ages make it look easy, but it's not.  And most of all, not matter how hard or discouraging the class is, keep going to classes! Even if you don't get a single move down, it's still a great workout. And eventually, you'll get there!"
poledancing,2k08br,thisisbelinda,4,Wed Oct 22 20:43:11 2014 UTC,"Remember, everyone starts somewhere, and everyone else in the class will be doing the same moves as you. I've found the people in my pole classes (as well as heard of others on here) are some of the most supportive, encouraging people I've ever met. You will meet people from all walks of life. Have fun with it!"
poledancing,2k08br,Wisix,4,Wed Oct 22 16:58:34 2014 UTC,A pair of shorts and a tshirt or tank top will be sufficient. I would imagine your first class would just be trying out basic spins  So excited for you. Enjoy the class and have fun
poledancing,2k08br,myweelamb,3,Wed Oct 22 20:22:53 2014 UTC,"You go to the gym/fitness classes to get in shape, not because you're in shape (although the fit are welcome, too, of course). That would be silly if you had to be in shape to get in shape. You'll be fine. Don't wear lotion and don't be afraid to look stupid:)"
poledancing,2k08br,purple_potatoes,3,Thu Oct 23 00:28:47 2014 UTC,"Someone else said it, but I'll say it again: don't wear lotion.  I saw a lot of girls get frustrated because they weren't staying on the pole and couldn't do much.  It's the lotion.    Also, just let yourself have fun.  I was apprehensive about my first lesson too, but I had a great time.  I bet you will too!"
poledancing,2k08br,lsjess616,2,Thu Oct 23 01:03:31 2014 UTC,"Dont expect to be amazing your first time. If you get a move then you get it. If you dont.....dont beat yourself up over it :) the less clothes you wear, the more you can stick to the pole. So shorter shorts and a tank top work. Also lotion is a no no lol Bring water!! And most importantly..... have fun!! :D"
poledancing,2k08br,Eionyx,2,Wed Oct 22 20:55:09 2014 UTC,"Remember that everyone had to start at square one (or square zero in my case!). I couldn't even get my feet off the ground in my spins the first time I went to class. If we all started out perfect, there would be no need to practice. :)  I recommend wearing a close-fitting tshirt or tank top and shorts to your first class. Bear in mind that you'll eventually need exposed skin to maintain a good grip on the pole, but you'll have plenty of time to get used to the idea.   Most importantly - HAVE FUN. Don't stress over what you can and can't do. This is the best exercise that I've done in YEARS. Have the Motrin on hand tomorrow. GOOD LUCK! :)"
poledancing,2k08br,dancingelf1988,1 point,Thu Oct 23 00:44:51 2014 UTC,"Stretch, drink plenty of water during class, LISTEN TO YOUR BODY - don't push yourself to get into a move that you might not be strong enough or flexible enough to do yet bc you will hurt yourself.   And as others have said, don't wear oil or lotion prior to class. Wipe down your pole with the alcohol and hand towels your studio should provide. Have fun!!"
poledancing,2jzcck,rollll,3,Wed Oct 22 10:42:10 2014 UTC,"My first class, I couldn't get a single move I was taught. Not one! It probably took me three classes to get anything at all. I've been taking regular classes for about six months and new moves still take me a few weeks to get. Everyone learns at a different pace!  As far as bruises go, they don't stop. You sort of callous over in places and won't bruise there any longer, but then you'll learn a new move and bruise elsewhere. lol aloe and arnica gel are supposed to be very helpful in treating them!"
poledancing,2jzcck,stelur,3,Wed Oct 22 14:52:55 2014 UTC,"Some moves came easily, some took forever to figure out. There are still certain spins that I first learned a month ago and I can't do them. Some moves up on the pole I kind of sort of get, but I'm not strong enough to hold them for a reasonable time (yet). I don't have a pole at home (or know anyone who does), so I can only practice in class. Some people in my classes have been poling for a year or two and still bruise."
poledancing,2jzcck,Wisix,3,Wed Oct 22 13:59:01 2014 UTC,"Some of them, like the back hook spin, I got right away. Climbing took me forever! I came in once a week between classes for three hours just to practice my climb, and I couldn't get past the initial hike. This carried on for a couple of months, and I was getting so frustrated! I gave up for a bit, and then one day during a pole conditioning class, one of our tasks was to do a series of climbs. My stomach dropped, but I thought, ""At least try,"" and for some reason I made it all the way up to the ceiling then. I got so excited I almost fell off the pole haha"
poledancing,2jzcck,bnlawrence,2,Wed Oct 22 17:30:03 2014 UTC,"I've just looked at my pictures and it took me 5 months to invert well enough to want a picture of it. My first leg hook 2 was a week later. Five months!!! I was in level 3 before I could even invert properly without a spotter. But yeah I was totally useless for about 6 months probably. And now that I teach pole, I see ladies making very little progress week on week but then suddenly its like something clicks and they just 'get' it...and then they are amazing!  Don't worry your skin gets tougher as your muscles get stronger and you won't bruise as much after about 2 months of it :)"
poledancing,2jzcck,iheartlungs,1 point,Wed Oct 22 16:42:17 2014 UTC,I think its so weird how it will just click after a while but hey I'm not complaining
poledancing,2jzcck,myweelamb,2,Wed Oct 22 20:07:29 2014 UTC,Dont worry about it. I struggled when I started. Also remember that each person us different. Ive been poling for just over 2 years and still can do moves that someone who has beem poling for a year can do  You'll be building strength as you go and you will get it. Dont rush things as you can injure yourself  The bruises or pole kisses come with any move you do
poledancing,2jzcck,horseniss,2,Wed Oct 22 20:27:23 2014 UTC,"It took me like 3 weeks to realize I had to use momentum to be able to do my basic spins. Then after that it took another 3 weeks to fully understand what was required of me to do a push pull grip. I'm still a newbie, but I have found eventually you just get the muscle memory for it!  my studio also offers a ""pole skills"" class which is essentially an hour to practice whatever you like and get specific instructor feedback while you do it. I've found it to be extremely helpful!"
poledancing,2jzcck,uberalice,2,Thu Oct 23 12:37:26 2014 UTC,"Don't compare yourself with others!

On the same time, I have read about people that it takes more than half a year to nail it.   Everyone have different grounds that they're starting from. Do whatever feels good to you, in YOUR OWN pace!"

E-mail studios even if they say they don't allow men, a lot of times they know other places who do or they have non-advertised mixed or men only classes. Be persistent and keep checking back, policies change and all it takes is inquiry.   Good luck!"
poledancing,2jz3ik,uargvak,5,Wed Oct 22 12:52:24 2014 UTC,Talk to the studio owner if possible. We just started offering mixed classes because she had simply never thought of it. I've had a few coworkers join me since and really love it. As well some of the advanced girls bring their SO just to kick their butts. We simply omit the sexy choreography
poledancing,2jz3ik,nerdy_canadian,4,Wed Oct 22 18:58:38 2014 UTC,Ours welcomes men too! Its just there arnet many willing to give it a try. Its a shame really the ones ive seen do so well!
poledancing,2jz3ik,amy831,3,Wed Oct 22 09:15:04 2014 UTC,"Our studio welcomes men, but they usually take private classes because it's a much different course than it is for women. You could always inquire about private lessons if all else fails?"
poledancing,2jz3ik,lavenderglitter,3,Wed Oct 22 19:01:23 2014 UTC,There are a few options. You could inquire about if they'd be willing to do private lessons and you could also pitch the idea of a men's only class if you can find a few other guys to commit to going.  You may even be able to get them to find a class slot for you where all the girls are okay with having a guy in the class.
poledancing,2jz3ik,MinionOfDoom,3,Thu Oct 23 04:48:33 2014 UTC,"So, this is a majority-women activity, and if you look in the posts in this community, you can see how self conscious and worried women often are when they start. A women-only space really helps with that. And just think of what it's like in partner dance classes where men go just to talk to/dance with/pick up women, and imagine what people are worried it will be like if it's a mixed pole dancing class.    However, by the time you get to intermediate stage, people are usually pretty comfortable with what they do and quite happy to whip off their tshirt and wander around in just their bra and shorts - even if there are men around, so long as they're respectful about it and part of the group (i.e. also complaining about their foot bruises :P).   The way it works in my studio is basically men are allowed in the higher level classes only. They have to take private lessons until that point, but usually it only takes a handful to get up to speed because you usually have a bit of an initial strength advantage.    And unlike what others mentioned, we do make them do the sexy choreography along with us :3  So I would say even if a studio says 'women only' on the website, contact them directly and see if something can be arranged."

Mine is also a 2014 model. If you're buying an X-Pole Xpert, the base has two little X marks etched on either side of the base to align the screws to when you switch between static/spinning mode, but I don't know if other models like the Sport have those.

poledancing,2jtbvu,Rasvit,8,Mon Oct 20 19:37:14 2014 UTC,"You build flexibility as you go. Most polers come back after years away from dance/gymnastics/etc or have no experience at all. Most of the things we ask our bodies to do in pole are movements that are entirely foreign to us. You go to learn. You may not get it right away, but you will get it. As for height, I have girls that are 4'10"" and girls that are 6'1"" before shoes. Being tall means less climbing effort and long ass legs and being short means that you have less limb to get in your way. There are advantages/disadvantages to every body type, but you don't know what you personally can do unless you try!"
poledancing,2jtbvu,FancyPhilanges,4,Mon Oct 20 20:06:04 2014 UTC,"Height is not an issue. Im 5ft1 and there are girls as tall as 6ft in my class. I wasnt that flexible when I started but you will become more flexible so dont worry.  You shouldn't worry about this as pole is for anyone with no restrictions on size, height or flexibility"
poledancing,2jtbvu,myweelamb,3,Mon Oct 20 20:14:26 2014 UTC,"I'm 6'3"". I work a very physically active job that's geared towards certain movements. Which worried me about the flexibility.  (Also I'm male)"
poledancing,2jtbvu,yourbffjill,3,Mon Oct 20 21:09:52 2014 UTC,"As others have said, height is never an issue.  I'm close to 6' and I used to not be able to touch my toes at all.  I've never danced or done gymnastics in my life, but in the ~6 months I've been doing pole I've gained a respectable amount of flexibility.  I'm nowhere near doing a split or anything similar, but practice makes perfect, and slow progress is better than no progress!"
poledancing,2jtbvu,Antranik,3,Mon Oct 20 22:41:46 2014 UTC,Thank you everyone for your input. Makes me feel like it won't be a waste to try it. Would yoga be a good start to help the flexibility?
poledancing,2jtbvu,Princessnarwhal,3,Tue Oct 21 01:09:14 2014 UTC,"Yeah, yoga is pretty good. After a few classes, you could probably get a good routine going on your own at home or watch videos online, too!"

What I found was that you really have to keep the pole right against your neck and pull it forward into that trap muscle with all your might, while also pulling your elbows inward.  Making sure I had it right against my neck stopped my clavicle problem, so maybe it's something worth checking out for you."

poledancing,2jgz8l,wineandcatlady,28,Fri Oct 17 00:26:48 2014 UTC,"You need to get rid of that pole and spend the extra money to buy a genuine xpole OR find a dancer who is reselling a second hand genuine xpole or similar reputable brand.   You might think I'm being dramatic and should just answer your question, but I'm not. Those fake poles are seriously dangerous. As you've already realised they don't stay tight, they bend and buckle. Falling isn't a small deal where you'll just brush yourself off. You can end up with serious injury which will stay with you. Not long ago a fake xpole broke while it was in use and the girl broke her hip. She'll never dance again, hopefully she's walking but it wasn't guaranteed at the time.   That you knowingly bought a pole for a non reputable brand is kind of terrifying because it means that as a community were failing at educating against these dangers. If you do a Google search you'll find lots of material on this type of pole and why they should be avoided.   If you're in the US you are really lucky that Xpoles are a lot more affordable there than other places overseas. Studio Veena also has a great pole that is very affordable https://www.studioveena.com/shopping  If you can't afford to spend that much then buy second hand. Talk to the seller, look at the pole, ask for original receipts etc. Educate yourself on how to spot a fake and shop within known communities and you'll be fine.   I'm sorry that you wasted money on a sub par pole and I really hope that money doesn't compel you to continue using an unsafe product. I suggest contacted the selling for a refund or contacting Amazon or even xpole if they're being sold as rip offs.   Edit: Autocorrect changed a word to something random."
poledancing,2jgz8l,Megan_Joan,4,Fri Oct 17 01:09:57 2014 UTC,"Absolutely right! You need to buy a reputable, trusted, brand-name pole. If your pole is unsteady and won't stay put, it's because it is not a professional grade pole. Save up and buy an Xpole, Platinum Stages, or other trusted brand! It's worth it to be safe!"
poledancing,2jgz8l,brittanybangs,4,Fri Oct 17 04:06:22 2014 UTC,"Yep! This brings up a great point for OP.  A lot of these lesser, flimsy brands can get away with selling poles because they'll claim they're a dance prop, stripper pole, etc. to be dirty danced on. They don't have the structural integrity for actual pole dancing.   I refuse to believe that the sellers of these low quality poles don't realise they're putting their customers on danger.

My parents found out when one of my pole friends posted a picture of us during a performance and tagged me in it. Their response was surprisingly chill for prude traditional Asian parents. I'm convinced that they aren't aware of the sexual implications pole dance has in America, and instead are thinking of circus and Chinese-style pole.

poledancing,2jef5z,lavenderglitter,2,Thu Oct 16 14:49:31 2014 UTC,"Well, in pole it's best to work on your core, abs and generally upper body muscles, including arms. Doing exercises like the plank, sit-ups, push-ups and practicing handstands can help you improve on these areas. Search on youtube to find tutorials on these. If some exercises are too hard, search for easier variations. I like the boat-variation of sit-ups, and since I can't do proper push-ups I only descend slow and controlled from starting position.  To help you gain flexibility in the back/legs I suggest you try out some of the exercises in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZTGgEWPbLk (: Good luck!"

poledancing,2jef5z,APacman,2,Thu Oct 16 16:15:06 2014 UTC,"Both other comments make really good points. In pole I'm finding abs/core the hardest.  Arm strength almost just comes with the classes, of course you could work on it to make you get moves easier, but I don't so I can't talk :P  Sounds like you have tight hamstrings, the only thing that's going to help you there is frequent stretching, no shortcuts in flexability (I wish there were!).  There's plenty of stretch routines online you could follow, perhaps look up splits stretches.  But I think the key is to do it when you're not even trying.  If you're sitting on the sofa watching telly, try sitting on the floor instead, back to the sofa with straight legs.  May be place your drink slightly out of reach so you have to bend forward to get it etc.  Just keep it up :)"

You've got time to get flexy before you start attempting jade splits and etc. To get flexible, you just gotta stretch often like APacman said."
poledancing,2jd7xl,fact_addict,6,Wed Oct 15 23:28:24 2014 UTC,"I'd say two to three times a week would be good, but it depends on your health. I'm guessing these are 1 hour or so classes?  I'd say start out with one class a week, see how your body takes it.  If you feel like ramping it up, go for it!  Going once a week you'll still see improvement, just not as quickly.  Go too much, and you'll fatigue yourself.  Resting your body can actually be super beneficial.  I trained practically non-stop for a couple months to get ready for a show and hoo boy was I bruised and banged up!  Gave myself a week off, came back, and things clicked into place that hadn't before.  Lots of people (and I'm one of these) say it's bad to pull and all-nighter for an exam.  Best practice is to study the night before, but go to bed and SLEEP on it.  It sets it in the brain.  I feel the same way about physical learning.  Sometimes your muscle-brains just need a day of rest to really set and absorb what you've been trying to cram into them.  I'd say Tuesday/Thursday or Mon/Wed/Fri classes are great if you can go during the week.  That way you get a night's rest in between.  One of the other sayings I've discovered from my ballet training is ""You'll feel great after a workout.  Then you'll be sore the next day.  The day after that, you'll magically be MORE sore and THAT'S the day you want to work out again.""  Something about...muscle fibers rebuilding themselves and those are the days you gain muscle the quickest?  ...don't quote me on that bit.  Not scientific at all...just kind of what I've garnered and apply to myself.  The most important things are 1.) stay hydrated - your muscles need it.  2.) Get plenty of sleep.  3.) Don't get discouraged.  You'll have off-days.  You'll have great days.  You'll have days where you're inverting like a pro and others where you can't get your hips over your head.  4.) Listen to your body, it's new every day.  You're growing, developing your body in ways it's not used to.  It's going to be a little different everyday.  Different parts will feel sore, different parts will feel strong, and when something twinges LISTEN to it.  5.) Have fun.  You're embarking on something amazing.  Stick with it.  It can teach you discipline if you let it, and THAT is something that will be a valuable tool for you for your entire life.  ...and that's probably a longer post than what you were looking for.  :-)  TLDR: 2-3 times a week for maximum progression.

poledancing,2jd7xl,ZeldaPoleart,1 point,Thu Oct 16 01:07:58 2014 UTC,I agree with this - I went too hard too fast (mostly after I bought a pole for home) and now I'm typing this with my dominant wrist/arm in a compression bandage :(   If you're keen to keep working out look into exercises that complement pole & you should progress just fine.
poledancing,2jd7xl,mutantruby,2,Thu Oct 16 01:49:48 2014 UTC,"I signed up for a once a week class. I do have a small history in sports so I was able to go through a few basic ""levels"" doing it only once a week and executing things well (spins, dance style moves, etc--we also do core work and stretching and whatnot in class). When I started inverting was when i needed to up not only the amount i go to class, but also my time in the gym."
poledancing,2jd7xl,badlcuk,1 point,Thu Oct 16 02:14:24 2014 UTC,"mmm I'm a beginner myself so far I've gone 2 days in a row, and I think  I'm going to aim for at least 4 times a week if not 5. (the weekday)  But personally, I'm not sure if thats the right move because my arms and abs have been sore since the night of the first class. Are we supposed to have resting time?"
poledancing,2jd7xl,rollll,1 point,Thu Oct 16 00:11:51 2014 UTC,"You DEFINITELY should be incorporating rest days into your routine. For people who work out but not necessarily pole, it's often split up into schedules looking something like {upper body day, lower body day, rest day, repeat}. Pole is more of a whole body workout, so the distinction between days may not be as clear, but you might want to work on thigh holds or the like if you're sore from a day of practicing inversions, and then still have rest days. Rest days are important to avoid injury from overuse. Repetitive and strenuous motions build into really difficult and chronic injuries if you aren't careful. Using the weekends for rest days is better than nothing, but ideally they would be spread as equally as possible between your working days (ie. practice Monday & Tuesday, rest Wednesday, practice Thurs and Friday, Rest Saturday, do whatever you feel like Sunday, repeat).  TLDR: schedule rest days so that your muscles can recover between workouts and support you more safely"

poledancing,2j0yi0,nieda920,2,Sun Oct 12 13:53:44 2014 UTC,"At my pole studio over the last couple of weeks, now the weather is getting colder, the body heat in the room is causing condensation around the top sections of the poles. As these higher up sections of the pole aren't really being used in the lesson, they are cold, meaning that the warm air condenses on those areas of cold metal. If the pole is feeling wet, then I imagine it's the same issue.  The only things that will help are trying to avoid condensation in the first place. So keeping the room a little warmer, and literally warming up the higher section of the pole by rubbing it vigorously with a cloth before you practice, and continuing to do so throughout. You could also try using that area of the pole more, though this will mean that other areas of the pole will get cold and the condensation will form there instead."
poledancing,2j0yi0,MyMuddyEyes,4,Tue Oct 21 18:49:48 2014 UTC,"It's probably due to lack of use, as you suggested. Poles need to be ""broken in"" quite a bit before losing that slipperiness.  Have you tried using grip aid?"
poledancing,2j0yi0,purple_potatoes,3,Sun Oct 12 15:17:23 2014 UTC,New poles have a layer that causes it to be slippery. Using the pole will get rid of this layer. Also if the pole is cold it will be slippery as well so it is important to warm up the pole before you use it. Some people have mentioned using vinegar to get rid od this layer but im not sure it works and it will make the pole smell of vinegar  Like purple potatoes mentioned you can use grip aid until the pole is broken in.
poledancing,2iy4w8,h0l,2,Sat Oct 11 14:50:42 2014 UTC,"I was practicing with my friend today and we had the idea to film ourselves in slow motion just for fun, and it turned out to be really cool and useful!

poledancing,2iouyc,polymanwhore,1 point,Thu Oct 9 01:58:32 2014 UTC,The reason for it being better the harder you squeeze is that you push more skin against the pole and thus spread the same weight over more area. Also when there is a lot of pressure you won't feel all the pain until the pressure releases so as you come out of something it may hurt more than being in it in the first place

The only caveat is that ibuprofen will make you bruise more, and obviously if you're not allowed to take NSAIDs for whatever reason (e.g. kidneys), then don't :P   If you're using a certain product to get grippy on the pole (e.g. hairspray or dry hands) it may be worth switching to see if another substance (e.g. shaving cream) is less offensive to your skin. I've found that the liquid chalk products (like dry hands) lead to more pain on my inner thighs, so I only use them on my hands."

You will definitely need your legs uncovered for climbing, though!   I really, really hope you enjoy your first class!   I have a confession to make - when I was a beginner pole dancer, my instructor had all the beginners (including TOTAL newbies) all thrown in one class. We had a larger lady come in for the first time, and she really, really struggled. I had a few classes under my belt, so I was doing inverts and stuff, and I guess that could have been intimidating.  She was working on climbing the whole time, but not really getting anywhere, and I could see she was getting frustrated. I offered her some of my grip aid and said, ""don't worry! You'll get it!""   The next day the studio owner called me and bitched me out for being ""condescending"" and making other people feel bad about their size. I still feel terrible about it. (Though, as an instructor myself now, I also blame the instructor for this - instead of giving her individual attention and trying to teach her things she MIGHT be able to do, like walks, pirouettes and spins, she just let her struggle the whole time.) Please don't take any feedback from the other students as criticism! But us pole dancers are kinda like those creepy overly-enthusiastic Jehovah's Witnesses, and we are SO enthusiastic to share our love for the sport that sometimes we might get too involved. We are NOT judging!! All of us remember that very first class where we all struggled!"

poledancing,2iolar,larafrompinkpony,3,Wed Oct 8 21:30:40 2014 UTC,"I am so glad you are going into this with a positive attitude!  One of the reasons I love pole so much is that it's really a sport where people are super supportive. It's not competitive (well, I mean, it can be) but everyone is amazingly supportive of each other. I wouldn't think twice to ask someone for a spot, or asking someone to ""hold my butt up for me,"" to help me train for a move. I feel like most adults in Western society are afraid to touch each other or be comfortable with their bodies, and pole is totally the opposite of that."

I have on occasion told them that I do yoga, which is at least partially true. (I also know people who say, ""I do contemporary dance"" which is also true!) Plus, I work long/odd hours so if I miss a telephone call or something due to being at a pole class (which is when they usually freak out the most), I can just blame it on work.   The only real hassle hiding my hobby causes is that whenever the parents decide to visit my apartment, my boyfriend and I have to race to take the pole down! (And he doesn't live with me so this makes it more of a challenge)  Living at home would make things tricky, but I think if you can find a friend to be in cahoots with (e.g. Cover for you when you're out at pole) I'm pretty sure you can hide it. People hide much bigger things from their families! :P  I am ""out"" to most of my close friends though, and oddly enough, my bf's parents who think it's cool and hilarious that I'm possibly fitter than him.  And for the record, I tried to be honest to my parents. During my beginners' course (which was a birthday present from my boyfriend) I tried to show them how pole is not just an erotic thing but also a circus art form. I showed them videos of Chinese Pole and Cirque du Soleil, but to no avail. They still insisted I quit after the term (in fact they offered to pay my bf off for the remaining classes so I wouldn't feel obliged to attend them...)

If someone asks, I say that stereotypical strippers don't actually pole dance. They just dance around a pole. Pole dancing is dancing and acrobatics mixed into one. And like any style of dance, you can make it sexual if that's the style you like.  I am very open about my dancing. When I get ""stripper"" jokes or judgmental looks. I say my piece and then I brush it off. When I told my mom, she acquiesed that maybe what I was doing wasn't stripper dancing, but she very judgmentally pointed out that there are lots of women her age (50s) who take stripper dance classes. I just nodded and moved on. I wanted to ask what was wrong with older women taking sexy classes to recapture some of their youth and bring a little spice back to the bedroom? I didn't though because my mother is my mother. I'm not going to change her mind."

poledancing,2i1csj,prunesandwich,4,Wed Oct 1 22:51:15 2014 UTC,There are no legally required certifications for teaching pole in the USA. Or most countries.
poledancing,2i1csj,MinionOfDoom,3,Thu Oct 2 18:34:10 2014 UTC,"Certification for pole is mostly just for show. I mean, sure the training can help you become a better teacher and it'll make you look impressive to students, but that piece of paper won't mean very much in any official sense. There are so many different certifications from different sources that its hard to say one is better than another. It just isn't something that the community has standardized yet. Its the same case with a lot of regular fitness training too.   Basically, if you have the money, time, and desire, its nice to be able to say ""I'm a certified instructor"". But otherwise, its not a big deal. At least not at this stage in the pole world. The important thing is that you understand the basics of the human body and understand how to teach and execute pole safely enough that you could get certified fairly easily if it ever became a necessity."
poledancing,2i1csj,TraumaBunny,3,Thu Oct 2 21:21:36 2014 UTC,"This.  If you read nothing else, read the last sentence.  I cringe whenever I see instructors who don't know what they're doing, don't know how to effectively spot someone, or teach their students things that they aren't ready for."

poledancing,2hy6kw,boobmuncher,2,Wed Oct 1 04:28:28 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I figured I'd learn it from the floor first. I'd like to keep progressing & learning, but my core strength is just not there yet to try it without kicking."

poledancing,2hy6kw,lentil5,3,Thu Oct 2 02:56:36 2014 UTC,"Look behind you, not at your feet while inverting. This will help you get your hips all the way up to the pole.

poledancing,2hy6kw,Eionyx,2,Wed Oct 1 05:36:53 2014 UTC,"Yeah, now that I think about it, I'm definitely looking at my feet right now & gripping with them. (That may account for all the bruises that I keep getting on the top of my foot...) Thank you! That makes a lot of sense!"

poledancing,2hy6kw,codenameisduchess,3,Wed Oct 1 23:55:40 2014 UTC,"One tip for getting your legs higher, is to try to focus on bringing your hip and knees to the pole, rather than your feet. that might help straighten you out"
poledancing,2hy6kw,eliselolz,3,Wed Oct 1 12:50:02 2014 UTC,"When I work on conditioning the invert (or cleaning it up when I start to get lazy on mine) want to make 4 basic shapes  1. Pull up and tuck the legs (I started with 5/day on each side just to condition) 2. Diamond- Start to spread the knees out so they make a diamond <> 3. Rock back- Tilt your pelvis and rock the hips back, make yourself a fulcrum, be pushing back with your arms.  4. Extend the legs and put your head back (I struggled with that part most, I would keep my head up trying to see if I got it yet!)  It's important to have that tight teddy bear grip too so you don't lose height!  I learned the wrong way using my momentum to kick up into it, but it did give me an idea of where to go. I think learning that way opened me up to more injury because I wasn't strong enough, don't underestimate the power of off the pole exercises and building ab strength! Aerial Amy has a great tutorial for inverts. Good luck!  My #1 best tip though has got to be to video yourself and see where your mistakes are being made, which is hard when you're first starting out, but sometimes it helps for troubleshooting!"
poledancing,2hy6kw,marithim,2,Thu Oct 2 07:13:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah I used to have this problem with basic invert and then straddle, probably just need to get your hips up higher before you grip on. With practice you will get it! :)"
poledancing,2hy6kw,poledancinglibrarian,2,Wed Oct 1 02:00:36 2014 UTC,"Your bottom hand should be head level, top just a little higher. If you rotate from that hands should be close to crotch, not calves and should be relatively out of the way. Maybe you are letting yourself collapse down into the pole instead of pushing your hips up and trying to straighten and touch the pole."
poledancing,2hy6kw,michellorocks,2,Wed Oct 1 03:41:15 2014 UTC,"Good advice from the other folks. To prep for standing inverts while you're still on the floor, practice holding the pole (inside hand low, outside hand high) and just straddling the pole with your legs over your head, then lowering them slowly back to the ground. This will help you build up core muscles that will allow you to control your standing invert once you get there.   My pole instructors also made us do a back bend invert before a standing invert when I was first learning."

I couldn't reproduce it on later days, but I feel like I had some breakthroughs about what should and shouldn't be happening in my upper body. Keep on with the butterflies until I can extend them.  I've been able to do extended butterfly sorts of things from elbow stands, so I just need to keep on with the regular kind until I feel stable enough to let it slide out. I got my butt superman!!  I also figured out bees knees along the way.  I need to put more time into dove and maybe start flirting with titanic? I want to pick one more thing to try out that I haven't given much attention to before.  Either allegra or cupid I think.

We spent about two hours on different exercises that allowed each individual to create a short (10-30 seconds) of choreographed movement.

THis is useful for later when you need to do a brass monkey into shoulder mount dismount.  Its also possible to 'jump' (more like a pop) into brass monkey from the floor, if you have your hands in the flag grip, and pop up your legs (so the inner leg, the one doing the gripping, needs to move out and around the pole more than you think it does, it takes a few tries to get right!).  Good work!"

poledancing,2hkhgl,Babusaurus,7,Fri Sep 26 22:25:39 2014 UTC,"So, my experience with pole might not be typical, but I didn't lose any weight poling, at all.

poledancing,2hkhgl,scienner,2,Sun Sep 28 07:18:23 2014 UTC,"I think a lot depends on all the other factors in your life. For myself, I started doing rock climbing (which is kind of similar IMO) regularly about two and a half years ago, and didn't lose any weight doing that I don't think, although I definitely got a lot stronger and better coordinated, and a bit more muscley. When I then started doing pole too thanks to the climbing I was strong enough to start at a relatively advanced level and to do multiple classes back to back. Within a few months of doing both I was visibly fitter and am now a dress size smaller than I started out. I don't know if it's because of the increased frequency, the more diverse activities, or if I just hit some sort of tipping point where the slow changes to my body became enough to be visible/affect the fit of my clothes. More importantly I also saw immediate improvements in my rock climbing performance from pole :)   So, I'm not an expert, but I think it might depend on your starting point, on whether you replace your current activities or add to them, on your general levels of activity outside of the times you're specifically 'exercising', etc.   I have to say, I didn't get into these things for weight loss, but because I love them. I think even though you could read it as a weight loss 'success story', having seen myself take 2.5 years of more intense physical exercise than I've ever done to lose one dress size, barely, I'm not sure I'd recommend it for that purpose. I think if that was my motivation I'd have quit in frustration a long time ago, and resented all the time I dedicate to it. If you're bored with weight lifting and running then absolutely change it up, hopefully you'll find pole so fun that you actively look forward to it regardless of the 'results' in terms of weight loss (instead you'll be thinking of 'results' in terms of 'omg I can do a gemini!!' :)).   You'll DEFINITELY get stronger and fitter from pole, but basically as far as I can tell losing weight is something that varies between people and circumstances."

poledancing,2h5gad,nieda920,4,Mon Sep 22 18:44:59 2014 UTC,"Following up on verysoon's already good starter tips for spinning pole. Practice at first with some holds. Some good basic moves to practice with it is the angel or carousel or even just a sit or practice climbing. You really want to spin very lightly, so train yourself out of 'launching' anything.  If you are going to be doing things on your own PLEASE BUY A CRASH MAT -- if you have not already. :) If you don't try inverting, you will probably be safe, but even so, it's a good idea.  Youtube is a wealth of tutorials. You can use http://poledancedictionary.com/ to look up some very basic demonstrations of almost anything, but they don't really walk you through it or give any tips. You just get to watch the move demoed.  A lot of the prodancers have DVD sets you can buy as well. There's a good series here: http://completepole.com/dvds/"

poledancing,2h5gad,verysoon,3,Tue Sep 23 02:30:15 2014 UTC,"The main difference between static and spinning poles is that with static poles you have to provide your own momentum to move around the pole, whereas the spinning pole moves for you. You want to use a lot less push when you go into a move on spinning pole, especially as a beginner you don't need much at all. Think of it more like you are holding a pose on the pole while it spins. You can control the speed of your spin by extending your limbs to slow down or tucking them in toward the pole to speed up. Start slow with almost no momentum when you go into your moves and you will find a good balance with practice."

poledancing,2gtjwm,eyeinthesky1,3,Fri Sep 19 01:42:06 2014 UTC,A few suggestions I have are stretching your forearms as frequently as possible. Using a bouncy ball to really target the tendons. Also using the palm of your opposite hand to massage under your elbow pit to help the nerves. Rest them as much as you can or it will probably only get worse. Lay off bracket and twisted grips for a while. Good luck!
poledancing,2gtjwm,LoloMarie23,1 point,Fri Sep 19 03:21:20 2014 UTC,"I had pressure there when dismounting from brackets and flip grips. For me it was because when I was in a bracket hold, I wasn't pulling as much up with the top hand so the weight was on the bottom hand which caused the straining. When doing your holds, check that you can remove the pushing hand (bottom hand), with minimal effort and that you are engaged with your arm on the top hand. If you start to fall off the pole with your bottom hand removed, you possibly need to readjust your top hand for a better hold as this likely means you were putting pressure on your bottom hand as well as your top.  I've actually gotten rid of almost all the pain I was getting by paying better attention to my top hand hold and not moving the bottom arm until it was mostly pressure free."
poledancing,2gtjwm,marithim,1 point,Fri Sep 19 06:06:13 2014 UTC,"I used to get terrible pain exactly like that when i first started doing butterfly/split  grip/apprentice etc - basically, your wrists are taking strain or aren't strong enough to support something you have done. I was out of action for nearly a month after I damaged something in my wrist doing a split grip. SO: rule #1 no more split grips until the pain clears up completely! Then, start doing wrist mobility and strength training as much as you can - there are some great youtube videos to help with it, but the 'flicking' exercise is a good one. You can also squeeze a squash ball/stress ball when you are watching tv or sitting still.   good luck! took me a while but I did eventually get stronger wrists."
poledancing,2gtjwm,iheartlungs,1 point,Fri Sep 19 11:10:32 2014 UTC,"If you can get some wrist wraps for support, they are worth it. Weightlifting or crossfit suppliers will sell them. They're not good to rely on constantly but they're good to bust out when you know you're going to be doing some work that is heavily forearm intensive. Also applying heat and rolling the forearms out with a ball will help. Try taking an extra dose of fish oil too."

I've been much more diligent with stretching/ strengthening that arm ever since, but I still avoid split grips on my non dominant side.  My advice is to definitely give it a bit of a rest if possible, and I'm not sure if the cold laser therapy is an option for you but if so, I'd definitely recommend it, I was able to get back to class after about 2 weeks.

poledancing,2gj6zs,Fridayesmeralda,2,Tue Sep 16 04:58:53 2014 UTC,"I had the same problem as well when I got my 45mm chrome xpole, it was really slippery compared to the stainless steel ones in the studio. Even doing a crucifix I would slide all the way down. I cleaned it a few times with regular cleaning solution and alcohol (separately) to get that initial coating off which helped. With use the slipperiness has diminished.  I've had the pole for a couple of months now (only using it once a week on average) and I don't have much problems anymore, just make sure you are properly warmed up so you stick better. It also helps to warm up the pole with your hands, just grabbing it from top to bottom. Now I just clean the pole in between with a dry microfiber cloth."
poledancing,2gj6zs,grimmaul,2,Tue Sep 16 11:14:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I've had the same problem /: It was especially hard to practice stuff like butterfly as I couldn't hold it any longer than 3 seconds before my bottom hand was at the floor.  I've had my pole since december, and used it consistently since april, and first now it's really started to feel like the well used ones. I've heard all sorts of weird stuff you can do to the pole to get the film off (sandpaper for one thing), but I never risked it. I also think warming the pole with your hands from top to bottom really helps, and do lots of basic spins like chair and fireman on static-mode to get the pole warmed up before workouts. Maybe grip aids could help you?"
poledancing,2gj6zs,Lisho,2,Tue Sep 16 11:31:54 2014 UTC,"I sanded my 45mm titanium gold X-Pole after waiting over a year for the slick and slippy coating to wear off. I sprayed it down with alcohol every 2 minutes when in use (it was unusable otherwise), but the pole was never ""correct feeling"" like a studio pole. I waited patiently for the day that I would finally break the pole in via rubbing alcohol and general use, and now I wish that I'd sanded the stupid coating off on day one. I was worried about ruining my pole with this technique until I realized that it wasn't getting any better and that my huge tube of metal wasn't going to be utterly destroyed and useless if I put some scratches on it. Now my pole is slightly less shiny and pristine appearing (I might not recommend sanding if you are looking to sell the pole at a premium later on), and it works a million times better.   I used a fine grit and a light hand until I could begin to see minute scratches forming. Sand a little, clean it off, test with a spin and a leg hang, repeat until satisfied. Maybe give it a few months of use and the other techniques suggested, and if nothing else works try sanding as a final option. But don't do what I did and spend a year feeling like you are the issue and not the apparatus!"

poledancing,2giqud,kakzzz,3,Tue Sep 16 02:03:14 2014 UTC,"This girl is stupid. Why the hell is she learning how to pole dance then?   Oh god no!  Pole dancing is not always suggestive/sexualized dancing.  Although that could be a really fun side to tap into, it's not the only way to dance!  My studio focuses on sensuality and even then, there is no need to rub my body, twerk, or openly make ""orgasmic"" faces in order to feel sexy.  Everyone does what they're comfortable with in a safe environment.  Pole dancing in this form could be very therapeutic and expressive (sometimes emotional).  It's worth bringing up with your instructor what makes you feel uncomfortable.  If there is no work-around, try out other studios or teachers.  There are studios that focus more on sexuality, some on sensuality, whereas others focus on competition/fitness.  Maybe you need to find a studio that's a good mix so it's not too far out of your comfort zone."
poledancing,2giqud,snadypeepers,4,Tue Sep 16 03:38:00 2014 UTC,"Me personally, I love sexy style routines when done well. I've been a stripper for years, and I don't think I'll ever be able to divorce myself entirely from that style. I'm equally comfortable in heels and barefoot. HOWEVER, I've noticed that my dance style has definitely evolved over time - I went from rolling around on the floor making O-faces to a more balletic, acrobatic style.  I used to take lessons at a studio that had both sexy and acrobatic classes, and I pretty much just refused to do the sexy stuff if I wasn't feeling it. I'm there to learn new moves - let me put it together and express myself through dance the way I want.   In my personal opinion, a lot of the time I feel like the women at my studio try too hard to be sexy because that's what they're taught. They're too caught up in trying to look sexy instead of actually feeling sexy, if you know what I mean? And honestly... it ends up looking cringey to me. (I know, I know! It's mean! I'm kind of a dick!)  Also, if I'm not really feeling a song but I still have to dance to it (like if I'm at the club or something), then I'll treat it as a joke. Are you really going to play ""Anaconda"" for me when I'm a skinny little Asian girl with no booty? Well, I might not be able to do this song justice, but at least I can have fun with it and go over the top..."
poledancing,2giqud,larafrompinkpony,2,Thu Sep 18 18:34:07 2014 UTC,"While I think there's room in pole dance for those kind of routines, I also believe it goes way beyond that. At our studio, we focus on different archetypes during our dance journey in order to encourage us to dance in different ways. Some of these archetypes embody strength and power, some love and nurturing, some playfulness, and while one is pretty sexy, it's just one of many.  If you are not comfortable with your studio, have you explored whether there are others in your area you'd be a better fit for?"

poledancing,2g94wp,nieda920,12,Sat Sep 13 01:14:52 2014 UTC,"Hello there nieda920! Former instructor here!  1) Slippery hands - Probably 1/4 of students that came through the studio had this issue; it's very common. It seems some people's hands just have to ""get used to"" the pole. Remember, you've never done this before and you are being pretty active, so your body is going to sweat. Once things become more natural your hands should start ""adjusting"" to the pole. Remember never to put on lotion before class (including in the morning/afternoon before class) because that will make you slippery!! Even grips won't cut through grease from lotion. Try washing your hands with dish soap before going to class and do it in cold water. This will get rid of any residue on your hands as well as cool them off (sounds odd but I had a number of girls claim cold water did wonders). Don't be afraid to wipe your hands off while going through your routine - you're new and not performing for anyone so it's okay to quickly wipe your hands on your shorts (just don't make it a bad habit!). Also, grips react different with different skin so everyone ends up having a favourite. Mighty Grip may not be the choice for you. Try out different types of grips (powder, liquid, chalk) and different brands.  2) Flexibility - this is not something that happens instantly. Every body is different and will react differently to stretching/moving in new ways. I was in a bad car accident prior to starting pole and I legitimately could not sit on the floor with my legs straight out in front of me with my back straight. It was incredibly painful. After about a year I could finally manage this position with my legs straddled slightly. So sitting up straight on the ground was a huge accomplishment for me and took me 12 months. Just be patient. If you stretch everyday, things will come faster, but don't push yourself. It is good to give your body a rest day or two during the week. Your body is working hard to build new muscle and it can be strenuous. A day off can be a welcome relief. And remember - you don't have to be super flexible to do pole!!! It helps, but you do NOT need to be Bendy Kate to pole dance.   3) Pole Journals - lots of people keep these, I did, but it depends on your personality. Some people keep very detailed journals of everything they did in class, what worked and what didn't, they write down their routines, etc. Most girls that I saw with journals were in higher levels where we would work on one harder move all class. This way, they could write down the name of their move, how to do it, and what technique the used to get into it. Some people also like to record ""AHA!"" moments so they don't forget them. Girls can struggle for weeks and weeks to get a move because sometimes they just don't get a certain aspect of it. For example, let's say someone is attempting to learn the Gemini and has been at it for weeks but just can't hold it on the pole. One day, it finally clicks that they need to press their inside arm against the pole as a lock to keep their body from sliding down the pole. VOILA! They have their AHA! moment and write it down so they don't forget! Basically, it's your journal, you can write about anything you want!  4) Recovery - ice on injuries, arnica for bruises and sore spots, polysporin for burns will help those nasty pole burns that tend to appear on wrists and inner thighs (especially when you are learning to sit on the pole) and it will numb the pain a bit, drink tonnes of water, watch as many videos on youtube as you can (this is huge - it will help you be able to identify moves faster, see how transitions between moves work, it can be inspirational, etc.).  If you ever have any other questions, feel free to PM me! Happy poling!"
poledancing,2g94wp,brittanybangs,1 point,Sat Sep 13 03:14:07 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much for your thorough response! I forgot about the bruises, but I did have one question about them. Is it normal to bruise in different areas on each side, or does it mean I'm doing something wrong/different on one side? I practice on both sides, but (for example) I have a big bruise on the top of my right foot from the right climb, but only a little bruise on my left from the left climb?"
poledancing,2g94wp,GoldStarVaulter,3,Sat Sep 13 12:05:47 2014 UTC,"I never bruise evenly. So long as you are practicing evenly you are fine. Eventually your skin will develop a kind of ""callous"" so the bruising will become less and less severe in the same poses (still expect to see them, and especially expect them after a new move). Depending on which side is your better side, your legs might be stronger wrapping one way so you don't have to put as much pressure on your feet to climb, and could also be why they aren't as bruised. Just focus on technique on each side, but bruising isn't really the best indicator for it.  Side note: arnica cream helps some people with bruising if they are too tender or painful you could look into trying it."

poledancing,2g94wp,gortonsfiJr,2,Sat Sep 13 12:24:12 2014 UTC,Completely normal! You may be stronger/better on one side so you can control your movements more - resulting in smaller or less bruises. Chances are slim that you are going to bruise symmetrically since you are probably never going to hit/bang/fall on the exact same part of your body on both sides!

poledancing,2fzpky,flashingbackk,21,Wed Sep 10 09:33:35 2014 UTC,"Before you embark on your journey to Extended Butterfly, I'd work on the Butterfly. Your goal is to be away from the pole, where your hands and the calf of one leg are the only points of contact. I mean this as opposed to this.   Your bottom hand is not in place at all, it need to be straight and pushing you out (or at least like in the second picture). Think about it like a handstand, but with your arms handing the pole instead of the floor.   When you feel confident and secure in the Butterfly, away from the pole, you'll also gain strength to allow to slowly relay less and less on your calf grip, which would make it possible to progress to Extended Butterfly.  The Butterfly is a very important exercise which would prepare you for The Ayesha. The more you invest into learning it and getting it down to second nature, the easier it would be for you to learn many other more advanced moves.  Good luck!"
poledancing,2fzpky,ClockworkMagpie,3,Wed Sep 10 14:06:53 2014 UTC,"congrats!!  just one tip, try to extend that bottom arm in the butterfly  into more of a split grip. Where you are right now almost seems like you're going to get yourself into an Ayesha"

The instructor is a more advanced than I intermediate level person. It was just us two. She wanted to have me practice climbing up the pole to do a siren in heels. I told her I didn't know how. So she taught me how to do a Siren, which is something that I've been wanting to learn for a while. It was a lot of fun! I managed to do it two times on static and once one spinning (though my spinning dismount left much to be desired as I got dizzy). We didn't take any pics though :("

I managed to get most things on the first few attempts, and took copious notes so I can clean it up when I get home.   I learned to do the Polorama (aka butt superman) and Michelle Shimmy herself taught me how to get into a Seahorse. I also took a private with Natasha Wang and we did some cool meathook-based combos on my bad side (!) that are working out. And she also showed me some variations on her famous pole handstand presses! Also, even though I've been doing handsprings for about a year now, they've never been super consistent... apparently I've been doing them wrong, and with a slight tweak in technique, it's gotten a LOT easier.  I'm like this close | | with my spatchcock and Iron X. But like I said, I'm gonna take this week easy because I think my arms are about to fall off."

We do quite a bit of conditioning but the rest of the class is all tricks. Even climbing up and down the pole a few times leaves me sweaty. Although I'm working on more advanced tricks now, I don't remember that happening before earlier in the year, when I was probably in better shape.  Trick-wise... I guess leg switches? I haven't learned anything completely new in a while. It's just a matter of being able to execute the tricks I know several times in succession without tiring out. So I guess, endurance again.  :P"

We have a showcase coming up next  month so right now I'm working on some combos I'd like to put in my routine. All of us instructors are doing a group number so I'll be choreographing the dance part as well.  I also started a new lyra performance intensive program and we'll be debuting a halloween show at the end! I'm very excited!   I hope to work on the tic toc split next class.

poledancing,2fpjgi,Chellekat,3,Sun Sep 7 14:09:02 2014 UTC,"First off, go you!  It's definitely not a fun process, but I'm a big believer in flexibility reducing injuries.  As far as tips go, have you ever done yoga?  One of the ways you practice stretching in yin yoga is to go to where it's slightly uncomfortable and stay for a few breaths.  That will help you loosen up and not tear or pull anything.  Then, take a DEEP breath, and as you exhale, try to ""relax"" your muscles into a deeper stretch.  Keep using your breath to deepen that stretch.  For me, my biggest struggle is staying relaxed into it, so be conscious of what's going on.  Also, keep things even!  Don't do just one leg, you want to keep your body balanced so you a) don't pull a muscle on the ""weak"" leg and b)build muscle evenly so you can perform on both sides.  Good luck!"

poledancing,2fpjgi,shelb93,1 point,Mon Sep 8 03:10:08 2014 UTC,"/r/flexibility had a good splits challenge a few weeks/months back. I would head there, a lot of this community overlaps into that one :)   Also like others have said, yoga is awesome, remember to breathe, wear layers while stretching to help get you warm. And don't just drop into the splits. There are some good guides on youtube that will help you open up your hips. And keep it even! Do everything on both sides.   Tightness in your back can also make your hips tight, so make sure you're stretching all over and not just hip flexors. Good luck!"
poledancing,2fpjgi,lentil5,1 point,Sun Sep 7 17:37:22 2014 UTC,"Make sure you're really warm! I like to stretch after working out or after class when my muscles are really warmed up and pliable. If you can't do that then make sure you do a nice dynamic warm up to break a sweat before busting out the hardcore stretching. It's very important to stretch on both sides always, regardless of which side you're working on.  Also, try epsom salt baths to help your muscles with recovery, as deep stretching cause cause a bit of ping-back tightness or delayed onset muscle soreness. The heat will help the muscles recover effectively. Also, getting lots of sleep and eating right (lots of good fats) will help your joints and connective tissue with recovery and range of movement."

poledancing,2fkc21,TehSnowman,8,Fri Sep 5 17:06:24 2014 UTC,"Good for you for going after what you want. Don't worry about being in great shape or a weight limit. If the studio has installed their poles correctly it shouldn't be a problem, especially since you will be starting with low intensity moves anyway. And trust me, you will feel the fitness benefits.   As far as clothing goes I recommend shorts. And something more on the tighter side would be better just to keep everything where it belongs ;) Pants won't work very well because you need skin contact with the pole. And shaving your legs will be a big plus to help with grip as well.   I think you are already on the right track. Just find a nice, small studio to start out. Everyone feels silly when they start and there will be a lot of laughing at yourself, and a lot of feeling fabulous. I hope this helps."

poledancing,2fkc21,tooposhtofunction,7,Fri Sep 5 18:27:25 2014 UTC,"Fellow male pole dancer here so I should be able to answer most of your questions.   You will be a bit of a novelty I'm afraid(or at least I was), but don't worry just tell them why you are there it will probably be for the same reasons they are. There isn't a weight limit as such but being a bit lighter helps. I had my mate poling the other day and he is a 18st bodybuilder and he and the pole were fine. As you progress (which is usually faster than the ladies gotta love them man muscles) people tend to get a bit thinner and a bit more toned. It's a full body workout.   In terms clothing, you need skin contact with the pole so I wear shorts and a teeshirt although I sometimes lose the t if I am doing stuff will armpit grips. A tank top would probably be a good compromise.  I'm glad you are so keen I can't recommend pole enough. I have made so many good friends and it's defiantly changed my life for the better. If you have any other questions let me know and good luck!"

You could always buy a pole and teach yourself, but I highly recommend at least a few classes first... learning the fundamentals from someone who knows their shit is very valuable and will certain promote faster learning later on.

Anything goes at our studio, no one cares who you are or what you want to do,mas long as all you wanna do is pole, its the best :)   Just out of interest, you female-only studios, do you ever have male dancers come to do workshops? We have a guy that runs bootcamp sessions and PT, and we had a workshop from Dan Rosen (hes just won the pole expo comp, i dont think that videos out but you should deffo check out his videos). Men are beginning to rule the pole world, so why should you stop them progressing, or even starting? I understand some women are uncomfortable doing what they do in front of men, but i think studios should have a handful of women-only classes, and the rest mixed. At the end of the day, men who want to stare and leer at women wont go to a pole-dancing class to do it, men like that wouldnt be seen dead pole-dancing!  Ive gone off on a tangent - go men go!"

poledancing,2fdme8,ursae,6,Wed Sep 3 18:20:23 2014 UTC,"I am a huge proponent of training for strength, especially with weights. This is for a few reasons:    You can increase your strength much more quickly with weights (or even a bodyweight routine) than you can with a pole.  More productive Pole practices. Imagine you don't have the strength for deadlift. You spend an hour a day on the pole, half of which is spend trying to condition your abs for them. So that's half your practice where you're not learning anything new, just getting strength in a really ineffective way.  More well rounded strength : So now you've got your deadlift invert and you're on to handsprings. If all your strength comes from Pole, you're back to square one - you've never done anything like it so you're nowhere near strong enough. But if you've been consistent with a strength program, you've have a much better base to start from.  Most Importantly : HEALTH. Pole dancers tend to have a lot of the same injuries that rock climbers get - namely, we've overdeveloped our 'pulling muscles' and several neglected the 'pushing' muscles. You get girls that can do weighted pullups but can barely bench press 45 lbs. This isn't healthy for your shoulders, leads to a lot of shoulder injuries. Having a well - rounded strength routine can do a lot to combat this."
poledancing,2fdme8,PoemanBird,1 point,Thu Sep 4 00:15:44 2014 UTC,"These are all really good points, actually, especially the last, as I really want to make sure I don't put myself in a position to injure myself."
poledancing,2fdme8,Miffieee,1 point,Thu Sep 4 05:35:25 2014 UTC,"Hi again!  I was wondering if you had a strength program that you would recommend.  I looked up some info on /r/xxfitness  and /r/Fitness and started the Starting Strength program, an overall strength program which involves squatting, bench presses, deadlifts, and powercleans.  But should I be doing anything else / in specific?"
poledancing,2fdme8,PoemanBird,2,Tue Sep 9 23:53:13 2014 UTC,"I strongly believe the best pole conditioning exercise is pole itself.  If you are too weak to swim a good front crawl does it make sense to work out your muscles at the gym to get better at swimming? No, it makes sense to keep practicing your swimming."

If your'e already active, then pole-specific training is not always necessary, but it sounds like you could supplement pole classes with a little extra to give you a boost.  I can only tell you what works for me, but here it is: Strength: 1-2x/week : light cardio, abs+obliques , pull ups, push ups Flexibility: (3-4x/week) : 20 mins of stretching legs & back"
poledancing,2fdme8,Kitty-Bibliophile,1 point,Wed Sep 3 19:23:04 2014 UTC,"For about 8-10 months pole dancing (once to twice times a week for an hour, mostly a lot of climbing, swings, basic inverts, etc) was enough. Once i hit the point where it wasn't inverting in to a move, but holding and transitioning, I had to start training separately specifically for pole. I do not own my own pole at home. My specific challenges may be different from yours, but my instructor specifically requested i focus on upper body control via things like pull ups, reverse style pull ups (where you slowly go down), holding a pull up part way, leg lifts while holding a pull up, etc. I think because it recreates a lot of the similar pole style moves but can be done with a pull up bar (easily installed in to a doorframe). Flexibility is also another huge thing, but I am really really bad at it and dont really enjoy practicing it!!"

poledancing,2f62pc,GalleonSnidget13228,8,Mon Sep 1 13:41:47 2014 UTC,"Fan kick may be a beginner move, but don't underestimate it. A pretty fan kick will require a good degree of flexibility and strength. As a beginner you might lack in these areas, but that's what these moves are for. They help you build the strength and increase active flexibility, and you get better over time.  Start small! Don't try to kick as high as the instructor. Kick as high as you feel comfortable, or as your body allows you to. Try to kick with bent legs, and see if you it allows you to maintain a better form. If yes - you'll need to work on your leg flexibility to allow yourself to bring your legs higher when they are straight.  Try to kick with the leading led straight and the other one completely bent. It will embed in you the right habits, yet make it easier. See how high can you swing the leading leg and focus on it. It can actually be too much to process when you need to swing around two legs at once.    You can also practice the leg movement laying on the floor. Start on one side, bring the upper leg in a big arch in front of you to your face while rolling slowly to your back. When you are on your back with the leading leg in front of you, start moving the other leg in the same big arch. Complete the movement for both legs on your other side and so back the other direction.  Last but not least, your instructor is most likely much more flexible and strong than you are. She'll make anything look easy. You won't always nail it right away, but don't let it discourage you. We all start with lousy fan kicks, pitiful spins and failed inversion attempts, but the one thing that matters is that we stubbornly work on it and get better."
poledancing,2f62pc,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Mon Sep 1 14:44:06 2014 UTC,Thank you so much for this! Will definitely keep those tips in mind next time I attend pole class.
poledancing,2f62pc,lsjess616,6,Mon Sep 1 16:16:11 2014 UTC,"Don't think of it as a kick.  Think of it as a hold.  Get a good grip on the pole between your arm and your side, and lift yourself up a bit.  The goal is to take all of your weight off your legs, so that you have time to move your legs in a leisurely fashion.  If you have your weight on your legs, and you're kinda jumping into it, you don't have as much time to make a pretty kick."
poledancing,2f62pc,acoltrain,4,Mon Sep 1 20:42:36 2014 UTC,"Fan kicks also annoy me too, so you're not alone. It's one of those moves that unless you get just right it feels pretty terrible. Also, don't worry about your weight-- I'm 147 and heavy on the bottom half as well. Pole works for all body types and as you continue to take class, you will build strength and flexibility.   Here's some of the advice I got from my instructor. Worry about your lead leg rather than your following leg. Draw a wide, high arc with your lead leg and the other will naturally follow. You could also try leaning back a little, provided your grip on the pole is steady enough."
poledancing,2f62pc,Miffieee,3,Mon Sep 1 15:33:29 2014 UTC,Seems like you're jumping up because you're not strong enough to hold onto the pole with your arms. You need to lift your body up with your arms when your legs come up. Don't worry about getting your legs super straight or making wide fans. That takes flexibility which you will need lots of time to work towards.
poledancing,2f62pc,kcbrush,2,Mon Sep 1 19:03:22 2014 UTC,"Like tons of things in pole, it's all about the movement of your hips. Make sure your inside hip is twisted to the front first, then switch over so it's your outside hip. Even little leg fans are fine to begin with as long as your hips are making the correct movement. Then once your hips are good, you can work on making bigger and bigger fans with your legs. Good luck!"
poledancing,2f62pc,mai_z,1 point,Mon Sep 1 22:34:45 2014 UTC,"Like ClockworkMagpie said, a good fan kick takes flexibility and strength.

I was worried that it would affect my pole grip but it's completely absorbed by morning, as if I never used anything.. I'm positive you can find it on amazon. One container has lasted me almost a year and it's still mostly full. It's also great for any other kind of injury..

Your arms, shoulders, core and legs are all working hard when you do pole! I would suggest keep going with the squats, and add in some abdominal exercises to help strengthen your core, and start working on press ups (on your knees is fine). But honestly when you start going, your strength, endurance and flexibility will all drastically improve anyway! I couldn't even do a basic climb the first week and now I can climb halfway up the pole :D! It's the most amazing feeling to go each week and feel that you can pull your legs up a little higher than last time, or you can hold your plank straighter and longer in the warmup."

Also, It does teach a certain sense of body love. I was really lucky to have some amazing pole instructors who really encouraged me to embrace my sexiness and taught me how to dance seductively, dancing in this way has made me look at myself differently. When you catch a glimpse of yourself dancing in this way, some of your insecurities about your own body start melting away because you see yourself as this sexy woman who can do really amazing things with her body, suddenly, it isn't all about weight.   Also, I think I have gained confidence from being in a group of women who encourage other women to embrace their talents and to be sexy, bold, confident. Growing up, I learned that you need to be modest or other women will start getting jealous/catty, and would always feel like I was comparing myself. I think it is empowering to be a part of a community where women stick together and encourage one another instead of tearing each other down. It is empowering to learn that you are sexy in your own right and another woman being extremely sexy isn't going to detract from your own appeal (ie, there is no real need to feel like we are competing)."
poledancing,2f1448,bathtub_mermaid,1 point,Sat Aug 30 20:56:37 2014 UTC,"I don't love the word ""empowering"" because I don't think it's totally descriptive of what I feel, but it definitely has great benefits that anyone, guy or girl can take advantage of.  I don't think I have a ""success story"" per se, but I'm happy to give you three ""testimonials"" on why I love pole:   My everyday clothing is pretty conservative. In the studio, not much is covered, but I'm comfortable in my skin, because I'm dressed like this to be able to nail my next move. I don't necessarily feel sexy in my pole clothes, because feeling sexy, to me, has an element of approval from the opposite sex (or same, but you get my point). Pole helped me stay in shape, but also made me more comfortable in my skin, and ashamed of nothing, regardless.  On the fitness side,I don't like sports, and I don't like exercise. Pole provides a way to have short term and long term goals, and is an artistic way for me to stay in shape. I'm not as flexible or as strong as a lot of the girls, but I find that the community is more accepting of ""intermediate level"" players than many other forms of dance.   On a final note, everyone gives me funny looks when I tell them about pole. What I think the part of the messaging that doesn't get across is, I pole for ME, not for my boyfriend, or to impress others  (in fact, many people know that I pole, but very few have actually seen it)."

poledancing,2ev5dv,mutantruby,6,Thu Aug 28 23:43:03 2014 UTC,"I got into pole after 10 years of lusting after it but not having the confidence to try it. I liked the look of it, sort of like ballet with the grace yet incredible strength thing going on. A few faraway friends tried it so I bit the bullet & signed up in my city.   I've been doing it for about 2 months & I'm much more confident! I'm easily the biggest girl in my class but I'm having fun with the moves & I enjoy a challenge. I can feel my flexibility improving & my fiance LOVES the more confident mutantruby.   It's affected my life so much more than that. I suffer from GAD & depression & it gave me something to look forward to every week during my recent slump. Without that, I may very well still be in the slump. It makes me a happier person."
poledancing,2ev5dv,littledory,7,Fri Aug 29 04:19:14 2014 UTC,"Pole was what I picked up and loved while I worked as an exotic dancer. It's the good part of those times I kept and took out with me. It keeps me strong, healthy, and mostly sober. On occasion fills a void. It is often the vice I lean on, one of the great things that continues to save me from myself. The ultimate therapy and self counseling. Teaches me how to fail, how to push, to find consistency, dedication, perseverance, pride and discipline. Teaches me about others and how to love and be supportive beyond myself; particularly my fellow woman and all that it entails."
poledancing,2ev5dv,jamielicious,7,Sat Aug 30 07:21:24 2014 UTC,"Friend/Co-Worker asked if I'd like to try the classes with her after a studio moved in super nearby.  We started almost exactly a year ago. I've lost weight, and gained strength, fitness, and confidence. When I started, my teacher had to convince me I should keep going and would grain strength.  Now my attitude is completely changed.  It's no longer if I can do it, it's WHEN I will do it.  I'm not afraid to keep working on things that other girls get right away.  We celebrate every accomplishment for every girl in class.   I'm not self conscious of my size (bigger girls represent) and have no problem wandering around in booty shorts for pole, or pulling up my tank/wearing a sportsbra in front of people. It's pretty hard to properly express all of this.  But in short, it's good for your health, strength, self esteem, and body confidence.  All of mine are much better than they were a year ago when pole was not a part of my life."
poledancing,2ev5dv,armstrongdiksmashor,5,Fri Aug 29 02:54:01 2014 UTC,"It was actually because of a private group session I was in, for my cousin's bachelorette in Vegas. It was so much fun and a great alternative workout, that I signed up at a local studio. I love it because it's boosted my confidence 200%. I know I don't have a perfect body but I don't care because I'm comfortable in it ;)"
poledancing,2ev5dv,acoltrain,6,Fri Aug 29 00:42:44 2014 UTC,"A studio near me ran a Groupon and I went ""why the hell not?"" After five classes, I was totally in love. No looking back.    I'm stronger and more flexible now and being able to do moves I thought were impossible a few months ago really helps my self-esteem."
poledancing,2ev5dv,NattyChan18,3,Fri Aug 29 11:39:14 2014 UTC,"My girlfriend received classes from her boyfriend for her birthday and asked me to come along with her.  Ever since then I have been hooked.  I am now part of a Pole dance troupe, it makes be feel incredibly sexy and I wouldn't want to work out any other way."
poledancing,2ev5dv,Miffieee,5,Fri Aug 29 03:23:17 2014 UTC,I watched a pole video on youtube and kept watching them for almost 2 years. Finally I signed up for a pole dance class. It's only been a couple of months but I'm already getting stronger.
poledancing,2ev5dv,RandomRedditor25,4,Fri Aug 29 11:31:10 2014 UTC,"When I was recovering from a really bad breakup, one of my goals was to learn a few new hobbies. I'm a pop cover dancer, and one of my favorite groups came out with a pole dance, so I decided to give it a whirl and loved it!  I have a pole at home, but can't afford lessons till I get a new job. Even with just youtube videos, it's made me so much more confident, and helped me relearn how to feel sexy and happy at a time when I was at a low."
poledancing,2ev5dv,Wisix,3,Fri Aug 29 13:06:49 2014 UTC,"I saw a deal on livingsocial for a studio in the city, and it sounded interesting, but too far away. So I kept an eye on livingsocial deals closer to me, and one popped up for a studio 15 minutes away. I got the 5-class package to see if I liked it. So far I really do! I've been watching youtube videos of what you can do with pole dancing, and it's really inspiring."
poledancing,2ev5dv,coffeeforone,3,Fri Aug 29 12:55:24 2014 UTC,Signed up for a groupon with a friend. She stuck with me through the first series. She didn't continue after that but it's been almost 4 years since my first class! I love it because it's different and fun and such an individual sport.
poledancing,2ev5dv,ClockworkMagpie,3,Fri Aug 29 22:59:58 2014 UTC,"My boyfriend signed me up!   He has a friend who is pole dancing, and she raved about it. He thought it would be nice for me to have a sporty hobby that I won't hate, and tried to convince me to give it a go. He even showed me Jenyne Butterfly YouTube clips but I was on the fence about it. So he took matters to his own hands and signed me up for a class.   My life was never the same again. :)"
poledancing,2ev5dv,Jamethiel_25,3,Mon Sep 1 14:52:59 2014 UTC,I played year round sports growing up and am really tall >6'0''.  I was looking for something new to try and was between CrossFit and Pole.  I decided to try pole because it took me farther out of my comfort zone and I felt like I could embrace a more feminine side of myself.  After the first class I found it to be very challenging and more than what I expected.  This challenge has been awesome so far and I really love it.  I have gotten stronger and definitely have more self confidence in myself and my body than I did when playing basketball or other sports.  I also love the community and how encouraging everybody is.  I am so glad that I made the decision to go to the pole studio to give it a try. :)
poledancing,2ev5dv,pantherchild,2,Tue Sep 2 16:14:05 2014 UTC,"I got into pole cause my ex didn't want me to do it!  I mentioned it in passing and he said he wasn't really comfortable with me doing something like that.  I put it out of my mind, thinking I was being a good girlfriend.  Turns out, he's just an ass.  Husband thought pole was a great idea, and really pushed me to sign up.  I love it so much and am beyond happy that it's part of my life.  It's made me more confident and has helped my view of myself and others a whole lot.  It's a fantastic conversations piece.  Also, I'm now flexible!!"
