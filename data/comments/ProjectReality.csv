To further the question: The best options for a mortar team are 1. A commander with the UAV, and second, the mortar team squad leader in the field finding targets. Lastly would be having squad leads in the field calling the shots. This is usually ineffective at most, especially through team text. if a person is typing in coordinates, the likelihood of success is really low and unreliable. The issue that occurs is that too few squaddies in the mortar squad to have the lead leave or that the lead wants to help at the pits, which is fine if the CO is calling the shots, but lets face it, commanders are rare. Than of course we also have the issue of other squad leads not wanting to call in the targets because they're too damn lazy, or they just lack the common courtesy of calling it in for their team (which is stupid because MORTARS ARE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPONS FOR DOING A MASS AMOUNT OF DAMAGE IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AIDING IN FORWARD MOVEMENT FOR YOUR TEAM) and of course there's the issue with leads being in too much of a hurry to move forward and the mortars just hear crickets.

ProjectReality,3d444f,chocochino,5,Mon Jul 13 10:55:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly any squad-leading is better than no squad-leading. Whatever game you join, if there aren't loads of INF squads there's usually at least a squad-load of people who don't want to SL but would join an INF squad.   Get abreast of the SL tools: the radio, markers, rally-points, and try and get to know some maps. I find SL-ing on an INS layer as the stronger side is the best practice for beginners. Like you said, defending a position (or better yet, a FOB) is one of the easier tasks. Herding cats onto an objective can be difficult at the best of times, then you get attacked and have casualties/respawns etc. to deal with.   SL-ing is a lot of responsibility, and you'll get (or feel like you deserve) a lot of blame when things go wrong. Above all else, get a good squad composition (two medics for revives, an AR is powerful and pretty standard, breacher for destroying objectives); manage your respawns/rally points/FOBs effectively (tell people when to hold their spawns, where to spawn, so you're never spread out on the map); and pray for some good squad mates. Don't be afraid to kick those totally disobeying orders, those without mics, etc. as they're taking up a slot other, more valuable, players might want. In an ideal world, you shouldn't have to do much fighting, or at least not much killing; your squad should get all that done for you, if it's capable and well-managed.   If SL-ing interests you, there's always a market for it. If it's not essential that you don't, then play in some INF squads, learn some more kits, learn the maps, watch what your SL's doing, and ask questions. That means when you make the leap it'll come a lot quicker and you'll be able (squad providing) to do some of the harder stuff, like capping zones and taking objectives."
ProjectReality,3d444f,Kameniev,8,Mon Jul 13 11:42:18 2015 UTC,"Squad lead after two hours of playing? No, You need much more time. The game is much more complicated than that.  Start with 4-man mortars."
ProjectReality,3d444f,Anon49,10,Mon Jul 13 11:39:52 2015 UTC,"I've been playing for years and still don't feel comfortable leading a squad. Not to say you can't get a good grip of it all after 2 hours and watching tons of footage; I just think there's so much more to learn by playing a supporting role in a squad and paying attention to how a successful squad works while you're actually interacting in it.   No reason to rush it, it's a lot of fun to be part of a good squad even if you're taking orders from a good leader. My best online experiences have been in PR. Not BF4, not COD, etc. a good squad in PR is addicting."
ProjectReality,3d444f,evsoul,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:08:11 2015 UTC,"After about a week of playing with my group we started leading our own squads and getting too squad every few rounds. I think a big part of squad leading is charisma and confidence. If you can't keep your squad from doing their own thing or correctly convey a message to them, then you can't lead a squad. Another important thing is FOB building and marker placement. It's always nice having a SL who places markers effectively to designate enemies/move-to points and one who can create effective FOBs that don't get destroyed within one minute or so close to another FOB that it's pointless."

Being a good squad leader in PR (or any other game for that matter) is less about knowing everything about the game and its mechanics than it is about being leader material in general.  I've had people relatively new to the game stepping up when our squad leader left the squad and they did a great job. Sure they asked stuff like ""so how do I spawn an FOB"" and similar but they did it without stuttering or sitting quiet for long periods. They were keen on learning with spirits high which is why we had confidence in him, stuck with him and followed what he requested. Most people are very helpful, and why wouldn't they help their squad leader?   As long as you know how to talk yourself, especially when it comes to communicating with other squad leaders and the commander. The game is all about communication and coordination."

There's a severe lack of even half decent squad leaders out there. By defending flags, you'll be doing a key job that is constantly neglected.

Nothing worse than a squad leader asking for a medic when he's actually dead dead.  Not to mention the countless unique tools a commander has (radio and all of its commands).  You don't help your team when it takes you 10 minutes to place a FOB, only for it to be right next to a base or somewhere in the open.  Play the game and watch what good squad leaders are doing.  You can try SL once you've played a dozen or so good games, but with two hours of experience, its absurd to think you can take a leading role and help your team."

ProjectReality,3d2wot,DerpyPyroknight,6,Mon Jul 13 02:27:07 2015 UTC,"It all really comes down to three things:   Map-checking: Easy - Maintain spatial awareness of nearby friendlies by learning to quickly open your map and orient yourself to the other blue and green dots. If you prefer a more ""roleplaying"" style like me, this is the ""cheating"" option. Communication: Medium - A little more challenging, but learning to use squad radio and local speech to confirm who you're looking at and make sure they know you're friendly as well. Personally, I like to maintain a moderate chatter on local whenever possible, so any friendlies coming around the corner know I'm there. Uniforms: Hardest - There's tons of different factions in the game, most use some kind of camouflage, and many look very similar to each other. This takes time and patience, checking your targets meticulously and learning the little quirks of each uniform (for example, MEC soldiers usually wear a dark scarf around their necks and uniforms are slightly more brown and splotchy than USMC's grainy greyish-brown-green)   Pretty much, you just gotta keep playing and learn all of the above through experience. If I'm ever on an unfamiliar faction, I take a few minutes to just look at my teammates and make sure I recognize their features, then anything different is usually an enemy, for example."
ProjectReality,3d2wot,caligari87,4,Mon Jul 13 02:44:37 2015 UTC,"For new players, totally agree with #1.   Not just because its the easiest, but the quicker you get to learn to quickly check your map to see if that engine you hear is an enemy vehicle or friendly, and to know is that shooting i hear around the corner an enemy gun or friendly.   The combination of that means you should practice using the map the most, it is just the most useful way.   Side note, in 1.3 they added the cone of vision on your dude to make figuring out which way your looking on the map 100X easier. so use that to your advantage.    Also side note to #3 Uniforms are hard unless its vs insurgents. Better to learn weapons and hats. Telling the difference between russian AK's and american gear is a lot easier. Next Hats are a dead give away from a lot of factions. what they wear on their head can be a big difference.   Another side note sorry i'm ranting but, If you are a bit new looking at your squad members camo, and then after killing the enemy or finding enemy bodies look at their camo. try to study the colour difference, this might help a bit to a map to map learning."
ProjectReality,3d2wot,Polysics91,3,Mon Jul 13 03:54:41 2015 UTC,Is there some way to make the map appear quicker? On my old laptop it takes what seems like 2-3 seconds for the map to appear.  Also is there some way to adjust the size of the overlay map? On my laptop it covers most of the view. I'd love to have a smaller overview map (like on vehicles) open all the times until I learn the maps.
ProjectReality,3d2wot,chocochino,2,Mon Jul 13 10:10:35 2015 UTC,"so i will refute what the others say, pressing capslock seems to be the fastest way, there is a very noticeable delay when press M to open map. the next is capslock gives you more info in regards to how much of your squad is still alive and such. also you can still move when using squad map, just hold W and press capslock and you can look and play with your map while still moving forward(really good if your stamina has run out on long walks)"
ProjectReality,3d2wot,Polysics91,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:12:51 2015 UTC,"The best time to use the map is before you're spotted. When you get into any defensive position or have 5 seconds of safety to check your map then do it. Quickly make a mental note of where the rest of your team is, are they in groups, are they moving or holding a position, anything unique on the map as a reference, are there friendly vehicles nearby or approaching, etc etc... Just try to get as much in from the map as you can every once in a while.  That was when you see a silhouette or vehicle you can't actually identify but you've just checked your map 30 seconds ago and KNOW there were no friendlies in that area you can be act quickly. It might even be the difference of two people spot each other, one checks map but the other already knows his map, shoots first, lives last.  It also helps to use communication. Remember as a team game you as an individual are not equipped with the all tools necessary to win. If you're not sure, just ask, your SL or anyone with binocs can double-check for or maybe your SL has been told over SL-chat about friendles / enemies in the area you're watching."
ProjectReality,3d2wot,nekowaiidesu,0,Thu Jul 16 01:46:15 2015 UTC,"The map is intended to be large and obtrusive just so you can't do that, in my opinion. It used to be a mini-map in BF2, but they changed it to make things more realistic/difficult.  However! Look in your controls. There's a key for ""open map"". Most players don't use this. They use the ""Squad Menu"" to see their map. The regular map key opens it faster, without the squad overlay on the side, and it's very slightly transparent so it doesn't completely block your vision.

ProjectReality,3d2wot,nigggle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:38:51 2015 UTC,"Well, a major thing I do is continually keeping myself updated on where my teammates are using the map. If I see someone where I know no friendlies should be, they're an enemy. If I'm not sure, I can check the map again when safe.  And you can discern many uniforms at that range, especially if your resolution is fairly good. Even just different uniform colors can go a long way on maps that don't have similar-looking teams (and if you're careful and knowledgeable, you can do the same on those maps too). I mean, somebody in lighter, more solid colors on a US INS map is highly likely an insurgent, while someone in khaki tones with a non-solid look is US. Helmets are also a great way to discern teams (the French are too easy with their UN helmets, and it applies to other teams too), though some classes don't have helmets in the first place, unfortunately."

ProjectReality,3cwgtc,Anon49,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:37:00 2015 UTC,"Shadowplay has a low GPU header (so does Dxtory) which means it will have minimal/no lag when recording, and it uses a h264/mp4 codec format so files don't take up much space compressing videos. So yeah, it's a big difference over FRAPS.  The only real reason why I use this over Dxtory is because you have to fine tune Dxtory's video codec settings to get the best out of it. Shadowplay is just easy mode, plus there's a macro that will save the last 20 minutes of footage EVEN if you weren't recording.  The catch with shadowplay is that it will only record ONE audio stream, and combine mic feedback/game audio together. You also need a graphics card from NVIDIA that supports it.

You'll want to look in the options for something along the lines of ""internet/connection options"". it should have two options: LAN and something else. It should be defaulted to LAN, but try switcihing it to the other one. You may need to try joining a server a couple times for the setting switch to fully work-I know I did.

This also happens on some maps even after 5 minutes has passed, continuing throughout the match.

ProjectReality,3ckm1i,nekowaiidesu,3,Wed Jul 8 17:21:06 2015 UTC,"There is bullet travel time in this game, and it is fairly close to realistic with unique values for different ammo types. There is bullet drop, but it is not at realistic levels (except for on vehicle MGs, where it is realistic). Bullet drop on infantry weapons only really takes effect at 600m and markings on scopes like the ACOG are not accurate. There is penetration on armored vehicles, but most vehicles have bulletproof glass that can only be penetrated by .50 cal and above. For suppression I may be wrong but I think to get suppressed the bullet has to land near you, not just fly over your head. The hit registration in this game is kind of silly. To score a hit, you must aim close to center of mass. The ""bloodbox,"" or hitbox in which blood will come out of the target, is not the same hitbox as the hitbox in which you actually deal damage. Also the hitbox on bots is laggy. For the rest of your problems, the issue could be deviation. If you don't know what this is, look up a video of it as it is way to complicated to explain here."
ProjectReality,3ckm1i,piratepengu,2,Wed Jul 8 17:34:31 2015 UTC,"The ""bloodbox"" is client side hit detection and is a only a visual effect."
ProjectReality,3ckm1i,Anon49,2,Wed Jul 8 18:04:53 2015 UTC,"BF2 works completely different than every single shooter out there. You simply do not hit where you aim. This isn't like CS where your deviation depends on your movespeed, It also depends on how much time since you last moved.  On some heavy weapons, moving the camera will also increase deviation.  You need to get used to the weapons and figure out what is the optimal waiting time in different ranges for different weapons. If the target hasn't seen you, take your time. When in doubt and when I have time, I count 7 seconds."
ProjectReality,3ckm1i,Anon49,2,Wed Jul 8 18:07:31 2015 UTC,"The major part of PR gun mechanics is deviation. To try to put it simply, deviation represent your soldier's aim being imperfect. So if you're sprinting and then quickly aim up your rifle, your shots are going to be all over the place, and you'll have trouble hitting anything beyond short range. On the other hand, if you're standing still (especially crouched or prone), and wait a few seconds before you shoot (at a slow RoF), you can hit targets out to the edge of the view distance fog.   This video is a great little (10 minutes) deviation tutorial. However, do note that I think deviation was patched, sometime between that tutorial and now, to be a little less severe. Also, Google-searching ""Project Reality Deviation"" gets all sorts of additional resources, particularly up-to-date ones.  If you have the chance (in Co-op, offline, or downtime during an online game), try grabbing an AR, deploying it, and letting off a few rounds after waiting for certain time intervals (no wait time, a couple seconds wait time, several seconds wait time) for a great, if a bit extreme, way to see how deviation works firsthand."
ProjectReality,3ckm1i,Its_a_Friendly,2,Wed Jul 8 19:34:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks all. I have watched the deviation video before and understand the idea lol :)   What I'd be more curious to see are any snipers actually making kills over 600m. Whenever I've tried to snipe (even against bots to test drop / travel time) I seldom even find targets over 400m and even with pretty good aim and using the 'steady breath' feature I find that it's damn hard to kill even a stationary target unless you go for a headshot.  Why is bullet drop for handguns so unrealistic yet vehicle weapons are not?  Edit: I've got the gist of shooting and do pretty well at the normal ranges with rifle especially with optics. The bullet travel time has never been noticeable with the handguns which is why I'm more curious about sniping.  There are some other weird things I'd like to ask about too.. (1) Sometimes the guys on vehicle mounted guns don't seem to die? It may have to do with the bloodbox vs hitbox, or do vehicles like techies have invisible parts to them?  (2) Does buckshot actually travel until it hits something or does it 'disappear' when it reaches a max range? I've fired off a few shells at a guy who couldn't have been more than 60m away then he turned around and shot me once. I was instantly suppressed and had to run away or risk bleeding out / a second bullet... I might be wrong but I thought a 12g shotgun is able to wound or kill effectively up to 80+ meters but I don't even know if I was even suppressing him at all lol.  Is the shotty spread just REALLY chaotic or does the shot just vanish somewhere after a certain range?"

ProjectReality,3clida,Philrow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:52:08 2015 UTC,"If I remember right, the ranges were corrected for them in 1.3. So those numbers actually correspond with where it's going to hit.  It's not what what I'm talking about though. I'm talking about that curved line with the numbers on the right corner. Does that correspond with how far away the person is?"

ProjectReality,3cd2wi,szynka,9,Mon Jul 6 23:41:17 2015 UTC,"First establish he can hear you on comms. If he can't, type in squad that you're going to kick him and why (encourage him to get headphones/mic). I'm usually fairly polite about this.  If he does have comms give one really clear verbal warning. There may be a legitimate excuse stopping him from carrying out instructions.  If he keeps ignoring orders, kick him and then explain to the rest of the squad why you kicked him. More often than not this pulls a squad closer together because your squad members may be just as pissed at one guy letting the rest down. Explaining briefly to them also prevents any misunderstanding.  As for when to kick him, that's a personal judgement.. if you can get some benefit out of him in a specific situation, wait for that situation to be over and then kick. Whatever you do, don't just tolerate it in general."
ProjectReality,3cd2wi,paul-n,5,Tue Jul 7 00:17:20 2015 UTC,"Yes but when they keep rejoining? What about the loss of his role/kit? This doesn't really address those problems.   If they keep rejoining you can just lock the squad for a few minutes until he gets bored and joins another squad. As for your kit, I think you're likely just SOL. Do your thing until another one of your squad members dies and have him take the role.    Or you can wait until the bad squad member dies, kick him then, and nab his kit from his corpse. He also won't be able to join again until he respawns (or am I remembering this wrong?).   The problem with waiting for him to die, is that every minute you go with an unresponsive, back-talking squad member, it harms the discipline of your squad. If some new guy joins a squad and sees people running around ignoring each other, he's going to get the message the squad is SHITFANTRY(©) not Infantry and play the part. But when you join a squad where it's clearly disciplined and communicative, they get the message real quick.   So you don't want this guy in your squad for long.. it can definitely be a problem and sometimes you just have to admit a really persistent retard can do irreparable damage to your squad."
ProjectReality,3cd2wi,slappymcnutface,2,Tue Jul 7 05:07:43 2015 UTC,"Yup good points.  I've done a lot of squad leading and never come across someone constantly rejoining squad after being kicked so I misinterpreted the question.  Locking squad is a good idea and to clarify I only suggest keeping him in the squad for a couple of minutes if it suits you to have that unresponsive medic in the middle of a firefight (same with an unresponsive breacher when attacking a cache or a shit LAT with an APC rolling around). 99% of the time I'd kick straight away and have another squad member take over the role.  Shit like this is why I always have 2 medics, because it's hard to find people you can really rely on to take the role solo.   If some new guy joins a squad and sees people running around ignoring each other, he's going to get the message the squad is SHITFANTRY(©) not Infantry and play the part. But when you join a squad where it's clearly disciplined and communicative, they get the message real quick   100% agree, setting the tone is vital.. I see so many SLs wondering why their squad isn't following them when they're not being consistent in their orders or consistent in their approach to people ignoring those orders."

Especially when I'm making a fresh INF squad and there's a few already established (with no space for me), I keep the shitters in the squad until I need the space. I don't mind people lone-wolfing in my squad, since it gets me an Officer kit and my actual squad-mates some useful kits. I'll kick them if they're spamming the radio an annoying amount, and I'll kick them the moment the squad's full, to make space for useful squad-mates that are out there."

Preordering a game is like a business investor deciding on giving funding to a couple of college kids that just show an example of some technology in the lab. Without the chain of support or distribution or market analysis, no matter how cool that technology is, its completely pointless to the investor if no-one is going to buy it.

ProjectReality,3c67ii,Anon49,2,Sun Jul 5 05:49:29 2015 UTC,"OBS is open source. There's no trail or buying. It is not locked to 25fps, and it uses NVENC with more options.  Who the fuck told you that bullshit? I've recorded full rounds at 1440p60fps at 30mbps."

I know in the heat of the action I sometimes keep holding left mouse button as well, so as soon as I start placing it I start spamming my RIGHT mouse button, just so I dont fuck up.  The reason you can't keep holding left mouse button is that as soon as you drop the IED, you'd activate the phone.

ProjectReality,3bvqua,TheMadMati,6,Thu Jul 2 15:26:49 2015 UTC,I skimmed through the video and it looked like a great round. I've played multiple games where the final score is 1 - 0 and it always catches me by surprise.
ProjectReality,3bvqua,Viral_Krieger,2,Thu Jul 2 17:06:07 2015 UTC,"I started this round on MEC and shortly after we got fobs set up on the northwest side of the city my game crashed. When I got back in I was on British side and it seemed like we were doing okay, the squad I joined was on the front lines assaulting those MEC fobs and I ran to catch up knowing my medkit would be severely needed. I got there and we were doing pretty good camping in the H building.   Then the squadlead ordered us to assault the fob which led to the squad getting wiped Thus began about 15 minutes of the squad trying to get back into a decent position for either offense or defense. Another wipe from an APC and there was a last ditch effort to defend / recap the last flag.   I think the game may have ended by someone giving up, there were a few people yelling constantly for medics to revive them. These people had been foolish enough to go out in the street trying to rush head on at strongly held enemy positions so there was no way I was going out there to try to stick them with an epi.  When the score popped up I was astonished, I thought about the 3-4 deaths that I had, the few times where I couldn't revive someone, the decisions of our squad leader. All those things I thought about which could have changed that 1 ticket to be on our side. This is kinda what PR is too me, the gritty games where any decision can affect the outcome whether its made by the commander, a squad leader, or a simple grunt.   Tl;dr: Saw the round at different times from both sides. Had a good time even though I ended up on the 0 side."

The download comes in the form of an “ISO”-file. To install it depends on your operation system:  Windows 8 and beyond feature mounting as part of the Operating System. Right click the ISO and select Mount or double click the ISO. This will start the installer.  If you are on windows 7 or below you have a few options:  a. Burn it to a DVD.  b. Mount the ISO file using free software such as Virtual CloneDrive.  c. Extract the ISO file using free software such as 7-Zip or WinRar.   You even have links to said software on the manual.

ProjectReality,3buzb4,Esil-,5,Thu Jul 2 10:57:44 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the military talk. This is one of the few games where it's actually appropriate and that says a lot about PR as a game.   I'd much rather have someone confirm an order that I gave them as a squad leader by saying roger rather than saying nothing and wandering off to the middle of nowhere.  Now, this doesn't mean you have to get weird about it and get antsy when someone says ""can you repeat that"" rather than ""say again"". Danger close is also appropriate because that, to me, says get your nades out and start throwing them at the cardinal direction because they're danger close.  Yes, some people can go overboard with it, but to say it isn't really appropriate in a game like PR is just as much as a circlejerk as the people who overuse it. Useless comms to me as a squad leader is when my squad members are talking about useless crap like what they're eating for dinner. My squad members acknowledging their orders is fine though, as is 'danger close' and some of the other things. ""How copy"" is kind of pointless as the receiving person can just use ""say again"".  Edit: I'm not going to buckle down on squad chat if we're standing somewhere defending on point and nothing is happening. It helps pass the time. I'll only tell them to hold comms if I need to speak with the commander or other squads regarding what's going on and I'll tell them why they're holding comms and when it's okay to speak again."
ProjectReality,3buzb4,paradoxpancake,2,Thu Jul 2 16:36:12 2015 UTC,"So many people talking, nothing happening. You really need to keep your squad in order. lots of uneeded ""rogers"" and ""how copys"" ""danger close"", keep coms short sweet and on point."

ProjectReality,3buzb4,Anon49,-6,Thu Jul 2 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"I watched one minute and cringed out.   There was no tow. its an HMG with a stationary AA. Your squad of 8 people didn't even notice an enemy FOB being built right next to you? Zero situational awareness. Not once you reported this contact to the team. You never opened squad lead radio to warn people about it. You didn't mark it on the map with your radio. I would personally be fucking pissed at you if there was actually a TOW there and it would have destroyed the friendly tank next to you. You never asked the friendly Tank standing 100m away from you to assist with AT-less infantry at long range. Are you sure you're playing PR? This looks like Call of duty to me. Not once you talked to other squads. YOU NEVER REPORTED THE AA BEHIND FRIENDLY LINES   Lets continue with the analyzing: Look at squad 4, in the trans chopper. At 0:37 he dies right above the enemy fob. At 0:45 he reports to whole team when he died: ""There's enemy AA near the radio tower"" Good job, You caused your transport chopper to die by not reporting shit.  Then there's Kilgore  not understanding that he needs to hold left click and not tap it, and dies on the tow, and no one notices his mistake. But that's sort of forgivable because its a recent change from 1.3.  I can't tell if your cas crashed to desktop or actually died to the AA. Your mic was muted, did you tell them about the AA?  Disno asks me why am i so negative and why do I hate some servers. This video is exactly why. Please learn the game before you squad lead. You people turned armor gameplay from ""Stick with infantry to survive"" to ""Go around enemy lines and not worry about dying because no body reported you""."

Games are supposed to be fun, that's why we play them-- otherwise what's the point.  If you want to act like the real military because you're too lazy to join the real thing, do it on your own locked server with your own group, don't critique someone for learning and enjoying a game."
ProjectReality,3buzb4,Anon49,-2,Thu Jul 2 14:51:02 2015 UTC,"PR has nothing to do with ""real military"". PR is not a milsim. PR is not even close to milsim and it was never the intention to be a milsim. I've spent 3 years in said ""real military"" and that is completely irrelevant to PR. PR is a teamwork game based on communication, which he is doing none of it.  PR is not fun when your team does not communicate. PR is not fun when you drive an APC next to a friendly squad to cover them only to get shot by a TOW on top of a hill no one bothered spotting or reporting. PR is not fun when played casually. If I want to play relaxing games I boot up TF2.  You don't need to lead a squad to learn the game. Its just like admins would kick people who crash helis in main because they're trying to learn them."

I think someone attempted to do the Gaz-2975. As a tester, I can tell you that there are many things in the works that will greatly improve the game in upcoming patches, but a massive update of one existing faction like you suggest is very unlikely, simply because - to make a new vehicle - the effort to make it happen is extremely high. There are other factions that have a real lack of vehicle diversity and should have priority over updating the Russians.  You better wait for Falklands, WW2 and other content and enjoy that :) !"

ProjectReality,3bqqy6,AFatDarthVader,3,Thu Jul 2 20:30:48 2015 UTC,"The T-80 is being retired from service by the end of this year.  The BTR-90 was never purchased for use by the Russian military. It has been produced in extremely limited numbers.  The Tigr has yet to see widespread deployment. It's unlikely that a regular Russian fighting force would have Tigrs at their disposal.    I don't have numbers on the optics. I'm fairly certain the grenade change is correct, though. The Limonka is only used for training now, I think. The Kord is definitely more common, as well.  For gameplay reasons I doubt many of these will be implemented."
ProjectReality,3bqqy6,AFatDarthVader,0,Wed Jul 1 17:12:36 2015 UTC,"The Russian Armed Forces still has about 180 active and 4,500 reserve T-80s that would likely be used against internal conflicts. The Russian Navy has about 90 BTR-90s that would be used in a primary amphibious landing, deployed from hovercrafts of carriers. The Tigr has been deployed in Crimea and has been seen in the hands of seperatists, if Russia gives the Tigr to seperatists then there is no doubt it would be used in large numbers in times of conflict. There are multiple pictures of Russian soldiers in Crimea using the 1P63.   I also doubt these will be implemented (allthough I dont see how it changes gameplay for the worst), but maybe in Squad they wont neglect the Russians as they do in PR."

Here is a press release: http://www.military-informant.com/index.php/army/3585-1.html The BTR-90 was rejected by the Ministry of Defense in 2011. Here's an article on it: http://svpressa.ru/economy/news/49310/. As far as I know, the only operator of the BTR-90 is the Russian MVD, not the Navy. I'd have to see a source on the Navy. The MVD's total is estimated around ~80, but even 90 is a paltry number which would make it quite rare. The Tigr was deployed to Crimea because that was not a regular fighting force. It is still rare to see a Russian unit with Tigrs or Volks. I've seen the pictures of the Russian soldiers in Crimea with the 1P63, but it's unlikely that those were regular Russian soldiers with general issue equipment. I would have to see statistics to know if the optic was common.   Gameplay would be affected as faction balance would change. The maps are set up with PR's current assets in mind. Improving one factions assets and equipment changes that balance."

Rally points despawn because it would be too powerful of a tool if it didn't. If you place a rally close enough to a flag or FOB it lasts longer, though.  I'm not entirely sure why the option to spawn on other squad's rallies is an option, but I assume the devs just don't have a way to remove the option for other squads."

There are way too many (and I fucking hate this term, but it applies here) casuals that come in, and do stupid shit without realizing that they are ruining the experience for the entire team, and the admins cannot keep up with it, and its not fair for them to dedicate enough time to this when they want to play as well.   The absolute worst is when there are like 2 one man squads, no more squad slots left, and your team doesn't have fobs. Then you join on the of the one man squads, trying to talk to the guy in mumble or chat to give you SL so you can build fobs, but he is literally too autistic to pay attention to either."

ProjectReality,3blid1,serfmaa,3,Tue Jun 30 04:49:53 2015 UTC,I like that it's quick and down to the very basics needed to play the game. Good job serfmaa.  I would have preferred if it wasn't insurgents as it's a different type of faction that plays very differently than most. New players should really learn how to play a conventional faction as insurgents don't boast the most teamwork oriented gameplay.  To make it more complete you should have a rally point in the spawn section. Tired of seeing new players spawning on my rally point and getting teleported to main or killed on some maps.  Also a mention of the compass chevron that points to the squad leader marker would be useful.  And you could suggest that people select the squad before joining and seeing on the map if they are together and if the squad leader has an officer kit. That usually means it's a squad that is working together.  I think you could add these things and still keep it very short and useful.
ProjectReality,3blid1,muitocomplicado,2,Tue Jun 30 23:40:20 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I could've expanded on some things a lot more, but, I'm going to leave that for the next few videos.

ProjectReality,3bjcsb,NationalForensic,10,Mon Jun 29 18:24:49 2015 UTC,"This is really important thing that noobs and people who have never lead a squad need to understand. SLs have tons a different voices in their ears. They are constantly looking at the map to figure out where their team is and where the enemy is. They are marking locations of enemy positions and tracking enemy armor. Leading a squad has to be done at the same time as helping the other SLs. When they give you a move marker and tell you to move, you need to do it. They don't have the time to hold your hand and lead you to the next position. Some orders are bad, some work through dumb luck, some get you wiped. But that's part of the experience."
ProjectReality,3bjcsb,PenguinScientist,3,Mon Jun 29 18:57:49 2015 UTC,"Well and at the same time, you have to balance that with the fact that you see things and know things that the squadlead doesn't know, just as they know and see things that you don't... so you have to be able to think for yourself as well, while implementing their orders."

ProjectReality,3bjcsb,kshock,5,Tue Jun 30 01:31:33 2015 UTC,It's mentioned in most of the replies but as a squad lead you have to deal with up to 10 channels of communication + local. For the love of god do not spam squad radio with pointless shit. Do not spam it with casual speculation. Take 95% of non combat comms to local OR squad text chat. Not many think of it but green squad chat is perfect for talking not only in loud vehicles but when you wanna crack a joke or shoot the shit during some down time.

ProjectReality,3bjxwz,name_witheld,3,Tue Jun 30 04:49:12 2015 UTC,I just had a Medic do this to me today. I think it's a bug because he was surprised when I said I was still bleeding. The Medic's health display probably isn't accurate all of the time.
ProjectReality,3bjxwz,PinkFloydJoe,2,Tue Jun 30 01:43:51 2015 UTC,"And for the love of fuck, don't stick someone with your epi, then leave, letting him die permanently, rather than just be wounded. Especially because we can't see shit to help ourselves."
ProjectReality,3bjxwz,Zrk2,2,Tue Jun 30 18:38:26 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you can't hang around and heal after the epipen or you'll both be dead. In those circumstances you can at least speak in local and tell the guy to run when he's revived. Tell him to follow your voice if he can't see anything. Have the medkit ready, possibly even healing him while running backwards.   For the love of jebus please only have one medic run to a wounded soldier especially if he's in a dangerous location... I've only been playing a few days and I've seen swarms of medics trying to heal one guy and ALL ending up dead, then the rest of the squad goes down trying to get the medics kit. Don't. Just.. Don't."

ProjectReality,3bjr7b,ryanjc12,2,Tue Jun 30 01:12:05 2015 UTC,"Thank Christ. I've looked through multiple Reddit and PR Forum posts about this issue and not a single person has said the real answer.   I actually figured out the hyperthreading issue an hour or so before you said this, but all the other things you said made it even better.  Hyperthreading was causing my 6 core to be 12 cores, none of which were too powerful, and because PR can only run one core, it was like I had a weak CPU. Thank you for all the other steps too."
ProjectReality,3bjr7b,LiamOS,2,Tue Jun 30 05:26:41 2015 UTC,"Are you sure the GTX card is being used for PR? Check in your nvidia control panel.  But PR is based on the BF2 engine, which is essentially all compiled to run on a single(maybe dual?) core CPU, so most of your CPU and GPU are not being used for the most part. AFAIK clock rate makes the biggest difference in PR."
ProjectReality,3bjr7b,Rqller,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:15:15 2015 UTC,"I know that the game doesn't utilize my rig to the fullest due to the engines age, but other people with the same rig (or close to it, in a few cases worse) were getting 75+ FPS when I was getting 25. I really don't think it's a hardware issue but I can't figure out what's wrong.   As far as making sure my 980 is being used, I looked through the Nvidia Control Panel and couldn't find any option that changed what video device was being used. With that said, I assume my card is being used because my motherboard doesn't even have onboard video, so I don't think it can run through anything else! Ha.  I really appreciate the help, by the way. I've played PR on and off for six years now, and I've always had a low quality PC, so I've had to deal with lag. After finally upgrading my PC to be really good, I was excited to not lag in PR, only to find I lag just as much if not more than I did before! Highly discouraging. Everything else runs great. I'm playing Arma 3 on Ultra and it's running fine!  Edit: I found the setting for forcing the 980 to be used, but it was already selected. As I assumed, it was the only option. I don't know what to do from here. I heard updating my DirectX might help, but the microsoft website is so   clunky I can't figure out where I would do that."

ProjectReality,3bifdm,Legato895,0,Sat Jul 4 16:31:22 2015 UTC,I forget what the squad bug is - sometimes I have to spawn in before picking a squad which is annoying. Also if a squad is locked it may be hard to tell since the icon is very low contrast.   As for spawning there are 2 potential issues:  1 - you can't spawn on squad rally points unless you are in the squad. So any spawn button with a number is a no go.   2 - when failing to spawn on a fob just keep trying. If too many people are spawning in your request won't go through and there is no error message. It usually doesn't take more than 3 attempts at the most.   Hope this helps.
ProjectReality,3bifdm,Anon49,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:28:03 2015 UTC,"I forget what the squad bug is - sometimes I have to spawn in before picking a squad which is annoying   That is not the famous squad bug, nor this is a bug at all. Its a balance feature implemented in vanilla 1.4 to prevent people from choosing a squad leader spawn point every time they spawn. It was not like that before vanilla 1.4.   You cannot join squads when dead unless you've just joined the server."

Anyways, if you're into infantry make sure you find a squad that has a squad leader that has a microphone, is actually communicating, and is actually using an officer kit. That's what I look for. I start to memorize names so when I see them lead again I'll jump with them again because I know what they're doing.  Sometimes you're going to get into games where none of the squads have actual leaders that are actually communicating at all, simply don't have a mic, or are full.

I play SL 90% of the time and nothing grinds my gears like people that want me to have all the responsibility but none of the authority that requires. Please refrain from getting kits just because you personally want them. Riflemen are the most important and overlooked kit in the game, and allow support kits to function properly. Avoid backseat driving and second guessing every movement and decision the SL makes(You aren't the one listening to squad and command radios, and thus you are out of the loop on high-level coordination. It's pretty annoying when folks with a fraction of the info you have try to give you bullshit whenever you make a decision. Especially impatient people that don't want to have to defend places.).

The only problem I have is when they take the kit then run off and don't follow orders, which is sadly about 90% of all marksmen do, but that 10% can be extremely useful."
ProjectReality,3b9kse,StratBacker,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:48:34 2015 UTC,"My problems with it are what you've listed, as well as them just not really having any specially useful. They're not particularly more 'accurate' or 'powerful' than your standard scoped rifleman kit, and riflemen carry ammo bags, which is EXTREMELY useful for support weapons like AT, AR, and medics.  A dinky rifle with a slightly better scope is just extremely situational and never really worth the squad slot, IMO. I just kick people that grab it(They never ask first anyway). I've yet to really find a situation where I needed someone dead at long range that we couldn't kill with our rifles or AR's. Actual sniper kits are ridiculously rare because no one wants them in their squad, so I don't feel particularly pressed to prepare for countering one."
ProjectReality,3b9kse,Sedition7988,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:50:04 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Like I said it's very situation specific, and would only take one in an 8 man squad. Anything less and it is a wasted slot that could be used for a second medic or a rifleman."
ProjectReality,3b9kse,StratBacker,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:31:36 2015 UTC,"I've played off and on since the beginning and unfortunately find this to be part of the experience. At the end of the day I play 3 games to have one that stands out. Those three games don't have to be a waste, but the tend to include squad leaders sending us to our deaths over and over or locked/full hero squads.   I know it's not for everybody but insurgency mode can kind of help since the insurgency arguably doesn't 'need' teamwork as much to succeed.  Beyond that this game isn't for everybody but I and many others find the promise of a good game to make up for the duds.   Good luck!"
ProjectReality,3b9kse,Legato895,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:01:43 2015 UTC,"Well, what are some specific problems? Giving tips for the whole game at once would be a lot of text.  As for game balance: unfortunately, there can be some bad games. With a small server and player count, that can happen pretty easily. But when you get a game where, after 600-800 tickets, the final score is 10-0 or less (I've seen two 1-0's in my experience), with the chat just erupting when that ""Round is ending..."" test pops up, it is just so very much redeemed. That feeling of a very close match is a major reason why I love this game so much.  And also, if a game is going really poorly, take that chance to try something different, or experiment a bit! For example, I love trying out Rifleman AP or Sapper when I'm losing as insurgents."

Servers: PRTA, Pelikula, HOG  Squads: When on the initial squad screen, click the squad numbers. This will highlight all the members of a squad. If all of the members are nearby one another, it's probably a cohesive squad. If they're spread across the map in all sorts of different assets, it's probably not a very good squad."
ProjectReality,3b9kse,POVFox,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:41:22 2015 UTC,"You're right, OP, the really fun matches are the ones where it's hard to tell which team is going to win. It's boring and demoralizing when you realize either your team is a mess, or the other team is.  It's usually less like this. The recent increase in the size of the community means there's a lot of new players who are still learning how to play as a team, and also learning basic stuff. If you end up on a team where there just happens to be no qualified trans pilots, or an insurgent team where nobody knows how to operate the rocket techie (which, honestly, I still don't either), then it's gonna suck.  So we have to give the community time to train up all the new players. And in the meantime, if the team is really not much of a team, you have to focus on having a squad experience that's an adventure. It also lowers the intimidation level of squadleading... so try leading a squad and using it as a learning experience."

""Helicopters + Fast Rope""... So if we don't get a mil, we don't see Helis.. which we've had since day 1 of Mod.. I know they going a little more Infantry style. But then that also leads to my next, Role Customization. I'd think this be something on by default by now in 2015.. Esp for Squad. Be able to decide which scope to throw on or off or even carry like in A3 if needed later in a fight. Choose AT4 or LAW. Etc etc.   Then a Training Mode? Also something that should of been default, esp with a new IP title.   Stats I can see being last, that's not gameplay related, but idk. I want Squad to be great, but I also don't see eye to eye on what they asking and then what they gonna do. Progress looks great so far.   But as I said, their goals scare me. Goals that really shouldn't of been goals and more of included by default, esp after the lessons and feedback we gotten from PR mod days.   I'd throw $100 down if I could. As a indie UE4 dev myself, I am stoked for Squad and Ground Branch, and the progress being done in UE4 is faster then ever in dev speak.   I also know first hand, there is no excuse to not have Helis/Tanks in UE4.. When I have tested and done them myself in my own indie time in UE4..   I maybe wanting to much of a PR with UE4 level, but I'm also not even sick of BF2 PR, so I can easily wait for Squad to get all features."

I'm not sure if you've seen my helo video I've posted on YouTube or not but you can see how I land that way. Make sure when you land that you realize pitching/rolling the chopper in any direction in even a TINY amount will take it a far way. Tiny adjustments go a far way.

The only time a crash is ever excusable is when you are damaged and loosing controllability, or your game lags or glitches right as you are touching down. PR doesn't have any random effects that can mess you up, and in 99% of the situations, you are not taking fire at main as you are landing. If you can remember the last time you fucked up and crashed on a landing, you need to go practice more  until you can land a hypothetical 1000 times in a row.   The reason behind this is that assets like CAS jets or any helos are absolutely vital to success, not to mention an automatic -10 tickets.  If a team looses both of its transport helos, you are pretty much guaranteed a loss. And if you loose a CAS jet, that is 20 minutes that their jet can have free reign of the sky, and with squad leaders that are actually laser designating targets, that is the most deadly weapon in the game as there is no defense against a jet who can pop into visual range just to lock on, release ordinance, and then climb out of visual range.   And I know its just a game, but the thing with PR is like others have said, 1 guy can ruin the experience for the 49 other players on his team.  So please, its not hard to land either a jet or a heli, so if you fly or want to fly, go get TEST_AIRFIELD and practice until you get it perfect, and more importantly can sense and correct a shitty landing attempt."

ProjectReality,3ayvry,-Strategos-,7,Wed Jun 24 16:39:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Here's why PR is not fit for streaming:   intelligence on enemy positions and assets is paramount to getting kills in PR (and winning the round, but I guess that's not what most stream-snipers are interested in). Much more so than any other shooter out there. rounds spanning over several hours means that even with a delayed stream you will always provide game-ruining intel to stream-snipers the low number of servers compared to other games makes stream-sniping very easy. Server messages and player names provide an easy avenue to discovering the streamer's server, if they don't disclose it themselves. in no other game can the actions of one player have such a detrimental effect on so many others. One streamer on one team and one stream-sniper on the other can ruin the gameplay experience for 98 players on a server. as a result there is a much higher motivation to stream-snipe in PR than there is in any other shooter. The effort-reward ratio is very low and will attract people who might otherwise not stream-snipe. monetarily speaking, streaming PR does not pay off. Viewer counts are in the single digit range and with the 1.3-craze slowing down it will be like this for the foreseeable future. The community is just too small to develop a large enough viewerbase. if you are streaming PR to promote the game you are doing the community a disservice. Streams do not capture the intensity of actual gameplay and instead bring the ""long suck"" between firefights into the foreground. If you play PR you will know that these slower parts of the game can be just as exciting (what with the constant threat of ambushes, etc.), but this does not communicate well over a stream or raw footage. If you want people to experience PR vicariously, video highlights are the way to go.   All these points taken into account, streaming PR just doesn't pay off: Neither for you, nor your viewers, nor the community at large. So please don't do it.  Edit: typos and stuff"
ProjectReality,3ayvry,deadweight212,5,Wed Jun 24 17:28:48 2015 UTC,"in no other game can the actions of one player have such a detrimental effect on so many others. One streamer on one team and one stream-sniper on the other can ruin the gameplay experience for 98 players on a server.   You've got good points, and you're correct in terms of PR, but there are plenty of games where streaming is much more detrimental to a large group. Think any MMO where loss is real; like Eve online."
ProjectReality,3ayvry,-Strategos-,2,Wed Jun 24 18:50:14 2015 UTC,True. Faction-based MMOs like EVE are a completely different beast altogether in terms of what's at stake.

ProjectReality,3ayvry,KilrBe3,4,Wed Jun 24 18:09:08 2015 UTC,"I rather not tiptoe into this but pretty much yea, I thought about this after someone on CIA server raged a huge fit at a Admin for streaming, yet he had a 30min delay on.  Even then, no one was happy.   Problems are explained below in details, but pretty much, anything over 5min delay, and you are not gonna follow chat or anything. At this stage you might as well Record and upload highlights like 99.99% of the rest of PR players do.  Now, Should you be banned? Like in OP title and how aggressive I've seen some players towards it? No.   Should servers maybe rethink it and put in rules? Maybe. That's not up to us, its admins/owners.   But should we ban right off the bat when there is no rule? No. Kindly tell em why and be kind. Everyone I've seen that said they have/or might, was pretty much put on the block for their head to be chopped off even before they said 'Hello'.  TL:DR: it doesn't help/or gain you or your viewers or the team, so just don't stream PR, its just not the Streaming game."

No one knew about my stream nor was watching it that was actually playing Project Reality on the server I was on. Someone decided to watch, join in, then tell everyone to then watch and let the admins know. Prior to that point, streaming was perfectly OK. I did not ""raged a huge fit at an Admin for streaming"" nor had a 30 minute delay on. I was upset that he kicked me when I was in the middle of trying to get to cover near a cache to where I could stop the stream and place a delay, after I had said that.   Of course no one was happy that I was streaming, until they knew about it and everyone was watching. If they had known that no one was watching except for a few friends interested in the game and a few random regulars, I'm sure there would've been less haste to getting so upset about it.  Most servers go by ""admin's decision is final/rule"" so it was within their right to kick me for streaming, and any others, though they should slap it in the rules just so other new players know to not stream else be punished accordingly."

PR isn't some game that is made to be popular to everyone or easy to play.   Just think about the mindset of someone who wants to start streaming PR. First, you don't understand how knowledge brings a huge advantage to a side, and how stream cheating ruins the game for everyone. Secondly, you have to be delusional about the views you will get (Ive honestly see no more than 5 on any of the 1 or 2 PR streams on Twitch), and you are wasting more in electricity in having extra load on your CPU to stream the game compared to any potential add revenue you bring in. And you choose to stream instead of recording game-play and publishing it on youtube, which is in all ways going to be more profitable in terms of ads even if you are not aware of the imbalance streaming achieves.   IMHO, the type of person that chooses to stream PR doesn't have the mentality to play PR in the first place, even if he wasn't streaming. Its not about being spiteful or elitist, its just trying to keep the player base somewhat decent so that everyone can enjoy the game. Its fine if somebody new takes an APC without knowing about squad rules, you can warn him before administrative action, and he learns and life goes on.   But with people who stream, its like warning them after they intentionally tked someone for a kit or a vehicle that does not belong to them. It should be a ban  Not to mention that they may do something stupid like blow up the bomb truck in main, just for the ""hilarity"" factor and to get some reaction out of the 3 people in chat."

It should be a ban   This where we see different.. If you aren't even gonna bother asking them to not stream on the server, and just ban, then that's fucked up. Or if it not in rules. Gotta remember, new players are in PR now too. If all admins went ban happy, PR would of dead ages ago.   It's like a speed limit, you can't just ticket someone saying they speeding without having a speed limit sign up. Same for streaming. I understand your points and the anger, and I expressed them too. But you just jumping the gun and straight to the hammer."
ProjectReality,3ayvry,Necramonium,-5,Wed Jun 24 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"Dude its not that hard.  Imagine some guy on insurgent was just typing all chat, saying shit like ""Hey, Bluefor, our unknown is in B3, and by the way, we have mines on the main road , and a FOB going up in E3"", and does so the entire match.   Even though that is not explicitly against any server rules, do you think that this person should be given a warning? Or do you think that maybe he should be just banned because he is either trolling, or is beyond fucking retarded if he thinks what he is doing is no big deal?  Streaming is EXACTLY equivalent to that.   And disrupting gameplay is against many server rules, that puts an umbrella over things like trolling TK's, ghosting, and other things, and that is a bannable offense on many servers. Streaming falls right under this as well since it majorly disrupts gameplay."

It can be cool but it will not change the dynamics of the game. Give the Syrian Army ak's instead of the g3 or other MEC guns.  The MEC should also be redesigned and rearmed. Remove the Saudi government infantry loadout(g3,mg3 and other german guns) and give them a russian loadout which can be more realistic since they are already using russian assets apart from that scorpion."
ProjectReality,3au379,jinek67,3,Tue Jun 23 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the MEC really should be fully redesigned. Right now, they're a mix of Western and Russian stuff (G3's and BTR's, etc.) which is fairly representative of the area as a whole. After all, you have to mix Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran (which all apparently use the G3) against Iraq, Syria, etc. And the MEC is not really the most realistic thing in the world anyhow.

Even when you're not saving the day (read: doing a constant and thankless job—a bit like the goal-keeper of your team) it's quite unlike anything I've experienced on other games.   It's just a totally different style, knowing you shouldn't go first into the breach, that you shouldn't expose yourself, and that (especially in pre-1.1 or whenever Medics only had iron-sights) your fire is principally suppression—you won't be getting (m)any kills today. It really makes you think more about positioning, cover, and all the other aspects of successful squad-play that aren't just shooting bad guys.   Everyone should know how to medic (yes, you). But I also highly encourage everyone to really learn the style, and hopefully enjoy it as much as I do."

ProjectReality,3aqv5a,Its_a_Friendly,7,Tue Jun 23 21:01:25 2015 UTC,"My major problem when being a medic (which is a role that I really like-so many points, hah!) is having people getting grouped way too close together. Say I've revived someone and is now healing them up-someone else will run right next to me and try to get healed too. Even though I think there's a way to do it just right where you heal two people at once, I think it is a terrible idea, as you're perfect grenade/machinegun/RPG bait. Go space out a bit, cover a different approach (seriously, people being healed near combat need to do this, as I can't shooting while healing people), and then I'll get to them. If they're seriously bleeding, I'll toss them a patch or do a quick touch-up to keep them alive.  But seriously, people really should use that call-medic right-click option so much more. I then don't have to search through bushes or try to listen over the sounds of battle to find people."

Instead of saying something over chat or VOIP, he finds me on the map, shoots one bullet by my head to suppress me, then drops his kit at my feet.  He didn't bother to notice we were sneaking up on a compound and his single shot (first shot) exposed us and got us all killed."

ProjectReality,3aqv5a,rantbox21,3,Tue Jun 23 19:38:57 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that calling for a medic on the map creates sound that's audible to the enemy. Sometimes that's not an option.  A couple other things: medics need support! So when someone in my squad goes down, and the medic's stepping in to help them out, I'll often say ""ok I'm with you too"" and guard the medic while they're doing their thing.  One more thing: medics need to know whether there's still danger, and what direction it's coming from. If you've got fire coming from one or two directions, throw smoke in those directions. It's better to throw smoke between the patient and the enemy than right on the patient."

Some people really take issue with the use of voice commands, since as /u/NationalForensic said, it creates noise the enemy can hear (and betrays intentions, baits out friendlies—if you're calling for medic and not respawning, clearly someone's on their way).   That being said, I don't play PR to win like I (occasionally) do on sweat-tier Dota and other like games; I play to have fun. Hell, I even use commo-rose voice comms all the time, when I'm SL-ing and moving out, when I want people to fall back, most of the time when I'm reloading. Naturally, those who are super-focused on gaming the hell out of PR's flaws for a minute advantage can bite me.

ProjectReality,3aqv5a,Kenny_Twenty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:41:39 2015 UTC,"it's the in-game command that makes your character shout pre-recorded messages.  the problem is a) they are rarely useful or in context (mumble is better in ever single case, except when calling out for medic on the map) and b) the enemy car hear you from a long distance, both of which will piss off your squad leader.  I will add the ONLY time you should use the commo rose, is when the medic specifically asks you to do so:  Player A: ""I'm down, need a medic"" Medic: ""Where are you? Call out on the map"" Player A: <calls out using commo rose>  The other time it will be used is when the SL is using commands such as attack and calling in air strikes.  Squad players should not use commo rose, I guarantee experieced SLs will not appreciate it."
ProjectReality,3aqv5a,NationalForensic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:47:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I can see why that would be a problem.
ProjectReality,3aqv5a,Tea2theBag,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:50:15 2015 UTC,"the main problem is the enemy can hear that from a long distance (at least 50-100m in some cases).  So even if the enemy know you are in the area, they won't know exactly where.  Until some asshat shouts ""CHANGING MAGS"" and tells the enemy you're exactly on the 3rd floor of the building directly NE of them.  tl;dr – mumble every time unless specifically asked otherwise. the medic is always in charge."

ProjectReality,3aqv5a,serfmaa,2,Tue Jun 23 13:58:46 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify a little. I use mumble in almost all of these situations as first preference, with Medic and Ammo as exceptions, as they provide additional information (who needs medical aid, who has Rifleman kits). Sometimes, maybe when I'm already talking/listening (frequently as I SL) or can't talk (on the phone etc.) I'll use to commo-rose instead, since I like dispersing information and am not 100% committed to the die-hard/try-hard gaming of PR to win.

ProjectReality,3apu0g,imhooks,4,Mon Jun 22 15:05:40 2015 UTC,"Also: Get a feeling on what's important and what's not. I clearly remember playing in a excellent squad except this one guy who just couldn't let go of that transmit button. EVERYTHING he saw, heard or even thought would be verbally communicated to all of us. 70-80% of the time you could hear his constant reports flowing through the speakers.    Most of your squad does not care what color the tank is and how many bullets each specific enemy has fired (The most outrageous extremes of what he felt transmit-worthy). Even in the middle of a firefight he would blabber on about this non-sense. In the end the rest of the squad was essentially waiting for him to take a breath in order to get on the comms. (We could have asked him to quiet down, but no-one knew how to do that in a friendly way...)   I guess the threshold goes at contact reports ('Contact type, direction, distance). This shall always be transmitted. Everyone shall have a chance at transmitting such vital information. Do not try to fill every silent second on the radio. Keep it free for more important stuff."
ProjectReality,3apu0g,dbj1303,2,Mon Jun 22 17:17:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, some just like to hear themselves talk. I'm good with general conversation while traveling to an objective, but when contact is imminent, please maintain radio silence until it's to make a report."

ProjectReality,3apu0g,zman122333,4,Tue Jun 23 15:20:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this.  Knew some of the basics but this sums it up nicely.  Maybe something to add: when communicating within your squad, try to be clear and concise.  ""Contact close 260"" beats ""GUYS CONTACT ENEMY CONTACT GUYS CONTACT I HAVE CONTACT RIGHT ON TOP OF ME"" over squad chat.    Also, consider calling out contact direction on local.  Heading 260 doesn't mean anything (much) to me if I'm 50-100m away from the person who called it out.   Also use unique(ish) objects for reference like ""on the pink roof"" instead of ""on the roof."""
ProjectReality,3apu0g,Kameniev,2,Mon Jun 22 17:25:31 2015 UTC,"I thought about including that as well.  Contact reports should include   -Nature of the threat  -Heading (NOT left or right) using an azimuth  -Distance to said contact which can include ""danger close"""
ProjectReality,3apu0g,PS2viciado,3,Mon Jun 22 20:05:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, almost completely. While I take comms more seriously than 90% of PR players and SLs, if you wait for a 'go ahead', you may be waiting for some time. I literally never hear this used, and among competent commanders and SLs it's not really necessary (and is made less so by the pretty static fact that 99% of people will never use it)."
ProjectReality,3apu0g,AFatDarthVader,2,Mon Jun 22 19:48:21 2015 UTC,"The reason for ""go ahead"" is the SL may be busy talking to his squad or another squad, same for the Commander.  If you've ever had squads, commander, and squad mates all talking at once, you will understand the need for acknowledgement of radio traffic before talking.    If nobody uses it, then so be it.  Some SLs just don't use the radio, and there is nothing that can be done about that.  I usually have good success with it though."
ProjectReality,3apu0g,Kameniev,3,Mon Jun 22 20:12:59 2015 UTC,"I want to reinforce the ""Wait for the 'Go Ahead' before talking"", THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT.

ProjectReality,3apu0g,AFatDarthVader,2,Tue Jun 23 00:55:06 2015 UTC,"While we're giving advice, I heard about people doing something on HOG the other day: don't use FOBs as cover.    The FOB is a target. Hiding behind targets doesn't work very well. The FOB is especially a target for explosives. Hiding behind something that tanks, rockets, mortars, and CAS likes to shoot at won't keep you alive very long.  FOBs don't make for very good cover; the sandbags are low and the mound exposes you to fire.  You are drawing fire onto the FOB, where teammates may be spawning.  You are firing through that same area where a teammate may spawn.    If it's the only cover available, go ahead and use it for cover. But otherwise it's a pretty bad idea."
ProjectReality,3apu0g,TwinTip89,2,Mon Jun 22 18:07:48 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, you mean the actual FOB structure, not the multitude of other structures that can be spawned around it, right?"
ProjectReality,3apu0g,tiger817,2,Mon Jun 22 19:46:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, correct. The FOB structure itself. The others are meant to provide at least some cover, generally, so those are much better alternatives to the spawn point."

We just recently removed one admin and demoted another for not handling reports, the one we removed was ingame reporting what was happening, I assume it was him you mentioned in a post above?  Also about your IP info, all PR servers get access to every clients IP and cd hash, this is for us to investigate multiple account uses and to also let us share ban info easier with other communites.

ProjectReality,3alpmc,Tea2theBag,-2,Sun Jun 21 15:24:00 2015 UTC,"i would be on reddit more often than the PRTA forums to see the notifications.   But i guess it's also to do with knowing how i've seen some admins in past gaming history handle problems, They see 1 person bitch so they block that person from playing so that isnt a problem anymore, I don't know anyone in the PRTA admin group well enough to know that i could later get unbanned if that situation rose.

They were all told to get off the flag due to a rule, even though the map seems to be specifically designed for the Germans to be on that first flag in the first place.  Another time was the same map when an admin got accidentally TK'd, he flipped his shit and kicked the guy who TK'd even though he was told that the guy was brand new.

Nope if admins aren't working off that then i don't know what else someone is ment to do.   There was a guy in my squad, can't remember his name and he said he was an ex admin for PRTA and he lost his admin powers because he kicked another admin who was breaking the rules.

ProjectReality,3alpmc,disnoxxio,-1,Mon Jun 22 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"so i have been playing PR since 0.4 made a pause from ~0.6 to 0.7 and then again from 1.0 to 1.3.  Now that i came back i gotta admit i experience the admins a lot worse, they ban people for the slightest things, they themselves break the rules, switch teams to blufor on ins maps (One time we had a game on MERK EU which has 10 reserved slots and the admin's Blufor side had 48 players while the Insurgents had 42 Players on Al Basrah. They won the match, had a ton of fun, but everyone on the INS side was seriously pissed about this, especially since reports on baseraping simply have been ignored).  And who cares if there are 3 Squadleaders without mic, as long the admins got their CAS squad running they'll be happy. Seriously when i came back from 1.0 to 1.3 i didn't expect the mod to be in such a state.  Like last week on a COOP server an admin was flying the Kiowa and fired rockets into the North-western compound on Karbala killing 1 teammate, he said sorry and made a turn, on his second attempt to fire rockets onto the compound his rockets were flying towards me, i didn't really appreciate that and fired back at the kiowa, killing his co-pilot...15seconds later i was banned. not temp, but forever.  A few years ago you had to blow up Little Birds with C4 to get banned, now you only need to piss of the admins and you're gone."
ProjectReality,3akrwl,LuizPSC,5,Sun Jun 21 04:11:56 2015 UTC,"Tormenting? More like breaking every ROE and yet still not being allowed to be shot at. Really, why doesn't the civi ROE include shooting a civi who punches you? Or, at the very least, give the french restrainers, because for some reason they have freaking bayonets."
ProjectReality,3akrwl,Its_a_Friendly,3,Sun Jun 21 05:01:39 2015 UTC,If he was with his squad this would not be a problem. Shotguns are the Shit during insurgency. A quick thinking specialist would have made quick work of any civi and earned tons of intelligence points for blufor.

ProjectReality,3akrwl,Its_a_Friendly,3,Sun Jun 21 19:50:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed French should have restraints in their kits for ins, however you almost always need a breacher in your squad for ins.  Not only for civis, but to destroy the caches..."

But boy, it was sweet seeing my breacher blow the crap out of civies. I even got to do some when he went down.  Still, it's just absurd that the civies can punch armed soldiers with no repercussions. I really hope they get the French restrainers on that map, or make it ARF so that the enemy doesn't get civies (because the ARF don't, if I'm not mistaken)."

But even  i khow rocks are kind of cheap for the bluecorps! i mean, i desire rocks, but my moral compass says that would be bad!"
ProjectReality,3akrwl,Its_a_Friendly,2,Mon Jun 22 22:41:36 2015 UTC,"Because if a civi gets close enough to punch you, you should competent enough to be able to use your restrainers on them. Plus punches do very small damage.   Remember this is a video game as well. If it was closer to reality, you would have many AI civies roaming the map, as well as cars driving everywhere, and you won't know which person is a civi, or more importantly which car is a bomb car. And, you can't just detain them all. If this was in the game, opfor would never, ever win insurgency mode.   Plus civis got majorly nerfed, because people were too stupid to be able to deal with them.  They used to have rocks and grapling hooks. You used to be able to do shit like stand on road signs on maps, and wait for a tank to drive by and just drop down right infront of it and make them kill you. Or, if you get a squad together, you could pelt enough rocks at someone to cause them to start to bleed.   However, I feel like insurgency is pretty well balanced right now."
ProjectReality,3akrwl,NationalForensic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"Thing is, you can't say that when your team (the French) doesn't have restrainers in the first place. Then it's just silly beyond belief. I mean, if a team has restrainers it's fine, but if they don't, it's just not too fun.  I'm just aggravated from some bad memories as BLUFOR from a round on Marlin. At least you can shoot them when they try to grab one of your kits.  And yeah, Insurgency is fairly balanced, bar a few rather absurd game-breaking strategies. (Like how if the INS all stay in their main BLUFOR can't win, stuff like that). Apparently they're testing a new version of insurgency that relies on only one cache and increasing intel"

I had a great experience today leading a squad holding onto an ammo cache against ever increasing numbers of US Marines pressing down onto our  position.  Yet in the game immediately afterwards I experienced a huge setback. My squad was a mixture of some friends and some randoms, and we scaled a mountain to seize a bridge (I don't quite remember the name of the map). Immediately we begin to take fire and I go down.  At this point my friends (who are very new to the game) are all asking me how to spawn and where to spawn, while some more experienced squad members are urging me on to take control of the situation.  I'd like to say that I did my best to try to reassert control, but in the chaos of all the voices shouting, bullets flying, and general confusion, the squad got wiped out. Shortly afterwards a ton of people left the squad.  I thought I was ready, but we came upon a situation more intense than I was prepared for. I think it was a good lesson  in command and it felt like a very real situation. Still, that PR failure will no doubt haunt me in the games to come.  TLDR; First time as squad leader, did well, then experienced command meltdown in an intense situation."

ProjectReality,3age4l,jinek67,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:34:34 2015 UTC,"Some of the choppers are nerfed too much imho.  The hueys are slower and less agile than what I am used to before. It took out some of the joy now. It is now harder to fly those bitches below rooftop level in muttrah now.   The blackhawks have an improved turn and roll rate and it has lesser tendency to nose down during a banked turn. It feels a bit lighter than to what I am used too and due to that, I don't like to fly it anymore.  The chinooks are ok, slower but it still has the weight to it and it does not feel any different despite the lack of speed.  the lynx, puma and that medium french, chinese chopper is ok. Did not feel too much change on its flight characteristics.  The Cow is one of the easiest choppers to fly and they made it easier. It feels heavier than to what it was before while keeping the turn characteristics the same as before. It is a much better platform in performing the CAS-COWS due to how stable it can be and how easy it is to maintain a hover or a holding pattern.   All in all, The updates have nerfed the trans choppers too fucking much to the point that it takes the fun of flying away. It is harder to maintain and perform maneuvers in the choppers due to the drastic changes that they did on the flight characteristics. I find it hard to fly at really low altitudes since most of the choppers lost their agility and speed."

ProjectReality,3adjxg,PenguinScientist,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:45:35 2015 UTC,"The PR community is special, in that because of the in-game communication and command structure, you don't need have a group prior to joining a game.

Tell your squad lead you are a new player, listen to what they say. AND MAKE sure you read that God damn manual!   Just my two cents don't play marksman as a new player, you often don't get many kills, don't help your squad or team. Learning how the other kits functions and how to use them is fundamental to PR. I really suggest you learn how to use an AR kit first if you are really interested in marksman.  Last thing please don't take vehicles for personal transport, this isn't battlefield, assets are vital and taking a armoured hmv or logi truck for a solo ride really affects your team. Often times it will get reported and kicked for asset wasting. Don't be a bitch and just walk, or better yet wait for a rally or a nearby fob."
ProjectReality,3ab0kt,Liftylym,9,Thu Jun 18 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"While I generally agree, I was playing a game of insurgency as the coalition forces with a squad leader that was brutal to play with.  Minimal communication for the first few minutes, silence for a few after that, then a ""sorry I'm back"", followed maybe 10 minutes later by ""brb afk for a few minutes"".  We had periods of time where the entire squad was standing around doing absolutely nothing.    Not to mention in the time he was playing, all he wanted to do was build a ""Super FOB"" in the most useless area of the map.  I believe the map was Gaza and we were building the FOB on the tip of the peninsula (pretty much the farthest point from any potential cache location).  When somebody asked him what the point of doing this was, his response was ""You know, build some MGs TOWs n' shit.""  This was followed by a long silence from the entire squad.  Needless to say, we lost this game and it wasn't even close.  It was especially frustrating as all other squads were full or locked and the Max number of squads were already being used.    While I do agree that the team with better teamwork will win 99% of the time, this does not mean blindly follow a bad squad leader.  Not trying to be a dick, but if you are leading a squad and they are spread out half of the time, that's on you.  You have control of your squad.  Most servers require players to be in a squad, if they are not listening to you, kick them.  They will then be kicked from the server or forced to play as part of a team (or on another squad that doesn't care for teamwork).  Whenever I am squad leader, I have the same problem but I know its because I am not doing a good enough job as a leader.  The thing I've noticed about myself is I don't micro manage the squad enough as SL.  I'll set a way-point to rally on outside our target but might not guide the squad each step along the way (IE: Cross the street here, single file lines, spread out etc.)    Believe me I'm not trying to bash you, this game needs more experienced squad leaders.  Just try and think of ways you can make shitty (new) players better."

For example, I joined a game mid-game yesterday and my squad was far away from base and any FOBs.  They couldn't set up a rally point as they were pretty much constantly fighting enemies.  I tried to make it to the squad alone like 3 times only to be killed each time.  Maybe try giving guys who need to regroup a specific route to take like ""Advance north to I9 then move on our position from the east to avoid enemy contact.""  Like I said, if people aren't obeying orders and blatantly doing their own thing, kick em out.    Also, try naming your squad something like ""Mic infantry"" or ""ENG Infantry"" and do a quick mic check at the start of a round (or in the middle of a round if your squad is disorganized).  People who are looking for a VOIP squad will join these before ""FOXTROT.""  If somebody doesn't respond, kick em."

These people who play with you aren't men who enlisted into the military and will follow orders blindly from superior rank. They're just people coming on to play a game, sometimes you can't be too rough with them or they will just not cooperate. Leading a group of people in this kind of environment takes a another level of tact and patience that's not needed in real military leadership.   Personally when I'm squad leading and I encounter a problem in the squad where someone is just wandering off or not responding to me, I just ask them to regroup with a firm but un-aggressive tone, ask them again after half a minute, maybe one more if you're unsure about it, then I just kick them. No yelling or ranting over squad comm about how much these kind of people piss you off. Just be professional, be the guy that's clearly focused on leading the squad to victory and won't let some bums get in the way of that."

I put myself in a situation where I couldn't manage the squad at all, because I was taking too much contact myself. I didn't notice my squad gradually being picked off, I didn't have a plan for them to make it back to me, and all the kills I got were offset by all their deaths while trying to make their way back. What I needed to do was directly instruct someone to do what I was doing, so I could have some headspace to keep the rest of them in the right spots. They were new, so they didn't automatically know what to do, but they followed my orders diligently, which guaranteed that I learned my lesson. That's why, as a squad member, I follow orders whether I agree with them or not. Or at least, I try to. -Tr3kker"

You need intelligence points to find out cache locations otherwise they won't spawn in/go known. Therefore, BLUFOR can't do anything besides losing tickets. It also makes you lose all of your score AND extends your respawn time.  In short, check your fire. You have the range advantage on insurgents. Killing too many civilians will make BLUFOR lose more so than anything else in Insurgency mode. It's why I don't like it versus AAS mode.

ProjectReality,3a16ao,Angadar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:17:35 2015 UTC,"I just got to thinking, would BLUFOR lose if the insurgents did something stupid, like all play civilians and hide in their main? I don't remember if it has a DOD, but assuming it does, how would BLUFOR ever get intelligence without killing anyone?"
ProjectReality,3a16ao,trashaccountname,3,Tue Jun 16 23:34:50 2015 UTC,"If you could convince 50 people to stand around in main for 4 hours, sure that would work. No sane admin would let this happen though."

ProjectReality,3a16ao,sprint113,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:00:21 2015 UTC,"Yes. If the timer runs out before all caches are destroyed, the insurgents win.   A while ago, one server had a particularly short round timer (1h30m) and would seed on Fallujah. Every once in a while, the server wouldn't fill until well into a round. There were a couple rounds where the insurgents won by default.   But to go a whole round where no one does anything is stupid.   On the other hand, I've seen BLUFOR teams lose because a couple players kept killing civilians, resulting in no new caches ever showing up."

ProjectReality,3a0bgl,ymmurri227,19,Tue Jun 16 05:52:50 2015 UTC,"These are a few things that come to mind. These are essentially assuming you're infantry, which I highly advise you to start off with before trying out any assets until you're comfortable and confident. :)   Not having a microphone Not following Squad Leader's orders Going off and doing your own thing away from the squad Grabbing a limited kit that you aren't sure how to use and make no effort to learn how to use properly.  Grabbing any assets that you have no claim to (You must be in a squad called APC to claim and use APCs, etc) Accidentally TK'ing, which this isn't a big deal and completely understandable for new players. However if you aren't 100% certain if it's a teammate or enemy look at your map and ask your Squad Lead before engaging them. Talking with your mic too much over squad radio (or in general mic spam). Local is fine, as long as you're not right beside me yelling while not too far from enemies.  Jumping in a logistics truck and using it as your personal transport. Jumping in a transport truck and using it as your personal transport, when there's like 4 guys yelling asking for a ride right behind you. Jumping in a squad's occupied transport truck when they have 1 last squad member that needs in, but you have the spot. (Listen for people to say 'smurf, get out!' that'll likely mean you.) Not letting people (especially squad lead) know you're new so that they can help or know that you might not know what shoveling a FOB means. If you're in a transport helicopter (pilot here, yay!) and you don't say a word nor type in chat where you're wanting to go, or if you're wanting to just chill with me.   If you'd ever like some help getting started, feel free to PM me or simply reply to this comment. I stream Project Reality quite often and am glad to help any newcomers as it shows that people are still interested in PR! I stream via twitch and it's my name minus an ""a""."
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,serfmaa,3,Tue Jun 16 06:18:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great summary!  Just a couple questions. What's an asset (Guessing it's vehicles and stuff), Different roles of squads, What game modes to play to start with, What sort of things to say when i see an enemy or something."
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,serfmaa,5,Tue Jun 16 06:23:43 2015 UTC,"An asset is essentially a vehicle, yes. APCs/Tanks/Helicopters/Jets/etc require a kit to be able to use. Ground vehicles use ""Crewman"" and air vehicles use the ""Pilot"" kit.  Each squad member can utilize one kit at a time. You can see what kits there are by holding down T and left clicking. You can only request these kits under certain conditions, such as, the Grenadier kit can only be acquired if you're in a squad with at least 6 members in it. The rest of the conditions can be found in the player manual located here.  I found insurgency to be the most fun gamemode in Project Reality, due to it's attack and defend nature. One team searches and destroys caches while the other defends them off. Attackers have tickets that run out eventually whereas the defenders have 5 caches that may be blown up before the game ends. AAS is Attack and Secure where you capture flags in an order and essentially push against the enemy team at each flag until either team runs out of tickets.  If you see an enemy, or a squad of enemies, find the compass bearing they're at in relation to you and say something to the degree in squad voice chat ""Enemy squad 220 from my position."". You can give additional details (and should if required) such as ""Second story, middle window."". If you spot an RPG on the roof and a friendly asset (APC, Tank, HMMV, etc) is approaching your way, yell at them in local voice chat and warn them of the RPG and where it's at or simply tell your squad leader to tell them."
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,serfmaa,2,Tue Jun 16 06:42:39 2015 UTC,"So how exactly does mumble work? You said to tell vehicles approaching in local, how far does local reach?"
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,Firewall24,2,Tue Jun 16 06:45:26 2015 UTC,Local works up to about 50 meters I believe. Close but kinda far. You will likely hear them say something to each other or in return.
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,lakost,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:20:28 2015 UTC,I suggest you have a read at the manual  Really in-depth information on the game
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,britneyspearsvagina,12,Tue Jun 16 21:53:11 2015 UTC,"Beginners often lone wolf and don't listen to squad leaders. They also take kits that are rare (i. e. sniper). Also they don't use microphones. They lose assets, drive out logistics into the woods etc.  Start out , join an infantry squad, take the rifleman kit and communicate."
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,Kameniev,9,Tue Jun 16 06:03:53 2015 UTC,I'm going to be playing with friends and our squad leader is an experienced player. I'm going to stick with the rifleman for a while until i get used to it then maybe move to DMR. And i use a mic in all games i play.
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,imh00ks,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:08:16 2015 UTC,Dont use Marksman. Thats a no-questions-asked kick when I see that kit in my squad.
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,Kameniev,3,Tue Jun 16 07:58:56 2015 UTC,Why is that?
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,imh00ks,5,Tue Jun 16 08:28:43 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily call a Marksman useless, I think it's usually quite useful, especially on Insurgency games. Nevertheless, it's probably not your next port of call. Learn Rifleman inside out; your next job is to learn how to Medic. SL aside, there's no more important kit to a squad, and even if you're not playing Medic at the time, it's vital that you know how to use the kit (for example if you have to pick it up to revive your squad).   After that point, I'd recommend maybe trying AR or MG as they'll teach you the importance of suppression (mention you're new, people will hopefully coach you). Grenadier, Breacher (used to be called Specialist, so experienced players will understand), Light AT are all useful kits to learn, too.   Sniper kits are a straight kick from any (and especially my) INF squads. They're truly useless, or at least not as useful as practically any other kits. They also belong in dedicated Sniper/Recon squads with a Spotter. If you want that kind of capability in your squad, that's when you get a Marksman."
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,Kameniev,2,Tue Jun 16 10:06:05 2015 UTC,"When used correctly snipers can be game changers.  Sure there are some maps where it is nearly useless.  But when used in the correct manner, they are very useful."
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,imh00ks,2,Tue Jun 16 13:45:32 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Just not in infantry squads.
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,britneyspearsvagina,3,Tue Jun 16 14:25:50 2015 UTC,"Again, not necessarily true.  Snipers can be deployed with an infantry squad and can keep defense of a squad defending a flag, covering a wide arc on the infantry's flank, alerting the squad of and neutralizing any threats.  They can even set up ahead of the squad's position in preparation for an attack on a flag.  There are instances where a sniper can prove useful.  I am not a sniper, so i'm not trying to defend myself.  I've just seen them used correctly and how useful they were.  It really just depends on what the SL has planned."
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,britneyspearsvagina,3,Tue Jun 16 15:10:37 2015 UTC,"Sure, that sounds like a good use for a sniper. Except it would be better if they were, like I said, part of a dedicated sniper squad, as the requestable asset is supposed to be. In that case, they'd be able to communicate effectively with all SLs, and perform their proper recon role. In the INF squad they're not doing anything a Marksman couldn't do, without the potential for suppressive fire, grenades, and whatnot.   They can be used effectively, but they'd be more effective (as would your squad, with +1 player) as they're intended. Besides, the main reason I usually kick them is because they'll not be playing with the squad most of the time, and are filling up a space a useful infantryman could fill."
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,imh00ks,3,Tue Jun 16 15:40:12 2015 UTC,I agree there.  You just made it sound like they were totally useless :)  And I agree with the lonewolf snipers and those that grab a sniper kit without asking.  They are useless and would be kicked immediately in my squad.
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,zman122333,6,Tue Jun 16 15:42:29 2015 UTC,Its just kind of useless in most games. A rifleman or medic kit is almost as effective at long range and has more useful items.
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,deadweight212,2,Tue Jun 16 08:33:38 2015 UTC,I might just stick with the rifleman then. I play breacher on insurgency (probably shouldn't compare the two) so should I use breacher in PR?  Edit: it's not called the breacher it's the specialist.
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,zman122333,2,Tue Jun 16 08:54:31 2015 UTC,"Breacher is a very useful and fun kit to play. Practice in coop to get the feel for the rope first though, throwing your rope poorly and losing it can get your whole squad killed."
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,AFatDarthVader,2,Tue Jun 16 09:06:17 2015 UTC,"If you lose your rope, just resupply it off an ammo crate or box."

ProjectReality,3a0bgl,Boasting_Stoat,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:59:02 2015 UTC,"That's losing it by letting it sit too long, not by actually throwing it."

ProjectReality,3a0bgl,quotemycode,3,Wed Jun 17 20:46:40 2015 UTC,Never create a squad in the timer phase until after the 2min mark. There's a decent chance you'll cause a major bug that forces a server restart.
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,montyquila,5,Tue Jun 16 09:16:27 2015 UTC,"NEVER create a squad before the allowed squad timer rule that the server has.  Some servers have 3min, some 2min, the lowest timer servers have are 1min30seconds. IF YOU ARE NOT SURE what the squad timer is ask people on the server.  If you still are not sure DO NOT Make a squad before 1min30."
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,TrolliOlli,2,Tue Jun 16 09:35:28 2015 UTC,I won't be making squads so this doesn't really apply to me but good to know.
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,TrolliOlli,3,Tue Jun 16 11:27:40 2015 UTC,Make sure to read the manual. This will cover many questions you would have possibly annoyed more experienced players wth first. Of course ask away for anything not covered in the manual.
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,ranzbart,3,Tue Jun 16 12:44:05 2015 UTC,"Don't take a kit that you don't know how to use / without the permission of your squad leader.  Progress through the kits slowly and learn how to use all the equipment in each kit.  Use the following order:  1) Rifleman - learn how to use your gun effectively (steady your aim).  Also get familiar with throwing grenades (by far the best tool to clear out buildings).  Use your ammo pack carefully.  Save it for your AT / Auto Rifle squad mate when they run out of ammo.  You will be the hero of the squad.    2) Medic - Resuscitate lets you move friendly bodies to a position where they can be healed (sometimes revive-able friendlies cannot be revived as they are laying at some weird angle.  Resuscitate will bounce them around so you can hopefully revive them.  The EpiPen is used to revive fallen allies.  Lie down next to your fallen friend and hit him with the EpiPen right in the balls.  Once they are up, you need to use your med-kit (the bag) to heal them fully.  If you don't, he will bleed out quickly.  You also use the med-kit to heal partially wounded enemies as it has ""unlimited ammo"".  The med-packs (the thing you rip and drop on the ground) should only be used to heal yourself as a medic.  Use local chat and your mini map to locate fallen friends.  Voices will be louder when you are closer to the source.  Ask fallen teammates to call out on local when they need a medic.  A good medic can really make a squad.  3) Automatic Rifle - This kit gives you the choice between using the standard weapon and a deployed version of the weapon.  The deployed version is much more accurate but takes a few seconds to aim down the sight.  As an AR, your primary job is to lay down suppressing fire.  If your squad is assaulting a particular position, put yourself in an area that has a good line of sight (preferably elevated) over the entire area or at least the area with the highest concentration of enemies.  Listen closely to your squad lead as he should be telling you where the enemies are and what you should be doing to help the squad.  (IE: ""We are moving up to the town, lay down some covering fire on the second floor windows.)  4) Breacher - A very usefully and fun kit.  Gives you C4 to destroy objectives (caches) and assets (FOBs, MGs, Vehicles, etc).  You also get a grappling hook which gives the squad (almost) unlimited maneuverability throughout the map.  You also get a shotgun which is great for breaching doors and CQC.  5/6) AT / Grenadier - The AT kit may be the most critical kit a squad will have.  Many AT kits only get one shot with the AT weapon so accuracy is extremely important.  If you are not confident you will hit your target ~90% of the time, don't take AT (unless nobody else will take it and you are specifically asked by the squad leader - make sure you tell him you are not familiar with AT if he does ask).  A blown AT shot can easily get your entire squad wiped by the enemy.  Grenadier, while useful, is not necessary by any means.  It should only really be taken when all other specialty kits are taken and the only remaining option for your squad is a grenadier (even then, rifleman's extra ammo and throw-able grenade can be more useful for certain situations).  TLDR: Don't take a kit without knowing how to use it & ask your squad leader what you should take."
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,Saknaaaam,2,Wed Jun 17 18:33:33 2015 UTC,I used to play it a lot then I stopped. I just started again and I decided to be a medic. People kept running up to me for healing and all I would do is drop my white packet. You have a 'weapon' that looks like a medical kit. Use that.
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,JWAxeMan,2,Tue Jun 16 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"As a fellow new player I have learned a shit ton in a week.   When moving in uneasy parts. Do not engage unless your squad lead gives the go ahead, and you have given others the direction(unless they are in your face in that case blow them away). Giving away a concealed position is an easy way to get your squad wipe.  Don't peek the tank/lav/vehicles of doom, I know it looks cool, and it's looks friendly, but the moment that thing sees even an trace of movement they unleash a barrage of death, so don't peek them unless your an at.  Check your map if your are not sure if they are enemies or friendly.   Im going out of way to say this but take medic/breacher IF NO ONE ELSE will take it, a shitty medic is always better than no medic on the squad. Like the other say even if you are a new player some squad leaders do not mind.  And last thing grenades are your friend, when clearing a building, let your friend the grenade go in first. Enemies behind the wall, let your grenade friend check if they are still there. Just make sure your grenade friend stays away from your fellow soldiers.  Edit: I'd also like to second the point above me and give that deviation video a watch. The more your understand deviation, the more kills you get."
ProjectReality,3a0bgl,lildrumpro,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:42:07 2015 UTC,"One thing  I've noticed that beginners do a lot is try to call out contacts over squad chat (which is okay) without knowing how.   When calling out contacts it's  best to:    stay calm (too many new people panic and yell when calling out enemies)  state the direction  state the approximate distance (this will take getting used to,  a good way to learn is compare objects to your map as 1 small grid square is 50m, or 1 whole square is 150m)   Good contact call: ""contact North 35 at 100 meters:  Bad contact call:"" SHIT UH,  ENEMIES INFRONT OF ME!! ""  My advice is try to always keep an idea which way you're facing and check your map periodically to get rough estimates on how far away certain landmarks are.  Do this and it'll be much quicker and easier to call contacts"

ProjectReality,39wzs6,mk262,-1,Wed Jun 17 00:02:52 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? I love playing as a Marksman. You could use those rifles to engage enemies at any range (close range hipfire works great).   While I understand that many new players immediately try to grab a Sniper or Marksman kit without asking, they're very useful kits. I wish players weren't so hostile to others who would like to use those kits."
ProjectReality,39wzs6,Viral_Krieger,2,Tue Jun 16 02:33:00 2015 UTC,"You may get kills with your Marksman/Sniper kits. However games are won by sticking close to your squad leaders, and lone wolves are more likely to wind up as fodder for the enemy.  If someone in my squad grabs a Marksman without asking and runs off on their own, I usually just kick them."
ProjectReality,39wzs6,pinkfreude,2,Tue Jun 16 11:06:36 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that your squad should stick together and you should kick anyone who wanders off for no reason. My point is that someone with a Marksman kit can engage enemies at the same range as someone with a Rifleman kit, plus 100 meters. Marksman can stick next to the squad lead and engage enemies just like anyone else with a scope could. It sounds silly, but I've killed multiple people with Marksman kits at close range, the bullets have a ton of stopping power and the rate of fire is very impressive. Marksmen are also useful for suppressing enemies at long range. For example, one time when I was playing on Vadso City there was an enemy squad firing at my squad from a distant hill so I told the AR and Marksman to stay and suppress them. While they were suppressing, the rest of my squad went around some tress and flanked the enemy."
ProjectReality,39wzs6,Viral_Krieger,2,Tue Jun 16 18:22:15 2015 UTC,"I find good marksman can be as useful as a good ar. Like it was said they can engage and suppress an enemy from a safe location while the squad moves up. I have won games thanks to a marksman being in a squad during defensive battles. He was able to spot enemy squads and smurfs heading towards our position(he didn't engage unless he was given the go ahead). He gave us warning of ground vehicles and could spot helicopters for the aa with ease. All in all he allowed our fob to set up prime defensive positions before the enemy arrived. That being said the most value wasting/team losing players are often marksmen, snipers or riflemen who go going off and lone wolfing. Wasting tickets, man power, valuable kits, and most of all important transport, logis, and technicals for a personal ride...."
ProjectReality,39wzs6,montyquila,2,Tue Jun 16 23:25:25 2015 UTC,"I like having the rifleman because with all those other kits you named are dual job kits, the rifleman is dedicated to using that rifle.

I understand that a Rifleman kit is great for a new player that might find the amount of responsibilities overwhelming, but using just a rifle the whole game sounds extremely boring.  I think that half the fun of Project Reality is the great variety of weapons and vehicles and adapting to different situations. If you enjoy only using that rifle the whole game, go for it and have a blast."
ProjectReality,39wzs6,Viral_Krieger,2,Tue Jun 16 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"yes i would rather have a rifle. I dont like my squad to all be loaded up with special kits. I need riflemen in my infantry squad. squad leader, 2 medics, machine gun, AT, breacher, 2 riflemen."

Well, that doesn't really do the pre-1.3 community any justice. It's kinda saying we were asking for it, and saying it doesn't feel the same because new players 'stole' the humor from it, and having a 'I thought it was funny first' attitude is even more deserving of the post-1.3 cancer. We've probably all been in their shoes, but only now can you see how stupid it actually was.   All you can do is help them assimilate and to help build a better post-1.3 world.

ProjectReality,39tnd8,Stiddit,6,Sun Jun 14 17:44:16 2015 UTC,"That would be the dream video, wouldn't it? The problem is that it's super hard to do.   Getting all this footage from multiple point of views, having it go the right way (not scripted), piecing it together so it makes sense for the viewer and it's interesting to watch, is something very difficult to accomplish. Believe me, I'm the guy that tries to do this kind of stuff.  The best you can get usually is a recording of gameplay from a squad leader point of view and get his squad working together with other squads, CAS and the commander. It does happen, but you won't have the camera point of view shifting around, which would be awesome. Also, for a new player watching that, I feel that they will get lost too easily in the amount of comms from different people and issues with situational awareness to know what the hell is going on. I think if they are not the right type of player, they will get overwhelmed and just get bored.  As for videos that show high level of teamwork (mainly from SL's point of view), here are a few videos:  Amazing Combined Arms Teamwork - PR v1.3 Kashan  USMC Teamworks - PR v1.2 Saaremaa  French Infantry 3 Squads Teamwork - PR v1.2 Op.

ProjectReality,39u9y3,Its_a_Friendly,2,Sun Jun 14 22:07:57 2015 UTC,Can't find anything in the manual about it but it would make sense being that the icon stays up for a couple seconds even after filling all 4 bars.

We really mean it when we say that we want to re-imagine it in Unreal Engine 4 and SQUAD.  The layout is very likely to remain the same, at least to a recognizable degree. Maintaining the play style and feel of the map is also a big priority for us.  The rest we can’t guarantee will stay the same, The map in SQUAD will likely be bigger scale than the 1km sizes of these maps in Project Reality"

Korengal is such a ridiculous pain in the ass to even move on, and Fallujah is just a straight up rape fest that you almost NEVER see Blufor win on because of it's poor design(as if insurgency itself wasn't bad enough)."
ProjectReality,39mp79,Stroopwafelkruimel,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:47:41 2015 UTC,I'd personally have preferred that one map with the Germans v. Taliban (I forget what it's called) over Korengal.

ProjectReality,397ls7,Sedition7988,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:05:29 2015 UTC,"Step 1: Open squad at start of match  Step 2: Tell your squad what kits you want, and be sure to clarify volunteers who pick said kits. Try to keep it to just 2 specialty kits(One of which HAS to be medic. Mandatory) at the start, 3 if it's urban or insurgency because you'll need a rifleman specialist kit for the c4 and hook. Make everyone else riflemen  Step 3: Kick everyone that ignores Step 2 out of your squad. This means people that go and pick up whatever kit they feel like, usually useless garbage like grenadier kits or marksman kits. Chances are these people aren't good listeners anyway and will probably try to lone wolf, just using your squad as a means to pick up kits.  Step 4: Repeat step 3 throughout the game because people will try and test your patience with it. These people are toxic and will fuck your squad over at every opportunity, not realizing that most servers will kick people that aren't in a squad. You have 'authority' as a SL and you need to exercise it, otherwise pubbers will walk all over you and fuck you(and themselves) over.  Step 5: Make sure your squad understands that you have to be in communication with a bunch of people at once and that they need to not be flooding comms or second guessing everything you decide upon, because they aren't in the loop like you are and are making their stupid backseat-commanding decisions based off of a fundamental lack of information and responsibility. Everyone will want to pretend they are SL in your squad, but none of them want the responsibility that comes with actually being one. Kick anyone that tries to give you this shit after two warnings. If they don't like it, they can join another squad, make their own, or get kicked from the server. Sounds harsh but you have to be stern and have a pair of balls if you're going to be SL."

ProjectReality,390xiu,mrtrotskygrad,8,Mon Jun 8 13:13:58 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you all the history of PRMumble. I played PR for a long time, before PRMumble, with the external PRMumble and now the integrated PRMumble.   Several times I would play on the same server with the same clans.   Before PRMumble, as expected, all these clans would have their own TS/Ventrillo/Mumble servers. Maybe they would use in-game BF2 voip, but probably not, as it was bad quality. So you couldn't work with them. Maybe in text chat, but it was rare. That's the usual thing you do, in most games.  We would try to get other squad leaders in the community mumble server. The idea was to use it to coordinate multiple squad leaders, while using in-game BF2 voip to talk to anyone that was in the squad, to not exclude random players that were not in our mumble server.  Then came the external PRMumble, where we had one big main mumble server with all the game servers as separate sub channels. That increased teamwork so much! People still had to download and run a separate program, but they could join and talk to each other. Squad leaders could work together easily. Local positional comms made it so you could talk to everyone around you. So good.  Now that we have it integrated, with an in-game overlay, where you don't have to do anything and you get all of that, it's just sad if people don't use it. They are missing so much on the opportunities to get more players working together.   Clans/groups should stop being selfish and try to play with others. It makes the game better for everyone, yourselves included.  A personal story: I knew this one clan that I didn't like. Thought they were kinda jerks because they wouldn't join our comms or work with us, before PRMumble. After PRMumble, they started using it, talking to us, and working together with us. They are great players, and we play all the time, while they have their tags and I have none. ;)"

It HEAVILY impacts your team when you have botched transports, especially early game it can very easily cost you a match if someone goofs up and kills a squad or two early on due to pilot error.  Nothing about flying is any different from coop to a live match, ya probably just need more practice before you're truly comfortable in a pilot seat.

It doesn't need more to transport people Pick your LZ! If someone demands a drop somewhere where you don't feel like you could drop them safely, pick a spot nearby that isn't as hard to reach (flat ground, no trees, easy fly-in,...). Don't hover around a position too long to try and find a position. Once in the target area, bring people down to the ground asap. Listen to intel: Check map markers, don't fly into APC/AA/INF markers, don't fly over enemy flags/positions, stick to the borders of the map, better safe with a few more seconds flight time than straight in and dead."

Rather than hovering and trying to vertically land, which mainly goes for almost all helicopters, try to fly low and use your wheels/skids to slide in to a stop. It is much easier than vertically dropping which can take longer and cause you to be prone to tipping forward/backward and you crash.  Another thing is that the blackhawk is a heavy flier. If you tilt too far left or right, you're going to be unable to recover. It takes very tiny movements to make the Blackhawk go a long way. If you need any help I'd be glad to hop in a training/test server with you to teach you. :)"

Just make sure to grab just a rifleman kit, explain to your squad leader (SL) that you're new, and you should be fine.   Though one tip I will give is to learn how to identify targets. Friendly fire is a terrible thing. I personally avoid friendly fire by regularly checking my map for the positions of friendlies-if I see someone in a different position than on that map, then I know that they're an enemy. And as you play, you'll learn how each team's uniforms and guns look and sound, and you'll get better at target identification. Though it doesn't hurt to ask your squadmates what the major differences between the two teams are (say, the Israeli floppy hats, or the black MEC boots, or so on). At the very least, look at your teammate's uniforms to get an idea of who not to shoot at."

ProjectReality,38umda,NationalForensic,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:57:41 2015 UTC,"When Mumble was optional, it was primarily to provide local voice chat to supplement the in-game VOIP, which allowed you to talk to your squad (B) or if you were SL, to the commander (V). One of the commander's major tasks back then was the act as telephone operator to relay messages between squads.   Today, mumble is automatically installed and configured on install and has completely replaced the built-in VOIP. Not only does it handle squad chat (Numpad 0), SL to command chat (Numpad /), and local cat (H), it added SL to SL chat (Numpad 1-9), and SL to all SL and CMD (Numpad *). You should also configure hotkeys to adjust the volume on the fly (for operating noisy armor), or mute mumble.   SL to SL chat has helped facilitate teamwork a good amount, although there have been issues with SL to All SL being overused to the point where SLs can't coordinate with their own squads because of the constant radio chatter."

ProjectReality,38qmfi,FreeFallingGaming,6,Sat Jun 6 07:04:05 2015 UTC,"Really mostly depends on the server lag at the time, you can shoot someone out of a moving helicopter through the glass with 556 but not when they are stationary, anything larger than 7.62 will always pierce cockpit glass no matter what.  Hitboxes lag through vehicles on the move sometimes so even apc crewmen that have physical models inside the APC can be killed, but it's rare (AAVP, stryker, LAV3, anything that has a first person camera inside the APC that you see other people like sitting in troop trucks)  What happened to OP was probably a case of damaging the helicopter with small arms and the pilot crashed, if the OP didn't hit the chopper, it would have been all suicides/TKs, if you damage a vehicle within a good second or two of it dying(you must be the last person to damage it though, no matter how small), you get the kill credit, this doesn't work for say shooting a tank with a rifle because rifles don't damage tanks. Any caliber weapon damages any helicopter (CAS are usually more armored than a standard trans helo but not by much)  Adding to the any caliber damages helos,  7.62 Machinegunner kits are surprisingly effective AA weapons if you can land shots on weak points(cockpit glass=weakest part of a helicopter) or near 100% accuracy so all bullets hit, as 7.62 can fuck a helo's day up."

Ended up throwing the rope off the edge of the cliff by accident so we were stuck halfway up on a ledge. Cue Mr Chinook Pilot who managed to hover close enough to the side of the mountain so that we could jump across into it. He did that while insurgent fire was raining down from above.  Could I get that experience in any other game? Probably not.

ProjectReality,38nxdw,mrtrotskygrad,3,Fri Jun 5 13:04:59 2015 UTC,Don't lead a squad. Please get a feel of general infantryman for a while. Play with other more seasoned leaders and see how they do it.   I played with someone last night who couldn't even set a marker. Was so frustrating.
ProjectReality,38nxdw,imhooks,4,Fri Jun 5 15:01:19 2015 UTC,I always use the iron sights. I find the scopes restricting. I also have SL with the GLTD. I try to get in positions where am I not dependent on scoped long range shoot outs.  Sort of an aim small miss small type of deal. I just shoot at the silhouettes and can get some amazing shots.
ProjectReality,38nxdw,flaviuscrispus,3,Fri Jun 5 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"well yeah, I'm talking about noobs who haven't figured this thing out who might take ironsights just to be cool, then when the squad gets in a long range firefight they're useless."
ProjectReality,38nxdw,caligari87,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:25:30 2015 UTC,"It's all about knowing what you'll need for a particular situation. For me, it's dependent on what kit and where we're fighting. If spawning in a city area map, I'll almost always pick ironsights because of the close-quarters. If in a more open position, scope/aimpoint.  However, if I pick a kit with a certain specialty built in, that affects it too.    For Breacher/Specialist, I usually always take the scope version because the shotgun already is a close-range weapon. For grenadier, I pick ironsights because scopes often get in the way of ranging (US Marines, looking at you) and the UGL is my bread-and-butter for anything longer than 50-100m anyway. For medic, ironsights almost exclusively, because I shouldn't be engaging at range, putting myself at risk, and if anything gets close enough for me to engage it, then the rest of my squad is likely incapacitated already, and scopes take longer to get a decent sight picture in mid/low-range CQB."
ProjectReality,38nxdw,spongebog,3,Sat Jun 6 16:44:59 2015 UTC,interesting way to look at it. I use scopes as medics so I can function as another rifleman when not engaging in medic work.

ProjectReality,38nxdw,flaviuscrispus,3,Mon Jun 8 04:56:35 2015 UTC,"I have something to add. Please do not throw smoke on the squad position, throw between squad and enemy so it just blocks line of sight.  So many people will instantly throw smoke on our position to where we cannot shoot out and can not see enemy closing in and so many seem to do it as a reflex, very irritating. When moving with the squad, stay with squad and hold position, I have so many people that cannot stop moving the whole time if I am trying to scout an objective and Ive got people moving all around me it can blow the surprise for the enemy.  Try and watch the squads back, look around see where everyone is looking try ot get 360 degree of cover, alot of times everyone in the squad will ""Want to get in on the action"" and they will all be facing one bearing.  When moving try to stick to the low ground and be conscientious of who can have line of sight on you and from where. People start milling about, I even tell them where there is enemy and they stand right out in the open instead of getting on one side of a wall or crawling i a ditch.     If the squad is running into a position go to the position, ive had my squad moving in an air control tower, we came under fire, quarter of the squad didnt move into the position, other that were on the way started to scatter they were all shot because they hid leaving themselves exposed to the fire, I wasnt even first and I made it in the tower, but now my squad was spread out and wouldnt move and the poeple in the air control tower took out the rest of my squad inside. I would say the lesson is try to put yourselves in the shows of your player, be paranoid about what you are doing, be bold."

ProjectReality,38o5b0,chrixiss,4,Fri Jun 5 14:04:09 2015 UTC,"Hi!   The best way to know who to revive is to get them to call out in local comms.  They'll be able to say things like ""Yeah, that's me, you're on top of me"" or something like that. The most reliable way to use the epipen is to lie prone, and shove it directly into their ass or crotch.  Not even kidding, that's the most reliable way to do it. Again, ask them to call out in local.  It's the best way to find people nearby :)"
ProjectReality,38o5b0,TheMadMati,3,Fri Jun 5 14:24:01 2015 UTC,"Medic tips:  -Use the squad screen to find out who is dead.    -Ask those players to call out on the map. (Right click on Give up/Call for Medic).  This will bring up an icon on the map.  -Ask those players to give a rough estimate of their last known location.  -Tell them to use local and call for medic.  You can pinpoint their position by the sound of the voice.  (I hope you have a mic)  Medical procedure:  -Epipen works best in the butt  -If the first poke doesn't work, try to resuscitate (press 2) with hands.  -If that doesn't work, throw a patch on them.  This will jolt the body to ""wake it up"", freeing it from being stuck on the wall or ground.  Secondary Tip:  -If you are in the midst of a close firefight and can get someone up.  Throw a patch on them first, so they have the clarity to run and see where they are going."
ProjectReality,38o5b0,imhooks,4,Fri Jun 5 14:30:32 2015 UTC,"Adding on to this: smoke grenades. Smoke grenades, smoke grenades, smoke grenades. Don't throw them on the person you're trying to revive, but rather to block vision between the enemy and them. You don't want to the smoke directly on who you're reviving. The reason being is that it's common now to throw grenades into smoke or fire a rocket if there is credible belief that a medic is trying to revive one of their allies, thus you can take out the enemy medic as well. If you block off the enemy's vision, they'll fire into the smoke nine times out of ten.  Next, try to wait until AFTER the firefight to get people up unless it's absolutely critical. If someone goes down again because you're patching them up, they're going to go dead-dead which is worse for the squad than if they're just lying there wounded. Squads can get disorganized this way and remember: you still have five minutes to get them up.  Never patch people up in the open. Make sure you tell the person that you're getting up to get somewhere where there is cover, preferably behind your buddies but not terribly far. If you need to go far, throw a patch for them and have them follow you. Just give people a cardinal direction on local and they'll generally follow you. Make sure they're NOT looking at you while you're patching them up, have them watching the direction of where you're taking fire. The last thing you need is for both of you to go down because you're prone and making out with each other rather than having awareness.  Been seeing this out of new medics lately, but don't mass revive a bunch of people with epipens and then start patching people up individually. This is bad because people will revive in black and white status, which means they're about to go down again and will go dead-dead this time. You need to focus on one person while patching up another. You can do two at a time, just make sure you drop a patch for one person.   As for priority, it should generally be the other medic if they go down. Two medics is better than just one. Squad leader should be next. However, never jeopardize yourself if an ally overextended. They can wait.  Lastly, and I mean this as politely as possible, do not be afraid to tell people to shove off if they get verbally abusive to you because you're not reviving people fast enough or they're spamming for a medic. If they're doing the latter, just tell them that you know and you'll come for them shortly. If they're the former, tell your squad lead if they're in the squad. If they're not in your squad, leave them there if they want to be abusive. Medics are to be cherished because it's a thankless role. That being said, thank a medic if they get you up. It takes a second to do so and it helps."

This way you can quickly see who's down and who isn't. Prioritize: Squadleader gets to be revived first (unless he's an asshole and died in a shitty spot), then the rest, depending on who died first. Tell them specifically to guide you, the rest should stfu in the meantime. If you want to get an overview, tell all to call out for medic (On Spawnscreen right-click ""give up / call for medic"" - Medic icons will appear on your map indicating where everyone is positioned. Before epipen in non-flat grounds/bodies stuck into each other/Body in structure: Rescusitate. If they died in a shitty position that will take fire: Drop a field dressing on them before you revive: This will enable them to sprint to cover after the revive and have no b/w vision. Always tell the player where to go before you revive them (""Go NorthWest, into the bathroom"")  Don't bother reviving people that don't respond. Go directly above their body, ask ""are you revivable?"" - if they don't answer, don't bother. Your squad has top priority! Don't wait up and heal 20 friendlies when your squad is moving out.

ProjectReality,38o5b0,X1Spriggan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:47:58 2015 UTC,"The reason resuscitate is used in the game is to prevent the body collision mesh from not allowing you to revive someone because the player collision mesh is stuck in another mesh or object.   Resuscitate does one thing really well. It resets the ""location"" of the dead player ( sometimes the body of the down player and the location where you can revive them is different)  The other thing that resuscitate does is it attempts to move the player collision mesh that might otherwise be stuck in some sort of mesh. Lets say for example that a down player has his hand inside a building. If his hand remains inside of the building, you will not be able to revive him.  Lastly I'd like to say that instead searching for players that need healing, it might be better to be in a safe spot near the squad and telling the whole squad once in squad comms where you are and having them come to you and call out in local occasionally where you are, rather than you searching for them yourself.

ProjectReality,38odi5,mrtrotskygrad,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:10:32 2015 UTC,"M240 machine gun:       The M240, officially Machine Gun, 7.62mm, M240, is the US military designation for the FN MAG (Mitrailleuse d'Appui Général, meaning General Purpose Machine Gun), a family of belt-fed, gas-operated medium machine guns firing the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge.   The M240 has been used by the United States Armed Forces since the late-1970s. It is used extensively by infantry, most often rifle companies; as well as ground vehicles; watercraft; and aircraft. Despite not being the lightest medium machine gun in service, it is highly regarded for reliability, and its standardization among NATO members is also seen as a major advantage.  All variants are fed from disintegrating belts, and are capable of firing most types of 7.62 mm (.308) NATO ammunition. M240 variants can use non-disintegrating belts (following replacement of a few easily swappable parts). There are significant differences in weight and some features among some versions which restrict interchangeability of parts. The M240s used by the US military are currently manufactured by FN Manufacturing, a US-based branch of FN Herstal.   The M240B and M240G (see Variants section) are usually fired from an integrated bipod, a vehicular mount, an M192 tripod that is mostly used by the U.S. Army; and the M122 tripod (a slightly updated M2 tripod) that is mostly used by the U.S. Marine Corps.

Get into a CAS helicopter and just fly around, get familiar with the controls until you're confident with it.   If you can get people to laze (mark targets with the laser designator / GTLD) targets for you in CO-OP then that's great, practice with that. Try and get a second player to fly or gun the CAS helicopter for you in CO-OP as well.   Then just go on to a live multiplayer server and make a CAS squad before someone else does it when the round starts.  Usually you're going to want to fly high just above the view distance range to avoid anti-air from the ground and dive (use a lot of flares when doing attack runs) on targets the infantry squad leaders have marked for you with their laser designators."

Sometimes I just wish people would just shoot into the bushes or something instead of sitting around trying to determine where the fire is coming from.

The most overplayed maps are: Muttrah, Kashan, Khamisiyah, Saaremaa. I was tempted to say Ia Drang and Black Gold, but these are seldom seen because the first four just completely dominate the map lists every single time and any vote that contains one of those four is guaranteed to win.  In short, those maps are good, but they're not great when people are forced to play them over and over. There are 43 maps in PR as of 1.3, we shouldn't be playing only four of those over and over."

ProjectReality,38k50t,flaviuscrispus,2,Thu Jun 4 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"Space your mortars out a bit so that they don't all get easily destroyed if you get counter-mortared. Maybe about 10m-15m between each. You want plenty of ammo crates coming to keep them resupplied. And you'll want somebody who can spot your shots for you and tell you how you should adjust your fire to make the hits accurate. For a very effective mortar squad, I'd recommend 1 skilled mortar user per mortar, with either .5 or 1 riflemen per mortar to do both supplying and security (a great role for newer players). Then you need the SL to communicate, and perhaps having an in-squad spotter (who can be any class, really-don't take important kits, though) go run out to your targets to get precise hit information, if possible."

Using spotting from squad leads in the field, while you're at the mortar pits is like 99% ineffective for the  most part. I've been a part of mortar teams who have killed well over 50 enemy, but that Only happens when there's a commander with a UAV or the squad lead is in the field marking targets and calling the adjustments."
ProjectReality,38k50t,Guru951,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:01:53 2015 UTC,"A couple tips that many people miss out on:  Distances to a marker are in 50/100m intervals, so you can end up a ways off. Using the binos to mark a mortar mission, you can see exact distances and get rounds on target pretty much perfectly. For example, your map tells you 850m. You put a mortar marker at 850m and see that it's 20m short - tell your mortars to fire at 870m instead and they'll be a lot closer. Resupplying from crates, you'll need a constant supply of new ones to replace the ones you've used up, which can be a pain if trans is busy and you're far from main. Instead, have the people manning the mortars request a rifleman kit every two minutes - requesting a kit doesn't use a up any ammo so the boxes last a lot longer."

Most of the squads I've joined (even when the title of the squad is 'Mic' or something similar), it's very quiet on the radio.   Sure I've had a few decent SL'ers but the majority have said next to nothing."
ProjectReality,38h76q,Marky122,6,Thu Jun 4 12:52:28 2015 UTC,"So before 1.3 came out there were only a few servers full at any given time. For Europe these were typically PRTA, NEW, MeRK. For US, PRTA NA, HOG, FCV. So that's where you typically saw the veteran players, with the exception of FCV. FCV is BlueDrake's server and he's not a veteran by any means, but he did bring in a lot of new players pre-1.3. The older, more experienced players generally avoid that server.  It's hard to get on a server now though so I don't think the older players will be visiting their preferred servers as much. I've been unable to get on NEW since the release of 1.3 and it's my favourite server by far.  Unfortunately, and as expected, a lot of new players don't have mics, and don't realise the importance of the squad leader. So they make a squad and just do their own thing. There's always going to be a group of players that just don't care about how the game is supposed to be played, and they won't make an effort to learn it properly. Those people normally get bored after a while so we've just got to wait 'em out. In the meantime we need to show as many people as possible a good time, so then they're keen on sticking around.  If you join a squad with an SL that does not talk, then you should report him with !r in squad chat. He'll see this, and maybe then decide to communicate a bit. Otherwise, assuming the admins are good, will kick him from the server.  Help out any nervous/bad SLs as much as you are able. Or, join a squad with one of the following clan tags: [PA], 3dAC, TP, MerK, =HOG=, NEW, CIA. (I've probably forgotten a couple.) These are well known, English speaking clans that have been around for years. You'll probably have a better time with them. :)  [PA] is a reddit based community, and you can find us here: Project Awesome. We pride ourselves on being a beginner friendly, open community. There's no registration process so we take in new players frequently. It'd be great if you checked out the subreddit and played with us.

I'm not a new player but I like a few others haven't been around for a few years (4 or so) and are gradually getting back into it. I'm just not finding it anywhere near the same in terms of commuication. I tend to stick to Co-Op (namely Veterans Gaming) because it's full of people who work together and communicate. However it's normally full and I'd like to experience deployment/regular, but like I mentioned before everytime I join a squad and begin talking, there's rarely a response or SL's do a good job of ignoring you and just talking about themselves."

ProjectReality,38h76q,flaviuscrispus,7,Fri Jun 5 19:06:25 2015 UTC,"A few tips from a veteran Squadleader;  IF you are a SL you need to have good SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. Since you will be both fed info by the other squads and hopefully feed info to the other squads about enemy positions and armor movements. This means you will need to be able to report in GRIDs (i.e A7) and preferbly keypads (i.e A7kp3) of stuff you spot.  IF you are not certain make an educated guess and report enemy movements within the vicinity of that area. Being 1 grid wrong is still better than giving no info since it will atleast give the team a general idea of where to expect enemies.  YOU are the Squadleader. In short this means that everyone else in the squad is now your bitch. You get to decided what their role is and what they do. If they got a problem with this don't be afraid to remove them from the squad. Teamwork and chain of command is extremly important in PR.  At the start of a round try to build a FOB near the frontline objective. This way your squad and team will have an easy time in reinforcing the objective for an attack or defense. And remeber to utilize your rallypoint as another backup.  Defending flags can be tedious but is generally very rewarding both in score and fighting.  I'd argue it is even more important than attacking the enemy flag. Don't be afraid to take your squad to defend a flag. It is a good way to boost player morale since you will in most cases have a very easy time killing enemy players who attempts to attack it.   But once again, situational awareness is VITAL. Your squad will in most cases need to cover 360' so you dont get surprise flanked. Make sure you have people covering all angles and when you have contacts report it IMMIDIEATLY to the team and keep feeding updates as the fight progresses and if you are starting to lose or you fear that you will be overrunned report it to the team and request backup!  Area attack is a fun tool. requires a commander to call in and you must have LINE OF SIGHT on the target you want to drop it on. Also Ignore JDAM, it got removed due to balance issues.  A good placed area attack can easily turn a defeat into a victory for your team."
ProjectReality,38h76q,VonSnoe,3,Thu Jun 4 08:30:21 2015 UTC,"If they got a problem with this don't be afraid to remove them from the squad.    This. If someone's completely non-cooperative, has no mic, and is lone-wolfing somewhere far away, just remove them: they're filling up a slot that might otherwise be occupied by the best PR player in the world. Maybe give them fair warning first, tell them to start working together, return to the squad, get a mic etc. but don't tolerate dead weight."
ProjectReality,38h76q,Kameniev,3,Thu Jun 4 09:22:40 2015 UTC,"I've done my part and I only find myself to be a decent SL in a good day.

ProjectReality,38h76q,bandaidsplus,2,Thu Jun 4 13:38:42 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. Once you have 50-60 hours under your belt, you learn the instincts of a soldier, and you know how a squad should perform.   After that, you need to hop in as an SL and learn what you need to do, and how to get things done. This comes with experience.   Tell your squadmates that you're a new SL. Listen/ask for advice and input on choices. But do not allow backseat squadleading. You're in charge, you follow through with your decisions.   Good luck.   I'm going to be playing on PA this weekend (it's reddits server) if you find me online,  join my squad! I'd be happy to walk you through everything and explain choices."
ProjectReality,38h76q,POVFox,4,Thu Jun 4 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"I can't help but second this. Half the SL game is just about making decisions. Hell, they might not be the best decisions, but you just need to provide a direction. Your squaddies aren't completely thick, they have brains. But you know, just gotta give a general direction.  I mean hell, if I can do it, ya'll can. Give it a go, it's rewarding, it's fun, it's fantastic."
ProjectReality,38h76q,Pricklyman,3,Thu Jun 4 06:59:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. SLs are always in demand. That being said, this isn't a role that brand new players should necessarily be taking, unless absolutely nobody else is. Doing it well is probably the hardest aspect of PR, and especially when there're so many new players to keep in line and channel efficiently, it can get seriously bewildering seriously fast. My advice is learn the following, in this kind of order, before contemplating it:    Rifleman. The absolute backbone of the squad.  Medic. The second-most important kit in PR.  AR (Maybe), since this will teach you the importance of suppressive fire (it's fundamental). You don't necessarily need to play AR, but you need to know how one operates in a squad.    Now you need to learn your gamemodes inside out. Read the manual for this, but also just play a bit and ask questions; there are lots of little bits of info that aren't in the manual (hence it's not 500 pages-long) that can be crucial. Learn AAS and Insurgency at a minimum.   Now learn the SL kit, before picking it. You should understand how to build FOBs, how to radio fellow SLs, how to place map markers, deploy Rally Points, and call in Area Attacks—you can practice these once you're in game.   At this point, you can hopefully be a useful SL, guiding the less well-informed among you towards objectives, channelling their firepower effectively and keeping them alive. Finally, a couple of pointers when you're approaching this stage:   If you're still new, you can always say as much to your squad. I frequently play a kind of 'sergeant' role in squads I join that have less experienced SLs. I keep the squad together in a rough formation, make sure they have sufficient ammo, direct medics to where they're needed, and advise the SL when necessary—this allows them to concentrate on the bigger picture and lightens the load, especially with lots of new players about.  Try and learn these kinds of dynamics and maximise your efficiency. The most common things I say in this sergeant role are: ""don't bunch up too much"" (RPGs/Grenades are pretty deadly); ""keep up/we're moving out"" (either people are distracted/not listening, or the SL hasn't stated clearly that we're moving out—do this; don't just expect people to follow you), and ""hold your spawn etc.""—micro-manage your squad's spawning. If they're medicable, you want to medic them, but if they're not, or it's going to be a serious detraction from your objective or too dangerous, tell them to wait until you say spawn, then be aware of your possibilities (nearest FOB, availability of rally point, availability of transport squads [helis etc. that could drop them off from main], or of empty light transport that more than one player can make use of [don't one-man vehicles or waste assets]).    I'm going to leave it here for now, but if anyone has any questions hit me up. Also, if you see me in-game I'm Kameniev there too, and quite frequently SL. I'd be more than happy to help train you up."
ProjectReality,38h76q,Kameniev,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:19:19 2015 UTC,"I'd say LAT/Grenadier is more important than AR.

ProjectReality,38h76q,mrtrotskygrad,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:46:19 2015 UTC,"This is certainly true, though I mostly play Insurgency, and there's a limit to what a LAT can do to anything that really wants to upset you. I say AR because suppression is so important to infantry fighting, and few things rival an AR on this front. The kit is also used (by the SL) unlike most others (barring MG and Marksman, each of which it outstrips, I'd say); you might post your AR up to cover an advance, and in a defensive scenario, when fresh contact is made, the AR's the first kit I appeal to.   My ranking of 'kits to learn' would probably go:    Rifleman Medic AR (Closely followed by:) Gren, LAT, Marksman, MG SL (at this point, you've got the basics) Combat Engy, AA, HAT (I play INS), etc."

ProjectReality,38j22j,jewmallow,3,Thu Jun 4 19:02:10 2015 UTC,"The polite answer is yes, you need a microphone. Most squad leaders, myself included, will boot you out of the squad if you don't have a microphone. The reason isn't to be a jerk, but the reason is largely that situations in PR, especially during combat, change in a quick, dynamic manner. As such, communication between all members of the squad are absolutely time-sensitive and vital.  Case in point? Squads generally have 360 awareness set up if they're defending an area. You get essentially bum-rushed by one guy around a corner who then runs and starts taking out the friendlies around you. Typing is pointless because no one can read it as you're wounded and then the entire squad wipes as a result. It's a selfish way of playing in a team-based game. I used to be a bit more lax about it, but after having experienced near or total squad wipes as a result of one or two people not having microphones, I realized it wasn't worth my entire squad (who had mics) not having fun because of one person who did not have a mic. Now, even with newbies, if you don't have a mic, I will boot you from my squad (even if it's a newbie squad) because it's the absolute most critical thing you can have. I can tolerate you not knowing a single thing about the game and I'm glad to teach you, but you need to have a mic. Edit: I don't care if English isn't your native language, you're under 18 and maybe have the stereotypical ""squeaker"" voice, etc. All I care is that you can communicate and work as a team. I don't care if we get wiped constantly, I will always praise my squad if we communicate and worked together."
ProjectReality,38j22j,jewmallow,3,Thu Jun 4 16:26:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, you should really use a Mic. Even if you don't talk much. But it helps your while squad if you can call out enemy positions. Some squad leaders will tolerate it, sometimes, depending on you kit at performance. But you can go ahead and come to terms with never being able to run heavy assets. Communications with vehicles are even more important than with infantry."
ProjectReality,38j22j,paradoxpancake,-11,Thu Jun 4 16:35:13 2015 UTC,Can't you just call out the enemy positions in chat? I don't understand the need for vocal communication.
ProjectReality,38j22j,Anon49,4,Thu Jun 4 16:44:22 2015 UTC,"just jump in a game and try to communicate only using the chat, you'll see why you need a mic."

Just use a mic and stop being difficult. If you're so embarrassed to talk then you just really shouldn't play this game. You're not gonna have a fun time at all if you're Stone Cold Johnson.  As a side note, barely anyone pays attention to the chat box. Its much easier to listen to something than read it. Why do you think audiobooks are so popular?"
ProjectReality,38j22j,imhooks,2,Thu Jun 4 18:49:08 2015 UTC,"No, because if you go down and get wounded, you can't chat via text and that is critical for medics coming to get you up or calling out possible enemy contact.

ProjectReality,38j22j,imhooks,2,Thu Jun 4 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"Is this your first realistic war SIM?  This isn't counter strike or Gary's mod where you can run around with you head cut off and play with no sound.  The amount of detail and specifics that it takes to just have an average level of communication is immense. You have to call out things immediately because every second you waste typing will then trickle down to seconds lost for your squad members to react, your squad leader to assist and respond, and to communicate that information to the commander and other squads. This game mimics real life in that there will be long times of inaction, but the times if rapid action requires a higher level of coordination."

You just gotta be careful and tap keys instead of just HURRRR PRESSS"
ProjectReality,38hhm1,mrtrotskygrad,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:52:54 2015 UTC,"Good advice. I'd also suggest these as someone who knows how to fly, but can't stand it:  Even when you've practiced, go apply what you've learned in Co-Op before you fly in PvP. The reason is that you'll learn to fly in the individual maps and can practice some of the more advanced flying maneuvers and mechanics that the airfield can't really teach you.   And even then, once you've learned how to fly and go to PvP? Fly Trans before you fly CAS. Crashing your jet or attack chopper can lose a game for your team in some cases and losing Trans can sometimes be that way too, but at least your team has logistics trucks to fall back on. Not to mention, Trans requires less multi-tasking than CAS.  Once you've done those successfully? Go try your hand at flying CAS. You'll be able to apply everything you've learned in flying, maneuvering, and teamwork to sometimes even carry your team to victory. CAS is capable of doing absolute amazing things on some maps if properly done."

Sometimes it will try to join and someone else will beat you in, in which case you have to set it up again. But it's a decent system for auto-join for a mod for such and old game.  Also when joining squads, click on the name of the squad and it will make all the squad members white on the map. If they are spread out all over the place, it's probably a shit squad, if they are all together, it's probably a squad working well together. Joins those ones.

ProjectReality,38dk60,Sedition7988,6,Thu Jun 4 01:38:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the confusion, those 11 maps are what the server runs when admins aren't actively doing a mapvote. While it is rare, there are some times when an admin won't be on to run the vote."

ProjectReality,38goml,druidofnecro,4,Thu Jun 4 02:18:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a good squad leader to me is someone that constantly communicates. You don't have to be the best in micro managing your squad, or someone who knows every detail about the game. As long as you talk to your other squad leaders and commander about what you are doing,  and importantly calling in all of the enemies you see allowing the bigger things up the chain like tanks and planes  to do their jobs efficiently, you're a good squad leader.  Communication, COMMUNICATION, COMMUNICATION!"
ProjectReality,38goml,adrenalinetooth,3,Thu Jun 4 02:51:19 2015 UTC,"Squad Leading is a very tough job. You have to manage both your squad and the other squad leaders, and the commander if there is one. You have to make strategic (map-wide winning-the-game sort of stuff) and tactical (do we go to the left or the right hill?) decisions, and quickly. You have to be thinking of all sorts of different events, timers, possibilities, and decisions (How long until their CAS respawns? Where likely will the enemy defense on this flag be? Where should I set a FOB up, if at all? Should I request team support?), while acting out other ones. It can be a very tough job, and it shows that some of the best SL's are actual former military people.  Still, let me try to put out some key things about squadleading. One, you have to keep your squad in control. If these guys are your friends, they should listen to you, so this one shouldn't be too bad. Two, you have to cooperate with other squad leaders and Commander. If they ask for something, (whether supplies from your logi, to put a FOB up, to spot some target, etc.). You don't want to clog the all-SL chat (numpad *), so do use the various numpad numbers to talk to specific squads. Three, you want to be aware of game flow. Don't go putz off on an unimportant side of the map somewhere, but instead have an objective that will support your team's goals (i.e. do something that makes your team win).  Really, I'd recommend getting some sort of experienced player in your squad to give advice and help out with the in-squad leadership. I have seen some squads have a ""2nd leader"" of sorts, who manages the squad itself while the SL's busy with other affairs. Try to get a veteran player to fill in for a role somewhat like this.  I must admit that I'm not the most experienced of SL's (there are far better ones than me), but that's at least a basic outline."
ProjectReality,38goml,Its_a_Friendly,2,Thu Jun 4 02:37:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I honestly still have a ton I still have to learn about the game but I guess it just comes with more time and practice, I guess."
ProjectReality,38goml,Its_a_Friendly,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:41:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of Squad Leading is based on game experience. If you know how the game works, you know how to SL.  Still, if it's a group of friends, you should be fine. I'd recommend finding a not totally full and actively competitive server to start off in (if you can find a skirmish game, that'd be a great way to get introduced, both for you as a SL and for your buddies as PR players). Just make sure to not aggravate your allies (so, for example, do be careful who you shoot at), and you should be fine, though. Besides, everyone that wants to squadlead has to take the plunge and actually do it sometime, right? And if you feel really doubtful, co-op is a great place to fall back to to learn how many things work."
ProjectReality,38goml,Finrarr,3,Thu Jun 4 03:01:56 2015 UTC,"Just keep it simple as possible. Too complicated thinking takes you to grave.  Also try to get in touch with competive aspect of pr. That way you will learn to play the game as its meant. Sadly its summer, so the ""scene"" (lol) is bit in downtime."
ProjectReality,38goml,SoloWingPixy1,2,Thu Jun 4 13:36:53 2015 UTC,"Some good things have been said. So I'll hit on something small and specific. There will be times when you will probably have non-cooperative or non-cohesive members in your squad. It might make you irritated. Do not ever let the frustration get the better of you and start controlling how you lead the squad. As a veteran player (and I'm sure many other long timers agree), there isn't a much more pathetic sight than a squad leader just losing his cool and breaking down, taking his anger out on people making small mistakes, the ""Shut the fuck up and do what I tell you, you fucking idiot""-mentality is pathetic to see. The experienced players will tend to always leave those squads as soon as they notice the behavior.  A good squad leader has a lot of patience, willing to work out problems with non-cooperative/cohesive squad members while remaining calm and collected. There is only so much you can do in some cases though, some players are just really, really, in a bad state of mind and will cause a lot of trouble for you, people who just can't be helped, that is why there is the kick function in the squad tab.   The points I have made account for a part of what makes a good squad leader. There's a fair bit involved, and it all takes experience to understand how to do it. Squad lead often enough to get that experience, but also understand that you should play under other squad leaders a lot to see how they do it. Not just the good ones, but the bad ones too, see their faults and how you could do it better."
ProjectReality,38goml,Boasting_Stoat,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:33:12 2015 UTC,"Make sure everyone in your squad has a role. The kits your squads has are very important.   Always communicate. In your squad and with other squads. Ask for and spread any intel.   Also know what assets you have at your disposal at any given time: vehicle support, logistics, fire support etc. and use them wisely.  Know the map. This can dictate the way a match goes. Common sniping positions, chokepoints, entry points, safespots, defensive and offensive locations.  Pick your fights. Knowing when to retreat is a valuable skill that while it can seem boring, can save your save a lot of lives, dont rush things."

I felt bad asking squad mates how to place TOW launchers / FOBs etc but we ended up winning both games.  The hardest thing for me though was trying to take in all the information I was getting from my squad, interpreting it (mainly figuring out where the guy feeding me information actually is), and then making a decision based off the information.  It didn't help that I wasn't getting much communication from other infantry squads.  Our Transport and Tank squads were on point, but I got little info from other squads.

ProjectReality,38c496,Sedition7988,3,Wed Jun 3 13:42:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, PR isn't a game where K/D matters, so don't worry about it. You need to focus on improving your situational awareness.  As you move, you should be thinking about where you can take cover if you start getting shot. You should be making sure you're not sitting close to other friendly players - with obvious exceptions, healing, shovelling, reviving, etc.  It's something I have to constantly remind players both new and old. Stop bunching up. As an infantryman, you should be moving with your squad, yet also exercising some independent movement. Space yourself out; don't follow your squad leader like a group of ducklings follow their mother.  A good SL will always put down markers on the map. Take the same general path as him, just don't follow exactly in his footsteps.  Guns have deviation, so you can't go from sprinting to shooting right away. It's the same when you change from standing or crouching to prone. Your deviation goes up, and your shots will miss. It's well worth playing on a local server to familiarise yourself with the gun mechanics. Walk when you know there's enemies nearby; your shots will land where you're aiming and you're much more likely to win the engagement.  Be patient too, if you're defending then defend. Running around the building doesn't help. If someone calls out movement on the opposite side of the building, rely on your squad mates that are on that side to engage - you need to keep defending your side or you'll miss an opportunity to engage approaching contacts."

ProjectReality,38amer,slappymcnutface,6,Wed Jun 3 08:42:06 2015 UTC,"Ahh yes... I just wanted to make an article of how grateful i am to all of you guys on reddit, who helped me to become a better player. Yesterday was my second day of playing this game, and it was amazing feeling. To all new players, please read the manual it is vital after all, I've learned so SO much from it. Also, always be friendly and polite on any server you are, follow the squad leader commands (if hes communicating with the squad) and you will witness amazing game play and that feeling that you are in the real open field fighting with your brothers from the military. Keep in mind that COOP battles wouldn't hurt as well, i've played a couple of COOP games against bots with newbies just like me and it was really fun by learning together. I even became a squad leader and people were willing to follow my commands on every map, though squad leader is a hard job :) Play safe, don't operate the vehicles you are not familiar with and i hope i see you on the battlefield."
ProjectReality,38amer,TwinTip89,6,Wed Jun 3 05:10:24 2015 UTC,"If your Squadleader is not communicating with the squad, you better report him to the admins (type !r xyz  SL number X is not leading his squad / has no microphone"" in chat) and join a different squad asap :)"

Yesterday i was led by 3 years PR veteran (i guess), who was not really paying attention to what he was doing, on top of that his decisions were absolutely terrible and our squad was wiped out so many times because his ignorant suggestions, when i asked why are you doing this and why don't you listen to your squad mates, his reply was that hes more experienced than us and we should shut the fuck up and listen to the vet. It was a cringe moment, and SL should be kicked out of the squads for being so ignorant, rude, and not thoughtful."
ProjectReality,38amer,TwinTip89,3,Wed Jun 3 08:56:12 2015 UTC,"Not sure which timezone you're in, but check out the European [NEW] server - we have been quite successful in running lots of newbie squads led by our clan members and other server regulars. (/shameless server promotion).  If your SL is shit, you can always leave and join another squad. But keep in mind that something sacrifices have to be made on behalf of the team so it's not always his fault if you're not exactly doing what you think he or you should be doing."
ProjectReality,38amer,KetchupTubeAble19,2,Wed Jun 3 09:27:49 2015 UTC,"Your SL is just as good as the willingness of the rest of the squad to stay.

If he is being rude, report him to the server admins via !r ""name"" ""reason"" function."

Besides, PR is a fun game, sharing that fun with those interested is the right thing to do. I've been hearing generally good things about this new influx, and I have strong hopes that it'll last while keeping the community intact."

ProjectReality,388qsf,mrtrotskygrad,7,Tue Jun 2 17:17:17 2015 UTC,in 1.3? very.  However if the jet pre-flares it probably wont hit.
ProjectReality,388qsf,Anon49,2,Tue Jun 2 17:24:16 2015 UTC,one hit = one-shot?  never had the chance to try the AA vs Air mechanics in 1.3 yet apart from downing a Mi-28 with an avenger's M3 :D
ProjectReality,388qsf,MineralWouter,7,Tue Jun 2 17:35:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's mostly a hit = a kill. Even the splash damage is quite big so if you hit a flare, you still might kill it if you get close enough. In previous releases AA was rather useless so it received a decent buff this release. So CAS can't dominate a map anymore that easily. To be seen if AA is balanced now :)"
ProjectReality,388qsf,Its_a_Friendly,3,Tue Jun 2 17:47:24 2015 UTC,"AA is generally very effective against air vehicles, if you can manage to hit. Heavier jets and helicopters may be able to take a single missile, but lighter jets and helis will usually be one-shot or set on fire from one AA missile. Note that the missiles both do damage and explode based on proximity, so if you can get a really good shot (say, hitting a jet that's head-on at you), you can get very good hit ratios regardless of flares. You have to be quick and sharp, though. Particularly in AA vehicles, as you're a major target for those air vehicles.  Also, there's an interesting strategy of dumb-firing AA missiles at targets to avoid the lock alert. As the shots explode based on proximity, if you're very (and I emphasize the very) good at AA and know how to predict flight paths, it's possible to kill an air vehicles without it ever hearing the lock-on sound. I do not recommend this approach for anyone new or unsure, as if you miss this blind shot, you're completely hosed.  Or you can just got HAT/LAT a helicopter. That's fun to do."
ProjectReality,388qsf,Its_a_Friendly,4,Tue Jun 2 17:49:44 2015 UTC,"yeah LATing helicopters is fun as hell. Once a huey buzzed my MEC squad, the MG3 opened up and gave it quite a beating. obviously not as crazy as the time I eryx'd a hovering F35 in vBF2 though."
ProjectReality,388qsf,Its_a_Friendly,2,Tue Jun 2 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"It's hilarious when you just cross over a hill and find yourself behind an enemy attack helicopter. Well, hilarious if you have the AT, otherwise you're probably running to hide."
ProjectReality,388qsf,POVFox,5,Tue Jun 2 17:55:34 2015 UTC,"welll given the responses if I'm SL, I'll probably start asking people to take the AA kit more...  (after my 5 man squad all got brrrrted by a Su-25 in 2 passes)"
ProjectReality,388qsf,Stulander,2,Tue Jun 2 17:59:49 2015 UTC,"Also, there's an interesting strategy of dumb-firing AA missiles at targets to avoid the lock alert.

For Kiowas its not that hard, the AA missile is VERY fast. Just aim in front of their flight path like half a helicopter length and you will get a very close hit most of the time"
ProjectReality,388qsf,Stulander,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:29:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I have no experience with airborne AA. Ground-based AA is a lot slower, so you have to be more thoughtful of their use."

ProjectReality,387pcz,zman122333,6,Tue Jun 2 13:15:49 2015 UTC,"ironsights suck for long distance engagement as the target itself is a smaller set of pixels on your screen which makes it harder to aim. They're servicable/can be good for CQC, but most majors (Dutch, Canada, Russia, Britain) have BUIS on their long range optics.  generally any sight with zoom is good. SUSAT, ACOG, 1P29, or ELCAN, Hensoldt Model 2, SCROME J4 are all good options.  as for tactics, take kits to be prepared for the opposition. You can see the opposition assets in the loading, and generally you'd want to take kits in your squad corresponding to that. if there are a lot of tanks, a HAT kit would be good (you generally want a LAT regardless of the situation). If it's open and there's air support, try to get an AA kit."
ProjectReality,387pcz,mrtrotskygrad,2,Tue Jun 2 13:19:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  Is there a way to change which enhanced sight you use on a weapon or is it locked per each weapon or nation?  Also, I don't see an option for Heavy AT (only AT) or AA kits, are these special kits that have to be requested?"
ProjectReality,387pcz,mrtrotskygrad,4,Tue Jun 2 13:31:17 2015 UTC,"on the spawnable kits hit the ""alt"" or ""std"" buttons to choose your weapon/weapon configuration.  HAT, AA, Sniper, DMR, MMG are all requestable kits. Manual page 32, read it."
ProjectReality,387pcz,mrtrotskygrad,2,Tue Jun 2 14:05:38 2015 UTC,"Alright thanks.  Just to confirm, the only difference between ""alt"" and ""std"" is the gun sight correct?"
ProjectReality,387pcz,POVFox,4,Tue Jun 2 14:31:57 2015 UTC,"as I said, it depends on the faction and kit.   For example on irregular medic, it's the difference between a Lee Enfield Mk.III* and a SKS  On British Army Medic it's the difference between L85A2 with SUSAT or L85A2 with ironsight.  On IDF Medic it's the difference between TAR-21 with 2x magnifier or their special M16 with a Meprolight RDS  On Canadian Army Breacher it's the difference between a C7 with Elcan or C8 with holo."
ProjectReality,387pcz,POVFox,3,Tue Jun 2 14:47:11 2015 UTC,"Other equipment can vary as well. Std US LAT gives an AT4, alt US LAT gives a LAW.   Sorry about the acronyms."

ProjectReality,387pcz,Its_a_Friendly,3,Tue Jun 2 21:30:06 2015 UTC,I prefer the British sight. Clear and simple. Or the US ACOG.
ProjectReality,387pcz,mrtrotskygrad,3,Tue Jun 2 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"the british ACOG is the best sight in the game honestly... barely tied with the G36's dual sight, but has better peripheral vision"
ProjectReality,387pcz,Its_a_Friendly,2,Tue Jun 2 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"It is really good (I've done some really good long-range shooting with it), but I think the Canadian scope is also really good. I think most everyone can agree that the Russian scope is probably the worst of the bunch, though."
ProjectReality,387pcz,mrtrotskygrad,3,Tue Jun 2 17:44:49 2015 UTC,"the buis on the ELCAN is inferior though.  I don't know, I kind of like the russian scope once you get used to it."
ProjectReality,387pcz,Its_a_Friendly,4,Tue Jun 2 17:49:45 2015 UTC,"I like the ELCAN buis, actually, because they're really rather simple, and give amazing visibility. They're not like the British scope and its red dot stuck on the top, which can block the view sometimes. It's still a great scope, though, even if it is a bit ugly.  I mean, the Russian scope is great when you're aiming down it-wonderful for some long-range shooting- but in pretty much every other case it's pretty crappy. The scope-in time is long (unlike, say, the ACOG) , there's no peripheral vision while in-scoped, the scope itself is big when you're not scoped in, and the buis are honestly harmful. Sometimes I just used the iron-sighted AK. Hopefully the buffs to the AK-74 make it and its scope more usable again."
ProjectReality,387pcz,mrtrotskygrad,2,Tue Jun 2 17:54:26 2015 UTC,"the elcan BUIS are less precise though :<  oh yeah but imo there's very little difference among the scopes, in the usual infantry warfare in PR as long as it has good zoom and a precise reticle it's good."
ProjectReality,387pcz,Its_a_Friendly,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"Who needs precision when they're five feet away from you? I do agree that scope differences don't make too much of a difference, though they are notable."
ProjectReality,387pcz,mrtrotskygrad,2,Tue Jun 2 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"well it's always nice to have a BUIS that's usable from 5 feet out to a  hundred, instead of 5 feet to maybe 30 or so..."
ProjectReality,387pcz,raw11j,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:18:12 2015 UTC,"But then you can just use the scope, right? I just rather like the usability of the elcan."
ProjectReality,387pcz,Contra420,2,Tue Jun 2 18:20:44 2015 UTC,"I prefer the red dot for medium range, less obtrusive I guess. And the ACOG reticle is thinner than the ELCAN's massive bottom post, so it's better for observation IMO"

If I see you tk in-game and I suspect it's on purpose I'll do all that I can to ensure you're unable to play this game anymore. I encourage anyone coming across this shit post to do the same.

ProjectReality,386blj,Dantheman190,4,Tue Jun 2 04:09:37 2015 UTC,I think that the prta servers are the best to join. Not only the NA one.
ProjectReality,386blj,fiddler112,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:37:17 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. Whilst HOG has had stability issues in the past I've always seen a lot more teamwork and coordination from them, as well as good admins that don't tolerate any bullshit from disruptive players.  FCV is probably one of the worst servers I've ever played on - the rules are sloppy, people generally just do what they feel like and it always feels terribly organised.   PRTA NA is better just because they have a solid set of rules, and active, responsible admins.  For European servers NEW and PRTA seem to be the best."

ProjectReality,386blj,fiddler112,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:38:20 2015 UTC,"Pelitutka is one of the oldest PR server hosts (7+ years) and has very dedicated admins, right now there are just barely enough of them (they are actively bringing back old admins and recruiting new ones they can trust) because the server wasn't populated too often after v1.0 due to low amount of players and competition between other European servers.   Pelitutka is a very good server to play on, just give it a few days to a week to bring in a few more admins."
ProjectReality,386blj,hepokattivaan,3,Wed Jun 3 02:57:43 2015 UTC,"I'm biased, seeing as I'm an admin for PRTA NA, but all of our admins have been instructed to be accommodating to new players and show them the ropes. Just let us know you're new and ask who's squad to join and you'll find the help you need.   As far as other American servers go, I'd recommend sticking to the other established servers with solid admin teams like HOG and CIA.   I don't ever play on the European servers but PRTA EU is going to be similar to your experiences on PRTA NA. NEW and MERK are also very good servers."
ProjectReality,386blj,Chefmoto1,2,Tue Jun 2 05:16:25 2015 UTC,1st NEW and PRTA  2nd CIA and possibly FCV (less admins and less rules like roadkill)  3rd HOG  After that come the random Russian Asian and other populated servers.
ProjectReality,386blj,LiamNL,2,Tue Jun 2 05:45:04 2015 UTC,"If the server has a website with rules (ingame check !website and !rules), as well as active admins (ingame check !admins), then you found a basic PR server for you.

ProjectReality,386blj,KetchupTubeAble19,2,Tue Jun 2 12:46:41 2015 UTC,"All PRTA admins are under strict guidelines to help new players learn.  On NA keep an eye out for players with clan tags such as TZ, TAC JTF and L&P, these clans have good squad leaders are are very accommodating.  On EU lookout for F and SH,cloth these clans are weird and put symbols next to the tag to show rank.  On any PRTA server, use the !admins command to see if admins are online and ask to join their squad if it's locked and there's room.

ProjectReality,384nir,TheMerchantOfMenace,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"Step 0.  The first and most important part of getting good at PR is to think squadwork, think teamwork, that is, think seriously about being a contributing member of your squad and your team, if you want to improve and eventually play with the best PR players (and if you want the better PR players to want to work with you).    PR is all about, and SHOULD be all about Teamwork... that's what the DEVs intended, and that is what kept PR so strong over so many years, its heavy focus, by design, on teamwork is what makes PR so unique, and what makes the PR gameplay so satisfying when it's played as intended.  Your squad and team depend on you to contribute to its success and survival on the battlefield.  As long as you keep this in mind and care about being an asset to your squad and team, over time on the battlefield you will learn a lot more with this mentality, and you will improve faster and will become a better PR player than the person who is only in it for himself or his stats.  Being on a ""well-oiled machine"" of a squad on a PR server is a great feeling, you'll know it when you experience it.  Be intent on teamwork and being a valuable squad/team member and you will fit right in with the PR community."

ProjectReality,384c3l,herper147,2,Mon Jun 1 21:21:36 2015 UTC,I think the manual is well made but it has a lot of info and does a poor job at highlighting what is really important throughout.
ProjectReality,384c3l,Miyelsh,2,Tue Jun 2 03:22:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, but at the same time I haven't had the same experience. I even led a squad and had someone help me understand what I was doing and it turned out pretty well. But the point about the manual is definitely true. It doesn't even cover how to join a squad."
ProjectReality,384c3l,Ipwnurface,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:27:36 2015 UTC,"That was what threw me, it says you need to join a squad. So I sit clicking join for 5 minutes on all the different squads and I couldn't do anything. I ask in chat and just get told ""ugh these fking newbs, go read the manual genius"".  Even now it occasionally won't let me do certain things like spawn in on anything other than a FOB despite no enemies near it and sometimes I have to make a new squad as the join button doesn't work. I wish the manual actual had screenshots that explained the clunky UI rather than a few tiny little symbols and it still missed 2 or 3 symbols that I had to lookup on the forums."
ProjectReality,384c3l,herper147,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"For that spawning on a FOB problem, select a different spawn point, then reselect that FOB you want to spawn on, then hit deploy. That's always worked for me.  Also, to join a squad, you have to be alive, except for your first entry into a round, which lets you join freely.  Still, I do admit the manual does miss or poorly explain some things, and that you can't remember everything in it. When I first started, I had it loaded up and alt-tabbed to it many times!"
ProjectReality,384c3l,Its_a_Friendly,3,Mon Jun 1 22:09:48 2015 UTC,"Generally if you can't spawn on a FOB, it's because the game can't figure out where to physically place you. Easiest way around this is to mash the enter key a ton - it'll retry a bunch of times and should let you spawn in a couple seconds."

Test airfield is a good place to learn the flight characteristics of each air vehicles.   The best way to learn advanced flying is to play muttrah and practice there. Land on roofs and practice flying below rooftops or rooftop level. Practice quick landings and crate drops. Do those and youll be good to go.

ProjectReality,382qfn,zman122333,2,Mon Jun 1 17:17:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I read the manual and didn't find it extremely helpful.  Specifically, the portion on healing was unclear.  When shot, you begin to bleed.  It isn't clear in the manual which piece of equipment stops the bleeding.  It also isn't really clear how to use the field dressing / epi pen etc.  When I was hit as an assault man, I tried to use the field dressing on myself to stop the bleeding mechanic (flashing red screen) by left clicking while having the dressing selected.  It goes through the mechanic of ripping the pack, but I often still continue to bleed... am I doing something wrong?    Overall I am very excited for this game and look forward to playing it."
ProjectReality,382qfn,Leeham721,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:04:05 2015 UTC,"No you are doing fine :) the patch is just that, a patch. Its meant to heal you only a little, if youve obly taken a small amount of damage the odds are the patch will do the job. But if youve taken a decent amount of damage the patch will slightly heal you but you eill continue to bleed out. This is when you seek a medic who will use the medic kit to fully heal you. If you are close to a medic dont use your patch its just a waste. But if you need to book it across a field before you can get to your medic use the patch.   The Epi pen is used when an a allied team member is down but not dead. Lying prone next to them and stabbing them with the pen will bring them back up and then you must heal them with the medic kit immediately or they will bleed out and die.   I hope that answered your question!"
ProjectReality,382qfn,temppa123,2,Tue Jun 2 14:59:34 2015 UTC,"Alright thanks for the detailed explanation.  I thought the field dressing would stop the bleeding regardless of how much ""health"" was lost.  Makes sense that it wouldn't if severely wounded I guess."

Gun looks and sounds also help a lot in identification. If you're not absolutely sure, you can always check you map if you have the time (really, you should keep checking it, so if you encounter unexpected people you'll know that they're enemy).

I joined some years ago (long before joining this sub) at around .83, and PR has been my favourite game for all those reasons you listed (and a couple more) ever since. The others naturally come with time, but soon enough you'll appreciate the fun of Squad-leading, when you've got a responsive, effective squad, co-operating via radio with other squads, CAS assets, armour, mortar teams, etc.; you'll notice that rounds rarely play out the same; and sooner or later you'll actually 'get good' with some kits—being able to lob 40mm grenades, practically without aiming, directly where I want them is probably my favourite skill of all, but again, only came with time.   Above all, have a blast. I'm Kameniev in-game, and usually play CIA, Kokan&H, PRTA EU servers. I don't SL that often, but might start again given the influx of new players.

Think I first heard of PR maybe a couple years or ago on a great FPS mods list on some gaming mag/site or other, watched some vids of it now and then since.

Are there any Australian or Oceanic/SEA region servers with a regular decent player count? How many players does it take to really have a good match? If I were to play on a non Oce/SEA server, does having a high but steady and bearable ping (say around 200-250) typically affect you much in terms of gameplay? (in something like Insurgency for instance I've found you might as well just not play if your ping is 200ms or above) Are there certain roles I should stick to or avoid when lagging somewhat? Do players tend to get pissed off at players in the 200-300ms ping range? Can I expect to get yelled at for missing a moving target 10 times, kicked for pinging etc.?"

Lag isn't too bad in PR because most of the time you're shooting long distance and using suppressing fire instead of being in CQB situations where ping REALLY matters. Operating mortars is probably the best thing you can do if you have a low framerate or high ping.   Do players tend to get pissed off at players in the 200-300ms ping range? Can I expect to get yelled at for missing a moving target 10 times, kicked for pinging etc.?   Nah. Deviation in PR makes sure it's almost impossible to hit anything already.

ProjectReality,380x9f,mycatatemyface,3,Mon Jun 1 09:46:26 2015 UTC,"Cool not bad. Do you reckon the game seems to be getting a lot of new players who are also sticking with the game, like do you (or anyone who reads this I guess) expect playercounts will die down a lot soon or stay somewhat steady?"

PR is pretty much the only thing that keeps me on Windows, but I had trouble getting it to run under Wine last time I tried.

ProjectReality,37yqj0,SplodeyDope,1 point,Sun May 31 19:08:03 2015 UTC,All PoL should be doing is creating a prefix folder and lauching the program with Wine... Maybe try different Wine versions?
ProjectReality,37yqj0,caligari87,2,Sun May 31 19:12:21 2015 UTC,Yeah same result.  Tried a couple different versions of Wine and still the same.  Gonna keep fiddling around though.
ProjectReality,37yqj0,SplodeyDope,2,Sun May 31 21:23:41 2015 UTC,Same. I tried for hours with wine and just couldn't do it. Installed Windows again and it doesn't work here either. No one seems to have an answer for my problem.
ProjectReality,37yqj0,Nikotiiniko,3,Tue Jun 2 04:33:33 2015 UTC,PR has more players than RO2 at the moment :O
ProjectReality,37yqj0,Mannmilch,5,Mon Jun 1 00:37:44 2015 UTC,I'm a new player and I get the feeling it's the blind leading the blind. Really bad time for me to try and get into the game.   Hardest thing is just knowing who to shoot at this point.
ProjectReality,37yqj0,Arch_0,6,Sun May 31 15:50:32 2015 UTC,"No worries, join an infantry squad with someone that is properly leading or at least attempts to. Tell the squad that you are new and people are more then willing to help you out! Just let them know you are new, as soon as they realize you are willing to learn and cooperate they will teach you the ropes."
ProjectReality,37yqj0,disnoxxio,3,Sun May 31 15:53:38 2015 UTC,Thanks. I've seen quite a few people just telling people to RTFM but there's still a lot that's not in the manual. I'm sitting watching a Bluedrake42 video to pick up a few bits and pieces. I really want to see some teamwork but my squadmates just wander off in all directions.   I think it would be best if I wait until next week when things have calmed down.
ProjectReality,37yqj0,Arch_0,7,Sun May 31 16:18:58 2015 UTC,In the end the players will be filtered. People leave immediatly or they stick around. Once you had that round with a nice cooperating infantry squad your good. Just join squads with names like: Infantry/ Mumble INF/ Teamwork INF or in my case random names and then INF behind it (Potato inf) etc etc.   You will recognize them soon enough. For now A lot of servers are being populated that haven't been populated in ages and therefore lacking administration (manpower) so those servers might be flooded with new players and no guidance. You'll figure the servers out soon enough. Servers as PRTA/NEW/MERK/FCV have been around for a while and high likely will stick around.
ProjectReality,37yqj0,disnoxxio,3,Sun May 31 16:29:27 2015 UTC,"Are you the guy who created the Potato Inf squad today? :D Saw that and though ""Thank god I am in 'Spaghetti'."" lol"
ProjectReality,37yqj0,teabagZz,3,Sun May 31 18:19:33 2015 UTC,I always do Potato INF so yeah it was high likely me ;).

ProjectReality,37yqj0,LiamNL,2,Sun May 31 21:31:44 2015 UTC,I did check some of the tutorials. It's just all the little things really. I've played a lot of Arma/DayZ and other games like PR.  I actually think I was in your squad earlier!
ProjectReality,37yqj0,Arch_0,2,Sun May 31 21:54:22 2015 UTC,"Do what I do, take advantage of this time to practice game mechanics. Nobody will notice you messing up or playing with things you kind-of-shouldn't be playing with. (Especially on co-op servers.)"
ProjectReality,37yqj0,sf171k,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:47:51 2015 UTC,I just hope it lasts. It was like this last patch (not at the same level but several 100p servers full) and only lasted about a week before it was down to 1-2 servers full.
ProjectReality,37yqj0,alttabbins,2,Sun May 31 19:38:05 2015 UTC,I think you are talking about 1.0. That release never even got this high and was our most anticipated release ever. I feel standalone really changed something. I'm sure have expanded the life of PR by a long stretch.

I think a lot of that was from the hype over on the squad forums and the YouTubers promoting us. The standalone has definately opened us up to a new audience though so we'll see how many decide to stick around. I doubt we'll be seeing 1100+ players for long although it's a beautiful thing to see!"

ProjectReality,37yqj0,KetchupTubeAble19,5,Mon Jun 1 01:38:22 2015 UTC,"Hello! I am an admin at [NEW]. Like pretty much any server, we have a automatic script that automatically removes players that are spawned in and not joining a squad for several minutes. The script only applies after your initial spawn-in. If you haven't spawned in yet, you can take all the time in the world to look at the map and the script won't do anything.  However, what might have happened in your case - is that you have been removed for being afk. In that case, you were also warned about it priot to being kicked. Please understand that if we have so many players waiting to join, we have to be rather strict in monitoring afk's - People without a squad not joining a squad and being idle for a while will immediately be warned and (if not replying) removed from the server so someone else can take over. I apologize on behalf of the admin team for (if that happened) removing you too early :)"

Yesterday a new guy was in our squad and we were pinned in a compound by some insurgents. New guy got hit and had to patch himself to stop from bleeding out. He didn't know that he had dropped the patch so he kept clicking. Didn't realize the patch was down until after he had switched to the grenade and thrown it. At us. It was hilarious."
ProjectReality,37zide,AFatDarthVader,6,Sun May 31 20:15:17 2015 UTC,"Ouch, that's hilarious. I would have laughed too. Yeah, just remember that conventional forces explosives are almost all timer-based, no detonators.   I usually prefer to play LMG or grenadier, but there's something really fun about Breacher/Scout too. The shotguns are incredibly satisfying to use, and being ""the go-to guy"" for room clearing, asset destruction, or location access issues makes me feel special."

So conventional forces have a 20 or 30 second timer allowing you to place two charges and split before they explode and militia forces like taliban, insurgent, arf, militia have less of a timer.

ProjectReality,380l4z,Its_a_Friendly,3,Mon Jun 1 00:54:25 2015 UTC,It's 7.62x39mm (meaning it's a 2 hit kill) and the recoil is SO much better than the ak47 (the gun the insurgents had as a default before the AKM)
ProjectReality,380l4z,adrenalinetooth,2,Mon Jun 1 01:19:08 2015 UTC,"Well, the AK47 had a large amount of recoil. From the 5 minutes I've used the AKM, the recoil is noticeably reduced but still packs a punch. It's like a hybrid between an AK-47 and an AK-74."
ProjectReality,380l4z,StringyLow,2,Mon Jun 1 03:00:45 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone
ProjectReality,380l4z,ElGenitalGrande,3,Mon Jun 1 03:39:49 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you're likelier to run into AKMs than 47s so it adds to realism. There is a lot of detail on the AKM in comparison to the other guns. IMO they can remove some of the details like the number on the dustcover to make the gun look more generic.
ProjectReality,3817cj,meetthemyth,3,Mon Jun 1 02:39:33 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi8VDmCjEMM  an old video but it goes over some points about sniping and deviation just to give you and idea, then get a feel for it. Usually for rifles I just count to 3-4 then shoot."
ProjectReality,3817cj,Marginalguy,2,Mon Jun 1 03:51:52 2015 UTC,Yes there is bullet drop. They drop after a certain distance.

ProjectReality,3817cj,atasergeynowak,2,Mon Jun 1 02:51:32 2015 UTC,There are tracer rounds every x number of bullets. So you can get a feel for it.
ProjectReality,3817cj,parker_buchanan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:22:03 2015 UTC,Yeah it's hard to tell. I'm a noobie too. I'm sure there is a good guide on it somewhere. However I know with snipers I didn't notice much drop unless after 600m.
ProjectReality,3817cj,jinek67,2,Mon Jun 1 10:30:55 2015 UTC,"Bullet drop after 600m.  View distance is 600m-800m   Infantry wise, there is no need to account for a bullet drop when shooting unless you are shooting a sniper rifle and shooting silhouettes. A pointless activity time wise and a waste of ammo. Also, terrain render would also mess you up as some hills would not be rendered properly.   Vehicles coaxials have drop at 600-800m. ONLY THE COAX HAS A DROP."

ProjectReality,37zl8h,Arc_Shielder,2,Mon Jun 1 17:08:12 2015 UTC,I was pretty annoyed when there were people shitting on him because he was streaming and playing the game. Some people in this community somehow believe that more people playing the game is bad. The servers were about as good as they always had been with him playing it..and there were no stream snipers.  Whoever it was that was complaining about him steaming the game and being in the server is a complete douchebag. Definitely not a representative of the community. Most people aren't like that -- unless they're complete elitist retards. We should be happy that someone as popular as lirik is playing the game...it only means good things.

PR Mumble is based on the Mumble API(voice program like Teamspeak or Skype) so if the normal mumble works then it means it's specific to PR mumble, if it doesn't work on normal mumble then you have to look into troubleshooting connection issues with mumble.

ProjectReality,37y98a,Anon49,7,Sun May 31 12:56:49 2015 UTC,I'd guess its because technically we're pirating BF2 with this standalone version.  The guys who made it said as much (can't find the link).  Its just that EA basically abandoned BF2 and is unlikely to take any action against PR.  Edit: /r/Games has a day old post about PR 1.3.  Its a better sub than /r/gaming anyway.

ProjectReality,381jmp,Fiyahazard,3,Mon Jun 1 04:28:47 2015 UTC,"You will probably like this a lot. Not having a mic is...generally seen as a big problem. It is very common for people without mics to be kicked from squads, it's nothing personal but many squad leaders really try to have maximum communication efficiency in their squads, chat technically works but it's just too slow for a lot of the things you will be experiencing. You can still find ways to play, but I highly recommend you get a mic as soon as possible or you won't be enjoying the game as much.   Until than you will find it's easier if when without a mic you join insurgent factions in the insurgency game mode, where there is generally less concentrated teamwork, a lot more laid back with a lot of players there to unleash their inner allahu snackbar derp mode. Many of the squads tend to have less mic communication and just focus on killing western coalitions and having a lot of fun.  On the other hand, you will have a very hard time in a modern-conventional-army style faction like US/UK/CA/etc., where there is a very apparent focus on immediate teamwork and communication, as you would expect realistically.   Right now due to the huge influx of new players there's less kicking  of mic-less players, just because there's so many without mics, you may or may not notice the things I've mentioned for some time until the community settles in again and the new players figure out how the game works and microphone comms become normal again."

I did read the manual - let's all forget that it's like 50+ pages with a million things to remember. Do people want the community to grow? Fuck it took the guy approximately 2.5 seconds to tell me how to get the proper kit. Also, the PR website is so goddamn slow right now that it's nearly impossible for people to download the manual anyway. People not willing to encourage and support newbies = dead game fast"

However, I am still not sure how accessible this would be if I wanted to play with a close group as I would with say Arma 2 & 3. My questions then are:   Is there an easy way to get into a squad with your group/clan? I figure auto-balancing and such may get in the way. If not, is there a co-op mode that I can host for them?   I have no aversion at all to joining this community, of course. I just wonder if this may be more geared toward beer-fueled pubbing nights than scheduled game nights with the clan. Thank you!"
ProjectReality,37vzbn,RockPie,3,Tue Jun 2 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"Get yourselves a clan tag - This way admins can see that you belong together, and if they are doing their job properly they'll switch you to the right team. Use ""!r yourmessage"" to request teamswitches etc"
ProjectReality,37vzbn,RockPie,2,Thu Jun 4 01:50:34 2015 UTC,"Almost hassle free, that is if there's a free squad slot available. if not you can always join a squad that has done room for your mates. If your scattered between teams you can ask an Admin to switch your friends to the same side. There are 4 active servers last time I checked. You'll get the best experience though on multiplayer   Welcome to PR!"

ProjectReality,37xpqz,Townsie,2,Sun May 31 07:36:41 2015 UTC,thanks a lot. Already feeling welcome!
ProjectReality,37xpqz,Jayhawker2092,5,Sun May 31 07:49:31 2015 UTC,"Just to reiterate what /u/Townsie said but a little more in-depth;   Read your manual. Make sure you have a mic. Join server and a squad. As a beginner I would suggest just sticking with the regular rifleman kit for your first couple rounds just to get the feel of things. As Townsie said, practice with different kits and vehicles in the CO-OP servers or single player. Listen to your squad leader. If your squad leader isn't talking or doesn't respond, join a new squad if possible. Try to tag along with a coordinated squad if you can't join another. Don't get yourself kicked or banned from the few servers there are by (creating an early squad, wasting/soloing vehicles, stealing kits/vehicles, excessive or intentional teamkilling, etc.) Each server has its own rules but those are the general ones. You can see a server's rules in-game by typing !rules into your squad/team/all chat. Have fun and meet some interesting people. We're a small community with people from all over the world so you'll have a chance or two to have some crazy conversations and experiences.   Also, from my point of view, the best way to enjoy Project Reality is to play like you and your squad have only one life to live. It forces you to play more intelligently and it just makes the experience more realistic. Not to mention preserves tickets on AAS maps... Play the way that is fun to you though obviously. Just be respectful of others in doing so.  One more tip I couldn't leave out. ;) Check your map. Often. Really often. I tend to glance at mine every 10 to 20 seconds when I'm on the move."
ProjectReality,37xpqz,a_posh_trophy,3,Sun May 31 09:32:44 2015 UTC,Can you keep the map open while moving?
ProjectReality,37xpqz,Jayhawker2092,3,Sun May 31 11:21:32 2015 UTC,"You can by hitting M and keep that map open but it doesn't show the location of friendlies or flags/caches iirc. To get the map with those, you have to hit caps. I'm really tired atm so I might be remembering incorrectly."
ProjectReality,37xpqz,Townsie,2,Sun May 31 11:54:37 2015 UTC,"m displays the same map as caps, however with caps you get the movement of your mouse and can select units to see who they are. i find myself hitting caps more than m honestly and i know a few other players do the same thing. however if its important that i keep the movement of my character's head, i will use m."

You're basically intercepting function calls, doing what you want to do, and depending on what you've done, you either jump to the original function or return to the call point, effectively convincing the game that you are the game.  I would be hard pressed to say that changing the FOV is impossible. Difficult, yes. Dedicated research would be needed directly into where the FOV values are stored and calculated.

ProjectReality,37vzsd,a_posh_trophy,3,Sun May 31 13:07:16 2015 UTC,In the BF2 Engine When a player joins the server he gets an ID. The game was designed for 64 players. PR managed to change that to 230~. This is one of the side effects.

Also, many squad leaders I know always name their squads the same thing (if its infantry).

He's also right in saying that you'll come to recognize names. After playing for several years now, I recognize plenty of people. Joining a clan is a good idea though if you want to take part in the tournaments or some clan map events. I enjoy squading up with random people. You'll meet some interesting characters from around the world and have the opportunity for long conversations. I've sat with a complete stranger alongside a road for roughly 30 minutes waiting for that perfect moment to blow an ied on an LAV. We talked about a million things. Integrate yourself into the community, be respectful, and you'll be fine.  Just make sure you have a mic, read your manual, join a server, join a squad, don't screw around excessively (examples: teamkilling, wasting vehicle assets, wasting kits, and general jackassery) and you're good to go!"

It gets distracting because you're essentially listening to two different people talking to you at once. Look up some royalty free music online and use that.

I wish it were more well known that bullets can penetrate some materials and that the 7.62mm rounds can also open doors and gates. Knowing that AKs & G3s have high penetration capability has won engagements at corners for me more than a few times. Also using the bolt action rifles to ding guys partially covered or on balconies has been fun."
ProjectReality,37h1h2,StringyLow,2,Wed May 27 23:27:13 2015 UTC,"The 7.62 and the 5.56 can go through wood and sheet metal with no problem. Shooting the locks off of gates is something the 7.62 can chew up that the 5.56 cannot.    You can shoot through the corner of doorways, so if the enemy contact back up, keep following him with your sights and shoot through the wall.    You can shoot through corners in close combat so if you know that an enemy is close, round the corner blazing.  The bolt action rifles have great penetration and can shoot through some concrete walls. So does the PKM. Blasting guys in T-buildings through the wall is great sport.  The .50 call will ventilate any building/vehicle that isn't a bunker or heavily armored.    These are just observations I've found to be helpful so experiment."

ProjectReality,3790u2,Kameniev,6,Tue May 26 00:51:06 2015 UTC,"RTFM as /u/Gentlefood said and /u/mcflyjr retorted; Step #2 is learn to medic. It's another foundation of good PR play, and the market for medics is always stronger than that for other kits (perhaps SLs excluded). You should learn other kits like LAT, AR, Grenadier etc. after you've got these two firmly under your belt, since by then you understand PR's important balance between dishing out pain and staying alive."

Updated Skorpion to have 2 additional magazines on the Iraqi Insurgent medic.   YEEES. Now I can actually play insurgent medic and actually be able to shoot something.   Added Nuijamaa (2km) (FR vs RU) (AAS, Skirmish). Removed Arctic Lion. Removed Shikotan Island.   You win one, you lose two. Hopefully we get some new community maps soon. Though Dovre is now RU vs. the Dutch.   Updated Kozelsk Updated AAS 16, 64, 128 layers to have a slight ticket bleed at start to force Russian Forces to attack, updated >ticket counts to make up for the bleed, and swapped out most BMP-3 with BMP-2.

If you're really interested, I'd recommend trying to find a usable copy of BF2 somewhere, as I don't know if the standalone will be coming out with the 1.3 patch (which should be out soon) or not."

ProjectReality,36xoz1,Its_a_Friendly,2,Sat May 23 01:53:46 2015 UTC,"The game's pretty much maxed out what graphics it can do. Going standalone doesn't mean that they're changing the engine. So no, I don't believe the game is getting much of a graphics update.  PR is reasonably load-intensive (it doesn't have a lot of optimization due to being rigged out of a 10-year-old game.), but if you knock most settings down to low, it should work on most reasonably strong computers. If anything, at least you can try."

Think about that: Your whole team banzai charges at an Allied objective and out of nowhere comes this kid declaring a jihad on everyone on the server. I really hope there will be enough admins around once PR goes free.

ProjectReality,36h1uo,darman1138,2,Tue May 19 09:45:41 2015 UTC,Can't view the thread ATM. Anyone kind enough to copy/paste the salient points for me?
ProjectReality,36h1uo,caligari87,6,Tue May 19 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, 1.3 will be standalone. You will not need BF2 anymore to install PR:BF2. You just grab prbf2_1.3.0.0_full.iso, install it, and you're good to go with nothing more to do.  Those on 1.2.1 should be able to patch to 1.3, in which case your BF2 files may be modified slightly, but it shouldn't cause any issues with other mods such as ReviveBF2 and FH2. That said though, if you do play other mods, you should probably grab the full install and install PR:BF2 to a separate directory to avoid any future possible conflict.  Those who just play PR:BF2 may as well grab the full installer as well, uninstall BF2 and PR:BF2 1.2, and start fresh with 1.3. Will save you a few GB's of hard drive space. But yeah, the patch should be there, providing it works (still gotta test it, there might not be one if it breaks things, we'll see)  Legalities aside, it's about the only thing we can do to keep PR:BF2 alive at this time. We're not as ready as EA/DICE were to let our game die and all our hard work go to waste. And like others have said in the thread, abandonware, etc, I don't think EA will care too much. Of course, if they actually do care, their legal team is more than welcome to send us a cease and desist order, and we'll simply revert back to the way things are at the moment. Naturally, that'd do wonders for their public image.  But anyway, it's not like we've ever followed the EULA. Ever since we included the BF2:SF content in PR (when was that, 0.6?), we've been breaking the EULA. Add to that the 100p servers, the new master server, things like PRMumble, BUIS, and a whole bunch of other stuff... The list of things we've ""illegally"" done is actually rather large. I'm still yet to ever receive a single message from EA or DICE, so, well, shrug...  So to those looking to buy BF2, and you can wait and don't want to play other mods, you should probably hold off until we release 1.3. To the inevitable question of when 1.3 will be released, when it's ready ."

Anyways if you want to get a key you want to download a Keygen. A keygen will provide a randomized cd-key. Just make sure you look at the seeds you don't want any nasty malware or worse.  Just look for Battlefield 2 Keygen.

Single-player co-op maps are different layouts than the ones you'll play online and the vehicles at the main base are mostly reserved for AI use and won't let you in them. So, try to find the correct Apache for example. There's usually one that works for human players but not always on every map layout."

ProjectReality,31x5ld,Anon49,2,Fri Apr 10 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"I have a i5 3.5 from nov.   You sure you don't have an Nvidia card? Because there's an extra processor on it for video encoding and it'll be a waste if you don't use it.  What exactly is the problem?  If you're asking about the technical options, It very much depends on your system and purpose. Do you have enough disk space? Do you have no problems uploading 20GB files to Youtube overnight?  Are you using a video editing software that is going to reencode it?  If you have enough disk space and don't mind uploading overnight OR if you have enough disk space and going to use a video editing software: aim for very high bitrates. With an i5 and CPU encoding, I'd set the x264 preset in advanced to superfast instead of veryfast, and bitrates to 25mbps in 1080p60fps. if it still struggles on superfast, go for ultrafast and 30mbps."

I was thinking about buying a new HDD. The only thing I have is windows movie maker and that will encode to 30 fps, so all I have to upload to youtube is what FRAPS outputs. My problem that I was asking about in my post is that I can only record one channel of input at a time.

Custom models of weapons, vehicles, buildings, and other assets are much higher quality than stock BF2. 100 v 100 Player takes a HUGE toll on performance. Custom sounds even come into play and effect frames per second.   The computer that the OP linked will play it fine, but the game has changed by a lot since BF2 was released. Its changed a lot since PR was released. Its hardly the same game. With that said, I would look more into an Intel set up.

And as for buttons not responding, it depends on what you're trying to do and when. I'd need more info there.  I'm also not sure what you mean by the weapons not being smooth.

The devs from PR took a lot of that and added layer after layer of changes to it to make it feel more realistic but at the same time balance out the things that made BF2 so much fun. Its a combo I hope they keep in SQUAD and PR2.

It's very reassuring to see that there is still progress in this game. Although it does seem that this month it's less about game mechanics and more about graphical assets.

After that jump in a training server to get the feel of the vehicles and small arms. When your ready join a squad in the training servers and try out the heavy asset kits, Heavy AT, MG, AA, the whole lot. And if you ever do plan on flying or driving armor just do it on the training server first. Other than that after you get a good feel for the game and the mechanics jump in a standard server and ask your squad leader what they need. Good luck and have fun!"

It was on FCV scenarios, with the convoy scenario, on Karbala. One checkpoint was on the west side of the northwest village, so I got out there as a sapper to help my squad defend it (the enemy had nearly overrun the first checkpoint in the double-mosque). I laid my mine towards the end of the west-side dirt road (where it connects to the main paved boulevard), and put down a couple of rock piles to distract blufor. So along comes the enemy (already decently beat up from the trip across the desert), with their commander (as I learned later) in a humvee, I think. He gets out of the humvee, but it then immediately hits the mine and puts him on the ground. I come out shooting, but get killed by other enemies. Seeing the chance (I think someone on our team knew that commander was in that humvee), I spawned back at base (no other nearby spawns were open in the first place-we'd been cleared out of that village), looking for something to use. Lo and behold, there's a bomb car. I quickly grab it (asking to be sure on the way, but it was INS so you can't really claim stuff anyhow), drive up the north-south road south of the double-mosque, turn west across the desert, and then come up behind the striker and a couple infy guys trying to get the commander up. They got exploded, and then we won the game.  Suffice to say, bomb cars are fun, but they are rare and very risky."

I like that.   The BLUFOR cache marker can be inaccurate if BLUFOR doesn't gather any Intel points.  The Intel system now correlates with the maximum distance that the cache-marker for BLUFOR can be from the actual cache position.   perfect.

Wait, can the Insurgent CO choose where the cache goes? Hopefully there's something to limit him from just planting it as close as possible to the Uncap.  Also, can Blufor ""update"" the cache marker by getting more intel points, or is it stuck the way it is once it spawns?"
ProjectReality,2v0wy9,Its_a_Friendly,1 point,Sun Feb 8 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, however, it needs to be at a certain distance from the previous cache and at a distance from the main base. Yes, by gathering intel points, their cache marker will update."

Though I do think this might just lead to CO's having a list of a few caches that are good and just using those over and over again, and thus making the cache attacks samey over time. I mean, I guess Blufor could predict that, but then things get even more samey, with Blufor ultimately flying by each popular cache site to check, and then rushing it as soon as possible. It'd be a faster gamemode, but what I like about Insurgency is about how unpredictable it is; you can be fighting in one corner of the map, and the charge across to another one, or stumble across the second cache along the way as Blufor, or have the second cache spawn as Ins and race to defend it. I haven't played the new mode yet, though, so I guess I can't judge.  And thanks for clearing up the second point. Does Blufor still have to destroy 5 caches to win?"
ProjectReality,2v0wy9,Its_a_Friendly,1 point,Sun Feb 8 02:04:11 2015 UTC,"True, however there have always been shitty caches in PR that are just a joke really, so imo it's fine to balance things out a bit, especially on asset-heavy map. There is a shitton of cache locations on every map, and what I really like is that the 'seaching' aspect is back in the game. As long as the Bluefor marker is inaccurate, they have to search for the cache within the perimeter and it can be anywhere really. They need to gather intel and make smart guesses as to where the cache has been placed. Adds much more tactical variety, especially for insurgents.  Current (not-alpha) gameplay is just insurgents being bored, running around and getting killed because sitting on a cache is just boring and in the end you get pwned by APCs. This has changed now.   However, some new changes were already added: Following changes have been made on the fly, the changes will applied with the next map being loaded:  17:30 PRT Updated Intel System - long range kills grant Intel Points again Updated Intel System - Reduced needed Intel to get the marker closer, to test some technical stuff (temporary change)            20:40 PRT Cache spawnpoints get disabled once it gets known to the enemy Enemies close to cache should disable cache  21:33 PRT Revealed caches no longer get their spawnpoint back"
ProjectReality,2v0wy9,mahpmahpmahp,1 point,Sun Feb 8 02:10:37 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I just thought that experienced Ins CO's would make a list of optimal cache positions (like caves, fortress buildings, etc.), and just run through those repeatedly. Then the all the caches would be in the same place in the end (as they're based on the map), and things would get predictable.   Imagine this: Blufor gets a new cache marker in C5. ""Well, looks like the cache is either in the cave in C6, or the building at D4. Let's go, people."" And then it's in one of those two spots, and the game got predictable.  Now, Ins CO's could shake this by planting in non-optimal cache locations, so as to break the expectations of Blufor, but would you really put a cache in some random hut, or down in a cave somewhere? The hut's stealthiness is only going to last a few minutes at most, while the cave could've lasted for quite a while, despite being obviously found.  It's probably too early to make assumptions, but still, I am a bit afraid of that happening. Though I must give props for figuring out ways to break the more abusable parts of INS, like Blufor superfob camping and kill farming."

As long as they enjoy their game I would say, I'm just not in it ;).  I believe the playerbases are quite identical on NA servers so I really dont think FCV is going to bring any change, especially when they allow people to not have a mic.

The other is Squad, a commercial game made by a lot of ex-developers of PR. Squad will aim on becoming an updated PR, but it's so early that everything can change."
ProjectReality,2tzjlc,Philrow,2,Wed Jan 28 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"PR2 is gone,well basically its now just Squad"
ProjectReality,2tzjlc,Forrest02,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:11:43 2015 UTC,Alright that part I can understand..Now I guess the question I have (that no one may have an answer for) is squad going to be anywhere near as teamwork and strategy orientated as project reality. Because I would hope that they are aware that everyone plays pr not for graphics on the old ass engine designed like 10 years but for the gameplay...I am just going to be pissed and see no point in playing the game that is basically counterstrike all over again
ProjectReality,2tzjlc,Vettz,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:47:10 2015 UTC,It will have all the good of PR with none of the old engine. A sequel with a different name essentially.
ProjectReality,2tzjlc,Kameniev,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:58:55 2015 UTC,"It looks interesting. From what we've seen (which you have to remember is very little at the moment) I worry that it looks to be a little more geared towards a 'commercial' market—think Insurgency or Red Orchestra II, for example. They have said themselves that they aim to bridge the gap between casual shooters and simulators, it just depends where exactly they build that bridge.   I could certainly be wrong, but my understanding is that there won't be vehicles, so large maps are somewhat off limits. From their videos, CQB also seems to be the mainstay, though this might change. I'll almost certainly buy it, and the inclusion of a mumble-like VoIP is a massive incentive (aforementioned games, and others, all lack this crucial feature and I think rudimentary teamwork/tactics suffer as a result). The only other feature I consider crucial (squads are a given) is a suppression effect as punishing as PR's. BF3 had one, as does ROII, but neither seem cruel enough to actually make suppression mean something. Anyway, I think they mentioned an open beta 'soon™'."
ProjectReality,2tzjlc,oblivio69,2,Wed Jan 28 22:20:07 2015 UTC,"From what I understood mate, is that they won't have vehicles at the begining (alpha build) but they are going to add vehicles later on , the CQB in the videos is also subject to change since they didn't yet implement a stamina system and you could sprint around as much as you wanted, and they also didn't tweak the movement speed yet from what I understood.  TL;DR PR already bridges the gap between casual shooter and the only simulator that is around : ARMA , I hope Squad will do the same thing, and they mentioned an alpha, but from what I understood it won't be open.  EDIT: I just saw that they launched their website : http://joinsquad.com/about"
ProjectReality,2tzjlc,Kameniev,1 point,Thu Jan 29 12:26:39 2015 UTC,"Vehicles, even transport only, would be a great addition as far as simulation's concerned, as would all those other tweaks and balances.  And PR might bridge that gap already, but it certainly errs on the sim side. Almost every feature opts for sim, whilst almost all casual elements are engine limitations. I worry that with the pressure of a commercial market the final product will inevitably closer resemble CoD and BF (the two games the devs name-dropped) than PR, let alone Arma. If it's as good a middle ground as ROII and (to a lesser extent) Insurgency with Mumble, I'll be happy, but I'm not expecting PR2."
ProjectReality,2tzjlc,igor0liveira,1 point,Thu Jan 29 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"A lot of players moved to Arma 3, for a good reason as well. Arma has much better weapons mechanics.   I wouldn't put it past someone to eventually make a mod for Arma 3."
ProjectReality,2tzjlc,goldontheceiling22,3,Thu Jan 29 15:31:02 2015 UTC,"the problem is, arma its not for pvp with 50x50 for example, trying play tacbf the mod for arma 3 who in someway remeber PR, its kind of impossible, the fps always gonna fail, even if you have a beast machine.. arma 3 its perfect for coop, the true is that (i have almost all arma games and im huge fan of the series)"
ProjectReality,2tzjlc,dolmaface,1 point,Thu Jan 29 17:24:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think Squad will have the same experience as PR:BF2. The PR:BF2 maps are huge and the vehicles make up experience. The fact you can play a map 10 times and have different AAS locations, FOBs and battles really makes the game unpredictable, which I think is the best part of PR, not knowing what is going to happen and having to rely on your team to help each other out.   To me Squad does look good, but from what I see it looks like it doesn't have any vehicles and the maps look quite small, to me this looks like another Insurgency game or Counter-Strike. But hey, what can I say, I'm just some dude who watched a few YouTube trailers."
