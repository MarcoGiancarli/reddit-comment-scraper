Disclaimers aside, it's a sort of odd attempt to marry a pop-psychology influenced auto-bio and some basic writing tips you'll find all over the place.

There are kids books that have such basic stories that the book would never sell a copy without the illustrations that go along with it. And there are books that would be perfectly enjoyable without them.   I would think that if in an average persons' judgement the story is interesting and complex enough to stand on its own then the story was written by the writer and the illustrator should be satisfied with just an artist credit.  If it's all about the drawing though then sure... why not. Great art adds a ton to storytelling. Ask Stan Lee.   Though this does bring up one issue I see that will probably not make most authors want to agree to this.  If the Artist shares story credit then the attribution on the cover or whatever would read ""Teeny Tiny's Pretty Pony"" By Rudigar Snoot and Geronimo Watts. Illustrations By Geronimo Watts.  What this creates is a situation where the artist ends up seeming to get more of the credit than the author. Even though the author may have done all the writing work and the illustrators' contribution is restricted to the (often valuable) story touches that good art can add.   It is were me I'd share credit with the artist. In fact I do. With my webcomics. :D"

The others aren't locked away, they're interacting too. When do you make mention of the others actions?  Another problem I have is the descriptive side. How do you differentiate the bodies in style? In my case, they're identical duplicates, so I can't go off appearance, or name, as they all share that. If they all look different, there is the question of naming. Do they all go by one, or does every body have a personal name, and how do you make that work with their thoughts?

writing,3e3n4j,gregislegend,2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:18 2015 UTC,"Genre is a label and a handy tool, but that's all it is. It shouldn't dictate what you write. A writer must not throw out ideas because they don't confine to the genre they are aiming for.  But it can be a very handy tool at simplifying the description of your story. Saying the words ""Science Fiction"" or ""Fantasy"" to someone automatically triggers an impression. Science Fiction more than likely is about futuristic technology. Fantasy will have magic. Mystery will be about some kind of crime. These are natural associations that you don't have to waste words describing to your readers. You can just say ""coming of age"" or ""bildungsroman"" and that's it. People will immediately paint a picture of teenagers, puberty, growing pains, struggling with emotions, rebelliousness, etc. They are no longer thinking about wizards, black holes, or corporate espionage. een conveniently eliminated for you. You have effectively narrowed down your story into something people can understand in passing conversation. It helps people quickly determine if they are interested in your content.  Often times, I am recommended a book by my friends. ""You HAVE to check out this cool science fiction book."" That's my favorite genre, so immediately, as a consumer I am drawn to it wanting to know more.  That is the benefit of having a genre. If you don't have one, then people may not know what to say. Their initial impression may be slight confusion as they try to make sense of your roundabout way of pitching your idea:   It's adult fiction, but to define it more specifically than that wouldn't work. The novel is technically coming-of-age I suppose, as it follows a girl from her youth to adulthood, but beyond that there are various other elements from many genres.   Imagine trying to say that to an agent, a publisher, or when trying to sell your self published book to someone at Comic Con. They constantly blink at you, wondering what it is you're trying to say. They are watching you intently with mild aversion. Or maybe they look bored and are already turned off by it.   I don't know what to make of it. It sounds like there is a teenager trying to grow up. That's about all I got from it. If I'm not told anything else, then human psychology tells us that I will try to fill in details. The human mind is wired to categorize things. So what details do I fill in? Teenagers are usually portrayed as whiny, ignorant, or naive. Look at Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars Episode 2. I don't want to read about a whining teenager. So I'll probably not listen to anything else you try to describe if I were at your booth at Comic Con.  You don't want to leave your vague story up to the minds of your readership."

The worksheet looks fine if plot/conflict is what you're focusing on for this particular lesson. The only thing that makes me slightly question this is the descriptions for middle and end. You've given them THE bread-and-butter story structure (which is probably the best thing to do unless your students are really experienced), but something makes me wonder if the descriptions are too cookie-cutter... At the same time, I can't really offer a solution. It's not bad by any stretch, but I've got this itch that something could be improved there.   Are you a teacher by profession, or is this a non-school summer class or a one-and-done presentation?

There is no ""order of operations"" when it comes to conceiving a novel. Check out some popular theories/methods of structure, particularly the Snowflake Method and the Monomyth. Those are good starting places, especially on your first novel; they'll help you organize those fragments of thoughts into something comprehensible.  2) Gathering/inception Keep a notebook with you or a google doc/word file/something you can access from anywhere. For a long time (I did an entire year), just write down anything you think about your world, your characters, the plot, specific images you want to include, whatever comes to mind. They might be blurry at first, but your late-night thoughts, random mid-meal epiphanies, TV shows you watch or songs you hear will help clarify them bit by bit. Write these ideas down immediately. This continues while you're working on the novel, too.  3) Outline? It doesn't work for some people, but I definitely recommend it. It keeps you on a trajectory. It saves you from getting lost and giving up. Sometimes it reminds you why you're doing this in the first place. Even if it's rudimentary, a plot outline can rescue you.  4) DRAFT! When you finally feel ready to start, put yourself on a schedule. It doesn't have to be NaNoWriMo crazy, but it should be as rigorous as you can handle. That might be 300 words per day or it might be 2000. Just be sure to press forward every time you write or you'll run out of steam. Try to prohibit yourself from editing during draft one. That's the best way to grind to a halt, I've found.  5) Be flexible and stuff. These steps bleed into each other a lot. I tweaked my outline mid-drafting, I researched while outlining, I added characters while drafting. Then deleted them while editing.  Best of luck to you :) Hope this helps some."

People grow leaps and bounds in writing courses and MFAs. Seriously. However, I do think it's true that the biggest reason people grow so quickly is that they are putting aside the time to dedicate themselves to the craft. So you can get a similar experience by just truly making writing and reading your full time job.   MFAs and genre writing classes don't really provide a great return on investment, so I wouldn't take them if they cost tons of money. But plenty of MFA programs are fully funded."

writing,3e30po,ryanaldred,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:03 2015 UTC,"For creative courses, it's 100% dependent on the teacher and on you.  You could get someone who teaches the creative process in a way that it doesn't quite click with you and it'll seem all too academic (at least St the time, you might find some insight from the class eventually).   You might get someone who teaches and grades very specifically to their own artistic preferences and clashes with your own voice/style so the feedback you get is limited/overly critical or the creative insight doesn't feel relevant. This is especially in freshman classes when you have enough experience that you've already started finding your voice and style.   You might find someone that fits the above but who's preferences largely fall in line with your own. Or if you're open minded, you might go with the flow and gain some insight and writing experience outside your comfort zone; this happened for me with comedy and poetry (although I still disagree with my teacher on lyrical poetry in modern literature).   Or you might get someone who fits the kind of writing you want to do, or someone who's good at teaching the creative process (and for beginners, writing conventions) while encouraging you to pursue your own style and providing good feedback regardless of what you're writing. This, of course, is the preferable scenario.   Talk to other students who've had a certain prof, talk to the prof him/herself, and judge creative writing courses that way. A minor or elective courses give you a lot more flexibility of choosing when you take certain courses than a major."

Not all courses are created equal. Not all programs are created equal.  Here are some of the major benefits I got out of my program:   A fast track of understanding the craft of writing fiction and a vocabulary whereby I could discuss the examination of various levels of fiction in a non-abstract way. Also the ability to understand why a piece of fiction ""works"" even if it's not to my particular taste. Understanding how to sift through the feedback of others and being able to tell when people are trying to help me realize my vision of a piece vs when they are trying to help me ""fix"" a piece to match what they think the peice should be. To ignore the myth of writers block and sit my ass down and write whether I'm in the mood or not. Teachers have zero tolerance for writers block as an excuse for not turning in assignments. They might not be great fiction, but at least you have a draft that you can then rework into something. And even if you can't salvage a draft of something, you can study it to find out why. I have a metric shit ton of raw material to edit into sell-able work. One of the projects I started in school, I reworked into a serialized novel that turned into an Amazon bestseller and received the Kindle Hub Award for Best Fantasy Series of 2014. Have sold several short stories that I wrote the original drafts of in my program.

If you're looking to land a decent, stable writing job - communications and journalism degrees are probably a faster and more direct route to that.   If you are looking to improve generally as a writer, I don't think anything can teach you more that just sitting down (at great length) and reading and writing. It's a hell of a lot cheaper too. Also, you can't get enough time with The Elements of Style - I'd take that book over most college professors I've met.   All that said, I think a creative writing degree is a halfway decent investment if you are looking for a dash of both. I have a degree in Creative Writing from Columbia College Chicago. Granted, it was slow going right after graduation because when your degree has the word ""creative"" in it, the world gives you the finger. That said, I think with the bend society is taking toward social media's viral tendency for top shelf content, a lot of people with money are looking for writers who good at telling stories. I was able to land a job a community paper with my degree. It was a blast, but the pay was abysmal. After a year and a half cutting my teeth though I was able to land a job as an Associate Editor at a magazine (where I am now) — the pay is respectable and the schedule leaves me time for my own creative endeavors.   As far as improving as a writer, I honestly think it was connecting with the community more than the material on the syllabus that made it for me. We are all a sum of the people we're closest to.

That tells you what people are asking about the topic.  I've done a lot of blogging and content planning for clients, and we work in teams.  So brainstorming is great when you can get a few people in a room with a whiteboard and just come up with things.  How do we tie the topic to what's going on in current events, in entertainment news, to a popular TV show?  How could we make a map or infographic or diagram that entertains and informs?

My own blog, I don't post much too, particularly now that I'm focusing my writing on an ebook.  I mostly wait until I have a good idea that I want to do, and then write it.

What do you think about the Emmys?  What do they mean to you?  Have they changed in your lifetime?  What's Yahoo Answers saying about the Emmys?  If there was an Emmys equivalent in the world of Game of Thrones, what would the categories be and who would win?  That sort of thing.    Ideas are first.  Just put them all done in a spreadsheet.

You could also take a controversial/political/what have you approach and ruffle some feathers based on your beliefs and religious/political orientation.   One main thing I can offer is this: a blog is something that essentially provides a service to others. Many blogs are catered towards a specific group and seek to assist/aid them in some way. For example: I live in DC and follow a blog that writes about every brunch restaurant in the area. I read her reviews and go from there. I am also very anti-feminist (don't judge or ask... lol I don't feel like arguing, just stating an example) I follow another blogger who touts articles that I agree with about feminism. I enjoy reading them because she has a very strong and hilarious viewpoint.   I myself, for example, have a blog. Ive been writing it like a book. Each entry is a chapter, and maybe one day i'll publish it. It's about life experiences and will probably end up being a memoir. I have a list of topics I want to write on, and every week I churn out another chapter.   Anyway, write what you know. Write what you enjoy.

Try not to let yourself go back and revise an unfinished work. When sitting down to write I used to go back over the previous days writing and edit it first; I had to stop doing this for a while.  You should also consider that you may have two distinct voices in your head telling you there's something wrong with your writing: the internal critic, and the internal heckler. You internal critic is the voice that says there is something wrong with your story you need to fix.

I haven't written a novel yet, but theoretically you could do something like this per chapter, just to keep your thoughts in the same basket.

The major factors I notice when this happens:   A writer who is well known for general/literary fiction writes a science fiction book. Think: ""Never Let Me Go"" or ""The Sparrow"". I understand this. Most Ishiguro fans are not going to think to look in science fiction to find his latest novel.  The science fiction elements are light on actual science and more as a device to make the author's point. Think ""Slaughterhouse-Five"". Probably a lot of Murakami's stuff. The publisher simply thinks it would appeal to literary readers more than the readers who generally pursue the science fiction section. This is probably the harsh truth of listening to analytics and statistics to prove a stereotype. I can imagine a meeting in a publishers office where they discuss how to market ""The Book of Strange New things"". ""But Bob, I know its about colonizing an alien world, but its literary. Science fiction readers won't like it."" The book has caught on like wildfire, or maybe is being made into a movie. I noticed that my LBS had recently placed ""The Martian"" in both science fiction and normal fiction. This also happened with ""Wool"" a couple of years ago.  It has become a classic (think books read by high schoolers). Think ""1984"" or ""A Brave New World"". The funny part is, other classics like works by Asimov or ""Dune"" never make the jump."

It just has to demonstrate your thought process, so it doesn't have to be real. You can do spec work for Microsoft if you want and put it in your portfolio. Some people go to ""portfolio school"" to learn about the ad world and build their portfolio. I doubt your friend would want to do that though.   Networking is the most important part.

The pay wasn't amazing at first, but it was enough to support my family and allow my wife to stay at home. But it was definitely tight for a while. I basically just stayed there for long enough to get editing experience, then I used that to get a better job with better pay. I did have to move out of state for that one though, but it's been worth it.  I'd say job security depends on the company you're working for, just like most other jobs. I don't think editing will be something that will be automated anytime soon, so he'd be safe there. Just don't go get a job at a newspaper or another declining field.  My first job was at a for-profit university (didn't love the place, but great people). And now I work mostly in publishing and marketing.  If your friend has been teaching for ten years at the university level, it may be too much of a pay cut to begin entry-level editing now.

In a month, I'll start at another college and, hopefully, in two years I'll have a bachelors degree in mass communication. As I understand it, mass comm has an extremely wide range of job opportunities and possibilities. I've considered editing and copy writing (or a combination) as a career, though I have no idea what I should expect.   As you've already mentioned, journalism and newspapers are indeed on the decline, so I'm extremely wary to go into those fields.

You're just looking for a basic familiarity with the major rules to start.  Newspapers, yeah . . . I wrote for a newspaper as a freelance thing during college. I got paid in NBA tickets haha, so it was a pretty sweet deal. But when they offered me a job after college, I went another direction. I just don't have confidence in the newspaper business model anymore. Mostly only older people read the actual paper, and the newspaper websites are usually not great. I didn't feel comfortable with my future there personally. But I have friends in newspaper and journalism that love it too.  Right now, I work for a company that does lots of different things: books, live events, classroom materials, email marketing . . . all kinds of stuff. So I'm involved in many different areas.  If you want to be an editor, I guess my main advice would be this: Respect the author's voice and the time they put into their writing. Assume they put a great amount of thought into each word they chose in every paragraph. Don't freely rewrite based on what you think sounds better—that's not your job. Nobody likes a heavy-handed editor. :)  Of course, you should strive to improve the writing through suggestions where possible, and you have to catch all the mistakes. Figuring out that line between heavy-handed and too lax is the toughest part of the job. But once you get that, everything is much smoother."

It certainly seems like marketing or business can be a big part -- depending on the specific career, of course. I'm attracted to the aspect of helping with publication of an assortment of materials (like what you mentioned: books, classroom materials, email, etc), just because I've always enjoyed sending information to other people, particularly when they're having trouble finding it.

Tightly researched historical steampunk mysteries and thrillers.  After that I focused on the steampunk, turning to novels.  I'd probably be making a lot more money if I could write romance. That's where the readers are. Romance readers are voracious but relatively unforgiving, so I view it like gold at the bottom of a piranha tank."

I've tried a few times. Theoretically it should be easy, because romance novels tend to stick to a very specific formula - so much so that if you're going to submit work to Mills & Boon, you literally have to follow their formula. I thought I could write anything, but romance just ruined me. My tastes run way too dark and weird, even when I try and rein myself in."
writing,3dxw3x,flipht,3,Mon Jul 20 18:43:14 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting. I'm curious about your experience with the novelettes.  Was it tough to pay for all the book covers? How many novelettes did it take?  Also, I've heard that it really takes more than one book to start gaining traction. Would you write multiple novelettes per genre, or just one?"

If I were you, and unless your contract forbids it, I'd try that while still working my day job to test the water. Best case scenario, you find out you can quit your job earlier than you thought... Worst case scenario you realize it will be difficult to earn a living that way in your field/area or that it won't allow more time to write. Keep in mind most freelancers spend only 1/4 of their time in production. So for 10 billable hours a week you spend 30 hours finding clients, networking, advertising, meeting potential clients who won't call you back, print out estimates and manage your accounts, etc.  It could vary greatly depending on where you live and what you do but if you fall in that category it may be hard to fit writing hours in the middle of this mess for a long time.

writing,3dxw3x,Grrrr13,4,Mon Jul 20 14:38:33 2015 UTC,"Educational publishing can be lucrative if not always steady (if you're a freelancer), and with his background, he'd be suitable for it. Large publishers and development houses hire freelance writers and editors often, and of course there are some permanent staff jobs, those they, like tenure-track positions, are fewer and obviously more competitive. Your friend can also look at higher education publishing, as well, though that's not my area of expertise.   Typically, new writers and editors can make between $25-$40/hour, depending on the product, project, and who is paying the bills (big publishers pay a lot more than smaller development houses). As an adjunct, your friend was probably making between $35-45k a year? That is about what an associate editor or editor 1 starts out at. Good editors who also have project management and people skills can go on to be supervising editors or project managers and can make around $75k/year.  This requires a lot of networking, and it's competitive for desperate people (similar to adjuncting), so you can be easily taken advantage of if you're not careful. However, like I said, it is typically better paying than most entry level copywriting or marketing jobs, and if you can find the right connection, you can work on some cool things. I authored two National Geographic Children's Press books,  and while I only got paid a flat fee (no royalties or anything), seeing my name and picture in a book in a Barnes & Noble has been pretty rewarding. It's not pure creative writing, but it offers opportunities for using a lot of creativity. And I think it can be good work, too, meaning you're doing good in helping children learn.  The major downside is that you'll spend a lot of writing energy and concentration on the work, leaving less for your personal creative writing.

It teaches you nearly every skill needed to be a competent worker (and writer) -- time management, working towards deadlines, multitasking, etc. It's not a popular field right now -- and rightly so, with as much downsizing as the print industry is experiencing -- but it's a good starting job that will benefit you greatly."

You're me a decade back.  If you're losing interest it's probably because the story is collapsing as you write it and the activity unrewarding.   ""Work on your motivation"" is generally bad advice.  I'm very tempted to post a link to my ""Some Writing Advice That’s Mostly Useless (And Why)"" but I've already done that today and somebody will shout at me. Instead, here's the relevant section:   “Work on Your Motivation” — Mostly Useless  Listen. I had a gig writing novels tieing into video games.  Great games. Great gig. But rather than going, “Brilliant, an excuse to play online warrior all day!“, I had a go at them, then handed each off to my son for a thorough exploration (a chore he greatly enjoyed, though being something of a sniper, he got regularly kicked from servers).  I like video games — I’m playing through Mass Effect at the moment — but I like writing better.  See where I’m going with this?  Nobody ever posts online, “How do I motivate myself to complete Halo 3?”  Video games are automatically fun out-of-the-box, because the challenge is the game itself, not the business of getting around inside the virtual world; most games even have similar key bindings (e.g. awsd). So if writing is not as much fun as gaming, then it’s probably because you’re still struggling with the basics of writing rather than wrestling with storytelling.  Therefore  if motivation is a problem for you, work on your craft. Success breeds success.  (Exception: Some professional writing tasks do require self-discipline and motivation. One your novel is done, there’s editing, preparation of submission packages, researching agents and editors, possibly revising on their say so, and so on. These are, however, all problems that are nice to have and not novice ones.)"

writing,3e04rq,ryanaldred,3,Tue Jul 21 01:40:11 2015 UTC,Congrats! I love hearing real life examples.   How much of your editing was because of agent suggestions and how much because of editor suggestions/demands?
writing,3e04rq,screenscope,4,Tue Jul 21 01:48:52 2015 UTC,"Perhaps 25% beta-readers, 25% agent suggestions, and 50% from the editor. I ended up submitting to the same house three times, and each time the editor would send me a laundry list of feedback. The last re-write was massive - but it got me the book deal.  (Note: If ever you get three or four pages of critical feedback from a publisher, DO NOT BE INSULTED. Feedback - however critical it might seem, or difficult it might be to digest in the moment - means that the editor genuinely want to see the project improve. This is a very good thing. Listen closely and, if the feedback rings true, use it to improve your work.)"
writing,3e04rq,screenscope,4,Tue Jul 21 02:02:50 2015 UTC,"I was traditionally published for the first time late last year (by a small publisher). I wrote the first draft of the novel 25 years ago and rewrote it and tried to get a publisher and/or agent every three or four years. I was convinced from the beginning that the book was good enough to be published and indeed would be published. And after all those years it was very well polished and, I believe, deserved to be published.  I don't think there is much use in comparing your work to published books, as they are published and you are not, and they obviously had something that connected to the person (publisher) who bought them and that may or may not have much to do with the plot, or writing standard or any single issue.  Getting your book published traditionally is a long shot, due to the number of manuscripts flying around, but I do believe you can narrow the odds if your book is good enough to be published.  The key is in targeting and finding the publishers and agents who will be interested in your novel. And that's easy on the internet. Just throw in your genres and the word 'publisher' on Google and you will immediately see a list. Study their pages, see what they are looking for and if you are not sure, send them an email. The bigger publishers and agents have specialist staff with their own preferences - look at their bios.  And the world is your oyster. I live in Australia and my publisher is in the UK. This is how I found him.  Still no guarantee of course, but in those early years I wasted a lot of time querying people who were never going to go for my book, but with the internet, you can filter them all out and narrow in on that one person (publisher or agent) who might say yes. Good luck!"

Most people would be horrified to have their first book published once they've kept going in their career. The curse of a first book is that most of the good bits aren't original and the original bits aren't good.  But who knows. You could be a golden child. Send it out, then get working on your next book. If this book takes, it takes. If it doesn't, you're fairly typical. Aim for the moon by all means, but just keep writing. Your ""it"" book is far more likely to be in the future than in the past."

If you feel your first book is so good it's at least as good as 50% of everything that was published this year, you're either correct or you've completely lost your ability to distinguish good from bad. I hope for you it's the former because the latter is liable to be devastating."

Bust most of those are books by celebrities, books by genre authors who pump out 10 books a year (normally with ghostwriters), lackluster efforts be veteran authors, and so on. Lots of others are in specific niches, like certain types of erotica and romance, that sell well no matter what.   My point: a lot of the crappy books put out by traditional publishing are books by people or in niches that are almost guaranteed to sell some copies.   The bar for being in the top 50% for debut authors or general literary fiction is probably higher."

As good as 50% of all books published in a given year still does not seem that great. If I feel my novel is only 50% as good as other books currently being released, it probably needs more work.   My guess is that for a debut/unknown author, a book can't simply be good, it needs to be very good to great. Would you agree?"
writing,3e04rq,cdsk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:00 2015 UTC,"It probably needs to be above average, but it depends on what you mean by debut/unknown. I think it is really really hard for a debut author with no credentials, platform, or name recognition to sell. It's much easier for a debut author who can get blurbs from authors, who publishes fiction and essays regularly, who has a couple thousand Twitter followers, etc. Having a famous agent helps too.   There is so much that's a crapshoot and unpredictable though. You might have a hard time if your book happens to be too similar to a big book that just came out, or you might have a better chance if your book happens to be in a genre that just had a big seller. etc."

Do you have an engaging voice and a plot that carries the reader from the beginning to the end that moves them in some way? Does every single scene carry the plot forward? Is the writing engaging, welcoming and interesting? Are your characters empathetic?   You're not just competing with everyone else's first book, you're competing against everyone's best in a buyer's market. They don't have to pick the best book, they can only pick the books they love. They have to sell it to their bosses who have to sell it to theirs who have to sell it to a marketing department who have to sell it to book buyers. That's an awful lot of love.  I've read one book out of the hundreds I've critiqued in the past two decades where I told someone ""you should go sell this"". If it's not that good, don't beat yourself up. It's your first book.

My question, though, is in regards to your fourth point: are you truly only interested in getting published or are you secretly hoping for wild success and payment for all your hard work?  If you really are my doppelganger than I know you'll be okay with just getting published, regardless of who reads it. Just that smell of a newly bound book, chock full of your own words, ready to paper cut your fingertips is enough to stave off the self-doubt. Given that case, I'd say (from everything I've read), you're more than likely to find a home for your manuscript.  But if you're hoping for more, than I'd say you'll have to keep hoping. Almost every time I see a smash hit novel and think, ""wow, what a debut,"" I find out it's the author's second or third book. Finishing your first book can give you some horrible expectations before the magic fades. I'm still in that disastrously miraculous area! It can feel good, but like a good drink it'll wear off with time and you'll want to write something else.  If you're absolutely happy, and you're not afraid of looking back on it with shame, I'd say push that bastard child out there. Query it to agents, send it to publishers, and if all else fails, self-publish. Just work hard, that's the best advice I've found. The biggest reason I've seen for someone not to get published is they give up when they hit a wall. If you want it, go for it."

What you described definitely isn't bad, i understand what's going on, but I don't see it. I suggest stepping back and really focus on one specific scene. Picture it in your head. Don't write, just imagine what everything looks like, down to the very last detail. Where are the dents on the gates? What color is the garage? Are there skid marks? Is the grass wrecked? Where's the car? Know all of this. Then, just write what you see in your mind. Everything. Describe it all. You'll have all the details down at least. At this point you could go back and make some word changes, get rid of some of the details so it's not drawn out, and basically trim it down to the point that it creates a good picture because you described your mental image as it was but it isn't too lengthy.

If EVERYTHING about a scene is written down, then this piece of advice is tantamount. Cut everything except what is necessary to set the tone of the scene, and leave the rest to the readers' imagination. Leverage the power of the human mind; leave a lot of the heavy lifting to the reader. For all intents and purposes, everyone knows what a garage is (save for the plains hunters in the African savannas who would have no idea). Everyone knows what a garage door is.   Instead, focus on the key details: the damage. This sets a foreboding tone to an otherwise ordinary garage setting. Don't get caught up in the mundane. Focus on what is important."

writing,3e0o3e,A_campbell,5,Tue Jul 21 04:28:45 2015 UTC,"To address your primary question, I would have to be frank and say that being a competent writer is an integral part of crafting a novel. Rather than focusing on getting published, take a step back and work on technique. If you are unable to adequately establish setting, you may want to reconsider what your end-goal is.  Moreover, a suggestion: if you're writing in your second language and it's not shaping up, why not write in your primary one? You should only really be writing in a secondary language if your grasp of such is exceptional and you're a near-native speaker, because otherwise there can be a lot of nuance lost and difficulties transitioning from your primary language to your second one. Just my two cents."

There weren't many people who spoke my language around my area, and my family made me speak english in order to improve it. I'd say I'm fluent in English, but wouldn't say I'm a master either.

Because if I didn't already know, I wouldn't have guessed English is your second language from this comment. It's much better written than the samples you posted.  What you're probably doing is what pretty much every new writer does: imagining a cool story in your head and getting frustrated when you can't immediately write it the way you think it. Fortunately, the solution is simple and unsurprising.  First: your first draft doesn't have to be good. It can be downright awful, actually, and it doesn't matter. Get the story out, start to finish. Then fix it. In revision, you can focus on small pieces of the story at whatever pace suits you.  Second: practice makes perfect. Keep writing and keep reading. That's the only way to ensure you get better. When reading, pay attention to how the story makes you feel and what the author is doing to make that happen. Then copy those ideas (not the words, of course, but the techniques.)  Really, that's it. Eventually, you may want to take some creative writing classes or get into a workshop or other kind of writing group. Those things can be very beneficial, but ultimately it all comes back to reading a lot, writing a lot, and revising a lot."

writing,3e0o3e,ryanaldred,2,Tue Jul 21 03:57:48 2015 UTC,"The temptation for writers is to over-describe, but quantity is no substitute for quality.  Options include using metaphors that will let the reader fill in the details on their own, picking one or two vivid details that will let your reader imagine the rest, or turning it into a bit of a miniature story of its own.   For example: ""The soldiers were lined up like toys in a spoiled child's nursery."" or ""Rows of soldiers stood like armored peacocks.""  or ""Last night taught me one thing: I drove about as well as I f****d when drunk. The garage door opener strained to pull the bent panel into the ceiling while the front gates's automated hinges swung freely, the gates themselves lying crippled on the drive.

Maybe he's nervous, so he cards his hands through his hair as he assesses the damage. The sentences you use to describe this moment could be really short and erratic.   Maybe he's really mad, so he starts kicking the broken gate and door. Or maybe the neighbors are watching him get out of his car and they're silently judging him, so he doesn't even notice much of the damage until he runs inside of the house and looks outside of the front window.  See how all of those scenarios that require description would be much more interested than what you wrote?

writing,3e0o3e,mo-reeseCEO1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:58:23 2015 UTC,"Ok. So I've got some things to say to help you. First, your writing isn't awful, but it could be better. One of the most important things I stress to my students (I teach freshman comp) is to cutback on the bullshit and start writing like you talk. People think that when you put words on paper they have be a certain way: They don't. Use the language that comes naturally to you. If you wouldn't say it out loud, you probably shouldn't type it out.   Just look at your little excerpt about the driveway. The first thing that stick out to me is the awkward construction of the first line: ""My driveway gates and garage door were both damaged, but in different ways."" This isn't a terrible sentence, but it could be improved. You use passive voice, which can make things confusing. I think it's beneficial when you're unsure of the agent of the action, but here it seems to be getting in the way. Furthermore, the sentence is slightly redundant since you describe the damage the sentence after. What do you mean by ""The garage door wouldn't open properly""? Was it stuck? If so, why not say stuck? The next clause is overloaded and not necessarily logical though it does lead to your big reveal. I'd say you're organization and structure might need rethinking too. You may also want to look at some style guides and further familiarize yourself with conventions of English and what makes good prose good.   One thing I recommend is to say exactly what you mean with as few words as possible. If you can write a ten word sentence in five and keep the meaning intact, write it in five.   Aim to be concrete, for one, as a few others have said. You need to be SPECIFIC. Furthermore, always search for ""le mot juste,"" the exact word.   But my number one piece of advice for getting better is to read like a mother fucker. I mean read, read, read. Read Virginia Woolf to see absolute beauty in every sentence. Read Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett to see what the world looks like from the gutter. Read Junot Diaz to see what it's like to be hip. Read Faulkner to see the inside of a person's mind--read, read, fucking read. It will come to you slowly and over time, but when you're done, it will all make sense."
writing,3e0o3e,captainburnz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:15 2015 UTC,"based on your post title, i would say pretty easy. a compelling story is a lot easier to sell the purple prose. this obviously depends on the book you want to write, but simply put--plot sells more than language.  based on your actual post, however, what you're asking is a little trickier. you need an ear for language while keeping your prose simple. the good news is that's true regardless of whether you're a native speaker or not. good writing is not natural. it comes through practice.  for your garage scene, ask yourself a couple of questions:   is it necessary to know the damage to the structures is different? do we need to know how it was damaged, or just that it was damaged? and is the chronology of the damage necessary?   the answer to these questions can be yes or no, but they might help guide you in situations where you wonder if detail is necessary. just something to think on.  and if i were to rewrite it:  The garage was wrecked. Tire marks scarred the lawn where I missed the driveway. The driveway gate lay severed from its hinges in a open question of just how much had I drank before trying to park last night.  i don't vouch for the above to be good, but i think it has a more naturalistic tone, gives the extent of the damage and the detail of drunk without listing details. just something to consider. hope it helps."

Though he does manage to take care of the general conflict all on his own, he winds up on the brink of death and is only saved because of his friends.

Here's a ""silent trailer"" so you can get an understanding of it's atmosphere and overall art style. The movie is actually a sequel to a 24 episode show, which is imperative to have watched in order to understand some of the more grandiose moments that happen in the movie. The show is pretty ""meh"", especially now that I'm older; but it still has moments that should keep you from being turned off completely by it. Overall I'd say the show is probably a 7.5 - 8.0 if you're experience with anime, and a 6.0 or lower if you are not.  Now here's the kicker: To this day, I absolutely believe that the movie is a solid 10/10. I've had friends tell me they did not like the elements of the show at all, and stopped before they reached the movie. When that happens I always explain that the movie should be thought of as the climax to the whole story, the part where everything comes together, especially regarding the main character. And it's also my go-to example for a series that brings out, just, the complete potential of every element it had previously introduced beforehand. I highly recommend that any writer who feels trapped in a basic genre should experience the movie, and the fresh level of storytelling it offers.  If, however, you don't think you are up to it, I offer these two scenes (one,  two) from the movie's climax as a compromise. Obviously you likely will not understand the complete context behind each scene, but I still think you should experience the ambitious presentation that is clearly present behind each one.

If this is you, get off Reddit and read them. Then watch them.  In Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, at the end when Frodo & Sam are inside Mt. Doom, Frodo finally succumbs to the ring's power and refuses to destroy it. The world is saved, however, when Gollum (who succumbed to the ring's power centuries ago) steals the ring and then falls into the volcano during the struggle. Then, Frodo and Sam think they are going to die, but Gandalf shows up to rescue them.  Frodo is saved morally by the evil Gollum, then saved physically by Gandalf, but I don't find it unsatisfying at all, it feels right for the characters and the overall plot. Frodo has already done the impossible by carrying the ring this far and has finally just run out of strength to fight it. Gollum has been trying to take the ring back the whole time, and we are constantly shown how the ring's influence has destroyed his mind; the fact that his obsession with it ultimately destroys his body as well is perfect. Gandalf's appearance doesn't really bail Frodo out, Gollum has already done that. Frodo dying wouldn't have been the end of the world, but failing to destroy the ring would have been.  TL;DR, it all depends on your story. If the MC getting help flows naturally out of the plot and the characters, it's fine. If the MC's help is just thrown in there without good reason, it's bad."

Going more by the movies, than the books, it felt like nearly every time the characters got into a bad situation, someone or something always came around and saved them. Giant eagles, Gandalf etc. Frodo was a nearly useless hero in my opinion. What would have stopped Gandalf from simply taking the ring himself to the volcano? Seemed like he always had the answer and power to solve the problems they faced.  Just seemed like they were getting saved by someone or something else more often than they were getting by on their own."

Personally, I think Frodo's heroic deed was simply carrying the ring. The books go into a lot more detail of just how hard it was to carry this cursed ring without succumbing to its power. That's why Gandalf didn't carry it, wouldn't carry it in fact. Gandalf didn't trust himself to resist that kind of power, but he saw something special in the simplicity of the hobbit way of life that gave Frodo the strength to resist it long enough to get the ring to Mt Doom.  As for the appearance of the eagles at the end, I felt like Gandalf's previous encounter with them was enough to let them show up at the battle of the ages, especially since the eagles considered the sky to be their domain and Sauron's chief servants, the Nazgul, were flying around terrorizing everyone and making things very hard for the good guys."
writing,3e1ucf,sabermonk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:51 2015 UTC,"Hah, and I just learned from the Deus ex Machina wikipedia page that Tolkien himself was a bit concerned about the use of the eagles.   J. R. R. Tolkien coined the term eucatastrophe to refer to a sudden turn of events that ensures the protagonist does not meet some impending fate. He also referred to the Great Eagles that appear in several places in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings as ""a dangerous 'machine'.""[11] Some critics have argued that eucatastrophe, and in particular the eagles, exemplify deus ex machina. For example, they save Frodo and Sam from certain death on Mount Doom in The Return of the King.[12][13] Others contend that the two concepts are not the same, and that eucatastrophe is not merely a convenience, but is an established part of a fictive world in which hope ultimately prevails.[14]   from https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina"

This is a pretty terrible twist. But, if you absolutely want to make that work, you need to be foreshadowing. Maybe the upcoming storm is talked about by the characters throughout the story. Maybe someone mentions the danger of getting struck by lightning. The tightrope you must walk is foreshadowing without telegraphing.

It's still possible to have them rescued, but best to make it feel like it was part of their plan all along (for example, if your thief needs a getaway car after the heist, he should set that up beforehand - don't let the car just show up).  Note that the save doesn't have to be expected: maybe your thief begs his girlfriend to pick him up but she refuses.

Like you might write a book in 2009, and mention Miley Cyrus as an example of a good, wholesome celebrity your socially conservative character approves of. That reference obviously isn't going to work as well today, six years on. Or you could have been writing a book over the last year, where it mentions something about the five members of One Direction. There's not five members any more, so that reference suddenly becomes out of date.  If you're trying to set your book specifically in a certain year, it's a great way to mark your novel and build that time period(even if the time period is only last year), but if you want your novel to be set in a vague five year period, mentioning celebrities can ruin it."

I will say that dialogue is not your only problem in this story, but since that's what you asked about that's what I'll focus on.  The reason that the dialogue feels awkward is that it really doesn't feel like anything that anyone would say. I know that sounds like a trite, canned response, but hear me out. Take this line of dialogue:  "" “Life is not a game,” Leah managed. “People are not just pawns to be used for your twisted enjoyment.”""  That's really not something that someone would ever say outside of a bad thriller. Say the words out loud. Roll them around in your mouth. Can you really imagine being in this kind of situation - imagine yourself in Leah's shoes - and finding the brainpower to link together those words in that order? It feels too consciously written, like the author is going, ""Here you go! Leah's Moral for the Story!""  A good technique if you want to improve your dialogue writing is to actually record what people (or you) say and type it out, line for line. It'll give you a feel of the cadences of everyday speech. Written words have a different rhythm and feel. They're more geared towards thinking patterns, as opposed to speech, which is geared to be understood on the fly by another person. Once you learn the cadences and quirks of speech then dialogue should flow more naturally. Many of the best dialogue authors can make you have a feel for the character simply by the way that they string words together. Think Stephen King, or Alice Munro, to quote two extremely different examples.  One last tip: When you say things like ""Leah managed"" or ""he said in a familiar voice"", you're telegraphing too much to the reader, and not leaving enough up to interpretation. Just say the word ""said"" with no adverb or descriptor and let the prose speak for itself. Well written dialogue should never need to be outwardly described."
writing,3e106v,hatredpants,3,Tue Jul 21 03:30:15 2015 UTC,"This is good advice.  The dialogue lacks a fluidity, and doesn't feel authentic. As mentioned above, dialogue alone should give the reader a feel for the character, in essence who are they -- dialogue is not a narrator. It is not somebody tugging the story along with a similar voice and style. Dialogue is unique to the individual character, to the situation they've been placed in. Get inside your characters heads. What does LEAH say? Is she addressing a feeling, a piece of information? What's the context? It's not about what you feel, and hardly what you'd imagine she says... Let her (Leah) tell you. I don't know if that sounds crazy, but I writing is crazy so you'll figure it out.  Also, read your dialogue aloud. Does it flow and move you in some way? Can you imagine the conversation occurring inside that room?  Sorry if I'm at all harsh. I hope this helps.  Check out: Elmore Leonard"

Opts for words with less syllables. They don't make statements unless they're giving a speech; the usual format is a judgment, orientated on subject (self) or object (others). Usually takes the shortest way to get their point out. Uses body to express emotions. And usually leave things out, expecting others to understand the context.  Of course, that's all character and situation dependent.  Example:  Two boys lost in the woods: (x) ""Shh... There's a bear by that brush.""

Manuscripts are unwieldy, but the real reason for that time ratio is that most of them are a fast reject. Herewith, the rough breakdown of manuscript characteristics, from most to least obvious rejections:  Author is functionally illiterate.  Author has submitted some variety of literature we don’t publish: poetry, religious revelation, political rant, illustrated fanfic, etc.  Author has a serious neurochemical disorder, puts all important words into capital letters, and would type out to the margins if MSWord would let him.  Author is on bad terms with the Muse of Language. Parts of speech are not what they should be. Confusion-of-motion problems inadvertently generate hideous images. Words are supplanted by their similar-sounding cousins: towed the line, deep-seeded, dire straights, nearly penultimate, incentiary, reeking havoc, hare’s breath escape, plaintiff melody, viscous/vicious, causal/casual, clamoured to her feet, a shutter went through her body, his body went ridged, empirical storm troopers, ex-patriot Englishmen, et cetera.  Author can write basic sentences, but not string them together in any way that adds up to paragraphs.  Author has a moderate neurochemical disorder and can’t tell when he or she has changed the subject. This greatly facilitates composition, but is hard on comprehension.  Author can write passable paragraphs, and has a sufficiently functional plot that readers would notice if you shuffled the chapters into a different order. However, the story and the manner of its telling are alike hackneyed, dull, and pointless.  (At this point, you have eliminated 60-75% of your submissions. Almost all the reading-and-thinking time will be spent on the remaining fraction.)  It’s nice that the author is working on his/her problems, but the process would be better served by seeing a shrink than by writing novels.  Nobody but the author is ever going to care about this dull, flaccid, underperforming book.  The book has an engaging plot. Trouble is, it’s not the author’s, and everybody’s already seen that movie/read that book/collected that comic.  (You have now eliminated 95-99% of the submissions.)  Someone could publish this book, but we don’t see why it should be us.  Author is talented, but has written the wrong book.  It’s a good book, but the house isn’t going to get behind it, so if you buy it, it’ll just get lost in the shuffle.  Buy this book.  Aspiring writers are forever asking what the odds are that they’ll wind up in category #14. That’s the wrong question. If you’ve written a book that surprises, amuses, and delights the readers, and gives them a strong incentive to read all the pages in order, your chances are very good indeed. If not, your chances are poor.    That's as good as I can do for numbers.    -Is there value in sticking by a book (with, of course, constant editing to reflect any suggestions) if it is rejected multiple times over a period of... X months? Rather, what is the point at which it is more likely that you'll be successful writing an entirely new book and trying to publish it, rather than continue to pitch the one you've been working with?   You should always be writing a new book while you've got one on submission. You can take a week off to research agents and write query letters, you can take a couple weeks off to do edits, but as soon as you have query letters in inboxes, your priority should be the next book.   For every book I've written, up till the one that got me my agent, I sent out queries for a couple of months and then, after a couple of months, I reread my manuscript and thought ""Yeah -- this is not the book that gets me an agent."" In retrospect I probably gave up too soon, but I didn't yet have the knowledge to edit them to greatness.   I think if you've got a book that gets more than 20ish rejections, you either have a book problem, a query letter problem, an agent searching problem, or your book is so brilliantly weird that nobody can figure out how to sell it. But if you get to that point and you still passionately believe that you've got a fantastic book?

writing,3e0kbj,ryanaldred,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:50:58 2015 UTC,"How many/what portion of books are rejected purely on mechanical basis?   This happens all the time. If you think it might apply to you, either ask your beta-readers or hire a ruthless copy editor to look at a small section of your manuscript.   How many are rejected based on flaws in the author's story?   This also happens all the time. This can be evaluated, again, either via your beta readers or hiring a professional editor for a 'quick assessment'. It's not unheard of for those to run $300 - $500.   Same question but rejected based on saturation/lack of identity.   If you have truly addressed the problems in question #2, this is unlikely to be a major issue.   Rejected based on the story itself, or the reviewer's opinion.    This will happen a LOT. Editors and agents can afford to be choosy, and to pick only those works that resonate with them personally. This is why it's important to query broadly, so you aren't rejected for purely subjective reasons.   Is there value in sticking by a book (with, of course, constant editing to reflect any suggestions) if it is rejected multiple times over a period of... X months? Rather, what is the point at which it is more likely that you'll be successful writing an entirely new book and trying to publish it, rather than continue to pitch the one you've been working with?   This is the big question, and it depends on you as a writer. Do you still absolutely love your premise? Do your beta-readers love your premise? Does your story explore an issue in a new and exciting way? Are you unable to churn out several books a year? Then you should perhaps consider sticking with your original work.  Have you grown beyond your initial premise? Have you come to find your storyline hacknied and unbelievable? Do you have a bunch of other ideas that you would much, much rather explore? Are you able to write books quickly? Then you might want to just move on to a new project.  Personally, I re-wrote my first book until it was publishable. But I really liked the premise, and it was my telling of it that was dragging the story down. Others have done the opposite with great success."

If it has reached publication, it should have gone through the steps needed to get rid of these.  If it's about a historical era I am familiar with, and has glaring factual errors (I'll forgive little or obscure errors), I will similarly be unimpressed. Writers in the historical fiction genre have a duty to do their research. If they've done it so poorly that I can spot the errors (again, if it's something I have specialist knowledge about that is obscure and requires getting books only available in legal deposit libraries, I'll be forgiving) then they've clearly not done enough research.  A movie example would be 300: Rise of an Empire. Herodotus isn't exactly an obscure source, and it's very easy to get hold of an English translation. Hell, I own three! Plus there's Wikipedia. So giving the Athenians 6 ships at Salamis, and no allies until the Spartans turn up with Cersei on board, that's a grave error. There were 180 Athenian ships and allies from a dozen city-states with between 1 and 40 ships apiece. Also having the Spartans save the day, when it was a Corinthian manouver than won the day, that's bullshit. I hate that movie. I mean, it's not like they got bored of animating ships after 100 and figured ""lots of ships"" was close enough. 6. Instead of 180. That's a big difference. We get that the Greeks were underdogs, you don't need to labour the point to make it look stupid. I mean, you can show ""lots of Greek ships"" vs ""even more lots of Persian ships"" without making it be 6 vs however many."

writing,3dz7c0,tophusurvivor,0,Tue Jul 21 02:45:09 2015 UTC,"I've had this argument before so I'm not gonna go into it too deep, but it's about the difference between believability and realism. A fantasised historical fiction movie has certain elements of leeway. Making the antagonist giant, for example, is fine; there's metaphor in there and it looks cool. Throwing in interesting characters or exaggerating the role of an interesting character (Artemesia, for example) is again fine. But changing the plot completely because you've got a boner for Sparta is too big a departure.  If they'd thought ""eh, 100 ships, that'll do, nobody's going to count them"" that might have been fine. Even if they'd tacked Sparta on with the Corinthian manouver because Sparta's got to be significant in this movie, fine. But it simply wasn't six ships against a huge fleet, who attacked anyway, and who were saved by late-coming Spartans. It wasn't. It was two fleets, each made up of people from different city-states, one somewhat larger than the other, facing off across the strait of Salamis. Corinth's 40 ships sailed off, seemingly fleeing. The Persian fleet attacked, ignoring the Corinthians because they thought they were fleeing, and then the Corinthians turns around and rammed into the side of the Persian ships and sank a bunch, giving the Greek side an early advantage that eventually led to their victory. There was no suicide mission of the last of the Athenians standing alone and friendless. There was an alliance of numerous Greek city-states who had each sent as many ships as they could in defence of their freedom. The movie could have had a message of allies standing together against a larger foe, a good theme that's true to the source material. Instead it decided ""Sparta good! Sparta strong! Must have Sparta save everyone!"" and made Athens look artificially weak. It reminds me of what America thinks WWII was like."

My first attempt did yield a lot of ""Pay us a $1,000"" and we will edit it for you and get it published.  That is money I don't have. Nor will I in the near future. Now I am seeing I may not have to.  But as a self publish I also do not have people that can proof read for me, so again I would have to pay someone.  I will admit, due to past education my grammar and spelling is not up to par, but I am trying.  And because I don't have perfect grammar or spelling doesn't mean my story is a bad one.  So I think I tend to be more easy on them, because I read so much, I don't check to see if they have a publisher or went through and editing process.  But I do agree with you, about factual errors. One of the books I read information about Serial Killers and the like. Every person he profiled was grossly inaccurate in some of his information.  Half of it sounded like he made it up.

But two in close proximity starts to suggest a trend. And then I'm in job mode instead of reading mode, and it stops being fun.  The point isn't necessarily about money. Sure, it's a far quicker and more reliable route to get a book proofread. But if you can't afford it, well you just have to work harder on it. Don't you want your book to be as good as it possibly can be? If so, why publish it when it could still have errors in?  There are ways to get others to proofread your work without shelling out cash. Offer a swap to other writers: beta read for others and ask them to proofread your book. If you know someone local who could do it, offer to do yard work or repaint their kitchen or whatever. Post it on critique circle sites. Or you could shell out a smaller amount of cash to get the first chapter proofread, and ask the proofreader to explain every new change they make so that you can go through and attempt to duplicate that across the rest of the novel.  The thing is, it's indistinguishable to me, the reader, if someone has published a book full of grammatical errors, whether they're a lazy writer who thinks self-publishing books as quickly as possible is the way to fame and money, or a conciencious writer with a blind spot with grammar and spelling who has tried really hard to make their manuscript perfect but who has missed a bunch of things in spite of their efforts.

When he curse, he's going to lose an unknown percentage of his listeners. For him, that loss is not enough to justify using profanity. I thought that was a very wise and intelligent answer.  That said, I think that in prose fiction, one must use profanity if a character curses. That's just how it is. Some people use a lot of profanity. However, the narrative voice doesn't have to curse.

I think it's probably better to approach Wattpad and other free-to-post sites with the understanding that that's just for fun and to see whether anyone bites. Keeping your better work under your hat to sell elsewhere is a surer way of making money - at least you know that if you get accepted you'll get the money rather than gambling on someone sifting through all the crud on the site to find the one or two gems that will make them money. It has happened - I've spoken to someone to whom it happened, and I don't want to belittle their success at all, because it's hard to do - but it's not a sure-fire way of making money and it's a blooming waste of first rights if it doesn't take off. Meanwhile, you've earned nothing.  I'd say that the people who have made it big on those platforms probably went into it as hobbyists not expecting to strike paydirt, like E L James and her Twilight fanfic. They built the audience because they happened to be good at what they do, possibly didn't intend to take it much further, and had a natural talent if not for writing then for knowing what people wanted to read. First rights become irrelevant because the writing is so damn good/addictive/popular the publishers don't care. However, a writer like the OP, who is wanting to submit somewhere which will get them paid, shouldn't bother with a free, amateur site; they should go in the professional direction which means being conservative about what they put up and where.  Pointing to the people who did make a splash on a free site is like pointing to J K Rowling and saying all authors are billionaires. They're not; some people are just in the right place at the right time.

But while earnings through donations are possible, they shouldn't be expected. It CAN happen, but there's no guarantee. For anyone who does have an audience and a following already, books are the way to go for money.  As for a Patreon success story, look at Wildbow's page: https://www.patreon.com/Wildbow?ty=h That's an exceptional success story, though. I often see authors who start publishing web fiction thinking they can fund their writing with Patreon, and they usually end up earning under 20$ a month (or nothing)."

After creating an account you can add a work you are looking to shop out (just the name, genre, word count -- not the full text), and do a search for markets that accept that type of story.  Pro markets would be the best possible place to have your story accepted--this would be well-known short story publishers like TOR and Asimov's; 5-6 cents per word. If I'm feeling optimistic I'll send my story there first. Next down are semi pro markets (~1 cent a word), and after are some others which give only token payments and some which pay nothing. It's up to you what market you want to shoot for.  If you open the page for one of the markets (let's say Asimov's) you'll receive a lot more information how to actually submit a story as well as submission guidelines. The whole thing is powered by users logging their submissions, and then coming back and logging whether or not their story was accepted and how long it took to get a response back. Using that information the site provides some very helpful graphs detailing how often stories are getting accepted and how long they stay out.  Best of luck!"

It came to pass that this would be a momentous day for the wizarding world, as in the same instant the Dark Lord turned towards him - wand raised to cut his life short - Bob had already lifted the hammer of his .357 and brought it down with the metaphorical something alluding to the Roman god Vulcan hitting an anvil made of volcano that exploded. Sweet supersonic freedom liberated a path through that noseless man-fucker showering the Great State of Texas with the AIDS infected gray-matter of the Dark Lord.

I know that is broad and seems like low hanging fruit. But really, how can the fiction writers of the internet age not produce a different quality than their predecessors that relied on a few or no sources.

writing,3e0h5d,RandomRhino,8,Tue Jul 21 00:32:19 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with basing qualities of a character on someone you know.  After all, that's the only real knowledge we have as far as what ""people"" are, ourselves and others we've met in life.  However, I'd avoid creating a character based entirely on one person, unless it's important to the character somehow and personal for you.  For instance, if I were writing a story in which the protagonist had an awful stepparent, I might be writing such a thing because it's personal to me, and I'm using the qualities of a real stepparent in order to ""write what I know"".  I think that's acceptable and helpful.  But if you plan on writing more than one book, or books with different characters, I'd get used to the process of coming up with your own characters to avoid writing the same ones again and again with different names.    It's really not too difficult.  Have fun with it.  Creating a fictional character is sorta like creating Frankenstein's monster.  Take pieces of your real life experience as a human being and paste them here and there, and borrow some pieces from people you know or possibly even characters you're familiar with and love and use them here and there, tweaking them enough to have something organic of your own.  You should also be aware that it's going to be tough coming up with a wholly ""original"" character.  After all, as humans we share qualities which can be pretty close to universal, and we all feel a lot of the same things, etc.  Even as real life people, or real life characters, we are not wholly original or special or unique.  That's why, even the worst villain in a story, if properly fleshed out and given human traits rather than simply being made a psychopath, can be empathized with or relatable to readers.  So don't worry too much about this idea of coming up with something ""original.""  Just focus on creating something human.    As a writer, you're allowed and perfectly capable of being creative, so come up with some traits on your own, and use tidbits of information or characteristics from real life knowledge as well to ground it.  I think you'd have a rather hard time writing much of anything that somehow doesn't come from your own experiences and perspectives.    Hope this helps somehow."

Let's make a list of 16 jobs from lawyer to farmer to bricklayer, brain surgeon, pianist.  Go wild with the list.  Then add more traits, hair color, eye color, hobbies, etc.  eventually you'll have a list of traits that make for a new person, especially since they're not always things you'd connect, like having a big burly construction worker who loves ballet and listens to Edm."

The only thing that really changes in the environment, and what they have to and can do, and perhaps a little less fart jokes and all. Though that too is very different for each person. Just like every teenager is different, so is every adult. And just like teenagers often have struggles in common - for instance finding their place in the world, who they are, and looking at their future - so do adults have struggles in common. They're in a similar environment and in a similar part of their life, often.  Anyway, my point is pretty much the same as the general writing female characters one - just write a human. Adults have as many flaws and struggles as everyone else, only they often don't show them, I think. The biggest difference here is life experience and responsibility (mostly for yourself, i.e. income, future etc.). Primarily write a human, and then maybe ask yourself if someone with a whole lot of life experience might think or act differently.

You probably won't be able to write ""believable"" ""adult"" characters in an artificial method, and honestly, you probably don't want to. I'm 23, and I have just as many crazy habits and personality quirks as I did when I was 16. Sure, I'm a different person, but that isn't implicitly because I'm older or more adult.  There are just as many 30 or 40 year old people in the world that act like 6 year olds as there are teenagers that behave like the traditional adult. Write characters that fit your ideas and story, change and develop them in and of themselves as you write and edit, but don't worry if you don't feel like you have the proper perspective. You don't have to have direct experience with your subject matter unless you're writing an encyclopedia.

You should do that with any character, regardless of age, but adults will have more of it to draw from and will have changed in different ways over time. That's it.  There's no big secret.

Now I plan for months, years, and decades down the line on a regular basis. I still sweat what's going to happen in a few days, but I've also got long term problems to consider on top of my regular stresses.   I don't worry about who like-likes who, or if I'll be able to hold onto money to buy something new and fashionable, like a new phone or shoes, or whatever's trending. None of that shit matters anymore, and nobody really cares how I dress or what car I drive. The number of people who give a shit about me is very very small, and mostly all of them are related to me by blood. The number of people I care deeply about I could gather into a small room.   There are so many small things that just don't bother me anymore. I was a pretty zealously religious teenager. I think maybe because I didn't have any major concerns or social pressures to not be. I was a lot more closed minded, because that's how I was raised. But, like all adults, I experienced more. I saw more people, I started getting to know more people, and eventually I grew out of old intolerance. I like coffee now. And a lot of other foods I couldn't palette as a teenager. I'm bigger, stronger, and a lot more confident than I was. I think, generally, I'm a lot nicer as well. I saw that a lot of people deal with the same stuff I do, and we're all, deep down, mostly the same. So I became a lot more empathetic towards those around me, and generally just wanted social situations to go smoothly for everyone.

Maybe I'm not speaking for all adults, but a large part of my life is spent acting like I know what I'm doing and wondering when people are going to stop falling for it.  Have you ever been in a situation where people thought you were an adult, or at least older than you are, and — whether you acted on it or not — you felt a certain freedom to take advantage of the misunderstanding? That's what adulthood feels like."
writing,3dwzhj,bambam2010,2,Mon Jul 20 08:25:43 2015 UTC,"I had that problem - in my case it was working out what people actually did all day at work. Research and asking around and getting people to show you what the world is like is an idea...that said, me and my partner (aged 35 and 40) are just overgrown teenagers; life changes outwardly - there are more responsibilities, things to organise on your own etc - but once you are an adult you don't see the world radically differently to when you're a teenager. I do, however, now have trouble putting myself into the body of an eight-year-old girl: I'm writing a couple of stories with characters based on the protagonist of Alice in Wonderland, but set in my own world where magic mixes with that sort of mid- to late-Victorian society and the 'Alice' character doesn't have to enter the dream-world to interact with magic and supernatural weirdness.  However, it's hard to judge whether what you're writing involving characters that you feel are different to you are hitting the right notes or not. The best bet is to show your work to someone and say 'is this character realistic?' - and then take their suggestions on board."

Youre comfortable with yourself and don't really care about what other people might think. Compare this  to teenagers who are still discovering themselves and trying to establish their own identity and might experiment with different styles and hair colours and take feedback from their peer group a lot more seriously. Teenagers are constantly changing and learning and discovering new things and exploring, adults have already found their likes and dislikes and kinda stick to them. When you're a teen you're constantly meeting new people and !making new friends, but when you're an adult its harder - everyone has their own friend groups already that they've had for many many years and it's really hard to enter these already established groups. When you're younger you make time to socialize and interact with new people (huge parties, clubs, teams, social nights), when you're older you stick to socializing with the people you already know (small parties with close friends, family gatherings)."

writing,3dwzhj,PCBlue22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:18:27 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts:  None of the problems you have as a teenager really goes away when you grow up, you just learn to deal with it better. Adults are people too. They just have work instead of school, and spend their time doing something they (hopefully) know well and enjoy doing (to some extent). They think things ahead further.  I think the biggest element of my own personality that's changed since my teenage years is that I don't care as much about how I'm perceived by others anymore. I can talk about what's important to me, I can dress and behave however I want (which might be an issue if I wasn't a calm and mellow person), do whatever I want and think I can handle the consequences of; all of this more confidently and freely than I would have ever dared as a teenager.  I've also noticed that my roles have evened out. My home persona isn't that different from my work persona. I've seen the same in my friends. A friend of mine is a father, but come game night and he's not that different from what he was at age 15. As a young parent, he was a lot more concerned with being a father. Today, he's a lot more himself, both as a parent and as a friend of mine, and I assume the same applies to who he is at work.  Write this adult as a responsible teenager, someone who's more aware of his inclinations and weaknesses who manages to avoid the self-centered emotional teenage drama that it seems all teenagers go through some variation of. Don't make him perfect, adults make mistakes too, but they tend to make different mistakes, and handle them differently. When a teenager goes to a party instead of doing his homework, he comes to school without his homework done. When an adult does the same, he goes to work without having slept instead. The party was the mistake. But it was handled differently.  Another thing to consider is that teenagers tend to be focused on one thing at a time. Adults have to balance so many more elements of their life, things they're responsible for, so they're stuck looking at things from different angles. As an employee working 9-5, how late can I be out drinking? As a married man, can I afford this car or this car? As someone who's been in an accident, is climbing the shelves instead of getting a ladder a good idea? As a biology major, should I name my kid Steve or Stephen? Teenagers, meanwhile, don't necessarily have the same ability to look at things from different angles, and therefor can get more preoccupied with a single perspective, a single focus. Maybe that's why they tunnel so hard on certain interests (games, people, whatever). Adults can't afford the same focus. Hormones certainly help steer teenage focus.  On that note, experience with your own emotions is another thing adults have that teenagers don't have as much of. Once you've loved and lost, and lost loved ones, your emotional life isn't the same as it was before. That's not to say adults can't be overwhelmed by emotion. But it's not as common, and they're more aware of how and when it happens, than teenagers.  Thinking about the teenagers I deal with, there's all kinds of them, but the thing they have in common is the lack of experience. Some of them are easier to relate to than some people my age. Some of them are more responsible than some people my age. But they still aren't as knowledgable. And they have some preconceived notions of the world and how it, and people in it, work; things that don't come from experience but from observation. Work and relationships, for example, are things that happen automatically at some age. Well, I'm past that age, and they certainly didn't happen automatically.  The general idea is that adults are teenagers, but with more knowledge, more experience, and more of themselves. That's not to say all adults are this way, that they're all the same, or that teenagers can't be this way too compared to their peers. It's a generalization. But it's a useful one."
writing,3dwzhj,Sleeparchive,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:39:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Show your work to an adult. Ask them questions, ask several questions of several adults.  Part of writing is research. Most of it is writing, but you want to know about what you're writing. Talking to people from a different walk of life or a different stage of it that you're trying to capture just helps. It'll give you an insight if you can ask them about what it is like to react to certain things, to worry about certain things, to work in a job like whatever you're writing about.   Give it time and do the research, you'll do fine as long as you learn and keep working. Always remember that if you finish what you're working on you've accomplished more than many amateur writers ever will, and that even if it doesn't go perfectly you can glean a lot of experience from it all."

Chances are, you've seen plenty of adult behavior on TV, in movies, in books, in video games, and so on and so forth. Oh, and real life too, but in fiction, people are generally portrayed as an ideal of some sort. Unless you're reading someone like Steinbeck where people are just simple people — not picking on Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath just came to mind, a book I enjoyed in school.  I'm an adult (I'm 35) and a lot of the time, I act like a big kid. Adulthood as this great world-changing event like puberty that is tied to a few years and turns your life around is optional. I mean, if you go into the military or college or some big important career, that's one thing, and that might be hard to write without experience. A lot of us just go to work and do what we can.

We still fuck around, feel sad, happy, angry, frustrated etc. We still are subject to the same petty jealousies, the same rivalries, the same desires and fears.  The primary difference is that most adults will be dealing with a great deal more responsibility, which pushes some of things we took for granted as teenagers in to the background. We may not be able to go out for a beer because we've got an early meeting tomorrow (and hangovers get harder to deal with as you get older), or because we can't get a babysitter for the kid.  Adults may be better at dealing with problems in a more rational fashion than many teenagers, but that's not always going to hold true.  From my own experience (I'm 28, with a three year old), I still enjoy the same things - hanging out with friends, music, video games etc., but above all I have a responsibility to my family. If that means that I can't afford to go to the pub on a Friday evening, that's the sacrifice I have to make.  Other than that, we're all the same.

I can goof around whenever I want, because I don't have exhausted authority figures trying to stop me because I'm annoying them.  I'm not afraid of authority figures like parents because I'm in the world on my own.  I can't be tricked into behaving.  On the other hand, the cold, neutral nature of the world has clearly caught up to me, teaching me hard lessons of responsibility and how important it is to stand up for myself and take care of the people I care about.  The bills don't stop if you want the Car & Home lifestyle.  I still have no idea what I'm doing.  I don't think anybody does until they try something and it works.

In the eyes of the law, adults have far more to worry regarding playing pranks and such that teenagers wouldn't bat an eye at. I'm being very general, but your typical responsible adult has to worry about their job, money, relationships and their families. As for personalities, adults can be just as childish and goofy as any teenager, and relationships and dating never really gets more mature."

My best male friend is 33, and we're very similar personality wise. My best female friend (obligatory: besides the wife) is turning 40, and we've known her and were great friends immediately after we met 5 or 6 years ago.  The main difference is that at 18 I was scared shitless that I didn't know what I was doing and that someone would figure out I'm a complete fraud. Now I'm encroaching on 28 and I don't know what I'm doing, I just really don't care.  The once caveat I'll add, and I generally extend this to anyone, is to not write about parents (especially those of young children) because the motivation behind what they do is quite unfathomable until you're in the situation.  Empathy and sympathy will get you a long way. Work hard, because writing isn't an overnight skill to learn.

writing,3dwzhj,lungsmearedslides,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:06:04 2015 UTC,"Much of it comes down to novelty and comparison with prior experiences.  It is a bit tricky to articulate but it may be worthwhile looking at Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.  It's got holes in it large enough to drive a truck through, but it's a decent starting point.  Much of the difference between teenagers and adults is that they have different levels of needs.  Most teenagers never drop below level 3, the Love/belonging level.  They just plain never have to worry about having a safe place to sleep, or where the next meal is coming from.  By and large in developed nations previous generations took care of that, they built us houses and planted crops and raised livestock and drove away the predators.   Obviously not all kids are like that, but for the average kid it's pretty close.  Quite often when a teenager first moves out on their own, they get hit in the face by ""real life"" and have to start worrying about level 2 or even level 1 needs.  Maybe it's just stuff like loading your stuff into a U-Haul truck, driving to a different city and then when you get there realize you actually have no idea how to find a place to live.  Another very common one is income.  Plenty of kids these days have never had to honestly sit down and count their beans, because if their pocket was empty they could just tell a parent or relative what they want and money was magically produced.  My sister just turned 18, did the whole ""strong independent woman"" thing and moved out.  Then when she ran out of money two months later moved back in.  She's only just now starting to understand that money is a consumable, and that if you spend money on one thing you no longer have that money to spend on another.  Here's the kicker, the real secret.  Most people, if they can fathom it at all, think that in one way or another if they drop down to the level below them they will die.  This is why subjectively a 17 year old who gets dumped right before prom quite often reacts much the same way as a 57 year old who is suddenly fired and loses his RRSP and investments, and with no savings and no income faces imminent homelessness.  Even though objectively we can look at it and see that the older man is in a much worse position, the teenager acts as though his own problem is just as important.  This is because for the teenager love/belonging is the baseline of survival, they've never had to deal with anything more threatening than that.  One thing that ties into this is the theory of our ""three minds"", our Lizard on the bottom dealing with very basic survival stuff like food and shelter, our Monkey dealing with social concerns(love and belonging), and our Human mind that deals with enlightenment and progress and all that stuff.  Most people these days spend almost all their time in the Monkey brain.  For them social acceptance is a matter of life and death.  This is why people do stuff like stab their ex 36 times with a steak knife for leaving them to be with someone else, because to the Monkey rejection is death.  Hopefully that made some sense.  Sometimes it's a bit difficult to explain all this stuff without re-writing ConCom by Rory Miller."

writing,3dwzhj,Vaynonym,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"A major thing that changes is simple perspective. As a teen, a breakup can be world shattering because it is quite possibly the worst emotional trauma a mind has experienced up to that point. An adult on the other hand, has probably experienced multiple emotional crushing events, so they have learned that there are worse things than a breakup, even though breakups still really really hurt.   Take for example, a marine who's returned from Afghanistan has killed multiple people and watched some of his best friends die. This marine may care about his sixteen year old son very much, but it is going to be very very difficult for the marine to completely grasp the gravity of his son's breakup, at least from the son's perspective. Very often in life, this creates a rift and strain in their relationship. Neither is wrong, but the two perspectives are just magnitudes of different that neither can relate to.  So again, I would say that the adult won't necessarily be wiser, but chances are really good that there will be a gap in understanding between the teen and adult. The teen will see something as a really big deal, and the adult will say something along the lines of ""there's more to life than this one thing you find so important"". Both are right from their perspectives. Both are usually pretty stubborn."

writing,3dz4r3,ionised,4,Mon Jul 20 22:27:35 2015 UTC,"I have a few critique partners that started out as novel exchanges. We were complete strangers at the start, but apparently liked each other enough at the end to stay committed through other writing journeys. I've also trialed about a dozen people who just didn't work out for one reason or another.  I like exchanging with writers because they understand craft. They can deconstruct why something is or isn't working. They can read my work at a reader level, but also look at it structurally and thematically. I can tell them what scenes aren't sitting well with me, and they will tell me why. I can email them to brainstorm solutions. I can pester them with questions. They'll re-read a chapter multiple times as I rework it until it's on the right track. It's really great. Having a few trusted sets of eyes on my work is invaluable. They catch everything that slips past my radar.   In return, I offer my critique partners everything that I'm asking for. I enjoy editing and helping other writers, and will go above and beyond for a partner who's willing to put in the work. It's a rewarding and humbling thing, watching someone you're invested in grow as a writer, and allowing yourself to be vulnerable enough for them to help you grow, too.   Distilled from personal experience, my advice would be as follows:   You are responsible for soliciting the critique you want to receive. I don't say that to be threatening, but because it's a truth I've come to accept. You are responsible for quality control in partners. You are responsible for setting and adhering to deadlines. You are responsible for telling partners what kind of critique you need, and in what level of detail. If your partner started out giving you detailed feedback and is now leaving lazy comments, restate your expectations. If they're giving you an amount of praise or criticism that's not helping you grow, tell them what ratio of positive/negative feedback you want to receive. If you're not getting the feedback you need, think about ways you can ask for it.  Give another writer exactly what you are expecting to get from them, if not more. You will likely have to put in a lot of work in order to get quality feedback. If you want line-by-line feedback, be willing to do the same. If you want detailed essays on character development, write the same for your partner. If you want a sounding board for ideas, make yourself available to brainstorm for the other person. The more you give, the more you'll get. A solid critique partner is worth their weight in gold; do the proper legwork and you may be able to keep them for years to come. Don't just send your work out to people. Interview them first. I've found through experience that discussing your genre, feedback style, what you're looking for, what your timeline is, etc. up front prevents potholes further down the road. After I interview people, we usually do trial critiques for the first few chapters to see if we want to stick it out. A novel is a long time to work with a person or project you don't mesh with. It can take a lot of time to find that perfect match. Be patient. Don't settle. You are free to walk away at any time. If the critique partner is needlessly harsh or condescends to you, shake hands and walk away. If the critique partner disrespects you or your work, shake hands and walk away. If they aren't giving you feedback that is helping you improve, shake hands and walk away. Your time is valuable. NDA: I've never made anyone sign anything, as I don't think my ideas are unique enough to warrant that. I do make it clear from the start that the partnership ends if the reviewer shares my work without my explicit permission. It's never been a problem. Friends vs. strangers: I prefer strangers because I'm not as emotionally invested. I can more easily separate my feelings from my work, and separate my work from my self-worth. A stranger isn't going to butter me up. For these reasons, I have always gotten better feedback from strangers. That said, some of these strangers have gone on to become friends, so there you go.    do all beta-readers (if, say I went with strangers) expect to read and give a candid review w/o any compensation?   I wouldn't do the work for ""free,"" as that's a lot of time and effort on my part. I would only do this for an established partner I'm invested in if he/she has a novel completed and I don't, in which case the expectation would be quid pro quo. For a stranger, I would expect them to critique my novel as I critique theirs.  That was quite a ramble. Hope it helped. Best luck, and feel free to ask questions."

That said, someone just posted this two-part article about how to game Amazon by plagiarizing, so it's probably good to have some level of trust, and not just post freely to any ol' writing forum.  Regarding friends/family: I've done two rounds of betas on my main WIP so far.  I used mostly writers for the first round, and added some non-writing friends for the second round.  What kind of feedback you're looking for will determine what kind of readers you want.  Since this is a later draft, you can probably use a mix of both writers/non-writers - they'll be able to point out different kinds of features/flaws."

The market is heavily concentrated with the top 0.01% doing exponentially better than the 1%.  I wouldn't judge any book on just one market on one platform though. Sales in the USA might be higher as might Canada or Australia, or perhaps this doesn't do well in eBook but sells better in print or audio, or it might be that it used to sell well but no longer does as it's been out for a while. The kindle rank is a snapshot of how a title is doing in one market at one point in time in one medium.  Or it might be a book not intended to get sales but only to build a profile. Lots of non-fiction writing is simply a springboard for speaking engagements rather than intended to become a realistic income stream in its own right."

Trad pub - want book to be best it can possibly be, want to be part of a broader team, less interested in marketing, keen on selling movie or TV rights, willing to have smaller piece of larger pie.  Trad publishing is working for me, but it's not for everyone. You can absolutely self-publish your first book and build your name from that, but I would strongly suggest bringing on a top-notch editor to make sure it's as polished as possible (and, equally important, that you learn the finer details of fiction writing)."

Do you have a large social media presence or are you willing to build one?  (I have my doubts as to whether or not social media really sells books, but I know I am in the minority there).  If you like getting out there and selling your book, then self-publishing might work.

Really valuable stuff. You can also join a writers guild or whatever if you go that route. Self-publishing is alright, but only worth an effort if you can't go traditional, but I assume if all and every publishing house reject you, then your work isn't all that good anyway.

You might have better results with a novella since they're not as much of a time commitment.

All of this makes it really hard to slog through.  Now, if you called me and said, hey Andy, can you read my book and tell me what you think? Maybe ask if I like the concept, the setting, the story, the writing, and if I stopped reading, where and why. Did I notice any holes?  There is a big difference between test readers (beta readers) and editors. You pretty much need a completed manuscript before an editor (meaning already edited to the best of your ability). Because you should pay editors due to the work involved.  There is also something called a developmental editor which help you form you book. Kinda like a paid mentor. You probably don't need that, you need to write a whole other novella, and then come back to the first one with all the learning you gained from writing the second."

To dip into the neurology of it, creative thinking comes mostly from the frontal lobe. When your emotional brain (lymbic system) or reptilian brain (amygdala) take over (like when you panic or feel overly emotional, etc.), you lose access to your frontal lobe.  So can you lose your creativity? No. It's a skill built over time. Can you lose access to your creativity? You bet. And freaking out about it is one of the best ways to lock yourself out.  As for losing passion, I think that's a different struggle entirely, and one that almost every writer faces.

When I was younger, it would trickle along merrily, without any blockages or distractions. But when the problems started, they flowed along the river like globs of mud, until there was so much mud the river was dammed. Stagnant. Not a trickle.  To break the dam, I use creativity in different ways than straight-up writing. Each day I try to stream-of-consciousness journal, which is a great way to get crap out of your head. I also have daily journals with prompts in them. I colour in, childish as it sounds. I love taking photos and Instagramming them. When I can, I cross-stitch. All of these things help chip away at the dam, make the current stronger, until it cracks and starts to flow again. But you have to keep doing these things to keep it flowing, otherwise it'll dam up again. All these little things will make your creativity drive stronger, and much easier to access.

Kinda of like how I hate Keeping UP With the Kardashians even tho ive never seen it.   To elaborate, her writings illustrate the clash of cultures she grew up with and embraced and the values she expresses as being most important in her writings are exactly the values/behaviors that were repressed in her totalitarian homeland (except atheism, they didn't repress that).   Her modern day equivalent would be a North Korean defector that decided to write dystopian novels reflecting the worst qualities of the DPRK. But anyone shitting all over that writers vision wouldnt get the same bandwagon support.   The politicians that claim to espouse her principles and ideas are full of shit because those politicians never seem to be atheists. They just think that billionaires shouldn't pay any taxes because a writer from a failed communist state expresses one polar extreme of the state's confiscating wealth (because she was from a failed communist state). So just because Paul Ryan is an asshole, that doesn't mean Ayn Rands writings arent interesting or worthwhile or at least culturally significant."

So they believe that if they read it, they will understand Objectivism.  Unfortunately, that's not the case.  She wrote the book as more of an illustration of her philosophy.  To really understand her, one would need to read her non-fiction.  However, most people get through Atlas Shrugged, poke holes in the story and the writing, and then think she's full of it.  It's really quite unfortunate.    Edit: it's also not surprising that Thompson chose Fountainhead.  It's central theme is integrity."

It rationalizes ""me, me, me,"" while appearing to exemplify save yourself before you save others. Rational self interest dictates a pervasive ideal of cowardice for survival. All that said, on a crashing plane one puts their oxygen mask on first before helping others, but one doesn't take the other person's first and then decide they have enough oxygen as her words eventually lead."
writing,3dudpq,Sardonislamir,2,Mon Jul 20 07:35:59 2015 UTC,"The characters in Rand's work are far too black and white to be real. They were likely made that way to emphasize the philosophy of her work. Rand likely studied men in power at her time and picked aspects that felt were appropriate for the message she was trying to send.   There-in lies the problem - A sycophant is ultimately driven by greed, or self-desire, to have control over others. Rationalizing a sycophant's behavior is only a lesson in justifying greed.   I liked the idea presented forth about the meaning of life. Rand was an atheist, and the secular tone removes a lot of the irrational conclusions that emotions may bring from a religious answer. The question could be, ""Why did God put us here?""   Rand's characters assert we were put here to reach out into nature and shape it our will - to make something from nothing. Utilize our talents to contribute."

In other words, the ""me, me, me"" part is precisely the misunderstanding because people hear the word selfish and have a negative association with it.  Helping the homeless or any kind of charity is perfectly inline with her philosophy."

In Hong Kong, Dallas or at home — and regardless of whether or not I have been to bed — breakfast is a personal ritual that can only be properly observed alone, and in a spirit of genuine excess. The food factor should always be massive: four Bloody Marys, two grapefruits, a pot of coffee, Rangoon crepes, a half-pound of either sausage, bacon, or corned beef hash with diced chiles, a Spanish omelette or eggs Benedict, a quart of milk, a chopped lemon for random seasoning, and something like a slice of Key lime pie, two margaritas, and six lines of the best cocaine for dessert… Right, and there should also be two or three newspapers, all mail and messages, a telephone, a notebook for planning the next twenty-four hours and at least one source of good music… All of which should be dealt with outside, in the warmth of a hot sun, and preferably stone naked.”"

And I always forget about non-fiction,  but non-fiction really helps with positioning the reader and description. But the list does fall well and truely into the 'literary' canon so make sure you're also reading some texts that you enjoy, whether it's commercial lit or fan fiction.

If you're looking to expand your vocabulary then I'd recommend reading books from the late 1800s before people stopped learning how to be well read and educated.  Jane Austin and the like. The point here is is that culture and society has changed to belittle intelligence and being well read and being able to communicate with a degree of acumen is almost shunned.  At least that's my experience in the business world anyway.  Your typical employee will be lucky to have a 9th grade reading level.  Even your typical college student tends to struggle with the intricacies of reading and writing.  On a similar note though simply being told to ""read,"" more is just as silly as you propose.  The normal question would be ""read what?"" You're right.

This novel is as close you can get to ""reading,"" a documentary movie.  In summation you need to have a good grounding in how to write correctly.  This is to say that you need an expert level knowledge of grammar and how to craft sentences so that they are clear and can be understood.  For instance in your original post you stated that people had advised you ""to read,"" but ""the problem is [that] I don't know which books to read."" The word ""that,"" can be used as a pronoun, adverb, adjective, conjunction, and a definite article.  Most of what people ""consider,"" clever writing is being able to play with words meaning that while the word used in context makes sense, it's actual definition seems tangentially related.  I don't know.  I hope some of this helps.  I've been rambling and 3600 characters seems like a little much.  All the best,"

I also have a feeling that his style just doesn't speak to me. I'd like to give it a go at some other point in my life though.  Heart of Darkness is a great recommendation as well.

Well I clearly remember the  first chapter is tough because it starts near the end of the story, and is very dry, describing the museum he is hiding in at the end. But upon finishing it, I remember thinking, ""Wow, you can cut up and reorder stories and interweave parallel narratives"".   Aside from it sublime use of language to describe insights into the human condition, Heart of Darkness also shows how to nest narrators. ie we have a narrator telling us of someone else narrating their own story, which talks about other people. This allows you to add layers of complexity of interpretation, which can shift in time and space. eg the older Marlowe can interpret events differently from how he did when they first happened."

Not all of them I've LIKED at all, but I did learn something from reading each of them. These are the ones at the top of my head right now, so bear with me:  Tolkien, Edgar Allen Poe, The Harry Potter Series, Hunger Games, Charles Dickens (Tale of Two Cities is my personal favorite), Hemingway, George R.R. Martin, ""Patchwork Planet"" by Anne Tyler, Issac Asimov, Neil Gaiman, J.D. Salinger, Nabokov, Kafka, Tolstoy, ""The Outsiders"" by S.E. Hinton, ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" by Lemony Snicket (Kids books, but even though I read them as a kid, I loved the way he used words and it stuck with me.), ""The Sunne in Splendor"" by Sharon Kay Penman (Historical fiction, but really well researched and beautifully written.), Toni Morrison, Langston Hughes, Maya Angelou.  I could go on, but there ya go.  I also encourage you to look outside of novels. Look at poetry, plays, short stories, etc. Plays are awesome because they're shorter reads, but you can really see how every line is a piece of DNA in telling the story.  And, here's my best advice, when in doubt, ALWAYS pick up Shakespeare."

But I can hopefully come with some advice: Since you felt your writing style is too simple, try to push yourself a little harder when you write. For example: If you usually write nice, cute love stories. Try writing something morbid or scary. You need to get out of your comfort zone. It might not be the best story, but the more you write the better you get. And that led me to my next point. WRITE! Get people to read over your story and give you some constructive criticism. Probably the hardest thing about writing is having someone rip your story to pieces. Although it's hard, it is totally necessary to become better.  ANd since you asked for some books. Might I suggest Classics. It's a reason they have stayed at the top of the list for decades.

The reason I say some of these is because you've probably been force fed the classics and sometimes you just need to see what's going on today.

Honestly, the only way your writing is going to improve is by doing it regularly and often. So read, but then embark upon some exercises to incorporate some of what you have read. Try rewriting a scene from the book by memory, trying to evoke the voice, the style, the pace.   In general, write a lot, every day if you can. The more you write, the better you will be. I've been writing all my life, and recently finished a book (and just landed an agent). While I'm in the process of getting that first book sold, I've started writing the second book. I am truly amazed at how much easier it is this time around, how much better the plotting is, the characterization, the voice, setting and the magic of it all. I honestly believe its because I've done it before. I spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours on that first book and all that practice is manifesting itself in the second.   Read. Write. Write. Read. Write. Write. That should be your mantra.   To throw my hat in on a recommend, however, one book that is beautiful and vastly different than some of the good books already suggested is Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities. It's a short book that's a gorgeous and fantastical conversation between Kubla Khan and Marco Polo. I mention it because the style is so unique."

I think we should resist this idea that writers should be businesspeople as well as storytellers.  It may be necessary to a point, but no amount of marketing is going to get people to like your book if your writing stinks."

I'm familiar with Cormac McCarthy's works, but not his career, so I can't really speak to that particular example; however, I think before the advent of the internet the publishing world was very, very different. Because of various gatekeepers, someone talented could languish in obscurity for years. Today they still can, but since the internet has (in some ways) democratized the whole process, there are many more avenues for getting your work out there. I feel like there's more responsibility on the writer, for better or worse, in recent years to make their work successful."

If you have a minimal product that isn't particularly popular then you have to work hard at the selling side (or hire someone to).  I'm by no means saying that people shouldn't write what they want, at the quality they want for the love of it, but if you don't write a lot and don't work on selling it then it's your own fault it doesn't make you money.

writing,3dz2o2,khokhobra,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:33 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the vast majority of us are smaller cogs in a much larger, incredibly complex apparatus. Smaller stories can and do commonly take place inside a much bigger one without having a history-altering impact on that bigger story. So an individual soldier can live or die during WWII, but the Axis still loses and the allies still win.   Ideally you don't want to change the historic events in your story (well, not unless you're Quentin Tarentino), so (a) you do research so your details are right and (b) you have your smaller story play out within the context of the bigger one.   You can and probably will make some alterations to the historic record so that your story works--i.e. ""artistic license"". Ideally you (a) alter facts that are so minor that the vast majority of readers won't notice and/or (b) tell your story so well that your readers are too involved in it to have the alterations jar them out of the narrative.   One approach you can take is find factual accounts of events that took place in the time period in question. Then alter these events so that your characters perform the same actions. Just be gracious enough to give proper credit in some sort of afterword. For examples of this, refer to Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series."

I think the best thing to do would be to read actual examples of this. I don't know of any off the top of my head but I don't think it would be hard to find some. Just don't force the history. History should have a clear basis in your piece so as to make it accurate and recognizable, but I think it's best to build the history around your story rather than trying to build your story around history. History can altered in fiction, as long as it fits well in the story and is not completely unrealistic. Basically, I think you should write as if history is your making and you are not writing about the past. You are writing about the present and the history is just inspiration for events that happen in this fictitious present. Idk if that helped or even made sense."

I've definitely been through books with open endings that made me really angry. Reading an author's whole book is kind of a small act of trust.

writing,3dw6rq,novelconcepts,3,Mon Jul 20 06:36:12 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, vague is the thief of a good storyline. Anything vague should be ironed flat until the audience knows what is going on.   I've yet to see vagueness improve any media.  However, what you've described doesn't sound vague.  If you can more or less guess what is going to happen, then it's OK.  If you have no idea if she used the walkie talkie, if they responded, what's happening at all, that's bad.  If it's left unknown whether she'll be rescued or not, but you know what she said and what they said, that's fine too. That's ambiguous, not vague."

As a reader I feel you must answer issues you have raised, and not forget them. For instance I just read The Finkler Question (2010 Man Booker prize winner), and was totally underwhelmed by the ending, because the major turning point of the book for the protagonist was a mysterious mugging he believed was racially based, and we never find out whether that is the case, and the major relationship he embarked upon after and because of the mugging is also let slip without a direct mention."

writing,3dw6rq,gibmelson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:09:21 2015 UTC,"It's hard to make a vague ending work successfully but it can certainly be done. I think the most important thing is that we don't leave the story until after we have seen a complete character arc and after you have tied up all of the foreshadowed elements. Otherwise you will leave your reader feeling cheated or dissatisfied. A vague ending will not necessarily leave a bad taste in the reader's mouth, but failing to tie up loose ends will. The story structure still has to be there."
writing,3dw6rq,ryanaldred,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:46:37 2015 UTC,"Are you writing a novel or a short story? If you've had a ton of build up to this ending (as in, reaching the national guard is the climax of the story) then some cool down and wrap up will be appreciated. If there was some other event that was the actual climax of the story (like your protagonist has to survive crawling out of a ruined building that she's been going through most of the book and contacting the national guard afterwards is part of the wrap up) then you don't necessarily need to have her be out and out rescued.  That said, I do think that vague endings (even vaguer than you've described) can work. Life doesn't wrap itself up in a neat little bow, your story doesn't necessarily have to either. Your story does need some sort of climax, but leaving a few threads hanging, or even a major one, can be very effective."

Though the writing is pretty subpar quality since you're going for quantitiy instead. It's a first draft though, so it should be fine.  The best person to hold you accountable is you, but you don't need to drop your entire social life to do. It is okay to take a day off from writing, though you should be careful to manage your time properly. If someone wants to make plans for the evening, write more in the morning. And quite frankly, if someone is going to stop being your friend because you decline to hang out with them and they don't like your reason, you're probably better off without them, though I imagine you're blowing the scenario out of proportion in your head.  Seriously though, you don't need to give people a reason. Just tell them you have other plans and if they're a grown up, they'll deal with it.  My writing goal this month is to finish the story I'm working on, whatever that takes. I won't be removing any distractions. I'll be training my willpower, rather than trying to remove things that test it. I'll be keeping myself accountable, though I also have people waiting on the continuation of a serial publication I currently have on hiatus. None of them are nagging me.

Writing the same thing, i got into it end of May, i have 2 novels as of right now, one is being published. Its summer time for me, and im in university, so i got all the free time on my hands.  BUT  i think that its a matter of moderation. Writing is cool and all, but im pretty sure that most of us on this SR treat it as a hobby, or something on the side. Its cool to have hobbies, but i wouldnt dive into them head first, to the point where you neglect people, and responsibilities. General rule is to try and write everyday, but im sure when you have time, youll dive in and knock out 2-5k in a session, and beat your daily goals. Setting yourself the goal of writing everyday kills procrastination, because after you start writing, youll keep on writing.

My reasons for not writing those days were reasonable; one involved a family event requiring a lot of travel to attend, taking all day, and the other was following news of a death that left me feeling unable to write. But there's no way, come Sunday this week, that I'm going to write on my blog: ""Monday. 0 words. I just felt lazy."" So I put my music on, stuck my ""do not disturb"" sign on my study door, and got to it. And wouldn't you believe it, I wrote more than twice as many words today than I managed yesterday.  Clear goal, accountability. Works wonders."

It's fine to write a work of fiction in which water spontaneously combusts under a specific set of circumstances, as long as it always happens when those circumstances are met, and never happens when they're not. If there's an exception in there, it damn well better have a good explanation. In the real world, when something doesn't work the way we think it should, it's not well understood yet. In fiction, it's a plot hole (though figuring out why it's not doing what it's supposed to could be a plot point in and of itself)."

writing,3dy7rv,Chimp-Spirit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:36 2015 UTC,I disagree with u/codexofdreams (as you know...)  Working within the realm of science only improves science fiction. I think Weir said something along the lines of it pretty much lighting the way. Every answer you find brings challenges/difficulties of its own for the character/plot that you may never have thought of.  If you can imagine a way that water would combust under specific conditions it opens new possibilities. You should always do  your research before going the u/codexofdreams route.  For instance with the example involving water: This could be achieved with flash photolysis using an excimer laser - it sounds scifi but it's real. This would cause the water to split into highly combustible hydrogen and oxygen (which would then explode from the laser if you kept it on or used it wrong). This tech would likely be found in waterwaste treatment tech on a spacecraft/space-colony or for the generation of rocket fuel/green combustible fuel somewhere where electricity is extremely cheap ( which may imply fusion power).  You could obviously weaponize this piece of equipment the same way the exosuit was in Aliens.

In star trek I don't get annoyed when some dohickey is broken in a way that doesn't make scientific sense.  In a Tom Clancy book I DO get upset when an action sequence turns on a gun malfunctioning in a way that doesn't make scientific sense.  Another example... Jurassic Park is based on DNA being frozen in amber for 65 million years.  Turns out DNA breaks down after 10 million years even if stored correctly.  Who cares?  No one!  The idea of Jurassic Park isn't cloning dinosaurs and technically how to do that, it is about playing god in a way that is actually tempting and really unlocking our imagination about what opportunities future science offers.  Jurassic Park works just as well if instead of cloning the dinasaurs we have some nerd use new knowledge of genetics to design the dino DNA from the ground up to create creatures who look like we want them to.  On the other hand, if Bill Gates wrote a sci-fi book about AI and the dangers it poses, the technical details would be immensely important.  That would be worth reading specifically because of the technical side and the implications specific technologies have.  If he bungled his science it wouldn't be worth reading.

If you're writing a story about how STEM is the future of humanity, and you're fumbling details it will be a lot more damaging than if the story is about the dangers of hubris and in the course of playing god humans create their own demons.  If it serves the story, and is not completely unreasonable, the average person will be willing to let it slide.    For example, in the recent film Lucy being really smart somehow lets people change the colour of their hair, and use telekinesis.  Being smart makes you Iron Man, who knows how to create devices to do those things, it doesn't make you Super Man.  Knowing how to do something is not the same as being able to do it.  This was one case where not having the science right was a serious detriment to the story.  Stephen Hawking can read all the books on breakdancing and parkour in the world, but it doesn't suddenly make him able to get up out of the wheelchair and do flips and shit.  On the other hand, in another recent film Shadow Recruit the protagonist breaks his back and still manages to drag some people out of a crash.  Sure, whatever, I'm willing to let that slide because the entire point of the movie is that he's a badass super spy or whatever.  Unless the science is the fulcrum of the story, bending it a little isn't going to break the story.  If you need to drop in a MacGuffin or some Phlebotinum.  A small serving of Sufficiently Advanced Technology, used in moderation, can help a story get where it needs to go.  Or depending on exactly how strict you're sticking to the genre, some Sufficiently Advanced Magic might not hurt either.  It's only when the things blatantly slap you in the face that things get weird.  Like if the story is about a race of aliens who evolved underground in close confines where things are rarely more than ten feet away, but for some reason have distance vision in excess of a human which they use to shoot all our planes out of the air because the story is about how the science geek who was unpopular in highschool will be the saviour of the human race by cultivating a strain of yeast that generates unlimited thermal energy and lets us create lightsabres.

writing,3dy7rv,Chimp-Spirit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:36:02 2015 UTC,"When determining how ""scientifically founded"" a story needs to be, the main question is who benefits more?  If the readers benefit from made-up rules--the idea is exciting, imaginative, and is enjoyable to read, if it looks like the author put effort into the creative side of things--then they'll accept it as ""rules of the world.""  If, however, the author clearly benefits the most, then it will make you look like a hack. In other words, if it seems like you changed or ignored the rules of physics because it's easier for you, because you're not well informed, didn't feel like doing the research or the editing, then it will be a ""bad"" book.  I personally don't really like science based science fiction, or fantasy that goes deep into all the rules of magic. I am happy with an imaginative if unrealistic set of world-rules as long as their feels like a continuity and the writer isn't just making them up to suit him.  Also, true creativity comes from solving problems. If you realize that it is important to make your book make sense with the laws of our science, challenge yourself to do so instead of scrapping it. It's a lot of work, but THAT is often be what makes your book stand out."

It's like if the Sorting Hat in Harry Potter went ""Okay, I'm gonna tell you which house to belong in, but you can actually pick whichever you want lol.""

However, As /u/chilari said, writing is subjective, and it is difficult to pin down a hard measurement of progression. If you're interested in a more abstract concept, here is what I've learned in my experience.  The thing is, you'll just notice it. You'll realize it gets easier to keep your fingers moving, or you'll see an increase in the amount of times you feel good about something you just wrote.  You'll start at chapter 1, write something horrid, then chapter 2, and it will be awful, and by chapter 10, it will still be bad, but bad is better than awful. When you first start out, you will be able to go back, read chapter 1, and think holy shit that's bad.  After a while, the progression won't be as noticeable. That is when I personally started to worry. Just keep working at it though, because you'll finish novel 2, then go back to novel 1 and realize it's garbage. Progression is marked, in my opinion, by being able to see the bad. When most first write something, they can see the bad, but can't say why. As you progress, you will be able to identify things you couldn't before.   I know I used novels as an example, but it still works for all kinds of writing. If you write a business paper, then write another, you'll start to notice the bad in paper 1. Mind you, this isn't fact, this is just my own personal experience with progression."

I have a vague idea of a plot or ending, add a character I find interesting, then just write. This method requires a lot of rewrites and revision, because when I finish, the story/character is far more concrete than they were at the beginning.  Of course, outliners fall on the other side of the spectrum. They can range anywhere from sketching out various plot points to full on descriptions of every scene, chapter, character, setting, and so on.  Then there are the writers who fall somewhere in between.   I don't know if any specific technique is used more commonly than others, but if I had to guess, I imagine the most common would be some variant of an outliner. Outlines make the story less intimidating, and it's easier to not get stuck if you know where your story is going. Plus, outliners don't have to rewrite as many times as a pantser does.  When you're deciding what method or technique to use, don't just focus on what is easiest, instead pay attention to which process gives you the most joy. I definitely see the merit in outlines, it would significantly cut down the time it takes me to finish my writing, but I just don't enjoy that process. I love exploring a setting or plot through the eyes of my character. I love learning about him and what he does in a more hands on approach.

writing,3duusc,OlanValesco,2,Mon Jul 20 03:41:43 2015 UTC,"I think it was ""On Writing"" that gave the 50/50 ratio, but I don't recall the exact quote.  For me, I would expect that when you are starting out on the writer's path, you would read 70% of the time, and write 30%. As you get more adept with the tools of the writing trade, that ratio would shift to increase the writing side of the equation.  Essentially, reading is training. You are seeing how to put together words, sentences, paragraphs, chapters, books. You are also learning how to develop characters, story lines, and scenes.  An apprentice woodworker might sit alone in a shop with all sorts of tools he has no idea how to use, and the finest wood in the world surrounding him. But the likelihood that he is going to produce something wonderful is like the million monkeys on a million typewriters problem... it's vanishingly unlikely.  But when that apprentice sees other woodworkers at work, sees their products, their techniques, their craftsmanship, then the apprentice mimics those things. At first, they are rough and unfinished and not pretty. But as the apprentice works at it, their work becomes better and better... and - hopefully one day - one of the woodworkers that the apprentice idolizes will pick up the apprentices' work and say, ""Wow... this is really good.""  But language is a mutable and changing thing. A newspaper or book from even as recent as the 1960's has a style, tone, and meter that is very different from today's writing. So you have to KEEP READING to keep your tools sharp.  Finally, as for the 50/50 ratio you called into question, I don't think that is unreasonable. Especially in our always-on world.  If we adhere to the plan laid out in ""On Writing"", we'd write for 4 hours in the morning, every single day.  It is not unreasonable to think that throughout the rest of the day we might take an hour to sit and read a book for pleasure, read the news and longer-form stories for a total of a couple of hours, and - if we are serious writers - sit down in the evening with The Book We Are Reading Right Now. This is the book we are reading and analyzing for form, method, content, style, etc.  So a 50/50 ratio seems like the ideal to me. You have to refill the gas tank, and for a writer, reading is the fuel. (IMHO.)  What are your thoughts?"

writing,3duusc,happycj,23,Sun Jul 19 23:12:51 2015 UTC,"Then your problem isn't not writing. It's being boring and uninteresting.  Most people who sit down to write have a story to tell, with characters inside their minds that are fighting to show the reader all sorts of interesting things. Often, the problem is that new writers are afraid of ruining those ideas, somehow, or find the actual writing process boring. You don't seem to have that problem. You have a worse one for a creative writer.  No interesting ideas.  So fix that part. Before starting to ""write a story,"" write an outline, a summary statement of your plot, and standalone character studies of your main characters.  Read critically and make sure you know what a professionally sculpted plot looks like. Study your favorite books and ask yourself why the author wrote every single sentence you read. A skilled writer doesn't waste a sentence, and they all have a purpose.  Look into the Hero's Journey, three act structures, and (for something more contemporary and pop) Dan Harmon's Story Structure 101. Watch Brandon Sanderson's BYU English lectures on writing interesting plots.  If you can and do put words together and they aren't interesting, fix that part. If you can't come up with something original, do fanfiction of your favorite book, movie, or TV series and publish it where people can see and critique it. Focus on the positive, constructive criticism. Read the negative feedback and discuss it with someone friendly, but don't directly responded or argue with negative comments, period.  If you can't come up with a story hook to begin with, use /r/WritingPrompts or other group brainstorming and flash-fiction projects. Read http://www.writingexcuses.com/ and use some of theirs (and read the rest). Visit *writers' blogs and see how they discuss their own creative process, how they get stuff published, or just how they live as writers.  And if you don't want to do all of that, or if somehow none of that helps, the harsh truth is that maybe you aren't actually interested in being a creative writer."
writing,3duusc,TimeLoopedPowerGamer,3,Sun Jul 19 19:41:36 2015 UTC,I like that you use Sanderson as an example. Many people (including him) will say that he doesn't have the best prose. But blight me if those aren't some of the best books I've read.

To me, sometimes I'm really enjoying someone's prose, but then I want them to just stop showing off and get on with the plot. Short of a masterful balance between the two (which not many achieve), I'll pick Sanderson over the alternative. Though this is absolutely a matter of preference, as I read for the story first, and prose second.  That said, I think there's a lot to learn from how Sanderson writes his action scenes. They are almost cinematic in the way he lets you picture them in your head without breaking their pace. I still vividly remember many."

writing,3duusc,TimeLoopedPowerGamer,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:32 2015 UTC,"Most welcome. You can also do the same thing with movies, and perhaps that's a good way to look at it even for books. Imagine you are one of those guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000 while reading a book or watching a movie for the plot. Every time you see a Chekhov's gun, note it. Every time someone makes a prophetic statement, do an internal snarky comment on it. Look for the 2-4 character traits every main character usually has. Try to suss out what the writer was thinking when they did every little plot point or line of dialog.  Writers try to avoid exposing the artifice of writing, that the things written are huge coincidences or put together for a purpose. They keep that fact from impacting the story too much as that breaks the reader out of things. But you can force yourself to notice the seams and pick at them. It gets to be a lot of fun, but it can also do the same thing a music degree does: ruin your enjoyment of cheap, pop entertainment."

First drafts, and many that follow, tend to be rubbish, hardly close to what you originally intended. That's why there's another trite phrase in every writer's toolbox: Writing is rewriting. You have to take a long hard look at what you've written, assess its strengths and weaknesses, and then edit and revise accordingly. Taylor Polites gave a lecture about revision and compared writing to sculpting, that we're constantly chiseling away at the block of marble until it becomes art.   The other thing I'll say, just to echo the others here, is read, read, read. Break them down and learn from them. After a while, it will all make sense."

If you spend five minutes on each sentence trying to get the wording right, then you are going to very quickly kill your enthusiasm. Those people just need to finish the draft and then go back and work on the little things. It doesn't sound like you have that problem.  There's nothing wrong with spending some time setting out an outline of your plot or building a few character charts to give the characters some personality. In fact, I would say that it is very important to know who the characters are and where the story is going. You just have to make sure that creating the story's backbone doesn't end up consuming all of your time.  You say you're new to fiction writing; do you know about Scenes and Sequels? Do your minor characters have their own motivations or are they just a sounding board for the major characters? Are the major characters advancing the story or is the story happening to them?"

Presume your first draft is horrendous. But if you articulate the thought so there is a good base for something else then you can make it into pretty art on another draft. I guess what I'm saying is that you are practicing the fundamentals. No matter what you do in life you should always practice the fundamentals.

If you're doing 2k/day, you are getting better whether it seems that way or not. Keep going and try to focus on the journey more than the end game (great, accomplished writer of the future). Storytelling is a unique craft, in some ways independent of great writing. Obviously, most fiction writers want to be both, but Stephen King proves it isn't necessary. He's a middling writer and a good storyteller. To improve your storytelling, I'd offer a few little pieces of advice. For instance, if you're a noob, keep things very small. Come up with a character you like and a small problem he/she must solve. This is the bare essence of storytelling. This can be a one-page story, or 5 or 10. Keep it very small and keep doing these. Some will be terrible, but you'll have some nice short stories in no time. You'll surprise yourself. I went through this, and still do small stories, and I've found they're fun, easy, and sometimes excellent. For great examples of small stories (and by small I mean short stories that aren't terribly deep or profound), try the book Crow Fair by Thomas McGuane. Trust me."

Continue to write and continue to toss it in a drawer.  A month later you can read what you writing now and visually see the improvements.  This is why it is terrible advice though. I want to see improvements now, see the words come alive now.  I don't have patience to wait a month to see ""take a second look"" as quite of few people say they do.  Honestly if I write a book and toss it in a drawer for a month, I will probably forget about it and lose interest.  The ""second eyes"" doesn't work at all with me.  What did work for me was to pick up a book called ""642 Things to Write About' by The San Francisco Writers' Grotto. This book was something completely different for me because it made me stop and think. It didn't give me ideas for a story, and it didn't outline what I needed to do, but it helped me improve by what I as doing by giving me challenges.  I was having issues with descriptive details and seeing things from different angle, etc.    Try a different approach, just because ""Just Write"" worked for some people, doesn't mean it works for everyone."

But what about the quality of that writing?  Remember that the first and most important layer of quality control is your own mind. If you allow it to juke out 2000 words a day without much consideration you only train it at juking 2000 words a day.   If a story doesnt have depth enough for you - don't start writing until you come up with one that does. The trick here is not to wait for some magic inspiration, but instead - find ways of actively comming up with that stuff. Like one-man brainstorming sessions.  And then do what others suggest - read a lot, analyze what you really like about somebody elses writing, take notes about your ideas and all that."

One of the reasons I actually started writing more recently is because I started reading a good deal of Asimov's works, almost all of which is short stories, it will give you a sense of how they should work.   Then, once you have a short story or two, or maybe even twenty, under your belt, you will be ready to take those characters and plots into something much longer.

The general idea is that the US gets to a point that to curb crime, they start stereotyping people based on race, genetic markers, gender, and family history. Through this determining those that would be less likely to commit a crime, and those that would be more likely.   In a way, I expect it to be a kind of social commentary, in that the best way to deal with something that offends you; isn't to simply just outlaw it.  Also how those who often stand up and proclaim that they are for equality, or the right way of thinking, in turn are very often the persons behind the inequality, or offensive actions.

writing,3dx0u1,kzielinski,3,Mon Jul 20 06:30:42 2015 UTC,"I write gaslamp fantasy - that is, fantasy set in an industrialised or slightly more advanced society than the Middle Ages.  Story: I'm very much a discovery writer. If an idea comes to me, I find it easy to write a story just growing out of the first couple of scenes. I tend to find a structure for it as I write, and don't often mess too much with that structure if it produces a viable first draft. Sometimes I can be a bit perfunctory with the scenes; I spend a long time adding enough detail and revising, and the latest work required a huge amount of research to make things feel realistic, because it involved an unfamiliar culture that I was worried about misrepresenting, plus a lot of detail about how an ocean liner might respond to a giant sea-snake being impaled on the flagpole. (On the plus side, I got to go and see Jurassic World and call it work :D.)  Character: Again, I find discovery a better technique than deliberate construction. Characters work best for me if they're not a bundle of traits and motivations and a meaningful name. I tend to construct a role for them first - e.g. gangster's moll - and then think of how to round them out - the woman isn't just a pretty face; she's aching for respectability and has obtained a responsible position, which allows her to be a gangster at night but gives her the respectable facade. The character develops in response to the story and their environment. Naming...I go on newspaper sites associated with the ethnicity of the character and choose a name that I like. This avoids having to use very heavy-handed symbolism, and yet more often than not the name is reflective of them. For example a character called Ciesla (Polish version of Carpenter, and a cognate of the name Tesla, as in Nikola) might be a bit staid and dull, ponderous...almost wooden. But I didn't really plan him that way; it just fit his part in the story to be the shy, rather conservative person trying to keep everyone happy and failing abysmally.   The gangster's moll I called Aushra Vainyte, a Lithuanian name (I use real-world cultures in a kind of alternate-geography Earth setting); the Vain- part of her name simply comes from the name I chose (Vainis) altered to suit her gender and marital status in the manner of Lithuanian names. But coincidentally, it's pronounced the way it looks in English...  ...so one of the characters can say 'Vain by name, vain by nature' about her and get away with the pun :D. But by the same token it's not obvious that everyone has the name that fully suits their character or role. Some things are generally random IRL, and I like to keep them a bit more random in my stories."

Then nail down what the characters want and how they get from bit to bit throughout the narrative."
writing,3dx0u1,LadyGlen,2,Mon Jul 20 06:41:15 2015 UTC,"As a discovery writer, I like to think of a broad idea. Something that sounds interesting to me, or that I think would make for a good story. Next I like to figure out who my MC is, this is also done in broad strokes. Then I thrust him into this world or confront him with this idea, and go.  By the end, the MC is almost a brand new person, and far more refined, as is the idea or plot. After a rewrite, I start to see something I recognize as a theme. Rewrite number two allows me to incorporate that theme, add symbolism and foreshadowing, and tighten up the plot/characters even further. I continue with rewrites, cutting, adding, fixing, and structuring, until I have something I'm happy with.  Being a pantser requires a lot more work, but I can't work from an outline. I wouldn't be able to enjoy the process, I would feel confined. For others, the fun IS the outline process. Breaking the story down into digestible pieces that free you to focus on prose because you're not concerned with where the story is going or how to get to the end.  My point is that there are infinite ways of approaching it. My advice would be to try it both ways, and multiple combinations of the two, until you find what works best for you."

They’re afraid to describe the world they’ve invented.… This dread of writing a sentence that isn’t crammed with “gutwrenching action” leads fiction writers to rely far too much on dialogue, to restrict voice to limited third person and tense to the present.   I'd say the same about all the advice anyone gives (whether it's by King, Palahniuk, or Le Guin even). And to solidify my point with more advice from another author (Kurt Vonnegut this time):   The greatest American short story writer of my generation was Flannery O'Connor (1925-1964).

""Bob woke up"" is not what it's like to be Bob waking up, but readers probably don't need a whole scene of him repeatedly whacking the snooze button, even if he feels a bit guilty about that.  But say he's making himself late for his own wedding or a job interview, then that might be worth getting deeper into his experience.  Show what it's like to be the character when that experience is engaging to the reader (when he's in trouble, when there's something at stake, when what happens next really matters, etc.); tell when you don't want to make a big thing out of it (""Bob woke up and took the train to work."").

Revision is a writers best friend. If you can remove the pressure of writing a great first draft, writing becomes the best thing in the world. Get the story out, then worry about all those little things that make a good story great.  Obviously this approach requires a lot of rewrites, but it really helped me alleviate concern and writer's block.  I am also a discovery writer, or pantser. If that isn't your style, I've read that extremely detailed outlines can help remove the pressure. Start with a skeleton of your plot, then add detailed descriptions for each plot point. Continue with details about each chapter, then each scene. Write detailed sketches of your characters and your settings. That way, when you need to know what a character would do, or how to describe a setting, you can look back on your notes and figure out the best thing to do.

Are written by successful authors looking to make some more money off of people looking for help, by talking about how they go about writing books.

There are a few books that pull it off well, like anything by Bret Easton Ellis or The Death of Artemio Cruz by Carlos Fuentes. You can do interior monologue with it too; in fact, I think we tend to talk to ourselves in present tense, even if the event has already happened.   And for repetitive I's the way you go about that is kind of forget that the narrator is in the scene. We don't need to know every actioon he or she does or know that he or she is observing things. The first person is great because the narrator flavors the narrative, his or her biases become the reader's biases.

That aside, I think the opposite is true. FPPT works really well for me when you don't have a lot of action, or when you have a silent or reserved protagonist. In everyday life, I think about stuff far more than I verbalize, and FPPT is really about being in someones head, looking through their eyes, thinking their thoughts and feeling their emotions.   I also think it's a difficult style. You don't want to list events, but you don't want him sitting in a room pondering life either. As a writer, you really have to become that character. In other PoV's you're showing people a story that, if written in past tense, feels like a character somewhat reflecting on something that already happened. In FPPT, you need to notice only what the character would notice, and limit the amount of time you tell the audience something the character would do without thinking.  It is different for everyone, but the most engrossed I've ever been in a story was written FPPT. Kiss Me, Judas is a neo-noir novel that has a (in my opinion) god awful plot and empty supporting characters. However, it is the only novel I've ever read in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. The writing style, and the FPPT PoV really sucked me into the MC's head, and I've never experienced anything like that.  Kiss Me, Judas is also the only FPPT story I've ever read, so my experience is limited. The only thing I can say is, if the novel had a plot I would have actually found interesting, I can't imagine how much I would have loved that book.

writing,3dwxef,ThomasEdmund84,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:01:06 2015 UTC,"2)This is honestly some of the best writing I've ever read, in any genre. Cronin develops all of his characters, even the secondary ones, well beyond what would be necessary for the average reader, and it makes for some truly memorable individuals who come to life from the first page.  THIS was the reason I couldn't finish it. While I appreciate character development, I found it a bit too much, and honestly, it felt like unneeded filler.  I did like the writing for the most part, but it dragged on too much for me (reviews said the beginning was a gripping read - I found it slow). Note that I'm in the minority on this - MOST people liked the in-depth characterization, and honestly, the over-characterization made it a bit one-dimensional to me because everything was just told to me.   I mean, yeah, any book can be padded out, and I didn't finish it and put it down once the second section started. I might pick it up again because I did find it well-written, but just padded.   I hate to say I'm anti-characterization, because I'm not, but maybe it was just that none of the characters resonated with me, and the one I WANTED fleshed out didn't get fleshed out. Seventh to ninth nuns, fleshed out. Doyle's thing about being a salesman, fleshed out. Amy's mom's backstory, fleshed out. Her biological father's backstory, fleshed out. Anthony? Fleshed out. God, way too many character back-stories (granted, Anthony's is necessary, but some of those others, like the nun that runs? Really?). Didn't help that I felt literally nothing for Wolgast's sob story. After all, everyone else had them, too. It's just like: ""Next!"" Wolgast and Amy (Amy the child) were a bit bland for me. Technically, they seem well-written, so I'm not dissing the book outright.  Anyways, but Richards? I mean, come on! The big bad in that first section gets nearly no mention of a back-story? He was by far the most interesting, probably because of it, though.  Anyways, well written, may pick up again, but I didn't care for the characters at all, or feel anything for them or their fates. But I do think that characterization is good, overall, and his writing was something I enjoyed, plus the plot. Clearly I didn't get to the main story with Peter and Alicia, so this is just my thoughts on that first third."
writing,3dwnpj,xEmptyPockets,6,Mon Jul 20 03:48:46 2015 UTC,"Make the flaw/fear really specific. Indiana Jones was this brave badass dude who was utterly terrified of snakes. The Hound from Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire doesn't give a crap about anything but runs from any source of flame.  If your character is impatient, really expand on that. Put her in a situation when she loses her temper or cool because of it. She can't wait for her next pay check to come in to make a big purchase on something she really wants, so she buys something really expensive with a credit card when she really can't afford to, for example. Or she breaks her computer out of frustration because of a poor internet connection.  If a character is controlling or a perfectionist, throw them in a situation where everything is out of control and they're scrambling to regain control of their lives. If a character is trying to have a magazine type Christmas with their very dysfunctional family, they'll either try to control everyone, and probably fail, or they'll continue on an ignore it until it all falls apart.  Also, it probably shouldn't be something they notice THAT much or interferes with their everyday lives too much. If a character has a bad temper and just beats people up all the time, then that may be boring. If a character only loses it when they're insanely drunk (which may not be that often) then they're likely not to notice until they REALLY mess up like they beat up their best friend or something.  An impatient person has probably designed a life for themselves that offers instant gratification. They know the fastest commute to work, they have the fastest internet connection, they pay extra for faster shipping, etc. Throw them in a situation where they are forced to wait: The DMV, construction on their usual work commute, etc.  Turn that flaw into something that could ultimately destroy them in the end, if they do nothing about it. Indiana's fear of snakes almost killed him. The character with the temper while drinking could hit a person of authority or blow up at their boss and lose their job.   Also, good things can be flaws, the whole ""to a fault"" thing. A really generous person could give away more money than they can afford. A parent who is protective of their kid could end up driving the kid away. A character who loves their family could become driven for revenge and feel completely justified in doing so if something were to happen to their loved ones.   Defining specific flaws/fears, throwing your character in a situation where they're forced to deal with them, and exploring how they handle it is good writing."
writing,3dwnpj,LadyGlen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:18:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice, I really like your idea of taking a positive character trait and having it cause problems, I'll have to use that at some point."
writing,3dwnpj,LadyGlen,3,Mon Jul 20 04:27:02 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. One thing I forgot to add:  Look at your own flaws/fears and the ones of those around you and channel that. Think of them and how you/people you know would react. Also explore how and why these things came about.  I keep my feelings all wrapped up inside and don't talk about my feelings/emotions much. This came from my mother being a very emotional person who was really sensitive and seeing it negatively impact her life. I didn't want to be like that (Even though my mom is awesome and I love her to death!) so I became the opposite extreme. It can be a positive in that I don't freak out in emotional situations, but since I bottle up my feelings they come out at inopportune times.  I'm also terrified of spiders, so how would I handle being in a tropical place where the spiders are huge and terrifying? Would I put up with out? Would I have a breakdown? Would I accidentally kill an endangered spider and get some entomologists really angry at me? THAT would be an interesting read.  So think about WHY your character got so impatient. Did she have really chill parents who were constantly just sitting around, or missed flights or deadlines because they were TOO chill?   Is her impatience not a big deal in everyday life but she's forced to spend time with someone who's constantly late or really chill? Boom, you have a conflict.  Does a friend/family member of yours have a flaw/fear that wasn't a big deal on an every day basis, but over time you noticed it and you didn't understand it, or bugged the crap out of you? That's story material there.   Anyway, I rambled, but just things to think about."

Anyone that has ever tried to write something has had that nagging feeling that they're no good. I look at stuff I've written over the years, especially my earliest stuff, and I hate it. If every writer stopped writing when they or someone else thought what they wrote was bad there wouldn't be any writers. Hell, this could be applied to anyone pursuing something creative.   I make abstract paintings also. I've had people say that children could make what I make to my face. You can't let disparaging stuff like that get to you. I know it's hard, but instead of getting down on yourself you need to use that negativity as motivation to keep going.  It might also be worth it to answer this question: Why do you want to write? Do you want to become a published author? Do you want to simply share something with others? Do you do it to express yourself?  If you like the actual act of writing, keep with it. Write because you want to write. Don't worry about pleasing anyone but yourself."

It's a craft. Otherwise, no one would get better. It can be learned.   You need to write, first and foremost, for you. If you can leverage your art into something saleable, great, but this is your art. For yourself. Your passion, your hobby. Please don't give up on it. If you love doing it, then it's worthwhile. I'm a dreadful artist and musician, but I still paint, sing and play guitar because I love the process. As I get older I realise that this is what life is about - those pleasures that make you happy.

writing,3dvgsv,danyedits,2,Mon Jul 20 07:32:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you feel you aren't really capable of it, and multiple who know what they are talking about (not just some internet people) confirm your suspicions of inadequacy, then just stop trying to write for a commercial market. If it's really giving you that  much anxiety, just forget writing for profit.   I don't feel everyone is capable of being the next great author, and I especially don't believe the only thing separating an average/below-average writer from literary success is a good round of studying. You can get better, but if you aren't imbued with an inclination towards creativity, you aren't likely to write War and Peace anytime soon, no more likely is it that an average painter is going to run through high school art classes and college art classes then immediately create something akin to the Mona Lisa, or an average athlete, even after years of training is going to become a world class Olympian.   But part of being a creative spirit is a constant and nagging self-doubt. Some of what we would consider to be the greatest writers in the history of language might well have been afflicted with bouts of seriously self-doubt, and had they succumbed to it, the rest of society might not have benefited from their writing. Leonardo Da Vinci said ""I have offended God and Mankind because my work did not reach the quality it should have."" But his is some of the best art on the planet.   Even critics who view a work unfavorably because it contrasts against the current popular taste have been proven wrong years later by a new school of readers and writers. William Gaddis's The Recognitions is among the best works I've read and was viewed negatively upon its release - so negatively that Gaddis was discouraged from writing, perhaps to the detriment of the literary community.   Choosing to stop writing because someone told you you can't get better and because your work is bad is always a sticky business. Whether or not you stop trying to write for a commercial market is up to you (if, as you say, every single person you show your work to views it as negatively, you might consider the notion that you aren't meant to be a writer in the traditional sense). Even still, if you like the idea of writing, you shouldn't stop. It's a valuable thing to express yourself through this medium if you have no intention of releasing it publicly. The best part about this is that you can disregard completely any potential audience and write for yourself - and this sort of introspection can be therapeutic/ cathartic.   So it's up to you whether or not you want to stop trying to be the next thing in popular fiction (or whatever genre), but I would advise against stopping writing altogether. You might decide now to stop forever, and then some years later like to pick it up again. You wouldn't want to wait all those years being creatively inert, would you?"

If you're hearing constantly the same kind of critique no matter who is giving it, follow that advice.  The best thing I can suggest is get into critiquing other people at your level. If you can see how the choices they make impact their story in a negative way enough times, it finally dawns on you that while every rule can be broken, it's usually a lot harder to do than just following the guidelines.   It's not a bad thing to go back to the drawing board and systematically go through your baggage that you're carrying around in your writer's tool box to see if everything you are using is the best tool for the job. Writing is juggling nine balls in the air at the same time while the whole world is watching. Your characters, world, setting, language, tension, conflict, theme and plot all need to just flow into one another. If you can't do that successfully for the first couple decades, you're really no different than most everyone else. It's not about talent or skill, it's about making it through the horrible mediocrity that we all need to write to get it out of us so we can dive down deeper and pull up the stuff we really want to talk about."

Being able to create something new from what you already know is the highest.   Absolutely, the most important thing you have is your voice. No matter what you write, no matter what genre, it's going to be the thing that will catch the attention of whatever first reader is sitting in her stuffy office while her boss is off dining some client and she's stuck reading slush.   Write as much as you can, take it as far as you can possibly do it on your own. Write with an ideal reader in mind, one who is going to be absolutely pickled to turn the page to find out what happens next.   And watch out for critiques from unpublished writers trying to tell other unpublished writers how to stay unpublished. I've seen critiques where the one single emotionally connection scene in the entire piece had half the people in the group want it deleted because it made them feel something and they didn't like feeling it. Especially on online groups, critiquers are usually very generous to writing that is enormously beneath them and take the claws out to gut pieces that aren't actually all that bad.   Try to find a critiquer who can separate the ideas they have as readers as a separate thing as ideas they have in critique. A lot of critiquers want to know more than the writer is willing to share at that point, and while a regular reader is more than willing to give you the benefit of the doubt that you're going to pull this thing off, some critiquers won't give you an inch of trust that you know what you're doing."

I've noticed that too, and find teachers in school often do the same. I doubt it's intentional, but with beginning writers, people don't want to 'discourage' them, so they go easy on a lot of issues. While with more advanced writers, they look for more to nitpick even when nothing's that wrong. I've even gone so far on occasion to let someone know they've been given bad advice if I think it could be harmful.   On one site I had opening lines ripped apart by a couple of posters, which prompted some other ones to PM me saying they didn't know wtf they were on about. Fortunately by that time I'd also had professionals critique my work where all they had to say about it was go ahead and try to get published. A year or two earlier and I'm not sure what my reaction would have been.  Also, when critiquing, it's always good to qualify every thing as one person's opinion, with the exception of bad grammar, factual errors, spelling or improper word usage.

I'm bad for the ""you need to--""'s, though, so we're none of us blameless. Talking about writing takes an entirely new vocabulary, and talking about critique needs a whole new set of words. We don't teach how to build up when helping other writers.   And really, it may be a cliche, but if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all. You don't have to say all nice things, but if you're not the target audience for the piece and you found absolutely nothing to like about it at all, I wish people would just give it a pass.

Patterson is one of the most successful commercial fiction writers around, and people like Stephen King consider him an ""Awful writer."" I mean my god, look at 50 Shades of Grey.  You don't have to be a fantastic writer to have a story to tell. Write something you would want to read, because there's a good chance people with similar taste are out there.  Write a terrible first draft. Identify the areas that you dislike, and attempt to fix them. Then do it again. That is how you do it, period. Tell your story, edit it in a way that satisfies you, have it critiqued, adjust the things that you agree with from said critiques, put it out to different critiques, and keep doing that until you have a story you're happy with. It's a marathon, not a sprint.  I assume you're a reader? Figure out what it is in the books you love that make you love them. When you can identify something useful, apply it to your own writing.
