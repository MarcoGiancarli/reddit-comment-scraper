IgnorantImgur,3c0zl4,rgzdev,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:50:43 2015 UTC,"I understand you but i also think that's subjective.  I actually like pages that are as wide as possible because I don't keep the the browser window maximized all the time. Being able to control the width of a page is nice.  Also AFAIK imgur also requires you to clik in the front page links to see the actual images. From the frontpage you only see a partial thumbnail of one of potentially several images and text.To say that reddit is a mess because the thumbnails aren't as big as you like is like saying your house is a disorganized mess, because your windows aren't as big as I'd like."
IgnorantImgur,3c0zl4,TheLateOne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:07:25 2015 UTC,"2 points. 1, I emphasised in my post that this was all personal preference which I was adding to the conversation. If I struggled when I started maybe other new users would. There's an interesting debate below about whether you like reddit's layout because it's familiar or because it is good. Personally I would say it is familiarity over utility. I've heard the counter-arguments but most of them sound a little like justifications for bad design.   Secondly at no point did I say that imgur was better. Just because a site made by redditors for reddit has the same system of opening images doesn't make it a justification. I don't know exactly what a cleaner crisper version of reddit looks like but I'm sure many of the features you claim to cherish wouldn't be there.   ps I hate resizing the window, reddit gives up and forces everything into terrible 10 line per post columns. Whenever I resize the window I switch back because things like adverts mean I have to skip half the posts of the page just to get to less of a squashed mess."
IgnorantImgur,3c0zl4,rgzdev,0,Tue Jul 21 08:33:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know exactly what a cleaner crisper version of reddit looks like   That's the problem though. You don't understand the problem so you can't appreciate the solution.  The layout is what it is for good reasons, what the site tries to accomplish is somewhat complex by iteself so the layout reflects this. This is specially true of the comment and article sections, which are the parts imgurians complain about the most.  Unlike reddit, imgur content is almost exclusively images so they can get away with having a mozaic for the frontpage.  That and the fact that imgur isn't a place for discussion so things like categories are basically absent (tags simply aren't the same).   but I'm sure many of the features you claim to cherish wouldn't be there   The only actual feature I mentioned was the wide layout so I doubt that would change. There is certainly room for improvement but for comparison there is a Firefox extension called Reddit Enhancement Suite and what it does it is that it ADDS features to reddit, rather than remove them.  I'm pretty sure than an optimal solution will still be too complex for you."

IgnorantImgur,3c0zl4,HitodamaKyrie,2,Fri Jul 10 15:03:33 2015 UTC,"Those are your statements, but what is your reasoning? I'd say the design is most certainly more practical than anything at least, and how is it possibly not reader-friendly? Does your version shoot lasers in your eyes?"
IgnorantImgur,3c0zl4,akcaye,3,Sat Jul 11 09:55:11 2015 UTC,"How is it practical not to have the image within the post? Without RES, you have to click each fucking link to open it and see what it is. A website shouldn't encourage you to break your flow all the time. It also does this for comments. So you keep going away from your home page. That's not practical.  And if your bar for reader-friendly is ""doesn't shoot lasers in your eyes"", Jesus... that's a low bar.  Comments don't have a maximum width. That's not reader-friendly. The fact that your eyes have to go from the leftmost corner of the screen to the rightmost, and then back to the left, is terrible for a reader. See how many magazines use single-column design that covers the whole page width. How many newspapers do it? None. Depending on your resolution, the screen could take a ton of text horizontally, and that's not practical.  Also the comment indentation is shit. It goes too deep to the right, and eventually have comments that are now too narrow. Like, a dozen or so characters long. That's also not practical.  What you mean is not ""practical"", it's ""familiar"". You're used to it so much that it feels great. When someone suggests a redesign with some whitespace anywhere, a lot of people protest saying ""it doesn't utilize the whole space"". Well duh. We're not robots, we don't need maximum information (which would be noise, actually). We need a balance. Whitespace can keep you more focused. But it's like the Facebook redesigns. Each time the design changes people go batshit over how they can't do shit now. That's because they're not familiar. They all go quiet after a couple of weeks. And if you go back to a previous design they loved so much, they wouldn't know what to do now.  Reddit is not reader-friendly. Nor practical."
IgnorantImgur,3c0zl4,HitodamaKyrie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:15:05 2015 UTC,"If memory serves me right, reddit mostly began as a way to share links to other webpages. It's not an imageboard.  Break your flow? I don't see how clicking a simple link would do that. Perhaps we simply have differing methods when it comes to browsing. First, if you click on a link, it's not exactly hard to go back. Second, browser tabs exist. Personally, I usually scan for interesting looking links and middle click away. Then I can move through the tabs and close them as I go.  Are you really complaining about having to turn your eyes? Arbitrary maximum widths are dumb. This isn't a magazine, it's a browser. Also I feel I'd rather read a longer line of text than be forced to saccade to the beginning so often.  If you're really so interested there always being huge columns of text everywhere, than why not try simply shortening your window?  It sounds to me like you're simply nitpicking a lot of minor details. What you seem to mean isn't ""practical"" either. ""Aesthetics"" perhaps. Also, please don't mention facebook. I'd be hard pressed to find a more obnoxious layout than that one. Whitespace? I was not aware anyone was demanding more.  Besides your complaints about clicking links, and having to move your eyes to the right, I still don't see what the real problem is. The layout works and is easy to learn. Would you rather it be like an old fashioned forum bbs? Or maybe you'd rather it be like your aforementioned newspaper and have to submit your comments as an editorial?"
IgnorantImgur,3c0zl4,akcaye,4,Sun Jul 12 12:31:22 2015 UTC,"Your defending of the design is ridiculously zealous. Your arguments are all over the place. I don't even know what you're trying to say. I'll try to go random point by random point.   reddit mostly began as a way to share links to other webpages   Just because it is, doesn't mean it needs to be inconvenient. The fact that the images are stored somewhere else doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to see them on a single page. Imageboards are a completely different thing so I don't see their relevance to your argument.   Break your flow? I don't see how clicking a simple link would do that.   Well that's on you. When you go through a bunch of posts, going out of the page and into another and coming back is breaking your flow. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it isn't.   Second, browser tabs exist.   That's no excuse for bad design. RES also exists, which is why I finally joined Reddit, but that doesn't excuse Reddit needing it to be bearable.   ... middle click away. Then I can move through the tabs and close them as I go   You're entitled to your preference, but that's a shitty experience for someone who doesn't want chaos in their tabs. I usually have a dozen tabs other than Reddit open anyway, and I don't want to dedicate another window to Reddit.  Again, alternatives don't excuse bad design.   Are you really complaining about having to turn your eyes?   That's a ridiculous way to argue against design. That's like saying ""Why are you demanding at least 9pt font size? Are you really complaining about having to squint a little?""  I am complaining about overly long lines that make you more likely to lose your place when you get from line to line.   Arbitrary maximum widths are dumb.   Optimal, not arbitrary.   This isn't a magazine, it's a browser.   It has letters on it that you read. The problem is about reading, not paper.   saccade to the beginning so often.   It shouldn't be often. It should be optimal. Because unless you're conveniently only reading one-line comments, you are going to go to the beginning of the next line. And if that movement is too far, it's annoying.   why not try simply / shortening your window?   What you did with that sentence, breaking it so often--That's a nice strawman argument. Because I said you shouldn't have lines that go all the way across the screen, I must mean that I like reading four words a line, right? Well no, and I didn't argue that. That's what I said was shitty about the indentation of comments; you seem to have missed that.  About shortening my window: First, I shouldn't have to do that. A lot of Reddit content relies on videos and images, and I shouldn't have to change the fucking window size every time I go to the comments. Again, that's breaking flow. Not to mention insanely inconvenient.  Second, you can't narrow your window because eventually a couple of comments down a thread you will have five-character-long lines because the ridiculous indentation doesn't really give a shit about window size or resolution. So I don't even have that as an actual option. If I did, again, it wouldn't be an excuse for bad design.   nitpicking a lot of minor details.   You do that almost all the time with design. But this is barely minor.   What you seem to mean isn't ""practical"" either. ""Aesthetics"" perhaps.   No. The readability issue is about practicality. You're the one arguing against practicality, because in your opinion turning my eyes all over the screen and changing the window size all the time is perfectly normal. Well it isn't. What I'm arguning for is not having to do those, which is what I mean by practical. See, having a page with fixed width is practical.   please don't mention facebook. I'd be hard pressed to find a more obnoxious layout than that one.   You seem to have missed my point about Facebook completely. I didn't argue for its layout. I argued that your zealous defense of a very archaic website layout is akin to those who argue for Facebook staying intact: It's one more about familiarity than usability.   Besides your complaints about clicking links, and having to move your eyes to the right, I still don't see what the real problem is.   That's the whole damn site. Reading and browsing. What did you expect me to complain about regarding to Reddit, the fact that it doesn't cook?   Would you rather it be like an old fashioned forum bbs?   Yeah. Remember when I mentioned BBS forums were awesome? And I wanted old fashioned design? Me neither. Where did you come up with that? I'm saying that Reddit is the old fashioned site.   Or maybe you'd rather it be like your aforementioned newspaper and have to submit your comments as an editorial?   I guess that's what you go to when you don't know what to argue. Anyway. You asked why I don't like it, and you seem to have taken offense like you've designed it yourself. Well congrats, your design doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Reddit is a decade old and it already looks 20. Enjoy the '90s layout."
IgnorantImgur,3c0zl4,HitodamaKyrie,-1,Sun Jul 12 13:17:48 2015 UTC,"Haha, so I'm zealously defending am I? I don't feel any zeal for reddit. It's just a website I sometimes visit. I don't claim reddit's layout to be perfect. In fact, there are plenty of things I don't care for.  That said, I don't see how it's supposedly terrible. All the explanation I can find just mentions it being ""ugly"" or ""'90s"", which I feel are pretty poor justifications.  I asked why you didn't like it, and found your reasons strange. I suppose that encouraged me to poke fun at them. Links link. Comments follow the comments they respond to. The text formatting does nothing to trouble me. I don't see any problems with that. Seems it's simply a difference of taste.   When you go through a bunch of posts, going out of the page and into another and coming back is breaking your flow. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it isn't.   What breaks your flow and what breaks mine, don't have to be the same. I could say to the same effect that, just because you feel your flow is broken, doesn't mean it is."
