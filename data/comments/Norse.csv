Based on the Kaun (Ulcer) rune, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this is younger futhark (although that form of Kaun was showing up in the later years of the elder futhark). Because of that, the Uruz rune can be transliterated as u, v, w, y, o, and ø.  The unambiguous text we can translate is Th_r : _iki. I'm going to say that this is saying ""Thor Wiki"".  EDIT: Double-checking wikipedia, I guess Isaz can be either i or e. I'm only about 70% sure now."
Norse,3dyko7,crashonthebeat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:11 2015 UTC,I'm by no means knowledgeable in runic alphabets but Thor Wiki seems somewhat meaningless. Wouldn't the runes better be interpreted individually?

I can think of only a few transliterations to Old Norse:   þór vígi - Thor Stronghold/Fortress þór víg - Thor Fight/Battle þór vík - Thor Bay/Inlet þór vik - Thor Week   Using this as a dictionary  And this as my source for the younger futhark transliterations."

Norse,3duegw,Vantosh,5,Sun Jul 19 16:00:43 2015 UTC,"Here's a few tips if you decide to take the coastal route to Trondheim, via Ålesund. It's a longer trip (4 hours more, give or take), but takes you near some important historical locations from viking age Norway.  The Cultural History part of the University Museum of Bergen has a decent viking and some boat building exhibitions (.pdf warning).   Rosenkrantz Tower and Håkon's Hall near Bryggen in Bergen is worth a trip.  The burial mound of Haakon the Good is at Seim, a 10 minute detour from Knarvik. You'll drive  through Knarvik on the road from Bergen to Trondheim, less than an hour into your trip.  This site has lists of museums and attractions in Sogn & Fjordane, the county north of Bergen.   Selje Abbey is worth considering, if you have the time. Here's a timetable for the boat to the island. This is at least a four hour detour from the main Bergen-Ålesund-Trondheim routes.  The area around Ålesund has a long and rich history, here's a few locations I think might be most relevant for what you're after.  The Battle of Hjørungavåg and it's memorial.   Sunnmøre Museum in Borgundgavlen, Ålesund (Google Images), has a Medieval Museum (unfortunately, that building is closed for the 2015 season) as well as a huge open air museum and a cruciform church with walls built in the 1300s.   The island of Giske was (according to Snorre Sturlasson) the place where Harald Fairhair cut his hair after uniting Norway to one kingdom. It's a 15 minutes drive from Ålesund Center, via underwater tunnels. It has a church from the 12th century and a couple of bronze age grave mounds. A 5 minute detour once you get out of the tunnels will take you to Skjonghelleren, a cave used as a settlement in the early iron ages.   Ålesund town center is an attraction in itself, with it's Art Noveau buildings. About 850 of ~1100 houses burned to the ground in a fire in 1904. Reconstruction efforts were aided by Emperor Wilhem II of Prussia, who sent masons and architects as well as other aid, resulting in a compact cluster of Art Noveau buildings.  Other non-historical sites and sights you might consider on this route is the Briksdal Glacier near Olden, Hornindalsvatnet (Europe's deepest lake, 514m deep), the Geiranger fjord (a World Heritage site) and Trollstigen (Troll's Ascent, a beautiful mountain road that's closed most of the year). Further north, near Kristiansund, you have the awesome Atlantic Road, IIRC it's the second most visited tourist attraction in Norway.   Yeah, I got a bit carried away here. Have a nice trip, and drive safely."

There's a boat museum in Trondheim and a statue of Leiv Eriksson. In the marked place there is a statue of Olav Tryggvasson. And you can visit Lade to see the seat of the old jarls. The largest viking ship that was built, Ormen Lange, was built at Lade. There's an old stone church (One of the oldest in Norway) close to Lade gård. There's said to be remnants of an old temple at Ranheim, but I think it was demolished to build appartments. The science museum I mentioned above (Make sure you don't go to vitensenteret, that's a place for kids. Also fun, but no viking stuff.) has a special exhibition about some recent viking finds in Trøndelag. The area was important in the viking age.    As for Oslo, there you can see the only complete (And of the very few) viking helms found, the Gjermundbu helmet.

All that means is that this is how you pronounce these words in modern Swedish. The pronunciations are different in Proto-Norse, Old-Norse, English, Icelandic and probably countless other languages.  The reason a video like this is kind of pointless is because the correct pronunciation of a word varies from language to language, dialect to dialect, and even accent to accent.

Pronunciations from old Norse have changed dramatically in Scandinavia.. Icelandic is a lot closer but still not identical.  Someone might as well make a video saying ""This is how you pronounce Nordic Mythology names"" and just read what they see in a Texan accent..  It is pointless.  What she actually says in various parts of the video and comments is that she knows it is not accurate and that she is just trying to pronounce them in her accent, but that should be clarified in the misleading title."
Norse,3dwebh,SippantheSwede,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:03:39 2015 UTC,And even Old Norse had several dialects with pronunciations that were different enough to evolve into separate languages.

Edit:  I'm sorry to all of the Asatru practitioners, but if one of the world's leading experts on Viking history and culture thinks Asatru is a joke, then it probably is. If anything, /r/Norse should be a place where we can be honest about that. I'm tired of running into these people at PaganFest with their mjolnirs who claim to be Asatru but haven't read a single saga, either of the eddas, let alone a scholarly article on Viking excavations that could easily inform them of the accuracy of their attempt to follow the original way of the Viking people.

Basically less than 100 years old.   I wouldn't call it a joke, but the main branches are hardly anything like the little we know of the extremely non-centralized religions of the Vikings, and it's weird to state otherwise."
Norse,3dlbo0,tanketom,9,Fri Jul 17 08:21:02 2015 UTC,"I think the national-socialistic ""pagan"" uses runes etc. not so much as a sign of religion and more because the SS did it. As a political statement and not a religious expression. And I didn't said it wouldn't be a new religion. Sure, reconstruction is an interesting thing, but I never met or even heard of a pagan who claimed that ""the viking dudes did it 100% like this"". This is why it's also called Neopaganism. The Norse religion was very vague, non-centralized and probably changed even from generation to generation a bit. Neo-paganism is basically in the same situation. And it's definitely not just a counter-culture against Christianity. My experience is from the german scene, but here are at least as much pagans who wanted a nature-based religion in reaction to unsatisfying Atheism / Capitalism / Dogmatism in general / Technocratism etc. As an antipole or a calm anchor against the fast modern life. The priorities could be different in the US or in Scandinavia, though."
Norse,3dlbo0,NexusChummer,3,Fri Jul 17 09:06:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, the SS has a lot to do with it, of course. Thule Society and all that. The subreddit motto of ""Heil ok sæl!"" is actually a bit jarring to a lot of Norwegians, because that's what the Quisling party tried to use as the local version of ""Sieg heil!"" here when we were occupied during the World War II.  But I do wanna say that the early recreating and highlighting Norse ""ideals"" in Norway (and Scandinavia) started even before World War I – although not as much in terms of religion, more as ethics and romantic nationalism.  I might have gotten lost in translation, but I meant Judeo-Christianity as in an ethical value view, not Christianity as a religion in its own, so I agree with it being a counter against ""capitalist Western world"". But again, basically the same as Wicca – new-age but with a taste of Norse instead of Gaelic.  It might be slightly different to Germany, but there's absolutely a movement in the Scandinavian countries – albeit very small – to recreate it as closely as possible. They're called ""rekonstriksjonistisk"" here, but I can't seem to find a good translation of the term.  Quick edit: Vigrid is one Norwegian group who flirt heavily with Åsatru/Wotanism/Odinism, and is widely regarded as neo-nazi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigrid_(Norway), but the largest sanctioned Åsatru organizations are Bifrost and Forn Sed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopaganism_in_Scandinavia#Norway"

I am an English teacher   So, this makes you qualified to speak on new religious movements? I didn't realize that an a degree in English education also came with a doctorate in theology. I figured it was only for bad writers who couldn't actually get published. You learn something new every day.   I was recently communicating with the chair of the archeology department at the University of Uppsala, Sweden, and he told me that no one takes Asatru seriously in academia in Scandinavia.    Well, obviously that education didn't come with an understanding of logical fallacies, an appeal to authority in this case.   According to him, about 95% of Asatru is completely made up. Hardly any of it is based on real evidence of Viking practices via artifacts or literature.   Alright, let's actually get into the meat of your rather rude statement, shall we?  As proud as I am if my Swedish heritage, I am also keenly aware of the negative attitude that many Swedes have regarding religion in a country with one of the highest percentage of people self-reporting as atheist. Should it come as any surprise that contempt for new religious movements is as common as contempt for Christianity? Secondly, academia around the world is well known for a negative bias against religion and an even greater bias against ""neo-pagan"" beliefs. Third, the accusation is hinged on the Viking Age, which is a small period of time and limited to a specific set of peoples and there is simply more to Heathenry than that.  However, and as much as it pains me to say this, it's not completely inaccurate criticism because there are a lot, and I mean a lot, of people doing things that have no basis in fact-based reconstructive efforts. Much of the Tribalist segment has grown up because people are looking for something more authentic. There is a great deal of variety in the Germanic pagan revival. Some of that variety, especially from the earlier years, is directly derived from Wicca and Wiccan practices and shares its syncretic and mystical focus while being fairly lax on historical accuracy. However, to focus just on that instead of the rest of what is going on is to deliberately cherry pick the examples you want to work with in order to promote your derogatory statements. Additionally, so what if that is true? We aren't living then, we are living now. More importantly, we aren't seeking your permission to exist. We don't need your paternalistic condescension to do what we want to do. You clearly labor under the same misconception that a lot of ""Heathens"" do, and that what we are doing is replicating the Viking Age religion or that it is little more than historical reenactment.   I should also add that just because ""your friend"" is a professor of archeology doesn't mean he knows shit about shit when it comes to theology or modern religious movements. The opinion of someone who lives completely in the past, rooting around in graves, and working only with broken shards of a people as if their only real value is as an object in a display case is not exactly an opinion that has any merit or value to us. Still, the opinion of a professional grave robber is worth about as much as we paid for it. That is to say, nothing."

I specifically teach Beowulf (Anglo/Saxon work about the proto-Viking peoples) and The Saga of the Volsungs (A very old Norse saga that inspired Tolkien when he wrote LOTR) . Learning about the history and culture that influenced both works truly enriches one's understanding while reading.  Thanks to my passion about Norse literature. at one time I was truly motivated as to trying to live like these ancient people did, and see if I could find myself in their gods and their ways. I was actually interested in Asatru. That is what actually started me on writing to the academic authorities around the world, reading about modern knowledge of Norse religious practices, and contacting local Asatru followers--all to see if there really was any merit to a modern Heathen religion. Unfortunately, I was quickly discouraged.  The professors that did write back to me informed me that there really is no way to recreate or revive an authentic Norse religion, and that those who attempt it, like Asatru, have to resort to filling in countless gaps by inventing material or borrowing from other religions, which of course explains why academics don't see any merit in it.  My own studies revealed that it was literally impossible to even try, as archeological records and historical documents have revealed very clearly that religious practice before and during Viking times was extremely variant from region to region, tribe to tribe, and neighbor to neighbor. One would have to pick and choose and also full in the missing links as stated above.  Now, as for meeting local Asatru practitioners, maybe my sample size was too small (I'm willing to admit that), but the Asatru practitioners I met in several different arenas (metal shows, Renaissance festivals, book stores, etc.) claimed to be ""true Viking"" with Amon Amarth shirts and giant mjolnirs around their necks, claiming to worship the Norse gods and live exactly as the Vikings did, all while displaying total ignorance when questioned about historical/cultural facts or Norse literature. It was extremely off-putting. I expected these people to be the above-all experts, but clearly even an amateur like me felt superior to these people when it came to simple knowledge about Norse/Germanic/Scandinavian/Viking facts. It enraged me that these idiots did not even taken the time to research what they were doing, but instead trusted the ceremony instructions they are following from the Internet or out of a book they got at Barnes and Noble in the ""New Age"" section. Unfortunately, I have never met an Asatru follower who was not like this. I wish my experience were different.   I have read everything I could ever get my hands on regarding Germanic/Norse/Scandinavian/Viking history, culture, art, and literature, and anyone who has done the same would feel like I did when hearing about someone worried they will offend Asatru practitioners by wearing a mjolnir.

No, it wasn't, and I'm certain you've become aware of it.   So to be honest I can blame you. You claim to be a teacher, and you sadly influence the mind of the children or even adults you teach.

Norse,3crgf4,Ratatoskr-,2,Fri Jul 10 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"I personally think comparing Santiago de Compostela(St. James, the Decomposed) to Njörðr, the underworld, and twins within Norse religion is an a good example of how calling something pagan within the Christian pantheon, and thus not Christian, is almost pointless in this context; if I were to reference the goddess Priya and associate those stories with my own love for Freya would I not be a ""true"" believer because I see a similarity in how two languages idealize those similar spiritual concepts? Thankfully the diverse Norse pantheon is more forgiving than the pandemonium required for saints within Christian monotheism. Obviously there are pagan roots in Christianity, this is why they were demonized and labeled as pagan, but not many would like to accept how long this gradual process of transformation takes. There are still conflicts like this to this day as forms of Christianity are practiced alongside spells and incantations from ancient religions(Christmas in Lithuania, which resisted the influence of Christianity officially for an extremely long time)."

Norse,3crgf4,BoozeFighter,2,Fri Jul 10 11:26:19 2015 UTC,That's because you can't make a link and a text post at the same time. It has to be one or the other.
Norse,3crgf4,Kyranian,2,Fri Jul 10 12:21:17 2015 UTC,"Ya, one of my friends just got done explaining that to me. Thank you though."
Norse,3crgf4,Kyranian,2,Fri Jul 10 22:48:32 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone. Sorry this caused such an uproar. It was not my intention to offend or attack anyone's faith or culture. I promise I'm not just a troll trying to cause problems. So to clarify why I made this and why I posted this let me do a little explaining. To begin with I have a great interest and respect for Norse culture and religion. The inspiration behind starting this was I thought that Mjolnir would fit perfectly on top of an Irminsul which would happen to make it a cruciform. In other words, my goal wasn't to make a christian cross. I thought I was just putting symbols together in the same way bindrunes are made. Maybe I was wrong to do this but that's really for you to decide for yourselves I suppose. To my understanding Irminsul is considered by some to be the Saxon version of Yggdrasil. As I'm sure many of you are already familiar with the story of how Odin, who by sacrificing himself on Yggdrasil, gained wisdom and knowledge of the ruins I won't tell the whole story here but what I want to state is that when I see this image it means more to me than the symbols do separately. To me it represents the moment the runes gave up their secrets to him. It represents how all things are connected and feed into each other and the center of it all is Irminsul/Yggdrasil. To me Mjolnir is a symbol of strength and protection so I thought it would be appropriate as a base. I thought the Web of Wyrd could emphasis the meaning behind Irminsul, etc. etc. The bottom line is. I wasn't trying to offend anyone. I wasn't try to steal anyone's culture or religion. I wasn't making a Christian cross. And lastly the only reason I even made a reddit and bothered posting this image was my roommate, who by the way is also Asatruar, told me that I should share this here. So if anyone has anymore questions, concerns, or suggestions I'd be happy to address any and all of them. Until then Gæð a wyrd swa hio scel."
Norse,3crgf4,Kyranian,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:42:25 2015 UTC,"Completely different attitude in comments now compared to before when I saw you originally post this. I think saying the symbols should not be conflated or this is in some way silly ignores the fact it is knowingly art. There are many Norse-Christian symbols that arose after their ideas spread, and their ideas are indeed still spreading. Additionally there are Norse symbols which include crosses, and those which include other symbols within themselves, so I don't get what is so taboo or gaudy. Completely valid to say that perhaps there are too many symbols here, but I think you should continue doing art like this if it interests you or other people.  Edit: Apparently saying there are different perspectives in the world and people should not feel stifled is worthy of down-voting. Now I know how the OP feels. Not welcome, thanks /r/Norse"
Norse,3crgf4,Kyranian,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:46:09 2015 UTC,"I also said that the symbol is easily identified as Christian so I understand, although crosses are depicted in almost every single ancient religion in the world(Europe notably), and there are many theorized pagan origins to the cross. Your perspective is much more valid within the faith sure, I was saying that there are other perspectives. It is symbol and I have found in the area of comparative philology the meaning of ideas goes through many shifts and it isn't as conservative as I think you would like to believe. I agree that unity for each concept is important, but just because someone else puts them together doesn't mean those concepts are lost on them. I had the same impression upon looking at the symbol as you, as I said before it is a valid criticism, but being of your faith to say someone else's interpretation from the outside is marginalizing, satirizing, gaudy, silly, is an insular statement. Unfortunately there are many parts of history where Norse-Christian culture is a thing since their culture spread. To me, in studying comparative context, this is interesting if not fascinating. Since you remain inside the culture, I understand this seems insulting to your faith, so I am sorry, but there is a lot of value in understanding what meaning modern people ascribe to various symbols inside or outside the faith."
Norse,3crgf4,Kyranian,0,Fri Jul 10 19:47:34 2015 UTC,"I said nothing about your ideology, I said that crosses have existed before, during and after the marked histories of these religions(Norse/Christian). I also said that I see it as easily identified as similar to the Christian cross. I do not like you implying that I am stuck, closed off, or unable to understand the core issue. I already said I understand you are offended by the use, and you ignored it so again I am sorry if what I say is offensive. My mindset is that I think your opinion is interesting, as well as his art, and I think by alienating someone who shows potential interest in your culture you are doing it a disservice. If you think he's a neo-nazi or a theif, or troll, then I cannot change that, maybe he is. I am not talking about any of those subjects, that is your interpretation of his art. I simply said that if you analyze it outside of the insular context it can still have meaning to people, even if it doesn't to you. If anyone who uses a symbol with their own perception is a thief than I would not like to be an artist."

I had to do that once when I was trying to book a stay at a popular place; they were booked solid online (none of the dates i tried worked) and I called to see when the soonest I could get in would be. It turned out they were fully booked for the rest of the year and told me to call back January 2nd."

Here is a quick summary:  -Poetic-  *CRAWFORD: Nice modern English translation, very readable, but lacks contextual foot notes and a glossary/index  *BRAY: Older English, poetic rather than literal translation, great intro and illustrations. the best part is that you get the text side-by-side with Old Norse.  *HOLLANDER: More of an artistic translation (accuracy is compromised). Some key writings are omitted (Volundarkvida). One of the weaker translations for academics, but good for the layman in my opinion.  *BELLOWS: Older English, but easy to read. Thin intro, but comprehensive index. It's the most common edition, found for free online (http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/index.htm). It's the yard-stick that other translations are compared to.  *LARINGTON: One of the better translations. Solid intro, highly readable, great context notes, and glossary. Probably the edition I'd recommend as your first copy.  *VALKAUSKAS: If you want the Eddas in flowing narrative rather than poetry, this is the version for you. It's also fully illustrated with brand new devotional artwork. (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/avalkauskas/the-illuminated-edda/description)  *DRONKE: I've heard great things about this one, but I don't own it, so I cannot comment. Larrington was her student, so I'll assume that both would have a similar approach.  -Prose-  *FAULKES: This is the most popular one, and is probably the best known. Easy to find in print and in digital form. Easy to read, complete and pocket sized. I've read this book over a hundred times.  *ANDERSON: A more structured version than that of FAULKES. You can also get it for free digitally (http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18947/18947-h/18947-h.htm)  *BRODEUR: IIRC probably the most modern translation out of the three.

Anthony Faulke's ""Edda"" is similarly well noted and well written.  Jackson Crawford's recent version of the Poetic Edda keeps much of the original meaning of the words, but uses very simple accessible language. It's not something you're likely to want to quote.. and it basically removes all of the ""Poetic"" from the name - but it is good for people who have no interest in Shakespearean language - but an interest in the subject matter.

Norse,3bwive,shikitohno,5,Thu Jul 2 19:00:11 2015 UTC,"Skipta's not a bad choice, considering it's a  cognate of skift, and etymologically related.  Was that intentional, or just lucky coincidence?"

Norse,3a9x8m,ihorse,5,Thu Jun 18 13:24:14 2015 UTC,"Hindus see their various gods as ""avatars"".  They're not gods in their own right, but expressions or representations of certain aspects of the Divine Godhood/Ultimate Reality.  The difference between sects is in which ""god"" they consider the most divine form.  This is usually between Krishna or Shiva, but each are ultimately just expressions of the knowable form of Brahman.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman"
Norse,3a9x8m,ihorse,5,Thu Jun 18 14:14:15 2015 UTC,"but each are ultimately just expressions of the knowable form of Brahman.   ..and in turn, Brahman is not a single entity but it is reality, which makes it more akin to pantheism.   The trouble however is that it ultimately depends on the Hindu in question how far they are willing to go with this story. Lots of Hindu's do actually believe in literal Gods.   To see the essence as Hiduism as being about monotheism is a rather Abrahimicentric view on advanced Brahmanic Philosophy, which is not 'Hiduism'. Bakhti movements are way more popular.  Now to actually answer the question, it is very difficult to pinpoint what of Hidiums might'e been shared with the other proto-Indoeuropean religions. Thing is, even if we do look back to the period where there were actual worshippers of 'The Old Pagan Gods' (Roman & Viking era) Hiduism was already going through it's own changes for hundreds of years. Pretty sure the caste system Hindu and not Germanic, and that has been around for a long time. The philosophy you menation is also recorded at a later date than the split, though it might have been passed around orally. But for how long? Impossible to tell I guess.

This is true, but is rather panentheism since pantheism equates the cosmos, i.e. space-time, with the Divine (in this case Brahman) and fails to take into consideration the transcendent dimension, that which is beyond time. Or as the famous Hindu scholar of the 20th century Ananda Coomaraswamy had it:   To say that “I am a pantheist” is merely to confess that “I am not a metaphysician,” just as to say that “two and two make five” would be to confess “I am not a mathematician.”"

Writting in runes doesn't show anything about your religion.  Now for religion. In many ways you could say that the scandinavians never stopped worshiping their old gods. Instead there where a slow shift, where the old gods moved more into the background.  The old norse faith was never organised in the same way that many modern religions are. They did not have a holy book or a common and uniform practise all over the scandinavian world. You didn't gather in prayer to Odin once a week. Instead you called upon different gods when you had a hard time or something important happened. Think on it more like folklore than organised religion.  Christianity with its organisation and dogmas could slowly, but surely push the old faith into the background over hundred of years. And it litteraly took hundreds of years. As an example Denmark was declared christian in around 960, but the last victory dedicated to Odin was in 1208. That is almost 250 years. It is longer than the united states have existed as a nation. We actuelly have documentation of people in Gotland who could not write or read, but still told tale of Old Odin in the 19th century.   Scandinavia today still celebrates many holidays other western countries doesn't - like summer solstice - and have many traditions and stories you can easy trace back to the old religion also many cities and landmarks are named after the old gods."

The other bridge have other name, I just don't have their name on top of my head...   which would still kind of put Asgard into the confines of our universe   The Norse didn't have the same conception of universe than us.  Remember, all those different world where part of the world tree, Yggdrasil, that was for them the universe.  And I believe that from some of the Norse Yggdrasil was a real physical tree (from which Odin could hang himself) that if you were to travel to the middle of Midgard you could find.  from that point on, could you scale the tree and reach other worlds?  May be, I don't know.  I don't recall hearing any story about such a feat being done or attempted.   (Once again, not an expert... just an amateur)."
Norse,3a3rbp,Odinist9,2,Wed Jun 17 12:21:04 2015 UTC,"I give it the point that for many ancient cultures, ""upwards"" and ""downwards"" were considered to be seperate worlds, because travel in those directions were limited in the same fashion as we would today speak of travelling along the 5th dimension or other higher dimensional orders.  So that is really a ""borderline case"", I give you that - we would call it the same universe, but because of the fundamentally different ""perspective"" on the world that ancient cultures had, it is really a different universe to them.   Travel along the horizontal plane of the earth, however, should have been pretty forward and understandable to the ancients in the same way it is to us today.   So, the idea that the world tree (which must have been enormous in people's minds) did really exist in a physical, tangible form is a very interesting aspect.  So essentially, even if no legend tells of a human scaling, or even finding, the tree, this would provide the answer to the envisioned cosmology - all the worlds were like planets in a vast encompassing sky which seperated them, with only Yggdrasil serving as the only material connection between them, making travel between them impossible by mundane means available at the time.   That is very interesting. So a Norse could never have, say, upon reaching America, come to the conclusion that he would be stepping onto Asgard. Nor reached the north pole and assumed it to be Hel. All these place would, even without more detailed knowledge of their position and nature, have been understood by the Norse to be places within Midgard, correct?   As for the snake circling Midgard, we learn from it that Midgard was envisioned as landmass rimmed by ocean (a recurring theme that we also see in Greek mythology).    I suppose that the presence of the snake is a strong indicator that even if one would surmount the snake somehow (by climbing over its' tailtip or whatnot, the Norse heroes were very heroic and daring), further travel in the same direction would not bring you to other worlds, but you would simply plunge off the world into the sky above and below and around it.   Is it known if the Norse saw the world as a flat ""pizza""? Or did they see it as a sphere?"
Norse,3a3rbp,Odinist9,2,Wed Jun 17 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"Also, in the Prose Edda, the Bifrost is called ""a burning rainbow bridge"" which sounds a lot a rocket ship with a lot of colors flashing taking off might have looked like to our ancestors. Bil in Old Norse means ""a momemt"" and an Old Norse verb bifa means ""to shake"" are both found in different mentions of the Bifrost at various places across the Germanic lands.

Norse,3a4095,TehKookinator,2,Wed Jun 17 19:54:19 2015 UTC,"Hey there folks!  I saw that my post was linked on here, and I wanted to add a few thoughts. Yes, Thor Heyerdahl did propose such a hypothesis, and even wrote a book about it ""The Search for Odin.""  I have read gist translations of it (It is in Norwegian), and in my opinion it is a bit on the pseudo-archaeological side of things. Several scholars have posited such an idea, and some of them well before Heyerdahl. I believe the Laing Heimskringla translation is one of them. Generally such hypothesis are dismissed as being too literal, as we are talking about mythical narratives, not historic accounts per se.    Here is what we do know about any historical Odin. Yes, there are plenty of men who have had that name, and several lines of kings have traced their lines to men by the name of Odin, Woden, ect in the Domesday Book and the Heimskringla.   We cannot say if they took their name from the god, of if one of these men might have been the inspiration for the god of the same name. I would lean towards the former.  Because, to the original question, that is the nature of story telling. It is possible that the Aesir-Vanir War is a cultural memory, but it is equally possible it is a bit of poetic flourish. Most of these stories were told orally before finally being written down ca. the 13th century. Being a story teller myself, I can tell you that we often take liberties...     At the end of the day, we just can't say for sure."

The Aesir, the Vanir and the Jotunn for the Norse, the Fomorii and the Tuatha De for the Celts, the Olympians and the Titans... It could possibly be a hold over from an earlier time.  Besides, the Indo-Europeans were conquerors. They literally swept across Europe and conquered a lot of people that were there before. It would not surprise me at all if such events were remembered in song and story, as the Norse had a habit of doing."

I'm not trying to be one of those ""this religion has homework we are so hardcore read the fucking lore noob"" people. But if you believe the runes have power, you should believe that using them incorrectly can cause bad things to happen. So it's important to know how they work and make sure you're using them correctly. Understanding that they all have multiple meanings and they can be tricky.  If you don't believe the runes have power, then, you know, feel free to stick them together randomly."

Norse,37q3df,OhThatNeal,9,Sat May 30 01:09:31 2015 UTC,"Well you could compare it a bit.   Take the old norse verb ""to be""  ""vera"".  In elfdalian it is ""wårå"". You can see the same development as my Norwegian dialect where it is ""vårå"". Standard Swedish is ""vara"" or ""va"". So it is in many Norwegian dialects just over the border. Icelandic has ""vera"" and danish has ""være"".  The personal pronoun ""I"" is ""ig"". Quite different from the the Swedish ""jag"". Looks almost west norse, like Norwegian eg, æg, eig, i, e æ, etc. This goes back to the east-west norse split. ""ek-jak"".  Verbs are conjugated in in person, but only the plural. ""you shall, we shall, they shall"" and lacks the singular forma like norse ""tu skalt, ek skal"". I can't look up the exact forms right now. Other dialects with this are the norwegian dialects in Telemark-Hallingdal-Numedal and areas around, and standard danish and swedish kept it in use until a hundred years ago or such. They are kinda like english and has the difference between singular and plural. ""me era"" or ""vi ero"" = ""we are""Icelandic has the entire system preserved. Also in Voss you could a hundred hears ago still find some who preserved the second person conjugation ""du skalt"" = ""thou shalt"".  It has the dative case, and traditionally also genitive and accusative, though the paper I read said that they were more or less forgoten. If you say they have them though, they would be the only language on mainland scandinavia with them. Dative is common though, both in Sweden and Norway.  Phonologically it has most of new developments of other dialects in the area. It has the thick-L/retroflex flap (but only from norse L, not from rd as some others). In adotion it shifts around on diphtongs. ""heim"" becomes ""hiem"", which then also drops the H and becomes ""iem"" is a good excample of that. In that sense most other north swedish and Norwegian dialects are more archaic.  It has perserved nasal vowels though, which as far as I know only one other dialect has. The Norwegian dialect in Selbu.  The archaic nature is mostly in the grammar, but the phonologic developments are really interesting."

Roland Warzecha is well known and respected in the historical fencing world (from what I could tell) so, his conclusion based on speculation are not just out of the blue; they came form practice and experimentation.  The design of a sword tell you a lot about what works.  Things on a weapon don't tend to be arbitrary; your life depends on it, it's no time for silliness.  And if something works today, if a better technique can be discovered through experimentation, it probably worked at the time and as probably been found by the original user of the weapon.  This shirt though..."
Norse,37i1dx,MaxBoivin,2,Thu May 28 12:32:10 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that the design of a weapon can teach you a great deal about its use, but you have to be rigorous, and his presentation here (maybe it's an abridged version of a more detailed report elsewhere, but taken in isolation) is insufficiently rigorous.   Firstly, you have to be very cautious when using biomechanics as a tool because our biomechanics, and theirs, are almost certainly very different. Yes, modern man and Viking man have the same musculature etc, but a man who has been raised on a pre-modern diet and performed hard labour since he was a child - rowing, working the soil, and training for combat - will be capable of using tools in a very different way to a modern man, even a wiry athletic man by modern standards.  Secondly the you have to make sure that the criteria you judge the tools on are actually sensible ones. Maybe the hammer grip is less efficient at transferring force down the arm, but maybe that's not the thing that mattered in Viking-style combat - neither one can transmit enough force to go through mail and both are sufficient to inflict wounds on the neck and limbs, so maybe there are other factors at work. I'm not actually saying they didn't use the handshake grip, they may have, but I'm arguing his work is very highly speculative.  Thirdly, if you're going to be talking about biomechanics you need to make sure you have got very accurate replicas of contemporary tools, and that replica of a Carolingian shield is ridiculous. Nothing like that has ever been found and there's a lot of reason to think that was just a stylisation of either large flat or large lenticular shields, the latter of which certainly do behave differently in combat to the former but not so differently that you would suddenly adapt your martial training to rely on blade binds. He doesn't show any manuscript evidence that depicts Vikings and Franks bearing consistently different wargear.  Fourthly, he is (again, here) basing his supposition off 2 artefacts. Even if they could be dated to before and after 845 with any degree of precision, you'd need to be demonstrating a consistent trend in sword design, which you can't do with 2 swords.   And fifthly, as I said above, his reconstruction of large flat shield combat leaves a lot to be desired. It's slow, clumsy, wearing on the arms, leaves huge openings, and (not that it's particularly relevant) looks completely freaking ridiculous."
Norse,37i1dx,Haereticus,5,Thu May 28 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"My impression of this would be to take it with a heavy pinch of salt. There's no good evidence of a sudden shift in fighting style in the mid 9th century, and their reconstruction of a Frankish lenticular shield is over-literal. When he says the Danes were 'still' using flat shields in 845 there's no reason to think that this technology was outdated or that they stopped any time before the introduction of kite shields. Their reconstruction of flat shield combat is also highly speculative and in my opinion, looks really silly. I would be extremely interested in fighting someone who expected both combatants to engage in this kind of flapping around, because I suspect they would be extremely susceptible to the solid guards and rapid feints of the fighting styles that prioritise economy of movement."

It won't mean ""Lord"" or ""Kin"" in Norse.. only English.  Likely you might even be using 2 or 3 runes in total in genuine rune text.  The problem here is that people spend a lot of time and money studying ancient language, and that is how they make some of those college fees back (and a living).  So you're not likely to find answers to questions like this generally - however I think you can probably find close equivalents as they are two simple words - what you might want to do is find the old Norse words and translate those into their runic sounds.  Scroll down on this page for the Lords Prayer for example: http://www.omniglot.com/writing/runic.htm  It's when people come in asking ""How do I write ""existential"" in Norse"" you have to facepalm."

Imagine a Norwegian with a potato caught in his throat - that's Danish. You're right that Norwegian is the best ""bridge"" between the three.  As a native English speaker, Norwegian is going to be slightly easier for you to learn than Swedish grammar and pronunciation-wise.  Also...if you're going for mutual intelligibility, learn Norwegian Bokmål and not Nynorsk.

I mean yes it is still buggy as hell, the graphics are outdated, no voice acting, and the AI is kinda wonky. But at it's heart! The whole concept of having your own hird with it's own ships that you can move across Britannia, Norway, Denmark and Frisia fighting other kings, jarls and making a name for yourself in the service of any of the players. I also LOVE the accuracy in portrayal of the time period. The clothing (besides there being purple and black dyes that were not yet available at that time), the weapons, the armor, the display of their life and homes, and the ships! The game really shows the Viking Age very authentically that I would back it up as being a good educational tool.   My wish is that whole game is re hauled because if it had:    Skyrim like graphics macro-game AI like Crusader Kings II a better functioning battlefield AI allowing for proper shield walls and boar-snouts formations ship battles that work more like Assassins Creed Black-Flag more areas to explore, trade with, fight, plunder, and conquer including Sweden, France, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic Countries, and possibly Byzantium as well as the Middle East! The ability to not crash all the time Included modding ability to allow for people to import their own skins and such.   That game would be the best game ever!"

Norse,35wlba,Sinpwnzorz,4,Thu May 14 02:53:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about norse language (yet), but I do speak Norwegian. Unlike English, it is perfectly acceptable to make up your own word by combining them. Actually, not combining words is the wrong way. For instance, you should say ""treefeller"", not ""tree-feller"" or ""feller of trees"". The ""thing"" (tree) should come first, and the ""action"" (destroyer) last.   Then again, modern Norwegian does not use kasus tenses as the Old Norse and German languages do. I understand that in ON the tense of the word indicates its meaning, not the placement in the sentence. So any three words could be shuffled around and still make up the same sentence/meaning. Bu listen to more practiced folks on this point :)   I would love to see a picture of the axe!"
Norse,35wlba,dragonburrito,1 point,Thu May 14 14:36:26 2015 UTC,"I see. So I could use any on of the three words listed that mean tree as a pronoun to a verb of sorts? I had a hell of a time coming up with a word for ""feller"" because every Norse language website I've read doesn't really have a word for that.  I was trying to go for something less warrior related (destroyer) but I spent a few hours going through their words and nothing decent came to mind.  farbjodreik (farb jo dreck) Is technically correct? I don't have the fancy keyboard buttons. I am also (Probably wrongly) pronouncing them in English  I plan to post pictures of the axe along with the construction process from scratch in an attempt to earn fake internet points."
Norse,35wlba,dragonburrito,3,Fri May 15 05:40:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Not sure. To my modern Norwegian ear that sounds like the Eik is the Destroyer. I'd rather put the words the other way around, i.e.  Eikfjarbodr.  But! I have a suggestion: Eikhogg, or possibly Eikhoggr (male). Oak-striker. Google translates hogg to ""hew"", but it is a much more awesome word than that. It is the word for chopping into wood, also for the strike of a snake or with a sword. Both words are still in use in Norwegian and Icelandic, unlike farbjodr that I've never heard before. You may rekcognise hogg from the name Nighogg. Pronounce it like a short bark, with the o sounding like the vocal in lawn. It should sound like it wants to take a bite out of someone ;) A bit more aggressive than this, but not as computer-staccato as this (click on the volume symbol to listen).  edit: early morning typo galore.  edit again: found this dictionary for you!"
Norse,35wlba,dragonburrito,3,Fri May 15 06:39:22 2015 UTC,"I both like and appreciate your suggestion. That to date is the best sounding both vocally and definition wise word.  The reason I am building this project is because the fella that wants me to make it is a 6'7 super sayian with more or less viking lineage. He's bought 'felling axes' and most of them are 5-8 pounds. He wants one 15-20 pounds. And rather than most axe / hammer heads being put over a handle and split to be held on he wants it on a pickaxe style handle so you insert the handle from the bottom and as you swing it stays tight.

Norse,35wlba,Voreshem,3,Sun May 17 05:00:39 2015 UTC,"From what I've been able to tell, it's pretty similar to the other Germanic words in that you'd strong them together in a way that sounds natural.   In German, my favorite word is Honigkuchenpferd, which means ""Honey cake horse"". It's actually a term of endearment, like ""darling"". Honig=honey, Kuchen=cake, Pferd=horse.  I would assume it would be relatively similar in other Germanic languages. But then, I don't speak Swedish, Norwegian, or Icelandic."
Norse,35wlba,Strid,2,Thu May 14 04:44:08 2015 UTC,"So, in Modern Swedish, as in Norwegian and Old Norse, oftentimes the genitive case of the word, akin to the english <word+'s> is used when creating compound words. So, let's take ""tree death"" because it's easier, this should be rendered ""trésdauði"", literally ""tree's death"". There are probably way better name choices, for this is just an example of how this works.  This example from Wikipedia.  The genitive is used partitively, and quite often in compounds and kennings (e.g.: Urðarbrunnr, the well of Urðr; Lokasenna, the gibing of Loki)."

He is behind the wheel of ""Draken Harald Hårfagre"", the largest viking ship ever built in modern times. It is a copy of the longships of the viking age.   Now him and his crew are doing what Leiv Eriksson did one thousand years ago, sailing the old viking route to America via Iceland and Greenland.    The journey is planned to take one month. They will leave shore in Haugesund, Norway, around May 1st 2016. The journey will take them past the Shetlands and the Faeroe Islands before they land on Iceland. Then an eleven days journey awaits to take them to Greenland, before they reach Newfoundland around June 1st. The timing has been carefully chosen to make the best of weather, wind and wind direction, and safety has the highest priority for the crew of 32 sailors.  The first permanent stop in the US will be The Great Lakes. The Drake will remain here for the entire summer of 2016.   We are going to show the Norwegian tradition for boat building, and demonstrate how the vikings may have sailed around there hundreds of years before Leiv Eriksson. There are many of Scandinavian descent in the areas around the Great Lakes. And the general interest for the Viking era is significant in the USA, Ahlander says.   The journey continues to New York in the fall of 2016.   It is going to be exciting to show off the Drake, unless we disappear among all the skyscrapers, Ahlander says.    The plan is for the Drake to winter in the States.   edit: typos, added reference to comment below."
Norse,35m3ln,Strid,0,Mon May 11 17:14:27 2015 UTC,"Just a quick correction, google translate often makes errors: Vinland doesn't mean ""wine land"", the ""vin"" means meadows/plains."
Norse,35m3ln,thylacine_pouch,5,Mon May 11 19:46:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I knew that would gnaw at someone. Debates are still on about how ""vin"" should be translated. It seems the meaning ""field"" was mostly used to denote farmsteads, not large pieces of land. Also, by the time of the Vikings this meaning of the word was discontinued. For instance, it was not carried on into Icelandic place-naming.   edit: Oh, just remembered now. Vinland is first mentioned by Adam of Bremen, who explicitly states that it is named so for the excellent wine procured from the grapes (i.e., currants) that grow there.  I am a plant-seer, and have chosen to interpret it as wine (=vin in my native tongue) given by the plant Ribes aureum, the golden currant native to harsh Canadian climates. The making of currant wine is an old tradition in my parts, so the lack of Vitis vinifera at the latitudes of Eriksson is of no concern to me."

Unless you are worthy of them. Else why seperate the afterlife of mankind into different realms?   I heard all that stuff about preparing for the zombie fire apocalypse had something to do with it.

Norse,35k1z7,Volsunga,5,Mon May 11 03:27:54 2015 UTC,"By not immediately taking retribution, he forfeited that right to the state. In the old times, it was the local chief/Jarl/King, but now it's the legal system. With regards to Norse religion, he should treat it with the same respect. The blood debt was paid on his behalf by the state by putting the criminal in prison and he is released from any duty of vengeance. Trying to seek his own justice after justice has already been dealt by a higher power is a violation of his duty. There's nothing in historical Norse religion preventing marriage when a blood debt is unpaid, however there are stories of people taking personal oaths to never marry until vengeance for their family is settled. If he did such a thing after it was settled by the state, he has greatly disrespected the gods in taking a sacred oath to violate his duty.   Your friend needs medical help. That should be his first priority. He is dangerous to himself and others."
Norse,35k1z7,LaV-Man,4,Mon May 11 14:21:24 2015 UTC,"If you read the sagas and Eddas with a bit of context I think you might see the solution.  In the stories conformity with the government/laws of the time was not really a virtue but breaking the laws or defying the government (local/regional royalty) was seriously frowned upon.  The storys extol working within the system of government and 'being a good citizen'.  Had they happened today I doubt the same eddicts about revenge killings and fueds be in there.  If this happened 'back in the day' the equivelant of the guy being caught and sent to prison would have been him being handed over to the husband for 'processing'.  Ergo, the modern equivelant of the needed outcome has happened.  Disclaimer: This is all subject to a wiser/more knowledgable persons review; it's just my opinion."

That meant that if a person committed murder, they would have to pay (literally, like with money and stuff).  In fact, they would go to court over it, much like we do today.  At the Althing, men would summon each other, state their complaints, and have the case be judged.  There were even lawyers.  The biggest difference between then and now is that the execution of the punishment was to be carried out by the victim/their family.  Today, we have a penal system that does that for us.  TL;DR Norse cultures didn't go around killing everyone for revenge.  Your friend lives in a modern society and must abide by its rules.  Also, he should seek professional help.  edit: grammar"

It always has been. You seem to be approaching this from an ""It is law, so it must be right"" point of view and that is naive and remarkably passive for a heathen.  Fear of the law is like medieval fear of a Christian God.   Fear to control.  Your mention of rapists and child predators deserving death, makes me think you are female - as you are projecting hatred on what you consider to be male dominated crimes (aka to distance death penalties from yourself as much as possible); when violent abuse of children is most often by single mothers - and infanticide is a female-lead sport - yet you think these not more severe crimes?

Guessing that Loki had something to do with Sif's loss of hair, Thor angrily demanded that Loki restore her golden locks. The scared Loki contacted two dwarfish craftsmen, Brokk and Eitri (who would later create Thor's hammer Mjolnir), and asked them to create new hair for Sif. Loki was either unable, or unwilling, to pay the dwarfs enough gold to create golden hair. The dwarfs decided that ""for the price of naught"" they would make ""strands of naught."" The dwarfs created magical strands of hair from the blackness of the night. The strands of darkness took root the moment they were placed on Sif's head, and then began to grow out. Thor found that Sif's new black tresses made her even more attractive, disrupting Loki's plan to ruin their relationship.""  Marvel likes to do their own take on the myths."

Norse,34z0h0,Baabaaer,3,Wed May 6 06:30:04 2015 UTC,One slight problem. It is forbidden to depict him.  There have been a series of murders and attempted murders this century against people trying.  http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/draw-muhammad-shooting-who-was-behind-cartoon-contest-n353081
Norse,34z0h0,Markofdawn,3,Wed May 6 13:14:55 2015 UTC,"As a Muslim, I am aware and very much hate the murderers, even more than I am angry at the depictors. It's their freedom of speech, I'm afraid. But I don't want to derail the topic, so let's just keep the topic on history figures to be adapted as superheroes.  What I am trying to say is, some franchise can't adapt some real-life people as heroes as well as others. Marvel and DC often makes or employs real-life people who are still alive in their stories. You proposed Muhammad, possibly in jest, but he is already dead for 13 centuries, so Marvel had to invent some excuse on how he is still alive, which may not mesh well with the established canon.  Marvel can also freely employ other people named Muhammad, such as Muhammad Ali the boxer, or Muhammad bin Muhammad, also known as Imam as-Syafi'i. The trick is to put two names, to differentiate from the one not to be depicted.  Nasuverse however, does have mechanisms to 'resurrect' dead people as characters in their present there. So, that is why I suggest Muhammad s.a.w as a Heroic Spirit. After all, the ban to depict him can also be his Noble Phantasm.  If we want Ragnar Lothbrok to be Marvel superhero, he has to be someone taking up the mantle, or having some phlebtonium(?) to keep him around. Marvel can make the backstory as they please, but it's best to keep to the canon. Nasuverse is already notorious with adapting as they please, so to have them keep to the canon is futile."

A character name can be a trademarked name, but Thor and Mjolnir can't be. Those names appear in works far too old to have any remaining intellectual property rights attached to them. The works themselves are no longer under copyright, and since the character names from the works are so well known and known to be from those works, nobody can legitimately claim to own them."

Norse,34qbfi,Ratatoskr-,1 point,Mon May 11 19:08:45 2015 UTC,I agree that it is a symbol connected to Odin. But I don't think you can say it is a symbol of devotion to Odin.    that it is a symbol of devotion to Odin.  Not a good thing if you're not a poet or king.   Why?
Norse,34qbfi,LaV-Man,1 point,Mon May 11 19:48:38 2015 UTC,IMO: Odin's attention is not something you'd want unless it's for a good reason.    It's like (pardon the military reference) drawing attention to yourself on the battle field.    tl;dr Odin's attention is a dangerous thing.

Norse,34qnni,izwald88,3,Wed May 6 07:33:59 2015 UTC,"Sure, I'm just pointing out that getting tattoos with Norse imagery is somewhat taboo due to the Nazi (and now neo-nazi white supremacist skinheads) appropriation of such imagery to fuel their nationalism. It was done to such a degree that it pissed off Tolkien, who was himself something of a Nordic romanticist.  In a letter to his son he wrote   ""I have in this War a burning private grudge—which would probably make me a better soldier at 49 than I was at 22: against that ruddy little ignoramus Adolf Hitler ... Ruining, perverting, misapplying, and making for ever accursed, that noble northern spirit, a supreme contribution to Europe, which I have ever loved, and tried to present in its true light.""   If I recall correctly, he started a club for undergraduates called the 'Viking Club' devoted solely to reading old norse sagas and drinking beer. Tolkien was an expert on Old Norse literature, and his academic writings on Old Norse and Germanic culture, literature, language, and culture were incredibly popular among the Nazi leaders, despite him making no secret of his disgust towards them.   He also taught Old Norse to the inklings and they'd often read the sagas in their original form. He was a pretty crazy guy, one of his students is quoted as saying that he could 'turn a lecture room into a mead hall', and he's known to have chased one of his neighbors with an axe while dressed as an Anglo-Saxon warrior.   I totally went off-topic with Tolkien, but... I like Tolkien."

Norse,34qnni,Strid,1 point,Wed May 6 16:07:59 2015 UTC,Not sure why you were downvoted. You are correct. It was a celtic/gaelic symbol that was adapted by Christianity to symbolize the Holy Trinity. Not entirely sure why it would be on a Norse tattoo however.   Some scholars seem to theorize that it was the Germanic variation of the Valknut (Odin's symbol).

Norse,33rr4t,thylacine_pouch,3,Sat Apr 25 00:09:30 2015 UTC,"First off, what system are you using? Saga of the Icelanders works well, I hear, for this kinda stuff, being built around Norse culture.   Also, the Norse were pretty religiously tolerant as a rule (though it might be better described as they didn't perceive religion the same way as Christians, and so were more ambivalent, thus why they raided monasteries but also had no issues with Christians building churches) Of course the elves and other landvaettir might have a specific reason for disliking churches (encroachment onto their territory, lack of respect, etc). Finally, you probably already know this, but gothi served as something along the lines of a priest. They didn't have anything like a organized college of priests of course, but gothi performed the rituals to the gods and spirits. So if the gothi is raising a church he has somewhat rejected his role as gothi. (wanted to make sure you knew that, you probably do.)"
Norse,33rr4t,Odinswolf,3,Sat Apr 25 00:26:57 2015 UTC,"I'm going to run it with Reign -- Sagas has a lot of great stuff, but not as much combat-focused stuff as I'd like for the end.  And, thanks for the gothi info!  I'm actually a little fuzzy on how their role differed from jarls.  I'm reading ""Saga"" by Jeff Janoda right now, which is a retelling of ""People of Eyri,"" and they don't seem to do a ton of priest-type stuff; more lord type stuff.  I like the idea that maybe to build the church the bad guy jarl/gothi moved some huldufolk rocks and that's stirring stuff up?"
Norse,33rr4t,Odinswolf,3,Sat Apr 25 00:31:17 2015 UTC,"Well, iron age germanic ideas of leadership mixes spirtual, military, and legal leadership together. Similar to Logmadar, gothar could have a lot of power and influence, so much so that they survived Christianization as chieftains. You see this especially in Iceland, where gothi were more powerful due to a lack of structured leadership. It depends a lot on when and where you are setting your game. But, in general, a gothi is a priest and a local leader, while a Jarl's authority is much broader.  As for the reason the elves dislike the church, one idea could be that he profaned a sacred grove to Freyr (King of Alfheim) in the process of building his church, and possibly killed those who tried to stop him (if the grove was a frithstead, this would be a very serious crime against honor). Maybe he built his church in the grove, as a sign of the power of Christ defeating the pagan gods (think Saint Boniface). Or simply disturbed elf-homes then tried to force them out with the power of Christ when they started making trouble in response."

Even the names of the days of the week that we have in most Germanic languages were actually taken from the Romans as well, and they replaced the names of Roman gods with ones that suited their own cultures and religions.  I could be wrong, but I find it rather rare that years are actually mentioned.

Norse,33n15o,trazia,10,Thu Apr 23 21:11:48 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, if you're going to name a weapon, it should be something meaningful to you. It doesn't need to make sense to anyone else, as long as it holds special meaning for you.   Try and take a look at what the weapon is used for as well. You said it's a bow, is it for hunting? Is it for competition shooting? Is it just to hang on your wall and look pretty? A name can greatly portray an items use, or dismiss it entirely. You wouldn't want to name something ""Foehammer"" if it had never been used in combat, for example. It would sound pretentious and entirely misleading.  Another method in naming is to look at the deeds of said weapon. What was it used for that made it so special? Speaking fictionally of course, did your sword bring death to a King? Was your bow used in the defense of a city, always striking true? Could you fell a tree in a single strike with your axe?  You can always name your bow after someone, or a place even. You did say you wanted something along the lines of Home... What exactly about Home do you want the name to portray? Your bow shoots arrows; do these arrows help you to find home? Or do they guide your path in some way? Does your bow protect your home and family? Look at the Icelandic ""Vegvísir"" - Used to help someone find their way (sometimes called a Norse compass).  You could name it ""varðiheim"" (forgive me if I butchered two words together). I believe the meaning should be something along the lines of ""Home defender""? (Or close to). Basically, the best place to start is with the history and story of your bow. Otherwise you could just as well call it McBurger Tits Shooty Shoot."

Norse,33litl,Draco_x,3,Thu Apr 23 16:02:48 2015 UTC,"First off, we know very litte and pretty much just from their enemies so keep that in mind ;)  Afiak most if not all which we know about them is from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Maybe there is some bits and bobs in the Jómsvíkinga saga not sure though.  Guess the best archeological source for the great army will probably be the Jorvik viking centre.  In the Cronicles entries from 870-885 A.D. the great army is refered to as ""the Danes"" or ""the Danish army"" many times. So we can assume that Danes either were the vast majority or the saxons just called all nose people danes. (?) Imo. it probably was a mixture though.  Such a long and (at times) sucessfull raid will have drawn many Vikings from home in quest for treasure and land.  The clothing and colors probably didn't differ much from the usuall norse garb, however thats just guessing i know just of shoe and jewelery finds from jorvik.  I doubt the shields were uniform since ""the army"" was probably a loose assortment of shipscrews and the troops of a large number of nobles, but since chalk and soot are cheap and vastly available in britan i guess it's possible. The bayeux tapestry shows a bunch of roundshields aswell as the kite shields so thats a few possible paint styles .  There are many sites and books describing weaponary and armor, here's my understanding as a TL;DR though. ;)  Spears, axes and seaxes were probably the weapon of the common men, while richer warriors might have wielded swords and Daneaxes aswell.   Armor is more difficult since we really don't have shit, so all speculation. Most commoners probably didn't wore any armor or just a padded tunic, maybe a leather cap. Very rich warriors and elite troops might have worn chainmail and metal helmets, though rarely."

Not sure what the right guy is wearing or why he's not wearing any shoes. Dunno what that backpack is supposed to be, either, but you see it too briefly to tell.  0:45: A general criticism, but they are generally dressed in too drab colours. The fact that they own swords would indicate that the characters you see are of high status, which means most likely they should be dressed in blues, greens, pinks or reds. Black is a very hard colour to achieve using the dye palette of North Europe.  0:50: Metal facing on shield is entirely wrong, which is a shame because before that the shields weren't too bad. It's also too small.  0:55: Costuming isn't bad but perhaps an over-reliance on separate hoods. They definitely existed but whether they were such a common item of Scandinavian dress is debatable.  0:56: Buckle is wrong, I think that whole item of clothing is a later-period gambeson.  0:58: Again, all way too drab for rich Vikings.  1:00: Here they have just gone for generic 'Viking' long scraggly hair. There's a reasonable amount of evidence on how the vikings wore their hair and beards, and it isn't that. See Ewing's 'Viking Clothing' or Gale-Crocker 'Dress in Anglo-Saxon England.'  1:08: 1 man, 2 axes = eleet. Metal axe ring = nonsense. I applaud their choice of a very narrow belt on the left but the wide belt tied in a bollock knot on the right is less authentic - bollock knots are a reenactorism. The sword he is carrying appears to be a Petersen type C, which according to Peirce dates the film to the 9th century. The guy on the right also appears to be wearing a knitted cardigan that's stitched together with 1/2 inch white stitches? Not a good example of Viking costuming. Leather belt pouch on left is a bit naff.  1:10: Enemies shields are way too small unless they happen to be Pictish, in which case AFAIK they'd be square. Also, the guy 2nd from the left is not carrying a shield, which is an idiotic move.  1:12: Lamellar armour on the left, which is bullshit. Why is the archer walking into the melee? Petersen type K swords in there, which are consistent with the type C earlier. Good job.  1:13: To nobody's surprise the archer is dead.  1:17: Unsheathed sword stuck through belt? Also, a broadaxe has appeared a mere 1 or 2 hundred years too early.  1:22: Metal edging on shield?  1:27: More of that knitted weirdness  Conclusion: could easily have been a hell of a lot worse."
Norse,33afam,Shireling,4,Mon Apr 20 22:47:59 2015 UTC,"'Cities' is a bit of an overstatement when it come to Norway in the 10th century! The only thing approaching a city (and I'd honestly call it a proto-town - it's nothing like the 'proper' high medieval towns of Scandinavia) is Kaupang (named as Skíringssalr in Ohthere's accounts of his travels though we're not sure if this was actually the site he was referring to). There are some relatively reliable accounts of town names in the region - like the Skarthi rune-stone in the Haithabu Viking Museum, which gives the town name as Heiðabý (normalised from the futhark).  The sagas mention some interesting names for the towns of the Rus', like Aldeigjuborg for Staraya Ladoga and Holmgarðr for Veliky Novgorod :)"
Norse,33afam,alix_mac,3,Tue Apr 21 02:27:02 2015 UTC,I prefer it when the historic places have their historic name and when the invented places have invented names. If you give the invented places names you find later or somewhere else it is making things confusing. You never know what people associate when you use existing historic place names for your own inventions.   I  think Snorri (prosa edda) invented quiet some things himself but did it so well and based on language roots that it is hard for us to tell what was historic and which he invented. But the people in his time most likely knew which was historic and which was fiction.  But if you name a city Troy it better is the Troy and not 2 fisherman huts or you get a lot of people confused.

Norse,3351dn,historybuffCO,16,Sun Apr 19 16:50:33 2015 UTC,"According to the researcher, the models applied to understand the Viking Age ignore the women’s impact and contribution. This is particularly visible in the high school history books. Løkka found that only one among the six most popular history books from the 1990s and 2000s provides its own paragraph on women.    That's most likely because the Viking Age is barely represented in textbooks at all. The only Viking Age people generally mentioned are going to be Erik the Red/Leif Eriksson or Harald Hardrada in connection to the European discovery of the Americas and the events of 1066 in England.   Any decent history of the Vikings mentions women and everyday life, but still suffer somewhat from being the histories of the ruling classes, which are primarily men.   The sagas actually contain many references to women and they are often major players in the inter-family politics of Iceland."

As usual, feminists see a gap and want to fill it with the ""facts"" they'd like to see.  I do agree it is unfortunate that accounts of Viking women are few and far between. In that era, I don't think anyone could get by without pulling their weight.  Maybe there is someone out there who has the information these people seek, or can put together a better picture than this nonsense:  ""“I’m not saying that the stereotypical representation isn’t feasible at all, but it contributes to a description of the Viking Age based solely on male activities. Most probably the Viking society consisted of other dividing lines and hierarchies where women to a larger degree ranked on top,” Løkka adds.""  Despite admitting there is almost no evidence or history of Viking women, she comes to the conclusion that women were ""to a larger degree"" in charge.   No. I don't think so.  My hope is that we will yet discover more, real, history about the role of women. I'd imagine that apart from less time on the battlefield (depending on their inclinations and strength) and more time in the home (if they are a mother/pregnant), they lived their lives much like the men.."

Every book I have and website I've seen that has a pronunciation guide has something slightly different. Maybe it's best to use Modern Icelandic. Modern Icelandic is only slightly different from Old Norse in pronunciation and inflections. After all, no one is going to meet a live Old Norse native speaker who will make fun of our accents.

Norse,332fpo,Quietuus,9,Sat Apr 18 22:48:53 2015 UTC,"That's close enough I suppose. Each of the runes has a lot of meanings - Eihwaz is especially tricky that way, meaning anything from archery to communication to death - so it's difficult to guess exactly what the creator of the image intended by each rune.   I am iffy on how some of the runes are supposed to match up with the worlds in this drawing, but I'd bet Isa is Niflheim since that's the realm of ice. Mannaz is probably Midguard, since, humans.   I should also add that this is a slightly unusual drawing of the layout of the nine worlds and looks heavily inspired by the Kabbalistic tree of life."

Dragon Rouge are explicitly left hand path and highly eclectic, so it might help to think about things like that in terms of Luciferianism or even theistic Satanism. It might also make sense to look at the sefirot, which as others have mentioned is being very explicitly referenced here. It's possible that he's trying to draw an explicit links between a particular rune, world and one of the sefirah. Looking more closely though, it may also be that the schema being used here doesn't entirely match the one from Secret of the Runes."

In lotr, Gandalf is based on Odin.  Also the obvious movies as of late. You should probably note that Christian culture carried nordic culture due to the lack of written culture by Vikings.

If you broaden your area to ""Germanic/ Teutonic mythology"" instead of specifically ""Norse"" (which excludes the Continental and Saxon varieties of the same mythology) you might also bring up that the ""low mythology"" (folklore) is a constant in our culture.

Each piece can move as many moves they want diagonally or horisontaly (Like the towers in chess). 2 pieces have to surround one to kill it like ABA. Like in checkers, I think. If A A stands like this, and B moves in -> ABA, he is safe.  The king has to be surrounded by 4 pieces, but if he has one side to the board edge or a fortress it counts as 1 piece. To make it more even one can say it's fine to block with 2 attackers."

Norse,32e3yw,Zombie-with-a-beard,2,Mon Apr 13 01:09:53 2015 UTC,"I'd also avoid helmets altogether..  There is pretty much only one viking helmet found, ever.  Leaders tended to wear them, the rest would use looted helmets, no helmets or woollen hats.. when you see movies with hundreds of Vikings all wearing replicas of the one Viking helmet found it is fucking ridiculous.  They used axes more than swords, partly because axes used less metal to make (and had more uses). They certainly weren't all decked out in helmets.  They used to take the innards out of rabbits and wear them like sandals with the heads facing forwards. This is why Vikings are also known as Bunifkhetijya, or ""Terror Bunnyfeet""."

I briefly ready about it and the general idea I got was the wealthy had things like broaches made out of leather but it was far too rare for it to be used as vests like in the show.    So I cant give you much help on what you should wear I can tell you that unless you want to be recognized as someone from the show stay away from leather main pieces (vests, pants, ect)."
Norse,32e3yw,SnakeHelah,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:55:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm. But leathers are pretty easily obtained, and easily made by peasants. You could be right, but that doesn't make too much sense."
Norse,32e3yw,RedShirtDecoy,2,Mon Apr 13 02:08:32 2015 UTC,"I wonder if leathers were more readily available for the later Norse generations instead of the generations from the late 700s early 800s, since that is when the show takes place.    But from what I understood from my reading the methods to make leather were still pretty primitive so only items like broaches, helmets, and shoes were made.  The full torso vests and shirts like one the show, those are the ones people have issues with in regards to the show."
Norse,32e3yw,SnakeHelah,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:24:28 2015 UTC,"Uhhh, I'm pretty sure all the main characters in the show are one of the wealthiest vikings so it's not that unrealistic for them to have leather armor. They are raiders after all so they don't neccesarily have to make it, rather obtain it or buy it from trade"
Norse,32e3yw,RedShirtDecoy,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:49:41 2015 UTC,"They would have had leather shoes, helmets, broaches, and smaller items but I dont think any full armor pieces have ever been found from a historical stand point.

Norse,32e3yw,Strid,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:07:16 2015 UTC,"Very true!!  Again, I have to reiterate the information I have comes after a handful of debates like this about the show and a few ""historians"" giving their opinion.  Since this is reddit I tend to take those with a grain of salt but I still couldn't find any references to historians finding armor made out of leather.   Actually that leads me to another question.  could leather armor have biodegraded in the 1200 years since the Viking age started?  Could it be that it existed but we havent found it yet?  Or was it found and I just cant use google?  lol."
Norse,32e3yw,Pepsisinabox,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:19:53 2015 UTC,"Leather was easily obtainable, but the process of making agile armor was timeconsuming and thus expensive, so most either wore ""crap"" armor, or thick and padded clothing. Sadly, not much have been found when it comes to armor and such due to degeneration of the materials, but it is safe to assume that cost played a big role. Nothing to do with the availability of the materials. Also, most would opt for shields as their main defense (and sometimes in a offensive role as well)."

Norse,324yqf,TOASTER_JESUS,6,Fri Apr 10 16:54:08 2015 UTC,"I'm personally a big admirer of Freyr so when I saw this I figured I'd try to help you out.    There is the Lay of Skirnir, sometimes called the Wooing of Gerdr where Freyr is overcome with desire for the Jotunn Gerdr, and in his love-sick fervour, he offers up his magical sword as a wedding gift.  He succeeds in having Gerdr agree to marry him, however he has doomed himself in that this sword would have helped him against Surtr at Ragnarok, and will face the World Destroyer with nothing but a stag's antler.  Despite knowing he is doomed, Freyr will face his destiny fearlessly, and in defiance, will stab out one of Surtr's eyes.  Here is a quote from the Elder Edda translated by James Allen Chrisholm.  (I have it in Old Norse as well, however I don't have the edth and thorn characters on my phone like some fancy pants folks have):  -9-""I give you the horse to bear you over the darkness and the famous flickering flame, and the sword that swings itself if wise be the wielder.""  To transcribe this into Runes is actually the easier part.  You simply choose a system, such as the Elder, Younger or Anglo-Saxon Furthark(orc) (I'm not too concerned with the Armanen system) and transcribe the words phonetically.  As Runes aren't associated with letters, but rather vocal sounds, you don't really have to worry about things like grammar.  There are plenty of resources online that can show you the sounds that each Rune represents, and as such you can apply that to the sounds of the words.  The idea of runic writing isn't to provide for a standardized, latin-like mode of writing, but instead to provide understanding.  Anyone who knows the sounds of the runes seeing this tattoo will be able to ""sound out"" the words, and understand what you mean to express.  No one should be going ""Lol, that rune there expresses the wrong vowel, hurr durr.""  and if they do, don't listen to them.  After all, word and letter pronunciation varies within a language (regional dialects and such).  Hope this was helpful."

Fehu is a rune that is also associated with both Freyr and Freyja since it's the first sound in their names and it means cattle and wealth. A lot of people I know also associate Gebo with Freyr, since it means gift or exchange and is seen in bindrunes for wealth along with Fehu.   That's if you want runes with relevant meanings. If you just want to spell out his name, others have covered that."

Before you go and get the tattoo, ask yourself if a huge raven tattoo with an Odin theme is something you really want, or if it's something you think is just really cool. Committing yourself just long enough to get a tattoo doesn't show commitment to the Aesir, if that makes sense."

The lecture is called ""On Heroes, Hero-worship, and the heroic in history"". Link : http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1091/1091-h/1091-h.htm  The section you will likely want to focus on is part one, in which Carlyle discusses scandinavian mythology (although the whole lecture is worth reading.  This is the only thing in english that I can think of of the top of my head, but of course Wagner's Operas all draw heavily upon norse myth and culture, and you should be able to find plenty of scholarly articles about them.  Hope this helps! I will update you if I can think of anything else, and feel free to message me if you have any more questions. I can also point you in the direction of some very good early 20th century sources if you like."

If you're not caucasian and if a group of skinheads sees it, they might aproach you and ask about it (with negative intentions), but with everything else with humans in it, it's not certain. I'd keep it underneath your clothes if possible. Actually, skinheads do not care much about the real viking history...most of them make tattoos of vikings wearing horned helmets and stuff like that.   Edit: It was like wearing a piece of cloth with the number 88 on it...now it doesn't matter but back when I was a teen if we saw someone wearing this we would definetely inquire..violently most likely.

Norse,3197lo,logicfailing,17,Fri Apr 3 00:22:24 2015 UTC,"Sayings of the High One from the Poetic Edda, verse 138-139:  ""I know that I hung on a windswept tree nine long nights,  wounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin,  myself to myself,  on that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run.  With no bread did they refresh me nor a drink from a horn, downwards I peered;  I took up the runes, screaming I took them,  then I fell back from there.""   There are of course the controversies that his hanging is much like Jesus' Crucifixion, yet the Hanged God is present in ancient Indo-European and other Near Eastern religions--long before Christian influence (Oxford).   *Yggdrasil is how the World Tree is spelled. ;}"
Norse,3197lo,Solclover,4,Fri Apr 3 01:10:25 2015 UTC,"I believe Kevin Crossley-holland addressed this in his book, ""The Norse Myths,"" saying that while the crucifixion and Odin's hanging have their similarities, they are thematically different. Odin died and traveled to Hel to bring back the knowledge of of the dead while Jesus died and went to hell to rescue the souls there or whichever variations you subscribe to.  Crossley-holland's conclusion(fron what I gather) was that neither story influenced the other."

Gallows themselves were called ""the Horse of the Hanged"" so in summation, Odin's gallows."

Now, you COULD follow in some footprints I've seen and butt glue boards together, chamfer it down so that the edges are less thick than the center.... But I'd suggest 1/2"" plywood.  Gluing a layer or two of cloth will increase its' durability a lot, and then you get a nicer surface to paint. As far as design there, take it easy. Shields were pretty disposable. If you want to do edging, I'd look into rawhide doggie bones, but there are also websites that'll sell strips of 3"" wide rawhide, which is perfect. Soak, stretch along shield, stitch on while it's still pliable and let dry."

Second the plywood idea for convenience - plus it would be usable in reenactment. I go for 9mm exterior grade. For the rawhide, I'd recommend sewing it into a loop about 8 inches less than the circumference of the shield, then stretching it over, then sewing. The radius of the shield should be her knuckles to her elbow + 2-3 inches. If you want a really authentic appearance, I'd recommend putting more work into making your own paints than butting planks together - see https://dineidyn.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/shield-paints-pdf.pdf"

It's a whole lot stronger, due to the lack of voids, and it's lighter.  For the rawhide, I'd suggest buying pre-cut strips or a half shoulder and cutting your own.  The rawhide sold for leatherwork will be of a better quality, and more consistent thickness, than that you'll find in a dog bone. As far as sewing it into a loop beforehand?  To me, that sounds like a lot of extra work... but hey...different strokes for different folks.  I'd rivet your hardware on, as opposed to using bolts.

Norse,30xepy,Solmundarson,2,Tue Mar 31 20:54:03 2015 UTC,"Archaeologist here, I can only speak for the UK and Ireland but what this guy is doing is 100% illegal. Metal detectors require a licence, and are not permitted to search for objects on private property (anything found on this property immediately belongs to the land owner) or in areas known to contain archaeology/ have archaeological potential. Even archaeologists require a licence to use a metal detector and can be fined if found to be breaking the rules (which is in fact law).  What many people misunderstand is that museums do not want to necessarily rob you of your treasures, the most important thing is to record these finds so they can be added to the archaeological record and therefore, be a benefit to future or current research. Otherwise, the contextual and artefactual information is lost forever and the object becomes of little use to archaeological research. Acquiring artefacts is one thing, but if you lose the contexts in which they are found (location on site, proximity to other artefacts etc), and if the soil surrounding the object is lost/disturbed (which often contains important information) then the artefact is more-or-less useless to archaeological science and research. Without this information these objects are considered 'stray finds' and are likely to end up in storage in a museum, never to see the light of day, or (in my opinion) worse, sold on the black market.   The most vital thing is to record any artefacts you find, you can do this by visiting your local/national museum website where you should be able to find an artefact recording sheet. If you have a metal detector licence, and the object was not obtained on private property (excluding your own of course) then you are entitled to keep that object."

In Germany everything you find goes to the state/province. Expect in Bavaria there is a 50/50 Split between Finder and Land Owner. In all other provinces the finder nor the land owner gets anything of the findings concerning the law. They also do not get any compensation.   You also have to report all archaeological findings to the Denkmalschutz (protection of ancient monuments). That includes everything from the second world war and further back.  On top of that there is special regulations concerning weapons you are finding.

Norse,30oprw,S0pdet,11,Sun Mar 29 09:23:37 2015 UTC,"Most Anglo-Saxon literature was written by monks who were highly critical of Norsemen. They used Christianity as a point to claim the Norsemen as barbaric heathens in a war against god. They made strong points of their violence and their negative image got stronger over time. These negative portrayals can be seen in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, the Anuls of St Bertin, the Anuls of Ulster, and the actions of Alfred the Great.  Alfred's dominance of vernacular literature meant that most records spread around were positive to his kingdom and therefore against Norse invaders and the Danelaw. To the extent that Northern Kingdoms started allying with the Norsemen against him.  Some manuscripts even thanked storms and proclaimed they were sent by god to protect Christians from Norse raiders."

Norse,30oprw,davemaster,26,Sun Mar 29 11:59:00 2015 UTC,"Is this a joke?   Christianism dedicated a massive amount of time to eradicating and rewriting germanic and viking cultures and beliefs.   Books were burned (though much of Viking history was passed down orally), Wodens sacred Oaks were cut down, mystics were burned alive - there is suggestion that much of the Eddas are interpolated with censorship and Christian alterations - even that entire stories within are thus.  Perhaps even the account of Ragnarok itself was twisted to hasten the death of the pagan gods faith by predicting their doom!  Some say the Vikings raped and pillaged, but Christianity raped and robbed North-West Europe of its culture, it's history - to the extent that few people even have basic knowledge of their ancestors or their stories.  When you celebrate St. Patricks Day, you are celebrating Christian Domination and subjugation of the old Gods.. you are celebrating culturecide."
Norse,30oprw,Abedeus,2,Sun Mar 29 13:53:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, entire freaking holidays are almost copy pasted from Germanic traditions to assimilate them and claim as their own. It's not a coincidence that Saturnalia, Yuletide and Christmas were/are all in more or less the same time."
Norse,30oprw,shamalamastreetman,3,Sun Mar 29 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"Many pagan rituals have been incorporated into Christian ritual. Eggs and rabbit for Easter, certain dates for holy days, Christmas trees, saints taking on the roles of specialized deities. History is a lot more varied and interesting than convenient oversimplifications. Being a Christian, but wanting to chronicle the ancient tales, Snorri Sturluson walked a tightrope when he wrote the Prose Edda. But no doubt Christianity brought ""there is only one way for salvation"". Some conversions were more subtle- google Saint Ansgar.  The Viking age spans 300-500 years depending on your criteria. In that time there were many niche religions. The Vikings being a ""well traveled"" folk interacted with many cultures. From my research any competing faith during the Viking age had a propaganda spin machine in order to attract believers/money. The shamans of Finnmark were slandered by the Vikings at every opportunity. The Russ had many manuscripts maligning the ""dirty northmen"". The Vanir and Aesir had a war and we know who won the hearts and minds in the end. Conversely every peoples had a thunder god with slightly different attributes. Belief was more dynamic then. People believed in many gods and spirits, and new myths could permeate someone's faith quite easily in the ""age of wonder"".  Last note to remember: the winners write the history books."

There would be considerably more Viking helmets found or unearthed if they were common, and you can count the number actually found on a pair of hands. So movies/tv shows with lots of Vikings wearing the same famous ""Viking helmet"" (nevermind horned ones) are ridiculously inaccurate.

Norse,307xf7,alexxxpoling,4,Wed Mar 25 04:37:12 2015 UTC,"As a norskie, I would recommend that you go with something that, on top of having the ""norse look"", has a symbolism and a deeper meaning that you relate to underneath just the looks of the tattoo. A thors hammer or a ""midgardsorm"" (What is it called in english again... ah! Jörmungandr) on your arm would count as just as cheesy as a tribal tattoo, at least where I come from (Norway).   On suggestions... what about yggdrasil, like This one or maybe something like This one?  Yggdrazil is the tree of life, of the world, it is the all. It is also a symbol of wisdom and unity.  Or maybe Huginn and Muninn?  Another example of them here! Their names mean thought and desire.   The most important thing whatever you go for though, BE CAREFUL! a lot of the genuinly used norse symbols have been taken into use either by the nazi party during WW2 or by neo nazi groups after that, and since you want to have this on your body at all times, be sure you go for something that gives of the signal you want to give of, not something else.  Good luck! both with your tattoo and in the army!"
Norse,307xf7,alltheworldisgreen,5,Wed Mar 25 11:56:55 2015 UTC,Huginn and Muninn are thought and memory.
Norse,307xf7,Sketches_theFall,2,Wed Mar 25 22:15:56 2015 UTC,"It is commonly thought so yes, but the word Munnin does not derive from the old norse word of memory, (minni, or in todays norwegian: minne) it derives from the the word munr, or desire. If you look to some of the lines from edda in old norse and not translated, desire actually makes quite a bit more sence. I'll see if I can find some english material on this."
Norse,307xf7,alltheworldisgreen,2,Thu Mar 26 07:24:59 2015 UTC,"The only things I can find supporting this are web pages and older works by non-experts, like Christian theologians talking about Norse myth.

If you have any Norwegian scholarly sources stating otherwise I would be very interested."

I'll see if I can dig up some online material. It's about 8 years since II did norse, so I think I might have to look around a bit."

Modern asatruar consider it a sign of dedication to Odin, and it should only be worn after much thought. This is because wearing the symbol means one is marking themselves for Odin, to live and die at his choosing. As someone who wears a valknut myself, I have come to believe that it also represents the interconnected nature of the nine worlds. This makes sense, as Odin is the one who travels the nine worlds. edit: Thought I would also point out that the word ""valknut"" literally translates to ""knot of the slain."""

Norse,302ma6,Jarunik,3,Mon Mar 23 23:57:52 2015 UTC,"Carving is not chiseling.   If you want to carve you have to use a sharp blade and cut the wood without destroying the wood structure. That means you should not apply so much pressure that you chisel into the wood. The blade you are carving with should be so sharp and used in an angle that allows the blade to cut through the wood. If you do it like that there will be a ""flat"" cut mark where you applied your knive.  What you did in your example was more or less just destroying the wood  in a circular way and then paint it black.  Maybe you can start with a simple stick of wood and cut rings into it.   Maybe you try to carve a whistle first (it is not my guide): http://www.jonsbushcraft.com/elderwhistle.htm  Another good hint is that you should use wood which is good for carving. I guess your desk is not too ideal for that..."

This was written as a guide to Norse mythology for medieval Icelanders, geared towards giving a sufficient understanding of the myths that poets in Christian Iceland would be able to use the conventional language of Norse poetry. The first section, Gylfaginning, is structured as a dialogue between a king named Gylfi and Odin in disguise. It gives prose summaries, mixed with poetic quotation, to flesh out the major myths. If you're already familiar with most of the myths, it's probably fine to jump to the next book, but it's still worth reading.  The Poetic Edda. This is the (mostly) unfiltered mythic and heroic poems of Old Norse. There are a few different translations: Carolyne Larrington, Andy Orchard, and the just released Jackson Crawford (I'm not familiar with it yet). Larrington is more faithful to the meaning, while Orchard takes more liberties. The poems that are the most fun are Thrymskvida and Lokasenna, but there's lots of great stuff.  If you're looking for more of a scholarly guide you might check out John Lindow's Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs.

They were reportedly covered from head to fingertip with tattoos of trees and animals according to him, but no notes on the art.  It's pretty safe to say they wouldn't be massively intricate, as it most likely would have been made with watered ash or ash and maybe some dye.  They most likely would be two dimensional like the drawings, etchings , etc. and probably not all that intricate  due to the fact it would need to be poked in.  As far as cultures go, they had a it of a vanity streak, so they probably would be more or less well placed.  Personally I believe they picked it up from the scots/picts in their settlements and probably did it more out of boredom than a ritual - then again we know so little overall.  The sagas mention nothing - which is odd because if it was prevalent they probably would have made mention - then again it could have been so commonplace they didn't think to mention it, but I doubt it.  The Vikings tv show is wholly inaccurate on so many levels from clothing and armor to religion and battle.  Invest more time reading about the culture before such a longtime commitment.

I do not recognize it from any Viking era source I'm aware of. I imagine it was written specifically for the show. If anyone knows better, please correct me!  Edit: I see you may have gotten ""Njord"" confused with ""Norse""? In Norse Paganism, Njörð (pronounced “NYORD;” Old Norse Njörðr) is a god among the Vanir. Njörð, father of the deities Freyr and Freyja by his unnamed Vanir sister, was in an ill-fated marriage with the goddess Skaði, lives in Nóatún and is associated with sea, seafaring, wind, fishing, wealth, and crop fertility."

Allsnægtar is derived from the word nóg, so from nóg we derive the noun nægt which means plenty or plentifulness. So you could say ""Freyr, guð nægtar"" and it would be correct but by adding the prefix alls- (meaning all) we get a noun meaning ""plenty of everything"" or ""plentifulness in every aspect"", this sounds a bit wonky when written out in English although it's a very beautiful word in my opinion and that's why I used it.  In short, you can use nægtar but instead I used allsnægtar because it sounds mightier and more godlike."

A good sheet of Baltic birch (generally available at woodworking and cabinetry shops) is more expensive, but is very solid/dense and will give you a lot more strength than even two sheets of regular ply, at a fraction of the weight and bulk.  Additionally, the thinner shield will flex more...and you want that flex.  The big goal is to redistribute impact, more than to stand as a rigid wall in the face of a strike.    Additionally, you want your linen sheets to be glued at 45º to each other instead of perpendicular.  In a square fabric weave, perpendicular placement doesn't really do much.  Rather than bolts, look at using those large roofing nails as rivets.  Cut them down to just shy of 1/4"" beyond level with the hole, and peen them down over washers.  If you actually use your shield, then exposed bolts can cut your hand whereas peened hardware won't.  Depending on gloves, I might also suggest adding a small bit of padding on the inside top edge of your grip, inside the boss.  Held properly, the weight of that shield is going to rest right where your index finger joins your palm...when you start flipping the shield around, you can put a lot of stress there."

It's like if we were to ask how men today wears their wallet: some were them in their back pocket, some in the side pocket, some in their jacket, some don't wear wallet, etc.  I'm sure it was the same things for the coin pouches of the time (and for a lot of other things).    Viking didn't wore uniform and, apparently, were taking quite care of their appearance.  Certainly they were making their clothing their own and tried different things.  We don't have that many artifacts from the period and I think it would be a mistake to believe that one particular item we found was the only model available.  I'm not advocating to open the vane and let everything go but, to a certain extend, if it make sense, if we know they had the technology for it, if it's still practical, if it's doesn't go too far astray from what we know (or may be from culture we know they had contact with) it shouldn't necessarily be frown upon."

Yes, you can see them in the picture but they were shooting more than one video that day.   There is no proof of the viking having gambesons but it is often assumed because it just make sense (and the viking were no dummy).  They certainly came in contact with culture that had gambesons (so they definitely knew about it) and due to the fact that there nothing but fabric, gambesons don't tend to leave archaeological proof.

Who's really to say what they did and didn't use? They traveled so far from their home. Surely, they used all these things at some point, but probably just left them there, or sold them back to locals, so they could bring home more riches rather than weapons and armor.

Norse,2yoe8i,Haereticus,5,Wed Mar 11 22:54:11 2015 UTC,"People have already covered the worst errors but here are my detailed notes:   The rape jokes are just awful. Edit: I mean they are in contemptibly poor taste, not just that they aren't funny. Why would you dye your linen undershirt brown? It's a low-status colour and being washed weekly, it would just come out. Long side split is questionable. No evidence for his tall boots - could be leather hose but in that case he should be wearing higher status kit as they are riding gear - despite what he says later his kit is not consistently high-status. Baggies are fairly high-status but dyed a weld/iron colour - quite middle-class. He also has no other trappings of wealth, e.g. silver arm-rings, highly decorated clothing, his mjolnir should have a couple of expensive beads with it. Hat is eastern Viking, fur trim is naff but popular amongst reenactors Literally no evidence that they wore gambesons. I think they probably did, because mail without padding is useless, but he should at least bring up the fact that all reconstructions of Viking and Saxon gambesons are totally speculative. Reasonably good reason to think from the sagas that Northern Vikings wore enough thick layers not to need a gambeson. Black leather = naff. Maces were not common weapons of the age - probably a status symbol Mail is not 'woven.' Given that he would not be fighting on horseback, not sure why you'd deliberately have a great big split in your mail right over your balls. His belt is far too long and the bollock knot he ties it in is a reenactorism. Belt pouch is eastern Viking. Sword scabbard should be properly wood-cored and not a floppy leather sheath (another reenactorism). For the period he is portraying, it should be on a suspended baldric. Fairly sure the sword is a Z-type which is probably a bit late for the rest of the kit. Seaxes were uncommon amongst Vikings (particularly pre-Danelaw) - the early Swedes carried war-knives but they were a different shape and suspended from the belt very differently (incidentally, so were Saxon seaxes. The whole sheath is just wrong) Spangen is ok though quite a continental style at the time - a Viking would probably have better access to domed helmets, possibly with a spectacle mask. Shield is maybe a little bit small, but it's interpretable and also a question of personal taste. Spear is laughably short - they would have fought using 9 foot spears. His companion seems to be wearing a woman's dress, and in purple, which would have been an insanely expensive colour - a garment that rich would have been very ornately decorated."

Rune may mean secret, secret in the way that not everyone could read or write with them. The owner of this hammer clearly wanted to brag that he knew how.     Archeology paints runes as an alphabet for writing, and the words may hold some magical meaning but that does not mean that the characters themselves are magical.  Just like with a 6th century Danish inscription on a bracelet with the ancient spell formula GIBU.AUJA, which means “I give good luck”.  There are some magical inscriptions on finds, but they are really, really few and most are very old. The finds from brygga (harbor) in Bergen shows that the runes were almost exclusively used as a short message system.  The magical explanation of how Odin got the runes is not special, many cultures have mythological explanations of their writing systems. What we know now is that the runes most likely was based on the Latin alphabet or  Old Italic scripts ones (For example Etruscan)."

Norse,2x8and,Hoppetar,4,Thu Feb 26 13:27:35 2015 UTC,"There's actually an astonishing variety of burials from the Viking age, including burials similar to what we have today, cremations, boat burnings and others.  And dramatic burials are not always associated with men - probably the most dramatic known burial at all, the Oseburg ship, was a burial for two women of high status.  I would suppose that most burials for low-status people (before the conversion to Christianity) would be a simple grave in the ground, with a few grave goods and personal possessions.  However this is a bit of a generalisation and we can't say for sure.  After much of Scandinavia converted, grave goods were less commonly found.  Here's a wiki link to the Oseburg ship: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseberg_Ship And other ship burials: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_burial  Here's a description of known Norse burials, from Gwyn Jones 'The History of the Vikings': ""They practiced cremation as well as earth-burial, laid the dead to rest in mounds or level places, with or without grave goods, with boats real or symbolic or with no boat at all, in big wooden chambers and small coffins, and sometimes in neither.  There are single graves, graves for two (the one sometimes a woman slave), and communal graves.  Sometimes graves show an inter-mixture of religious beliefs.  It appears that the Viking Age burial was strongly affected by pre-Viking age customs, was open to local and regional distinctions...and reflected different views of the after-life"".

Norse,2x4gtb,osirusr,0,Sun Mar 1 02:51:24 2015 UTC,So what support do you have for your assertion that Loki may fight on the side of the Aesir?
Norse,2x4gtb,TryUsingScience,0,Fri Feb 27 23:39:53 2015 UTC,"In Ragnarok specifically? Nothing. But in every single other conflict you can find anywhere in the lore, he is on the side of the Aesir against the jotnar or any other enemy. That doesn't mean he doesn't make trouble for them sometimes, but never to help any external enemy gain an advantage against them. (He does get threatened into stealing Thor's hammer for a jotun, but that was coercion and he helped get it back, much to the detriment of the jotun.)"
Norse,2x4gtb,osirusr,-1,Sat Feb 28 00:04:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but my question was what evidence you have that Loki would fight alongside the gods in Ragnarok."
Norse,2x4gtb,TryUsingScience,0,Sat Feb 28 10:41:57 2015 UTC,And you don't think siding with the gods against the jotnar in every single other conflict in the lore is good evidence that he might continue to do so?

Norse,2x4gtb,TryUsingScience,0,Sat Feb 28 20:57:12 2015 UTC,I'm not lying to people. There are accounts where he is described as fighting against the gods. There are accounts where he is not. There is a great deal of speculation that the entire Ragnarok narrative is Christianized bullshit anyway.

Though I have asked you repeatedly, you have yet to provide a single example of an account where Loki does not fight against the Aesir in Ragnarok. So if your claim is true, then where is your evidence?  The truth of the matter is that Loki kills and is killed by Heimdall during Ragnarok. After betraying the Aesir, Loki does battle with them. He does not continue to fight on their side after they imprison him, and your assertion to the contrary is baseless and untrue."

Norse,2x2m2j,nocturnous,3,Wed Feb 25 03:33:07 2015 UTC,"There was widespread belief in sorcery and other forms of magic, including magic using runes, as well as Seidr. There was also a link between poetry and magic, for example the practice of Galdr. Both galdr and runic magic were linked to the gods, especially Odin, as was seidr, but they were understood as magic separate from the gods. There are also Icelandic staves, but the date on those is rather mixed."
Norse,2x2m2j,Odinswolf,0,Wed Feb 25 07:39:47 2015 UTC,"There was widespread belief in sorcery and other forms of magic, including magic using rune   That is absolutely not true at all. Archeology paints runes as simply characters to write with. Rune magic is a modern thing. The Icelandic magical staves are from the 17th century."
Norse,2x2m2j,Strid,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:34:51 2015 UTC,"The poetic Edda mentions magic runes several times, including bind-runes using tiwaz, and in the Havamal odin mentions runes being used for magic. Plenty of sources seem to indicate that runes were thought to have power beyond simple writing.  And staves may have older origins, though likely not stretching back to the Viking age. And the ones we know are from the 18th century."
Norse,2x2m2j,Odinswolf,0,Thu Feb 26 23:14:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's clear from history and archeology that the words hold the meaning, not the characters they are written with.  Take this ring I have which is a replica of a find. It says ""Gibu auja"", which means ""I give luck"". The WORDS form the meaning, not the system they are written with. Just like a priest doesn't think something is magical just because something is written in Latin or Greek. Almost all of the inscriptions found are just short messages.  Runes may mean secret, not in any magical way but just because not everyone would be able to read or write them. Like this one Thor's hammer we found, it had an inscription on it which said ""This is a hammer"". You think that was magical? No, he was jsut bragging he knew how to use the runes.    The sagas were written down several hundred years after the viking age and is well-known to exaggerate. We have to back it up with archeological finds, and there's no support for it. There's nothing magical about how Odin got the runes. Many cultures have a mythological explanation of how they got their writing system. And the runes were based on the alphabet of others. And it's not even spelled Havamal, but Hávamál or Håvamål. The å is pronounced like ""aw"" in hawk and it means the ""tongue (speech) of the high one"".     And the ones we know are from the 18th century.    As for that, ""Icelandic magical staves (sigils) are symbols credited with magical effect preserved in various grimoires dating from the 17th century and later.""  Source.  But hey, what do mere facts matter when feelings are concerned. I take it you're American, Odinswolf. You guys seem to have a more esoseteric approach whereas we Scandinavians have a more fact based and less dogmatic view. Odin was for example a god for the nobility and kings, not the common man."

Also with magic regarding the runes the norse we're a largely illiterate society so someone who could read and write runes had certain mystical connotations associated with them, think along the line of ""words have power"". And i've always found Seidr being akin to other pagan belief systems versions of journeying into the spirit world to gain insight into worldly matters. oh and then there's also the casting of runes which is similar to tarot card reading."

The game uses Futhark runes (instead of dice) to manage all game mechanics. The afterlife factors in heavily, with the possibility of players returning as Einherjar. The main story is set in the second age of Ragnarok- the Sword Age... 3 years after the great cataclysm, when the sun and moon were devoured by the celestial wolves Skoll and Hati.  The game is meant to be narrative friendly as each rune could be played for any action, but the game can get into some ""crunch"" with every character choosing powers and skills and binding them to specific runic symbols. Players can even play rune ""chains"" to perform more epic and memorable feats."

Min erfaring med religion gjør at jeg heller mest mot ateisme selv om jeg er i statskirken. Har ikke noe problem med at folk tror på høyere makter. Det er det de gjør ""på vegne"" av disse høyere maktene jeg sliter med. Enhver organisert trosretning blir dessverre organisert maktbruk før eller senere.  Men siden de gamle gudene er en del av vår felles kulturarv, er det spennende med en akademisk tilnærming mot dem. Spesielt siden det er så mye av den gamle troen som er skjult i våre daglige tradisjoner. For eksempel innenfor gårdsbruk. Alt fra historier om tollekniver med både manns- og bjørneblod til praktisk kunnskap som hvilken planter en har på torvtaket rundt pipen for å unngå lynnedslag.

They probably came from the caucasus, taking the route through what is now Finland and down Sweden, Denmark and Northern-Germany. Probably traveling along the coastlines as the inland of Europe was jungle.  After the advent of agriculture in central-europe, groups from what is now germany moved north, settled, farmed and intermingled with the existing hunter-gatheres.

Viking or Raiding was an era when they were fighting to end Catholicism from spreading, I am uncertain why they attacked the British isles other than it was because they accepted Catholicism while the Norse were trying to fight it off.     While there were battles prior to around 1000 a.d. the ""Vikings"" were an era of fighting Catholicism, they suffered tremendous losses and later accepted Catholicism.       That's not saying the Scandinavians are Russian genetically, 30-40,000 years of isolated breeding, they have unique features and particularly that tell tell Scandinavian hair.     I believe they did migrate west from Russia from a different kingdom.  The Siberians were also a very different people that are primordially indigenous to Russia.

The most common explanation we have here in Norway is that our fjords couldn't support so many people and our tradition of inheriting farms (The oldest son gets it) might have caused people to find other ways to make money. We had improved farming and could support a larger population so there was more people, I know this might seem contradictary to what I said above. There was also a strong warrior and honor tradition.

Bread cheese heated with lingonberry jam is delicious (kind of like baked Brie with jam, but in theme).  I've gotten both from ikea before so if you live near an ikea those are both easily accessible.  Smoked/cured salmon and dark bread with dill are good too.  For the main you can do something simple like a roast or stew is a safe bet because people have been eating those since ancient times and all non vegetarians love them.  I like the idea of rune cupcakes, but it might be simpler to make a midsomar cake if you can get decent strawberries where you are this time of year.  Obviously you must serve mead, but if you live somewhere with a big craft beer following it's easy to find craft brews with Norse themes like odins gift from Odin brewing co (personally I like the freya one but I prefer blonder beers)."

I've developed a pretty kickass recipe (if I do say so myself) that is also super simple (only takes a half hour or so), here it is briefly:  At the grocery store grab however many bottles of cheap wine that you want to consume.  I prefer a cheap zin, cab or merlot, but a cheap table red is fine too.  In a small sauce pan add a cup or 2 or three of water and all your spices (you can pick or choose which ones you want of course, I use them all to good effect): cardamom, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, black pepper corn, star anise, lots of whole cinnamon, a pinch of salt and a bunch of sliced ginger. Simmer this for a while to extract the spice flavors into the water. I'll simmer for a half hour or more.  Pour your wine in a soup pot.  using a sieve of some sort (collander or cheesecloth) pour the simmered spice water into the wine, catching all the spice bits to keep them out of the wine.    Gently heat the wine to NO MORE THAN 170 degrees!  this is critical, as alcohol evaporates at about 173 degrees at sea level.  I never go above 160 just to make sure. Otherwise you'll just be serving mulled grape juice.  Now add honey (or sugar if you have to) to taste.  You can also fortify with dark rum, brandy, cognac, etc.  if you have a lot of time and more forethought than I usually have you can place all the spices in the wine a day or 2 before hand and get a richer more full flavored mulled wine.  There you go!  I serve it in mugs and find people really enjoy it.  It sneaks up on you because people aren't used to sipping things out of mugs, so they end up drinking more than they expect, which just adds to the fun really."

Much is being found in British museum, and people even suspect there is undiscovered icelandic sagas or poetry there. Friend of mine is studying Icelandic medieval studies and found extended version of the story of Útgarða loki in one manuscript there that she is working on.   But some manuscripts went with Icelanders to Canada around 19th century.   There was big fight to danish goverment to return the manuscripts home and we manage to convince them to send Codex Regius and Flateyjarbók home. This kinda got in fashion again in Iceland which led to creation of Ásatrúarfélagið for example.   Any more questions? I konw lots about this :)"

Iceland had similar ringdance rímur based on Völsunga saga(and eddic poetry) the texts survived but the song itself got silenced down with the church.   I've always though been curious how much in Regin smiður is based on Völsunga saga and Eddic poetry, which I notice some faroese kvæði say they saw in big books from Iceland.

Norse,2vu0pw,RedOrm2,0,Sat Feb 14 05:03:11 2015 UTC,"here is the important responses with all the lists of books kind amazing ppl on this sub sent in....  ""I'm no expert in Medieval or Old-Norse studies, however I've do have an interest in it & from some searching on various different aspects of the Vikings I come across these: The Cambridge History of Scandinavia: Volume 1. Prehistory to 1520 it's a anthological survey book consisting of both historiographical and hagiographical (biographies of saints) primary & secondary sources ranging from prehistory ( before historical events were documented) through to medieval history of Scandinavia. It's quite pricey but definitely worth the money if your serious... The first part of the volume surveys the prehistoric and historic Scandinavian landscape and its natural resources, and tells how man took possession of this landscape, adapting culturally to changing natural conditions and developing various types of community throughout the Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. The rest - and most substantial part of the volume - deals with the history of Scandinavia from the Viking Age to the end of the Scandinavian Middle Ages (c. 1520). The external Viking expansion opened Scandinavia to European influence to a hitherto unknown degree. A Christian church organisation was established, the first towns came into being, and the unification of the three medieval kingdoms of Scandinavia began, coinciding with the formation of the unique Icelandic 'Free State'. The History of Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Denmark,Finland and Iceland) is similar to Cambridge History yet significantly cheaper The Viking World by Stefan Brink & Neil Price is a mid-range anthological book compromising of many articles from various scholars. I would really appreciate material that covers linguistics.....philology, morphology and the like As for the other categories, I would really appreciate some introductory material on archaeology. This book will probably be the best one for you because it includes all of the above. Myth and Religion of the North: the Religion Ancient Scandinavia this book is a good overview of the different mythologies before the christianisation of the nordics. Women in the Viking Age is a good book on the niche subject area of Women roles within the viking age nordics & its various colonies (from Greenland to Russia). Jesch uses various pieces of evidence from archaeological finds, runic inscriptions, historical records & Old Norse literature. I would also recommend you look into the Icelandic sagas & Eddas. I'd use SagaDB because there are many various different icelandic sagas & in a variety of languages including English, Icelandic & Old Norse. If you'd like to go about learning O.N. you check the Viking Society for Northern Research or check out the books: A New Introduction to Old Norse: I Grammar: 1 or Viking Language 1: Learn Old Norse, Runes, and Icelandic Sagas If you're interested at all in the presence of the Vikings (and later scandinavians) in Eastern Europe check out Viking Rus: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe Hopefully this helps if you have any more specific questions don't be afraid to ask :)  Hmm... There's a massive book (similar to the Cambridge History) on the processes of conversion that I think is a really good starting point for that really important aspect of the history. I don't recall the name and I'm on mobile, but I do know the editor's name is Nora Berend. (It might be called Christianization and the Rise of Christian Monarchy. I guess Elsa Roesdahl's The Vikings is a standard introduction, but I've never read it in its entirety and I think the Brink & Price volume does just as good a job, if not better. If you're interested in the situation pre-Viking Age, Malcolm Todd's The Early Germans is quite readable and very good. On the literary side, I think the Penguin Sagas of Icelanders is an essential investment - it's only like 30 bucks and its got good, modern translations, unlike the dated (but nonetheless serviceable!) translations you linked to. I'm a big fan of HE Davidson's introductory works on mythology, among them Gods and Myths of the North, even if they are starting to show their age. Eventually everyone wants to read the Eddas, and I think Anthony Faulke's translation of the Prose Edda is very good, and Lee Hollander's translation of the Poetic Edda is decent (though I understand there's a much better new translation due out soon; I don't recall the translator's name.) For more information on the literary side of things, the Blackwell Companion to Old Icelandic Literature is very thorough and informative, if a bit of a slog. The standard Old Norse textbook is still EV Gordon's, though copies are (apparently) getting pricier. Barnes' is great too, though. I haven't read Byock's but I'm not typically a huge fan of his. And if you are looking for a dictionary, Geir Zoëga's is the standard one for students. (It's all available online, easily accessible via Google.) Other fun stuff... Alaric Hall has lots of wonderful stuff freely available via his website, to do with mythology, folklore and linguistics. Kvideland & Sehmsdorf's Folk Belief and Legend is just all kinds of fun (even if post-Viking age, often by quite a lot) and Stephen Mitchell's work is also fascinating, though I'm drawing a blank on the one book title of his I'd particularly recommend. (Magic and Witchcraft in Scandinavia?) As for myself, I did my undergrad in history (with an emphasis on the 19th century, weirdly enough, because our department didn't offer much medieval stuff) and folkloristics (with an emphasis in Scandinavia.) I'm now working in both, but I'm particularly interested in sort of Grand Narrative questions to do with the development of the State and related institutions and the (somewhat wankily-titled) ""History of Ideas,"" as well as medieval and early modern Scandinavian folklore. My particular area of geographic interest is Sweden and the Baltic, but I'm doing my studies in Iceland so getting lots of West Norse stuff is pretty inescapable. :P  Alright, sorry for taking so long, I meant to get back to you sooner, but life, XD. So anyway, here are some sources, First off, let me say this, I freaking LOVE Anders Winroth. He's highly recognized in this subject, Ivy league professor, etc etc. He did a guest lecture at my very not Ivy league college about his newest book, and we snagged him to talk to my class prior. He's adorable to boot. But anyway, the beauty of his writing is that he synthesizes a whole boatload of archaeological evidence, primary sources, secondary sources, etc etc in a really conversational way (IMHO). So I would really recommend his writing.

If you'll pardon some seat-of-my-pants archaizing, here's what three of the names of the worlds would look like in proto-Norse:   Miðgarðr < Miðgarðʀ (rhoticism) < Miðgarðaʀ (syncopation) Ásgarðr < Āsgarðʀ (rhoticism) < Āsgarðaʀ (syncopation) < Ānsuʀgarðaʀ (syncopation, assimilation) Jǫtunheimr < Jǫtunheimʀ (rhoticism) < Jǫtunheimiʀ (syncopation) < Jǫtunhaimiʀ (i-umlaut) < Ētunhaimiʀ (breaking)    And so on in like fashion. (I am not a professional linguist and I’ll all but guarantee these phonological changes happened in a different order than I laid out, but I believe the processes are correct.) You’ll notice that these forms look rather different to the more familiar ones we’ve received from classical Icelandic. As we have absolutely no hard evidence for the Eddic cosmology around the time proto-Norse was in use, moreover, I’d urge you to consider getting them done in the Younger Fuþark – it could well be the Norse simply didn’t conceive of the cosmos in these terms several hundred years earlier.   If you do want to use the Elder Futhark, though, there’s really only one way to do it: the Y has no business being in there - it's a completely different sound (front rounded vowel) in proto-Norse and would never be confused with one of the sounds in ""haimiʀ.""  A few more thoughts:  ""Múspellsheimr"" is the only correct form of the name. ""Muspellheim"" is an Anglicanization.  ""Niðavǫllum"" is just an inflected form of ""Niðavellir:"" roughly, ""to (or towards) Niðavellir."""

I'm pretty dead-set on using the Elder Futhark, as I personally feel like it is the purest from of Runescript. Thank you for bringing the anachronism to my attention however, and I will consider researching the older forms of the world names.  At the end of the day I know that I can only be so authentic, so I will most likely settle on a compromise between historical accuracy and contemporary understanding."

If you want I can throw the classical Icelandic forms of the names into the Elder Fuþark for you sometime in the next few days (when I don't have a damn paper hanging over my head) with some reasonable certainty I'm doing it fairly correctly. I can also attempt to ""reconstruct"" the older names, though again, I'm just a grad student and linguistics isn't my main field, and you need be aware that that might be like trying to figure out how Chaucer would have spelled ""computer"": we can figure out how he would have pronounced the word, but it (probably!) wasn't something he ever said."

Norse,2vpi26,ConanofCimmeria,1 point,Fri Feb 13 03:55:00 2015 UTC,"Well, actually It would be Ansugarðaʀ, the word final z/ʀ never remains in the first word of a compound word. Also the A lengthened when the N was lost.  Etunhaimiʀ would also have a short vowel, not a long one. When the proto-indo-european accent system was lost the short stressed vowels broke. Also, I am not quite sure but I think Etunhaimiʀ would end with aʀ, not iʀ. -az/-aʀ nouns were very common."
Norse,2vmyei,saargrin,13,Thu Feb 12 09:28:35 2015 UTC,"They very likely did, though we have (to my knowledge) no explicit evidence for this. What we do have are some (non-native) accounts of this kind of behavior and some later saga sources that recall pre-battle rituals.  The first stopping point would definitely be the Roman historian Tacitus' Germania, as /u/workingboy noted. Tacitus, writing in the 1st century AD, claims that the Germanic peoples would beat their shields in praise of ""Hercules"" (possibly  some version of Thor - Tacitus was engaging in the practice of interpretatio romana). Tacitus is quite a problematic source, but we at least have some kind of evidence for a notion of divine intercession in battle or war.   Later on, we find lots of evidence for dancing figures, sometimes clutching spears and wearing helmets, who have been interpreted as warriors or shamans. The rather famous Migration era Torslunda helmet plates are one such example, showing armed figures in combat with animals, dancing,  wearing masks and animal skins etc. In the 10th century, we have an account from the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos in his Book of Ceremonies describing what he called a ""Gothic dance"" performed by the Varangian guard, involving masks, shouting and weapons. (Unfortunately there is no easily-available translation of the account in English.)  Recent research trajectories have focused a lot on shamanistic currents in Norse belief (see Neil Price's definitive The Viking Way,) which could do a lot to explicate this evidence. Evidence from comparative anthropology (as well as saga and folkloric evidence pertaining to wizards' magical journeys, the notion of the ""Finnshot"" etc.) would suggest that there was almost certainly an idea of symbolic contact with the spirit world, projection of the soul and taking on of animal essences. Probably the Norse warriors, in shouting, making noises and (perhaps) wearing animal skins, were hoping to become like wolves or bears - to take on aspects of their ferocity.  On a more practical level, this kind of display of group cohesion and aggression is extremely intimidating and can put one in an unusual frame of mind - we can even see this kind of psychological effect at work in, say, fight songs at sports events. If you'll permit some speculation on my part, this was probably the means by which berserks (if there ever was such a thing, which is controversial) entered into a frenzy in preparation for battle.  There are also (much later) saga sources discussing such things as the exchanging of insults before battle, which I could potentially pull up for you if you're interested.  As to whether there are ""standard texts"" or anything like that - nope. That sort of thing is unlikely to have been written down, and the notion of a ""standard text"" would almost certainly not have existed in this context within the largely preliterate culture of the Norse'."

Norse,2vmyei,_Habrok,6,Thu Feb 12 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of any 'standard' pre-battle rituals. I believe that, like with warriors of every historical period, most of them probably said a prayer to Odin, Thor or Tyr to ask for favour and honour in the coming battle."

Norse,2vmyei,cloudedice,3,Thu Feb 12 10:07:01 2015 UTC,Looking at the huge diversity in funeral rites I have a suspicion that ad hoc rituals before large engagements may have played a role. In that case they would probably have been tailored to the specific context and people. I don’t know if there is any written accounts on this however.
Norse,2vmyei,Ratatoskr-,3,Thu Feb 12 13:08:01 2015 UTC,Their swords were prone to bending so I doubt that would have happened.
Norse,2vmyei,cloudedice,3,Thu Feb 12 14:23:05 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't really bend the blade if you hit the pommel of the sword on the boss or front end of the sword. It is also easier on your arms to do that and get the same effect. Also you don't have to hit hard, the combined effect would have a terrible sound to about the same effect of causing dread in your enemies like the Rebel Yell."
Norse,2vmyei,Ratatoskr-,1 point,Thu Feb 12 17:24:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, their swords would have been more prone to break than bend. That's what made the Ulfberht so special: the purity of it's steel made it able to flex/bend in a way the average sword of the viking era just couldn't. It's gave the Ulfberht an advantage in battle because when stuck in a shield it would bend rather than break off."
Norse,2vmyei,cloudedice,1 point,Sat Feb 14 20:18:04 2015 UTC,"No, they would actually bend.   I think what you are referring to rigidity vs. flexibility, of which different steels have different values. Too much rigidity and the sword will shatter; too much flexibility and the sword won't hold it's desired shape (which was the problem with viking steel). It is based off of the impurities /additives of metal and the heat treating and tempering process."

Norse,2vmyei,necropants,6,Thu Feb 12 14:49:27 2015 UTC,There's no evidence whatsoever for this.
Norse,2vmyei,Sparrowhawk42,0,Thu Feb 12 15:12:06 2015 UTC,"There is certainly evidence of berserkers working themselves into a rage AND and the use of entheogens.   However, I doubt that psilocin was the hallucinogenic used. As one who has partaken of mushrooms and experienced combat (though not simultaneously), I can't say that one lends itself well to the other. They could have obviously been some form of hallucinogen we are no longer aware of of course, but I think we can safely say they were not the psilocybin of today. I am inclined to believe it was a concoction with Amanita muscaria as its main ingredient.   Most (if not all) cultures work themselves into a state of aggression and violence prior to armed conflict. The fact that the Norse method for doing so was recorded extensively by those they encountered on the battlefield (as well as their own oral lore-keepers) is an indication that it was something rather distinctive.   So, I don't know if I would say ""no evidence whatsoever."" Granted I am more of a practicing shaman than a Norse historian. I know how adamant modern academia is about denying historic drug use."
Norse,2vmyei,necropants,2,Thu Feb 12 16:12:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you but given the right amount of Psilocybe mushrooms I felt a rush of energy, lowered fatigue, heightened senses and better freedom of movement.

And while there can be some anxiety that accompanies the use of psilocin, this is not why I think it would be a sub optimal drug in order to achieve the state you describe. I am most dubious because the stark decline in one's Violence of Action when they are in touch with the sublime. As many times as I have attended shamanic retreats and engaged in ritual entheogen consumption I have never once witnessed aggression in the actions of any party. I think most human minds seem to respond to that substance with a profound realization of human ""interconnectedness"" and the desire for stillness and peace. That is not to say that such experiences cannot aid a warrior after the fact; however, I am hard-pressed to believe that this state would be desirable in the heat of combat."
Norse,2vmyei,Einar_Bellyshaker,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:26:35 2015 UTC,"This is true, mushrooms tend to make you feel more connected with your fellow humans, at least in the society we live in now. But imagine the brotherhood that is formed between these men on mushrooms and imagine how they can easily ""pep talk"" each other into going together and slaughtering their enemies. Charles Manson convinced his subjects into murdering people through LSD. Mushrooms just tend to show you what you seek, be it stillness/interconnectedness or complete chaos. I practice boxing and MMA a little bit(not saying it is the same), when I have taken mushrooms I get a really big longing to fight. Just for fun of course, not to assault someone but to fight with gloves and just try out my skills. Now imagine some guys that have trained with weapons with the intent of killing their foes all their lives, they all take mushrooms together before a big battle. I don't think they are going to feel more interconnected with the enemy side than they will to each other and fight that much harder as a result."
Norse,2vmyei,Subs-man,1 point,Fri Feb 13 16:42:57 2015 UTC,"I am really curious as to the evidence for the use of entheogens.

This aside, I am strongly inclined to believe there are no written records, finds in the archaeology, or anything else like that to support the notion of entheogens in a Norse context. If you could cite your sources, I'd be very grateful to be proven wrong.  I don't think it's fair to characterize academia as ""adamant... about denying historic drug use."" We have firm accounts of the Scythians smoking cannabis, the Aztecs using tobacco, and some Finnic peoples using fly agaric mushrooms (far more recently). No historian denies that. Academics DO want to see firm evidence, though, and modern people's equation of historical accounts of religious experience with their own experiences with entheogen use does NOT count as that."
Norse,2vmyei,LadyBijou,2,Fri Feb 13 01:29:47 2015 UTC,"I have found ritual drug use in nearly every culture I have encountered on 5 continents in my own life time. This is particularly true in cultures that live closer to the Earth and its cycles. The more dependent a society is on the Earth and its wild bounty the more likely it seems that they would encounter it's many mind-altering species.   I, personally, would need to see evidence that people didn't use entheogens as it is something that, once discovered, became spiritually significant to virtually every culture on the planet that did so. Furthermore, I am inclined to believe past cultures (including the Norse) were aware of combinations and concoctions that permit states beyond the few we are currently familiar with. I am hard-pressed to believe that in the extensive interactions and shared cultural lineage of the Germanic and Norse tribes there was not a single mind-altering ritual concoction known. Obviously, the knowledge of their creation would be fairly esoteric and maintained by the spiritual/shamanic 'class' so-to-speak, and would have likely been inaccessible to those creating a written record of the period (as a consequence of that written record being created by ""outsiders"").  There are shamans/healers/sadhus/priests practicing today that can create things for which there will be no written record in a millennium because the greater trend of modern society is to demonize and criminalize those who foray into that spiritual territory.  I hope it is clear that I was not criticizing you as a representation of academia's aversion to drugs in history. You seem like an open-minded seeker. Furthermore, you are absolutely right, there is no clear, written documentation of such things (for fairly intuitive reasons), but I have yet to encounter a tribal people living even slightly closer to the old ways that does not have such substances. It is difficult for me to imagine the Norse were any different. Especially considering that there are Pagan, Druid, and Asatru leaders today that know these things. I have not seen any indication that these are modern concepts inserted into their traditions as they are unique to their own practices and dissimilar to any modern ""recreational"" drugs in ingredients and preparation."

Religion prior to Christianity in the Scandinavian countries, tended more towards the personal, with archeological evidence suggesting that the only buildings dedicated to workshop were cult houses attached to great halls owned by wealthy families. Strong evidence suggests that groves of trees and waterways were important sites of worship instead of buildings. Not bloody temples."
Norse,2vavod,beloitpiper,5,Tue Feb 10 00:18:50 2015 UTC,"That was the general opinion in the archaeology as recently as a decade ago or two ago, but the general consensus now is that worship did begin to occur in temples starting c. the 6th cent. AD. There is actually now increasingly strong evidence for a temple at Uppsala, as well as other evidence of quite a large-scale cult, while a number of what appear to be more or less exclusively religious buildings have been found elsewhere throughout Scandinavia."

When I got mine the smell was pretty foul at first but faded after about an hour (I think being wrapped up made it more potent).  After a day or so it was just a faint cow smell which isn't even that bad.  Fill it with some beer or cider or something and the smell will start to pick up traces of those drinks, and it honestly kind of adds flavor to your drink.  Besides, you're drinking out of a horn, you shouldn't care about the smell.  Also, drink with the curved end of the horn pointing downwards.  People love to depict them pointing upwards, but gravity will mess you up when the liquid rushes down from the point.  And when you tilt it back down, the drink will splash back and slosh out of the horn.  Turning it so it points down counters both of these issues.  TL;DR a horn is totally usable as a drinking vessel so long as you aren't put off by the initial smell and don't drink with the curved end pointing straight up.  Edit: also there's Viking Shield which I have never used but seems pretty reputable.  I don't know where I got mine because it was a gift, but it was manufactured by hand in Scotland."

The crux of the Gothic migration would enter the Chernyakhov culture around the Black Sea, which was known as the region of Guthiuda by the Romans.

But I will still post my thoughts on this topic here.   First, the term Heathen is supposed to have historical roots, if this is true or not, I don't care. The term Ásatrú is also a modern invention.   Second, I don't use the term Ásatrú because it is so identified with Icelandic Heathenry and folkish Heathenry, I am neither of those.   Third, the term Ásatrú is overly connected to the Æsir, in my opinion, and does not as accurately describe my religious practice. The beings I am most connected with, and ones that are the primary focus of my religious practice, are my ancestors and the spirits of hearth and land. So the term Heathen (of the heath) is a much better fit for me and others like me.   Finally, while the term Ásatrú is both general and specific, I have noticed that people are using it in its general form les and less. Preferring instead to use the terms Heathen, Heathenism and Heathenry."

These include weapons such as longswords, rapiers, sword and buckler, greatswords, etc...  These are great resources many of which as as full and systematic as their asian counterparts.    Now for the bad news, there is not a single manual, treatise, or even so much a single actual descriptive passage on how vikings actually fought.  We hear how so and so was cleaved, hewn, or that a shield wall was used, but never a meaningful description of what that actually means from a technical sense.    A little more good news, a few very smart people with extensive experience working with sword and buckler, something we do have manuals for (including the oldest weapons manual to our knowledge) have been working backwards from what we know making an educated guess (rather than just making things up)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkhpqAGdZPc       In my advice if you're really feeling dedicated to doing this right, join the WMA forum and put some serious time in on learning sword and buckler (a buckler being a small boss held shield) first, then work on changing to the larger viking shields when you can actually make informed guesses, rather than making things up.

Norse,2ube6j,ellendar,2,Sat Jan 31 17:11:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for those links! Very cool!  Do you happen to know how much riding into battle on horseback was done by the Vikings?
Norse,2ube6j,vaguepagan,4,Sat Jan 31 18:55:47 2015 UTC,"Horseback combat was very unusual in Northern Europe in the Viking age. The Franks and cultures to the south and east fought on horseback but the Hiberno-Norse and Saxon cultures didn't, largely because of the very high cost of horses and their diminutive stature relative to war horses - they were essentially ponies.  Just a warning about the video he linked - let's just say I'd be delighted if I was facing someone who adopted a posture that simultaneously obscured half of their vision, tired out their shield arm and exposed half of their vital organs to my spear. There's no evidence they fought that way and as a guard it has substantial vulnerabilities.  If you want to learn to fight as a Viking might've, HEMA or WMA are ok options but both tend to neglect the most common weapons of the Viking era - the large round shield, the spear, and the axe. Period-specific reenactment groups might be a better bet (you can ask on /r/historicalreenactment or /r/reenactors about local groups) but the focus there is usually not on historical technique. Fighting techniques in games like combat reenactment are very heavily shaped by what areas count as a valid 'hit' and, in periods where armour covers (or, from an authenticity standpoint, should only cover) the torso, hips, and head, most groups only count the areas covered by T-shirt and shorts, leading to styles of fighting that expose the head, forearms (and in some groups, the upper arms) and lower legs in a way that would be fatal in a real fight. In addition, many groups don't allow spears, leading to both individual fights and battles that are far more derived in their martial style from that groups rules than they are from history.  ... I got a little side-tracked there, but it's worth bearing in mind as the parent comment said, nobody knows for sure how the Vikings or Saxons fought as they didn't write it down, but that doesn't mean that some people aren't almost certainly wrong."
Norse,2ube6j,Haereticus,2,Sat Jan 31 19:16:54 2015 UTC,"Re: shield stance - holding the shield in this fashion is directly attested in the I.33 Fechtbuch, the earliest ""combat manual"" we have, which provides instruction on sword & buckler combat and as such tends to be used heavily by people looking to recreate earlier combat techniques. Historical shields were typically far lighter than the ones modern reenactment groups use, which are created with an eye towards durability, while our sources suggest it was quite expected for shields to get smashed up in the course of a fight (this might have even been a design point - if your opponent's weapon gets caught in the edge of your shield, he's essentially at your mercy.) The few Viking-age shields we've found are typically chamferred to become extremely thin at the edges, making them quite light-weight and maneuverable and making it possible to react very quickly to incoming blows. I've tried SCA ""heavy combat"" a few times and know that such a stance would be impossible with the clunky shields that their rules require, but it's quite easily manageable with proper replicas - and that's not even taking the fact that medieval people tended to be rather heavily-muscled (by modern standards) into account. Moreover, both medieval combat manuals and the Icelandic sagas frequently describe shields being used offensively to strike at opponents - this, again, being facilitated by holding the shield in such a fashion.   Also, re: axes - the archaeological evidence suggests they were not a particularly common weapon. Bog depositions such as those at Thorsberg Mose in Denmark typically have axes and swords in roughly equal measure, both being VASTLY outnumbered by spears.  Finally, I'd just like to say that though WMA groups are far from perfect, they at least derive their study from actual historical documentation. I also find that their emphasis on fitness and tendency to require much less armor (compared to, say, the SCA, with its monstrously overbuilt armor rigs), as well as their often favoring steel blunts over rattan or what have you, make them far more useful (I would argue) for someone interested in gaining a serious understanding of historical combat techniques than reenactment groups."
Norse,2ube6j,ConanofCimmeria,2,Sat Jan 31 23:23:40 2015 UTC,"Am I correct in thinking I.33 shows a buckler being used like that? A buckler is used very differently to a large round shield - a solid defensive stance with a shield requires very little movement to protect every part of the body except the head and lower legs, whereas no matter where you hold a buckler you are going to have to have an extremely active defence. I agree that SCA shields, armour and rattan weapons bear little or no relevance to the study of historical martial arts - I didn't specify this in my post but I meant blunt steel reenactment, which is more-or-less the standard in Europe. A modern 9mm plywood shield, edged with sewn-on rawhide and with a metal boss and wooden handle, should not be expected to be substantially heavier than historical shields, which as you say would taper from thicker than 9mm near the boss to thinner than that at the edges. It's a fair point that people of the period, particularly professional warriors, would have had much greater stamina at holding their weapons up.   It's perfectly plausible that that stance could have been used, but they show only its strength - that strong strike at the face and shield-edge of a compliant opponent - and not its weaknesses. For example, the huge blind spot which could render them sensitive to feints to their left, or the fact that it's almost as vulnerable to a shield strike as the guard they contrast it against (which, as a side-note, is not a strong guard for duelling anyway). The strengths of that guards are maintained more or less completely by moving the shield down so it's upper left edge just covers the users shoulder, but this modification has the advantage of mitigating its weaknesses, like the occlusion of the field of view and the exposure of the abdomen. If you look at how they fight at the end using that guard, their movements seem uncontrolled and use much more movement than they need to, leaving gaping holes in their defence. An opponent who adopted a strong guard and sat in it, preventing their defence being breached with minimal movement, and waiting for an opening to appear that they could exploit without endangering themselves, could finish that fight quickly and fight a dozen more without tiring. They are applying buckler and sword techniques inappropriately to such a large shield.  I'm not criticising WMA/HEMA - their approach is (entirely justifiably) focused on disciplines for which extensive historical evidence is extant, but they don't, as far as I know, practice much with Viking age blades, which handle differently to later blades, nor do they usually practice with large round shields, axes, or spears (I can't comment on the relative frequency of swords vs axes but it is, as you say, important for the OP to remember that the weapon of the era was the spear). Another thing that they don't generally seem to engage with is battles - fighting as part of a shield-wall is almost an entirely different skill-set to duelling, and it's not entirely clear that duelling would be of much relevance to most Viking men, despite its prominence in the sagas. Again, not a criticism of WMA, it's prohibitively dangerous to attempt large-scale battles with authentic techniques, but it's something the OP might be interested in.  To sum up: reenactment has relevant weapons and battlefield combat but a general inattention to what is known about historical martial arts, while WMA/HEMA has an admirable focus on historical technique but typically doesn't focus on pre-12th century combat or equipment, because there exists very little relevant information."
Norse,2ube6j,Haereticus,2,Sun Feb 1 01:07:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, the I.33 is sword and buckler, which (as you pointed out) is only applicable to ""Viking"" shield combat in the most general sense.   Very good points regarding the weaknesses of that stance! I did you an injustice in assuming you subscribed to the notion of the shield as an immobile wall, held close to (or even against) the body, which a few reenactment groups tend to promote for reasons unclear to me. And I likewise have to admit I took you as a SCAdian on the basis of absolutely no evidence - my preconceptions as an erstwhile American showing through. Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa!"
Norse,2ube6j,ConanofCimmeria,1 point,Sun Feb 1 02:02:00 2015 UTC,"I'm relieved that we're in agreement. I believe the reason that the unrealistic guard you referred to is common in certain reenactment groups is because, like I said, their technique is shaped more by their rules of combat than by historical reality. In this case, I think it's principally because they don't take hits to any part of the arm, which means that hugging the shield close and flat to the body and extending the sword-arm straight out is a competitive stance. In real combat terms, of course, a stance like that would be absurd, as an important consideration in sword fighting is how to stop your opponent cutting your hand off. Another factor is that many groups (at least in the UK) don't use spears, or use really tiny ones. Allowing hits to the upper arms seems to encourage significantly more realistic combat, though of course cuts to the wrist and forearm are still not authentically restrictive."

It's also possible, and a more likely in my opinion, that it's not derived from that, but is simply a surname. ""-in"" and ""-lin"" are common endings in Swedish surnames. E.g. Berglin, Dahlin, Bohlin. Gamlin is somewhat unusual, but not unheard of. See for example Yngve Gamlin, a Swedish director.   I found some more info for you here:  https://www.flashback.org/t1349771  It may not Google translate very well, but the gist of it is that these names became common in the 18th century, when many people with older latinised names changed them to give them more of a French sound, which was in fashion at the time (Arbinius became Arbin, and so on). What may be of interest to you is that the last poster says names ending in ""-in"" for some reason became very popular in the Swedish Ångermanland and Medelpad provinces. Do you know where your family is from?  If Gamlin is one of these names, it would be pronounced with an emphasis on the second syllable in Swedish - ""Gahm-LEEN""."

Brittany is likely to have been Bertangaland, apparently (it looks to be more influenced by Old French to me).  In general the Nothern Isles were called Norðreyjar.

It should be noted that the name ""Caledonia"" seems to predate the Viking age quite a bit, and that the local inhabitants of that neck of the woods were probably calling themselves something quite different at that point. If you want to go that route, though, I'd also advise that the ""-mark"" suffix seems a little semantically off, since it has the sense of a forest, while the Scottish highlands were already pretty deforested by the time the Norse rolled in. If you really like the name though, I would render it Kaldmǫrk (or Kaldmörk,) since in normalized Old Icelandic orthography the C isn't used. Or you could just go for Kaldland."

We grow up with these stories and we know our ancestors here did too, folk belief has been very important up just 50-100 years ago. Why do you feel more drawn to Scandiavian gods rather than those of your ancestors?   Some vikings were mixed, one famous viking had a Siberian mother for example. It wasn't the norm, but it wasn't that uncommon. It was usually noteworthy when it was something that exotic and he was called Heljarskinn which means black skin.

That's been the subject of increasing scholarly attention of late, and the consensus emerging is that it played quite a large role in its evolution. How about the foregrounding of Odin over time and the construction of heathen temples? Modern scholarship regards these elements in belief as more than likely having developed in reaction to Christianity. What period are we focusing on as purely ""Germanic?"" The Bronze Age? (How then do we explain cultural links between the moundbuilding cultures surrounding the North Atlantic world - Britain, France etc?) And moreover, what is the means of transmission of ""belief?"" Is it genetic? It's been known for a while now that the DNA of the inhabitants of the British isles shows that they're primarily of pre-Celtic extraction, converting to various belief systems (from British to Celtic to Germanic to Christian) as various other ethnic groups assumed political control. Moreover, why are we focusing on any one particular time period? As a Scandinavian, your ancestors were Christians for at least the past 800 years or so, and 2000-3000 years ago practiced a religion that would look EXTREMELY different to the classical mythology that we've received from Snorri or the Poetic Edda.

While I see where this point of view is coming from, I have to disagree. My view is that anyone willing to open their mind to a new way of thinking and start a journey into another religion (for lack of a better term) should be welcomed with open arms.

Norse,2u93ho,ErinnThorsdatter,1 point,Sat Jan 31 21:47:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of what we do is cultural and has some ammound of symbolism to it.   True, but symbolism isn't really what I have a problem with.   Whether we continue it because it's enjoyable or teaches a lesson doesn't matter, it's part of what makes a society different than another.   Differences between societies help foster in-group, out-group mentalities too, though. It also quickly leads to persecution of people who aren't 'true' members of a society, for not sticking closely enough to tradition. But then, I think we as people have this sort of in-built tendency towards organizing our social lives in concentric circles where we are individually the center of our own existence, and the first ring around us is usually close family, then close friends, then distant family, and more friends, then people you know a bit, and so forth, so I don't think it's fair to blame it completely on cultural tradition, but well, I do think it brings more bad than good, to be honest.  Fortunately we live in a time when it's getting steadily more acceptable to be individualistic. You can listen to the music you like, read the books you like, watch the movies you like, eat the food you like, celebrate whatever holidays you like, etc. It's not a case of having to go with the herd as much, out of fear of being ostracized, which has historically been a very real concern for many people.  Still, you often get absurd superstitions getting in the way of progress. The faithful tend to block stem cell research, reproductive rights, equal human rights for all, clean energy advances, vaccines, medical science in general, blocking medical research on currently illegal drugs, and a number of other things.  These people also tend to make the argument that Josef Mengele did horrible things in the name of medical science, so therefore blocking stem cell research is fine, as if there's a connection there, or they point to soviet russia, or communist china and say: these people weren't religious, and caused more deaths than anyone else ever did, a lot of it through failed science - agricultural plans that failed and caused dozens of millions of people to starve to death. They'd also point to the statistics showing that the faithful donate more to charity, and use that as an argument for how they're more moral.  Still, on the whole it looks like the less religious a country is, the more likely it is to do well, and for it's people to be happy. There are exceptions, but it seems to be the trend.   Even having the goal of appearing dignified would be done with symbolism seeing as dignity is not too different than being spiritual or cultural, and different cultures have different views of dignity.   I suppose, but just think about this: Imagine aliens visited earth and introduced themselves, and they were essentially on par with current day humans, and they were taken into a building with an elevator, and suddenly had a panic attack because they saw there was a 27th floor of the building, and that this number was bad luck. Then they enter a room, and they take out a pouch of some strange dust and start scattering it around them. When asked why, they explain: Oh it's to ward off invisible micropiglets.  I mean, this is the level of insanity a lot of human traditions and superstitions exhibit, without an ounce of shame. So well, I think it would be a good idea to leave them behind, and act as adults, essentially.  Doing something because it's always been done isn't a good reason to keep doing something. Just look at ancient Egypt for example, they pissed away colossal amounts of wealth to give their pharaoh a proper send off. That wealth could have been used in the there and then, to better the lives of the people in the area. Instead it was just buried in what's essentially a glorified hole in the ground, and left for plunderers to discover later on.  I just think that we're in a junction of technological progress, and clinging to the past, where we should think hard about whether it's a good idea to keep clinging to the past in the way we do. I mean, in so many ways we've moved on. We no longer attribute disease to evil spirits (at least most of us don't), we no longer sacrifice human beings to make sure the sun gets up tomorrow morning, we no longer believe that if we sail westwards, we'll eventually fall off the face of the earth, and we no longer believe the stars are fireflies stuck to a firmament suspended just a few thousand feet above ground. This is because we've learned. Just like our ancestors learned that bronze is a pretty darn useful thing to have, and like we don't still stick with 56k modems just because we used to.  We're much more comfortable making progress about things that were invented in our own lifetime, but we're a lot more reluctant to let certain aspects of our distant past just stay in the books and the museums, where I think they rightfully belong.  We're not norsemen anymore. Most of them would have killed to be able to live like we do, so why are so many of us nostalgic for those days?"

Its about continuing my families traditions and, even though we can't continue the exact indigenous religion our pre-Christian ancestors practiced because it was wiped out, a reconstructed form of our religion.  I'm still looking for a community to practice with, but I've met many people in my community who I might practice with, given time. I'm still looking because although I might agree with a certain group's practice and ideology, I just don't quite fit in with some group's social dynamics. I think that's the challenge for all Asatruar, when it comes down to it. And frankly, for all people with a desire to follow a religious path. I know that when I was Catholic, I didn't like every church I went to, even though they were Catholic churches. You need to find the community that is right for you, even if there are many communities that use the name ""Asatru"" not all of them will be right for you. If just one is, that is enough.

Norse,2u03r9,OK_just_the_tip,5,Wed Jan 28 20:42:44 2015 UTC,"Are you asking what these ring forts were used for? Or are you asking why they were made the way they were?   Trelleborg-type fortresses were mainly for military use, as the barrack-like buildings inside the ramparts attest to. There are also traces of workshop production that reveal such fortresses were self sufficient. Not everyone agrees though; Else Roesdahl (1987) made a strong case that these forts were built more for symbolic status of the creator - of the financier, King Bluetooth perhaps. Roesdahl puts forth the idea that the forts were used for many different reasons, most importantly in times of emergency, but also used as winter camps for the Viking fleet.   I'd suggest reading the references linked within that Wiki article. Specifically #8 Margareta Weidhagen-Hallerderdt's ""A Possible Ring Fort from the Late Viking Period in Helsingborg"" from Current Swedish Archaeology issue 17. It's a massive ""article"" (read: book) with a wealth of information that'd probably help with better understanding the purpose of the ring fortresses, mainly through the archaeological record. For further reading I'd recommend Niels Peter Stilling (1981) and Sven Rosborn (2004).  Edit: I'll add some links to the other sources I recommended once I get home (no sleep + 2 hour drive back, ugh).

Norse,2td8lq,H8Blood,3,Fri Jan 23 06:59:33 2015 UTC,"There are some historical things I'd include.  Several Things (Scandinavian/Icelandic legislatures) had a really cool position called Lawspeaker. Lawspeakers had to recite the laws passed by the Thing. Their exact role varied, at times becoming something akin to a prime minister. Whether as part of a Kingdom or a Norse republic they are an interesting addition to any ""Viking"" setting.  Iceland was quasi-anarchic, with competition between communities over best protection of rights and property. With little central authority they still managed quite successfully.  Even though monarchy was often truly hereditary in the Norse world, at least as often it was elective. Prospective kings would require the support of nobles and commoners alike to rise to rulership. This reflects the tribal, as opposed to feudal, organization of society.  Temples to the gods would flesh out the setting.  Shieldmaidens existed historically. Female warriors served in several Norse armies, including a ""Varangian"" army that fought and lost to the Byzantines in modern Ukraine.  Including non-norse Germannic pagans, like the Saxons prior to Charlemagne or the Anglo-Saxons before their Christianization, and Finno-Ugric peoples like Saami and Finns could provide interesting ""other"" peoples. Kievan Rus and Miklgard (Constantinople) are also good sources of inspiration. The coolest source for inspiration, in my mind, comes from a saga about Vinland, featuring ""Skraelings"" who were fierce warriors, presumably Native American.    For mythological creatures, sea serpents, particularly dragon like ones, would be appropriate. Ice giants are featured in the Eddas. The Kraken was traditionally a gargantuan crab.  Regardless of what you do include, Norse culture revolved around maritime and commerce to a huge extent, more so than raiding. Raiding and trading built off of one another."

I can't say if it's definitely the correct explanation or not, however I think it fits well.  I saw the pictures OP mentioned of Gungnir with three prongs (usually with the main middle spear more defined, and the two side ""prongs"" as a type of ornamentation; but also sometimes as a proper trident) and noticed that the great majority were depicted in comic book style art. So I looked more into modern comic books as the original source. I couldn't find any references to Gungnir being three pronged in the ancient lore, anyway.   Marvel featured Gungnir as a three pronged spear/trident in a fictional universe based on weaving elements of Nordic lore with superhero stories and classic comic book cheesiness.    Gungnir is the Spear of Odin and is also referred to as the ""Spear of Heaven"". It is an ancient weapon made of the Uru metal which was unique to the Asgardian Dimension. The three-pronged spear is of unknown origin, and predates the last three incarnations of Odin himself. ~excerpt from the linked Marvel webpage    Okay, well, moving quickly along I managed to find more evidence on a Marvel Wiki-type Page  http://marvel.wikia.com/Gungnir_(Spear) that the very first appearance of Gungnir as a trident/three pronged Spear in that comic book context was in Thor #275, released September 1978. I am thinking this could be the original source for the 3 pronged Gungnir images and explain why modern Marvel movie Thor would have Odin wielding a historically (mythologically?) incorrect Gungnir as well.   Thoughts?   Edit to add: Those comic-lore articles are worth reading just for the laugh, even if this isn't the real answer :P I have no clue what would explain it if not this, though..."

Norse,2t4xiw,VaneFreja,6,Wed Jan 21 14:33:55 2015 UTC,Genetics and time. Almost a year and a half of waiting.  And not catching it on fire when you are cooking or camping.  That has happened to me and I had to start over and that is the result of this one.  Would be a lot longer if I didn't have to shave after the fire flared up.

Norse,2t7vlx,YouTookMyNameDamnit,5,Wed Jan 21 22:04:07 2015 UTC,This is the first of a series of lectures by Professor Neil Price on Medieval Scandinavia. This first vid answers your questions in a really interesting in-depth context. One of the most important things this lecture does is separate what we actually know about medieval Scandinavians from what we have made up. It's a great series and great for someone who is new to medieval Scandinavian history and Norse Mythology. Enjoy!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJZBqmGLHQ8
Norse,2t7vlx,RedOrm2,3,Wed Jan 21 23:50:27 2015 UTC,"Seconded. This stuff may well have all been an assemblage of Snorri's, a rather over-reaching attempt to assemble many separate (and mutually contradictory!) pieces into one coherent whole. The biggest crime against good scholarship peddlers of pop. mythology perpetrate (hah!) is depicting this stuff as though it's coherent."
Norse,2t329i,Vaaiko,4,Tue Jan 20 19:58:46 2015 UTC,Móðr have both meaning as fury/frenzy and being tierd.   But the word you are looking for could be * drumroll *   Óðr.
Norse,2t329i,Solmundarson,1 point,Tue Jan 20 22:03:57 2015 UTC,I thought Óðr meant furious rather than fury as a noun?
Norse,2t329i,EldritchBug,1 point,Wed Jan 21 05:43:52 2015 UTC,"I thought ""ákafr"" was ""furious""?"
Norse,2t329i,Argit,2,Wed Jan 21 11:25:30 2015 UTC,Ákafr is more like a mix between intense and eager.
Norse,2t329i,EldritchBug,1 point,Wed Jan 21 13:34:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, started learning old Norse only a few weeks ago XD, but I have already noticed some differences in the translation of various words. I'll add this one to my notebook."
Norse,2t329i,Argit,1 point,Thu Jan 22 00:49:21 2015 UTC,"That is correct. The noun that would come from the adjective óðr would rather be æði. You could say for example: ""Æði greip hann"" <-- roughly translates as ""Fury caught him"" = basically he was caught in a fury. But It doesn't sound good to say ""Hann er æði"". It just doesn't fit. Sounds weird and can have different meanings too. I'd rather use heift or bræði like I said in another comment here."
Norse,2t329i,Solmundarson,1 point,Wed Jan 21 13:38:28 2015 UTC,Óðr have many many meanings. Frenzy is one of them.
Norse,2t329i,RedOrm2,2,Wed Jan 21 23:56:27 2015 UTC,"Here is how the word is used in Hrana saga Hrings   ""Var nú Hrani mjök móðr, enn lítt sár"""
Norse,2t329i,Argit,2,Tue Jan 20 22:12:28 2015 UTC,"It's basically when you are breathing so heavily you can't hardly speak - which is always when you're tired. The word ""móða"" meaning mist/blur is related. When you are ""móðr"" and near a glass window, ""móða"" will form on the glass."
Norse,2t329i,Argit,1 point,Tue Jan 20 22:15:49 2015 UTC,"So if it has two meanings, then it's open to interpretation/context?  The whole sentence would be ""he is fury"" , fury being a noun there,  but that could be taken as ""he is tired""?"
Norse,2t329i,Argit,1 point,Wed Jan 21 05:46:22 2015 UTC,"I would actually be more inclined to interpret it ""he is tired"". Mind you, it's not just tired, the meaning is a bit more focused than that. Like tired can mean just ""sleepy"" etc or tired after a long day, while you only get ""móðr"" when you have been exercising your body in one way or another."
Norse,2t329i,Solmundarson,1 point,Wed Jan 21 08:06:29 2015 UTC,So there is no translation that makes sense for what I want to write?
Norse,2t329i,ConanofCimmeria,1 point,Wed Jan 21 10:01:28 2015 UTC,"You want to write ""He is fury"" ? As in he is the fury?  I would rather use the word ""Heift"" or maybe ""Bræði""."
Norse,2supko,ArcaneNight,1 point,Sun Jan 18 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"Valhalla is probably the most important place in Asgard. Others include Folkvang/Sessrumnir, Bilskirnir, Breidablik, Glitnir, the Walls of Asgard, Amsvartnir, and Bifrost"

Norse,2supko,Odinswolf,1 point,Sun Jan 18 19:23:56 2015 UTC,"Ragnarok is the obvious one, being the death of most of the gods and the destruction and recreation of the worlds. Besides that the Aesir-Vanir war is of great importance. The death of Baldr sets up Ragnarok. The binding of Fenrir is important. The death of Ymir and the creation of Midgard are of vital importance, along with the creation of the ljosalfar, dvergar, and Ask and Embla. Odin has a lot of very important events, mostly centered around gaining knowledge. When his ravens were lost, then came back with words of doom, he stared into the eyes of Skuld and subsequently tore out his own eye to cast into the Well of Mimir. He also hung upon Yggdrasil for nine days and nine nights, and stole the mead of poetry. The theft of the Golden Apples of Idun is good to know. Also, Thor and Loki's acquisition of Thjalfi and subsequent trip to Utgard are important. The theft of his hammer and subsequent slaying of the Jotun Thrym are good. Finally I would add in the building of the walls of Asgard/origin of Sleipnir."
Norse,2sqxc9,RedOrm2,4,Sat Jan 17 17:25:59 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert in Medieval or Old-Norse studies, however I've do have an interest in it & from some searching on various different aspects of the Vikings I come across these:  The Cambridge History of Scandinavia: Volume 1. Prehistory to 1520 it's a anthological survey book consisting of both historiographical and hagiographical (biographies of saints) primary & secondary sources ranging from prehistory ( before historical events were documented) through to medieval history of Scandinavia. It's quite pricey but definitely worth the money if your serious...   The first part of the volume surveys the prehistoric and historic Scandinavian landscape and its natural resources, and tells how man took possession of this landscape, adapting culturally to changing natural conditions and developing various types of community throughout the Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. The rest - and most substantial part of the volume - deals with the history of Scandinavia from the Viking Age to the end of the Scandinavian Middle Ages (c. 1520). The external Viking expansion opened Scandinavia to European influence to a hitherto unknown degree. A Christian church organisation was established, the first towns came into being, and the unification of the three medieval kingdoms of Scandinavia began, coinciding with the formation of the unique Icelandic 'Free State'.   The History of Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Denmark,Finland and Iceland) is similar to Cambridge History yet significantly cheaper  The Viking World by Stefan Brink & Neil Price is a mid-range anthological book compromising of many articles from various scholars.    I  would really appreciate material that covers linguistics.....philology, morphology and the like As for the other categories, I would really appreciate some introductory material on archaeology.   This book will probably be the best one for you because it includes all of the above.  Myth and Religion of the North: the Religion Ancient Scandinavia this book is a good overview of the different mythologies before the christianisation of the nordics.  Women in the Viking Age is a good book on the niche subject area of Women roles within the viking age nordics & its various colonies (from Greenland to Russia). Jesch uses various pieces of evidence from archaeological finds, runic inscriptions, historical records & Old Norse literature.  I would also recommend you look into the Icelandic sagas & Eddas. I'd use SagaDB because there are many various different icelandic sagas & in a variety of languages including English, Icelandic & Old Norse.  If you'd like to go about learning O.N. you check the Viking Society for Northern Research  or check out the books: A New Introduction to Old Norse: I Grammar: 1 or Viking Language 1: Learn Old Norse, Runes, and Icelandic Sagas   If you're interested at all in the presence of the Vikings (and later scandinavians) in Eastern Europe check out Viking Rus: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe  Hopefully this helps if you have any more specific questions don't be afraid to ask :)"

Norse,2sqxc9,ConanofCimmeria,3,Fri Jan 23 00:14:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm... There's a massive book (similar to the Cambridge History) on the processes of conversion that I think is a really good starting point for that really important aspect of the history. I don't recall the name and I'm on mobile, but I do know the editor's name is Nora Berend. (It might be called Christianization and the Rise of Christian Monarchy. I guess Elsa Roesdahl's The Vikings is a standard introduction, but I've never read it in its entirety and I think the Brink & Price volume does just as good a job, if not better. If you're interested in the situation pre-Viking Age, Malcolm Todd's The Early Germans is quite readable and very good. On the literary side, I think the Penguin Sagas of Icelanders is an essential investment - it's only like 30 bucks and its got good, modern translations, unlike the dated (but nonetheless serviceable!) translations you linked to. I'm a big fan of HE Davidson's introductory works on mythology, among them Gods and Myths of the North, even if they are starting to show their age. Eventually everyone wants to read the Eddas, and I think Anthony Faulke's translation of the Prose Edda is very good, and Lee Hollander's translation of the Poetic Edda is decent (though I understand there's a much better new translation due out soon; I don't recall the translator's name.) For more information on the literary side of things, the Blackwell Companion to Old Icelandic Literature is very thorough and informative, if a bit of a slog. The standard Old Norse textbook is still EV Gordon's, though copies are (apparently) getting pricier. Barnes' is great too, though. I haven't read Byock's but I'm not typically a huge fan of his. And if you are looking for a dictionary, Geir Zoëga's is the standard one for students. (It's all available online, easily accessible via Google.) Other fun stuff... Alaric Hall has lots of wonderful stuff freely available via his website, to do with mythology, folklore and linguistics. Kvideland & Sehmsdorf's Folk Belief and Legend is just all kinds of fun (even if post-Viking age, often by quite a lot) and Stephen Mitchell's work is also fascinating, though I'm drawing a blank on the one book title of his I'd particularly recommend. (Magic and Witchcraft in Scandinavia?)  As for myself, I did my undergrad in history (with an emphasis on the 19th century, weirdly enough, because our department didn't offer much medieval stuff) and folkloristics (with an emphasis in Scandinavia.) I'm now working in both, but I'm particularly interested in sort of Grand Narrative questions to do with the development of the State and related institutions and the (somewhat wankily-titled) ""History of Ideas,"" as well as medieval and early modern Scandinavian folklore. My particular area of geographic interest is Sweden and the Baltic, but I'm doing my studies in Iceland so getting lots of West Norse stuff is pretty inescapable. :P"
Norse,2sqxc9,Subs-man,3,Fri Jan 23 00:54:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for replying! :), Everything you've mentioned seems really interesting I'll definitely check them out & I'm jealous that you get to study in Iceland. Talar þú íslensku?"

Norse,2sqxc9,ConanofCimmeria,5,Thu Jan 22 17:31:22 2015 UTC,"It's a great introduction for sure and wonderfully readable, but I strongly disliked his thesis of top-down introduction of Christianity via the monarchy and the way he all but refused to consider evidence such as burials, etc. as indicating diffusion through the ""lower classes"" (though of course that kind of evidence from archaeology is hugely difficult to interpret in historical context.) I think recent scholarship has started to look a lot more at women's roles, in particular, in the conversion process. I suspect that will be a very productive line of inquiry. I have to admit I've read nothing else of his.   Like I said, though, extremely nice man, with an endearing accent. When I saw him at a conference recently he had a different bowtie every day. If that's not dedication I don't know what is."

Especially to the soldier in question."

Norse,2ryyqm,doktor_steflon,3,Sat Jan 10 16:11:16 2015 UTC,"I'll copy and paste what I wrote down in a different thread  First of, the Vegvísir you posted is not correct. Here's a difference between the popular version you find online (left) and the correct version (right) as found in the Huld Manuscript. Given the subtleties of both the Rune and the Ogham alphabets, the addition or subtraction of a single line can completely change the meaning of a stave so one should strive to use the correct version. Another thing to note here is that the original charm is made to fit in a square rather than a circle. That means that the staves of the charm at 2, 5, 7 and 10 o'clock are longer than the others so as to fit into the imagined corners of the square. However, little change is made to the power of the charm by making the staves all the same length. This effectively fits the charm inside a circle. There is no change to the charm because the symbols themselves have not changed.  Concerning the circle in the middle and the individual staves.  The middle circle is a representation of the self; you are at the vortex of the runic power. When there is no circle, it is understood that the center is you. Similarly, when the circle is present, but empty, the meaning is the same: you are the center. The only time the charm changes is if the circle is filled with a symbol indicating that charm holder is not the center. That is, if you wanted the charm to be active for someone other than the one who holds it (like your family, brother, lover, whoever). In that case, you would gain consent to work the charm, and then you would craft a rune representing the person, and put that in the center.  Sadly the meaning of the individual staves is not known. The Huld manuscript is just a collection of mystical charms and sigils but there's no description of the individual staves.  There's also not much known about if there's a correct order to draw the staves. Because it is not given, it either means that there is no particular order, or that the order was an understood practice.  Using principles of contemporary paganism, one could start in either ""the North"" or ""the East"" of the charm, and move deosil until all staves are crafted.  It is speculated that the symbols found in the Huld manuscript are created in much the same method as bind runes, but instead using the Ogham tree alphabet.  Hope this helps!"

(source:  Tormod Torfæus' Historia Rerum Norvegicarum)"

Norse,2rl19x,skadee,5,Wed Jan 7 09:45:46 2015 UTC,"Thralldom was indeed a form of slavery, with some minor differences from what we think of when we hear the word slavery today. Some thralls were people who were in debt, and thus forced into something resembling indentured servitude, while others were prisoners of war or common folk abducted for free labour or to be sold at slave markets.   A thrall had a ""man's price"", and couldn't be killed or hurt without consequence. Þingvellir, the site of the first Icelandic Althing, used to be the land of a local lord who was banished to outlawry for killing a thrall.  Thralls often wore a metal ring around their neck; a freed thrall was known as a ""free-neck"" (frihals, in Norwegian). The Norwegian word for salvation (frelse) actually comes from the christian term for frihals. This makes sense considering the first christian priests of Norway might have been more like thralls to their bishops than free and respected members of society (this is judging from the way the priests are referred to in early Norwegian laws; with terms similar to those used to refer to thralls).  The mark I mention in my previous comment was a measure of weight: about 107 grams of silver, the equivalent of 240 pennings. The plural form of the word penning is the origin of the Norwegian and Swedish words for money (penger/pengar)."

It discusses the book's representation of the Aesir and the Norse mythic cycle. On the whole it doesn't sound like a recommendation.

Norse,2rbms8,Quietuus,4,Sun Jan 4 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"The more general term for symbols of this type is a 'sunwheel'. Like the solar cross and swastika symbols (which it is a variation on) it comes in many different forms, some with particular associations to various far right or occult groups, though the ban on the use of the original 45 degree angled Nazi hakkenkreuz in much of Europe has led countless neo-nazi splinter factions to adopt variations on this symbol (as well as other related symbols like the triskele) so I wouldn't be too cautious about it. My guess would be that the person who created the image in the OP either removed the central circle to turn the symbol into a 'moonwheel', or it's just a standard variation and they're doing a sun/moon dichotomy thing."

Norse,2qwhbe,snbrgr,2,Wed Dec 31 15:58:24 2014 UTC,"In icelandic it would sound like this, more or less: ""Væri höfðum tveim hent hátt upp í tré gætu þau aðeins bruggað launráð með vindinum"". Never heard this expression btw and don't know anything about old norse.  I think your translation looks good, but maybe ""varpað"" would look better than ""köstuð""."
Norse,2qwhbe,Monaco-Franze,4,Wed Dec 31 17:44:00 2014 UTC,"Ah, good you provided the Icelandic translation; so in Old Norse it would become:  ""Væri hǫfðum tveim (afskornum) kastat/varpat hátt upp í tré gæti þau at eins bruggat launráð með vindinum.""  Don't know about varpa/kasta. The meaning ""to throw"" for ""henda"" is modern Icelandic, though. In old Norse ""henda"" means 1. to touch; 2. to concern; 3. to happen.  edit: ""kastat/varpat"", not ""kastað/varpað"""
Norse,2qwhbe,snbrgr,2,Wed Dec 31 18:04:33 2014 UTC,There are so many synanoms in old norse and icelandic. Henda also means this in icelandic but also can mean to throw.

Norse,2qwhbe,Alcalhrad,2,Wed Dec 31 17:49:45 2014 UTC,"""Tvau"" is the neuter form of ""tveir"". Because ""hǫfuð"" is a neuter word, ""tveir"" as its attribute has to be in its neuter form as well.   ""Afskorin"" is the neuter plural past participle form of ""skera af"", to cut off.   The standard notation for Old norse ""tré"" is definitely this form with an acute accent; I've never seen a circumflex in an old Norse text.  Also, I changed the text a little. I would go for the old Norse version of u/Monaco-Franze's translation below. It literally translates to ""If two (cut off) heads would be thrown upp high in a tree, they could only scheme with the wind."""

Norse,2qv54h,SigurthrEnterprises,2,Wed Dec 31 02:47:14 2014 UTC,"In my personal experience, I have found mild steel to be the least threat in terms of allergies. I have had reactions to pewter and bronze and brass. The only thing that works for me is steel.   Now, torcs are extremely hard to make to keep them in the price range I operate within. I don't know how Wulfhund does it; whether it's with a cast or not (I highly doubt he hand forges them). If I were to cast anything my prices would fly through the roof. As of right now, I sell the least expensive custom hammers on Etsy, and have for some time. I take pride in that; it's the whole reason I started my shop to begin with.  Maybe in the future when I am more established will I create casts and work towards that; however right now that's not an option I'm willing to pursue."
Norse,2qv54h,SigurthrEnterprises,1 point,Wed Dec 31 02:34:21 2014 UTC,"Interesting. I've never worn mild steel so I don't know how I'd tolerate it. I know that my wife cannot tolerate most steels due to a severe nickel allergy though, even ""stainless"" cutlery. As for myself I have extremely acidic skin, and the only metal allergy I have is Zinc, so most metals will corrode badly when in prolonged contact but pose me no harm. I wear copper and silver now, but have worn bronze, tin, and pewter in the past.  Copper and Bronze oxidize and corrode quickly, leaving green residue behind. With pure copper the residue washes away easily and the piece polishes up with just a soft cloth or abrasive soap. Bronze darkens and takes some real effort to clean and polish. I have a mjolnir I love that is made of bronze but I won't wear it anymore because it is damn near impossible to clean the intricate carving.  I have a few medallions made of pewter that I used to wear but over time they darkened to a near jet black, and I haven't found a nondestructive polishing means that will clean them.  I have a cloissone medallion made of pure tin that has nearly no signs of wear other than some mild pitting. Tin jewelry seems to be rare despite the ease of working the metal and relative inexpense. Obviously it wouldn't lend well to delicate work given its metallurgical properties, and you'd have to watch the alloying components (100% pure is almost never available outside of a lab because of ""tin pest""), but it seems like a worthwhile avenue of exploration to me should you get into carving or casting. Being a white metal I don't think it is forgeable (but I could be wrong).  I totally understand wanting to stay with forged metals though, casting is an immense task to take up.  Another thought is to forge with copper, clean with acid, and then electroplate with silver. Involved, yes, but would yield a superior product too."
Norse,2qv54h,marcelmiranda,2,Wed Dec 31 04:01:10 2014 UTC,"I've never worn mild steel so I don't know how I'd tolerate it. I know that my wife cannot tolerate most steels due to a severe nickel allergy though, even ""stainless"" cutlery.   Mild steel contains no zinc in it; it is on the lower end of the carbon steels. Higher carbon steels tend to contain more zinc to keep them harder and more resistant to corrosion.  For cleaning my pewter jewelry I used to wear, I used a wire brush and lightly brushed it. I also showered with them regularly to keep them clean. If anything, they got brighter instead of darker.  I would love to work with bronze or copper; if I could salvage some pieces, I would attempt something. Until then, I won't buy a chunk to experiment with. It's just too expensive. I am a welder by trade so steel is easily available to me, and scrap steel in just ridiculously cheap hence my prices.  I have never worked with tin, but I have always wanted to. My only issue is it's extreme softness. When I make a pendant of steel, I know I am the only person who can shape it unless they put it to flame. With tin, all they have to do is mistreat it and it'll change shape. That's really my only issue with it.  But moving forward, I'd like to try different oxides with steel, like black oxide. In technical terms, I'm letting it rust, but the acids involved allow it to turn to a certain colour. Black oxide is a pretty simple process, but adds a cool effect."
Norse,2qv54h,marcelmiranda,1 point,Wed Dec 31 04:11:28 2014 UTC,"Right, I didn't mean that I'd have a reaction to the mild steel, more that it would corrode quickly on me, perhaps with a lot of rust formation.  Yeah, copper is getting very pricey these days, thats for sure. If you do ever try some Tin, keep the designs chunky and post the results. Perhaps a wrist torc like yours but in tin would hold up well. It would certainly be easy to adjust to fit. You'd have to have a disclaimer for customers to not ruin tin pieces though, for sure."

A bulky and lonely mjolnir pendant on a leather strap will never do. If you have the tools and the knowledge then woven wire bracelets and chokers in norse patterns would probably sell as well. Make them airy and simple with a few detailed areas and maybe a stone or carved pendant. Wouldn't hurt to figure out what sort of colors and jewelry looks are in fashion currently.

He also described people such as ""niggers"", ""mulattoes"" and Muslims as ""subhuman"".   In 2008, when asked about these controversial statements in Rock Hard magazine, Gaahl explained:     In the early '90s, there were all these different youth gangs in Norway and one thing led to another. I was involved in gang fights and had false friends ... There was no political disposition – not with me nor any of my friends.

Gaahl: ""Sure, no problem.""  Rock Hard: When I met you, we talked pretty extensively about an old JUDAS PRIEST live video that had made a strong impression on you. Was Rob Halford coming out a partial factor in your publicly acknowledging your own sexual preference?  Gaahl: ""No. Rob Halford is a big musical inspiration for me, but nothing more. It doesn't feel to me as if I've outed myself because up until now the whole thing was a non-issue for me. All this evolved very naturally. I feel how I feel and I've never made any secret about it.""  Rock Hard: But there are people that do not accept homosexuality. Isn't it true that you were in fact attacked by someone in the backstage area at Wacken [Open Air festival in Wacken, Germany]?  Gaahl: ""That's something that went down behind my back. Nobody has ever said anything derogatory to my face in person.""  Rock Hard: But King (GORGOROTH bassist) witnessed something and told me about it later (Note: there was a vicious brawl backstage at Wacken, which involved King among others. It was reportedly triggered by anti-gay remarks by a certain person who found himself in a hospital shortly thereafter). How are people treating you?  Gaahl: ""Absolutely positive. I haven't felt any animosities directed toward me.""  Rock Hard: But there are likely people on the right fringe of the black metal scene for whom you as an avowed homosexual have become an enemy.  Gaahl: ""Possibly, yes. My idea of art, and black metal especially, is the depiction of honesty without compromise. I really don't care how other people react to it or the feelings it might provoke.""  Rock Hard: There are people who were previously close to you that have contacted Rock Hard over the past few months offering ""information"" that would purportedly make you appear in a ""whole new light."" Since your homosexuality has become known, those sources have gone silent. Is there a connection?  Gaahl: ""Yeah, most likely (laughs). It seems like I've pre-empted a few people. And for that I'm truly sorry. (laughs) But the information in question could also pertain to certain things that happened in the early '90s.""  Rock Hard: You mean political things?

Gaahl: ""These are things related to the past and the environment I found myself in at the time. In the early '90s, there were all these different youth gangs in Norway and one thing led to another. I was involved in gang fights and had false friends. It wasn't about any deep political convictions but rather about disassociation. Eventually it took on violent strains. I mean, gangs don't meet up to hold discussions.""  Rock Hard: Would you call yourself a one-time die-hard Nazi?  Gaahl: ""No, there was no political disposition — not with me nor any of my friends. But you had to profess allegiance to a certain group if you wanted to defend yourself and not get your ass kicked. I think we all — my friends at the time as well as myself — felt that way but some of them drifted off into politically extreme circles.""  Rock Hard: Were there racially motivated incidents?  Gaahl: ""It was all about gang affiliation. Who attacked first and who merely defended themselves is impossible to say after all this time. But there were definitely violent altercations. Some of us even had guns.""  Rock Hard: When did your attitude toward these things change?  Gaahl: ""It was a slow process that took years and not something that was triggered by any one thing. I've always had friends from different cultural backgrounds, hence I was exposed to different ways of thinking from the get-go. That's probably why I've never developed a deep set of political beliefs. But there have definitely been changes and an evolution in my thinking. I'm a different person today."""

Norse,2qejoe,comrade_nate,2,Tue Dec 30 17:29:32 2014 UTC,"Well it's very debated and the so called far right wing Swedish Democrats did get 13% on the last election (last August) and became the third biggest party which certainly is a problem.   I wouldn't agree that the main people fighting them are anti fascists or extreme left wing groups only, but also ordinary people and for example two of the biggest parties in Sweden; the current center left government the Social Democrats and the Moderate party (center right).   In a recent political twist those two parties came to the conclusion to work together to exclude the Sweden Democrats so they wouldn't have a say in the new budget plan. So there's that.   A while back there was a big street protest against racism, gathering all kinds of people, families and just regular folks but all of a sudden a small group of neo-Nazis turned up and tried to fight everyone, police were understaffed (of course..) and chaos broke loose but the protesters managed to chase the Nazis away.   It's been the general view a long time that the people who vote for the Swedish Democrats are racists assholes and which politicians are just idiots trying to come off as serious. They say that they aren't racists but almost everyone of their politicians have a history with Nazis and racist groups, it's been pretty much the story of everyone of their team.  I think the reason the Swedish Democrats have gotten so big is how the past governments have handled integration of refugees. It seems in the general view that they didn't handle it very well because many refugees seems to have been located in suburbs where only other refugees live, instead of placing them more scarcely so they can integrate easier into society.   But I wouldn't say that Sweden would be a dangerous place for a foreigner to visit at all, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö have very mixed populations and that can be seen not only on the streets but in the media and culture as well."

Rock Hard: I'm mentioning it because I forgot to ask you an important question during our last interview. When you talked about that ""contract killer"" that was out to get you, and whom you injured so badly that you had to go to prison over it, we never even talked about what provoked the attack in the first place. Who had it in for you?  Gaahl: ""That was connected to my previous stint in prison. Someone whom I had caused trouble wanted to get revenge on me. But since he didn't want to get his own hands dirty for obvious reasons he hired someone who was supposed to attack me and in fact broke into my house carrying a weapon.""  Rock Hard: Can you elaborate on what you mean by ""causing trouble?""  Gaahl: ""I was attacked in a bar, apparently because I had provoked someone with my appearance or something I said — someone with a reputation of being 'dangerous' himself. It turned into a physical altercation with serious consequences. I ended up in jail but the well-to-do 'victim' who had provoked me got off scot-free."""

It has just later been confirmed that they were used for ceremonial purposes."

The whole myth can pretty much be traced back to the romanticism of the vikings in 19th/20th century in scandinavian culture.  I.e: Denmark had just lost a bunch of wars in the 19th century (to Swedish and german armies) and needed to surface some of it's former glory, which happened by telling stories about the fierce vikings. Of course, they had to also display the vikings visually (at operas and such) and at this point, they were given horns.  As for sources, pretty much all i read about it is in danish, but i think you can find something in english about it if you want."

Norse,2q2ufr,havardo,5,Mon Dec 22 21:23:51 2014 UTC,"Casting a circle isn't a Norse thing at all. There are a lot of groups that will do the ""Hammer Rite"" at the start and end of their rituals, which is a bit Wiccan-ish but more Norse themed and pretty entertaining.   There are no rules on who can wear a Mjolnir. That whole bleeding in thing sounds a lot more like a gang thing, unsurprisingly given where your friend picked up the info.   Bleeding on a ring is also not necessary. Some kindreds have oath rings that members swear oaths on. Some kindreds also require members of the kindred to make some kind of oath to be considered part of the kindred. So it is possible to have a group that you have to swear an oath on a ring to join. However, not all kindreds operate this way and it's not necessary, nor do you even have to be part of a group of any kind. In general, be wary of oaths and try to avoid them.   Also, while some people are folkish and believe you have to have some Norse ancestry to practice any of the Norse recon stuff, most people don't. You don't need to be born or adopted in, you just need to decide that these are the gods for you.   And as suggested, /r/asatru is the place to go.  Edit: Oh, and one other thing:   I have no intention of insulting any other view points, or saying the way someone else practices is wrong.    That's the least heathen thing about your post! Two rules of heathenry:   You're doing it wrong. You're not the boss of me."

Norse,2pqlf1,marcelmiranda,8,Fri Dec 19 00:26:18 2014 UTC,"As /u/valhallaswyrdo pointed out, this is more a question for /r/Asatru. I'm one of the mods there, and that's definitely more our territory.   The real answer about the vlaknot is that we know very little about it other than it's closely associated with Odin. Modernly, followers of Odin have taken it as our symbol. The idea that it's the place you'll receive your death blow, or that tattooing it binds you to Odin and a life of hardship... These are all modern ideas that mostly stem from the misunderstanding of a 40 year old joke.   I would discourage you from getting it yet, however. It may not have the mystical qualities that some have mentioned, but in heathen circles it has certain social ramifications. People will make assumptions that may not be true. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, that's what I mean by it being too soon.   If you want to know more, come over and ask at /r/Asatru. For historical questions about the Norse, this sub can't be beat, but for the modern followers of the reconstructed religion, /r/Asatru is where it's at."
Norse,2pqlf1,ThorinRuriksson,4,Fri Dec 19 08:37:04 2014 UTC,"You're looking for /r/Asatru, this is /r/Norse. While similar they are not the same we are more about heritage and they are religion.  But to answer your question, the valknut represents death and IIRC it's power is not supposed to be imbued by the living. I have an aegisjalmur inside my hard hat (I haven't imbued it and I don't believe in magick anyway) but I keep it there to remind myself to be safe."
Norse,2pqlf1,valhallaswyrdo,3,Fri Dec 19 00:58:13 2014 UTC,"The only certainty on it is it's relation to Odin. With all that entails. Mostly death.  There's a lot of word of mouth surrounding it. Some people believe if you tattoo it on your body, not only you're giving yourself entirely to Odin for him to do with you and your life as he sees fit, which they say brings more hardships and sacrifices to your life, it also marks the place where you'll receive a deathblow. In these times, it could be anything from car crash to organ failure probably.  Some others see it only as a link to Odin, or the nine worlds, or death. These all make sense seeing how the valknut appears in scenarios involving death.  Never heard anything about the inverted position."
Norse,2pqlf1,Hjaldrgegnir,3,Fri Dec 19 03:10:06 2014 UTC,"It's known colloquially as the ""insert spear here"" mark in plenty of modern heathen communities.   If you want an ""I am an Asatruar!"" symbol that isn't tied to death/Odin, the Mjolnir is a great choice. While it is Thor's hammer, it doesn't mean that you're dedicated to Thor. It means that you worship the Norse gods and Thor protects you on their behalf, as he protects all of Midgard."
Norse,2pqlf1,TryUsingScience,3,Fri Dec 19 04:04:39 2014 UTC,"It's known colloquially as the ""insert spear here"" mark in plenty of modern heathen communities.   Oh, come on! You know better than to keep spreading that old yarn. We've educated you! Don't be part of the problem!"

Norse,2pqlf1,ThorinRuriksson,1 point,Fri Dec 19 15:51:01 2014 UTC,Indeed.
Norse,2pqlf1,Kilaya,7,Fri Dec 19 15:59:43 2014 UTC,"Well, there's not much to tell.   The valknot hasn't got a lot of historical information to go with it. It's been found a handful of times. When it has been found, it was either closely tied to Odin, or found in burial mounds, giving it an assumed association with Odin and death (Odin, of course, already having his own close ties to death). That's really all we have to go on, historically speaking.   Modernly, it has been adopted a few decades ago by heathens who closely follow Odin. After all, the most universal symbol for the heathen religion was (and still is) the hammer, which is undeniably a symbol of Thor, so people thought it appropriate that other gods have recognizable symbols for followers who were more sympathetic in their direction.   A modern mythos has grown up around the symbol in in ways that hasn't really touched other similar symbols however. This is due to a few things, no small part because of it's obvious association with death and a god of death. It was once mused by some of the early leaders of the modern revival of heathen religion once that tattooing a symbol related to Odin and death was inviting a violent end... And their little one off comment developed a life of its own.   Over the few decades since then, people have become convinced that there is some reason to believe a lot of weird things about it. A popular (and unfounded) belief is that the place you wear the valknot is the place you will receive your death blow. Others believe that the act of wearing it is a pledge to Odin, and that he will make your life short and hard. The reality is that there's no real reason to believe either of these things, either as an effect of the valknot or as a follower of Odin. I've never heard of the valkot shortening someones life, know more than a few older folks with one tattooed, have seen a few people die without being struck down on that spot etc... And, when it comes down to it, Heathens tend to be working class people anyway, so our lives are already hard. Can't blame the valknot for the socioeconomic class you were born into, right?  When it comes down to it, all of these new myths were an unconscious attempt to inject some mysticism into a very new religion that didn't have a lot of mysticism going for it at the time. I say young, because for all that heathen religion is based off of a very old belief system, that belief was all but dead for 1000 years. Asatru and other heathen religions are only around 40 years old."
Norse,2pqlf1,ThorinRuriksson,4,Fri Dec 19 16:30:54 2014 UTC,"It means you pledge your life and soul to Odin, and most likely die early fighting or violently, so you'll go to Valhalla. Wouldn't recommend until you've practiced for a long time, still probably not then either."
Norse,2pqlf1,cubbyatx,4,Fri Dec 19 02:18:12 2014 UTC,It doesn't mean that... That's an idea that popped out of the 70's as part of a joke and took root.

Norse,2pbabg,blakmaggie,4,Mon Dec 15 01:15:17 2014 UTC,"I'm a Scandinavian studies major but I'm currently away from my books and notes but I can give some basic information.  Contrary to popular belief, valkyrie is an occupation that women of human or elven origin might pursue. These women might even lead fairly normal lives most of the year, but when called on by Odin they would fly invisibly over battlefields and take the spirits of the dead to Valhalla. They usually did not have a battle chant but some sort of song sang by them can be seen in Njal's Saga. Valkyries are women who dislike the male-dominated Norse society. They feel trapped in their domestic routines at home, and who were contacted by Odin because of their longing for something more. Some of them are cold-blooded killers who enjoy finishing men off on the battlefield, others are more jovial and enjoy the company of dead warriors in Valhalla. They are not femme fatales nor love interests, and are unlikely to even have an interest in romantic entanglements. While the Eddas and sagas tell of a few valkyries (such as Brynhildr and Sigrun from the famous Volsunga Saga which you can read here) who fell in love with mortal warriors, these are women whose first and foremost craving is for independence and the rush of combat. Each valkyrie is issued a magical swan-skin, which when worn as a cloak enables her to fly and to make herself invisible. The cloak is jealously guarded and never far from the valkyrie even when she isn’t wearing it.   Here's also an excerpt from a DnD campaign I've used that might help:  The valkyrie can teleport herself and her belongings, as well as the soul of one mortal warrior per level, to Valhalla and back to Midgard. She cannot teleport to Valhalla empty-handed (without the soul of a warrior), but once in Valhalla she can stay indefinitely as long as she helps with the “chores” like cooking and waiting on the Einherjar (a task that some of them enjoy and some of them hate; Odin doesn’t force it on any of them). She can return from Valhalla to the mortal plane either on her own (she will return to whatever place she last left; cannot use this ability to teleport from one place to another on Midgard) or on a mission from Odin to harvest warriors from a new battle somewhere else Odin will not teleport his valkyries simply for their personal pleasure).  As long as she is actively working for Odin (i.e. not more than a month has gone by since she harvested souls from a battlefield), the valkyrie ages slowly, one year for every two. This means that a valkyrie who started working for Odin at 20 will not appear to be 30 until she is 40 (20 years have gone by). A valkyrie may live a good deal longer than a normal person in this fashion, but she has to keep harvesting souls every month, and normal aging penalties still apply once her apparent age reaches 60 (though she may be 100 years old before she looks 60).  Alignment: Any, though must be willing to obey the commands of Odin, which may involve killing good people on the battlefield.   Racial Restrictions: Human or elf."

Norse,2oyksk,Argit,1 point,Thu Dec 11 18:09:33 2014 UTC,"I do Viking age. Typically Swedish or Icelandic, though my group doesn't focus on Viking age, there's a lot of eras and ethnicity that we reenact. It was pretty common to have an under tunic and a tunic, for lack of better terms. The undertunic was made from wool or linen, with the tunic being made from either the same materials, or something as rich as silk. There's been suggestions that undertunics were longer than the usual tunics as it was a chance to display that person's wealth, same again with hem, the more hem (if any) and the material, design, etc, were all a status of wealth.  I usually use tablet woven trim on my tunics - when I make them myself. These two are both bought online, and are just there to bulk up my collection of clothing while I work on more.   I either source information from my fellow group, or use info from the Sagas, other reenactment groups, historical finds, etc.  Hurstwic is a pretty good place to start.

As far as I know there's no evidence that they were worn so short with the under-tunic deliberately showing, or any evidence that over-tunics were short-sleeved. I'd also be interested in the evidence for such broad tablet weave, and for tablet weave applied to the under-tunic and to the hems of the tunics (as far as I know the latter was restricted in time and place to certain parts of Scotland). I don't mean to sound combative but I think if one wants to engage in living history, rather than fantasy, one should have good, verifiable evidence interpreted in an sensible way for your kit being the way it is."

Simple nasal= 60.00 ocular= 60.00. So, for a model like the one pictured, at 20 guage, would be 420.00. 16 guage would be 520. The helm would have a simple liner of leather, optional chin strap. Mail can be added to suit your needs. Are you looking for a purely costume grade peice? Or, are you looking for re-inactment grade equipment. ( there can be quite a difference.)"

Norse,2o91fr,Quietuus,2,Thu Dec 4 16:09:11 2014 UTC,I've also seen this done with a thin strip of rawhide (a thong essentially) and a single running stitch; put the rawhide through wet and once it dries it tightens up nicely; this is also effective for an entirely rawhide-covered shield.

They were able to trace my family line back to 1066a.d. with ancestors names being written in the Doomsday Book.    I was curious and started looking, and wasn't able to find anything due to being stonewalled with one of the individuals dating in 1000a.d.  my brother and I were bouncing ideas of who this individual may be, and he said that perhaps he could have been a Viking, Since the Viking raids dated from about 793ad to 1066ad and that there was nothing to be found of him earlier, and that many Vikings settled and farmed the land near the end dates of the raids.  I searched that idea and got lucky, and I found that he was one of the sons of Richard I Duke of Normandy, who was son of Willam I Longsword (Viking), who was son of Rollo I a Norse Viking, which line goes back into the Vikings of Norway!  Took me 12 years to find this, and I'm not disappointed in the least! The reason I got stuck was due to that I was searching in all the wrong places. Because my relatives were adamant that we were Saxons, and that our line got lost somewhere in Germany farther back. I never thought of looking in Norway and Normandy!  Skol!"

I'm an atheist, but I love reading about Norse mythology.  While I don't believe in the gods, the stories told are fascinating and shed some light on the mindset and beliefs of my ancestors.  Other ways have been to explore older holiday customs.  I made a Yule log this year, put candles in my tree (unlit!), and I'm planning a Walpurgisnacht celebration in the spring.

Norse,2nx0z4,goforglory,3,Mon Dec 1 06:05:04 2014 UTC,"What we have to understand is the myths changed alot since when they were written in 13th century Iceland from viking age in scandinavia.   I know few respected scholars, Terry Gunnell and others think that Ragnarök might have happened when Þór went on his fishing trip in older versions, later Icelanders change that into volcano myth after they saw volcanoes.   If I remember correctly, people think the world will end because people think he holds Miðgarður together by biting his tail.   And finally, Ragnarök is a event that will take place in the future according to the myths. Ragnarök means fate of the gods, and comes for example because they have been unloyal, broken oaths and more You will get better understanding if you read Völuspá, I recommend that."
Norse,2nx0z4,Solmundarson,2,Mon Dec 1 12:14:40 2014 UTC,"And how come the world didn't end when when Thor first went out on a fishing trip with the giant to slay him since he let go of his tail to bite on the ox's head?   I'm not sure how to answer this, but the general advice is to remember that all myths were scattered for a long time before they were collected to Edda's. There might be plot holes.   Second, I don't quite understand Ragnarok? What is it? Is it a place? The battlefield? A realm?   It's an event.   And how did Thor end up kill Jörmungandr?   Völuspá (The Völva's Prophecy) (on Ragnarok):  55.  Hither there comes  The son of HlothynJörmungandr,  The bright snakeJörmungandr gapes  To heaven above;  .    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .  Against the serpentJörmungandr  Goes Othin's sonThor.  56.  In anger smites  The warder of earthThor,  Forth from their homes  Must all men flee;  Nine paces fares  The son of FjorgynThor,  And, slain by the serpentJörmungandr,  Fearless he sinks.  (translations may vary)"
Norse,2nx0z4,Juffin,2,Mon Dec 1 15:56:12 2014 UTC,"Hm... call me crazy, but I've never heard the biting the tail thing, ever. Especially not in primary sources like the Eddas or Sagas. Jormungandr was large enough to encircle the earth and be ABLE to bite his own tail because of his sheer size, but I've never heard of him needing to bite his tail or the world falls apart. Even a quick Google search doesn't mention this aspect. What's your source on this?  As for Ragnarok. It's basically the story of the final battle of the Norse gods, where most of them die but some of their children survive to rule a new reborn world with another unamed god. There are (I believe) multiple Ragnarok stories, the most famous being in the Voluspa. The voluspa in particular is a prophecy, and there's something you need to understand about the Germanic world view in order to grasp the nature of the story. In the ancient Germanic world view, time was only divided into ""past"" and ""non-past"", the future was an unknowable chaos and was only given form by or actions in the present. ""Fate"" had to do with the past, only the actions you have taken are set in stone, and whatever foundations you have laid for yourself by your actions will make it more likely for certain futures to happen. By this token, since the Ragnarok of the Voluspa is a prophecy, according to the Germanic world view, it is only showing one possible future, not a set and final ""doom of the gods"" as the name implies. It's one possible battle that can happen at the end of the universe. If you're interested, you can read more about this in a book called The Well and Tree: World and Time in Early Germanic Culture.  From a more academic perspective, the Voluspa was written after the Christianization. While we do have some collaboration on some of the battles described, the Voluspa is the only source that the gods die and a mysterious ""new god"" takes over, though it is retroactively referenced by Snorri and later poems. I've heard (but not been able to research myself yet) that in other sources that reference the Ragnarok battle, the gods don't die, and even that some of the smaller fights were probably separate events and not even part of a major tribal war. Many scholars believe that the ""doom of the gods"" portrayed at the end of the Voluspa was created by the Christians to say, ""Hey, your gods are dead, so come worship ours!"" This is backed up by the fact the word used for ""god"" when the new power shows up after the world is reborn is the same Norse word that was used to reference the Christian god. Though it's possible only the ending was tweaked and the rest of it comes from an older story or stories. I've wondered if putting it in the form of a prophecy was meant to add the the ambiguity of the whole thing.  So there's my long winded schpeel. As another poster mentioned, some scholars also think the Thor/ Jormandgandr battles were the same battle, which could lend to the theory that the gods actually survived their fights in the old stories and were just killed off later for Christian propaganda."

They're basically stone age tools, hammers or axes... so even if they didn't belong to the genetic ancestors of the Norse, they were aware of the age of these items... that they weren't just regular stones... they were stones that had been worked by a human hand.  So they had a lot of significance as something that went back into ancient ancestry.  Since they were also usually hammers or axes there's the other connection to Þórr.

Norse,2nmrdp,BearWarcry,1 point,Thu Dec 4 19:58:31 2014 UTC,"Here are the books I started with that have been very helpful...   I did not start with the Eddas, I started with this book...  The Norse Myths by Kevin Crossley-Holland  It is a modern launguage retelling of the Lore in an easier to follow format.  I read this book first so I have an understanding of the specific myth then I dive into the Eddas.   I also purchased a few Asatru specific books that give an overview of the Gods and Goddesses, give a brief history lesson, and discuss some of the rituals of Asatru like Blots, holidays, toasts, ect.    Essential Asatru: Walking the Path of Norse Paganism  A Practical Heathens Guide to Asatru   and   Heathenry: A Study of Asatru in the Modern World This one I have not read yet so I have no idea how good it is.   I also purchased The Prose Edda: Norse Mythology   I have a really hard time reading the Eddas since I have always had a hard time with that type of poetry so I have only purchased the one Edda and I am slowly making my way through it.  There are a few different Eddas out there so read reviews of them on Amazon before buying to see what everyone is saying about it.    I didnt do this with the Asatru Edda and after I bought it found out they tend to fill in holes in the myths with their own assumptions.  Im not educated enough to give examples but most of the reviews mention it.  I was advised not to read that version until I become more familiar with the Lore as it was written first.  Also, this book is as physically large as a school text book.  It is soft cover but very awkward to hold and read.    Good luck.  I am very much a beginner but have found the above resources helpful."

Norse,2nefdd,makedomend,18,Tue Nov 25 19:27:51 2014 UTC,"It's different between the nordic countries. In Iceland we have tons of myths about yule, and back in the day it was the time when elves and spirits could easily get into your house, so it was quite a scary time in the darkness. We have now 13 santa clauses (yule lads) which are all troll born brothers. They are all pranksters and thiefs and they each and every one have a theme. One steals sausage, one steals candles, one slams doors to wake up people, one is a window peeper etc. Today every Icelandic child puts their shoe in their windowsill 13 days before yule, and each and every yule lad gives them some small present in their shoe. If the children don't behave they get a potato instead of a present. The yule lads parents are pretty scary trolls and their mother collects naughty children and eats them. Or well cooks them and eats them together with the dad, which is too lazy to hunt himself. They have a few more troll children, and then they also have a cat - the yule cat. The Yule cat is quite scary and ferocious and it eats children who don't get any new clothes before yule. Most folklorists believe that these trolls coming into our houses (the yule lads) around yule is a left over from the myths back in the day.    Each yule lad stays for 13 days in town, before he heads back into the mountains where they live, and the day when the last one leaves (6th of january) then there's a day we call ""The Thirteenth"" and on that day elves and trolls dance and celebrate. Everybody has a bonfire and fireworks (leftover from new years) and we sing songs about the elves and stuff like that. It's also considered a magical night where animals can speak etc. Both the Thirteenth and New years night are considered nights when the elves move, and there are certain tricks to hinder them, and then possibly gain something from them."

I thought it was clear from my introduction that they were just cognates. But I actually did think ""ken"" came from German ""kennen."" One of my German teachers told me that, and I didn't think to double-check them. I've not had much formal education on historical linguistics, but I plan to take a class on it, and maybe another one focusing on Germanic languages. The full etymologies interest me, but I feel like they go over the heads of most people, so I just focused on cognates, which are something that laypeople can understand."

Heres some parts where they put norse religion in a bad light: The seer guy who you have to pay and whom is a monster whose hand you have to lick, there is no evidence for that crap. That whole boring episode at uppsala where they all decide to do shrooms and have supposed spiritual experiences, and orgies if i remember correctly. Also unrelated, that part where they consider sacrificing athelstan. Pagans in Sweden sacrificed their christian king once, i doubt they would have a problem doing it to a christian monk, slave."

If you want to look at it historically though, I don't really mind that it's wrong in a few areas, if the people watching want to know about the culture or religion or anything they either would have already researched it or would do more research after watching the show, I don't know a lot about the production but I'm guessing that the show wasn't made to educate, if they wanted to educate they would just make a documentary."

Norse,2mdl75,Pocanos,2,Mon Nov 24 00:51:10 2014 UTC,Nice work!  It brought up a question in my mind.  Why is it that Hel is often depicted as you have?  We know from the  Gylfaginning that she is described as being half-skin and half-rot(dark).  But what I can't seem to find is how the halves are distributed.  Is she vertically half live half dead or horizontally half live half dead?  Maybe the halves are spread out over her body in a kind of spotted appearance?  Does anyone know of a source that details this?  I know it's a silly detail but the question did arise.  Thanks for the thoughts and the art work kattdjur!
Norse,2mdl75,Kilaya,3,Sat Nov 15 16:50:49 2014 UTC,"That's the exact question that's been burning in me. I've not found it stated anywhere which half. To me, I had always imagined that it was along a horizontal line, with her stomach down rotted to show perhaps a barren, dead womb. All of my friends see just the way Kattdjur describes it. Interesting pondering."
Norse,2mdl75,Ratatoskr-,3,Sat Nov 15 20:09:51 2014 UTC,"No problem at all.  The sources I've read haven't mentioned it, but the (fiction) books I've read that are based on Norse mythology say that it's a vertical distribution.   However, that doesn't mean that's right. I mean, I've also seen people saying that it's a horizontal one, and that she has decaying hips, thighs and feet. This is simply the distribution I chose for the picture :)"

And such was the guise of his raiment as the Volsung elders had told Was borne by their fathers' fathers, and the first that warred in the wold. So strode he to the Branstock, nor greeted any lord, But forth from his cloudy raimer.t he drew a gleaming sword, And smote it deep in the tree bole, and the wild hawks overhead Laughed 'neath the naked heaven as at last he spake and said: ""Earls of the Goths and Volsungs, abiders on the earth, Lo there amid the Branstock a blade of plenteous worth! The folk of the war-wand's forgers wrought never better steel Since the first burg of heaven uprose for man-folk's weal. Now let the man among you whose heart and hand may shift To pluck it from the oakwood e'en take it for my gift. Then ne'er, but his own heart falter, its point and edge shall fail Until the night's beginning and the ending of the tale."" So sweet his speaking sounded, so wise his words did seem, That moveless all men sat there, as in a happy dream We stir not lest we waken ; but there his speech had end, And slowly down the hall-floor and outward did he wend. And none would cast him a question or follow on his ways, For they knew that the gift was Odin's, a sword for the world to praise."

So it's possible they were more likely to go to Valhalla as opposed to Folkvangr, being so completely devoted to Odin.  But in general, Old Norse culture didn't really ruminate on the minutiae of the afterlife. The here and now was of much greater importance."

Norse,2lbmau,Lemon_Tree,3,Wed Nov 5 15:23:52 2014 UTC,"It mainly has to do with Indo-European comparative religion. Tyr is seen as a cognate to the Indo-European Dyus-Pater (Holy Father), who is also the source of Zeus and a lot of other chief dieties. You can even compare the pronunciation of the Continental German ""Tiw"" with ""Zeus"" and see how they may have once been the same word.  It's also how we get the words deus, deity, divine, etc. ""Tyr"" is even used as a catch-all term for ""god of"" in Old Norse (example: One of the many names of Odin is ""Valtyr"", ""Victory god"").  You can also look at the fact that Tyr is a god of law and order, whereas Odin is a wanderer with some... less than admirable qualities who is into magic and prophecy and sometimes outright deception. Hardly the model chieftain.  The Cult of Wodan seemed to arise during the migration era, mostly among warrior societies, who venerated him in his role as a battle god. It was a rough time to be alive, and Odin offered the blessings needed to survive in it. They probably conquered or displaced the older, Tyr-centric sect of the Norse religion."
Norse,2lbmau,AsaTJ,2,Wed Nov 5 15:43:22 2014 UTC,"That's cool, since I asked you, I did some wiki browsing and came across similar information. It's pretty interesting.

I'm no scholar in the matter, but have done extensive research for a fantasy novel. Most likely someone on the chinese wiki just made it up. That being said, Gungnir is said to be made of gold, and I could easily see it as a metaphor to explain that strange gleam of light across the night sky. If a norseman saw a shooting star on the eve of a battle, he could see it as a sign that Odin was watching, or had even already decided who were going to win. So even if it might certainly be a wrongful statement, it is still a fine metaphor."
Norse,2kyyr3,RufusDogtrot,2,Sat Nov 1 12:04:03 2014 UTC,"Introduction:   What will be outlined here are the religious beliefs and rituals of the Scandinavians in the eighth to the eleventh centuries including those who went for trade, plunder or settlement abroad, that is, the ‘vikings’ properly speaking. Some among them were already Christians but the vast majority of the population still clung to their traditional religion. From a modern point of view their religion can be classified äs a ‘non-doctrinal community religion’ in contrast with the ‘doctrinal transnational religions’ äs represented by Christianity, Buddhism and Islam. Religion was strongly integrated with social life, warfare and subsistence activities, and this means that religious elements can be expected to occur within the total range of Viking Age culture and society."

Norse,2ks04m,THEAdrian,-1,Fri Oct 31 12:05:23 2014 UTC,There weren't really any Vikings in Finland. Might as well replace them with Estonians as we have the Oeselians and other tribes in mainland Estonia.
Norse,2ks04m,autowikibot,3,Thu Oct 30 19:37:44 2014 UTC,"Oeselians:       The Oeselians or Osilians were a historical subdivision of Estonians inhabiting Saaremaa (Latin: Oesel or Osilia), an Estonian island in the Baltic Sea. In modern Estonian, they are called saarlased (Estonian pronunciation: [ˈsɑːrlɑset] ""islanders""; singular: saarlane), which also applies to present-day inhabitants of the island. They are first thought to be mentioned as early as the 2nd century BC in Ptolemy's Geography III.   The Oeselians were known in the Old Norse Icelandic Sagas and in Heimskringla as Víkingr frá Esthland (English: vikings from Estonia).     Their sailing vessels were called pirate ships by Henry of Livonia in his Latin chronicles from the beginning of the 13th century.   Eistland or Esthland is the historical Germanic language name that refers to the country at the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea in general, and is the origin of the modern national name for Estonia. The mainland of modern Estonia in the 8th century Ynglinga saga was called Adalsyssla in contrast to Eysyssel or Ösyssla that was the name of the island (Swedish: Ösel, Estonian: Saaremaa), the home of the Oeselians. In the 11th century, Courland and Estland (Estonia) were both denoted separately by Adam of Bremen.   On the eve of Northern Crusades, the Oeselians were summarized in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle thus: ""The Oeselians, neighbors to the Kurs (Curonians), are surrounded by the sea and never fear strong armies as their strength is in their ships. In summers when they can travel across the sea they oppress the surrounding lands by raiding both Christians and pagans.""

Since my father was adopted and my grandparents refused to discuss his origin DNA was my only clue. Turns out I'm a sliver Finnish as well. Some day I'd like to visit Estonia.

Norse,2kuf65,lelis92,6,Fri Oct 31 02:00:04 2014 UTC,"I am not the most well versed in this yet but I will answer to the best of my ability.  Asatru or just Germanic Paganism  1) A blot is probably the most spiritual ritual we have left. The best way to describe it would be like a prayer/sacrifice ritual for gods and sometimes local wights.  2) Many do but I have yet to join a local practice.  3) This is hard to answer. Many heathens nowadays follow the nine noble virtues, which critics say is just borrowing from christianity, but personally I see heathenry as not having any doctrine. You can be pagan without being a worshipper if that makes anysense.   Now as Asatru it's a bit different. It basically translates to 'true to the Aesir' and means that I will be loyal and 'true' to the Aesir until they fall at Ragnarok.  4) All religions have places where they support the group, whether it's as an army or a family. There are plenty of parallel tales that preach the strength of the individual as well though.  5) None really. Modern day Asatru and neo-Paganism is essentially a revival of a dead religion. Many formerly sacred sites were used for Christian churches and were never 'recovered.'  6) Basically, depending on how you die you go somewhere else. Most people go to Helheim and those who die in battle go to Valhalla to fight and feast until Ragnarok where they will fight alongside the gods (these men are called the Einharjar) There are several other halls/places you can go when you die, it all depends on how you die and how you live your life.  7) Not exactly common enough to say it affects my society.  8) It helps give me strength and the tales give me a guideline when I am not sure what to do.  9) It's not really a concept that is spoken about much in Asatru. Spirits and souls are usually more rooted in Christianity and more Latin based paganism.  And the number 9 is an iffy one. It is seen a lot with the 9 Aesir, 9 worlds, 9 days it took Odin to revive himself, 9 steps Thor will take before sucumbing to Jorgamundr's venom etc. It is not known if the number itself actually means anything, but it's amount does seem to appear quite often."

Norse,2kuf65,nightslayer78,4,Fri Oct 31 21:55:36 2014 UTC,"Asatru  1) No, there are poems about the tales of our gods that have been passed down through the time. But, they have no ""spiritual"" meaning.  2) Yes. But, me personally? Possibly, if the fellow Asatruers were on the same path as me.  3) Courage, Truth, Honor, Fidelity, Discipline, Hospitality, Self Reliance, Industriousness, Perseverance  4)Neither  5)None in this realm  6)Most people go to Hel(or Helhiem as it is sometimes called) and have a normal afterlife. If you broke an oath, murdered, seduced the Níðhöggr feasted on you. If you died valiantly and courageously in battle you might be picked to join the gods in the final battle against the giants.   7)Asatru isn't a largely practiced religion. So, many people are unaware of it.   8)Just as any religion, it gives me strength to live our lives in this harsh world. My gods and ancestors have accomplished many trials and come out the victor. I wish to become closer to them. They are my kin and are a part of me.   9)I have been uneasy personally about the term ""soul"" it isn't defined well in Asatru. I personally see there has to be a ""soul"" of sorts to move about realms. But, I haven't found a way to wrap my head around it.   (Bonus Question) Huh?"

Norse,2ki1dh,H8Blood,2,Tue Oct 28 11:51:33 2014 UTC,"I'm not seeing what Icelandic staves have to do with the Ogham alphabet, unless you sincerely believe that some Early Modern Icelandic farmers had intimate knowledge of an alphabet that was used a thousand years earlier. If there are actually scholarly sources behind the connection and not just idle speculation because they look similar, I'd be very interested."
Norse,2ki1dh,H8Blood,2,Tue Oct 28 12:18:00 2014 UTC,"It's a comparison. Because we know how the addition or subtraction of a single line in said alphabets can change the meaning, one should assume it behaves similiar with the magic staves found in the Huld/Dark manuscript. And just because the manuscript was written and collected in 1847 doesn't mean that the material in it isn't much older so talking about a thousand years earlier might be a bit of a stretch here.  Like I said, to each their own. If you want to use the simplified versions, go ahead. All that I'm saying is that the version in the manuscript is the only surviving record that we have, so why not use it?"

Norse,2jkvy3,Maple-Whisky,5,Sat Oct 18 03:39:15 2014 UTC,"The Vegvisir is, as you pointed out, more or less the ""Norse"" Compass"". The Aegishjalmer is also known as the ""Helm of Awe"". It is a stave that is supposed to import invincibility, or at least some invulnerability, to a person."
Norse,2jkvy3,ThorinRuriksson,2,Sun Oct 19 06:05:57 2014 UTC,"Is Vegvisir the old norse name? Because then there would be only a small difference throughout the centuries between Vegvisir and the German word Wegweiser, which means 'guide' in English. I love stuff like that."
Norse,2jkvy3,DerBroeckel,1 point,Sat Oct 18 11:40:59 2014 UTC,"Vegvísir is the ON name yes, though found in 18th century Icelandic huld manuscript.   Vegvísir means roadguider."
Norse,2jkvy3,Solmundarson,2,Sat Oct 18 12:45:30 2014 UTC,"That's what Wegweiser means exactly too, guide was the vague translation from Google, I wasn't as precise as I should have been."
Norse,2jgddo,marsipangrisen,7,Thu Oct 16 21:01:38 2014 UTC,"You can't call it educational if you're just going to take elements from all the myths and mix them into your own little story. Your writing needs to flow better, it doesn't excite or engage me. You also switch from present to past tense and back again towards the end. I'm sorry, but it just looks like you've rewritten a couple of wikipedia articles. You're not going to have any plot?"
Norse,2jgddo,mortensdottir,1 point,Thu Oct 16 22:21:03 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the critique!   And you're completely right, this is a rewritten text from wikipedia! I actually haven't started to write the book yet, so I just quickly made an example test.   It's also kind of hard to have a plot, I have found, when I'm not the one who comes up with the stories."
Norse,2jgddo,mortensdottir,3,Fri Oct 17 05:13:16 2014 UTC,"You could always use some of the less known characters and develop a plot around those. Think of it as writing old Norse fan fiction. That's most likely how most of the stories came into being anyway, people inventing and expanding on what they already had."
Norse,2jgddo,Maple-Whisky,4,Sat Oct 18 13:18:13 2014 UTC,"Without talking about writing style or skill, here's what I have to say:   I like the idea, but if it's going to be a novel, you need plots. The best example of this is the book The Children of Odin.  What you're doing right now seems like regurgitated lore without a story; which can be found in any book of myths."

Norse,2jgddo,TryUsingScience,2,Fri Oct 17 05:23:54 2014 UTC,"If you want to write a novel that is has a decent amount of educational content, it wouldn't hurt to check out some the sagas, some of the feuds and epics. My favorite is the saga of the people of Eryie. But Njal's saga has great characters with depth. Through these, you'll be able to understand the cultural mindsets that prevailed the people who descended from such myths. Thor's aggressive attitude and touchiness about his manhood is mirrored in the sagas, as well as loki's mischief, which is mirrored by a great deal of outlaws and ""no good"" family. Odin'so wisdom and faults are very close to that of Njal and Snorri the godi. Anyways I would encourage you to look into them to develop a basis for characters."

Norse,2jgddo,H8Blood,1 point,Fri Oct 17 04:27:12 2014 UTC,"I think that depends on how you die. If you die a warriors death you go to Valhall, but if you die a sinners death you go to Nifelheim.   What would be the realm of death in your book?"
Norse,2jgddo,olemao,2,Fri Oct 17 05:16:56 2014 UTC,"Sin is a Christian concept. Most polytheist religions have no concept of sin. There are acts that are bad because they have negative consequences for you, your kin, or the gods, but not acts that are wrong ""just because.""  You can end up in various gods' halls if that particular god really likes you and/or you fulfill specific criteria (e.g. dying at sea and having gold on your person). Not everyone who dies in battle goes to Valhalla or Sessrunir; just those chosen by Odin or Freyja.  Most people go to Hel/into the mound to live with their ancestors. There are bad places in Hel, like Nostrand, but most of it is boring.  As I said, if this is all new to you then you need to do far more research."

After spending a year with her in the library every day, I still don't know her stance on these sorts of things.  She kept her beliefs to herself and followed a live-and-let-live philosophy.  Plenty of Christians are more progressive than we sometimes give them credit for.  Lots of young Christians are told where to go by the parents who are paying their tuition and have no choice in the matter.

That is, of course, an easy way to dismiss the divinity of Norse mythology.  But there are many gods in other cultures who bear similarities with Norse gods.  Thor and Perun come to mind.  The gods are largely early explanations for natural phenomena like thunder, the seasons, and other similar things.  You'll find that today's pagans tend to flock to Odin as that is what they are used to, embracing the one head god.    A great primer for Norse mythology is this http://www.amazon.com/Penguin-Book-Norse-Myths-Vikings/dp/0241953219  It puts the myths in plain language and doesn't really have any bias."

It was named for its creator Euhemerus. In more recent literature of myth, such as in Bulfinch's Mythology, Euhemerism is called the ""historical interpretation"" of mythology.  Euhemerism is defined in modern academic literature as the theory that myths are distorted accounts of real historical events.  Euhemerus was not the first to attempt to rationalize mythology through history, as euhemeristic views are found in earlier writers, including Xenophanes, Herodotus, Hecataeus of Abdera and Ephorus.   However, Euhemerus is credited as having developed the theory in application to all myths, considering mythology to be ""history in disguise"".

Norse,2i4czm,TheIrishJJ,8,Thu Oct 2 19:49:46 2014 UTC,"/r/asatru would be a better sub for religious questions. And just to let you know, many dislike the idea of having one patron deity, though it all depends on what is best on an individual basis."
Norse,2i4czm,SOSBTK,5,Thu Oct 2 21:36:20 2014 UTC,"As stated by /u/SOSBTK, /r/asatru is a better place for this question, but I'll throw this in because I've already typed it out.  There's an entire pantheon of Gods and Goddesses in the Nordic / Germanic system and they're quite different.  Think of it like this - you go to a house party. There are lots of people, men, women, boys & girls. Some of them are the life and soul, some of them are quiet. Some like to hang out with new people, some take a bit more to come out of their shell. Some want to know you, some don't.  You might find a room where people ignore you, another room where people invite you in.   By going around and introducing yourself, you find some people you get on with and others less so. Maybe you find one person you really click with and you get on really well. Maybe after the party, they introduce you to someone else you didn't meet at first. You'd like to hang out with them and they say sure, let's do that.   Just like any relationship, you have to make an effort, go out of your way, behave like you would with anyone you'd want to make friends with, be a friend to. Talk to a few of them. There's no right or wrong way to do this. It's down to you to figure out how. There's no dogma involved.  Think of research, research, research as the bit you do to get yourself ready for the party (like picking out your clothes, finding the way there, knowing how to behave once you get there, people's names, where they come from).   Maybe you won't connect with anyone. Maybe you will. Just remember that if you turn up to a party and don't make an effort to get to know people, they won't make an effort to get to know you either.  If you're not sure, Odin is the recruiter - he's a deeply, profoundly complex God, but think of him like the CEO, the Chief, the leader. It's his house party. Introduce yourself to him. Get to know him, and he'll get to know you. He'll know who to point you towards.   Most of all, you have to make an effort, as in, get off yer arse and go for it with tenacity.  Maybe nothing will happen. Maybe you won't find the house party.  But you won't know unless you go."
Norse,2i4czm,Jazzspasm,3,Thu Oct 2 23:20:29 2014 UTC,"Devoting yourself to one god/dess is something many people coming from a monotheistic background feel comfortable with, because it's familiar. But, you really should get used to acknowledging different gods/desses at different times for different things.   As you immerse yourself into Germanic Heathenry, you will begin to discover that many practitioners don't actually worship the gods, there are no omniscient or omnipresent god in heathenry, so it's next to impossible to develop a personal relationship with them. Heathenry to many people is more the worship of ancestors and spirits with the seasonal, respectful nod towards the gods."
Norse,2i4czm,Ratatoskr-,2,Fri Oct 3 02:50:19 2014 UTC,"The religion of our ancestors didn't spend much of their time speaking to the gods. They do not have time in the day to listen to each one of us, they are physical beings and far more real than the judo-Christianity god. If you need help or guidance you should first speak to your ancestors and the wrights. The gods will help when it comes to large matters, like of a nation for instance. Our gods respect self reliance not begging, so you should first do your best to accomplish your task on your own. If your wheels are spinning and nothing is happening maybe then you could speak to your ancestors or the wrights.   Take into consideration that the wrights are easily offended and do not understand human nature as much as your ancestors or the gods.   Our daily sacrifices are given as just that a sacrifice, it must be of something that matters to you. DO NOT GIVE TABLE SCRAPINGS!! What I personally do is have one beer a day. I have a cup in my back yard in a simple Horgr and after work I open a beer go out back, empty the cup, clean the cup, and hail the god of the day and drink the rest. Today was Thor's Day. Remember to hail them, never pray to them. They are wise and powerful but you do not bow to them. They are your big brother(s)/sister(s) they have wisdom and you can look up to them.   I recently became and active practitioner and I am still learning but I feel like I am on the right path. There are many others on /r/asatru who can help you.   I would also go to the youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXbGN83VIZylahG3IjrTUpw I have learned much about the do's and Don'ts from that channel.

Some jokes don't work at all, and as the deliberate ""old"" Swedish prose does not translate well to English it reads less like an epic and more like a gritty action-story. Remember when Orm duels Sigtrygg at the Yule celebration? Hilarious in Swedish, repulsive in English.   It's a great story - I recommend Röde Orm, but not The Long Ships."

I believe most rune stones here in Scandinavia are engraved with the younger Futhark.   Remember to adhere to certain rules if you want it to look authentic. The spelling of words was never very important (those who could write spelled words as they themselves pronounced them), but there are conventions. Never use double consonants (in Modern English, ""hall"" would be ""hal"" and ""banner"" ""baner""), and nasals (m, n) were not visible before homorganic consonants. (""Lamp"" would be ""lab"" and ""band"" ""bat"" - as P and B were both symbolised by B, and T and D by T. But you'll see that yourself.)   Good luck!"

Norse,2hye4f,S0pdet,2,Sat Oct 4 00:04:27 2014 UTC,"It depends on exactly what you're trying to write, but your safest bet will be some variation of the Younger Futhark (there are a few, used in different circumstances in different regions throughout the period Old Norse was in use.) Anglo-Saxon is right out - the ""fuþorc"" was used in writing Old English, a.k.a. the Anglo-Saxon language. On the other hand, by the period of classical Old Icelandic (the language of the sagas, spoken roughly 1200-1400 or so - i.e., after the period of Old Norse proper) the so-called ""medieval runes"" were in use.   Please note also that learning Old Norse is a completely different issue than learning the runes. There's plenty of Old Norse/Old Icelandic preserved in nice friendly Latin letters - in fact, way more in Latin characters than in runes. So if you're just worried about learning the language, it would probably be wise not to jump into the runes before you have a solid grasp on everything else."

Hollander and Larrington are both excellent and fairly true to the original words, though neither perfectly imitate the poetics. Hollander is as close as you can get.  Patricia Terry's translation is more accessible and less accurate. It's still sufficiently accurate to get the story across, though, and its accessibility is a big bonus given how dry the writing can normally be.  The primary language that we know of is Old Norse.

It's the closest you can get to Old Norse and if you actually want to be able to speak it you don't really have a choice since the pronunciation rules are not something you can learn by reading about it alone. You actually have to listen to it/hear it to be able to learn it.
Norse,2hsemx,Strid,1 point,Tue Sep 30 10:03:26 2014 UTC,"No, the translations are pretty good. If you're so inclined, though, you can sit down with an Icelandic-English dictionary and the text in Old Norse.

Of course, you're right - that's why I said ""a shot at"" - no guarantees except that one is more likely to enjoy the years of study and secure good grades. That said, your words of caution are well placed, and if they can discourage a young student, that person probably wasn't going to walk the difficult path anyway."
Norse,2hsemx,ConanofCimmeria,2,Wed Oct 1 12:27:12 2014 UTC,"To quote some parts of the Edda Translations guide   The best translation:   Dronke, Ursula. The Poetic Edda. (3 vol.) - Do whatever you can to get your hands on these. They were limited runs and are obscenely expensive, so you’ll probably have to do what I did and read them via interlibrary loan through a university. The Old Norse is presented alongside an extremely accurate English translation with extensive footnotes and translations notes. Commentary is included that provides valuable historical and cultural context, explains difficult terms, discusses religious and social pressures that may have influenced the texts… just amazing. Mrs. Dronke unfortunately passed away before the fourth volume was complete, but I’m still crossing my fingers that it will be released. A read through Dronke’s translations and essays will do wonders for your comprehension of the Poetic Edda.   More Modern Translations:   Larrington, Carolyne. (Trans.). (1996). The Poetic Edda.- Larrington is a good substitute if you cannot get your hands on Dronke’s Eddas, as Larrington was her student. This translation can be purchased very cheaply, especially if you buy used. Downside: there’s not a lot of commentary (which is really necessary to get a good understanding of the historical and cultural context) and she inaccurately glosses terms a lot. Relatively easy to read, but I’d recommend reading it side by side with another translation that includes some commentary and doesn’t gloss over and oversimplify terms to the point of inaccuracy. Hollander, Lee M. (Trans.) (1962). The Poetic Edda: Translated with an Introduction and Explanatory Notes. - A lot of people like this text. It’s very pretty, but Hollander sacrificed accuracy for aesthetics. He also uses archaic terms, which will confuse a lot of people and make this text difficult to read, and he outright omits pieces of the Edda. The most glaring example of this is in Völundarkviða . When I was teaching an Edda class, some of the students had this text, and it became obvious that Hollander omitted and obfuscated chunks (including no footnotes) to the point that the students with this text had no real idea of what happened other than “Volundr got some sort of revenge and then escaped somehow”. While I appreciate that bits of the Eddas and Sagas have material that will make modern readers uncomfortable, I find it inexcusable to try to sweep those bits under the rug and pretend that they don’t exist. I’d get this translation as an artistic copy, but its usefulness for study is severely limited. Terry, Patricia. (Trans.) (1990). Poems of the Elder Edda. - Terry’s translation is very blunt, so don’t expect the verses to flow like the original poetry. It’s an easier read, but she also chopped pieces out of the text whenever she felt a part was added in or changed by Christian transcribers, and she doesn’t make notes of where she did this. Thus, this is an incomplete translation and I found it less than helpful.   Older Translations:  These are free, but all contain outdated scholarship and disproven interpretations. Free sources are great to start out with when you’re new and on a tight budget, but take everything with a good dose of salt and invest in a modern translation when you can. If you only rely on older works in the public domain, some of your information is going to be inaccurate.   Gudbrand Vigfússon & Powell, F. York. Corpus Poeticum Boreale: The Poetry of the Old Northern Tongue. (2 vols.) (Free, available here. Both volumes are in one file.) - the scholarship is, obviously out of date (it was published in 1883), but there are lots of valuable historical notes and explanations, and some interesting biographical information. Wonderful because it contains both the Old Norse and the English translation, much like Dronke’s works. The second volume contains court poems, which after often overlooked.  Bray, Olive. The Elder or Poetic Edda: Commonly known as Saemund’s Edda. (Free, available here.) - wonderful because it contains both the Old Norse and the English translation, much like Dronke’s works. This was printed in 1908, so keep in mind that it will have older, disproven theories and interpretations in the text. Somewhat lacking in helpful footnotes. I like that each poem isn’t put in “the usual order”, as people tend to not realize that the Poetic Edda didn’t have a particular order or linear timeline. People later tried to arrange the poems to give a (false) sense of cause and effect, or linear timeline."

The Ouroboros often symbolizes self-reflexivity or cyclicality, especially in the sense of something constantly re-creating itself, the eternal return, and other things such as the phoenix which operate in cycles that begin anew as soon as they end. It can also represent the idea of primordial unity related to something existing in or persisting from the beginning with such force or qualities it cannot be extinguished. While first emerging in Ancient Egypt, the Ouroboros has been important in religious and mythological symbolism, but has also been frequently used in alchemical illustrations, where it symbolizes the circular nature of the alchemist's opus. It is also often associated with Gnosticism, and Hermeticism.  Carl Jung interpreted the Ouroboros as having an archetypal significance to the human psyche.  The Jungian psychologist Erich Neumann writes of it as a representation of the pre-ego ""dawn state"", depicting the undifferentiated infancy experience of both mankind and the individual child.

Here's another version of the same translation if you use the look inside and go to Grímnismál you can see it also doesn't have any ðs; that one's not a scan.  So I guess either everyone was working with a faulty source (that seems likely since Grímnismál in both versions looks like it's missing the first page talking about King Raudung) or the Edda was written in some dialect I've never heard of that dropped the ðs.   The only mention they make of spelling in the into is "" 'd' has been adopted for Icelandic 'þ', or 'th', since this has been done in previous versions, so familiar names such as Odin may be retained."" ha, what?

I don't see ""Óþinn"" like in my copy (I could have just missed it though).  I also don't see any eths, but again I find it hard to read and medieval ""d""s look a lot like eths anyway. So, since my copy is a scan of an academic publication from 1908 it's possible they were using the codex as the source? I need to match up some pages and compare them, the only similarity I've noticed in quickly looking over is like I said a (perceived) lack of eths.   So I guess the reason it doesn't match with online sources is that in those they've updated the spelling to standard old-Icelandic, while the codex is in an older form of old-Norse."

As far as I know, ""ø"" is another short vowel [œ], that fused with ""ǫ"" pretty soon  (and thus became ""ö"" in modern Icelandic).  ""œ"" [ø:] is the long version of ""ǫ"" (for exampel in ""bóndi"" [note the long vowel] >>> pl. ""bœndr"", with i-Umlaut). The modern Icelandic equivalent is ""æ"" (bóndi >>> bændur).  Note that the manuscripts don't have to be that consistent at all!

The sagas have many examples of walking dead (in fact I have another example in my Introduction, but I think the following would be the most useful to you). Good luck. Here is a relevant excerpt:  Ceremonies associated with death were perhaps most endowed with ritual and magical practices. Death was an opportunity to ensure the eternal well-being of a friend or relative. It could also provide the living with a powerful supernatural ally. Burial practices in Western Europe generally reflect positive attitudes toward the dead. The farther to the east in Europe one looks, one finds cultures increasingly concerned with the possibility of the dead walking after death. People regarded the deceased as malevolent and dangerous. These generalizations can be easily challenged by contrary examples from various regions; the diversity of humanity is key even though there are regional trends.  There is archaeological evidence of feelings toward the dead. In Western Europe, Neolithic societies buried the deceased in collective mounds where the bones accumulated. People made seasonal gifts at the entrances to these chambers apparently to procure continued good will from the otherworld and to ensure that departed loved ones would have a comfortable existence. In the east, prehistoric burials were typically solitary. It is not uncommon to find remains that were tightly bound in a fetal position. Individuals who seem to have inspired particular concern had rocks shoved into their mouths and large stones placed above their burials. These were apparently intended to keep the dead from talking and from walking from the grave. This sort of archaeological evidence can also be found in burials from historic periods. Again, any effort to see these contrasting traditions as rigidly defined by geography is called to question by exceptions.  The Eastern European tradition of the walking dead has diffused into North America thanks to the literary and cinematic use of the Nosferatu, the vampire. That said, the idea of walking corpses cannot be regarded as entirely an eastern phenomenon: the animated dead also played an important role in medieval Icelandic sagas. Here, the aptrganga maður – the “after walking man” – was especially troublesome and required the bravery and strength of a great hero to end its reign of terror. Chopping off the head of the corpse and placing it between the body’s legs was one of the only ways to put these monsters to rest.  Throughout European peasant society, there was also a great deal of concern about determining when a person had “passed over.” In modern times, it may seem obvious that death occurs when the heart stops. Even today, however, the line between life and death can be vague, occasionally requiring a judicially-determined definition. And even this can become the subject of political squabbling. In the modern world, death can be defined as brain-dead, but then there can be a question about whether or not it is appropriate, ethical, or legal to “pull the plug” to stop the heart from beating when the brain ceases to function. In traditional European society, the line between life and death was far more ambiguous. A person still living by today’s standards could cross over into the domain of death because of a disease, immense old age, or because of a curse. A large catch of fish or some other extraordinary circumstance might also signal the transition even when dealing with a healthy, young person. In the Icelandic sagas, these people were feigr, or “fated to die.” This is echoed in the archaic English word “fey” as in “he had a fey look about him.” In other words, the person was destined to die, and somehow the shadow of death had already descended over him even though his heart continued to beat. A person who had made this transition withdrew from normal society and activities, preparing to die. Society regarded the person as essentially dead.  In the same way, the dead could do almost as much as the living. Medieval stories tell of the dead walking, talking, eating, and having sex. Obviously, such occurrences were to be feared and there were many rituals and forms of magic intended to keep the dead in the peaceful quiet of eternal sleep. In contrast, there was also a wide variety of magical practices available for the brave few who would call upon the dead to do their bidding.  European folklore includes the idea that the time of death was pre-determined. There was a general feeling that a certain number of tasks or obligations must be completed before a person could die. Those who had committed suicide were forced to walk the earth as ghosts until the appointed time of their natural death. In addition, the place of burial was predestined. North American culture preserves the older European tradition of interpreting a sudden shiver as evidence that someone has just walked over one’s final resting place – a location that is as predetermined as the time of death.  People regarded a wide variety of events as foretelling death. A death would occur in a family if the Christmas candle went out, if the door opened by itself, if a clock stopped, if a bird flew into the house, or if a fox came near the door.  Death in the family required a constant vigil so the dead would have company. In many cultures, coins would be placed on the eyes to keep them from opening, something that can happen naturally with a corpse. Tradition required that candles burn constantly. In Eastern Europe, people believed that the dead soul continued to walk the earth for forty days, after which it could ascend or descend to its respective destiny. There was, consequently, a second funeral forty days after death."

There's the Elder Futhark, the oldest runes meaning that they were out of use before the viking age, and the Younger Futhark, which itself divides into long branch and short twig versions, used in different countries and possibly for different purposes. There is also the Anglo-Saxon/Frisian runes, but those aren't as relevant to the Norse. What you use depends on what you want. I have mostly seen Elder Futhark used in tattoos, being the oldest and sometimes associated with runic magic, but if you are going for the viking age then I would suggest long branch.

Its inscriptions are found on artifacts (including jewelry, amulets, tools, weapons, and runestones) from the 2nd to 8th centuries.  In Scandinavia, from the late 8th century, the script was simplified to the Younger Futhark, while the Anglo-Saxons and Frisians extended the Futhark which eventually became the Anglo-Saxon futhorc.

Norse,2fwxba,Weak-Lung,9,Tue Sep 9 20:38:09 2014 UTC,"Hey, archaeologist here, let me explain:  This fortress used to consist of a circular rampart of earth and houses within that, as well as some structures like gates, streets and (probably) graves.  Over the centuries since it was abandoned it was ploughed over, so the rampart can't actually be seen anymore when you're standing before it. It's just a flat field with very minor bumps in it. The fortress was discovered via airborne laserscanning where a 3d model of the landscape is being constructed down to the cm level.1 Which is why even the minor bumps show up so beautifully in the scan.  The next thing the team did after finding the structure2 is that they used a magnetometer to measure tiny fluctuation in the earth's magnetic field. This allowed them to actually see where humans had altered the soil: once again the rampart showed up beatifully.3  The actual excavation then concentrated on the rampart and the gate. What you would expect is a profile of the earthen wall which would look something like this just not as massive.4 You'd expect the gate to show up as a series of postholes, i.e. stains of discolored earth where wooden posts once stood. But they got lucky and actually found the wood from the gate itself! Probably because it was waterlogged and thus didn't get any oxygen which microorganisms need to decompose organic material.  This means that they can now count the rings of the wood and actually get an accurate dating of the structure. Though if everything we thought we knew about Trelleborgen is true we already know it will have been built around 1000 AD.  They haven't actually opened a trench yet where we believe there should be houses but there's plenty of time for that! All this is incredibly exciting for Viking Age archaology!    1 which also ignores vegetation.  2 it was probably already clear at that point what it was as this is a very distinctive structure.  3 as well as the internal streets if you look carefully.  4 This is simplified of course. Since it is ploughed over it would probably look more like this in reality."

So with a bit of luck and a lot of hard work we will know how many there were, how large they were and how they were built.   There might be graves outside of the fortress proper, yes. In Trelleborg (where these types of strctures get their name from) there were quite a few. But then again there are none at Aggersborg and Fyrkat so we'll see how it goes. Other structures that might show up are pits (there's almost always random rubbish pits or  storage pits in pre-/protohistoric settlements), wells or hearths (inside the houses)."

Norse,2fsqca,Electric_unicorn,9,Mon Sep 8 11:01:14 2014 UTC,I think cremation needs to be carried out by certain procedure. Then you may scatter the ashes where you like. But setting fire to a ship with a dead body would probably be difficult to get approved. I agree it's a cool way to go.

If you want a proper wooden vessel then I'm not sure they'd want burnt flotsam sunk in e.g. a lake. Nails might be a danger to swimmers, for instance.   Don't give it up, though. Ask around.

Some examples are...   Teutons (which is where the modern name ""Deutschland"" comes from—the T in Teuton became a D, hence, ""Land of the D/Teutons), the  Frisians (ancestors of many modern Dutch people) Alemanni (the French word for Germany still references them)  Burgundians (the ancient Kingdom of Burgundy and the modern region that pertains to it),  Franks (ancestors of the modern French) Lombards (ancestors of many modern Italians, particularly in Northern Italy) Visigoths (who had a kingdom in Spain, and are the ancestors of many modern Spanish and Portugese people) Angles, Jutes, and Saxons (later known as Anglo-Saxons) who invaded Britain and later became English through a complex process of cultural blending.   These people are all equally Germanic. They're all branches of that same tree, along with the Norse, and speak similar languages. We get confused as speakers of modern English, since our word for people from Deutschland is ""German"", when really, they are just a few varieties of a broad spectrum of Germanic people throughout history and that still exist today."

Norse,2fqgcp,ToffeeKing,3,Sun Sep 7 20:22:43 2014 UTC,"The ice age was over ten thousand years ago. Shortly afterwards, people migrated there and have lived there since, and most Scandinavians are still descended from these people.

Norse,2fdzzm,Pocanos,2,Thu Sep 4 22:42:34 2014 UTC,"Thank you! Yea, like I said I just wanted to get it right given the subtleties of both the Rune and the Ogham alphabets, the addition or subtraction of a single line can completely change the meaning of a stave. Here you can see the difference between the popular version you find online (left) and the correct version (right).  Oh and concerning the circle in the middle. The middle circle is a representation of the self; you are at the vortex of the runic power. When there is no circle, it is understood that the center is you. Similarly, when the circle is present, but empty, the meaning is the same: you are the center. The only time the charm changes is if the circle is filled with a symbol indicating that charm holder is not the center. That is, if you wanted the charm to be active for someone other than the one who holds it (like your family, brother, lover, whoever). In that case, you would gain consent to work the charm, and then you would craft a rune representing the person, and put that in the center."

Norse,2fd3t5,HeavyMetalMare,5,Thu Sep 4 21:41:52 2014 UTC,"Sadly this is basically incorrect. The paper in question is a few years old, and its greatest benefit is highlighting the importance of being critical of your methodologies - in this case, superimposing gender paradigms onto another culture and period; i.e. let's learn from this bad archaeology. The actual paper this, and similar articles, is referencing concludes: ""Another important implication of the osteological sexing results is that Norse women appear to have been present from the earliest stages of the migratory process, rather than, as the commonly held theory has it, arriving as part of a second wave after the great army had started to settle the homelands it had conquered.""  The important word there is 'migratory.' The paper in no way argues that women had an equal presence in military engagements, it instead is suggesting that comparable numbers of men and women were present in migratory movements during the Viking age - which is quite sensible when you think about it.   We know that there were a significant amount of women present in the early Scandinavian attacks in England, from the mycel hæþen here, through to the Anglo-Scandinavian presence in the Danelaw - and there’s is no doubt that the literary figure of the shield-maiden had a basis in historical fact in the period. However, there is no empirical evidence to suggest that women fought alongside men with anywhere near the frequency these articles are suggesting.  Warrior women certainly existed in Norse culture, and generally speaking women led far more interesting lives than the majority of discourse regarding pre-modern times would suggest - they had a lot more autonomy than many other contemporaneous societies. However, while we do find women buried with weapons, they are significantly less commonplace than their male counterparts (less than 10% would be a reasonable average, I think) and, more importantly, being buried with a weapon does not necessarily mean that the person in question was a warrior: there are burials of children in which we find weapons, but I doubt there were infants running around Northumbria sticking it to Æthelred.   Women in Norse societies certainly deviated from the narrative of housewives and chattel that is commonly depicted of the mediaeval world, but there is nowhere near the sort of empirical material required to support the claim that women fought in raids or military engagements in numbers comparable to their male counterparts. They certainly did fight, and it is vital that people know and appreciate this, but don't jump to conclusions because we really liked Lagertha in Vikings."

The only reason why I ever ignored atheism was because I thought that no one who didn't believe in my religion had enough proof to convince me otherwise, now I have realized that anything and everything on earth that we use as evidence is very incomplete so thats why atheists dont have all the answers, and religions started here on earth and they should be subject to change completely with advancing sciences."

You absolutely must get something better if you plan on continuing these videos.  Perhaps make a script for yourself, what you're saying is interesting, but you are a little too relaxed in your telling of these facts, and more importantly, you 'urm', 'errrr' and pause too often. A quick tip I learned about presenting something orally, when you feel yourself getting stuck between scentences and are about to say 'urm', take a breath and say ""now"" instead, it gives you the break an 'urm' would but it sounds more like you have control of what you are about to say next.

What really passes me off is that I'm being called a racist because I don't want Thor to be a woman. Marvel is also making Captain America black and the two changes are talked about as the same thing. This somehow leads people to say that since I dont think lady Thor makes sense, that I don't want black CA. I don't care if CA is black. That character is a captain in the military.

You don't need to seal the insides with anything either, but you might get a TINY horn flavor of your beer, mead or wine. But it's not very noticable.

Norse,2bv0yi,ThorinRuriksson,2,Sun Jul 27 16:35:36 2014 UTC,"Yes, well at the moment I have been put off lost wax generally, because without a kiln using just an oven the wax never seemed to fully melt out, and of course you can't reuse the wax model, only make copies. I would use wax now more for a master model for sand casting, though wood is probably superior in that it would hold up better after many castings. It is a nice idea to possibly sell these things yes, in any case I think it is best to support your own people's craftsmen and culture, then buying some foreign mass produced product made in a factory. I know those cans are tempting, but I've heard that they make so much slag and hassle that they aren't worth the trouble. It is an interesting idea though if it worked well."
Norse,2bv0yi,teslator,1 point,Sun Jul 27 16:41:45 2014 UTC,"You could also try using soapstone for your masters. Easier to carve than wood, no grain structure to worry about and will hold up to reuse pretty much forever as long as you don't make a habit of dropping it.   You can also cast directly in to soapstone, which means you can take two flat sided pieces and carve a negative into them, cut vents and a sprue like you would with sand and just reuse the same mold over and over again without having to remake a sand mold. As with sand, just make sure the mold is completely dry and a bit warmed up before casting to prevent condensation and steam blowbacks. I've had quite a lot of good results with mass production this way, including a recent project where I had to cast 300 coins for a friend in short order. Did them all with the same mold and then gave him the mold in case he ever wanted to make more."

That is one thing I have not tried yet but am getting more and more interested in trying, it seems like a much more traditional method too as I believe they have discovered artefact (soap)stone molds for casting mjolnirs with. I suppose its very likely they did use clay/sand too though. It looks like an attractive possibility, I will look into this!"
Norse,2burn4,captainfantastyk,8,Sun Jul 27 12:39:29 2014 UTC,"It's from the Völuspá, speaking of the fire giant Surtr.   Sutr ferr sunnan  með sviga lævi:  skinn af sverði  sól valtiva.   Which is translated to:   Surtr moves from the south  with the scathe of branches:  there shines from his sword  the sun of Gods of the Slain.   (This passage is an elaborate kenning speaking of Surt's fiery nature. Scathe of Branches, or Switch of Leaves would be a poetic word to describe the appearance of flame. The Sun is of course an embodiment of fire, but the element of fire is also closely associated with death, like in viking funerals and funeral pyres. It could also be argued that the halls of Valhall and Vanaheim would be shining with the fire of the hearths and torches illuminating those places. So Surt comes from the south carrying a sword shining with the fire he brings.)  Compare val-tiva with words like val-kyrja (chooser of the slain) and val-halla (hall of the slain). Tiva/tivar is a word meaning gods, related to the god Týr (Tiw, Tiwaz - meaning 'god'), and would through PIE be related to words like deus and deva."

Norse,2bj8a1,itsallfolklore,4,Thu Jul 24 03:16:31 2014 UTC,"The Viking Answer Lady, who often has great information, suggests that the Aurora Borealis is not mentioned in Old Norse literature - an abscence confirmed by other posts here. She identifies Bullfinch's Mythology as the source of associating the Northern Lights with the Valkyrie. She suggests: ""Once again, there is nothing mentioned in the Old Norse literature that substantiates this assertion, and it can only be taken as either a fanciful interpretation, or perhaps an accretion from later folklore that arose after the end of the Viking Age."" I looked through several obvious sources on Scandinavian folklore and the indexes are silent on the subject. Great question."

Norse,2bj8a1,Haerverk,6,Fri Jul 25 12:54:36 2014 UTC,"Not really. In 1895 (or around that time at least) a man wrote about it being the armor and weapons of the Valkyries glissening. I think they thought it was Bifrost. The Norse never referenced Nothern Light, so it is possible that the Magnetic North Pole was considerably farther away from this region during the centuries before the documentation of Norse mythology, thus explaining the lack of references.  The first Old Norse account of norðrljós is found in the Norwegian chronicle Konungs Skuggsjá from AD 1230. The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from Greenland, and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires, that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side, or that glaciers could store energy so that they eventually became fluorescent.  Personally, I think the Norse saw it as Bifrost."
Norse,2bj8a1,Radagastbrown,2,Thu Jul 24 07:54:46 2014 UTC,"Was taught in elementary school that it was thought to be the Valkyries arriving to choose which of the fallen to take back to Valhall, (Val = of the fallen, btw). But I've never seen this scoured in my rather extensive reading. It was likely feared like most other natural elements in Scandinavian folklore. We put sinister forces behind everything from the mere mist to the mountains themselves (Huldra, Troll) . Even a white lilly resting on a quiet tarn is likely something gruesome waiting and fishing for fools.(Nøkken) etc etc"
Norse,2bj8a1,Black-Muse,2,Thu Jul 24 10:18:41 2014 UTC,"When I was doing my masters in Norse Studies at the University of Iceland, I asked my professor the same question. He told me that northern lights were mentioned two times in the sagas and that they were only mentioned in passing, no explanation for their existence or anything. Unfortunately, I cannot remember which sagas they were... I was taught that we cannot know that they thought of them and that anything you hear from other people or sources is likely assumption."

Norse,2bc5dh,Pocanos,1 point,Tue Jul 22 16:28:45 2014 UTC,A vegvisir to guide him to health?
Norse,2bc5dh,GaarenFinlay,3,Mon Jul 21 23:36:55 2014 UTC,"From what I understand of the vegvisir it is primarily for being lost, eg at sea in a storm. I've always used Thurisaz, Algiz, and the Ægishjálmr when I feel the need for protection. As for health, I've got nada.  Edit: I suppose there could be multiple forms of vegvisir, but I only know one (thanks google) and I would be at a total loss as to where to start with writing another form of vegvisir."
Norse,2bc5dh,squid_tree,1 point,Tue Jul 22 00:58:57 2014 UTC,"I would say to steer clear of thurisaz because while it does have a protective or defensive it is also associated with severe physical pain, which would be extremely counter-productive. Until you really know what you are doing with the runes I'd say hold off on using that one because it can often do more harm than good. I'm not saying it never has positive uses, just that it must be used very carefully.  I would say that tiwaz would be a good choice, as part of its aspect is being able to take a hard situation and use that hardship to grow and improve your life, reversing negative power by turning it around into something helpful.  Algiz is the obvious choice for protection.  As others have said, wunjo is a great source of encouragement and could definitely be helpful.  Fehu is a solid choice, but be aware that whatever runes it is next to will become supercharged by its outward explosive energy. Putting fehu next to thurisaz could have devastating consequences, but putting it near algiz could form a much more powerful protection. So be careful in the use of this rune as well.  Another note in general about rune usage, remember that the ""gift for a gift"" principle is always in play when dealing with the runes, so be sure to offer the proper respect, honor and remembrance of the ancestors, the gods and the runes themselves, as these are some of the simplest ways to grant them gifts. If proper offering is not made, the runes will either not convey their power or will draw out energy from you or your friend in an unhelpful way.  I hope I've been helpful, hail to you and your friend, I hope for healing, protection and happiness!"

Norse,2bc5dh,TryUsingScience,1 point,Thu Jul 31 19:13:08 2014 UTC,"Fehu is a good all around luck and wellbeing rune in addition to more literally meaning wealth/cattle.   Wunjo means joy, never a bad thing.  Berkano is related to pretty much everything earthy and has one meaning of renewal, so that's a good healing one. Laguz is similarly related to flowing water and that also has connotations of healing.   Algiz is a good all-purpose rune for protection. I wouldn't associate it with healing, but perhaps with preventing things from getting worse.  Thurisaz can also mean trouble, so just be careful with that one. I disagree with those who think it's always bad - any rune can be good or bad - but it is one of the trickier ones.  You could use some runes more directly, like Isa to cool a fever, but I would strongly advise against it unless you're an experienced rune user and that doesn't seem to be the case. Too much Isa is not something you want, sick or healthy."

Norse,2b6zzu,IrreverentPriest,14,Fri Aug 1 16:32:31 2014 UTC,Odinists tend to be more folkish.  This is a term for those who view Germanic Heathern/Paganism as a ethnocentric belief system.  The well meaning folkish practitioner sees their belief to be ethnocentric in the same way as the native american tribes or jewish people are.  Unfortunately there are some who are going to take this to the extreme and since there a lot more folkish Odinists than Asatruars there tend to be more outright racist Odinists as well.

Norse,2b6zzu,IrreverentPriest,5,Mon Jul 21 05:44:42 2014 UTC,Yes basically I was suggesting that the reason that so many Odinists seem racist is because they are most all folkish.  While there are people with folkish views in Asatru we tend to be more open.

If you want to convince them that they have enemies, when they don't, convince them that the rest of the world resents them. If you want to convince them that the rest of the world resents them when it doesn't, convince them that they're somehow special - that they're the purest, or the strongest, or the most blessed - and they'll convince themselves that the world must be resentful, and if it appears that it isn't, the rest of the world must also be deceitful as well, and hiding their malicious intent."

It was the left that gave African Americans the right to vote in their own country, while the conservative right fought against it; it was the left who ended segregation, while the conservative right fought against it; it was the left who stopped schools from forcing non-Christian students to pray Christian prayers, while the conservative right fought against it; it was the left who defended the rights of gays and lesbians to marry the person they love, while the conservative right fought against it.  Leftist values protect white natives as much as anyone else. They just don't preserve unjustified privilege.  That said, there's no doubt that every political movement uses these tactics, regardless of the legitimacy of the threat. The only question is whether the principles that they ask you to pursue after gaining your trust is to the detriment or favor of freedom.  Liberalism, being the pursuit of liberation and the abolition of authority, is more likely to preserve freedom, where as conservatism, being the pursuit of tradition and preservation of authority, is more likely to be a detriment."

Norse,2awue6,JKdriver2007,3,Thu Jul 17 01:00:15 2014 UTC,"Okay, first let me start by saying, VincentAGabon, I am not trying to step on your toes. But I do have some experience with darkknightarmoury that OP may find useful.  I have ordered two things from this site and was disappointed in both. In the same order, I bought a shield boss and a bearded axe. The shield boss as I linked below stated that it was six inches. This one was more so my fault because I figured for a shield boss to be functional, it needed to fit a hand inside and that must mean they are talking about the six inches inside diameter. It wasn't. It was six inches total diameter and it apparently was not meant to be functional, I just wish they would have stated that before I bought it. But on the other hand I could have called to confirm so I take most of the blame for that one. Here is the link to the site and a picture of me after opening it (hand for reference).  Imgur  http://www.darkknightarmoury.com/p-3142-steel-boss-6-inch.aspx  So up until this point I forgot to mention that both items were claimed to be in stock and it turned out neither were and I waited about six months for the axe, I was going to cancel but forgot about it completely. When the axe arrived, to my surprise, it seemed really nice. The head was solid, well-shaped and very sharp with a mirror like edge.  After playing around with the axe a bit, it started to wiggle on the haft. It was simply attached via adhesive and came right off. You may or may not have seen my post a couple weeks ago showing what I did with the axe head, so it turned out okay, but I was very disappointed in my purchase considering it was not cheap. Here is the updated version of what I bought (it’s a little different than the old one they sold but still very similar).  http://www.darkknightarmoury.com/p-99-bearded-axe-antiqued.aspx  The last and most egregious story I have with darkknightarmoury comes from my friend’s purchase.  For just under $600 he bought a set of Roman armor. Here is the link.  http://www.darkknightarmoury.com/p-1149-red-plumed-centurion-armour-set.aspx  Soon after receiving it in the mail, he called me and asked if he could bring it over to see if maybe he was missing something on how it was supposed to fit. When he showed it to me, it became immediately apparent that it was not meant to fit a human. One of the leather shoulder straps was about the right size while the other was so short that the top plate dug into the wearer’s armpit. One side of body piece was curved to fit someone quite skinny and the other someone a bit larger. The weird thing about it though, was the fact that the larger side’s plates were spaced out much tighter, making the bottom of that side much higher than the one of the skinnier side. It was also quite an inconsistent curve the whole way around the body which made it sit awkwardly. Surprisingly the helm was pretty decent except for the fact that the horse hair part had a broken piece, making it impossible to properly attach it.  So in closing, I am not saying that you should not try them out for the Norse helm because they probably have many different suppliers, some probably better than others. I am simply trying to offer you some first-hand anecdotal experience with the site to help you make a better informed decision. And I unfortunately have no experience with any other sites that sell this type of merchandise, so I will refrain from offering any advice in that regard.  And again, VincentAGabon, I am not trying to rip apart your suggestion, I just have had bad experiences with that site. If you have had good ones, please share because they have a lot of cool stuff and I really want to like them, I just can’t with the experiences I have had. I hope this helps."

It came corroded and asymmetrical and when I tried to return it they fought with me on it. It was a month long ordeal which ended in me just having to pay the shipping to get it back to them. Which was still a hefty $63...  I absolutely do NOT suggest making any purchase from them.

Norse,2abd8l,I_LOVE_CATS_AMA,3,Thu Jul 10 07:32:35 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure about post-marriage hairstyles amongst Viking Age women, though there is very little evidence to suggest that long loose hair was very popular. Being the hygienic people they were, it makes sense that hair would be either kept up and tied with a scarf or a knot made with the hair, so as to be out of the way, or covered with a type of cap or scarf, to keep it clean. Surely it also depended on the region, event formality or social class. I believe thrall women were required to wear their hair cut short and worn loose to identify them as thralls."
Norse,2abd8l,GoAViking,5,Thu Jul 10 09:06:56 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure-- how do married women where you're living wear their hair? Braided, not braided, hats, no hats? The problem with historical fashion choices is that most of what we know has to come from paintings, and most paintings are either super formal or they're just artist imaginings of some event. But for most of their history, Norse ladies were Christian dairy farmers. Medieval christianity did have some views on the covering of female hair, so caps aren't out of the question. If you're looking for advice  for costuming purposes, it actually matters more what the modern conception of a Norse lady would be. So. . . braids and a cap, sure. Are you asking for a wedding? Because traditionally, in Europe for most of the middle ages, it was customary for hair to be worn loose at weddings. I'm not sure the Norse would be an exception. Otherwise. . . it was super cold, so hats are a probability, and shampoo wasn't really a daily thing, so braids are pretty much a certainty."

However, you seem knowledgeable on the subject so I'm going to ask you this: His grandchild and great grandchild had documented nick names or titles the father was ""Elder Godstone"" and the son was ""Little Godstone"" do you have any clue as to what that meant?"
Norse,29cu9g,valhallaswyrdo,2,Sun Jun 29 17:10:03 2014 UTC,"Elder Godstone was the nickname of Eldi Posteinn Storrisson. I could imagine Elder Godstone to be a loose English translation sinc Eldi doesn't translate to Elder (ellri). Eldi can derived from Elding (dawn), eldivðr (firewood), eldr(fire) or maybe elli (old age).   Posteinn on the other hand, I have no clue. Steinn is stone or rock. When you write Posteinn with runes however it can be transscribed as Bustin ~ Bostæin ~ Posteinn. Bú can be translated as farming, farm, dwelling or livestock.   Posteinn could be Farmstone ~ Farm/home of stone. But take that as you will.   Btw Storrison hints at Eldi being his son and not grandson. Just my two cents :-)  One of my last names is Tolboe, which is derived from toldbod (tollbooth, tollgate). But Tolboe may also be from Norse. Tól (tool, instrument) maybe tolla (adhere) and Boe (home, estate). Tolboe could be tool-home (toolshed) or where someone like a carpenter lived. If we go with tolla it could be referring to someone who always lived the same place or rarely left home.   Boe is also another name for Odin's son Vali."

And I just double checked to make sure and Eldi is the grandson of Storri. Storri's son was just Storrison and Eldi took Storrison (his fathers name) as a second name. Where the Story/Storey surname begins. That is very interesting to see with your last name as well. Your great 10 grandpa could have built his fair share of mead halls if the carpenter  possibility is true, or he could have been a hermit-esque scholar with a life devoted to Odin and literature. Thats remarkably cool. Do you know anything of the locations of your namesake? If they were in Sweden around 800-1100 maybe our ancestors were mead drinking buddies."

The manuscript has tons of other runes and symbols which are clear examples of this sort of syncretism, such as this (that's pretty much just modern magical sigils).

The Ingvar expedition was the single Swedish event that is mentioned on most runestones,  and in number, they are only surpassed by the c. 30 Greece Runestones and the c. 30 England Runestones. It was a fateful expedition taking place between 1036 and 1041 with many ships. The Vikings came to the south-eastern shores of the Caspian Sea, and they appear to have taken part in the Battle of Sasireti, in Georgia. Few returned, as many died in battle, but most of them, including Ingvar, died of disease.  The expedition was also immortalized as a saga on Iceland in the 11th century, the Yngvars saga víðförla, and in the Georgian chronicle Kartlis tsovreba, where king Julfr of the saga corresponds to king Baghrat IV.   Beside the Tillinge Runestone in Uppland and a rune stone on Gotland, the Ingvar Runestones are the only remaining runic inscriptions that mention Serkland.

I can't tell you where to get anything pre-made, but I've wondered this same thing myself and have toyed with the idea of making something for myself.   We know that aside from the raven, heraldic devices really weren't used by Norse people of the viking age. Kings and great lords who came after, yes, adopted the heraldic customs of the south and west once they consolidated their rule, but the raiders wouldn't have carried any images but for the raven.   We do have evidence - both physical and from the sagas - that color schemes were used by viking lords. For instance, shields were painted certain colors not just for use in battle, but to decorate the gunwales of ships in port. The famous shields found with the Gokstad ship were painted yellow and black.  If you're really looking for something badass though, and willing to make it yourself, I'd say the best thing would be to find a picture of a beast-head from an old ship prow, and model it on that. It's even that much cooler when you consider that the vikings didn't screw around with pretty pictures on their shields to let you know who they were; they simply got in a boat and came for you. And the first and only thing you needed to see to understand who was coming was that ship-prow. Hope that helps"

They are very popular among some reenactors (especially SCA), and I wear them myself at events, but they were not a fashion of the Norse.   In fact, if you're thinking of a belt at all, the types of belts they DID wear are much more in line with our modern idea of a belt. Essentially, they had all the same parts: a strap, a buckle with a tongue made to go through holes etc... The biggest differences were that they tended to have metal bits on the end (which some of ours still use today), and that the metal parts were often much more ornate than anything you'd see today. Here is one example of a historic style buckle. Here is another site selling several examples of belt fittings that would be more in line with history. Shop around, find some you like.   There are probably other ways to incorporate the ideas you're looking for, but the repeated suggestion of the ring belt was one I thought I'd address."

There have certainly been other Viking-era helms excavated, and in varying degrees of 'completeness'. There have been partial helms found in Denmark, especially at Tjele, and in Gotland; as well as scattered pieces from other sites. They've found 'brow pieces' in the ruins of Hedeby, maybe a smith had a shop and we found some scattered pieces he had on hand for repairs.   There have also been helms or parts of helms unearthed mainly in continental Europe, especially Kiev and Novgorod. While much-debated fragments have been found in the British Isles (including a good one with a nasal piece from the River Thames), another great example of a nearly complete helm is the 'Wenceslas helm'  And also, like KingAmazing said there were lots of things that happened to helms. Not only were they a rare thing for most Norse people, but they were passed down for generations and often the chunk of iron was very valuable long past being bashed in by an axe. It's important to remember the value of a good helm during Viking times. A sword was worth a dozen milk cows - a finely-crafted item such as a war helm would have been an exceptional display of wealth. There simply were never that many of them; they were status symbols of the military elite, and they were used for as long as possible.

This Viking helmet was excavated on a farm called Gjermundbu in Ringerike in central Norway. Gjermundbu is located in Haugsbygda, a village in northeast of Hønefoss, in Buskerud, Norway. The helmet dates to the 10th century. This helmet was made of iron and was in the shape of a rounded or peaked cap made from four plates after the spangenhelm pattern. This helmet has a rounded cap and has a ""spectacle"" guard around the eyes and nose which formed a sort of mask, in addition to a possible mail aventail. The eye guard in particular suggests a close affinity with the earlier Vendel period helmets. From runestones and other illustrations, it is known that the Vikings also wore simpler helmets, often peaked caps with a simple noseguard.

May it serve as a source of inspiration in difficult times, as a reminder that your word can be worth more than Gold, or less than nothing, and as a constant reminder to unwaveringly accept the consequences of your actions."

If you are okay with that and understand you may have to explain yourself to people from time to time that's cool though.  Unless that is what you were going for in which case not cool?

The average person walking down the street has absolutely no idea what an Algiz looks like, stands for, or the fact that it may possibly has negative connotations associated to it.

As for the symbol, as others have mentioned, it is a bind rune, a combination of different runes, though not necessarily all, but just those that are more meaningful to the person that made it.

How many beads, rings, and other bits of jewelry have we found in gravesites? Thousands. Now how many relatively-intact bodies have we found? Very few. As decomposition happened, it's possible that some trinkets woven into the hair or beard just tumbled off the person's body and came to rest somewhere else in the immediate area. It's also possible that people did this so rarely that we'll never even find a grave that suggests it was a practice.   I don't have the books in front of me now, so I can't reference and therefore won't act like I'm absolutely certain. But there were references in some Roman and Roman-era writings to Celtic and possibly some Germanic tribesmen who wore plaited moustachios and sometimes beards. And these would be bound at the ends by beads, or slips of leather. I'm thinking it was something from Jordanes, the Getica or something. And maybe I'm getting it confused because of the murky definitions between some of the northern/eastern Celtic peoples and the early Angles, Jutes or Saxons.   So...maybe? It wouldn't be a big stretch of the imagination to picture their ancestors doing it.    You should re-post this in r/askhistorians, might get a better response in there  edit: link"
Norse,275ahz,terker,4,Tue Jun 3 04:36:14 2014 UTC,"Women often wore strands of beads hung between two broaches or clasps used to pin their overdresses up (think overalls but instead of the buckle, they were broaches). I'm not sure if men did something similar, but beads all by themselves were seen as valuable and some as stand-alone pieces of jewelry. It was one way to display your wealth/power/status, so I imagine men would have an equivalent.   It's actually quite easy to weave a thread or ribbon strung with beads into a braid. You just hold the ribbon along with one section of hair as you're braiding, taking care that the embellished bits are turned outwards. That's absolutely something that women did, but again, no idea if it would be too feminine for a man to do.   The way I've understood it (and take it with a grain of salt because I can't find my references) is that beads were more a feminine thing - the kind of thing a man would bring home to his mother/sister/wife/daughter as a gift, and that served double-duty as ""look at my family's status that my female relatives have such nice jewelry,"" because especially nice pieces could be traded (as money) for goods, etc..."

It uses runes and Norse Mythology in its teaching based on oral tradition which he claims was preserved in his family.     In the 1990s, Ivar Hafskjold took on four personal apprentice students; Shaun Brassfield-Thorpe, Kolbjorn Märtens, David Watkinson and Graham Butcher. All contemporary Stav teachers belong to a teaching lineage directly from either Ivar Hafskjold and/or one of his first four students, each of whom are recognized as masters.  Stav resembles T'ai chi, with the student beginning with ritualized stances resembling the sixteen runes of the Younger Futhark.

""It is Hovs historical society which raises this Runestone in memory of Havgrím, and in memory of the worlds oldest thingplace (tingstað).

There are some pics at the bottom of the article.  From the wiki article on Hov   ""According to the Faroese Sagas and local tradition, the first Viking settler on Suðuroy established a farm in Hov, which is said to be named after his pagan hof. His grave is at ""undir Homrum"" in Hov and is the only chieftain burial site to be found on the Faroes. Hov lies in the middle of the island and the area is flat and wide with a good view out to sea. This enabled Suðuroy's first settlers to follow exactly what was happening on the sea around.  The viking Havgrímur who was chief of half of the country lived in Hov in the 10th century.[3] His burial plot is located in the hills above the village, but was largely destroyed when opened in by amateur archaeologists in 1834."""

Norse,266s18,Rohasfin,3,Thu May 22 20:18:26 2014 UTC,"That's an important step... let's see:  At a first-glance reading, I see ""Nyd Byþ ntru an brsman vsrþeþ hi þth aft niþa btrnum ta helpe and ta halm gehvaþrm gif hi his hlymath arar"" scribed in a mixture of younger Futhark and medieval / Latinized futhark runes. Which, if I recall correctly is close to, but not quite what you're looking for.  There appears to be a... regular irregularity... to the letters chosen, and this is seems to throw off my quick reading of it.  In particular, there seem to be ""S"" runes from older and newer styles used from word to word, and the sign that looks like ""M"" in a bindrune with it's own merkstave seems to be used for an ""eo"" conjunction in one word, and an ""st"" conjunction in another.  On the whole, my appraisal is that you're very close, but a bit of polishing will serve you well."

Norse,265ooa,necropants,5,Wed May 21 22:51:46 2014 UTC,"Many of the ""vikings"" converted on their own, but those were mostly farmers buying into the peaceful aspect of Christianity. Many were baptized by the sword, others for political reasons. Kings converted their kingdoms to Christianity as a political move to gain control over all of Scandinavia. Iceland was converted via threats from Norway. All Icelanders in Norway would be killed and trade ships would stop being dispatched to Iceland so Þorgeir Ljósvetningagoði decided that Iceland should be christened. The Normans converted as a means to gain more trust in trade for they were surrounded by christian nations. This is all just from the top of my head so feel free to correct me as you see necessary."
Norse,265ooa,Zhangar,8,Wed May 21 23:43:13 2014 UTC,"Yes, we converted to Catholicism in around 10th century. Harald Bluetooth is said to be the one to introduce Christianity to Denmark and while that is true, he pretty much only did it to stop a further invasion by the German Emperor, Otto I.  The German Emperor wanted to have his missionaries to spread Christianity in Scandinavia and when Harald Bluetooth told him off, the German Emperor invaded Denmark and Harald Bluetooth and the Norwegians fought back the Emperor. Bluetooth then created numerous defenses around Denmark to help fight back another invasion.   The German Emperor invaded Denmark again and the Norwegians didn't help us the second time and we lost. Slowly, over time, Scandinavia became Christian.  Take all of this with a grain of salt. Not much is known about this time and old history tends to be very one-sided."

Norse,265ooa,snbrgr,4,Wed May 21 22:58:24 2014 UTC,"Well if it makes you feel better the conversion was probably one of the most relaxed ones it could be, since people were still allowed to blót (sacrifice to the gods), as long as it wasn't done in public so it was mostly like ""so uh guys, for the record you are christians now if anyone ask... but if you should happen to worship the old gods we're probably not going to do anything about it"".  for some time there was this sort of dual worship, but obviously since the old gods couldn't be worshipped publicly it faded away.  I think this is where G.R.R Martin got the inspiration for the Starks to worship ""the old gods and the new"" in Game of Thrones.  If you want to know more about the specific act that made the king convert you can read more about it here though it isn't the best translation. (using bing translator because for some reason google had problems with the site)  tl;dr: the monk Poppo went to the Danish king in order to convert him, and had to carry the iron burden (a judicial practice where you had to carry glowing hot iron to prove your innocence). He succeeded and the king converted. I'm not sure how much truth there is in the story and how much is a myth, but that's the story we tell about Denmark's conversion."

Norse,265ooa,necropants,2,Thu May 22 19:36:58 2014 UTC,Christianity more of converted to the norse than other way around.   It's interesting because when the religion started the disciples were so non violent and fanatic they were willing to be put to death in a horrific manner because of the Romanian equivalent to the pledge of allegiance. Yet by the time the religion was norm amongst the nords Christian tombs had images of Jesus standing over his enemies dual wielding swords.
Norse,265ooa,TheNorthernSea,2,Thu May 22 20:46:49 2014 UTC,"Depends which 'vikings' you're talking about. In most cases, the conversion to Christianity in Europe was an economical decision; at least in the Frankish kingdoms the missionaries and priests brought with them new farming technologies that were incredibly beneficial, and so the decision was made.  Vikings is also the wrong word. Etymologically, 'viking' is a verb, meaning to trade or raid (this is linguistically contentious, but most accept this definition), so the 'vikings' were only a very very small percentage of the population, and would have been somewhat atypical religion-wise due to their contact with other cultures and therefore other religions (Byzantium, the Abbasid Caliphate, etc.). The conversion and decision to convert involved the 'less-spectacular stay-at-homes' rather than the traders and the raiders.  i can only really speak about Scandinavia, but for 3 different 'countries' (Sweden, Denmark, and Norway as we understand them today) there were 3 quite different responses.   Denmark was converted by Harald Bluetooth, as mentioned by the poster above, /u/Zhangar provides good information above about this.  Norway was much less unified than Denmark at the time, but the so-called 'missionary kings' of separate areas of the country made the decision to convert by their own reasons; perhaps for farming technologies, perhaps for trade, perhaps for personal ideological reasons.  Sweden is a completely different kettle of fish. Sweden at this time must be thought of as belonging to two sets of people; the Svear who occupied the Stockholm region down to the lakes Vanern and Vattern, and the Götar, who occupied the land further south (not including Skåne- Danish territory at that time). The Götar converted quite easily, the Svear not so much, and the King of the 'unified' Sweden - i.e. supposedly both groups- was removed from his seat at Gamla Uppsala and sent to Skara for attempting to impose Christianity on the Svear. The explosion of rune-stones in the Lake Mälaren area is seen as symptomatic of this change, among other things. By 1130 Sweden is generally considered completely converted, there being various reasons why this eventually took hold (religious syncretism - parallels identified by missionaries between Thor fighting Jormundgand and St George and the dragon, as well as the education given by the church - most 'vikings' were functionally illiterate).  If you want some good books, The Cross Goes North, ed. Martin Carver, and Power and Conversion. A Comparative Study of Christianization in Scandinavia, by Alexandra Sanmark. Lots of great literature about this, you want to search 'Scandinavia, Christianisation, Conversion, Religion' etc."

Norse,25znsk,Vossevangen,9,Tue May 20 00:55:04 2014 UTC,The shield looks great and your off to a good start. The Shield itself is perfect the way it is but if you ever wanted to kick it up a notch you can pick up a sheild boss from a few different websites for $25-35.   If you want to strengthen the wood itself and spice it up pick up 2 yards of cheap linen and some wood glue. Lay the linen down and wood glue it in place. Really take your time to smooth it out and get out the air bubbles. Lay the second layer of linen down so that the threads cross at a 45 degree angle to the ones below them. Apply a lot more glue and smooth out. Let dry for a few days and then paint overtop of it.   If you want to take it a step even further go to a pet store and buy some big rawhide chew toys. Soak them in water til they get soft and place them around the edge of the Sheild in such a way that they overlap at least half an inch on either side. Hold the rawhide in place with some clamps that you would use to bind together stacks of papers. (I'm drawing a blank on what they are called but they are the little black ones.) Once they are in place take a drill and drill through the trimed rawhide and the Shield. Once your holes are in place use a heavy needle to see it together with some sinew or imatation sinew.   This is how we make our shields for Jomsborg fighters.   Skol

Norse,25znsk,Pteleai,2,Tue May 20 04:37:27 2014 UTC,"You're thinking of binder clips as the clamps, Hodor. Also, the length of linen will depend on how big you're making your shield. 2 yards will normally do it. If you're really interested in the rawhide looking pristine and flat (the chew toys will look uneven), you could get a sheet from Tandy Leather Factory. Not sure how much it costs, but if you cut it straight, it'll look great. 3 inch strips will cover both sides of the edge of the shield (soak it in water too!). If you want to water proof it, put some shellac lacquer on top of the paint. You don't need any on the rawhide, but it won't hurt if you get a bit on it while painting. As for the stitching, use the Hand Stitching - 2 Needles from this site: http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/infoandservices/leathercraft-abc/leathercraft-abc-pg4/leathercraft-abc-pg4.aspx  Edit: adding the info about stitching"

It uses a smooth style of writing to get the information across and then backs it up with source material. I find that I become lost quickly when jumping right into the source material but, after reading a more layman’s version of the myth I have a much easier time. The book is organized with the creation at the beginning and Ragnarok at the end, but everything in between is not necessarily chronological. It talks about each of the major Gods and Goddesses and some myths of theirs. You will also get a sense for who the Norns, Valkyries, Aesir, Vanir, Giants, Dwarves, Elves and even some heroes are.

Maybe partially because of viking raids, many people in Europe moved into areas walled areas, so it would be hard for the vikings to attack. They didn't have any siege weapons.

Norse,25328l,Actkeen,14,Thu May 8 23:32:53 2014 UTC,"Woo—the blood eagle! One of my favorite mysterious practices...  /u/OnlyHeStandsThere is correct in that it's only mentioned in a few places making it difficult to ascertain the ""truth"" behind it.  In Orkneyinga Saga, ""Einar had his ribs cut from the spine with a sword and the lungs pulled out through the slits in his back. He dedicated the victim to Odin as a victory offering.""  In the Anglo Saxon Chronicle the viking chieftain, Ivar the Boneless, had the Northumbrian king, Aella II, put to death:  ""They caused the bloody eagle to be carved on the back of Ælla, and they cut away all of the ribs from the spine, and then they ripped out his lungs.""  The motif also occurs in Norna-Gests þáttr. Here, Regin carries out the execution of Lyngvi:  ""Regin then took his sword from me, and with it carved Lyngvi's back until the ribs were cut from the back, and the lungs drawn out. Thus Lyngvi died with great valour. Then Regin said:  'Now the blood eagle  With a broad sword  The killer of Sigmund  Carved on the back.'”  The question then becomes, was it really an historical method of execution? Or was it merely a literary addition, included for dramatic or symbolic effect?  One answer is that it could have been a genuine mistranslation of earlier Skaldic verse. Skaldic verse, such a that attributed to Einar, used a variety of metaphors. One such metaphor, representing a violent death, utilized the term “eagle’s claws.” According to the saga, after Halfdan’s death, Einar recited:  ""Mighty men of no mean race,  From divers mansions of the earth;  But for that they do not know,  These, until they lay me low,  Which of us the eagle’s claws  Shall bow beneath ere all be o’er.”  This, it has been suggested, could be the source of the Blood Eagle episode – a misinterpretation of Einar’s words, in which he simply states that his enemies will not know, unless they kill him first, who will die before the affair is concluded.  Anyway, you're not going to get a definitive answer since scholars are still debating on the topic. However, there's a fun podcast that you can listen to on the subject here."

Norse,24lln7,Micp,1 point,Sat May 3 05:36:35 2014 UTC,"well depending on what you want i know that modern Danish uses the word ambition just like that (ie. if you just write ambition it makes equally much sense in English and Danish). But then Danish (as most of the other Scandinavian languages) has moved pretty far from what old norse was like, and has adopted quite a few words since then.  If you want something closer to old norse you should go for icelandic as that is the language that has probably changed the least from old norse. According to google translate ambition in icelandic is metnaður, but i'd probably check with /r/Iceland before writing it permanently on your body.  EDIT: if you want a more traditional Danish word you could use ærgerrig, with is closely relation to ambition. it comes from ære (honor) and gerrig (greedy), and basically means always striving for something better. so pretty much ambition. Google translates this to icelandic as metnaðarfull."

But on topic: Neither Iceland or the Fareose islands (Or Finland for that matter) are considered Scandinavian. If you use a broader culutural definition, I'd include Iceland and the Faorese islands. Only to a lesser degree Finland since Finnish is not a Germanic Language."
Norse,24hsku,Strid,2,Fri May 2 03:00:15 2014 UTC,"That's interesting! I think there might be a linguistic divide here or something, since I've noticed that Nordic-language resources will typically refer to Iceland and the Faroes as ""Nordic"" while English-language scholarship would likely describe them as ""Scandinavian."" When it's necessary to draw a distinction, I've seen people use ""mainland Scandinavian"" to refer exclusively to Denmark, Norway and Sweden.   I think the norm among English-speaking scholars would be to describe the Germanic cultures as ""Scandinavian"" and the Germanic + Finnic cultures as ""Nordic."" Thus, ""Scandinavian"" = Denmark, Faroes, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, while ""Nordic"" = Denmark, (sometimes) Estonia, Faroes, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sapmi and Sweden."

Don't know a huge amount about the other countries, but if we are considering the Christianisation as the end of the Viking Age, it would obviously be earlier in Denmark and Norway.  Often the Norman conquest of England is seen as the end, in 1066, but that's sort of general, for the 'Viking' world at large.

Norse,2447ui,drdoom52,2,Sun Apr 27 21:12:12 2014 UTC,"What kind of mead is it?  My local ABC only stocks Chaucer's so I haven't tried any others.  Oh yeah, also Skål!"
Norse,2447ui,Chiron0224,2,Mon Apr 28 04:44:27 2014 UTC,"My favorite not-homebrew right now is Viking's Blood. The two variations we tried were both sweet but daaaay-um...SO good!  If you're stuck in an area with crappy selection, hop on over to /r/mead. There's a very very easy recipe in the FAQ, less than $20 USD per gallon usually.  Edit: Amazon link"

It's more of a satire on the law but it also has sensational/magical elements (the most famous is a scene where someone spontaneously combusts)."

Norse,246gfs,bix783,1 point,Mon Apr 28 22:26:01 2014 UTC,"You know, I don't remember Jo, but I read it probably about 10 years ago now."
Norse,246gfs,bix783,2,Tue Apr 29 22:57:55 2014 UTC,"It's definitely the one with the very long court case right?  Anyway, now I want to write a Victorian version of Njals saga where Hallgerd is abandoned at a foundling asylum and grows up as a swindler. Although it probably wouldn't be all that similar to the original.."
Norse,246gfs,CarnifexMagnus,1 point,Wed Apr 30 07:35:32 2014 UTC,"Yep, that's the one, Jarndyce v Jarndyce. And I had a scan and Jo is in that book as well. I should re-read that, I remember reading it in 300 page chunks of ""I can't put this down I can't put this down I can't... oh I need a break"".   I think that would be an awesome version of the saga. I'd love to read it if you do!"
