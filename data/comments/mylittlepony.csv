mylittlepony,3e2i7l,handbrah,4,Tue Jul 21 15:32:39 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no, the DeviantArt Sta.sh is described by the DA FAQ as follows:    Sta.sh is deviantART's new upload and publishing platform -- home to all of your images, writings, Flash/animations, and everything in between. Once you've uploaded something via Sta.sh, you'll be provided a special URL. This URL is known only to you and can be shared with others before officially publishing the work to your public deviantART gallery. But that's not all! While this version of Sta.sh is fully functioning, it will soon also allow the ability publish to other major platforms on the Web in addition to deviantART.    The Weird Al thing is also named ""mnadfun"" so yeah ... not even finished the title."

mylittlepony,3dzvft,ponytron5000,26,Mon Jul 20 23:13:26 2015 UTC,"Noise is a variety of sound. It means any unwanted sound. Sounds, particularly loud ones, that disturb people or make it difficult to hear wanted sounds, are noise.  Roland Barthes also observes that noise can be perceived either physiologically or psychologically. We perceive noise physiologically when we ""hear"" it. On the other hand, when we ""listen"" to a noise we are doing this psychologically.   Sound intensity follows an inverse square law with distance from the source; doubling the distance from a noise source reduces its intensity by a factor of four."

mylittlepony,3e2ory,Cinderheart,5,Tue Jul 21 14:46:42 2015 UTC,"Here comes the avalanche.    Of the Hive.  A five book long series with Game of thrones level of worldbuilding.  My family and other Equestrians.  The most cliched human in Equestria fic ever. One of my favourites. Now completed.  Stardust.  MLP and X-com crossover, has details in the author's notes if you haven't played the game. Sequel sucks though.  Project Sunflower.  Project Sunflower can speak for itself, it doesn't need me advertising it.  A Second Chance.  Just started this one myself, Twilight screws with time spells.  Princess Celestia: Changeling Queen.  It's right there in the title.  Background Pony.  Haven't actually read this one, apparently it has driven people to suicide. Very depressing I am told.  Anthropology  This is where the modern interpretation of Lyra came from.  Defender of Justice, King Sombra!  Silly romance fic.  Five Score Divided by Four.  I'm not linking to that, I don't want to get banned. Make sure you're reading the uncensored version, it's better.  The Chaotic Touch of Harmony.  A ponies on earth story that puts real thought into the social economic repercussions of having magic. Written by the same guy who did Of the Hive.  Past Sins.  The first story to have an Alicorn OC that wasn't a Mary Sue.  A Novel Tale.  A changeling Headcanon story.  Lyra's Confession.  Not linking this one either, this is clop that the author changed into an actual story halfway through writing it.  The Necromancer's Ambition.  Hope you have a good memory, because the author never repeats any mention of character traits. Good story though."

mylittlepony,3e2ory,Cinderheart,2,Tue Jul 21 14:47:30 2015 UTC,"Alright, let's do this! And I'm going to crush you at formatting, Cinderheart!  So, first things first, some short stories.      Cake Story by Blueshift  Simply put, Pinkie Pie comes to the startling conclusion that Mr. Cake is a cake. Literally.  This story is funny, but not just that. It manages to maintain a creepy vibe throughout, and it tells a satisfying story. None of that silly, entire story is the setup for a joke stuff here.    Nosflutteratu by Charcoal Quill  This one's a lot like Cake Story, but with the darkness turned up a bit more. It follows Twilight Sparkle as she begins to suspect that one of her friends might not be what she seems. I bet you can guess which friend is what off the title.    Fiddlesticks by Tigerhorse  On it's surface it's an Octascratch shipfic, and an adorable one at that. Underneath that, though, it's a great story about how Octavia learns to cut loose a little from Applejack's dad.    Plural Possessive by Aquaman  Dinky Do is a little filly with big emotions she doesn't understand. Sombra is a ancient evil tyrant who thinks emotions are stupid. Dinky Do and Sombra share a body. Antics ensue.    Princess Twlight Sparkle's 500th Birthday by Autumschild  This one's just some adorable interactions between Twilight and a small foal, with a dash of comedy thrown in. That's pretty much all that needs to be said.    Now for some longer stuff, to really tide you over.      Princess Twilight Sparkle's 505th Birthday by Autumschild  This story is the adventure sequel to Princess Twilight Sparkle's 500th birthday. This story frustrates me.  For all intents and purposes it should be bad. The the prose is super broken in a lot of places, and sometimes I had to re-read entire scenes multiple times to figure out what happened. The description is light at best, and some plot points are just dropped altogether.  But what really frustrates me, is that despite all that, I really liked this story. It's funny, and absurd, and really emotional. It tells a great story, even if it doesn't always do an amazing job of conveying what it's trying to say. I fully recommend this.    Through the Well of Pirene by Ether Echoes  If there was ever one of these where I didn't recommend this, you'd know I was replaced by a changeling. This is my favorite piece of fanfiction, neigh fiction, I've ever read. Don't be scared off by the Human tag. This thing is perfect in every way.  Just be warned, the beginning is a little slow. There is a bit at the beginning where you may think the author isn't writing Equestria correctly. Trust the author.    Anthropology by JasonTheHuman  This story follows Lyra as she tries to prove that humans exist. It's a bit weird, because it can very clearly be separated into two parts, and the beginning of the second part is a bit slow. You may want to stop reading when you get to the second part. Don't.    The Best Night Ever by Capn_Chryssalid  Groundhog day meets ponies in a way that isn't super dark like Hard Reset. Read about Blueblood trying to perfect the Gala. Over, and over, and over.    Alright, that's probably enough for now. Between me and Cinderheart, you should have plenty.  Oh, and if there is one thing you should take away from this list, it's this: Read Through the Well of Pirene. It is the best thing on this list. Read it."
mylittlepony,3e2ory,yay899,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:45 2015 UTC,"I couldn't muscle through the cheesiness of the beginning of Through the Well of Pirene. It felt like it wanted to be the Chronicles of Narnia.  I hated the Chronicles of Narnia.  Just because of you, I'm going to give it a second shot."
mylittlepony,3e2ory,Cinderheart,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:27 2015 UTC,I've made an impact on another person's opinions!  I can guarantee that it sheds that whole Chronicles of Narnia vibe and get's some real fantasy going. You just have to get through the begging. And at least a cheesy begging you have to muscle through is better than eight thousand pages of hobbits eating to muscle through.
mylittlepony,3e2ory,yay899,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:02 2015 UTC,"I got as far as the goblins in the carriage. Is that a ""well known"" scene?"
mylittlepony,3e2ory,Cinderheart,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure what you mean by well known? Either way, if I recall correctly, it's starts to get good a bit after Amy spends some time in Ponyville.

mylittlepony,3e2ory,mediumdeviation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:56 2015 UTC,"Personally I would recommend a curated list like the Royal Canterlot Library, which is generally considered to be one of the best recommendation and review groups out there (though they may not be the most accessible to new readers).   Otherwise I would recommend a few of the fandom's best authors and start from their works.

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,BroPony16,54,Tue Jul 21 02:44:48 2015 UTC,"""Oh great, another Fluttershy episode about learning to overcome her fears""  There's like, one episode about her doing that.   In Dragonshy, she does not overcome her fear of Dragons (she is still afraid in Dragon Quest). In fact she isn't even the one who learns something, the lesson is to never lose faith in your friends. Rainbow was doubting her the whole way up but she proved she could do it in the end. In Stare Master she learns not to bite off more than she can chew. In Green Isn't Your Color she learns not to keep her feelings secret from her friends. In A Bird in the Hoof she learns not to jump to conclusions. In Putting Your Hoof Down she tries to be assertive but misses the point. She learns that assertiveness isn't about being a huge jerk. In Hurricane Fluttershy she learns that she can make a difference. In Keep Calm and Flutter On, Discord is the one doing the learning. In Bats! she learns to not let someone pressure her into doing something she knows is wrong. In Filly Vanilli she learns to overcome her fear of singing in public. It Ain't Easy Being Breezies: the lesson is about how being too sheltering can be harmful."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,calmbrony,12,Tue Jul 21 03:08:05 2015 UTC,"In Dragonshy, she does not overcome her fear of Dragons (she is still afraid in Dragon Quest).    I mean... that's the whole tl;dr of the complaint you're addressing. Right? The complaint is that it looked like she overcame her fear in Dragonshy, but then clearly didn't. The very frustration people are having stems from the fact that it looks like she keeps getting reset to Square One in regards to her fear of stuff.  The problem that people are having is that many of these episodes have her overcome a fear, and people expect it to be permanent character growth (whether the episodes imply it as such or not) and then get frustrated when it's like the previous episodes never happened.   Overcoming a fear may not have have been the main moral of Stare Master or Hurricane Fluttershy, but they were absolutely large parts of them. The latter in particular -- boiling it down to 'she learns that she can make a difference' seems disingenuous. It's not like she decided to wait at home bored because she didn't think it'd matter. She wanted to help, desperately so, but couldn't overcome her fear of flying fast in a public setting. Certainly she would have overcome it a lot easier if she thought her contribution was larger, but it still remains that a giant chunk of the episode was her dealing with flying in front of others. She had a whole montage about it, several flashbacks, and almost failed in the end because memories of the teasing came back to her.  I totally understand that she was dealing with the result of the teasing -- feelings of inadequacy -- but I also totally understand the frustration after watching an entire episode of her unable to do something when ponies are watching (and seemingly realizing it's not that bad) and then getting another entire episode of her unable to do something when ponies are watching. Sure, we can look back on it in retrospect and say ""She overcame her feelings of inadequacy but not anything to do with her social anxiety,"" but I don't think that was at all obvious at the time -- people expected her to be better in front of crowds and then she just wasn't.   And then you've got Dragonshy and Stare Master, which both end with ""I'm so scared I'm so scared I'm so scared wait my friends are in danger RRRRRR I'M NOT SCARED ANYMORE!"" It can feel a little repetitive.   To be clear, I don't really suffer from this frustration myself, and I do think you make good points, but I also think the naysayers have a point too. Even if it just comes down to ""They should have been clearer about exactly what progress she made."" Villi Vanilli was great in that regard because it very explicitly established what she could now do (sing in front of friends) and what she could not do (sing in front of strangers); Hurricane Fluttershy kinda just ended with ""Stuff's better now yaaaaay!"""
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,TheeLinker,35,Tue Jul 21 06:04:54 2015 UTC,It's almost like she has a legit mental illness that doesn't go away just because she overcame it once!  Anyone who doesn't understand this has never had a friend or family member with social anxiety. It is fundamentally irrational and needs to be overcome one aspect at a time.
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Cinderheart,25,Tue Jul 21 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go so far as to label it a mental illness. It's more of a personal foible, a character flaw that she seems capable of overcoming on her own."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,TheKnackerman,7,Tue Jul 21 03:43:06 2015 UTC,"Social anxiety can be considered a mental condition in some cases. In others, it can be a symptom of another mental condition, thereby being an extension of one. In the purest form of it, it is often a mere personality quirk, but I have personally seen severe social anxiety as a genuine mental condition. (Anxiety issues are very difficult to deal with for some people)   As an example of the second point, I have/had social anxiety issues stemming from a larger mental condition. They were issues that took me until I was well into my college years to overcome, but in no way have I ever truly conquered them. Social anxiety takes many forms, just like pretty much any other psychological process."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Fluttershys_Disciple,7,Tue Jul 21 07:09:26 2015 UTC,"Well said. People widely underestimate the nature of mental conditions and personality quirks such as what Fluttershy has to contend with. And in my viewpoint, Fluttershy's case is something that could potentially be a bit more than just social anxiety. If so, the complexity of what she could to deal with would of course be multifaceted and in turn would need multiple episodes of various scenarios to address.   By extension, I'd be deeply interested to see the subject of mental conditions come up explicitly in the show. They could do so much if they touched on something such as Asperger's Syndrome."

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Pinkarlmena_Marx,5,Tue Jul 21 05:34:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair, those lines do seem like they were tacked on once the writers realized that the episode made no sense.

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,JamesNotaBot,4,Tue Jul 21 06:00:54 2015 UTC,"Treading on speculation, but ok, I'll bite. What if this hypothetical male Chrysalis also controlled Cadence like the normal Chrysalis did to Shining? If he could put her under his power, free eats for everyone!"
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,CCC_037,3,Tue Jul 21 06:06:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, if I had her under my control, I could do a lot more than just ""free eats""...      I'm going to assume that getting somepony under control like that is a long-term project; Chrysalis needs to drain the target's love repeatedly, slowly but surely layering spells on his mind to weaken his resistance and eventually take control over him. (Or her). We see her reinforce her spell on Shining Armour at least once, after all. It would probably take a week or so, longer if the target is particularly resistant (I'd guess that alicorns would be particularly resistant - so would Shining Armour, due to his cutie mark in defensive magic, but she had long enough to work on him). After all, at the final showdown, Chrysalis only controlled the pony she'd been working on for a few weeks already, and even when she was deliberately trying to get Twilight to kill Cadance, she didn't even try to zap her with mind control.  So, in other words, Chrysalis could control Cadance, but she'd be spotted a week or so before she could possibly complete her control spell."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,JamesNotaBot,4,Tue Jul 21 06:19:26 2015 UTC,"It's hard to pinpoint since we don't really have a concrete explanation of how Chrysalis' spell works or how powerful it is. In fact, we don't know how exactly 'power' is measured at all in this place. Does the captain of the Royal Guard prove weaker than the alicorn princess of love? Does Shining's militaristic features fall short just because Cadence is a higher level of pony, given that her specialty is only love? We're going to murkier waters if we keep this up.  However, what I can say is that Chrysalis also has another major asset up her sleeve. Deception not only can she forcibly bend someone's will, she's a pretty good con too. This male Chrysalis can take Cadence just as easily without relying too much on brute force, butter her up, if you will.  Either way, this is why hypotheticals are fun, they can spiral everywhere and anywhere."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,CCC_037,5,Tue Jul 21 06:27:51 2015 UTC,"It's hard to pinpoint since we don't really have a concrete explanation of how Chrysalis' spell works or how powerful it is.    I'm going to just assume that Chrysalis can take control over anypony as long as she can spend enough time with that pony, in private, over a period of weeks or months, without that pony suspecting anything is wrong; and that that control can be broken (and the pony in question will break out of it on their own if she doesn't regularly renew her control spell - which has to be done more often for more powerful ponies).     This would imply that she could take over either Cadance or Shining - and I'd actually assume that Shining would take longer than Cadance, due to his specialty in defensive magic.     However, it all comes down to the victim not suspecting anything until the spell is complete. Since Changelings eat love, it makes sense that love around them would act differently, and Cadance can probably pick that up on sight. Other ponies (Shining included), well... they can't.     So, in other words, Chrysalis needs to use her main strength, i.e. deception, in order to remain close enough to the target for long enough to mind-control them. And it is this strength that Cadance is particularly good at negating. It's not that Chrysalis can't control her, it's just that Chrysalis can't deceive her (or, rather, that her disguises won't work on Cadance).     She used deception to great effect in Cadance's absence; she deceived Shining long enough to be able to control him, she deceived all of Canterlot long enough to remain safely undetected; and she came very very close to deceiving Twilight into actually killing Cadance. That is not just ""another major asset"" - that is her strongest asset.     Actually, one has to wonder... if she wanted Cadance dead, why didn't she kill her herself? Do dying alicorns release massive pulses of destructive magic or something?"

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,CCC_037,5,Tue Jul 21 07:10:01 2015 UTC,"Land sakes! This isn't just a headcanon anymore, this is straight up fanfiction!   Okay, yes, I do tend to headcanon my way all the way to full-on fanfiction on occasion.   Wait, how do we know that male Chrysalis can't fool Cadence?   We don't know. There's no firm evidence in the show one way or another.  My chain of logic goes:   Changelings eat love. Therefore love acts differently around them.     Therefore, a creature that can see love can tell changelings apart from real ponies. It is reasonable that changelings can see love; they eat the stuff, after all, and invisible food is just going to be annoying.     Another pony who has a good chance of being able to directly observe love is Cadance; she is, after all, the Alicorn of Love; hence she can be expected to have some special abilities in that regard     And, yes, this would mean that Cadance's perception of the world is more changeling-like than pony-like. I think that sets up a potentially interesting dynamic..."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,JamesNotaBot,3,Tue Jul 21 07:20:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, but there's the assumption again. Despite all the shipping goggles and the shipper on board jokes, we don't know if, canonically, Cadence can see love. What we do know, is that she can will it into being, and that, I think, is the advantage of having a male Chrysalis in the first place."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,NoobJr,11,Tue Jul 21 07:25:48 2015 UTC,"I would've loved to participate in this thread, but since I made a vow to no longer talk about ponies, I'll just let past me talk about ponies.    Another major complaint is that Chrysalis' plan made no sense, but it does to me, and it's pretty good. She wanted to weaken the military's strongest defence, so she infiltrated herself, which is quite ballsy. She didn't intend to be caught and fight Celestia since she thought she was too weak, so it's safe to assume she wanted to backstab Celestia while the army was invading. Her monologuing about her plan was in fact buying time while her army hit the shield.  As for her acting mean in disguise, I take it as her personality coming through and abusing her position of power, while enjoying how nobody calls her out. When she did get called out, we saw her put a very believable act, AND we saw that she had mind-controlled Shining Armor to defend her in such a case. So she had ""wedding stress"" as an excuse all along."

But not quite, because Cadence's love power was introduced in part 1, in Twilight's flashback. She stopped a couple from arguing. Then, in part 2, she used the same power to break Shining Armor from Chrysalis's spell, and eventually banish Chrysalis to who knows where.  It was still a quick solution, though."

This explains why she thought Cadance restoring Shining with her love to be ridiculous: she not dumb, she just didn't know ponies were capable of that kind of magic!"
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Cinderheart,8,Tue Jul 21 03:12:19 2015 UTC,"I don't really consider the comics canon, or just B canon at best, but your point has been made.

Instead, her failure was a result of her own actions. Her rude behavior got Twilight suspicious of her, but even that could have been saved if she'd just accepted Twilight's apology instead of doing her whole hell-portal trick. Or at least, don't drop your guard over your prisoners just to gloat over them, while dismissively mocking two powerful magic users as they attempt to cast a spell together. It's not like it's unknown that ponies could come together to create great magical effects through the power of friendship/love/etc; it's kind of the entire story behind one of their major holidays.  Agreed on the monologue, though. Her cover was blown, it would have just been kind of pathetic for her to keep trying to maintain the act. Instead, it's better to drop the act and try to intimidate and/or stall them. The moment she was found out, she was going to have to deal with Celestia, and delaying that until her minions are closer is a good idea.  I wouldn't call her an idiot, but she made mistakes due to her pride (Or possibly sadism), and those mistakes cost her."

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Koncur,4,Tue Jul 21 15:35:02 2015 UTC,"She made two big mistakes.   1) After everyone turns their back on Twilight and she's left on the ground crying, Chrysalis as Cadence appears and strokes Twilight's mane as if she's going to forgive her. Twilight apologizes to her.   With Twilight in such an emotionally vulnerable state, this would have been the absolutely perfect moment to manipulate her. Twilight would have been desperate to win back everyone's approval. Chrysalis could have made a big show of forgiving Twilight, maybe apologizing for ""letting the stress of the wedding get to her"".   Seeing ""Cadence"" forgive Twilight would make the others do so as well. Chrysalis could even spin some happy ending speech about how even though Twilight was overzealous and misguided, she really meant well and her actions prove how much she loves her big brother. Everyone would make up, all would be forgiven and Twilight would give her lesson of the day speech to the Princess about not rushing to judgements.  After that, ""Cadence"" could ask Twilight that as her wedding planner, to help her manage her stress. Twilight would have been so eager to stay in her good graces that she would be following her around offering her hoof-rubs.  Her wedding scheme would go off without a hitch and she wouldn't need to show her hand early. The shield would go down at a moment of Chrysalis' choosing, and she would have the option of a covert infiltration instead of an open invasion.   But she's not an idiot for that one, she just got overconfident and greedy hoping that Twilight would kill the real Cadence. For the second mistake though, she picks up the Idiot Ball and jams it up her nose.  2)    10:04 - Chrysalis remarks that the love she drained off of Shining Armor has made her even stronger than Celestia. This proves she knows that love is a potent fuel for magic. 15:41 - Chrysalis scoffs at the idea of Cadence's love giving Shining Armor strength.    Chrysalis should have known better and taken that seriously. Instead of laughing and looking out the window, she should have used that time to separate them, open a cave portal under Shining's feet, blast him into unconsciousness, something like that."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Link245,3,Tue Jul 21 06:08:37 2015 UTC,"Chrysalis... eh... Chrysalis had a good thing going.  She was doing fine but in the end I don't think it was entirely her fault that resulted in her defeat.  I think it was bad writing.    The changeling army feeds off love, right?  Okay, then let's terrorize the citizens of Canterlot; that'll surely make them love us. Remember Princess Luna?  ""Who?""  And before you say ""well she was off doing whatever the Princess of the Night does during the day, which is probably sleeping,"" as far as we know she lives in Canterlot Castle. Who the hell tipped off Celestia that there was a threat in the first place? How did no one notice an army of thousands of changelings banging on the shield? Chrysalis acknowledges how powerful love is (she uses it to defeat Celestia... somehow(no, seriously, I get that love is powerful, but the love ""energies"" of one unicorn is enough to defeat a demigod?)) then does nothing when Shining and Cadance plan to use their love against her. What was phase 2 of the plan once Chrysalis married Shining?  Would the shield go down?  She didn't need to marry him for that.  Was she just going to live with him forever and feed off his love?  What about her army?  She didn't even expect to win against Celestia.  What was her monologuing going to do but allow her army to invade... only to be beat down by Celestia once Chrysalis was dealt with? The way she was written, she had a plan, she had an army, she was going to succeed.  But the plan didn't make sense and there was no end goal in mind.  I think that if you write a proper villain plot you should write it as if the villain were going to succeed well past what you show so it establishes that you have a second phase and a third phase with an endgame in mind. This video puts it really well.  In fact, it's where most of these arguments come from.  I think she had a ton of potential.  But it was wasted."

So, she is very much protective of Applebloom, people always say this came out of nowhere, when it didn't.

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,deltaphc,6,Tue Jul 21 04:43:40 2015 UTC,"The pacing in Magical Mystery Cure bothered me only on my first viewing.   When people say that the pacing in MMC was bad, I'm thinking that they're confusing ""pacing"" with something else. It's more that it's two episodes crammed into one, which makes it a bit rushed. I'll agree with that. But that's different from bad pacing.  Bad pacing would be if the conflict were resolved too quickly, or the episode picked up too slowly, or action-y moments were too short, etc. Given its musical nature and pretty much non-stop plot progression, I'd say that its pacing was pretty consistent.  However, was there too much to tell in one episode? Yes."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,PM_ME_YOUR_SWORDS,4,Tue Jul 21 03:45:20 2015 UTC,Feeling rushed in the story you're trying to tell is bad pacing.
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,NimbleWing,2,Tue Jul 21 07:30:44 2015 UTC,"I like the episode and have few issues with Alicorn Twilight, but the ending of that one did have some less than pleasant pacing. Most of the episode was about the incomplete spell, which was paced and presented well. The transformation, however, came out too suddenly, and with too little context and time to absorb events. One minute, she's solving the spell, and then she's suddenly disappearing and now a song and now an Alicorn and now a princess and now a coronation and now it's over bye.   I know there were reasons for it all, and I've personally seen M.A. Larson talk about it at a Con. But it really did end too quickly. Had it been separated or spaced better, it could have easily been one of my favorites, but it wasn't. I liked it, but I won't try to deny that the end was... a tad speedy."

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Upgrader01,25,Tue Jul 21 03:05:00 2015 UTC,"Funny thing: Mare Do Well is one episode that an extended version would fully save it.   Take the actual episode, add a scene showing Twilight and the others telling Rainbow she's bragging too much (and possibly risking lives for doing so), and have Rainbow not listen to them.  THAT makes the decision to steal Rainbow Dash's thunder as Mare Do Well a lot more understandable. In the normal episode, it comes off as if they jumped to the radical option first and didn't talk to her about it.  Oh, and have them not be jerks in Sugarcube Corner."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,I_Love_Pee,5,Tue Jul 21 03:21:01 2015 UTC,"I thought the complete opposite. The episode was incredibly shallow and repetitive, repeating a similar scenario over and over again.   I think the episode would have been fine if it was 11 minutes long. I guess Merriwether's previous experience with 11 minute cartoons had made her gain a certain feel for how storytelling in that format works, but when converted to 22 minutes, it just feels shallow and annoying.   In Wonderbolt Academy you could tell she learned from her mistakes and gave it a B plot with Pinkie Pie to fill in idle time instead of letting it drag on."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Upgrader01,4,Tue Jul 21 04:45:37 2015 UTC,"Two things:   If some of the ""Mare Do Well beating Rainbow Dash"" filler was replaced with the scenes I mentioned, the episode would've been better. Wonderbolts Academy was actually too long and had to get a shorter ending."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,TheKnackerman,6,Tue Jul 21 04:54:48 2015 UTC,People that like Rainbow Dash feel she was mistreated rather than the recipient of just comeuppance.

Yeah!  Why don't you, oh I don't know, sit her down and talk to her about it instead?   Shut up Spike, nopony likes you."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Link245,11,Tue Jul 21 03:59:14 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  They decided the best way to get RD to learn her lesson was to completely annihilate her self-esteem to the point of her emotional collapse.  Seriously, if my friends did that to me, they would no longer be my friends.  What needed to happen was for Twilight to go up to Rainbow and say Dash, stop.  You're being a jackass.  If you don't stop, we're gonna have to resort to more drastic measures to get you to stop.  Only because we're your friends who don't want to see you go down the wrong path. Talk about disproportionate retribution(warning, TV tropes link).  That's why I absolutely destest this episode.  I don't even consider it canon it's so out bad.  Plus, hydroelectric damns and steel-frame highrises(edit: I completely forgot about other instances of this.  But the dam point still stands)?!  It doesn't fit anywhere in Equestrian lore.

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,PianoCube93,2,Tue Jul 21 08:31:55 2015 UTC,Because talking some sense into Dash is proven to be an efficient way to change her mind (look at Tanks For the Memories).   My theory is that her friends skipped the talking because they knew it wouldn't work. At least not before doing some drastic actions first.  Their actions would have been better justified if they tried to have a talk first but I personally don't think it was a big problem.

When Dash was first being a hero and bragging her friends rolled their eyes and chuckled good-naturedly, but let it slide. Once she started asking for praise first they realized they had to do something, so they decided to show her by example how a hero should behave. It was never about destroying her self-esteem or being passive aggressive.   Like, never before had we seen that and not since have we seen it either.   There was another steel-frame building under construction in Pinkie Pride."

A little humble pie wasn't a bad thing in my view. Sorry if you disagree.  She'd moved beyond being a bad friend into being dangerously narsicsistic. If talking to her about it would've worked, I'm sure that's what they would've done, but it seemed like they had already been trying off screen for some time."

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,MagicOfFriendship,9,Tue Jul 21 16:09:57 2015 UTC,"""Rainbow Dash was out of character in Tanks for the Memories.""  She emphasized how she hates being alone in The Mysterious Mare Do Well.  Now, imagine a friend that's been with you almost 24/7, far, FAR more than your other friends.   Now, imagine losing that friend, even for just a few months.  Normally, we'd do something stupid. We're humans, we have a tendency to be so.   But this is Rainbow Dash we're talking about. She has her heart in the right place, but sometimes, she does things so drastic to fix a problem that pales in comparison to her actions. Consider Read it and Weep. It was just a BOOK. A single, freaking book. But it was important to her. That's why I stomached her making the hospital panic, what with her breaking in and everything.   The same applies to this episode. It is a stupid, STUPID action to stop winter, but she was motivated by a cause. For me, that's what gives her character depth - what makes her a three-dimensional character.   ""But she still did something stupid!""  What makes all the difference in this situation is her motivation. She's stopping winter because she wants to spend time with her pet? GASP! She's stopping winter because she wants to spend time with her pet? I don't approve.  But I understand.  The Fiery Joker once said that if we think a character does something he/she wouldn't do, instead of saying said character's out-of-character, why don't we take a step back to see if we understand him/her well enough? Because maybe we don't."

Not in this specific case, I agree that Rainbow's immaturity and short-sightedness are well-established character traits, but if in season 24 it turns out that Rarity's career as a professional water polo player is causing conflict once she's pregnant with Spike's baby, we might have some problems."

There's a difference between a bad written episode, and an episode that's purposely braking the fourth wall and story line to make jokes about the show.  It's the type of episode where they could have had the episode fully pause with the cameras cut to the VA's and writers in a booth to take a moment and thank the viewers for watching up until now.  It wasn't meant to analyze if the Changeling was in a canon universe."

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Dr_Zorand,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:49 2015 UTC,I still maintain that it was poorly written because the plot was lacking. It was a series of disjointed events loosely tied together by a wedding for two characters who had side rolls in a single episode several seasons ago. It felt like the kind of episode you would find on a generic Saturday morning cartoon instead of the usually high quality episodes that MLP does.

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,JesterOfDestiny,8,Tue Jul 21 07:43:26 2015 UTC,"Pinkie Pie in Filli Vanilli. It's like they've never seen her make an ass out of herself before. She's a social person, but as we've seen several times, she lacks social skills and has problems recognizing emotions on others.     To me it was clear she was trying to help Fluttershy, in her own way. She was trying to over exaggerate her fears to the point of meaninglessness, which is a method I personally use. She just didn't realize it wouldn't work on Fluttershy."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Link245,7,Tue Jul 21 05:50:21 2015 UTC,"To me, she was completely out of character.  I think this video explains it perfectly.  There's being Pinkie, and then there's being... whatever that was."

What Pinkie did in Filli Vanilli showed she had good intentions (warning Fluttershy of the dangers of stardom at the beginning and telling her she did a great job later), she just worded herself terribly and spoke without thinking, which IS in character for Pinkie.  Not to mention, no one acts consistently all the time in real life. Just because one of the main characters is a jerk, it doesn't mean they're out of character, even if it is Pinkie Pie."

Remember Griffon the brush off? There is a line from that episode I'd like you to remember.    The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is. I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that. No. One.   And it's not like Amy has a great track record, having written both MMMystery on the Friendship Express and Bridal Gossip, in which the elements of honesty, generosity and kindness all lie, steal and ruin her friends work and the one where the elements of harmony and friendship are all racist idiots.   Unfortunately Griffon the brush off is really the only episode  with lots of Pinkie/flutter interaction but based on stuff like Pinkie Pride which Amy wrote, being willing to give up being ponyvilles party planner because Dash wasn't having fun on her birthday, it really is out of character for pinkie to make Fluttershy cry."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,JesterOfDestiny,3,Tue Jul 21 11:44:16 2015 UTC,"I can only repeat myself.   To me it was clear she was trying to help Fluttershy, in her own way.

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Phoenix_Dragon69,6,Tue Jul 21 07:33:38 2015 UTC,"Alright, I got more.  **Twilight's Kingdom**:  ""Celestia's plan was flawed.""  Celestia: ""I'm afraid I put too much trust on Discord.""  A.K.A ""I made a mistake and I am fully accepting that.""  I still understand the complaints saying that the plan should be better, though. I just thought I'd point out that particular line.  However...  ""The conflict was resolved through a deus ex machina!""  If a deus ex machina means something that was built up for a whole freaking season, then you are absolutely right.  **Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep**  ""Luna is being melodramatic. She never hurt anyone when she was Nightmare Moon.""  Ignoring the fact that she hurt her own sister, yes, Luna never hurt anyone when she was Nightmare Moon, but the implications of having eternal night sure assures that someone will get hurt. Without the sun, how would the ponies grow crops? Without the sun, how sure are you that the ponies will NOT panic? Without the sun, how sure are you that no one, I repeat, NO ONE will get hurt?  ""She learned nothing. She should have told her sister what she was feeling.""  But she didn't. That was the point of the episode. One thing that I love about this episode is that it tackles an extremely mature moral. Yes, she could've told her sister, but she didn't. Why? Because she felt gulity. Because she felt like she should be punished for the mistakes she had done.   ""That's just stupid.""  It is. It truly is. But it has happened to people. And people can do stupid things.   And that's OKAY. It's what makes us humans. We're not perfect and we never will be.   That's what makes Luna is a character. She made mistakes, and she learns from it. Is that mistake caused by faulty reasoning? Yes, yes it was. That's what makes it a mistake. Is making that mistake a good thing? No. No it's not. That's why the conflict was centered around it. Is making that mistake possible?  You better believe it.  **Amending Fences**  ""Twilight is a bad friend! She forgot her old friends in Canterlot!""  You're not Twilight. You're you. Twilight was, take note of that, was, an introverted bookworm nerd with little to no social skills.   Can you imagine a character like that remembering every single friend she has ever made?  And besides, this has happened before. People make new friends, then make other new friends, and sometimes forget about them. Such is life. One must learn to accept that.  Heck, Twilight's friends did.  Well, except Moondancer.  But that just brings me to:  ""Why didn't Moondancer just ask Twilight again? Pretty stupid, if you ask me.""  ...  **sigh**  Ignoring the fact that this has happened to people before, and that you are not Moondancer:  ""I was humiliated! I never wanted to get hurt like that again!""  Moondancer was distraught. Moondancer was hurt.   To quote a certain song:  ""Pain makes you do things you never knew you could do.""          ~Balloons, MandoPony  And, again, this has happened to people before. It's not far-fetched for Moondancer to not ask again.  Will update when I have more. This is a really great way to vent. :p"
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,TheKnackerman,9,Tue Jul 21 09:15:01 2015 UTC,"""Feeling Pinkie Keen has a bad moral."" That's just not the case at all! It's not saying you should accept things on blind faith, it's saying that when you're presented with evidence you don't understand, can't explain, and that doesn't fit your pre-established beliefs, you shouldn't disregard it because your assumptions say it's impossible, you should look at what's in front of your face, acknowledge it, and move on from there.

I think the problem with the episode is that the episode itself said all that, but the letter essentially said, ""sometimes you have to take things on faith"". I can see them trying to make the same statement, but I think it was poorly worded. A tiny tweak to the final letter (Or even just leaving it off) would have made it work better."

mylittlepony,3e0xbb,adad64,5,Tue Jul 21 03:55:33 2015 UTC,It was a good episode until the resolution.  There's no better way of telling the real Pinkie apart other than watching paint dry?

I LOVE season 1 episodes 1 and 2, and to this day I don't understand why people think they're weak episodes, or more traditionally girly, or whatever.   Slightly rushed? Perhaps. They had to introduce the entire main cast, set the backstory, and have them all find and use their Elements in less than an hour. But mediocre/bad episodes? I don't get it."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,MrOverAnalyzer,5,Tue Jul 21 14:18:14 2015 UTC,"When people jump on the band wagon that Boast Busters is a bad episode, especially when I watch some ""reviews"" of it online (even though the majority of the Analysis Community in MLP shouldn't be taken very seriously anyways).   I also don't like when people say someone is ""out if character"" when I have yet to see a single instance where that's been the case, unless it was intentional."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Protosega,3,Tue Jul 21 05:25:40 2015 UTC,"There are three arguments analysts use for disliking Boast Busters:   Snips & Snails are annoying. Thankfully, their next appearances tone down their stupidity. I personally don't care about this one. Idiots drive a plot? Whatever. Twilight and Spike's exchanges. Depending on who you are, they are either annoying or funny. AJ, RD and Rarity disliking Trixie. I have to agree on this one. They complain she's boasting, but that's her freaking job, she's a show performer! (If Trixie WASN'T on a stage, this problem likely wouldn't exist)"
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,MrOverAnalyzer,3,Tue Jul 21 05:42:49 2015 UTC,"Snips and Snails are indeed annoying. They are the dimwitted assistants of the main antagonist. This troupe has been done before in much similar ways, so it's not really a big deal (minus the ending).  Spike and Twilights exchanges were very minimalistic. Also, Stache Spike is best Spike.  AJ, RD, and Rarity disliking Trixie for her general douchery was justified, in my opinion. As a show performer, Trixie is meant to perform, not talk down to the audience. Albeit, it could have been better if they made Trixie like a heel and just had her badmouthing the audience the whole time, but it got the general message across just fine. There's a person bragging about how they're the best, when they aren't. The ending moral was a bit dumb though, I can admit.    I'm probably just saying this because this episode was the one that got me into the fandom, but I find no glaring faults that utterly ruin the episode at all.   Tl;dr: That's like... You're opinion, man."

It's a deus ex machina, just like literally every other solution in for every two-parter until the season 5 premiere. It's my favorite pair of episodes and I don't understand how so many people see it as the worst next to The Crystal Empire.  I mean come on guys, it has This Day in it."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,MagicOfFriendship,4,Tue Jul 21 06:25:30 2015 UTC,"The Return of Harmony and Princess Twilight's Sparkle's resolutions were thanks to the Elements of the Harmony, something that was established right at the first episode of the show.  Twilight's Kingdom was resolved through Rainbow Power, which was contained in that chest-box-thingy from the Tree of Harmony. This chest-box-thingy was built up by the whole season. I never got the complaints about it being a deus ex machina."
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Rammet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:44:21 2015 UTC,"In Twilight's Kingdom, it may seem to some a little like a safe that took a month to open just happened to contain a hammer, and was opened immediately after a nail monster showed up.  That doesn't really apply, though, since Rainbow Power is kind of just another universal-conflict-absolving-laser/toy line idea."

I think that the solo episodes establish a wonderfully consistent character trait for Spike: he has performance anxiety (i.e. stage fright). He's good at being an assistant in normal life, but whenever the stakes are raised, he gets nervous and messes up. This happens to real people and only adds dimension to his character.  On a related note, I also don't like it when people complain of ""cringe"". Awkward moments are supposed to make you squirm in your seat! It's a good thing!"
mylittlepony,3e0xbb,Dr_Zorand,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:45 2015 UTC,"I agree on Spike episodes: they're generally more interesting because of his anxiety and identity issues, which are consistently there even if they have inconsistent results (but people are inconsistent anyways)  As for cringe: I know what they're trying to do, but I don't actually enjoy the feeling. I'm too sympathetic. Which means I'll enjoy episodes based on that style of humor less. That doesn't make them bad episodes, just ones I don't enjoy."

mylittlepony,3dygdu,notbobby125,41,Tue Jul 21 01:30:37 2015 UTC,My friend just reminded me that this resembles a scene from Family Guy when Quagmire discovers the internet.

mylittlepony,3dygdu,The_Shadowfox,2,Mon Jul 20 19:39:41 2015 UTC,"Not necesarily. My right hand in my mouse hand, and thus browsing hand..."
mylittlepony,3dygdu,Onlyhereforthelaughs,13,Tue Jul 21 06:43:55 2015 UTC,"That was my first thought, and I don't even watch Family Guy...  Seriously, Twilight, stop thinking about Flash so much..."
mylittlepony,3dygdu,cutieMARScrusader,7,Mon Jul 20 19:30:06 2015 UTC,Yeah... It was Flash I was thinking about...
mylittlepony,3dygdu,Onlyhereforthelaughs,13,Mon Jul 20 19:56:03 2015 UTC,Maybe it was Sunset's Skillful Fingers...     What do you mean?     Nuthin'. Inside joke.

mylittlepony,3dygdu,JennylXJ9,-13,Mon Jul 20 22:33:34 2015 UTC,"That Twilight picture you are using does not match what you saying.  Also I don't like family guy. Show isn't funny and what happens doesn't make sense. Sure it's a comedy, but just making ""anything"" happen is just lazy."
mylittlepony,3dygdu,MyMetalPony,23,Mon Jul 20 18:16:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing.
mylittlepony,3dygdu,JennylXJ9,-18,Mon Jul 20 18:19:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for down voting, makes me know I'm right!"
mylittlepony,3dygdu,TheeLinker,11,Mon Jul 20 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"The implication of how Twilight got her arm like that, given how Quagmire got his arm like that in Family Guy, is making Best-Pony go ""OH GOD WHY,"" particularly since he was the one to post this image and hadn't considered that interpretation. Seems a fitting emote to me."
mylittlepony,3dygdu,Tommyspud,16,Mon Jul 20 19:03:57 2015 UTC,YOU NEED TO FLEX HARDER.
mylittlepony,3dygdu,kentucky210,10,Mon Jul 20 19:02:27 2015 UTC,"you know they say all ponies are created equal. But you look at twilight and you look at trixie and you can see that statement is not true. See normally if you go 1 on 1 with a normal pony you got a 50/50 chance of winning! But twi's a genetic freak, and she's not normal. so Trixie has a 25% chance at best at beat her. Then you add Spike to the mix, you the chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way at the gala Trixie got a 33 1/3 chance at winning. But twi has a 66 2/3 chance of winning because spike knows he can't beat her and he's not even gonna try. So Trixi, you take your 33 1/3 chance minus my 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance at winning at the gala. But then you take twi's 75% chance at winning (if you were to go one on one) and then add the 66 2/3%s and twi's got a 141 2/3 % chance of winning at the gala  Senior Trixie, The numbers don't lie and they spell disaster for you at the gala  link of the refrence"

mylittlepony,3dygdu,Coldcoffees,14,Mon Jul 20 18:16:43 2015 UTC,Woah hold on.. Twilight is a human?!
mylittlepony,3dygdu,silverinferno3,14,Mon Jul 20 19:43:18 2015 UTC,"Equestria Girls was a movie starring Twilight and Spike as they go to a human world, where they end up in a high school and meet human versions of the rest of the Mane 6.  If you've heard of Sunset Shimmer, that's where she originated, though she didn't get as popular until the sequel, Rainbow Rocks.  My personal opinion? Worth a watch, especially the second for its awesome music! The third one, Friendship Games is slated for September as well."
mylittlepony,3dygdu,Coldcoffees,8,Mon Jul 20 20:03:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! I may have to give it a watch!
mylittlepony,3dygdu,OldTalesChangeStyle,16,Mon Jul 20 20:06:45 2015 UTC,"To give a bit of context, Equestria Girls is mainly Hasbro's way of competing against the the Monster High series of dolls, made by their rival, Mattel.  As such, it's kind of this weird, corporately-forced vision that follows a lot of typical ""new girl in high school"" clichés. It also (at least in my opinion) suffers from some storytelling issues that I won't go into here.  Despite that, I like to think of it as the best result of a bad situation. It's made by the same people who work on the main series, and as such despite the clearly forced concept, it has a lot of the same charm, humor, and quality you'd come to expect from the series. In short, if you like the TV show, you'll (probably) at least enjoy the movie.  As for its sequel... it's much better, by nearly any standard, but relies on you understanding the plot of the first one, and some of the subtext draws from Season 4, which aired just before it was released."
mylittlepony,3dygdu,silverinferno3,9,Mon Jul 20 22:20:30 2015 UTC,"The first came out after Season 3, and the sequel came out after Season 4. I think you already saw the Season 4 finale, so there shouldn't be any spoilers that you haven't seen already. Have fun!"
mylittlepony,3dygdu,Unknownloner,8,Mon Jul 20 20:08:31 2015 UTC,"most people (myself included) think the first one wasn't that impressive,  but you'll need to watch it to understand the second one,  which I thought was pretty great. just treat it as a spinoff from the show instead of expecting it to be the same and you'll be fine!"
mylittlepony,3dygdu,Onlyhereforthelaughs,6,Mon Jul 20 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, uh...    ...no?     Dang it, OP. You spoiled them."
