homegym,3dzrlo,aaronwhite1786,3,Tue Jul 21 02:42:58 2015 UTC,Its a Bodymax CF470 Half Rack. Its very stable when loading and unloading weights but it has some side to side wobble if you swing on it. I would be happy to answer any other questions you have.

My old space had a wooden floor and low ceilings so i had to be careful when dropping my deadlifts and i had to OHP in the garden, but this is ideal for me."
homegym,3dzrlo,RageLettuceTurbo,2,Tue Jul 21 01:25:44 2015 UTC,What bench is that and how do you like it?
homegym,3dzrlo,bulldog73,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:04:44 2015 UTC,"Its by Bodymax, i have no idea what the model number is, but its pretty stable and easy to adjust. I haven't really had much experience with other benches though."
homegym,3e13t1,Bill_Casbay,2,Tue Jul 21 03:40:25 2015 UTC,"Looking nice.  Which model squat/power rack did you end up with?  Looks familiar but wasn't 100% sure.  Also, which model CAP bar is it?  So you went with the CAP Deluxe Utility Bench?    As far as finding dumbbells, in the past three months I've only seen one really good deal on Ironmaster adjustables (within a 3-4 hour drive of Detroit area) and a few decent deals on PowerBlocks (which I don't like the style of).  I ended up going with standard spinlocks and after 4-5 moving/garage sale finds and selling off the extras I have eight handles and just under 400lbs of CAP 1""/standard plates (mostly 10lbs) for around $75 total.  So that's what I'd recommend looking for.  Might involve some driving."
homegym,3e13t1,linuxrulesusa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:09:32 2015 UTC,Thanks the squat rack is the TP006D with the pulley system.  The bar is - http://www.amazon.com/CAP-Barbell-Olympic-2-Inch-7-Feet/dp/B000RNSDKE/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1437487023&sr=8-5&keywords=olympic+bar  The bench is http://www.amazon.com/CAP-Barbell-Deluxe-Utility-Bench/dp/B00HGCJZEC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1437487048&sr=8-2&keywords=cap+bench  Yes I'm mostly looking for hex or rubber but even on craigslist the rubber goes for 1.50 a pound. I'll just keep my eye out for them.. Eventually ill buy more plates.
homegym,3e13t1,linuxrulesusa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:42 2015 UTC,"How do you like the bar so far?  How long have you been using it?  I've heard mixed reviews - some say it's great, and others say the sleeves get all scratched up or flake off.  I'm debating between that one (OB-86PB) and the OB-86B."
homegym,3e13t1,linuxrulesusa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:34 2015 UTC,I haven't even used it yet. Just finished building last night. I can update you in a few weeks. The reason I bought this bar and not the OB-86B was because the one I have can hold 1500lbs (not that I can lift that much but I like the security). I can see how it could scratch of chip because it's black. But I'll need to put some padding on my hooks to prevent scratching.

homegym,3e13t1,GrizzlyGinger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:21 2015 UTC,Let me know if you have any questions about the pieces.  Squat Rack: from fitness avenue in Canada. I am in the US but for the price even with shipping it cannot be beaten. I searched craigslist for months but could not find one that fit my needs until this one. Especially with the pulley system.  Mats: Tractor supply co.  Weights: Set from dicks sporting goods and came with the cheap bar.  Black Olympic Bar: From CAP on amazon.  Bench: CAP from amazon.  Also my basement is 7 feet. This Power Rack is perfect for 7 foot high basements. This is the only one I could find for this price that would fit my in my basement with a pulley system.  I was planning to build the entire gym from craigslist finds. After months of searching I was finding overpriced items. I decided to go with new items and they have a warranty.  Let me know if you have any questions. Also building this took about 3 hours with a friend.

Cardio is actually the toughest for me. If I travel to a track at the local gym because it is part of my routine, I'm committed.

You won't be able to squat with what you posted. But if that's all you can afford there's nothing wrong with it. The bench in your post looks okay, I can't really tell the manufacturer but it looks decently solid. Plus the bar/weights, $150 isn't a terrible deal. I would try to get him to go lower though"
homegym,3dz8cd,Minatorious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:33 2015 UTC,Duly noted. Maybe I'll expand my search or wait a bit longer then. It's apparently a Weider bench. Does that change anything?
homegym,3dz8cd,Minatorious,3,Mon Jul 20 19:15:29 2015 UTC,Yes that makes it worse. I would avoid anything with the name Weider on it. bodybuilding.com had a section on their forums titled workout equipment. That's where I learned almost everything I know.

One group is basically perfect: uniform thickness, all sheets exactly the same, no texture print on the top. I would be happy to use these as flooring even if my gym was inside my house and not in the garage.   The second group is kind of crappy. Thickness isn't even, there is a pebble texture on top.

homegym,3dfrzf,afrocrobat,3,Wed Jul 15 23:42:53 2015 UTC,"For bench press I just lay on the ground, the chairs act as the weight support. I roll the dumbbell to the edge of the chair, and then just pick it up like you normally would out of a rack and start lifting, when I'm done I just set it back on the edge of the chair and they roll backwards. I would do it on the chair since I prefer incline bench press, but I don't have a rack to hold the weights if I do that.   The program I do is off /r/fitness, the link is here, and it includes a leg day. I recommend this program if you're looking for one, it's well-rounded and matched what I was doing at the gym before pretty closely, just with dumbbells instead. You should also invest in a forearm roller, they're cheap and you can just add it in to one of the days for a good forearm workout."

If you're not dropping it from the top, then the floor will probably be fine if it's not already in disrepair.  A full platform is not needed unless you're dropping it higher up.

homegym,3ddf4a,fatguyinakilt,3,Wed Jul 15 17:28:26 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what floor your putting it on. If it's a garage with a concrete slab, you could get away with horse stall mats, but you really need to put a layer (or two) of plywood underneath the horse stall mat to disperse the impact across the floor. Horse stall mat alone could still chip or crack the concrete given enough force.  If you're indoors on wood/carpet, you'll definitely want a platform. Platforms are also a good idea if you need some sound deadening for any reason."
homegym,3ddf4a,SleepEatLift,4,Wed Jul 15 13:25:09 2015 UTC,If you plan on dropping the bar or slamming the weight down you need a platform.

homegym,3ddf4a,Tofinochris,2,Fri Jul 17 02:47:25 2015 UTC,I'll be doing this on a concrete slab in the unfinished portion of the basement in the house we're building. I will likely do a double-layer of plywood topped with horse stall mats. Bumper plates would be another way of helping to soften the impact.
homegym,3ddf4a,ghormeh_sabzi,2,Wed Jul 15 14:36:45 2015 UTC,"I deadlift close to three plates and just use a double layer of puzzle mats under the plates on each side.  I also bought 2x bumper 45s when I first set up my home gym because, well, I wanted bumpers when I was lifting heavier weight.  Under the puzzle mats is a laminate (fake wood) floor on top of my concrete house foundation and after 7-8 months of doing this there is zero damage there.    If you're just going on top of concrete you should be grand with just the puzzle mats.  If you're not the homeowner let the homeowner (e.g. parents) know what you're doing and see if they want you to take any more precautions, but I'd be shocked if you caused any damage to concrete by dropping any reasonable weight on it.  In my case, my wife doesn't like the laminate floor in the weight room so I knew I could go cheap on the protection and not worry.  Of course since she wanted it to be damaged it took 7 months before I so much as dropped a plate on the floor."

homegym,3db4e9,all_akimbo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:16:33 2015 UTC,IMHO I'd like a more sturdy rack to put the weight on.  The arms where you re-rack might fatigue after some use and weather.   Beautiful site though.
homegym,3ddfsp,cookiemonster4321,2,Wed Jul 15 12:09:30 2015 UTC,I think you will be fine as long as you also wipe down your bike regularly.

homegym,3d9btu,HWLesq,9,Tue Jul 14 14:47:30 2015 UTC,"The gym is never truly done, but here are some of the latest additions since I posted my Titan HD review.   I actually stained the center oak plywood on the lifting platform with linseed oil. It gives it a nice finished color and isn't too slippery or too grippy.   I replaced the Fitness Gear Adjustable Bench with a Rogue 2.0 flat bench. The wider pad helps me feel much more stable during bench press. I'm not really missing out on incline bench as they weren't ever a major exercise in any of my programming anyways.   I got 160lbs of Rogue Echo bumpers and built a DIY bumper weight storage box. Also built a plyo box with 20""/24""/30"" heights for the wife.  The bumpers are very nice for the wife to learn deadlifts at the correct height with low weights and without a deficit.   I also put up a cheap dry erase board which will be used to mark PRs/goals/exercises. Not pictured is the most practical item I bought, a 20"" metal floor fan for moving that Florida swamp heat. I returned a plastic box fan I originally bought within a week. The much more powerful and loud metal fan is worth it.   I also added wooden Olympic rings which give me an option to do ring dips, muscle ups, etc. They were cheap enough I decided to buy them instead of looking for my old plastic rings.   Also pictured are cheap lockjaw knockoffs which work very well. Lifting straps I never use, an ab wheel which is nice to in rotation with hanging leg raises and dragon flags, a yoga mat, the dip attachments for the HD, a cheapo weight belt, cheapo foam roller I should use, and the chalk bucket.   I still want to acquire a women's bar, a spud pulley system or a diy version, a diy landmine, some dumbbells, a GHD, and some form of cardio (jump rope, airdyne, or C2).  Happy lifting homegym master race."
homegym,3d9btu,MrNiceGaius,2,Tue Jul 14 15:07:02 2015 UTC,Looking good! Do you work out solo or get a group in there?
homegym,3d9btu,fryedegg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:53:59 2015 UTC,Thanks! It's a solo gym. I've been encouraging my wife to lift so she joins when she can. I have invited friends over but we currently live pretty far from Tampa proper so it wouldn't make sense for them to drive so far to workout.
homegym,3d9btu,SleepEatLift,2,Tue Jul 14 16:12:36 2015 UTC,Looks great dude!   No amounts of fans beat the Florida heat  but your muscles always stay loose!

homegym,3d9btu,whatisthewhat,3,Tue Jul 14 16:29:53 2015 UTC,About a month. The black on the sleeves are starting to fade a bit due to the terrible fit of the cheap 45s.  The black between the sleeves are still new except for some chalk in the knurling.
homegym,3d9btu,mctttt,2,Tue Jul 14 17:00:09 2015 UTC,"I've seen pics where the finish on the knurling fades just from cleans/snatches. But yeah, the color on the sleeves always fade even with bumpers. Would you let us know if any part of the finish on the shaft fades/rubs off? Example"
homegym,3d9btu,greenalleycat,2,Tue Jul 14 19:26:14 2015 UTC,Interesting. I only had it for about a month so mine looks nothing like the picture you linked. I also don't really go inside the knurling except for some close grip bench and the rare sumo deadlift I might crank out one in a blue moon.   I'll definitely update in a few months if the bar starts becoming noticeably faded.

homegym,3d9btu,jrhu92,2,Wed Jul 15 16:36:51 2015 UTC,Hey looking to build a similar lifting platform and bumper plate holder for my gym. Could I get the plans you use for the platform and measurements of the plate holder.  Thanks. Looking great!
homegym,3d9btu,internet_DOOD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:22:37 2015 UTC,"Here's a link to the platform build.   http://imgur.com/a/GNMiq  As for measurements, it's pretty simple. 4 pieces of cheaper 1/2"" or 3/4"" thick plywood (4'x8') for the first two layers. A 3/4"" thick nicer piece of plywood on top for the lifting surface (also 4'x8') with a piece of 2'x8' horse stall mat on each side. I had to get two stall mats since they didn't have 4'x8' pieces, but you can just get additional 3/4"" plywood instead of an additional mat.   As for the bumper storage, you should take your own measurements as bumpers vary in thickness amongst manufacturers, but it's made from pieces of 2""x4""s. I have seen others make them with 2""x6""s as well."

homegym,3d8xw6,Ark18,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:00:17 2015 UTC,Actually the bag itself is quite heavy so it can take upto 5-6 punches before you need to stop it from swinging away.
homegym,3d8oyu,TheDarkLordisAlive,9,Tue Jul 14 11:08:19 2015 UTC,Do a set.  Switch the laundry.  Do a set.   Wash some dishes.  Do a set.  Wash more dishes.  So many daily things I can do between sets in the 2-5 minutes of rest.   Also my son can crawl around while lift.
homegym,3d8oyu,mxx321,8,Tue Jul 14 14:10:52 2015 UTC,"For me it's no easier to work out, but I do work out more.  My local gym has always been a 5 minute drive away, so having a gym in my garage hasn't save me that much time. However, I do notice that I have to keep myself more diligent; when the gym is always 20 feet away, its always something you can do 20 minutes later. To curb this attitude, I crafted a huge calendar and placed it on the wall behind my laptop. It's 6 feet wide, and shows when the last time I worked out was. Keeps me honest.   Overall I love having a home gym. It's a great conversation piece, more convenient, and I get to blast my music as loud as I want...  Or watch Netflix."
homegym,3d8oyu,10Bens,3,Tue Jul 14 15:03:57 2015 UTC,More outside training. Fun in the sun.
homegym,3d8oyu,SleepEatLift,3,Tue Jul 14 16:26:43 2015 UTC,a friend of mine recently moved to silicon valley and set up his power rack outside on the deck. I am intensely jealous.
homegym,3d8oyu,baldmullet,3,Tue Jul 14 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"I work out more. I get a better workout because I can plan out and do exactly what I want without waiting for equipment.  I workout in shorts with no shirt or boxers and chuck taylors with no socks so my gym laundry is very minimal compared to before which saves time and money because you don't get caught up in needing to look good in the gym.   No money spent on gas to commute. Most importantly though is time. By the time I get gym gear, drive to the gym, put my gear in a locker and get to working out I'd already wasted a half hour. Having a gun in the garage I can put rice in the rice cooker and some dinner in the oven then head down to the gym and have a hot dinner ready when I finish.   Everything about having a homegym is awesome. If you have the space and money, do it!  It is also easier on lazy days when you don't want to work out to just tough it out and go do a few sets so it doesn't feel like a ""zero day"" with no progress. More often than not a few sets turns into a pretty good workout and the B.S. of the day melts away.  P.S. avoid equipment that can breakdown or need repair. Build the core of your gym around a rack, bench, barbell and other heavy things you pick up and put down so it truly is a lifetime investment."
homegym,3d8oyu,batman1285,2,Tue Jul 14 19:51:11 2015 UTC,"No, I worked out the same amount when I had  a gym membership.  However, I find my workout takes far less time.    It cuts out at least 15-20 minutes from each workout.   No commute, no waiting for weights, etc.      Before I'd schmuck around and do about 70 minutes per session at a gym, now its about 50 minutes at home."
homegym,3d8oyu,allan416519,2,Tue Jul 14 11:31:36 2015 UTC,"It's the best. I now work out after work instead of before. I'm a morning person but prefer to keep my office hours very early so I can get more done before others come in.  I don't feel bad taking 3-5 minutes between sets if needed. I work out for longer, go harder. My own music and my own shower.  It's easier to go there, my time there is better spent and I don't think I go more frequently but my sessions are definitely longer and harder."
homegym,3d8oyu,baldmullet,2,Tue Jul 14 12:55:26 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering what the effect will be as well.  I'm a competitive powerlifter and have only ever trained at a gym.  I actually train at a public gym, but I really like the atmosphere of being at a gym - from lifting with friends I've made, or yea, lifting heavier for ""that girl over there"".   I think having people around kinda drives you do push a little harder.  I've just built my rack at home, but haven't got anything else yet.  My gym is closing for 2 months, and we are having our second child soon and that's why I've decided to go the home gym route.  I just wonder how finding the motivation to lift will be.  What I do think might hopefully happen is that I stick to my programs better and stop lifting heavier than Im supposed to - and I'll also do more accessory lifts that I should be doing because it'll be lighter weights that I didnt like ""wasting my time on"" in the gym.  I should also be able to workout whenever I want and how many days a week I want."

homegym,3d8oyu,TonyMontana214,2,Tue Jul 14 17:41:24 2015 UTC,"I work out more consistently than compared to a regular gym... mainly with respect to point a) below.  It is easier for me to workout, because a) the public gym I went to only had two power racks with inevitable waiting during the lunch hour... not having to wait for a power rack - PRICELESS, b) convenience: weekday/weekend or morning/noon/night makes no difference - the gym awaits c) play my own music, dim the lights, take my shirt off, not feel rushed... MY PERSONAL TIME with no interference.  I definitely recommend setting up your own home gym if you are so inclined.  For me, I would say there are two reasons for skipping or delaying a training session: a) other activities such as playing hockey, spin class or group cycling b) (mis-) timing meals or being plain busy with other stuff.  An advantage is if you miss a day for any reason (life happens), you can make it up the next without regard for driving to the gym/weekend/etc.  ""Lift heavy, drop weights, use chalk, grunt, scream, vomit, swear, and bleed."""
homegym,3d8oyu,azureskater,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:37:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah mainly because my school gym had strict hours and days so i couldnt train for more than an hour and a half, now i train for sometimes 3 and a half hours with friends but we have fun too so its longer. Its much easier for me, only problem is temperature, even in england i end up sweating a lot without windows open and a fan. Its also much better to not have to take equipment like belts, straps and chalk around with you so yeah its much easier."
homegym,3d8oyu,fuckyoucamy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:26:37 2015 UTC,"My workouts are shorter, due to not waiting for/sharing the squat rack/platform/bench. And not talking.

homegym,3d54sy,SleepEatLift,3,Mon Jul 13 19:08:27 2015 UTC,He can and should. I have powerblocks and would never get rid of my rack and keep the dumbbells. You can accomplish far more with a rack and barbell.

homegym,3d54sy,kobenator,3,Mon Jul 13 16:56:29 2015 UTC,"i strongly recommend against a shit bar and that bench.  just looking at rogue fitness you can pick off an s2 squat stand with pull up bar  and a rogue 2.0 bar for reasonable price. for me shipped to ca was 811. factoring in your horse stall mats, conservatively, gives you $300 for plates and bench on craigslist. very doable.  if you shop around the other fitness sites you may be able to get a better deal. especially if you tell them you are shopping around one might give you free shipping or 10% off. i picked rogue because they generally arent the cheapest so it serves my point that you dont have to go with a pos bench and bar.  over time id add safety spotter arms for $135. and possibly upgrade bench and plates depending on what you get."
homegym,3d54sy,kobenator,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:26:49 2015 UTC,I understand the Marcys isn't best quality but we won't need to use it much except for bench press when we don't want to use Dumbbells.  I may add just a rogue bench in a couple months.

homegym,3cymgg,Orcasmic,11,Sat Jul 11 23:33:10 2015 UTC,I would personally avoid bowflex. Usually overpriced and low quality.  Yes you can get adjustable dumbells to replace an actual set. Look at powerblocks or ironmasters. Stay away from bowflex or universal
homegym,3cymgg,Minatorious,3,Sun Jul 12 00:11:18 2015 UTC,"I use adjustable bowflex. Not a huge fan. They work for some stuff but get bulky, can snag on the changing platform, and have a hard weight limit. I cannot do one arm bench rows with them as they're not nearly heavy enough. I use a dumbbell bar with Olympic sleeve/collar for that and my rack plates. Up to 25s work okay. Anything larger gets unweildly and limits RoM."
homegym,3cymgg,Kaell311,3,Sun Jul 12 01:34:24 2015 UTC,"I bought a squat rack/bench combo (golds gym brand) from Wal-Mart plus an Olympic bar and some plates for $400 new. Only complaint is the safety bars are really short so I have to squat really close to the rack.  Go for a cage if u can. Adjustable dbs are going to be much cheaper than set weight dbs, you pretty much pay $1/lb on plates as well as dumbbells, so picking up some extra 5s and 10s for your dbs will be much cheaper.   Edit: don't forget to buy your plates for dbs in sets of 4, not 2 like for bbs"

Then do your shoulder raises with plates instead of dumbells.   A few resistance bands and kettlebells are great accessories to add in over time also."

Then buy some cheaper cast iron plates to get you setup. That way you can oly lift safely on the cheap.  Dumbells, go as cheap as you can. These are always on craigslist or garage sales. I've got a mix and match set with 10s, 15s, 25s, and 60s and it probably cost less than $40. Im still looking for some 50s, 70s and 80s but im not gonna fork over a couple hundred bucks for it.

homegym,3cymgg,kobenator,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:58:25 2015 UTC,To be honest the only advantage I see to a power rack is that it can go anywhere. With a half rack you are limited to putting it against a wall be pretty much all home gyms are already putting the rack against a wall.
homegym,3cymgg,Angry_Apollo,2,Mon Jul 13 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"personally my final solution will use a squat rack. while it will be inside against a wall most of the time, i like how the are more mobile and i can pull it out of my garage to do some lifting in the sun.  power racks you can move but generally they are extremely awkward to move alone.  edit: and power racks take up more space. not that you can have things any closer to a squat rack or half rack, but they make the room feel more open then teh cage of a power rack. thats important to me when im not using it."

homegym,3cymgg,ivanpei,2,Sun Jul 12 11:55:38 2015 UTC,"Make sure you squat rack has safeties to catch a missed squat or a missed bench ( i.e .plenty of increments for the supports, 1 inch apart is good). I would recommend a powercage. Platform is good so you don't ruin the floor or make too much noise.  Skip the bowflex. Adjustable dumbells are good but if you have an Olympic bar, which I recommend over standard, you need 2 sets of plates. Dumbells that take olympic plates aren't great as the weight can slide of because the sleeves aren't threaded for screw collars."
homegym,3cymgg,broscientologist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:20:01 2015 UTC,"i have the bowflex 1090s. they are solid. i went with them over powerblocks because the powerblocks have a cage around your hand so are harder to drop.  that being said id go with whatever and not worry about going really heavy. when i got mine it was my only weights. but now i have a barbell and ez curl bar. i really only like dumbbells for shoulder and bicep work and those muscles respond way better to volume so im hardly ever over 30 lbs.  incline db press is really the only reason to have heavy dbs, but my shoulders just dont like incline pressing heavy. and since i learned about landmine press i just never see myself doing incline again.  edit: but to answer your question, to start you want to get a squat rack with safety arms (for benching alone) also with a pull up bar preferably, barbell, plates, and a flat bench. adjustable bench would be nice but not essential to start. ez curl bar and dbs should be added over time."

My place doesnt have space for a power rack so it's a compromise. If you have the space, the power rack is the way to go. Powerblocks are retardedly expensive where I'm from (Malaysia) They are 1k USD and above. I got my Bowflex 552s for about 280 USD and am getting the 1090s for about 350 USD.   I have not dropped by Bowflexes but I have trained my bench press to failure and partially dropped them/assisted drop from bench height. They were fine. They are not as flimsy as people claim if you take care of them. However if Powerblocks are about the same price as Bowflex in your area, just buy the Powerblocks for peace of mind.  Your legs and back will outgrow the dumbbells very fast. I got a pullup bar for my back (dirt cheap) and am doing single leg bulgarian split squats for my legs.

Here's what I'm thinking:  (1) Build up everything but the top two parallel pipes and their associated joints  (2) pour a crap load of sand so that it fills up through the vertical pipes, might need to experiment with either half way up or all the way up the verticals -- the lower center of gravity may help more than the added mass)  (3) continue building the remainder of the setup (the last 4 joints and 2 pipes)  If you cement the joints so that they're solid, and the added weight of sand inside should stabilize it a good deal.  Also, if you (or anyone) try this, please report back!"

Would also be a space saver for commercial gyms, as people won't have to pull the bench into the power rack. They could just replace their normal benches with these. I know you can also ask for a spot, but sometimes that becomes a pain (e.g. asking for a spot five times in a row doing 5x5, going when the gym's nearly empty).

(On the other hand, he's probably not going to be able to find the pedal when he needs it, and might die anyway)  3) Some weird perfectionist that absolutely insists on going max depth without a spotter and won't arch their back can get an extra 1/4"" ROM at the bottom, I suppose"
homegym,3cuful,vohk,7,Sat Jul 11 13:37:39 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical. The problem I see is that you have to kick the lever in the process of failing the rep. Even assuming that it's easy to reach no matter your personal biomechanics (height, length of limbs, flexibility, etc), easy things become hard in a crisis. People panic. And that's assuming a slow failure, with time to react. This does nothing if you outright drop the bar.  We're talking about an emergency failsafe here. There's a reason killswitches don't typically rely on human input.  This would be nice to have (lawsuit bait aside) but I'm not seeing a great deal of advantage over setting the safety bars on a rack to say, below chest level but above neck level. Definitely not $800 USD worth."

But I consistently lift at 80-85% 1rm for bench so I can mostly lift doubles or triples without a rack or spotter anyway because I'm in complete control if the bar still at that weight
homegym,3cuful,IronGoht,2,Sun Jul 12 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"I always roll the bar towards my neck onto the safeties and slide underneath if I fail a rep.  My chest no matter what is always going to be higher than my neck, arch or not.  First time doing this yeah it's a bit scary but no worries after that time."
homegym,3cuful,scurvy_tail,5,Sat Jul 11 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"I ran across this because a buddy posted it on facebook, but its a pretty sweet design.  Definitely pricey for a bench, though"

homegym,3cuful,egobroniacal,2,Sat Jul 11 02:51:16 2015 UTC,"I just don't see the point. While this may appear to be a better solution than others, it is, unsurprisingly, a more expensive solution. And further analysis of said solution does lead one to question whether it is indeed better, as it first appeared. What are the chances of accidentally flipping the lever while you're mid-bench, and causing your whole balance to be distorted, possibly leading to muscular injuries? There are simpler solutions, namely, benching in a rack with safeties. Yeah, that's not as flash as this, but it works."

I don't practice shitty reps which is what this gimmick allows you to do. I always leave one or two in the tank.  Plus it still won't save you if you get injured during a rep and the weight free falls.

I didn't have the time/patience for CL, so I bought the rack and 300lb bar/weights from Dicks.  I build a platform to put in on and use it all the time. For my use, it feels really sturdy and I have complete confidence in it's safety. I'm only squatting 250x5 at the moment, so maybe I'd feel different if I were a monster powerlifter. But I don't see myself outgrowing the rack for a long time, if ever.  (The Dick's bar is a different story.  Fine for now, but I know it won't hold up as my weights increase)  Assembly wasn't too bad, did it by myself though a second person would have made it easier. I like the way the safeties adjust, like the pull-up bars. As others have said, probably not great for people lifting huge amounts, but I've never regretted my purchase at all.

Log -  There's an inherent level of badassness in picking up a log from the ground to overhead. You'll grow some serious wings on your back and hair on your ballsack.  Stones - Only one is really needed, 200 is perfect for all needs. Nothing is more badass than waking into my gym and lifting a stone. And if you lift with wife/girlfriend....be prepared for some hardcore sex directly after.  My gf sees me deadlift 600 and she's just 'blah blah, yeah that's good.' But she sees me lift a stone and wants to rip my clothes off.  Farmers handles - shrugs don't do shit. Carrying 200+ in each hand for distance builds monster traps. 2 inch rope - not many really understand how versatile this is. Attach to sled for arm over arm rows. Attach to harness for truck pulling.  Throw it in a tree for climbing. Battle ropes, etc.  500-600 pound tire. Tire flipping will leave you sore and bruised.  And feeling like a jacked monster.

homegym,3cnjh4,acewolk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:35:29 2015 UTC,"Squat or power rack, with safeties and pull-up bar, and properly secured (bolted or weighted down). Olympic bar. A good quality bushing bar is preferable to a cheap bearing bar. Gym rings. Wood. Seriously, pay the extra and skip the plastic. Chalk. Your hands will thank me. No more losing reps to sweaty palms and much less tearing of the flesh. The kind you want is Magnesium Carbonate, usually sold as Climbing or Gym Chalk. More expensive brands tend to include additional drying agents; they may be useful for climbers but from gym use the regular stuff is just fine. Board/sidewalk chalk is not. Cardio machine of choice, because some days it's just too goddamn hot/cold/wet outside to jog or bike. Foam roller/ball. Lovely for loosening up, before or after a workout.   And... that's it. That is everything you need to get a comprehensive workout. As for the 'nice to have' and 'fun' categories:   Yoga/ground/rubber mats. Nice if you're working on concrete or a low traction surface, especially in the winter. Platform and bumper plates. If you're not doing Olympic lifts you don't need either. If you are, you still don't need either but they're nice to have. A simple platform can be a good way to secure a power rack, especially if bolting into the floor isn't an option. Bench. Only necessary for the bench press which, while fun, is about the most overrated exercise around. Flat or adjustable is down to preference, but note that cheaper adjustables tend to lack stability for heavy pressing. Free weights. Kettlebells, dumbbells, medicine balls, etc. Nice to have but very expensive to collect a full set. Easy to outgrow a small set. Smaller weights can easily be replace by milk jugs and other improvised weights. A barbell or bodyweight work can be substituted for heavier ones. As seen on TV! anything: No. Just no."

If you're looking for new gear and want to just order it and be done, check out one of our home gym packages:  http://www.repfitness.com/equipment-packages/garage-gym-packages/5x5-starter-gym  I'd just consider adding some weight since it will save you some shipping cost to get it now as part of the package.

Well that's the thing, I don't have the ability to save for it that way   Bullshit. If you can pay off a loan at 150-200 a month, you can save the money instead and not pay someone interest for indulging your impatience. If you're not already putting away a decent piece of the disposable part of your paycheck for things like this (in addition to long term savings), fucking start now. Avoiding the trap of casual financing will save you so much money and grief over the years. You do not want to be that guy living paycheck to paycheck.  Look at it this way: saving $200/month and being smart with your money, you'll have the bank to build yourself damn near any gym you want in under a year ($200x12=$2400). If you go with brands like RepFitness or Titan- or find some stuff used/clearance- instead of more 'premium' ones like Rogue you should be able to get it done in under 6 months. If you're not doing heavy Olympic lifts, go with iron plates instead of bumpers to save a big chunk of change.  Spend those months (less if you have some disposable savings or your folks are willing to spot you part of it at a low/no family interest rate) working on your cardio and doing /r/bodyweightfitness, and not only will the time pass easily but you'll be that much more balanced an athlete for it. Get the bar and weights first and hack together a solid squat rack out of wood to make the time go even faster."

homegym,3ccx6r,Forever_Feel_Autumn,7,Mon Jul 6 22:56:15 2015 UTC,"I bought a similar set from Sports Authority.  It  is ""good enough"" for you to get started and progress, plus to figure out what you like.    There is no point in buying a super expensive bar that you won't like.  I ended up purchasing two sets of the #300 sets and they have held up pretty well (outside on my back porch).  There is some rusting and they aren't super smooth rolling olympic bars, but they get the job done without costing you an arm and a leg.  See if you can get a look at a couple of the sets they have on hand and choose the one that has the most uniform knurling and spins the smoothest."
homegym,3ccx6r,Grifts,4,Mon Jul 6 23:06:02 2015 UTC,I've got that set and it does the job. Only thing I dislike are the plates are not super smooth so they might scratch you up a little and the bar is heavily grooved so it makes this wonderfully loud ziiiip noise when you take plates off. But its heavy and I can lift it so it does what I paid for.
homegym,3ccx6r,Draeth,2,Tue Jul 7 00:19:17 2015 UTC,I also have that set.  That zipping sound is the only think I dislike about it.

homegym,3ccx6r,CharlesDonousI,5,Mon Jul 13 23:09:41 2015 UTC,"If you want a better bar, you can get the CAP Model# OB-86B for $125. I ordered mine from Walmart and I'm waiting for it. It has gotten stellar reviews, so I'm hopeful.   At my local Play-it-Again Sports one can buy weights for $0.64/lb which would be $192 for 300 lb. That would be roughly the same price as the Dick's deal, but you would get a much better bar (or so it seems)."
homegym,3ccx6r,h3r057r47u5,2,Tue Jul 7 00:44:28 2015 UTC,"I recently bought this exact set, and my plan is to buy the CAP #OB-86B, that /u/h3r057r47u5 mentioned, when I need to upgrade (if you eat enough, you might need to upgrade sooner than you think, FYI). The bar itself seems to be the main issue, but getting brand new plates for less than $1/lb was a steal for me. I'm sure I could get cheaper on CL or Play It Again, but having matching plates appealed to me. So when I want to add more 45s, I can get identical plates for relatively cheap.  When doing my research, I learned (haven't confirmed) that the plates from Dick's have a smaller outer diameter than standard plates. I don't think this will be a huge issue since I plan on buying nothing other than plates from Dick's, but just a heads up.   This week I'm actually building my home gym, so my only side note would be to consider the Titan HD. I got mine through an eBay auction for $340, and I feel this rack can last me for a long time. I'm 6'4, so a taller rack sounded nice, specifically for chin-ups/pull-ups.   I also have the Rogue 2.0 Flat Bench, as well as a platform that uses a couple of horse stall mats. Once I put my rack together I'll post my gym. Let us know how your home gym turns out!"

homegym,3ccx6r,thirdmanin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:22:51 2015 UTC,That's the set I started with a few years ago. I put some noticeable bend in the bar deadlifting 4 plates but otherwise it treated me well. I upgraded to a texas power bar when I noticed the bend and have since put a pile more plate weight in the gym from Craigslist.  The knurling on the bar is shit so I definitely recommend picking up some chalk and a five gallon bucket to keep it in.
homegym,3ccx6r,Angus_Macgillicutty,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:26:40 2015 UTC,I had this weight set for about 2 years before I sold it to a friend and got some nice bumper plates.  Weights will hold their value pretty well if you keep them from rusting.  Eventually you'll want a nicer bar but the one that comes with the set works fine starting out.
homegym,3ccx6r,luften,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:08:01 2015 UTC,"Only had it for a month, but it works fine. The plates don't slide on smooth, but everything lifting related it's functional. I would buy it again."
homegym,3ccx6r,AT_thruhiker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:39:56 2015 UTC,The plates are smaller than regular Olympic size plates. So if you're dead lifting you'll be going a bit lower then you are use too.  edit: Picture for reference: http://i.imgur.com/05G4seb.jpg

homegym,3camu4,egobroniacal,3,Mon Jul 6 15:36:53 2015 UTC,great start to a craigslist gym dude.  now find yourself a huge mirror on CL to admire your gains.  here's what I've got: http://imgur.com/a/nFPpK  recently added a trap bar that is not in these photos.  I also have a huge tire out in my yard.

homegym,3camu4,garagelift,2,Mon Jul 6 17:02:29 2015 UTC,yeah man I had to mute that yellow paint down with a equal amount of white paint too.  I used to have it in my kitchen and I kept going in there to turn off the lights when they weren't even on.

homegym,3cdk13,ALoudMouthBaby,3,Tue Jul 7 02:01:17 2015 UTC,"I loved my W-4.  Easy two person install (after renting a hammer drill and an impact gun).  I've had about 400 pounds on the J-cups and didn't notice any problems.  I've had 3 friends all doing pull-ups at the same time on it and it was rock solid.  The only reason I had to get rid of it is because we moved to a smaller house and I lost my 3rd stall in my garage. But, if you are interested in space saving, why not just do a squat stand like the Monster Lite one and a pull up bar separately?"
homegym,3cdk13,riddick_one,2,Wed Jul 8 17:32:17 2015 UTC,"Any reason you're going with the W-4 instead of the insanely popular R-3? Just curious what your criteria are, to hopefully help you more.   Regarding the 2.0, it's a great bench. I recently bought one, and I have no complaints. It's not adjustable, but you simply can't find an adjustable bench for $200 that's of the same quality. Although to be fair, I'm running SL 5x5, so I have no need for an adjustable bench. When I do, I'll probably get the Fitness Gear Adjustable Bench for about $200, which is still cheaper than dropping $600 on a high-quality adjustable bench."
homegym,3cdk13,DaHolla,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:49:02 2015 UTC,"Space is a primary reason I am interested in the W-4. The difference in price, even though it isn't huge is also a secondary concern. I want a quality home gym that will last a long time, but I do still have a budget.  The R-3 is really tempting though."
homegym,3cdk13,DaHolla,2,Tue Jul 7 14:09:31 2015 UTC,Titan HD - This is basically a knockoff of the R-3 for half the price (I scored mine on eBay for $340).   The W-4 appears to actually take up more space than the R-3/Titan HD.

homegym,3cb0eo,A-Ron,4,Mon Jul 6 14:35:26 2015 UTC,"Squat stands generally don't offer up that much savings in terms of space since the uprights are mounted in the center of the braces on the bottom.  It may just feel like it's taking up less space.  I have a half rack with weight storage and the only downside for me is that I can't use the pull up bar if I'm doing anything else in the rack.  Also, beware of those two racks you mentioned, the spotter arms are very short (14""), I'd say 24"" is what you want for safety reasons."
homegym,3cb0eo,thirdmanin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:53:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Yea, that's one thing that's kinda holding me back on pulling the trigger - The short safety arms.  I'm in Canada, so we don't have too many options available.  I was hoping to spend around $400....   Rogue would be nice, but damn their stuff is expensive.  Though I've found this to be another ""You Get What You Pay For"" scenario.  Also..do you basically have your flooring setup so that the back of he rack is just on anti-fatigue interlocking mats, and where you'd stand for squats is on a stall mat ?"
homegym,3cb0eo,twisted_spaghetti,3,Mon Jul 6 17:00:56 2015 UTC,"So, I went through a long and tedious evaluation of squat stands vs. full power racks, Rogue vs, the others.  Did that for a couple of months.  Ended up getting the Rogue SML-2 Squat Rack which can be converted to a full power rack.  The spotters on the SML-2 are 24"", the thing is gym quality and likely more than I actually needed.  Saying that, I believe it's the best thing I have done for my home gym.  As far as pricing, Rogue is really middle of the pack - you can spend a bunch more or a bunch less.  The Titan stuff looked pretty good and probably makes for a good home set up and many have favorably compared it to a Rogue stand.  I looked long and hard at the Titan stuff, but ultimately chose Rogue as the overall price difference isn't that great, but the difference in build is (IMHO).  For floors (I'm set up in my garage) I use two layers of 3/4"" plywood under one layer of 3/4"" horse stall mats.  My stand is setup with the very back portion over plywood.  I stand on the rubber mats for all my lifts.  Looks funny, but it works for me. You do get what you pay for in this world.  Buy the best you can and don't look back.  I'm a happy camper with what I bought."

I sold that and then got that cheap, full cage with pulldown for 330. It's definitely better than the half rack and a lot more versatile.  But to be honest, I went cheap because I really only use it to bench and do chin ups. I'm into strongman, so I'm always on the log, stones, etc and not really in the rack that much.

homegym,3c612i,thegingakid,5,Sun Jul 5 04:01:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on what kind of exercise program you want to do. Most popular right now are linear progression powerlifting programs like starting strength or strong lifts 5x5. If you think you would like that, check out the FAQ on the sidebar. I suggest trying out some programs at a gym first before investing in a home gym. That will help you figure out what you need. Most popular opinion seems to suggest that you should NOT get a Bowflex. I've never had one but I can see them being not very versatile and poor quality plastic crap. More hype than substance. But ymmv."
homegym,3c612i,damessiahcometh,2,Sun Jul 5 04:07:53 2015 UTC,Ya I have been lifting for a while now. Did power lifting/strength training in high school and been in the military for 4.5 years now so I know my way around a gym and equipment. Never had a bowflex yet you look at getting a rouge anything and I have to cut off one of my fingers. I love strength training (that's pretty much the only way I can keep my weight down without doing cardio 2+ hours a day and have the marathoner look) and my wife does as well. I don't want to have to max a credit card out for a brand name when a less expensive one can do the same job.
homegym,3c612i,damessiahcometh,6,Sun Jul 5 04:24:52 2015 UTC,"Well, the rogue copy that everyone is gaga over right now is the titan HD power rack, which you can get directly from them for $399 shipped. You can bid and win an auction for the same power rack - new and sold directly by titan - on eBay for around $350. If that's too much, I was able to get the titan HD squat rack with safeties for $248 shipped by bidding for it on eBay. Won the rack for $179 and then bought the 7 gauge safeties separately for $69 (it's cheaper to buy the safeties from eBay than directly from titan!). The titan squat rack is a copy of the rogue S2, btw!      Then I bought a used 300 lb olympic weight set off my friend for $100. So that's a pretty good basic setup for just $348 total. Throw in a good quality used flat bench from craigslist for $100 bucks, and you got pretty much everything you need. I also ended up buying some used powerblocks elite with stand off craigslist for $160. That's a pretty versatile and complete beginner gym for around $600. Not bad.      ALSO, the awesome thing is, because I got things for so cheap, when I end up wanting to sell these things, there's a good chance that I will make most of my money back. It's definitely doable without breaking the bank. You just have to be creative and patient.   Let me know if you have more questions! Good luck!"

This will give you a huge variety of exercises and is also very safe which is important when lifting alone at home (the safeties can catch missed bench and missed squats). You can always use it regardless of how strong you get.  I've never tried a bowflex but it looks like trash.

No, but it will provide a more stable surface for your feet."

homegym,3c1vju,plugchop,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:46:52 2015 UTC,"Well, you're right that the carpet is the unstable element.  However, the mats will still move a little bit and the plywood WILL eliminate that.  Putting a layer of plywood either on top of the carpet or on top of the rubber will make a pretty decent difference, especially if the carpet is relatively thick, which in apartments, it is.  The rubber, even at 3/4"" thick, will dip where you step and create a less stable surface."

I ended up getting a piece of 42""x24""x0.75"" plywood that I could put on mats to stand on when it was time to squat or do heavy deadlifts.

homegym,3c0f3l,ghormeh_sabzi,2,Fri Jul 3 19:56:14 2015 UTC,"bench + squat rack is plenty safe provided they are rated within what you need, which can be fairy cheap to come across."
homegym,3c0f3l,russdr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:10:02 2015 UTC,I saw one of those but I wasn't sure if I could use it for bench press. Thank you.
homegym,3c0f3l,WorldProtagonist,-2,Fri Jul 3 19:56:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure of where you do your lifting, but how about just not fastening the plates and dumping them off the sides if you can't lift the load.  But that means you'd probably have to have something down to protect your floors."
homegym,3c0f3l,broscientologist,9,Fri Jul 3 17:21:13 2015 UTC,"I don't recommend this. I had an accidental weight dump while benching in high school. What no one tells you is that only the first plate comes off before the weight of the other side pulls the bar violently. It oscillates back and forth in an uncontrollable, loud, extremely dangerous motion until all the plates have wildly slid off both sides."

homegym,3bzejx,batardo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:32:04 2015 UTC,"Do what ever body else does. Half the posts on this sub are platform builds. Also, don't drop your deadlift."
homegym,3bzejx,plugchop,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:20:22 2015 UTC,"So you think a regular platform with just mats will be sufficient to avoid breaking tile flooring? I'm not planning on dropping DLs, but sometimes on PR attempts this is almost unavoidable from knee height on the way down."
homegym,3bzejx,damessiahcometh,2,Fri Jul 3 13:31:10 2015 UTC,"The most common platform you see on this sub is this one, which uses 5 plywood or OSB boards with rubber horse stall mats along the sides. If you really want a heavier duty platform that utilizes 2x4's and additional padding, you can try to follow or take inspiration from this diy platform guide."
homegym,3bturp,SteeleBigTuna,39,Thu Jul 2 02:40:35 2015 UTC,You win.
homegym,3bturp,SleepEatLift,18,Thu Jul 2 04:08:04 2015 UTC,That gym is better than the 3 commercial gyms in my town.  (Although any gym with a real squat rack is better than the gyms in my town)
homegym,3bturp,filthymacgyver21,17,Thu Jul 2 12:48:20 2015 UTC,"My wife and I decided around the beginning of the year to convert our garage into a home gym. At first we were only going to make one side of the garage a gym but later decided to do the whole garage so we could have all of the equipment that we wanted.     We got sick of the Gold's Gym near our house. Having to wait for equipment is annoying and having to take time out of our day to drive there was inconvenient. We had done P90x and Insanity in our home so we had a few pieces of equipment from that but mainly bought everything this year. I found a couple things on craigslist/KSL but the majority of things I bought new. I wanted my gym to look good and be nice and I didn't want to compromise my ultimate vision very much.      The process started out with switching a single bulb fixture to two 4 bulb fluorescent lights. During the project I learned a little about electrical, sheetrock, taping, painting, and epoxying. It took about 4 months to finish prepping the garage for the equipment. Once I placed my order it came in about 6 weeks.     Equipment:      BFS Full Cage with Landmine attachment, Dip attachment, and Swivel Pullup Grips. BFS Leg Press/Hack Squat Machine BFS Leg Extension/Leg Curl Machine BFS Lat Pulldown/Row Machine BFS Seated Calf Machine BFS D1 Flat to Incline Bench 2 Dumbbell Racks 5-115 Pound Dumbbell Set Cap ob-86b Barbell 15 lb Curl Bar 5' 30 lb Barbell 635 lbs of Olympic weights Body Solid GDCC200 Functional Trainer Rogue Dip Belt Valeo Weight Belt 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, & 20 lb Cap Workout bars"
homegym,3bturp,HPPD2,7,Thu Jul 2 02:40:58 2015 UTC,"awesome, solid choices.  Only thing I would say you need is to upgrade that barbell. ob86b is good on a budget up to a point but with all that other nice gear it deserves a better quality real power bar. at least get a texas power bar or ohio power bar."
homegym,3bturp,fh3131,10,Thu Jul 2 12:40:19 2015 UTC,Jesus...that's not a home gym...that's just a really good gym..home gyms are supposed to have a power rack and a bench...hope you get some great use out of it. All the best
homegym,3bturp,Minatorious,2,Thu Jul 2 13:03:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was trying to make it as professional/commercial like feel as possible. I'm glad that it comes off that way. So far I've been getting great use out of it. One of the best decisions I ever made."
homegym,3bturp,doctordangerdds,5,Thu Jul 2 15:23:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, yeah I love it it's a sleek look."
homegym,3bturp,Frageo,6,Thu Jul 2 03:04:31 2015 UTC,Damn that's some serious dough buying everything at once. Looks great though and love the green
homegym,3bturp,masonmason22,16,Thu Jul 2 03:08:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yeah I had some extra $ and was thinking of buying a motorcycle, boat, or side by side but ultimately decided to do this. I think this will get the most use and be enjoyed by me and my wife so it was money well spent. I tried to make a space that I always wanted to be in and think I succeeded. Every time I walk in I get a grin  on my face."
homegym,3bturp,n01an10,7,Thu Jul 2 03:56:03 2015 UTC,How much did it all cost you?
homegym,3bturp,masonmason22,8,Thu Jul 2 04:08:53 2015 UTC,"About 10k for the equipment with the dumbbells, racks, bars, and all the stuff from Bfs. Probably another 2k for the Sheetrock, paint, epoxy, flooring, and mirrors that also went into it."
homegym,3bturp,Jteague101,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:20:17 2015 UTC,"No the epoxy wasn't difficult the prep work was though. I used a commercial brand from a painting contractors store. My dad is a painter so I was able to purchase it. For some reason they only sell to contractors, not sure the name of it though."
homegym,3bturp,ShottyDoc,5,Thu Jul 2 04:41:42 2015 UTC,Amazing job.  Very professional looking.
homegym,3bturp,ultrazero,3,Thu Jul 2 17:16:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that was the idea I'm glad I somewhat achieved it."
homegym,3bturp,Batch5,3,Thu Jul 2 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"That's an awesome setup matching all the colours looks really professional.   Sorry for the ignorance, I only know my own squat rack which is no where near as good as yours Quick question, what are the pegs for that stick out the sides of your squat rack at the top?  Also what are workout bars in this picture? (I googled workout bars, but I just get heaps of stuff for energy bars)"
homegym,3bturp,FattyLite,3,Thu Jul 2 04:07:58 2015 UTC,"I'm obviously not OP, but the pegs are usually used to loop bands around them to add resistance, for example reverse band squats etc. The workout bars are just bars that each weigh a specific amount and are good for people who don't want to use a 45 pound metal barbell to do their exercises. You usually can't add weight to these bars and their meant to be used by themselves. For example you can use them to add some weight to your squat and they're coated with rubber so they're easy to manage."
homegym,3bturp,Guygasm,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:23:34 2015 UTC,"Oh that makes sense. Thanks for explaining. The only workout equipment I've seen/used is what I have in my little home gym, so a lot of stuff I see is a mystery."
homegym,3bturp,KeithO,2,Thu Jul 2 08:13:20 2015 UTC,They're called band pegs for band assisted training. I've never done it before as this is the first rack I've used that has them but that's what they're there for. The bars are just fixed weight barbells for light weight workouts my wife really wanted some. Hampton makes a similar thing called gel bars I believe.
homegym,3bturp,skajoeskawork,3,Thu Jul 2 11:28:14 2015 UTC,"Damn, you pretty much just shitted on every single home gym that's been posted on this sub lol. I was planning on posting some pics of my garage gym but now I don't even know if I should."
