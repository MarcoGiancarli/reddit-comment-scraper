The doc was brilliant, talking me through it and performing fast and rythmiclly. I'm sure this made a difference. Also I don't think punching holes in your bowel is not something I would want just anyone doing. I drove 8 hours (16 hr round trip) & a couple of nights in a motel to get someone with a good reputation. Insurance paid for the procedure but my wife and I paid for the rest.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3e59p8,J0HNN0,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:54:44 2015 UTC,"While PSA levels are a very imperfect test, they are more reliable than not testing. The press has sensationalized the uselessness of PSA levels in detecting prostate cancer, but at the same time the medical community in the developed world continues to use it, so even though it's nearly useless for a big range of numbers, once you get up to the point where your levels indicate a better than 50% chance, they're telling you something.  The more damning number in my case is a very low level of free PSA. Cancerous cells are very good at binding it, so once the ratio of free PSA to bound PSA goes down significantly, it's definitely time to have a look.  What bothers me is how blind the ultrasound biopsy method is. No matter how you slice it, if you're taking 12 0.5mm samples out of a 7cc prostate, your chances of hitting even a big 5mm tumor are no better than ~1/300.  If you would not have another biopsy based solely on these indicators, what indicators or symptoms would you trust more?"

They test for nerve condictivity, I am unsure if this test can say why. The needles they use are superfine and I had no problem with them, yet I hate injections (or rather the people weilding them). The zaps are so quick and are nowhere as bad as a piezo gas igniter, that they are easily handled. The hiccup is when the nerve doesn't fire and they do it several times. Still not bad but repeated quicker than normal. This is apparently normal and not incompetence of the operator. Like most things the only fear is fear itself, and afterwards you will wonder why you got a bit nervous. - it is probably worth saying that I hate electric shocks too, but the test really is not like that."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3dyphl,mojoman666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:20:37 2015 UTC,"I vape marijuana. Tried smoking it a few times and it was rough (I'm not a smoker and never was). No problems vaping (no coughing or anything).   The one thing I would be very careful with regarding edibles is their potency. You really have no idea what it is. And the time between ingestion and the time you feel their effect is so delayed that it is hard to tell what is going to happen. I vape on weekends with no problems. But the handful of times I've tried edibles I've had a bad experience. Once even waking up in the middle of the super high. Maybe I'm just a lightweight, but I'd be super careful with edibles.  You didn't mention your experience with marijuana in general, but if you're inexperienced and afraid of having a heart attack while on it, you are really heading yourself into a bad situation. Paranoia and heart attack sensations (not actually having one, but convincing yourself that you are) are common experiences if you get too high on marijuana. If you are inexperienced, I would not start with edibles. I would start very low, like a single hit or two off of someone else's vape. Then go from there."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3dyphl,mickeyknoxnbk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:54 2015 UTC,"My experience is pretty minimal. My first time I ate half a brownie that my friend brought back from a dispensary in Colorado.  I got pretty high, but it was enjoyable and I felt in control the whole time.  I was also with two friends one of which is very experienced.  As far as the health related risks go, my concern is mainly in terms of long term effects. My condition (high lipoprotein-a) gives me a naturally high cholesterol which along with smoking could seriously clog up my arteries. So it's not so much an issue of a spontaneous heart attack, but avoiding things that over time could clog up my arteries. But I guess my question would be: is it the marijuana that can clog up arteries or is it the smoke? My cardiologist told me not to smoke, which leads me to believe that it is the smoke, but I just want to be sure that consuming edibles or using a vaporizer doesn't put me at a higher risk for a heart attack."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3dyphl,Juffo_Wup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:28 2015 UTC,Your cardiologists concern is regarding smoking tobacco. That being said your concerns are valid and should be addressed by a doctor but I second what was said about edibles and the potency / perceived heart attack symptoms. A lot of that also depends on the strain and dosing which you have many choices of and can more easily regulate now that it's legal where you are going.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3dyojf,latepostdaemon,2,Mon Jul 20 17:33:40 2015 UTC,"What shampoo are you currently using?  Different dandruff shampoo will have different active ingredients, and I found it takes a bit of playing around. Head and shoulders is pretty much just zinc based, Selson Blue has a few different ones like salicylic acid, and selenium sulfide. Also pay attention to other things added into the hair products you use. Alcohol and perfumes tend to really fuck up my scalp.   Recently I had like a flare up, I guess? I had been using Selson Blue naturals with citrus and salicylic acid, and some kind of mostly unscented leave in conditioner from Head and Shoulders with zinc in it. Things had been...okay...before the flare up, but not completely gone.  Anywho, none of my regular stuff was working. I stopped using hair product for a couple weeks because it would make the flare up even worse. I normally get dandruff in two main areas of my scalp, but the flare up caused it ALLLLLL over. It fucking sucked. I tried using Coal Tar shampoo because the last time I'd had it unbearably bad with the itching and everything, that was all that worked, and it even got the flakes mostly out of my hair. This time before I used it, I wasn't really itchy, but flakes were stuck in my hair and it was getting pretty visible ):  So I tried using it again, and it didn't help at all, and I ended up getting the burning sensation pretty badly from it(which is always a possibility with coal tar shampoo).  It felt like a bad chemical burn every time I moved my hair around D: so my boyfriend I slathered aloe on my scalp and wrapped my hair in a towel and slept like that a couple times. Aloe seemed to be the only thing that really helped it at all. It also seemed to make the flakes reeeeaaaallly brittle, so I could shake them out of my hair pretty easily and didn't need to keep worrying about it being visible in my hair.  Since the aloe helped that first time, I kept sleeping with it in my hair until my scalp at least stopped burning from the coal tar. I even sort of shampooed with it instead of anything else during that time too. I ended up looking it up online, and apparently it's a natural anti fungal, and dandruff is typically an over abundance of a fungus that naturally exists on all of our scalps.  With this being I tried to look for aloe shampoos at the grocery store and such. I couldn't really find much, I know suave had one but their shampoos typically do more harm than good with my scalp, personally. I did find that Selson Blue has a shampoo with added aloe, and was also the one with selenium sulfide(which I hadn't tried yet).   When it came to styling products, I found that coconut is also a natural anti fungal, so I've been using stuff with coconut oil in it since it's also great for your hair. The only other line of products that didn't irritate me very much at all were products by John Frieda, specifically frizz ease line since I buy their curly hair products.   Ever since figuring out the aloe and coconut oil, using that specific Selson blue and styling products with coconut oil, my scalp has drastically improved. I haven't had a dandruff patches in months, and I don't have to wash my hair as often as I used to. I used to have to wash it almost every day otherwise my scalp would get unbearably itch and flakey."

Every restaurant has those floors or at least subfloor that is stiff as anything. That's because it's cheap to repair, and can take a ton of abuse. Problem being: it's bad for your knees.   Replace your shoes often, this is a big one. The foam or support in those shoes goes away quickly.   Stretch often, and maybe even start a workout regimen - While you are on your feet moving a lot of the day, that's not doing anything to strengthen the joints. I would suggest starting to do some weightlifting around the joints that hurt (in your case more legs) to see if that can help. Strong joints = stable joints, and stable joints are the thing you want the most.   STOP SMOKING - I know it's tough. Ask your dog about getting an rx for lozenges or gum that can help with reducing / quitting.   If they are swollen, continue to ice them after work.   I normally suggest a fish oil, for everyone. It helps with circulation, inflammation, and cholesterol (just a good perk). Ask your doc about this.

I've read case reports of brachial plexus damage from overnight pressure, although what you're experiencing doesn't sound like that luckily! Of course, it's difficult to change the position you sleep in; in your case, perhaps, not trapping the arm under the pillow would allow you to naturally find an alternative position?  Anecdotally; my father has had to have literally years of physiotherapy on his shoulder, because one of our previous cats used to sleep by his head and he had his arm up around him!"

I've done a lot of rehabilitation for joint injuries, and it's become apparent that I've got very loose joints so I'm prone to problems. I suspect that shoulder being more an issue than the other is related to my sleeping.  I'd often feel a bit of a subluxation in that should when I'd sleep on it, and I'd think to myself ""boy, I'll pay for this some day!"" You can sleep on your back. Your mattress may not be comfortable for it but I find now I can sleep on my back on most mattresses.  A key I find is to really keep my spine straight. I go so far as to stretch my back by digging my elbows into the bed to get a bit of a stretch and ensure it's straight.  And my back feels better than ever!"

The wisdom tooth that is partially erupted can become infected and cause pericoronitis. This can become serious. The brain fog and eye floaters don't seem related but again I'm not a Dr. Infection in your body can cause low grade temp and general malaise. I recommend seeing an Oral Surgeon. I know it's expensive but could go from bad to worse very quickly. If you have a bad taste or can see exudate around the tooth brush with peroxide till you get in to see oral surgeon. Has your MD tried a round of antibiotics to see if that resolves the issue? I'm not one for arbitrary antibiotics but if you feel better after being on them it's obviously an infection. Best of luck to you.

Now I take both and try not to overdo it with either. Hydration is also very important  Also, what you described is pretty classic for a cramp so don't let it unnerve you. I've had cramps that felt like my muscles turned to stone, sometimes actually feeling the muscles in my calves jerking under the skin as if snakes were trying to get out. Rather than walking around, I generally try to stretch out my calves by stretching my leg out and stretching my toes up (or towards my head.)

AskDoctorSmeeee,3dba90,daisiesdonttell,7,Tue Jul 14 22:59:27 2015 UTC,"Gabapentin and Welbutrin are drastically different drugs that work on different parts of the brains. If for some reason you noticed suicidal ideations from Welbutrin that were caused from a biological perspective, I would not expect gabapentin to mimic those actions since it works on a different part of the brain.   That being said, the ideations may not be completely biological in nature and I would discuss possible therapy options with your doctor as well while starting medication, and of course if you do begin to develop SI, please notify your doctor immediately. I've seen Gabapentin used many times without any notion of suicidal ideations coming up. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2992093/  Good luck and remember to keep a healthy line of communication with your doctor especially at a time like this when starting a new medication!"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3dba90,vervii,3,Wed Jul 15 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"I am not a doctor or involved in the medical field in any way, but I take gabapentin. 300 mg every night for restless leg syndrome. I also have struggled with suicidal ideation over the past couple of years, all the way to the planning phase. So I may have some input that will help!  First of all, gabapentin is a little odd. It can treat a wide range of conditions and you can take a lot without overdosing. It affects every person differently. It isn't like opiates or alcohol, where you can expect the same basic pattern every time. It's hard to say exactly what it does.  In general, I feel more disinhibited and giddy while on gabapentin, sort of like having a couple of beers or wine. Things can be a bit fuzzy mentally as well. At first it feels like a stimulant, but after an hour or so it takes on a more sedating quality. There is a sense of bodily relaxation. A big downside, though, is that it can take a while to kick in, to the tune of two hours or more, depending on bioavailability, what's in your stomach, and so on.  My suicidal ideation is related to depression, not to any particular medication. Gabapentin greatly reduces my suicidal ideation. I'm actually pretty open, relaxed, and carefree while under its influence. I am grateful to have it.  It also helps me sleep, which is a big plus. It was a lifesaver when I worked overnight shifts.  Let me know if you have any questions!"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3dba90,1015192122,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:25:10 2015 UTC,I've been on Gabapentin since... Maybe ... 2007? For pain.  At first it did cause occasional dizziness. That stopped happening after maybe 3-6 months. It also probably triggered my only major weight change in adult life... I gained roughly ten pounds. I weighed 140 for many years (10+) and then a month or so after starting it I weighed 150. I am still on it and still the same weight. Could be coincidence but it is a potential side effect.   In all that time I had a couple bouts with depression. First one started before the Gaba and second one started years after already being on it. So I don't blame it.  I was still on narcotic painkillers when I started the Gaba but a couple years into it I stopped them cold turkey. To handle the pain regulation of stopping the narcotics I upped my Gaba dose without talking to my doc... I was doing roughly twice the maximum-daily dose (3200mg/day if I recall) for around a week and a half before I talked to him and he demanded I take it down a number of notches. I never experienced any additional side effects during that crazy period or since.   No suicidal ideations.  It affects folks differently 😕

From UC Davis' food safety department, table 1:  1 cup chlorine bleach per gallon (8 oz into 128 oz, or well under 10% bleach) works out to 3200 ppm total chlorine (approximate). That's with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite.  See also page 14 from Clorox's own documentation, noting 6 oz bleach into 128 oz water (again, far less than 8-10%) producing a 2700 ppm solution of chlorine.  So, yes- several thousand ppm chlorine with just a few percent bleach in water.  Sanitizing surfaces in restaurants as per this county's health department is to use 50 to 100 ppm chlorine, which is still considerably greater than the 30 ppm for which you are concerned.

Of course symptoms get worse as it progresses and the lungs get damaged more and more. It's even been called ""consumption"" iirc, so slowly dwindling away seems pretty spot on.

Sometimes the lymphocytes are low during a viral infection which fits your symptoms.   Unfortunately, viruses don't respond to antibiotics like a bacterial infection would. A virus will usually just have to run its course over 7-21 days before you start feeling better.  In the meantime, drink plenty of fluids, get plenty of rest, take some extra Vitamin C, use your cough syrup, take Tylenol/ acetaminophen or Advil/Ibuprofen (if your not allergic to them) for the muscle aches/fever and hang in there.  Also, consider getting set up with a regular doctor to follow-up with if you get worse or present symptoms don't go away since the Urgent Care may have a group of rotating clinicians and you may not get the same one every time you go and then you have to tell the story all over again."

Roommate just found stethoscope, and breath sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally and no audible stridor despite subjective feeling of throat tightness.  It's clearly upper respiratory, whatever it is."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3d35ku,my2penniesworth,7,Mon Jul 13 06:21:17 2015 UTC,"Well, you've got a good roommate! I had a cough this winter that took 2 weeks to let up. Boy, was that irritating!   For sore throats, I find that warm, salt water gargles are the best for soothing away the soreness....and you can do them as often as you like!"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3d35ku,mercedesbends,2,Mon Jul 13 06:28:21 2015 UTC,"You don't generally cough up thick, green mucous with whooping cough. I've had it twice as an adult. It's a nasty illness when it really takes hold, but the cough is usually dry and gets MUCH worse at night. You get to the point where you almost can't catch your breath because you've coughed so much. Despite my kids being vaccinated, I was unaware that boosters were needed for it, so my kids contracted it back in 2004. One of my girls would cough so hard she would turn blue and pass out. During the day, the kids would get better, so when the doctor would see them it looked like I was just a crazy mom insisting they do something. Back then it wasn't a big deal in the news or anything, and since my kid had been vaccinated, that illness wasn't the first thought in anyone's mind. It took quite a while before their doctor said she was gonna start from scratch to figure out what was wrong. That's when we found out what it was."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3d3mcr,Erikp3,2,Mon Jul 13 06:42:16 2015 UTC,Looks like you have a radial deviation going on there.  Does it hurt?  I'd have a doctor look at that.
AskDoctorSmeeee,3d3d05,hopesdead,2,Mon Jul 13 04:54:52 2015 UTC,"Sure, there could be some chemical in the band that your allergic to or since it's non-breathable rubber, your skin could be getting sweaty under the band resulting in a rash/skin irritation.   You could experiment and wear the watch on your right wrist and see what happens. If a rash shows up you then know there is something in the band that doesn't like your skin. Therefore, removing the watch altogether should clear up the skin irritation over a few days.  If you don't get a rash on the right side then maybe it's just that the band is too close to your skin creating a moist environment and friction which is irritating the skin. Then you can try loosening the band up a notch or two so some air flow can go between your skin and the band. And also take the watch off at night to avoid further irritation.   If the rash doesn't go away then by all means have it assessed by your regular doctor."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3d3d05,my2penniesworth,2,Mon Jul 13 05:40:52 2015 UTC,I just recalled that the first few days wearing the watch I did experience lots of moisture due to sweat. It doesn't seem like that has been occurring lately.
AskDoctorSmeeee,3d3d05,my2penniesworth,3,Mon Jul 13 05:56:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd definitely test it on the right wrist to see what happens. I'd also stop wearing it on the left wrist until the rash is gone.   If you want, you can also try some over-the-counter creams such as hydrocortisone for the inflammation/allergic reaction or clotrimazole/Lotrimin which is an anti-fungal cream in case it's a yeast-type rash from the moisture.   EDIT: and, again, if the rash does not resolve or gets worse, get it evaluated in person by your doctor or a dermatologist."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3d3d05,my2penniesworth,2,Mon Jul 13 06:02:51 2015 UTC,Okay. I'll try both and see what happens.

You might want to try an ointment with Zinc oxide like A&D w/Zinc Oxide Ointment or Calmoseptine. Neither one requires a prescription.   The A&D ointment or Desitin will be in the baby section of any pharmacy. The Calmoseptine may not be on the shelf...I've used it and had to ask for it from the pharmacist. They kept it behind the counter even though it didn't require a prescription.   A little goes a long way with these ointments so get the smaller vs larger size, if you get it. I can't say for sure what type of rash it is but if it hasn't gone away in a week after trying some over-the-counter creams, then you should probably make an appt to get it evaluated."

Avoiding caffeine, no alcohol, trying to keep a regular sleep schedule, etc.  Because that is the key.  I'm glad that you realize importance of not relying on medication.  Stress will wreck a good nights sleep. So will anxiety.  I'm not sure how to can minimize your stress but that would be beneficial.  Venlafaxine can cause insomnia. Up to 25% of patients.  How long have you been on it? Because if it has been a long time then it might not be to the venlafaxine.    Some good healthy options are milk before bed (tryptophan) and 300-600 mcg of melatonin (which your body converts to tryptophan).  Don't need more than that because those are physiologic doses.  Anything more can affect your day wakefulness which can affect night...   I have worked third shift for many years.  I understand insomnia.  Come to realize how precious good rest is."

How did you conclude this?   I was concerned that the dilating drug would interfere with the exam I was there for. And it did.    What were you there for?   I'm not sensitive enough to analgesics for OTC drugs to be effective (as I learned during my endo/colo, I'm also not very sensitive to general anesthetic - drat) and my doctors have never brought it up, themselves.   Do you mean that after you experienced more pain than you expected, the doctors did not confirm your insensitivity? When/if you asked, what did they say?   Can you describe this insensitivity? Are you certain that the discomfort you felt is not the same discomfort that other patients would feel?

Probably worse off due to unnecessary antibiotics and other treatment.  What you need is a good internist who is willing to listen to you, really listen to you.

Again, not a doctor, just my layperson ""hmm this could be helpful and won't be harmful"" thought. Sometimes stepping back for a few days and gaining some perspective can help.

EDS is a genetic collagen disorder, which can result in nerve problems, neuropathy, joint pain, and can also affect the autonomic nervous system, causing gastrointestinal and a variety of other weird problems (this general problem is called dysautonomia).

So that you don't think I'm just being cautious on the internet, please know that I tell them the same thing I'm about to tell you.  The most frequent cause for bleeding in your age group are hemorrhoids (internal ones can be painless) and anal fissures (as /u/gungorthewhite has alluded to.  High fiber, like he's mentioned, is important in avoiding this type of bleeding.  However, in rare instances, there can be other causes, including inflammatory bowel disease, tumors, diverticulosis, or even weird blood vessel formations (AVMs).  Therefore, I always refer patients back to their primary care doctors, who can either follow closely, or refer you to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy.  Good luck!"

AskDoctorSmeeee,3cwozf,AllRebelRocker,5,Sat Jul 11 12:42:23 2015 UTC,"For the past three days I've been dealing with a greatly shedding and bleeding tongue and mouth ulcers or blisters on the roof of my mouth. I take imuran to manage my Crohn's disease and topamax, which I know can both cause this. I'm also on omeprazole, which is probably relevant.   My doctor prescribed me Magic Mouthwash, the suspensions of all suspensions. I had to leave work early to get to the pharmacy before they closed, in small town NY, and just made it. I foolishly did not look at my prescription, or ask for info, and now I want to know what the mixture of tasty stuff I'm swirling around my mouth is. The bottle reads:  C-Diphenh-Caraf-Antacid Susp  I can make out the diphenhydramine and antacid part, but the rest has me drawling a blank. I'm to ""swish and swallow 3 times a day,"" and I'd just like to know what I'm swallowing.   I'm also curious about the mechanism of action in the sudden appearance of the ulcers and tongue slough-thing. I'm guessing it's the imuran, I have a friend who is on a 6-MP who also gets this, and told me about the mouthwash in the first place. Is my immune system just going haywire? Is it an indicator of illness? There's been no presentation of fever or anything other than oral symptoms. Quite honestly, it's very interesting.   The top picture is last night, the bottom is this morning.   Thanks to all who read!"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3cwozf,dorzolamide,5,Sat Jul 11 12:43:47 2015 UTC,"Caraf is most likely carafate/sucralfate, an anti-ulcer medication.  This stuff works by coating the mouth and esophagus, keeping acid away from ulcers so they don't get worse. Also helps to prevent new ulcers from forming."

I also get monthly blood work and my folate is in range, although I do take a folic acid supplement daily.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3cxmiu,ashlantic,3,Sat Jul 11 18:14:01 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  If this is rotator cuff tendinitis, symptoms can last a few days, to weeks, to months, to years, unfortunately.  It really depends on the degree of inflammation as well as any co-existent injury, including tears.  I must stress that other things can cause this type of pain including arthritis.  Again, specifically for tendinitis, the general treatment involves icing (15 minutes at a time every 2-3 hours), as well as rest, and anti-inflammatories.  Regarding rest, sometimes I'll put patients in a sling to ease their symptoms, but if in a sling or immobilized, they are instructed to do shoulder range of motion exercises several times a day to avoid adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder)  I know my information is vague, but everybody differs.  Without an injury, and again if this is rotator cuff tendinitis, if you take good care of it, symptoms will hopefully resolve within a week."

Anyway, she went to a bunch of doctors, finally they did this test where you swallow blue liquid and they monitor it, watching where it goes.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3ctx9n,EagleStrigi,5,Fri Jul 10 19:15:39 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of comments I have. The first is that caffeine intoxication can be very aversive but is not necessarily acutely dangerous. This is typically associated with consumption greatly in excess of 250mg (approx. 5-6 cups of tea depending on the type/brand) and paired with a number of symptoms related to stimulant overuse. My second comment is that high consumption of caffeine (e.g. tea or coffee is typically not recommended due to the association with headaches, nausea, anxiety, etc. In addition, the addictive nature of caffeine can lead to increasing amounts and withdrawal symptoms with discontinuation.   I think we have a nutritionist on this sub, but my understanding of the literature is that as long as you drink caffeine in moderation it's not currently associated with any negative health consequences."

I can do the breath meter thingy (can't remember what it's called) and blow out with plenty of volume, so that didn't help my case.   My other thought is that you've got nasal backdrip from allergies, and that's exacerbating the situation in your lungs. The mucus puddles in the bronchioles and alveolis, making it harder for you to breathe without constriction.   You may not have allergies per se, but your body is being irritated by something in the environment (pollen or mold) because the counts are high.

Take what I have to say with a grain of salt.  I am, at this very moment, suffering the same thing you are. I am an anxiety sufferer, and it manifests itself more often than not as health anxiety. When first experiencing this breathing issue last year, I thought I was going through something very serious; an issue that might be the end of me. I suffered through it for a month and a half while out of the country doing field work, and as soon as I got home I went to the doctor and did all sorts of the same tests you described. Was in and out of the hospital a number of times checking for asthma, which runs in my family, and everything else. As with your tests, everything came back normal, and it was chalked up to anxiety.   Then, in my searches for answers online, which as someone with health anxiety I know better than to do but did anyway, I ran across some information written by a massage therapist who suggested that tight muscles in the upper back and in between your ribs can often lead to a sensation of shortness of breath, since the tightness makes it difficult for full expansion. After reading this and researching some techniques for self-massage using tennis balls and what not, it proved to be a great help. Massage was the answer for me, and will be again. As I said, I'm suffering from it again right now, but am not so worried, since I know I can massage it out myself. Now, my anxiety may still be playing a role, albeit a less direct one.

I managed without surgery an almost complete recovery by initial rest until acupuncture in the ear helped me getting down 80-90% of the pain. I then immediately began training to strengthen my back and stomach muscles with the help of a physiologist. Basically I did regular muscle training pointed at stabilizing muscles, but specifically designed for my issue.  For example I do normal sit-ups, but use a thick folded towel to support my back while doing so. Or the four-leg exercise, but with an exercise ball to support my weight initially.  It took me two years of going 2-3 times a week to the gym, but I managed to recover from a severe case (according to the doctor) to practically healed.  It is ESSENTIAL however to do this process guided by a physiologist, because you can easily do things wrong.

Insomnia is a very common co-occurrence with menopausal symptoms. Estrogen directly seems to have a sleep effect and as it decreases this can disrupt sleep. This and the onset of hot flashes are two of the primary reasons for insomnia. In a subset of women menopause also coincides with an increase in pain and arthritic symptoms which also disrupts sleep for obvious reasons. Depending on what you discuss with your pcp and what turns out to be the primary issue, they may discuss a variety of things including hormone replacement therapies, exercise, and in some cases even antidepressants.   Regardless of the origin of your sleep issue, stimulus control therapy is an efficacious therapy for insomnia that is recommended to all patients whether their sleep issues are of a primary or secondary nature.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3cicjq,cheesymama,2,Wed Jul 8 03:26:22 2015 UTC,"From what he said I'd take that to either mean that the cyst was attached to the outer layers of the vein, but not with a direct communication allowing blood to flow, or that it had formed an aneurysm-like structure with a small communication; this would likely have thrombosed shut, or could have been open and blood simply rejoined the jugular.  Blood vessels have three walls; the tunica intima, the tunica media, and the tunica adventitia.  The intima is elastic and ""waterproof"", the media is strong and stretchy and muscular (especially in arteries) and the adventitia is much looser, cushioning and protecting the vessel.  A structure (such as a tumour, your cyst etc) could be attached to the adventitia or media, so in very close proximity to the vessel lumen but not in communication, which would be painstaking to remove but wouldn't involve making holes in the vessel itself.  Conversely, something like a dissecting artery is a delamination of these layers, with blood forcing itself between the intima and media.    Regarding blood flow, if the cyst wasn't in communication with the vein, it wouldn't have been affected by the cyst (or indeed the repair).  If it was, then the swirling of blood as it entered the cyst would have made it an ideal environment for clotting, so it would likely have been at least partially filled with thrombus.    Hope this explains a bit!  Suturing veins closed is a bit less scary than dealing with arteries because it's a much lower pressure system, but it's good that your surgeon kept an eye on you to make sure the stitches were holding.  If this was several years ago, it definitely should have healed by now haha!"

AskDoctorSmeeee,3cfvwd,Gregg_Haus,25,Tue Jul 7 16:24:27 2015 UTC,"Since my first day of residency, the total number of times I have called in sick to work  is zero.  The title of that article sounds like it's baiting people to be like ""wtf docs, don't you care?!""  Yes, I care.  In residency, we had a backup system.  There was one person who had a 9a-5p rotation that was M-F.  They had backup.  So if you got sick, they'd be pulled either off that rotation, or come in on their time off.  We were told that if you were sick enough to call in, then you were sick enough that your need for rest was more important than your colleague's.  I was never called in for backup call, and I never called anyone in.  I fought through the flu, as well a pretty bad stomach bug.  But I made it through.  After graduating, I've never really been at a place that had a formal backup system.  Therefore, if anyone called in sick, the chair or vice chair of the department would have to come in to work.  Again, how does your need to be home and rest rank against the priorities?   Okay, but what about the patients?  Because it's really not about us.  It's about them.  I wear a mask and explain to them that I'm under the weather.  I wash my hands very frequently and wear gloves as much as possible.  So I consider them pretty protected.  If I have a patient who is immunosuppressed than I am extra extra careful.    At that last job, I came down with a temperature of 103 and I got some blurry vision during an overnight shift.  That was the closest I ever got to calling someone in.  But a couple of tylenol and I was back to my own self.  Okay, so I've spared the patients my illnesses.  Hopefully.  But what about the care I deliver?  That is something I'd never want to sacrifice.  So I will now show you my arrogance.  I will display to you something only my wife has heard ever leave my mouth and cross my lips.  It's my arrogant credo.... She's going to shake her head that I shared this with the world, but oh well, here goes.  Me at 50% is better than 75% of people at their 100%.  There you have it.  Your beloved Dr. Smeeee is one arrogant prick.  And I'm just going to leave that there.  I am confident in myself.  I am confident in my knowledge and my skills.  But I wouldn't do something that would potentially hurt my patients.  I'm like a starting pitcher who's loaded the bases with one out in the bottom of the 9th in a one run ballgame having thrown his 100th pitch.  It doesn't seem a good idea to anyone in the crowd to keep me in the game, but I believe in myself, and I know this batter.  I know him better than any other batter I've ever pitched to before.  And I know him better than any of the other pitchers on my staff.  And I know I can induce that 5-4-3 double play.  Play ball."

Either a letter or a card from a patient that means a lot to us (believe me, if he means a lot to you, you mean a lot to him) carries so much with it.  I've previously mentioned a card I received 6 years ago from a patient, whose heart literally stopped while I was talking to him.  I revived him, spoke to his wife at length about his prognosis, and only a month later an unexpected card arrived to the department thanking all of us on his care team.  I still have that card with me, and I do not intend on getting rid of it.  We do have a lot to deal with, and we rarely receive gestures of good will, and a card or a letter means a lot.  Additionally, if your doctor has a boss (chairman of the department, president of the hospital, CEO of the system, etc), you can consider writing them to express your appreciation.  Again, when we hear from our superiors it's usually because we've done something wrong.  It's nice to be recognized publicly as well.  Finally, if you still want to give a gift, no one of us can answer what gift would be best for you.  You two have had a relationship for over two decades and have probably laughed and cried together.  Your relationship is so intimate that you must know a lot about your doctor.  Get something that means something to both of you and your relationship, or something to him.  You must know his interests - fishing, golf, etc.  While he's made you feel special, and listened to you, show him that you too have been listening and that he's special to you.  That you care about him as a person, as well as a doctor, and that you wish him the best.    Thanks for the question and I'd love to hear how things go :)"

AskDoctorSmeeee,3ccbex,bear_sheriff,5,Mon Jul 6 20:16:19 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  This is obviously not my area of expertise, so I did some reading.  The recommendations from UpToDate do not favor checking CA-125 levels in most patients, unless they're at really high risk.    Many patients have cysts on their ovaries, and these typically come and go with each menstrual cycle.  Your symptoms could be due to one of many things, and I assume your OBGYN was considering an exploratory surgery to look for endometriosis, which can cause symptoms like you're having.  The thing about CA-125 is that it can be elevated in many other conditions.  In fact, the level goes up and down during a menstrual cycle.  Other things that can falsely elevate the test include endometriosis, fibroids, and infections, among others.  So if a test comes back elevated, it might do nothing but scare you more.  I assume that's why your OB is reluctant.  There is a LARGE number of false-positives (positive tests when there is no cancer) for CA-125 in premenopausal women, so checking patients that aren't high risk leads to many unnecessary workups (which leads to unnecessary costs to the patient).  So when is CA 125 used?  Well it's used to see how effective treatment for ovarian cancer is - doctors follow the level and trend it (hopefully downwards) as treatment continues.  It's also used for patients that have a family history of the BRCA gene, because they're higher risk, but sporadic cases in the family of ovarian cancer are not considered risk factors.  Here's a poster from the cdc stressing the importance of actually NOT doing ca-125s as a screening test: http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/ovarian/pdf/ovarian_poster.pdf  I know this probably isn't the answer you want to hear, but I thought I'd attempt a potential explanation for why your doctor is doing what she's doing."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3ccnid,curiousmousetl,2,Mon Jul 6 21:43:43 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  The main problems with cholesterol medicines called statins (I assume that's what he was put on) are muscle inflammation and liver test abnormalities.  However, I did not previously know of any correlation between statins and arrhythmias.  I did some research and actually found, according to this article that statins might actually PROTECT against atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.  So it's less likely.  Now, medicine like niacin can cause a very uncomfortable feeling, like flushing and general discomfort, which might mimic an arrhythmia.    But if he is truly having an arrhythmia (if it gets better on its own I'm guessing it's some sort of ""SVT"" or supraventricular tachycardia,  but that's purely a guess) then I do not think his cholesterol medicine (especially if it's a statin) is to blame."

No single neurotransmitter can be linked to a single aspect of emotion, emotions arise from the complex interplay between them and the many other systems in the brain.  In this case, norepinephrine agents have a variety of effects on anxiety, and they tend to vary between people. For example, Atomoxetine (primarily an NRI, with a bit of NMDA-antagonism) can both reduce and increase anxiety depending on the person."

I've only ever heard of those things before and have no idea when it should start being relevant for me. And despite it being a relatively common thing for teenagers now, she's never asked me if I was sexually active or talked about safe sex or anything like that to me. Even though I'm not, I feel like that's something my doctor should be paying attention to, because if not for me than someone else who is sexually active and never payed attention in fifth grade health class might have some issues.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,MyrrhFlower,3,Mon Jul 6 08:32:35 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to know what you don't know... you know?   But as for your doctor problem, I had the same issue. I had the same primary doctor from 12-18 and he wasn't too great on woman issues.   At 18, if you're not sexually active, you don't need a pap. They changed it from every year starting at 18 to every 3 years starting at sexual activity or 21, whichever is first.   You should totally go to a gyno if you have concerns though. At 18, I was skipping periods and had PCOS. If you have any concerns about your cycles, cramps, or want to proactively get on birth control you should definitely go to a gynecologist.    And as for mammograms, they're way far away. You should do breast exams and get to know how your breasts feel, but understand that young women are prone to have (or develop) 'lumpy' fibrocystic breasts. The tissue in the breast is so dense in your age group they often avoid mammograms until later because they can't see anything, and fibrocystic breasts aren't bad. Over half of women have them at some point. A good rule for self checks is if you find a lump on one side that concerns you, you should be able to find a mirror image of the lump on your opposite breast. If not, you can ask your doctor to perform a breast exam at your annual physical.  You should also get the guardasil shot, if you haven't already. It helps protect you from certain types of HPV, which is good since there is no HPV test for men.The shot comes in a series of 3 inoculations and has to be received before you're 25, so sooner is better than later."

Basically everything my doctor should have already covered, it sounds like! And I have actually had one of the HPV vaccination shots, but my mother decided that I didn't need the others because she tends to be one of those unbelievable people who is afraid of vaccines and thinks that since I'm not sexually active now, I'll never need it and that it'll give me cervical cancer. Thankfully, I'm the age now where I can choose to have them without her consent - except for the fact that my doctor is reluctant to ""go behind my mom's back"" and give me the vaccine when she knows my mother wouldn't approve. Writing this out now I'm really realizing how ridiculous this all is. Either way, thank you again for such a helpful reply!"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,ponte-vanima,37,Mon Jul 6 11:47:31 2015 UTC,"I have not had great experiences with doctors, so this is kinda long I guess.   Please tell me what you are actually diagnosing me with. A lot of times I've been to the doctors and they've just been like ""here is a treatment that I think will help with your symptoms"" without actually telling me what they think is wrong with me. (This is especially true with a patient that you know has a condition that will prevent them from asking you themselves.) If a patient with a uterus comes in with unexplained vaginal bleeding, and says it's not menstruation, take them seriously. We get periods every month, we can usually tell the difference. If a patient comes in who is mentally ill, do not discount their symptoms as ""physical signs of stress"" or ""delusions"" or whatever. Sure, maybe it's that. Or maybe it's an actual, real medical problem that you could actually do something about. It's worth examining them, at least. If you are going to treat symptoms (separately from the cause), then learn which symptoms are most bothersome to the patient and treat those. If someone has terrible nausea and vomiting literally every day that makes them miss school/work, and mild pain every few weeks, treat the nausea over the pain. If you have a pediatric patient that is adult-sized, please use adult-sized chairs/bedpans/etc. Have you ever tried to use a pediatric bedpan? They are not designed for 120 pound humans, and when you sit on them, they will bend and dump pee all over the bed. Not fun. TELL PATIENTS IF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT CATHETERS IN THEM!!!!!!!! Even if you think it's common knowledge that ""patients get cathed during this procedure,"" the patient might not know that. Waking up and learning that strangers have been in my undies without my permission SORT OF FREAKS PEOPLE OUT. If I ask why I need a prescription/procedure/etc don't give me non-answers like ""because it's better for you"" or ""because it will help you."" Like, no, I thought you wanted me to take these meds to make me worse.   Edit: I didn't really expect this to get so much attention, I'm flattered! And I apologize for the rant-y tone, I just get kind of frustrated when I think about this."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,smoike,10,Sun Jul 5 21:33:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed, they are all excellent points.  And like you've mentioned, communication is everything.  If we voice our reasoning for why we do things, and help our patients understand the ""why"" and not just the ""what,"" I feel it leads to a better understanding of expectations.  Patients also sometimes feel like ""they did nothing for me"" even when they had a huge workup.  If you don't tell them what you're thinking and why you do the things you do, of course they'll feel like you did nothing for them."

Mind you I've always been the type of person to ask a bunch of questions so that I both understand everything and if there is anything extra I can do to make the whole situation improves as quickly as possible.   Every g.p. has been happy when I've read up on symptoms and just gotten a bit of a better grip of what's going on with me/ my child, etc. That way I can be part of the trouble shooting process and not just a maze of cluenessness to navigate.  The only other suggestion I can make is positive interaction with nursing staff. It's one thing to rush in and out taking stats quickly because your under the pump by the head nurse or doctor.

It could work in many cases, but not everytime. The nausea, in this case, could be due to some problem that is the source of the pain.

Why not collaberate? From my perspective honestly it makes you as a whole sound like idiots and I now only go to the doctor when I know I need antibiotics or for an emergency and I have a laundry list of medical problems that should be followed up with routinely but since I am just bumped from specialist to specialist and each one guesses the same thing and runs the same tests and they never talk to each other or listen to me I don't like wasting my time.

This is also the reason why I ask all my patients to followup with their primary care doctors AS WELL as any specialist to which I refer them.

I wish someone had said something like that sooner. But instead, it seems Dr's avoid sensitive subjects. I feel like I'm just a lab subject, not a person."

Doctors would say: exercise more, see a nutritionist, etc.    It wasn't until a year ago that my primary care Dr. started to offer on-line patient profiles.  You can go on and make appts, ask for a med refill AND read the Dr.'s notes on your chart.  The first time I logged on I was stunned.  The word obese was used so many times in my charts; but obviously had not been uttered in my visits.    I felt pissed off and embarrased; but now 10 months later I am down 60lbs.

It's hard to just say ""you're overweight"" when they come in for a laceration.  But when they come in with something related to that, such as pain in their heel, or uncontrolled blood glucose, it allows me to tell them.  It's harder to do this sort of thing in the ED because I don't have a lot of time to develop a relationship with a patient, so I'm sure it's really easy to make it off-putting.

Instead, I try to practice cost-efficient care combined with good communication.  I test less, and talk more.  I go through my reasoning with patients and tell them there's a chance I might be missing something, but the chance is much less than the cost/risk of the diagnostics.  I've found that patients appreciate that approach.  Almost everyone can understand sparing expenses at the patient's benefit."

While $20 doesn't completely break my budget, it's extremely frustrating to receive a bill after a doctor visit that's supposed to be completely covered.  My most recent example, during well woman, I asked if taking naproxen sodium was better (more effective) than taking ibuprofen for cramping.  He answered by briefly discussing the differences; I was satisfied with his response.  When I got the unexpected bill, I called the office and they told me that ""pain management is unrelated to a well woman visit.""  They ended up dropping it, as I was able to demonstrate that the pain was directly related to the appointment.  Other times I've been unable to reverse the charges.

I drove her home with her high as a kite and having minor hallucinations.  It took me calling an ambulance at 5am the next morning for them to realize we weren't playing shoppa-doc and actually had taken her seriously and gotten a MRI done, etc. She was admitted to the temporary ward (where they await a bed in the appropriate ward) that evening and fully into the gastrointestinal ward by 9am the next day. She was shortly identified as having a perforated small intestine..it was the bile leaking causing the intense pain. Medication fixed the problem and they kept her high as a kite to over a week as allergies kept her off some of the mid grade pain relief. She was sent home with the all clear after 8 days along with enough tablet Morphine to start the weaning off process.  Once she was in, she was treated fantastically, it was an uphill battle to prove she wasn't scamming for pain killers though."

Here there's been a move to encourage appropriate prescribing, which has included both a shift away from PRN medications towards regular use, de-escalating down the pain ladder ASAP where possible and using the most appropriate drugs (they're really pushing diamorphine and fentanyl at the moment, especially for palliative).  Any thoughts?"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,sadwhalenoises,6,Sun Jul 5 20:04:40 2015 UTC,"We're definitely moving in that direction here... but slowly.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,shanni365,4,Mon Jul 6 07:38:48 2015 UTC,"It certainly is on the national level. The Department of Veterans Affairs (the largest healthcare organization in the United States) is nearly 2 years into a comprehensive pain management initiative called the Opioid Safety Initiative. At the heart of this is to find ways to safely reduce and limit prescription opioids:   coordinates pain management to include patient and provider education, testing and tapering programs, and alternative therapies like acupuncture and behavior therapy.   This program has its dissenters too. There is a small but vocal minority that believes that it's ""too late"" for the long term chronic opioid users, that their neurobiology has changed irrevocably and that contracts and harm reduction are the way to go. This group of dissenters believes the focus should be on prevention instead.  I don't agree with that.

For goodness sake, give them ALL of the info, let them know the symptoms that may occur when stopping the medication, teach them what signs/behaviors to look for the could indicate a possible problem.

The reverse is more common to run into - doctors scared to order pain meds because of this addiction scare bs.  If you need pain meds, you do not become addicted. Your body goes through withdrawals as with any medication but that is not addiction. Those of us with chronic pain are labeled, under medicated, treated like second class citizens and worse.    Please treat patients with respect. Put pain  management as a necessary and important part of patient treatment.  Do not determine what is necessary based on age (26 year old daughter with multiple auto immune issues). Do not base on tattoos (myself, daughter, son with tattoos).  Do not base on the fact we are not crying or that we have the ability to be friendly with you.  I have ridden in am ambulance because of pleurisy and pneumonia and still managed to say please and thank you. Plus I am physically unable to produce tears so not a good reference.    TL:DR.

We're here to learn, everyone can always improve, people gain nothing from being told they're worthless.  If someone asks you something and gets abuse in return, they're going to stop asking, then nobody improves, and mistakes happen.  There was a wrong-site-surgery incident a couple of years ago, in the same trust I study, partly due to staff being unwilling to confront a notoriously vitriolic surgeon.

Soon after this interaction I collapsed and split my chin down to the bone, and every time I look at my scar I am reminded if this person.  Six months later, I was referred to a cardiologist. His theory for the loss of consciousness was that stress caused vasovagal syncope. Logically, I can understand that stress is ""in your head"" and your body can have a physical reaction; however, there is a big difference between that explanation and saying ""it's all in your head"".

I watched my friend go through med school, and her bedside manner transformation was both understandable and appalling. It's a horribly stressful environment and purposely sleep-depriving. I'm surprised the methods of teaching have not changed in decades. I have heard ""I hope this person doesn't die on my rounds, so I don't have do all of the paperwork"" and ""I hope this person dies soon. They keep taking up my time and interrupting my breaks"". What made you decide to be different a different kind of doctor?"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,bear_sheriff,3,Mon Jul 6 17:44:45 2015 UTC,"I'll admit it, I have had those thoughts, especially during training.  Residency is really a dehumanizing process ... we work long hours, tough hours, with minimal sleep, constant responsibility, and high risk.  There's low reward, and a large amount of criticism.  It's a tough 3-7 years  and many people end up forgetting why they went into medicine in the first place.  We all change.  It's inevitable.    During residency, though, I was exposed to many different styles of practice - both medically, and personally.  There was one specific doctor in the ER who spoke to us firmly and confidently as residents, but then with patients, spoke with them in a soft voice, asked them if they had questions, and always had great interactions with them.  I chose him as one of the 3-4 attendings that I wanted to emulate in my career.  I took technical skills from others, and thought process from others.  But his mannerisms and the love that his patients had for him stuck with me.  I saw their reactions, and realized that medicine was much more than just making diagnoses and doing procedures and giving medicine.    I know that all sounds really fluffy, but on top of that, I have been in charge of ""patient satisfaction"" in my last few jobs.  I've been on hospital wide committees and given presentations on it.  I know the data, I know what a difference communication can make, and I know what makes patients satisfied.  For the majority, it's NOT giving antibiotics to colds, it's NOT giving narcotics, it's just talking to people and explaining your thought process, and involving them in their healthcare decisions.  Patients don't want to be tossed around or feel like guinea pigs.  They want a sense of control.  I am an interpreter.  I take symptoms and findings, I put it together and I spit it out back to the patient in a language they can understand.  I discuss the data, the prognosis, and the expected course for different strategies of therapy, and together, I make a decision with the patient.    So that's a long explanation to your very last question.  At the end, it just makes sense.  And it makes me feel good about my job and the job I'm doing, as well as the difference I'm making in people's lives."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,Itchygiraffe,3,Mon Jul 6 19:45:05 2015 UTC,This reminds me of a friend who went to multiple doctors over the span of almost 2 years and towards the end the only suggestion the doctors had for her was it was in her head and maybe if she walked around singing she would be happier and cure herself. Turns out she was then diagnosed with ALS.  I'm guessing all the singing in the world wouldn't cure that.
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,BluebirdHaiku,22,Mon Jul 6 13:44:33 2015 UTC,"I do have a really strong suggestion based on something that happened a year ago.  At the time I was living in Southern Missouri. This will become relevant, as you will see. Over the process of a year, I lost my hearing in one ear.  My ENT Doc ran an MRI, but it was inconclusive.  I have constant ringing, but ... hearing has diminished to the point where I am functionally deaf in one ear :(  This was a little hard to take.  Dr. Smith was nice enough, but perplexed over why this was happening.    When he gave me the MRI results, I teared up a little and he said ""Do you mind if I try something a little unusual?""  ""Um, go for it!"" I said. He said, ""I'd like to pray for you.""  I don't want to make the guy feel awkward, but believe in full disclosure, so I said ""That's kind of you. I'm an atheist, but I won't say no that."" (Assuming he was going to say a little prayer for me sometime.) NOPE!  He scooted his little wheeled chair over to my side and I realized that the prayer was going down now and that hand-holding might be involved.  So I folded my arms and tried not to look freaked out.  He bowed his head and talked to Jesus for a while and then we said a few more things and I left.  My ear did not heal. I think Jesus might have cursed it because I didn't hold the doc's hands.  My suggestion is to not pray with patients or - at least - when you find out they're atheist, don't put them through a really awkward situation.  I have a feeling that you, Smee, are a little more culturally sensitive :D"

While I do not specifically believe that some deity is looking down and noticing how many people are praying for a loved one, I do believe in the healing power of the mind, and if I can bring a patient or a patient's family some degree of comfort, in any way, then I have (at least partially) done my job.  Thanks for the story! And sorry about your ear :("
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,BluebirdHaiku,3,Sun Jul 5 19:13:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing that. I have to wonder if it's awkward for you.  Especially if they put you in a position of praying. How would you ease out of that?

I was aghast; like you, I'm an atheist and found it very off-putting.  A few years ago I was in the hospital for chest pains (turned out to be gall bladder), and the chaplain came by to offer prayer. I told him thank you very much, but I'm atheist; thanks for the visit, though. He was a bit shocked, I think, and mumbled some platitude before beating a hasty retreat."

I've been been referred out to seven different specialists as new symptoms keep popping up.  I don't think I have fibromyalgia, but I'll likely never know because my second opinion agreed and my doctors don't talk to each other.  They contradict each other and when I point that out, I'm told that I MUST HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD the other doctor.  I'm at my wits end, unable to work and taking a shit-ton of medicine. My frustration has been diagnosed as depression, despite my insistence that I am not depressed, I go ahead and take the 3 different medications prescribed for depression, which haven't done a thing.  I'm also on 2 medications for anxiety, two for blood pressure, a muscle relaxer, one for neurolopathic pain, birth control, Sumatriptan (as needed), a low dose antibiotic for acne, and painkillers.  I'm starting to have kidney issues now, which is in the diagnosis stage.  And I get SEVERE vertigo for weeks if I have any kind of virus. I wish one of my doctors would look at the whole picture, rather than just trying to stomp out symptoms.  Sorry for the rant.  I didn't take my Valium today.

I was on a weight loss drug for awhile and didn't know it was a stimulant. My psychiatrist had no explanation for why Xanax wasn't working for me. Additionally she prescribed me an antidepressant that should never have been prescribed with said weight loss med, and it gave me serotonin syndrome. My GP who gave me the weight loss drug also knew I was on that antidepressant since I saw her the day after I started taking it, and if nothing else I thought the pharmacist would have caught it. Nope. I figured it out myself after my health declined rapidly and I did my own Google search.

After I was diagnosed with my second miscarriage (of a baby that had been conceived after a lot of time and money spent on fertility treatments), I had to have a D&C. The anesthesiologist heard we were planning to go visit my in-laws after the surgery and told me to ""milk this [the surgery and recovery] for all it's worth."" Yes, thank you, doctor; I would love to use my baby's untimely demise for my own personal gain. </s>  The doctor who did the surgery (not my normal OB, who was out for a holiday) told me to not worry about spending money on further testing and just go on a cruise and relax and I would definitely get pregnant again. I hadn't even decided at that point if I wanted to try again, and I'd been through enough testing and treatment that we knew more intervention would definitely be needed if we did try again. I found his ""advice"" very uneducated/old-fashioned and insulting, like he was brushing off how sad this was for us.  On the other hand, the nurses who told me they were sorry for my loss and the anesthesiology resident who didn't say much at all but kept his tone subdued and just made sure to answer all my questions respectfully were a big help. It was pretty obvious I was not in a joking mood and was finding all of this very difficult, considering I had tears streaming down my face most of the time until I was put under."

On the other hand, my knee surgeon was a grumpy prick. I tried to research and educate myself before I went in, super nervous, for my first appointment of this type ever. I told him I thought it was a meniscus tear, he feels it a bit, says it's the ACL and ""that's why we don't typically let patients diagnose themselves.""

Docs know how addictive these meds are, even taken exactly as prescribed they cause dependence and very uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. When someone is already sick and trying to heal, and barely has the energy to stand up, that can be catastrophic.   Doctors should have to educate patients on the effects of stopping opiates (or even benzos, etc.). Then, taper them gently. And tell the person that the last prescription is the last, not just let them find out when they come in for a refill by saying ""I think you don't need them anymore"".   Maybe even prescribe short term meds to help get over the detox - something to ease the insomnia and RLS and anxiety.   But docs tend to just drop unwitting patients into acute opiate withdrawal like it's ripping off a bandaid. That sets up a lot of people to become drug addicts because the only thing they can think of to do is start taking illicit opiates."

For instance, on May 7th I started having pain that would shoot from my vaginal opening all the way up to my belly button. The pain was so agonizing that my vision blacked out and if I was standing, my legs would give out. Yes, I was on my period. But I've been having horrible periods for 14 out of 26 years, so I know what a bad period feels like and what a cramp feels like. I've had cramps keep me from functioning. But I had never had pain that would make my legs buckle and my vision go black.   Two doctors just dismissed it as my period. The third doctor (that the second doc called in because I asked them to) ended up figuring it out. He worked with me over a month, calling and checking on me and doing multiple ultrasounds to keep watch on what he thought it was. On June 11th I had surgery to have 2 cysts removed, scar tissue removed, and a nerve severed because it had scar tissue built up all around it. I was lucky my third doctor listened to me when I talked to him and talked with me about it.   I wish more of my doctors would just sit and listen.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,Itchygiraffe,5,Mon Jul 6 21:51:37 2015 UTC,"The only thing that bothers me - and I understand it, super busy - is when they act like they can't wait to get out of the room/are just waiting to see the next person.  I totally get it.. because that's what is happening.  But it is nice every once in a while to have a doctor who you feel like is there for YOU only at that moment."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,Itchygiraffe,3,Mon Jul 6 02:01:03 2015 UTC,Currently in the hospital with preeclampsia at 31weeks - I know it's a teaching hospital and you're making rounds but please give me a minute to digest what you are asking me and telling me. Stop making me feel like you know what's best and need to keep moving. Slow down. I'm here alone at a hospital I wasn't planning on givin birth at and I'm scared. Please take 5 min with me and make sure I understand.
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,junesponykeg,3,Mon Jul 6 02:40:14 2015 UTC,"Teaching hospitals are great in some respects, but they can also be tough as patients - having to answer the same questions often can be rough.  Also, when we are training as residents, we have to focus almost entirely on the medicine.  We don't know enough yet to have that real human connection, because we're so nervous and green about medicine.  I find that with more time and more comfort with medicine in general, I've now fallen into a comfort level where taking care of the medical aspects is second nature, and I can free my mind up to talk with the patients more and become human again."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,MyrrhFlower,6,Mon Jul 6 08:45:10 2015 UTC,"You guys probably have seen me comment a few times here. I love this sub, and I freaking love that this question is being asked.   I know not a lot of people understand how to interpret things happening in their body. I know this because of some of the questions asked here and how my doctors have treated me in the past. Please try to take interpretations seriously. Stop shoving pills at my problems. Giving me antibiotics for food stuck in my tonsils is a waste. Giving me vicodin for ""shingles"" that I find out 2 months later is mono is a waste. If a patient has only come in for the same problem over and over and over, please take that chronic condition seriously, we're sick, not bored.  I can't tell you how many times I've warned doctors and nurses of my vasovagal before taking blood, and they still try to stick me while seated, or sit me up too soon. Guess what? Part of my brain isn't getting blood so of course I can't answer you, don't fucking move me. I honestly can't help it, it happens with small pricks that draw blood, I'm faint not an infant. Telling me to tough it out isn't going to pump blood back to my brain. If you tell me to call back for my test results on Tuesday, I'm calling on Tuesday, try not to act surprised. I have an unusual problem with expressing physical pain. A doctor once examined me for appendicitis, and while I only had a stomach bug, the pain caused me to tear up and (inaudibly) cry. If you're looking for pain you should probably say so. Also, you guys seriously need something better than the 1-10 scale. If I waited 3 days in agony, it's a freaking 10. Your office staff probably sucks. Fire them. Hire people with customer service backgrounds outside of healthcare - McDonald's, Wal-Mart, call center, something.   Phew, hopefully that's all. I'm sure I'll edit. And I know this is really personal, but I would bet some others can relate. Thanks fir the question!"

After a few days, during his rounds the doc asked me if my bowels had moved. I said no, I don't have anything left to go with. He made absolutely no response and just ignored me... which I found a bit off putting. Especially as I found out later that day that I did have a wee bit left and that you do not get rid of 100%. He could have mentioned this... I felt like an idiot... and thought the doc seemed a bit arrogant (asking a question & ignoring my answer) and I didn't have the same rapport with him afterwards."

It's so patently obvious that so many doctors do not give a flying fuck about their patients as people. And I understand that you have to have a certain level of distance so you don't get emotionally fucked with that kind of job.

I recently have had issues with the nurse at my primary's office telling me when I don't need to be seen without consulting my doctor. Maybe that is the case but I would like the doctor to answer that. She also tries to diagnose me before I even see the my doctor. My last visit she even questioned a medicine I was prescribed, essentially questioning the doctor. Quite unprofessional   I could, and should, let my doctor know how dissatisfied I am with his nurse but I don't feel comfortable doing so. Maybe having a regular satisfaction survey or comment form for the patients would help in anonymously voicing those opinions."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,butidontthink,3,Sun Jul 5 20:05:51 2015 UTC,"Well, for most of my life my GP has been my dad, so it's been pretty damn good, and I don't have a lot to directly contribute (though I may think of something as I go)   As I've always noticed from talking to him, 90% of the job of a GP is counselling and prognosis. Yes, you diagnose this and prescribe that, but honestly that's the tip of the iceberg.   Patients primarily visit their GP because they are uncertain. They want to know if they should worry about symptom X, whether it's diagnostic of something dire and/or causing progressive damage, or whether it's something they can safely ignore.   Once they know where they stand, actually treating it is a relatively minor consideration.   This is certainly the case with me; I just need to know where I stand.   Beyond that, lifestyle counselling is the next biggest chunk. Helping people manage their illness, but also helping people manage the interaction it has with their daily lives. Talking to them, getting the bigger picture, putting it in context with their relationships and their job and whatnot. Very often a small problem will be have a much larger impact than it need have, because of stress or self-esteem or having too many dependencies hanging off an area of weakness.   It's a bit like doing tech support for your parents: yes, this minor issue needs fixing, but honestly it's only a problem because you're doing it wrong. I can tinker with MS Office to stop it being so slow, sure... but you only use it to open up a document containing hyperlinks to google searches for your favourite sites. If I can just teach you to use the bookmarks bar instead, your quality of life will improve a hundredfold.   Of the relatively few other encounters I've had...   Dismissive communication is the worst. I had (what turned out to be) IBT following a knee injury, and was in intermittent pain for ages. I went to a physio, went to some trouble to explain the sudden, crippling bursts of slammed-my-synovium-in-a-car-door pain, and after poking and humming a bit, he said ""you have short muscles, do these stretches"", and sent me out the door.   Totally my fault, but I dismissed him as an idiot who didn't even listen - this wasn't muscle pain, ffs - and didn't follow through.   It wasn't until a considerable amount of time and pain later that I tried again; I went to a different physio, who said ""You have shortened muscles which are pulling your leg out of alignment so you keep clipping the back of your patella on the end of the bone, causing that horrible pain, do these stretches.""   I was suitably chastened, and an embarrassingly long ailment was fixed in a matter of weeks. I take full responsibility for my own ornery stupidity in that regard, but there's a lesson here: if you want to achieve high patient compliance, you have to connect with them, demonstrate your understanding of their problem, and give them some understanding of how your treatment will help them.   Dentists. Nobody likes going to dentists, because they always sit in judgement. They're completely right to sit in judgement; most people take horrible care of their teeth, and so much could be avoided if they weren't so despicably lazy... but one reason people avoid going is because they're going to get told off again.   I think I've told this story already, but it bears repeating. An ER doctor very nearly killed my wife once, by refusing to take a history. She presented with severe heartburn-like pain, and he cut her off when she tried to explain how long she'd had it and the treatments she'd tried. He took an ECG, and bundled her out the door with some Nexium (which she'd been on for three days to no effect) and a shot of Xylocaine viscous, and told her to see her GP in a week if the pain continued.   A few hours later the pain was worse than ever, so I took her across town to a different hospital. The doctor there actually took a history, said 'Ah.' - three minutes and a portable ultrasound later, she was booked in for an emergency cholecystectomy. It took three hours longer than scheduled because they had to drain it before they dared remove it; the surgeon said that waiting even another couple of hours might have been fatal.  So above all, don't be that guy. Listen to your patients, even if it seems straightforward."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,P_Grammicus,3,Sun Jul 5 23:52:44 2015 UTC,"Insist on a one-on-one chat with your teenage patients. Most of my doctors gave me the option to have my mom in the room the whole time, so of course I said yes. There was NO WAY I was willing to deal with the fallout of being the one to boot my mom out of the room. Then, when I was about 17, I saw a doctor who just simply insisted on a short one-on-one chat. My mom bowed to her authority, thank goodness. What followed what the first time I ever had the opportunity to be honest with an adult about my sexual activity and to ask the questions that would have gotten me grounded forever. I credit that doctor for clearing up a lot of bullshit that my church and school fed me about sex. I grew up under the thumb of purity culture, and I had genuine fear that the things my boyfriend and I did together could get me pregnant (they couldn't). She actually gave me the real facts and told me that if I ever decided to have sex, she could prescribe me birth control without my parents knowing. That 5 minute chat saved me a lot of potential pregnancy scare terror, and was the only real sex-ed that I ever got.   Talk about long-term side effects. I ended up with pre-osteoperosis (not sure if that's the actual term) because I was prescribed the Depo shot for 3 years consecutively. I had no clue as to the risks of long-term use. Luckily, it was discovered in time to reverse it, but only because I switched to a better doctor.    Don't question your patients' desire to prevent pregnancy. One doctor asked me (prior to my divorce) what my husband thought of my going on birth control. Seriously, what the fuck? I also had to seriously shop around before I found a doctor willing to insert an IUD. The first few I went to basically acted like I was too young to decide I wouldn't want kids in the next 5 years. That's ridiculous. I was old enough to make an (at least) 18-year commitment to raise a child but not old enough to decide I'm not old enough for a kid? Again, what the fuck?   Don't treat your patients like liars until they actually lie to you. I loved my doctor so much that I insisted my boyfriend go to her when he got sick. He had always had terrible experiences with doctors, and I was just so excited to introduce him to my hip, compassionate doctor. She was really nice to him until she found out that he is a former drug addict and that he had done a short stint in jail. He was honest with her about our occasional recreational use of psychedelics and our frequent use of cannabis. When he told her he felt that he might be depressed because he always feels tired and lethargic, her response was ""Maybe you should stop staying up nights doing drugs."" He reiterated that we kept it to once a month or less, but she refused to address the issue. She didn't believe him that he had been administered a TB test upon his release from jail, and forced us to put masks on and instructed us to both wear them until his new test came back clean. My next visit was very different in tone to all the previous ones, and she tried to force an STD test on me, saying ""You never know what your boyfriend could be doing, even if you think you are monogamous."" I really feel like his honesty about his history ironically resulted in him being treated like a liar and an all-around scumbag.   Be informed about the medications you prescribe. I've found stuff online about medications prescribed that I directly asked my doctor about and she couldn't answer. Seriously, if you made it through med school, a simple google search shouldn't be over your head.  Sorry if that was at all ranty. The majority of doctors I've been seen by have been absolute angels, and I don't judge the ones I had bad experiences with too harshly. You folks have a hard job, and I'm really grateful for what you do!"

AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,THE_DUCK_HORSE,3,Mon Jul 6 02:27:36 2015 UTC,"I think a big one is to explain what the test results mean. My brother had severe joint pain develop in his early twenties, and the rheumatologist he was referred to was phoning it in so hard that he didn't make eye contact, or even bother waiting for my brother to leave the room before reciting notes into his dictaphone. He told my brother his xrays were clear, and that was that. It left my brother with the impression that the doctors believed his joint pain was psychosomatic, when in fact the blood work form he was later given stated that my brother has RA. Nobody ever formally diagnosed him.  One of my best experiences with a doctor didn't directly involve me as a patient - I used to live in a maisonette, and there was an old fella that lived in the upstairs flat. His family didn't give a damn, and it fell upon my boyfriend and I to clothe and look after a guy with alcoholism and dementia while we tried to get help from social services. (We didn't even know his name up till then, he'd kept to himself right up to the point he turned up naked in our garden looking for his milk. It was the most nightmaric scene you can imagine upstairs. All the lightbulbs had been smashed, his house was covered in bloody vomit, the heating was on tropical so the smell was unbearable, he kept his stools in the bathroom sink...). One time I heard an almighty bang upstairs, and then crying. I found him with a lump on his head the size of an egg. After trying his family (""Uh-huh. Tell us how you get on at the doctors""), I took him to the hospital and there was this lovely lady doctor that took care of him. Once she took a history, and made sure he was ok, she turned to me and asked if I was okay. I'd felt like King Canute, ordering back the tide - he'd got to the stage where he would sometimes turn up on my doorstep twelve times in a row, and I was exhausted, and stressed out, and I don't know, just the fact that she noticed and asked made it all feel a little bit more manageable. Like I wasn't a dick for feeling washed out by it all. Sometimes it's not just the patients that carry the brunt of an illness.  I guess rapport is what it all boils down to. If we're going to open up our most embarrassing secrets to you, it's easier to do that in a dialogue than in a monologue. I went to the doctors a couple times in my twenties about blood in my stool. The whole process was so uncomfortable that, when I was reassured it was nothing, I never went back. Now a decade later (and after reading a thread on askdocs about the subject!) I've just been told it's very likely I have intestinal endometriosis, and I'm sat here, waiting for a letter to refer me for a laparoscopy, feeling like I'm carrying around Schrödinger's womb, kicking myself for not going back sooner.   So, yeah. Echoing what others have said. Communication and rapport."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7u6h,HowAboutShutUp,3,Mon Jul 6 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"I rarely visit the doc as an adult but my experiences have been varied:   used to have breathing issues associated with psychological stress, i suppose an anxiety attack which resulted in me breathing really deep and sometimes i think hurting my muscles as a result, i went to one doctor who just passed me over because i wasnt having the attack in front of her. She said come back and see me when you have it. It was pretty disappointing because i travelled quite a bit to see the doctor. If it didnt bother me to a point i really felt was cause for concern, i wouldnt have gone at all. I wished she could have at least run by with me potential causes and things i could have done. It was 1 in the morning and she had no other customers so i dont think she had any reason to hurry. another incident happened when i had a sort of throat lymph thing in my throat which was inflamed resulting in accumulated phlegm as well as hard of breathing as a result. The doctor was a fairly younger guy and instead of addressing me, he simply googled the matter and showed it to me in a website. He briefly explained what was happening to me but I felt he wasnt addressing the difficulty to breath that i had as a result. Once again i felt passed off especially from the way he kept saying like it was nothing. I was often kept awake because the phlegm accumulation was blocking my air passages. I eventually found mucusolvan through the internet and thats been a blessing fore whenever things got bad. best doctors experience i had was from an old guy, he easily picked out my deep breathing problems was caused by having too much stress in my life and even offered to give me a referal for a psych assessment. I actually felt better unloading my problems on him. He was pretty costly to consult though so i never went back.

I had injections into my ankles under xray and I could see each time (on the screen) when the needle was not going where it should between the bones. It appeared the doc wasn't looking at the screen because the needle wasn't lined up from the start and was repeatedly pulled out and reinserted. I am aware I was only looking on one plane but many times I could see that even the repositioning wasn't going to work. Also the last fusuin was done awake due to the risk of developing a pain syndrome and looking at the screen near the end of the operation I could see the screw was too long and sure enough it went through the bone and out the other size and was replaced with a shorter one. Now I usually prefer to watch when I can but seeing things like this do not give me onfidence in the medical profession. But don't stop me watching when I come in for a few stitches if I want to look. And if I say I don't need a local anesthetic  ( usually if there within an hour of the cut) then I will not need one. Over the years I have had enough cuts to know that 2 or 3 stitches hurt less than an injection and 12 stitches done by a proficient doctor are so quick and easy, but i must be watching. The pain is also less afterwards."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3c8zhs,Smeeee,2,Tue Jul 7 00:37:11 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  Bruising can occur both at the site of the injury, but also further down, due to gravity.  So yes, there's a correlation, but it's not always right over the fracture/injury site.  Bruising occurs when something breaks, whether it's a fracture of bone, or a torn ligament or tendon (whether partial or complete).    For what it's worth regarding walking, you can have an ankle fracture like a fibular fracture and be able to bear weight since the tibia bears most of the weight.  In fact, sometimes the fibula is removed in patients and used as a bone graft elsewhere in the body.    Good luck to you."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c8zhs,gurueuey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:21:49 2015 UTC,That's interesting. Is the gravity reason due to resting? I have no medical training but I do have experience with hospice and that is one of the signs of lack of circulation.  Thank you for the good wishes.
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7fm7,BronxLens,9,Sun Jul 5 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  Personally, in my experience, the most painful procedures are incision and drainage of abscesses.  The problem lies in the fact that the pH within an abscess cavity is low and (insert some stuff about pKa and pH that I forgot because med school was a very long time ago) as a result lidocaine and other numbing agents injected on top of or into an abscess are much less effective.    Still, I often see patients who have had their abscesses injected and then practitioners have gone in, while the patient screams bloody murder.  I like to make the patient scream bloody murder before hand, by creating either a field block, or performing a local nerve block, for these types of procedures.  These still hurt, because you're injecting the skin with a numbing agent, which burns (but you can add sodium bicarbonate to decrease the burning), but it's one of those no-pain, no-gain kind of things.  By causing some mild pain before-hand, you can achieve numbing of the affected area and a procedure that's tolerated much better, because you're numbing up healthy tissue with a normal pH.  The other big procedure that we perform without even thinking about it (or order it performed by a nurse) is a nasogastric tube.  That's a tube that goes in the nose, down the throat, and into the stomach, and is used to drain the stomach and help with bowel rest in the cases of bowel obstructions and other inflammatory bowel processes.  This study from long ago was often quoted to me and I often tell residents/trainees about it.  It's a procedure that many think is quick and easy, but in reality it's very painful for the patient and in fact the most painful thing we can do for patients.  The lumbar puncture is actually a very well tolerated procedure, and it's unfortunate that it gets such a bad name.  It's important to administer a good amount of anesthetic, and since the back has less sensory nerves per square inch than most places in the body, the numbing agent doesn't cause too much pain.  I know some physicians who knock patients out to do these every single time, but I've only needed to do that for patients that are confused and combative.  I think as time goes on, more attention is being paid to these issues.  New numbing processes, more use of analgesics, and different ways of managing problems (I only give patients NG tubes if they are actively vomiting) are allowing for better patient comfort.    Thanks for the question!"

Urgent, sure, those can be done in a controlled environment like the operating room, but the patients receive numbing medications to help.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7fm7,trollfessor,2,Sun Jul 5 19:28:11 2015 UTC,"Probably because we need the patient's assistance in making sure the tube goes into the right place, and not into the lungs.  That being said, I have given small doses of benzos for patients requiring NGTs before, if they're very anxious.  The worst part is, that tube stays in for a while, and the versed wears off quickly."

She even talked to the doctor about it but no luck. It had to be in there in case I had complications. She apologized to me as she started the procedure. That soft flexible not-to-thick catheter felt like an aluminum pipe was being slowly shoved up my nose scraping the whole inside as it went.   But did it go straight down my throat...nooooo, it kept wanting to curl into my mouth causing me to gag. With tears running down my face, she re-inserted it and she kept apologizing and working at it until it was where it needed to be. Fun times."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c7fm7,my2penniesworth,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:39:49 2015 UTC,"the most painful procedures are incision and drainage of abscesses. The problem lies in the fact that the pH within an abscess cavity is low and (insert some stuff about pKa and pH that I forgot because med school was a very long time ago) as a result lidocaine and other numbing agents injected on top of or into an abscess are much less effective. Still, I often see patients who have had their abscesses injected and then practitioners have gone in, while the patient screams bloody murder.   Hey -- this happened to me!! When I was 16, I had a Pilonidal cyst. The doctor gave me 2 injections of local and I still felt everything. He got mad that I was reacting, and called me a baby.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3c68pc,SoYup,17,Sun Jul 5 05:43:24 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  I'd be happy to try to shed some light on your lab values.  Your white blood cell, as you've mentioned, is normal, which is an important thing by itself, but certainly, the differential (the percentage of types of WBCs) matters.  Your neutrophils are slightly high.  Neutrophils are the typical white blood cells that fight bacterial infections, but they can also go up during times of stress, or can just be elevated.  While your elevated neutrophil percentage may be slightly up because of an infection or inflammatory process, it may just be elevated for no reason (or obvious reason) at all.  We do see numbers like that often, in patients who do not have an acute process.  That being said, sometimes a slight increase can indicate something.  If you take your neutrophil count which is elevated at 83%, and subtract it from 100, you are left with 17% of the rest of your WBC's.  So already your MAXIMUM lymphocyte percentage is going to be below the normal range.  So the fact that it is low is probably a reflection of your neutrophil count being high.  But again, there's no way for me to know for sure.    Platelets are inflammatory phase reactants, so they go up with inflammation, but they can also just be high.  You're juuuuuuuuust out of normal range, making it more likely that this is normal, but still, there's a chance that something is causing it.  Was that a fasting blood test?  If so, your glucose is again JUUUUUUST out of range.  Still, having a hemoglobin A1c may be needed to ensure you don't have diabetes or glucose intolerance.  Your globulin count reflects the amount of antibodies in your system.  Again, this test can be elevated for no (obvious/diagnosable) reason at all, or it may be indicative of something serious.  Your A/G ratio is probably simply a byproduct of your globulins being high.    So in summary, all of the things you've listed are just baaaaarely out of range, which is somewhat comforting.  But at the same time, you have several that are out of range so that's slightly concerning as well.  You're describing Reynaud's phenomenon with your fingers, which can occur with or without rheumatic disease.  Given your constellation of symptoms and the lab results, your doctor will probably consider doing more tests for rheumatic conditions (like autoimmune processes) or hematologic problems (like bone marrow processes)... Or your doctor may just choose to keep an eye on things and repeat the labs because again, they're just barely out of range, and may even just reflect a passing illness.  Good luck to you, and I hope that helps."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c68pc,Smeeee,7,Sun Jul 5 12:28:55 2015 UTC,"That's also a pretty moderate vitamin D deficiency too, isn't it? It (I don't believe, please correct me if I'm wrong) isn't quite at critical low range, but it could also contribute to many of the symptoms.. Or be a symptom in of itself of an underlying condition?"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c68pc,AllRebelRocker,8,Sun Jul 5 12:39:59 2015 UTC,"Great thought.  Yes, he needs to get more D.  Sorry, reddit has ruined me and I'm post-overnight, so I have temporarily misplaced the frontal lobe of my brain.  Hypovitaminosis D can lead to some of the symptoms, as it has been tied to depression, but also leads to low calcium levels which can lead to a various number musculoskeletal complaints and symptoms.  Regarding the causes, assuming it's the 25-OH-vitamin D, you need exposure to sunlight and/or a decent amount of intake to have a good level.  Some gut absorption problems can decrease the vitamin D levels as a result.  So if there's an inflammatory process in the gut, that could potentially explain the levels, but at the same time this might also be a benign finding."

I have had swollen lymph nodes for a couple years as well, does that have something to do with neturophils and lymphocytes?"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c68pc,Darlingniki1,2,Sun Jul 5 19:44:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, some infections, especially viral infections like Epstein Barr Virus and even HIV can cause bigger lymph nodes, but typically these also increase the % of lymphocytes.    Other things like lymphoma can also skew your differential, while enlarging lymph nodes.  Other inflammatory processes can also do the same.  So while it does create more abnormalities, it doesn't narrow things down, unfortunately.  If one of those nodes can be biopsied, your doctor may end up considering that."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3c6dt4,GoddamnRelapse,3,Sun Jul 5 07:02:05 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  It is unlikely that you are suffering from a side effect of the medication, considering the position changed even before you took them.   With a change in position one of our biggest concerns would be what we call a ""bell-clapper"" deformity, which can allow the testicles to freely rotate (usually they are fixed in one place).  The big problem with having a bell-clapper deformity (which is bilateral  - that is, it affects both testicles - in 40% of cases) is that if the testicle twists too much you can develop testicular torsion, which means the testicle twists a few times, cutting off blood supply.    Obviously, however, I cannot say anything for certain without evaluating you myself, but given the potential severity of what's causing this, I would strongly suggest following your friend's suggestion of seeing a urologist.   Good luck."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c6dt4,Smeeee,2,Sun Jul 5 12:35:07 2015 UTC,"""bell-clapper"" deformity   Doesn't testicle torsion usually include severe pain? Both testicles still hang low. Would a picture help?"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3c6dt4,Smeeee,5,Sun Jul 5 15:53:18 2015 UTC,"No need for a picture.  If you're having an incomplete torsion, you might just notice a change in position with mild discomfort, and then it might just go back to normal.  Kind of like a warning sign before the real deal.  Again, I'm not saying that this is definitely what's happening but it would be the most concerning thing."

We definitely need ways to blow off steam as a result, and we all have different ways of doing that.   For me, it's humor. For others, it's partying. For a small minority it ends up unfortunately being drug use / alcohol.  But yes, we are otherwise ""normal"" people, and that's always good to keep in mind, especially if you have a fear of seeing a physician or find that you're intimidated by them.

In my early 20's, after I had my son, my physician was a gay male nurse practitioner. He was an AWESOME person and he never mentioned his sexuality to me, but you could tell... his mannerisms, the way he spoke, etcetera. Best physician I've ever had, hands down. Truly listened to me, often gave me the benefit of the doubt, and had a female nurse in the room anytime there had to be genital interactions, just for my own comfort (I didn't ask). I'd been seeing him for years and we had a great doctor/patient relationship. One night, I went to a gay bar with a bunch of my friends. The bar had two floors, and we'd spent our entire visit upstairs dancing and drinking, etc. After a few hours we decided to leave. As we were descending the steps, I saw my doctor and another man walking past the front of the stairs. He was hanging all over this other guy, kissing him on the neck and lips. It was sort of weird (kinda like seeing your teacher at the grocery store) and I was debating on whether or not to say hi as he seemed rather intoxicated and I didn't want to make anything awkward for him, but then he saw me first. He was so adorable with how apologetic yet drunk he was, I couldn't help but laugh. He gave me a hug and thanked me for not judging him. He continued to be my doctor for a year or two after that, but we never did mention the run-in at the club."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3bwxe4,notsowittyname86,5,Fri Jul 3 01:22:55 2015 UTC,"It sounds like mucous, but I would need more specifics. Our intestines are lined with mucous to help the poo slide through, sometimes our body makes too much, sometimes the bowels are inflamed, sometimes it happens with anxiety, sometimes it's just your intestines moving on an empty stomach, sometimes it's medications etc etc. It could be a lot of things. Does it happen often? In any case, it's probably nothing to worry about if it only happened once but if it's recurring, accompanied by blood, pain, or anything else that doesn't seem right then it wouldn't hurt to see the Dr sooner rather than later.

(I don't pick up or carry anything lover 10 lbs anymore, even if I feel good. That will set me back quickly! I also watch my posture. I don't sit on the floor and try to always have a supportive back rest wherever I sit. I have to put a pillow behind my back for many chairs, but I'm only 5'4"" and have short legs. Doesn't sound like you will have that issue.)  If I do start having pain, I slap a TENS unit on my lower back ASAP, lay on ice, and take a muscle relaxer for a day or two.   Also, I was told by a pain clinic to not expect to be pain free anymore. It was actually a little comforting to hear that because I'd been hurting for months while expecting to get better. As it turns out, I'm pain free the majority of the time, which is nice.  This works for me, YMMV. Good luck to you!"

AskDoctorSmeeee,3bwn3h,my2penniesworth,4,Thu Jul 2 21:26:18 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  Stretch marks are due to stretching of the skin, and don't really occur unless something has occurred to stretch the skin (weight gain, pregnancy, etc).  As a result, typically that comes from gaining weight, but I guess in theory if muscle is replaced by fat you can stay the same weight but gain volume and stretch the skin (since fat is lighter than muscle)....  Here is some more information about stretch marks: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003287.htm  Regarding the question in your title, I cannot answer that (please see question 3) as it constitutes medical advice.

It can easily be changed to ""there's a study for that!""  These two papers discuss cross-reactivity between sertraline (zoloft) and paxil (paroxetine)  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2907008/  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11918512  The TL;DR of these studies and others are that SSRI allergies (specifically paroxetine and sertraline) are rare, and they are structurally pretty different from each other, which minimizes the likelihood of a cross-reaction (having an allergy to one because you're allergic to the other).  However, there is a small chance of cross-reactivity.  So there's still a chance you might be allergic to Zoloft, so keep a close eye on things.  I wish you the best of luck!"

I was taking Benadryl and using hydrocortisone cream and the itching was driving me mad!! The rash is pretty much gone now just a small spot left, but I think it's because it's right where my bra sits. Maybe it was the dye they used in the generic form but I'm never going to take Paxil again that's for sure!

The fragment is at the distal end of the rib (most anterior) and is displaced laterally.  No other bony abnormalities are visible on the views presented.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3btln5,flexorhallucis,29,Fri Jul 3 09:23:00 2015 UTC,"Mmkay, a bit of background for this first.  Some rib fractures can be tricky to diagnose, even with x-ray imaging.  From a purely clinical perspective, for mildly fractured ribs (i.e. hairline fractures or stress fractures), sometimes imaging isn't undertaken as a presumptive diagnosis can be made from the history and examination.  If there was concern about a seriously broken rib, x-ray would show up bony defects but is less useful for cartilage, and CT is expensive and uses lots of radiation so is avoided unless there's a clinical need for it.  In this case I feel that the further investigations were entirely warranted, as the injury was caused by trauma and presumably initial x-rays showed a distinct break (there's a small risk of complications such as bleeding, puncturing of a lung or further damage, so it's important to exclude these)  Without the imaging, if you just looked at the patient and saw a big bruise on his flank and were told he's been kicked, had a feel and felt some swelling and the patient complaining of pain, it could be hard to call.  With the CT, there's no doubt at all.  Hope this explains a bit; sorry if it sounds a bit wishy-washy, but the diagnosis can be too haha"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3btln5,Stillnotathrowaway,2,Thu Jul 2 18:06:51 2015 UTC,"Also, his first visit at the hospital probably used plain old x ray. Rib fractures can be very hard to see the first day of the injury with that technique. Sometimes a re x ray 2 weeks from trauma will then show the fracture.  Ribs are nowhere near as dense as the vertebrae in the same film. Because of the density of the body in the films, ribs will show up more faintly with normal techniques. Tthe floating ribs are even less dense and the tip of the rib more so.   The MRI image that has been circulating shows lots of fluid in the area of the bone and I believe that image is what lead the UFC doctors to believe it is a bruise. However, CT is the mode of choice for fracture and I believe that highly life like looking picture we've been seeing is a 3d CT reconstruct."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3btln5,DrManMilk,3,Thu Jul 2 18:22:08 2015 UTC,Industrial radiographer here - do those of you in the medical field adjust voltage when trying to image more/less dense bone?
AskDoctorSmeeee,3btln5,Stillnotathrowaway,4,Thu Jul 2 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"Gosh. I haven't shot my own films in years (I'm a chiropractor, reddit doesn't like me). I've lost some of my knowledge there.  If I remember right you do cut the voltage. If you're being picky you reshoot the films with different parameters if you don't like how things turned out. In clinic settings the art and pickiness of x ray sometimes gets lost with the technicians. I had a patient that was way north of 400 lbs and an old school plain film unit. I think with the machine maxed during a lateral lumbar out we still had a 3 second long shot.   In aldo's case they could also collimate and do a spot of just that area, it reduces the exposure."

The books say 3-6 weeks for the pain to reduce and normal function after that, but this is a bigger break in an awkward place, so take that as you will. The main goals of treatment are adequate pain control, partly because otherwise it's absolutely miserable until it heals, and partly because people change their breathing patterns because of the pain which can cause complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia. As for when he'll be fit to return to training and competition, that's a decision for a doctor skilled in sports medicine to decide!"

If he gets hit in the area again which any opponent would take advantage of (right?) the risk is the fragment can break off and cut nearby organs such as the spleen or lungs resulting in internal bleeding (spleen) or collapsed lung.

Fuuuuuck wearing that stretchy velcro thing, too.. that shit hurt worse than the actual breaking!   I suppose it worked though, I don't have deformed ribs or anything, so yeah.  Aldo's injury doesn't look nearly as nasty as mine was.. I broke one of the big ones higher up and more on my back/side, and it was very sharp/pointy looking in the scan.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3bupdo,Smeeee,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:56:46 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  I typically do not use ciprofloxacin for otitis media (middle ear infection), but I will use ciprofloxacin drops for outer ear infections (otitis externa).  In general, cipro treats a wide spectrum of bacteria, but as far as its activity against the typical bacteria which cause otitis media, it's not great.  The newer fluoroquinolones (the ""floxacin"" group), including gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin have better effects for otitis media, but I still avoid those as first line agents.  In general, you want coverage for the bacteria that colonize the mouth, nasal cavities, and throat, so typically some sort of penicillin (like amoxicillin, Augmentin [amoxicillin + clavulanic acid]) or azithromycin (Z-pack) are prescribed first.

Did some searching and here's an article from the American Sleep Apnea Association re: home studies. The article also says:   A positive diagnosis is established if: The apnea-hypopnea index as measured by the portable device is 15 or more (15 apneas or hypopneas an hour) or the AHI is between 5 and 14 and the patient has documented symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood disorders, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or history of stroke.   Do you know your readings?  EDIT: Here's a short article on sleep study results.  EDIT 2: I did some more digging and found this in another article but it doesn't list a source for this quote:     When it comes to diagnosing sleep disorders, an in-lab sleep study is by far the most accurate of the two tests. Even when it comes to obstructive sleep apnea, a PSG is much more likely to give the best results. This is because of the added monitoring devices that measure brain and eye activity that helps tell a RPSGT exactly when the patient is sleeping, and what stage of sleep they are in. In an in-lab sleep study, only data recorded during actual sleep is scored, making diagnosing a sleep disorder far more accurate. In comparison, a HST study is scored from beginning to end which is why sleep apnea is often under-diagnosed because it is also recording one's breathing while they are awake, which is when they are less likely to suffer any apnea events.   So, it's saying that HST (home sleep study) tend to under-diagnose the degree of someone's sleep apnea since it includes the time the person is just breathing while not necessarily being asleep.   What was the time frame between the last in-lab study and the home study?"

B: did you get cleared for exercise?  Now, hypothetically, if you were cleared for exercise by your doc, I would suggest exercising really at any time. These drugs cause havoc with a lot of different systems, and anything you can do to keep those cortisol levels under control the better.   You also need to really watch the total kcals you take in, because many people gain weight quickly on these drugs. Don't go extremely low or anything, just don't be hitting the burgers and fries.   As with many things, there are a million variables, but if you normally train in the AM, then keep training in the AM. If you find that doesn't ""feel good"" or ""right"" to you (as you know your body best), try a different time, perhaps at the opposite end of the day.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3bm8rq,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:50:48 2015 UTC,"Demyelinating disease:       A demyelinating disease is any disease of the nervous system in which the myelin sheath of neurons is damaged.  This damage impairs the conduction of signals in the affected nerves. In turn, the reduction in conduction ability causes deficiency in sensation, movement, cognition, or other functions depending on which nerves are involved.  Some demyelinating diseases are caused by genetics, some by infectious agents, some by autoimmune reactions, and some by unknown factors. Organophosphates, a class of chemicals which are the active ingredients in commercial insecticides such as sheep dip, weed-killers, and flea treatment preparations for pets, etc., will also demyelinate nerves. Neuroleptics can also cause demyelination.  Lysophosphatidylcholine causes demyelination and is in unnaturally high amounts in foods with lecithin treated with the enzyme phospholipase (enzyme-modified foods) and as lysolecithin in products such as make up and personal care products. (See lysophosphatidylcholine.)  Demyelinating diseases are traditionally classified in two kinds: demyelinating myelinoclastic diseases and demyelinating leukodystrophic diseases. In the first group a normal and healthy myelin is destroyed by a toxic, chemical or autoimmune substance. In the second group, myelin is abnormal and degenerates.   The second group was denominated dysmyelinating diseases by Poser     Image i     Relevant: Hereditary CNS demyelinating disease | CNS demyelinating autoimmune diseases | Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts | Encephalomyelitis   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3bm0qr,jimmytrue,3,Tue Jun 30 12:34:19 2015 UTC,"Removing spermatoceles requires surgery and like all surgery this comes with a risk. It's always a matter of it being a calculated risk.  One of the many upsides of having external genitalia is that it makes surgery much easier and it reduces the risk. Also removing a spermatocele (or two) is a minor procedure, so that's an added benefit.  I'm sorry to hear that the ultrasound was scary. It's a tricky line to walk between being professional and being cold, and often ultrasounds in these areas can be handled in a more... clinical manner. Did they explain what was going to happen? Was it difficult because it was embarrassing? Was it that you were you afraid that they were going to find something serious?  At ant rate, the real questions are:  Do the spermatoceles cause you pain? Is it significant?  Do they cause you distress? Is it significant enough to effect your quality of life?  Are they enlarging?  If you are in a significant category or they are enlarging then the next question is:  How significant is the risk? (but only a doctor who you see will be able to answer this question, though it's definitely a good one to ask)   Some parting thoughts. Removing a spermatocele doesn't guarantee that it will resolve the associated pain. If you don't have your ultrasounds or a way to access them then you might need to have another ultrasound, which may have an impact on you. If having an ultrasound was hard for you, it's important to realize that as the surgery will be much more involved than an ultrasound and so it will likely be more difficult, especially given that they will prefer to use a local anesthetic if possible (which again is about reducing the risk)."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3bic72,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:10:45 2015 UTC,"Reactive hypoglycemia:       Reactive hypoglycemia, or postprandial hypoglycemia, is a medical term describing recurrent episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia occurring within 4 hours  after a high carbohydrate meal in people who do not have diabetes.  It is thought to represent a consequence of excessive insulin release triggered by the carbohydrate meal but continuing past the digestion and disposal of the glucose derived from the meal.  The prevalence of this condition is difficult to ascertain because a number of stricter or looser definitions have been used. It is recommended that the term reactive hypoglycemia be reserved for the pattern of postprandial hypoglycemia which meets the Whipple criteria (symptoms correspond to measurably low glucose and are relieved by raising the glucose), and that the term idiopathic postprandial syndrome be used for similar patterns of symptoms where abnormally low glucose levels at the time of symptoms cannot be documented.  To assist diagnosis, a doctor can order an HbA1c test, which measures the blood sugar average over the two or three months before the test. The more specific 6-hour glucose tolerance test can be used to chart changes in the patient's blood sugar levels before ingestion of a special glucose drink and at regular intervals during the six hours following to see if an unusual rise or drop in blood glucose levels occurs.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3biogv,Missholly418,6,Mon Jun 29 15:26:28 2015 UTC,"My question would be, what did the X-ray show? Did it confirm pneumonia? This can be a soft call based on history alone. See if a radiologist read the X-ray and did it actually show pneumonia. I have seen many people who have been ""diagnosed"" with pneumonia only to have a clear chest X-ray. Is is acceptable medical practice to observe an ""upper respiratory infection"" (which is a general term that means, loosely, ""a cold"") without treatment for 2 weeks. So my advice would be don't assume that the second provider got it right, and that he first was wrong. The normal course of viral bronchitis can be to last several weeks with intense coughing and the other symptoms you mentioned, and antibiotics are not indicated for this."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3biogv,jimmytrue,2,Mon Jun 29 19:39:46 2015 UTC,The chest x Ray did confirm pneumonia by the x Ray tech and then the doctor. The first doctor is also someone who prescribed my husband an anti depressant for adhd.

In either case, it is impossible to know if you had pneumonia at the time you saw the previous provider.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3befkp,dopeymouse05,2,Sun Jun 28 13:34:29 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking keeping to a strict schedule helps with sleep problems. Specifically for overnight shifts you should try not to let ""daytime life"" influence you too much. It's your sleeping time, no matter what other people might wanna do (I realise that is pretty hard, after all life mostly happens during the days).   The problem with shift work is that your body is trained to a certain rhythm and uses external zeitgeber (yes, it's a German word, dont ask me why it's used in English) to reset it's internal clocks.   If you happen to be on a different schedule than everybody else but your body still receives these external clues (most importantly sunlight but also artificial things such as breakfast/dinner times etc) it will not change the clock. That results in you being in ""sleep mode"" while working and not being able to sleep afterwards because your body thinks it's day (it is after all).   There's only so much you can do to adjust your internal clock unfortunately but a few things might help. As I said, external zeitgeber that reset you for a normal day/night-rhythm are bad. Most importantly sunlight, so try to get thick curtains. Stick to a regular schedule, eating habits are another strong zeitgeber. Try not to swap too much between normal/night-shifts as your body takes some time to adjust and frequent swaps disrupt this.   I hope that helps a little bit. I'm no expert on the topic though, just did a small presentation on circadian rhythms a while back."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3befkp,exikon,2,Sun Jun 28 15:56:19 2015 UTC,"Blackout curtains are rather expensive. Tinfoil and duct tape will let you experiment.   Fixate your sleep schedule. Try to get however many hours you need at the same time every day.   Your mileage may vary, but I found it beneficial to be awake during the brightest daylight hours and sleep before work otherwise, If you're at a high latitude,  you may end up in darkness all day long during the winter. Being in well lit areas when you intend to be awake and dark and warm places when you need to sleep will help.     If you have external noises keeping you up, use a fan, or white noise generator. If you're having problems waking up try keeping yourself in very bright light for a bit when you're trying to wake up."

After your shifts make sleep a priority - it's too easy to stay up and think you can get things done, and then realize too late that you didn't leave enough time to sleep. Blackout curtains help a lot, make your bedroom completely dark. I find sublingual melatonin to be helpful as well, both when switching to nights and when returning to days."

If you do not have a regular doctor or they cannot get you in, then go to urgent care. It will be a simple procedure.  If there are any signs the infection gets worse- it grows, it becomes red and inflamed, the margins grow, any sort of puss or bad smell is present, etc.- then you need to see a doctor immediately.  You will also likely need a tetanus booster if you have not received one in the previous ten years or whatever the current standard is.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3bb637,herdofcorgis,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"Ultrasound will just require CT or MRI for further diagnostic imaging.

I've gotten into one myself, 8 months pregnant (I'm 5'4""), and fit with my arms to my sides without touching the walls (and I wasn't a waif before pregnancy).    You can try an MRI with conscious sedation (we use fenanyl & versed), but you will need to follow breathing instructions for an MRI of your liver.  The drug combo is commonly called ""liquid twilight"" and is used for procedures like colonoscopies and wisdom teeth extraction.  You will still be awake, though not super aware of your surroundings or how much time has passed.

There also was some discussion about a general anesthesia but that option was also not available. That lead me to my 20-hour internet search (only a slight exaggeration) on open-sided MRI's. I wonder if it wouldn't be worth a shot to try to get a clear image of my liver because I really don't think I would be able to go back into the open MRI tube and I am very hesitant to get another CT.

She had filled a prescription for narcotics two days prior and had denied it.  I bit my tongue and just said ""ok"" to her, but god dammit I was filled with rage.  And I couldn't let that rage stay inside.  I've grown up in this country, just like she has.  I put decades  into my education and training to take care of people.  This is NOT what I signed up for.  Not only that, but I spoke better English than she did.  But at the same time, I am a professional, and I would not allow myself to break in front of a patient.  But I had to break at some point.  So I let her walk out and filled with rage and anger and sadness, on the verge of tears, I laughed.  I laughed and told her nurse about it.  I probably used some choice words, but I cannot remember them.  I kept my discussion quiet with her.  But I came home and told my wife, because I was still filled with that anger and sadness and disappointment... and fear.  I fear the people who say things like that because hate crimes still happen.  And I fear being a victim of one some day.  So yes, I have found myself saying things maliciously about patients.  And if I was recorded in some situations, I'd probably owe someone $500k in court as well.  But I hope you guys can see where I might be coming from with some of those comments.  A juror might not - in fact, it might be irrelevant - because we are professionals, and we are held to a high standard.    So back to this case - I don't know the facts because I don't know what this guy said or did before this case.  I don't condone what was said, but I see how it can happen.  If a patient told me he passed out when IVs were placed (as in this case) and he looked at me placing the IV, I could easily have said ""then just don't look at the IV, you dingaling."" I don't use the word retard, but otherwise the sentiment would have been the same as this anesthesiologists.    There was some discussion in that /r/medicine thread about being made fun of, and fearing that as a patient.  I can't speak for all of us, but I never do that.  If you have an embarrassing condition, only your treatment team will and should know about it.  I keep those things private, it's a basic tenet of HIPAA - so it's not only morally right, but legally right, to keep it private.    But if you're being a jerk, your degree of jerkness has a good chance of making it to my conversations at dinner parties and possibly even this subreddit.  (although again, your identity will be protected)  So in conclusion, I don't know the details, I understand some of the sentiments, but I don't condone some of the things that were said, and I have no idea what was going on with saying the patient had hemorrhoids when he didn't.  That's beyond my scope of understanding, but there might be some explanation, considering the GI doc was dropped from the suit.  That was a lot of words I just typed and I'm not sure any of it makes sense."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3b3n8d,Smeeee,9,Thu Jun 25 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"Man you really hit the nail on the head here. I haven't followed this case, but I get my fair share of ""difficult"" customers in retail. It's amazing how people can treat another person, especially a person making sure their medicine isn't going to kill them.  I can't count the number of times I've told a patient that I need to speak with their doctor to make sure something about the rx was right and had them say, ""Can't you just give me my meds?"" It always amazes me. I guess if you want this dose that's twice the normal dose, or this drug that you're allergic to (that I'm sure you didn't tell the doc about), or this drug that will literally do absolutely nothing for a UTI, or if you want me to just randomly guess what the hell this says on the script (my personal favorite). Usually I just hand the script to them for the last one and see if they can read it.   I love my docs and respect the hell out of them, but they're not infallible. That's what we're here for. When we get crap for taking longer than McDonald's (actually been said to me before), I die a little inside. These are the kind of people we complain about. Never where anyone else can hear, but stuff gets said and it's usually not super nice. It is really cathartic.   Now I'm rambling and not going anywhere in particular, so I'll stop. Essentially, people just need to not be assholes to each other and this would all be a lot easier. Good question though!"

AskDoctorSmeeee,3b3n8d,-chickadee-,3,Thu Jun 25 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your perspective. I appreciate the reminder that doctors experience the range of human goodness and snarkiness just like everyone else.  What are your thoughts about the doctor falsifying medical records and about the discussion related to avoiding the patient in the future?  From a patient perspective, it would be scary for me to realize that a person who is in charge of administering anesthetic was harboring such animosity towards me when I was totally vulnerable.   The anesthesiologist seems to actively prevent the patient from receiving proper care by lying on the chart and by suggesting unethical ways the other doctor can avoid talking to his patient after the procedure. How do you interpret these actions in particular?"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3b3n8d,Smeeee,2,Thu Jun 25 23:43:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't really understand the bit in the recording about falsifying info, with the hemorrhoids... I don't know if they saw something suspicious that reflected a hemorrhoid, but didn't see a hemorrhoid itself, or what. The GI doc was dropped from the suit, so I assume there was some sort of explanation. Falsifying medical records is a much bigger crime than making fun of a patient, so I assume there had to be an explanation.  But my thoughts on falsifying records is that it's bad and should not be done. I think almost all doctors feel the same. (I know there are some that take advantage of the system by believing differently).  I would be worried too, if I knew there was animosity. In fact, that's why I discourage people from having their doctor be a family friend or something, because you never want personal feelings (good or bad) potentially biasing your doctor.  However, I'm just guessing, and again I don't know the facts, that the doctor was annoyed by the patient but didn't feel like they deserved less care. We all take the Hippocratic oath, and almost all of us adhere to it. (I never speak in absolutes - except for this sentence)  The final bit about avoiding the patient is something I can empathize with as well. I've had patients with whom I've had an argument (read: who've gotten upset at me because I haven't given them what they want, after a prolonged discussion) and I've wanted to avoid them for the rest of my shift because you know they're going to try to break you down. I give them proper medical care, though, but at the end, if I can avoid them, I do. Except for the final encounter, where I tie the visit together.  But I understand the feeling.   It really makes me wonder about the interaction they had with this guy. But I will try not to make assumptions on anyone's part."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3b3n8d,lornad,3,Thu Jun 25 23:56:17 2015 UTC,"And just because they are joking about sending the MA to do discharge teaching instead of the MD, doesn't meant that that is what actually happened.  I recently had a difficult patient on my floor, and I joked with my CNA that it was ""their turn"" and that I would hand them the narcotics and they could take them in and give them.  Of course I didn't do that.  That would have been unethical.  But I did wish I could avoid this patient for 30 minutes.  If someone recorded my comment and played it out of context, it could have been grounds for a suit."

Here is an anatomical depiction of the number of muscles  Alternatively, you may have something irritating your nerves, as the C2 nerve supplies that area of the skull.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3ayyqn,FreakJoe,8,Wed Jun 24 17:00:51 2015 UTC,"There have been a few large studies with very different results. The American cancer society breaks it down like this:  Factors with uncertain or unproven effects on lung cancer risk  Marijuana smoke  There are some reasons to think that marijuana smoking might increase lung cancer risk. Marijuana smoke contains tar and many of same the cancer-causing substances that are in tobacco smoke. (Tar is the sticky, solid material that remains after burning, which is thought to contain most of the harmful substances in smoke.) Marijuana cigarettes (joints) are typically smoked all the way to the end, where tar content is the highest. Marijuana is also inhaled very deeply and the smoke is held in the lungs for a long time, which gives any cancer causing substances more opportunity to deposit in the lungs. And because marijuana is often an illegal substance, it may not be possible to control what other substances it might contain.  But those who use marijuana tend to smoke fewer marijuana cigarettes in a day or week than the amount of tobacco consumed by cigarette smokers. For example, a light smoker may smoke half of a pack (10 cigarettes) a day, but 10 marijuana cigarettes in a day would be very heavy use of marijuana. In one study, most people who smoked marijuana did so 2 to 3 times per month. The lesser amount smoked would make it harder to see an impact on lung cancer risk.  It has been hard to study whether there is a link between marijuana and lung cancer because marijuana was illegal in many countries for so long and it is not easy to gather information about the use of illegal drugs. Also, in the studies that looked at past marijuana use in people who had lung cancer, most of the marijuana smokers also smoked cigarettes. This can make it hard to know how much of the risk is from tobacco and how much might be from marijuana. More research is needed to know the cancer risks from smoking marijuana.  Edit: As for the studies:  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.29036/abstract ""Results from our pooled analyses provide little evidence for an increased risk of lung cancer among habitual or long-term cannabis smokers, although the possibility of potential adverse effect for heavy consumption cannot be excluded.""  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2516340/ ""The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking.""  There are of course many more studies on the subject."

I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure there is no literature showing a causal relationship with eating marijuana and cancer.  However, there's plenty of research showing that even non-smoked (like chewing) tobacco causes cancer.  If you want to talk about smoking things causing cancer... Yeah, I'm pretty sure if I grabbed a random handful of sticks and grass clippings from my back yard and burned them and inhaled them it would produce tar, which in large quantities, and frequent use, is probably going to cause cancer."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3ayyqn,Jackolysis,-4,Wed Jun 24 23:50:20 2015 UTC,"Edit. Guess that subculture found me. Can't stand to read the truth of what marijuana does to the brain? Carry on with the downvotes!  Not a doctor.  I had only one friend ever ask me why I am anti-marijuana (personally). Here's why.   Marijuana is linked to anxiety and mood disorders, even at low, or casual, doses. I already have anxiety issues, I don't need more.   Metabolic rates for THC are extremely variable from person to person. I was hoping for a more solid source than this.  I like to plan my day and being trapped at the house for an indeterminate amount of time doesn't sound like fun, to me anyway.  If you're a teenager, you're stunting your brain at a key developmental stage. Not to mention, the brain finally stops developing around age 25.  And then the worst side effect of all? You might slip into that weed subculture. Yikes.    Edit: Sorry I forgot you wanted it compared to tobacco use.  Nicotine causes the release of adrenaline which raises heart rate and blood pressure.   Nicotine also stimulates the brain's glutamate, enhancing short-term memory, and of course, tons of endorphins.   Nicotine can change the brain's reward system even after just one low dose, one-time exposure.  Basically nicotine is extremely addictive. Regardless of its vehicle. So despite the cancer risk of smoking either weed or tobacco, you're still left with a good chance that nicotine alone can cause blood clots."

You may also be getting downvoted because you seem to have misunderstood your first source (which actually is a prime source, so that's good at least). Your first link does not make claims that marijuana use causes AMD, only that it is more frequent in users. There are many different reasons that this could be true, including people using marijuana to cope with anxiety (I.e. people who already have AMD seeking marijuana) among many others.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3ay23z,orangeisgood,3,Thu Jun 25 12:44:51 2015 UTC,"I had one 6 weeks ago.  I did a lot of research before hand - probably too much since it made me very worried and anxious over having this elective procedure.  If you know it's something you want to do, I would recommend looking into having an open-ended vasectomy.  There are a number of studies showing that it will decrease the risk of long-term / chronic pain following a vasectomy.   (See # 4 below).  The American Urological Association includes open ended vasectomies as one of the three approved methods of vas occlusion so long as it involved fascial interposition.  (#1 below).  The incidence of long-term pain is reported as high as 33 percent (#2 below) although at that level it's not something that is disruptive.  However, some studies have the incidence of chronic, life impacting pain from a vasectomy as high as 10 percent (Id.) The open ended vasectomy seems to reduce those rates.    In hindsight, I'm not all that certain that a vasectomy was the best decision for me.  However, that's because I was really on the fence before having it.  If you're comfortable with the decision, then you probably won't have much regret.  It seems that most people who independently choose to have it (i.e. no pressure from spouse and are certain about sterilization) are very happy with the decision.  Look at the childfree and askmen sub and you'll see a ton of success stories.    Anyway, here are some helpful links: 1) American Urologist Association Report:  https://www.auanet.org/education/guidelines/vasectomy.cfm 2) Article about incidence of pain following vasectomy:  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.07602.x/pdf 3) Article discussing post vasectomy pain syndrome and the impact of a closed ended / standard vasectomy on the anatomy (very informative but it can be a scary read, keep in mind these are very acute changes and most likely won't be noticeable): http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1939-4640.2003.tb02675.x/full 4) An article discussing open-ended vasectomies as the ideal technique:  http://www.jabfm.org/content/7/4/285.full.pdf"

If not, then I can see why the doc wouldn't want to order any sleeping meds. However, if you are losing sleep and do experience some of the anxiety there might be something he could order that won't leave you groggy.  From my personal experience, I developed an anxiety disorder/PTSD after being in a 10 day coma that left me absolutely dependent on others for everything. This made me feel very helpless and anxious.  I couldn't understand my symptoms and it wasn't until I got to a rehab center that they brought in a psychiatrist who diagnosed me and put me on Remeron at bedtime. The first night I took it was the first time in 5 weeks that I slept soundly with no anxiety. It was a miracle drug for me.   I stayed on it a while until I read that it can cause weight gain. That was OK after the coma b/c I had lost pounds but I didn't want to keep gaining so weaned off of it.   It wouldn't hurt to ask him if you could try it for a month to see if it helps (unless your are already taking something that might interact with it).

I asked him for something to slow it down for a while (or make me sleepy enough to cancel out my mind racing so fast) because I feel like I don't actually get much rest when I am asleep when this shit goes on.  Like, I might be physically asleep but I'll wake up feeling exhausted because I haven't actually gotten rest.    My GP is letting me try Oxazepam again for a while (it helped me through some severe anxiety a few years ago) but I don't want to grow dependent on it.  I'm not sure if Remeron can interact with the other meds I take but I can always ask my psychiatrist when I see him.  Prozac was a massive fail.  All it did was remove what little filter I had between brain and mouth and I got into so much trouble at work."

Not only pain but other sensitivities, noise, burning-itching skin, sharp stabbing pains, sore mouth, etc... I recently had an elective surgery  (lots of thought went into this decision) out of town and had quite a talk with the anesthetist about pain control. On discussing my symptoms he recommended I try Robitussin Dry Cough Forte. It must be it's exact one as the others do not have the ingredient. 10mls twice a day for a week, then 10mls once a day in the evening. If working then after 2-3 weeks from start cut down to 5mls. Pain is an output from the brain and this works on the brain and spinal cord at a genetic level. It doesn't work for everyone. I am amazed at how much better I feel, my sensitivities have reduced and my activity increased somewhat. If I over do it I get all the symptoms without the over the top pain. I  finished the month about 4 weeks ago and am still not gobbling through the painkillers - I'm not taking any unless I know I'm going to do something that will cause a boom & bust... but these times are usually well worth it.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aw06k,shhnobodyknows,6,Tue Jun 23 23:14:03 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  For the last several years, ""staph"" infections have been all the rage in the media and it's gotten a lot of attention.  So I thought it would be best to clear some things up.  Before I go on though, /u/shhnobodyknows, were any cultures ever done on the infection?  Staph is the name of a bacterium that is pretty ubiquitous.  The full name is staphylococcus (but it can be abbreviated by ""S."") and there are many types, including S. epidermidis (which colonizes the skin and is part of the ""normal flora"") and S. saprophyticus which can cause urinary tract infections.  However, the one that gets all the hype is S. aureus, which also lives on the skin, but is less common than S.epi but is more invasive - i.e., it can cause skin infections much more often than S. epi.  Typically, S. aureus will cause ""purulent"" infections (we avoid calling things ""pus-y"" for obvious reasons) - infections like abscesses or wounds that drain pus. Typically, they need a wound to enter first, but staph aureus can sometimes just invade the skin on its own.  What's really getting a lot of attention is MRSA - methicillin resistant S. Aureus - which is a resistant strain of the aforementioned bacterium.  It's a nasty critter, that sometimes only response well to IV antibiotics.  Luckily in the US, we haven't yet encountered a MRSA that is resistant to all IV antibiotics yet.  Most of the time, though, MRSA can still be treated with oral antibiotics.  But again, S. aureus is a common thing that lives on the skin, and now community-acquired MRSA is so prevalent, that we just assume that any purulent infection of the skin is MRSA until proven otherwise.  Simple cellulitis (reddened infection of the skin) can be due to Strep or Staph or other things, but when we see pus, it's likely MRSA.  Okay, now, back to your question then.  There is a very high likelihood that your 4 year old has and HAS HAD staph on his/her skin for a very long time, so as far as thinking the 16 year old has some life-threatening contagion, I would rest assured.  The staph (or whatever bacterium it was that took advantage of that barnacle wound) found the perfect place to set up shop.  But it was probably already on her skin.  The only other possibility was if she contracted something from the barnacle itself, like Vibrio for example.    That being said, like /u/J0HNN0 has mentioned, keeping it covered should be more than enough.  However, good hand hygiene is always encouraged, so have them wash their hands after being in contact with each other.  And if there are any signs of infection (redness, purulent drainage) get it checked out."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aw06k,totallyalive,3,Wed Jun 24 12:46:54 2015 UTC,Thanks Doc!  I was feeling so bad for feeling skeeved out when she sat on my couch lol.  The fall off the dock was about 2 months ago and the knee injury developed first it was purulent as you mentioned then developed a white ring around the wound which is when I told my Aunt to take her to the doctor.  The first doctor said it was staph took a culture and gave her antibiotics.  After the first course still wasnt healed she went back to the family practice and was seen by a different doctor who said it was not staph and gave her another round of different antibiotics.  Sometime in between then she developed the 4 pimple like blisters on her upper right shoulder on her back which were also purulent.  Yesterday she went back to the doctor saw the original doctor and got her test results was told her knee is drying out and will scar 2 of the 4 areas on her back were dried up and 2 more were still able to be cultured.  They took another culture and gave her a cream to put on them.  2 more questions - is it safe for her to swim in our pool?  Thanks again im 30 weeks pregnant and my 4yr old loves his cousin and climbing on her so this puts my mind at ease a bit.  Is him being over at their house safe too?  Edit:  dr told her it was MRSA
AskDoctorSmeeee,3aw06k,J0HNN0,2,Wed Jun 24 14:19:15 2015 UTC,As long as the wounds are covered it should be OK.  We all have staph on our skin and particularly our nose.  Source; have had cluster staph infections. I had them in runs of 4 to 6 every 2 or 3 months for around 3 years and no one ever caught the infection. Edit: Mine was cultured and it was S. Aureus
AskDoctorSmeeee,3ayiod,matt_452,2,Wed Jun 24 15:04:12 2015 UTC,"Just had this done to both legs two weeks ago. Same test was done to my left arm about 3 years ago. No questions to answer except for making sure they are testing the arm that is causing you the trouble. Doctor sticks a few pads on different spots, touches the spots with electrical probes and reads the reaction. Feels a bit like touching a battery. Best I can give you is like in Biology class when they had you use a battery on frog legs to see them jump. In this case though he tests different nerves to see if the correct muscles react. If they do and readings are good, (correct low voltage gets a reaction), then pain you are feeling is due to something causing pain and not messed up nerve bundle. In my cases the tests showed nerves okay and more testing revealed blood flow issues causing the pain. Hope this helps. tl/dr: quick easy pain free way to see if pain is from messed up nerves or need to do more check ups."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3awpsr,J0HNN0,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:48:34 2015 UTC,"When our boy first went to daycare and had bottles for mid morning and afternoon naptime, he went in with two bottles a well as a container with pre measured portions of formula. The bottles were rinsed at daycare and sent home to be cleaned and sterilized.  This way there was no hassle of worrying whom had clean bottles or not as long as you did a decent job of being a parent.  Maybe take this kind of approach if you don't feel it's quite necessary to swap centres.  Oh and the first year of daycare our boy got so many chest and nose infections it was stupid, those places are germ factories as everyone is reliant on everyone else to keeping such kids away. Unfortunately they (like adults) are often contagious before symptoms are shown."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3awpsr,smoike,5,Sat Jun 27 02:49:16 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  While the mold isn't the DIRECT cause of the infection, molds can cause inflammation in the airways which can indirectly lead to infection.  My question is, like /u/J0HNN0 has alluded to - where else is the mold, and what else is going on there?  If there is mold in the bottle, then there is probably mold in the air.    Because it can cause inflammation of the airways, then that could potentially block proper drainage, which can potentially lead to ear infections. I'm not saying that's definitely the cause, but I think it would be worth some investigation into the sanitary habits of the daycare, and possibly even an inspection."

Any changes in color showing increased bruising. Basically if it starts to get worse in any way shape or form it is time for the ER. Don't play around it can become a very serious condition.
AskDoctorSmeeee,3as46h,Smeeee,11,Tue Jun 23 04:54:14 2015 UTC,"Hi there. The spectrum of scrotal and testicular trauma is pretty broad.  It can range from a mild contusion of the scrotal skin, to something like testicular rupture, where your testicle pretty much explodes.  Because of swelling, telling these apart is very tough to do clinically, and an ultrasound is often needed.  Time is of the essence with any sort of trauma, especially scrotal trauma, and repair with preserved function is possible with testicular rupture, although any delays can impair the likelihood of preservation.    I can't tell you if you should or shouldn't be seen (see rule 3) but hopefully that gives you an idea of how serious scrotal trauma can be.   Good luck"

It's important to quantify the severity of allergic reactions, and a lot of people who say they're allergic to penicillins aren't!  If she reacts seriously, then naturally penicillins and, if exceptionally severe, the whole beta lactam class should be avoided.  Regarding clindamycin, it has a nasty habit of causing pseudomembranous colitis and C. difficile infections; other antibiotics have a risk of this too, but clindamycin is the unfortunate poster child for this particular adverse effect.  That might be behind the reasoning for switching drugs.  Also, protocols generally try and wean people off IV antibiotics to oral preparations when possible.  If you have questions, do ask her doctor; make him explain why he's doing what he's doing, it'll be reassuring for you and your grandmother too.  If she has had a serious past reaction to penicillins, raise that sooner rather than later!"

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aqw0a,FreakJoe,3,Wed Jun 24 18:10:48 2015 UTC,"Basically, oral antibiotics mean patients can get out of hospital earlier, as they can administer their own medicines and be returned to community care under their GP. This saves money (looooots of money), decreases risk for patients, and frees up beds. IV infusions ironically come with a risk of infection, especially if the patient has a central line or similar invasive access, which if you're in hospital will likely be some horrible multi-drug-resistant hospital acquired infection. Our research has shown that weaning suitable (ie more stable patients, who can swallow) to oral therapy actually improves outcomes versus keeping everybody cooped up on IV abx. Our trust also has a ""hospital at home"" service, where suitable patients requiring long-term antibiotic therapy can receive treatment at home via daily district nurse visits, which keeps them out of hospital, makes for happy patients, and saves a huge amount of money. Obviously if a patient has a clinical need for IV therapy, they'll get it! So severely ill patients, people who need closer monitoring than would be possible in the community, or patients simply not suitable for discharge. Some antibiotics don't have an oral formulation, for example meropenem, so if someone needs those drugs then they'll have to have them IV.   I hope this explains a bit!"

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aqw0a,lepfire,2,Tue Jun 23 01:29:46 2015 UTC,"If she's in the hospital I would not worry at all. Allergic reactions do not just instantly kill you, and with appropriate drug access can be halted with a combination of epinephrine and immunosuppressants.  If she's at home, there will be a nurse administering it of course, and she will stay to monitor your grandmother's response. Generally an allergic response to an IV administered substance is happens right away, as opposed to the delayed responses that can occur when the substance has been eaten or subdermally injected (insect sting, getting a shot). The nurse will be trained and prepared for the event of an allergic reaction, and would be able to treat her on the scene while the ambulance is dispatched (probably a dose of epinephrine from an epipen). You could also request the doctor prescribe an epipen just in case. Epipens can be used by anyone without formal training, as they operate very simply being autoinjectors (remove any thick clothing on the legs, pull off indicated cap, and jam hard into a fleshy portion of either thigh and hold for 10 seconds).  If you're both really worried, you could have your grandma stay in the hospital for the first IV penicillin treatment, if she shows no severe reaction within a few hours it's very unlikely anything further will happen.  The real risk with allergies in when the person is not prepared (either not aware of the allergy, or not aware they've been exposed and are not prepared to respond to an allergic reaction)."

It's good you're standing, and honestly too keep it simple - do it as much as you can. Sitting isn't bad, but sitting for elongated periods of time is bad. So keep the balance between sitting and standing towards the standing side.   Sit with an exercise ball to engage more of those tonic muscles and make yourself balance. Light walks every hour ~5 minutes can really help keep you energized and more awake, plus you're moving!   All in all, more activity is best, so keep going to the gym and utilize that desk while standing as much as possible."

In terms of how effective they are, Mirena (an IUD) and Implanon/Nexplanon (an implanted rod) are generally more effective than oral contraceptive pills, and are also great because they're long-lasting and don't require someone to remember to take a pill daily.  However, YMMV. It's a personal decision for people and their partners, and has a lot to do with your lifestyle. If you're the person looking to get on birth control, go see your doctor after doing some research, and discuss the options with them.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3anbdv,EarthtoLaurenne,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:04:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  When I was in medical school, OBGYNs used to do a lot of primary care, but in the last decade I feel like that's really started to decline.  I would definitely establish care with a primary care doctor, and they can refer you from there.  It's always best, so that they can coordinate your care, and they can follow you long-term. Like /u/my2penniesworth has said, seek emergent evaluation for any worsening symptoms.  Good luck!  Oh and if you have question or need help, call your insurance company, and they can help you sort out which doctor you should see."

I'm a bit nervous because not too long ago, my Mom ended up in the hospital for 2 days with a huge cyst in her uterus after having been very light headed for a few days.  Of course, another warning sign for her was that she'd been menstruating for like a month, and that loss of blood partially caused her light headedness.  I just finished a very normal-length period, so I'm not too concerned that I have the same thing going on - but still, whenever my relatives end up in the hospital, I get very concerned that if I expect a symptom even mildly similar, I'm going to end up having the same condition."

Don't hesitate to go to the ER, but in the meantime, get your blood pressure checked. Dizziness from standing is frequently a symptom of low blood pressure.  I advise you to take this seriously. Sudden-onset persistent headaches are not a normal phenomenon. Headaches ordinarily only last a few hours, and rarely more than a day.  I would go to a walk-in clinic ASAP, don't undersell your pain, and if new symptoms emerge (confusion, sluggishness, fever, very stiff neck, vision changes, etc) go go a hospital immediately. I would have someone drive you to the emerg."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3anbdv,GetOutOfBox,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:39:28 2015 UTC,"The only two things that have changed are that I stopped taking my daily zinc supplement about two weeks ago, and I started eating pork after about 5 years of not eating it.  (I still ate other meats in that time.)  I'm 23.  I am feeling better today.  I've stood up a few times and not gotten the throbbing headache, which is a good sign.  One thing worth noting is that it's started getting super hot and humid here in Maryland, so perhaps this was related to weather changes?  I spent most of Thursday-Sunday in my air conditioned apartment, but the throbbing headaches first hit me while I was out on Wednesday.  I also returned to taking zinc on Saturday.  I'm thinking that maybe without the zinc boost, I might have caught some kind of bug.  I don't know, I guess I should probably go get checked out soon, even if I am feeling better.  I do have a few relatives with a history of heart problems, so there could well be a blood pressure issue going on.  Which is especially bad for me since I'm on a hormonal birth control.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3amm2n,denimchicken81,10,Sun Jun 21 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"Not a doctor. I made two trips to the ER myself with similar symptoms and finally discovered I have an anxiety disorder. When I have a panic attack the muscles in my neck tighten and extend into my pecks. Ergo, the chest pain. This increases panic and makes my breathing shallow, which, combined with the tight neck /chest issues, causes light headedness and tingling in my arm. Stopping smoking and cutting down drastically on caffeine has helped tremendously."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3amm2n,GriffGriffin,5,Sun Jun 21 21:37:41 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  When we breathe quickly, it changes the acid/base balance in our blood, and makes our blood more alkalotic (basic).  As a result, there are shifts of electrolytes in and out of cells which cause paresthesias (numbness/tingling) which are often felt in the extremities, and around the mouth.  When this gets really severe, patients can develop carpopedal spasm (the hands and feet lock up in spasm) which can be pretty scary.  The question really is - why is he breathing fast in the first place.  Certainly, anxiety might be a cause, but other things, including an arrhythmia like SVT, blood clots (less likely because it's intermittent), or other cardiac abnormalities must be considered.  He may need a 24 hour holter monitor or an event monitor so that arrhythmias might be found.  Good luck to him, I'd love to hear follow-up after his tests.  And yes, energy drinks probably are not helping."

You could be just experiencing what amounts to teething pains, as feeling ""pressure in the roots"" is pretty unlikely.    Get a pano, and ask about pros and cons when you do.  I'm going to guess about 1/2 the wisdom teeth extractions are unnecessary, and those that truely are, are usually due to partially erupted teeth (which are usually a safe distance from the nerve, unlike a horizontal impacted one)."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aiwt9,gregiryu,14,Sat Jun 20 17:08:08 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  I can't condone taking antibiotics without having a good understanding of what's causing the problem.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen patients come in after ""popping a couple penicillins"" for their cold and then wondering why they aren't feeling better.  The problem in your scrotum could be one of many things, but epididymitis is one of the more common infections we see of the testicles.  It is caused most often in men < 35 years old by gonorrhea or chlamydia.  In people over 35, it is caused more often by gut organisms.  We tailor antibiotics to those organisms, and in neither of those cases is Augmentin a first line antibiotic.  Additionally, pain or swelling in the scrotum could be one of many other things that aren't infections.  So I'll address the title of your thread in a general sense:   Taking antibiotics, even if taken for the entire course, can breed resistance in the rest of the bacteria in your body and cause a hard-to-treat infection later on.  The more times you take antibiotics, the more likely this scenario can be Augmentin has a nasty GI side effect profile, especially when it comes to diarrhea. Any antibiotic can cause c. difficile infection of the colon, which causes a severe diarrhea that is very difficult to treat (more antibiotics of a different kind) Chance of allergic reaction   So yes, there are risks to taking antibiotics.  Additionally, you may be only partially treating an infection, which can lead to worse problems later on."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3aiwt9,Smeeee,9,Sat Jun 20 18:47:02 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/Smeeee, say, is it common for docs in the US to prescribe antibiotics ""in case he needs them""?

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aiwt9,exikon,5,Sat Jun 20 19:07:52 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you how common it is or isn't.  I know some patients with COPD often have prescriptions for z-packs in case of bronchitis, and some people with frequent UTIs sometimes get antibiotic prescriptions if their classic symptoms pop up.    However, I don't think it's very common otherwise.  The only time I give antibiotics ""just in case"" is kids with otitis media that come in early.  I usually tell the parents to use a watch-and-wait approach, and if things get worse or aren't better + fever in a couple days, that they should fill the script."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aiwt9,piperiain,4,Sat Jun 20 19:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true for pretty much any medication. The expiration date on them is there for a reason.

I will not have any answers for you in this forum, because the differential diagnosis for what could be causing your symptoms is very broad, and you're right, I would expect you to be much better based on your treatment.  However, I will give you this piece of advice: Get yourself a primary care doctor.  You've seen 5 (different, I assume) doctors, and it seems like you may even be taking your mother's medicine without a prescription.  A primary care doctor is someone who will get to know you, to know what to try next, and to coordinate care with specialists, like an ENT physician or a pulmologist.    Seeing urgent care places (or even emergency departments) leads to trialing of medications that are either redundant, or even harmful, because of a lack of understanding of the overall picture.  You really need to establish a relationship with a primary care doctor at this point, and they should take the reins.  Good luck."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3adgdj,ponte-vanima,18,Fri Jun 19 05:36:22 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  Not all doctors are the same so I'm not speaking for everyone here.  But I realized long ago that the majority of my job is reassurance for patients.    At my ER, we admit 20% of patients.  I would say that 50% of those patients that are discharged had something that we could diagnose and/or treat without difficulty.  The other 50% (I'm obviously estimating here) are feeling something, or concerned about something, and I reassure them (either by history/physical, or diagnostic testing) that everything's okay.    It's okay.  My job isn't just to save lives that are on the brink of death.  It's to evaluate patients and determine if there's something serious going on.  That is the job of your physician too.  If patients knew when/if they were really sick, then what purpose would I have as a clinician?  It's our job to determine that stuff, and in my opinion, patients shouldn't feel bad.  I have patients occasionally that say ""I'm sorry for wasting your time"" and it makes me feel horrible for a couple of reasons - 1) I wonder if I did something to make the patient feel that they were not right in coming to the ER and 2) These are usually the really nice patients who actually have something ""wrong,"" albeit minor.  Again, a lot of our jobs as physicians is reassurance.  It's what we do.  I hope that helps."

You're much better off going, having them tell you that, and getting your peace of mind than to ignore it, find out it's a big problem that you've now let snowball, and it's harder to deal with. There is absolutely nothing wrong with seeing your family doctor and getting their opinion on something. They might instantly know what the problem is or know it's not a problem within the 15 minute time frame they try to keep you in, then you can both go about your lives.  You are not a burden to your family doctor and their job is to keep you healthy. If there is something that is legitimately concerning you, you should go see them. At minimum, you can just call the office and ask if you could relay what your problem is to the nurse/doctor and ask if they would recommend you come in to be seen. They should be willing to do that for you and give you a call back when they can to let you know if you should go in."

And given how many people they see I'm sure you are nothing more than a blip in the day for them.   The only thing I can suggest is get a little journal and make a note of symptoms. Then when you feel like you should be going to the doctor make a note if how you are feeling.. Wait a week or a few days and come back to it. Read over what you have read and ask yourself how much of it still applies.. And maybe how much of it could just be day to day aches and pains.   Worrying about stuff can actually hurt..

The doctor lanced it and squeezed out what looked like a gallon of white stuff, which I learned later was dead cells just piling up in there. It was so big by then that we had to keep it packed with gauze to keep it from filling up again until it was healed. It was gross and super painful for him, but now there is a tiny scar on his back and no bump. I would suggest to go have it looked at, just tell them that you have a bump or possible cyst and you need to have it looked at. More than likely they won't know what it is until the look at it, or in it. Good luck OP! :)"

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aco4d,upandalive,4,Fri Jun 19 00:59:55 2015 UTC,"I had a chronic and painful injury (Pinched nerve in my neck, affecting most of the right side of my torso) for almost two years.  I was finally referred to a pain management specialist when I basically broke down with my primary care doctor at the umpteenth fruitless follow-up appointment. I told my doctor how I was depressed, frustrated, hopeless, how I felt useless, and how these emotional instabilities were causing me to lash out at people I cared about. I told him that while my physical weakness was a large part of it, the biggest part was that I had a choice between either being so stoned I didn't give a fuck about what was going on - and didn't care about my pain - or dealing with debilitating pain that made me almost useless in performing my daily duties, at work or at home.  He referred me to a pain management specialist, and I reiterated, more calmly, these issues to her, and she began sending me to physical therapy, and giving me more effective medications, that allowed me to manage my pain, while still being functional and sober (They were still opiates, but in a dosage and with a schedule that made them work, but not so much that I was basically drunk on them).   She also referred me to a behavioral therapist, to give me someone to talk to about my emotional difficulties.  These solutions worked very well for me, and aided in my recovery. I was also made aware that there were all sorts of other treatment options available to her, such as acupuncture or massage therapy, and others I can't remember because they didn't seem contextually appropriate.  Anyhow...Just try your best to express your concerns to your doctor. My biggest fear when I kept telling my doctor, ""No, this pill doesn't work, I need another one/a stronger one."" was that they would believe I was seeking narcotics or opiates illegitimately. I never was accused or suspected of such, to my knowledge.  Your doctor has undoubtedly dealt with chronic pain before - especially if you're already dealing with a pain management specialist. Just describe it to the best of your ability. How it affects you. When it hurts. How much it hurts (What you'd compare the pain to). What it keeps you from doing. How this pain affects you emotionally (Uselessness, hopelessness, general depression, frustration, anger, etc.). How it affects your daily affairs.  An example, paraphrased to the best of my memory from my own explanation to my pain management specialist...  ""Any time I pick something up that's heavier than a textbook or a laptop with my right arm, I can't lift it or hold it up. I can't carry boxes, I can't carry my groceries. I have intense shoulder and arm pain just manipulating my steering wheel during my morning or afternoon commute. I can't hold a phone between my ear and shoulder - or hold it up with my right arm. I can't fully stretch my chest, arm, or shoulder when I feel like I should or need to. I try to go to the gym, and I can't, I can't, even bench press a 12.5lbs dumbbell with my right arm. I can't do a single pushup without collapsing to the ground. I feel worthless and like a liability. I can't do my job, I can't even carry a box of paper back to my office to restock our printers, because I simply don't have the physical strength to do so. I'm short-tempered, I blow up at my friends and at my fiance, and if I'm not bitter and pissy, I'm withdrawn and depressed, and I feel hopeless, because after months and months of this, it feels like there's no end in sight. I went from going to the gym and lifting weights, doing outstandingly on my physical fitness test, and being able to do my job...To wincing in pain just driving to work. To being unable to lift even the barest fraction of what I could lift in the gym, with my arm. From maxing out my pushups, to not being able to do a single one. I don't know what to do, Doc, and I don't know how to deal with this.""  It was a long rant, and I'm sure they're used to that...But it laid it all out there, and it helped reassure me that I wasn't coming off as a faker or a malingerer.  In summary...Don't stress about how to say it, just say it. Your injury prevents you from wiping your ass - tell him. Your pain keeps you from sleeping - tell him. You can't even tie your shoes in the morning - tell him. All of this makes you come home and break down and cry because of how futile all of the treatments feel - tell him.  Just tell him how it affects you."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3aco4d,Droidball,2,Fri Jun 19 07:51:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for replying and staying on the topic at hand lol. Self-reporting pain is a relatively new experience for me. Thanks for the comment. It helps putting things into perspective.
AskDoctorSmeeee,3aco4d,J0HNN0,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"One of the big things is to be totally honest with your doctor too. You do need to let them know about lashing out, sleep patterns (do you wake up in pain during the night?). What are your capabilities?

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aco4d,kjhwkejhkhdsfkjhsdkf,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"So the concern is that the doctor doesn't fully appreciate the scope of the pain, and thus the medication that you're being given is, in your opinion, not sufficient to deal with the pain that you experience?"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3aco4d,PainMatrix,3,Fri Jun 19 02:16:30 2015 UTC,I just want to make sure that everyone is clear that medication is only one way to manage pain and that there is not yet good evidence to support long-term opioid therapy (greater than 3-6 months).

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aco4d,PainMatrix,4,Fri Jun 19 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"It's mainly due to a dearth of high quality long-term studies. I'm not advocating that they shouldn't be prescribed with proper oversight, I'm just making a statement on the extant research."

I totally wish insurance companies would at least let people try some of those things, as additonal or auxillary therapies, and if some of them find that they can achieve control of their pain with fewer - or even no - pills if they get acupuncture, do yoga, smoke a weed that will grow wild by the road if you let it, or all of the above - great.  If not, well, they  tried, and at least learned something new that they might be able to tell somebody else about.  But insurance companies pay according to the agreements they have with the different pharmaceutical companies, and neither insurance giants nor pharmaceutical manufacturers are in business for our health..."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aco4d,kjhwkejhkhdsfkjhsdkf,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:57:27 2015 UTC,No. The situation is the patient experiencing difficulty in explaining the pain. This causes a lack of clear perspective and goal in communicating the entirety of the situation.
AskDoctorSmeeee,3aco4d,kjhwkejhkhdsfkjhsdkf,3,Fri Jun 19 02:31:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, but at the end of the day it comes down to either needing a larger dose, a smaller dose, or something different.   Most doctors don't have a problem lowering doses or trying an alternative medication, the problem always arises when the dose is not enough, and that seems to be the bulk of contention when it comes to patients, doctors and painkillers."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aaec2,2kidzandadog,7,Fri Jun 19 00:23:50 2015 UTC,"If they have not been treated I would be a little leery of the diagnosis. Bipolar disorder is not something that should be self-diagnosed.   However, assuming that they do have at least some mental health symptoms that are cause for concern I would ask them the following: ""Would you go to a doctor if you had cancer?"" I'm not being flippant here, mental health conditions are medical (they're neurobiological). However, due to the complexity of the brain we don't have perfect assessment or treatment protocols. So, I think information is key here, here is just one article that talks about the medical nature of bipolar disorder, you can find many others yourself.   Having the right information is the first step. The second thing you can do is to listen empathically to your friend. If you have real concerns about them express them to your friend in a nonjudgmental and open manner. Let them know you have been feeling concerned, ask them how you can best support them, and let them know that you are there for them emotionally."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3aaec2,PainMatrix,4,Thu Jun 18 16:06:45 2015 UTC,While I agree that people should seek professional help for issues relating to mental health I can understand why many people are hesitant. Being treated for cancer doesn't automatically strip you of any rights by the state the same way as being treated for mental health issues. Nor does it affect employment opportunities in the same way.  This is one of the reasons why I have been strongly advocating for anonymous treatment programs.
AskDoctorSmeeee,3aaec2,_My_Angry_Account_,3,Thu Jun 18 19:53:16 2015 UTC,Definitely. But being aware that what they're dealing with is medical may help them to overcome their own personal biases and apprehensions.

AskDoctorSmeeee,3aaec2,PainMatrix,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:35:47 2015 UTC,"Medication pretty much breaks down to one of two effects, it either blocks a receptor in your body, or it activates a receptor in your body.  Problem is that many different functions in your body are controlled by the same receptor. Take serotonin, one of the main neurotransmitters involved.   Take a look at how many things outside of the mind those receptors affect. Even though they can tailor drugs to make a particular receptor more attractive, it's not a 100% complete process, so while a drug will mostly affect the desired receptor, very often it will also trigger ones that are similar enough.   So if a particular anti anxiety drug hit a receptor that also affects your GI tract, you're going to get some stomach upset along with the beneficial effects for your mental health. They try to make them as targeted as possible, but it's not easy."

Never heard of this drug causing this but it dries your mouth significantly.  Sometimes with drier teeth, plaque, food, and stain are much more likely since the surface tension on the tooth is lower (less saliva lubrication due to dry mouth).  The result is that line of stain (think of a dirty bathtub after it's drained) along the teeth.  I'm sure your dentist would be happy to do a polish alone ($25 here) if you asked."

I unfortunately don't know of any places that do this, but I do know that the Mayo Clinic prides itself on taking on ""tough cases"" and finding answers.  Here's a link to them: http://www.mayoclinic.org/appointments  That being said, I don't know its cost, nor if they have any funded research, but I think it might be worth contacting them.  It seems like your team of medical practitioners has done a very adequate and thorough workup, but sometimes getting new eyes and new ideas on some things can help turn over some rocks.  Sorry, I wish I could be of more help."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a94ss,Smeeee,2,Thu Jun 18 18:51:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I looked at their website, and it seems that they provide care through the insurance company. I'll send the link to my fiancee and see what she thinks."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a94ss,my2penniesworth,2,Thu Jun 18 20:29:27 2015 UTC,What specific specialists has she seen? Neurology? Has she had any kind of diagnosis or a short list of possible diagnoses?

AskDoctorSmeeee,3a94ss,my2penniesworth,3,Thu Jun 18 05:37:10 2015 UTC,I think it's going to be tough without a possible diagnosis. If she had one you could Google '(name of disease) clinical or research trials' to see what pops up.   I've seen on Craigslist where some large universities with med schools were advertising for research participants for people with particular medical problems.   One of the docs may come along later with some other ideas.
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a94ss,calm_it_gina,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:47:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help. AFAIK no doctor or specialist she's seen had any possible diagnosis, but since it's mostly an annoyance than anything else, they probably didn't feel the need to explore further."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a94ss,iamnotmagic,3,Thu Jun 18 05:54:40 2015 UTC,"But who wants to have an annoyance all the time? Sometimes, it just takes finding the right doctor/specialist and unfortunately, that can time and money.  I would suggest that she ask each doctor she has seen for a copy of her records (visit notes and test results) so she can put them in a binder to take to all appointments. She will have to sign a Medical Release form from each one but it is worth it to have everyone's notes in one place.   She should put them in the binder starting from earliest date to most recent date and that way the next doctor can review it in order.  If she's only seen one neurologist, she might try another one or possibly an Infectious Disease doctor. I don't have any idea what it could possibly be but it's just a suggestion.   Does she remember anything happening at 13 at the time the symptoms started? An accident? A bite that got infected? Anything?"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a8jxn,elninofamoso,5,Thu Jun 18 02:02:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not a doc, just a medic. But what you described isn't terribly uncommon, and it CAN cause ""feelings of impending doom"". Make an appointment with your family doc, they may have you wear a holter monitor for a few days. This is a harness-like contraption that records your heart rhythms over the course of a few days and can monitor for any rhythm changes. Arrythmias in otherwise healthy people can be caused by tons of things, from too much caffeine, to working outside in the heat. A holter monitor may help determine what triggers it for you, if it comes back at all."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a8jxn,nightmarechild_,2,Thu Jun 18 18:08:41 2015 UTC,Perfectly said.
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a8jxn,Smeeee,3,Thu Jun 18 18:42:22 2015 UTC,What you describe sounds like anxiety issues. I have had both generalized anxiety and arrythmia and both of them can give me similar mental symptoms. the anxiety itself doesn't set off the irregular heart beat signal on my blood pressure monitor but a bout of arrythmia does. I use an Omron BP monitor a basic one that was about fifty US dollars.
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a8jxn,xrawv,3,Thu Jun 18 18:34:55 2015 UTC,I had this a lot in nursing school. I also have it now when stressed or if I've had a lot of caffeine. It was almost constant My whole first trimester.  Follow up with your GP. They can do more snooping than an ER. They may discuss anxiety even more or try a holter monitor.

As has been mentioned, there is Epocrates (app) to get medication information - especially helpful with children or those with kidney disease / dysfunction.    Additionally, I have UpToDate (subscription service) which I'll use to find the latest treatment guidelines for things.  I'll occasionally use emedicine as well, which is free.  Occasionally, however, I do just google stuff - mainly so I can find helpful discharge instructions for patients on their disease.  I rarely, if ever, use google to actually fill in gaps of knowledge, and if I do, I'm going to go to a reliable source from google to get what I want.    Just the other day, I was telling someone about the biggest danger in medicine: not knowing what you don't know.  It's when you practice and don't even realize that you don't know something, and proceed to diagnose and treat anyway.  There should be no shame in looking things up, if it's for the safety and benefit of your patient."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3a5wf9,Buffalo__Buffalo,15,Thu Jun 18 10:58:15 2015 UTC,"I work as a scribe in the emergency department and many of the attendings and residents have apps on their phones to help answer specific questions. The biggest thing I've seen used is a database for pharmacology (sorry I don't know any names besides Micromedex).  There are thousands of drugs out there - it's impossible to know each ones side effects and memorize their interactions with other medications.   So for example when you get a patient who reports a new medication last month and you suspect their current symptoms may be due to a side effect of the new drug, definitely look it up to check and voila, you were right :)"

AskDoctorSmeeee,3a6gv7,ThisIsRob,3,Wed Jun 17 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  Thanks for the question!   I tried researching your question, and pubmed and my other resources cannot identify any reputable evidence for Whey/Protein powder causing male pattern baldness.  So I turned to google, and found a lot of websites claiming that this doctor or that doctor has found in some study somewhere that protein powder is a risk factor.  None of these appear to be peer-reviewed publications, so I take them with a grain of salt.  Genetics is certainly a large factor in developing baldness.  People would point to your mother's father back in the good old days to determine if you yourself would go bald.  What we've found, though, is that your father's balding pattern is likely the biggest factor in determining if you will become bald.  However, the genetics can also be inherited (for better or for worse) from your mom / mom's side.    Back to your question about powder, I wonder if some of these studies have seen these results because people who have whey powder work out more.  The end cause in male-pattern baldness at the end of the day is an increased amount of DHT, which forms from testosterone.  A lot of the medications out there (like propecia) work because they stop this conversion into DHT.  However, having more testosterone (which may occur due to working out) may lead to more DHT being formed, and thus baldness, and having more whey protein may just be a confounder.    Again, though, this is all speculation, because I can't find any studies, but hopefully that helps a little."

My biggest concern is if I were to start using protein powder and seeing my hair fall out, would it be too late to stop using it and reverse the effects? Or would the damage already have been done?  I think for the time being I'll just stick to lifting without any sort of supplements, just focusing on eating a lot more to put on weight and hoping for the best. I've never used protein powder before, so I don't even know if it would help me that much in gaining muscle mass.  As a follow up question, is protein powder actually just like ""eating a whole bunch of protein rich foods?"" My gut instinct is telling me no, and that there's obviously more to it than that (eating 50 chicken breasts probably won't make me go bald), but at the same time if all you're doing is consuming large concentrated amounts of protein, then what would be the difference?"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a6gv7,BBlackleg,3,Wed Jun 17 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"As the Doc suggested these days it's generally considered to be a mix of genetics that determines where your hairline wanders as you age. My pattern is exactly like my Father's while it thins like my Mother's Father did.  For the protein I think you'll find the worst you'll encounter is possibly gas/stomach issues. Early protein powders/shakes (late 80's to late 90's) were usually milk and egg proteins with a TON of sugar and random fillers, those caused folks all sorts of issues in large doses. Comparatively the Whey is much easier on your system, both in what your body has to do to break it down and how much you get out of what you've taken in.   Some caution though, you describe yourself as 'skin and bones', so if you've got a speedy metabolism that keeps you that way, absent of focused physical training (as mine does for me), there's the tendency for 'hard-gainers' to go overboard with their intake - and about the only thing I've read that seems to be in some consensus is that you can put some real stress on your kidneys if you are piling on too much protein. So long as you are just using it for the post-workout re-fuel you should be good to go! Good luck!"

AskDoctorSmeeee,3a5knj,kitten_547,3,Wed Jun 17 12:05:57 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  I thank my fellow back when I was a fourth year medical student in my cardiology rotation for really going into depth on how to read an EKG and taking me through a stepwise approach.  I still try to do that stepwise approach with every EKG I look at (I average around 5-10 per shift).  The basics that are usually taught are:  Rate (Less than 50 [or 60, depends who you read] or greater than 90 is abnormal)  Rhythm Sinus? Or is there a block of some sort?  Axis Left, Right, or normal  Intervals PR (normal < 200 ms), QRS (normal < 120 ms), QT (normal < 440, although the QTc is usually used to correct)  Morphology - This includes stuff like The P waves (looking for atrial enlargement), Q waves (signs of old infarct), R wave progression, ST segments (elevation or depression), and T waves (inversions, hyperacute, etc)  So RRAIM (P,Q, R, ST, T) Is how I do it, stepwise.  But reading an EKG is more than just recognizing things, it's putting things into context.  Okay so why is the axis left, or why is it right?  Why are my T waves hyperacute, etc.  So regarding the axis, I love Life in the Fastlane for the basics for things like this.  Also, here's a website totally devoted to heart axis.  It's hard to really explain the electrical stuff without drawing vectors and things so hopefully that works for you.  Going back to what I was saying, interpreting things -- it's not enough to necessarily say ""okay there's left axis deviation""... it's best to look for reasons why (Left bundle, left anterior fascicular block, poor conduction because of heart attack, etc cause left axis for example).  The LITFL link has a lot of reasons for both right and left axis.  I read EKGs like we run traumas or codes: A is abnormal? Okay it's not enough to say it's abnormal. Fix it and move on.  Same thing.  Axis is left? Why?  Hope that helps!"

I'll link you to a page that shows you how an appendectomy is performed, as an example: http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1582203-overview#a7  We can't necessarily push the entire muscles away most of the time.  We have to go through them.  Muscles are made up of fibers (think of a typical cable in cross-section) and while we can't usually just move the entire muscle, we can split the muscle to separate the fibers to the sides and go through it to get to what's below.  Hope that explanation (and the pictures) help!"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a2xgb,Smeeee,4,Tue Jun 16 20:44:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot, that helped! Just a little follow up question: If i can split muscles and push them beside, is there nothing which 'keeps' those fibers together? Can they move around or are there small connections between them?

Anyways thank you for doing this. What a great subreddit!"
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a2xgb,Smeeee,8,Tue Jun 16 20:54:43 2015 UTC,"The fibers are usually surrounded by connective tissue, much like how a cable is surrounded by a sheath.

Usually the muscles heal without trouble."

I'm not sure if that makes sense - Is it more like a bundle of strings or a bundle of like, idk, fruit laces?   Also, given the whole 'sheath' thing: When you have a hernia, is the sheath damaged and that allows the organs to push through the muscle, or do the organs push through the muscle and rest against the sheath? OR do hernias not poke through a muscle, but between them?"

AskDoctorSmeeee,3a2xgb,punstersquared,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:33:27 2015 UTC,"I'm just a vet student, but I'm oddly excited to nerd out about hernias. ;) There are multiple different ways you can have a hernia. The most common type that people talk about, that commonly happens in middle-aged men, is an inguinal hernia. In an inguinal hernia, the organs (usually loops of small intestine) head down into or alongside the inguinal canal, which is an outpouching of the abdominal cavity that travels through two natural openings between the muscles. These openings are called the internal and external inguinal rings. The inguinal canal contains a nerve in both sexes, the round ligament of the uterus in women, and the spermatic cord (vas deferens, blood vessels, and lymphatics) in men.  The most common hernia in babies is an umbilical hernia. In utero, the fetus has an umbilical ring, or interruption of the soft tissue sheath where it joins the abdominal muscles, to allow structures like blood vessels to pass through to the placenta. This is normally small and closes shortly after birth. If it is looser than normal or fails to close, you can have persistent umbilical hernias. You can also have larger midline hernias in babies from failure of the abdominal muscles on either side of midline to join together properly; they normally coalesce in a dense layer of connective tissue called the linea alba.  Someone more knowledgeable will have to confirm this but I think most hernias due to trauma involve both the muscle fibers and the sheath.  You can also have internal hernias, such as diaphragmatic hernias, where your abdominal organs can end up in your chest due to rupture of the diaphragm in a high-speed accident or congenital defects."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a2pre,upandalive,3,Tue Jun 16 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  The answer to your question is ""it depends.""   There are many ways to become a pain specialist.  Anesthesiologists, PM&R doctors, neurologists, and even psychiatrists can become pain specialists.  But they have background training first in those respective fields.    Depending on what their background training is, their experience with emotional well being and psychology will vary greatly.    As far as experience during the pain fellowship training itself, I'm not sure, but maybe /u/PainMatrix has some insight regarding this..."
AskDoctorSmeeee,3a2pre,Smeeee,3,Tue Jun 16 19:55:38 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know how MDs are trained in this.

One thing that I told him was that in health psychology we are trained to assess and treat the patients pain from the biopsychosocial perspective with the understanding that all of those domains exert an influence. Traditionally, medicine has been focused on the biological aspect of this, but from what I can tell this is beginning to shift."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3a2pre,TextofReason,3,Wed Jun 17 02:28:20 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, that sounded very rude, and I didn't mean it that way. Let me try again.  In the US, as I'm sure you're aware, medical treatment is essentially a luxury item. And for anything serious and/or ongoing, even with health insurance, that's still the case.  That's caused a problem with people using the emergency room for things that could and should have been taken care of with an office visit and maybe an antibiotic. So people let things like a simple infection go untreated until it does become an emergency.  Over the years, it has also evolved into a cultural thing. Like the old joke about the secretary who complains of a headache. ""Don't worry,"" her boss reassures her. ""Put a big smile on your face and no one will know.""  Tough it out. Power through. Visualize! Mind over matter. Don't be a wimp. You create your own reality, all these mantras...  I think it was the ""Nickeled and Dimed"" author who said that one of the things that struck her as she studied the plight of low income workers in the US was how many of them were in some degree of pain most or all of the time, due to various causes, from injury, illness, repetitive motion, or undue stress on this or that body part. Physical pain is an accepted feature of poverty.  So, just as the people showing up at the emergency room with advanced infections,  by the time the pain has gotten so bad that the person, in desperation finally bites the bullet  - (well, I guess they would actually stop biting it) takes the extreme step of seeking medical attention, they have already been through all that float above it, don't think about it, visualize your happy place and whatnot.  The problem with severe pain is that once it hits a certain point, you can't really do anything, or even think. So the mantras, and the cultural pressure to be variously badass or a strong woman or however one thinks of it, are not really effective. They need to get the problem fixed. If the problem can't be fixed, they need medication to manage and reduce the pain as best as can be done.  That doesn't necessarily mean being 100% pain-free 24/7, although it's wonderful if that happens. But it does usually mean getting enough control to be able to have some function, even if the medication that giveth also taketh away.  Aaand I've written a book.  tldr: pain bad. pain control good."

I'm not smart enough to understand all the brain chemical terms, but I especially liked the subtle hints of common sense in the sum-up.  First of all, with regard to the ""entitlement"" issue, I should confess bias. According to my personal beliefs, medical treatment to restore and maintain our physical and/or mental health, including pain relief/control, is a basic human right, so yes, we are all entitled to it.  The article also reminded me of a ""mantra"" I left out - ""fear of pain is worse than the pain itself."" That's more applicable to something like getting a shot or a blood test.   Not to minimize or trivialize fear of the continuation or return of ongoing, severe, excrutiating pain. That's a very real thing. It's been a standard tactic and tool of the wetworker trade for millennia - give the victim a short break from interrogation, and the very sound of his tormentor's footsteps returning will turn him into a quivering, gibbering mess. That's not fear of the unknown, but of the all too well-known. But worse than the pain? Nah, given the choice of the fear or the pain, I'm pretty sure most folks would pick the fear.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that from my perspective, chronic, severe pain is a catastrophe. It comes already pre-catastrophized. No further effort from the patient is required.  Helplessness, depression, hopelessness? Just because of a simple life sentence of unrelenting, screaming pain? Come on now.  Of course staying positive is going to be a challenge, even with excellent pain control. The Cymbalta bin is over there, just dump 'em in, and grab yourself a cupcake and a Lemon Perrier on your way out  Whew! I wrote another damn book. OK, let me just pet the elephant in the room, and I'll sit on my hands and shut up.  No pain that illness or injury can throw at us can compare with the pain of a loved one. That's the catastrophe tipping point that sends the most hard-headed mind over matterists to the doctor: When you can no longer hide it from the people who love you most, that's when you cave.  Their feelings of helplessness, their fear, as time goes on, we can't even imagine. If we are entitled to pain control for ourselves, which, as noted, I believe we are, then our loved ones are exponentially-entitled to us having it.  OK, my sentences are going wonky, and I didn't even get to the homologous faith-based variants, but I'm sure you already know them, from ""offer your suffering up to the BVM"" to ""free yourself from all desire"" (including the desire for pain relief)."

AskDoctorSmeeee,39viff,caedin8,12,Mon Jun 15 03:34:20 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I'm not an orthopedic surgeon and don't see patients in long-term settings, so there's a chance I might be slightly off.  But here's what I think. There is some displacement of the fragments, meaning that the pieces have separated and moved from their normal alignment.  A callous will eventually form as scar tissue connecting the pieces but it might form irregularly and it might cause an unsightly visible bump. Additionally, over time, range of motion might decrease when the callous forms. Finally, arthritis may set in as well over time, if that fracture involves the joint (can't tell looking at the film).  So I believe there's a chance for delayed loss of function, but as long as you're immobilized right now in a splint or cast, you do have a short time to seek a second opinion.  I'd probably opt for the surgery, if it was me, but risks and benefits must be weighed with everything we do in medicine, and those risks and benefits are different for different people.  By the way, it is your surgeon's job to explain risks and benefits prior to a procedure. They must review them and answer any questions that you have. It's their duty. So make sure you ask again.  Infection is probably the most concerning risk, both wound infections and then infection of the bone around the hardware.  That can result in more operations in the future. But again I don't know numbers and details as I am not a hand surgeon, and that is something they should definitely review with you.  Good luck :)"

I had an appointment with a hand specialist and he spent about 5 minutes telling me I needed a plate installed, which would last for life, and then signed me up for surgery and walked out.  I called them to cancel saying I would get a second opinion. He wouldn't really tell me why I needed the surgery and didn't discuss the risks of the surgery or living with the titanium plate/screws. I'd like to hear some of the common risks associated with this sort of procedure, because the surgeon didn't have time to explain anything to me.  Edit: I am not seeking medical advice related to my injury. I am looking for general information related to risks of surgery with permanent titanium installations and risks associated with non-surgical treatments of this type of fracture."

AskDoctorSmeeee,39viff,poolwater,3,Mon Jun 15 20:25:11 2015 UTC,"Well dude, some people's bodies reject the hardware and start to push it out of the bone as it heals. Nerve damage is always possible.  As well as a burning sensation as the nerves heal.  Like smeeee said there is the infection risk as well.

AskDoctorSmeeee,39vb4w,TheLilyHammer,8,Mon Jun 15 02:31:27 2015 UTC,Not a doctor! But watching my mom go thru stage 3 kidney failure due to aspirin sucks. She spent about 15-20 years downing a Costco sized bottle of excedrin per month. Next step in her kidney failure is dialysis.  I hope your gf can listen to a dr or you when you tell her your concerns. Kidney failure is not a fun road to go just to avoid a headache.
AskDoctorSmeeee,39vb4w,mutantmother,8,Mon Jun 15 14:55:47 2015 UTC,"Tell her that /u/headmustard, when he was in his 20's, was taking two Excedrin maybe every 2-3 days (so not even as much as your GF), for headaches. Sometimes more, sometimes less. But this went on for several years. Eventually, he went to his MD and explained the situation. She promptly ran a CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel, IIRC (aka blood work)) and called me the next day saying to knock it off, my kidney (or liver, I can never remember) levels were high. Not way too high, but higher than normal. She promptly demanded I switch to ibuprofen.  She'll burn up her organs doing this.   I am not a doctor."

The most important thing is diagnosing the type of headache and the cause. If it is a migraine, she needs a preventative. It is certainly not a good idea to use any medicine more than is necessary.   Excedrin has tylenol which can be hard on the liver, especially if it is taken frequently. It also has aspirin which has gi upset, gi ulceration, and anti-platelet aggregation properties. I certainly would never recommend it on an empty stomach.   I would just let her know you're concerned about her headaches and excedrin use and you think she should see a doctor for it (and that internet people agree). Good luck!"

Your girlfriend may be going through rebound headache cycles. The pain medicine can cause bad headaches that go away with increasing dosages until it wears off, eventually causing near daily headaches. Usually the solution given is to stop taking the medicine.    Caffeine also gives some people migraines, while the withdrawal of caffeine can give migraines too.Its a sensitive drug.  Identifying triggers to the migraines and starting to log every headache and med usage is a great start from now until the Neuro appt. It'll help the doctor have a more comprehensive view of the level of the migraines.   She should see a neurologists to consider other medicine options and if you're really concerned you can do a blood work up to make sure nothing was harmed.   For migraine related questions, /r/migraine is full of people who have more information on medicines, supplements, and overall experience.   Good luck."

AskDoctorSmeeee,39v6up,My-fucking-throwaway,7,Mon Jun 15 01:51:41 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Typically ischemic (lack of blood flow to an area) strokes do not cause headaches. The reason is that there are no pain receptors in the brain, only the meninges which cover the brain, so you need to swell enough to cause the meninges to stretch. This typically doesn't happen in the case of ischemic strokes, but often happens with hemorrhagic (bleeding) strokes.  So then, what do I think about if a patient has stroke like symptoms but no bleed on their cat scan?   carotid artery or vertebral artery dissection venous sinus thrombosis (blood clot in the veins draining the brain) complex migraine subarachnoid hemorrhage (ct can sometimes be negative) seizure (but doesn't have long lasting paralysis) vasculitis, or inflammation of the blood vessels, that can happen due to many causes, including lupus.   Assuming your wife had contrast MRI performed with MRA and MRV (looking at the arteries and veins, respectively) then the first two have probably been ruled out.   My thought is about the last one, vasculitis.  It can have many causes, not just autoimmune, but it may be something to ask the doctor about.  Even something like temporal or giant cell arteritis are things to think about.    Fwiw, typically MS doesn't cause pain either.    I hope that's somewhat helpful. Good luck to both of you, and if there are any developments, please let me know."

AskDoctorSmeeee,39sh2m,A_Cute_Infarction,16,Sun Jun 14 09:10:43 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Good question. And an important one.  Before we go on though, the number you quote for risk of allergy is for anaphylaxis, according to that paper. The incidence of any type of IgE mediated reaction (hives for example) is not reported. And I'd be wary of giving penicillin to anyone who had hives as a prior reaction, because it is on the spectrum towards anaphylaxis.  Still, yes, these ""allergies"" are over-reported. Most of the time, people are intolerant or, like this paper alludes to, had confounding factors that may have led to a rash.  My guesses for why we don't test people more:   testing is expensive (in the US this would require an allergy consult in the hospital + cost of the test) giving penicillin to patients who report an allergy, if it leads to an adverse outcome, would have lawyers salivating ('murica) cost is not considered all the time, and the path of least resistance is usually taken patients are sometimes convinced about their allergies and would refuse empirically trying them.   But still you make a great point. As you move on in your career, make note of how many patients report a codeine allergy, and then what percentage of them say their allergy is that it makes them nauseated."

AskDoctorSmeeee,39sh2m,Smeeee,7,Sun Jun 14 13:10:33 2015 UTC,"I assume because you're inoculating with a small dose that the risk is pretty small, but it would still have to be done under strictly monitored conditions.

I don't care if it doesn't cause anaphylaxis, I'm never taking that crap again.

I go through the same spiel every time...not sure I'm actually allergic, I just said I can't eat shrimp once and now it's entrenched in my records etc etc. I've suggested testing several times but I think it's just a liability thing...now it's there in my records, no-one wants to go there even if allergy testing said otherwise."

It's possible the iodine manifests in some such way within shellfish to become an allergen, I guess, but I never bought it.

AskDoctorSmeeee,39fbls,TurnTheTVOff,5,Fri Jun 12 09:07:24 2015 UTC,In most states (if not all) MDs are not allowed to list cardiac arrest as the cause of death
AskDoctorSmeeee,39fbls,lornad,4,Fri Jun 12 13:48:16 2015 UTC,"Truly dying without waking up (person found in covers with no sign of distress) is usually a massive stroke (or a small brainstem stroke) or heart failure. Anything involving the lungs or other organs will usually wake the person up (blood oxygen dropping usually causes the person to wake in a panic, though they may not be able to get far or even move much)."
AskDoctorSmeeee,39fbls,GetOutOfBox,6,Thu Jun 11 18:20:34 2015 UTC,How likely is it for a young person to die that way. (Obviously unlikely but is it absurdly unlikely or does it happen?)
AskDoctorSmeeee,39fbls,vexmaddy,3,Thu Jun 11 19:20:16 2015 UTC,Unlikely enough that it would warrant an autopsy
AskDoctorSmeeee,39fbls,lornad,6,Thu Jun 11 23:38:10 2015 UTC,"Very, very unlikely. You probably do dozens of things that are wayyyyyyyyy more likely to kill you (in comparison, they too are very unlikely assuming good safety practices), such as getting into a car, crossing an intersection on foot, etc.  The body has many many mechanisms that are designed to respond to ""glitches"" such as clots accumulating in an artery, your heart getting ""off-beat"" (an arrhythmia), a tear in an important blood vessel in your brain, etc. Within your lifetime your body has already experienced many of these glitches and responded appropriately to protect itself, it's very normal. We live in an unpredictable world and are built upon many complicated processes, so in order for us to get where we are as a species, our bodies have had to develop backup-mechanisms and backup-mechanisms for the backup-mechanisms, etc.  I would advise if you find yourself worried about this, to direct your energy to maintaining good health, as this will significantly increase your body's resiliency and pave the way for you to be much more healthy in old-age. Exercising daily (20 minutes daily of moderate exercise like jogging is sufficient to significantly improve health over time, though more is even better) is a HUGE benefit. It significantly strengthens your heart and increases it's efficiency (which reduces the effects of age on it and increases it's resiliency), improves metabolic function in the brain and increases synaptic plasticity, reduces blood pressure which significantly reduces the risk of dangerous clots forming (more relevant to older individuals who are at an increased risk), etc, etc.  You can also take supplements to increase your general health, though I would say the majority are not necessary and do not have worthwhile effects (very minimal). However there has been evidence supporting certain supplements, based on the research I personally take Vitamin D (especially since I live in a climate with long winters), Fish Oil (mercury filtered and refrigerated after opening, very important to make sure of), and magnesium glycinate. The Vitamin D is one that has been observed to be slightly deficient in a large portion of the population, as has magnesium. So supplementing may increase health and may even counteract symptoms of a minor deficiency depending on your individual levels. Fish oil I take because of it's significantly positive effects on heart health and protective effect on brain health, especially since I very rarely eat fish and so have few sources of Omega-3 fatty acids (plant sources are not well absorbed by the body)."
AskDoctorSmeeee,39fbls,GetOutOfBox,3,Fri Jun 12 07:27:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Great answer. I have been thinking about it for a while. I am overall healthy and spend alot of time exercising, so maybe i should not be worried. It is marvelous what the body can do but i cant help to think it is also a fragile vessel."
AskDoctorSmeeee,39fbls,vexmaddy,3,Fri Jun 12 10:47:32 2015 UTC,"It is marvelous what the body can do but i cant help to think it is also a fragile vessel.   It's normal to have the occasional worry about that, mainly because most people have no way of knowing what's going on inside their bodies or understanding how their bodies can protect themselves. In reality, we have an exceptionally resilient ""design"", one that resists a ton of physical challenges on a daily basis.  We must learn to accept that there is always a certain level of risk to your health. When you're young it's generally very small, and increases bit by bit as you get much older (starting at around 40 and peaking at about 80). This is just the way of life, we all eventually start to slow down a bit, which means we take life a little slower and more carefully. What you can focus is on is the fact that you DO have quite a bit of control over this process; people who work throughout their life to maintain good health (regular exercise, good food, avoiding excessive drinking and smoking entirely, making sure their homes are radon-safe, etc) have much greater outcomes, preserving their excellent general health far longer than their non-healthy counterparts, and having much better resiliency even in extremely advanced age.  There'll come a time when eventually your body's time is naturally up, but if you take good care of yourself, by that time you may find you're ready and without fear. I have had no less than 3 elderly relatives tell me that they were ready to die, they said this without fear and with utter conviction. Not everyone shares that that sentiment at that age, but I find in general by the time you've spent 80 to 100 years on this Earth your fear of leaving it behind is much less than you imagine it when you're still young and looking to the future."

AskDoctorSmeeee,39afzv,Voltairious,25,Wed Jun 10 12:24:11 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Great question.    A couple of months ago, someone asked a question in the same vein, and I'll refer you to that thread here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskDoctorSmeeee/comments/30doxg/smeeee_i_have_a_few_questions_regarding_your/  However, your question is somewhat different.  Before I go on, you mention the backhanded insulting rants towards physicians.  This goes the other way, too, with doctors that don't appreciate their nursing staff.  I have no tolerance for either of these behaviors.  We all have vital roles to play in the healthcare of our patients, and without each other, we'd be lost.  Anyone who doesn't recognize that is hopefully in for a painful reality check some day (hopefully not at the expense of a patient).  Here's what qualities I respect nurses for the most:   Those that I can trust to tell me when someone is sick.  There are certain nurses who will stand by me while I'm doing something, I'll turn around and they'll say ""Dr. Smeeee, I really think you should see this person in room 4"" and I don't just put that on my list of things to do.  I drop what I'm doing, and get my ass to room 4.  Because I know that nurse will only interrupt me if it's important.  I also know nurses who grab me for anything - they don't really ""get it"" -- like a patient with a partial finger amputation, with controlled bleeding.  I was recently grabbed out of a room, telling a patient that hey had appendicitis, because a nurse felt that the partial amputation was more important than a discussion with my patient about his diagnosis.  As time will go on, you will learn what's important and what's not - what's worth interrupting for and not - and who's sick and not sick.   Nurses who have an even keel.  When someone is really sick, it's the worst time to get frantic.  I keep a very even keel while I practice, because I don't want excitement.  If shit's hitting the fan, the last thing you need is someone running around like a chicken with their head cut off.  (The same goes for doctors, btw.  I've seen plenty of ER docs that get frantic.  It doesn't work well)  Again, this is something that comes with practice.  But gasping, and the words ""oh my!"" should never be used when looking at patients.  They don't need to hear it, and they don't need to feel any more panicked than they already are. Don't get angry at the patients for things they can't control.  Patients will come in for dumb reasons sometimes.  They'll have unfortunate consequences that caused them to be in the ER, that we can't make sense of.  Just do your job, and don't complain about it, especially to the patients. Speaking of complaining, don't complain about how busy your shift is in front of patients.  And don't complain to your patients that you haven't had a lunch break yet.  These are conversations to have with your coworkers, in private.  (Yes, I've witnessed this happen, within the last couple of months) Note abnormal vitals and tell the doctor.  Nurses have saved my ass by doing this.  If a patient's about to be discharged, but their blood pressure dropped 20 points systolic since the last check, let the doctor know.  They may say that's ok, but at the same time, it might be a sign of impending doom.  I've discharged a patient once before, and only on review of the chart later, noticed the patient's temp jumped from 98.8 to 102 on discharge vitals and the nurse didn't tell me. Advocate for your doctors.  This obviously has to work both ways.  There is a concept called ""managing up"" where team members speak highly of each other, to build confidence and a sense of teamwork.  This really helps the patient.  Whenever a patient will say something like ""I'm a difficult stick"" I always say ""good thing you have our best nurse""...    Again, most of this stuff will come in time.  But hopefully that gives you some insight.  Good luck on the road ahead!"

AskDoctorSmeeee,39891m,PainMatrix,14,Wed Jun 10 02:19:36 2015 UTC,"so, (/u/smeeee so you're aware that I responded ;), most drugs, including THC, suppress rem sleep, which is about 25% of your sleep cycle. THC also decreases stage 3 sleep (deep sleep). This means that although you may be seemingly sleeping for a long enough period of time, you're not getting an adequate amount of the actual quality sleep your body needs.   So, that may certainly be a factor, but what I advise most people for their sleep issues is that if you're satisfied and it's not causing a disruption don't overly concern yourself. Get checked out by your pcp first and foremost but as long as you're healthy and clear there is a large spectrum of sleep patterns and there is no such thing as normal."
AskDoctorSmeeee,39891m,PainMatrix,3,Wed Jun 10 01:28:12 2015 UTC,"Alcohol has the same effects on REM and deep sleep, but it's even worse for overall sleep architecture because of the withdrawal that occurs several hours in. So, even if you're able to sleep through that (most people with heavy alcohol use are not), the quality of your sleep is going to suffer hugely. If this isn't happening already, it's just a matter of time."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3961fj,Free_Hat_McCullough,5,Tue Jun 9 14:44:45 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  Have you spoken to your doctor regarding your migraines? Ocular migraines are fairly rare and have some key components that lead to a diagnosis. You can't be certain unless you've had an evaluation!  Typically, one key component of ocular migraines is that the vision problems (blurs, kaleidoscopic patterns, vision loss) affect one eye- as opposed to both eyes simultaneously. Now, nothing is ever 100% and I'm not an expert, but this is the basis of my understanding.   Preventative treatment can range from medications (for one small example, antiepileptics) to lifestyle changes. As for pretty much everything in medicine, effective preventative treatment will depend on each person individually.  Here is some information from the Mayo Clinic about some things you can do when you get a migraine, if you'd care to read through it. As always, you should consult your doctor before taking any type of medication. Additionally, you should speak to them about any issues that concern you, as they are equipped to guide you towards an appropriate course of action.  Hope that helps some!"

AskDoctorSmeeee,394ga1,flexorhallucis,5,Tue Jun 9 04:50:46 2015 UTC,"Ok, so the white cells, platelets etc are within normal ranges. The red cells are a little off; despite having more actual red cells than normal, they're smaller (mean corpuscular volume, MCV) and contain less haemoglobin (MCH, mean corpuscular Hb - and corrected, MCHC). This is called microcytic hypochromic anaemia; now your haematocrit is within normal ranges, so anaemia may seem a misnomer, but strictly it refers to the red cells themselves not the blood as a whole.   There's a variety of causes of microcytic hypochromic anaemia;   iron deficiency anaemia in children, thalassaemia sideroblastic anaemia anaemia of chronic disease lead poisoning  B6 / pyridoxine deficiency    Thalassaemia only usually presents in children, but since you are at least a a carrier as we know from your child, this is something to discuss with your doctor. Iron deficiency would usually cause a wide red cell distribution width (RDW, a measure of the variability in RBC size) - yours is at the upper limit of normal, so would also bear investigating. Sideroblastic anaemia is a tricky one, it can be quite variable in how it presents; really it's not something I can tell you about from these results alone. Anaemia of chronic disease is unlikely unless you have, well, a chronic disease!  The others are also quite individually dependant and less likely.  I can't diagnose you with anything, I don't know you and your history and the full lab reports, but hopefully this helps explain these results a bit for you; have a discussion with your doctor when you go in to see them and hopefully they can give you a clearer picture of what's going on!"

AskDoctorSmeeee,392j21,FreakJoe,37,Mon Jun 8 20:00:51 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  Thanks for the question.  It's a pretty loaded question, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few but I'll try to give you some examples.  At the end of the day, the medicine is usually the easy part.  It's the situation, it's telling patients and their loved ones bad news, and it's the emotional drain that make cases difficult, for the most part.   I made this comment a couple months ago that summarizes the most difficult part of my job.   The first difficult case I had was on my emergency medicine rotation in medical school, when EMS brought in a woman that was  shot multiple times by police after she ran towards them with a knife.  It was the same knife that she used to decapitate her two young children moments before.  Leaving your emotions aside is a learned behavior in the ER, and I certainly hadn't learned that skill yet.  I left that shift in tears, and I wasn't sure if I was making the right career choice.   In the same vein, I recently told the following story: ""I remember taking care of a patient once who was shot in the chest after opening fire on a police officer, who succumbed to his injury. We saved his life, even though he killed a cop. Was that morally right? I don't know. But it's not our job to decide that or judge. As long as a patient does not have a DNR order, I have one job, and that's to do my best to preserve life.""   Those are situational things, but those are the types of things that people outside of medicine often don't consider or know about.  These situations drain you emotionally, but you need to quickly realize that there are 20+ other patients in your department that are depending on you as well.  I'll also say that an overly demanding patient can be draining too.  We need to suppress our emotions when it comes to patients that yell at us, or get upset because they've been waiting so long for their papercut (while we were resuscitating someone).  That can create a challenge too.  Just a couple weeks ago, I declined a patient's request for Percocet (she asked by name) for a sprained wrist.  I told her I didn't find it appropriate.  In response, she told me to ""go back to [my] country."" (Mind you, I have been in the US my whole life, and speak better English than she did, with zero accent) Suppressing rage can be exhausting.  I held my head high but moments like that allow thoughts like ""why am I doing this again?"" to creep into your mind.  So again, the challenging cases are mentally and emotionally challenging, for the most part.  The difficult airways, the impossible access, those are nothing compared to the emotional trying cases.  And our emotions are tried often."

AskDoctorSmeeee,3938k3,Wonderpetsgangsta,2,Mon Jun 8 22:58:17 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  I'll be honest, I didn't know anything about intravascular lymphoma before you asked your question.  And I think the reason is that it's 1) a rare disorder and 2) a relatively new diagnosis.    Unfortunately, your mother's timeline seems to be consistent with most patients with intravascular lymphoma - they present with varying symptoms due to circulation being cut off to a specific organ in the body.  So if a patient presents with a stroke, the normal assumption is that a blood clot from platelets has caused the stroke.  But in some rare instances, white blood cells cause the stroke.  Because these cells are usually found in the capillaries, it can be difficult to diagnosis.  Regarding the heredity of it, I cannot find any information, because (I think) the studies are so small.  I assume that if there was a huge hereditary component, it would have been noticed by now, but one has not been reported.  Still, there may be a familial disposition that exists, that we just don't know about yet.  The studies have been done in Asia and in the west, so it doesn't seem to only/mainly present in Asian people.  However, in Asians it appears to manifest more with liver/spleen/bone marrow symptoms, and in the west, it appears to show with more skin findings and neurologic findings (rapidly progressing dementia, strokes, etc).    As far as things to look out for, ""constitutional"" symptoms like fever, night sweats, and weight loss exist in over half of cases.  Additionally, the median age of diagnosis is in the ""6th or 7th decade"" according to UpToDate.  I found a pretty good open article regarding the subject, but hopefully that helps (see link below).  I wish there was more I could tell you, but there just isn't a lot of literature out there.  http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/25/21/3168.long"

AskDoctorSmeeee,39118a,AllRebelRocker,9,Mon Jun 8 13:46:25 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  To clear up some things - hypovolemia can lead to shock, but it's not synonymous.  Hypovolemia just means you don't have much blood volume as your body needs to function properly.  Shock is actually a state where the lack of oxygen delivery to tissues is compromised (which can be due to having severe hypovolemia, along with many other things).  I'm glad your doctor is thinking about a lot of things.  Regarding your question about medications that might slow down your heart rate - you'd be treating the sign, and not the condition that's causing the problem.  That could be devastating.  We almost never treat sinus tachycardia alone.  We look for the underlying cause, and treat that.  I'd be very hesitant about looking for a cure for your tachycardia. Think of it this way - your body is reacting to something by increasing your heart rate to improve cardiac output so your brain can receive oxygen.  If you decrease your heart rate, you'll decrease your cardiac output and you might faint.  Instead, I wonder about something like midodrine which is used for severe orthostatic hypotension, which you may be developing.  That is by no means advice - you may need some more testing to see if orthostatic hypotension is the cause of your symptoms, or something else entirely."

AskDoctorSmeeee,38zi6k,WildBlack,3,Mon Jun 8 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all sunburns are treated palliatively; they heal themselves (not being any more vulnerable to infection, as only a portion of the layers of skin are affected) and treatment focuses simply on reducing discomfort. As such, hydrocortisone creams may be used to reduce inflammation and pain, while calamine lotion can relieve itching that emerges as the burn heals.  Generally no sunburn will ""require"" a doctors visit, as doctors can't do anything to accelerate tissue healing. However many people may find the symptoms of more severe burns to be uncomfortable enough to justify medical intervention to minimize discomfort. Generally the use of anti-inflammatory creams such as hydrocortisone is only suitable if you actually are suffering from inflammation/severe pain, they should not be used automatically without consideration as to whether they are needed.  It's possible that one could sustain a sunburn requiring a hospital visit, though that would only happen if the person was impaired in some way and not simply asleep (as the pain would wake you before critical damage could be done), however in that case you need hospital attention and not just a couple of creams at home. You would know if you were suffering from this, you would literally have severe burns, not just reddened skin with swelling. I have never heard of this actually happening however, nor could I find anything legitimate-seeming via Google."

I remember an awful time when I was young where I burnt so badly my back was literally covered in golf ball-sized blisters. I was sent home with that stuff.
AskDoctorSmeeee,38zi6k,redheadartgirl,0,Wed Jun 10 14:38:31 2015 UTC,"If you have open blisters secreting fluid, an antibacterial ointment would be appropriate (though do not use an antibiotic ointment unless a doctor suspects infection, as they are generally not needed as a preventative measure and their overuse contributes to resistance). However to my knowledge Silvadene (Silver sulfadiazine) is no longer recommended for casual use because it increases the average time required to heal, with very little benefit usually (it's antibacterial activity is not very potent). You may however still find many doctors, particularly older doctors, may still recommend it, and it's up to you to decide whether to go with it. If your doctor strongly urges you take it I would, however if it seems like they're just trying to calm you down by sending you home with something, I'd probably stick to cleaning the area gently with lightly soapy water (a little stinging is normal). Of course if you were to notice a lack of recovery/worsening I'd go right back to the doctor.  Generally for sunburns the healing will happen on it's own, and all that's in your hands is treating the symptoms. Calamine lotion can be awesome for the itching."

I covered my upper body pretty well with sunscreen, but neglected my legs because they never burned badly. Boy was I wrong. The whiter sand and stronger sun from being down south destroyed my legs in a matter of 3 hours. I had severe burns on both legs. Massive blisters appeared the next day, it was agonizing. To make matters worse, I went river rafting the next day. I was only 16 or so, but my uncle gave me moonshine to help with the pain lol. Every blister wound up bursting open in the river. It was absolutely awful.  After that my aunt insisted on taking me to the ER, where they gave me silvadene. It hurt like hell to apply it and looked awful for a month while healing. Thankfully there's no lasting marks, and I am much more careful with sunscreen now."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38zi6k,Birchie,4,Mon Jun 8 15:48:25 2015 UTC,"I like this question!  I'll leave my 2 cents, but I really don't know the answer.  I'll just supply some information about sunburn:  Sunburn is just like any regular, non-grease/oil related burn.  I say this meaning that it can be varying degrees of severity.  Now you aren't going to get 3rd degree sunburn (charred skin), but 2nd degree burns (blistering) aren't a walk in the park.  There isn't a lot in the way of treatment for burns like this, but I believe the biggest concern is infection prevention.  Long story short, they'd probably prescribe an anti-bacterial cream/ointment, or maybe even oral antibiotics.  Now please, someone swoop in here and explain this better, cause I'm really grasping at straws here!"
AskDoctorSmeeee,38zi6k,Gregg_Haus,7,Mon Jun 8 04:19:32 2015 UTC,"I am not a doctor, but I can tell you with certainty that it would be inappropriate and pointless to prescribe antibiotics for a sunburn, unless for some reason it was observably infected (which would be strange, since sunburns usually do not compromise the skin's ability to repel microorganisms, as only a portion of the layers of skin is affected). Prescribing antibiotics would do nothing, as most if not all sunburns by themselves do not get infected (heavy scratching causing wounds could of course lead to infection, but most people will not scratch so hard and persistently). All you'd be accomplishing is furthering antibiotic resistance for nothing.  Likewise an antibacterial cream would be useless, though not harmful as assuming it does not use specific antibiotics (instead using a more simple bacteriacide like some kind of metal preparation ala zinc, or a damagine solvent)."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38zi6k,GetOutOfBox,6,Mon Jun 8 09:08:52 2015 UTC,"You may not be a doctor, but this is completely accurate.    Just the other day I had a patient who came in for a sunburn.

I felt really bad, it was a waste of time for her, but there's really not much more we do.    I've never even given silvadene to a sunburn before, since most are first degree anyway."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38zi6k,Smeeee,0,Mon Jun 8 15:02:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah my thought is that unless you were somehow impaired (extreme alcohol intoxication, knocked out by something, etc) you'd never allow a sunburn to get past the 1st degree.

I'm curious, is it no longer considered effective? What has taken its place?  We still have a tiny bit left and whenever I burn myself while cooking I apply some and the pain is gone within 10 minutes. As far as I'm concerned, it's a miracle cream!  Edit: I read about it on Wikipedia. The trials may have not shown efficacy (actually, trials have apparently shown a delay in healing of wounds) but that was not our experience.

I unfortunately can't tell you specifically why your doctor may have changed his tune, but I can tell you the following:   Endone (oxycodone) is a powerful narcotic that can be used for acute pain.  It may be suitable for chronic pain relief in a small number of people, but overall, it should not be used for too long.   Yes, it is very possible that you are addicted to the pain medication.  The fact that you've increased the amount you've needed despite having no new injuries/infections means your body is likely developing a tolerance to the medication.     /u/PainMatrix is very well versed in these types of medications, and actually made a very enlightening post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskDoctorSmeeee/comments/2xd5eq/ive_noticed_that_quite_a_few_questions_on_here/  I encourage you to watch the video and read the little blurb from him I copied and pasted.

AskDoctorSmeeee,38t02z,Hystus,7,Sat Jun 6 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"Tetanus is caused by a toxin produced by several strains of bacteria. The body responds to a version of tetanus that has been rendered inert the same way it tries to fight the real thing: by producing an antitoxin.  Tetanus is not just from rusty nails as so many think either--it's present pretty much everywhere, and you can get it from even a small scratch. However, you are much more likely to get it from a deeper puncture wound, as tetanus is anaerobic(does not like oxygen).  EDIT: to answer the second part of your question as to how it works after the wound, tetanus takes time before onset--the infection essentially has to leach into your blood stream over the course of a week or so. A tetanus shot can preempt and start your body's production of the anti toxin if it is given quickly enough."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38t02z,rehtulx,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:09:00 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, is Tetanus a toxin or a bacterial strain?  Is the 'tetanus shot' a vaccine against the bacteria producing tetanus toxin, or is it something which helps destroy the tetanus toxin directly.     I'm thinking of a toxin as a, possibly huge, passive molecule, as opposed to a live bacteria."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38t02z,rehtulx,4,Sat Jun 6 20:26:53 2015 UTC,"C. Tetani bacteria produces as a byproduct of reproducing a neurotoxin. By exposing you an inert, harmless form of the bacteria, you are being exposed to its' proteins as well--of which the neurotoxin causing tetanus are made up of."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38t02z,rehtulx,3,Sat Jun 6 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"I had to look this up in Dorlands' Medical Dictionary...the specific neurotoxin it produces that causes the symptoms is called tetanospasmin.  Tetanus can be BRUTAL and horrifying to watch--I've never seen it, but the spasms it causes can be so violent as to cause compound bone fractures. There is also no blood test to diagnose it--probably not because we can't make one, but rather because its' been eliminated in the developed world for so long it just isn't profitable to."

AskDoctorSmeeee,38rvj9,synpulse,5,Sat Jun 6 07:28:58 2015 UTC,"Mmkay I'll try and address this one step at a time since you've got a lot going on!  The symptoms you've been describing are consistent with hyperthyroidism.  How long has this been happening for? Did it come on gradually or suddenly? Anything make it better or worse?  Any other past medical history?  How old are you, what gender, and where in the world?  The sensation of having a lump in your throat is called 'globus sensation'.  It's common, and has a huge variety of causes. It's distressing, but if it's not restricting breathing or swallowing then it's unlikely to be anything requiring evaluation emergently.  It sounds like you're very worried.  Have you had any problems with anxiety in the past?  Your statement that you ""[felt] like I was having trouble breathing until I remembered that I have lungs"" makes me think that this could be a product of being very anxious about all the tests you've been having and these sensations, which is actually quite common;  we've all had a ""frog in our throat"" during high-stress or emotion situations, and if there is an element of hyperthyroidism, that can of course cause or exacerbate anxiety and nervousness in itself.    A goitre is unlikely to cause any airway problems unless it's really quite large, and is a rare event in itself, so unless you walked into clinic and your doc went ""wow that's a big one"" that's unlikely to be the cause.  What does your neck look like at the moment by the way?  In the meantime, if this is concerning you then do speak to your doctor / clinic; they're the ones who saw you and know your full background! Lay off whatever you're getting high on for the time being if you feel it's making the sensations worse.  Regarding treatment, it's not something that needs super-urgent treatment, although if the results come back showing you are hyperthyroid, then hopefully they'll make arrangements for that to be treated promptly.  It's unlikely to be something that would be impacted by waiting the three days.    Hope this helps explain a bit; if you could answer those questions it would help give a slightly clearer picture!"

Pretty much what happened is I got high off a dab last Tuesday, which did trigger an anxiety attack due to not eating well for the past 3-4 weeks. After that I just started feeling sweating, shakiness, nervousness, heart beating faster.  And past symptoms which aren't a problem anymore -- like not being able to eat hardly anything without being full quick, brief morning nausea -- again, I don't have these symptoms anymore. I eat just fine now (can't get SUPER full just yet. That'll keep me up tossing and turning at night) but I can eat pretty well. Getting high also helped with the appetite. Although i'm only smoking fresh bud. And definitely helps with falling asleep.  Yes, I'm a hypochondriac. I have been healthy all my life, and this sudden onset has brought unfamiliar stress and symptoms, breakdowns, anxiety, etc. My mother is also a very anxious woman so I know where I get it from.

Although rare, if left untreated, you can actually get permanent nasal deformities as a result.  If the blood has nowhere to go (as in your case, with no external bleeding), these become more likely.

AskDoctorSmeeee,38mokw,Fletch71011,10,Fri Jun 5 05:12:24 2015 UTC,"I believe it's because the spine serves a lot of complicated functions-- it is load-bearing, it's a muscle attachment point, it articulates with your ribs, and perhaps most importantly it protects your spinal cord.  The spinal cord issue is a huge one. Nerves can be very difficult to see even on a cadaver, and your spinal nerves (dorsal root ganglion, communicating veins, transforaminal ligaments) are exiting the spinal column through the intervertebral foramina-- the holes created when one vertebra sits on top of another.  I think we can remove an entire vertebra, though it'd be a huge, delicate procedure with a long healing time. I also think we can replace the intervertebral discs, though with artificial replacements. I'd be wary about getting proper placement and the lifetime of the disc, though. What happens if you have to get the surgery again? What if it's off a bit?  Cadaver discs would carry a risk of rejection, and who wants their immune system waging a war so near their spinal cord?"

So here is the deal. Your doctor saying that your HDL was ""The highest he has ever seen"" is more than likely true. I've never seen one that high either. I would take it at face value. ""It's the highest he's ever seen"".   (as a reference point, most people should be above 40...the highest i've seen is 102)   He more than likely wasn't inferring anything, just surprised. I do have some other questions like what was your LDL? Did he run more in depth tests to see what the size of your particles were, or was this just a normal screen?   Do you know your family history? That's a pretty big factor in cholesterol.   In the meantime think about it this way. Yes, having a lot of HDL is a good thing, and can keep your blood vessels clean. Buuuuuut too much of anything can be a detriment at some point.   HDL/LDL are carriers of particles pretty much. The higher the numbers, the ""more cars on the road"" per say. So if you have a whole bunch of ""vehicles"" there is a higher chance of an incident. The good thing is, most of your cars are driven by robots and are much less likely to cause issues.   Just because people have good cholesterol counts doesn't eliminate them from risk, just lowers it.

If your doctor thinks you're good, I would trust it. He/she is a doctor, and while I study cholesterol tests every day, I'm no doctor. If you feel like another test should be done, get it. Those tests are a snapshot in time.  As someone who sees these every day and talks with people, I would say get another, and if it's still that high just be happy you're on the good side of the cholesterol issue. It's better to have high hdl rather than ldl no matter the size of particle.   You're relatively young at mid 40's and barring family history...  I'd ride the wave.

It depends on the patient/dentist/procedure/etc. Not everyone is going to have Nitrous or a benzo, not everyone is going to be put under. Local anesthetics are also used.

AskDoctorSmeeee,38ivnp,Smeeee,2,Fri Jun 5 14:59:22 2015 UTC,"I would bet money on David having had Versed/midazolam.  I did this for a few years and would orally sedate up to 5 or 6 kids a day.  We would give a ""drink"" of Versed based on the child's weight and mix it with something to mask the awful taste (think battery acid) like chocolate syrup (the irony), coke, or juice.    It would take a while for the kid to take effect and they would become loopy like David.  Amnesia and disorientation would happen. The best kids would sleep or get sleepy - but kids can crash quickly so this was also a little scary (even with monitors and a nurse).    9/10 times this would work effectively but 1/10 the kid refused to drink the drink or would have a ""paradoxical effect"" (see when David screams out of frustration) and they couldn't chill out.  This would often end the case.  Many pediatric specialists use ""papoose boards"" to strap the kids down as a result.  It's not as bad as it sounds since the child usually didn't remember a thing - and most were compliant enough.  Because of the inherent risk and challenge and my refusal to strap the kids down, I hired a medical anesthetist to put the kids out under GA and have never looked back.  The kids are often discharged home after as the effects wear off and since they were breathing on their own and were not unconscious, won't slip deeper and die.  Under anesthesia, the child is essentially kept on life support (ventilator or assisted breathing) during the case, thus must be monitored to ensure all vitals are stable before leaving.  In Canada, Versed is the norm as is many places in the States.  Some programs in the US use ketamine and chloral hydrate as suggested above."

I was recorded in the same way, and the reaction was just as hilarious, with more expletives involved (my mouth fucking HURTS, did they break my jaw?!) and other fun phrases.

AskDoctorSmeeee,38ivnp,GetOutOfBox,0,Thu Jun 4 16:57:28 2015 UTC,"General anesthetic is only given for dental surgery, to keep patients calm during the procedure. General anesthetic is still definitely used wherever you are, because some dental surgeries are way too messy for the average patient to want to be conscious. Lots of gross visuals and uncomfortable tugging sensations.  I don't see why you think people shouldn't be sent home with a friend/family after being sedated; most of the time they're quite functional (can walk, etc), just a bit intoxicated for 30 mins to an hour. If they were alone they'd be kept until they'd fully recovered their senses."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38ivnp,theneen,0,Thu Jun 4 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"No it's not that I don't think they should be sent home, just that I've never seen or heard of such a reaction in my country, so I'm assuming it must be different drugs or different practices. I'm not criticizing anything, I just noticed that all of those videos seem to come from America."

I can't tell you for sure, but I'm wondering if you possibly just contracted the virus, and haven't had time to create antibodies yet. The rise in your alt/ast may be due to acute infection, but yes, could have been due to the local inflammation after surgery."

That is exactly what I thought ... it even fits quite well with the timetable and when I suspect I was exposed (I guess I got an extra special gift from the ER) but I was unable to get any sort of explanation from my GP.  The change in attitude towards me after the diagnosis has been kind of eye-opening/shocking ...   I'd be angry even if I had contracted it through reckless behavior, I was under the impression there was some kind of oath .. ethics or somesuch ..., though considering my personality and lifestyle I'm not sure how anyone could draw that conclusion."

AskDoctorSmeeee,38iqri,miiitchhh,6,Thu Jun 4 14:13:08 2015 UTC,"We can't really diagnose you on here (Rule 1).  One big thing that comes to mind with the overweight is sleep apnea, though.  It's something you could ask your doctor about.  23 is a little young for anything diabetes related, but it's not unheard of.  Bottom line is go see your doctor.  There's a LOT more to consider than the 2 things I mentioned..."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38iqri,Gregg_Haus,2,Thu Jun 4 19:30:43 2015 UTC,"This has kinda been me for years. Occasionally get a general feeling of unwellness, nausea, tiredness. Stomach seems restless.  I've been looking hard at my diet recently. It wasn't a bad diet I had, but I started cutting out food groups to see if I had some allergies I didn't know about. Cutting out dairy didn't do much, but I've stopped eating gluten for a month and I do seem to be a bit better overall.  Unfortunately my GP wouldn't take me seriously at all and wouldn't give me any blood tests to confirm or dismiss anything. You might want to see if you can get some tests done if your doctor is more willing."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38iqri,birdontophat,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:30:39 2015 UTC,"What worked for me was a dietary change and to move to a different house, turned out there was some hidden mold in my former house, so I over time developed a mold sensitivity, that on top of some digestion issues, caused me to have a situation that reminds a bit of yours.  Had to get rid of my papers/books and wash my clothes at very high temperatures, to get it out of my belongings, the only things that remained OK, were stuff with hard surfaces.  The way I discovered it, was that I often felt a lot better when I was away from my home, at home I felt ill and felt like shit when I had slept there.  The diet I now follow is the low FODMAP diet, but that might not be one you'd benefit from."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38iqri,Purgatoryonlegs,2,Sat Jun 6 19:47:40 2015 UTC,"Good call, as of yesterday I started a diet. I'm cutting out soda completely and trying to lower calories and lose weight. Gonna be eating a lot more salad and veggies and less high-carb processed food. I am not normally 193 lbs, my normal weight is in the 155-160 range, but life at the new job has made healthy meals harder. I've only been this weight for about 9-12 months and it seems that it could be the issue."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38iqri,Purgatoryonlegs,0,Sun Jun 7 00:53:35 2015 UTC,"Definitely a good place to start! :)  Consider making lunch boxes which you bring from home.  In my own experience, sugar and too many food additives are the things to watch out for, fat is less bad.  I got a better and stronger looking body from just eating right, my diet is a bit extreme though.  I eat   carrots potatoes radish eggs fish low fat cows meat or chicken   lactose free dairy products  a little bit of cheese lots of spices lemon juice sunflower oil and coconut oil peppermint tea and ginger tea   I completely avoid flours/bread, fruit most of the time and some vegetables.  I eat this way cos it works and is cheap."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38iqri,Purgatoryonlegs,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:51:26 2015 UTC,"Sounds similar to my diet, except I try to avoid potato an other high carb things like bread and macaroni. I'm going to slowly start exercising but because I'm so out of shape I dont want to push it."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38iqri,Purgatoryonlegs,2,Sun Jun 7 16:00:34 2015 UTC,"I don't excercise a whole lot.  What I do is I walk a LOT, as in, between ½-6 hours a day, depending how much free time I have, how much I feel like it, and if I could actually do my tasks by just walking instead of taking e.g. the bus.  Sometimes I also excercise my chest/back a little, but mainly I just walk a lot.  Last week I went to played basketball with some friends, will see if that turns into an occasional excercise too, but for the first 1½-2 years, I mainly walked, though have done a little bit of running and bicycling earlier.  EDIT:  What I like about walking, is that I can continue doing it for a very long time.  My right foot is partially fucked up, so if I run too much, it will hurt, but walking doesn't do that to it."

AskDoctorSmeeee,38kfoi,thetotesmcgoats1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:16:00 2015 UTC,"In the UK, it would be regarded as a poor and non-evidence-based choice to start with Crestor.    Zocor used to be the first-line treatment.  Nowadays the guidance has changed and we recommend Lipitor as a first line drug (20mg if you're trying to prevent cardiovascular disease, 80mg if you already have it).  It used to be that we switched to Crestor for the lipid profiles that weren't fully optimised on the other statins, but the evidence for doing this isn't even great.  The National Institute of Clinical Excellence has issued evidence-based guidance on statins.  So yeah it's the UK, but at least that should inform you that it's perfectly fine for patients to ask for Lipitor instead."

AskDoctorSmeeee,38fjc1,Gregg_Haus,10,Wed Jun 3 21:45:30 2015 UTC,"I saw this and thought it could spark a good discussion, so I crossposted it here.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this subject?  It seems really odd that they'd create a situation where medicare payouts are increased.  From my experience, Medicare will do anything they can to not pay for stuff, right?"

AskDoctorSmeeee,38exwa,storybookknight,3,Wed Jun 3 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"Well 5.7 is still ok. The hba1c normally gives you an overview of the amount of  sugar attached to red bloodcells. A value of 5.7 basically means that 5.7 percent of the cells have sugardudes attached to them around 5 is considered a normal, healthy value. Typical for Type 2 Diabetes is around 6.5 to 7.5 (or in another way to write it 48 to 58 mmol/molHb). But this value alone is not a good way to say if something is wrong with her bloodsugar. It changes also based on a lot of external influences, and a lot of other factors. From my point of view there should be nothing wrong with her, but as always let the Doctor check it the next time she sees one and get all other bloodsugar relevant value checked."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38exwa,Samuelcolt,2,Wed Jun 3 19:57:44 2015 UTC,"This is my non-medical professional opinion but there seems to be a variety of opinions on pre-diabetes based on the A1C. Basically the idea is that it's able to do a 3 month snapshot of your blood sugar level. Where you draw the line of normal and pre-diabetic seemed to be a bit of a grey area. Bottom line, this may be something she wants to seek medical advice on.  I had a physical done through my employer and my A1C came back a 5.4 (with a fasting sugar blood sugar of 93). I have diabetes in my family so I'm taking action prevent it from getting any worse.  Getting older isn't very fun."
AskDoctorSmeeee,38exwa,Goatey,2,Wed Jun 3 20:28:20 2015 UTC,"Indeed there is a variety on approaches to this topic, it does measure a median of the last 90-120 days (the lifespan of the red bloodcells) on the sugar level by the method said above. It is a great value to compare Progress on and see how well a Diabetic is adjusted with his medication. But from my pov it is not worth a lot of left alone. Therefore my advice is not to worry too much about it and have it checked. ;) But normally my area of the body is the face, not the blood ;-)"
