reflex,3e5tia,narzdy,9,Wed Jul 22 04:33:04 2015 UTC,"As the following shots will make pretty clear, we've decided to change art style again. This time, we've opted for a stylized, deliberately low-poly, faceted, textureless look and it comes with a ton of advantages for both developers and players. Over the course of development, we've had as much praise for our minimalistic, dev-texture look as we have for the high detail art and we think the new theme finds a good balance between those two looks. As a bonus, it will also unify the standard/high-vis system into a single, clear, unique look.   Yes!"

reflex,3e5tia,Laggyzaki,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:14:06 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for the devs but:  The way the engine handles lighting is in development and there will probably be some improvements further down the line. If a map seems to dark for you, you can delete the lightmap information by typing r_lm_clear in the console.  To get the lightmap back you'll have to rebuild it with r_lm_build which will take a couple of minutes.  One of the big features of Reflex is the ease of map editing, it's already resulting in hundreds of player made maps. The player made maps which will rise in popularity will tend to be the most well made and balanced ones, those will most likely have appropriate lighting for competition."

If you're getting 70-80 fps, it'll be taking 70-80 samples of your input every second which is very low. We're meant to have framerate independent input of 1000 samples/sec.

I'm on Windows 8.1. I was able to install it following this guide, and it seems to be enabled (when I go to Device Manager it's the only driver under my Mouse, and the driver mentioned is the active, and only, driver showing). Unfortunately making any changes have no effect. I've ensured that the profile I'm editing is active, I've saved the changes, and I've saved the profile... no dice. If I make changes to the Mouse properties in Control Manager those changes do actually change things. I'm not sure if that's relevant or not, but it's what's happening.  I've tried using the configuration editor .exe file that comes with the driver and I've tried editing the registry directly. I've also tried rebooting after making changes, all to no avail. Halp? :("

Obviously it isn't, though, so that may be a problem. Povo's guide says ""If you do not sign the drivers, your cursor will lock in place, device manager will give you a code 37 ..."" which is not happening, which is why I think the fact that the installed drive is unsigned is not the issue. Could be wrong though. Other than that I followed the installation procedures entirely :("

reflex,3du4ds,Ninjatomte,4,Sun Jul 19 14:16:43 2015 UTC,"If you can't get to the forum post, this is the text of it.   It's a combination of the following:   Apheleon's Timer Timeline (modified so Green Armors don't show up for this widget, added a few names of armors per map) KovTimers2 (stock timers, but modified so ONLY Green Armors show up here) AccelMeter, hacked apart from PHGP ReflexRun.  When you are holding forward and a strafe, this widget displays a thin transparent green line that represents the optimal angle you should be facing to gain the most speed. ArmorBar_gls from Gliss HealthBar_gls from Gliss WeaponRack_gls from Gliss (modified so when you are low on ammo for RL, IC, or BR those ammos flash.  If you are low on other ammos, it only flashes if you currently have those weapons selected) GrenadeTimer by me Mega Health Tracker by me EZQuake style Speedometer by me KovCrosshairs which is a simple hack of the stock Crosshairs.lua to make crosshair 2 a smaller version of crosshair 1.  My config uses that smaller crosshair for IC and BR. MiniScores.lua by Bonuspunkt (the scoreboard at the top right corner)   So, without further ado, Download the package Here.  If you want to use start from my configuration, http://pastebin.com/sCmHZKmc is the latest.  I run my game at 1280x720, and everything scales fine to 1920x1080.  If you just want to copy the UI stuff, copy and paste from line 120 down to the bottom into your own config (be sure to make a backup before you do that).  Installation instructions:   Download/Extract the above zip to your SteamApps\common\Reflex\base\internal\ui\widgets directory.  Note that Reflex checks for new .lua files only on being run, so you can't be in game when you extract (Optional) - copy my UI settings from my configuration file into your own config (SteamApps\common\Reflex\game.cfg). Start Reflex.  UI stuff should be there.  If you didn't copy my UI settings into your config file, you'll need to go into your options -> widgets menu to enable and position addons as you please.

reflex,3du4ds,ginzberg,3,Sun Jul 19 14:20:41 2015 UTC,I have to add that it was also your ui that beat me and not only your ping advantage! //Holi
reflex,3du4ds,shootermans,2,Sun Jul 19 15:28:52 2015 UTC,I feel like an old-timer when I first learned the euros were using full bright skins in QW.... this timer is accepted as not cheating?? Does it depend on an action by the player (a la old czm-inspired tdm timers) or require line-of-site/audio range... or does it actually capture the whole map's inventory of key items?  also - hijacking slightly... am on windows for first time in like 20  years and bought Reflex when it was on sale a few weeks back.. haven't played yet. What's the lowest impact way to get into the game at the moment?
reflex,3du4ds,rpRj,2,Sun Jul 19 17:48:13 2015 UTC,"Heya ginz, been a while :).  I'll try to keep this brief, but the history of the timer is that when the devs wanted to add LUA scripting to their UI, they knew it would be possible to do something like this.  Newborn/fleabitten also stated that he would like to try it as an experiment in gameplay and see how it plays.  So, they added timers to the base HUD, but it isn't presented as cleanly as the timer that Apheleon wrote.  There is a discussion on timers practically every week (or every few days on IRC).  Personally, I think they are a good thing since they lower the barrier to entry for the genre.  It also lets people focus on tactics more, so you see a lot more hard reads.  Many people disagree with me, but I don't know what the actual community opinion is on it.  Currently all audio is game-wide.  I wouldn't mind seeing the system changed so that you have to observe an item being grabbed to know it's respawn time.  Also of note, the devs have stated that there will be a ""callvote lockhud"" feature that forces only approved HUDs/UI elements to be used.  That mode will specify no timers.  I think it's silly to introduce a rift between starting players and competition...  As for lowest impact, any game mode now is good.  With the steam sale, there are way more people than usual, so you can get your feet wet a lot easier.  Race mode on reflexjump.map is great for practicing jumps.  FFA and ATDM (clan arena) are good for learning maps/weapons."

Development is active and if you look in the forums you see some pretty neat stuff in the scripting and mapping area going on. No dead end at the moment.
reflex,3drzal,ponyeater,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:15:51 2015 UTC,Right now there's not that many active players but I almost never have a problem finding a game in EU. I usually just jump into an empty server and alt tab until someone joins which is usually a minute or two.  Matchmaking is meant to be coming soon™ which will help a lot.
reflex,3drzal,Stalast,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:36:29 2015 UTC,"Where are you at? In the states it's okay, but it depends on how good you are.  If you've been playing for years and are actually good at quake there's pretty much always a game going on.  If you're brand new there's a decent amount of ffas and other new players, but expect to get wrecked because there's no way to tell how good someone is before you play them.  Mid level is a wasteland of stomping new players who quit after a game, or getting stomped by good players who quit after two games. Basically if you don't friend people on Steam you're going to get sick of it really fast.  Anyways I pretty much always have the server browser open to see if people are on, and just end up playing Quake Live half the time anyways, but when you can get a good game Reflex is cool."

If you enjoy arena shooters you will definitely have some fun. Yes, the player base is very small but you will always find some players playing tdm/ca or duels. There are 200-300 people in the IRC channel (#reflex on quakenet), many willing to play. At least that's my experience (being European).   The game will definitely not die soon because the devs keep updating it regularly (in contrast to the Quake Live devs who are just a bit shit in general)."

reflex,3clrat,Mitritch,10,Mon Jul 13 03:31:25 2015 UTC,"Lol, I wanted to make a post here about adding ultra-noob-friendly FFA mode during which player has all the weapons from the start. But I wanted to wait a bit after my last post. Nevertheless, your post is good opportunity, so...  What I dislike in current affa, is that it plays totally different than ffa:   not as dynamic, as conventional ffa. During conventional ffa you can reach meditation-like state constantly running through enemies, tearing them apart, in affa you are always put out of the zone after you've being killed, because you have to wait for the start of the round to play. no item pickups. I want to learn map by playing usual FFA and picking up armor, health and weapon items. all players start with maxed out health and armor. So there are no cheap but so rewarding frags from one bolt or from single midair rocket at the begining of the round. Maybe I'm overstretching here, but never mind. :)   What I would like to propose, is to add following mode, which combines good points of both FFA and AFFA and which has following features:   there are no rounds, match length is 10 minutes; player starts with all the weapons present on the map; player has usual starting health; items are present on the map and can be picked up;   This way noobs like me can learn weapon usage in arbitrary situations, learn the map and have tons of fun.   Again, it could be because of my inclination to look for simple solutions of complex problems, but at least we can try it. :)"
reflex,3clrat,phipb,2,Wed Jul 8 23:09:29 2015 UTC,"What I really like about the AFFA mode and just in general those kinds of modes are the clutch situations and making the first kill count, just like in csgo.  I'm really not sure on the health pickups and other pickups though. Seems to me it would make it way too random. Perhaps have the pickups be on a timer from the start.  You have to consider that in AFFA you're going for rounds so the slightest fuck up or randomness can really screw your whole team over.   edit: I'm an idiot, I was talking about CA here. But this stuff somewhat applies to AFFA.  Perhaps then introducing some kind of economy system like csgo where you can snowball with your team so the better team could win more rounds, dunno. It will make the games longer though.  Edit: I'm not exactly sure what you mean by no rounds?"
reflex,3clrat,naeshen,2,Thu Jul 9 10:16:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is pretty much my opinion. This game mode would be so awesome, and what I indeed miss in affa is that meditative feel of just being in the flow of jumping around and killing. In there arena you spend so much time waiting if you suck, which I find very frustrating."
reflex,3clrat,quakeid,0,Wed Jul 8 23:14:12 2015 UTC,"I also believe FFA with full load outs ( all weapons ) should be in the game, or at least the way quake live added it. However, a lot of the hardcore q1/qw/q3/cpm/etc fans were hugely dissapointed by the inclusion of the ability to chose a weapon you could spawn with in quake live FFA.   My opinion is that the devs should just include a ffa-loadouts mode or something. People would be able to ""callvote mode ffa-loadouts"" and if it's voted then everyone (hmm, the majority :) ) is happy.   It's always a balance between pleasing the hardcore arena fps players and welcoming as many noobs as possible. A lot could be said about this subject but I don't want to write a novel here. Most games today are really newbie friendly and that is part of why they succeed, so in my opinion reflex should also try to somehow appeal to the average fps player ( used to cod or something, maybe never played quake ) but manage to not annoy old cpm guys."

I know it's on the way, but to add better default tools for UV mapping/texturing now will help so people won't have to redo old maps, and videos that get put out will look sexier.

reflex,3as6jp,Spannzer,3,Tue Jun 23 16:08:11 2015 UTC,Smilecythe posted this on the official forums after I asked for a straight land strafe jumping map.  http://www.reflexfps.net/forums/index.php?/topic/2674-rrsmile1-flat-straferun-map/  It seems like the best way to strafe jump is to do two jumps on side and two jumps the other side. I have a problem alternating one jump on one side to one jump on the other side.  It almost seems like you have to 'cut' the vector of your current velocity by like a 15-30 degree angle. So alternating left/right/left/right is a bit harder to judge then left/left/right/right. Because you just move your mouse a little bit.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
reflex,3as6jp,HappySlice,3,Tue Jun 23 12:13:32 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, if the quickest route to the end is a perfect straight line, you want to be strafing as close to that as possible, so technically alternating from side to side on each jump is going to be the quickest, that is if you can make your cursor movement perfectly quick and precise on each landing/jump, then you could achieve this  But realistically speaking the alternating left/left/right/right is better because it gives a good amount of allowance for human reaction/movement and precision and thus allows a good balance between time spent strafing (acceleration/turning), time spent switching (finding that correct angle) and being close to the straightest possible line.  rrsmile1 is great, I much prefer it to regular strafe pads, but ofcourse it is much more forgiving."

reflex,3as6jp,dansendansen,2,Wed Jun 24 21:51:04 2015 UTC,"I don’t think low or high dpi makes a difference. Trying to set it to your mouse’s default is more important because that’s the value it will perform probably the best under. Tweak actual sens with the ingame setting. As for sensitivity, it is quite subjective. But anything <10cm/360 and >50cm/360 is usually considered extreme. I found that my shaft (ion cannon) gets better the lower my sens is (>30cm/360 for decent shaft control), but that makes me shit at anything else (rockets/bolt/movement...). Proper accel settings are to come."
reflex,3as6jp,mizzu704,3,Tue Jun 23 12:01:21 2015 UTC,"Pretty good advice for sensitivities and aim.  One minor subject to jump on that most people don't seem aware of: low DPI is less than ideal with mouse acceleration.  Say you have 400 DPI at 1000hz and you use povohat's mouse acceleration driver to make a curve that you like.  The driver is reading inputs from the mouse that are effectively ""I moved to the right two dots and down one dot.""  With low DPI and a high USB refresh rate, you're only going to ever trigger very low dot counts, like say less than 10 (realistically less than 6-8 unless you are whipping your mouse around).  That means your entire mouse acceleration curve is jam packed into less than 10 real sensitivities that step from one to the next as you go faster.  If you go to a higher DPI, your mouse will report a wider range of dots per update, which means you can spread your acceleration curve out across a wider range.  The wider range of accel means that you have a smoother transition in sensitivity changes at different speeds of moving the mouse.  The only case where you don't want a higher DPI for mouse acceleration is where your mouse sensor fails to detect movement properly at high DPI."
reflex,3as6jp,champaignthrowaway,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:07:52 2015 UTC,Sensitivity is subjective.  DPI depends on your mouse.  Some perform better at their native DPI.

reflex,3alngn,fckthwrld91,6,Sun Jun 21 12:46:58 2015 UTC,Entik did a pretty good video on it
reflex,3alngn,phipb,5,Sun Jun 21 16:37:55 2015 UTC,"Circle and strafe jumping. For the principles, refer to this video (I recommend watching it a few times to really grasp what is going on). Basically, rotating your accel vector (where you’re pointing your model towards with WASD and the mouse) at a certain angle to the vector of your actual movement (where your model is actually flying/running towards) gives you a speed increase.    Air control (aka ""bunnyhopping""). Lets you turn in midair, provided you already have some speed. To turn left in midair, press left (without forwards) and move your crosshair to the left. Done right (not moving mouse too fast, not to tight a curve etc.), you will change your direction of movement without a speed loss (in fact, you slightly accelerate). Alternatively, you can also press forward instead of left/right and just turn around, but it’s not as slick as using the strafe keys. There are some situations tho where it is more useful.     For example Jumping - how do ""far"" jumps, double or triple jumps work? I must have something to do with stairs :/   Stair jumping, tele jumping, double and triple jumping all refer to the same base mechanic: If you manage to jump twice within a time frame of 400miliseconds, the second jump will be noticeably higher. Stairs and teleporters are the best possibilities to achieve this. They give you a way to stand on a jumpable surface right after performing a jump, because both cancel out that first jump (stairs are a bit finicky). And in both cases the first jump is not really used for anything. Tele jump example of how to do it: you stand in front of a teleporter. You move forwards to enter it and right before you enter, you jump. Just after that (literally a few ms later) you obviously enter the tele and you’re at a new location, on the ground (= a jumpable surface). If you press jump right after exiting the tele, or to be exact, <400ms after the first jump, you will get more height from that second jump. Now, to actually gain an advantage from the height, players perform a circle jump within the 400ms time window to have a faster movement speed after the second jump. This combination of mechanics lets you travel distances that would not be possible with a normal circle jump. Triple jumps basically give you a second 400ms time window after the second jump, and if you manage to do a third jump in that, you go really high. As of now, people have mainly used this mechanic to quickly reach high points in maps.     This video offers a good overview. Note how the stake gun lets you basically create a double jump at every wall."
reflex,3alngn,mizzu704,8,Sun Jun 21 14:37:55 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTx_rpSX2rs  That's a stream I did with Nekon a while back in CPMA, in which the movement mechanics are 95% the same as Reflex.   I would recommend you check that out first to get a good overview on everything that is possible. After that, you can start asking more specific questions  Also you could try just jumping on race servers and asking people if they could help you with something you're having problems with.  The main differences going from CPMA to Reflex   You can't ""wall clip"", as in pass through a corner of a wall going at high speeds Stepup is less forgiving, you will lose speed if you jump at a ledge, while in CPMA you would have ""glided"" through There is triple jump   Need confirmation on this by someone who is more experienced with Reflex     I THINK you do not lose your acceleration by holding jump, so you can press it way before you land   In CPMA you would lose a bunch of acceleration if you press jump in the air, so the optimal way would be to hit jump just as you land."
reflex,3alngn,db_mew,6,Sun Jun 21 12:55:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely recommend this video! It is what taught me mostly. Especially if you load up b0 (the map) and go through the map with the video.  And yes, you don't lose speed if you hold jump."
reflex,3alngn,Mannmilch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:42:42 2015 UTC,"To be specific, you didn't lose speed in CPMA either, but your maximum acceleration was lower when holding jump. And if you pressed down jump in mid air, your acceleration would pretty much stop completely."

(As for movement advice, I just link to entik's video, which has already been posted here.)"
reflex,3alngn,matt_au,2,Mon Jun 22 01:22:29 2015 UTC,"It's pretty neat stuff.  So, by ""far"" jumping I assume you mean circle/strafe jumping. There should be a speed monitor widget in the options somewhere, if you use that, you'll notice that when you go forward, you go at a max speed of 320, but when you turn in accordance with your movement keys, you'll break the 320 cap. ""far"" jumping as you call it is simply combining this turn motion with a jump, allowing you to carry that speed into numerous movements. And it's not just a thing in Reflex either. It's even a thing in many of the Call of Duty games. You can use it to get to some pretty fun places once you get a good feel for it, especially in CoD4.  I'm not sure exactly how Double Jumps work (still struggling with Stair Jumps myself), but they are timed; basically, if you jump twice in a certain amount of time, then some momentum from your first jump is converted into extra jump height for your second jump, as I understand it. However, you can only double jump using certain objects like blocks and stairs, since the double jump window closes by the time you land just jumping in an empty space. Double jumps are also in Quake 3 CPM, but Triple Jumps are totally new to Reflex. I'm completely unsure of how those work, mechanically speaking.  So, most jump types are simply applying the double jump idea to various objects in the game, like stairs, blocks, low roofs, and teleporters. Anything you can do to throw an extra jump in before that double jump window expires, pretty much."

reflex,39q76r,tccrist,4,Sat Jun 13 18:06:23 2015 UTC,"Reflex has already killed Quake Live for me. CPM/Reflex's movement mechanics are vastly superior.   Also, I agree that the stake gun should be a default weapon, but you forgot to mention that it's already the best weapon in the game!"
reflex,39q76r,doombro,10,Sat Jun 13 23:31:58 2015 UTC,"So basically you're saying you can only hold 1 weapon at a time? I don't think you realize how stupid of an idea this is..  Alt-fires, sure, but making the alt-fire for example basically shoot the same type of stuff like rockets but instead making it weaker and introducing some pointless gimmick (guided missiles) is not the way to do it.   Reverse-knockback shotgun Rockets bounce once off of walls etc   These also seem kinda gimmicky. If rockets were to bounce off walls it would make it annoying as fuck to use. Reverse-knockback shotgun would also be either annoying or OP.    Grenades can be detonated manually by firing again.   Depending on the delay, this would either be OP or pointless I can imagine.   Plasma gun can be used for floating   So in other words, taking all of the skill out of it.   Bolt rifle starts at 50 damage and has to be charged   This would nerf the Bolt rifle greatly, imo, and it's already a little underpowered perhaps.  Edit: Wait wait wait..This game is too similar to Quake Live to cost money??? You mean the game that has ads and runs subscriptions/premium membership?"
reflex,39q76r,phipb,2,Sat Jun 13 19:56:56 2015 UTC,"I was spit-balling so the likelihood that any of my ideas were good is pretty bad. Also, I'm kind of a sucker for guided missiles because I tend to miss a lot, and I think it's really fun to watch someone run away from a missile as it chases them around the map.  The weapon thing sounds like a bad idea because it simplifies the gameplay to 1 weapon at a time, but I'm actually making a custom map now to try it. My thinking with the idea was that it would make guarding a specific area of the map (i.e. the rocket launcher) even more critical because once they have it they won't lose it unless they willingly change to a different weapon. Chances are it will turn out to be too simple, but I'm willing to give any idea a chance.  And to the edit: I'm not saying it's too similar to cost money, I'm saying that the similarity drives away players that aren't really into hardcore arena shooters; they see it and say, hey that's a lot like Quake- which reminds me, I should play some Quake Live. There's no reason to play this if you don't care enough about the changes (Or don't notice them) because the alternative is free."
reflex,39q76r,phipb,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:22:33 2015 UTC,"The single weapon idea just will not work. Trust me. No point in wasting your time with it. I doubt you'll get pro players testing it anyway.   It completely removes the best part about arenafps which is combo-ing your weapons. Also the ""guarding a specific area of the map"" idea is pretty awful considering rocket launcher is the best weapon by far and it will make the matches a huge boring waiting game most likely. Then we can just balance all the weapons right? Yeah imagine when every weapon can destroy a newly respawned player.. So we increase health? Now we got Clan Arena! I just can't see this working out at ALL.  Now, the thing with Reflex is that it costs a lot of money to maintain for it to be succesful. If you take a fucking moron who doesn't realize this sure you could argue QL is better than reflex ignoring the fact that a) Quake Live fucking dies because there's no support from the developers or b) that Quake Live clearly runs ads and uses a horrible and pretty overpriced imo subscription plan."

You can say it's better, and I agree fully, but despite the differences there are still quite a few similarities and if you haven't played a Quake game in the last 2 years you might forget a few of the caveats and/or not notice the caveats of Reflex."
reflex,39q76r,Spannzer,4,Mon Jun 15 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"Reflex has almost instant weapon switching and has air control. QL/vQ3 has no air control and does not have bhopping in any way. It has strafejumping and circlejumping, but that's about it.  Reflex has Circlejumps, Strafejumps, Bhopping, double jumps, triple jumps, tele jumps, stair jumps, W strafing for sharper mid air turns at the cost of not gaining speed through corrners, stake jumps (even if it's insanely niche), a tiered armour system (RA absorbs 75% of incoming damage, YA 50%, GA 25%) whereas in QL it's just 66.6% absorption, you cannot downgrade armour, armour does not decay ever, overall the gameplay is much much faster and more DM focused and the sheer amount of awesome new maps the map editor has birthed is astonishing.  Honestly the gameplay is completely different to QL/vQ3. Go watch a high level QL game and then go watch a CPM duel, the difference is night and day."
reflex,39q76r,kagnit,2,Tue Jun 16 10:03:31 2015 UTC,"I know there are a ton of differences (I honestly thought Quake Live had bunny hopping, shows how much I've played/read about it), and going off that list there are quite a few differences. I really didn't notice the armor system or several of those jump types. But then again, I haven't really been experimenting in the game that much and I haven't read the wiki or watched any tutorial videos.   But my question for you is, how much time do you have playing or watching Quake to notice all of that without consulting the wiki? All I remembered was the weapon damage from the default weapons, a few maps, and apparently I even forgot the basic movement (because for some reason I remember bunny hopping).  I was actually going to boot up Quake Live to compare the two today but when I joined a game the screen was completely black and all I could see where the arrows above allies heads. So I'm not going to be playing it any time soon; I'm not saying that Quake Live is ACTUALLY the same thing, I'm saying that at first glance the weapons and pickups around the map are pretty similar, which makes them look very similar to anyone who doesn't already know what strafejumps are."
reflex,39q76r,mizzu704,3,Tue Jun 16 13:38:08 2015 UTC,"how much time do you have playing or watching Quake to notice all of that   About 300 hours of Quake Live and vQ3, and 200ish hours of Reflex, and 100 in CPM.  But just playing QL/vQ3 for like 50 hours and then playing Reflex for 50 hours will be more than enough to easily see those differences, as long as you put a little effort into understanding the movement mechanics in both games.  But yeah, at their surface with little foreknowledge I understand how the two seem similar :)  Keep in mind that Reflex is based on CPM, a promod of vQ3 that was an attempt to meld Quakeworld gameplay with vQ3."

reflex,39ijti,Nyte9,4,Thu Jun 11 23:26:41 2015 UTC,"Glad you're enjoying it :> atdm is a ton of fun   Your movement could use some work! You can clear most of those gaps without rocket jumping (which isn't a big deal on arena since it doesn't damage you), and who doesn't like going super fast?   You're letting go of the strafe keys midair and only holding W, which neuters your acceleration by quite a bit. You kind of have the right idea with alternating between the strafe keys, though.   Here's a great video from 2GD showing strafe jumping in Quake live. It's the same in Reflex, and it's the fastest way to travel in a straight line. You're close already, I don't think it will take you much to figure out. https://youtu.be/SSNNhUAVRuA  In essence: hold w+strafe, move mouse horizontally in the same direction as strafe key slowly while jumping. To take corners, let go of W and turn in the same direction as your strafe key (exactly like bhopping in CS - this is unique to Reflex and CPMA and not covered in 2gd's video). Watch your speedometer, the entire time you're airborne, you should be accelerating :)"

Any reason/solutions?"
reflex,395j1d,vluke,3,Tue Jun 9 13:33:00 2015 UTC,"Beside old menu problems (10 minutes waiting) i have new ones...   Most importantly mouse feels very bad. It feels like sensitivity is changed (higher, much higher) and it feels like there is some kind of acceleration and deceleration (not so often). If i am in close duel and i use rocket l. i cant hit nothing because my mouse sens feels like it's doubled. This problem is there from the march when i started playing. But 7 in 10 times it feels ok. With this last update it got worse, plus sometimes i slide across floor like in tribes :-) Fps is normal (200). I dont have time to write big post on forum where i can describe all the problems, maybe with next patch :D   *Knockback is great.  **aaaand windows goes to basic color mode for some reason"
reflex,395j1d,reflex123,3,Tue Jun 9 17:39:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't notice anything different with the sensitivity, so I can't tell you what might be the issue. But I have a suggestion for you. You should categorize your sensitivity by   (distance of mouse movement) / (degrees turned ingame)   For example, my current sensitivity is   60 cm / 360° (I have a mouse pad that is 60cm wide)   If I try playing a new game and want to use the same sensitivity, all I have to do is move my mouse across the whole mousepad and make sure I turn 360°. If I don't, I tweak the sensitivity ingame until I do.  With this setup it's also easy to check if the sensitivity is different than it should be, and you don't have to rely on just ""feel"".  A good way to test whether there is acceleration is to moving the mouse back and forth at different speeds. So you move the mouse to the right with a quick flick, then move the mouse left slowly until you're where you started. Repeat. If you keep moving more to the right than left, you have acceleration on."
reflex,395j1d,db_mew,3,Wed Jun 10 06:24:11 2015 UTC,"I used that mouse-sensitivity site so my sens is same in reflex, quake live and cs.go. Maybe i described badly this problem, main point is sensitivity isn't constant, it does not feel the same every time.   And when i experienced this problem few days ago i started quake live and there it feels normal (so its not problem with mouse or other hardware).  And i am using terms ""acceleration"" and ""deceleration"" just to describe feeling, its not actual acceleration.   Best way to describe  - imagine you are playing duel normally, then you got yourself in a close fight (or you jump around whatever) and then suddenly your in game sensitivity goes from 9.5 (which was mine before last version) to 15, 16 and stays that way for a 20, 30 seconds or whole game. And sometimes it goes minus, from 9.5 to 5, 6. Of course i am not talking about m_speed changing somehow, just feeling of increased sens.  When ""acceleration"" happens i sometimes slide across the floor or to the side, and with ""deceleration"" i cant easily gain or maintain speed when i jump around the map so it can be its not just mouse problem (fps stays the same, no lag - i created server).  I started with 13.2 sensitivity in march, with latest version i am on 8 just to keep it slower.  *no need for downvotes, i am writing this so it can be seen and fixed for me and future users :-)  **english is not my native language so maybe i sound angry or something but that is not the case :D"

reflex,38xdlb,zypsilon,11,Tue Jun 9 09:39:23 2015 UTC,"For the love of god, add micro-transactions and CTF   Lets be clear here, no gameplay changes will ever bring in a flux of new players. This is an extremely simple concept, people love to buy and customize things.   http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-explains-how-csgo-became-the-second-most-played-game-on-steam/  Every 'new' game adapted to the current model, CS:GO wasn't increasing it's player base until they released an update that allowed put in skins that the community could like and request in the game. That alone spiked their player base, because people love to buy stupid little things. This simple moved let them bring in a lot more money, and host huge tournaments with millions of dollars in prize money.  I can't find it, but there was an article written by an economist who said publishers and devs are throwing away about a $1,000,000 in yearly revenue by not adding some form of microtransactions. You could have a $20 retail game, or have a $20 retail game with added micro-transactions, and clearly one will bring in a lot more money than the other.   You can theory-craft all day about maps, gameplay changes, what makes it easier for new players, blah blah blah. The cold hard truth is stupid in-game shit you can buy. That's it. Adding that alone brings in more money, and more money means more development, better updates and features, etc.   You want proof this is the case? Look at Quake Live, the game that didn't adapt post 2010. Everyone else was figuring it out, and QL decided the ""Premium' model which brought in more money, but not more players. It split the player base, removed maps, and added nothing of value. The player base shrunk and shrunk, to where it is today.  If you go to an e-sports event like a tournament or talk to people at a Twitch after party, you get a lot of the same feedback when it comes to Quake and arena fps in general. Everyone loves it, everyone wants to watch it, but there's nothing new to play. Unreal Tournament has the right idea, they're re-creating the steam workshop and using it in their game. It brings in money, money money money.   At the end of the day it's pretty basic, users like purchasing in-game content, especially when it lets you customize a character. Reflex is a great game so far, but it's extremely likely it will go no where if it doesn't adapt to the current model. Even the devs at Overwatch (Blizzards new FPS) are trying to figure out how to add in some form of micro-transactions. Whether it be TF2 hats, or something else, they know they're throwing away free money if they don't include some kind of economy or customization.   CTF because it's an immensely popular game mode in NA, and servers would fill up the day after a CTF update is added.   edit:    We may, god forbid, have to ruffle some feathers (go cry into your timer pillows) to make this game successful, but we do not have to dumb down the game to accomplish this.   no, no you don't. Timers aren't the issue, and never have been the issue. This is exactly why arena games are where they are, people get caught up in small gameplay mechanics that they think should be removed completely. This is like arguing the brand of pepper you put out on your tables will attract and keep customers at your restaurant. Yeah, it's totally the pepper, much like it's the timers. Hint: it's not"
reflex,38xdlb,relaxedcarl,4,Sun Jun 7 20:34:55 2015 UTC,"This post lays the truth fucking down.  TF2 is a shooter that did the microtransactions/cosmetics thing really damn well, and even after 8 years since its release it's one of the most popular multiplayer shooters in the world."

reflex,38xdlb,kawakawakawa,9,Sun Jun 7 22:31:44 2015 UTC,"The main problem imo is that the only viable gametype to play right now is duel and race, both of which are very unpopular compared to team-based games. Server performance in populated servers seems to always be a shitty experience, and the TDM gametype is just bad (no team auto-balancing, and the maps are shit when you play with any more players than 2v2 since there's never enough weapons for everyone).  For example, I've made 10+ of my friends buy Reflex, when they get it, they want to play it with me. The problem is, our only option is either to play against him in a duel (which will inevitably be a horrible experience for both of us), or play race mode (which they will inevitably fail at since there's no training, unless I teach him), or lastly, I could teach him how to play 1v1 but that's not much fun when he doesn't have any friends who are his own skill level to practice his newly learned skills against.  Another point I'd like to make is that there's no extra incentives to play Reflex. Games like CS:GO have weekly item drops which keeps people coming back. I know it's unrealistic for Reflex to have this sort of system, but it definitely needs at least something that makes them feel good for playing, such as a ranking system or stat tracking.  TL;DR: If you want to attract the masses, the game has to better support the ability to play with a bunch of friends and needs extra incentives to keep people interested."

In the context of the general discussion I think the simplicity of atdm is really newbie friendly. I introduced some friends to reflex by playing atdm with them.

Rather than increasing the double jump timer, I would rather there just be a HUD widget for it in Race or something to let me get a better feel for the timing.   The biggest limitation on my part has been finding servers. Since  only 20-30% or so of the servers are US East, and most of them are 1v1s, it's pretty difficult to just hop into a server and start shotting mans.

reflex,38xdlb,Stalast,2,Sun Jun 7 20:14:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, what I think will bring in the masses is first getting the game out of alpha and adding things like matchmaking and CTF. Gameplay tweaks aren't going to make a huge difference. If they like how fast the game is, they'll stick around. But not if they're getting 50-bombed every time they join a game. Tutorials to help people climb the initial learning curve, and decent matchmaking to put you against people who are near your skill level is what's needed most imo. Thousands of people spend hours learning spray patterns and smokes in counterstrike. Why would they not want to learn strafe jumping and rocketing people?   Maybe a few free-to-play weekends once the game is more polished and closer to completion. I could be speaking out of turn, but the devs have limited time and budget which needs to be focused on clearing their extant to do list, and (from what I've seen in posts), marketing is not a huge part of that - at least not for awhile - and for good reason. The game is still early access, and they have tons more content planned.   As a community, what can we do? Get your friends into the game. Help them learn and find people near their skill level. Produce your own content and post it places where it will get exposure (outside or r/reflex). Stream it, promote it, talk about it on social media. Run cups and try find sponsors. Port maps from other games and tell those communities about it. Hell, give a few copies of the game away if you're feeling generous. Anything the community does to bring fresh eyes into the game is hugely beneficial.  At any rate, I agree that there's a catch-22, but right now I don't think it's the end of the world. The game has a long way to go, and the devs know what they're doing, they're professional game designers who've been at this for awhile. What the community can do is the leg work that they can't - not game design, but marketing and HYPE. We need more PGHP's, not more ""are item timers rly the best way to help new players"""

reflex,38xdlb,Fastidious_,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:30:20 2015 UTC,"There are many issues here.  On making the game have more longtivity: Ranking, experience bar, collectibles/unlockables/achievements please are neat. See TF2 / CS GO. Obviously none of that should impact the gameplay at all.  On making the game more accessible/newbie-friendly: there are two areas, the infrastructure and the actual gameplay.  On infrastructure:    Add matchmaking, obviously. I don't care if it's ELO or ranks. What works very well for me is Quake Live + a script that shows what ELO the players have on a server. Never had a frustrating experience since I've installed that. Apparently CS GO's refined ranks work well, too. Tutorials. I can think of many, many ways apart from a good wiki. For practising movement, add racemode to duel maps where you need to race between items; add quick routes to race down after spawning for practicing openings in duel; add racemode to CTF maps for obvious reasons. For practising weapons, copy QL's FFA where you can choose a weapon and spawn with it. I know it's very controversial, but IMO it's a great way of practice. Could be a separate mode, which leads to the next point. I could well imagine modes for casual play and others for competitive play, see CS GO and QL (duel is the hard mode).   On gameplay: there was a great gamasutra article on complexity that explains well why I support anything that makes the game more readable and removes unnecessary strain. Hence I support item timers (needs tweaking though).  Final thought: maybe obvious, but if we as a community don't piss off new players but encourage and teach them, that might help a bit, too."
reflex,38xdlb,zypsilon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:56:20 2015 UTC,It needs the usual cosmetics/levels/xp stuff that make the games like TF2 and CS:GO so popular. The general gameplay won't be enough by itself like relaxedcarl said.
reflex,38xdlb,Vibed,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:33:13 2015 UTC,"I think one thing that would draw in new players is a single-player campaign so that people feel like they can get their money's worth even without a full-sized player base. However, I think it's rarely a good idea for developers to split focus between single-player and multiplayer. So, naturally, I think that the community should work together to make a series of single-player maps. Before that can happen, though, a few things would need to be added to the map editor:  An exit portal to load another map upon touching it.  A set of simple single-player enemies. For example: Basic enemies like immobile turrets that shoot directly at you (a variant for each weapon), enemies that move towards the player in a straight line and only hurt the player if they touch you (three variants: slow, medium, and fast), and enemies that combine the two behaviors would probably be enough to start making levels,  Settings to change variants and health of enemies.  Then you could add other enemies that the community feels would be interesting. For inspiration, look at the simplest, easiest to make, and least intelligent enemies from Quake, Megaman, Zelda, and Wrack.  Optional: Some kind of collectible which the game keeps track of when singleplayer is enabled and doesn't reset on map end. (Secrets are fun)  Have the community work together to decide which levels to include, and in what order, and then all the devs have to do is add those levels under a new game tab called Campaign. It might not make the playerbase bigger, but at the least people will still have a reason to buy the game even without the playerbase being very big. If it also helps with that, great!  I haven't looked into the map editor at all, so if this type of thing is already possible through scripting or something, let me know and I'll try to make a few levels myself. (I just found out that the game started working on my computer yesterday, so I'm pretty hyped.)"
reflex,38xdlb,tccrist,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:39:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with other people in this thread that microtransactions and incentives like ranks, experience points (etc) are good ideas.  However, I think we should be careful about seeing these things as easy recipes for success. It's not as simple as throwing in some $0.99 hats for download, as much as people love to make TF2 hat jokes. Pretending otherwise is in fact dangerous for the game's future. Making big changes like this to the game takes development time, careful planning, and money. Not realizing this and just blindly throwing hats into the game could mean the game's death.  Microtransactions and other like features need to designed and implemented in ways that are both inherently interesting (ie. what makes leveling up in this game different from leveling up in another game?) and well-suited for the game itself (ie. leveling up or microtransactions for Reflex should work such that they wouldn't make as much sense if done for a different game).  If these things are implemented, the dev team also has to consider how to present them. Almost every game has a ranking system, so how are we going to make Reflex's stand out? Games need personality. They need to catch people's interest. This is where art direction and good advertising comes in. Having these features without proper advertising is worthless.  There is a lot more that could and should be done if Reflex is to be successful, but these are just some of the things I wanted to point out."

reflex,38psj6,guran33a,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:46:00 2015 UTC,Maybe a stretch since I haven't played the game yet so I don't know about all the options but does Reflex have support for borderless fullscreen? It looks like real fullscreen but it can never work as well as dedicated fullscreen since rendering the desktop smoothly has to be a priority at the same time (who knows what weird stuff gets added to the mouse input and what optimizations that doesn't work properly).  You really don't want to play with vsync either in a fast paced game where latency is really undesirable.

reflex,3898j3,danukenator,11,Tue Jun 2 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"Firstly, welcome to the game. Below are some pieces of advice I can give as a medium-skilled player. A lot of resources cover Quake (Live), but many things are very similar between the two games.  The dimensions of the game are these, more or less from elementary to advanced, meaning if you want to go about it systematically, focus on the more elementary things first.   Hardware setup: get proper hardware and have it set up properly. Here's a guide that focuses on that aspect. My personal recommendation: set sensitivity to low (for aiming precisely, which also calls for a large mousepad), but have some acceleration (especially for rocket jumps). I know it's a contentious matter, but let me quote this post that advocates it nicely; also most pro players use it. Since you play other FPS too: IF you decide to use acceleration, use this driver (a bit complex, but worth it) and this website to get the same setting in all FPS. IF you don't use accel, use the website only. Lastly, use earphones. Game setup: It's mandatory to bind each weapon to a key that's easy to reach. Especially the three main weapons (Rocket, Ion Cannon / Lightning, Bolt Rifle / Railgun) should be accessible no matter what movement you're executing. On graphics: play with as much FPS as you can, disable features that feel distracting for you. Movement: watch relevant videos. Here are some. Try race mode. Load maps in FFA/1v1 and try to move from one important item to another one as fast as possible. For practising strafe jumping, do use this custom hud element. Weaponry: If you're completely new to Reflex / QL, I'd advise you to play QL FFA and roam, because you can spawn with a weapon already. This way you'll get a feeling for situations where a certain weapon is (not) appropriate. Of course, mastery is when you can use a weapon well even when the situation doesn't call for it. Another way to focus on weaponry is to play the Arena modes in Reflex, such as a1v1, atdm, affa, although they're more fun if you got your movement down. Here's a QL guide, the numbers are different but the same strategies apply to both games. Lastly, get used to some useful combos (e.g. push the enemy around with rockets -> ion/rail to finish off). Map knowledge: play a lot and watch videos. Practice map-specific jumps, item-to-item runs. Item timing: without item timers, it's a skill to itself, but even with timers you shouldn't neglect that part if you play anything else than Arena modes. Mind games: now that's where the real fun begins. Here's a guide that focuses on Aerowalk/cpm22 but explains the aspects of mind games really well. See also the guides below on duel. On the gamemodes: here are some QL strategy guides. On duel specifically: a very detailed guide; another guide; a video guide series by KovaaK. IMO it's the most advanced/difficult mode, as it involves all skills/aspects of the game, so I'd play other modes first. I personally play mostly Arena modes because I can't bring myself to invest in the game that much (and also because I find it harder to find opponents in duel that don't own me too much). Generally: observe and learn from other (better) players, whether in-game or through videos/demos. Learn from your own mistakes consiously.   As always, good luck and have fun!  Edit: clarifications. Edit 2: Additions."
reflex,3898j3,zypsilon,2,Wed Jun 3 06:09:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for such a complete list! This pulls together a lot of little bits I've found online.  To as you a subjective question, where's a good ""starting"" point for mouse settings? In CS I used 102.9cm/360 because you don't need to turn super fast. However, I'm having difficulty navigating with the same sens in Reflex.   Is one of those pro's sens considered ""average"" and I start with that and increase/decrease the parameters as need be?"
reflex,3898j3,zypsilon,4,Wed Jun 3 12:22:44 2015 UTC,"I use the mouse acceleration driver linked above (I actually wrote the GUI included with it), and my settings are currently around 10 inches (25cm) to a 360 for very fast flicks and 20 inches (50 cm) to a 360 when going slow.  Thus, I can do a full 180 with a quick 5"" flick of the wrist, but I still have decent tracking for Ion Cannon.  I find that when you go to 75cm to a 360 or higher, you don't gain too much in Reflex or Quake.  Very little fighting is done at extreme ranges where you would need to track with precision.  Bolt Rifle/Railgun fights at long range aren't a tracking contest, but a spastic dodging/flick type of fight (most players line up the crosshair near their opponent and wait for them to dodge into the shot rather than track along at the distance).  Even at the longest distance where you track with Ion Cannon/Lightning Gun, your own player movements and dodges tend to throw off your aim if you go too low on mouse sensitivity.  My own testing has found the sweet spot of 50cm for tracking, but that's personal preference and my mouse is heavy (G502).  Back when I played Quakeworld competitively before the good options for acceleration existed, I used 30cm to a 360 for purposes of movement flexibility.  Also, to pimp my own work, I made a little video series on Youtube teaching how to duel in QuakeWorld.  A lot of the skills transfer over very well, and it should give you a good idea of the things that I'm thinking about while playing Reflex and Quake.  I've been thinking about running a similar series on how to duel in Reflex, but the gameplay is still subject to change.  If I get a chance, I might do some demo reviews of players of varying skill levels and post my commentary on Youtube for what I think they could have done better."

reflex,3898j3,Fb62,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"OMG =) This link shows what the pros use (it's part of my huge messy post):  http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1l8vy4/the_case_for_mouse_acceleration/cbxdn6z  I'm at around 20cm/360° I think, with the accel at 0.3 via mouse driver."
reflex,3898j3,da_wizard,3,Wed Jun 3 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"I would recommend just jumping around a map and trying to figure out certain jumps, maybe even with someone's help. This really gets you into the movement and helps you learn maps and how to move around them. Even if you don't want to do that, just find a new player and duel him. Try to learn the basic aspects of the game and you will get better little by little.  Timing  Sound  Movement  Map position  Control  Prediction  There are a lot of little things to learn and some things pertaining to specific maps. If you play a lot of CS at least you have some fps practice."
reflex,3898j3,Stalast,2,Tue Jun 2 19:10:04 2015 UTC,"Try FFA until you get things like weapon switching and basic combos like rocket > rail down, and when to use each weapon.  When you want to duel, go around maps you want to try first and see how to get between the items, and if there's short cuts you can make with teleporter and double jumps and whatnot. If you're in control you want to just hoover up mega/RA and chase people down, and if you're out of control try to steal while going for junk like yellow armor and make the other guy pay with grenades and sniping whenever you can get free damage in.  Also try to find people who will stomp you without completely annihilating you. Painful but you'll learn a massive amount about reading people, dodging and how to really abuse weapons than you would by twitching around with someone else who's just starting out.  Also raise your sensitivity from cs, or use accel or taste the pain. There's a sweet point between moving around comfortably freely and being able to aim that you need to find, with 15-40cm/360 probably being where most people fall. Also depends on if you aim with your wrist or your arm."
reflex,3898j3,zypsilon,3,Wed Jun 3 12:45:39 2015 UTC,Just play 1v1s and also practice movement by going on race mode servers and play the maps. I came from CSGO background too and only tiny amount of time spent playing QL before Reflex went on Steam. I got good just by getting destroyed over and over.

Ie. in CS, trying to understand peaking, positioning, aim, recoil, etc. all at once was almost too much. Just doing aim + recoil at first would have been smarter.   That said, I'm experiencing a known bug that causes Reflex to use the integrated GPU as opposed to my actual GPU. Once that gets sorted out, the stomping will begin."

reflex,3898j3,tehPopeExploder,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:47:42 2015 UTC,"You don't need armour if you don't get hit.    But on a more serious note, in CS it's important where to shoot but in Quake/Refex it's more important that you hit instead of where you hit.  Try to keep moving, non moving targets are very easy to hit. Zig-zag when you are up against another player. Use splash-damage of the rocket launcher for a better chance of hitting. Try to learn how to circle strave/bunnyhop. You don't have to be the greatest trickjumper, but knowing the basics will allow you to move quite fast. Fast targets are harder to hit.   But most importantly, have fun in the game and don't be afraid to ask questions or spectate good players."

reflex,38597r,Heorin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:34:15 2015 UTC,arbitrary    I don't think you know what this means. Being able to time items properly and consistently is absolutely a legitimate skill. There's nothing arbitrary about it.
reflex,38597r,prodiG,3,Thu Jun 4 02:21:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, semantics. You got me. Nice job /s   based on random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system.   Sure it's a skill, but I've been doing this for ten years. It's like memorizing a multiplication table (shit you learn in the third grade). I see 9:16, I know the next item is at 8:51. Doing this arithmetic over and over is straight forward. To me, it's easy. It is not, however, fun.  The skill in my opinion comes in the application of that knowledge, not the fact that you can do the arithmetic. If you can't do it, you haven't passed the basic barriers to entry of the game.  You know the item spawns at 8:51. Are you in position to take it? What about after it's taken? What if you don't know the time because you were on the other side of the map?  The last point is the kind of thing that is removed with global item timers. I'm all for removing the arithmetic. I'm against removing the application of the knowledge by having the game donate all of the information to you."
reflex,38597r,__pm_me_your_puns__,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:09:55 2015 UTC,"So in League of Legends last year they added buff/neutral timers for if you have vision of the buff/neutral when it was taken.  This caused a huge uproar in the community because a lot of people (myself included) were angry that the 'skill' involved in tracking buffs/neutrals was now gone, and that the advantage you could gain from having a mental record of the time would be gone.  In the end, it changed almost nothing. Bad players were still bad players, good players were still good players. The game is better for having the timers in place. Now granted it's not quite the same, but I think the principle remains."
reflex,38597r,Heorin,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:05:14 2015 UTC,Timings in Quake are much more important than in LoL.

reflex,38597r,Heorin,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:38:48 2015 UTC,It's entirely the point. Showing item timers in CPM would have a much greater effect on the skill gap/cap than it would in LoL.   it easier for more skilled players to climb.   How does that even make sense? It would end up being a net neutral.
reflex,38597r,__pm_me_your_puns__,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:53:32 2015 UTC,"Because bad players still wouldn't prep dragons/buffs and would just show up when it spawned, and then get destroyed by anyone who did do the prep. Or you just got 2 teams that didn't prep at all and just fought for no reason. That was my experience at least in low elo, in high elo nothing changed since everyone kept track of timers.  I can't claim to know much about Reflex or aFPS's in general, I'm still new. So I'll take your word for it, I just thought about how it was in League and thought it might apply here."

reflex,37ngd2,zypsilon,2,Thu May 28 22:45:04 2015 UTC,"Notice the number just below ""Megahealth"" on the bottom left side of the HUD.  Source Forum thread  Known bug: if you lose health in the same frame that you grab an armor or health, the tracker won't notice the loss.  This applies mostly when you are at 200 health and sitting on 5h shards, but it should be pretty rare in real combat."
reflex,37ngd2,zypsilon,1 point,Thu May 28 22:45:48 2015 UTC,Does it track if the enemy has picked it up? Could that be customizable?  I'm bad at duel and am all for lowering the entry barrier. But IMO item timers should only be activated if you (the player) picked it up. Otherwise it turns players into almost-all-knowing spies (as it is now with the default timers).
reflex,37ngd2,Kringer,2,Fri May 29 10:40:57 2015 UTC,It does not track if an enemy picked it up.  It will even lose track of it if you spectate someone who picked it up and then switch views.

reflex,37ngd2,KittenIgnition,3,Fri May 29 15:24:50 2015 UTC,"It actually doesn't.  Say you have 0 armor, 100 health, and you grab mega to go to 200 health.  When you get down to 100 health, mega will respawn 30 seconds later.  Say you have 200 armor, 100 health, and you grab mega to go to 200/200.  If you take a single rocket very near your feet for 80 damage, you will go to 146 armor, 174 health.  You can take 20 more ""damage"" before you lose the mega buff, but there's no indication on the default HUD.  You might still be at 160 health when mega runs out, or you might be below 100.  This script shows you the numeric value in damage you can take before you lose the mega buff."

reflex,36gnyf,prodiG,14,Tue May 19 06:27:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like timing in the sense of adding +25/+35 and remembering it is an archaic mechanic that doesnt add anything exciting or fun to the game except mental fatigue to the player.  Its like ""he picked RA at 1:04 will he remember that it will spawn at 1:29 again?! omg the tension is killing me!"" Nope... not really. Also timers as they are right now are just gameplay killers, you are removing a big part of the game plus changing how the game is played. And that leads to learning how to play the game in the wrong way for people who start the game playing with timers and at some point they are completely removed and they have to learn how to play the game again. The best solution to keep that part of ""suspense"" is just to add timers for the items you pick up. Just like in moba games you have the CD for each of yours skill displayed."
reflex,36gnyf,asdfrofl1,2,Tue May 19 11:44:53 2015 UTC,"if the sounds stay as they're now you would be kind if right. but they are about to change so that they are not global anymore. so when you pick up an item you can actually delay it and thereby creating a possible trap for your opponent. This is the whole mechanic that people want to keep in the game. it's not about just adding numbers it's actually about intel. fog of war in Starcraft would be the best analogy I could think of. The timers tell you if somebody just picked up an item and you instantly know where the player is. That makes the game a lot more transparent and removes some of the mind games. the actual discussion should be about the amount of these mind games that come through timers. you're right that adding numbers isn't such a great skill to have in a game but here it is more like a means of enabling something beyond. of course some players are better at just aiming and moving and don't care about this timing/offsetting part but some can do this pretty well.   think of it as this: when there is no absolute knowledge about the state of the game (meaning items available and player positions) both players have to fill the missing information with speculation. they essentially create a hypothetical scenario in their mind. those two scenarios differ and make the thing more interesting. both players can also try to manipulate the opponent into believing something is this way when it's actually that way. they can leave false hints. well, call it mindgames. when you give the information you actually pin down - you define - reality. before people had conquered the whole world a few hundred years there where white patches on the maps. sometimes there were the words ""Here be dragons"" written on these patches. people had the wildest fantasies about what was there. A treasure? the fountain of eternal youth? A foreign paradise? they conquered the world because they they wanted to know what's there and their fantasies - their speculation - was much more interesting the reality. because in the end there was propably just some rocks or similar shit. before that there were multiple scenarious, today there's just one single truth. and its so ducking boring we never use Google maps to check it out anymore.....   removing the timers makes the game more transparent so there is less room left to speculation. therefor less ways players can manipulate other players' perceived state of the game.   I am not saying this is the right perspective it is just the one contra item timers (in pro games).  also I think it's not so bad as you fear that people learn the game ""the wrong way"". I think there's no way of telling which way is the best to learn tha game. and people first concentrating on aiming and moving and only after that thinking about the timing of items in at necessarily the wrong way."
reflex,36gnyf,exocortex,3,Tue May 19 16:12:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe I didnt express myself properly or dont understand what you mean, but i think we agree?. The system I talked about is basically when you pick up RA (0:00) you get a icon RA (00:25) in the same place that we have timers right now for example. So if your opponent picks RA you cannot know it unless you are near enough to hear the sound (when pick up sound is no longer global) and of course if you have no info you cannot know when RA will spawn again. What I just want to get rid off is the +25/+35 sum"
reflex,36gnyf,asdfrofl1,2,Tue May 19 16:26:44 2015 UTC,"that would actually be some kind of a compromise people could maybe live by. Although It could be difficult to to determine if this pickup-event was now realized by both or just one player. determine this by radius would be too easy since you could be far away and see it being picked up. I think I could live by that - the computer doing the addition. I would compare it to the change in Starcraft 1 to sc2 where now you don't have to click on each of your 8 casernes and produce soldiers - now you can groupselect them and click once.  Although the assisted addition still removes the possibilities of failures - a little.   If I could decide I would create a tiered system. Every player is getting a tier according to his/her skill. in the first tier you get all kinds of assistence - item timers strafejumphelp and grenade timers whatever. There could even be some different physics (I know very radical) so that you have more (quake live-esque) aircontrol.  tier two would be harder. all jumping techniques and less hud-assistence.  Top tier would be hardest. we could even go further here and remove the seconds in the clock like it was in cpma once. Maybe also no weapon-switch time allowing for these evil combos. I know this is potentially - or many will argue definitely - game-breaking.  But:  If every new player would be encouraged by tutorials and proposed demos of higher-tier players to raise his/her tier-rating they might even enjoy learning it. they would be informed about what other dimensions of gameplay also exist instead of just stomped by high skilled players without even realizing the more subtle aspects of the game. Also if you know that what is dividing you from a tier3 (or whatever) player is not just any mysterious skill but one that can be actually named: This player is higher rated then you because he learned 'the art of the strafe-jump' till level 3 and has a higher map-awareness setting. Do you want to learn more about how you can advance your skills in these fields? go through these tutorials here: join(completed), join, join.   I know this is radical and would have some negative side effects. but it would propably keep some new players longer in the game then now. It would inform them rather than leave them crushed without a clue why. Also it would set a clear standard of how the game is played at top level."

reflex,36gnyf,Parzic,8,Tue May 19 15:26:43 2015 UTC,"Repost of my comment on /r/ArenaFPS:  I have to say that I don't like a callvote for something like that.  There's something to be said about consistency of gameplay from tutorial to competition.  If it's a callvote option, the people who don't want it will be very aware they can callvote it off of every server they play on, but the newer players may not be aware that they can reverse it to help themselves out.  All that aside, I still haven't seen a single convincing argument against item timers.  Hidden timers is just an opaque barrier to entry for newer players, and we need less of that stuff in this genre.  There's so much depth to the game beyond ""do I remember when the next important item is coming up?"" but people are pretending like once that's given to you then there's nothing left.  If that was truly it, I would have been bored by this genre years ago."
reflex,36gnyf,Kered13,4,Tue May 19 16:18:01 2015 UTC,"Re: consistency, I totally agree. One of the things I was really hoping to see was little difference between comp and pub rulesets. It ostracizes people in some way no matter how you skin that cat.   The devs are definitely trying to give the community what they want which I can understand. I'm worried in practice this is only going to segregate competitive players from those who don't want to get over the initial hump of having the crutch taken away. Very fussy situation. Can't please 'em all.  All of the most successful competitive games - CS, LoL, DotA, Street Fighter, the list goes on - the default experience is usually pretty damn close to the competitive experience. Beyond pre-game selection rules (bans and picks in mobas, can change chars in fighting games if you lost the last match) the in-game experience is identical and anyone playing or watching will only see the differences represented in skill levels, not on how well they've adapted to the new rulesets.   I do not envy the job of the devs /salute"
reflex,36gnyf,Kered13,1 point,Tue May 19 16:26:59 2015 UTC,"Item control and manipulating item timers add a lot of strategic depth to the game, as discussed above. It's not just ""do I remember when the next item is coming up?"". It's an information game. You can deny your opponent knowledge of item respawn times, and in return you can try to steal that information from your opponent. Providing global item timers removes this depth (it also gives you information about your opponent's position through walls).  I think the compromise mentioned above is a very good idea: If you pick up an item, you get a respawn timer. This removes the mental arithmetic and remembering to check the clock. But if your opponent picks up an item, you are told nothing. You can't know when your opponent grabs an item unless you see or hear it, and you don't get to know when it respawns. That's information you have to earn."
reflex,36gnyf,ReinH,3,Tue May 19 18:50:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just don't see the ""hiding"" of information happen as often as you (and other people who dislike built in timers) indicate it happens.  The game is so fast paced that people are always running around grabbing some item and getting a positional advantage to further their goal of map control.  Hypothetical scenario - Red Armor is coming up soon, and your opponent isn't close enough to contest you.  Let's say you are playing a game where item timers are not displayed on everyone's screens, and you wish to mess with your opponent by not getting the RA as it spawns.  Here are your options:  1) You don't go directly to RA before it's up, but instead you choose to harass your opponent.  In this scenario, he can deduce that you left the RA up based on how quickly you got to him, so you didn't actually hide information from him.  2) You choose to go away from your opponent to collect something like health or ammo.  This scenario is risky - your opponent might get the RA before you do.  3) You choose to wait in the RA room for a few seconds.  You give up the opportunities of collecting more resources and getting a better positional advantage.  If your opponent happens to come close enough to hear you grab the RA when you do get it, you've also gained nothing in information hiding.  None of the options related to information hiding are compelling to me.  They are either too risky or not likely to gain you anything of worth versus an attentive opponent.  I think that when people see high level QL players delay picking up items, they mistake it for one of two good reasons to delay grabbing an item:  1) They are holding off on getting it because there is another item that would respawn at the same time the next RA would (either a Mega or Yellow Armor)  2) They are already really high in stack.  Getting into a fight and trading blows then collecting the item results in their opponent being wounded while they are back close to full health/armor.  And on-screen item timers don't diminish the effectiveness of those two strategic choices."
reflex,36gnyf,Elite552,1 point,Tue May 19 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"Delaying an item is actually really easy. Let's say you kill your opponent at red. Instead of grabbing it immediately, just don't. Instead, leave the room like you normally would and harass your opponent's spawn. Then go back and grab the red. You've delayed red by five seconds and your opponent can't know.  If you watch high level QL commentary, you'll see that delays happen all the time.  It's also very easy to lose track of timers by a few seconds at a time if you don't keep watching the items get picked up. It's very common for a pickup to be two or three seconds late, if you don't see that then after a few cycles you've lost track of the timer. This is why high level QL players are always trying to see (or hear) important item pickups even if they're not contesting and don't expect a delay.  You can also have situations where you expect your opponent to get red or mega, so you go to get a weapon or yellow somewhere else. But your opponent laid a trap and kills you. With global timers, if your opponent doesn't grab red like you expect, then you know he's not on that side of the map and you know that you're not safe. This is the kind of global information that item timers give away for free."
reflex,36gnyf,zypsilon,7,Tue May 19 19:32:57 2015 UTC,"At some point in a future update we will be adding a ""callvote lockhud"" command. This will force players to use the official, unmodified HUD files only and will not include item timers (or strafe jump helpers, or grenade timers etc). Over time, this will become part of a larger system of settings that are appropriate for competitions and high level play but not for general pub games. Now can we shut the fuck up about timers for 15 minutes?   (emphasis added)"

reflex,36gnyf,MAD_JIHAD,2,Thu May 21 03:57:04 2015 UTC,I think there should be an option to lock huds to default (with timers) or no timers. We should see which one is the most popular for tourney play and go from there.

It doesn't seem to give an optimal circle jump on the ground, and it also doesn't seem to represent the maximum speed you can turn with just strafes in the air.  (Please correct me if I'm wrong here)  I was playing with accelmeter.lua, and I made it so that it only displays when you are:   Holding forward and one of the two strafes Have a value of vertical velocity that is greater than 2 or less than -2 (seems that when walking around, it hovers between 0 to -1)   Also, to make it useable in normal game modes I have it only displaying the green section and not the blue.  One suggestion I have to add to the whole package is a grenade timer that counts down from 2 (or displays some visual that helps) when you fire a grenade.

Mostly people compete against their Steam friend list leader board but a few try to top the global leader board too.  The daily ""challenges"" in games like Spelunky are very popular."

reflex,35x2vm,gritob,1 point,Fri May 15 01:27:30 2015 UTC,Those kind of games usually have a random element (or even whole random maps). Wonder what Reflex could do in that regard.

reflex,35x2vm,gritob,2,Fri May 15 12:05:58 2015 UTC,Reflex has a lot of maps and modes already and will only increase in time.  That right there provides a lot of easy variety for daily ideas.  Just something to think about is all.  Even an ax challenge might be cool depending how it is done.  Also consider even if these are popular a lot of players still won't be doing them or would have already done it for the day.

reflex,35x2vm,UnnaturallyFunky,7,Thu May 14 07:37:52 2015 UTC,"We do actually have this planned as map sets/map rotations. The plans also include making these rotations available on Steam Workshop.  So anyway, players/server admins will be able to set a map rotation like FFA maps, or competitive 1v1 maps etc. It also won't actually just be restricted to maps -- you'll be able to create rotations that pick a new map and new mode each match, based on the number of players currently on the server."
reflex,35x2vm,Xmarcuswildx,4,Thu May 14 12:46:48 2015 UTC,"Yes - the number of maps make voting or choosing increasingly difficult. there should be an option to tag maps and then search for them.  alternatively folders of course. but I'd prefer the tags so that maps can be in several categories. like 'tehace', 'tournament', 'duel', 'small', 'official'. Something like that."
reflex,35x2vm,rendej0,2,Thu May 14 09:08:46 2015 UTC,"The long term objective is for them to move maps to the steam community/workshop.

reflex,35h3nu,Shirts_,8,Sun May 10 08:07:20 2015 UTC,"Start by focusing on FFA games, no pressure just plenty of opportunity to get frags, test out the weapons and get used to the movement style required for AFPS. Once you've started to get the hang of things go look up strafe jumping tutorials and practice as much as you can stand. Then ease into duels, and remember to spectate others playing and pay attention to their positioning, and what weapons they use and how."

The way I got into Reflex from a non-arena shooter background was by just playing against any player in the servers. I probably lost my first 20 duels without getting a single frag, but I eventually got more comfortable and starting putting up a fight, and then eventually started winning. It is actually easier to get into the game now since we have the item timers on the screen, it was a lot harder for me before then, because most people knew the timings well from QL/CPMA."
reflex,35h3nu,Stalast,2,Sun May 10 11:14:34 2015 UTC,I always post this to newcomers:   make the binds for weapons comfortable. put the around the movement keys so you can easily reach them.  I moved my wasd keys to esdf so I have more space around. But whatever - this may not be the optimal.  just make the keys easily reachable for you.  you want to be able to switch to the right weapon with just the press of a button. never EVER use mouse wheel!
reflex,35h3nu,exocortex,-7,Wed May 13 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"I would advice you to start with quakelive and play some ffa to get used to the quake like movement and also to learn the maps. Then it's just uphill battle to get better, more so than in other games because you will have to play with people better than you."

reflex,35azpq,TskTsW,2,Tue Jun 30 15:59:05 2015 UTC,"also a subnote, your sensitivity in 360/cm is still personal. The way you hold your mouse can change your mouse speed significantly.   It is. But there is no doubt in my mind that default sensititivies (often <20cm/360) are WAY too high, especially for a game like Reflex."
reflex,35azpq,elstir,1 point,Fri May 8 20:21:18 2015 UTC,"default sensititivies (often <20cm/360) are WAY too high, especially for a game like Reflex   Definitely, but I think there are good reasons for that. First, sensitivity depends on DPI, and the average cheap mouse has significantly lower DPI than the gaming mice that you (I assume) and I use. Second, the average person doesn't have a large enough mousepad to use mid-low sensitivities comfortably.  edit: but I don't agree that <20cm is way too high for Reflex. I was thinking of higher sensitivities than that. It's quite high, but I think some people can do well with 15-20. (And I wouldn't say that Reflex requires a lower sensitivity than other shooters.)"
reflex,35azpq,phy1um,1 point,Fri May 8 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"Somewhere around 32-36cm/360, using my FK @ 1150dpi.  I completely disagree about needing the same sensitivities between all games. From UT to CS to Quake-family games I have drastically different setups. It doesn't hinder my ability to swap at all. I can even play one game of Quake Live on 40cm/360 with accel, then swap to 30cm/360 no accel and still aim in the same way. I'm still the same player, I still set up for shots in the same way. Obviously it will have some impact on what crazy flick shots I hit, but as someone who has recently played with my setup a lot it matters less than I ever expected.  Even within Quake-like games I have slightly different mouse settings. I use 38-45cm/360 + accel in QL, Warsow and CPMA, but I have a faster base sens and more accel in my QW config. The games require slightly different kinds of mouse movements, and I've tweaked my settings to best cater to that.   Don't limit yourself to a mindset that everything has to be consistent between games. Make sure you're comfortable with the movements the game requires you to make. Be confident and calm, and most importantly reflect on how you're aiming. Even if you need to adjust to a new setup, there's no reason you can't hit some great shots in the meantime."
reflex,35azpq,zypsilon,1 point,Sat May 9 01:07:59 2015 UTC,"It doesn't hinder my ability to swap at all.    Interesting, I couldn't manage at all. Even switching from Skyrim to QL was awkward until I used mouse-sensitivity.com. And I feel now that when I play CS I also improve in QL."
reflex,35azpq,ReinH,0,Sun May 10 13:04:31 2015 UTC,"Note: If you're actually using mouse acceleration by choice, it will probably throw this method off.   Most professional quake players use mouse accel, so it isn't uncommon or wrong in an arena fps. It's personal preference."
reflex,356bl8,phgpzev,1 point,Thu May 7 13:52:51 2015 UTC,"This is seriously cool!  Will r_sun 1 be able to based off time of the day locally? or was it something the mapmakers could decide for their maps?  Also for the new start and finish zones for racemode, would it be possible to create separate zones for timing specific parts of a map?"
reflex,356h19,NEED_A_JACKET,3,Thu May 7 14:39:38 2015 UTC,"The art direction has changed more towards how it is in the last video. However, that last video was meant to look calmer / not have the same wireframe / glowing / neon things shown (until the end when the steps appear). The final product will be a combination of the two. Still bright neon glowing parts, but more textured / metalic looking than the trailer, and less dark.  My current view with item timing is when you pick it up, it will tell you (and only you) the time before it respawns, so that players not familiar with the timings will know when to expect it. However, there won't be on-going timers on the HUD, or timers over the item pickups. I personally think it adds a lot to the game to delay pickups and have to keep track of timing in your head. This might change during playtesting but that's my current take on it."
reflex,356h19,zangerinus,2,Thu May 7 18:57:09 2015 UTC,"I was thinking it would just be a HUD message (I'll probably use the chat area for notifications such as this too, mainly for beginners, probably something most people would eventually turn off), saying '100 Health picked up, respawning in 30 seconds' - that type of thing. So they still have to keep track of the timing but they know how long each item takes to respawn (which would be the choice of the mapper so it might vary).  As for the weapons / tools:  Rocket = slow projectile, prediction weapon, with wallbanging splash damage  Rocket alt fire = shotgun style area covering shots  Lightning gun = constant firing weapon (splash damage through walls)  Lightning gun alt fire = fast shooting projectile weapon (similar to Quakes plasma) with wallbanging  Rail = High damage hitscan weapon, low rate of fire  Rail alt fire = reflecting rail shots (not shown in the trailer) for indirect hits since the rail does not do damage through surfaces unlike the other weapons. Weapon ""charges"" similar to the guass gun from HL1. Also adds a velocity boost if you're in the air when it's fired. The amount the rail bounces is dependent on how long it's charged for.   Tripmine weapon = Single beam tripwire spawned where the bullet hits.  Area denial, blocking paths or making them difficult / making the enemy pass through the beams which will damage them and reveal their position due to sound, as well as encouraging advanced movement to navigate around the beams, or forcing enemys down a certain route.  Tripmine alt fire = ""grenade"" style area denial (only lasts a second), fires beams out in various directions. High damage if they hit multiple beams from it IE if they are close to it.  Time displacement weapon = Fires a projectile that spawns a large sphere, anything inside it (projectiles, players etc) are forced into a low timescale (slowed movement, low rate of fire). Lasts only a short while. A different type of arena denial to the tripmine weapon. Used to fully block areas unless the enemy wants to risk moving through it. Scaled so that the closer they are to the 'center' of the sphere, the slower time passes (same applies for rockets entering/leaving the sphere). Also useful for 'blocking' projectiles & bullets. Current thinking is that hitscan weapons (LG/rail) will be warped around the center of the sphere making it difficult to accurately shoot through. IE, you could spawn one before passing an opening to block shots if you're aware the enemy is waiting.  Time displacement alt = Not a weapon as such, holding the alt key takes all of your velocity (quickly slows you down) from all directions, when the key is released or the alt key is held long enough, it re-adds your velocity in the direction you're facing. Useful for moving around / changing direction fast, adds a speed boost. IE you could be moving horizontally (bunnyhopping forward for example), press the key when in mid air so it steals your velocity, face upwards and unpress the key and you'll have the full velocity except going straight upwards now. Not the only use case but that example allows you to reach high areas easily, adding more vertical gameplay.  I think it's important to note that all weapons have a method of hitting people who aren't visible. This ties in with the ""wallhack"" effect when people make sounds behind walls. Giving away their position is more risky because of the various ways they can be attacked while behind cover.  The first three weapons and their alts I'm reasonably certain on staying. I think it's a good mix / variety without any redundant weapons (not simply the same weapon with different speed/damage variables). The latter two are more experimental and would be up to the mapper to include or not. Might not work out too well in testing and end up not being used in all maps."

reflex,356h19,Parzic,5,Fri May 8 05:24:35 2015 UTC,"Conceptually the only difference is it adds an accuracy to information given in most games. All games give you an indication of where players are when they make sounds, but there's guess work involved in their exact position. This just places a higher importance on staying quiet, plus it means you don't need loud sound levels to play. A deaf person could play the game with no real disadvantage, or you could play with music on etc.  I wouldn't call it a built-in wallhack, because all players have the ability to stay hidden by moving silently."

reflex,33mlou,Puppy_stomper,5,Thu Apr 23 19:19:15 2015 UTC,"What he said. Originally, we tested replacing the bolt rifle with a projectile (basically the stake gun). This meant that we needed a long range finisher and that's what the chain gun was designed for. With bolt becoming hitscan, the chaingun will become a more traditional plasma gun used for spam/suppression."
reflex,33mlou,fleabitten,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:51:51 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem to mop up as well as the LG since you have to lead a little (may be my shit ping usually), seems like it takes an hour and a half to kill anyone with any sort of armor (vs. unarmored targets it's redundant), and it doesn't seem useful for chip damage (Rail?).    I do not think that this thinking is how it’s supposed to work, at least it didn’t work like that in quake. In q3, lg+rail+rockets are basically the best weapons in 95% of situations, but since you do not always have all of those available (e.g. if you spawned upper ya in ztn), you need to find situations where the lesser weapons can perform well (fights in the ra corridors on ztn).  An interesting twist could maybe be to increase midair knockback for chain/plasma and decrease it for shaft, which could lead to chain replacing shaft as a go-to weapon for levitating."

EDIT: I watched the trailer with the concept art for some of the levels, and the weapons would actually fit extremely well.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=94&v=s7plphgW0tU  Really, we just need a steam-punk themed robot and we should be good?

I dunno, I feel like when you overly stylize a game towards a specific sub culture (In this case steam punk) you're narrowing it's scope to the potential player base. I think it's better to keep something generic as the base style for the game and then allow creativity on the individual maps and weapon skins. You still get that room for creativity and artistic expression but you aren't turning away people who aren't fans of a specific style."

reflex,330qi8,Elite552,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:03:36 2015 UTC,"The devs have referred to it as taking place in the 30's, so I wouldn't worry too much about your first point. As for your second question I'm quoting one of the devs   Silhouette, mesh/texture colour, effect colour (on gun while held), light emission colour and player stance  Are the main points of interest we'll be focusing on for clear distinction with the weapons. I believe player stance is extremely important as it gives the entire player a unique silhouette when using a particular weapon. So even though a player might be so far away that the weapon is only a few pixels in screen real estate, you still know what they have by the way they're holding it."

reflex,330qi8,mizzu704,-1,Sat Apr 18 12:38:30 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with aesthetics or graphics. What I mean is that the weapons should be both easily recognizable, which benefits the gameplay in a huge way, meaning you can actually see the weapons, AND easily understandable, meaning players know what the weapons do pretty much. I don't mean that the weapons should completely lack any detail whatsoever. Read my other reply.    As a result, nobody plays these games   Yeah, like TF2? There are sooooooo many other problems there why people don't play these games. People also played Quake in its day, so that statement is false in every way.  Edit: And to add (because I write up my comments too fast) I am 100% fine with steampunk aesthetic. That is not the problem. Just cut down on the level of detail and basically make a unique, ""recognizable"" gun"
reflex,330qi8,phipb,2,Sat Apr 18 12:54:42 2015 UTC,"I thought about this a bit, and I came to the conclusion that TF2’s easy readability is a factor that the game was deliberately designed for (source) and that the lack of detail is not necessarily a prerequisite for it. If you let the enemy model in reflex hold the plasma like the heavy holds his minigun, hold the bolt rifle like the sniper holds his sniper rifle and hold the shaft like the medic holds his syringe gun, they might turn out to be easily distinguishable."
reflex,330qi8,mizzu704,3,Sun Apr 19 00:16:11 2015 UTC,"Yes and that leads into the character design which they're probably working on at some point. However weapon design is importnant too and if the guns are the way they are they will be too similar and the shape and outline is hard to distinguish. Worry not though, it seems the devs have the right idea now."

reflex,32qmp0,Gilanguar,2,Thu Apr 16 11:05:24 2015 UTC,"I'm everywhere. Some kind or organised newbie night on the sidebar or Reflex forums might be useful, people could organise a TS and find a server to sit in and play with others of a similar skill level."
reflex,32qmp0,1b59d9bd844d438daed1,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:04:22 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a good idea, as you saw last night, I could use some practice haha"
reflex,32qmp0,rinc,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:08:32 2015 UTC,"did you see the QL newbie nights from early last year? that format was a lot of fun and widely appreciated both the NA and EU variant, if someone has the time to organize it for reflex I'd love to participate.  example form last year's eu newbie nights: https://www.reddit.com/r/QuakeLive/comments/1x957c/eu_newbie_duel_night_saturday_3pm_cet_details/"
reflex,32qmp0,ponyeater,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:28:34 2015 UTC,"Hey, I sent you a friend request. I have the same problem, I get totally wrecked in every game I play."
reflex,32qmp0,asdfrofl1,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"Hi. Send you friend request. We have our own ded. server, currently 3 ppl regularly playing skill level noob. We all come from q3ra so we do a lot of silly rocket jumps waiting for some rail :-D We mostly play ffa or tdm. So no brutal duel stuff."
reflex,32qmp0,Qzkx,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:59:12 2015 UTC,I saw your server yesterday and thought that faceit was thinking on getting into reflex :>
reflex,32qmp0,HiVoltage,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:28:31 2015 UTC,"will add you. i don't play much, but i am not very good."
reflex,32qmp0,rand__all,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:49:28 2015 UTC,slowdive sent you one
reflex,32poif,phgpzev,5,Wed Apr 15 18:32:31 2015 UTC,you guys are doing a fantastic job!
reflex,32poif,asdfrofl1,5,Wed Apr 15 18:36:48 2015 UTC,Thanks allot asdfrifl1! nice to hear that every once in a while in-between all the idiots on the web ^
reflex,32poif,iQueQq,4,Wed Apr 15 21:37:58 2015 UTC,This is legit sick. Not just functional but very pretty too. In a game that's pre-alpha! I'm fanboying hard right now.  Great job!
reflex,32poif,VioletMaid,5,Wed Apr 15 21:47:18 2015 UTC,Get involved dude! We need people to share their runs and create maps for Reflexrun! glad you are impressed! tell us what you would like to see in the comments below over at phgp.tv ;)
reflex,32poif,BenDarling,3,Wed Apr 15 22:50:30 2015 UTC,"This is extremely cool, awesome job!"
reflex,32nwnu,kism3,4,Wed Apr 15 08:15:19 2015 UTC,"The sound is perfect   I don't think so.  Gun noises don't follow the player correctly, some guns sound rather poor and I don't like how thunderously, destructively, overpoweringly loud the landing sound is."
reflex,32nwnu,Mezecs,2,Thu Apr 16 04:53:42 2015 UTC,I don't like how thunderously loud the landing sound is   I'm mostly a DeFRaG player so I love it
reflex,32nwnu,exocortex,3,Thu Apr 16 06:53:39 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. Although I am totally happy with the lightmaps. the clear textures right now make the lightmaps much more visible; meaning you can see the subtle gradients on them. I love this style right now.  The flickering Items are annoying me a little, I hope they will become opaque or at least have some opaque elements (maybe a solid armor with a transparent shine around it).  the round Portals right now are quite beautiful. the only thing I wish for is to have a few alternatives in color. maybe the defs can hear this and have a few minutes :) I'd like to have the same portal in green, yellow, red, blue, cyan, pink, white, lime...  the portal-texture is very"" eye-cancerish"" right now. it would be great if it was skaled up to have less fine structure. a wobbling liquid thing like it is now is nice.  the rocket-effect is not fitting into the minimal theme right now. I prefer the minimal theme right now and therefor wish for a simpler rocket-explosion (maybe a round semitransparent disk or ring or hexagon). If they want to get rid of the minimal theme maybe that rocket right now fits. I would like the possibility to adjust this somehow (if I choose the minimal look lolike it is now)"
reflex,32nwnu,ziel,3,Wed Apr 15 10:48:49 2015 UTC,+1 for the round portals and more colours for round portals
reflex,32nwnu,biomatter,2,Wed Apr 15 11:18:09 2015 UTC,"Replying to the 2nd 4.  I assume you mean the weird angle the shaft and rail come from. This appears to be a bug when you hide your gun. Try showing your gun, but moving it offscreen instead.  I use x, y = 0 and z = -20.   I would find the commands for you if I weren't on my phone."
reflex,32nwnu,phipb,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:24:27 2015 UTC,"cl_weapon_offset_x 0 cl_weapon_offset_y 0 cl_weapon_offset_z -20  FYI to anyone else who doesn't know how to move around their weapon :)  I personally use [x 0, y -13] for a center-aligned low weapon. I'm scrub and still need my weapon on screen to remind myself what to heck I'm doing."
reflex,32nwnu,phipb,1 point,Thu Apr 16 08:49:54 2015 UTC,I felt like small ramps inhibited my movement a little bit.  Also I played with you yesterday :)
reflex,32nwnu,phipb,2,Wed Apr 15 11:03:31 2015 UTC,So you were the one that 50 - 0'd me  Disclaimer: I'm more of a DeFRaG player than a CPMA player
reflex,32nwnu,exocortex,4,Wed Apr 15 11:12:58 2015 UTC,Probably no. My ingame name was Jason. I played in ffa. It was also my first time playing ever and I sucked.
reflex,32m3bz,ChrisMrNorth,9,Tue Apr 14 21:52:48 2015 UTC,OMG it's downloaded! Chills and everything omg omg omg!!!!!!!
reflex,32m3bz,fleabitten,7,Tue Apr 14 21:53:14 2015 UTC,Let us know how it goes ;)
reflex,32m3bz,themcs,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:33:31 2015 UTC,"Great! Although I got confused by the speed gaining system, but then again I wasn't expecting it to be just like CPMA in Q3. Might just be my bad computer, but I experience lots of fps drops when using rockets etc. Going through guides atm to configure stuff and possibly fixing this, though. Overall, fucking love it. And community is great!"
reflex,32m3bz,yungwerther,2,Wed Apr 15 14:04:22 2015 UTC,"The movement mechanics are essentially identical to CPMA. There are some slight differences in optimal strafejump angles and air control yaw speed,  but the mechanics work the same."
reflex,32m3bz,Spannzer,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:03:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, although I think I expressed myself with fault. What I meant was that in CPMA, I used to be able to hold i.e. W & D, and use that as strafing, and I'd still have massive aircontrol. In CPMA, this was one of the most used features, and it was absolutely amazing. Reflex does add the speed, but the aircontrol is nearly none at all. Dropping the W does give more control, but less speed gain.    Not saying this is bad, though. Just different. Also, looking forward to crouching abilities. Me and like 10 others in a DM server jumped on top of each others and tried jumping and using hammer to see how high we'd get. Was lot's of fun, but lack of crouching made it so clumsy! Was really fun though! :D I'm in love with this game."

reflex,32k86s,phgpzev,4,Tue Apr 14 13:40:55 2015 UTC,"Hype, I have spent orders of magnitude more time in DeFRaG compared to Q3/CPMA.  Lua scripting + replay support / input recording opens the door for leaderboards"
reflex,32k86s,kism3,3,Tue Apr 14 13:54:28 2015 UTC,I have seen the devs state multiple times that they have plans for a defrag mode and global leaderboards. It probably won't have a very high priority but I think it is very likely that eventually it will come.
reflex,32k86s,ziel,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:24:13 2015 UTC,It is available now bro O/ - http://phgp.tv/news/reflexrun-available-now/ Get in contact with us through the phgp.tv we should stream some of your skills :D
