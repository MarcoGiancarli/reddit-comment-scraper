Well, the alcohol and tobaco people certainly haven't heard that news yet.   Or are you trying to say that nobody would buy things that got you sick often? In that case, there are millions of poor restaurants out there, looking to prove you wrong. People don't buy stuff that makes them sick more than once, but they might very well buy it once.  I personally I haven ever had any bad experience with sushi from any place, but I feel there is a risk involved, just like with any kind of unprocessed food."

sushi,3e551v,Autistic_Alpaca,2,Wed Jul 22 01:59:48 2015 UTC,Just the fact that it is frozen is enough. Anything that has been frozen will have all the parasites in it killed. This particular tuna with the carbon monoxide added for color retention is used in a lot of sushi places as their cheaper #2 tuna instead of the #1.
sushi,3e551v,Rubyru11,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:28:24 2015 UTC,Awesome thank you.
sushi,3e551v,Autistic_Alpaca,4,Wed Jul 22 02:32:37 2015 UTC,"It is not true that any frozen fish is safe to consume raw. It must be kept at a sufficiently low temperature for a long enough period of time for the parasites to be killed. For example, please don't interpret that to mean you can buy fresh fish at a grocery store, put it in your freezer overnight then thaw it and eat it raw the next day. That is not safe.  I'm not saying this isn't safe to eat, but saying that frozen means safe to eat raw shouldn't be your only guideline."
sushi,3e551v,crediblevests,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:47:06 2015 UTC,This is true. I was speaking for this particular picture where the fish has obviously been frozen for longer than 2 weeks

I've also had Saba (mackerel) that were grilled on top of nigiri.  Are you friends ok with lox and cured salmon?

I just don't eat it all the time because of the high sodium levels.  I call it a Hawaii roll, because of having to import everything from the mainland Hawaiians import lots of spam, they love it and make musubi out of it. And the fact that Hawaii has always grown pineapple gave me the idea for said roll. When I made it though the pineapple I got was in too small chunks so I improvised with some mango.

My mom took us out and she's very frugal, so I avoided ordering toro (25 for four pieces and delicious) and uni (16 for four pieces and not that great here.)  With tip it ended up being 28pp.  Last time I came with my girlfriend we did a nigiri omakase+two baked halibut dishes for 50USD each. The omakase usually range from 30-40 but the chef is responsive to whatever you want and speaks very good English.

sushi,3difo4,jba,40,Thu Jul 16 15:06:53 2015 UTC,"Hope these pics are of interest - i know a bunch of /r/sushi people have dined with Masa at 15East..  For those who haven't - Masato Shimizu was the head chef at 15East in NYC - a michelin starred sushi restaurant in Union Square. Widely considered to be the one of the best sushi chef's in NYC (if not the nation). He trained for 8 years in Tokyo before coming to the US and spent 15 years between Jewel Bako (where he also had a Michelin Star) and then 15East, where he built a powerhouse of a restaurant focused on super-traditional Edomae style sushi.   Unfortunately for us, his wife recently took a job in Thailand, and he decided to move to Bankok with her. 15East has been left in good hands with Taka from Sushi Ann uptown, but Masa will be sorely missed for his gregarious style, deep knowledge of the history of sushi, and perfect technique (curing, aging, rice-prep, knifework, etc..). Also just a great guy. As soon as I found out he was leaving, I nabbed the last day he was doing service & it was a spectacular meal. One of the best I can remember. Perfect warm rice, perfect fish temp, unbelievable variety of fish/shellfish and perfect pacing / service.   The good news is that he'll be opening a sushi-ya in Bangkok later this year. Should make for a nice divergence in a city with a ton of great food.   edit: thanks for the gold! :D"

At $140pp, you keep getting food till you tap-out. :D   Pricey, but no-where near the most expensive in NYC, where Nakazawa, Masa, Ichimura, Yasuda, Gari, Karuma, Ko, Soto, among many others are more expensive. 'Masa' (Masayoshi Takayama), in particular now runs $1500+ for a party of two. (lol)  http://www.eater.com/2014/5/1/6232853/masa-is-still-americas-most-expensive-sushi-restaurant  Disregarding price, 15East with Masato is/was the best of the bunch - sometimes by a wide margin.

Ask for the bar with Nobu - they do a 10/11 or 17/18 piece nigiri-only omakase (depends on what's available) for ~$60 or ~$80 or the 'Super Omakase' which is $120ish & includes lots of tsumame + sashimi. I usually stick with the nigiri omakase + some oysters. Enjoy.

sushi,3djycm,mattcushing,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:04:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Do you make your own sushi? If so, how long did it take you to get better?"
sushi,3djycm,mattcushing,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:46:29 2015 UTC,"I do.  My daughter has celiac disease and loves sushi so rather than take the risk of getting her sick, she and my wife got me a kit for my birthday and my daughter and I started making it together.  At first I wasn't making it often so I wasn't improving, but now it's cheap to by shrimp and pressed crab, so I usually do it once or twice a week.  I find myself watching a lot of videos to pick up simple tips so at this point, 4 years later, I'm pretty good at it.  Few essential things I learned in my travels: 1) use either plastic wrap or a gallon ziploc on the rolling mat so you don't have rice sticking between the slats.  I prefer the ziploc approach. 2) keep a bowl of water handy to dip into.  It's essential to keep your hands fairly wet while handling rice, and you will need to dip your knife periodically when cutting the rolls. 3) prep everything while the rice is cooking.  You shouldn't be doing any slicing once you are ready to roll. 4) if you don't have a rice cooker, get one.  You can get them pretty cheap and you don't need anything fancy.  My roommate in college got us a 30$ one with one button and it's 20 years later and I'm still using it. 5) pay attention to the directions of the ratio of water to rice for the cooker.  It's usually safe to go with a 1:1 ratio of water to rice, some people do 1:1.2, but I'm happy with the rice I get. 6) have a big bowl for the rice prep once it's cooked and drizzle the rice wine mixture (su) over it evenly.  Then use slicing motions to mix it up - keeps it from crushing the rice or turning it to mush. 7) have a really sharp knife.  I got what is called a yanigaba from Kohls for like 40$ and it was worth every penny.  Sushi chefs typically spend hundreds on these knives, but they're awesome. 8) don't try to do too much at once, start small (but I mentioned that already) 9) personal preference - I like to do all of my rolling, and then cut all of the rolls at once.  Gives the nori a chance to stay stuck :) 10) if you decide to get fancy and put stuff on top of  your rolls to incorporate color and flavor, plastic wrap is your friend.  You can drape a piece over the roll, use the rolling mat to form it, and then cut it, removing the film once you're done. 11) in the beginning, keep it simple and keep it cheap.  Don't go out and buy loads of fish - stick with crab and cooked shrimp to get the technique and make your mistakes on :)  A few websites I regularly watch - http://www.secretsofsushi.com/, http://www.makesushi.com/, and their youtube channels.  I also follow NoVE Kitchen and Bar, and Chef Tom has some good stuff.  honestly, all of the advice I'm giving you is stuff I picked up from these sites and watching youtube.  When you get a chance to make your first batch, make sure you post it here.  This group is great about feedback and tips and tricks to make you better.  I had a really hard time with  undercooked rice until someone told me the correct ratio.  Hope this helps and good luck!"

sushi,3ddl6m,C0L4ND3R,3,Thu Jul 16 00:41:16 2015 UTC,"The crispy rice is something I've never seen at a restaurant before oddly enough.  It was excellent contrast of texture, but not something I would want more than a couple of in one sitting.  Taste was fantastic.  The beef I could eat all night, but let's face it, I didn't go to a sushi restaurant for beef.  The salmon belly had no discernible difference in taste from usual good salmon, but it was much softer in the mouth, almost no chewing required.  The yellowtail belly was very very good.  Probably only the second or third time I've had this, but it was my favorite piece and I wish I had ordered it as sashimi and ignored the rice all together.  Again, almost melt in the mouth.  The spear squid I like because it doesn't ""chew"" as much as a lot of squid.  It's firmer, almost crisp.  Milder taste than some other squids as well.  The o-toro was a letdown.  It was almost too fatty.  It wasn't melt in your mouth either, but the taste was excellent.  The spicy scallop roll was under-spiced, but the scallop was excellent.    The uni was fantastic.  One of my favorites.  I am not remembering the name, but this, yellower, uni is my favorite kind.  It's just a hint salty and needs to be with good rice.  If the rice isn't there it seems to be too much flavor at once.  The California roll was run of the mill, but with real crab as you would generally expect from a better sushi restaurant.  The kitchen sink was one of their house special rolls so I figured why not.  A lot of flavors going on but you could easily tell each of the fish. The sauce was mild and very complementary."

The sushi was small but honestly that's better if you're looking for the variety.  When you first set down they give you a pencil and a card with a list of all the sushi they offer. You mark up to 5 options that you want. When they bring your 5 items they give you another card to fill out but after your first 5 you can only order 2 items at a time for the rest of your meal. when they bring those two you get another card to fill out and so on. Whatever you don't eat they charge you $1 per piece. Really not a bad setup and the sushi was delicious.

sushi,3d8pmq,Iclipse,4,Tue Jul 14 12:26:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who's changed many of someone's negatively preconceived notion of sushi, there's a good possibility that you haven't had actually good, high quality sushi with the authentic neta (toppings). Chances are you and your friends go for the ""rolls"" which are filled with lower grade or not fresh fish and drowned with the Sriracha/Japanese Mayo/eel sauce in order to mask the fish.  I've had a close friend and another roommate both initially hate sushi. First, I'll talk about my friend who also happened to be a roommate as well. He is of Indian background, meaning he's used to really intense, spicy flavors that's the opposite of authentic Japanese sushi which are subtle and complex in its own way. He had told me that he didn't like sushi. The perpetrator that brought him that conceived notion was... a bad Spicy Tuna Roll. When we went to a local izakaya (a Japanese pub, essentially), he was really hesitant to try a slice of maguro (lean tuna) sashimi. However, the moment it landed on his tastebuds, he was immediately surprised of how clean it tasted. A couple of weeks later, we went to a sushi restaurant that served very authentic preparations of sushi (not only were the neta (toppings) offered that were commonly eaten in Japan, but they preseasoned their sushi which did not require any additional soy sauce or wasabi). Also, when I had told him that we'd be sitting at the sushi bar with the chef right before us instead of at the table, he had expressed his disinterest as he had wanted more privacy. However not only did he like the experience at the sushi bar but he also became a huge fan of sushi and greatly developed an appreciation for it. The authentically prepared preseasoned sushi along with the high quality neta completely did a 180 of his negatively preconceived notion of sushi from that experience with the bad Spicy Tuna Roll. In addition, he was really glad to experience dining at the sushi bar and has been choosing that as an option since when he goes back. It's because it's paced one piece or a couple at a time as you'll witness and understand the progression throughout the meal in addition to spreading the food throughout the meal instead of eating all at once while the first made sushi just sits there on the plate instead of at the bar where each piece given is freshly made. In addition, it's fun and entertaining to talk and ask questions and learning about each piece of sushi served before you. It's because of that aspect where he thought it would be a great place to bring a date to in order to eliminate the very much possible of silence that can make a date quite awkward, especially since it's usually the guy that has to not only bring up but maintain the momentum of the conversation.  With how I changed the perception of sushi with the other roommate, she too had a bad experience in similar fashion like my friend. This time however, I had recommended that she'd watch ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" before she, I and my friend mentioned earlier go to the same sushi restaurant. After she finished the movie, she immediately developed a better appreciation for sushi as it's not just simply cut the fish and put & press it on a small mound of vinegared rice. When we finally arrived, she to ended up liking it a lot more than previously before.  tl;dr - It's possible that you've had unauthentic preparations of sushi which most likely is of lower quality which is why not only is it way cheaper than the authentically prepared and fresher sushi but why it's smothered in sauce to mask the unfresh fish and the reason you possibly don't like sushi. I hope you can try a place that serves unaltered, authentically Japanese preparations of sushi using high quality, fresher neta and chances are you'll start developing an appreciation for it.  Here's the place where I took them to for reference. Although I preach about authentic neta, there's one exception in the blog post which is the Iberico Ham sushi at the end. It's because unlike some of the other unauthentic toppings, it's of much higher quality translating to better flavor: http://themetropolitanlounge.blogspot.com/2012/10/roc-ikko-2nd-review-amazing-edo-mae.html"
sushi,3d8pmq,inferno229,2,Wed Jul 15 18:22:12 2015 UTC,"Try and find something you like about the taste, or texture while you chew.  Chew slow and see if you can distinguish between the types and realize that if you don't like one type it doesn't necessarily mean you won't like another.  I think you might have a stigma/uncomfortableness with sushi.  I used to vehemently dislike all vegetables and you explaining how you eat sushi kind of sound like how I used to eat vegetables(mainly the green ones).  I eventually came around to vegetables by experimenting, for example not taking the pickles off my burger.  Take baby steps and make sure you are getting good quality sushi."
sushi,3d8pmq,dontgiveadamn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:55:52 2015 UTC,"I was a very fussy eater as a kid that had similar reactions to a lot of foods and it sounds like your gag reflex is triggered by the concept or smell of  sushi.  It came with age but also a different mindset when it came to food that I was able to be more open to flavour experiences and hence food as a whole. When I go to eat something that I think is unappetising or unappealing or that I havent enjoyed in the past, I try to acknowledge and then dismiss that bias and go in with a clear head. I ease my brain, and try to turn off that trigger of disgust because its very easy to gag on something if its a flavor you havent experienced (or experienced negatively) previously. Try to tell your brain to accept that this food isnt poison, it's simply an unfamiliar flavor and try to embrace that difference as it is rather than trying to expect or anticipate something.  Some sort of palette cleansing item like ginger or an apertiff drink might help with this.  Really try to taste the sushi and decide whether that taste is something you dislike or if its simply unexpected or different.  As someone else said, try to pinpoint if its a taste or a texture that is causing the reaction of if its just a mental thing."

sushi,3d1pb6,14_year_old_girl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:54:44 2015 UTC,Any commercial fishing operation worth its salt flash freezes.
sushi,3d1pb6,rext12,2,Mon Jul 13 04:28:32 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between freezing and flash-freezing. What Ramsay is referring to in this video is regular freezing like in a walk in cooler/freezer- but regardless of whether or not you buy the fish raw at the market, it was most likely flash frozen out at sea, on the boat it was captured on, in order to preserve it long enough for the trip back, and to kill any parasites.  Now, I'm no science buff, so someone who better knows their chemistry/biology can chime in, but flash-freezing, as opposed to regular freezing, is done in order to prevent degradation of cells/cell membranes, and formation of ice crystals. That's the 'frozen' taste Ramsay might be referring to- a subtle 'frostbitten' taste. On the boat, the fish are caught and brought down to cryogenic temperatures WAYYY below freezing in an instant, as opposed to over a longer period of time. By the time the fish is at the market, they will no longer be frozen- (this is the raw fish you see at the counter, ready to be served.)  From here, a restaurant would cut, prepare, season, etc. their fish, properly wrapping up and maintaining any extras in a very cold fridge, not a freezer. The only reason I see for a restaurant to freeze fish is if they can't manage fish orders, and they have far too much in stock- that's on the person in charge for ordering too much. At our restaurant, we maintain an average amount of fish per order. Any time we're low, we kindly tell our customers we can't provide that 10 piece sashimi plate. Any time we're over stocked, you'll see the owner/head chef cutting some for our own lunch, or maybe sitting in the back kitchen with a beer and an otherwise expensive plate of sashimi.  TL:DR: Flash-frozen =/= frozen"

sushi,3cvgio,sweetbeeps,10,Sat Jul 11 05:58:13 2015 UTC,"I don't have an exact answer, but a place near me does the same thing. They have a waiter come to you and you order every so often, but you can only order a few items at a time. You also have to eat all of the food on your plate (within reason, like you can leave a grain of rice or some sauce) or else they refuse to bring you more.

Out :tuna, spicy sauce, sriracha, flying fish roe & 7 spice  To be honest the wife really hated it, I didnt hate it but the size killed the price being good(we ordered two other rolls and everything came to $50 but just so small) the shrimp was very impressive tho.

sushi,3cov3q,CreeperFish,3,Thu Jul 9 18:34:51 2015 UTC,Negitoro is basically minced tuna belly with green onions. The white fluffy balls are tempura balls which add a sort of crunchy texture but not really any flavor. The sweet sauce could be anything not really sure.

Then a drink there to sip while they have a soup to start and then go to a simple roll, like California.   Tell them to use a little more soy sauce than normal if they seem hesitant.   After the first roll try something a little different/better and go from there!"
sushi,3cckse,pacollegENT,15,Mon Jul 6 22:09:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly, get them white girl wasted and starve them for hours beforehand. Also, make sure you surround your friend with ridiculously good-looking people eating sushi. It'll create credibility.  And lastly, start with a beginner's deep fried roll. California rolls are bland. Work your way into the complicated stuff.   I work as a sushi chef, and I use these tactics everyday."

Then my uncle ordered a combo platter with all kinds of sashimi and nigiri and I just took the plunge and totally loved it. I guess it depends on the person, but if they're not too freaked out by raw fish, I would just recommend something that's honestly really good and gives them an accurate idea of what they're getting into with sushi."

sushi,3cckse,amyria,2,Mon Jul 6 22:10:08 2015 UTC,Yea I was one of those people who went straight for tuna rolls from the get go. California rolls made me think my step dad was trying to make me eat healthier foods by tricking me (I was about 9/10 when I started eating sushi).
sushi,3cckse,vatobob,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:18:33 2015 UTC,I would also recommend nigiri as a starting point. That was how I got hooked on it.

This is how my husband introduced it to me. I stick with rolls though. I'm not much for the nigiri or sashimi.  P.S. Eel sauce on rolls is amazing too, but eventually add that."

sushi,3cckse,Daakwan,3,Tue Jul 7 03:27:02 2015 UTC,"I've gotten several people to be sushi lovers by simply asking them what they do and don't like. The common misconception is that all sushi has some form of raw fish in it and we  know that's not true. After that it's a simple matter of finding what roll has what they like on it, or at the very least what roll doesn't have what they don't like.  From personal experience the rolls that convert people the most are the deep fried rolls. The savory flavor of the sauces and the batter tend to overpower the taste of items they may not like. I can't stand salmon but if it's in a fried roll  smothered in eel sauce and spicy mayo I'll eat it alllllllll daaaaaaay."

sushi,3cckse,SnallTrippin,4,Mon Jul 6 22:05:36 2015 UTC,I got my girlfriend into it with some of the deep fried rolls - not my jam - i'm more of a sashimi guy but atleast she likes going out for sushi now
sushi,3cckse,tetri5,2,Mon Jul 6 22:18:02 2015 UTC,lots of uni and raw squid should terrify them for life.  Stay away from anything funky.  Try tempura in addition to some sushi rolls.  Maybe order some tuna or salmon nigiri and see if it piques their tastebuds.  Sushi is not for everybody.  It is an acquired taste.
sushi,3cckse,coloradofishtapes,2,Tue Jul 7 11:22:18 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend went from vegetarian to sushi loving thanks to me! I started her with a straight up cucumber roll (kappa maki) to get her used to the flavors of the rice and the seaweed. Then moved into a tuna roll (tekka maki) to introduce the texture and taste of the fish. Which since she already liked the kappa maki, it didn't really change much, just more umami flavor. Then Cali roll, then some salmon sushi, yellowtail and finished it off with tamago. Overall it worked out well, she eats chirashi bowls like crazy and craves uni constantly. Hope this helps!"
sushi,3cckse,interrupting_cat,2,Tue Jul 7 03:11:33 2015 UTC,Tuna. All the tuna.
sushi,3cckse,javy_,3,Tue Jul 7 00:03:00 2015 UTC,"This. For me it started with freshly caught tuna, just straight out of the water with a bit of soy sauce. No rice, no nothing. just tuna. Yum."

I basically will never order salmon, either nigiri or sushi, unless there's something special about it, like it's sockeye or king, or it's cured or tataki, or a white salmon.  I like salmon in every preparation except its pure raw form, and even then, it's mostly farmed atlantic salmon that I dislike, which is 99% of what you come across.    Everything else is fair game.  I especially love scallops, uni, and shiromi-dane."
sushi,3cdema,YepYepImaRep,2,Wed Jul 8 22:40:46 2015 UTC,"I am a big fan of octopus or squid as nigiri topping. There is something about both the taste and the texture that draws me towards it. Salmon's also tasty, but I never knowingly had salmon and advocado together.   As for the least favorite ingredients... chilli or anything that makes a roll taste of nothing but ""mouth on fire"" - and fried onions, it has a weird texture in a roll which I am not too fond of."
sushi,3cdema,TenNinetythree,2,Tue Jul 7 23:20:03 2015 UTC,"ugh yes, I can deal with a bit of spiciness but I don't understand the point of eating a roll that's pure heat.

I really love spicy tuna when it's a piece of tuna with a spicy mayo not ground up into a paste. Egg sushi isn't my favorite but it's really interesting I think it's called tomago maybe I don't remember? I've also had a shrimp tempura roll with filet mignon on the top of it was glorious but that's not like a common thing haha. In terms of stuff I hate pretty much anything with crab. Generally the places I go because of my area only have imitation crab I haven't really tried anything with real crab so I'm not sure
sushi,3cdema,ddboi437,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:34:19 2015 UTC,"Salmon is my favourite. I'll eat it sashimi, nigiri, in a roll, basically any way. I'm also a fan of fish roe, tobiko in particular (I actually don't like salmon roe). Tuna belly is amazing and scallops are great raw or seared.   I like most things but I'm a bit sceptical of uni and have yet to try it. I also dislike carrots and vegetables that aren't either cucumber or avocado."

For the sushi, start with fresh flavors, Hikari-mono like kohada (gizzard shad), aji (horse mackerel).  Move on to the delicate whites, like Tai, Suzuki, Shima-aji, Ika. Go to the fattier stuff; Hamachi (or better yet, buri), Kampachi...stuff like Akami, Ikura also go well here. Finish with the rich stuff: Toro, Uni, Anago, Tamago. Close with some rolls, like Kappa, Negitoro, Natto.   Obviously this differs with each person. Some people like to lead with Tuna, others say go with Tamago as it's indicative of the quality of the restaurant."

Elegant sea urchin:Short spine, dark orange, robust flavor.　 Short spined sea urchin: Varietal of the Elegant found in Hokkaido; somewhat larger in size; said to be the best tasting of the lot.

If you like the flavor, but you just want it to be thicker then I would recommend adding the cornstarch.  Here's a tip though: make a ""slurry."" That basically just means add a little bit of water and cornstarch together and stir it up until the cornstarch dissolves.  That way, you won't have clumps of cornstarch randomly floating around your eel sauce. :)  Also, make sure you are continually stirring the eel sauce while slowly pouring the slurry in. Be careful, as the sauce will start to foam up quickly!   For more details on the steps I mentioned above, check out this article: http://www.secretsofsushi.com/eel-sauce.html"

sushi,3bc44h,monkeyvselephant,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:58:33 2015 UTC,"Ironically, it's generally true in regards to your Little Tokyo comment. I do understand that there are better places such as the awkwardly named ""Q sushi"" and Sushi Zo that offer a higher end experience and way better quality neta. For the price and the variety of neta offered however, I do feel that Sushi Gen offers that straight forward experience at a lower price, relatively of course. I do see where you're coming off in regards to it being overhyped, but then again, it's the crux of being an institution that's been there for so long like as there's always new restaurants coming out with better stuff. My personal feeling of Sushi Gen being overhyped lies in the fact that most people go there $15 Sashimi platter and don't bother to try the better stuff (i.e. sitting at the sushi bar). Obviously, there's going to be a higher premium but I do feel it's still relatively not that expensive (around $60-80) vs other places offering the same variety of neta but at much higher prices.  Edit: otherwise, yes I genuinely do appreciate the complement and the comment as the irony of Little Tokyo not having that many good sushi places in LA (out of all the places in the US since that's where sushi was first introduced in the US) needs to be addressed."
sushi,3bc44h,monkeyvselephant,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:40:06 2015 UTC,"I will preface my opinion that I only order the omakase anywhere I go, so I cannot comment on chirashi bowls or other specials.  I'm not saying you have to go to n/naka or urasawa on the regular, but just going to something like ike on hollywood, jinpachi on santa monica, kiriko or tsujita on sawtelle... and the differences are pretty noticeable.  Even Kiyokawa on robertson is less than $100 omakase.  if you wanted a little less pricey omakase, Nozomi in Torrance is something like 55-60per and they've consistently had great quality fish every time I've gone, which ends up being once a week usually."
sushi,3bc44h,monkeyvselephant,2,Sun Jun 28 21:28:23 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, great advice! Definitely Nozomi in Torrance (more easily accessible from where I'm at) is appealing. Have you eaten at n/naka? I saw the Chef's Table episode on N/Naka on Netflix and it looked pretty interesting."
sushi,3bc44h,TonyDiGerolamo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:42:23 2015 UTC,"haven't done N/Naka yet, it's on my to do list, but enough of my friends have gone and given it wild reviews.  I think it's like $185/per for the menu, which isn't insane given its notoriety, but you're going to see much more artistic and new representations of the dishes, than just a pure sushi menu.    If you go to Nozomi, try to sit towards the center and get Chef Yasu, definitely the most skilled of the 3 working there.  The other chefs are great too, but I still feel he's the best representation of the restaurant.  We'll typically mix it up going in the corner and going in the center.  Chef Toshi used to work here (his master was the main chef at Komasa in little tokyo).  He's moved on to some other restaurant in downtown I believe.  If you live down around the South Bay area (I'm in Redondo), then you might want to check out Maruhide Uni Club sometime.  Go in the morning and you can pick up some great santa barbara uni (this is where the top BH sushi restaurants source their uni from in Los Angeles).  The restaurant is decent too (get the jars sampler), but it's honestly an excuse to push product that they haven't sold to the restaurants earlier that day, so as to not have to throw it out."
sushi,3bc44h,onlyspeaksinhashtag,2,Sun Jun 28 23:57:42 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm guessing $15 just for that."
sushi,3bc44h,tojjt,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:22:03 2015 UTC,"Well more like half that price. Sushi Gen is actually more reasonably priced vs some of the other higher end establishments, even though the quality might not be as good as the $150+ places."
sushi,3bc44h,ukatama,2,Sun Jun 28 18:41:09 2015 UTC,I went to Sushi Gen and had an epic sushi meal... ordered a lot of nigiri. The snapper was my favorite thing I ordered... the kitchen eventually ran out we ordered so much.   I agree with another poster that sushi in Japan-town is it or miss but I like Sushi Gen a lot and had a great experience there.
sushi,3bd1f2,kabob23,3,Sun Jun 28 01:45:29 2015 UTC,"As for the freezing, that is common practice for two main reasons.  First, parasite destruction (see an old comment I made here). Second, it firms the fish making it easier to cut.  It usually gives no perceptual difference in flavor.    As for the paper towels, that does seem a little odd.  They were probably doing that to absorb excess moisture it would seem.  From a sanitary stance, paper towels wouldn't be too much of an issue.  Paper towels are about the cleanest thing in a kitchen, no joke.  They're extremely dry so nothing really grows on them.  I'd be a hell of a lot more concerned if they were using any sort of re-usable cloths/towels.  They only issue I would take, is that there is a chance for pieces of the towel to rip off and make it onto the final product, but they probably would catch that."
sushi,3bd1f2,Sagan4life,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:18:56 2015 UTC,I tend to cringe when I see sushi chef wipe their knife with that wet clean towel every time they make a cut.
sushi,3bd1f2,sean_incali,2,Sun Jun 28 04:39:41 2015 UTC,"You've got a good eye for detail and you've caught more than you might know about food prep and sanitation.  /u/Sagan4life made a good point about freezing the fish - that's a perfectly acceptable practice for getting rid of parasites.   Here are my two major concerns:    Fish should never be pre-sliced. Pre slicing fish may help the chefs move faster when the restaurant gets busy, but it also increases the surface area of the fish - thus making the decomposition rate accelerate. Well trained sushi chefs know that this is a bad practice and prefer to keep the fish in the largest pieces possible to preserve the quality until it is served.  Paper towels are clean and are acceptable for absorbing excess moisture from the fish. However, after the paper towel has done that it needs to be removed. Once the paper towel is wet, it can easily become a host for bacterial growth- especially when it absorbing liquid from raw meat. Paper towels should not be used when storing or freezing fish.   Good eye! I wouldn't go back to that sushi restaurant."

sushi,3b7aav,inferno229,7,Fri Jun 26 15:26:02 2015 UTC,"Bit long, but I promise it's worth it.  When I was younger, I remember loving shrimp tempura with tartar sauce. LOVED it. Any chance I had, I would bother my parents and drive them insane for some street corner food cart shrimp with sauce. I had no idea what it really was; I just knew it was tasty for my toddler taste buds.   Fast forward a little bit (maybe I was 5 years old?), we got a goldfish tank. A full 55 gallon tank, home to the tiniest little goldfishes ever. Something like 15-20 goldfish, about the size of a paper clip. Fast forward some weeks/months, and the fish grew HUGE. About the size of an adult hand. They kind of terrified me a bit. To add to the scariness, they had an odd habit of jumping out of the fish tank, landing on the floor, and flopping, gasping for air. I'd run to my dad crying. His response? ""Just put him back in."" 5 year old me would only cry. I'd run back to find the fish flopping hopelessly, losing his breath, and slowly dying, and I couldn't muster up the courage to scoop him up and put him back in. I cried louder. ""Oh, alright..."" Only then would my dad come by and rescue the fish.  The nail in the coffin was when my dad decided to make fish for dinner one day. I had no idea what the smell was. It was just strong and pungent. Sitting at the dinner table after the meal is served, I ask, ""what is this?"" He tried to teach five year old me, but it backfired completely, ""It's fish... just like the ones in the fish tank!"" I shuddered, and immediately said I didn't want any. ""Why not?"" ""I don't like it."" ""How can you not like it if you never tasted it?"" His logic would never penetrate my emotional block. ""I just don't want any."" After a bit of back and forthing, he told me ""you don't get up from that table until you finish eating your food."" Understandably mad as he was, I just couldn't eat it. I sat and cried for about an hour. I even attempted to take a bite, but I gagged and watered up even more. I was fully traumatized.  For the rest of my life, I couldn't eat fish, or seafood for that matter. When I would be offered shrimp, I'd be disgusted. I just couldn't. It became a psychological trauma and block, that any time there was seafood, I would just up and leave. People my entire life would give me the usual ""how can you not like it if you've never tasted it?"" and I'd just say ""ehh. I don't like it. I don't want any."" Such a strong psychological block, that even after years and years of wondering why I didn't just suck it up and eat it, I had my mom go through the trouble of cooking me some simple tilapia, just to take a bite, gag, and not eat anymore. Seafood was my weakness.  That's when one day, I thought long and hard about this mental block, and how it was just that: purely mental. I was psyching myself out. I had to do it. But it couldn't be just any fish. It had to be a fish I knew I caught myself. A fish I knew I prepared myself, and a fish I knew I cooked myself. I had to take mental, as well as physical control of the fish in order to conquer it. Now all I had to do was go fishing.   Several years passed, and still no luck. The only time I went fishing was with my dad and grandfather, and, eager to throw the line in the water, I did just that, without learning any technique or anything. The lure landed in the water, but the reel kept spinning, to the point where it made a tangled mess of a nest. ""Ehh, it's alright,"" my dad and grandfather would say, but I could hear the disappointment in their tone, as they tried to untangle it for well over an hour. The mood was gone, and we just went back home. I didn't cry this time, but I sure had my tail between my legs all the way home.  Several more years passed by, and by now, fishing was near impossible. I had no one to teach me, I was living out of state with my girlfriend, and my dad was in his home country for good. ""Let's get a bite to eat,"" says my girlfriend, taking me to the Japanese restaurant she serves at. While it is primarily a sushi restaurant, I decided to go for a chicken teriyaki dish, more on the safe side (fish was out of the question for my emotional brain). Halfway through the meal, the manager passes by and asks my girlfriend, ""Hey, I know it's your day off, but can you work tomorrow? So-and-so just quit and we're short. No one can cover."" After my girlfriend confirms, the manager turns to me. ""What about you? Are you free tomorrow? Can you work?"" I was working at another restaurant at the time, but I didn't think I'd be working at both at the same time, let alone with my girlfriend. Not to mention how we had come in for lunch, not a job. I never expected to work at a sushi restaurant of all places, what with my psychological hate of all things seafood.  The following months were standard stuff. It was just an ordinary job at a sushi restaurant. The only downfall was the dreaded question from customers, 'what do you recommend?' Using my serving/waitstaff skills to manage these types of situations, I'd resolve my way out of the question using only what intellectual knowledge I had of the fish, and worked things out beautifully- so much so, that the owner and sushi chef took a kind of liking to me; and he doesn't openly like many people. I looked more and more into fish, trying to find out what I could about them. Meanwhile, I also did handyman jobs for the chef/boss- fixing a drain pipe, installing a faucet, fixing a toilet water tank, installing a ceiling fan, drilling a walk-in freezer curtain, etc. He really began to like me. And one day, he asks a huge favor.  ""The distributor didn't come this week. Can you drive to Boston tomorrow and pick up 20lb of tuna?"" Not knowing what I was getting into, I agreed. ""But, you have to get there early. They run out fast, so you have to make sure you get there first."" ""Well, what time do they open?"" ""I think 5am?"" Dear god. 2 hours away, and I had to be there early. I knew I wasn't going to sleep tonight. I would stay awake all night, and leave at 3am, just to get there before anybody else. Still, I'd do anything to make him happy. I left at 3, drove on the highway listening to loud music, absolutely no idea where the place was, or how to buy the tuna. All I knew was that I had a goal.  5am, I park my car and hope for the best. Trucks are coming in and out of the pier, and I have no idea if I'm even in the right place. I walk in, and a scruffy looking guy in rubber boots tells me the place doesn't open until 6:30. Well, shit. I drove in the middle of the night, didn't sleep a wink from the night before when I served tables, and now I had to wait for them to open. I couldn't call my boss right now- he'd kill me if I woke him up at 5 am. I had no idea where I was, and everyone else I knew was asleep 2 hours away. All there was left to do was lay down on top of my car, look up at the cloudy gray sky, listen to the morning seagulls, and hope a couple of cigarettes would keep me awake.   However, there was something a bit more tantalizing... the smell of the sea. That salty smell from a pier that you can only smell at the beach or out at sea... Something about it was so... good, so... delicious, so... I don't know. After all, I hate seafood...  6:30, and they let me in the freezer warehouse. I was the first to ask for tuna, and they brought out an entire bluefin without its head or tail. The fish was massive. I didn't expect them to be that big. The workers start cutting away, and pull out a huge harpoon tip. Whoa. Seemed primitive, but very rugged. Someone out at sea battled with this fish and caught it. One guy off to the side saw me staring at it, so I asked, ""what do you do with those afterwards?"" ""We give them back to the fishermen."" But he saw my childlike stare. He wrapped it up in tissue and gave it to me, chunks of tuna still stuck on it and all. The other fishermen workers continued, cutting out what I needed. Amazing, deep red, and meaty, it looked just like cow meat. EXACTLY like cow meat. It looked so delicious. Sure, it was a fish, and sure it swam, but its insides were just like a steak. And I love steak. Why don't I like tuna?  I drove away with the bounty- 20lb of bluefin in an ice cooler. 8am by now, and I didn't take into consideration morning rush. I wasn't worried about the tuna, but I was sleep deprived, and I had about $300 worth of bluefin tuna I had to get back. It was the mission, the objective. I went out of my damn way to stay up all night, drive 2 hours away in pitch black darkness to a place I didn't know, get lost, and wait another several hours to get this fish. I have to get it back to the restaurant now. I took a random exit from the congested highway, and took all local roads. No idea where they went, but my gps led the way.  My boss got the fish, thanked me with a bit of cash, and had me go home. ""You work tonight. Go home and sleep."" Mission completed. All was done and finished. But something still irked me. I got home and felt like I was missing something. I felt like I just battled this fish and caught it myself, but let it go. I had the harpoon tip in my pocket, and the smell of the sea in my nose, but I let it all go. Why?  The end of the night, and we're closing. My brain needed something to feel complete. It needed to taste that tuna. I asked for a piece. The boss says ""but you don't like fish."" ""I know, but... I don't know..."" He gives me a bit of the bluefin, and all those feelings came back- the smell of the sea, the strife of catching the fish, etc. I tried the bluefin, tasted it, chewed it, and I didn't gag.    Today, I work behind the sushi bar, alongside the chef. I've tasted all  sorts of fish and give only the best recommendations I can from my personal taste, catering to people's own particular preferences. While I may not be Jiro, and while I may still have a lot to learn, I've come a long way. Sushi got rid of my lifelong psychological trauma and landed me a chef's coat.

sushi,3b7aav,Dubhan,5,Sat Jun 27 10:53:12 2015 UTC,"This was 25+ years ago. Was on a family vacation in Washington DC. We went in a restaurant that served it. I had heard about it (not in popular culture like it is now) and decided to try it. I had no idea what was what so I just ordered a variety dish. It seemed very daring to try but I liked it.  I had no idea what wasabi was and decided to eat it in one bite. I still remember the blood rushing to my head because of that. The pickled ginger seemed like such an alien taste too, but I liked it. Didn't have any for quite a while after that due to living in a rural where raw fish was considered ""bait"". But I enjoy it a lot now that you can get it all over."
sushi,3b7aav,bobbym529,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"Bait - that certainly stuck out in your comments for me due to many times whenever I would eat Ikura (salmon roe), some people would get a confused look as they told me they use it for bait, lol. That would flabbergast me as I wouldn't really imagine Ikura as such since I ate it since I was little."

I had no clue what it meant, I was expecting, well, a roll, like a big fat yeast roll.  So we open our boxes and there it is, 4 pieces for each of us, rice wrapped around some stuff, I took one bite, spat it out and ate the rest of my meal.  My wife didn't even try hers.  It was probably at least 10 years before I tried sushi again."

sushi,3b7aav,beachsunflower,3,Mon Jul 6 17:56:18 2015 UTC,"It was really only last year when I first tried it.   My first experience was salmon sashimi with my gf. She gave me a piece and I was turned off because it was soft and cold...  but also meat. Meat to me at the time was supposed to be hot, fried, etc. for it to be enjoyable.   Next experience was at an ayce with a  friend after getting a little high. We went for a standard feast and it was my idea to try salmon nigiri. I put it in my mouth and had an epiphany. The texture seemed different, the taste was interesting and enjoyable. Next thing I knew I had 12 more lined up.   Fast forward a year, sushi has consumed me. I am truly in love with it, dream about it, think about it all the time. I've been having fun making it myself, and find its cheaper to make at home. It's been a relatively short time from hating it to having it nearly every week and as much as possible in between."

Normally I'd go into the local ""supermarket"" that we had in our dorm and get a sandwich, except they were all out.  All they had was nigiri sushi and california rolls.  I bought one of each.  I never did finish the california roll because I though it was gross.  Been eating ever since.  My local place gave me a members only card so I can bypass long waits and they have my ""preferred items"" already entered in the computer."
sushi,3b7aav,keitecat,3,Fri Jun 26 20:04:37 2015 UTC,"I believe I was 7 years old and my dad took me to a sushi bar and we tried a bunch of things.  At the time (the mid 90s), sushi seemed more niche and my dad had just started trying it and enjoying it recently.  I wasn't crazy about it, but I didn't outright dislike it either.  I don't recall having sushi after that for years.  I tried some sashimi and later some sushi (rolls and nigiri) and I enjoyed both, but again, I wasn't crazy about it.  I think I started eating more sushi after meeting the woman who I would eventually marry.  She enjoyed sushi a lot, so I'd go have sushi with her.  But it was mainly just rolls and occasionally nigiri.  Gradually, together we started to develop a more complex taste for the more subtle flavors.  As trite is it may sound, watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi may have played a part in that, as did buying a book on sushi and learning how to make it ourselves.  Having omakase at a local restaurant helped also (although this is tricky because we have a few dietary restrictions when it comes to seafood)."
sushi,3b7aav,coloradofishtapes,3,Fri Jun 26 20:39:19 2015 UTC,"My first try at sushi was not sushi at all but gimbap brought into my kindergarten class by the Korean mother of one of my classmates. This was in Hawaii in '83. I was proud of myself for trying it and for years told everyone I first had sushi when I was five.  -- Cut forward to ninth grade when a group of friends and I went to the Union Station food court in DC for lunch. I wanted to be the cool, cultured girl and show off to my friends how unique I was to eat raw fish like it was no big deal. I played it off like it was something I did all the time and ordered a combo of nigiri and teka maki. I've been obsessed with it ever since."

My dads buddy used to bring this strange looking green crap he called ""wasabi"", and soy sauce packets. We caught a smaller dude one day, and my dads buddy took a knife out and cut into it on the deck, then passed some out after mixing up some of his magic green stuff, with the brown stuff I only put on rice. It was really taboo back then, but I did try it, and I hated it.  Fast forward to high school, when my Chinese buddy kept bugging me to try it. I finally did, and it has been an addiction ever since :)  I am still kinda pissed that I had the freshest version of sushi ever, but didn't have a taste for it.

However, the part where he somehow caught fish and ate them raw in the boat? That gave me the most amazing cravings for raw fish.   Our class trip that year was to the Inner Harbor in Baltimore. While there, I sought out a place that served sushi and got some tuna nigiri because the tuna looked like what he'd described in the book. It was absolutely amazing, exactly how I had imagined it would taste and feel. And I was hooked."

About a year ago I started to enjoy seafood more and actually liked eating it.  My best friend is a big fan of sushi, so I asked him if we could go one day and have him show me the ropes. He basically ordered my first sushi order for me. I was a bit skeptical and worried at first since he ordered only nigiri for me. I took my first shy bite into raw fish and fell in love.

Squid, eel, some fish, no rolls at all. It was a hibachi/sushi place and in hindsight, I made terrible choices. I didn't hate it but didn't like it and my date was downright grossed out.

One of the friends handed me something and said ""Eat this, and don't ask me what it is until afterward."" I did. It was wonderful. I said ""What was that?"" She said ""Eel."" That so broke the connection between my feelings about the word and my memory of how good it was that I instantly became more open-minded about sushi, and over the next two years or so it grew on me until it was my favorite food."

I grew up in South Dakota, so you can imagine how 'exotic' a sushi place was when it opened up. It was run by an engineer from Japan turned sushi chef to make more money in the US and support his family (odd transition, I know). My family decided to go one night before the symphony because we were all dressed up anyways (and this was a nice place). I had Tempura Don... it seemed safe... and my mother pushed me to order a piece of sushi. I decided to get the ""grossest"" thing on there (to my 5th grade mind), and ordered a piece of Octopus. And they did SUCH a nice job on it... it was tender and perfect. From then on, I ordered more and more sushi, and less of the cooked stuff. Now? My cat's name is Sushi, my dog was named Miso, and I've got Soup and Salad (Sally) the turtles. Next pet? Wasabi the cat. I've got an obsession that started YEARS ago... became my favorite food... and infiltrated all different corners of my life! To this day, that (yes South Dakotan) Sushi place is still open (though struggling because they can't find cooks at lunch time and the rush is just too much because they are so tasty!) and it is still my favorite! :)"

The sushi at the place is still the same today ands its been around 10+ years. It's basically rice, and crab along with maybe two vegetables(?), it's been so long and I never tried it again. It was more to show off to my best friend that I liked sushi. (I was all about anime and so was he) so I needed to come off as really cool. I remember gagging slightly but I held down two pieces and that was that. The next time I ever had it was maybe a year or so later. Another friend took me to Whole Foods and wanted me to prove I liked it. (She ate sushi all the time, living in a slightly more hoity-toity city with her mom who also enjoyed it.) I gagged slightly expecting it to be as horrible as what I'd tried before but it wasn't. It was amazing! After that I was hooked!

sushi,3b12ot,RileyTall,-1,Thu Jun 25 04:59:56 2015 UTC,"Technically not an endangered species. From wikipedia:   In 2011, the USA's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) decided not to list the Atlantic bluefin tuna as an endangered species. NOAA officials said that the more stringent international fishing rules created in November 2010 would be enough for the Atlantic bluefin tuna to recover. NOAA agreed to reconsider the species endangered status in 2013.[28] It was made a National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern, one of those species about which the U.S. Government has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA).[29]"
sushi,3b12ot,iamhappylight,3,Thu Jun 25 14:58:13 2015 UTC,"This is true if the bluefin is truly Atlantic bluefin, but this is most likely not the case. A vast majority of bluefin tuna is harvested from the Pacific where it is constantly over fished while still in an endangered state.   Not to mention that if there endangered state has been lifted, then this does not necessarily mean that they can recover up to there original healthy population size. The government sets forth fishing regulations that simply maintains current levels instead of recovering them to their fullest, which is not what is needed for the ecosystem as a whole.  I recommend watching the documentary ""End of the Line"". It will really have an impact on your outlook to seafood. I was an avid consumer of fish, and some rare species to boot, until I watched this."
sushi,3b12ot,RileyTall,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:17:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I wasn't disputing that they are overfished and that it is a problem. I was mostly referring to this: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/28/science/earth/28tuna.html  I was curious about what you said about Pacific vs Atlantic bluefin so I looked into it some more. The International Commission for the Conservation actually classifies Pacific Bluefin as vulnerable but Atlantic Bluefin as endangered. So it would seem that the Atlantic Bluefin is more in danger of being extinct than the Pacific."

sushi,3avtm8,Holic_Shot,9,Wed Jun 24 15:20:54 2015 UTC,"They have two sushi chefs in my local grocery store with a display like this. I was not sure I wanted to try grocery store sushi, but did anyway and I was surprised at the great quality of it. My wife and I eat it regularly now. You can just pick something up from the display or simply ask the chefs to make you something right there. Just like being in a restaurant imho."
sushi,3avtm8,rancid_squirts,6,Wed Jun 24 01:39:13 2015 UTC,Yeah at Wegmans they will make a fresh roll for you if you ask.
sushi,3avtm8,Fat_Head_Carl,10,Wed Jun 24 02:03:04 2015 UTC,Not a fan of their sushi. Tastes not fresh.
sushi,3avtm8,LethargicMonkey,8,Tue Jun 23 23:35:08 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's nice to have when you're desperate. And, living in Western New York, access to quality sushi at reasonable prices is kind of limited.   But it's definitely not that good.  As far as grocery supermarkets go, though, Wegman's is great."

sushi,3avtm8,ceejayoz,12,Wed Jun 24 03:44:37 2015 UTC,"You're a snob! I've worked at a decent sushi restaurant and at a grocery store sushi stand, the fish was pretty much the same. In fact I would say quality was more consistent through our supplier at the grocery store, though neither was ever bad. Now if you're going in at 8:30 PM to buy packaged sushi at a grocery store, you're gonna have a bad time. They start early, lunch is the best time for grocery store sushi, but the store I worked at we staffed the bar until 7 pm, and you could order anything made fresh until then."
sushi,3avtm8,Fat_Head_Carl,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:36:41 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to accept that moniker.  I will eat something else before I pick up prepackaged sushi.  The obvious difference is between prepackaged sushi, and having a chef there preparing fish.    In my experience with supermarket sushi, I've never witnessed it being freshly made... It's sitting in a bin, with an expiration date labeled on it.  EDIT: Not everyone lives near a Wegmans...    Believe me, if the supermarket I had cut fish in house, I'd love it...but alas...we don't.  Acme, Shop Rite, and Pathmark are the choices that are closer than my local sushi restaurant."
sushi,3avtm8,LethargicMonkey,3,Wed Jun 24 11:12:21 2015 UTC,"Have you not been to wegmans? They have sushi chefs right behind the sushi counter making sushi most of the time. The stuff you see out might not have been made within the last 5 minutes, but its definitely made on the spot by the chefs that day.  Of course, thats my personal wegmans, dont know if they are all the same.  I will say though that it doesnt compare to the quality you can get at a nice sushi restaurant, but for what it is, its really not bad at all. And its not just about being desperate."

It's sitting in a bin, with an expiration date labeled on it.   Yeah, you should go to Wegmans. They have guest sushi chefs fly in to the Pittsford NY location from Japan, they cut whole tuna in-store for an audience (and have genuine toro as a result at times), and if they don't have something prepped you just ask someone and they make it in front of you. Turnover's fast too."
sushi,3avtm8,TheDragisal,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:57:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you should go to Wegmans.   I agree, but the closest one is a minimum ride of 40 minutes without traffic."

Most of the regulars ordered directly from me instead of grabbing a package. Rice recipe was pretty much identical to the restaurant I worked at after. Fish was good, I ate it everyday. Nothing was kept for the next day, it was all fresh."

I am definitely not an expert in traditional preparation, but every time I have had it it has consisted of assorted diced sashimi over a bed of sushi rice. This homemade version I created consisted of diced salmon, tuna, amberjack yellowtail, chu toro, tomago and tobiko all over sushi rice.   This also happened to be the first time I have ever attempted anything like this. I came across all of the ingredients at a specialty Asian market and tried to put it together the best I could. I was pretty happy with the results which in turn lead to my first ever Reddit post. Thanks for the positive feedback! I hope that answers your questions."

sushi,3an643,speakinbeacons,5,Sun Jun 21 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"From the chef's side, all I really ask is if I give you any instructions you follow them, like don't eat this with soy, it's often cause the sauce I'm using isn't soy based and you'll ruin the flavor.   Other than that the only thing that bugs me is when people wait like 20 minutes to eat the pieces.  Omakase is served in small portions to get you 1:focus on each piece individually, and 2:Eat it fairly quickly, as sushi is best when the rice is still a bit warm and the fish is still cold.  Otherwise don't stress about what you should or should not do, enjoy the meal, you're the customer, you're paying for this so it's just best to enjoy it and not over think it."
sushi,3an643,spastichabits,2,Mon Jun 22 08:58:09 2015 UTC,"What's in most of the sauces you put on things, do the majority have soy sauce in them?  I ask because I've wanted to try this, but having celiac disease, anything with wheat or gluten makes me puke, usually pretty soon after I've eaten it.:)  Soy sauce and asian market crab stick both tend to have a lot of wheat in them.  Wondering if it might be possible to approach a chef about it or how to approach a chef about it without offending them."
sushi,3an643,mattcushing,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:52:05 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately most of the sauces I do are soy based, though I do have a few other sauces, that use Yuzu or Lime as the base instead.  We try to be very accommodating to people with gluten sensitivity, and always have Tamari on hand.   I know Celiac's is much more severe than a simple intolerance, but I'm sure if went to the right kind of place they'd also be very helpful. The only problem I can imagine is certain items might contain only a trace of gluten, and a chef could miss that.  Though as far as eating out in general I think Sushi is safer than most places."
sushi,3an643,spastichabits,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:32:23 2015 UTC,"it definitely is easier, and I've been to a few places that are now using La Choy soy which is gluten free for what they put in the bottles as well as what they use in sauces.  I'll give it a shot, but I think the fear of getting it is what is making me work harder at makng it myself:)"
sushi,3an643,mattcushing,3,Wed Jun 24 18:42:16 2015 UTC,"Eat it as you get it.  No need for soy sauce and wasabi.  They may or may not give it to you as part of your place setting, but if they don't then don't act like they forgot it - they didn't.  If they do give it to you then that's fine, just don't go nuts with it.  The chef will put wasabi on the things that need a little wasabi.  If they give you your own portion, save it to mask a piece you might not like the flavor of.  This is the traditional use for it and the polite way to not skip a piece.  I'm a chef (not at some super nifty high-end place that offers omakase on a daily basis, I just do it when requested) and sometimes I like to give little side items to go with the fish, one of which is wasabi that I'll give with Tako.  It's my little way of suggesting that yes, it's good stuff, but not everything must get it.  Anyway, that's my little wasabi rant.  Other than that, just behave yourself.  Don't play with your chopsticks and don't yell things in foreign languages before drinking your sake."
sushi,3an643,happygrizzly,2,Mon Jun 22 04:55:24 2015 UTC,I think /u/spastichabits has hit the nail on this one. I think the best way is to be open and listen to the chef. Sometimes they recommend different things but I think there's a certain way they would like their food eaten.

sushi,3aje0a,LifeizAmazing,2,Sun Jun 21 01:19:44 2015 UTC,The only solution is political pressure. SAVE the WHALES! SAVE the TUNA!! Sustainable fishing and end the poorly regulated international quotas. International regulations regarding fishing are worse than the FIFA scandal. It is a disgraceful situation. I think the Japanese view fish extinction equal to Texans' oil industry to global warming.
sushi,3aje0a,repo_my_life,2,Sun Jun 21 02:14:14 2015 UTC,"I actually did a research paper on this and that is pretty spot on with my findings. the japanese lobbied with other nations that profited from fishing tuna to vote against them being on the endangered list. they have been accused of (and probably did, lets be honest) illegally fishing yellowfin tuna in Australian waters, and more things I cant remember off the top of my head.   aquiculture is a viable solution, but there are major issues with breeding and death rate of tuna, as well as wild populations. they are migratory and very particular about their breeding grounds, so all farming has been done with harvested eggs, which is harmful to the wild populations. most of the eggs never become adults, and fail at a higher rate than that of the wild tuna. basically its like 98% of farmed eggs would fail to become full adults capable of breeding, whereas wild eggs left alone would fail only 90-95%. its actually a very significant difference because of the amount of eggs being produced by adults at one time. I pulled those numbers straight out of my ass but its just to convey a concept, they are close enough lol."

Once again, thank you so much to /u/mattcushing, /u/bailolz_z, /u/blinddivine, /u/sean_incali, and /u/Rushdoony4ever for helping me out on the last thread. Their advice was invaluable in making this sushi a reality. Next time, let's hope I can get the rice right."
sushi,3agn0i,mattcushing,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:19:02 2015 UTC,"Hey, glad I could help.  Take what you can from the experience and apply it to the next time you do it.  I agree that it might be a bit too much rice, but that's personal preference.  I actually like a lot of rice, my wife and daughter get upset because it's hard for them to eat (they're tiny, I'm 6'2) :)  I ran into a snag with rice cooking so i'll pass along the things I learned.  1) If you're using a rice cooker, and it comes with a measuring cup, use that and the line inside for the water.  If not, or you lose it, go with 1 cup rice to 1 cup water.  2) Rinse the rice thoroughly beforehand, till the water is mostly clear.  Gets rid of the excess starch I think.  3) LET THE RICE SOAK!!!!!  leaving this out and the wrong ratio is what led to most of my problems.  I usually let it sit 15 min before and 8-10 min after the button pops.  4) the ratio of su (the vinegar mix) should be about 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar, 1 tbsp of sugar, 1 tsp of salt for every 2 cups of rice.  I increased it and it tasted bad.  Post anything else that you have questions about, and KEEP DOING IT! :)  Also, watch secrets of sushi site, NoVE Kitchen and Bar, and How to Make Sushi videos on Youtube.  I also like Tom Lin's videos too.  Lots of really great tricks and tips that you wouldn't think of on your own.  HAPPY SUSHI!"

Miyabi is japanese run i believe and near the other two i told you about. These 3 are by no means cheaper than those expensive places in DT core...  you could get high quality, fair prices from either Japanese ""fish markets"" at J-Town on steeles or Taro's Fish on Sheppard.

You'll have more questions after you finish, so ask away.

sushi,3a3hbp,bailolz_z,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:30:10 2015 UTC,I made sushi for the first time a little while ago and you'd be surprised how important a VERY sharp knife is.
sushi,3a3hbp,befamous7,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:22:05 2015 UTC,When handling the sushi rice make sure your hands are wet-ish so the rice doesn't stick. When cutting the rolls it helps to wet the blade and be forceful when cutting. If you're too easy on the knife you'll mash the roll. Toast the nori if at all possible. This is huge because it will make sure you avoid chewy nori which is very off putting. A little rice goes a long way.
sushi,3a3hbp,blinddivine,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:59:03 2015 UTC,"Rice vinegar, and rinsing the sushi rice.  Sushi rice should be rinsed /soaked in cold water until clear before it is cooked.   Once it's done you need to add some rice vinegar and fold it in.  i suggest some eel sauce, or kikoman sweet-soy sauce usually found in 'ethnic' food sections of grocery stores and very similar to eel sauce."
sushi,3a3hbp,sean_incali,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:09:41 2015 UTC,"Rice has to be rinsed thoroughly. Remove as much starch on the surface as possible.  Cook the rice with 1:1 rice:water ratio. If the cooked rice is too wet, you won't be able to work with it.   Sushi vinegar is usually 5:2:1 vinegar:sugar:salt. Sometimes I find it too salty, so I do 5:2:1/4   Mix the sushi su using slicing and folding motion.   You can use the whole sheet of nori if making a futomaki roll with a lot of fillings. Half sheet of nori cut lengthwise if making hosomaki or american style inside out rolls.   Always roll along the shorter length regardless which rolls you make.   Here's a video on futomaki  Note how she puts her ingredients in the middle of the rice spread out on the nori sheet. That free rice layer if going to fold over the fillings and meet up with the free rice on the other side.   Here's a video on hosomaki  Note how this girl also puts the filling in the middle.   Note also on both video there is a bit of nori on the other side that has no rice on top. About inch to half an inch.   That free nori will prevent giving your rolls swirly effects."

This guy is going full American on his stuff. Which is art in its own way, even if it's not yet as respected as the traditional art of Jiro and others.  I'd rather get sushi from this guy. I feel like the subtleties of Jiro would be squandered on me; I love ""purist"" simple rolls and sashimi but not to the point that I could really tell between Jiro and a tradtionally trained local sushi chef"

sushi,39xm7a,PurpleWitch3,3,Mon Jun 15 17:04:01 2015 UTC,Sounds like you need a Masamoto KS Yanagiba. Maybe a Deba too if you need to break down the fish.  Find it here: http://japanesechefsknife.com/KSSeriesHonKasumiGyokuhakukou.html#KSSeries

sushi,39xm7a,mattcushing,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:02:22 2015 UTC,I got a wicked sharp yanigaba from Kohls for 40$ :)
sushi,39xm7a,chunkwizard,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:35:47 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a high quality yanagiba in a lower price point, consider tanaka (http://www.ebay.com/itm/Japanese-Tanaka-silver-st-3-full-forged-Yanagiba-knife-/200589604826) or sakai takayuki (http://www.ebay.com/itm/Japanese-Sakai-Takayuki-Inox-Yanagiba-Knife-270mm-Hikari-With-Saya-/231426645293)  but you probably want a deba to break down fish"
sushi,39xm7a,YepYepImaRep,2,Thu Jun 18 07:31:50 2015 UTC,"Depends on your price range.  I'd suggest a deba for breaking down the fish, and a yanagiba/takobiki for slicing the fileted fish.    I'm assuming you'll have access to the restaurant stones for sharpening, otherwise you'll need to save up to buy stones as well.  At a minimum I'd buy a Norton 4000/8000 combo stone, but once you use it you'll learn that Norton stones suck and combo stones suck more--Naniwa, Chosera, Nubatama, and Shapton are all good.  There are other good choices too.  Most people will get a 180mm deba.  Larger would be appropriate for very large fish, and smaller, which is kinda hard to use, would be appropriate for small delicate fish like smelt or perch.    For the yanagi, I would suggest getting at least 240mm, although 270mm is more popular.  You can go 300mm if you have the money and feel like you have something to prove.  Longer has its advantages in terms of causing a cleaner cut and lasting a bit longer, but they are tougher to use and unwieldy for some people.  In terms of materials, you'll probably be looking either at white steel or blue steel.  White steel can be made sharper, and can hold its edge really well if its very expensive high end white steel made by someone who cares.  Blue steel tends to hold its edge better, especially at the lower price ranges.  It's easier for a knife maker to make a very nice knife with blue steel than it is with white steel, but at the very high end, with honyaki knives, people will return to using white steel, because the honyaki allows them to hold a very hard edge, and the white steel allows the edge to be keener than basically anything else on the market.  You might find some stainless knives on the market, and if you're serious about what you're doing, I'd limit what stainless materials I'd use.  You're looking for something that can get razor sharp--not just the way everyone thinks, but actually razor sharp, and that sharpens easily, because you need to sharpen single-bevel knives frequently.  AEB-L/19c-27/Ginsanko/Silver-3 (same steel basically) is an excellent choice, as is R2-SG-2.  VG-10 is passable, but that would mean you're probably looking at a Shun, and for the price you can do better."

I definitely don't like his handles.  If he was making knives in any other city, and didn't have the hipster market to cater to, he wouldn't be successful.  I honestly think Nguyen knives, a guy who pops up on here from time to time, is doing a better job, although he's not as prolific or as well marketed.  Joel's knives are absolutely improving, and they're WAY better than they were a few years ago, but I'm hesitant.  I'm always ready to revisit them, but he was more of a beginner journeyman being treated like an expert when he first got his success, and that sticks in my craw.  You'd be better off getting a Michael Rader, Butch Horner, Michael Richmond, Shaun Fernandez, Devin Thomas, Murray Carter, etc.  But also, of all these people, only Carter actually makes yanagiba, and even then, I wouldn't recommend his.  He's more of a san-mai/warikomi guy, and when he's selling ni-mai/awase kata-ha knives like debas and yanagis he actually defers to the knives he sells from Shiraki-San from Japan. Not that he doesn't make yanagis and debas, he just doesn't make them often in the traditional 2-piece laminate style.  He could, it'd just be a custom."

The quality on those can be pretty hit and miss, though.  It may be worth talking to someone at one of the sushi restaurants to see where they get their shipments from (Fuji in Idaho Falls has had consistently fresh tasting fish).  Your other option would be to go to Salt Lake.  I know some of the Asian markets have frozen ""sushi grade"" fish in their frozen sections.

The live well or hatch in which the fish are thrown in usually have below freezing water in them.

I make it out to Salt Lake City about once a month and I always try to stop at Chinatown. It's on State Street, south of I-80.

sushi,39saem,ukatama,5,Sun Jun 14 07:49:26 2015 UTC,"Both of your pictures are of Unagi, or fresh water eel.  So the name is correct.   In Japan, unagi is rarely served at a sushi restaurant.  The eel of choice is overwhelmingly Anago.  The Anago is boiled to a tender perfection and will look like this.  It's a much more subtle flavor than unagi which is finished grilled.  For whatever reason, American (or non-Japanese) sushi restaurants choose to serve Unagi in place of Anago.  I have no idea why.  The second picture you post is the traditional method of serving unagi in Japan.  The fish is filleted, steamed (in the East), then grilled over preferably a charcoal flame and eaten over rice. It's a specialty dish and places serving the best dishes will be specialty restaurants.  What you should be looking for is ""Una-don (Unagi donburi)"", ""Una-juu (Unagi in a Juubako, your second picture)"" or ""Unagi no Kabayaki (which is the preparation method for the second picture)""."
sushi,39saem,h2g2Ben,4,Mon Jun 15 05:35:44 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of possible explanations. Unagi usually comes to the restaurant cooked and frozen. Different companies have different ways of preparing the unagi, so it may just be that you've never had the same brand.  Freshwater eel stocks have also been declining over the past few years, and with it the quality of the unagi I've seen has also gone down, generally."

There's also a Sushi Train in the sample complex - it's cheap and has gained popularity, and hence volume, since it opened.  Ninki (which also has hibachi) in Bellvue is a great place, too. Their nigiri are great - not too tightly packed, which is a testament to the chefs there.  Virago in the Gulch (kinda just outside it) is a trendy, but expensive, place. Never got nigiri there, but their rolls are interesting.  Ken's, which recently moved from the Midtown/Vandy area over to east nashville, has very decent sushi that I liked for their lunch specials.  Samurai on Elliston is also pretty great and a long-time mainstay before the gentrification hit the area. I'd stay away from Noma, also on Elliston. It is an unfortunate byproduct of the gentrification of Elliston.  To be honest, there isn't an overwhelming variety of seafood in landlocked Nashville.

Slice the avocado really thin, and lay it out on top so each piece overlaps the one before it.  Then drop some cling film on top, shape it with your bamboo rolling mat, and cut.  Once your done, peel away the film and voila, perfectly cut and the avocado is molded to each piece!"
sushi,39izpp,mattcushing,0,Fri Jun 12 13:29:18 2015 UTC,That's a good idea! I sliced it thin and placed it after the fact. But I used cling wrap around my bamboo mat anyways so I don't make the mat entirely messy. I saw my sushi guy doing that one time and thought it was brilliant.

sushi,39jdes,sean_incali,2,Fri Jun 12 06:31:32 2015 UTC,"Kosher has a lot of nuances to it. There's the right utensils, kosher brands etc.  For example, the nori would have to be 100% bug free not use specific dyes or anything like that. Rice might be kosher in and of itself but if it's made on the same area as specifically un-kosher stuff that can affect it as well.  Basically looking for any known kosher brands of basic sushi ingredients?"
sushi,39jdes,sean_incali,3,Fri Jun 12 06:41:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any.   But nori will be bug free and dye free as well, as it's just seaweed.   Rice is grown on fields all over the world with flood irrigation, and then it's milled and polished using machines. Not sure if that affects it."

sushi,39cmxj,mattcushing,9,Wed Jun 10 21:32:48 2015 UTC,"All of this is true. It is safe to assume that all crab stick contains gluten. Small roe like masago and tobiko (flying fish & smelt, respectively) are often packed in preservatives that contain gluten. Shichimi togarashi, the spicy Japanese seasoning powder, contains trace amounts of gluten but GF versions are available. Most unagi and anago in America come pre-packed in glutinous eel sauce which cannot be completely washed off. Same thing with those little red octopuses you sometimes see as tako yakitori.  Nigiri (non-marinated) and sashimi are gluten-free. Sriracha is gluten-free. So are soy paper and nori. When I have guests with celiac, I always suggest a nigiri combo plate with a tuna roll on the side.  Be cautious when substituting real crab for crab stick at your favorite sushi restaurant; if its not a high-quality restaurant, their ""real crab"" is often just crab stick that isn't shredded, and many servers won't be aware that it contains gluten.

Leave about an inch on top to seal it. Lay your filling in the middle. Roll it up. Cut it into rolls.    That's probably the most basic way.  There's a ton of videos on yourtube and just the internet in general that will show you.  Personally I use clingwrap to make it without the nori because I just like it that way.  When I first started I made a lot of mistakes, so it does take some practice.  Also, California rolls are just crab, avocado, and sometimes cucumber.

First off, you're gonna use too much rice, everyone does, it's still gonna taste good.  Second, if you don't have a rice cooker, seriously, get one, it makes a world of difference to your rice and the rice is the foundation for your sushi.  I bought mine at Wal-Mart for like $36 and it is worth every cent.  Third, you will be addicted to making your own sushi, just prepare :D    I picked up a nice piece of bbq'd eel from the local Asian market last weekend, warmed it up with some sauce I made (hoisin + peppered crab + sake) and made some badass eel rolls, even my wife who mostly likes the crab stick type rolls loved it.  For less than $30 we both gorged on sushi, she had some for lunch the next day, and the dog got a plate of leftover crab stick roll pieces and ate her fill of it too."

sushi,39289t,LouieKablooie,6,Tue Jun 9 15:24:13 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  The name ""gizzard shad"" is inaccurate.  Really, for fish, we shouldn't use common names.  My ichthyologist friend straight up refuses to use common names for fish because they're so inaccurate.  Gizzard Shad, or kohada, in Japan would be Konosirus punctatus, not the Dorosoma cepedianum you'd find in America.  However, even then, the term kohada just refers to small silver-skinned pickled fish in sashimi or sushi, and is one of the older types of sushi.  The actual fish I think in Japan is called colloquially konoshiro (konoshiro, konorirus, get it?), but that species itself is called shinko when it's small, kohada when it's medium sized, and konoshiro when full grown.  This time of year it's the season for the little guys, shinko-season.  They're not especially popular amongst the younger generations, but amongst the cognoscenti they're considered a very special type of sushi.  Part of it is that you get the chance to see what the itamae's skills are beyond cutting and presenting the fish, as they have to marinate the gizzard shad before serving in a vinegar, sugar, and salt cure.  Each chef will have their own recipe that they adjust for the individual fish, the season of of the fish, the maturity, fat content, etc. so it will increase the complexity.  It's a phenomenal fish, in my personal opinion, much milder and more delicate than other cured hikarimono."
sushi,39289t,YepYepImaRep,2,Tue Jun 9 16:36:24 2015 UTC,Great reply.  I'll also add that they weren't highly regarded before modern-day sushi became popular; the scent of Konoshiro being grilled was thought to resemble that of human flesh being burnt (I have no idea whether that's true or not). That's why you never see this fish in presentations other than sushi/sashimi.

sushi,393uea,Captain_Fluffy,3,Tue Jun 9 01:47:58 2015 UTC,"So basically you're asking for instructions on making tempura.  Great; I can help with that.  Just remember 3 things.   keep the batter cold do not overmix (gluten will quickly change tempura to a fritter)  remove excess batter (really thin coat)   Temp should be about 180 Celcius (or around 375F).  Do not use self raising flour; optimal is something with a low protein content (cake flour, which you say you don't have). Something like 10% would be great.  How to make the batter: Make an egg-water mixture (1 egg to about a cup of water), and add an equal amount (in volume) of flour. Mix ever so lightly (lumps are fine).   microwaving the flour for a couple of minutes gives you better crunch. Replacing the egg with mayonnaise is a ""trick"" that's used in some households"

sushi,393uea,ukatama,2,Wed Jun 10 01:36:28 2015 UTC,"It basically oxidizes the flour, making it harder for gluten to form.  Less gluten, more crunch.  Just don't overdo it or the flour will burn."

sushi,38p7xa,Fluffheadspharmacy,2,Fri Jun 5 18:46:01 2015 UTC,"Can't speak on Nakazawa (haven't been yet, but it's on my short list), but the most amazing Omakase I've had in NYC was at Sushi Yasuda.  Simply amazing, very friendly chef, perfect texture on the fish, and a very nice variety of fish. One standout was around the 6th piece in, my chef did a sampling of different salmons: scottish king, white king, sockeye, and one other whose name escapes me right now, it was fascinating to compare their flavors and textures.  Later on in the meal, I had the squid and it was unreal, far and away the best ika I've ever had.  Also, a bar seat is highly recommended, but that is implied for almost all omakase."

sushi,38p7xa,smartsushy,0,Sat Jun 6 06:12:15 2015 UTC,"Before seeing any of the responses already made to your post, I realized the only other omakase I had prior to Nakazawa was at Yasuda. My first though was that Nakazawa was definitely better than Yasuda, and worth every penny.  It's ""only"" $120, although this does not include tax/tip, like Yasuda. Every single piece I ate was simply wonderful. It was the best sushi I've ever had, hands down. The standouts for me were the fatty tuna and sea urchin (of course), as well as the Spanish mackerel, eel, tamago, and yellowtail.  The service was impeccable, as expected. But, next time, I would definitely try and snag a seat at the bar, as opposed to the dining room, which is a $30 premium (making it $150). The dining room could get a bit noisy. Although, I had a table of drunken douchebags next to me who seemed to not get out of their homes much.  But, for some people, the sushi bar is a bit pretentious and almost nerve racking. I don't mind that kind of thing, but I could see why people would tense up over it.  All in all, it was absolutely a 10/10. I'll be going to Tokyo for the first time next month, so this got me more excited than ever for my upcoming trip. Also, it's half the price of the well-known omakase spots in Tokyo, which was nice."

Yes this includes sashimi and nigiri too) and this is the restaurant that first started it.   This type of sushi vs. real sushi are basically 2 completely different things.

That's actually one of the ways I judge sushi.  You can look at a lot of places' pictures and get an immediate sense of the quality of their sushi just based on that alone.  Edit: Ok, I'll clarify.  Not all sushi is meant to be eaten in one bite.  Chirashizushi, for instance, is made in a bowl and meant to be eaten with chopsticks over time; I would venture that someone in Japan had the idea of sushi eaten with utensils a long time ago.  What I meant by my comment above is that if you're going to make nigiri or maki and intend for it to be bite sized, as most sushi places are doing (the one OP is referencing obviously has a different goal in mind) it should actually be bite sized.  If they're making nigiri so big that you can't easily eat it in one bite, then they're doing it wrong."

sushi,38lk9h,Fuzzclone,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:13:01 2015 UTC,"It's probably because you haven't had really good mackerel.  It's really difficult to get good mackerel for a couple reasons.  One, it doesn't fetch a premium on the market so there's little incentive for fishermen to take the time to bleed it as soon as its caught and flash freeze like maguro.  Also they're (mostly) not commercially line caught so when you're hauling in thousands of fish at a time in giant nets, there's just no way you can process the fish properly on a fishing boat.  Second, wild mackerel tends to harbor a lot of parasites so that makes for even less demand for screaming fresh mackerel.  That's why the vast majority of the mackerel you'll find at sushi joints is pickled in vinegar--to kill off parasites and attempt to mask the fishiness.  But this pickling process does impart a whole new level of flavor that a lot of people enjoy so it's not a bad thing.  Now in Japan, there are still those that line catch mackerel, especially at certain times of year when they're at their prime and fetch a good price even with smaller catch numbers.  These people can take the time to process the fish quickly to minimize loss of freshness.  Even then it's still hard to find this level of quality in the US because they inevitably degrade during the shipping process...unless a sushi chef in the US near the sea knows a fisherman nearby or something."

sushi,38gbz4,KenBave,13,Thu Jun 4 03:39:57 2015 UTC,"that actually seems odd to me, because when I think about burritos, I enjoy them because they're dense and all the flavors just kind of mesh together, and when I think about sushi, I enjoy them because they're light and you can taste the individual ingredients."

sushi,38gbz4,tangyfish,0,Thu Jun 4 06:52:20 2015 UTC,I live by a sushirito and can tell you they are kind of a ripoff. You are paying about $13.00 to wait in line for a burrito that is mostly veggies and rice.  I think you are better off just going to your local safeway/vons that makes them.

Theyre too messy to eat, it's hard to get soy sauce to not drip everywhere, and their are too many flavors going on at once in your mouth at once. It's really hard to slowly eat a sushirito and give it the time it deserves. Instead you end up wolfing it down ravenously, which is NOT the point of sushi. Or at least not how enjoy it."
sushi,38gbz4,Not_A_Meme,6,Thu Jun 4 04:21:37 2015 UTC,Do you really need the soy sauce though?  If you've already got a lot of flavors going on is it really necessary?

With this in mind, if your plan is to make rolls immediately after purchasing pre-prepared sushi rice, by all means ask away.   also, most sushi restaurants already sell sushi rice on their menu, but al a cart, no more than a cup at a time or so."

Unfortunately, after horse became a more popular food then beef in America (right after either WW1 or WW2 I think), the government decided that people shouldn't be allowed to eat what they'd like, and they made it illegal (that is, to sell horse meat as food, hypothetically you could get around this by buying a live horse, hiring a butcher to slaughter it, and then having him make it into cold cuts for you)"

Magic has a format where you open a pack of cards, pick a card and then pass the rest  to your neighbor so the packs slowly make their way around. You do this a few times and then make a deck with what you have drafted for the tournament.  The event provided this but with sushi(get sushi, pick 1 to put on your plate, pass the rest, their might, or might not be commentary. Like I said, I haven't been able to watch it yet) for the pro players that were still in the tournament. I believe they played an actual magic draft after having their sushi draft."

Just enjoying your sushi is enough compliment for a sushi chef.  You can always thank him for a good meal after you're done eating.  Sushi is traditionally not a slow food, it should rather be considered fast food.  It used to originally be served out of street stalls where people would stand around to eat a few pieces and go.  So realistically you shouldn't expect to sit at a sushi bar for an hour eating."

sushi,37t2q1,joeyvesh13,2,Sat May 30 04:07:39 2015 UTC,Looks incredible. How was it?
sushi,37t2q1,LordXerces,5,Sat May 30 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"Incredible. 1st roll was called Red Phoenix: red tuna, mango, crab, avocado. 2nd roll was Dragon Eye: Salmon, scallion, red caviar, and crab tempura, then deep fried. 3rd roll was Adam & Eve: Blueberries, pineapple, strawberries and shrimp, then deep fried."
sushi,37t2q1,YepYepImaRep,2,Sat May 30 15:16:03 2015 UTC,Is it a matsuhisa nobu property?
sushi,37t2q1,JNS_KIP,1 point,Sat May 30 17:59:18 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't know. But I'm gonna go ahead and say no, based solely on location."
sushi,37t2q1,YepYepImaRep,1 point,Sat May 30 20:21:51 2015 UTC,definitely not. california roll with mango? deep fried rolls?
sushi,37t2q1,JNS_KIP,0,Sun Jun 7 20:48:34 2015 UTC,"Hell, take out in plastic like that in general.  I was just kind of like...Nobu?  This crap?"
sushi,37t2q1,UpVotesAllDayz,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:57:31 2015 UTC,I looked on yelp and I was surprised to see Nobu in LA even does take out at all.
sushi,37t6dv,Myke500,12,Sat May 30 04:44:03 2015 UTC,"The Micky Mouse roll would be the staple of the menu, I would think, so probably a uniquely arranged black-sesame California roll that's meant to for the mouse head?  Then maybe an arrangement of rice with salmon or tuna for the Donald roll. I'm thinking maguro for the beak.   I would think that the Little Mermaid roll would be popular as well, maybe with some soft shell crab (sorry Sebastian) and some carrot as a garnish?   I'm pretty much going off of Disney's tendency to make their food flashy and appear to be something rather than just have each roll as a theme, I guess."
sushi,37t6dv,Interesting_name,3,Sat May 30 06:44:19 2015 UTC,A Flounder roll?!
sushi,37t6dv,graymatter86,8,Sat May 30 17:43:02 2015 UTC,"One of my fave restaurants has an awesome series of fairy tale rolls.  I've pasted the info below, but the menu can be viewed here.    Sleeping Beauty Roll  14.95 Like Princess Aurora asleep in her chamber waiting to be woken with a kiss, this blonde roll is prepared with white tuna (escolar)*, crushed pineapple + tempura flakes wrapped in yellow soy paper + sushi rice, draped with salmon, sliced ripe mango + drizzled with refreshing pineapple-lime mayo. (Ten pieces.) Red Riding Hood Roll  14.95 Ambling through the dark forest with innocence as her only weapon, she leaves the trodden path and encounters the blackest, hungriest of wolves. Our roll is reminiscent of this ancient folk tale: spicy tuna, shrimp tempura + cucumber ensconced in sushi rice + green soy paper, draped with pared scallop + strawberry medallions, topped with black tobiko + drizzled with red berry coulis. (Ten Pieces.) The Frog Prince Roll  14.95 In one version, the princess flings the frog against a stone wall; in another, her kiss precipitates its transmogrification into prince; but what to do if your prince is actually a frog and not the other way around? The interior: salmon, mango + tempura crunch; the exterior: layered with avocado + crowned with spicy snow crab + tobiko salad. The Snow Queen Roll (Vegetarian)  12.95 Benumbed & blue in the ice palace, Kay feels nothing, for his heart’s a lump of ice; only Gerda’s tears can warm his frozen heart. Our roll evokes childhood memories of grandmother’s tales. Shiitake, green apple, cukes & asparagus wrapped in seaweed & rice, draped with young coconut meat, drizzled with pineapple mayo, garnished with coconut flakes. (8 pieces) The Rumpelstiltskin Roll  14.95 Three times, he spun straw into gold, then awaited his prize. Under a coverlet of dark branches, round a smoky fire he danced a jig. “Today I brew, tomorrow I bake; then the Prince child I will take; for no one knows my little game: that Rumpelstiltskin is my name!” Inside: wok-roasted balsamic-glazed shiitake, asparagus tempura + green apple. Outside: fresh tuna, drizzled with wasabi mayo; topped with spring onion confetti; crowned with crispy yu mein.    I've never personally had one (so $$$!) but they look really good when I see someone order them!"
sushi,37t6dv,starkfield,5,Sat May 30 16:17:10 2015 UTC,Their futomaki roll would be the Ursula roll...
sushi,37t6dv,incandescance,4,Sat May 30 12:26:46 2015 UTC,Cinderolla.
sushi,37t6dv,MauiJim,5,Sat May 30 17:45:53 2015 UTC,"I know it doesn't match the theme of your question entirely, but Disney actually does have a sushi bar. They have 2 more expensive restaurants that serve sushi (here and here) and one that is more 'fast food' style sushi (here). They're all pretty fantastic, but unfortunately no Disney themed rolls :("
sushi,37t6dv,vickipaperclips,1 point,Sat May 30 06:39:58 2015 UTC,"I was at your first link only a couple of months ago. I went for the sushi sampler, their selection was less than my local grocery store's. I can't speak for the quality of the rolls, but they were definitely not bad at all."
sushi,37t6dv,FragmentOfBrilliance,3,Mon Jun 8 21:31:11 2015 UTC,Spider Roll would be renamed the Sebastian Roll.
sushi,37t6dv,h2g2Ben,2,Sat May 30 10:29:48 2015 UTC,"Local sushi place SuBe sushi has one called ""Found Nemo"".  It's crab, avocado, asparagus, with seared salmon and spicy aioli.  Had to order it."
sushi,37t6dv,sassymcgee,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:04:47 2015 UTC,Dragon Roll would be the Mushu Roll.
sushi,37t6dv,Skeeders,1 point,Sat May 30 15:34:30 2015 UTC,Tigger roll...every other roll has eel sauce or a orange caviar/sauce.
sushi,37t6dv,graymatter86,0,Sat May 30 17:42:37 2015 UTC,There is sushi at Disney
sushi,37s4wq,jsheves,4,Fri May 29 23:13:05 2015 UTC,Sushi Nakazawa or Ichimura for sushi if you can get reservations. I've got recommendations for non-sushi places too if you'd like.
