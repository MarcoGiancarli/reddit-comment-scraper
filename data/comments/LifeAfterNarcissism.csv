With all this crap going on and them upsetting you, maybe it's a good idea to step back on the visits for his sake. I know its ""family"" but this was insane and actually pretty scary. Plus they were trying to manipulate both of you with that damn castle and it isn't right. Maybe I'm just being overly protective since you've got a small child, but I just can't stand people messing with children like that. Sounds like your brother in law's child might just be the GC, I hope neither are, but it sucks for both kids to be used against each other like that."

I'm sorry you and your son had to go through that really unpleasant experience.   Poor little guy. How dare they give a gift and take it away the next day!

LifeAfterNarcissism,3e58b8,RepostGurdy,2,Wed Jul 22 07:28:40 2015 UTC,Its a really difficult thing when you know a loved one is in a weakened state and you have to defend them. This was more about manipulating you and messing with you. They used the most powerful thing they could find against you which is your mothering instinct. N's dont realize the far reaching effects their attention seeking behavior has. They think other people are too stupid or needy to remember the damage. Just protect your baby and cherish the bond you have with him. Remind him of how fun the ice cream and the castle were. We dont always get those moments.

Who are these people and why does their opinion matter?    I got my Bachelor's when I was 40 and my Master's when I was 50, and in both cases I was not the oldest student.  Most people were very encouraging.  If anyone was thinking, ""Why didn't she do that sooner?"" they never mentioned it to me.  The people who went to college when they were younger don't care that you are going later in life.  The people who are not yet free enough to make their own decisions think they hope to be where you are one day.

I also have a wonderful mate, children, grand children.  The Ns of my family, and their flying monkeys, will all tell you how alone they feel.  Narcissists don't age well.

Now I'm not saying lying is good, but it just hit me recently how entirely commonplace it is. That that is what friends do for each other. Family too. I'm not saying its honorable to be dishonest. Or that it is a goal in of itself, but compare that to my controlfreak nparents would always accuse me of lying even though I told the truth TO A FAULT. In fact, their scapegoating in this way made me a very naturally blunt and hopelessly trusting person. I'm only learning now, that the capability of the group to lie to save it's members is something you need to factor in all the time. But if I had kids though, the art of lying (and providing alibis) is something I would hope they would learn, and the value of lying (and keeping secrets) for one's friends and family (small lies of course! Nothing major!) as well as the importance of finding allies that would do this for you (especially in our falsely litigious society) is something I would hope they knew how to do, in the scope of learning how to navigate this complex world and also knowing that this is what other people do ALL THE TIME as well.

LifeAfterNarcissism,3e0na3,nheddie,3,Tue Jul 21 04:51:51 2015 UTC,"I think kids might in general be smarter than we give them credit for, and if you don't give them a good idea of what's going to happen, they might be scared and stressed.   As to exactly how to explain that to them... I'm not sure, probably depends on their personalities.  I guess I'd point out how talking to a therapist is kind of weird, but it helped you, and they're really nice. They really care about how they're feeling and won't tell anybody else what they're thinking - they just want to help them make sense of things they might be confused about."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3e0na3,cyanoside,2,Tue Jul 21 06:57:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah... on the other hand, it's a fine line because there are bad therapists out there and you want to make sure your kids can be open with you about feeling uncomfortable."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3e0na3,craaackle,2,Tue Jul 21 12:32:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe you can talk to the therapist about these fears and see what you both can do to make it easier on everyone. If the therapist doesn't understand where you're coming from, maybe that's a sign."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3e0na3,PrancerPrancer,3,Tue Jul 21 17:27:44 2015 UTC,I think calling it a 'talking appointment' sounds great.   My only thought on this is that you make sure your  Kids are really clear that they're not having a 'talking appointment' because they did something wrong or there is something wrong with them. So that they don't associate any shame with it.
LifeAfterNarcissism,3e0na3,DamagedDamsel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:10:54 2015 UTC,"That is a concern, for sure. I've been increasingly frustrated with them lately and I've had many talks with my daughter about all of this.   I think I may phrase it as a head and heart appointment. That just like we want our bodies to be healthy, we want our hearts and minds to be healthy too, and the way we do that is we talk to someone we trust about how we are feeling about the big and small things that happen in our lives that are sometimes confusing...?"

LifeAfterNarcissism,3e0na3,wildernessmap,2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:47 2015 UTC,"Yes - we had our daughter work with a therapist for anxiety - she was 5 at the time and it was very helpful.  As far as advice - just explain to the kids that this is a doctor who helps you manage your feelings.  At the time she was having such a tough time she wanted to go to make things better.  She was having trouble sleeping (worrying comets would hit the house, dying from diabetes - lots of different fears that would occupy her mind at night).  Just be direct, make it no different than going to the regular doctor and explain that this is someone who is here to help you with any bad feelings."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3e0na3,wildernessmap,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:03 2015 UTC,Thank you!
LifeAfterNarcissism,3e0na3,wildernessmap,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:05 2015 UTC,"I would say, make it very clear to them that they're not going to therapy because there's ""something wrong."" Present the therapy as something like, ""you can talk to this nice man/woman about anything you want and it might make you feel better, if you have some things you want to talk about that you're shy to talk to me about.""   I can't stress this enough.  If they think they're 'going to therapy' because they've been 'acting out' then...... bad times.  Therapy was ALWAYS used by my Nparents as a ""there's something wrong with you, you have to talk to this nice man until he thinks you're not bad anymore.""  I can't overstate this.  If the kids start to associate therapy with you being anxious or angry, then therapy will never be therapeutic for them.  If they see therapy as something that is for them, like a truly, truly safe space, then that will be much, much better for them.  But if they associate therapy with any kind of judgement or anxiety, then it's going to be totally counterproductive.  ETA: Also, I would ask both of them after the first session ""did you like (therapist name)? If you don't like this person, you don't have to talk to him/her."" I really recommend making sure that the kids actually like and feel comfortable with the therapist.  Kids are taught not to talk to 'strange' people (for good reason, I believe) so if they are required to 'talk' to a therapist, and that therapist isn't someone they feel natural and comfortable around, that can set a kind of troubling precedent. ""I was made to talk to a grown up about private things and I didn't like that grown up and I didn't want to"" < A situation like that can un-do a lot of the 'protect your boundaries' things we teach our kids.  TLDR; Ask your kids if they like the therapist, and get an honest answer. If your kids don't really like the therapist, or feel totally comfortable with him/her, then don't require them to go back and consider looking for another one."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3e0na3,wildernessmap,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:07:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you!   I see my own therapist today, so I will probably ask her about this as well. I don't really know what will be going on tomorrow. For my own ""intake assessment"" they just asked me a bunch of questions to determine what kind of therapy they thought would be beneficial. The woman we are seeing tomorrow may not be the actual therapist that the kids see later.   My only experience with things related to therapy was a custody evaluator who had us draw a picture of our family and then used it to ""prove"" that our Ndad was ""very important to us"" based on the fact that I drew him taller than our mom... our dad is 6'2"",,, our mom is 5'2"".... I drew dad taller because, duh...She was awful. Then there was the child psychologist who believed me when I said I hated my dad and he was awful and I wanted to live with my mom... we never saw him again after he testified that my mom should have full custody and my dad managed to get that thrown out. And then there was a woman who did group therapy with me and my sisters that consisted of a workbook about Biblical ""submitting to your father""...   I think I have told my daughter about talking to someone safe. I almost didn't make an appointment for my son, because he's not really overtly showing any signs of being distressed, besides the increase in stinkerish behavior. But the woman I spoke to on the phone basically said why the heck not?   I will definitely stress to them that they don't have to go if they don't want to.   Do you think I should tell their dad that they are going to start therapy?"
LifeAfterNarcissism,3e0na3,wildernessmap,2,Tue Jul 21 12:25:32 2015 UTC,"Ugh, say no more about the bogus as hell 'custody therapy' lady. And 'submit to your father'? Yeah, take it from a very religious person ( me! ) that is utter, utter bullshite!   As for the 'intake' meeting, I have no idea how that will go. To be honest, you may need to have a private one-on-one with the intake person before the intake meeting itself. That seems like a reasonable thing to request. I think these meetings often range from 'my child was molested and we're here to get therapy for him' to 'the child's grandfather died and she's not taking it very well' to 'my husband and i are separating and we just want to make sure the child is protected and cared for during this process, although nothing major has occurred yet.'  So the intake meeting is probably as much of a mystery to the 'intaker' as it is to you.   I just think a phone call before hand would be helpful for you. There are things that any parent would want to say to a potential therapist that they wouldn't want to say in front of the children.  Just remember, YOU Are the MOM! If anyone says or does anything that feels off to you, don't continue with the meeting.   And, to be honest, i have no idea whether or not you should tell their dad they're in therapy. It sounds like you guys have a really really challenging relationship, and it sounds like no matter what you do he has the potential to cry and moan about it.    Trust your instincts on that one.  You certainly don't need his 'approval' to get them into therapy, unless you guys have some kind of overly involved 'parenting plan' type thing.   Basically, I think it would be of benefit to you to call the place you're going to go, and ask them what you should expect from the intake meeting before the meeting, and also express any concerns you may have in this phone call. If they brush you off or poo-poo your concerns, make note of that, as it may be an indicator of the kind of care they provide (and not in a good way....)   Asking these questions over the phone reduces the amount of tension and anxiety you may have when you get there.  Also, the providers can tell you what it is that they hope to provide to your child(ren) so you can ascertain whether or not you and the therapy provider are on the same page.  Also, I would absolutely recommend against saying anything in the meeting (in front of your children) that is in any way disparaging against the child's father, or their living situation, unless you have genuine, tangible concerns (alcohol use in front of the kids, corporal punishment that you don't agree with, something like that.)   I think it's best to avoid a situation where your daughter thinks 'Oh, mom said she was mad at dad in that meeting, I guess that's why I'm here, I'm here so I can fix it and make mom stop being mad at dad.'    The more you make the therapy about the kid and the less about 'the parental situation' the better.  Once she gets into the therapy, she can open up without feeling like she has a 'job' to do."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3dx087,gatitachifera,17,Mon Jul 20 06:02:27 2015 UTC,"A smile that isn't real is the first clue.   A smile that happens with the mouth but the eyes aren't smiling.    Also, when you talk about yourself or your 'accomplishments' and the person makes a joke or minimizes them, that's a very good clue.  Ultimately, anything that makes you feel like the person is trying to 'neg' you or bring you down is a big, big red flag.  Narcissism isn't always about self aggrandizing, it's also bringing someone else down.  Now that I've told the truth about the narcissists in my life/family, I can see it really clearly. Another early clue is always trying to steer things toward them (in a superior way) and/or away from you.   Yes, Love bombing is a thing that can be very confusing: 'oh, you're so great, you're so awesome, you're so talented, you're so cool,' but the key to this one is to ask yourself 'How long does this last?'  Do they compliment me, only to insult me later on?   One of the narcs in my life learned this to perfection from her father - big grand compliments and then snide, hurtful insults later on.  Also: trust your instincts. If someone gives you a bad feeling and you can't quite put your finger on it. Trust that feeling. And back away."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3dx087,BleedingBlack,6,Mon Jul 20 17:27:56 2015 UTC,"um, well,  I grew up around a few upper-middle class people (though I wasn't one myself) and I've never thought there was a real similarity between them and the narcs in my life.   I've also worked for and with all 'types' and I've not noticed any more or fewer narcissists in 'upper classes.'  Genuine confidence and 'healthy pride' are, in my experience, unrelated to socioeconomic 'status' and easy to distinguish from narcissism.

Some people are just generally cheery, and it's kind of an 'all the time' thing. But people who are fake nice do it to ingratiate themselves to people - and it Doesn't Last.  I've noticed the fake niceness of a narcissist is hard for them to maintain AND when it slips, there is a really, really strong and unsettling nastiness underneath.

Then, when they reacted poorly, I knew it wasn't because I set the expectation for them. Back when I had announced my engagement long before learning about NPD, my mom said she would never speak to me again... I wonder if part of that was because I didn't present it as an awesome thing. So, if you present this as ""I feel more comfortable with this identity"" or whatever, you know it's on them to keep their discomfort to themselves. If they don't, that's fine.

If you just need to talk to someone about your experiences, it is not the place of your daughter to be the dumping ground for your hurt. Go to counseling for that, keep a journal; do anything but unload on your daughter.   If your reasons are because you fear your nfamily getting in contact with your daughter, it would be easier to guide your daughter into that conversation with leading questions. For example, ask about her experiences with your mom, her understanding of why you aren't in contact. Try to understand your daughter's viewpoint. Only share if she asks questions or if you feel sharing details would be for her benefit.  Ultimately, my view is that the mess we grew up with deserves to die in silence. The fewer details about abuse I share with my children, the better off they'll be."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3dv6ga,corathus59,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:39:22 2015 UTC,"I think that you could give a very abstract view of the abuse. If your daughter is interested in hearing why you are NC, be honest - but don't tell her ""she did X, x, and x to me."" Instead describe the overall abusive behaviors - gaslighting is a really powerful example of verbal abuse that can essentially rewrite your poor brain. By saying, ""these were the ways in which she abused me,"" without actually giving any specifics, you can avoid giving your daughter the horror of your experiences without sheltering her from the truth that there are people in the world who will behave that way, and (unfortunately) the best she can do is learn to avoid them.

LifeAfterNarcissism,3dtux8,PrancerPrancer,13,Sun Jul 19 12:16:25 2015 UTC,"My vote would be to listen to that little voice in your gut that is telling you to avoid the drama. If your manipulation-detectors are giving red alarms even at the stage of initial emails and texts, then perhaps maintaining some healthy distance would be better for all concerned. If the FLEAS plus the potential of making NC with your nmom more difficult by being in close contact with potential FM's,  then maybe this is something you should avoid. Maybe your therapist has a point about the projections and so forth, but you need to protect your own health first before you can do very much good for anyone else.  The fact that you have the feeling that you should help is a sign that you want to help make the world a better place. The world needs more people like that. But maybe you should pass on this request. Let someone else who would suffer far fewer triggers in the situation step in to that situation. There will be other situations that you can contribute in with fewer triggers for you.    I hope you can continue to heal. Best wishes to you."

This therapist has mostly been fantastic, and I've made a HUGE amount of progress these last 7 months. Ordinarily I find her completely non-judgemental. However, she's not a specialist on N-abuse (sometimes she doesn't 'get it' at first). Also, I get the sense she has her own set of triggers around feelings of injustice. It's something I've hit up against before. I think I may have triggered her sense of injustice with my feelings about this situation."

From what you say it sounds like I'm not.   It's entirely possible that my manipulation-detectors are just much better than most people's. Behavior that might seem okay to other people triggers alarms for me, because it is manipulative behavior.  It's just that people who haven't grown up in that environment (like my therapist) aren't able to see it in the early stages.   It's also possible my therapist is right about me projecting. But then, as you say, there are maybe just too many triggers in that situation for me to walk into it and keep myself healthy, so maybe I can leave it for someone else who doesn't have my history to help out this time. Thank you very much for sharing your opinion."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3dtux8,wildernessmap,6,Sun Jul 19 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"I think that you are right. This does sound like an emotionally dangerous situation.   Practicing saying ""No. That won't work for me."" is really really hard. There will always be times when you need to say No in order to protect yourself, and that does sometimes feel icky. But it isn't selfish to do so. It is hard to be the best kind of helpful to someone who is hurting you as you try to help. Overall, it would inhibit your ability to help and end up hurting both of you.  If you really can't stand the thought of saying No outright, offer help that you know is emotionally safe, and let her accept or reject your offer. If you are able to hire a maid for her, or able to make frozen meals that can be dropped off before the surgery... But it sounds to me like you kind of don't want to go near her in any capacity.

I realize this isn't exactly like your situation but the 'group email' part of it raises a lot of red flags for me. There is a real 'peer pressure' type thing going on here that is absolutely unhealthy.  I vote no. In fact, depending on how close you are with the email sender don't even send a response.  You don't owe anyone an explanation for your choices.

I almost missed my Ndad. It was just grief over not having the family I wanted, but it was still confusing. I'm still not sure if it was just a step in recovery or me sabotaging myself. I did feel scared of moving on sometimes, like if I really got better then I'd forget what happened to me and let Ndad back in by basically gaslighting myself into believing ""it wasn't so bad."" I've been working on striking a balance, because I realized that if I don't move on then HE STILL WINS by doing absolutely NOTHING. Living well is the best revenge. It's also how to help yourself be your true self. Those people that hurt you don't define you. They don't need to come back in once you've made progress.

Thank you."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3drx5i,PrancerPrancer,2,Sun Jul 19 12:04:48 2015 UTC,"I hope this helps in some small measure.   First thing, ease up on yourself. In some sense, you are continuing the abuse your parents were doing to you all those years. I get how easy it is to hate yourself, it's what you've known all your life.  It was all I knew growing up, it was just how the world worked right? . My parents showed me only disdain and hate, I took that up as a normal, every day way of living but in reality, it is just a preprogrammed pattern. You can unlearn it and retrain yourself. When you've had time and distance from them, there will come a time for you to choose the life you want and how you want to live it. Right now it is critical to focus on healing and finding the good in life.   You have been NC for 6 months, congratulate yourself for that! That is a big accomplishment. Sit down and feel actual gratitude that you have found the strength to go this long. Each and every day that you wake up and you are NC, feel that gratitude that you have found that inner strength.   The first time I went NC with Nmom, it lasted a year, she used my grandmother to guilt me into talking to her. We talked for another year and I was right back where I started, feeling angry, hating myself, the works. I returned to NC. That lasted another year and then Nmom pulled one of her stunts, this time she was dying, it was the last time I would see her, blah, blah, blah. The truth was, she needed a pace maker, she wasn't dying but she saw an opportunity to manipulate me. I fell for it.   Now I've been NC for over two years and it feels great. I am thankful for all of the experiences I've had dealing with her, it has made me stronger, better able to see the manipulations and it has taught me that I am ok being my own person and only seeking my own approval. I don't feel that pull or that need to show her that I'm good enough to love. The hard reality is that she is not capable of love, not even loving herself. I feel overwhelming gratitude that I can say that now, that I can say it out loud and I can make those decisions and feel good about who I have become but that took time and work.   That is one thing that is tough in the beginning, approving of ourselves, loving ourselves, we are raised to seek the approval outside of ourselves and it is hard to release that. We were taught not to trust our inner voice, we weren't good enough to know better. That is a tough thing to release but you can, just keep doing what you're doing.   As for worrying about what you will do in the future, that serves no purpose but to create misery and self abuse. Right now, you are not that person you will become, so you are seeing and deciding that future based on the wounded person you are right now. Given time to heal, flourish and grow, you will be making different decisions when that day comes. As someone else said, take it one day at a time. The future will come, worry about it when it shows up but not today.   For now, what is most critical is to honor yourself, find good in the world, no matter how small, celebrate the little things in your life that make you happy or bring you pleasure, congratulate yourself for finally making a break from your abusers and striking out on your own. You are much stronger than you give yourself credit."

My personal version of what you describe was the idea that: ""If I heal and get better, and stop hating myself, it is like letting my parents off, like what they did to me didn't mean anything, and there will be no justice. At least if I hate myself there is evidence of what they did.""   So of course, I didn't really want to get better. Except that the pain of self-hatred is pretty exhausting. And I didn't want to feel that way.   About 8 months into therapy, I shifted something, I walked out of self-hatred. (I cant describe it any better than that.)  Nowadays I'm somewhere between liking myself, and possibly loving myself.   Soon after this shift, I started feeling some guilt about 'abandoning' my NMom. And felt like maybe I should go back and try again to have some kind of relationship with NMom. (Just like you describe.)  But, I haven't gone back.  I posted here about it and everyone's response was a resounding NOOOOO. I talked with SO, and his response was NOOOO. I talked with therapist, and she was like NOOOO. I asked myself what I wanted (the most important person to ask), and I was like NOOOOO. So I haven't. I hold the idea that I might still one day, and that I might never go back, and I trust that I am a pretty decent human being, and whatever choice I make will be a good one.    Ultimately, the point I am making is this. You said:   Even if I hate myself and think awful things about myself and believe them, at least these feelings and thoughts will keep me safe from them.    Here's what I think -  the thing that keeps us most safe from our abusers is self-love. If we love ourselves, we don't allow others to abuse us. I know for a fact, that if I did see NMom today, I would do a much better job of protecting myself from her. I know that I wouldn't take her BS. I know that I wouldn't care about her opinions at all. I know that I would strongly enforce my boundaries. I know that I would just walk away from her nonsense. I know that I wouldn't get sucked into her little dramas. I know that I wouldn't revert to that helpless 3 year old she used to turn me into. I know that I would assertively stand up for myself, like the healthy, empowered adult I am today, and that it would be difficult for her to hurt me. I know that I would be much safer from her today than I was 6 months ago, or 6 years ago.  And this is because I like myself.  And one day, when I love myself, I know that I will be even safer from her.   Some of your friends may have gone back to their abusers and still be suffering, I'd argue that if they are putting up with more abuse, they probably haven't healed much and still don't like themselves much. Others may genuinely be healed and happy and able to ignore their parent's behavior like they are just an annoying little fly. These people love themselves, and are able to see their parents for the pitiful creatures they truly are, and extend some pity to them, at the same time as keeping themselves safe from the pathetic little tantrums of those pitiful creatures.    Those are just my thoughts anyhow!"

It's my personal experience and I can testify firsthand how hard this is, but there's a payoff. Ok, ready?  Just stop caring what other people think of you.  Because I was constantly seeking my family's approval, I found that in social situations I was always worried about people's opinion of me. I was afraid of offending them, or saying the wrong thing... and I ended up driving them away. A beautiful person, someone I've talked about on this subreddit before, asked me why I cared so much about people who didn't like me. I couldn't give her an answer.  There are almost 8 billion people on this planet. Chances are, someone is going to like you for who you are. Why not BE that person and let other people who think you're cool ask YOU to lunch or decide to spend their time around YOU? Once I realized this, I let go... and became a better person. Suddenly i had far more friends than when I was chasing them relentlessly. They were drawn to me because they liked who I was, not the person i was pretending to be so they'd like me more. And the people who didn't? Suddenly I didn't care. Something I read on twitter years ago - ""Don't kiss the ass that's shitting on you, son."" It's true - you just end up covered in shit.  This isn't to say that I don't care about what my friends think, but I also try to set healthy boundaries with them. We're friends, not a unified entity - I may like white chocolate with coconut and you may like dark with chili peppers. Set realistic expectations and live by them.... and if someone decides they can't make time for you, it's ok to stop making time for them.  Hope this helps, and that you find some peace :) internet hugs"

LifeAfterNarcissism,3dkt2p,Isturma,8,Sat Jul 18 00:31:38 2015 UTC,"This gets easier. The environment we were raised in escalates our sensitivity to rejection. Once you're aware of that, you will find your way of managing the symptoms. For me, I tend to write myself notes in the note section of my cell phone. I can pull them up when I need to remind myself of certain things that play out over and over.   Example: once I feel rejected and hurt by someone my head tends to spiral with a bunch of negative thoughts. I interpret normal interactions I have had previously with that person as having hidden meaning. When this starts to play itself out in my life now I pull out a note that I wrote myself and reread it. The note says ""do to take it all so personally"". It's just a reminder, but it works to help calm me down. Then I can make decisions about what relationships to put energy into when I'm not having so many feelings."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3dkt2p,Fancy512,2,Fri Jul 17 02:53:28 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for this little piece of advice... I'll have to do this for myself. Ty very much!
LifeAfterNarcissism,3dkt2p,wildernessmap,5,Fri Jul 17 05:27:33 2015 UTC,"I have a system for dealing with this type of thing. Based on the number 3.  The first two times someone 'does't respond' or makes me feel like they're not interested or reliable, I let it slide, or get some kind of confirmation of why it happened.  (Schedule conflict, I fell asleep, busy at work.)  If the reasons aren't satisfactory such that I feel like they genuinely want to spend time with me, and they are genuinely nice and reliable, I make note of it.  Sometimes people are simply not very nice or reliable...that happens sometimes and it takes time to figure that out.   But I don't make a decision until the 3rd instance of flakery. If someone is not reciprocating energy-wise, and doesn't make me feel like they value me or my time, then I simply let them go. Stop expecting a genuine friendship. Sometimes this happens.   I had a friend who I was super close with about a year and a half/two years ago.  I seriously thought I'd found my new best friend. She's hilarious, I miss her right now even thinking about her.  She had some drama in her life (relationship breakdown, then trying to put the relationship back together, that kind of thing) that caused her to flaaaaaaaaaaaake a lot.  This is still the reason why she flakes to this day. (He got back together with his wife, and she's letting herself be the side chick and she knows I don't approve so she hides from me :( Even though I would like to see her, I know this is why she texts and dashes on me.... )   When we were friends, I let her flake like 3+ times. It actually hurt, and I felt rejected. Then I realized two things    I don't have to drop everything everytime she wants to get together (like I had been) and  I don't have to take it personally.   Long story short, my friend is a flaaaaaaaaaaaaake. And I know this about her. She's not in my 'top drawer' of friends anymore, and I keep my emotional distance - but I don't have any strong ill-will against her. I just know that she wasn't able to 'give' in the way I needed and she was kind of unreliable in a way that bothered me. Me and my husband helped her when she was shopping for a car, we really treated her like a member of the family, it hurt when she flaked. It did.   She whatsapps me from time to time. I always invite her to my house, cause I want her to know she's welcome, but I never expect a reply. And I never get one.  C'est la vie.    Basically, I created a system of 'vetting'. And once someone lets me down 3 times, I put them in the 2nd tier of trustworthiness, and I don't expect them to be reliable anymore.   Sometimes people are simply not worth the energy you give them, and you have to pull back and give that energy to yourself.   TLDR; In my opinion, if someone makes you feel like they don't value you after 3 'incidents', then it's okay to 'throw them away' for lack of a better term."

She went through family loss and has a few other struggles. She's been not giving in the same way I am, and it's been making me feel bad.   I took a step back and it helped me, but I think I've been resisting letting go because she's my oldest friend and I don't have a replacement. I started to analyze the relationship as a whole though, and I'm starting to see that maybe it's always been this way, just not this bad. I've always put in more energy thatn her. She gives her energy to others as well, she loves me, but I'm lower on her priority list than she is on mine. I'm trying to work through the emotions that come with that realization and have a plan going forward. It really sucks, but I think it's inevitable."

Often, people want to 'demand' that someone care about them or treat them in a certain way. You're being really mature by recognizing that she's not treating you how you want to be treated, but you know you can't 'force' another kind of situation.  I'm sorry to read you don't have a replacement, as you say. I have some kind of airy-fairy views on things like this, so I won't go off on a tangent here, but, perhaps the replacement situation is going to be better and more healthy for you in the long run...Even if that means you don't have a person in this role for a while.  And, the universe has an infinite supply of friends, I believe.  I know that might not mitigate the sense of loss and upset that you feel, but I hope you know that you are able to make new friends, too."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3dkt2p,PrancerPrancer,3,Fri Jul 17 21:14:30 2015 UTC,"As ACONs we didn't get our most basic needs met when we were infants.  One part of the trauma this causes is that as adults, we subconsciously try to get those needs met in our adult life. This is a mission that is doomed to failure.  We are adults now, and no other adult is going to meet our needs the way our parents SHOULD have done when we were helpless infants.  I wonder if you are 'throwing people away' as you put it, in order to prevent yourself having to experience over again that profound loneliness, betrayal and sense of abandonment that we ACONs suffered as infants.   I also wonder if, accepting that you will never get those needs met by others now you are an adult, will help you to be able to let others meet some of your needs, and give you some nurturing and support. And also help you to let others come to you, rather than feeling you have to 'chase people to try and gain friendships'.    You cannot make a friendship happen, but you can put yourself out there and meet a lot of people, try to be your most authentic, FLEA-free self, and trust there are people out there who will love you for you. That's the only part you have any control over.     I sense from your short post that you are both insightful and courageous, there are lots of people out there who will love that about you.

I have a larp I attend once a month and DnD every Wednesday. Games are good because there's something other then just each other to focus on so it's less stressful.   Trying to herd other people onto your schedule is more difficult and can put people off. One on one can also be significantly more stressful for the person you're inviting and more likely to get turned down. Instead try throwing parties.   You don't have to be a nerd like me or involve any sort of intoxicants if you don't want to.   If there's a particular person you really want to hang out with, invite that person's friends to whatever. The person you really want to see is more likely to show up.  A part of friendship is being able to be cool with other people. If someone can't answer, that person is busy but it doesn't mean that person hates you, just that they're welding, covered in bees, having sex, driving, etc. I find that picturing people who don't answer in a silly situation like scuba diving or getting surprised by an animal home invader really helps. My friend isn't mad at me, a raccoon busted in to eat those cheetos he's always leaving out and now he's trying to get it to leave by shaking a toy light saber at it.

I don't want to be dismissive of the video because I appreciate your posting it and I think there's good content, but I am wary of sel-described ""international leaders"" and I got a bit of a narcissist vibe from Teal and a co-dependent vibe from Ross."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3dkstw,IAmAsEvolutionMadeMe,6,Sat Jul 18 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"So, Im just going to throw this out there (I havent watched this video in particular). I dont know a thing about Ross Rosenberg, but Teal is a fraud and probably a narcissist herself, like Sam Vankin who is an ""authority"" on the topic and declares himself to be a psychopath, and I would take what she says carefully and with a grain of salt. Sam has a lot of useful info there is no doubt, but I do think its important to still be cautious of what we take to heart since we are in a place of healing.   I used to watch her videos and I liked them at first but felt something was off about her, like she wasnt the teacher but an actress. It became clear as time went on that she is extremely dishonest at best, and has a team of ex boyfriends that manage and market her-not so much what she actually is about and teaches. There are interviews out now with past clients and roommates of hers that detail her bizarre abuse and manipulation, encouraging suicide as an option when her methods dont work etc. She also claims to be an ""extrasensory luminary"", a eucharist, a psychic, an alien projected into a human form (one from the 6th dimension, no less, that was intentionally chosen to be super a attractive white woman to appeal to everyone in a powerful way 'across all continents', yes she said that herself. Also, the whiter you are, the more alien DNA you have, and therefore more capable of understanding her 'mission'. yes, she says that too), a survivor of 13yrs ritual satanic abuse while also having been a model, telemark skier, and also traveled to china somehow during all of that to learn ancient healing arts there. She uses symbols from the Necronomicon and the cartoon Full Metal Alchemist in her ""soul retrival"" paintings. Its all very strange but it seems like more and more people are noticing her stories dont add up and her teachings arent unique to her, they are taken from a lot of other sources, which is fine, but some of them are skewed in weird ways and credit is rarely given.   Anyway, just a little disclaimer. I dont think everything she says is bullshit, but a lot of it is and I think her motives are nefarious after doing a lot of research and hearing her talk about her life and how she is consistently ""revictimized"" by people questioning the story she is using to sell her books and workshops, and anyone she cant 'help' (convince them that they, too, are aliens or victims of abductions or part of the galactic federation/ are are satanic cult spies, victims of ritual abuse they dont remember, or perpetrators of the same) are demonized as psychopaths out to hurt Teal, or spies from the 'blood covenant' mormon cult, or the satanic one because her abuser apparently had multiple personalities and was coincidentally in two opposing cults, according to teal, literally. But if the dissenters  are female, they are just jealous of her beauty and want her fame, simple as that, no further conspiracy needed.   Its totally weird behavior for a ""spiritual teacher"". She gives me the creeps in a huge way.   So anyway, there is that for consideration"

LifeAfterNarcissism,3dkstw,kastacrona,2,Sat Jul 18 23:08:17 2015 UTC,"""there is nothing at all wrong with the narcissist"" crriiinge. ok. it does seem that a lot of what she preaches IS narcissism. Like ""dont feel bad that you only want to date men who gives you presents and money, gifts are MY love language""(an actual tealism), and then proceeds to justify shallowness and one-sided exchanges instead of encouraging people to consider and reflect why they are only interested in those things as opposed to ...i dunno,  reciprocity, mutual respect, genuine authenticity (she talks a lot about authenticity, but ironically, in a very superficial way. As long as you admit to being selfish and superficial and say just what you want, you are authentic and have no need to change or introspect). It never actually considers the 'other' or the outcomes of those kind of expectations. She is expert at rationalization and circular logic. Its too familiar for my tastes."

Cameron Clark is the name of the interviewee I am thinking of, as well what happened to Fallon on ""shadow house"" and in the forums there.   Im not trying to say that everything she says is crap or that the video is, Im just saying take her with a grain of salt and look into her a bit, because it does matter if you follow what she teaches. Also like I said, initially I liked her videos, some of it makes sense and led me to other things that were helpful to me. But that icky feeling was pervasive until people started coming forward and I realized why she was a little unsettling to me.  Just my own opinion that I wouldnt trust her because of some of the crazy stuff that has come out and that she has said herself. And for a lot of other reason that I wont get into for the sake of brevity.    For what its worth, I still watch sam vankin videos from time to time, even though he is a proud narcissist, because his information is good. But it shook me up when I first saw ""I, Psycopath"", because I didnt know he was anything other than a teacher ABOUT it, not a narc himself talking all about narcissism. It made me question a lot of the new peace I had found, it made me question my own intelligence and intuition, and it made me question the genuinely helpful info I received. Hence the disclaimer, if the info helps there is no reason not to use it, but go in with open eyes so that the benefit isnt shattered when the illusion is."

Her followers call themselves ""tealers"", people who point out any inconsistency are called ""anti-tealers"" by them AND teal, as though she is the new christ (she calls herself the 'leader of the new age' as well), and its not her message that is important, but the personality of teal herself. And the tealers defend her by slandering the dissenter and calling them ugly or jealous, unenlightened (like any peaceful love and light type would, right?) Its so weird, I've been following the whole thing off and on for a while because its growing so fast and is honestly fascinating, its a matter of time before it all comes to light.

It took some emails explaining that well, yeah, I had a really fucked up childhood and am an under-socialized and basically feral but well educated adult.

The only advice I can offer you, OP, and feel free to take or leave it - is to check your first reaction to everything and ask yourself if the reaction is based on habit, or if it is based on your feelings at that moment. Then ask yourself, what is the better avenue to take, and then take it and just see what happens.

Oftentimes the NVoice-in-the-head will constantly switch statements and tactics, and the key is to patiently hang on to the same simple statement.  If it starts to harp on one point constantly that directly undermines your simple statement, you figure out a new simple statement that thwarts the new ongoing attack...and now patiently stick with that one.

Then visualize my two hands reaching out, and gently moving it off to the side.  (It's very important that we don't stuff down and in, only gently aside.)    As I gently move it aside I say in my mind, ""that was then, this is now"".  Then look outward at the present moment.  What is the next right thing you need to be doing.  It is always very helpful if there is something you can do with your hands.  When at home, get up and wash the dishes, etc.  Rinse and repeat as often as the voices or memories or flash backs come up.  That is the trick.  A dogged resolution to do it as many times as necessary.

A parent is simply someone or something that provides comfort, security, love, nourishment, and support to those who are left in their care. There are plenty of parents who don't actually parent. For instance our own Nparents, who actually treat their offspring like employees at a bustling business as opposed to growing lifeforms with needs of their own.   As for the ""miswired inside that things going normally just terrifies,"" I know that very well. Or at least I knew that very well. I had to personally visualize any parts of me that were dysfunctional and interact with them as though they were separate parts to my character altogether. Let's face it, something is off if you're going along just dandily and yet there always seems to be something dragging your spirits or holding you back. Ask those parts if they're ready to move on and explain to them how you're no longer in the environment that caused them to fear and suffer in the first place.   It took me a bit to convince myself that I didn't have to fear going out in public and meeting new people since all of the abusive pricks from my past life were gone, and they sure as hell weren't coming back. But what about new people? ANYONE could be out to hurt me!!!  Ah yes, and sometimes the wolves do appear as sheep! However my saving grace was recognizing that I'm stronger and more able to see the red flags now that I've played enough of their games. I more readily listen to my body and mind in order to gauge whether or not I'm picking up on anything suspicious. But more times than not, I can easily glide through a crowd without constantly worrying whether or not I'm going to get eaten alive. Just tell yourself everything will work out, even if it's not the way you intended it to in the first place.   No one can hurt you as they have in the past. You know the signs and can recognize the patterns. In fact you're probably so good now that you honestly wouldn't make for good sport because abusers don't like to expel too much energy in order to put another down. Why else would you think that children and elders get abused more so than adults? It's harder to treat someone like garbage if they're willing to fight back!   So give yourself pats on the back and tell yourself ""good job, x!"" whenever you do something you're proud of. Always remember to give yourself breaks because mistakes are okay. Why? The world never stops turning, even when we make mistakes or fall short of perfection. You're learning and growing, so give yourself the benefit of the doubt."

We read everything we could find and compared the content; we tried things and we made mistakes; we loved our children and they grew up sensible and confident and independent and are very cool people.     Parenting is about growth and learning, teaching self-discipline and working yourself out of a job.  It is realizing that your child goes through levels of development, and learning what those levels are so you can challenge them in ways that they are able to achieve, at each stage of development.   Obviously not what our Ns did.   It is about supporting the interests of your child in appropriate ways, and encouraging them to overcome their weaknesses.  It is about guiding them in their strengths, not by controlling them, but by helping them look farther and wider to see options that they may not have realized were available.  Parenting is watching and learning and rejoicing.  Parenting is knowing who your child is, their strengths and weaknesses, and seeing that they could become so much more, and letting them.

You predict that the future will be bleak, and so since you believe that, you act and think in ways that will make it come to pass. Then you get to say ""See, I told me it wouldn't work out, I knew I was worthless.""  I do it a lot.   It's a complicated issue, even though it sounds pretty simple. If you have a pile of work and you think ""too much, I'll never get this all done, might as well do nothing,"" odds are you will get a dismal amount done. If you correct yourself and reframe to ""There's a lot here, but I can get at least SOME of this done, let's see what's important, I can at least do two things,"" it's going to go a little bit better. The trick is that you have to say it and BELIEVE IT. The theory is that your emotions are generated by your automatic thoughts that you BELIEVE TO BE TRUE. Obviously as ACoNs, we have a lot of negative auto-thoughts, and we've been programmed to believe. By identifying the thoughts, and re-stating them, you can start to challenge your own pessimism."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3d813j,LionessSekhmet,7,Tue Jul 14 06:00:46 2015 UTC,"I feel you on so many points. The only thing that helped me was leaving the faith/church quietly without confronting my family about how my beiliefs differ so much from the ones they taught me.   It's not helping me deal with attraction exactly, but it helped me 100% reject all that woman-shaming bullshit and so when I am experiencing attraction (one way, both ways, reciprocated or not) I don't automatically think it's my fault and my problem to fix anymore."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d813j,_ism_,2,Tue Jul 14 13:26:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, leaving the church was absolutely essential for my sanity.  (I stopped believing at age 14, but had to play along for another 4 soul-destroying years before I could get away.)  Right now, I feel like I've consciously rejected all of those beliefs, but their ghosts still linger in my head, and sometimes they wake up and get noisy and cause some trouble."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d813j,starstough,6,Thu Jul 16 04:54:02 2015 UTC,"Oh wow.... well, it seems like I've finally come across someone who was raised nearly identically to me...  The way I deal with knowing someone is attracted to me varies slightly case by case, but the major thing was this:   I generally come off as a very caring person who listens very well and actually cares what others are saying. I am a support person in every sense of the word. That often does lead to people saying things like ""I've never felt so close to someone I just met!"". That immediately freaks me out, especially if I was honestly just trying to be polite. Like, oh crap... I've just done something horrible, I'm not able or willing to be close to this person, I just wanted them to feel heard...Or worse: I know what this person needs and I know how to fill that need and if I don't do it, I will feel like I've let them down...  The thing is... there are lots of different kinds of love. I've given myself permission to be loving in appropriate ways. I found out relatively recently that nearly every guy friend I've ever had was ""into"" me, but thought I was untouchable. This was a total shock to me. And it made me feel like utter SHIT because I thought I was causing them undue pain. But it wasn't like that. I wasn't leading anyone on. They just really enjoyed me. Over time I realized that it is rare for someone to be genuine, and the caring friendship kind of deep love doesn't come around often enough for people to not initially think it is the other kind of love automatically.   I don't think this post is making a ton of sense...I've been... lucky? in a way, in that I've been someone's girlfriend or fiance or wife for the majority of my adult life, and was cautious enough in my dealings with other guys that I never let on that there was ever a possibility of me either leaving my SO, or cheating (I have never and never will cheat.), so it was just a thing. All my guy friends adored me. All my guy friends would never think of taking things further or even suggesting it. Or maybe it is that I usually break contact completely with people who suggest they don't naturally see or respect that boundary?  All in all, I don't resent people that are attracted to me. I have had instances where I wished they'd have spoken up, gently, for one reason or another, but ultimately I am glad they didn't.   So... the most important thing I think is that you have to give yourself permission to be loving, appropriately, and know that it is okay to distance yourself from people that mistake caring for being lustful or dishonorable. Be aware of the tiny details of your mannerisms and do make sure that you leave no room for doubt in a reasonable person's mind. And never assume that another person's warm reception to your caring is actually a longing. It may just be that they are refreshed by the differences you display...   Ugh I hope that made some sense. I empathize with you fully."

Yeah. Reading through this and OP's and just thinking yeah... that me. It does get better, when I remind myself that I'm not responsible for other's emotions. I'm not, I can't control them, and honestly I shouldn't try to appease them as much as I do. It's not healthy for me. Embrace the chaos and friction that is normal human communication."

One of my goals in life is to leave the world a better place than I found it, and by having a positive impact on those around me, it's my way of fulfilling that goal. I like to think of it as putting the effects of my n-parent upbringing to a good use. ;)   Try to think of it this way, you may know what that person needs, but on a surface level, it's what all people need -- to feel heard and validated. So by hearing them and validating them, you've already fulfilled those needs. You don't need to feel obligated to take it any further (and quite likely, unless it's someone you're romantically involved with, they're not expecting you to take it any further, either)."

Like, when I'm attracted to somebody, I enjoy the feeling, without any assumption that anything will happen about it or any resentment when it doesn't.  It sounds like your background has involved a lot of interaction with the sub-group of people who expect to get what they want and hurt when they don't.

When I was little, my Ndad was a coke addict and spent all my Emom's money on drugs and hookers. We never had food because we had no money, and were homeless with alarming frequency.   By the time I was a teen, my Ndad had gotten (mostly) clean and had a really good office job. We had a house in the suburbs and everything. He strictly monitored our food and forbade us kids to eat without permission. I mean really - we were expected to call him at work and ask permission to eat an apple. If he came home and discovered the fridge was an apple short, there was hell to pay. We were also ""homeschooled"" (ie, isolated) so no one noticed when all three of kids lost weight. I was 15 and 130 lbs (size 6 ish) when this severe food monitoring started and a year later, I was 98 lbs.   When my parents divorced, I was 18 and my dad had called my college and convinced them to end my enrollment. Who knows how. So they came to my dorm and forced me to move out, and I had to move back in with my Ndad. He literally put locks on the cupboards, and only kept beef hot dogs in the fridge (I'm medically allergic to beef).   I was so glad to move out. Now I'm actually overweight because I just sorta went crazy when I moved out - I never had a healthy relationship with food so I didn't know how to be normal."

I had specifically not signed the family release because at that school, it included nurse visits, grades, financial aid, and dorm checks (they had a 10pm curfew for the women's dorm, and if you signed the release, they would notify your parents if you missed curfew.) But it was a Southern Baptist school and they deferred to fathers. I tried to appeal the decision and they refused. It was messed up.   I transferred to a different, nonreligious school (there was a semester + summer break in between, where I had to live with my father again) and it was a much better fit.

I was told by the leaders to bring it, but knew better than to ask my mom to buy candy for me. When I got to camp, there was no candy in my bag. Mom found it and took it. No clue what she did with it. I doubt she ate it all herself. I'm guessing she threw it away. Again, there was no way she'd let me have it. Once I got back she gave me a fake apology.

Once or twice though I became so desperate that I did drink that water. I had the same meal every single day. The worst part looking back, as a little kid, I actually got more food and drink when I was in Primary School then I ever did in High School (UK 11-16 education). Seriously, why was little kid me fed more then bigger kid me? I didn't eat breakfast, lunch was pitiful and dinner, I would eat a kids sized meal. My afternoon snack was usually a can of more off brand pop and after that I was very lucky if mum let me make toast or something for a snack if I finished off all my fruit. I was not allowed near her cakes or she would throw tantrums over not having anything to eat and being hungry when I was hungry all the time (stomach rumbling hungry that just turned into that empty feeling).   I think we too would have qualified for the free school meals. Mum didn't have a job until I was nearly 13 so I could have had school meals for free.   You can probably guess, I went from a fat kid, to a very underweight kid. I was very underweight and had bad eating habits when I left her house. What really sucks is that she used to bitch and moan at me over how much food I ate when I was so hungry all the time. If she had given me a full sized meal, maybe I wouldn't have raided all the fruit in the house. I wasn't stupid enough to touch her junk food or her bananas. When sorting through my old room at one point, I found a stash of old cake bars and stuff. I guess I started hoarding food. I don't remember doing it but I must have done.   I do remember when I was <10 mum used to force feed me carrots every single meal. They were always overcooked and tasted like crap. I hated carrots to the point were I felt so sick when I ate them I was going to throw up. I started refusing to even go to the table to eat, I started feeling sick before meals because of the anxiety I felt about those damn carrots. I begged my mum for other veg, I really liked peas and asked her for them, but she refused to buy them for me. We only got them at Christmas if I was lucky. I do remember her screaming at me to eat my food when I was full and only carrots remained. Even if I had left most of my food for whatever reason, she used to scream at me to eat the carrots. I wasn't being a stubborn kid, well I guess I was, but I still can't stand the damn things. I'll eat them, but only if I can cover them in stuff to mask the taste.   Oh yeah, mum also told me I was a picky eater growing up and would get mad when I didn't like the food she had given me. Turns out she was just telling me that as an excuse not to eat out anywhere. Her cooking sucked as well. Who wants to eat cheap cardboard chicken every night, or overcooked veg?"

I then loaded the cart with doubles of some items and started loading the bags while she paid the bill. She then shoved the bill in my face and mockingly jabbed ""I've NEVER spent this much here!

A couple years later she kind of gave up and stopped buying food as often. The pantry would have like old potatos, cereal, and sprinkles total. I'd never have breakfast, pick at my school lunch, and usually just cook an entire thing of mac and cheese for the day. I was like 11 when this was happening.

Your experience has obviously fundamentally changed you and your brother, but you've learned a lot about life and matured in ways other people your age haven't.  This gives you a gift some people never get: increased empathy, and the ability to question yourself and figure out who you really are.  Sounds like you can be a rock for your brother, and let him know that how he is is fine, and nobody should have to eat any fucking food if they don't want to.

My parents didn't keep food from me directly, but it was a really big deal that we eat dinner ""like a family"" at night. If my dad caught me snacking/ruining my appetite, I was risking a major scene. I usually ate as little as possible at dinner in order to be finished quicker, and (if I could get away with it) ended up sneaking food later, when my parents were asleep.   In retrospect, this is probably why I have such a hard time gauging my own hunger--growing up, it wasn't about when I was hungry, it was about when I could access food safely, which usually led to me going hungry and eventually binging. It's an issue I'm still working on."

Looking back, I think my school lunches in Primary School were the result of mum trying to make herself look good. Give the kid a sandwich, packet of crisps, a piece of fruit, a cake bar and a nice drink of milkshake or juice. When I got into High School (UK 11-16 education), my food became that one sandwich. On it, a piece of wafer thin chicken), my drink, one of these kiddie sized bottles of off brand pop that didn't do anything to help my thirst. I also didn't eat breakfast.   The whole food thing was ridiculous looking back. I ended up very underweight and it didn't help that I was training nearly every night for a few hours after school (I also walked to school and back which was a few miles). Mum used to eat more then me every day, she is round and short, I was tall and ultra skinny, yet I ate far less then her and she would bitch about how much I cost her. Me in my male hand me down clothes (I'm female) and the little food I ate. We weren't that poor when I was a teenager, mum was always going out, buying me toys, games, DVDs etc. She also refused to buy me any of my martial art uniforms. My first gi was far too small, it had been my uncles as a kid, then my smaller cousins, then mine. It was embarrassing. Took me a long time of pestering to get a new one for my birthday (it was about £20, we could easily afford it). She refused outright to get me my Taekwondo stuff so I could grade. My instructor thought I was being funny with him and didn't believe that my mum was refusing to buy me a Dobok. Eventually one of the senior members took pity on me and gave me his old worn out uniform. I paid for my insurance and grading with leftover car boot sale money mum didn't know I had. I got a lift to the grading with other club members because mum just hated it. She put up with my Karate but she had it in for me doing Taekwondo, even though I loved both.

So there was rarely anything in the fridge or pantry.  From 13-17, I would get $10 a week for all my meals. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Around 15, I figured out how to beat this system. I would save up the money for about a month, then sneak out at 12am and have a friend take me to walmart, buy as much cheap food as I could, and hide it.

LifeAfterNarcissism,3d70le,MuffinFuhrer,2,Tue Jul 14 02:03:50 2015 UTC,"This doesn't have a spiritual twist to it, but this message can resonate with anyone in the world.   You honestly cannot tend to the needs of others until your take care of your own.  Here's an extreme example: Let's say a parent has children and wants to give to their children wholeheartedly in order to provide them with the most nurturing and comforting environment imaginable. This can be done, but only if the parent takes care of their own health. I.e. if the parent is stressed from work, isn't getting adequate sleep, has little to no social support, doesn't eat regularly, and doesn't even do anything pleasurable to get a little R & R in general, they would burnout pretty quickly. Anyone would. Can you imagine taking care of another life if you lacked the energy, time, motivation, incentive, etc. to provide the care in question? Better yet, could you? Probably not but once again anyone would have issues doing so. That doesn't make you a bad person (sinful), but it simply means you need to take care of yourself before you take care of others.   We honestly don't owe anyone or anything shit in this system we call reality. Why? Because at any moment the reality we know to be true can completely alter its tune and drumbeat. I.e. life is in a constant state of motion. But reality is also comprised of a series of relationships, and it's wonderful to be able to connect with another who reciprocates the love and care you are willing to provide them.  For instance your body is made of 70 trillion cells that all work together to ensure you can roll out of bed everyday in order for you to knock out your responsibilities. If they didn't work together, you'd have more difficulty doing so. Likewise if you didn't care for your body, it would be more difficult to roll out of bed. Relationships are great when they work congruently, but they suck when things don't line up (i.e. narcissism, psychopathy, etc. in relation to individuals who have a conscious). There's no need to beat yourself up for needing or even wanting to take care of yourself. Is it selfish? If you want to look at it that way, but it's necessary regardless of which way you look at it.   Treat yourself because you've earned it."

One type that's been very helpful to me is called Metta or Loving Kindness meditation. I used to think of compassion as something that we give freely to others, and thought I was really good at it. But I had given compassion so freely to every person but one: myself. Why was I not worthy of the same care I gave others?  There's a quote attributed to the Buddha (but is probably not from him) which goes something like:  You yourself, as much as anyone else in the entire universe, deserve your own love and compassion.  I think of these words when I am overextending myself, and listen to this guided Loving Kindness meditation recording often, to help me remember to have compassion for myself.  The truth is, you can't have real love and compassion for others, if you can't give it to yourself. Without it, you are most likely only acting out of obligation, or fear, or guilt. Cultivating true love and compassion for yourself is the only way to learn how to give it to others."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d6kni,Annme319,15,Mon Jul 13 22:38:34 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, this is a place, and you are welcome here.   This doesn't sound good! I'm so sorry. Poor you. I'd totally hate that to happen to me.  Psyching yourself up to go to therapy is hard enough, you have to prepare to be vulnerable... Only to be told, sorry, wrong place, wrong time. I'd  absolutely hate that.  I d be REALLY upset too if this happened to me.   In my humble opinion, from what you've said Ive got my reservations  about this therapist, but my instinct would be to give her one more chance. You could send a short, polite but assertive email to explain your sitter and travel arrangements and that it is very important that you keep your appointments, and  if for some reason they need to reschedule that it is very important they contact you. If they respond badly to this, it is NOT your fault. You'd just be making a completely reasonable request.  If they react badly to this reasonable request I t is THEIR issue.   That said. I know how HARD being assertive is when you are feeling vulnerable and hurt like this. If you just wanted to walk away and try another therapist you have every right to do so.  The therapist that you used to see may not have responded for lots of reasons. She may be really busy, she may have personal/family problems, she may not be practising anymore, she may have accidentally deleted your message, she may yet respond, she may have just forgotten to get back to you. People are fallible and make mistakes, therapists included. I'd encourage you to try not to take it personally.   You had a nasty shock today. Poor you, take good care of yourself."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d6kni,PrancerPrancer,6,Mon Jul 13 23:28:46 2015 UTC,"That happens a lot in my area (San Francisco). It is really discouraging, and infuriating since this is not professional behavior. Complain to them, report them to whatever licensing board they are subject to, and keep looking for a professional who acts appropriately.  Maybe try the higher licensed ones (doctorate first, then masters, not the ones who are just licensed without a degree). I don't know what the answer is."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d6kni,OneRedSent,5,Mon Jul 13 23:27:09 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I'm so sorry that happened to you.  I had a similar experience.  The first time that I finally worked up my nerve to try therapy, I went so far as to schedule a phone call with a woman, but then she ""forgot"" about it and didn't actually call.  To be honest it triggered all of my issues in a really bad way, and worsened my depression.  It wasn't until like 2 years later that I worked up the nerve to try therapy again.  That kind of stuff can really be harmful to people.  I totally understand how you are feeling, and I think it's completely justified.  Hopefully you will be able to deal with it better than I did back then.  Therapists vary widely in quality, but there are good ones out there, and I hope you manage to find one.  One more thing, if you live far away and/or have childcare issues, have you thought about looking for people who will do therapy over video chat?  That could be more convenient for you (and also give access to a wider range of therapists).  Just an idea if you decide you want to look for someone else."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d6kni,LionessSekhmet,4,Tue Jul 14 00:33:21 2015 UTC,"I'm saddened by how common this is.   I had the same exact problem finding someone who is taking new patients and takes my insurance. I'd call five (more like seven) different therapists only for them to tell me they're not available--or only available once every few months.   I finally got a therapist who'd see me, but did not take my insurance. She ate toast the whole time I was talking to her. It was goofy. Not horrible, but goofy. Also, the session was not helpful at all.   I wonder why this is so common?   Anyway, no wonder you are discouraged. It's very discouraging. It takes a LOT of perseverance, and time, and more time.   Perhaps try again with someone else, someone who acts like they value your time. I know, try YET AGAIN, but it might be worth it."

It's highly frustrating to see mistakes of any kind when you've been under a narcissistic boot for long enough, and it's even more infuriating to meet resistance when you're sincerely trying to change your life.  Many blessings to you, and I wish you the best in finding a therapist who is able and willing to provide you with the most beneficial service to you. You deserve to be happy!!!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d6kni,MuffinFuhrer,3,Tue Jul 14 00:22:21 2015 UTC,"Finding a good therapist is very, very hard, with a lot of setbacks.  Unfortunately, this experience you share is common (not the specifics, but the problems in general). Many people do not call back, many people are overloaded, many people are busy, and many people are semi-competent, and many people are simply not the people you really need at this time.  I would encourage you to keep looking. I would encourage you to create a list longer than 5 people.  Have you checked out:  https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/?utm_source=PT_Psych_Today&utm_medium=House_Link&utm_campaign=PT_TopNavF_Therapist  This is psychology today's ""Find a Therapist"" list. You may have already checked it out.  You may still need to drive far, but there list is long, extensive, and detailed. (for the U.S.).  You can search for specialties, such as childhood trauma, PTSD, child abuse, and other things such as type of therapy, CBT, Psychodynamics, EMDR, etc… and even such things as religious preference, gender, age, etc…  I would make a longer list than 5; try to think if there is anything on your list of qualifications that can be more flexible.  Some qualifications are more personally important than others, most of the time.  That would be my advice, but I would not give up.  It is difficult to find a good fit for anything, especially something as personal as this."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d6kni,wheneverrichardcory,2,Tue Jul 14 11:08:53 2015 UTC,The options are only limited because of insurance. So many providers don't take mine. I was hoping to avoid paying 100% out of pocket but I may have to bite the bullet on that.
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d6kni,wheneverrichardcory,2,Tue Jul 14 11:29:27 2015 UTC,"On that website, you can search people who work on a ""sliding scale.""  Many therapists will try to work with people who have to pay directly, and lower the costs of sessions."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3d5n7z,BakedBeauty,3,Mon Jul 13 18:41:25 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling awfully down, and in more ways than one. Although the first question that comes to mind is whether or not you've had dreams like the one you described in your past? I'm not sure whether or not you get anything of worth or value from the images and/or messages your dreams present to you, but dreams can show you potential realities that are either just on the horizon (to prepare us essentially) - or they can also show us what we've been neglecting.   For the last possibility, I am in no way suggesting that you've neglected the people you thought were friends with. However I am suggesting that you have been neglecting your need to socialize and develop relations with people, places, and things around you. That doesn't make you an awful person because you more than likely did that in order to protect yourself from toxic people. If you've been abused or neglected, it's almost natural to shut the rest of the world out because ""everything is out to put me down, so I'll shut everything out to be safe."" It's an effective defense mechanism for a time, but eventually you will need to leave that altogether in order to continue growing and developing. It can be hard and frightening at first, but it will be worth it because we all require some degree of recognition. We all want to feel valued and wanted in this world.   Which brings me to the first suggestion. It sounds like you've made lots of progress and you're fearful that you're starting to ""relapse."" Fear not because it sounds like you're at a new stage in your life - aka ready to tackle more so you can continue your journey to heal and become the BEST you possible. It sounds like the next steps for you will require you to begin branching out and networking.   I'm at that point myself because I've lived in isolation for a number of years. I basically spent all of my time working or cooped up in my apartment, and I rarely made eye contact nor spoke to anyone who came near me. Although now I started hanging out with strangers through an app called ""Meet Up,"" which shows groups of people who have certain interests (vegetarians and hikers for me) that meet up for scheduled outings. I've gone on two outings so far (one sushi restaurant and one trail), and the experiences were great! You might want to look into something similar for your community, or even discuss it with your therapist to get ideas flowing.   You're not failing. You are succeeding! In fact you're doing so well that you're making it to another level altogether. You have bright days ahead, my friend. But thank you for posting your concerns. You're not alone :)"
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d5n7z,MuffinFuhrer,2,Mon Jul 13 19:31:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words. Ive always been a dreamer. I get a lot of information from them. I love to analyze them, and sometimes I log them. Sometimes its hard to see what they really mean, so getting another perspective is helpful. I am still very anxious about socializing. I'm still not over it. I've had a lot of bad things happen, one after the other and it's terrifying honestly. I'm very sensitive. I take things the wrong way. I need a lot of work. But yes this is a new chapter for me, a scary one."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d5n7z,MuffinFuhrer,2,Tue Jul 14 12:39:08 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with ya! I've been involved with a lot of awful circumstances for most of my life, and it's been difficult to trust anyone let alone trust myself to avoid bad situations and people. One comforting notion to keep in the back of your mind is that you'll know what seems off in a relationship before you get too entrenched. The more you heal, the harder you'll be to break down or be misled. Learn to trust yourself first and then you'll do just fine!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d5n7z,PrancerPrancer,2,Tue Jul 14 13:04:49 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry that this dream upset you. The pain it caused you is palpable in what you wrote, and my heart goes out to you.  One way you could look at it would be as a metaphor for how you are feeling about yourself, and how hard you have worked in therapy.   I've found myself that it is much harder to socialize and make friends when I'm struggling with my own emotional problems and internal conflicts.   Your dream may express a feeling that you are healing some of your traumas, and making friends with yourself. Maybe the friends in your dream are the different parts of yourself that are learning to relate to each other and get on, and have a little fun - rather than being in conflict and confusion.  This sounds like it could be a really optimistic dream in some ways. Learning to be friends with ourselves is the first step to building healthy friendships with others, IMHO. That said, I can understand that the dream was quite a shock, and why you found it so upsetting. I'm really sorry about that. I hope you can see the hope in the dream, and feel proud of all you have achieved in therapy so far.   sending you good wishes."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3d34gy,LindyLovesLipstick,7,Mon Jul 13 03:35:24 2015 UTC,"Accept your anger and resentment. The more you fight to not be angry, the more you oppress those natural healthy emotions.   Accepting your feelings, all your feelings, even the ones you might not feel comfortable with, are part of the healing process - In my opinion.  Over time you move through your emotions, you come through the anger. Anger is one stage of grief. Allow yourself to feel your anger and resentment and you will allow yourself to move through the stages of grief towards healing. You won't be angry forever, just a while. And then you'll move into the next stage of your healing.  (Just don't allow your rage to cause hurt to others or to yourself. Jogging, punching a pillow, tearing paper or cardboard, shouting or yelling into a pillow, are safe ways to express your legitimate and healthy rage.)  Ps. In my experience,  and opinion, some of the most powerful healing for me has come from acceptance. It's paradoxical. But it has happened time and again for me."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3d34gy,Annme319,7,Tue Jul 14 10:48:01 2015 UTC,Would you feel the need to forgive a snake if it behaved like the snake it was and bit you when you got too close? Or would that be a situation where forgiveness wasn't necessary because snake did what snake does?  Narcs are like snakes. And narcs do what narcs do. It isn't a situation where forgiveness as a concept can be applied.  You can come to a place of peace by forgiving yourself for continuing to expect the snake to behave like a *mother. You can forgive yourself for believing the lies your narc told you about yourself. The narc doesn't deserve or require forgiveness because it wasn't doing anything that was outside of the realm of narcissism. It was wearing a mom suit but it was acting like a snake.
LifeAfterNarcissism,3d34gy,starstough,6,Mon Jul 13 14:49:07 2015 UTC,"I think there's a lot of different answers to this question, and I agree with /u/Celera314 that you should be clear in your own mind what you mean by ""forgive.""  I believe that I am required to forgive, but that forgiveness definitely does not mean signing up for more abuse, so I had to figure out what forgiveness would look like along the way.  One thing that's good to remember is that you might succeed in forgiving but never get ""credit"" for it from other people.  If you forgive at the same time as you go NC to protect yourself, others who don't understand Ns or the nature of abuse may not call that ""forgiving.""  They will ask, ""Why can't you forgive?""  It does not mean that you have not forgiven.  They. Just. Don't. Get. It.  Remember that you forgive for you, not for anyone else.  A big step forward in forgiveness came for me when I decided to ""go with"" the theory that NDad was an N and was never going to change or (crucially) tolerate even the slightest boundary I might set around myself or my children.  And I was not going to be around someone with no boundaries.  For me, the instant that marked the biggest step towards forgiveness was the same instant in which I accepted that indefinite NC was the right way to relate to him.  Because ""he cannot change"" is the exact same concept that    (a) means it is pointless and dangerous to interact with him and (b) means that I can have pity on him, instead of anger, because of the poverty that he lives in.  He may drive a Porsche and live in a big house, eat in the finest restaurants and enjoy the adulation of his colleagues, but he is the poorest man I have ever met.   So, at least for me, when I really accepted NDad for what he is, and accepted that it is a sad situation and there is no happy ending, because that happens sometimes, I think I really began to forgive.  There is some grief, but mostly pity."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3d34gy,Celera314,7,Mon Jul 13 18:59:25 2015 UTC,"I think the first step is to be clear in your own mind what you mean by ""forgive.""  I can tell you only what it meant for me.  When I think of my mother, I feel sad as well as angry, because I know that she lived a miserable life.  Much of that misery was her own fault, but still, it was a narrow and bitter existence.  She's dead now, and I hope there is some sort of learning or enlightenment or healing in the next life for her.  But, I was almost completely NC for decades.  She never knew my sons, and I would never have let her near them when they were children.  Not because I was angry with her, but because it would be foolish to expose them to her.   Just like I wouldn't let them play with a cobra.  The last time I contacted my mother, I had little hope that she would have changed, and indeed, she had not changed.  She was still angry with me, still hateful, still felt that by growing up and having my own life I had betrayed her.  I did reach out, though, because I was at a point where I finally knew I didn't have to be afraid of her.  She didn't want to stay in touch with me, though, and it was a relief.  It helped a lot that, as my life went on, things went reasonably well.  At 45, I had two great kids, a decent career, more money than anything I would have inherited from her (she loved to hold money over our heads) and generally a good life.  The damage she did to me was significant and lasting, but I was not ruined, and many good things have happened.    This is a long process.  It may take many years, and it takes some mental self-discipline.  Prayer or meditation also help.  Don't expect healing to come over night.  And don't forget that you can stop being angry and resentful, but that doesn't mean she is safe to be around, or that you can expect her to change.  Like a lion or a cobra, it is in her nature to harm you.  You don't have to be angry with the snake for fulfilling its instincts, but you wouldn't play with it either."

I'm not sure where the mathematical equation of 'if I forgive the anger will go away' comes from.  There seems to be an idea that there is a magic wand and if you just 'feel a forgiveness feeling' then your pain will go away. I really don't know where this comes from or why it has been accepted into the cultural canon.   It seems like a theory that hasn't actually been universally proven. Just my experience, though.   I haven't forgiven my mom, I never will. And I'm really fine with that. Any anger I have is entirely justified, and as I acknowledge that her abuse wasn't my fault, that really helps. I have zero desire to forgive her, I only want to stay away from her so she never hurts me again, and protect myself from the memories of her abuse.  Full disclosure, though, I'm NC with my mom.   This 'forgiveness' stuff seems like a weird meme that was created by Oprah and somehow got accepted as gospel.    I'm not sure who decided that 'forgiveness is for you' is actually something that is true or legitimate.   I don't forgive the ex who kidnapped me and held me hostage. But I don't think of him much anymore, either.  Do I forgive my dad for how he acted when he was active in his addiction. Yep. I do. You know why? Because he doesn't act that way anymore and he's made it up to me by being reliable, caring and trustworthy.   You don't have to forgive. It's not necessarily a magic wand like so many people say that it is."

Forgiveness is what I do, for my own healing.    Forgiveness doesn't erase the consequences of my N's actions.  Reconciliation would be possible only if my N were willing to have remorse for the abuse and crimes she has committed, and to change enough to respect my new boundaries.  My N's view of forgiveness is that it is reconciliation with no changes and no accountability, a going back to the old relationship where she controls and I comply.  Ha."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3d0af5,Sigmund_Six,2,Mon Jul 13 17:51:27 2015 UTC,"Wow! This is such an interesting article, thank you for sharing it. I've heard this idea referenced before, but had never seen it laid out.    Trauma bonds are able to form only because human beings have a biological need to form attachments with others. In times of stress and danger, people have a greater need to be cared for and attach to others....Any attachment is better than no attachment, a fact that is evidenced by the reality of relationships that are otherwise incomprehensible.    I grew up in an abusive environment, and continue to struggle with my feelings about it. It would be much easier if I could hate my parents, I think. I feel a little relieved knowing there's a scientific explanation for it.    Further, women are particularly susceptible to bonding to those who traumatize them. Women have their very own mixed blessing in the form of oxytocin. Oxytocin is referred to as the bonding hormone and is the chemical that starts the birth process...While oxytocin is a great idea for childbirth, it's a liability for any abuse victim. If someone is violent to a woman, oxytocin is released and she will be less likely to have a consolidated memory of the abuse and she is very likely going to bond to her abuser.   This is fascinating to me. As a woman who was predominantly abused by her father, this probably explains a lot of those conflicted feelings I have about staying in contact with him. It may also explain why so many women struggle to leave their abusers in general.  Again, this is a  really intriguing read.

And the sad thing is, people shouldn't have to 'keep score' of how many bad things someone has done to them.  A lot of ACoNs are trained and required to do that as children, so they carry it into adulthood.  Like there is some kind of acceptable level of abuse, and the abuser is allowed to abuse them as long as it's not 'too much abuse' or the abuse is 'mathematically allowed.'

So now, every time the shame comes up, I imagine myself taking a little box out of the sack, and I look at it, say ""this isn't mine,"" then drop it wherever I am. And the sack gets a little lighter.

LifeAfterNarcissism,3cyzv2,wildernessmap,2,Sun Jul 12 02:57:21 2015 UTC,"Yes I found it totally overwhelming for, well, pretty much my whole life. A lot  of the time Id be okay, until something triggered my shame, and then I'd be totally overwhelmed, sometimes for days at a time. It's so hard to function and keep going with life when you are carrying all that baggage for other people. I'd have days I could barely get out of bed - and then I just spent all day looking forward to being able to go back to bed. I actually feel like those days of being totally overwhelmed are going to be much rarer from now on. (Though I fully expect to get triggered every now and then even still.

LifeAfterNarcissism,3cyzv2,MuffinFuhrer,6,Sun Jul 12 18:17:26 2015 UTC,"Visualizing parts of you is a great way to sort out what doesn't quite fit in how you see yourself, and this can be both a frightening and calming experience once you get to the root of the issue at hand. Unfortunately the west typically frowns on such things as ""imaginary"" or ""crazy,"" even though the process of healing that emerges from such experiences can be wholly beneficial and streamlined. Aka the proof is in the pudding.  For me personally I attempted a similar technique of visualizing my heart as though it were a separate consciousness altogether, and I was completely blown away by what I experienced and saw. I entered a deep meditative state while blindfolded and visualized my heart. I witnessed a king sitting upon a throne, though he was crying in agony and anguishing in pain. I reached out to touch him to provide comfort and he screamed at me to back away. He blamed me for everything since I was the one who closed myself to him as a result from denying myself love since I never received love from those who were responsible for me. I denied my need for touch, warmth, socialization, and opportunities to develop relationships for years, so he explained that he didn't trust me to help provide comfort in any capacity.   I left and felt utterly hopeless, but I soon noticed that I REALLY began to shy away from people as I fought to hold tears back in public areas (the best place to have emotional breakdowns...kidding). All of a sudden I began seeing visions of the king crying, shaking, convulsing, and yelling at me continuously as I further distanced myself from the others as I tried my hardest to contain everything.   I eventually sat with the king when I was in another meditative state and offered him a box of tissues. He looked surprised but thankful, and asked what my intentions were. I then told him I was sorry for treating him as I had, though I wanted to develop a relationship with him so we could both move on from the issues that rattled our past. I explained that I wanted to comfort his distress because I wanted to love him - I did not want to be heartbroken...  After that act of kindness he began trusting me more and more to the point that my thought patterns even changed, as well as the manner in which I felt my emotions. He then began to look increasingly strong and ""like royalty"" as opposed to a groveling man who has lost everything and everyone in his life.   I was abused and neglected for 23 years of my life because I grew up in a dysfunctional and toxic environment where my depressed alcoholic father and Nmom failed to provide me with comfort, security, nourishment, and love. So it was inevitable that I closed myself off to my feelings because numbing the pain helped me survive. But once again, I honestly didn't want to be heartbroken. For that may well have led to me having a heart attack further down the line. Obviously this is not something I want, nor should anyone who values their life.   Thank you for sharing your experience, and you're not alone!"

Metaphors and visualization as healing tools can be really powerful, and I get the impression they are  underused/undervalued in typical western mainstream helping practices.   A few years ago I did some work with a non-mainstream healer. (I was at my wits end, counseling wasn't helping much, I felt like I was going crazy, and I figured I'd try something different.)  The experience you described was in some ways quite similar to what I experienced, although instead of a king on a throne, mine was a ragged, dirty child locked up in a cell who refused to speak to me because she didn't trust me. Part of the healing was freeing this child, caring for her, and making a new 'contract' with myself about how I was going to treat the child from then onwards. Making the new contract was a very powerful turning point for me. It kind of kickstarted me out of a very difficult, painful, emotional state and into something a little healthier and a little more at peace."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3cyzv2,Rysona,2,Sun Jul 12 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"Bad-ass! Thanks for sharing that because I also know what it's like to basically throw in the towel and reach out to non-mainstream methods for healing. MAGIC...shit works, but certainly not for everyone. I also enjoyed your little bit regarding Jung's shadow because it was spot on. What we suppress and leave in the dark will manifest in some way or another, and more than likely it'll be in an unpleasant manner. Why? Because nothing wants to be neglected or discarded, no matter how ugly or malformed we perceive it to be. After all look how we turned out from our own personal neglect and abuse...everything wants to be loved and accepted. Period, end of story.

It makes me think of how I always wanted to shake my Ndad and tell him, ""you're a person, like everyone else"" because he fought that idea so hard and was so horrified by the idea.  But he successfully (for a while) convinced me to be ashamed because of things that are just part of being a person like everyone else -- like you say, "" being vulnerable, weak, fallible, making mistakes, and having needs.""  I don't have to actually take on shame for those things because I don't agree that there's anything wrong with those things.  I love the idea of visualizing it.  This is so right on!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,3cyzv2,OnTheBrink401,2,Sun Jul 12 11:59:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you!   In a way it is strange how I just didn't question my shame before - didn't question what I was ashamed of. I suppose it is because shame is INCREDIBLY painful, so it is something we all want to avoid.  I think my therapist has done a really good job of helping me to build up enough emotional stability and resilience, and coping strategies and a good support network so that I felt strong enough to face the shame and endure the pain of it.   The paradoxical thing I found (at least personally for me) is that fighting against the shame, and trying to avoid feeling it, was actually much more painful than facing the shame and opening up and accepting it. In accepting it, it's like it stopped being shame anymore.   Kinda like the Wizard of Oz - he's a big terrifying booming voice and a scary disembodied head, but if you draw back the curtain there's just a little frightened man at the controls.   Yes I know what you mean about Ns not wanting to accept they are regular people like everyone else!  Reminds me of a long conversation/argument with my E+SchizDad about what perfection was - I explained my opinion that no person could ever be perfect, and he wholeheartedly and forcefully disagreed.

But anyhow it's just sad that people give more care to their own personal fake drama stories than asking what it really is that a person is trying to do, or caring at all about others in general....  This is why if someone does something small you think is personal, like cutting you off in traffic or saying your name wrong, or ignoring you, or some kind of gossip is said (you think you overhear) don't jump down a rabbit hole of hatred and character damnation. You don't know what a person is going through and the world is FULL of these kinds of ""little cuts"" but are they cuts or are you choosing to look at it that way?

I'm not a proponent of the 'forgiveness is a gift you give yourself' stuff. My mother asked for forgiveness so many times and feasted on it and then betrayed me yet again. I don't quite understand this forgiveness fetish. I think you should allow yourself the time to express how you feel, and fully accept that they are in fact no longer in your life.  I had to actually give up the fantasy that she would ever be better. I had to actually let go the idea that I would ever have a mother. And I had to promise myself I would never let anyone trick me into being near her again. But that's just me.   You've only been NC for a few months.  I have no idea how long the memories and voices will last, but for me it's an ongoing thing. But it has gotten better with time, I can assure you of that.   Here's how I describe it. Going NC is like detoxing, for lack of a better word. There is still a LOT of shit and toxicity built up in your psyche and system that will have to be 'metabolized' out. Like sobering up or getting built up medication out of your system.  I have not taken the therapy route. Some people do, and I think for a lot of people it really helps 'clean' things out.  It's okay to give yourself time.   It's okay not to forgive, either. I haven't forgiven my Nmom and I never will, and that's alright with me. :)   I've been NC for 2 years, and I'm still surprised at all the shit and memories that come up, but it is getting better.    My advice, from someone who is recovering, with 2 years of no contact - Feel what you want to feel, don't let anyone tell you your feelings are wrong. And don't let anyone tell you you have to feel something 'different.'"

I believe that forgiveness, if it comes, is one possible result of healing, but not the cause of that healing.  I think forgiveness is neither necessary nor sufficient for healing.    Feel what you want to feel, don't let anyone tell you your feelings are wrong. And don't let anyone tell you you have to feel something 'different.'   Thank you. It's just sucky, because it's been so many months and all I am is sad and miserable.  I even don't have any motivation to do the things that bring me joy - for one, because I don't even know what brings me joy anymore, but also because I feel like doing things is pressure, which my abusers put a lot on me to try to force me to achieve despite their abuse.    Thanks for your comment."

I 100% recognize this. And this might be why you feel that being sad and miserable is in fact, wrong, when actuallly, feeling sad and miserable is totally appropriate.  One of the reasons my childhood and adolescent depression was so infuriating for my mother is because it was another 'failure' ""you should be happy! you have to be happy now because I want you to be happy now!""   Sadness is your right. It's okay to feel down, it's okay to not feel joy right now.    This stupid 'achievement' shit that narcs are obsessed with, often means that they think that even feelings are a failure - if those feelings aren't approved of by them, and done in the ""right way.""  Feel whatever you want to feel. And if you aren't feeling 'motivation' to do things that bring you joy, then that's fine. Life isn't a commercial for hiking boots and tooth paste.  We don't have to put on a performance of 'achievement' and 'look how joyful I am' all the dad gum time.    It took me a long time to feel happy after I was at my lowest point. But I treated my emotional state the same way I treat my physical body. Healing takes TIME. Imagine if someone said 'that leg should be healed by now, you should be dancing and playing soccer by now!'  Illnesses ravage the body, injury takes time and care to heal. Your emotions and mental health are the same, I think."

I basically took her toy away from her, because she fucking broke it too many times. ""YOU HAVE OTHER TOYS, YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS ONE ANYMORE.""

LifeAfterNarcissism,3ctq51,starstough,5,Sat Jul 11 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"Persist in choosing life.  Find what gives you joy and spend time in it.  That sounds so poetic, but it is anything but.  Find the wholesome activities that so engage you when your doing them that you forget yourself.  Try to spend most of your free time in those activities, and most of this will slowly mend itself while you do so.   Make friends with those who share your joy.  In my youth the joy was found in martial arts, yoga, and running.  I joined schools for the first two, and a running club for the latter.  In my 30s and 40s I found the joy giving enormous amounts of time to charities that helped get homeless teens off the street.  I also got involved volunteering to halfway homes for minors coming out of jail, etc.  Funny enough, in my white haired years I have torn off into online gaming with my grandkids, and other old foggies like me.  The more mundane the activity the better.  It just has to be wholesome or harmless.  This is the perfect place to make friends because narcissists hate joy, and won't be caught dead persisting in any kind of innocuous activity or charity.  So by going this route you are 70% there to locking out the pathological personalities.   Let the friendships spread from with those who share your joy.  You will eventually find a romantic partner through your friends (if you don't already have one).  At least most folks do.  Joy is the key.  Find the wellspring of joy in your life, spend your hours in it, and the voices in your head will go silent over time.  Your emotions will mend themselves, and you will be spending your time in wholesome affairs as you mend."

You suffered the abuse, and came out for the better.  If anything, NParents are to be pitied. They will never know the happiness that comes from love, whether that be platonic or not. Their happiness is fleeting, and assisted by food, drug or addiction.  I realized that my NBirthGiver was really pitiful... She's never had a successful relationship, she lives alone, and fakes that her life is interesting. She uses drugs as a crutch for her happiness.  She'll never understand the joy when a new friend confesses their enjoyment of her company.  She'll never understand the beautiful feeling of trust when someone comes to you crying or upset, and you're able to comfort them with your presence.  She'll never understand the contentedness of just sitting in silence with a friend or SO, and just enjoying their company.  She'll never understand the feeling of strength, when you realize you've been through hell and back a hundred times, and you still stand strong on your feet. (Or assisted, but that's okay too! You still make it, you little badass.)  Narcissists will never understand the beauty of companionship, and that makes me feel so bad for them.

You might pick that shoe to wear based on it's looks or a specific utility it has, but the shoe itself isn't... bad, right?   Think about what you know for sure is true about yourself. Ns lie. They lie about all sorts of things. Sometimes, Ndad would say things that were so completely untrue that I almost thought there was no way he was actually speaking to me.

LifeAfterNarcissism,3cs2wm,3RBN6349,19,Fri Jul 10 09:04:50 2015 UTC,"This may sound harsh, but I've been where you are right now, and this is the tough love I had to show myself in order to stop feeling like I have to take care of my abusive mother.   If your mother was mentally or intellectually incapable of caring for a child, she shouldn't have had one.   Making a child believe that they must care for an adult - especially when the child himself was neglected - that is child abuse.   My mother used the 'oh, I'm sick' when it was convenient for her. She had depression, yeah, but children don't care for adults with depression. That's not the way it works. Children receive care, they don't provide it. And adult survivors of child abuse are still susceptible to being abused by the parent. It doesn't stop just because you're taller.   When children are in the care of someone who is physically and mentally not able to care for them - then the child is removed from that environment. No child in the world is expected to provide care for an incompetent parent.   This ridiculous idea that we must care for them is part of the abuse.  We have been conditioned to think that we, as the children, are actually the parents. It's a lie. Children do not care for parents.   And this illness excuse? I think people fundamentally misunderstand what an illness is, and that it does not absolve people from the consequences of their behavior. The word illness isn't a carte blanche.  Only a small fraction of the ill people in the world are 'not responsible' for their actions. People with schizophrenia, people who hallucinate, people who exist in a world where they truly have no idea that the person they are hitting with a hammer isn't an assassin or a lion, but is a child in the school next to their house.   Not guilty by reason of insanity doesn't translate into ""I have an 'illness' so I can do whatever I want.""   Many famous murderers, for example, have some kind of personality or mental disorder, and they're paying for their crimes.   They thought they could get away with their bad actions because they thought they were smarter or more deserving than everyone else.  One of the major changes that happened when I was realizing the extent of my mom's abuse was when I said, out loud. ""I can't be her mother.""  Then, I changed it to ""I'm Not Her Mother.""  You will never be responsible for raising your mother. She was responsible for raising you. A sense of entitlement isn't an excuse for mistreating a child.   Illness is not an excuse for child abuse. This ""oh, it's an illness"" is a pop-psychology cop out.  It doesn't hold up in court, either.  Plenty of people with illnesses are held accountable for their crimes. Only a miniscule fraction of the criminals in this world are truly unable to control themselves.  You are not her mother.   You were the child. You were ALWAYS the child, and she was supposed to care for you.    You are not her mother.  And you couldn't be her mother even if you wanted to, because you are not her mother.   And, if it helps, consider this.   She wouldn't 'let' you be her mother even if you could be. She would always try and make sure you felt inferior to her, and controlled by her.  My husband said it best: She wants you to care for her like she's a child, and she wants to boss you around and dominate you like she's an adult.  She can't have it both ways.  And, you're not her mother. Making you believe that you are, is part of her abuse."

Or how when she started a bakery, I was in the process of working my way through college, and already had 3 jobs and a full school schedule, but she couldn't handle her business, and guilted me into working for her (often times for free) during the only 6-8 hours I would have off in a given week.   Or how I had to pay her cable bill for her when I was in high school - with my own money that I worked for (at a job she forced me to get when I was 13) - because she couldn't handle the responsibility of paying bills on time, yet couldn't live without cable tv.

I started to have it when I was a teenager, because I knew how toxic she was and all I wanted to do was get away from her, but when I did, I just pictured her crying.  It took me a LONG time to realize and believe - She Is The Adult. she has ALWAYS been the adult. And I never got to be the child. And that's 100% her fault and 100% not okay.   It was NEVER my job to care for her, as much as she wants to believe it.   I have a teenage son. I'm not the center of his attention anymore, he spends more time talking to his friends than he does to me. And that's completely appropriate. It's not his JOB to take care of my emotions. HE GETS TO BE THE CHILD. (sorry for yelling, but sometimes I have to yell these things.)  The Child Gets To Be The Child.   And if the child didn't get to be the child, then the parent can't ask even the 'grown up' child for a goddamn thing.  I'm sorry if I sound harsh or drill sargeant-y.  But no one ever told us that it wasn't our job to take care of our parents.

Am I just excusing her behavior? I get frustrated trying to decide how much is her illness, and how much is she personally responsible for? Maybe that's the wrong question. I don't know.    I'm so sorry you're in this situation. It's a hard place to be. This really resonates with me. My work has been mostly with the mentally ill and substance abusers. It's work requiring a lot of energy, time, emotional resiliency. It's very similar to what my relationship was like with my N dad...except I got to leave at the end of the day. I spent a lot of time asking myself this same question you posed, probably more due to my work with sick people that others often misunderstand. How much is the illness, how much is him? My mom often said that if N dad one day realized exactly how much suffering he's inflicted on others, he'd probably kill himself. Obviously she leans towards the illness. But mental illness is tricky and although no one should be solely defined by their illness, I feel you can define people by the totality of their person. I don't know if my N dad or Ns in general ever truly realize the consequences of their actions, because their view is skewed by their illness, but they certainly know what to do to get what they want and to manipulate others positively or negatively. And that's the issue. It's hard to be around an N without getting sick yourself and can enable their behaviors as well. Put on your oxygen mask first and do what you've got to to keep it on. Illness or person, no one can change the N. You can decide what's best for you to be a happy, healthy person yourself though."

Because you were programmed to be just that. You've never been given the opportunity to blossom like a flower in spring because you've always had a boot crushing you, as it blocked any and all access to sunlight.   I understand why you want to be hard on yourself, but past mistakes are past mistakes. Telling yourself you can't forgive yourself for something you did in the past (with a past mind-set, let's face it - you have never been where you are now until NOW) is highly limiting and constricting to your ability to grow and develop.  It sounds as though you've removed yourself from the toxicity that caused you to feel the way you do now, and GOOD ON YOU. Now you have the opportunity to remedy your personal dysfunctions so you don't repeat the mistakes from your past. If you can still reach out to the people you feel as though you shit on (I've done that plenty myself - nothing functional comes from narcissism, but it's NOT YOUR FAULT YOU WERE TREATED LIKE SHIT), then do so. Make amends and strive to think of the best possible outcome. I even know how hard that can be...I've constantly expected the worst, but that line of thinking can bring the worst outcome to fruition - self-fulfilling prophesy.   If you are unable to reach out to those you believe you've shit on, then you still need to get those emotions and thoughts out so they don't continue holding you back. There are four techniques you can work with that can greatly help you release yourself from the bind you're currently experiencing.   1) Write letters and get EVERYTHING OUT. Don't think about it, just write and get it ALL OUT. This means emotions, fears, hopes, dreams, desires, wants, needs, thoughts, etc. associated with the experiences that are causing you to chastise yourself. Then take them outside and burn them, watch the smoke carry your troubles away (the messages will get to whom needs to receive them via the wind - it's all energy and emotional blockages that need to be moved, then you can find peace), and bury the ashes so it represents a funeral.   2) If you can find a secluded spot in the wilderness where you won't be bothered, get down on your knees and place your palms on the ground. Then SCREAM and YELL as much as you can in order to get all of the anger and feelings out! GET EVERYTHING OUT until you can't scream or yell anymore. The stagnant/negative energy you've been holding onto will be transferred to the Earth so it can be used for creative purposes as opposed to holding you back. Think of it like Goku or Vageta powering up in DBZ. It's fun and HIGHLY effective.  3) If you can't reach a person you've had issues with, then pull up two chairs and sit in one so that it's facing the other. Pretend the individual is sitting across from you, or use a stuffed animal, picture, etc. to represent them. Similar to the letter writing, you'll want to SPEAK and get EVERYTHING out. Don't hold back because the objects won't respond. This will allow you to create a safe space to clear your head and heart without feeling judged or shunned.   4) Find a quiet spot where you won't be bothered and find a comfortable position to sit and chill. Focus on your breathing and count up to ten when you inhale, and then count back down to one when you exhale. Do this until you can focus on the numbers without being distracted internally or externally. If your mind wanders, don't worry or get upset with yourself for ""not being able to do it right."" Just gently bring it back into focus by focusing on the numbers. Once you're calm and focused you'll want to verbalize this: ""All emotions, thoughts, and any other parts of me associated with ""x"" (x = experience, person, place, thing), would you like to be released? More than likely you'll hear a YES because thoughts and emotions are no different from the objects we see everyday, other than the fact they are intangible because they are felt and heard differently by everyone. Once you hear that answer, then say: ""Thank you for being apart of my life, but I give you permission to live yours as you see fit. I give you permission to leave. Thank you for everything.""   It will honestly feel like you'll be putting down a bag of weights so you can breathe. Why? Because you've been carrying these emotional and psychological scars for so long that they have developed their own weight, and literally drag you down. Look at the words you've written down in this post - ""I can't..."" ""I don't deserve...""   Yes you can, and yes you do deserve. What can you do and what do you deserve? You can achieve peace and clarity, and you DESERVE to live your life so you can CHOOSE to be happy. You've been through A LOT, but you were a product of toxicity. So was I, and I'm sure many others on this forum can relate. But once we remove ourselves from dysfunction junction, we can choose to live our lives in a healthy and balanced manner. You will succeed and I believe in you.   It's miraculous how far you've come and I'm proud of you. Hang in there and keep your chin up! You're going to make it and you're going to succeed. I know it.    Btw you're not a psychopath or a narc because you are able to judge yourself through introspection. You obviously have a conscious, so you're not a shithead :) You're a human being who has been through hell and back. Time to thrive now and in the future. No more surviving for you, but you must let go of the past in order to heal yourself now and forever more."

That's not your fault, that's the fault of the adults who were supposed to care for you as a child. You yourself are NOT a narcissist or sociopath. You have worked to improve yourself and you care about the fact that you hurt people in the past. These are things that narcissists and sociopaths aren't big on.   I know the well of shame at your past seems like it's bottomless, but it's not. It's an optical illusion; you're looking at it through the distorted lens of your parents' toxic messages. People are more forgiving than you give them credit for, and you, too, are more capable of forgiving yourself than you give yourself credit for. I hope you'll be able to see that soon."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3cqo5r,muinamir,2,Fri Jul 10 09:49:26 2015 UTC,"If it helps, it is a big sign of progress and growth, that you feel bad for having been that way.  This post could have described me perfectly.  I have been (and in many ways, many times, still am) very toxic at times. I am working on it and am so much better than I was even just months ago.    I do not feel very bad for how awful I was, and I've done far worse than what you list in this post.  I am not to the point where I regret it.  People regret things when they grow and change. They develop a new, stronger, ethical code, and they start to hold themselves to higher standards. This only happens when people grow and develop; and regret is a necessary symptom of that change.  Regret comes with change; as a person changes, she gets a new code to live by, and naturally, she looks back at her life and feels regret, now having a new code to apply to her life.   This is akin to a country passing new laws in their legislature. Almost all countries have it written in their constitution that new laws cannot retroactively apply to people's behavior from the past, prior to the law being past. For example, when the U.S. illegalized certain drugs, they did not go and arrest people from the past who had used those drugs, because that law didn't exist years prior to its passing.  Most countries would not find that fair to do to its citizens.  Yet we do it to ourselves every day. Every time we change, we look back and say ""crap, why didn't I do what I know now to be right back then! WHY?!"" and we punish ourselves and hate ourselves for it.  This is very unfair, but we all do it.    I try to recognize regret for what it is:  proof of progress.    I would highly recommend you seeking professional help if you have not already.  The path to change is very, very painful, and while people can sometimes do it alone, there is no reason to create more suffering on top of it when it is not necessary.  Failing to reach out to all the help and resources out there, is just more self-punishment enacted retroactively."

What concerns me is how much this feeling of 'being loved' is triggering tons of memories of my Nmom's rages towards me.  One of her favorite things to say was ""why do YOU get to be happy""  and then she would go on a big manipulative trip to sabotage the relationship that was making me happy.  This has been holding me back for MONTHS. (actually, years, to be depressingly honest, I've just noticed and recognized it a few months ago) and I have to be honest, the memories are makings me angry.  I hate it that these two things are so inextricably linked.  I used to have to apologize to my mom if I had a good relationship and she didn't.  ""Why can't I have people who love me?"" She would literally cry about this stuff in front of me.  And then go on a rampage ""do you think you can trust him/her? you're not very nice to them, you know, you're not a very good friend, you know.""  I hate this woman so much.

Good things tend to happen to good people who are surrounded by other good people. Your mother didn't ""get"" to be happy because she was surrounded only by her self, and her self was a very hateful person. True joy doesn't find those types.   I'm glad you are angry about it instead of feeling guilty. Narcs just suck the joy right out of everything around them. Like a black hole of hatred. Do you still see her?"

I'm at a bit of a crossroads because I'm going to have to go back to the city she lives in (zillions of miles away) for unavoidable reasons.  My NC has been a bit of a cake walk because I live in another country.  But, when I go back to my home city, I'm gonna have to really stick to my guns. Not go and see her, and tell anyone who asks 'this is none of your business, don't talk to me about her.'  She's been kind of secretive about the fact that I don't talk to her. On the one hand, she sent flying monkeys several times in the first year or so, but, I know that she absolutely doesn't want to admit that I'm not talking to her.  I realized just last night that the abuse she subjected me to isn't something I have to explain to anyone. And if anyone wants an explanation or a justification, I will warn them once - 'do not speak to me about this subject again.'  She's got a small cult following still, in the form of her other GC children, and some flying monkeys who basically love gossip, but other than that, she's not able to 'get' to me.  I know I'm rambling on. I just...... I'm proud of my 2 years of NC. And when I go back to my home city, I'm actually proud that I won't let anyone strong arm me into seeing her.

I just want to see how other long term NC-ers have handled the family that surrounds the Narc.   7 years! wow."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3co09l,Beatrixa,2,Thu Jul 9 13:35:59 2015 UTC,"My mom divorced my dad when I was 4. Sisters were 2 and 9 months old. When I was 8 my mom sent us to my dad's so she could finish school but then we ended up in the middle of an intense and awful and long custody battle when she realized he wasn't going to let us see her ever. When I really think things through, she was the age I am now while all that was going on... and my kids are just a tad younger than I was back then, too. It is... weird to think about.  So anyway, my mom has basically been NC since my youngest sister turned 18 and only absolutely necessary contact before that. She had a restraining order on him at one point.  My mom is an angel. Her side of the family is amazing as well and I wish I had less personal shame so that I could handle maintaining a relationship with them. They are successful in every sense of the word. Not crazy rich, just... motivated, centered, GOOD people. I've talked more about my mom in other posts, if you care to dig. I could say a lot more. She's just... amazing. :D  My dad's side of the family I do not speak to. When his mother died, I didn't see her in hospice and I didn't attend the funeral. That basically made the entire rest of the family disown me, which was fine, really, because, like you said, anyone that can't understand that I absolutely refuse to speak to or see or be subjected to my dad can fuck right off... (sorry).  My grandma was the type who would call or I'd call and she'd just start off with ""How's your father? What?! HONEY! Why can't we all just forgive one another? Jesus wants us to love one another. Aren't we all Christians here??!!!"" Well, gma... no, no we are not. And forgiving some one doesn't make them stop repeating hurtful behavior....It excuses it and sets you up to be serially abused.   So.. yeah. When I think about my dad, I don't usually have pangs of guilt or sadness or really any emotion at all. I don't consider that a bad thing, btw. I just describe what happened, how he treated me and my sisters, and then I can discuss the effects as though it was simply a matter of logical consequences etc of being raised by an abusive person and not from a place of fear or heartache.   I have simply come to realize that I don't have a father and I don't really know what I am missing because I've never had a father figure either. That is sad to some, but to me it is like growing up without a third nipple... lolol and instead having this angry ape on my head that, now that I am NC, isn't there anymore. :D  In short, I am working through the residual effects of my childhood, but I'm old enough that I don't directly blame my dad, I simply recognize the cause/effect situation and go from there. It helps that my sisters know better than to talk about him to me and that I promptly removed people who push the issue."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3cmqyp,starstough,4,Thu Jul 9 02:52:32 2015 UTC,"This is why ""mindfulness"" in CBT/DBT is not the goal in of itself either.  You can get stuck in terrible emotional states - states that aren't even mental, and you can keep rejecting your mind in a mistaken thought of ""I'm stupid"" or you can even get stuck in an  egotistical thing. What I like are recognizing states of joy in all forms of activity. Even one's where I might be a little scared, or unhappy, or pressured. Gut instincts are important, but so are rational thoughts as well, such as ""I need to remember where my keys are"" to even ""This guy makes me feel creepy.""  I think the most important thing is the MIND WANTS TO SETTLE. This is a very deep thing to remember but also SO DO THE EMOTIONS.   I don't believe in any negative emotions or negative thoughts, as he is saying ""getting distance"" is a good thing but not the end process of itself. You don't want to get too far away from the thought. Because we are limited creatures all thoughts and emotions have their place and may contain valuable information, we just have to act on them appropriately. ""Mindfullness"" that ignores or negates is not the goal. You want to touch it like you have awareness like a guitar string, or a bow. Tense but not too tense, loose but not too loose. Flexible but not too tight.   I meditated for many many years. I meditated mostly skanda (which was mind-breaking like in a bad way) for someone like me especially.   I really dislike Ekhart Tole too, so I'm glad he had a negative feeling towards all that pain body crap, but I seriously disagree with his conclusions. People who have CPTSD may not be as horribly lacking discipline as he thought. Some people are just differently abled.   I really like what he said about ""it doesn't matter what your opinion is."" That's a very good statement for anyone to do. Some people get pretty far in life being like this. As well as ""finding the facts"" oh man. It's one of the things that makes me paranoid about the human race - just how mob mentality works.   There's nothing wrong with imagining you're a rainbow magical pony as long as you know it is only imagination! Seriously, as long as you don't get insulted if life shows you something different!   I really like what he says at the end. Bringing in strength, objectivity, independence etc.   BTW I REALLY REALLY like the ""Oprah Winfrey reality tunnel."""

When I first found him though, I inhaled his videos like crack. They were very validating. But that doesn't mean they are right. A lot of self-described gurus are like this. They sound very right but if you listen again its actually a bit off to being VERY off.   However, I'm someone who used to be called ""Spiritual Poison"" and such things, so maybe I'm just trigger happy about what he's saying. I'm an SG, I'm a natural skeptic and always will be one.

The main thing I got from this guy is that if I choose to meditate, I need enough distance from my thoughts that I can examine them, not dismiss them.   There was a guy in the Buddhism sub that posted a really great thing about how to meditate when you've had trauma that has left you without a strong self. Some people were getting down on him because apparently Buddhism teaches that the goal is to be rid of all things ""self""...  I asked one of the guys whether Buddhism teaches that people who have had to destroy their ""self"" for the sake of an abusive person or as a result of trauma are considered enlightened... he didn't respond. I think that Buddhism has some interesting concepts especially in comparison and contrast to other religions, but that when dealing with those of us who've gone through trauma, it doesn't address the core issues and can be dangerous. I don't want to be an empty vessel. Empty vessels can get filled with all sorts of badness. I just want to be calm and collected and thoughtful and mindful. Mindfulness is my goal."

Abused and neglected children who enter adulthood are more prone to be entwined within toxic relationships because that's all they've known for most of their lives. I.e. it's hard to recognize how imbalanced something is if you've never experienced anything different, or rather balanced and healthy.   It's also interesting and relevant to note that around 3-4% of the human population is psychopathic and according to the U.S. National Institute of Health, nearly 6% of the U.S. population alone has NPD. If you grow up here in the west, our societies actually predicate the notions that it's okay to take advantage of others, push others down to get ahead or to elevate oneself, and to simply turn a blind eye to introspection altogether. Pretty backwards, but the west encourages N behavior all around.

It's kind of like saying, 'I can run fast, why did I get eaten by a lion?' Some people are definitely more vulnerable and more predisposed to being sucked in by a narc. BUT, don't forget Narcs Seek People Out! They can't really exist without an audience, even a small one! That's why my Nmom had children even when she was way too poor to afford to care for them. She needed an audience, accolytes, fans, 'students.'  TLDR, They seek people out, they work VERY hard to suck people in.  People with fine childhoods still get sucked into cults sometimes.

How will this job lead you to your long term goals? How long do you think it will take? Will people in your potential workplace get in the way of that? If you don't take this job, will it be a big financial or personal loss? If you take this job, will it be a big financial or personal loss?   Just some things I would consider."

I take it you understood the basic duties of the job beforehand, so you took the interview anyway because you need the work --is that fair to say? if so, it might be your ego clouding your perceptions. I know as all of us who suffered N-abuse know about how difficult it is to trust. Any CEO is going to show some N-traits. That doesn't make him or her N. There are some ways I can over to validate your assumptions about the CEO, but it may be your ego telling you deserve something better. Have they communicated an offer in writing? if so, then how long do have to communicate your decision?  Once you have an offer in writing, Ask for a week or 2 to decide. that's reasonable. use this time consider an opportunity that you may be happier with."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3clj14,House_of_Atreus,3,Thu Jul 9 03:07:53 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it comes down to how badly you need a job, any job, ASAP.  If your financial situation is dire, it might be best to take the job & keep looking.  If it takes you a month or two to find a better job, 1-2 months of batshit work drama might be better than 1-2 months of no income.    If your finances are semi-stable & you think you could find a better job fairly quickly, it might be best to turn it down & hold out for something better.    Negotiating for a higher salary is also something you could try.  Most companies are open to this, but pretend not to be.  They save money by giving extra money to people who ask, but not to everyone too intimidated to ask.  It's one of the many reasons there's a pay disparity that negatively affects women, minorities, immigrants, people living in poverty, and abuse survivors - because those are the people society trains not to advocate for themselves."

The trick here is to remember that most people are actually not horrible monsters.  The registrar isn't going to tell you that you're a horrible person for being disorganized or having dropped out.  Nparents tend to train us to believe everyone will do that sort of thing always, but among actual normal, sane adults, that sort of bullshit is really rare.  They'll say, ""Oh, welcome back!  Good for you for going back to school!  We'd be delighted to take your tuition money!""    Of all the jobs they could have in the entire world, what they're getting paid to do is help college kids get all their paperwork straightened out so they can take their classes and get their degrees.  So they'll do that.    It'll be fine.  It'll be a frustrating, bureaucratic, red tape dance back and forth between various university offices on opposite sides of campus in the rain, but it'll be fine.

LifeAfterNarcissism,3ch8ed,starstough,5,Tue Jul 7 22:01:31 2015 UTC,"I'm totally  not into meds. I had been given some as samples from my regular doctor years ago when my son was near dead with a rare disease and they called it ""general anxiety"".... no, idiot PA... see... when your kid almost dies...that's a traumatic event ffs. Anywho...I am actually pretty anxious, so maybe the diagnosis sticks, but the meds they gave me were... so so so wrong.   One was ""as needed"" and was supposed to just relax me. One was to be taken every day. The first time I tried the as needed pill I took it before bed, after the kids were asleep because I didn't know what it would do to me. I was drooling on myself 15 minutes later and passed out. The second night, same thing. The third morning I was craving one of those like a cigarette... so much so that I had my (then husband) take the whole bottle away to work. I told him, don't tell me where you're taking these but I never want to see or hear of them again. I spent the entire day talking myself down. It was horrifying. I couldn't believe a doctor would prescribe something to take ""as needed"" for anxiety that would be that addictive and cause that reaction, knowing I had very young kids. Can you imagine if I was panicking on the highway and popped one of those???  So yeah, I get that... I'm not keen on meds. But I figured, an eval won't hurt, and maybe there's something awesome out there that has few side effects or something... I dunno.   The ""I'll look crazy"" thing... ugh, I know. :( My mom had a very difficult time getting help because my dad was so smooth and charismatic. And the things he did were hard to even describe properly.  Have you thought about typing out your story so you can just email it or hand it over with a disclaimer like ""I know this sounds nuts, but I need you to believe this happened to me so that you can help me deal with the aftermath."" and see what happens?"
LifeAfterNarcissism,3ch8ed,ObscureRefence,2,Wed Jul 8 00:50:13 2015 UTC,"I am glad you are doing well now. I looked for a therapist for a long time, but the looking I was doing wasn't really very intensive. I was looking at profiles on a website that had just an insane number of therapists in my area, but none of them accepted my insurance. So I ended up going to my county's mental health department. I didn't get to choose who I saw. They did an intake assessment and then tried to pick someone who was the best fit for my needs.   I am seeing a therapist who usually specializes in addiction recovery... I'm not nor have I ever been addicted to anything other than nicotine (which I am weaning myself off of easily with e-cigs), but she has been really nice anyway.   It just got to a point where I realized that I needed to see anyone who would listen to me rant for a minute. There were all these reasons I felt I couldn't or shouldn't talk to friends or trusted family and I desperately needed to vocalize things. Even if that was all it was: a vocalization.   Even if she ends up not being the exact right fit for me, just talking has helped a ton already and the tiny bit of words she's said to me while letting me verbally vomit have been just enormously helpful. I feel better just knowing that the next appointment is set, like that's a lifeline I have. It is a reminder that I'm actively seeking healing. There are still really shitty days, but recently I've had more good days than bad and the good days have been actually good vs. not bad. lol"

Unfortunately I don't know the name of the drug. I can usually remember the daily drug I was given if I see it hear the name but I never even took that one. I got rid of all of it.   The crappy thing is that I've had Xanax before and loved it. A friend gave me one of hers for a flight. I was terrified of flying. She said ""take half for the trip there, half for the return flight. It's like a glass of wine. You won't notice anything except the lack of worry."" And she was so right. I wasn't up or down, just normal. But apparently asking for Xanax is considered drug seeking. And I didn't even realize Xanax is a typically abused drug. :/ sucks. If weed wasn't stigmatized, and if I knew I could get edibles or something with a controlled and very small dose, that's about as much of a difference I'd want from being medicated."

LifeAfterNarcissism,3ch8ed,coldandwet,5,Wed Jul 8 19:19:15 2015 UTC,One of my anxiety symptoms is being paranoid about personality disorders.   I'm pretty convinced I have DPD and AvPD but I feel awkward outright asking my psychiatrist.
LifeAfterNarcissism,3ch8ed,PrancerPrancer,3,Wed Jul 8 19:30:45 2015 UTC,"A phrase that gets thrown around here sometimes is that a lot of us have ""Normal reactions to abnormal situations.""  The idea of having a ""disorder"" to some people is scary, like there's something wrong with us that has a name. To some, maybe it is comforting to name the thing. Maybe naming it contains it and makes it easier to face?  All I know is that for me, personally, when I am told something is wrong with me and I don't think the wrong thing is wrong (as in, I know I'm not perfect, but the problem isn't that thing) I start to doubt myself and think, well, is that really a problem? Can other people handle that stuff?  I guess my therapist is validating a lot of my feelings and even gently challenging me. I'll mention something that I think is just a pertinent detail about how I know my reaction was wrong and she'll say ""Was it though? Or is it reasonable to expect a reaction like that given those circumstances?"" And then she gives me a tool to use instead, since I dislike reacting like I sometimes do.  I think that it would be fine to outright ask your therapist if she thinks you have any personality disorders. But I would also say, based on things I have read and what I know about DPD and AvPD, is that if you had a traumatic childhood (which I assume is true, since you are here), C-PTSD looks like a lot of things, and panicking when people put you down and not knowing what is real and not having much of an identity is precisely what happens when you've been systematically stripped of everything ""self"" by adults who are supposed to support and care for you. Building yourself up is the healing process. I have emotional growing pains often now. lol"

LifeAfterNarcissism,3ce0ex,VinylWithIntent,5,Tue Jul 7 05:29:10 2015 UTC,"I keep thinking some Carrie type moment will happen whew people will laugh and say they were just kidding and then I feel stupid and embarrassed for reacting that way.   This is a constant issue for me and something I said to my husband really changed my perspective on it. We were walking down the street talking about our immigrant backgrounds and how it's shaped us and I jokingly said to my husband ""I wonder what people would think if I told them English wasn't my first language"" (it is, but a lot of people assume it isn't because I'm brown). My husband just kind of looked at me all confused and said ""then they would think English isn't your first language...what do you mean?"" and it hit me! They wouldn't think English isn't my first language because I'm brown but because I just told them it wasn't.  This is a really long way of saying most people accept the face value of what is said. If someone is trying to mislead you, that's on THEM for being misleading. Not on you for being mislead. Why is it stupid for you/us/me to believe something someone says (to a degree)? Why is it egg on our face if someone laughs at us for them being misleading? Would you ever give a non-genuine compliment? And if it was non-genuine would you immediately rescind it and feel like a big shot or like an idiot?

And then they give you more!  These days I've learned to just say ""thank you!"" that way they don't keep going with the compliments, making me feel even more awkward.  As for asking for anything, I was never really good at that.  Or, growing up, everything I asked for was given to my sister instead.  So whatever I wanted, I got for myself.  It's weird right now because I'm about to have a baby, and everyone wants to help/give me stuff and a lot of times I feel awkward accepting their gifts or their help.  But I'm working on it.  I often give gifts with no strings attached.  So I try to remind myself that sometimes others might want to do the same for me.  I have a friend who is throwing me a baby shower soon, she said ""you deserve to have a party just for you"" and I'm like, ""do I really?"" it's hard to convince myself that I deserve something like this.  But it sure is nice to feel special once in a while.  Even if it feels awkward at the same time.  One of my friends bought me a brand new and expensive stroller/carseat/carrier, came over and put it all together, without me asking.  I feel like I need to do something for him or else I've ""used"" him in some way.

Just last week my dad ""happened to be in the neighborhood"", invited himself over unannounced, barged into my home and followed me around yelling that I don't know everything and he expected me to think this was totally ok.

And his reasoning for gaining custody is so that he can teach my son karate - he has never taken karate classes, and the last time he tried to ""karate"" with his walking stick, he ended up limping for 3 months.  I feel bad for my mom because I don't even want to go to their house to see her because he'd be there (and I absolutely will not allow them to have alone time with my son once he is here) but honestly, she did nothing to protect us growing up even if she knew we were right, because she didn't want to deal with him.  My little sister got disowned because the old freezer seal had finally dried and cracked, and she was devastated when she was disowned so I took her out to eat and then I got disowned for taking her out to eat.  It was completely ridiculous and my mom just sat there and let the whole thing go down and then played ""poor poor pitiful me my husband is crazy"" after.  Ugh, I can totally see why my sister moved to another state."

All of these are in the same bucket for me. It's getting better since I'm aware of it and actively working on it, but dang.   So here's an experience from a month ago. For my birthday, my boyfriend cooked dinner and gave me a really thoughtful gift.   Here is a summary of my reactions:  - cat wrapping paper: outwardly excited! ""oh this wrapping paper is so cool you know me so well blah blah!!!"" - actual present: oh wow. thank you so much. I can't believe you gave me this. it's too much... shock, sadness, acting happy. - discovered I missed a yummy potato on my plate: YES!!! Oh man these were soooo delicious.   To the later, my boyfriend remarked: ""Wow, I think you were more excited about the potato than your present."" That broke my heart. I wasn't but expressing joy particularly when something is really meaningful to me is something that triggers my flight response so bad. We talked about it and he knows my history, so no major fallout there. I probably over-thanked him after that.   To sum it up. It's not that I don't believe the sincerity of compliments or gifts. I don't believe I deserve them. Thanks to therapy, I understand where this comes from and that it's not accurate. My visceral reaction is still overriding my intellectual understanding in the moment. One step forward, two steps back. Worth it, yet so exhausting."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3ce3xr,Chocolate_Muscle,8,Tue Jul 7 05:01:04 2015 UTC,"I made a post for this only a few weeks ago! I had EXACTLY the same reaction after my neighbours had a baby. When the baby would start crying around 23:00 (I was usually almost asleep then), I'd have a panic attack and I'd be listening for signs of abuse or neglect - angry, yelling people, slamming doors, even the baby crying in pain.   I recognised the reaction as a trigger and after a week or so managed to convince myself that my neighbour baby was not abused or neglected. And I could sleep again.  But yes, it's very familiar. I'm always hyperalert around babies and toddlers, and every bruise or cut they have, my first thought is is this child being abused?. While kids are prone to falling and bumping into stuff.  I hope this is of comfort: I did not have the same panic reaction on the crying of my own kid. I think this is about control of the situation. When your own baby is crying, even when you have an endlessly crying baby, you know they are safe. You know the bottle needs some time to prepare, or the diaper will be cleaned, or that it takes some time for you to (for example) dry your hands and put away a plate before you can walk upstairs and get your baby out of bed. You know the child will not be yelled at or worse, because you are the one caring for it. Makes a huge difference."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3ce3xr,betnhe,4,Tue Jul 7 07:20:00 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're talking about. But in my experience, hearing your own child cry is different from hearing another child cry. Children crying is normal, and when you're a mom you'll learn how to interact with and care for your own baby in a healthy way.  I was a pretty 'attachment style' parent when my son was a baby and toddler, before I even knew it was a thing.  Sometimes babies cry because they're tired or cranky or hungry or sometimes for no real reason, just letting off steam. When you're a mom you'll learn to tell the difference.   I think the key with your own children is to not take it personally, and not be 'angry' at the baby for crying.    I used to hate the sound of babies crying, but I took care of kids so much that I learned to tell the difference between a 'normal distressed' cry and a 'fucking hell something's not right here' cry.  You'll be fine with your own child. Just don't take it personally. :) Oh, also a bit of an aside, I read recently that colic, where babies cry for hours and hours for no apparent reason, may be a form of infant migraine, (poor kids :( )   Babies just want to feel secure and loved, like everyone else. I had a pretty good system for comforting my son when he would cry, and it worked well for everyone.  The other thing I would say is this: trust your instincts. Remember, you're the mom, no one else, and you'll have a bond with the baby that will help you learn from him so you can gain confidence. I had a lot of experience caring for children before I had my son, so I might be slightly different. Long story short, don't take it personally, you're the mom, trust your instincts, and know what when you're holding and comforting your baby, even if he takes a while to stop crying, that's a normal part of baby-hood.   Also, it's hard to give hypothetical baby advice on an internet forum :)  As long as you and your partner understand that crying is a normal form of expression and communication for a baby - and you don't take it personally, you should be fine.   also, you might want to express your concerns to your partner. (ETA: I'm a huge proponent of discussing child-rearing concerns and philosophies before having children.) Let him know that your father used to react badly when he would hear a baby crying, and that on some level, you need to be reassured that he (the future baby's father) won't react the same way.  I had to work really, really, hard to teach myself that my husband was NOT going to act exactly like my mother and stepfather did.  Now I see that I was re-living a lot of fears and putting them on him, when he would never ever do the things they did.  Perhaps talking to your SO about these fears would help you.  If you know that he is going to have normal, healthy reactions to babies crying, that might help assuage your fears/concerns about the future."

And this is going to sound really random, but it's a thing that worked for me: when I hear a baby crying, and I can't do anything to help it (like on a plane), I close my eyes and I try to follow the pitch of the crying visually.  As if it's a mountain range, or a line on a graph, traveling up and down.  There's something about it that takes the fear out of it, makes it more objective -- like, kind of a meditation, acceptance."

With my own baby, it made me very attentive because I wanted to get him back to his happy self ASAP. I had the most trouble when he was an infant if I couldn't get him to stop. I wouldn't get angry, but I'd get anxious, like, he's sad, I'm a bad mother, look I can't help him, etc. Once I connected the two dots, it doesn't bother me as much, and I can calm down quickly."

This was particularly hard for me because since I was that small I've had this intense fear of needles.

My in laws do lists for birthday's and Christmas and expect us to send our lists too. At first it was THE WORST feeling to write down what you wanted (not needed).  I am more comfortable and get more excited when I get random surprise things that I would never think to write down. So the last item on the list is always: SURPRISE ME :) That way if someone can't afford or find the things I do want they don't have to feel upset and they'll know I'll enjoy whatever they get me.  Asking for things? I'm not sure if this is acceptable but I imagine people close to you (spouse, non N family) would probably like it if you dropped some hints. I know my husband keeps a note on his phone of all the random things I want.  Do I just let people give me things? Well they're gifting you things, so yes. They're not giving you things out of charity or obligation and if they are it'll be immediately obvious in that case just think kind thoughts towards them (might have their own FLEAS)."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3cceoi,craaackle,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:56:02 2015 UTC,"Not related to video games, but I have struggled with a similar FLEA. My Ns never allowed me to try anything new or develop skills/talents as a kid, so I was very insecure about ""not being good at anything."" Another piece was feeling judged when someone else won. Nmom is very competitive and judgmental with me, so I projected that onto whomever I was doing the competitive thing with. I got/get triggered by winning as well, because as the SG I wasn't supposed to be good at things, proud or confident, or better than other people in a manner commensurate with actual abilities (she wanted me to be an N though, whole other story). As a result, I have felt guilty and ashamed for winning at things, and worried that winning would bring out the worst in me/turn me into an N.   One thing that has helped is associating with people who are normal, not crazy judgmental Ns. You can learn about healthy competition this way. I have also practiced at pushing myself, not giving up due to insecurity, and working to become better at things I like.   Example: I got into biking recently, and started riding with a group. At first, I was always the slowest one who got left behind. Instead of surrendering to the FLEA and telling myself I'm no good, I practiced, got better gear, researched, listened to advice without feeling threatened/triggered/defensive (FLEA), etc. I'm still towards the back, but I improved and can keep up now."

Get some space between you and your SO and roommate if at all possible (beyond getting a hotel room) because you're right to point out they are both essentially treating you like a doormat. If he cared about you and was truly functional in any capacity, he would encourage you to get support from a professional or group who have had similar experiences.   Establishing healthy boundaries is vital to ensure you enjoy your life. Everyone needs them, and you aren't bad for wanting them. Are you lazy? No. I'd say you've been through A LOT and thus you've been carrying A LOT of baggage for quite some time now. It's amazing you're able to put one foot in front of the other considering all you've been through, let alone have a relationship of any kind - even intimate! Are you fearful? Rightfully so because your personal boundaries have been violated for quite some time now. That guy was super creepy and WRONG for taking advantage of you when you were clearly in a vulnerable state.   I know that when I was a teenager (15) I was molested by my cello instructor at a time in life when I was severely depressed. My father attempted to rape one of my sisters while he was drunk, was kicked out by my Nmom, stalked the family for an entire summer, and then committed suicide right before my sophomore year in high school. Needless to say I was pretty torn up. So there were times I'd be in a private  lesson and I'd break down crying, at which time my instructor would lay me on the floor next to him as he wrapped his body around mine. He would then rub his hands all over me as he would whisper ""you're going to be okay."" - things along those lines. It took years for me to recognize that his behavior was completely uncalled for - you don't comfort an underage teen who's suffering by molesting them. Thankfully he never raped me, but it was leading to that. I stopped going altogether, but it still fucked me up.   I've spent years in isolation because my Nmom conditioned me to believe I'd turn out just like my dad. I was always fearful that I would rape someone (even holding hands was considered a NO for me because I didn't want to hurt anyone), and that was coupled with having my body being taken advantage of at a time I was most vulnerable. So ya, it's amazing you're able to have an relationship with someone at all - even an intimate one.   But please find support, call your local DV, get counseling, and ultimately get the help you need. It's not a weakness...you've been through A LOT and you're amazing for making it this far. Keep going and listen to your gut instinct. Start protecting yourself so you don't serve as a doormat for the rest of your life. You deserve better than that.

She told the family to brace for a horrible destructive criminal teenager, and all that happened was I ended up being the doormat and household help.   And yes, you are being pushed to yelling out bursts.  Antagonizing people is what they do.   I had the bizarre misfortune of living with my mother again at the age of 33. I got to see, as a mature, grown, capable adult all the bizarre stuff she would do to try and create victimhood and superiority on her part, and create the role of 'life destroying criminal' on my part.  One time she actually accused me of, wait for it..... breaking the ice maker.  (how?????) you should have seen the look on her face. She relished in freaking out about it and getting herself into a lather and blaming me for something. Then the ice maker started working again when she flipped the switch back into the on position.   There was also the case of the missing 'small red jar' on the bathroom floor that she was convinced I had either stolen or broken.  I cleaned the bathroom floor twice a week (in addition to paying market-value rent to live with her in her mortgage free home, I also was her cleaner.)   The pen that was in the washing machine? That broke because she went into my room and decided to do my laundry un-invited?  Oh, that pen ellicited an actual wail.  You should have seen the horror/glee on her face when she yelled my name because a pen had broken in the washing machine.  Sadly, with a narcissist, you can NEVER be reasonable. You can't reason with a narcissist. It can't be done. Ever.  I'm going to recommend a couple youtube videos that were kind of helpful for me - a guy has had a lot of experience with narcs in a relationship and friendship capacity, but a lot of his knowledge can be applied to any kind of narc interaction.  TLDR, YOU CAN'T REASON WITH A NARC.   I lived with my batshit crazy mom for half a year and saw her loose her shit and CRY about every single thing she could.

The best way for him to keep you with him would be to give you just barely enough hope that he will change.

LifeAfterNarcissism,3c66a0,bigfuckingheart,10,Sun Jul 5 05:09:48 2015 UTC,"The awareness of the fear of engulfment/abandonment/being 'known' is the first step in the cluster b disorders not controlling you.  Even if you feel the compulsions, time and time again, it is an amazingly meaningful thing to say afterwards, ""I did that because of fear, what I did/said/requested was wrong"".  You are only as sick as your secrets, and when you stop hiding from the feelings motivating your behaviors, you begin to gain the upper hand.  now it is just increasingly applying that awareness to your daily life, and working to improve your empathy skills.  You could do this via psychotherapy or CBT, it depends how you want to tackle this. Good luck on your journey, by rejecting the lies/excuses/projections we usually cloak our fleas behavior in, we are that much closer to happiness and CONNECTION with our loved ones."

The behavior is as destructive as it is unsustainable, and I absolutely need to break out of it. Sad as it sounds, when I successfully discipline my kids my ego feels inflated and I feel on top of my game. When I fail in these endeavors (such as failing to gain the cooperation of a terrible-two-toddler with molars coming in in a restaurant setting), I feel angry, rageful and judged by the entire world for the actions of my screaming, tantrumy, unhappy kid whose behavior I can't reign in. Same with winning or losing disagreements/power struggles with my wife: winning garners an inflated ego and losing garners feeling like I'm her ""bitch"" (no misogamy intended). In discussing this with her recently, we've discovered that my behavior triggers issues she's had as a result of her controlling father. Unfortunately, we've fallen into a pattern of triggering each other with our respective compulsions. I hope we eventually improve in calling out these moments as they occur, instead of persisting with the tug-of-wars that typically ensue.

LifeAfterNarcissism,3c66a0,startingfromscratch2,3,Sun Jul 5 08:28:07 2015 UTC,"Well done for coming to understand that fear has been controlling you. Actually, up until now you have not existed - you've just been a collection of predictable behaviors triggered by fear.  To answer your question, I've tried CBT and found it a really useful way to begin questioning my unhealthy behaviors. Then I moved onto a psychodynamic therapist (Gestalt in my case) and this has worked well for me.   That said, I read a study that found the single most important factor in positive client outcomes was the strength of relationship between client and therapist. Therefore the best advice would be to find a therapist you feel comfortable working with and don't worry to much about what type.   Lastly, have you asked yourself the 'what then's and the 'how likely is this's about your fears? Your NParents raised you to believe that up is down and left is right, that you are unloveable and weak. But these things are lies. It's time to start questioning them...   I fear that I am weak. I fear that I am a pussy that can't stand up for himself.    How likely is it that you can't stand up for yourself?  If you are weak, what then? (If you are weak, will you die? Will the world end, will you be exhiled from all society? Don't think so.)    I fear that my wife will cheat/leave me.    How likely is this?  If she does cheat/leave you, what will happen then?  (I assume it will be unpleasant, but I'm pretty sure you will go on living. You might even meet someone else who makes you just as  happy. The world won't end is what I'm saying.)   I fear that my children will overpower me.    How likely is this? (I'm actually confused by this one - do you mean you are afraid they will try to kill you? This seems EXTREMELY unlikely.)  I guess the 'what then' would be that you'd be murdered by your kids because... reasons? (Go back to 'how likely is this?')   I fear that I am unloveable, undeserving of happiness or anything good...  And will lose everyone precious to me.    How likely is this? (Maybe you just think this because your Nfamily taught you to think this - cause they're sick) If you do lose everything precious, what then? Will you die? Will the world end? Will you be sad for a while? Will you eventually recover from the sadness? Will you find new precious things and people? (Speaking as someone who lost everything - you get over it, it can even be a blessing in disguise in some ways)  Ps   Change is the constant state."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3c66a0,SleepingManatee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:47:49 2015 UTC,"All excellent points. I've never looked at these fears in this particular way, and really appreciate this fresh approach. To clarify, I don't fear that my kids will try to kill me (although if my parenting doesn't improve, who can say). It's more of a fear that my children will eventually regard me as a joke who doesn't warrant respect and cease taking me seriously (like I felt about my enabler father)."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3c66a0,PrancerPrancer,2,Sun Jul 5 08:55:55 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. Thank you for being so open-minded and willing to take on board new ideas. You are clearly so ready for change and healing right now. Well done for getting yourself to this point, I too am just an internet stranger, but I'm proud of you.   This kind of questioning your fears is one of the things you can expect in CBT. But from a professional you'll get a much better, more nuanced kind of response!   It's something I use myself regularly. Like this morning I walked into work feeling incredibly anxious about a piece of work - catatastrophising and thinking I'm going to get fired. So I did the 'How likely is this?' 'Unmm well pretty unlikely actually'. And the 'what would happen if you did get fired?' 'Well SO and his family would look out for me, and I'd start applying for other jobs straightaway. I could even spend more time building up my own little business I run on the side. So it wouldn't be soooo bad if I did get fired'. It's a good littlle trick to practise for yourself I think.  Thanks for clarifying    a fear that my children will eventually regard me as a joke who doesn't warrant respect and cease taking me seriously.    Someone posted earlier about thinking about where we (ACONs) get our validation from.  The opposite to getting respect externally from your children would be to feel self-respect.    Respect is a funny word.  From the Latin 'Respicere' it just meant to look back at someone.  When you get to a place of being comfortable looking back at yourself, you don't require others to look back at you to know you still exist and are okay.    None of us can control anyone else, and more importantly, we shouldn't try to control anyone else. We only have (some!) control over ourselves. Your children are entitled to their own opinions and feelings. You may not like them, you may disagree with them, but you can't control them. And you can't control whether or not they respect you.   But you do have control over whether you respect yourself. This is something you can work on with a therapist. And believe me once you get it, it feels great.   Plus, think about people you know and respect. I'd bet they have plenty of self-respect, and that's one of the main reasons they command others' respect?  (Of course, this all sucks, because if our Nrents had raised us right we'd have self-respect and this wouldn't be an issue for any of us. But there it is.)"
LifeAfterNarcissism,3c66a0,choosedickz,3,Tue Jul 7 04:56:25 2015 UTC,"I fear that I am weak. I fear that I am a pussy who can't stand up for himself. I fear that my wife will cheat and/or leave me because of how weak and pathetic I am. I fear that my children will learn how weak I am, despise me and eventually overpower me. I fear that I am unloveable, undeserving of happiness or anything good, and will sooner or later lose everyone precious to me.   A childhood trauma specialist.  This fear you describe, it is fear, but a big part of it is shame.  What I read in that section of the post, is more shame-based than fear based.    I feel that way too.  I have anger issues. I feel that I am very weak.  Looking back at the situations that make me angry, a big reason I am so angry about those situations and at those people, is that I am angry at myself. When someone mistreats me, I get angry at them, but I get enraged at myself - because clearly, that person treated me badly because I let them.  When people treat me badly, or do anything that could remotely be taken as personal by me, I blame myself for it - big time.  I feel like I allow for people to mistreat me.   This is a fear, but what it really is for me, is shame.  To my core, I blame myself when people ""mistreat"" me, and because I have learned to take things so personally as a self-protective mechanism against the abuse, it is very easy for someone to, even very innocently and accidentally, make me feel that they have mistreated me, even if they have not, or had no intention of doing so.  But I take everything very personally, and I blame myself for their mistreatment, because if I am being mistreated, it is because I was weak enough to allow it to happen. I should have done this and I should have done that but instead I laid down like a doormat and I let them mistreat me.  This is a very, very common shame-based thought process stemming from abusive caregivers. As children, we naturally assume our caregivers are gods. Therefore, if they treat us badly, since gods cannot be wrong, it means that we are. We are wrong to our core, everything we are is wrong.  This spawns shame - the feeling we are inherently defective in some way. To a child the proof of this shame is how mistreated he/she is.  To an adult, the proof of this shame is how mistreated he/she is by anyone else, ever, for any reason, and in any small degree.  Once the shame is planted by the abuse, it stays, and then it grows, and every mis-step by another person towards you feeds that shame.  https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/?utm_source=PT_Psych_Today&utm_medium=House_Link&utm_campaign=PT_TopNavF_Therapist  A therapist specializing in childhood trauma is your best bet, it sounds like.  Cognitive behavioral therapy can help, but the shame you are describing is about emotional healing.  It cannot be helped by cognitive changes. This is probably why you have stagnated in your growth.  Cognitive behavioral therapy can help, but it can only do so much.  For me, this is what has helped:   A childhood trauma specialist therapist I have heard EMDR helps, (a type of treatment whereby people try to integrate your memories into your psyche more - I have heard great things, and it works on a deeper level than talk therapy, though it is not for everyone.) I've heard great things about schema therapy. I've done some myself, though limited, and it has been helpful to me. It is very helpful to me, and it has been shown to be helpful to others.  Meditation.  This has worked amazingly. After months of practice, I have gotten to a point where I can reach a deep state.  I can't really describe why it helps, I honestly don't know.  But I have struggled with this exact issue you are describing for years and years - my whole life.  And I worked at the cognitive level for 8 months, and saw no improvement on the shame level.  Then, I had been meditating already for four months, and I started getting really good at it.  I don't know how to describe how amazingly this helped me, but it took 8 days of meditation at this deep level for me to see an astounding difference.  For 8 days I felt - I actually felt the shame in my body, and I spent 8 really uncomfortable days with this feeling, and then it started to slowly lift. I am far from being away from the shame feeling, so I don't want to exaggerate and pretend it all went away.  But in 8 days of this meditation (I used binaural beats sometimes, but not always) I noticed, for the first time in 8 months, after 8 months of cognitive therapy with no discernible difference, a significant lifting of this feeling of shame.  I blame myself less harshly and less badly for the abuse of my parents, and I am hoping (fingers crossed) that in time I will feel less shame when others mistreat me.    The cognitive behavioral therapy has really helped me not to interpret every situation as ""mistreatment"" and to read malicious intentions into all the things and all the situations and all the people - which is a big step to not getting so angry all the time, as I used to misinterpret situations to assign malicious intent to everyone, and get angry over perceived mistreatments that were not intended or not even realized.  But the meditation has helped with the emotional aspect of healing. At its core, this is an emotional wound, and thinking will only get you so far.  EMDR works below the cognitive and thinking level as well."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3c66a0,choosedickz,3,Wed Jul 8 01:20:01 2015 UTC,"I'll second the rec for Schema therapy and meditation. Schema therapy alone was life changing. Psychoanalysis (which I was in for years) did not help me. In 2 years of Schema therapy I was a changed person and shed much of my fear, anger and need to control everything. I still battle seeing malicious intent in everyone but im aware that it's not rational or real, so I can notice and question it, which helps manage the effects of that distorted thinkIng. The meditation helps me maintain my equilibrium and ability to detach my thoughts from my emotions. It keeps me from spiraling into anxiety.   Good luck to you. It takes effort and a leap of faith to change."

I suppose the fear is in anticipation of the shame, which I'm trying to avoid at all costs. I have taken a meditation course, and am a believer in its benefits. I intend to resume meditation, and will be looking into the therapy options you've suggested (I'm particularly intrigued by schema therapy). I very much relate to the perspective that wrapping your brain around these issues can only take you so far. That's the point that I'm at right now. Forcing myself to be aware of things has helped me to control my reactions if I'm in the right frame of mind, but it simply doesn't go far enough: I'm still a mess emotionally, and need to heal so that I'm in the right frame of mind more often.

In my own healing I've found I can get my thinking right (I'm an okay human, I'm not disgusting, it's ok to have needs etc) but my feelings and core beliefs are stuck in the old ways and slow to catch up (I'm disgusting, unloveable, I can't have needs etc) .  This is okay when you've got time to think about your actions and motivations, but when under pressure you revert back to acting on your core beliefs.   That said, I've found that getting my thinkin healthy was the first step to changing my core beliefs. They just seem to be slow to catch up, and require a whole lot of evidence that the new way of thinking is actually safe!"

LifeAfterNarcissism,3c3y84,Glowing_Squid,8,Sat Jul 4 15:19:51 2015 UTC,I had a lot of issues with this in the past. I was very anxious about being judged. Having a highly critical ndad who would judge the fuck out of me made me think that everyone was out to watch me fail...because that was what he would do. He would wait until I made a 'mistake' (in his eyes) and then ambush me with a torrent of verbal (and sometimes physical) abuse.   One thing I learnt through therapy was that normal people - aka the majority of the world - did not actively look for ways to attack people. They either didn't care about what a stranger did or they were more likely to be sympathetic than mocking. I didn't need to be so defensive around people.   It's a really hard pattern to break. I still have issues with being a little too emotionally closed and I sometimes appear too aloof. However things are a lot better and I'm starting to feel more safe around others in general.

When you aren't occupied and the anxiety comes on, do you know what you are afraid will happen?   Figure that out, and then bit by bit practice spending a bit of time not occupied, just enough so you don't get overwhelmed, but enough time so you can check out afterwards what happened. Did the thing you are afraid of happen?  Slowly working at this you build up your comfort level for downtime.   It's worked for me. Though I didn't realize what I was doing til after!"

But I can't make good decisions when she feels so pressured to get in and get it done. So, I won't shop with her anymore because it's too stressful for me to be around her when she's on the 'go-go'.   She also has real trouble connecting with people, keeping friendships, or making new ones. She very rarely has friends or spends time with the ones who want to connect with her. I think as family she's more okay with me because she knows I will always be there, but even with me she has a hard time being herself and relaxing.

The truth can hurt and can at the same time eventually set us free. Forgive yourself. What you did came from a place of love and respect, what your dad did was likely the opposite.

AUUUGHHHH  At first I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe a actually did go out of his way and bought a car off one of his endless ""good ole boys"" to give to his daughter. That would have left me crestfallen enough, but at least it would have been a tolerable alternative.   But no, he just tells her to get a loan. :|  I'm hoping she comes around eventually. There is nothing I want more for her than for her to finally let go of seeking NDad's approval. I think those are the last big chains holding her down."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3c18l8,TheTartanDervish,3,Fri Jul 3 22:27:28 2015 UTC,"You did the right thing, not just ethically but emotionally. Sadly she's had 40 years of practise hoping Ndad will accept her - and the hope that tomorrow Ndad may finally change is addictive. Hugs to you both if wanted!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,3c18l8,m00ple,5,Sat Jul 4 10:14:11 2015 UTC,"You did the right thing. Sure it's painful for your sister now, but not nearly as painful as it would be if she believed your dad to be changed, only to discover later that he isn't AND that you hid that from her.  Incidentally, your NDad is a c**t and you were wonderful to your sister both in wanting to give her the money and in telling her the truth of the situation."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3c18l8,m00ple,3,Fri Jul 3 22:03:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I've been thinking about this a lot and how sad she was. I know she needs to let go of trying to live up to our NDad's expectations and have him finally love her, but the only way I've found that he's EVER shown anyone any love or respect is by ignoring him, respecting yourself, and becoming independent (for me, I had to go LC/NC).   I think I'm going to give her the money anyway. I know it's what she needs the most and I was going to help pay for her new vehicle. If she uses it for the vehicle, for food, or even for something for herself, I know it'll give her a bit of cushion to help her get through her last semester of college."
LifeAfterNarcissism,3c18l8,nheddie,6,Fri Jul 3 22:19:24 2015 UTC,You are absolutely right about your dad. I have no doubt your sister will really appreciate the gift from you. She's lucky to have you looking out for her.

LifeAfterNarcissism,3c18l8,TheTartanDervish,3,Sat Jul 4 04:54:20 2015 UTC,"I'm the SG sister in my family. And speaking from a place that's very similar to your sister's, you did the right thing. I'm poor, stay at home mom to two kids. My husband barley makes enough to get by. I went to a crack-pot trade school and owe more money than I've ever made in my whole life. And for the longest time, I didn't realize that I was the SG for my family. I think it really hit home when I had my second child, and I called my Nmom to ask her to bring my eldest child to the hospital to see me. I was bleeding out, and they were prepping me to go into the OR to try and sew me up. She told me she was too tired, and had a spa appointment the next morning, and hung up. Then, a week later, she refused to get off work early to take me in to get a blood transfusion that I needed.   So, in short, it's better to figure this out over a car, than when you really need someone and they're not there. The best thing you can do is be there to be supportive of her."

I have the same thing in me too, where I know I should be proud of my accomplishments, but then that feeling will be followed by some sort of terrifying fear. When we carry shame, pride feels uncomfortable.  I'm reminded of the quote from the movie Coach Carter, originally from Marianne Williamson:  ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. It's not just in some of us, it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others"""

Sadly, after 9 years of dealing with the VA and especially since ACA started, I'm used to the whole ""delay/deny until they die"" thing. Some friends are encouraging me to do an online fundraiser (that'd be super-painful emotionally for me, though) and my doctors are writing angry letters to the VA and the insurance about ""Tartan's working her ass off to get better and you keep sabotaging her, are you fuckwitted or just evil?""

LifeAfterNarcissism,3bv5ia,jojotoughasnails,5,Wed Jul 8 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"Red flags:  (1) intense relationship off the bat  (2) comes out with a pity story right out the door (average people keep their skeletons hidden until another earns the privilege of seeing them)  (3) easily discards you without a second thought  (4) still hangs with his ex's? sounds like he has supply (if one fails, he flocks to another) (5) you sound very codependent (not knocking you because if you don't have a lot of experience with relationships - I'm right there with you - then chances are you don't have strong boundaries, which is a BIG flashing vacancy sign that narcs/psychopaths like to fill)  My advice? Regardless of what he is, walk away before you get hurt even more. I was personally inept at developing or maintaining relationships for quite some time (still working on that bit) because my parents never parented me. I.e. never provided a loving, nurturing, comforting, or secure environment with which to develop in a healthy and balanced manner. My Nmom was especially helpful with that (sarcasm).    I met a girl about 6 months ago and we hit it off pretty well, although I immediately noticed there was a power imbalance since she was even more codependent than me. I was honestly afraid that I would abuse her because I was still working on a lot of things to get to where I am now, but I was highly dysfunctional when I consider how far I've come along. My response? Cold turkey. She would text me constantly and I would respond minimally until she finally stopped altogether. It wasn't the best way of handling things, but I figured that was better than leading her on into her own personal hell. I could never have forgiven myself if I hurt her anymore than I already had. :/   If you spend more time working on yourself to the point where you can feel comfortable being alone, you honestly won't need anyone to validate your value and worth as an individual. Now I'm not suggesting that you isolate yourself...please don't! But I am suggesting that you build your confidence so that you can fill another's cup as much as another will fill yours. Even-Stevens will be the result, and you'll be able to leave someone like the guy you just mentioned without feeling the sting as you have.   Not to mention that you'll attract someone who has healthy boundaries and will thus be healthy in both mind and body. Stay away from the dysfunctional ones...  Many blessings and best wishes to you!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,3bv5ia,MuffinFuhrer,2,Thu Jul 2 18:25:34 2015 UTC,"Sure sounds like it!  ""Some issues"" doesn't begin to sum it up.

LifeAfterNarcissism,3bv5ia,Beatrixa,2,Thu Jul 2 13:51:11 2015 UTC,"Whether he's a narcissist or has some FLEAS (check sidebar for meaning of fleas) , or there is something else going on with him, he clearly doesn't think other peoples feelings are important at all.  And that is all there is to understand about this: He behaves this way because he feels no remorse or guilt for behaving this way.   He sees something he wants and he takes it. The girl he's dating is away in Europe and he's bored and lonely, he gets back in touch with that girl he was seeing 5 months ago. She gets mad with him for being a cheater, he can't deal with how that feels so he blocks her and moves onto someone else. He's completely controlled by his feelings and his need for attention, and no one else matters to him.   Sometimes we get involved in relationships with people like this because we are actually trying to heal a much older wound. This mans behavior may be similar to someone else important in your life  who hurt you. That might be why it feels so familiar, exciting, intimate and you 'can't stop thinking about him'."

I don't think he had a personality disorder, he was just spectacularly immature emotionally.  He loved the drama of relationships, and typically had three going at once -- one developing, one breaking up and one in the middle.  This gave him the constant adrenaline surge of falling in love, breaking up, and of course sneaking around trying not to get caught.   And then he was hurt when I said, ""No, we are not still friends.  Why would I be friends with someone who lies and cheats and cares nothing about other people's feelings?""  Hmmm.  Maybe he is a narcissist.  Relationships that start off super intense in the beginning usually turn out to be flawed.  I would consider that a big red flag.  Also, he's roommates with his ex?  An unusual arrangement.  I'll bet she thought they were more than roommates, and then he got busted for seeing you so he cut it off.  Sorry to be all suspicious, but liars lie."
