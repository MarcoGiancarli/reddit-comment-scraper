whatsthisbird,3e41o4,Solidity,4,Tue Jul 21 20:07:12 2015 UTC,"matrixkid29 got the first two.   The third one is tough. I believe it's a juvenile Savannah Sparrow. The lighting makes its beak look thinner and less sparrow-like than it actually is, it's holding its crown feathers flat which makes its profile look odd, and it hasn't fully grown in its bright yellow lores, but otherwise it fits Savannah well.  The last one is an immature Common Yellowthroat - no eye ring, wing bars, or other marks, plain olive above, yellow below brightest on throat.  Fantastic photos, by the way. What equipment did you use?"
whatsthisbird,3e41o4,tinfixture,3,Tue Jul 21 21:41:51 2015 UTC,Thanks! I use a Canon 7d Mark II body and I'm renting a Canon 300mm f/2.8 IS II from Lensrentals. com.  Normally I shoot with a Tamron 150-600mm.
whatsthisbird,3e41o4,tinfixture,3,Tue Jul 21 22:30:17 2015 UTC,I figured you used something <f5.6 to get that great background blurring. Coincidentally I rented from LensRentals.com for the first time last month - a Nikon 300mm f4 - and was very impressed by how smoothly the transaction went.

whatsthisbird,3e44x0,midnighttycoon,4,Tue Jul 21 21:05:40 2015 UTC,"the tl;dr of /u/midnighttycoon's message was this: that's a fledge, belongs in the wild, it'll learn to fly, it needs to be attended to by its parents right now.  the longer it's away from its parents, the less likely it is that they'll recognize it as their own fledge and accept it (their brains are only so big!). if you can, please return it to the place you found it as soon as possible. doubly so: if you can stick around for an hour or two to see if adults come to attend it, even better! if you observe that, you know it's safe, sound, and cared for.  if you can't bring it back, or if you observe it for >1-2 hours and no adults come, it needs to get taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center ASAP.   if neither of those options are available right away, please give it a juicy protein friendly to birds (like mealworms) until you can hand it in to a rehabilitation center.  your intentions are pure and good! but as /u/midnighttycoon mentioned, please get familiar with the link on the sidebar and learn how to recognize fledges so you're not accidentally taking them from their parents at a really crucial stage. :)  edit: the squeaking sounds are it begging to be fed by its folks, and since it's only been out of the nest for a day or two, it's just not ready to fly quite yet!  also, more than anything - THANK YOU for asking here and checking in, and having the bird's best intentions at heart. that's so wonderful! I know you'll do the right thing, and I'm so glad that you did something that you felt was right (given what you saw) but wanted to know more, rather than just stick a baby bird in a cage and try to tend to it without educating yourself more. that curiosity and care for wildlife makes all the difference!!"

whatsthisbird,3dy9hn,didyouwoof,2,Mon Jul 20 18:47:46 2015 UTC,"Welcome to birding, OP!  One of the things you should look at when trying to identify a bird is its bill.  Look in your field guide (or allaboutbirds.org) and compare the bills of the Red-winged Blackbird and the House Finch.  Red-winged Blackbirds are primarily insectivores, and a long narrow bill can be helpful when trying to pluck a bug from a plant.  House  Finches are primarily seed-eaters, and a really thick bill helps them crack even the hardest of shells.  There are some really good books that teach how to go about identifying a bird (because plumage isn't always the best field mark).  Sibley's Birding Basics and National Geographic's Birding Essentials are two that come to mind."

(Clearly, that needs to change.) This is gonna be hard without photos, too.  It looks like Gannets can turn up in Barcelona, though it's surprising to me that you'd be able to see them from the beach since they're usually farther out. Young birds are mottled brown and white, and it's the right time for young to disperse to weird locations, so that's not impossible. Gannets are huge, too, they have like a 5-foot wingspan, so I wouldn't rule them out based on size. So overall, that sounds possible but I can't really be a hundred percent sure without photos - though you're right, not much else would be nose-diving.  For the tern, did you get the bill color at all? Was the size similar to Common? Sandwich Terns look a lot like darker, black-billed Common Terns, and seem a likely bet to me given that they seem to be abundant around Barcelona according to what I'm finding online.  As for a smaller, daintier black-headed gull, Sabine's might work - Mediterranean is too big. Sabine's should only be breeding farther north, though, and I'm having a hard time finding out how often breeding individuals come down south to Spain, which is a normal wintering area but not so normal for summer.  So, I don't know. Have some suggestions, have a look through your books and see if they match what you saw, but I can't ID these from your description alone. There are a lot of seabirds that just look so similar to each other that you'd really need photos for me to be certain."

They were a mottled dark above and white colour below with a patchy brown ""band"" around upper breast. I have had experience with Little Gulls, and they're insanely small- I think they would be smaller even than a Common Tern. Who knows. Thanks for your help thiough!

whatsthisbird,3ddz7d,wanderingfalcon,2,Fri Jul 17 14:19:10 2015 UTC,"Hi!  We were just in NE Spain doing a lot of birding around Barcelona/Ebro Delta. Every black-headed type gull we saw was a Mediterranean, so just from commonness alone that's probably most likely and they aren't really that big. For terns which are larger, we had Sandwich, Common, Gull-billed and Whiskered (missed Caspian). When you say darker, it makes me think Whiskered which has an overall grey look, but we mainly saw them in the more marshy or rice-field areas. You do really need to see the bill color and shape.   If you can get down to the Ebro, it's well worth it.  Otherwise the reserves in Delta del Llobregat near the airport are supposed to also be good. Be on the lookout for Adouin's Gull. Happy to send you some excerpts from the Birding Catalunya book if you don't have it for more particular directions; Barcelona is a maze."

It seemed not to be quite as dark as a Whiskered and the habitat was indeed wrong. I would reeaalllyy live to bird the Llobregat Delta, it seems like it would be amazing, but first of all it's far away and I ain't got no car, and second of all my binoculars got busted halfway through this six-month trip!

whatsthisbird,3da4zx,TinyLongwing,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:57:47 2015 UTC,Bill looks a little heavy for a pipit. Whole body is pretty chunky. Head is too big. Pipit would have separate/defined streaks on the breast and well down the flanks.       Aberrantly plumed robins and weirdly colored photographs are both reasonably common.        I think mis-colored robin is the simpler explanation. Plumage variation within range for robin is easier for me to swallow than plumage and body structure and range variation for pipit.

It also loses the diagnostic dark malar stripe seen in Winter Plumage. This bird could possibly be in some awkward molt. eBird shows no sightings of Pipit for a while, so it would definitely be phenomenally odd. I just can't think of anything else it could be."
whatsthisbird,3da4zx,JoaoBinda,3,Tue Jul 14 20:43:07 2015 UTC,They look like Robins...maybe partially leucistic? Or the traffic line may have played tricks on the camera. Did they have orange bellies IRL?

whatsthisbird,3d8x9z,midnighttycoon,10,Tue Jul 14 13:34:30 2015 UTC,"Mourning Doves are a native species (I'm assuming you are in the USA), so removal of their nest is against the Migratory Bird Act.

Heck, you could walk right up to one while in the nest, look him in the eye, and he would just sit there with a ""Please don't eat me"" look on his face. Sitting nearby will definitely stress them out, but it's possible that if you go out often, they might get used to you and accept you aren't a threat.   Basically, by going out you will stress them, but as long as you aren't making super loud noises and waving your arms like a madman, they will be okay. Be aware though, Mourning Doves like to come back year after year to nest in the same place. If this nest is successful, you might have the same individuals coming back to nest again next year, and the year after, and so on. Name them and have fun!

When I get to the end of the porch, I am just going to move the entire coat rack down into the garden beside of the shrub/tree. (if you look at the second picture above you'll see the bush I'm talking about)  After that, I'm not sure, I guess I'll just have to worry about it when I get there.  I took a few more pictures of the bird as well, I'll post them when I get home."

On top of that, you're looking at fledge - the pale, fleshy skin at the corner of its mouth is a gape, meaning it's still begging from its parents for food; its tail is a little short of the adult length; its contour feathers are a little puffier than an adult's would be (a banding instructor I once had always referred to young catbirds having ""fluffy trousers""). :)"

Adults actually have a really deep, rich, ruby color - so dark that it looks almost black from a distance. Juvies like this guy have much paler eyes. While eye color changing is obvious in some species (red-eyed vireo; grackles; thrashers), it's not as apparent in others, like this guy! You're also right about the cap in adults being much crisper, darker, and better-defined than in juvies. Nice job! :)"

whatsthisbird,3d380w,falcoperegrinus82,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:11:29 2015 UTC,"Tricky situation. Relocating the nest will almost certainly cause the adults to abandon; I would definitely advise against that. People coming in and out is also likely to cause abandonment especially since the nest is only in incubation stage. Plus, it looks pretty precarious and could easily get knocked off with people opening/closing the door. I would just avoid using that door. Is there another door people could use? I would just inform people ahead of time to not use that door."

There is a door in the back porch, but the porch is fenced in which requires you to ""hop"" over the fence.

Really at this distance it's a guess at best.   Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks are some of the few spp whose numbers have increased with time in urban environments due to the very item you have in your back yard. Many will stalk out feeders, waiting for the right birds to come through, and take them out. Oh well, I'm still a supporter of bird feeders and my local songbird populations!  The lying down behavior is new to me. Very cool shot for that reason!"
whatsthisbird,3d0fy7,liesliesfromtinyeyes,10,Sun Jul 12 14:25:58 2015 UTC,recent fledglings will often lay down rather than standing up.  this behavior will last usually a week or two and then they will not tend to do it.
whatsthisbird,3d0fy7,sciendias,3,Sun Jul 12 15:02:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation! I suppose it makes sense since they've been lying down in the nest until that point.

In raptors or vultures, it's not uncommon to see flight feathers (or patches of flight feathers) completely white. I feel like for contour feathers, as in this robin, it can run the gamut from just one or two feathers, to a spattering as in this guy, to patches, to complete leucism.

whatsthisbird,3cokmq,AccipiterF1,6,Thu Jul 9 15:31:20 2015 UTC,"Common Grackle. You can tell by its really long tail, and long thick beak. It's the only Grackle found in Vermont.  Brewer's Blackbirds are a western species that has never been found in Vermont. Rusty Blackbirds can be found in migration, and nesting in small numbers in the Northeast Kingdom. They are a smaller bird with a shorter tail and and sharp, thin beak.   Edit: Thin, not think."
whatsthisbird,3cn1h5,deevee_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:26:05 2015 UTC,Looks like a Turquoise-browed Motmot to me.
whatsthisbird,3cn1h5,mustaphamondo,3,Thu Jul 9 05:19:45 2015 UTC,Turquoise-browed Motmot   I think you're right! I just looked through other pictures and saw the racketed tail peeking out behind the leaves. Thanks!
whatsthisbird,3cn1h5,falcoperegrinus82,11,Thu Jul 9 05:27:00 2015 UTC,It's actually a Blue-diademed Motmot.
whatsthisbird,3cn1h5,hotspotbirding,2,Thu Jul 9 05:49:29 2015 UTC,Have they been officially spilt from  blue crowned?
whatsthisbird,3cn1h5,ruk_hai,2,Thu Jul 9 13:20:22 2015 UTC,"The whole motmot situation is a mess, I don't even follow it anymore. I have the 1st edition of the ProAves guide to Birds of Colombia, which shows 6 Motmots. The 2nd edition has 5 different species, all of which have been named differently.   that said, I believe Blue-crowned and Blue-diademed haven't been split yet."
whatsthisbird,3cn1h5,cuginhamer,3,Thu Jul 9 13:56:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. From eBird:      Blue-crowned Motmot - This used to be considered a single widespread species, but has now been split into five species. Fortunately, range can be used to figure out which one you saw.  Below are the ranges of the new species of motmots:     Trinidad Motmot (Momotus bahamensis) - Trinidad and Tobago only Whooping Motmot (Momotus subrufescens) - central Panama east to w Venezuela and south (west of Andes) to nw Peru. Blue-crowned Motmot (Momotus coeruliceps) - Mexico to western Panama ONLY; NOTE: this species no longer occurs south/east of extreme western Panama! Amazonian Motmot (Momotus momota) - Amazonian forest of South America Andean Motmot (Momotus aequatorialis) - Subtropical Andes of Colombia and e Ecuador to subtropical e Peru"
whatsthisbird,3cn1h5,hotspotbirding,3,Thu Jul 9 15:55:40 2015 UTC,"Blue-crowned Motmot   So it looks like: * AOU - does not recognize the 5 as difference species   The eBird Taxonomy - does recognize as 5 species The International Ornithological Congress - does recognize 5 species  BirdLife Taxonomic Checklist v7.0 - does recognize 5 species Clements Checklist - does not recognize 5 species Does anybody have access to Burt L. Monroe, Jr., and Charles G. Sibley A World Checklist of Birds?   So the big question is which checklist do you follow? I know most North America Birders follow the AOU, but if one is more interested in international birding which checklist is most recognizable as correct?"
whatsthisbird,3cn1h5,cuginhamer,2,Thu Jul 9 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"Does anybody have access to Burt L. Monroe, Jr., and Charles G. Sibley A World Checklist of Birds?   Monroe and Sibley's checklist is from the 1990s, so I would assume that it would have them lumped, since this 5 way split became a popular idea more recently.      This thread starts with asking if the blue-diademed (lessoni) vs. blue-crowned (coeruleiceps) split is official, which is separate from asking about separating off the other four (bahamensis, subrufescens, momota, aequatorialis). That split makes blue crowned into 5, but keeps blue-diademed lumped in with the newly-more-narrowly-defined blue-crowned, based on the work of  Stiles 2009, which was accepted by the South American branch of the AOU in 2010 but not the North American branch.       Regardless, none of these are treating blue-diademed as a separate species from blue-crowned, even though Stiles discusses the possibility in the same article (not forcefully).       So the big question is which checklist do you follow? I know most North America Birders follow the AOU, but if one is more interested in international birding which checklist is most recognizable as correct?       The sense that I get is that it really comes down to regional authorities and recently published studies on each taxonomic group, and thus there is no well-accepted world-wide standard. Considering it's all arbitrary imposition of discrete/categorical constructs on quantitative shades of variation, it doesn't matter much in the end. I'm looking forward to the day when we have full genome sequences of many thousands of individuals of every species and we can assign a quantitative indicator of genetic divergence to every degree of separation on the family tree of birds, and thus use that as a score to indicate the ""speciesness"" or ""subspeciesness"" of each name we give a group of similar looking birds."
whatsthisbird,3cn1h5,hotspotbirding,2,Thu Jul 9 17:30:22 2015 UTC,"but we all agree it's not a Turquoise-browed Motmot, right?  | Considering it's all arbitrary imposition of discrete/categorical constructs on quantitative shades of variation...  Hey i know some of those words! Thanks for the explanation. The reason I ask is as a North American who considers oneself as an international birder i'd like to use a single consistent list. I suppose i'll just pick at random until there is an authority on the matter."
whatsthisbird,3cn1h5,cuginhamer,2,Thu Jul 9 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"Of course it's not t-b, but blue crowned, the question is whether two subspecies of blue crowned should be split into blue crowned and blue diademed.  I like ebird as the central world authority, personally, which means Clements, which means people at Cornell will curate all the regional lists and decide what to go with."

Also I don't believe water is good for them at that age but I could be wrong.   Also as for identifying it, perhaps a mockingbird? I'm terrible with fluffy little guys like this.   Edit: if you literally just found I'd try going where it was found and seeing if the parents are still nearby."

whatsthisbird,3co45r,drink_your_tea,5,Thu Jul 9 13:20:11 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it's a fledge, meaning it left the nest because it was ready to-- you can tell because it's fully feathered, even its wings.  Birds will never abandon their nest, eggs, nestlings, or fledglings as a result of humans touching them. That doesn't mean that humans should touch a nest's contents or baby birds, of course! :) It's just a silly myth that's unfortunately been perpetuated.  Glad to hear it's eating, but the best option for feeding it really is to return it to where it last was; the adults will come feed it as soon as they hear it begging. The sooner you put it back, the better. Take it away for too long, and the adults will think it died and will stop looking for it, and my refuse to feed it even once it's in the area again, since they won't recognize it as their own ""dead"" fledge.  I know you had good intentions! But the best advice is just to leave baby birds where they are in the future. :) For future reference, check out the stickied post at the top of the homepage that details what to do with baby birds at what age."

But when he saw the parents coming back to feed the baby a while after we put it back he was happy and understood we did the right thing, I think he learned something from this.  Thanks for all the info, I saw the stickied post when I came here and read throguh the essentials but I didn't want to lose any time so I posted my request immediately anyway.

whatsthisbird,3clsvj,Drunken_mascot,2,Wed Jul 8 22:19:30 2015 UTC,"I think they are some kind of finch or swallow. I really have no clue... I almost ran them over with the lawnmower when I seen one of the parents run out. I thought it was just an injured bird because it wasn't flying away it was just hopping. So I went to continue mowing... Then I thought huh... Maybe there is a nest in there...  So I had a peek and there they were, 4(?) little ones just chilling in the grass. Are they going to be okay if I leave them alone?"
whatsthisbird,3clsvj,sciendias,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:22:21 2015 UTC,"First - awesome instinct on the nest being there.  They are a little too young for me to get an ID - but where are you? That will help narrow it down.  They should be fine if you leave them, and for these guys likely will be flying in another 7-12 days.  The more often you visit the more likely other things will be to discover the nest (e.g., squirrels, raccoons, etc.) that might eat the chicks."
whatsthisbird,3clsvj,skvw,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:03:34 2015 UTC,"I'm in northern Alberta, Canada. And thanks!  The way the parent was running away,  instead of flying,  made me feel like it was trying to draw attention away from a nest. I just showed them to my gf so I'll have to tell her to keep away from them for now,  which might be hard for her cause she thinks they are the most adorable things in the world right now haha. Thank you for the advice!"
whatsthisbird,3clsvj,skvw,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:08:27 2015 UTC,I bet they are robins.  They should be fine if you can avoid mowing in that spot until they leave the nest. They are growing feathers so they have been there long enough to know they will be as okay as you can reasonably expect from nature anyway.   I am not an expert in identifying these birds though so I could be wrong. I am pretty sure they are fine right there though and should be fledging fairly soon.

whatsthisbird,3cllad,drink_your_tea,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:04:26 2015 UTC,"it's with its mom, right? the background of the picture looks a little like a cardboard box, and I just want to make sure that the fledge is with its parents, as it should be :) we just see a lot of posts of people taking ""abandoned"" baby birds and trying to take care of them, when they're actually fledges and are more than ready to be out in the world with their parents, so I get a little paranoid!"
whatsthisbird,3cllad,drink_your_tea,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:10:00 2015 UTC,We aren't messing with it.  The mother comes into the box and is caring for it. We are hoping it will be able to fly away in a couple weeks.
whatsthisbird,3cllad,drink_your_tea,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:16:59 2015 UTC,"You can leave it out of the box! :) In fact, being in the box might be dampening its attempts to fly. I've worked on a bunch of nesting bird research projects, and all babies are awkward and pretty flightless the first day or two after they fledge. After that, though, they need to actively test their wings, and the parents will lead the fledge to a place they think is safe. I know your intentions are pure, and I'm glad to hear the adult is still in attendance - I just wanted to add my 2¢ about the fact that human intervention really isn't necessary here. Most fledges make it just fine on their own!"

whatsthisbird,3ci90e,Nuthatch95,7,Wed Jul 8 03:44:33 2015 UTC,"The color of the throat really depends on the angle you see it from, and it's probably a male, who show little to no green. It's really the only hummingbird that fits and the only one that goes very far north. Pretty cool though!"
whatsthisbird,3ci90e,liesliesfromtinyeyes,6,Wed Jul 8 04:03:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what reference you're working from but Allen's are the more green of the two closely-related species. Rufous, true to name, often show little to no green on the body. The lack of red on the throat could be a function of the angle of viewing (often remarkably invisible until they turn to you) or due to maturity/sparring with other males. In WA the assumed species of the two is Rufous, as they're many, many times more prevalent. Happy birding!"
whatsthisbird,3ci90e,falcoperegrinus82,4,Wed Jul 8 04:08:31 2015 UTC,"Almost certainly a Rufous, which is nearly identical to Allen's. They are to be expected in your area especially around this time of year as they begin southward migration."

whatsthisbird,3ci9d9,UnifiedAwakening,5,Wed Jul 8 02:58:46 2015 UTC,"Ok I was weeding the patio and found him/her. Young as hell. Feet are reddish, possibly blood. Poor thing looks pretty rough. Doesn't make noise but is alive and moving. In a container filled with pieces of paper towel. I sat the little fella upright the best I could and helped support his head a bit.   I initially thought it may have had a broken neck but the little guy can move his head around. It's colder this evening so I figured if it will die I would prefer to have it die warm.   It was getting dark fast so I decided to leave it in the garage overnight protected and looking more tomorrow. The squirrel feeder that is attached to the deck is completely fixed, enclosed and only has a small hole, that I assume a squirrel made at one time which allows the adult bird to fly in and out.   I checked that nest just prior to sundown and there are no babies at all. It's a small nest and the bird that lives there is pretty small also. Unless the parent bird pushed this baby out and had moved it across the yard at a distance, I doubt it came from that nest.   Tomorrow I will be checking for more nests in the trees and surrounding area.   Anyone know what kind of bird it could be?"
whatsthisbird,3ci9d9,vaqari,12,Wed Jul 8 03:18:59 2015 UTC,"Baby birds can't survive long without feeding, and he already looks thin and dehydrated.  I'd look into finding a wildlife rehabber in your area."

whatsthisbird,3ci9d9,drink_your_tea,7,Tue Jul 14 04:52:08 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what kind of bird this is, but for as young as it is, it's probably totally normal for it to not have much of a posture. Very young birds are pretty much all kinds of floppy, for lack of a better term. I hope someone can help with an ID!"
whatsthisbird,3ci9d9,drink_your_tea,3,Wed Jul 8 04:11:33 2015 UTC,"Too young to ID just yet, especially without know what the nest it came from looks like. That's really too bad! He's really, really young - probably hatched 1-2 days ago, and has no strength/muscle control to hold himself up.   Get him to a rehabber ASAP, but in the meantime, keep him warm! Birds run at warmer temperatures than humans, and even in a box with paper towel, he's going to lose temperature really, really rapidly. If you have a heat lamp, a bright desk lamp, and/or an electric blanket, please use those. It'll really help. And if you can encourage him to eat some meal worms, caterpillars, worms - that'll help too.   I know you posted 17 hrs ago so I'm worried he's already gone :\ But really, really young nestlings like this require a lot of attention from their parents, and the odds were stacked against him as soon as he fell out of the nest. Fingers crossed!"

whatsthisbird,3cgrsv,Blitzkrieg_My_Anus,19,Tue Jul 7 20:04:01 2015 UTC,American coot! The babies are covered in crazy colorful fluff before the sleek adult plumage comes in; the orange feathers that you see are the last of that. :)
whatsthisbird,3cgrsv,drink_your_tea,5,Tue Jul 7 20:25:01 2015 UTC,yes the feet give it away!
whatsthisbird,3cgrsv,ratlicker3000,3,Tue Jul 7 21:48:27 2015 UTC,"feet + range! Common Gallinules are similar, though the chicks aren't as brightly fluffy - I had a moment of doubt, to be honest, in part based on the beak color in the picture :) But I double-checked the range, and common gallinules only occur in the southeastern-most portion of Canada.  But since Coots are so darn common, and those little toes are unmistakable, the feet are almost diagnostic!"
whatsthisbird,3cgrsv,drink_your_tea,2,Tue Jul 7 21:51:53 2015 UTC,what part of the bird is called a range?
whatsthisbird,3cgrsv,ratlicker3000,5,Wed Jul 8 00:56:53 2015 UTC,"range refers to its geographic distribution :)  for example, American coots have a really extensive range in North and Central America, but don't occur in South America. in contrast, common gallinules are more limited in the Northern hemisphere, but also are common in parts of South America.   thanks for asking! always makes me happy that people are seeking to learn more :)"

whatsthisbird,3cgrsv,ratlicker3000,2,Wed Jul 8 01:56:08 2015 UTC,"These are hands-down the weirdest looking baby birds I've ever seen, and that includes Gouldian Finches."
whatsthisbird,3cgrsv,Emby,3,Wed Jul 8 00:13:21 2015 UTC,"Oh man, you'd love this!   Lyon, Bruce et al. (September 1994). ""Parental choice selects for ornamental plumage in American Coot chicks"". Nature 371 (6494): 240–242.    And there's this weird thing that happens with coots where the parents prefer the first-hatched chicks, and antagonistically treat all others - to the point of attacking and drowning them. They're thought to imprint on the first chicks, and the first eggs laid tend to have brighter-colored chicks inside. The catch is that egg-dumping or brood parasitism is really prevalent in coots, with females actively seeking out other ladies' nests and trying to lay the first eggs therein... Dai Shizuka has done some really cool work with this!  Also, baby Gouldians have crazy mouths. Wow. I'd never seen pictures of them before, and while there's still definitely some shock value, I can't say I'm all that surprised - I'd seen diagrams similar to this one in textbooks before.   And - ok, so I'm off on a tangent here - did you know that depending on cuckoo species, they either imitate host nestlings' begging calls or their gapes (or both)? It's amazing. And - on top of that - some cuckoos have added extra stimuli to encourage an even greater feeding response from their hosts: for example, one species of cuckoo has a patch on its WING that mimics a host nestling's gape, so the parents respond to twice the visual stimuli and feed twice as much! Snippet of that story here.  Man, baby birds are so cool. I'm only a little bit obsessed :3"
whatsthisbird,3cgrsv,drink_your_tea,3,Wed Jul 8 00:24:40 2015 UTC,"I'd read those things about baby cuckoos, but wow am I glad I am not a baby coot. Why, why are they adapted to hate their youngest babies? I had no idea these birds were so weird."
whatsthisbird,3cgrsv,Emby,3,Wed Jul 8 00:31:37 2015 UTC,"Hard to tell! One working hypothesis is a product of the fact that egg-dumping is so common, but  the nest female usually gets to lay at least the first egg, that gives the first-hatched chicks preferential treatment and usually means that the parents are supporting the survival of one or two of their own chicks, and not anybody else's. But of course, it doesn't always work that way; sometimes another female gets there first and then the pair attacks their own natural young :(  From Dai's work, it's like birds that experience brood parasitism (for a decent amount of evolutionary time) are either good at recognizing and/or acting against foreign eggs, or foreign nestlings, but not both. So really, a female leaves her nest while it's empty, returns and there's an egg or two in it, and her mind says ""________"". But then once the eggs hatch, her mind says ""FIRST HATCHED YOUNG ONLY! EWW, YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE MY FIRST HATCHED YOUNG! DEATH!"" or something to that effect.  Maybe not that dramatic, but... you know.  So it's a ""strategy"" that works enough of the time to persist... or will always persist so long as the same females that reject their own young are successful at egg-dumping in other females' nests.  Man oh man! ornithology is so great :D  edit: all science is so great :D but I'm familiar with biology more than the other sciences, and within that I love wildlife bio, and within that I'm best at ornithology so....bias!!"
whatsthisbird,3cgrsv,drink_your_tea,3,Wed Jul 8 00:39:55 2015 UTC,"That does make a degree of sense. I'm reminded of parasitism in ducks and the ways they compensate by decreasing laying. Goldeneye ducks appear sort of able to quantify how many eggs they are supposed to have, but they don't seem to be able to count exactly how many. I have a feeling the same applies for number of ducklings, based on having seen individual broods of waterfowl slowly shrink due to predation.  ""Yeaaah, that looks like about the number of babies I have"" versus ""Wait, I have A Lot of babies and this is Not A Lot of babies, where are my babies???"""
whatsthisbird,3cgrsv,Emby,3,Wed Jul 8 01:12:45 2015 UTC,"Various parrots seem to know how many eggs they've laid.  Owners of broody females are told not to take any eggs away until the female abandons them, as she'll lay to replace the missing ones.  This only seems to work one way though--if you dump a bunch of fake eggs into her nest, she'll usually stop laying and start sitting.  Bird reproduction is fun."
whatsthisbird,3cgrsv,vaqari,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:34:10 2015 UTC,"Many songbirds lay a fixed number of eggs, too!  But as for parrots in general, I have little doubt that many of those guys are actually able to count, even if that's not what's going on with egg-laying cues. Birds are weird and cool."

I'm so used to seeing them I don't think of them as being bizarre looking but I guess to the average person they would be!  I feel like the strangest I've ever seen are the Purple Grenadier hatchlings. Their skin is almost black and their nodules are bright blue-ish purple. They're incredibly difficult to breed and even Society Finches have a hard time fostering them because they're just so bizarre looking.

Its absolute best chance is back in the nest with its parents.  If you can't find the nest, or it has been destroyed, then secondhandtoy is right -- google wild bird rehabilitation in your area; there will be several certified volunteers who will gladly take the bird for you (and do this as soon as possible; most baby birds need to eat often and will deteriorate very quickly without the proper care).

whatsthisbird,3cajzb,Tekinette,2,Mon Jul 6 11:53:21 2015 UTC,"No idea what bird this is and what I should do about it. I saw it flapping its wings on the ground in order to move, it's now just staying there, didn't move when I came close to take the picture. No idea if there's any number in Paris to rescue birds.  Update : Ok I believe it's a Swift, apparently they fly at high altitude and have very short legs which is why they don't walk but use their wings to move around. Their legs are so short that apparently it's not guarenteed they'll manage to take off, so I'm guessing it was resting in order to have the strength to fly away as I don't see it anymore...   Unless it's hiding really well somewhere I can't find it anymore, would be nice if someone could confirm that it was indeed old enough to fly and I shouldn't worry anymore."
whatsthisbird,3cajzb,ruk_hai,6,Mon Jul 6 11:56:03 2015 UTC,Common Swift is correct. What you read about the Swifts not always being able to take off is also correct. You can tell if a bird is a fledgling by the yellow corners of the  mouth they have. This bird definitely looks like it's able to fly so I wouldn't worry about it.
whatsthisbird,3cajzb,mievaan,3,Mon Jul 6 13:27:25 2015 UTC,"Indeed a swift. It does look old enough to fly, the feathers look quite fully developed. Swifts have a hard time getting off from the ground though so it is unlikely it just flew off. But don't worry yourself too much; if it can't be found anymore, it just can't be found anymore. Such is nature sometimes."
whatsthisbird,3cajzb,mievaan,2,Mon Jul 6 13:27:23 2015 UTC,"Well the courtyard is surrounded by a curb (that you see behind the bird on the picture) so to go hide somewhere where there's a couple bushs it would have to hop over that curb which is unlikely, I mean if it can hop that high then it should be able to fly away as well so I don't know. Also there's no cat in the building."
whatsthisbird,3cajzb,mievaan,3,Mon Jul 6 13:40:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't worry. It doesn't look visibly injured (not e.g. drooping a wing), and isn't a baby.

Snow Goose?  Neither... ?  I only saw this pretty little goose once on June 6, hanging out with the Canadas.  If it was either Ross's or Snow, could it have been lost?  Range map things I looked at made it seem like both species don't really belong in AL in June.  Second two: (Sorry for focusing on the wing for some reason and the blurriness, haha) Am I right to think that this is a female mallard?  I see this one with the normal mallards every time I visit, but it's the only mallard-looking thing there that's white (or at least, white with a light brown tinge).  I just wanted to be sure since its bill and legs were black, and Google Images mostly seems to show white mallards with lighter bills/legs."
whatsthisbird,3cclpy,AccipiterF1,7,Mon Jul 6 21:30:53 2015 UTC,"Ross's for the first two. The bill shape is distinctively different, with a very vertical line at the base, and no ""grin patch"" visible at the mouth opening. Also, they are just cuter, which is very evident in your pictures.  The second bird is a mallard suffering from leucism. Actually, on second look, it might be a domestic cross or back cross."

Put him back - the parents will fish out delicious little aquatic insects and the like to feed to their babies. You have great intentions, I can tell :) But he'll be happier with his family in the water!  They don't look like they should be swimming, because they don't have traditionally webbed feet like ducks.  From the Cornell Lab of Ornithology page about American coots:    Although it swims like a duck, the American Coot does not have webbed feet like a duck. Instead, each one of the coot’s long toes has broad lobes of skin that help it kick through the water. The broad lobes fold back each time the bird lifts its foot, so it doesn’t impede walking on dry land, though it supports the bird’s weight on mucky ground."
whatsthisbird,3c8z6a,drink_your_tea,3,Mon Jul 6 01:55:17 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a species of coot. They swim! I promise! Put him back - the parents will fish out delicious little aquatic insects and the like to feed to their babies. You have great intentions, I can tell :) But he'll be happier with his family in the water!   Well, maybe and maybe not.  If I recall correctly coots lay about 6 eggs and only one or two survive.  The parents can't keep up with the amount of feeding necessary and actively harass selected chicks until they die.  Not in line with human nature, but it is theirs.  Still, I agree, put it back and let nature operate as it will."
whatsthisbird,3c8z6a,kevinlyfellow,6,Mon Jul 6 03:18:31 2015 UTC,"Yes. Do you mean I should have clarified ""the parents will fish out delicious little aquatic insects and the like to feed to their surviving babies""?   The parents imprint best on the first-hatched chicks, so those tend to survive. It gets interesting when you consider the egg-dumping & brood parasitism that runs a bit rampant in the coot world, as females actively try to lay the first egg in nests not their own for this reason. To anyone interested, I highly recommend reading up on articles published by Dai Shizuka's lab."

whatsthisbird,3c8z6a,kevinlyfellow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:42:22 2015 UTC,"Fair enough! :) And you did make a really valid point - that coots, unlike most (all?) other species of waterfowl, have a really cutthroat chick stage as a result of patricide. No matter what, that's pretty unique in the animal kingdom, and I think you mentioning it was good for the discussion!"
whatsthisbird,3c8z6a,drink_your_tea,2,Thu Jul 9 00:20:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I now know it's definitely an American Coot, they are a very common sight on this lake. Although i now feel a bit guilty about taking him, as you say my intentions were on the right side. I will take him back today an will drop him off close to where i first found him."
whatsthisbird,3c8z6a,ruk_hai,5,Mon Jul 6 12:44:16 2015 UTC,Some sort of coot/gallinule... I don't know much about Mexican birds so I don't know which one you get over there.
whatsthisbird,3c8z6a,UppongeleGodavari,7,Mon Jul 6 00:52:16 2015 UTC,Maybe American Coot? 5th picture
whatsthisbird,3c8z6a,ruk_hai,3,Mon Jul 6 00:57:23 2015 UTC,Seems like the one.
whatsthisbird,3c8z6a,UppongeleGodavari,4,Mon Jul 6 00:58:43 2015 UTC,I had no idea they were so colorful!
whatsthisbird,3c8z6a,drink_your_tea,6,Mon Jul 6 01:05:09 2015 UTC,"Lyon, Bruce et al. (September 1994). ""Parental choice selects for ornamental plumage in American Coot chicks"". Nature 371 (6494): 240–242   :) If you have access to it, it's a cool read!"
whatsthisbird,3c8z6a,thirdpeppermint,2,Mon Jul 6 01:57:54 2015 UTC,That's exactly the one. Thank you. I will take him back to where I found him today. Hopefully his parents are still in the area.
whatsthisbird,3c8z6a,steveofthejungle,3,Mon Jul 6 12:46:21 2015 UTC,"I vote for American Coot chick! They do belong in the water, though."
whatsthisbird,3c8z6a,kenba2099,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:11:48 2015 UTC,Where in Mexico? When I lived in Queretaro there was a lake in a park by my house that was FULL of American Coots
whatsthisbird,3c9df0,Lisagna,4,Mon Jul 6 02:53:26 2015 UTC,"That is a tricky one, cause the wing spots and edges are look fairly  yellow-crowned, and the bill is relatively thick and not as pointed as in most black-crowned.  But I am going to say black-crowned with little confidence because of the yellow on the bill."
whatsthisbird,3c9df0,im_a_bird_biologist,2,Mon Jul 6 05:09:15 2015 UTC,"Where in Gainesville? (I live there, too!)  Also - I vote Juvenile Black-Crown as well."
whatsthisbird,3c9df0,nixity,2,Mon Jul 6 14:18:29 2015 UTC,At the new Sweetwater Wetlands Park--I went right after the huge thunderstorm yesterday. It was great because the place wasn't so fricking hot like it usually is!
whatsthisbird,3c9df0,nixity,2,Mon Jul 6 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"Oh very cool! I just checked out their website, that looks like a great saturday activity!"
whatsthisbird,3ca0qm,CochinBrahmaLover,6,Mon Jul 6 07:13:23 2015 UTC,Yes.
whatsthisbird,3c840r,hellosidvicious,12,Sun Jul 5 20:04:13 2015 UTC,I believe it may be a juvenile Glossy Ibis http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Glossy_Ibis/id. I think they breed in Jamaica Bay.
whatsthisbird,3c840r,TheDataMeister,-17,Sun Jul 5 21:41:11 2015 UTC,Difficult to tell from the pic but it looks like it might be a rare Black Funnihaha bird

whatsthisbird,3c8xr0,Gobias_Industries,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:31:36 2015 UTC,In Appomattox County Community Park. About 30 minutes from the James River.

whatsthisbird,3c8hq3,ruk_hai,2,Sun Jul 5 22:19:13 2015 UTC,No parants were around ill just let him go i guess
whatsthisbird,3c8hq3,giaquinto,4,Sun Jul 5 22:59:23 2015 UTC,he doesn't look happy with you
whatsthisbird,3c8hq3,UppongeleGodavari,8,Sun Jul 5 23:53:24 2015 UTC,"Birds never look happy.  Especially baby birds, they always seem disappointed in everything."
