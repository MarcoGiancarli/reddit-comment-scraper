It's all selection bias, the people who did super well are very, very excited and want to be excited with everyone else whereas people who are disappointed aren't going to share. Also, since so many high scores are being posted, people who did really well but maybe not 512+ well might feel intimidated or embarrassed which is totally crazy, but you know, the internet.   Plus, people on this subreddit are people who are investing massive amounts of time and obsessing over this test and will probably be the people that are going to do well."

Mcat,3e6iri,queenofthecl0uds,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:46:14 2015 UTC,"Hi queenofthecl0uds!  Well firstly, it's good that you recognize your strengths and weaknesses. Knowing what you don't know is the first step to a good score.  Personally, I started studying in late January for the May MCAT. I took a Kaplan course twice a week and tried to take a practice exam every 2/3 weeks during the semester. It was really tough to study, but definitely do-able especially if you have a light load. After finals in May, I took 2 weeks and did intensive study at home which really boosted my scores. I ended up with a 517. Also keep in mind that most diagnostic testing isn't indicative yet because the testing companies know so little about this new exam.   As long as you can maintain self-discipline - make it like another class. Set out specific times to study and do it right: in the library or another quiet study spot. Don't try to ""study"" with friends or in your room or with distractions. For content review, you need serious chunks of time to retain information. If you can do that during the year, you'll be fine!"

Every...single...one. So, my motto is that I'm not taking this exam until I'm hitting that mark. Anyway, I know this doesn't directly answer your question, but I had a representative of a top med school come to my school, and her advice was to not take the exam until you're scoring 5 points higher on ALL of your practice tests (this was back with the old scoring system, but you get the point). Her reasoning was that even if you slip, there is NO WAY you will slip that much. So, if your goal was a 30, get a 35 on practice exams before taking it, and you can just about guarantee that you will get your goal, probably even a bit higher."

The consensus seems to be that the practice exams for the new MCAT are more challenging than the real deal, and there isn't even reliable scoring available. The 80% metric on the sample test seems reasonable though."
Mcat,3e4utx,Madeal12,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:40:54 2015 UTC,"This may be true, however, it's not so much that the scores of practice exams are inaccurate as much as it is that 1) you don't want to leave anything up to chance. In other words, if you usually score over 30, but every now and then get a 29, it is very possible that the day you take your MCAT it will be ""one of those times"" 2) people's performance on the MCAT is usually worse compared to practice exams because of how nerve wrecking the test is, which causes the person to second guess themselves, get distracted by abnormal conditions (e.g. when I study it's pure silence. There is not pure silence during the MCAT, people leave the room all the time, talk to themselves, etc.) So, I don't necessarily disagree with you, again, I (and the person form the med school) think this exam is so important that you want to leave almost no aspect of it up to chance (of course this isn't completely possible, but an ideal to strive for)"

Some of them are so dense and hard to even understand what's going on. I'm not sure what to do here - I've done research and written papers myself and I'd never write anything as hard to follow as some of this stuff on the test.

I read a ton, always have, and I also have a previous BA in a writing intensive major before deciding to go back for the bio degree and med school.

Mcat,3e5lkx,fucking_premed,3,Wed Jul 22 03:20:29 2015 UTC,"Uncompetitive inhibitors don't bind to the active site: the result is that they lower Vmax and Km.   Mixed inhibitors show the characteristics of both competitive and uncompetitive inhibitors: they lower Vmax like uncompetitive, but they raise Km like competitive. A subclass of mixed inhibitors is the noncompetitive inhibitor, for which Km doesn't change.  The reason an uncompetitive inhibitor reduces Km is because the inhibitor doesn't bind to the active site. In other words, it binds to the enzyme-substrate complex, reducing the concentration of the complex in solution and shifting the equilibrium toward more substrate binding (lowering Km)."
Mcat,3e5lkx,plasmaprestige,2,Wed Jul 22 03:36:40 2015 UTC,"Taken directly from Kaplan Biochem book:  Mixed inhibition   Mixed inhibition results when an inhibitor can bind to either the enzyme or the enzyme–substrate complex, but has different affinity for each. If the inhibitor had the same affinity for both, it would be a noncompetitive inhibitor. Mixed inhibitors do not bind at the active site, but at an allosteric site. Mixed inhibition alters the experimental value of Km depending on the preference of the inhibitor for the enzyme vs. the enzyme–substrate complex. If the inhibitor preferentially binds to the enzyme, it increases the Km value (lowers affinity); if the inhibitor binds to the enzyme–substrate complex, it lowers the Km value (increases affinity). In either case, vmax is decreased. On a Lineweaver–Burk plot, the curves for the activity with and without the inhibitor intersect at a point that is not on either axis.   Uncompetitive Inhibition   Uncompetitive inhibitors bind only to the enzyme–substrate complex and essentially lock the substrate in the enzyme, preventing its release. This can be interpreted as increasing affinity between the enzyme and substrate. Because the enzyme–substrate complex has already formed upon binding, uncompetitive inhibitors must bind at an allosteric site; in fact, it is the formation of the enzyme–substrate complex that creates a conformational change that allows the uncompetitive inhibitor to bind. Thus, uncompetitive inhibitors lower Km and vmax. On a Lineweaver–Burk plot, the curves for activity with and without an uncompetitive inhibitor are parallel.   I hope this makes sense!"

It's pretty tricky since you need to think in 3D.  Take a look at the side view, comparing that to the overhead view, one can understand the field as moving horizontally from N to S (this should be your 4 fingers in the RHR).  Next, referencing the direction of current in the overhead view, realize that (on the side view) the current must be going into the page on the right side of the coil, and out of the page on the left side of the coil. This should be your thumb in RHR.  Finally, do the whole RHR on both sides of the coil. On the right of the coil, based on the directions we've just established, the force (palm) will be going downwards, while on the left the force will be upwards. Therefore, the needle, which is attached to the coil, should rotate clockwise (=A)"

I is the thumb so on the right side it is pointing up and on the left side it is pointing down (top view, like looking at the image on the computer screen) Therefore, on the right the palm points inwards and on the left the palm points outwards.

Mcat,3e4jx3,randoguy_16,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:06:03 2015 UTC,"The new MCAT was designed so that 500 is right in the middle of the scoring range. They did this to shift people's mindsets from thinking high scores = better doctors to the more feasible notion that past a certain proficiency, other factors determine how good of a doctor you will be. That's why the score system is so odd and centered at 500.   That said, schools will most likely put more weight on the percentile scores in the first administrations of the new MCAT because that's what they know and that's how they can compare applicants who took the old MCAT to applicants who took the newer one. So the percentile score is what you should be evaluating yourself on."

Mcat,3e4hsp,mnasir94,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:14:05 2015 UTC,"I think the explanation was trying to explain how DNA can have positive supercoils without becoming totally messed up (i.e. too tight; cannot unwound for replication -- remember that DNA is double helixed and has the replication fork and has 2 strands that are replicated differently). And the reason they can do that is because gyrase introduced negative supercoils (so let's say the DNA is arbitrarily -5) and then there were some enzymes that introduced positive supercoils (-5 + 2 = -3) so the DNA will not be positively supercoiled because the negative supercoils cancel it out.  So, to answer your question -- if you INHIBIT gyrase, then there would be no original negative supercoils. Thus, when you add positive supercoils, it is TOO tight and replication would be halted (and the rest of the DNA would not be unraveled)."
Mcat,3e4hsp,keepsmegoing,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:06:12 2015 UTC,"I think the negative supercoiling also compacts dna when it's not being replicated, similar to how histones work in eukaryotes."

Mcat,3e4hsp,mcatthrowawayyy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:29:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I think any coiling/supercoiling, regardless of positive or negative, will compact the DNA. I am not 100% sure of this.  This is why eukaryotes do not have gyrase because they have histones that already introduce negative supercoiling. But according to wiki, some eukaryotes do have gyrase, but in my biochemistry class, I learned that no eukaryotes did. So, I would presume that MOST eukaryotes don't have gyrase because it is essentially the same function/purpose as histones in terms of introducing negative supercoils."

If you haven't already submitted anything, I would definitely wait until next cycle for MD programs. Honestly, many schools are looking for older applicants anyways and your scores won't expire so you have much better chances.

Look at what linearbbq did at SDN: http://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/how-i-prepped-for-a-526.1146107/  I think it can work if you are diligent about it. Make flash cards, constantly recheck your notes, use Anki so you don't forget content too much.  Additionally, find old passage materials and keep practicing so you at least know how to break down passages and can develop timing by the time your two months until test hits around.  Furthermore, read, read read. If you have any weakness with certain styles of CARS passages (philosophy, art history, economics, etc.), develop a strategy around those passages.  Lastly, if you have a crazy heavy work/class schedule, forget everything I just said. I don't think people who work 30-40 hrs/wk and have 3-4 hard science classes can even dream to be productive w/MCAT studying during the semester.  That said, if you actually get through all of content review by September and can put 10-12/week through reviewing and practicing, I honestly don't see taking the MCAT in 6 months being a problem."

That's just too much time to be spinning your wheels and you'll start forgetting. However, since you don't have a choice at this point, I would recommend light review for the next couple months. Reread your text books, maybe a chapter a night, just to keep concepts fresh. Don't do full lengths and keep practice problems to a minimum because you don't want to use up all your resources before you even start really studying again. Once you're about two months out from the test, start doing more practice problems, get back in the MCAT mindset. About a month out, start hitting full lengths hard."

""one-half"" = 0.5, and ""one and one-half"" = 1.5  explanation of answer B (adding 1.5 equivalents): If you add 1 equivalent of strong base to H2CO3, you remove 1st the proton completely, therefore your solution is fully HCO3-. Next, you add another 0.5 equivalent (bringing it up to 1.5 total). This will remove the second proton from HALF of the HCO3- (this makes sense since a full equivalent removes it from all of the molecules, half an equivalent should remove the proton from half of the molecules). That means half of your HCO3- has become CO3-2, and therefore the concentrations of HCO3- and CO3-2 are equal. The pH at this point is also the pKa of the second proton, or 10.8"
Mcat,3e1x4k,mcatthrowawayyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:38 2015 UTC,"Whenever there is a mention of half equivalents, think half-equivalence point (or pKa). Any whole equivalent of a strong base automatically removes one proton per equivalent added. Half equivalents move the pH up to the next highest pKa. Since all the answer choices involve a multiple of half an equivalent, the pH value of 10.83 must be the pKa of one of those acids. If pKa = -log(Ka), then Ka = 10-10.83 or about 10-11. The only one that is close is Pka2 of H2CO3. This means you need 1 equivalent to remove the first proton and another 1/2 equivalent to get to the second pKa."

Mcat,3e0s9m,mcpaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:49:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's certainly doable. I studied for two months and I feel that my first month was relatively low yield anyway. For example, I spent about a week memorizing heaps of physiology stuff and I don't think it made an appearance anywhere on my test. That being said, it's impossible to predict what will be on there. My advice would be to do a bunch of AAMC practice problems (question packs, official guide, etc.) and learn how the AAMC writes questions. Then just go over all the questions to determine what content areas to review."
Mcat,3e0s9m,shakenbake666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:30:34 2015 UTC,I started studying a little less than a month before my exam. If you do that you just need to make a very strict schedule and go balls deep in your studying. Like 14hrs a day balls deep. Take Friday or Saturday nights off only.

I registered for Aug 21st and Ive been doing a clinical pharmacy internship of 40+ hours a week plus studying for the MCAT. Needless to say, Im very stressed and doubting myself too but if you really put your mind too it you can do it, just do practice tests on top of practice tests!"
Mcat,3dzma4,PresterJohn-117,5,Mon Jul 20 20:38:21 2015 UTC,"But there's an argument to be made for cultural literacy.  Yeah now we see Freud as some sex-obsessed weirdo, but this was what psychiatry looked like for a time and informed and probably inspired quite a bit more study on the subject.  Same for Marx.  How many people apply to medical school without having critiqued a single painting or critically read Marx? The core study of Western canon has basically gone out the window so this section of the test covers a few bases: is the applicant functionally fluent in these topics? Can they critique someone else's argument on these topics? Do they have a sense of how this history affects modern day problems (in economics, little g government, medicine, etc)?  This is part way to fulfilling the medical community's sincere desire for more well-rounded physicians.  And that is what can strengthen interpersonal skills.  Maybe your doctor doesn't need to know this stuff, but I would prefer care from a well-rounded human being (while it sounds like I'm setting this up as a dichotomy, just to stress, excellent medical care is not mutually exclusive with knowledge of non-medical topics)."
Mcat,3dzma4,HicJacetMelilla,0,Tue Jul 21 15:18:26 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the desire for more well-rounded physicians, but I'm failing to see how the psych-soc concepts really accomplish this. Not a lot of the concepts seem very generalizable. I feel in terms of well-roundedness I have gained exponentially more from one literature class I took than I have from studying terms like ""self-reference effect"" or ""sensorimotor phase."" The MCAT doesn't have to be the inculcator of well-roundedness in physicians and I don't think it was ever intended to be."
Mcat,3dzma4,HicJacetMelilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:25 2015 UTC,"As for some of the topics they actually picked for P/S, I'm sure you and I could sit together and go through the list and find a lot of agreement on which seem unnecessary.     The MCAT doesn't have to be the inculcator of well-roundedness in physicians and I don't think it was ever intended to be.   I agree that probably wasn't its intent, but the AAMC or whoever is in charge of these changes seem like they want the MCAT to cover more bases.  An all-purpose test if you will.  Of course a lit class or time spent volunteering will do more for cultivating well-roundedness, but the exam attempts to quantify it.  Personally I have mixed feelings on whether that's even necessary, but from a school's perspective it makes winnowing the pool a lot easier."
Mcat,3dzma4,ProtuberantUmbilicus,8,Tue Jul 21 18:22:04 2015 UTC,"I know this is a rant, but just to play Devil's Advocate. The MCAT is a test. They state what material is on the test; you have to learn it reasonably well; then they ask you to apply what you've learned through critical reasoning.   Does it even really matter what is on the test? The main point of the MCAT is to test CRITICAL REASONING skills. Heck, CARS has nothing to do with medical science content. Where's the rant for that!?  Also, I think sociological theories came up once on my test? Didn't even need to know any names."
Mcat,3dzma4,zhamdee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:26 2015 UTC,"yeah fair. But like it seems more valid on the face of it for entering med students to have high critical reasoning skills. I just feel that so much of the P/S section is so far afield of anything. I know this argument breaks down when you consider that physics is not relevant to any med school classes, but at least it's science... it just feels to me like they pulled so much of the P/S section out of their ass"
Mcat,3dzma4,trollwarIord,4,Mon Jul 20 21:17:40 2015 UTC,Most of the psychoanalytic theories seem out of place on the MCAT. I found myself questioning their importance as well.   But I think the sociology is worthwhile. It should help give people an outside perspective on what causes health trends. Nothing inherently liberal about it at all though ...
Mcat,3dzma4,Bananazoo,2,Tue Jul 21 02:45:39 2015 UTC,"The field of medicine is supposed to strongly uphold notions of scientific validity and yet AAMC is administering a test that might expect you to know pseudoscience.  There's nothing really difficult about Freud's BS, but I do have an issue that we are asked to know it by a prominent organization in the field of medicine just because it is a part of introductory psych curriculum (lels he's the father of psychology he needs honorable mention)."
Mcat,3dzma4,Aryanenzo,6,Tue Jul 21 16:20:48 2015 UTC,"I felt this exact same way. The MCAT is (ostensibly) a science/critical thinking test, not a history test.

Mcat,3dzma4,crod9214,2,Mon Jul 20 23:50:45 2015 UTC,"Edit: I feel like I should qualify that I thought the section was frustrating too. Just hoping to shed some light on why (I think) they chose to structure the section like they did.  Okay so I appreciate your frustration but do you really think that ANY of the material is up to date or complete? For example, all of the modern physics stuff is really stuff from the early 1900's. It would be pretty unfair to ask you to learn a bunch about where quantum theory has come since then just for the sake of staying current. As for the psychology, I have few thoughts here. First, as a graduate student in a cognitive psychology program, I agree that this is all incredibly outdated and wrong. I had to re-teach myself a bunch of stuff that hasn't been relevant since intro psych. On the other hand, Frued and Marx hold incredibly important positions in the development of their respective sciences, and an appreciation for their revolutionary insights (no pun intended for Marx) can serve as an exemplar of critical, forward thinking. Finally, people still practice psychoanalytic psychology--its falling out of favor pretty quickly, to be sure, but it still exists. No one thinks that penis envy or elktra complexes are real, any more than we think dreams really are the key to understanding psychological problems, but Freud's theories still echo though psychology, and anyone claiming a knowledge of psychology must understand at the very least Freud's model of the mind. As for all the other BS, the same argument largely applies. Its either still being practiced, or most of the current theories are best understood in the context of those theories they were proposed to refute.   tl;dr Be angry/annoyed because this was a stupidly long and annoying test, but dont single out psychology as the only section that isnt up to date, and don't assume that all of the information is just useless. After all, people still do psychoanalytic therapy."
Mcat,3dzma4,Jam_Paris_WBFF_Pro,2,Tue Jul 21 13:10:59 2015 UTC,"Mmmm I see what you are saying. I would raise the distinction that while the physics material was elucidated in the early 20th century, it still holds up as the fundamentals of that scientific discipline. Whereas there have been a LOT of psychologists who have essentially reversed the teachings of Freud or seriously challenged them. None of the physics we are learning has been empirically shown to be false which challenges your characterization of it as ""outdated."" I get your point, that it's the basis of psychology, but I guess I'd argue that a scientific discipline founded upon such theories may not be so scientific after all."
Mcat,3dzma4,Scorwegian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:12 2015 UTC,"A lot of the physics stuff IS empirically wrong, though, for everything beyond a hydrogen atom in a vacuum (source: did physical chemistry quantum modeling in undergrad). To be clear, Im definitely not trying to say the two are comparable in their rigor or predictive capabilities. They're not. As for Freud, he was definitely wrong haha, and to be honest I dont know why he always gets such a large section. Generally speaking though, most of the stuff in the psych section isnt so much blatantly wrong (a la Freud) as it is old. Most of psychology has just added qualifications and new phenomena to old theories. Or, like behaviorism (operant and classical conditioning), the theory is probably wrong (for a history of that realization look up the Cognitive revolution), but it works so well that one doesn't really need to worry about why its wrong. If you want a child to stop throwing tantrums, one doesn't need to know WHY the behaviorist explanation is wrong--and the corresponding cognitivist correction--to understand that witholding attention (negative punishment) is a good way to correct the behavior.  I guess what I really hope to convey is that the field of psychology appreciates what Freud did, but they are pretty much all in agreement that he was totally wrong--with the exception of a few nutty ones. And on a broader scale, the field is much much more rigorous than what you saw in the MCAT review. That being said, that's true, to varying degrees) for pretty much ALL of the fields covered in the book."
Mcat,3dzma4,Jam_Paris_WBFF_Pro,2,Tue Jul 21 16:25:53 2015 UTC,"It's stupid AND AAMC's guide is vague as hell. It doubles up on how angry it makes me. Just wrote the practice AAMC test and I would've been very happy with my grade had psych not messed it up. I'm not even sure what to study after reading the Kaplan book and feeling like it helped minimally. Planning to watch all those Khan academy vids I guess but I doubt that meets all of AAMC's demands either. Anyway, I'm rambling."

True that it's quite a bit like Anki, but I like that it's basically a trivia app you can use whenever and wherever you have to wait for a while, upping your exposure time to the topics. It lets you classify the questions based on how confident you feel or ""star"" them as especially important. Plus there are some mnemonic and terminology sections of the app that might come in handy"
Mcat,3dzma4,bonjour13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:38:54 2015 UTC,"It's just testing your understanding of the content, not whether you agree with it. Besides, I would say sociology is more relevant to a practicing physician than most physics.  Some of the research passage questions in that section ask you to determine the validity of experiments performed. Some of them do not reach statistical significance.  I would say those kind of skills are critical for researchers and physicians alike. It is in a somewhat unfamiliar context to most test takers, but being a critical reader extremely important."
Mcat,3dzma4,krustytheclown2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:42 2015 UTC,Mcat is mostly about critical thinking.

I thought it was definitely good practice in the sense that they are true AAMC style questions (i.e., more focused on experimental and big picture concepts than nitty gritty details), but I feel like C/P is probably more bio-based on the real test compared to the old one. For example, we'd probably have a C/P passage about capacitor plates in the context of a defibrillator, or something like electrophysiology of a neuron, or gases and fluids in the lung, etc. instead of isolated, non-biological systems as presented in the Q packs for the most part."

My advice, know your amino acids well and from what everyone else is saying, EK FLs are the most representative of the exam. The AAMC will have released a total of 2 FLs if you plan to take it early 2016, so that might be something to look into.  Also, there has been more experimental research passages included in the real exam that comes from real world research. I post 7 ARTICLE QAs a week, they're full articles with usually 6-8 questions I will base off of the article and psuedo-discretes.

For me I did the 15 second break and then would read the passage slow and through until I found the main idea and then start to read faster. Also how often do you find yourself referring back you should read it clearly enough that the only thing you should have to refer back to for is quantitave easy to find stuff.  Are you crossing out options as you go? That I found helps people narrow choices down and stop referring back and increases overall confidence in choices. I would recommend trying that method and if it doesn't work discard it like hot trash this is the one section that is very personal in your approach and worth it to find the approach that works for you.

Mcat,3dzven,XFlamewithin,3,Mon Jul 20 21:42:49 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong since it's been a while since I took the MCAT.  From the top of my head, for size exclusion chromatography you're pouring a solution of compounds through a bunch of silica beads with tiny pores in them. The smaller the compound, the more likely it will travel through those pores, and the more convoluted and longer path it will take to the bottom. If the compound is larger, it won't be able to travel though the pores and will just take a more straightforward path downwards. So larger = faster = shorter retention time.  For Gas chromatography, the more often the compound stays in gas phase vs. liquid phase, the faster it comes out of the other side. Polyethylene glycol is a relatively non-polar molecule except for the hydroxyl groups at the very ends. As such compared to molecules with a charge it travels faster through GEC.   However, the larger the polyethylene gets, the more energy it takes to convert itself to a gas phase since it is ""heavier now"". So the larger it gets = longer retention times.  So based on the question, the molecules with a larger SEC retention time (aka smaller polyethylene) should have a shorter GC retention time (since smaller = less energy to convert to gas)  TLDR: The PR answer is wrong since they mixed up SEC retention times"
Mcat,3dzven,nomzzzz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:33:56 2015 UTC,Is there a limit to this principle?   Lets say there are two molecules that do not enter the pores of the silica beads. Would the smaller of the two large molecules not seep down faster?

You're right, larger molecules don't have to move through the beads and will elute faster whereas smaller molecules will have to make it through the beads and hence have longer path length and hence longer retention time."
Mcat,3dzven,basophil666,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:23 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Apparently I'm completely wrong with this explanation. Thanks /u/nomzzzz!  You've got it mixed up. The larger something is, the longer its retention time in the chromatography column.  An easy metaphor I was taught is to imagine the column like a giant rubber band ball. Smaller things are naturally going to be able to navigate faster through the ball, while larger molecules are more likely to get caught up and slowed.  Same idea for polar chromatography columns, but instead of physical hindrance, it's the attraction of polar molecules."
Mcat,3dzven,MrMajorMajorMajor,3,Mon Jul 20 22:32:01 2015 UTC,"For the longest time I also believed that, but it turns out that's not the case.

Mcat,3dyz4d,Reddentary_Lifestyle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:19 2015 UTC,"Immunology is a bit on the fringes of the MCAT so it's not the most relevant, however it is possible to see questions asking about immune cells, what they do, and how they work.  This paper is an extreme example which I chose in part because I'm doing my masters in immunology so I have a background in this.  For biology, I recommend you spend the majority of your time on Biochemistry, Genetics, Molecular Techniques (PCR, Southern Blot, etc), and Enzyme Kinetics.  Evolution and ecology are not high-yield topics.  Immunology is also not a high-yield topic, however it can be found at times."

Mcat,3dy3az,1hihs,4,Mon Jul 20 14:03:53 2015 UTC,"For bio, I would really understand enzyme kinetics, amino acids, and your blots.  Ex:  Northern blots detect RNA (DNA is digested with DNAse, so realistically the sample should only contain RNA nucleic acids). The RNA is detected with a labelled complementary cDNA probe. This lets you measure the relative level of transcription of that gene.   I'll copy and paste my western blot example from the 18th reaction threat (which covers a couple of questions from my test)   Western Blots use antibody-antigen interactions to detect specific sites. If you recall, antibodies bind to antigens, which can be an exposed surface of a protein. For these tests to be useful, the antibodies should react to an antigen specific to the protein of interest and not bind non-specifically. Other experiments that include this interaction are ELISAs, microscopy or cytometry. Primary antibodies refers to the antibody detecting the antigen of interest. Secondary antibodies, labelled in a way that is quantitatively detectable, bind to the Fc region of the primary antibody.  Primary antibodies can be directly conjugated to detectable, but antibodies are relatively expensive and the conjugation process is an significant additional expense.  If all the primary antibodies share the same Fc region, they will be detected by the same secondary antibody.  If one uses primary antibodies with different Fc regions, you can use secondary antibodies with labels that one could discriminate from each other (such as a specific fluorescence color, or a heavy metal isotope tag that can be detected by mass spectrometry.) This can also be done with directly conjugated antibodies.  Controls for western blots include http://www.abcam.com/protocols/recommended-controls-for-western-blot  Positive control lysate and Negative control lysate are to test for antibody specificity. When you are reading a passage in the MCAT, you can reasonably assume that the antibody is highly specific to the protein they say it targets. ** May not be true if they ask a question or have an answer stem about the antibody-antigen interactions specify, then you need to be critical of the data they present (Did not appear as a question on my exam, but I imagine it could be tested)** Loading control is to obtain a normalized signal from each sample. This allows you to compare the relative amount of cells are in each sample. Ideally, the loading control should be detected equally between all samples. I have personally used beta-tubulin as loading control, but many others exist. From this, you can determine the relative detection between different antigens.  If the loading controls are all equal, but another antigen of interest has varying staining, then you can make an assumption that a particular protein is upregulated, downregulated, or eliminated.  Protein ladders let you characterize proteins by a known characteristic. Protein size ladders have proteins of known sizes that will separate differently via gel electrophoresis. This allows you to determine the size of the protein by a known quality."

Prior knowledge of the subject helps greatly so I'm planning on just doing more practice and familiarize myself with the language.
Mcat,3dzpgu,PolarSand,3,Mon Jul 20 21:00:27 2015 UTC,The one thing I liked in one of my books was that it recommended at the start of each section talking a 10-15 second breather to prepare your mind the reasoning being (and everyone should be able to relate to this) is that we rush in read half the passage and realize we didn't get anything from it and thus waste 30-60 seconds rereading the passage. After every passage take 5 seconds to breathe it adds up to like a minute which isn't going to kill you and increased my focus a bunch.

It's fine to spend 5 or more mins per passage, but just don't go back to the passage frequently.  If it's taking too long, try this: read the first paragraph very carefully/slowly and note the overall topic/main idea in your head; then read the subsequent ones more quickly with the mindset of searching for claims and gliding through the evidence/elaboration. In your mind, thread these main claims to the original paragraph so that ultimately you'll have a good idea of the flow of the passage. I've also been working on quietly verbalizing - but not the entire passage, only when I come across transition words and opinionated words.  This has helped me comprehend even the tough/abstract passages in Kaplan/TPR FLs as well NS CARS book.  Edit: Also, another thing I've found helpful (and not time-consuming) is imagining a straight, progressing line/rope while reading the passage; whenever the author changes his line of thought, I imagine the line to bend depending on how radically the author is departing from his previous discussion; whenever a person mentioned in the passage proposes a view different from the author, I imagine that person tugging at the line/rope to create a slight but not significant deviation. I'm still working with this and it's not time-consuming since it's not hard to imagine a line/rope or the people giving alternative views.  Again: I too am struggling a lot with this section, but this has been helpful in at least comprehending the difficult passages in limited amount of time; I still need to work on my answering strategies"

Do not make up anything, do not try to bs your way through an explanation, it will lose you credibility and therefore money.  Prepare, prepare, prepare. Know how you're going to explain every subject. It's a ton of work, but if you haven't come up with an explanation to X that differs from the textbook, you will be ummimg and awwing away your client's precious study time.  Get all the books. That way you know what your clients are studying and what problems they're doing. You should also read all of the books for this same reason, and know the weaknesses of each set (skimming is fine).  Lastly, consider working for a test prep company. They'll train you in almost all of those things. You won't make as much money, but they're great help everywhere else.  And my personal preference is thay tutoring on Skype is balls. It's hard to see what each person is doing and it is WAY too easy for someone to cancel a Skype appointment, and they will, my friend, they will.

Mcat,3dwr77,ev1hmr,4,Mon Jul 20 13:38:05 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Here's a tip for tutors and students :)  Remember that a good tutor is not the same as a good textbook. A textbook lays everything out for you to reference. It's all there, with a beginning and an end.  A good tutor on the other hand helps you cycle through information, always tying concepts together and relating new info back to what you've already covered, focusing specifically on the things you personally need more reinforcement on.  The Socratic method is very good for finding out exactly what is understood and where things are fuzzy. Ask why is this that way? Okay, and then why is that such way?  I think students get very frustrated with their tutors when the tutor just explains something, the student gets each step and is nodding along the way, then later when the student gets tripped up by the same topic, the tutor gives off the vibe or actually says ""Come on, we just covered this""  Everyone is different, so be sure to always ask your student how things are going, what approaches work and what feels like a waste of time. Learn from them too! Have fun!"

I would avoid saying any MCAT concept is easy even if it is. It can get somewhat discouraging if you get confused by a topic that is supposed to be easy.  Another thing I would like in a tutor is having examples that are multidisciplinary and that focus on the bigger picture/real life. Maybe learning flow in the context of blood vessels, electric fields in terms of MRIs or enzymes with respect to different diseases.  Lastly, I like summary charts after lessons such as comparing how the 5'UTR in translation is equivalent to the promoter region in transcription ( I think?) or how metabolic pathways work in a huge mindmap (including when/where/why the pathways occur)"
Mcat,3dwtiq,lebrondude23,3,Mon Jul 20 04:45:50 2015 UTC,"If you're feeling a little shaky on C/P, I would definitely recommend the Physics and Chemistry AAMC question packs and review the solutions while you're doing it - definitely helped my confidence on that section. I would also recommend memorizing the amino acids and their 1/3 letter abbreviations, but more importantly know how they're grouped (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, acidic, basic, special groups) and how they would affect secondary structure, binding, etc.  Other than that, great work on those FL scores!

Mcat,3dwtiq,Scorwegian,2,Mon Jul 20 04:53:10 2015 UTC,"Hi. Great advice. Where would I learn about AA effects on secondary structure, binding, etc?"
Mcat,3dwtiq,RPSavant,2,Mon Jul 20 12:22:29 2015 UTC,"This list is one of the better summaries of the AA's that I've found. You don't really need to worry about Selenocysteine though. A solid mnemonic device will help immensely.  For starters, know that sidechains with OH can be phosphorylated, hydrophobic groups are more likely to be on the interior of a protein and hydrophilic groups are likely to be on the outside due to entropy, Cysteine is responsible for disulfide linakges, proline is a constrained ring structure that will cause a severe bend in any chain it is in, Glycine has only an H group as its side chain, and Tyr, Trp, and Phe are all aromatic groups.  Keep Gly, Gln, and Glu straight as abbreviations too!  Also be able to know how the pka of COOH, NH3+, and the side chains relate to the pH of the solution their in - as in, what will be protonated or deprotanted at a given pH. Just think if a pH is 1 and pKa of the COOH is around 3, it will be protonated since there are many H+ available to bind, whereas at a pH of say 6 there are comparatively more OH- ions to withdraw protons from the carboxyl and it will therefore be COO-. Be able to figure this in to the entirety of a single AA residue, accounting for carboxyl group, side chain, and amino group, as well as if the AAs are in a chain.  This might seem like a lot, but once you've seen enough problems involving these concepts and you end up mastering them, it will likely make the C/P and B/B sections run much smoother overall."
Mcat,3dwtiq,Scorwegian,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response.  You are right.  Seeing the concepts over and over again really helps. It's one of those things that is easy to understand while reading but also easy to forget two pages later :-)    Other than proline, are there other amino acids that can change the shape of a chain?  Also, do you think there any amino acids that if a mutation caused an exchange for another, would cause the most damage?  Is it possible that the hydrophobic region could ""flip"" to the hydrophilic region this way?   A lot of people claim knowing the pkas of each chain is important but they seem so similar (1.0 vs 2.3).  Can you give an example of a question where it would be useful to know that the N-terminal of Lysine has a pka of  10.67 whereas that of Arginine is 12.10?"
Mcat,3dwtiq,RPSavant,2,Mon Jul 20 21:35:50 2015 UTC,"No problem, glad to help. Proline is the big one that, if it's substituted for a different AA, will drastically cause a change in secondary structure by making a big kink in the chain. However, any change of residue from one ""class"" to another, like an exterior hydrophilic to a hydrophobic, or a cysteine to a glycine (which might possibly eliminate a disulfide bridge) can have large effects on secondary and tertiary structure and possibly quaternary if its a polymer protein. You're right about the hydrophobic and hydrophilic region mismatching, as a substitution from like threonine to phenylalanine could compromise the intended conformation of a protein, or a substitution in the active site of an enzyme could completely eliminate the binding effect of the original residue that would bind to the substrate.  I would say pkas are important to know the basics of the terminal pkas and maybe the few deviations. Like that C terminus pkas are all roughly 2, give or take .5, and the N terminus pka is usually between 9-10. They almost certainly won't be overally specific in that regard. In the case of Arginine it's actually the side chain that has a 12 pka, and something like that would be useful to know in case they give you problem like:  An Arginine residue is held in a solution of pH 10, what is the net charge of the residue in this solution?"
Mcat,3dwtiq,Scorwegian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:58:12 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly just recommend learning the AA side chain structures. That generally allows you to know which group they'll fall into, and should be enough to get you through any higher-order folding question you come across."

Mcat,3dwtiq,MrMajorMajorMajor,3,Mon Jul 20 20:35:31 2015 UTC,"Those scores are really good. You'll do fine.  In the next two weeks, work on content review from AAMC specifically. Do the question packs for each section from AAMC - super helpful. For C/P, use Khan Academy questions for extra practice and work on memorizing. Important physics equations, amino acids, other important biochem structures, enzyme kinetics etc.   Honestly, the most important thing to do up until test day is get psychologically prepared for it. Try to get lots of sleep if possible. Go to bed and wake up how you will on test day. Eat the same foods at the same times as you will on test day. You don't want to get psyched out in any way.  Otherwise, looks like you're pretty much good to go! Good luck!"

I'm in the process of just learning all material and writing up notes which I will gladly share with you! But yeah, not sure if I'm what you're looking for my 7 hours a day will most likely start within 3 - 4 months of the test date.

My numbers went down due to fatigue/not sticking to the proper diet but I went whenever I could to blow off steam.

Mcat,3dw3kp,neur_onymous,2,Mon Jul 20 02:00:14 2015 UTC,"While I'm jumping the gun by answering this without receiving my scores (sat for the MCAT July 17th) I felt that NextStep was the best deal in terms of quality and representativeness of the actual exam.   I first used all 3 of my Kaplan exams and thought they were great, but I believe you have to purchase the entire 7 book set to get their 3 exams. Not a bad deal if you need content review books.  After Kaplan, I used TPR's free full length and felt that was a great test as well. Much easier than Kaplan and their P/S section was hilariously easy by comparison.   Then I used the AAMC full length, which is probably the best representation you'll get in terms of passage detail. Keep in mind that the content is the same but the questions are typically much easier than the real thing.  After that I purchased Exam 4 from ExamKrackers and absolutely regretted it. While their test content was decent (not outstanding by any means), the screen froze up on me during the C/P section and I had to restart the entire exam and lost most of my answers. I called their tech support who suggested I used a different browser. I did. Then the exam froze up on my during the B/B section in the alternate browser. I was furious about it so I sent the company an email describing my dissatisfaction and detailing exactly what happened. A week later they replied ""We're looking into it."" In summary, they are an awful company compared to others I used."
Mcat,3dw3kp,msixultra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:15:17 2015 UTC,"For Kaplan FL, don't you have to buy the full set? You can find EK FL x4 online for $50 each. I think Berkeley Review also has 3 for ~$100 total."
Mcat,3dvl7c,justintxc,3,Sun Jul 19 22:06:07 2015 UTC,"Use all KA passages and definitely buy the AAMC FL. KA passages are great not only in helping review concepts (like most of the content categories have at least one dedicated passage) but also in honing your experimental design and research skills. Having said that, I'm finding a lot of passages in the middle of their list to be waaay too short, so keep in mind that the real MCAT passages will be much harder and 2-3 times longer.  P.S. there were a few posts on reddit on getting 6 TPR and 3 Kaplan FLs, and someone on here shared a mediafire folder containing pdfs of the Kaplan and EK prep books (hint hint)."
Mcat,3dvl7c,basophil666,2,Sun Jul 19 23:11:38 2015 UTC,"If you're limited in budget, try to get the aamc fl and question pack for sure. Everything outside of that is optional. I think supplementing aamc material with khan academy passages is plenty of material to get a good score"

Mcat,3dvl7c,ksafrost,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:26:09 2015 UTC,"I recommend you use TPR for psych/soc. If you can get your hands on it, then you're good to go. I'm going through the first lecture of the EK psych/soc book right now, and it's missing a lot of info. If you look up the errata in the forums, they have a pdf with all the terms they didn't include that should have been included.  Note: the pdf's only say which terms missing and which section they belong to, outside of that, you gotta look it up on your own."

Mcat,3dwbum,cane37,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:46:11 2015 UTC,"7 hours a day for 6 days a week? For two months?  Fuck that. I think at that point you need to study smarter, not longer."
Mcat,3dwbum,avianrave,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:20:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I work 40 hours a week so no chance on the 7 hours a day. And I made 506. Really just need to improve by 3 or 4 points. I was thinking 4 weeks content review and then 5 weeks of practice passages/tests and review of that.
Mcat,3dwbum,-__---____-----,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:13:42 2015 UTC,Op how do you feel about your content review if you feel like you have a solid base skip to practice problems. 506 isn't a bad score so I'm guessing you were good on some sections? If you don't mind what was your scores by section obviously prioritize what you did bad in but depending on the section their are different strategies ie if its physics/ g Chem practice problems and more practice problems if its cars than it may be as simple as finding a good strategy to tackle it (but maybe not and you need to put in more work) if its bio then content review.
Mcat,3dwbum,-__---____-----,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:40:48 2015 UTC,my two strongest sections were chem and bio. Definitely just need more practice with CARs I think. Psych/soc was right about 55th percentile so not great but I am not really sure how to keep studying for it.

Mcat,3dwy5p,Nightwarrior1590,4,Mon Jul 20 05:48:55 2015 UTC,you still will have to take it off before entering the testing room.

Otherwise, AAMC will say ""theories of X (e.g. intelligence),"" and then you should memorize all relevant theories and their creators.  I was a neuroscience major and psych minor and didn't encounter anything unfamiliar on my exam, though. I also remember seeing a lot of ""I'm a psych major and don't think I need to study that much for this section"", and then come April and May a lot of ""DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THIS SECTION"". So I think it's important to keep that in mind."

Mcat,3dubt9,ev1hmr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:50:08 2015 UTC,"The quality of questions is appropriate. You should be able to answer all of them by the time you sit down for the real thing. The format of the MCAT hasn't really changed, just the content. All of the test prep materials from reputable companies is good to study, they just emphasize different things. TPR is well rounded with their materials, and the big science workbook is a great place to start practicing. You should study the content before you hit the problems though or you're wasting the resource."

I narrowed psych down to three components: verbal reasoning, memorization, and experimental analysis. With the time I had to study, I felt that CARS and BIO practice and psych/soc memorization would be more than necessary for the psych. I ended up getting 75th% (~10 on old test) and I think I'd done better only if I memorized more."

Mcat,3dvgoz,titsmcgehee30,3,Sun Jul 19 21:28:03 2015 UTC,"The analogy that works well for this is the Venturi flow meter. It's basically the application of the Bernoulli equation, but there's no height change. This is the best image I could find. With constant height, you remove the ""pgh"" values from both sides of Bernoulli's equation:  P1 + 0.5pv1'2' = P2 + 0.5pv2'2'. I find it easier to just set one side as a constant to get the following:  P + 0.5pv2 = x With this equation, ""x"" is constant, and you have ""Pressure"" and ""velocity"" as your variables. If you increase one, you necessarily decrease the other.  So, we combine two equations:  the continuity equation (Q=v1A1=v2A2) and Bernoulli's equation. If you decrease area, you increase velocity. And if you increase velocity, you necessarily decrease pressure.   Also, I'm pretty sure that the equation P=FA is for hydrostatics, not fluid dynamics."
Mcat,3dvgoz,AlbastruDiavol,2,Mon Jul 20 01:00:23 2015 UTC,Pascals says the pressure is the same at both points because liquids are incompressible. Force goes down with area.
Mcat,3dvgoz,nper7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:49:39 2015 UTC,"The pressure is the same at both circular points. It is the force variable that changes in the P=F/A application to hydraulics.

Mcat,3dv30q,beepbots,3,Sun Jul 19 19:31:56 2015 UTC,You can only register for and attempt the test three times in a calendar year. I'm pretty sure voiding an exam counts as one of those three attempts.

Mcat,3dv30q,redxalert,2,Mon Jul 20 03:24:32 2015 UTC,You can only take the test seven times in your lifetime now. So that's a reason. I guess if you wanted to wait longer than three years to apply to med school again it would matter.
Mcat,3dv30q,MasterChief118,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:05:59 2015 UTC,"You should absolutely not take the test if you are not ready and you think you want to go in just to void your score. Voiding is not something that should be done if you think you didn't do well, voiding should only be done if something serious happened during the test to compromise your score (sickness, narcolepsy, panic attack).   Also, if you aren't taking the test until September, you should be about half way through your prep and by no means feel ready. Do the best you can, don't void your score."

Paying 300 dollars to take a test that is never scored and that you can't review is a waste of time, money, and a seat that someone else could use to take the exam seriously.   If you've already done all the practice problems out there, you should be ready to take the real test. If you haven't, then there's no need to take the real thing as practice."

Mcat,3dszph,basophil666,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:55:32 2015 UTC,"the majority of questions link back to the passage. however, you still need to understand the principles behind the topics that are tested. that being said, look at the specifics but make sure to also form a big picture from the specifics. more like a deductive approach. i haven't gotten my score back, so i'm not sure if this actually helped me at all, but i did feel like i knew what i was doing when i was taking the test.  the best thing to do is to do a bunch of practice questions, while taking 1-2 practice tests per week. you're supposed to test your analytical and reasoning skills, because the mcat ""isn't about content."" it's about how can you find the answer to the questions with the information that you're given. what i realized after taking the test is that no matter how much i studied the day before, it wouldn't have really helped.  i used tpr self-study course, khan, aamc sample packs, aamc official guide questions, and aamc 2015 practice test.   the sciences are pretty straight forward.  for verbal, i relied on the sample packs, because the review companies don't have a clue on how to test it. their strategy is gimmicky, because it doesn't work for everyone, even though they make it sound like it does. so if you're doing good on those verbal tests from the princeton or kaplan, try out the aamc stuff. plus, it's straight from the company that makes the mcat. it would be foolish not to buy it. besides, this section is all about what works for you. don't put it off. make sure to do 2-3 passages a day and try to figure out what you did to do well. was is the passage, the questions, how you analyzed the text, etc  for psychology, i looked at khan and i read the book. i just used the FL to test myself on psych. for some reason, i just get psych, and i always have. it's a mix of passage based info, vocab, theories, and knowing how people are or how they act in society (disparities, bystander effect, etc). this is real world stuff. stuff that sheltered people or people with book smarts don't grasp quite well. all of you nerds out there need get cultured. ;)  here's something simple that i made up: if the nucleus is subjected to an electric field, in which direction is the nucleus going?  a. it's accelerating toward the positive plate b. it's moving constantly toward the negative plate c. it's accelerating toward the negative plate d. it remains stationary in the electric field  this questions is testing your knowledge of electrochemistry. what you have to know: 1. nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons. it's positive, because the proton is positive, and the neutron is neutral. 2. electric field goes from positive to negative plate. the field also creates an electric force. 3. whenever a force is present, acceleration is experienced and the velocity IS NOT constant. the velocity increases or decreases depending on the direction of the force/acceleration. 4. like charges repel, and opposites attract.  from the knowledge you've obtained, you would choose letter c. a nucleus is an electric field will accelerate toward the negative plate. if you didn't read it carefully, you might think the question was referring to a neutron, therefore you would've picked letter d.  hope this helps! good luck!"

Mcat,3dqpdn,neur_onymous,15,Sat Jul 18 15:08:44 2015 UTC,"[Disclaimer: While I'm not a fan of physics and gen chem, give me a calculator and I'll give you the answer. But I can't math without a calculator. I mean I can, but not in any reasonable amount of time. I'll take orgo and biochem over physics and gen chem every time. So if you like to do physics calculations in your sleep and gen chem makes you feel all happy inside, then you probably won't relate to this post. But for everyone else, here's how I felt after taking today's test...]  (As soon as I got home from the test, I opened up Word and wrote down how I felt about the whole thing, which is why this post is so long. Reading over the posts from previous MCAT test takers always helped me so I wanted to post this in case it helps someone else.)  C/P: This section was brutal…and then sometimes incredibly easy. There were a few questions where I was kind of like, what’s the catch? Some of the pseudo-discretes and FSQ’s were so easy and basic that I felt like it was a trick.    Then on the other end of the spectrum there were some ridiculously hard passages and questions. A ton of physics and gen chem. You have to know equations or you’re screwed. Although I knew the equations and I was still screwed. The thing was I did the calculations like I had on my practice exams (which is to say I’d round the numbers and guesstimate the answer, and it always worked), but today there were always two choices that could be the answer, depending on which way you rounded the numbers.   It was after I had done my rounding/guesstimating technique for the 3rd time, only to look up and realize it simply wasn’t good enough, that my heart began to hurt. And not in an anxiety-driven panic attack sort of way…it was more like when the love of your life suddenly tells you that despite all the one-sided, relentless effort you’ve put into the relationship – despite all the sacrifices made and sweat and tears spilled – it’s simply not good enough – you aren’t good enough. I was heartbroken.   The worst part was these were freebies I knew I could get 100% correct if I just did the math quickly. But it took me a long time to do the math and I felt like I was just watching time go down the drain. I thought the AAMC was moving away from these types of questions and I was excited about that, but question after question requiring calculations just broke my heart a little bit more.   CARS: After the heartbreaker that was C/P, I gave in to the Debbie Downer in me and figured CARS would probably also have every passage topic I dreaded (think: politics and government). But wait…these passages were awesome! There was only one passage that had to do with politics, and it wasn’t even the main theme. All the other passages were great. I even found myself nodding in agreement with a lot of points the authors made. There was hope after all!  Then I looked at the clock and realized that in my enjoyment, I had been leisurely reading the passages, soaking it all in as if I had my feet in the sand and not a care in the world. Once I realized that holy shit, this is the MCAT not Cabo, I knew I had to skip a passage (politics one) to save time. I was able to skim it at the end and guessed most of the answers, but all in all, I thought CARS was really good. I’d actually like to know the sources of some of those passages so I could read the full-length works!     B/BC: Coming off of my CARS-high, I was feeling pumped and ready to tackle this section. I love biology, physiology, and I just took biochem in the spring and loved it so I was prepared for this section. But while I wanted to remain on cloud-nine, AAMC was like, hey, remember when you were really heartbroken like 2 hours ago…that was pretty fun, why don’t we do that again. Seriously, this section had some of the toughest passages I’ve ever read (and I had to read dense biochem research articles for my class). I literally felt like I was trudging through mud, the passages were just so so rough. I would try incredibly hard just to glean some sort of hint about what the hell was going on with the experiments and what the hell the results meant from this experiment whose purpose I could not ascertain. I know amino acids backwards and forwards – structures, properties, pKa’s, etc – but there was no way I could apply that knowledge if I didn’t know what the purpose of the experiment was. I swear there was a paragraph from one passage where I only understood 3 words. And one of those words was “the”.   Psych/Soc: So after I finished the B/BC section, I just went straight through to P/S. No break, no time to catch my breath (okay maybe I did stare at the yes/no button for a brief contemplative moment of terror after I clicked “end break”). I was pretty much over the exam at this point and just wanted to get through the final 1.5 hr stretch.    But then I read the first passage and it was actually interesting and I understood everything the first time I read it! The experimental procedures were clear, the results understood, the graphs made sense, etc. I even predicted one of the questions! As I was reading the passage, I thought to myself, huh, what’s the point of including that in the study? And then one of the questions was like, “ What part of the study was completely unnecessary?” I literally pointed at the screen and proclaimed, “That’s what I said!” Finally, me and the AAMC were on the same wavelength.   It was smooth sailing with the rest of the passages…maybe one was a bit tougher than normal, but I finished with 33 minutes left. I really wanted to just end the test and go home, but I thought that I could possibly salvage at least some of the points lost from C/P & B/BC by getting as many P/S questions correct as I could. So I went back to the first passage and went through each of my answers one by one (I’m pretty sure I was delusional at this point). I skipped over the easy questions where I was absolutely sure I was correct, but for the harder questions, I made myself justify why I thought I was right, and if I didn’t know, then why I thought the other answers were wrong. This made me feel much better and I still ended up having 16 minutes to spare. But I ended there, knowing I had done everything I could. It was now up to the AAMC gods.   My Advice: This might seem strange, but I think the single best thing I did to prepare for this test was starting meditation / relaxation techniques a few months ago. I didn’t start it for MCAT purposes, just for general life purposes, but holy shit it helped today. I know for a fact that if I took this test a year ago, I would’ve been so fazed by the first few passages that it would’ve threw me completely off my game. I seriously maintained my composure no matter how ridiculous the questions or passages were. I never felt defeated, just a bit let down I would say.   The other two things that I think really helped me today were the AAMC question packs (their practice FL was so much easier than today’s test that I can’t even compare them, honestly) and any practice FL tests (I used Kaplan and NextStep). This is actually pretty random, but I wanted my brother to see how brutal MCAT questions are so I chose what I felt were the toughest passages of each section from nextstep tests to show him, and there were literally 2 questions today that were almost exactly like the passage questions. Of course, this is also just the luck of the draw, but I know that if I hadn’t chosen those passages to show my brother, I wouldn’t have known those answers.   I know I hated it when people would say that there’s really no way to study for this, but now I know what they meant. Still, here’s my advice: I would say take as many practice tests as you can…and they don’t have to be in a single setting. I took a bunch of FL practice tests, but usually did two sections a day. I know for a fact that P/S was so easy because of the practice tests I did. There wasn’t a single word or topic I hadn’t seen before. The thing is, when you take practice tests you don’t feel like you’re learning because it just seems like you’re answering questions. But when I went over the answers and then did questions for that same section a couple of weeks later, I saw a dramatic improvement. It was weird because it wasn’t like I was reading any books or writing notes, it was literally just the act of trying to retrieve information in my brain that made it stick so much better. So don’t limit yourself to just reading and content review. And also don’t think you need to take a practice FL in one sitting, you can always just pause it and pick right back up the next day. Of course, if you have the time to take a whole FL in one sitting then definitely try to do so; I work and I'm taking classes so I literally had no actual 8 hour timespan where I could take a real FL.   If you've read this far, at least you know you're dedicated to getting a good score, so just trust that you have the knowledge and you'll do fine. Good luck!"
Mcat,3dqpdn,insomniatea,3,Sun Jul 19 01:29:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with this mostly but my C/P was Biochem/Orgo heavy, which wasn't super fun. Other than that for the calculations I got away with dimensional analysis because I too can't quickly math without a calculator, especially on 2.5 hours of sleep."
Mcat,3dqpdn,redxalert,2,Sun Jul 19 04:03:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly, running on little sleep wasn't helpful. I seriously forgot how to do long division for a solid 10 seconds while I was doing a dimensional analysis problem.   So glad it's over...we did it!"
Mcat,3dqpdn,insomniatea,2,Sun Jul 19 15:04:17 2015 UTC,"I totally get it, I actually had the same problem on a question in c/p, but I'm trying not to lose sleep over it, ha. Good luck to you! high five"
Mcat,3dqpdn,redxalert,2,Sun Jul 19 16:00:19 2015 UTC,"wow very helpful! I had a few questions if you don't mind:  C/P: could you give an example of the math estimation off the top of your head, not specifically from the test?  B/BC: since you've read dense articles before, do you have a specific one in mind that resembles the convolutedness of the most difficult ones you encountered on the test?  P/S: how did you prepare for it in general?  Thanks."
Mcat,3dqpdn,basophil666,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:15:13 2015 UTC,"C/P: It was easy dimensional analysis stuff, but it just took me a long time to do without a calc. So something like ""You do 12 jumping jacks for 17 days, how many jumping jacks per second do you do?"" That's a random example!   B/BC: Honestly, they were so random that I don't know if I could think of any articles like it. But I'll look over what I had to read and let you know if I find anything resembling similar language.   P/S: I just did full-lengths of this section. I took Psychology online like 2 years ago, so I didn't really learn anything. But I will say that I do like psychology a lot and I'll usually read random articles (not peer-reviewed) that pop up here and there about psychology. Mainly neuroscience - that sort of thing, if that helps. And I loved watching the show Brain Games, the original episodes, which were like 1 hour. They did a bunch of vision tricks and memory stuff in those episodes and I think I had a couple of questions that I referred back to that show for!"

Mcat,3dqpdn,mcatasu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:09:57 2015 UTC,"I sat there looking at the screen for a while, but I know that I did really well on CARS and Psych/Soc so at least I have solid scores there. And C/P had some reallyyyy easy discrete questions, which was nice. They were just mixed in with really hard stuff. Same with B/BC. So I wasn't walking out with no points in those sections, but I don't like having to guess between 2 choices 85% of the time.   I think you'll do fine. Just be positive about getting it over with...that's definitely what helped me!"

Mcat,3dqpdn,basophil666,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:50:20 2015 UTC,"I think we tend to forget the stuff we know really well and focus on the tough questions, but that said, for C/P I would say it was like 60% hard and 40% easy. For B/BC I honestly can't remember the questions, I just remember the passages being so terrible. But I will say that if you don't know your lab techniques inside and out, you will struggle in that section. Everything else hidden somewhere in the passage, IRC."
Mcat,3dqpdn,insomniatea,9,Mon Jul 20 10:17:35 2015 UTC,"Damn, wow.   C/P: holy shit. More orgo than I thought but not by much. I can't even figure out what it was about it that made it difficult, but it was completely different than anything the AAMC has provided as practice for that section. Harder than kaplan's C/P  CARS: passages were longer than the dick C/P violated me with. Questions were easy though.   Bio/Biochem: alright so the number of enzymes with long letter/number combinations were laughable. Dense passages with confusing answer choices. Hardest section of the exam by far.   Psych: easier than psy 100 exams. On 3 occasions were there answer choices that weren't covered in Kaplan books, and none of them were the correct answers.  Congrats everyone!"

Also, could you provide some tips as to how you ""map out"" or read such biological passages? (i.e., do you read them like verbal passages?) Thanks & congrats!!"
Mcat,3dqpdn,daftypatty,4,Sat Jul 18 20:23:32 2015 UTC,"I just read them straight through. I had a much easier time understanding the Bio passages rather than the CARS passages. I even found some of the passages interesting.  Then again, I work in a basic science immunology lab and I have a MS in cancer biology. Literature review comes easy to me.  My advice to others: Have a solid understanding of experimental design. I would definitely highlight any hypothesis. Also think about any independent and dependent variables. Think about what they are using for positive and negative controls and why.  EDIT: A good place to start is knowing your blots, what biomolecule they detect, how it detects it and why you care about detecting it. From there, you can extrapolate those mechanisms to other tests that use similar mechanisms.  Very brief example:   Western Blots use antibody-antigen interactions to detect specific sites. If you recall, antibodies bind to antigens, which can be an exposed surface of a protein. For these tests to be useful, the antibodies should react to an antigen specific to the protein of interest and not bind non-specifically. Other experiments that include this interaction are ELISAs, microscopy or cytometry. Primary antibodies refers to the antibody detecting the antigen of interest. Secondary antibodies, labelled in a way that is quantitatively detectable, bind to the Fc region of the primary antibody.  Primary antibodies can be directly conjugated to detectable, but antibodies are relatively expensive and the conjugation process is an significant additional expense.  If all the primary antibodies share the same Fc region, they will be detected by the same secondary antibody.  If one uses primary antibodies with different Fc regions, you can use secondary antibodies with labels that one could discriminate from each other (such as a specific fluorescence color, or a heavy metal isotope tag that can be detected by mass spectrometry.) This can also be done with directly conjugated antibodies.  Controls for western blots include http://www.abcam.com/protocols/recommended-controls-for-western-blot  Positive control lysate and Negative control lysate are to test for antibody specificity. When you are reading a passage in the MCAT, you can reasonably assume that the antibody is highly specific to the protein they say it targets. ** May not be true if they ask a question or have an answer stem about the antibody-antigen interactions specify, then you need to be critical of the data they present (Did not appear as a question on my exam, but I imagine it could be tested)** Loading control is to obtain a normalized signal from each sample. This allows you to compare the relative amount of cells are in each sample. Ideally, the loading control should be detected equally between all samples. I have personally used beta-tubulin as loading control, but many others exist. From this, you can determine the relative detection between different antigens.  If the loading controls are all equal, but another antigen of interest has varying staining, then you can make an assumption that a particular protein is upregulated, downregulated, or eliminated.  Protein ladders let you characterize proteins by a known characteristic. Protein size ladders have proteins of known sizes that will separate differently via gel electrophoresis. This allows you to determine the size of the protein by a known quality."
Mcat,3dqpdn,avianrave,3,Sat Jul 18 20:59:10 2015 UTC,Definitely being able to comprehend the passage. No amount of content review can prepare you for that. You have to know how to sift through the passage for what's important
Mcat,3dqpdn,nper7,5,Sun Jul 19 00:51:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed  I think they need to create an entire section on biochem science article reading/analyzation etc on khan academy if they are truly serious about providing a free resource to prep for the exam. Otherwise what's the point of khan academy if you can't get through understanding the experiment in time on the test?  The use of the insane experimental passages in bio/c/p is really putting those who haven't majored in biochem at an extreme disadvantage. They say they want a more diverse test and assessment...but if that's the case, level the playing field for those who have psych experience because right now it looks like the psych section is tacked on almost as a joke.  I think they chose some of the dumbest, most simplistic research based passages I've seen.  At least put insane/good experimental psych passages in the psych section if you're gonna keep it consistent. The bullshit they put in the psych section is amature in comparison. People must come out of this test thinking psych research is simplistic as hell based on those experiments. (Definitely some tough/ridiculous questions in the psych section tho.)"
Mcat,3dqpdn,halpmeplz01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"I think the rigor is supposed to be different for the bio section vs. p/s. Biochemistry, the course from which the bio section derives its material, is usually a 300-level course. In contrast, the p/s section derives its material from 100-level soci classes. While I don't necessarily agree with this (especially since the two sections are of equal ""weight"" in the final score), AAMC was very clear about it. I do agree that the Khan Academy could use a solid tutorial on analyzing the passages though."

Emailed aamc to see about it. Also, being informed via PPP up window I had 30 mins left in the exam (when I really had 22 mins) was pretty crappy form for this test.  Come on.  A lot of C/p seemed very ""old-mcat"" style, not really like the AAMC FL.  Not gonna talk about the test beyond that because everyone pretty much summed it up. All I can say is that AAMC seems like they're still trying to figure out this new test as well. All I'm gonna say in addition: know everything. Don't neglect categories they claim to have de-emphasized on the new exam. (Referring to C/p). Whoever said it was okay to fucking power wash the outside of our building during a test day....really?  Seriously that was loud as hell - wall vibrating....and even with earplugs I got distracted.  It was 75- 80deg in my testing room (saw thermostat) and I felt like that's just not ok.

Mcat,3dqpdn,Aryanenzo,3,Mon Jul 20 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"I feel obligated to share since I used these threads trough out my preparations. First of , I want to say is the MOST important thing is your mind set. I went in with a positive attitude and I remained smiling the hole time. Sounds silly but it's better then nothing.   My reaction: based on my exam, C/P was the hardest section. Surprised on how many questions in the other sections either were paired with an essay but couldent use the essay to answer ( only prior knowledge ) or gimme questions, which thankfully were there. Not as much biochem as people are making out to be. And honestly a lot more gen chem. mine had more gen Chem then physics.  CARS was longer. Consensus there. BIO two essays that required intense concentration . I didn't by any means read fast and I never had an issue with time. So if you were like me and worried about time ( I never practiced timing my self ) just breath and I have faith in you ! P/S more experimental base then my bio. Kaplan and khan will help you out her 95%. I watched EVERY khan video regarding these topics. It's all there.   Just relax. Breathe before the exam and it's over before you know it. I was worried about fatigue but that actually never affected me."
Mcat,3dqpdn,Evan27SC,4,Sat Jul 18 21:09:28 2015 UTC,"Bio: I thought it was difficult but I think I managed to pull it off, it required quite a bit of thinking. Like mind fuck type thinking. I barely knew my name for the psych section. If I didn't have my research experience as a undergrad and weren't a biochem major I can't even imagine how hard this would've been.   CARS: pretty fair, 2 or 3 difficult passages in the middle. Very similar to the FL except harder and longer but the FL is the closest thing. The AAMC 2015 guide is close too so use those.   Phys/chem: Difficult as always for me. I managed to finish on time this time.   Psych: What the FUCK, I literally ate TPR, EK and 60% of the terms i had never seen. Extremely hard section for me. Oh god....my advice would be use Khan academy and TPR. DO NOT BOTHER WITH EK, it covers maybe 15-20% of what you need to know. Absolutely awful.   Edit: Seems like out of the 6 guessed I remember from psych, 5 were right. Ahh the process of elimination."
Mcat,3dqpdn,TodayInBirmingham,5,Sun Jul 19 04:00:55 2015 UTC,"hardest section for me seemed to be C/P, maybe bc of it coming first, but it had some dense passages. Next most difficult would've been P/s just cause so many answer choices were in play. Worried solely bc I wasn't 100% sure on many questions I had. CARS seemed doable and basically that meant easy at first but progressively got more difficult and longer, although at the end it sort of felt that it let up some. B/B seemed easiest to me and I'm not sure why some people are saying why it was tough. A lot of question were either you know it or you don't factual type questions (where you wouldn't be able to deduce)."
Mcat,3dqpdn,gradstudent12345,4,Sat Jul 18 21:37:57 2015 UTC,My advice: PRINT OUT THE LIST OF TOPICS.  I think its routinely ignored that AAMC puts out a finite list of topics.  I felt like they never really strayed from that list on my exam.
Mcat,3dqpdn,mcatasu,4,Sat Jul 18 21:59:48 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone.  Just a brief intro on my preparation and background.  I have a Masters in Biochem and studied for about 3 months (my estimate is ~20-30 hours a week).  I bought the Exam Krackers and went through that and went to a Chapters/Barnes and Noble type store and went through the Kaplan books on the shelf ;) .  Briefly, I thought Exam Krackers was best in providing a solid overview of all relevant concepts.  Kaplan went into too much nitty gritty detail, some of which (I checked) wasn't even on the AAMC list of concepts tested.  So be sure to check out that list!  Especially for the Psych section as several concepts there weren't in the Exam Krackers book! However, Kaplan was useful in providing more sample questions for sections I wanted more practice on (i.e. acids/bases, redox, metabolism in particular was great I thought etc.).  Here's my impression of the July 18th test:  C/P-  As I mentioned, I have a Master's in Biochem so that will likely affect my interpretation of the level of difficulty of this section.  As several others have posted, this section was orgo and biochem heavy.  I was surprised at how little general chemistry and physics was tested.  I have read handfuls of reactions from test-takers that took the exam in April/May/June and from what I can gather, some of the most useful advice would be to know your amino acids cold (as you probably have guessed by now).  Know the one letter and three letter abbreviations.  Know which are basic and acidic, and what this means in terms of charge at physiological pH, and how this might affect ionic interactions i.e. enzymes-substrates.  I think taking the time to nail that would provide the most bang for your buck.    Critical Analysis-  This is usually my worst section.  I was very pleasantly surprised when I took the AAMC FL practice that I got 87% correct.  Normally I do worse.  And the real MCAT was harder than the practice.  I found the answer choices more ambiguous here versus the practice.  Not sure what suggestions to make here other than practice??  I didn't really study for this tbh.  I thought it would be a waste of time.  I just did the EK book.  If I had to do it again, I still would not have studied any further.    Bio-  I thought this section wasn't bad.  As you know, most passages are experiment based.  This is why I thought EK did a great job.  All of their practice tests are experiment based. I thought even the EK practice exams were easier than the real one.  Not much physiological systems tested here I thought.  Most questions were at the cellular level.  I think the most important take-home message (one of which EK mentions) is this: the MCAT will throw difficult terms and convoluted experiments at you.  You should expect this.  You will just have to determine what simple concept from your studying is being tested here.  That has, and probably will trip up a lot of people.  But if you can read the passages to get the jist of what the researchers are testing and looking for while ignoring the complex enzyme names or compound names, you will have a much better shot at succeeding here.    Psych-  Pretty straightforward I think.  As I mentioned, go over that AAMC list of concepts tested!!  I read on here before that some only did that the day or two before the exam and were in for a rude awakening.  So please, check it out and just google all the terms and write down the definitions on a master sheet of paper that you can use for your reference.  That's what I did.  Overall I was pretty comfortable with this section.  Not the easiest section, not the hardest either.  Summary-  All in all, I found the Critical Analysis section the trickiest because the answer choices were ambiguous (that is likely just me and the way I am though, I always have trouble with the verbal section).  I am just praying I didn't do too poorly on it.  Bottom line I guess is don't let convoluted passages/experiments deter you.  Remember that the questions are usually easier than the passages would make it seem (usually, but not always the case, maybe 80% of the time).  Any questions, let me know."

Mcat,3dqpdn,kha1ees1,4,Mon Jul 20 21:44:33 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I felt like the real thing today was on par with the difficulty of a TPR full length. I took all four and feel like they were pretty representative. Except for psych. Psych is a wild shot in the dark. Know everything. Don't stress much over orgo. Know your physics formulas."
Mcat,3dqpdn,basophil666,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"Our physics wasn't difficult, really. But if one didn't know the formulas, several low hanging points would have been lost."

Mcat,3dqpdn,akdn91,2,Sat Jul 18 20:31:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that the experimental questions today were worse than the TPR FLs, no."
Mcat,3dqpdn,undercookdpork,3,Sat Jul 18 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"Depending on which test I got... all i know is...   Bio was hella hard, C/P was pka chemistry overkill, Cars wasn't bad and Psych was kinda tricky."
Mcat,3dqpdn,daftypatty,3,Sat Jul 18 21:40:18 2015 UTC,"There's probably only two sets of exams, right? It seems like one was orgo heavy while the other was physics/gen chem heavy... I had the latter and thought that the most difficult section was probably the psych.  C/P - it was actually fairly straightforth. At most few orgo q's, but rest were Gen chem and physics. Lots of calculations which I thought were fairly simple as they give you units and you just have to play around a bit.  CARS - first few were easy and got done in a jiffy and then I got reckless and started getting bogged down trying to sniff out trick questions. But most were comprehensible, I finished with few min to spare, but I'm sure I missed the overall points of the authors on few passages so this will be my lowest section  Bio/Biochem - I guess I got the easy one. Other than a question here and there, passages were straightforward w/ most of the info in them.  Psych/Soc - some ppl said that this was the hardest and I'm inclined to agree. I studied the Kap, Khan, and EK. Still encountered few terms that I haven't seen before. I think the trick with this section is that while rote memorizations is definitely important for success, you're just going to have to do as many practice problems as you can so you'll understand the minor nuances between different terms. This way, you're more prepared for any terms out of left field and can ascertain the answers through process of elimination.   Overall, it was def easier than the June test."
Mcat,3dqpdn,undercookdpork,2,Sat Jul 18 21:13:53 2015 UTC,Where can we get more practice for the psych/soc section other than Khan and the official materials? I don't have access to TPR 2015 workbook :/ Would you recommend nextsteps psych/soc maybe?
Mcat,3dqpdn,basophil666,3,Sat Jul 18 21:39:06 2015 UTC,"I bought the TPR book for psych/soc and it wasn't that great...I just mainly used it for the 3 FLs. Tbh, berkeley's are the best (i have the older editions, but I'm sure their new ones are going to be great as well). I bought 5 nextsteps FLs and they were decent at getting me prepared for the exam conditions. If you've exhausted all the free practice problems offered online, I suggest you just go to the nearest barnes and noble bookstore and go through all the problems. They don't care as long as you don't use their access codes to get the online access. In terms of big picture, I suggest Examcrackers. They did a nice job of tying psych/soc all together into the big picture that connects all ostensibly discrete topics together. The drawback is that they miss a lot of details which you can fill it through khan and other test prep like kaplan.   I know this gets said a lot around the sub, but if you're sticking to the content, that's not the way to approach this test...I know I initially went over my notes like a thousand times trying not to miss any details (ineffective), but you just have to do as many practice problems as you can get your hands on and learn through the mistakes. For me, I wanted to review the content so that I could ace the practice FLs building my confidence before the test, but really once you have the gist of the contents, nitty gritty details stick much better in your head when you're learning from your mistakes imo.  Hope this helps, mayne."
Mcat,3dqpdn,undercookdpork,2,Sat Jul 18 20:50:28 2015 UTC,"In general you'd recommend doing high-volume passage practice leading up to the exam (supplementing with relevant review of unknown terms), correct?  Also, what percent of the questions in natural and social sciences were research design/experimental based? How straightforward were they? And briefly how had you prepared for those question types?"
Mcat,3dqpdn,basophil666,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:39:35 2015 UTC,"Majority (>3/4) are based on experiments with data presented. Sometimes you just have a passage of texts. But overall, I would say that averaging all of the passages I've encountered, back ground information could straight up answer 1 or at most 2 questions per passage. The rest involved sniffing out clues to address the inquiries (you still need background info for this as well). So the more practice problems you do, the better prepared you'll be at dissecting data and info in the passage to answer majority of the questions. This is the case for C/P and Bio imo.   For psych/soc, I presumed that it was going to littered with research methodologies questions (validities, biases, errors, etc.) b/c the section is new and research methodologies are great way to test your logical reasoning and deductive aptitude. And I saw a lot of these questions on nextstep and few on other FLs. These questions do come up on P/S def more than the other sections, but it really doesn't comprise a sig portion (but you should still know all of them).  Psych/soc is a 50/50 split. There are passages of case studies where you rely on nuances of theories and definition to determine the answers. And there are other passages that have data presentations like the other science sections. So you can get by this section on rote memorizations b/c they tend to be a bit more straightforward. But to truly master it, you need to do practice problems to get an overall understanding grasping the subtle differences (e.g. diff between stereotype threat and self-fulfilling prophecies).  Before my first exam, I scoured April/May threads on SDN and here to get an understanding of what the new exam was going to be like. This is just my opinion, but the advice of going to pubmed to read scientific literature is a bit of an overkill. Even though the test preps aren't reflective of the actual exam (and all the commentaries will attest to this), if you're able to break down the questions to analyze what you're being tested on (content, application, analysis, comparison, etc.), most of the test preps are useful. TBR/Khan were great for content reviews and EK/NS were great for applying the knowledge. I did all these practice problems and was mindful of things I could take away from my mistakes. First it was just not knowing the content, then it was learning to apply different related topics from the bigger picture, and finally noticing the details for the trick questions. As you incrementally improve, you begin to catch more details and can even easily pick out what information in the passage/question stems are there to trick the test takers.   Sorry for the wall of text, but hope this was informative. I will end by saying there's no foolproof plan to succeeding at mcat b/c everybody's diff. So take my advice with a grain of salt and if it works for you, then use it. If not, tweak it to your needs to maximize your chances of succeeding. Good luck!"
Mcat,3dqpdn,undercookdpork,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:56:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks. For the natural and social science passages, this has been my reading strategy I'm practicing for as many experimental passages I can find: read quickly through background paragraphs while mentally noting the topic discussed; then visualize as much of the experiment being discussed as possible and summarize the hypothesis and general result. From all the paragraphs, I make sure to note down cause-effect concepts (e.g. convoluted biochemical pathways, proposed correlations, etc.) in a visual/symbolic diagram (I've made my own set of symbols to specify increase/decrease, inhibition/stimulation, and other things).   This has definitely helped me with challenging research passages in Khan as well as in TPR FLs; before this I used to get several wrong when they go into convoluted experiments, but using this I rarely need to go back to the passage for passage-specific questions while improving my general comprehension of the passage. Of course, the downside is the time-investment and the fact that none of the prep companies resemble the AAMC. So my question is would this help decode these very challenging passages in the natural and social sciences? On the test, I hope to find a good compromise in the time investment of this and its efficacy."
Mcat,3dqpdn,basophil666,2,Sat Jul 18 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"yea, this is really meticulous which is a good thing! you're covering all the bases. I think what you'll realize as you keep doing this is that your heuristics start kicking in and you're able to digest and tackle problems much more efficiently. Yes you can dissect the passages, but these tools are all means to an end. The end of choosing the right answer to the question. Spend minimal time to answer the question.  My approach to C/P, Bio, P/S is I just read the questions first. I don't even look at the passages (sometimes if I don't understand the question stem, I skim the passage to get better understanding). After I get a sense of what the question is asking, I refer to the passage and just scan until I pick out info that can help solve the question. It doesn't work for all passages/problems, but it really saves alot of time for me not having to read the whole passage. But your way is also effective. Like you mentioned, if you were to implement that during the exam, it could cost you a lot of time so you would have to adjust accordingly.  Idk when you're taking the test, but if you can find any FLs, use your strategies. See if it's effective without costing too much time. There's value in understanding the overall topic, but with science questions, you have to have a knack of picking out only the details that are needed to efficiently answer the question.  Tl;dr - You're on the right trajectory. As you get more familiar with tackling passages/problems, you just need to tweak your strategies to be more efficient."

Overall very straightforward except for maybe one passage, on par with if not easier than the FL.  CARS: Passages were longer than what I had seen on the AAMC FL, basically on par with Kaplan/EK/NS in terms of length but questions and answers were not very tricky. Slightly harder than AAMC FL  Bio/Biochem: Harder than the AAMC FL but manageable. Felt like there were a good amount of ""gimmies"" but I didnt study for this section as much as the others so they werent really gimmies for me.  Psych: Hardest section of the 4 but very manageable. Again, I wish I could have studied more bc a lot of the questions were straight forward. I would highly reccomend Khan Academy videos for this. I mostly used Kaplan and threw in some Khan at the end but felt like more of the questions lined up with the Khan teachings.   Overall: Practice with Kaplan/EK/NS/TBR passages helped me read dense passages and these ones felt very light in comparison. In terms of practice and similarities, AAMC materials >>> anything else. Questions felt like they were taken straight off of the Qpacks or FL from AAMC."
Mcat,3dqpdn,aquatictiger2,3,Sun Jul 19 10:36:44 2015 UTC,"Took it yesterday  All the sections were manageable for the most part, Bio was definitely hardest section for me (I think I missed some easy discretes/stupid mistakes)    Timing wasnt an issue at all for me.  I had 15 min left in Physics, 15 in CARS, 5 in Bio, and 45-50 in Psych.    Hoping for the best at this point, averaged 80% on official AAMC test.  Let the long waiting game begin."

Very had O Chem passages.....I was told there was minimal O Chem and mostly just about functional groups but holy shit there was a lot of O Chem and most was hard, also quite a bit of bio chem and when I say minimal physics I mean I literally had to use 3 physics formulas and they only tested 2 concepts....... Prediction: 125-127 Bio/Biochem: holy shit again but this time just know if u did well on the AAMC FL BIO u will do well here as well. I didn't and suffered. Very similar to the FL....I wasted my time memorizing so many facts but literally 90% of questions, even some discretes were all about critical thinking not facts so I was screwed over big time.I hope my educated guesses were right, on many of the questions. Oh and lol @ anyone who spends anytime at all memorizing cycles and substrates they are all given. just know aa. Prediction: 124-126 CARS: My best section usually, similar to FL- a bit harder and longer passages but not by much. Finished with 5 seconds left lol. Prediction: 128-129 Psyc: 90% of the shit I learned was not even asked except they did like a few terms and asked them in different ways in 2-3 questions (obvs not saying which) but you could eliminate a lot of the choices. And to the autistic people who keep saying ""screw Kaplan, use Khan"" I ONLY used Kaplan and there was not a single word I never seen before. Prediction 129-130 Overall: I thought bio got to me....and was shocked at how so much of the shit I studied for in all subjects was note even mentioned at all in any way, best strategy is to work on critical thinking skills and don't spend time on content review at all. Overall Prediction:506-512 so about 80% percentile as you can tell bio killed my score probably, besides that I did very good EDIT: I just read the reaction threads any everyone seems to agree with met that bio section was hard as f so i hope this means the grading curve will be nicer"

Mcat,3dqpdn,DoctorHill,3,Sun Jul 19 04:13:55 2015 UTC,"lol make sure you study orgo  Chem/phys:  I'm glad I do chemistry research because I think that would have been tougher without it. Lots of stuff appeared there that I wouldn't have expected from previous test-takers reactions   CARS: didn't think this was bad.   Bio/Biochem: some of the experiments in this section were DENSE AF. Definitely the hardest section for me. Lots of the discretes were super easy though.  Psych/soc: Easy, pretty basic. Some vocab I had never encountered but for the most part really straightforward."

Mcat,3dqpdn,MCAT_Throw_Away,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:42:37 2015 UTC,Can you please elaborate on what made B/Biochem section passages dense? Like were they pretty much journal articles? Do any of the KA passages come close?
Mcat,3dqpdn,ppuoft,4,Sat Jul 18 18:11:32 2015 UTC,"Fist off, a tip for all future test takers, get to your test center 45 minutes EARLY!! Because I got to the parking lot 45 minutes early, but the layout of the place was extremely confusing and the building where the MCAT was being held marked by a 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper with an arrow pointing to it...from about 200 feet away from said building...and unfortunately behind a parked lawnmower. Basically spent almost 40 minutes walking all over the place until I eventually found the testing center!  Anyways, onto the test.  C/P: Two words, Organic Chemistry! Damn, I was hoping for a physics/gen chem intensive section but instead just got sexually violated in ways I didn't think possible. A real bummer to start out on. Oh, and amino acids make several guest appearances (surprise surprise). Also, Pro Tip, make sure you don't get confused between Arginine and Asparagine because I did, and I wasted several precious seconds because of that.   CARS: Not bad actually. The passages were about a paragraph longer than usual, but having been on this subreddit long enough, I prepared for that so I didn't run out of time. It was a close shave though! Some tricky questions but mostly straight forward. Also, totally surprised with the quantum physics thrown into one of the passages!  Biochem (with some bio): Usually my strongest section. And today was no exception, but it was definitely harder than the practice FL. Really experimentally heavy and knowing amino acids were essential. Managed to finish 6 minutes early, but I definitely had to guess on at least 5 questions.   P/S: Surprisingly well actually. TPR Psych/Soc prepared me well for this, but not because TPR is actually any good. It's mostly that the MCAT gods decided to take pity after what they did to me in the first section and presented me with a section with lots of vocab straight from the book. Yeah, there were one or two where the answer choices had some unknown terminology, but nothing near the horror stories I've read on other reaction threads. By the very nature of this section, however, another test may bring completely different results. Also, experimental design featured heavily, so it would be wise to study your experimental designs and terminology. A bunch of low hanging fruit can be gotten this way.   Overall, the following (extremely optimistic) score predictions: C/P: 127 CARS: 130 Biochem: 130 Psych: 129  Overall: 516"
Mcat,3dqpdn,MCAT_Throw_Away,2,Sat Jul 18 18:23:03 2015 UTC,which books did u use
Mcat,3dqpdn,ppuoft,2,Sat Jul 18 18:25:27 2015 UTC,"TPR. I also took their course. The Psyc/Soc was slightly subpar (true for most companies) and their biochem was subpar was well. Their CARS was excellent though. Really prepared you well.   I used this to learn the metabolic pathways. http://anscollege.org/ebook/Zoology/Basic%20Concepts%20in%20Biochemistry.pdf Memorize the substrates and enzymes for glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. For the other pathways, know what goes in and out, how they're interconnected, and how hormones regulate them. You can find out the pathways on the AAMC content outline."

Response that these people probably felt this way because they didn't prepare probably. The MCAT disguises simple questions in a context that a typical undergrad has probably never been exposed to before.  People have been saying the MCAT isn't a memorization game for this reason. If Joe spends 3 months memorizing Kaplan cover to cover, and doing prep company fls that mostly test rote memorization, he's going to come out feeling he just wrote the hardest test of his life.  Basically, don't get discouraged. Prepare properly and learn from others mistakes"
Mcat,3dqpdn,smartmoron186,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:47:05 2015 UTC,C/P: This is normally my worst section but for some reason I didn't think it was terrible. Physics is my worst subject but nothing really that complicated from it CARS: Not too bad honestly Bio: Passages were very dense and what is normally my best section I think ended up being my worst Psych: I think I was so burnt out at this point that I was having trouble understanding what were pretty simple passages. Looking back I definitely think I could have done better here

Mcat,3ds3sm,Masribrah,2,Sat Jul 18 22:40:25 2015 UTC,"I just happen to be in the same boat as you and I agree completely. Confidence is everything. Took the old MCAT and that didn't go as well as I would've liked it to and was supposed to finally get it over with today but decided I need more time and couldn't reschedule so I took it and voided.   Most important thing is definitely confidence. If you have a level head then you won't freak out when you see a page full of organic pathways you didn't know existed. Just answer the question and don't let the passage make you flip shit. YOU KNOW THE ANSWER. You've always known it. One of my worst habits was self-doubt and blaming the AAMC for all of my woes. The truth is that the answer is either in the passage (if it's an experimental question) or its somewhere in your head but you're too busy foaming at the mouth to access it right now. Calm the fuck down and kill this test.   I agree with most of what OP said about the sections. Chem/Phys and the Bio section were mostly experimental and a little bit of regurgitation, but if you're honest with yourself and you should know the topic and have a good shot at the right answer. CARS is CARS is verbal, not much to say there. Psych was mostly memorizing the facts and there were some experimental questions but those were mostly questions about setting up experiments (e.g. longitudinal vs. cross-sectional or independent vs. dependent variables)   At the end of the day though, confidence is key! And as long as you know your basics and believe in yourself then this test is totally doable and you can conquer it!!"

Mcat,3dsh3y,theateroftheme,2,Sun Jul 19 00:50:09 2015 UTC,"So, I've had pretty similar numbers to you, especially with TPR (although yours are a little higher, I probably average 60-70 percent). Take note, I found those passages pretty damn hard, significantly harder than any AAMC material I've done. Same with EK, even after months of studying, and averaging pretty good scores on AAMC, I got wrecked sometimes with around 55-60 percent, which can be kind of demoralizing. I think the logic of those companies is just plain off sometimes. They try to be very tricky and convoluted, and many times I'll fall for those tricks (which don't show up too often on AAMC), so I took my scores as ones that come from material that would be among the hardest of AAMC. I've done both Qpacks for AAMC, and average around 75 to 80 percent right. And that's after about 45 passages, so I feel I have a much better sense of what AAMC expects, and it is dissimilar from what TPR and EK expect (IMO). But, nonetheless, it was good practice. Just keep chugging, find a method that works for you, and get it down come test time. I'm taking the MCAT August 6th, and I believe I'll be ready for CARS after doing the AAMC material. Best of luck to you, and don't get too down on those scores. It's just practice after all."
Mcat,3dsh3y,clay1123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:23:59 2015 UTC,I am glad I'm not the only one. Thanks for your advice. Did you do the question packs all in one sitting? I am treating them as valuable as gold and have only done half of the first one. Of course I time the passages though.
Mcat,3dsh3y,clay1123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:58:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't do it in one sitting, I spaced it to where I did about 9 passages for the first couple days, and on the second Qpack, I did about 4 per day. Overall, it lasted me about a week and half, since some days I did FL's and didn't touch the Qpack. I'll also say, I started off not too hot because I kind of psyched myself out over starting AAMC material, and it definitely interfered with my scores in the beginning. After like 3 passages, I realized I was just being an idiot and my scores went up dramatically after I started using my usual method, and realizing it wasn't nearly as hard as the other stuff I've seen."
Mcat,3dsh3y,Laminectomy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:20:47 2015 UTC,"The logic in CARS is pretty inorganic, that is, it isn't universal reasoning. Often, passages ask you to take the perspective of the author to answer the questions - the easiest questions are detail oriented, and the hard ones are interpretation and application of an understanding of the themes of the passage from the authors perspective.   Next time you have a CARS passage, and it's short, read the whole thing, and physically write down your prediction to each question, then see how right on you are. Even for analogies, which are probably the biggest crock of shot the test throws at you.   If you aren't guessing right 50% or so, before looking at the answers, it's a problem in perspective that can really only be fixed by practice. Read more passages and map the goals and tone."

Mcat,3drkxt,Stopmakingascene,5,Sat Jul 18 19:50:56 2015 UTC,"one tip that helped me with CARS in general: look for the answer that NECESSARILY MUST  follow from the passage. If it only MIGHT follow, it's probably not the correct answer.  e.g. (a very stupid example but you get the idea): in the passage the author thinks yellow foods are better than green ones. Therefore, it MIGHT follow that they love lemons, but not NECESSARILY. But it NECESSARILY follows that they like bananas more than limes.   Also, although it often asks what  the author would ""most"" agree with (or something like that), there is usually only one answer that is correct at all, as opposed to being several correct answers with one being more correct than the others."
Mcat,3drg1c,ksafrost,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:08:47 2015 UTC,"The EK schedule lists ""Take In-Class Exam... Review it"" as one item.  You may want to think of this as two things, with Review being the more important.  Can you think of certain topics/areas where you are confident? Now go look at questions where those ideas are tested. Did you get it right? Awesome, make a note of it and move on. Get it wrong? Figure out why.  Do the same for areas you are more shaky in. If you're getting questions right, why are you still not confident here? Identify the thing you're uncertain of and brush up. If you're getting questions wrong, figure out why and fill in the gaps.  You may want to set aside specific time to just work on weaknesses. That way you can still maintain the schedule your on and not fall behind.  You still have enough time. Focus on being efficient with the time you put in. When you take out your study materials, have a goal in mind. For example: I will be able to explain X; I will understand why I got X incorrect; I will identify why I don't feel confident in X. Then you'll be making real progress and not just checking to-dos. Good luck!"

I just considered the fact that I'm going to encounter topics that I have absolutely no idea how to solve. And sometimes, most of the questions as well. Initially those would freak me out, but like you said, it's really about mentality. This is a mental test of not what you know, but how you discern answers using the tools of what you know. Once I accepted the fact that I'm not going to know everything, every single passage became easier. it's like solving a mystery. With the stress controlled, you pick up details that can help you solve problems. You can comprehend the details in the passages and formulate ways to tackle the problem. Just my 2 cents."
Mcat,3dqnlw,J47max,3,Sat Jul 18 14:50:47 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid there's no way to tell. On the old MCAT I'm told there was an experimental section that was only offered to those who chose to score the exam. Since there's no experimental section on this, there's nothing that differs between those who void and those who don't.  Don't worry -- the fear you're having is common. I had this very same anxiety, and another kid at my testing center was worried as well. I think it's just a normal anxiety people had and unless there's some honest recollection that you hit the wrong button, it wont be an issue."

Mcat,3dqnlw,GrossAnatomist,2,Sat Jul 18 22:22:00 2015 UTC,Well when you went to void it did it a dialog window pop up to double check when you clicked next at the bottom of the page or did it just continue on to the next page?

Mcat,3dp33t,fuckingpremed,3,Sat Jul 18 02:26:22 2015 UTC,"Glucagon and Cortisol are similar, in that they both are released during periods of low energy/high energy needs. For example, you haven't eaten in a while (low blood sugar), gluagon is released and follows GTPase activity to break down fat or glycogen.   Cortisol is related during high stress and low blood sugar, similar to glucagon, and will break down fat.   Insulin increases FA anabolism, since insulin is released when you have high blood glucose levels. Then you don't need to break down fat, but make it.     Glucagon does not induce FA anabolism, but catabolism.    Edit: FA are broken down when you have depleted glycogen. FA are synthesized when you have enough energy/enough glycogen. Also remember the general order of breakdown: Glucose->FA->Amino Acids"
Mcat,3dp33t,rkumar3,0,Sat Jul 18 02:50:14 2015 UTC,Still not sure why glucagon increase fatty acid synthesis. Glucagon and cortisol are very similar in that they increase blood glucose.  Cortisol -> break down fatty acids Insulin -> build fatty acids
Mcat,3dp33t,rkumar3,2,Sat Jul 18 03:09:30 2015 UTC,"Glucagon does not increase FA synthesis. Where did you get that info from?   Edit: if you want to get into the gritty details: glucagon has GTPase activity, cAMP will activate Protein Kinase A. PKA phosphorylates an enzyme called Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase, a key enzyme that is responsible for the beginning of FA anabolism. Phosphorylating Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase inhibits the enzyme, and thus stops FA biosynthesis. PKA will also phosphorylate HSLipases and thus cause the breakdown of  TAG into DAG and finally into MAG. The fatty acids will then become molecules called Acyl-CoA by Acyl-CoA Synthetase. Acyl-CoA will then go into beta-oxidation by being transported from the cytosol to the mitochondria by carnitine in a series of translocase reactions. Then, Acyl-CoA will then be broken into acetyl-CoA by beta-oxidation,which will then go through the TCA and eventually the NADH will then be oxidized and you get 2.5 ATP.  Edit 2: The main thing is, PKA phosphorylates Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase, and you will not have FA Biosynthesis occur."

Mcat,3dp33t,lowlypaste,5,Sat Jul 18 11:25:03 2015 UTC,"OP, this level of detail is absolutely not necessary for the MCAT, in case you were freaked out by the massive explanation  Glucagon --> low glucose level --> gluconegeogenesis and fatty acid release (catabolism). If the question goes into more detail, the information you need to know past this will 100% be in the passage"
Mcat,3dp33t,rkumar3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:54:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, please don't worry about memorizing details of biochemical processes, the MCAT will superficially test you on these concepts and any enzyme name will be provided. I'm sorry to get into the details, but I learned it in my Biochem class and you were asking why glucagon does not increase FA biosynthesis–hopefully it helped!"
Mcat,3dp33t,lowlypaste,0,Sat Jul 18 04:02:41 2015 UTC,So glucagon AND cortisol inhibit fatty acid synthesis?? I'm really confused now.
Mcat,3dp33t,rkumar3,2,Sat Jul 18 04:24:24 2015 UTC,"As others have said, glucagon is released when your blood glucose levels are low. It stimulates gluconeogenesis and fatty acid release because it's trying to bring the nutrient deficit back to homostasis. Fatty acids are released BECAUSE they can be used in several pathways such as acetyl CoA and such. It would make sense that glucagon is breaking down (CATABOLISING) your body's adipocyte storage to get access to the fatty acids.  Insulin is released when your blood glucose is too high. It would make sense that it would try to STORE excess fat in adipocytes. so it stimulates fatty acid ANABOLISM. Glucagon stimulates fatty acid CATABOLISM (Being broken up from adipocyte storage and released for use).   I hope thats clear"
Mcat,3dpxl1,jjohn666,5,Sat Jul 18 08:26:41 2015 UTC,"Doing more full length tests is not going to lower your confidence, even if you take them early. Mental endurance is a key factor in the MCAT and, just like anything else, it takes practice.  You won't know how you feel about sitting stationary and trying to maintain focus for ~7 hours until you actually do it. In my opinion, it's totally worth a ""less than desirable"" score because you will see things during the test that you've not reviewed yet and when you finally do see them you'll say to yourself ""this must be important...cuz I saw it in a passage."""
Mcat,3dpxl1,msixultra,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:24:57 2015 UTC,"It's true that taking full lengths will help you on your endurance. However, if you are unable to answer questions due to a lack of knowledge, you may be thinking a lot less than if you had studied that content beforehand (i.e. you'll see a question that you have no clue about and just skip it instead of thinking it through). In the end, taking full lengths unprepared will just tell you that you don't know some things. It won't examine your ability to do advanced reasoning with those things you don't know because you don't know them in the first place."
Mcat,3dpxl1,xam2y,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:01:18 2015 UTC,"I think you should try and take them ~1x/week, even if you're not done content review. It sucks and it's a bit disheartening, but use it to motivate you to move forward. When you see improvement, it's an even bigger motivator.   I did a diagnostic back in June and I just wrote my first full length last week. My score went up (marginally...like 2 points). It went down/stayed the same for some sections that I knew I hadn't studied, but I've been working my ass off on CARS and it went up a whopping 3 points. I was ecstatic because I was seeing real, tangible improvement.   You need to be used to sitting your butt down at 8am under fluorescent lighting with nothing but a pencil and a few sheets of paper, and conquering the thing. Like u/msixultra said, the score doesn't matter so much as the experience."

Positive thinking will go a LONG way as open up that first passage.  Also, if you feel like your nerves are getting the best of you, go straight to the non-passage questions.

Khan Academy was pretty helpful too"

I ended up having to travel out of town for a family emergency a couple weeks ago and the app definitely helped me get in a lot of questions whenever I had a little time. And I love how you can tag questions (didn't know, sort of knew, etc) so you can just filter out questions when you repeat them."
Mcat,3dmt11,popegope428,2,Sat Jul 18 06:47:17 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing that there's lots of terms that aren't included in the material. When you say this, do you mean there's questions in which NONE of the answers look right, and you don't know the terms? Or are you talking about questions that you think you know the right answer, but are psyched out by terms you don't understand flanking it."
Mcat,3dmt11,MrMajorMajorMajor,2,Sat Jul 18 04:29:57 2015 UTC,"I think almost every question can be gotten down to 50/50. At that point, two unknown terms or two very similar terms makes it extremely difficult to feel confident that you picked the right answer. I don't think there was a question where I felt completely stumped."
Mcat,3dmt11,popegope428,2,Sat Jul 18 06:50:46 2015 UTC,"For me, I felt as though there were several psych/soc questions where I had never seen (what I assume to be) the correct answer before. You could rule out incorrect answers and usually get it down to 2, and make a very good guess just using common sense/logic. There were several like this that I remember and looked up after and am almost certain I got correct. It's by no means impossible, you're just left with that uncertain feeling which is never comforting :/"
Mcat,3dmt11,nutricionado,4,Sat Jul 18 13:59:52 2015 UTC,"Here to disagree with this. Maybe it was all the hype about this section and it being ""totally out of left field,"" but I didn't find it to be bad in any sense of the word.

Scored 83-91% on all the sections on the AAMC sample test and felt like this exam was bizarrely harder.   CARS was the hardest sub-section for me. The passages themselves weren't hard to read but they were longer and the answer choices were much trickier than the Kaplan FLs and the AAMC practice exam.  Psych/Soc was the easiest section for me, in spite of the fact that a handful of the questions were related to terms that showed up in neither the Kaplan or EK study materials. I seem to be in the minority with that opinion but I had 25min left over to check all my marked questions.  My eyes hurt, but the summer has now begun. Time to drink!"

Mcat,3dmt11,erndogku,4,Fri Jul 17 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"As someone who found the C/P to be particularly hard, I was wondering if you could share how you studied and prepared for that."
Mcat,3dmt11,NetiPotYeti,2,Fri Jul 17 20:43:27 2015 UTC,"I used Kaplan but majority of it honestly came from my courses in school. I used the practice AAMC material to pin point content deficit. And I studied whatever I was weak on. I also definitely got lucky with the questions they asked, because there could've been some physics that would've just stumped me. Hope that's helpful and let me know if you have any other questions"
Mcat,3dmt11,erndogku,3,Fri Jul 17 23:11:52 2015 UTC,Agree with you except for the first section.  Maybe it was the nerves but holy hell it felt like I was just staring at heiroglyphics for the first 15-20 minutes.  Once I was able to calm down it was reasonable but I'm glad to hear others saying they struggled with that section.
Mcat,3dmt11,msixultra,3,Fri Jul 17 19:55:30 2015 UTC,Hey guys! how did you feel about orgo/physics on the mcat? a lot? a little? a lottle?
Mcat,3dmt11,ChronicAdviceSeeker,4,Fri Jul 17 20:01:35 2015 UTC,"First of all, every test is different. Like test date. So you'll get something different. Mine had no mechanisms, which I believe is what the AAMC had said from the beginning. The stuff I had was mostly physics 1, with wavelength and frequency."
Mcat,3dmt11,erndogku,3,Fri Jul 17 20:07:08 2015 UTC,I agree.
Mcat,3dmt11,AlanKurt47,7,Fri Jul 17 21:33:05 2015 UTC,"It was weird. A lot of things I had NEVER seen before and I did Kaplan review books cover to cover, Khan Academy, and the AAMC What's on the MCAT review. WTF? One of the guys during the break looks at me and goes ""what are they asking us"" and I had no idea what the answer to that question was. So, I left feeling...neutral... we'll see what happens with the results."
Mcat,3dmt11,Nerd--fish--,3,Fri Jul 17 21:39:29 2015 UTC,Took Kaplan and read EK books. They're shooting in the dark on psych.
Mcat,3dmt11,SicLuceatLux,6,Fri Jul 17 22:21:14 2015 UTC,"I know I still have a little more than a month to take the exam, but from what I'm hearing, I'm glad I took Biochem!"
Mcat,3dmt11,rkumar3,7,Fri Jul 17 21:42:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is your best asset going into the new exam.  Get your psych/soc on point and you will be golden."
Mcat,3dmt11,msixultra,2,Fri Jul 17 21:46:52 2015 UTC,the exam is basically 50% biochem at this point loool
Mcat,3dmt11,throwaway12121244,7,Sat Jul 18 00:01:36 2015 UTC,Did anyone else think CARS was on the easy side? The C/P killed me though.
Mcat,3dmt11,NetiPotYeti,3,Fri Jul 17 19:02:41 2015 UTC,Was it calculation heavy?
Mcat,3dmt11,therealavenger,3,Fri Jul 17 19:08:38 2015 UTC,"Calculations and not knowing one or two extra formulas cost me, but I also didn't have time to study all the content. No overly tricky questions, just a lot of topics covered that weren't my strong suit. So someone else who prepared better may have felt that the C/P was a breeze."
Mcat,3dmt11,NetiPotYeti,4,Fri Jul 17 20:48:19 2015 UTC,Do you have to know the constants?
Mcat,3dmt11,SickboyFL,3,Fri Jul 17 21:26:26 2015 UTC,Easy as in Sample test easy?
Mcat,3dmt11,jwtrae,3,Fri Jul 17 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"I would say almost on par with the sample (for context, I made a 92%), maybe slightly more difficult because the passages were longer. I had 1 or 2 more questions that I was unsure of."
Mcat,3dmt11,NetiPotYeti,3,Fri Jul 17 20:45:53 2015 UTC,"Same here, CARS felt pretty easy to me but I felt like giving up after C/P that was on par with Kaplan/PR full-lengths in my opinion."
Mcat,3dmt11,KoreanDominican,2,Fri Jul 17 19:25:35 2015 UTC,CARS is always my weakest section so when I feel like I actually understand the passages I know they are on the easy side.  Def true today.
Mcat,3dmt11,msixultra,5,Fri Jul 17 19:58:24 2015 UTC,"I felt pretty good about it, sans the psych stuff Kaplan didn't cover. Are we going to get prelim percentiles at some point or did that end in June?"
Mcat,3dmt11,Bananazoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:32:40 2015 UTC,"From my understanding we just get final scores August 18th, no prelims"
Mcat,3dmt11,notNSFWme,6,Sat Jul 18 22:55:32 2015 UTC,Dumb question but tomorrow's test (18th) will be different correct?
Mcat,3dmt11,caboossee,5,Fri Jul 17 20:08:06 2015 UTC,Yes.
Mcat,3dmt11,quamvideri,3,Fri Jul 17 20:09:32 2015 UTC,GOTTA KEEP A PMA AND DON'T LET THAT TEST BE A PMA. DON'T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS
Mcat,3dmt11,ManWithASquareHead,6,Fri Jul 17 23:08:27 2015 UTC,"How I felt: wow. Just wow. The topics covered were pretty easy, compared to some of the stuff I've seen on Kaplan, but man, for some reason, I was always stuck deciding between two answer choices. C/P was a lot of gen chem- I'm kicking myself hard right now since I didn't really study those because I never encountered that much gen chem on Kaplan. I forgot what the gas constant was, wtf. Kicking myself so hard since I'm a chem major. Ugh. Study your physics, know your E&M. Nothing too specific, but understanding of basics will help you immensely. Memorize your formulas as well. I didn't really do that til last night, when I was looking at the Kaplan formula sheet and said, ""Eh, just in case."" They really do shave time off answering some questions.   CARS left me speechless. Think abstract, philosophical passages and politics. Might want to brush up on your SAT vocabulary because I didn't recognize a few of the bigger words and panicked. The passages were definitely longer than the Kaplan ones. Give yourself an hour to an hour and ten mins when you do Kaplan because I usually did that, and even then, with CARS I had about five minutes left. Only had enough time to check the marked questions.   B/B for me was actually quite straight forward. Know your amino acids like nobody's business. The other redditors weren't kidding when they said you need to know the EVERYTHING. I'm not gonna go into specifics cause I'm too paranoid. Just know everything. I thought most of the questions were pretty straight forward, analyze results, etc. Lot more biochem than bio.   Psych threw me a curveball. Some of the terms, I've never seen before. I suspect the AAMC made some of them up because they didn't seem plausible, I dunno. Some of the discreets were really specific >.> understand your sociology terms. Kaplan doesn't give sociology much of a spotlight, but there were a couple of questions regarding sociology. Yeah. That's about it.   How do I feel about the exam? I don't know. I felt like the content was easier but that I had a harder time, if that makes sense. Good luck :D hopefully I will be posting here in the future giving advice instead of asking for it hahaha."
Mcat,3dmt11,missxalice,3,Fri Jul 17 23:39:06 2015 UTC,Do you think the Kaplan quick sheets were sufficient for the C/P?
Mcat,3dmt11,ShakenBake77,5,Sat Jul 18 00:01:06 2015 UTC,"Yes. The quick sheets are enough for C/P, I would highly suggest looking over the ochem quick sheet page about experiments and knowing all of them well.   Quick sheets were not sufficient for B/B and P/S though. On the inside cover of my quick sheets, I drew out all the amino acids by category (acid, base, etc) and their properties. I can't say much about P/S since I studied almost exclusively off Kaplan for P/S and Crash Course videos and I've never encountered some of the terms... I don't even know what would have helped for those :/ sorry. Let me know if you have any other questions, I'd be more than happy to help :)"
Mcat,3dmt11,missxalice,2,Sat Jul 18 00:12:26 2015 UTC,"Thank gosh!!  I'm almost done reviewing all the review sections from the books and I'll take a look at the quick sheet.  Thankfully I took ochem lab not that long ago so I have that down pretty cold.  Yea, I think there will always be a few odd balls for P/S.  I have the pathways and AA down pretty cold (i feel - but i better not jinx myself).  Thanks for all your advice.  I greatly appreciate it.  Time to enjoy yourself and let  the mcat gods work in your favor.  I wish you the best of luck through the app process."
Mcat,3dmt11,ShakenBake77,5,Sat Jul 18 00:32:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words! :) hope you do well too.   If it'll make your life any easier, I learned AA's in the most vulgar way possible. Credits to a forum poster on a USMLE Step exam website. It was so inappropriate that that I remembered everything from sheer shock xD  Non polar amino acids:  Get A Vagina's LIPs To My Penis (Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Proline, Tryptophan, Methionine, Phenylalanine)  Polar uncharged: SomeTimes They Are Good Cunts (Serine, Threonine, Tyrosine, Asparginine, Glutamine)  Basic: Hot Lil Ass: Histidine, Lysine, Arginine)  Acidic: All Good: Aspartic Acid, Glutamic Acid  Sorry if I misspelled any of them. My computer's spell check doesn't recognize any amino acids as words. Heh.  AA's that have alcohols are Serine and Threonine because alcohol is a Serious Treat (note Tyrosine also contains alcohol but it's classified as a phenol).   some pKa tricks (not all).  Arginine has pKa of 12.5 (we'll say 13, I always round up) because ARRRRginine reminds me of pirates and pirates are always bad news so it's unlucky #13 (roughly). Lysine is 10.5 (rounded up to 11), and lysine's letter is K, and K is the 11th letter in the alphabet. Acids are always around 4. Tyrosine sounds like 10, and 10 happens to be the pKa value.   Hope my silly methods help a bit if you forget any of them bahaha. Good luck to you!! :)"

Mcat,3dmt11,RPSavant,6,Sat Jul 18 03:23:53 2015 UTC,Personally I thought Bio was Wayyy harder that the AAMC FL and everything else was exactly what I expected
Mcat,3dmt11,ahamidi,3,Fri Jul 17 19:19:28 2015 UTC,"was it the experimental design that was harder, or just more facts to remember? Also, were there a lot of ochem mechanisms?"
Mcat,3dmt11,HDN2384,5,Fri Jul 17 19:27:24 2015 UTC,"Just finished, I feel like I got destroyed in the physical sciences section and the psyc. Was thinking of voiding, but remembered when everyone told me not to do that, so I didn't."
Mcat,3dmt11,MysteriousManTyping,3,Fri Jul 17 19:34:07 2015 UTC,How was the C/P section....way different than the sample FL? What about Bio?
Mcat,3dmt11,Berliner16,3,Fri Jul 17 19:38:10 2015 UTC,I feel like I just spent too much time on some difficult questions which caused me to panic a little bit. It was definitely the most difficult section in my opinion. A lot of data to interpret and deduce results from.
Mcat,3dmt11,MysteriousManTyping,2,Fri Jul 17 20:09:08 2015 UTC,Any unexpected physics/chemistry topics that appeared on the exam?
Mcat,3dmt11,mcatasu,2,Fri Jul 17 22:04:16 2015 UTC,Everything was pretty comparable
Mcat,3dmt11,erndogku,3,Fri Jul 17 19:48:50 2015 UTC,how was the ochem? Should i be cramming in the mechanisms this afternoon?
Mcat,3dmt11,HDN2384,3,Fri Jul 17 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"No, no mechanisms. I'm pretty sure the MCAT never tests mechanisms. You should however know how certain things react. For example, what reduces a carbonyl and whatnot"
Mcat,3dmt11,erndogku,2,Fri Jul 17 20:08:10 2015 UTC,"No, not a lot of mechanisms at all."
Mcat,3dmt11,MysteriousManTyping,2,Sat Jul 18 00:29:30 2015 UTC,what did you use to prep for the P/C section? do you think TBR's difficulty will help at all?
Mcat,3dmt11,acrossthestarss,2,Sat Jul 18 08:19:14 2015 UTC,How many questions would you say you guessed on in C/P?
Mcat,3dmt11,NetiPotYeti,3,Fri Jul 17 20:49:28 2015 UTC,"I think there were many questions that I reduced down to 2 choices and had to guess. So disappointing. I felt like I really studied hard for this exam, but it looks like a retake for me :("
Mcat,3dmt11,MysteriousManTyping,2,Fri Jul 17 21:06:44 2015 UTC,"T_T me too, I think (a retake). If you want a study buddy for next round hit me up!"
Mcat,3dmt11,NetiPotYeti,2,Fri Jul 17 21:40:13 2015 UTC,I felt bio and psych were about the same but otherwise I agree.
Mcat,3dmt11,popegope428,3,Fri Jul 17 20:05:55 2015 UTC,"You read my mind.  Some of the bio questions were like...what?...I thought this was the MCAT...how could anyone not know the answer to this?  Not belittling anyone who thought there were hard questions, because there definitely were.  But you gotta admit that some of them were basically freebees.  I would give my left arm to redo the C/P section. I had this moment of impending doom where I realized that whether or not I came through or totally f&*ked everything up depended 100% on that moment right then and there.  Really spun me around."
Mcat,3dmt11,msixultra,2,Fri Jul 17 23:33:21 2015 UTC,Good think you only need one arm/hand to click the mouse :)
Mcat,3dmt11,popegope428,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:18:37 2015 UTC,I felt the same way. Definitely the longer passage lengths/convoluted passages made timing a very big issue; AAMC needs to write a consistent test for gods sake
Mcat,3dmt11,tsxboy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:33:47 2015 UTC,Mind sharing how you studied for psych?
Mcat,3dmt11,questionaboutwater,6,Sat Jul 18 13:34:50 2015 UTC,"Here's my experience with today's exam  Chem/Phys: thank god i made sure to spend the day before my exam memorizing amino acid names, abbreviations, structures, etc. thank god. the fact that there were the about as many amino acid questions as physics questions is mindboggling, but i'll take it. also, the physics was not difficult at all! i was really surprised with how simple the two physics question-containing passages were. i mean, you should still review physics but i wouldn't stress over it. Orgo was also not too complicated. Gen Chem and Biochem dominated a majority of the section, but again, it wasn't too bad! You really want to just be super cool, calm, and collected walking into this exam. seriously. i cannot emphasize that enough!!!!   CARS: I got nervous and so i was pretty shaky on the first two passages. thankfully the rest of the passages were not too bad. some of them were wordy, but each passage just kept clicking with me once i let go of my nerves. i actually think CARS was sliiiiightly tougher than the AAMC Sample FL, but very managable regardless. this is an easy section to lose track of time during though so watch your pace! keeping a good pace and staying calm are the two keys to this section, imo. the passages weren't too convoluted tbh  Bio: I got fucked! I really don't know how else to put it. so much biochem. so little anatomy/physiology. so much molecular and cellular biology. jesus.   Psych/Soc: ok...maybe this is just because I've taken a fair amount of sociology and psychology/neuroscience classes in college, but i actually thought this section was really simple. It requires a good amount of interpreting experimental data and such, but idk there weren't really any curveballs imo. hardest part is just memorizing theories and the names of the theorists (there were not that many questions that required this knowledge, but these are also the questions where you literally cannot guess on them so might as well have them down cold for when they do show up)  Final Thoughts: Idk! It seems like everyone felt this exam to be relatively rough in all sorts of ways so, I'm going to just say that I gave it my best shot and I'm really excited to have it over with! I just wanna emphasize the importance of STAYING CALM!!!! the 7 hours will literally fly by, trust me so just be present and calm and confident in all the hard work you've put in leading to this moment!!!! :)   and for those of you who aren't taking the exam tomorrow....study the hell out of biochem and molecular and cellular biology. seriously."

Mcat,3dmt11,nper7,3,Sat Jul 18 00:49:35 2015 UTC,"Mkayyy here's my opinion of the July 17th test: C/P ---Wtf was this. Normally score in the mid 40s for this section and felt like half the questions I was shooting in the dark. Felt flustered especially with the length of questions and the ambiguity.  CARS  ---Comparable to the actual AAMC practice test.. The passages were longer and some were fairly dense.  Bio  --- IMO this was the easiest section. Some questions were just straight gimmes, but there were definitely some hard questions in regards to extrapolating info from data and graphs.  Psych/social --- This is such a douchey section. Thought it was fair for the most part, just annoyed that they felt the need to add this section to a test that already has such a large amount of info.  Overall: Test was difficult and not exactly what I expected. I took 9 FLs that included EKs, Next Steps, TPRs, and the AAMC FL. I truly felt that even if I could study for another week, I couldn't have improved how I did on the P/C section. So not sure.  What are ya'lls thoughts?"
Mcat,3dmt11,mkittymkitty,3,Fri Jul 17 20:26:35 2015 UTC,Could give more detail on why the C/P section was so hard? The practice exam seemed to be somewhat straightforward. Did they confront you with topics you weren't familiar with?
Mcat,3dmt11,mcatasu,3,Fri Jul 17 22:58:28 2015 UTC,"That's the issue. I agree, the practice exam was straightforward; it made me feel confident going into the actual exam. The real exam however had a lot of ambiguous passages that even after reading through, left you feeling like ""What did I just read?""  The issue with the C/P on this test is that I felt like there was no ""real"" way to study for it. You either were lucky to be smart enough to understand it, or you were screwed."
Mcat,3dmt11,mkittymkitty,3,Fri Jul 17 23:14:47 2015 UTC,"Damn it...it feels like there's no way to be really prepared for this exam anyway. Thanks for your response, though."
Mcat,3dmt11,mcatasu,3,Fri Jul 17 23:24:50 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate a bit on what made the C/P passages hard? Was it complicated concepts/diagrams/pathways presented in passage? Is it stuff straight out of research journals? Thanks for the input.
Mcat,3dmt11,basophil666,2,Fri Jul 17 23:38:59 2015 UTC,How was the exam's difficulty compared to EK's FLs? Which EK FL's did you do?
Mcat,3dmt11,fed875,3,Sat Jul 18 06:44:36 2015 UTC,Lots of biochem concepts in C/P Pressed for time in CARS but passages weren't that bad. Biology was really experimentally. Psych/Soc was intense.
Mcat,3dmt11,AlanKurt47,3,Sat Jul 18 00:59:57 2015 UTC,"Looks like it's a pretty good consensus on C/P.. if it was really that hard for all of us, will our percentiles/scores reflect that hopefully?"
Mcat,3dmt11,tsxboy,3,Fri Jul 17 21:07:21 2015 UTC,"But since they are scaled rather than curved, I doubt it'll be as much of a difference as we hope."
Mcat,3dmt11,mkittymkitty,4,Fri Jul 17 22:54:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry, do you mind explaining this for me? The scaled vs curved?"
Mcat,3dmt11,NetiPotYeti,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:12:54 2015 UTC,"Curved- When the organizers normalize the test so that the average of that test would be a 500.  Scaled- Harder questions are worth more and they predetermine what they consider to be a 500, ect. without knowing the averages and such."
Mcat,3dmt11,mkittymkitty,3,Sat Jul 18 00:46:33 2015 UTC,"Killed by C/P, just totally demoralized me. I also found it really difficult to remain seated for the duration of the test despite having simulated testing conditions in practice. The verbal, my absolute strongest, was disastrous. I wasn't able to keep the pace ending the section by punching in the last response with a window pop up telling me I'm out of time. The bio section was extremely dry and I was contemplating ending it there but somehow persevered. Psych was mildly okay. I wouldn't say it tested core concepts as much as your understanding of definitions. Many questions could easily be answered without reading the question stem if you knew your terms."
Mcat,3dmt11,chiasm102,3,Sun Jul 19 01:01:22 2015 UTC,"Just a reminder- you all think you did worse than you actually did. I thought I got crushed in every section and ended up OK, and this is true for most people who take it. Remember that it's graded on a curve and that if you put in the time to learn and study you're better off than most of the people who take the MCAT."
Mcat,3dmt11,MysteriousManTyping,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:19:31 2015 UTC,What about someone like me who knows he missed at least 10 questions in the P/S section and had to guess on 20 more that I narrowed down to 2 answer choices in that same section. I'm assuming I'm screwed right?lol
Mcat,3dmt11,chiasm102,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:50:22 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. I know for a fact that I missed more than a few on chem- perhaps as many as ten and I scored in the 85-100 range. It's more forgiving than you think and stressing about it won't change anything. Just take a deep breath and realize it very likely won't be as bad as you think.
Mcat,3dmt11,mkittymkitty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:38:21 2015 UTC,"well it's not curved. It's ""scaled""."
Mcat,3dmt11,nixos91,4,Sun Jul 19 02:28:34 2015 UTC,"Disclosure - I received an A+ in undergrad biochem and SMP biochem course equivalent to 1st year medical biochem.  C/P: AAMC seriously fucked with us. Very very difficult section. Made the practice aamc fl look like a joke and the half length was definitely easier too. Passages were long and convoluted and the questions were even more difficult to interpret. I studied especially hard for this section and I still had trouble understanding what they wanted. If I had studied for another 2 months I still wouldn't have been able to do much better on this section - with the time constraint and the difficulty in interpreting everything, it was a problem of understanding what they want, not gaps in my own knowledge. I considered voiding after this section. I hope to god that you don't take a similar section because unless you are very very strong at interpreting difficult biochem kinetics and chemistry, you will probably get a lower raw score than your aamc fl - I don't know the extent of curving or scaling that takes place. TPR was easier except TPR #3.  CARS: After taking TPR exams, this was expectedly easier. However, I still believe it was more difficult than the AAMC FL which did not contain any difficult passages. There were 2-3 passages that were verbose and not straightforward. All in all, challenging but not anal penetrating. I expected this level of difficulty from aamc - thank you for doing something right...  Bio: I have a strong background in biochem and biology as stated so this section was probably the best. Comparable to the full length, slightly easier than the half length. Finished with 6 minutes to spare. Lots of experimental passages where you had to understand relationships between variables as you would expect. Discretes were mostly about physiology - nothing out of the ordinary.  P/S: don't panic if you're a future test taker. Study TPR and khan and you will know 90%+ of the terms and you can infer the rest. I only had to guess two answers because I didn't know the terms. One of them was because I had seen it in TPR briefly but forgot. They will be in those resources in some shape or form. More difficult were the experimental passages that sometimes asked for connections that were very hard to ascertain. Graphs were easy but word relationships were difficult - they only mean what they say and any correct answer must be a direct manipulation of them, you can't infer an answer that's not directly connected to that relationship. All in all, harder than aamc fl and half length but only slightly. TPR discretes were harder, experimental passages way easier.  For my own records:  85% on practice aamc  Expecting: C/P: 127 CARS: 128 Bio: 129 P/S: 129"

Mcat,3dmt11,nixos91,2,Sat Jul 18 00:02:48 2015 UTC,blanking out at this point but I would emphasize knowing how most topics in chemistry relate to enzymes and biological molecules. TPR didn't do this well enough at all.

Lots of strange material I'd never seen before, especially with regard to enzymes and their structure. My reaction to half the passages was ""...the fuck is this shit?"" CARS: Passages are a lot longer than on practice tests and I found myself struggling for time, but I've never been a very good reader anyway. Bio: A lot easier than what I expected. Probably the easiest section for me. Lots of focus on gene expression. Psych/Soc: Most people are saying this section was pure hell but I actually thought it was pretty easy. Had to guess on a few questions but it wasn't bad for me. I studied for this section using AAMC's outline (thank GOD I memorized what medicalization is...). Lots of focus on research design."

Mcat,3dmt11,mkittymkitty,2,Sun Jul 19 00:58:16 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand why it was so ridiculous. Like reading the passages, I truly didn't feel like I had a clue what was going on."
Mcat,3dmt11,fanofswords,2,Sun Jul 19 01:29:45 2015 UTC,"For full disclosure: this is the third time I have taken the test. Yes, I know I am an idiot.  P/S: I liked this a little bit more, heavy on biochem, less on physics. However, there were a lot of tricky  biology passages which were hard to understand and interpret.  There were maybe two AA questions that I really struggled with. The physics was much easier and more intuitive than I have ever seen. Really plug in chug. I spent so much time on bio I didn't get to go over and recheck my physics equations. Overall, not that bad, I am thankful for it.  CARS: Note: this is usually my strongest section, for reference I got a 12 on one exam on the old MCAT.  So, what did I think of this CARS? I sat there around passage 7 and thought ""When are we getting to the hard passages?"" It was a very easy CARS section I think (crossing my fingers, hope I do not jinx myself). at around 8-9, the passages were more conceptual and philosophical, Initially I though, oh no, I spoke too soon. But then I realized teh questions were quiet easy. I ended up marking three and had about 15 minutes left.  (I took the break because for me, I really struggle to focus. and I need the break)  Went to bio. The passages were conceptually difficult. and there was mostly molecular biology, not much systems biology. I finished with 18 minutes left and marked about 15 questions, maybe managed to check  10 of them well. A lot of the answers were in the passage, but hard to find at all. I think the biology was quite hard.  PSYCH- ugh. it was the worst. First of all, I was irritated and tired. I kept just wanting to go home and be finished with my exam and psych was so loooong. I wish they had cut psych to 53. Secondly, the passages were dense as hell and very difficult to parse on tired brainTM  and finally a couple of questions hit me out of left field and there was one bio question I should have known but messed up.  Even some theories that I knew, I struggled to apply. I just hated it. I hated  it so much,I  finished with thirty minutes and sincerely contemplated just walking out and leaving them 12 questions blank. I do not think even the obscure stuff I studied really helped much. I marked 9 and I still have no idea.  Good luck everyone!"
Mcat,3dmt11,mcatasu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:58:26 2015 UTC,What was it about amino acids that you struggled with ? How was the biochem being introduced into the C/P section ?  Congratulations on being done!
Mcat,3dmt11,fanofswords,2,Sat Jul 18 16:42:20 2015 UTC,"how they were used. it was not enough to be able to identify aminoacids, I could do that. You had to know how amino acids would be used in secondary and tertiary structure.   and biochem is all the gen chem in the C/P section, while physics is a small stuff."

Mcat,3dmt11,chakdephatte,2,Sat Jul 18 21:50:07 2015 UTC,Did anyone use EK 101 or TPR Verbal to prepare for this test? Were any of these more representative of the actual exam?
Mcat,3dmt11,halpmeplz01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:40:56 2015 UTC,"I think EK by far the best for verbal. It's the best non-AAMC material out there (along with TPR). They also have a good question style that is very similar to aamc's and typically have excellent explanations for the answers. Excellent for getting into the AAMC verbal mindset.  Yes, many passages are more ""fun"" to do because the passages are more interesting usually. However if you're just starting out, and working on technique etc., the fact that the passages are interesting makes practice a million times better.   You should definitely do AAMC verbal after/while practicing with EK 101. The AAMC passages are gold though so I personally wouldn't use them until you have a decent idea of what to do.   That being said, EK 101 was great for me in terms of getting me in the mindset of making ANY verbal passage I read interesting. It helped immensely on the real thing and I got a 10 on the old test. I did 11 of their FL verbal section exams for the old one in addition to all of the old AAMC Fl's. Also used some TPR material but there's just something about sitting down with that EK book that really drilled in the kinds of questions and passage info you need to read for. Just my 2 cents.   One caveat is that the last few tests in that book- I think from after test #10 or 11 they get kinda crazy and frustrating. Maybe that was just me though"
Mcat,3dmt11,vgupsta,2,Sat Jul 18 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"July 18th test taker here, was it just me or was the verbal section ridiculously long and hard.

Cars: I felt like this had longer passages and some of them were out there and super hard.. Struggled with time but managed to finish but probably rushed through a few passages unfortunately.  Bio: This wasn't too bad but a couple of the passages were difficult.. Felt like a ton of cell bio.. Hardly any metabolism.. Lots of amino acids and enzymes.. Like know types of enzymes and exactly how they work. Experimental design was out the ass.. Hard to understand passages..  Psych: well I'm sure it's easy for a psych major. But I struggled because I took one psych class a long time ago and started mixing up terms.. So I'm pretty sure I got butt raped on this section.. Oh well.. I never want to take that again."

I had to guess a lot because the passages were extremely complex and convoluted with lots of data. Expected the question stems to be easy, but I was wrong there too.  Then Cars came. Difficulty wise, it was exactly the same as AAMC FL. Biology had questions that were extremely easy and extremely convoluted, few in between. Psych section was a joke. Every passage was easy and I only made 4 educated guesses, and rest of them I felt confident. I would say it was easier than the AAMC FL. All the terms were found in Kaplan books."

Overall: In terms of practice, AAMC stuff >> everything else. Like 60% of the questions felt like they could have been taken straight from the AAMC Qpacks or Full length. I also took Kaplan, EK, NextStep and TBR passages and felt like they were a lot harder than the AAMC stuff. I would still reccommend them just to have practice with timing and reading dense passages.  As for material review, TBR is my reccomendation (as long as you cut out a good chunk of the ""really in depth"" stuff) especially when it comes to the Biochem stuff. Khan academy mixed with Kaplan was okay for me for Psych but if I could redo it I would focus more on Khan Academy. The way they present everything makes it easier to absorb and understand. Hope yall get the scores you want and good luck to future test takers!"

Mcat,3dohtv,Meowz95,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:12:44 2015 UTC,"Umm not someone to talk (I average like 1-2 wrong per passage) but this is how I go on about it: - First off I'd like to say I like to do the whole ""write a couple words that relate to each paragraph"" strategy, I've honestly adopted is as of 3 weeks ago and it hasn't disappointed me at all That being said, let's said I get 2 wrong on this passage, I go at the passage again and basically skim it and look back at my paragraph summaries, sometimes when I'm really tired, the passage is dense, and I zone out I find that I wrote something irrelevant to the passage. If I notice I did, I look at the questions I go wrong and see if this is the problem. If this was the problem, well, I just gotta read dense stuff more often lol (no easy way around that). Ideally, this shouldn't be the case if you're coming close to the MCAT, and I've found that the more I try this method the less of an issue this becomes (It's a non-issue by now) Now, let's say I did get the passage summaries right, one of the questions I simply interpreted wrong, I look at what the right answer was, I skim the relevant section of the passage, and notice what it was that I missed(personally, I've been noticing I miss the very very small details- so it's been very helpful to know that now I need to really focus on actively reading but still retaining, keep going back to the passage, etc.).   This is basically what I do, and here's why: I found that it worked really well for ME to highlight my mistakes and be able to keep improving by knowing that my biggest flaw in CARS is skimming TOO much. People tell you every day that for CARS all you need to do is _____. Well it was hard for me to seriously take any advice that anyone gave me until I noticed for myself that my flaw(s) are 1,2,3...   Things you could do? Focus on YOUR flaws. If it's a timing issue, keep a log of how much time you spent on each passage and go back to them and see why you spent so much time on them, etc.   That's about all I've got.

It is easy to see the correct answer when it is laid out in front of you.  Instead, try to answer the incorrect ones again without looking at the solutions. This forces you to get into the good habit of looking for textual support and thinking about the questions further (even if it isn't constrained by time limits). This strategy takes more time but you can get a lot more out of the review from it."

Mcat,3dnmva,prince0fpersia94,2,Fri Jul 17 19:08:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's right. When the body is exerting itself, skeletal muscle burns through glucose because it doesn't have enough oxygen to perform the cell cycle so it gets a measly 4 ATP via lactic acid fermentation. This means it needs a lot of glucose, and has a lot of lactic acid, so gluconeogenesis occurs.   This is a concerted process that occurs in the liver, which takes skeletal muscle lactic acid and performs gluconeogenesis. Thus the gluconeogenic enzymes are localized to the liver. Look up the Cori cycle for more information."
Mcat,3dnmva,PresterJohn-117,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:11:25 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Mcat,3dnmva,pookani222,0,Fri Jul 17 23:46:16 2015 UTC,"It allows gluoconeogenesis to be restricted and essentially localized to these organs only. Remember that when glucose is phosphorylated, it cannot leave the cell. The absence of this enzyme in muscle for example ensures that glucose remains trapped inside the cell and used for contraction, instead of wasting this precious resource for gluconeogenesis to provide energy to other cell types."

Mcat,3dn4d9,ksafrost,2,Sat Jul 18 01:42:31 2015 UTC,yep got a 69% on it. got absolutely destroyed on C/P after doing pretty well on that section for FL 4. i read somewhere that doing >60% means that you are in good shape so i wouldn't get too worked up about it. Just use the mistakes to learn how could you tackle those sorts of problems in the future.
Mcat,3dn4d9,bang1294,2,Fri Jul 17 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"just finished taking EK FL 3, got basically wrecked. 51% on C/P. Had 64% and 68% on C/P the first two, respectively. Overall on FL3 was 72%. After reading about other people's experiences with the exam I'm not too disheartened, but I'll be sure to spend these last three weeks trying to improve C/P. But I feel the feels, was aiming for an 80%+ so my confidence is a little meh"
Mcat,3dn4d9,fed875,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:48:26 2015 UTC,"Damn, I feel like getting over 70 percent on the EK FL's is really good, I bet that translates pretty nicely on AAMC material (it seems like people who got over 70 on EK averaged over 80-85 on AAMC, from what I've seen). I've been getting mid 60's on them, and I got low 60's on this one, which just feels shitty. You're in better shape than me, I'm just hoping to break 70 percent, then I will feel a little better for this damned test. Best of luck to you, hopefully C/P isn't as brutal on the actual test."

Mcat,3dnusg,Nerd--fish--,3,Fri Jul 17 21:11:16 2015 UTC,"A pka gives you information about the acidity or basicity of the amino acid - at what point on the pH scale it will deprotonate. Depending on the number of hydrogens (2 on a neutral aa and 3 on a basic/acidic one), the amino acid will be charged at varying pHs. This is important for protein folding, electrophoresis, etc."

Mcat,3dnusg,HicJacetMelilla,2,Sat Jul 18 14:02:53 2015 UTC,"This has to do with what charge a particular amino acid has. The pKa, when compared to the pH of the solution, tells you whether the amino and carboxyl groups are protonated or deprotonated. You should review when they are protonated and when they are deprotonated... i.e. given glutamic acid, what charge does it have at pH = 9?"

So alkene has to have to lowest numbering but it doesnt matter which way you number because it will always be the 3rd carbon. Then comes the halogen, it gets the lowest numbering if you count right to left and ends up being the 3rd carbon. The alkane (methyl R group) is next and that is on the 4th carbon.

From my preparation, I found it was very useful to know biochemistry. From amino acids to enzyme kinetics to pathways, they all will do nothing but help you on the MCAT.  Also to add in some numbers, 25% of the C/P and B/B section have biochemistry content, so it makes up roughly 12.5% of the entire MCAT."

If you have a strong biology/chemistry background, it may not be as important though. Much of the information you've seen in typical cell bio/orgo/gen bio courses - enzymes, proteins, amino acids, DNA are all very important. A biochem course will just go into more detail for all these. If you don't think you'll be able to take one, I would suggest using the Kaplan biochemistry content book.

Mcat,3dktek,MCAT_Throw_Away,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:30:16 2015 UTC,"The first thing you need to know is what a binding (association) constant is. The association constant is the equilibrium constant for the following reaction:  Ligand + Receptor <--> Ligand bound to Receptor K = [Ligand bound to Receptor]/([Ligand][Receptor])  The greater K is, more ligand is bound to the receptor and vice versa.  In your case, the ligand is CPFX and the receptor is BSA.   The trick here is to realize that ka and k0 are BOTH association constants for CPFX binding to BSA. The first sentence of paragraph 2 alerts you to the fact that they are measuring binding constants. The Note under the title for table 1 indicates exactly what k0 is (that it is the association constant when there is an ABSENCE OF the drugs warfarin and ibuprofen). From this, you should be able to infer what ka then represents (it is the association constant in the PRESENCE OF either of those two drugs).   The ratio ka/k0 therefore, is just showing how the association constant changed when ibuprofen or warfarin was added. Since the ratios for both drugs were less than one, it can be concluded that the association constant for BSA and CPFX binding was reduced in the presence of these drugs.   To sum it all up, this was just an overly convoluted way of saying that warfarin and ibuprofen inhibit BSA's ability to bind CPFX."

I also wasn't totally on board with their answer, but my takeaway was that the ultimate goal of the analysts was to identify the short term forces, using the fluctuation measurements as a means by which to do that. That is to say, the measurement of fluctuations is more of an intermediate step to measuring what they're really interested in.  Again, though, not totally invested in the explanation:s"
Mcat,3dkp82,emnh11,2,Fri Jul 17 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  That's definitely a reasonable way to look at.  Whoever wrote this question was a tricky fucker. They introduce the question with ""according to the passage"" which makes you more comfortable selecting an answer that's directly stated in the passage (i.e. choice A).  Then they use the word ""identify"" in the correct answer choice, which makes it relatively unattractive, since they never discussed partisanship as promoting the ability to identify which short-term force was at work.  BUT the fact that the correct answer says, ""helps identify"" makes it just ambiguous enough for it to be the best answer -- the answer that's most consistent with the subject matter of the larger discussion of short-term forces. Sorry to rant lol I've thought about this question way too much.  Still it's useful to see what kinds of language the test writers use in order to trip you up."

But if you're freaking out because you really don't think you've prepared enough chances are you haven't - especially if you haven't taken the practice test yet. Take the AAMC FL ASAP and then see if you're hitting 70% or more in all sections.  If you're below 70% on 3 out of 4 sections then you're unlikely to get a competitive score for MD programs.
Mcat,3dj6vi,nixos91,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:02:19 2015 UTC,take that motha fucking FL. That will let you know where you still need to study.
Mcat,3dj6vi,lolpremedbruh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:52:27 2015 UTC,"Taking mine in the morning, best of luck! Also, I got just above 70% total on the aamc fl, is is a good representation  of the difficulty of the subsequent tests?"
Mcat,3dj6vi,Throwawaymedd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:28:04 2015 UTC,"Don't freak out! People are saying ""take the aamc"" and while i agree with this, I believe its more useful taking the fl a few weeks before the actual test than taking it the day before (taking two 7 hour tests is mentally exhausting and you won't have enough time or the urge to review the topics that you missed in a thorough manner). What I suggest you do is just to briefly review your weakest topics (from the third party FL you've taken, EK, KAPLAN, PRINCETON ect) and relax. You won't get far if you try to cram all the sciences in one or two days. ALSO don't be afraid to fail. If it turns out your score is much lower than you hoped and med schools won't accept it then just take another one. There's nothing wrong with retaking the mcat a second time. You'll have more time to prepare and you can also improve on your weakest areas in your aamc application during your gap year (just call/email the med school and ask what they thought was weak in your application). I hope my pusedo-intelliegent post helps you and good luck on the mcat!"

You take a fluorescent protein and stick it in a cell's membrane, letting it swish around and randomize until the cell looks uniformly fluorescent under a microscope. Then you blast a spot with UV light, essentially destroying the fluorescent part of the protein. The whole cell will glow except for the blank spot you just made. However, as the proteins randomly diffuse along the membrane, some protein that wasnt bleached will migrate into the bleached area and start making it glow again. If you wait long enough, the remaining fluorescent protein will evenly distribute itself again and the blank spot will disappear."

Mcat,3diogw,lelsaway,2,Thu Jul 16 16:12:34 2015 UTC,"If they overlap, they cannot be statistically distinguished. On the old MCAT, you cannot statistically say a person with a 41 would likely score better than a person with a 40 if they took the test again because they're too close to distinguish.   Basically if a score shows 82-97th %ile , it means that if the person took 1000 more tests, they'd fall somewhere in that range, but one test is imperfect and cannot tell where."
Mcat,3diogw,ev1hmr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"right, but if you were to create a confidence band around that percentile it would center around 129 with the lower bound being 128 and the upper bound being 130. But that range doesn't translate anywhere into your actual score report. No one will see a 128 and think this person could have scored as high as a 130.   Its just odd to me that someone can reasonably think they got a 130 and even a 129 with this range even though that has never been the case according to the data accumulated in the spreadsheet."
Mcat,3diogw,PresBill,2,Thu Jul 16 16:54:45 2015 UTC,"Im really surprised so few people have ever taken statistics.   Confidence intervals. Its a prediction. If they made the ranges tighter/smaller, there would be a higher probability that you would fall outside of the range.   In order to provide an answer with 90% confidence, they had to use a 15 point range. If they gave you a 10 point range, the confidence might only be 75%.   Every range is calculated individually, so my range might be 75-90, and yours 76-91, because thats how confidence intervals work.   You say and 80-95% would be more accurate. No it wouldn't be. It would ""rule out"" a 130, but thats not what we are looking at here. We are looking at percentiles. There would be a 90% chance someone fell into 82-97, but if you just ""change"" it to 80-95, that means its no longer a 90% confidence interval. You cant just change confidence intervals so an arbitrary point scale is matched up better."
Mcat,3diogw,PresBill,2,Thu Jul 16 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"I have taken statistics though its been a while, but my point is that you should expect to see some variation if you're given this range. Based on the data in the spreadsheet no one that was given this range has scored a 129 or a 130. In theory a majority of people given this range should receive a 128, but some should definitely receive a 129 (which I would imagine to be 91+ percentile based on AAMC's data). The fact that no one has is what I find odd.   To clarify, what you're saying is 1 in 10 people who receive a prelim range of 82-97 will have a score that's actually outside that range. If that is the case, then there should be a higher frequency of people that receive a score in this range that is not a 128 than there is people who receive a score outside this range. 10% is a pretty decent likelihood. Likely enough for us to see it actually happen multiple times in the data accumulated so far."
Mcat,3diogw,agages55,0,Thu Jul 16 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"First to address your second paragraph. NO GOD NO. Every person has a 10% chance of getting a score outside the range. That is not the same as 10% of people falling outside the range.   A 129 is actually te 93% tile on the real test, so with a range of 82-97, only people with a 93-97.  The midpoint of 82-97 is an 89.5. With confidence intervals it is far far more likely to be close to the middle. So if 82-97% is 90% confidence, then something like 87-93 is probably like 70% confidence, so far more people fall close to the middle then anything else, like a bell curve. That combined with an absurdly small sample count from our little subreddit (only april has the actual percentile data vs score released), theres your answer"

With a very large sample size does that not mean that on average 10% of scores will fall outside the range?
Mcat,3dhun2,KoreanDominican,2,Thu Jul 16 11:56:38 2015 UTC,"I really didn't want to study today and honestly don't think you SHOULD study today if you can afford not to, but I realized I definitely do NOT have the amino acids down, as well as some biochem core topics after taking the AAMC FL, so I'll be reviewing those topics. Other than that, my day will consist of maybe going to the gym, getting snacks for tomorrow, and just trying to relax my mind since I have terrible anxiety. Also, I'm planning on going to bed around 10 so that I can get a full night of sleep."

Mcat,3dhun2,Holysheete,2,Thu Jul 16 13:43:13 2015 UTC,"I started the day at 5:30am by going for a run and reciting different pathways in my head.  Through out the day, I'm just going to take it slow and review my notes of stuff I commonly make mistakes on and going through my Kaplan 1000 flashcards. I know people say that you shouldn't be studying on the last day, but reviewing my notes and flashcards is making me calm. It's not like I've never read these notes. I've been spending the past week reviewing them and they're ingrained in my head at this point, but something about being able to recite my notes before my eyes get to them is very relaxing and encouraging.  I'll be going to the gym later today as well and usually do 5 minute workouts, every 1 hour, consisting of pullups, squats, pushups and leg raises at home.  I'm also going to finish reading Injustice: Gods Amoung Us Volume 2 and 3 and whatever has been released of volume 4 today. If you're at all a DC comic book fan, I highly recommend this series. It's set in an alternative timeline where Superman lost two people very important to him and vows to end any violence on Earth and in the process of doing so, he does things he told himself he would never do. Making enemies with his allies and allies with his enemies. Incredibly dark, but a very interesting read. I get chills, whenever he and whatever is left of the ""Justice League"" push the limits of what we thought they were never capable of.  12/10 rating"

The most I'll do in terms of studying tomorrow will be a quick review of amino acids, maybe a quick scan of all the formulas and 1-2 CARS passages (as weird as it sounds, I'm starting to enjoy them more and more).  Honestly can't wait to write it and be done! One less thing to worry about and then I can finally focus on the biochem course I'm taking right (had 2 reports due this week lol)! Good luck to everyone writing tomorrow and Saturday!"
Mcat,3dhun2,SickboyFL,2,Thu Jul 16 16:27:38 2015 UTC,"May I offer a piece of advice? Don't study at all. Anything you study on that last day will be cramming, which is counterproductive in the MCAT. In fact, the authors will likely test you on things that are most available, but often not correct.   Just take the day off. Be healthy, and trust that getting a full night's rest, eating well, and staying positive will get you a good score."

Mcat,3dg7tl,PresBill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:42:19 2015 UTC,"Cell biology is a very popular topic on the MCAT because it is very complicated and easy to write difficult problems. You are on the hook for a lot of physiology content, true, but it shows up less. If you want a very high score, you'll need to know it all so you're prepared for the few topics they throw at you. If you're low-scoring right now, might be more worth your time to first master the cell cycle, plasmids, gene expression, etc.   Edit: As a side note, it is not ""a waste""  to learn MCAT phys because it reflects the understanding you're expected to have going into medical school."
Mcat,3dg7tl,ev1hmr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:39:19 2015 UTC,"Just from my experience having taken the test, and considering how the new MCAT focuses on experiments now, I would think the raw knowledge of physiology would be less intensive. Experiments tend to lean towards cellular and molecular, and even if they go into physiology, it doesnt require much background knowledge.   A standalone physiology question might get you, but considering that standalone questions themselves are few in comparison to passage question, I would think physiology standalones would be rare in comparison."

Mcat,3dfjy7,fuckingpremed,4,Wed Jul 15 21:43:12 2015 UTC,"So remember that all of these theories are meant to explain social behavior; this should be your basis of comparison. Now, they can be split into two categories: those that occur on the macro/group level, and those that occur on the micro/individual level. This being said...   Social constructionism is a MICRO/MACRO (never been clear on this, someone feel free to correct) theory that states that we collectively create our realities; there is no objective interpretation. John's understanding of the world influences Jane's understanding of the world influences Joe's understanding of the world; experience of ""reality"" is based on our interactions with others.  Symbolic interactionism is a MICRO theory that is very similar to the above. It holds that our interactions with others cause us to create symbolic meaning. We only understand the world through meaning we as individuals ascribe to symbols. In the above, we are acted upon; here, we are doing the acting. We act to create meaning. Conflict theory is another MACRO theory that states we are all competing for limited resources, resulting in a very dynamic society. That's really all you need to know. Functionalism, meanwhile, is also a MACRO theory that is almost in complete contrast to conflict theory, because here we're working together to create a functioning society that serves individual needs. Change occurs rarely because we're aiming for stability.    Let me know if I confused you further haha."
Mcat,3dfjy7,neur_onymous,2,Thu Jul 16 10:37:15 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty good explanation and I'd just like to add on to it a bit!  I always thought of Social constructionism as a MACRO theory and symbolic interactionism as a MICRO theory although they seem to be very similar theories. An example of social constructionism is the meaning that society imbues in certain elements and helps create this ""collective reality."" A prime example is money, it's just a piece of green cotton paper but everyone has agreed that a $5 bill has value. Symbolic interactionism is how we create our own meanings and is on a smaller, more personal level. An example can be a banana. Some might see a banana and be like ""I fucking love bananas"" and some may want to throw up at the sight of bananas. I feel like these theories are so similar though that it's hard to clearly distinguish them aside from the macro or micro level.  Conflict theory and Functionalism are a lot easier to remember, both seem to revolve around harmony. Conflict theory is always working towards disharmony and Functionalism is working towards harmony."

Mcat,3dfjy7,neur_onymous,2,Thu Jul 16 18:13:05 2015 UTC,"One thing: I think you mean symbolic interactionism, which is a bit different from how you described. Symbolic interactionism describes how we act towards aspects of society based on the meaning we've attached to them (or what they symbolize to us). These meanings can change as we interact with others who have a different view of the thing (object/situation/behavior), or as with interact with the thing itself. Like you said, it's criticized for neglecting the big picture of societies.  I hope that helps! I really recommend KA for these theories, they give some great examples that can help with context:)"

Mcat,3dh30d,krustytheclown2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:36:10 2015 UTC,"Things with high osmolarity have high osmotic pressure. The osmotic pressure is the pressure that must be applied to a solution to stop osmosis. The higher the solute concentration, the more water will want to cross the membrane into the solution, and the more pressure you have to apply to keep that from happening.   Hydrostatic pressure is just how hard water is pushing on whatever it's touching. As you fill a water balloon, it's hydrostatic pressure goes up until it bursts.   So, let's talk capillaries. The arteriolar end of the capillary has higher hydrostatic pressure because it's closer to the heart, the pump that generates your blood pressure. It's got the consistency of normal blood at this point, with ""normal"" osmotic pressure. Because hydrostatic pressure is high, water is squeezed through the leaky endothelial membrane and into the interstitium. Note that only some components of blood can leave the capillary, so some stuff gets left behind, increasing the osmolarity and thus osmotic pressure. Also, since you're losing water, the hydrostatic pressure in the capillary drops. As you continue along the capillary toward the venule end, the hydrostatic pressure falls below the osmotic pressure and no longer prevents osmosis of water into the capillary."
Mcat,3dh30d,ev1hmr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:21:55 2015 UTC,Osmotic pressure is dependent on solutes. Say you have a high concentration and a low concentration divided by a layer that only lets water through. Water will move from low concentration to high concentrations to balance out the solute concentrations (low concentration gets more concentrated and high concentration gets more dilute).   With hydrostatic pressure water moves via pressure. The example where this is prevalent is the kidneys. The fact that blood is under high pressure will cause stuff to go through the nephron and make filtrate. So hydrostatic simple is water going from high pressure to low pressure.   Hope this all makes sense.
Mcat,3dh30d,cubes9162,0,Thu Jul 16 06:08:34 2015 UTC,"Short answer is, osmotic (or oncotic) pressure sucks. It pulls water to where it is. Albumin in the blood acts as an osmotic particle.   Hydrostatic pressure is how you most likely think of pressure, in what pushes against the walls of a pipe."

Mcat,3deq5k,basophil666,2,Thu Jul 16 00:08:17 2015 UTC,"For amino acids, you actually do need to know exact structure, down to the number of carbons and types of functional groups. And in relation to that, their hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, polarity, charge in  different pH is critical, because that is key to understanding active site interactions within an enzyme. The kind of amino acid interaction within the enzyme active site they are looking for will almost always be given to you in the passage, so once you know the characteristics I mentioned above, it will be a breeze."

They are:  *Hexokinase (the commitment step for glucose metabolism)  *Phosphofructokinase-1 (the commitment step for glycolysis)  *Pyruvate kinase (last step of glycolysis)  *Pyruvate dehydrogenase (converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA, loss of CO2 makes it irreversible)  *Pyruvate carboxylase + PEPCK (know that making PEP from pyruvate is very expensive for gluconeogenesis)  *Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (undoes what PFK-1 does)  *Glucose-6-phosphatase (know what tissues even express this and why/why not)  *Isocitrate dehydrogenase (irreversible due to loss of CO2)  *Alpha-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (also irreversible due to loss of CO2) Note that this enzyme is regulated exactly the same as PDH."

If you find that happening, I suggest you prioritize the info you have in parenthesis, which are more general and 'important' conceptually (i.e. why things are irreversible, etc.).

People seem to recommend TPR on SDN, but Amazon reviews are saying they're really bad for some reason. I'm probably going to forgo the tutor as I learn best on my own, and the concepts seem pretty straightforward I think.   Medicine has always been something I've always wanted to do – the truth is that when I graduated college my GPA tanked in the last semester due to the loss of a parent, and when I completed my MCAT, I got into a car accident which took some time to recover from :/ I kind of reached a point where I started worrying I would get too old so I went from a measly research assistant to a programmer (web developer) making 6 figures a year.   The thing is I am so specialized in biology, with the post-baccs, and experience in general that I am just more geared towards medicine. I don't think I will ever be a top tier programmer and middle of the road and possibly even lower. This is something that does worry me to some degree as I feel sometimes behind everyone else and IT is very age-centric. That doesn't seem to be the case in medicine where seniority is respected more (in IT it's not).  I have always liked medicine and I know/have a passion for endocrinology (what I'd ideally go into), nutrition, knack, and interest in it (and people telling me all the time I should be a doctor and am in the wrong field)."

You're in your 20's, there are people in their 40's that change careers into or out of medicine. Also, I wouldn't say medicine is more favorable than IT in regards to technology leaving people behind. Many older doctors have had a very hard time adjusting to the computer age, and tech will only keep progressing. It's a large part of the reason scribe jobs even exist."

Is there any basis on time of ""completion"" of application (i.e. when secondaries are finished) versus chances of getting in?"
Mcat,3dgefx,mcatasu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:56:02 2015 UTC,"SUNY Buffalo accepts primaries until mid-November but starts sending out regular admissions acceptances in mid-October. Since you wouldn't be getting your score until October that narrows the available seats that they may be able to offer you, since your secondary wouldn't be complete until then. Even schools that are officially non-rolling do interviews that way. To me it's a gamble for a MD school, but I don't have your ECs."

You might still get a chance to interview, so I think there's hope.  Honestly, I think you're age can only be an advantage with all the experiences under you're belt. You're ""probably"" going to have an easier time during interviews, since you have so much to talk about.  In terms of test prep, I'm currently taking the TPR course (but only because my Uni is paying for it), otherwise, I'd say get you're hands on prep books and buy tons of practice FL's (Next Step, EK etc...). I think the TPR books are pretty good, except their Biochem section isn't that good, so I used the my textbook instead. The go into a lot of detail in their Bio and Psych books, which I find helpful, but if you have a solid background, you might not need all the unnecessary details. I haven't used any other prep company, though."

I feel inevitably screwed and helpless because I feel like nobody knows what will be on the test (not even the test-makers). I'm taking TPR and find the books kind of nice for review and some of the instructors good too, but the psych/soc sucks. My test is september 11th and I only started studying once I started the class at the start of July. I think that I know I'm going to have to retake the test but I'm already a year behind where I should be and I just don't want to be even more behind. My mom is encouraging me to take it later or just cancel it and take it next year. It's really rough. I'm also taking a statistics class at the community college, so that's another 3 hours out of my day +hw.  I'm currently doing some of your article selections (and other articles that I've chosen). I'm still learning material for everything and trying to improve my CARS skills. That is technique and the rest is memorization in a way, so I am dedicated to practicing.

There's going to be 2 AAMC FLs, updated books, more info/tips from companies, etc. Only take the test if: 1) You're ready 2) You can afford to void the exam and take it again (only 3 times a year). Registration for the 2016 MCAT dates will open in October 2015 for tests in January 2016. You can spend this summer studying, spend winter break studying, and then take it January 2016."

Everyone else has taken it (it seems) and if I'm going to take it next year, I would be taking it after I graduate so that I could study.

August 10th is the last day to reschedule the exam, and I don't want to take the exam if I've only taken like 3-4 practice tests. I'm also assuming I won't do great on the first practice test I take (technically second, but I don't count the diagnostic one), and I promised myself at the beginning of this I wouldn't take the exam until my practice scores are reflective of the score I want to get (aiming for a 520). So yeah. It sucks. Maybe I shouldn't have went the flashcard route idk but it's too late to turn back at this point.

If you're reading the questions then the passage, maybe try reading the passages, then the questions.   Also try to figure out what types of questions are the most difficult for you. Once you know that, you'll know where to focus the most energy. I had the hardest time with strength/weaken questions and every time I saw one of those words in the question stem I perked up and made sure to spend a little extra time with the question."

Mcat,3dfyw7,grammarnazivigilante,2,Thu Jul 16 22:38:55 2015 UTC,"My test is tomorrow so I'm not sure if I'm the best source yet, but I've greatly improved my CARS score over the past couple of weeks (went from scoring in the 8 range on old tests to an 89% on the AAMC FL) by changing a few habits. Instead of reading the questions first, I take my time and read the whole passage. While reading, I make 2 things my priority: assessing the author's tone on the topic at hand and the overall main idea of the passage. I'm an extremely slow reader and it takes me about 3-3.5 minutes at the least to just read the passage, but when I try to focus on the main idea and how the author feels about the topic, I tend to answer the questions much more quickly and efficiently. Also, reading the passage with as much focus as possible makes you go back to the passage less while answering questions, which saves a lot of time. I also have started utilizing the highlight tool a lot more than I had used it in the past, and that helps me focus better. All of these small changes have led to a significant improvement in my performance on CARS. They might not work for everyone, but they work for me. Hope this helps a little!   Edit: Oh, and I consistently scored in the 8 range no matter how much I practiced, so I really believe the above changes helped me a lot."

Mcat,3dfyw7,bodacious_sausage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:38:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.  I force myself to read the passage as though the author is a lying asshole and I have to prove him/her wrong. I also quickly see when/where the passage is from at the bottom.  By starting with negative affect, you're much more likely to nit-pick the arguments made by the author which is useful for answering the questions."
Mcat,3dfyw7,bodacious_sausage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:19:00 2015 UTC,LOL lying asshole. I read the passage as though a friend is telling me something and I have to pay attention and at least feign interest so I don't upset them. But I like your approach better.
Mcat,3dfyw7,RPSavant,2,Thu Jul 16 20:22:27 2015 UTC,"When you're reading the passage after every paragraph jot down a quick note about what the paragraph was about. Then at the end of the passage write down a sentence that encompasses the main idea of the passage. ACTUALLY WRITE THIS SHIT DOWN. Then as you progress with your practice you won't have to write down the little paragraph notes (you'll just do it instinctively in your head) but still if you're struggling (even if you're not) write down the main idea.  And lastly I saw some people say to read the questions first. I would HIGHLY recommend against doing this. Read the passage in its entirety once and then try and do the questions without looking back if you can (this is where the main idea sentence will be a lot of help).  Another very important thing is between every passage take like 30 seconds close your eyes take deep breaths and CLEAR the previous passage from your mind. Then when you start reading the next passage stay in that passage and as you read (during your practices) make sure you're following the passage and not losing your train of thought (this is where the jot notes help). This was the single biggest thing that helped me and if you can ""stay in the passage"" and you read it it is infinitely easier to only read the passage once and then answer the questions.  I wrote the old mcat and scored a 10 on VR then on the new one 85-100 on my preliminary and 97% on the FL."

Mcat,3dfl3p,kimythetimetraveler,2,Wed Jul 15 21:51:48 2015 UTC,"The whole point of proofreading is so that you don't accumulate unwanted mutations of any sort. If you have a mutation in your genome (ie. introduced through DNA replication), then a mutated gene will go on to produce an unimaginable number of defected proteins which could have a serious effect on the cell and/or organism.  If you have a mutation in your transcript due to transcription then it is not that big of a deal. There will be a relatively small number of proteins that are translated from this mutated transcript and thus it won't really affect the cell much because it can easily produce more mRNA transcripts that are free of errors."

For CARS, I just take out the topic heading so it's only question type (usually they'll tell you what type it is!)

They like the effects of the drug, and so, their behavior is likely to change as they are more likely to self-administer the drug again It's negative because the reinforcer's effect is to take something bad away -- the passage states: ""to relieve boredom or discomfort."" Whenever we are taking something away, it is ""negative."" When we take something bad away, it is ""negative reinforcement.""

Mcat,3dcd96,lelsaway,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:18:58 2015 UTC,"Mostly depends on what your GPA and ECs/LORs are like. Google the AAMC gpa mcat grid and you can find the percentages of acceptances for different scores across demographics.  In the past, a 30-32 (77-88%) has been considered a good score. Not great. 31 is the national average for accepted students, so as long as you have no glaring flags on the rest of your app, and a decent 3.6+ GPA, then you have a chance at some IIs.   If you score a 33-35 (89-95%), then you are getting into a pretty good score range. You're score is above the school average for 20-30 low/mid tier schools, and combined with a good ""everything else"" you can aim for better schools.   35+ is a great score. Now you are at or above median for almost every great mid tier school, and with something else standing out, you can have a chance at some top tiers.  so I'd say getting a 510-512 is good. 513-515 is very good. and 516 is exceptional.  Now, what is weird to think about, is ""good"" is considered 80%+... I mean, if we weren't talking about med school admissions, being better than 799 people in a group of 1000 is pretty awesome.  Edit: This is for MD. Also not sure why someone downvoted"
Mcat,3dcd96,OuagaNoma,2,Wed Jul 15 04:18:33 2015 UTC,*31 is the national average for matriculants  Not test takers overall

Obviously it's shorter so you don't get the endurance component, but I felt like the question styles were very similar. And my final percentiles on the real thing were closer to the official guide than to the AAMC FL. But I also took the official guide closer to test day after I had honed in on biochem."

Mcat,3dbr2t,Balopathic45,3,Wed Jul 15 01:09:29 2015 UTC,That understanding is probably good enough. Technically it's the probability that your null hypothesis is true.

Mcat,3dax19,mcattaker021,3,Tue Jul 14 21:22:35 2015 UTC,"Hi mcattaker021 -   I scored in the 70%s on all the sections on the AAMC FL a week before my exam in May. I took Kaplan and the highest I got on their practice tests was a 502 (always in the 498-502 range for 5 FLs).   That being said, I ended up with a 517 (96%!!), so I wouldn't worry too much about your specific scores on practices. Practice exams aren't very indicative. As long as you review them well after and are studying content well. The week leading up to the test is extremely important. Focus on content areas that you struggle with and memorizing important things (like amino acids, psych vocab and physics equations).   Good luck!!"

Mcat,3dax19,agages55,2,Tue Jul 14 21:31:16 2015 UTC,The only FL score that is worth a shit is the AAMC FL even though it doesn't give you an actual score. That test most resembles the actual test. If you can boost your C/P and P/S slightly you'll be awesome.

Mcat,3dbbno,RebelRambo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:09:53 2015 UTC,"I took the test recently, and what I found most helpful, with about a month left, was reviewing the questions which I got incorrect to see what types of mistakes were made.   For example, was it a careless mistake in which I miscalculated, didn't read the passage carefully enough, etc.? Or was it conceptual? I was most worried about the latter, because going into the test I didn't want any surprises. When doing about 1-2 practice FLs a week, this strategy was super helpful."

Go review every question you missed. If you missed a question because you clicked the wrong thing, that's good to know. If you missed the answer because you forgot the content, that's very good to know. Write down the topics you got questions wrong in and then study around those topics. When I say around, I don't mean rememorizing the heart valves because you got them mixed up. I mean while you're in the shower tell yourself the story how blood flows from the VC to right atrium through tricuspid valve into right ventricle... and so on.

I did the TPR FL's 1-5 though, and I'd agree that the Bio passages are difficult, but the physics passages are causing me more trouble I'd say.  Also, try doing the AAMC bio passages, those require more critical thinking and somewhat less content recall, and it might help to eliminate wrong answer choices instead of looking  for the right one, if that makes sense?! I realized that I often get caught up trying to find the right answer, even though it's easier to just eliminate answer choices that are somewhat flawed...since you don't even have time to fully comprehend the passage, eliminating answers seems easier :D..."

However, information about the theories is typically presented, while Kaplan wants you to be able to recite the tenets of each even if you really don't need to know them.  One thing ExamKrackers does leave out is world development theory (world systems theory).  Sources:  1) Friend took the MCAT, read Kaplan and ExamKrackers and said Kaplan was way off.  2) My personal experience based on taking the official practice AAMC questions, Kaplan exams and the Kahn academy practice questions.

Km decreases because of the Law of Mass Action/Le Chatelier- by binding the enzyme substrate complex, you're effectively lowering the concentration of ""products"" causing the affinity of the enzyme for its ligand to increase."

Mcat,3d9xp1,bobbai,5,Tue Jul 14 17:22:40 2015 UTC,I think you're allowed anything that you wear. So camelbak and catheter should be okay
Mcat,3d9xp1,RohanThakur24,2,Wed Jul 15 01:13:23 2015 UTC,You will have lockers to store your stuff in that you can go back to at any point. But you'll take the test in a different room in a sort of cubicle and you won't be allowed to bring a water bottle in there.

Mcat,3d9xp1,PresBill,2,Tue Jul 14 18:45:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. Its now 7.5 hours, plus you show up an hour early so a nice long break is necessary. No notes between sections"

Mcat,3d9upp,agages55,2,Tue Jul 14 17:20:34 2015 UTC,"^ this. Also, you can logic this out by considering Zeff (effective nuclear charge). Cations have lost electrons and still have the same # protons, which increases the effectiveness of the nuclear charge thus pulling the electrons closer (smaller radii). Anions have gained electrons and still have the same # of protons, which decreases the effectiveness of the nuclear charge and allows radius to increase."
Mcat,3d9upp,caffieneislife,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:39:52 2015 UTC,"cations decrease exponentially in size because the size of a proton is so much bigger than an electron coupled with the effective nuclear charge increase, i believe. anions increase in size. my understanding is that even if the principle energy levels differs, the cation will always be smaller. correct me if im wrong brahs. testing in 3 days so hopefully im right"
Mcat,3d9ewp,raiserstyle,2,Tue Jul 14 15:11:00 2015 UTC,Don't give up! I am taking the exam on Saturday and I feel like I am in the same boat. Im in the same score range and feel like theres not much else to do besides stay calm and do my best. I am spending these last few days solely on AAMC material because it seems like that is the most accurate representation of the score you will actually receive. As a side note I am personally scoring much higher on AAMC material than any other testing companies FL. GOOD LUCK!

I cracked above 500 once on the Kaplan FL's (not sure how they are compared to TPR) and got an 82(76/83/86/83) on the AAMC FL. Just go over the AAMC FL once or twice, review any major concepts you may be weak on and remain calm and think you can make the test your bitch. I'm taking it this Friday."
Mcat,3d9ewp,cbssj12,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:15:46 2015 UTC,"Don't panic just stay calm and go through those tests to see where your weak spots are and try to improve on them. Those are the best uses for TPR full length tests, cause in my opinion they are not a good representation of the MCAT or the score you will receive. The best representation would be the AAMC full length. Do that see how you score, and if you do well, then take the test, if not then reschedule.  Or you can always take the test and void it if you don't feel confident. By rescheduling this late, your not going to get your money back, so maybe do the test to get a feel for it if you are planning to write at a later time. Just my two cents. Goodluck!"

For what it’s worth, I thought the AAMC FL was pretty accurate and as you can see was a good indication of my actual score. At this point you paid for the test so I would take it and if you feel real horrible then void (e.g. guessed on 3 passages). Just stay confident."

The tests aren't of equal difficulty and some of them have passages that may not necessarily apply to the new test (for example, pure physics and chemistry ones that don't relate to biological systems). I was honestly considering voiding my score on Friday, but coming here and seeing the words of encouragement from everyone else has helped a bit. Maybe someone might come later and be willing to share their TPR/Kaplan FL scores vs what they got on the April/June test. You got this!"
Mcat,3d9ewp,aquatictiger2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:57:16 2015 UTC,"Yea those tests are tough no joke. I started the TPR 3 FL and after the second CARS passage I closed my exam.

Read all the Examkrackers, then take lots of practice tests and passages. Make sure to do the official AAMC practice test and online review questions. The Kahn academy also has great passages. One thing I faulted  on when i first took the MCAT was memorizing too much information when I really just needed to practice more passages.  Best of luck, mate."

Mcat,3d7lhx,Fapacwl,2,Tue Jul 14 03:31:06 2015 UTC,"It's most definitely too specific. Something I've noticed from practice FLs and EK's content review package is that if there's some specific detail you need to know to answer the question, the passage will most likely have it. You don't need to waste your time, remembering every intricate detail. Obviously it helps to know, so you can understand the passage a lot better, but you don't need to get caught up in it. If you're short on time to study, I'd rather study 100% of all the core concepts and know the general idea of all of those topics than know 20% of the core concepts, but be an expert in those topics."

If the initial substrate concentration is relatively small compared to Km, then tripling the [S] might increase it by a large amount (but smaller than 3 times). If [S] is extremely large compared to Km, then it might barely increase the reaction rate because the reaction rate is probably close to Vmax."

What you might be instead is very very anxious, to the point that it is becoming counterproductive to your preparation. Success is the result of learning from many failures, and conversely ""insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results"". Instead of pointing at your IQ as the culprit, maybe you need to change up the way you're going about handling these passages."

Mcat,3d7lum,rkumar3,2,Tue Jul 14 19:25:32 2015 UTC,"Hey man, studying for the MCAT takes trial and error. For 99.99% of the population, scoring >80th % requires seriously hard dedication and many people come to road blocks similar to yours.  I think one thinks you need to work out is your method of study and review. I liked reading a section of a chapter, say Physics Kinetamics. I'd read and highlight, then re read and create an outline in my notebook. Very basic notes including equations and principles. I eliminated all the fluff. Reading first helped prime me for the material and refresh what I've learned before. Note taking helped me consolidate info I thought was absolutely necessary to review at some later date. It turns out to be a lot less info than you think.  After this, I do some discretes and a few passages on the material I covered. I read every solution, whether I got it right or wrong.   I repeat this as I continue through the book.   Once ive done this for all material ~ month or so ~ I spend a week going through all the notebooks and making notecards for high yield stuff, refreshing my memory of all concepts, and doing practice problems for the material each day. After a week of this I started doing 20 passages a day, usually 4 in each subject, and reviewing all answers. Throw in practice exams and after 4 weeks you may fee ready.  This was my schedule and my plan. What is yours? How are you reviewing and studying? Why do you think it's not comit through? You need to find out what works for you and then you can progress, and at the end you will b a better student for it."

Just takes way to long and this is my first time writing so I have no idea what to expect. Oh and might I add I'm doing this solo dolo :P. I'm just going to consider this a learning experience.

Mcat,3d7lum,SShirodkarMD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:23:25 2015 UTC,"Hey, friend. Hang in there and don't beat yourself up.   A couple of things I'd love to point out. First, is that the Next Step diagnostic and other full length exams are absolutely ridiculous. Like all test companies, they are motivated to give you a low percentile. Furthermore, the NS exams (again, like all test companies) aren't vetted for being good questions. I personally found questions on there for which I believed the answer, even after extensive review, to be incorrect. Unlike the AAMC, they didn't design those percentiles after evaluating how thousands and thousands of test takers did on them. They may be a useful tool for practice, but they are absolutely not representative. I got 39th percentile on my Bio according to NS. On the AAMC test I had taken before that? 87%. NS doesn't correlate with AAMC.  The second thing I want to talk to you about is your comprehension of the passages. The first thing you need to realize on this subject is that most people who are going to succeed on the test don't necessarily understand what's going on in the experiments. The trick to MCAT passages isn't about truly getting it, so much as it is being able to recognize the relevant pieces. I can honestly say to you that on the MCAT passages on my exam, I couldn't have explained what was going on in any of them. My recommendation for you is to practice AAMC Bio (the real exam and the 30 question pack) and practice OUTLINING the passage. On the old MCAT, I would have said this was a waste of time, but breaking each passage into its basics really helped me elucidate the general procedure of each experiment and didn't require that I be able to really understand it in the new MCAT. Once you stop getting caught up on the anxiety during reading the passage, you will improve.   This may be super bizarre, but because I'd rather offer to help than to not, I'd be happy to set up a skype meeting with you and help you practice reading a passage and extract the info. Maybe showing you how to do this would help."
Mcat,3d7fwj,ryanstevens124145,0,Tue Jul 14 02:45:40 2015 UTC,"It took me a while to understand this, but I think I might be able to help you.  So, every charge creates an electric field, and at different points around the electric field, the electric potential (or voltage) has a different value. If you look at the equation for electric potential, you'll see that it is inversely proportional to the radius, or distance from your point charge, so the farther away you move from the point charge, the smaller your electric potential will be.  So, when you move from point S to point T, your potential is getting bigger, meaning that you are closer to the charge that is responsible for the electric field. If you think about your charge being positive, that would mean your electric field is starting at point T (higher voltage) and is moving towards point S, which is farther away, which is why the voltage at this point is smaller.   Does that make sense? :)"
Mcat,3d7fwj,mcatasu,0,Tue Jul 14 02:54:34 2015 UTC,"Good question! There are a few things to understand here.   One: Potential is kind of like potential energy in that each point in space has a value, but it doesn't really matter what that value is. What really matters are differences between points.   Two: Voltage is a difference in potential. A 12V battery has a difference of 12V in potential between its terminals, whether one is 0 and the other is 12 or one is 1000 and the other is 1012.  Three: Field Lines point from (relatively) positive, high potential points to (relatively) negative, low potential points."
Mcat,3d7fwj,ev1hmr,0,Tue Jul 14 03:03:47 2015 UTC,"Think of it as a river.  Water flows from high potential to low potential; the same as electric field lines.  Knowing this you can determine that the electric field lines must point from 200V to 100V or in terms of your question T to S.  This analogy can be transferred to electric potential and voltage as well.  Think about voltage as how far up the river you are, so at a voltage of zero you would be at the end of the river with no potential energy.  Now if you were to move up the river your voltage would be going up as well as your potential energy.  This is how I make sense of it but a word of caution is make sure you have your charges in order like for example a negative charge would LOSE potential energy as it goes up in 'voltage'."
Mcat,3d7ec2,PersuasivePersian,2,Tue Jul 14 02:33:18 2015 UTC,the hydroxyl group present on compound 2 (the only difference between the two molecules) makes the molecule more polar.
Mcat,3d7ec2,philosofossil13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:19:11 2015 UTC,"yeah but thats why i thought the hydroxyl group made it less polar, because it was also electron withdrawing like the sulfur, so theyre both in like a tug of war and there isnt much polarity. compared to the one with the methyl the sulfur is easily electron withdrawing with nothing fighting back"
Mcat,3d7ec2,Scorwegian,2,Tue Jul 14 03:22:59 2015 UTC,"They're so far apart on the molecule that the fact they have opposite effects doesn't really come into play, especially since the two benzene rings located between the far ends of the molecule are very stable. You can just think of these molecules in terms of polarity of a hydroxyl group versus polarity of a methyl group and hydroxyl is the clear winner in polarity - other than those two groups the two molecules are the same, and so hydroxyl polarity takes precedence and adheres to the mobile polar phase much more easily."

Mcat,3d7ec2,buzzfeed_journalist,2,Tue Jul 14 19:37:44 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's pretty much been stated, but I like to think of these questions in terms of the local electronic effects. The 3 F's obviously cause a tug on the electrons toward their end of the molecule, but we're not assessing overall dipole moments on a molecule that large (remember induction effect falls fairly quickly over multiple bonds) so that the other electronegative components don't significantly detract from the new alcohol group, whereas the new alcohol will undergo more polar behavior in its local environment (i.e. solvent molecules) compared to the original methyl group that was their. Based on this it's fair to say Compound 2 is the more polar molecule."

With that being said, on the sample, there was no complex math (i.e. they don't rearrange the formula in some crazy way). Typically just plug the numbers in the formula and calculate it (the only ""tricky"" part may be converting units)"

Mcat,3d6z9a,TheMagicianDolph,2,Tue Jul 14 01:55:41 2015 UTC,"I think your better off understanding HOW the equations work (what the symbols mean), their relationship to one another as opposed to memorizing point blank 100 equations is a waste of time. This comes with simply doing problems. IMO."
Mcat,3d6z9a,TheMagicianDolph,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:03:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. On my flashcards, I'll have ""What is X formula"" and then the next question will be a problem involving the formula.

Mcat,3d6r67,agages55,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:28:49 2015 UTC,"I believe it is because Tyrosine's R group is an phenol. This has an OH at the end.  When the OH is deprotonated at say a pH of 13, the R group will have an O-. When the OH is protonated at say a pH of 7, the R group will be OH, rendering the overall charge as neutral.  Notice that this applies for the amino and carboxyl groups that alternate between NH2 and NH3+ and COOH and COO- forms.  It's a similar story for cysteine which has an SH R group.  this is just my understanding - please correct me if I'm wide of the mark. :X"
Mcat,3d6r67,nixos91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:04:53 2015 UTC,"At physiological pH ~7.4, Tyrosine will have its carboxy group (pKa ~2) deprotonated. So this means it'll have a neutral charge. Cys will also be neutral at physiological pH for the same reason. I think that's why they're considered uncharged. In contrast, something like Glutamic acid will have a negative charge at physiological pH because both its carboxy group and R group (pKa ~3.9) will be deprotonated at physiological pH. This is how I think of it. Someone let me know if I'm wrong please."

Mcat,3d6po9,longhorn_93,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:17:05 2015 UTC,"Ya the 30 minute exams are pretty difficult, in the sense that you have to be able to really understand the experiment in the passage to answer the questions. It's really good practice because the real exam is going to be more like EK (not as difficult) and less like every other prep company which just test your memory.  I'm saving the 30 minute exams for the end of my studying because by the time i finish a lecture my brain is too burnt out to carry out the higher level thinking required for answering the in class exam questions."
Mcat,3d6po9,lowlypaste,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:59:22 2015 UTC,that might be a good idea to do (save the exams for the end). but sometimes i feel that the exams are unnecessarily hard in that they contain so much data. it's almost as if reading the lecture and working the in lecture problems are kind of pointless because the exams are pretty much interpreting several graphs or models to answer questions... and in a way i feel as if i'm just wasting my time.  i glanced at a friends princeton workbook review and the passages are much less oriented to analyzing data and more about connecting knowledge with the experiment or study... i'm thinking of buying a tpr workbook and supplementing that with the EK.
Mcat,3d6po9,lowlypaste,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:58:27 2015 UTC,"Ya the MCAT is going to be heavily involved with interpreting experimental designs, graphs, models etc, so it's not a waste of time it's the type of practice you need... The new MCAT is really heavy on journal-style research type questions from experiments.   The reason you do content review is to answer the few stand alone questions. If you didn't want to score in the 85th + percentile, you could have done really light content review"

More intensive review.  Wednesday, will be mostly lighter review, like casually going over my notes and pretending I'm teaching AAMC how to learn Bio, physics, chem, and psychology. I'll also be doing a few CARS passages.  Thursday will mostly be exercise, chilling and playing soccer all while listening to the chillest, most indie EDM out there. All stuff that will make me feel like a god and good about myself. Might watch Justice Leagues Gods and Monsters and finish Injustice Volume 2. I'll be keeping track of my diet. I'm currently on a lean gains diet, so lots of protein, minimal carbs and moderate fats. Specifics? Alrighty :D 180g of protein, 80g of fat, <30g of carbs. I'll be sleeping at around 10:30pm.  On test day, I'll be waking up at my usual time of 5:30am and going for a 30 minute run. I'll eat a decent sized breakfast of 4 egg whites, 1 full egg, 2 breakfast sausages and 1 banana.

IMO (but also somewhat proven by science) people should stick to easily digestible carbs and protein, the simpler the better.

I will say that EK science sections seem to resemble the AAMC material more closely because they are experimental heavy. The TPR Demo and FL 1 exams had way too many general background passages as opposed to experimental protocol passages, so I would say EK is a bit closer in format (but not necessarily in difficulty).  What I have found to be essential is to not get hung up on the details of experimental passages. If you aren't understanding it within a few seconds of reading it, move on.

Mcat,3d59nm,agages55,2,Mon Jul 13 17:07:19 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure what your question is but:  Phosphorylation adds a phosphate group. A phosphorylase adds an inorganic phosphate group from the environment. A kinase adds a phosphate group from nucleotides (for example. ATP -> ADP as you mentioned).  Dephosphorylation removes a phosphate group and the enzyme that does this is called a phosphatase.
Mcat,3d59nm,KawaiiHitler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:21:44 2015 UTC,so a phosphatase is just the enzyme in a dephophoryaltion reaction?
Mcat,3d59nm,KawaiiHitler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:30:40 2015 UTC,and in this reaction ADP->ATP is made?
Mcat,3d59nm,KawaiiHitler,2,Mon Jul 13 17:33:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. Dephosphorylation is a reaction using a phosphatase enzyme.   I think an ADP being converted in ATP is possible but not always the case. I know that GTP can be dephosphorylated into GDP while ADP in phosphorylated into ATP but I'm not sure if the phosphate group turns into inorganic phosphate first.   The dephosphorylation of ATP into ADP, for example, results in an inorganic phosphate and does not result in another ADP being converted to ATP"
Mcat,3d59nm,shakenbake666,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:16:06 2015 UTC,"The last one was kind of a bad example. In gluconeogenesis, Frutose-1,6-biphosphatase converted F-1,6-BP into F-1-P but the phosphate is converted into Pi and ATP is not made in the process."
Mcat,3d59nm,Scorwegian,2,Mon Jul 13 18:21:45 2015 UTC,"ATP isn't made from dephosphorylation. In certain cases ATP may be generated through substrate level phosphorylation, but this occurs through the actions of a kinase (ex. pyruvate kinase in glycolysis). Phosphatase enzymes simply catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphate group to form a free phosphate ion."
Mcat,3d59nm,rkumar3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"Another way to think of this in general is that phosphorylation can be done by:  phosphorylase (which adds an inorganic phosphate to an acceptor)  kinase (a phosphotransferase that and usually utililizes a phosphate group from ATP, resulting in a phosphorylated substrate and an ADP)  Dephosphorylation on the other hand is done by phosphatase and is usually used to cleave off a phosphate group from a molecule without necessarily transfering the phosphate to another molecule. The phosphatase is often used to reverse the effects of a kinase after the molecule that was phosphorylated  by a kinase has served its function."

Here are a few rules:  Multiplication: 1.5e10 * 3e25   MULTIPLY the numbers before the tenth power first:  1.5*3=4.5  Then ADD the powers together:  10+25=35  Therefore, the answer is 4.5e35  3.2e-12 * 2.0e-14  3.2*2=6.4  -12+(-14)=-26  Therefore the answer is 6.4e-26  Division: 3.0e17 ÷ 2.0e19  DIVIDE the numbers before the tenth power  3*÷2=1.5  Then SUBTRACT the powers:  17-19=-2  Therefore the answer is: 1.5e-2.  3.0e-20 ÷ 2e-35  3÷2=1.5  -20-(-35)=15  Therefore the answer is 1.5e15  Substraction/Addition:  Substraction and addition is easy, you're keeping the powers the same, and only adding/subtracting the numbers before the powers.  3.2e12 - 2e12= 1.2e12  3.2e12 + 2e12= 5.2e12  Remember with addition and substraction, the powers MUST equal:  3.2e12 + 3.33e11  3.2e12 + 0.333e12= 3.533e12  5.2e-12 - 3.0e-11  5.2e-12 - 30e-12= -24.8e-12= 2.48e-11  When it comes to scientific notation, going to the LEFT means you ADD (+1) to the power  When going to the RIGHT means you SUBTRACT (-1) to the power  As with anything PRACTICE, you don't want to get a bad score because you couldn't do math."

Mcat,3d3srf,neur_onymous,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:49:06 2015 UTC,I also found both EK and TBR's math chapters to be helpful.
Mcat,3d3srf,GoBlueMichigan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:52:26 2015 UTC,I did a quick google search. Some of the info is super easy but can't hurt to review it again!  http://www.premed411.com/pdfs/math.pdf   and there is a set of videos too. Here's the one on pH and pKa and you can look through the related videos for more.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDoFKQmOZbk  Good Luck!

Mcat,3d51ah,quamvideri,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:06:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the confusion is. The epoxide that is formed can have bromine pointing up (that's one orientation) or bromine can point down (but this is the same orientation as before, just rotate it). Note that if the carbons were not symmetrical down the middle, it would be stereoselective. Such as this image http://imgur.com/WX987c9  EDIT: After reading your question again, I think that you believe a reaction can only be stereoselective or stereospecific. As seen in this case, there is a choice of pathway, it's just that both paths lead to only one orientation. Hence it is both stereoselective (you can attack from above or below the epoxide ring) and stereospecific (only one orientation/product)."
Mcat,3d51ah,Loare,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:34:15 2015 UTC,"My main problem is with the claim in their explanation that ""any reaction that is stereospecific is also stereoselective"". In this case, it is stereospecific because only one product is formed (a meso compound), and stereoselective because it is capable of reacting with different stereoisomers to different degrees. But if it was not a meso compound, it seems like it would be stereospecific but NOT stereoselective (contradicting EK). Am I wrong here?"
Mcat,3d51ah,xam2y,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"Or am I just misunderstanding the definitions? Is stereospecific a ""special case"" of stereoselective, where only one compound is formed?"

Mcat,3d2it1,sau_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:00:00 2015 UTC,"wow, straight from TKR website too! Thanks."
Mcat,3d2it1,rkumar3,6,Tue Jul 14 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"Hey all, not the guy who said he would post tomorrow, but I already had made scans of the Quicksheets before so I could read them on the go. Some sheets may be blurry on the edges because I had copied them on my cheap Canon copier that isn't that big.:https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B28NfDBEaCegcEZVcEdFZjRzUFk/view?usp=sharing  Also the 2 ARTICLE QAs will be a little late today since I got behind in my schedule last weekend and I'm making up the hours lost, but they will be posted before midnight!"

Mcat,3d2it1,ihavenowisdom,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:50:44 2015 UTC,You're awesome!
Mcat,3d2it1,Profreshnol,11,Tue Jul 14 18:02:52 2015 UTC,I just got my new set recently. The quick sheets are at my college apartment. When I get there I'll bring them with me to the library and scan them for you. Earliest will be Tuesday   Edit: I'll just post them to the subreddit for everyone to see
Mcat,3d2it1,ThinkBeDo,2,Mon Jul 13 07:49:56 2015 UTC,I'm interested in these as well :)
Mcat,3d2it1,Loare,2,Mon Jul 13 09:34:39 2015 UTC,Help a brother out? I'd appreciate it
Mcat,3d2it1,ihavenowisdom,2,Mon Jul 13 12:51:46 2015 UTC,Please post them on this subreddit!
