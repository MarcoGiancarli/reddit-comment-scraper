LasVegas,3e4csw,hb2112,3,Tue Jul 21 21:25:33 2015 UTC,One of my favorite is Mr. Lucky's 24/7 at the Hard Rock Casino. Where I get the surf and turf. It's called the triple 7 it's an off menu item. But it only cost 7.77 cents it's a nice homage to classic Vegas.
LasVegas,3e4csw,Blackdogrmh,3,Wed Jul 22 01:09:21 2015 UTC,"Some of my favorite buffets are the off the strip casinos like Red Rock. Great prices and good food. I've tried the expensive buffets and was very disappointed in the food for the price. The one exception to that is the M casino buffet for $30, great food every single time I've been there with a very solid desert area too."
LasVegas,3e4csw,mikarm,3,Wed Jul 22 02:08:45 2015 UTC,"If you want to go somewhere fun with a vintage vegas feel, I really recommend the peppermill. It's basically diner food, with huge portions, but it's a fun atmosphere and the restaurant is 24/7. Make sure to go to the fireside lounge for a cocktail before you eat, it's cheesy in all the right ways."

LasVegas,3e2lhb,Thyrsus24,0,Wed Jul 22 00:58:19 2015 UTC,How much time is needed to enjoy the park?? I'm usually beat in about 6 to 8 hours of hiking/sightseeing... 2.5 hours there..2.5 back... why spend money on ANOTHER hotel or b&b?
LasVegas,3e2lhb,allieegatorr,2,Wed Jul 22 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"The travel time to Zion is about 2.5 hours. It is a bit of a drive, but if you like hikes and great views, it is really well worth it. I've done a day trip a couple of times and didn't have any regrets.  It's really an amazing place. If you're okay with the driving, I don't think you'll be disappointed. I'd be willing to bet if you only made a day trip you'd want to revisit for a more extended stay in the future."

LasVegas,3e03ge,foreverNEET,5,Mon Jul 20 22:43:23 2015 UTC,1) Upgrade your pants to slacks and the collared shirt to a nice button down. Maybe even a tie if you can manage a windsor.  2) Sell yourself as the best choice for the position and back it up with examples. Make them up if you have too.   3) Exude confidence from every orifice.  3) Check prospects every day. There is a lot of competition is the service industry you need to make sure your potential employer believes you really want the job.  4) Don't ever mention anything about temporary employment or even make reference to the possibility. Nobody wants to be anyones stepping stone to the top. Pretend you are looking for a career and ask career minded questions  5) Find an area you want to work in and go door to door with resumes. When word of mouth can't get you in you need to use your feet. Make sure you put the Resume in a manager's hand if possible. Make sure your resume is grammatically correct and triple check your spelling.  Also build a linkedin profile for yourself if you have not already. May not be much help now but years down the road after you build your profile up it may land you the job of a lifetime.   Of course these are just suggestions and I am not implying that you don't already do these things.
LasVegas,3e03ge,WestsideStorybro,2,Mon Jul 20 23:36:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the thoughtful response. Is there a color that is more appealing for collared shifts? I have a blue one and I'm starting to think maybe my clothes look a little too big on me too so that might cause my appearance to come off as less proffessional. I have ties and have never worn them for interviews but perhaps I should try something new! As for checking my prospects everyday, do you mean I should call them everyday to see if they have made a decision? I don't want to misunderstand. I would be afraid of annoying employers if I did this or is this seen as good? I haven't tried going door to door with resumes but I have gone to many stores within a mall that I live nearby and asked if they had any jobs available. I had resumes with me in my envelope but I didn't hand any over since each of them said no or apply online. Maybe I should have handed it to them anyways and say I hope they consider me. I think I need to make some changes! I haven't made a linkedin profile yet but I have heard of it. Thank you for the suggestions."
LasVegas,3e03ge,WestsideStorybro,3,Tue Jul 21 00:52:52 2015 UTC,/u/mikarm has some good additions you should read.
LasVegas,3e03ge,mikarm,3,Tue Jul 21 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely go with slacks, button down, and a tie. Generally with any job I apply for I go in dressed very nice like that. When I needed a job in Vegas I went to Sears that way and everyone else who applied except for one guy was in a polo and jeans. Me and that guy got jobs. It wasn't all in how I dressed but it does show that I was at least a little more serious about being there than others were.  I agree on making things up. It is a shitty thing to have to do but if people think everyone else isn't making themselves look better than they actually are then they are wrong. I know people who flat out lie about previous jobs and get hired easily. You just have to make sure you can do whatever job they are hiring you for. If it is just sales or customer service then saying you did sales at such and such company(that maybe doesn't exist anymore) isn't hurting anyone.  You don't even have to lie really, you can just make your previous jobs or experiences sound better than they actually were with a nice description. Look here for an example but you can find lots of that stuff around google. Don't get wild with what you say because they may ask you to explain, but the above is a good example of a more descriptive job duty that is true.  Hopefully OP reads this but another great thing to remember is DO NOT bad mouth previous employers. I don't care if you had a huge falling out, if you bad mouth the old job then the hiring manager can expect you to do the same when you leave there too. Depending on the old job a good answer is to say you were looking for more challenging work so you left, something like that. If you were fired it gets a little tougher to answer."
LasVegas,3e03ge,WestsideStorybro,3,Tue Jul 21 01:20:30 2015 UTC,"don't even have to lie really   Embellish is a wonderful word that is underappreciated and powerful if used correctly. Doubling down on the do not bad mouth previous employers. I cant believe I left that one out. Never use the word fired. Just say let go, still dirty but not as sharp."
LasVegas,3e03ge,mikarm,3,Tue Jul 21 01:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah embellish is much better word for it. I've been fired from a few jobs and made the mistake of bad mouthing them, not in a terrible way but I did say things I should have just kept private. I still got hired doing that sometimes but it hurts your chances. Even if you got fired for a completely bullshit reason it is the past and should be left there.  I was going to reply to OP but I didn't want to put a bunch of replies in here, but you took care of that for me anyway."
LasVegas,3e03ge,mikarm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:03 2015 UTC,Thank you both for the replies. Thank you for the advice on how to dress and interview help Mikarm. My black shirt that I wear is button down but I'm thinking of going with another color. I tend to wear my black dress pants when I go to interviews but now I plan to get at least one black slacks. I never wore a tie once to interviews and now I'll start. I didn't want to be overdressed but that's better than underdressing and it's more professional too. I'll work on embellishing during interviews. I tend to just talk about the company and how I would like to work with them. Right now I'm uncertain about where I want to go career wise and maybe they sense that I don't have a passion for a specific job yet. I don't know but I won't know if I'm not given the chance so if I have to embellish for a chance I will.
LasVegas,3e03ge,mikarm,2,Tue Jul 21 04:02:49 2015 UTC,"You can get really deep into what colors are best if you google it. Different colors give different impressions apparently. Black is probably not the greatest impression you could be giving. I always liked a nice white or baby or pale blue shirt but then you also have to have a tie to at least somewhat match it. You can get deep into ties as well.  Like WestSideStorybro said, the knot you tie matters. Different knots look good on different collar types and also the width of the tie is a big deal too depending on body type and all that. Make sure the tie is long enough as well, you want it to be at your belt with the tip(not the whole wide end) just ever so slightly below the belt. Google it, pictures are easier. No matter what as long as it is at least touching the belt you should be set. Dressing well is complicated.  I always figured being overdressed was better. However I only went with the button down(long sleeve) and tie, I wouldn't go any further than that like an actual suit for a regular job. I know you didn't mention doing that, but I thought I'd say it anyway."

I wanted to tell you all I got the best news! I managed to get a job today! I'm super happy haha I went to a job for a cashier position this morning that supposedly paid 7 an hour so I didn't know what to expect. I was worried since that was below minimum wage but I really needed the money. So I came in dressed in my blue buttoned up shirt wearing a tie for once. I felt confident I would get the job since I made adjustments to my outfit and planned out more on what I wanted to say during and interview and my plans for the future. It ended up not being below min wage like I was worried about. It wasn't a sketchy place either, it's a nice restaurant. So I'm really happy right now. I decided to not get my cpr certificate right now since apparently I need get a food handler's card so I am prioritizing that at the moment. Thanks a lot for the help guys.

I recently hired for a similar position and had a heck of a time finding someone.   Definitely find at least one job before you move. Also, when you go to rent, it would be smart to rent near your work or central to the city. A short commute is important to an employer. When my staff come in late because of traffic, I change their work hours so they have to be to work a half hour before anyone else to beat the traffic. New residents tend to make the mistake of living on the edges of town.   I'm convinced that Las Vegas is the greatest city in the U.S. But it takes effort to acclimate here.   Do some homework on professional organizations. You'll need to start building connections. Employers have a tendency not to want to hire someone that hasn't lived here at least 2 years. Las Vegas can be so very different for folks - with problem gambling or drugs or concerns for their children's education/environment being top reasons to leave town."

Also not far from the Strip is Town Square, a nice shopping area with a movie theater, lots of restaurants, and an arcade (Gameworks). That same center also has a place called Artsie Nannies, which is a temporary day-care. Some of our friends check their kids in their and go have dinner on date nights (cheaper than a baby sitter). There's also a whole theme park at Circus Circus, we have two water parks each about 20 minutes from the Strip, and I'd also take them to SkyZone (located about 10 minutes south of the Strip), a giant warehouse completely filled with trampolines.

The Steak Out is a place UNLV illum hangs out. It's cheaper but not cheap. Has the added bonus of local crappy bar food.   The Huntridge off of Maryland and Charleston is not a collage bar, it's a dive bar but it's cheap.  Bastille is literally the cheapest place in town, but it's gay bar.

Huntridge and Double Down are my favorite bars on earth.  Vegas doesn't have ""college bars"" the way most places do. UNLV is a commuter campus, so there's really no bar where you'll find mainly college students. The closest I can think of might be Crown & Anchor, an Irish bar near Tropicana and Maryland.  If you want to meet shithead bros and drunk skanks, anyplace cheap on the Strip would be good, or if you want to spend a lot more on drinks and find more upscale drunk skanks, the Yard House in Town Square."

You could file a police report with them and they could run it vs a pawn search assuming whoever took it tried to pawn it ..  That being said , it's worthwhile to invest in camera insurance . After I left a camera case with 2 bodies and 5 lenses in the middle of the desert, I was lucky enough to retrace my steps via gps and no one took them.  I wound up getting an all peril insurance policy for my camera gear for around $150 a year.

LasVegas,3cdci6,gunnarig,9,Tue Jul 7 00:59:19 2015 UTC,"Whether or not it's worth it is a personal preference. I personally would never stay off the strip. Being on the strip is part of the experience. I don't know where you can find a $50/night room, but I can guarantee you don't want to stay there. If you do a little more digging you can probably find something on the strip between your $1300 and $300 amounts. Check hotels like Luxor, Excalibur, Monte Carlo, Flamingo, etc. Don't gamble for comps.  DON'T GAMBLE FOR COMPS. Repeated because it's important. If you're dead set on trying to get comps, off-strip casinos will give you much better comps than strip casinos. You can gamble and try and get comps at any hotel whether you are a hotel guest or not, but that being said, it makes much more sense to gamble where you stay usually because if you've joined their players club, you're already getting credit for the room, and gambling at that hotel will only increase your spend, which will increase what the hotel gives you back."
LasVegas,3cdci6,bskt824,2,Tue Jul 7 02:18:07 2015 UTC,"I would never stay ON the Strip. Downtown is cheaper for an identical room closer to more stuff. (But if you do stay on the Strip, you're unlikely to beat Harrah's price-to-location ratio.)   I guess if you really want the Vegas experience you can get a nice Bellagio suite, but you're going to pay a helluva lot more than $1300 for 6 days.  Comps are a thing of the past unless you're wealthy."

LasVegas,3cdci6,tehmoley,3,Tue Jul 7 03:22:22 2015 UTC,"Stay off strip. You can book a downtown hotel like the El Cortez, which is very old Vegas and so much cheaper. It's a pretty short trip to the north end of the strip from there and you can walk it, hop on the bus or do the monorail(or any combination of all of those). I may be biased because I've always liked downtown, but I'd rather stay, gamble and eat there because it's less expensive, less crowded and there's a lot more going on."

LasVegas,3cdci6,tuck78,2,Wed Jul 8 14:58:47 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with off-strip casinos if you're only going to be sleeping in them.  I've stayed at the Gold Coast, Silverton Lodge and Suncoast casinos in the past few years for work and they're all very comfortable and affordable hotels.  Mind you, they are not THE BEST hotels in the world, but if you want something that's around the same quality as a Holiday Inn/Hampton Inn/DoubleTree.    From my personal experience, the three I listed were not poor quality options by any stretch.  They were not five-star, but merely adequate.  Some of the off-strip casinos have some charm to them.  Silverton Lodge has a built in Bass Pro Shop and the interior resembles some of the traditional Craftsman Style construction with a northwestern kitsch feel to the amenities.  Gold Coast (which had the most lackluster room) was full of almost entirely all Chinese restaurants and was right next door to the Rio and the Palms which made for convenient distractions for $42 a night.  Suncoast... Well, it's a nice place, has a movie theater in the casino, full of seniors (meaning no drunk frat guys wandering around), small casino floor with cheap low-stakes tables and non-hundred line nickel machines, decent food options...  It's cheap and close to Red Rocks and a ton of local retail and non-designer brand shopping."

Now it's easy to get most places by bus, and the buses are pretty nice. The only issue you'll have is that you might have to wait outside in the heat for 10 minutes for the next bus to show up.  Downtown is ideal for people with no car. I live there and bus often. Those who tell you that you need a car in Vegas live in some shitty suburb like Summerlin or Henderson. Nothing worth going to in this city is more than a 20-minute bus ride from downtown."
