spaceflight,3e32j2,g253,10,Tue Jul 21 16:07:59 2015 UTC,"Well... ""need""?  I guess you mean ""I want"", not ""we need"".    Just to give another perspective... when NASA funds these missions, they do decadal surveys with NRC to figure out what the top science priorities are.  That seems like an appropriate way to figure out what would be most helpful in science terms, so that we can get the best return on investment.    These ideas all sound sexy, but somewhat repetitive.  The third lander on Enceladus won't get anything like the attention or scientific payoff that the first one does.    Maybe 15 orbiters.  Let's take MESSENGER as a baseline and call it half a billion each.  A decade is a long time, and many of those are going very far.  Call it $7 billion.    Taking Sojourner as a baseline, let's say small landers are three for a billion -- although I don't think that will scale when you're talking about Europa and Titan.  $3 billion.   A few more deep-space probes.  Let's take NH as an estimate and say these are three-quarters of a billion each, so maybe over a fifteen-year period, another 4 or 5 missions -- call it $3 billion.    Total?  I dunno, $13 billion?  That's total mission cost over, let's say, 15 years, so it's really something like $1 billion a year.  That's a lot of money, but it's honestly much much less than I would have guessed.  We spend $3 or $4 billion on the ISS every year.    Of course, NASA currently has a large suite of missions active and in preparation, and you have to be careful of those, too.  JWST is arguably more scientifically useful -- if it works -- than all these probes put together.    So, doable, but with substantial opportunity costs.  I wonder whether anyone can tell me how far off my initial numbers are?"

Yes of course, although I do think it would benefit all mankind and not just me :-)     The third lander on Enceladus won't get anything like the attention or scientific payoff that the first one does.     I'd be super excited with just one of course, but I think it would make sense to have two or three for redundancy. Both in case something goes wrong (so at least one lander makes it) and in terms of not drawing broad conclusions from just one spot. But I think you're right those would probably be quite costly. I took Sojourner as an example because it's a successfull low-cost mission, but Mars might be relatively easy compared to those exotic moons.     We spend $3 or $4 billion on the ISS every year.     Really? That's a preposterous amount. The ISS is very cool, but I don't think that's money well spent."

Lessons learned on the ISS will be instrumental to forming the basis of human exploration for the entirety of mankind. The platform would be worth it at twice times that cost.  Just because it's not going somewhere new every other year doesn't mean it isn't forming the foundation of the entirety of human exploration for the future.

The odd thing I'm trying to figure out is that the company seems to be headed by the wife of Richard Garriott, ""Lord British"" of video game design fame and who also made two trips to the ISS.

Here is a video of a laser powered spacecraft that even used the Earth's atmosphere itself as propellant... for at least an initial booster stage.  It is a concept that has been talked about for years in a number of forms including small demonstrators (just like in the video link above).  Nothing that has actually gone to orbit has been made before, but this press release isn't claiming they have gone into orbit either.  I'm not completely discounting the accomplishment, just the fact that it is the ""worlds first experiment"" of this kind of idea.  It may very well be the first externally powered superheated plasma thruster to have been made to work, but other people have thought about how to off load the power generators from the rocket itself.  It also has a huge potential to make a difference in the launch industry.  If they can pull off the claim to launch a 200 kg payload to LEO for only $30k, it will be such a game changer that I think even Elon Musk will be worried that his business model for SpaceX is too conservative.

Anything really big, or to a high energy orbit, or both (mars?) is still gonna need a conventional rocket, just due to both the limitations of how much thrust they can realistically produce with this, and the high falloff of efficiency as the craft gets further away from the transmitter."
spaceflight,3do792,brickmack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:04:03 2015 UTC,"I definitely see this technology being practical for a lower stage design even on some larger vehicle.  I'm not entirely sure how well this scales though, which is going to be an interesting problem they will have to face.  On the other hand, there is a huge open niche that SpaceX (and I might as well note nearly all of the other major launch providers as well) is mostly leaving alone in the small payload market.  Yes, SpaceX is sending up microsats (aka stuff under 100 kg) as tertiary payloads on many of their flights, but it is on a space available basis and subject to flight delays from not only the launch provider but also the other larger payload customers.  Having the ability to send small payloads like that up as a primary payload and potentially being able to launch on demand as well as other significant customer service features is a big deal, especially if you can beat cost as well.  I'll also note that this small satellite market is one that is growing  too, and something where there is some significant market elasticity with regards to price.  That is definitely not the case with the large payloads such as a GEO sat or huge probes to the outer planets, where the cost of the launch is very nearly a rounding error on the overall project budget.... well perhaps less than a third and sometimes substantially less than that of the total budget, even at $10k/kg.  For small satellites, it is the exact opposite where launch costs are by far the major cost driver at the moment."
spaceflight,3do792,rshorning,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:54:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about it being practical for a larger vehicle, unless they can make the energy transfer much more efficient. Their website says they're aiming for a 200kg payload and a dry mass of the plane of 750kg, and 72% of the total mass would be fuel. That means the total mass would be about 3.5-3.6 tons. It also says that takeoff TWR (which is generally when the throttle would be at maximum) is 1.25, so that means the engine is putting out somewhere around 4 tons of thrust. And thats for 500 kW of power. Lets compare that to the mass of a typical hydrolox first stage, the Delta IV CBC. That, fully fueled, weighs 226 tons. Lets lop of 1/4 of that since we don't need the oxygen anymore (so 170 tons). And with the higher ISP of this system, that should be a good first stage for a super heavy launcher I would think. Assuming this scales linearly (and it rarely does) to get the needed thrust to get that thing to lift off would take 21.25 megawatts. That is a lot of power (enough that it would probably dim the lights of an average city when turned on). Just some quick back of the envelope type stuff so I'm probably wrong in a few details, but I don't think its very practical for a medium-heavy sized launcher. Even for a small sized launcher (say, 40 tons) it would use a lot of power  For small satellites, maybe. But even then, thats probably not going to be a big concern for the established launch providers. They make almost all their money off the big primary payloads, not the cubesats and such they cram in. It might make a small dent in their profit margins, but its not an existential threat"
spaceflight,3do792,brickmack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"It looks like they are using a pretty massive capacitor bank for temporary energy storage as a part of their overall system.  While definitely an engineering challenge and it will have some pretty huge capital costs, there are existing energy systems that store up to gigawatts of power for short bursts.  That includes stuff like ITER and CERN (to give some larger examples) and many other smaller systems in other various industries.  From the video, it appears as though they eventually plan on building an array of transmitters that independently track the launch vehicle to provide power, thus allowing at least for that segment of the technology the ability to scale.  Yes, no doubt that the scaling issues will be a problem though even when that happens.  At the moment though, I would be impressed if they even get these small payloads to orbit with this technology.  Let's see how far they get in that direction before arguing if it can scale up to metric ton sized payloads or more."

Maybe it's a fear thing?   There are unfortunately many millions of people who are super jazzed about blowing huge amounts of money on the military in America. There is indeed an aspect of it related to fear, but it's also more generally tied into the traditional Republican policy program of strong defense. This is one of the main reasons why so much space research has been conducted by the military-- even today the DoD vastly outspends NASA on space.  I happen to work with the USAF on the project I'm currently on, as well, and to me the whole situation is simply absurd. The military is grossly inefficient, and blithely wastes millions of dollars on excess paperwork, bureaucracy, and risk avoidance, all the while trying to accomplish things that nominally should not fall under its mandate anyway. In particular, the weather satellite constellation I'm working on is a collaboration by NOAA and the USAF for funding, with some hardware produced by NASA under contract. If NOAA had anywhere near the funding the USAF has for weather, which it really should given that atmospheric observation is its mission, this would be a fully funded mission by NOAA and would likely be much closer to launch (and not have any of our current funding issues). As it is, the sheer dominance of the military in the US space business is still smothering everything."

Most of the stuff attributed to them is actually from the military or the private sector.   And most of the stuff attributed to the military was actually developed commercially, and only saw widespread adoption in the military. But that's alright-- you're basically agreeing with me anyway that it can't be argued that the military is actually responsible for these technological developments.  I also didn't say that NASA would deliver lots of spinoffs, though it has.   The best example for your case, really, is GPS, which is one of the most commercially beneficial space technology implemented by the military, mainly because of cheap time transfer, and it's more difficult to argue that anyone else would have been motivated to spend so much on a navigation system. It was the military who developed the LORAN systems that preceded it, as well.   But on the other hand, you can't really argue that NOAA would not be launching more weather satellites if they had more funding. Why do the Air Force, Army, and Navy need to be funded to do their own weather prediction? They don't, and the fact that they do has a detrimental effect on the space industry, both governmental and commercial.   Teflon was discovered by accident but its first use was in valve coatings for the Manhattan Project. Ten years later the French started using it on pans.   Not the very first, just an early one.

Finding out what's in its oceans require landing (always risky) and possibly drilling through tens to hundreds of km of ice (not happening in our lifetimes).   Enceladus: the Saturnian environment is not as harsh as Jupiter and Enceladus continually spews tons of water into space, something Europa seems to do only intermittently. This makes sampling Enceladus's subsurface oceans much easier. A mission to Saturn could also always include a Titan lander because that moon is very easy to land on.

spaceflight,3dbz5x,hospitalvespers,-4,Wed Jul 15 08:09:41 2015 UTC,Back to basics: we're still using the same propulsion technologies we used in the 1960's.  We should kill the manned space program for a while and put that money into work on basic tech that is holding back every area of space exploration and development.
spaceflight,3dbz5x,billdietrich1,3,Wed Jul 15 06:12:12 2015 UTC,...that is holding back every area of space exploration and development.   What does that even mean? We just witnessed New Horizons complete a successful fly-by of Pluto and Dawn has arrived at Ceres. Both using 1960's tech.
spaceflight,3dbz5x,TaloKrafar,2,Wed Jul 15 08:55:56 2015 UTC,"Until we reduce cost-to-orbit by a major factor, maybe 100x, we won't be able to build serious space stations, move asteroids, have a Moon colony, send well-shielded manned missions to Mars.  We need some new way to get major mass into orbit and move mass around."
spaceflight,3dbz5x,billdietrich1,2,Wed Jul 15 10:27:27 2015 UTC,SpaceX has reduced cost to orbit by a major factor.  The trick is avoiding the massive admin overhead of traditional dinospace.
spaceflight,3dbz5x,ar0cketman,2,Wed Jul 15 14:22:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe 2x.  Just by updating to modern materials and computers and such, not any new propulsion."
spaceflight,3dbz5x,billdietrich1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"New propulsion isn't going to reduce cost, it'll just be the same cost per mission plus a massive development cost. Whats needed is reusability and orbital infrastructure"
spaceflight,3dbz5x,brickmack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:15:26 2015 UTC,"It's not cost per mission that's so important, it's cost per mass.  Which directly affects how much infrastructure we can put in orbit."
spaceflight,3dbz5x,billdietrich1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:16:52 2015 UTC,Cost per mass is not a valid measurement
spaceflight,3dbz5x,brickmack,2,Wed Jul 15 19:19:46 2015 UTC,Yes.  We need to stop dicking around and finish those impulse engines and warp nacelles.
spaceflight,3dbz5x,Flyberius,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:27:08 2015 UTC,"That works is ongoing. Research into the alcubierre drive and the space propeller is ongoing. SpaceX and others are working the commercial competitive launch to orbit market. With the exception of the SLS (Senate Launch System), our resources are adequately targeted."
spaceflight,3dbz5x,jimgagnon,0,Wed Jul 15 16:00:13 2015 UTC,I think the manned program is mostly a waste of money until we solve the underlying cost/mass problem.  We should kill the manned program and put that money into MANY different approaches to fixing the cost-to-orbit and space propulsion problems.
spaceflight,3d9mhf,ltsaGiraffe,3,Tue Jul 14 16:04:53 2015 UTC,New favorite poem.
spaceflight,3d9mhf,Saphiric,2,Wed Jul 15 02:26:25 2015 UTC,"Imo, I thought it was a pretty cool thing of NPR to do. I liked the use of Bradbury's poem; very fitting."
spaceflight,3d9mhf,FlyingFeesh,2,Tue Jul 14 16:47:32 2015 UTC,I find it kink of melancholy. Do you know why Bradbury wrote it?
spaceflight,3d9mhf,Flyberius,3,Wed Jul 15 07:27:58 2015 UTC,"I find it very uplifting.  To me the poem is almost rejoicing that we are the first generation of people who have the means to understand our place in the universe.  Unlike those before us who knew what they wanted to know but had to be content just wondering.  Either way, beautiful poem and amazing video."
spaceflight,3d72j7,rollotomasi07071,7,Tue Jul 14 00:59:20 2015 UTC,TLDR: Paint with a high surface area to trap outgassing chemicals.
spaceflight,3d3a7u,sunfishtommy,58,Mon Jul 13 04:26:45 2015 UTC,"The RD-180 engine (one engine, two thrust chambers, two nozzles) used for the Common Core vehicle of the Atlas V has the ability to slew it's nozzles up to 8 degrees, which is more than sufficient to account for the slight asymmetry that the single booster creates.  Note that the single booster is located on the centerline between the two Common Core nozzles, allowing maximum nozzle slew to counteract the moment induced by the offline booster thrust.  It also has to do with where the LOx feedline run and shrouds are located on the external skin--those could have been relocated (clocked) if a need had existed but not reduced in cross-section due to flowrate requirements.  It's the reason that the Atlas V can be configured with up to five, not six, solid rocket boosters (think packing fraction).  Also keep in mind that, in addition to the pitching moment that the single solid booster causes, the form drag of that booster also moves the CP (Center of Pressure) of the entire vehicle towards the booster, which results in an off-setting pitching moment.  As a side note, I happen to be the engineer who designed the monocoque construction for the ""duckbill"" fairing design for the boosters.  Reddit can call bullshit, but I still know what the first ply failure criteria is based upon the loads document provided by Lockheed Martin as a function of the longitudinal and polar station of the shroud.  It's not an intuitive failure mode.  Always love to see hardware I directly influenced heading skywards."
spaceflight,3d3a7u,macblastoff,29,Mon Jul 13 05:16:27 2015 UTC,"Historical Side note:  General Dynamics (original company responsible for the Atlas family of missiles and launch vehicles before it was purchased by Lockheed-Martin) developed a program called ALS (Advanced Launch System) which involved a core and a half design as one of the lower throw weight configurations.  It consisted of a Common Core-like booster with an identical ""strap on"" core for efficiency of scale next to it, with the stack built up on the main core vehicle--think Delta IV with only one booster.  It was intended to ""fly sideways"" and even use the AoA (angle of attack) to gain lift to compensate for the inherent dragginess of the solution.  One of the drawbacks is that the skins and interstage adapter had to be beefed up to handle the increased bending moment and buckling loads induced by flying sideways during boost phase, such that it largely cancelled the gains sought via commonality.  The project eventually went the way of the Dodo, but those studies significantly impacted the way the Atlas II configurations and Atlas V Common Core design developed.  Why shouldn't it have?  The same people who worked on those concepts continued to support Atlas after the fact, and in fact, a large majority of that same engineering staff relocated to Colorado when GD was purchased by Lockheed-Martin.  I'm convinced this influenced the single booster configuration of the Atlas V, and given its much lower off line thrust component from the single solid booster, bending moment and buckling loads are sufficiently small to be covered within the structural margins of the other failure modes."
spaceflight,3d3a7u,macblastoff,5,Mon Jul 13 05:32:53 2015 UTC,"Wow awesome explanation, this was exactly what I was wondering about.  So cool to get an inside technical explanation."
spaceflight,3d3a7u,rspeed,4,Mon Jul 13 14:09:55 2015 UTC,That would have been an amazing launch to watch.
spaceflight,3d3a7u,wutzu,8,Mon Jul 13 16:42:29 2015 UTC,"If you look closely at the nozzle of the Atlas V SRB, you will see that the nozzle is pointed outboard somewhat. The goal with the nozzle pointing would be to put the thrust through the CG of the entire rocket stack, to minimize yaw.   The Space Shuttle Main Engines on the Shuttle Orbiter were pointed way out in order to keep the thrust through the CG of the SRB/External Tank/Orbiter assembly."
spaceflight,3d3a7u,vipersfate,4,Mon Jul 13 04:55:18 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the single SRB on the 501 also help with the gravity turn. I'm not sure how, but it seems to make sense in my brain."
spaceflight,3d3a7u,Sparamoule,6,Mon Jul 13 04:59:28 2015 UTC,"The rocket's computer already compensates for the off-center thrust so yeah, indirectly the main engine gimbal would maintain a smaller angle to steer at the same speed as it would without a SRB."
spaceflight,3d3a7u,rspeed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:18:32 2015 UTC,But if it were to help with the gravity turn wouldn't the SRB need to be on the bottom?  It looks like it flies on top for most of the flight.  Would this help at all with generating lift over the rocket body?
spaceflight,3d3a7u,vipersfate,2,Mon Jul 13 14:01:14 2015 UTC,The whole point of the gravity turn is for the rocket to slowly fall over on its own as a differential between gravity and aerodynamic forces. So any offset thrust doesn't really help with it.
spaceflight,3d3a7u,mendahu,2,Mon Jul 13 16:44:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for explaining that.
spaceflight,3d3a7u,ltjpunk387,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:40:01 2015 UTC,Isn't this kind of a moot point since the centre of gravity will shoot up as the fuel is drained? In a rocket it's a moving target so unless the srb can gimbal it probably won't help.
spaceflight,3d3a7u,jardeon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:54:39 2015 UTC,"SRBs usually can vector a small amount. I believe by injecting gases at the skirt, but I'm sure there are other methods.   Even if it couldn't though, the main engines can gimbal to overcome any torque from the SRB."
spaceflight,3d3a7u,marzipandancer,3,Tue Jul 14 05:33:47 2015 UTC,"Indirectly related, but I believe that ULA/Sierra Nevada is giving us a hint that they intend to launch DreamChaser in the Atlas V 411 Configuration"
spaceflight,3d3a7u,ltjpunk387,6,Mon Jul 13 19:20:46 2015 UTC,"This has got to be the most in depth, satisfying discussion about space flight I've ever seen on this sub. It's what I always hoped to read in the comment section of /r/spaceflight. I'm just commenting to mark the occasion."
spaceflight,3d3a7u,falcongsr,2,Mon Jul 13 08:51:37 2015 UTC,non symmetrical rocket design.    Like the Space Shuttle? It's the same concept. Watch launch videos from the side and you will see the Space Shuttle does not fly vertically either.
spaceflight,3d3a7u,CptAJ,5,Tue Jul 14 05:37:39 2015 UTC,Neat. I believe the main engines have a gimbaling system which can offset the asymmetric thrust.
spaceflight,3d3a7u,macblastoff,-1,Mon Jul 13 04:54:07 2015 UTC,It becomes less counterintuitive if you think of it like this:  http://i.imgur.com/q5VD07h.jpg

spaceflight,3czrxv,Nowin,15,Tue Jul 14 00:09:10 2015 UTC,"That's nuts. They have intakes that suck in air when in atmosphere, cool it in almost no time, and burn it with liquid hydrogen. When you cool air, however, the relative humidity lowers (i.e. air at 90 F can hold more water than air at -30 F, even when both are 100% humidity). That vapor freezes and clogs the tubes in 3 seconds. To combat this, they pump methane methanol (antifreeze) going against the airflow up the tubes. Nuts, I tell you. Nuts."

Are there any equivalent technologies to this?"
spaceflight,3czrxv,invisty,3,Sun Jul 12 21:08:05 2015 UTC,There really aren't. The precooler is the key technology that makes the rest possible.  Alan Bond said they are working on an even better precooler that has no visible ducts because they are microscopic in size. It would be even more efficient. Quite amazing.
spaceflight,3czrxv,thegreattranslation,3,Mon Jul 13 14:54:04 2015 UTC,"I'v read the article three times now. I kinda get it, but I need a schematic or something. I hope RE reveals some more details. I want to understand this a little better.  Very cool though. I can't wait till they have a SABRE prototype, whenever that will be. I know RE was given £60 million to develop it."
spaceflight,3czrxv,thegreattranslation,2,Sun Jul 12 14:33:27 2015 UTC,"http://reactionengines.co.uk/news_updates.html  They have a test engine which has been fired up 15 times this spring. The rest of the year will be spent to do more tests on it: do long duration burns, switching between airbreathing and rocket mode, etc..   EDIT: Here is a video of the test engine firing."
spaceflight,3czrxv,YugoReventlov,3,Sun Jul 12 20:15:32 2015 UTC,"That isn't the engine, they are testing the nozzle design there.   This experimental engine is an important step into a new era of propulsion and space access. We are using it to test the aerodynamics and performance of the advanced nozzles that the SABRE engine will use, in addition to new manufacturing technologies such as our 3D-printed injection system."

spaceflight,3czrxv,Lars0,2,Mon Jul 13 21:55:07 2015 UTC,"Part of me wonders how well methalox would work with the SABRE cycle. The point of stability for LH2 is -252.87 C while LNG is around -260 C. Seems like both fuels would be sufficiently cold, but as I'm not a chemist or rocket scientist, I have no idea how the different viscosity of LH2 or LNG would affect the precooler design.  Methane would certainly allow for greatly reduced tankage compared to LH2, on the other hand, and that would mean that Skylon might become possible with existing materials technology."
spaceflight,3czrxv,ManWhoKilledHitler,3,Mon Jul 13 23:32:06 2015 UTC,Hydrogen has a much higher specific heat capacity than methane so it can chill far more air per kg of fuel.

spaceflight,3cv8fe,AstroChiefEngineer,12,Sat Jul 11 11:35:36 2015 UTC,Yes? It's an interesting fact that most people not well versed in the science behind this would never have known. It puts a little perspective on the physics behind using a planet for a slingshot maneuver.

spaceflight,3cbzu0,AstroChiefEngineer,5,Tue Jul 7 12:29:44 2015 UTC,"MTCR, Missile Technology Control Regime, is a treaty to limit the transfer of missile technology to non member states. In the 90s ISRO (their space program) bought cryogenic rocket engines from Russia, violating the treaty. Because of this there are sanctions against ISRO.  Those Sanctions include any satellites built in a nation which has signed the treaty, basically every major satellites manufacturer falls under this treaty.   MTCR limits where satellites can launch from, which is why the launch market is limited to only Russia, Europe, and the US. Despite many nations having capable rockets, such as India and China.  So until India becomes a member state of MTCR, no western commercial satellite can book a flight on their rockets."
spaceflight,3cbzu0,gauss-descarte,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:57:12 2015 UTC,bought cryogenic rocket engines from Russia   Its a little unfair I think.  I mean the US buy rocket engines from Russia (granted they already have the technology).  Surely Russia should have sanctions against it for providing the technology to India.
spaceflight,3cbzu0,Flyberius,5,Tue Jul 7 14:26:41 2015 UTC,"MCTR is a program to prevent ICBM development. Russia is already a member of MCTR which is why the US can purchase engines without restrictions. However, for whatever reason Russia still tried to sell engines to India. The US really clamped down on India for it though.   But even if India didn't do anything with the engines they would be in almost the same situation. However, India is currently petitioning to be a full member on the UN security Council, part of the nuclear member nations, and a member of MTCR. So India may be able to qualify in the next few years."

spaceflight,3cbzu0,brickmack,3,Mon Jul 6 23:43:53 2015 UTC,"1) Don't compare the Indian Mars orbiter to the NASA one; the NASA one is ~4 times heavier (if you compare the payload mass). The NASA orbiter has a lot more equipment. 2) There has been a lot of debate about the Indian orbiter, which is in a highly elliptical orbit - basically not very useful for it's mission objective. The NASA orbiter is in a much more useful orbit. Now this may not seem like much, but transferring to a lower altitude orbit (like NASA's MAVEN, which is also elliptical, but at a lower altitude) takes more fuel.. more fuel means a heavier space probe.. which requires a bigger rocket... which India does not have. India's orbiter was launched on the PSLV, which is a cheaper rocket and comparatively less powerful. A good choice would have been the GSLV, a much more powerful rocket which could have launched a heavier probe; but the GSLV had issues and mostly ended up with launch failures (3/8 success).  They could not have used the GSLV due to it's issues, which is why they designed the Mars orbiter to be launched on the PSLV.  I'm not bashing their efforts or anything; they've done good but a lot of factors come into play when directly comparing costs."

Pretty impressive that a cheaper Toyota even manages to run for a year, especially at the price you buy them for.  I'm saying it's impressive that they managed to build + launch successfully on their first try (not the launch), but I was merely pointing out that they made compromises and launched a less capable craft than the expensive probe everyone compares it to. Getting it to Mars no easy job, they worked well with the budget they had.. their entire project cost ~72mil.. which costs the same amount as a simple rocket launch (much more capable one that the PSLV tho).  I'm not bashing them; what they did was commendable, but they did so with compromises!"

If anything, the real story is that this is where we've come in less than ~60 years. From being bound to the Earth, to governments expending massive amounts of resources to send a handful of men and women out into space, to businessmen starting their very own space programs.

Rockets have to deal with much smaller performance margins, and they (currently) have to be thrown away on every flight.  There's just no way the reliability can get to that point – period. It can certainly get better as reuse becomes common and the flight rates increase, but even that is a long way off."

At no point did she suggest that we were perfect, that space was easy, or that there should be no more failures.  The whole point of the article is that when we hand wave a space launch failure away because it's hard, we're giving engineers ""the easy way out.""  Guess what?  Air travel's hard, too.  So is high energy physics.  But we don't give manufacturers an easy way out when a 747 goes down, or the designers of the LHC an easy way out when it had issues at startup.  No, we demand that they look into it, rigorously examine everything that could've gone wrong, and fix it for next time.  The engineers at SpaceX are going to be doing this investigation.  Our job is to demand the best out of them so that our abilities as a civilization move forward and get better, and don't stagnate in a culture of ""it's okay, it was hard.""  We should be saying ""Yes, it's hard, why didn't you succeed?""

I think you understand what this person is trying to say but they are missing their mark a lil. If we compare the car and airplane to the space flight we can see that space flight isn't fully developed with public accessible price points. So if it's still evolving where is it in that evolution and where does it need to go? In the auto and airline industry as they approached this point regulation took hold to ensure that they we standardized enough to ensure safety, but with spaceflight we are still trying to develop that standard method of better vehicle recovery.   It is easy to look at something as old as spaceflight and compare it to airplane and automobiles, but the technologies the comprise them pales in comparison to that required to spaceflight and off earth habitation. Space is the biggest challenge to humanity has yet to tackle, it is hard, but with the correct effort is accomplishable. Being hard just means it is a frontier, and frontiers mean failures will occur, period. If I want to develope warp travel every attempt I make will fail until it succeeds this is at the hearth of a frontier, it's the hard trek where you have to be able to accept failure and use it bc u can rely on an established solution.  I will point out though that the writes hearth is in a good place, they are trying to focus on the development of space travel. As the public we need to get more interest in the development of space travel bc it isn't like an airplane or a car where as it is developed everyone can relate to it and push for it bc the benefits can be understood from an individual basis, spaceflight doesn't. The public is distant for spaceflight bc they are not going to be able to flight to mars to visit grandma, or ship an Amazon order from the moon for precisely the same reasons you couldn't cross an ocean before engines , it was expensive and risky. The ones engrossed in the endeavor of developing spaceflight are the frontiers men (and woman) of our age . This is the hardest industrial undertaking currently facing humanity backed with all the reasons to do it and only the hard work left. Calling space travel hard isn't an excuse, it's a challenge, call it hard till it isn't bc we found something harder to do.

For storytelling in a movie, a goal needs to be established, a major setback has to occur, and then be overcome, all in one dramatic sweep.  Apollo 13 fits this structure perfectly.  It is peculiar, then, that the movie The Right Stuff works as well as it did.  Again, it is full of legendary people doing heroic things, but there is no singular goal and no singular obstacle to overcome.  It's more a slow and steady effort to make continual progress.

Even Apollo only had a boost protective cover, which closely matched the shape of the CM, and didn't cover the service module exterior. All of the Russian spacecraft flew completely covered inside aerodynamic fairings, and with no restriction on aerodynamics, they tend to be as close to spheres as they can, with thermal blankets covering their surfaces."
spaceflight,3bloq8,hapaxLegomina,27,Tue Jun 30 12:51:51 2015 UTC,"The Russians Soyuz uses a design originally proposed by GE for the Apollo space craft (there's a controversy about whether the Russians developed it in their own or copied the GE design). The theory behind the design is that since the heat shield and the reentry body is the heaviest part of the spacecraft make that as small possible and put the living accommodations in a separate module that is jettisoned before reentry. So instead of the 2 module Apollo spacecraft (service and command module) you have a three module spacecraft made up of a propulsion module, reentry module, and orbital module. This provides a tremendous weight saving while giving more living space. The GE Apollo design had 50% more living space and weighed less than a third as much as the North American design.

Spheres have the ideal mass/volume ratio for a pressure vessel, so it made sense to build them spherical.  On the other hand, a cylindrical shape is generally easier to fit under a payload fairing with the least space wasted."
spaceflight,3bloq8,Ravenchant,8,Tue Jun 30 11:42:19 2015 UTC,"Most early soviet craft were pressurized, because they didn't work out/have the manufacturing capability to make electronics survive the temperature environment of deep space until much later. This is why the first EVA required the use of an inflatable airlock, so the interior of the craft could stay pressurized. Structurally, rounded shapes are generally better at withstanding that sort of pressure difference. Some more modern Russian sattelites are still presurized actually, but most aren't anymore. On manned vehicles part of it is also aerodynamics. Until Apollo, no American manned craft flew with a fairing (and even the fairing on Apollo was only added as an afterthought, to protect the CM from flames from the LES. It was originally meant to fly without that). Since the Soviets used fairings on everything anyway they could make the craft whatever shape they wanted as long as it would reenter safely. Reentry was also part of it for early Russian capsules, Vostok and Voskhod plus various unmanned reentry vehicles were all spheres so they wouldn't have to worry about the pod staying oriented the right way during reentry. But beginning with Soyuz they adopted a reentry profile more similar to American capsules."
spaceflight,3bloq8,brickmack,2,Tue Jun 30 18:46:30 2015 UTC,"I was with you right up til   Vostok and Voskhod plus various unmanned reentry vehicles were all spheres so they wouldn't have to worry about the pod staying oriented the right way during reentry.   While the contents of an unmanned flight probably don't care which way is up, or even getting spun in the rinse cycle, the parachutes during deployment (and the cosmonauts on manned flights) most certainly do.  Weight distribution plays a role, but drag (see 1965 March 3 entry on drogue chute) plays an even greater role.  Note in this Voshkod capsule after return the charring on the upper surface and the more uniform annual spallation charring on the ""underside"" of the capsule.  This source describes the onset of spinning during entry due to shifted center of mass and center of pressure as a result of the orbital module not releasing initially.  This imparted a spin on the capsule during descent that was not rectified until the appropriate altitude was reached for deploying the drogue chute. Without a significant RMS as that employed on the Gemini 8 capsule, Leonev and Belyayev were unable to do anything about the spin.  Armstrong and Scott had used their Reentry Maneuvering System to counter the vertigo inducing spin that a stuck Gemini OMS thruster had set up, and worsened when Armstrong chose to jettison the Agena docking target, thinking it was the target itself causing the spinup.  Lastly, the capsule may look spherical, but it is slightly oblate, and the center of mass is located much closer to the ""floor"" than up where the drogue chute and mains are housed.  Though certainly not as stable as the Soyuz and Apollo return capsules, this does offer a slight bit of stability to resist an unrecoverable tumble.  As stated in one of the previous sources, the Voshkod drogue was designed to deploy at under 2 rpm.  Armstrong and Scott approached blacking out due to the induced rotations in their Gemini capsule when they approached 1 rev/sec--and their reefed system of deploying the mains had no tolerance for tumbling--thus entry while tumbling would have meant a fiery and abrupt end to the mission and its crew.  So while a spherical capsule is a much simpler--and structurally/weight efficient design--they did worry about orientation during entry."

However, I still believe that one can have a very significant and personally enriching experience while living in space.  Let's confine the discussion to the near future, sometime between 2025 and 2035.  By this time, commercial spaceflight will have assumed responsibility for providing access to Low Earth Orbit, opening space to the public.  There will probably be space-hotels, but as the article already explained, just floating around in an orbital hotel is probably not worthwhile, all things considered.  To have a truly meaningful experience in space, one must work in space.  Today, universities like Stanford and Berkeley maintain large and prestigious laboratories on Earth, and in the future they will likely maintain small science labs in LEO.  A typical crew would consist of a few graduate students with their advising professor, working for 4 to 6 months at a time.  Large corporations such as DOW and BASF will likely maintain their own private microgravity labs in LEO in a similar fashion.  In this situation, skilled, highly-motivated people could busy themselves with useful work which can not be done on Earth.  They would have real goals and real reasons for being in space.  At the end of the day, they would relax and be able to reflect with satisfaction on the progress they have made, and enjoy the experience of living in space for a while, as they prepare for the next day's research.  At the end of their missions, these student and private researchers would look back on their time spend in space and be able to say that even though living in space has its problems, and maybe they would never do it again, they are still glad they made the trip."

Furthermore, the raw capability of going to the Moon and possibly even beyond, certain doing something like the Inspiration Mars fly-by (which was even proposed by NASA to be done in the mid 1970's... although to Venus instead).  Instead of spending billions of dollars trying to rebuild the Saturn architecture like is being done with SLS, it would have already been done.... with glass cockpit versions of the Apollo capsule that I can only dream about right now.  I agree that the huge mega program for going to Mars likely wouldn't have happened even now in that alternate reality, but there has also been a huge waste and squandering of resources in the meantime that should similarly be unacceptable to anybody with an objective view."

spaceflight,3awmd0,Erpp8,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:52:46 2015 UTC,"So instead, we got half of the missions for even more cost, as a practical result of this ""cost-savings"" move of making the Shuttle.  The thing is that everybody involved really did know the actual costs involved with the Shuttle program, at least before the hull of the Columbia was actually built and likely before.  Perhaps some members of Congress would have benefited with something functionally equivalent to the Kerbal Space Program to find out how unrealistic such expectations were, but the size of the orbiter fleet, the production rate that ATK actually had with the SRBs, and several other factors should have clued in a whole bunch of people just how far off the mark almost every one of those original projections were that NASA officials at least publicly claimed the Shuttle should have flown.  These are rocket scientists after all, and for most of them the actual flight rate that the Shuttle actually flew as well as the costs involved really wasn't that much of a surprise.  It was the wishful thinking by administrators who were divorced from reality and didn't bother paying attention to the actual engineers which resulted in those unrealistic claims as well as sadly even the deaths of the astronauts involved."
spaceflight,3awmd0,rshorning,4,Wed Jun 24 12:47:08 2015 UTC,"You see, I don't know what you're trying to say. None of that contradicts what I said. My point is that NASA pitched the shuttle as being cheaper. As the development came to a close, they saw the costs were much higher, but by that point, they had sunk too much cost to kill the program right before it delivered results."
spaceflight,3awmd0,Erpp8,2,Wed Jun 24 13:09:30 2015 UTC,"And this was exactly the kind of argument that really did happen among people with a clue debating the program in the 1970's.  There were several very knowledgeable people who did complain about the flight rate and costs well before those ""sunk costs"" were incurred, even before the Saturn infrastructure was dismantled.  In addition, several deliberate decisions were also made even during the planning and development of the Shuttle that not only took those costs that everybody knew would be the case, but also made them even worse by cutting costs during development but increasing the cost substantially during the operational phase of the Shuttle.  The whole thing is a cautionary tale of mismanagement, which even worse hasn't been learned by even current members of Congress.  The debacle that is seen with SLS, the James Webb Telescope, and now even with the current games being played with Commercial Crew only underscore how much has still not been learned by those who make space policy and allocate funds for spaceflight."

spaceflight,3awmd0,jugzluvsrad,4,Wed Jun 24 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"The author reasons incorrectly that NASA could not have continued to advance the space frontier because their plans were too unrealistic.  His error is his assumption that NASA decides the future of the space program.  NASA has never been allowed to plan its own future.  Every time the government gave them a chance, NASA blew it with unrealistic fantasy proposals.  First there was the Space Transportation System in 1969, then the Space Exploration Initiative in 1989.  Neither of these plans were realized, yet NASA didn't disappear.  It simply had its future plans dictated by the government, as it always has.  Unfortunately, those plans were badly misguided.  Since 1972, no human has gone beyond Low Earth Orbit.  This is not for lack of funding, rather, it is in spite of substantial, sustained funding.  For the past 40 years, NASA has been funded at a steady 70% of the Apollo-Era average.  At this rate of funding, NASA would have landed on the Moon by 1973 instead of 1969.  Since 1972, NASA has spent the same amount of money as 4 Apollo Programs without even one single Moon landing to show for it.  Instead, we got the International Space Station and 135 flights of the Space Shuttle.  While they are impressive in their own right, they are not as impressive as 4-consecutive Apollo Programs would have been.  Today, the Shuttle-Era has finally ended, and the ISS has a firm termination date of 2024.  Commercial spaceflight will enable private organizations to perform their own microgravity research, forever removing that burden from NASA.  Astronauts will cease to be lab technicians and once again become explorers.  Prototyping of the SLS launch vehicle is underway, and while it is a mere re-incarnation of the Saturn V, it will, using the funding once tied up by the Shuttle and ISS, enable NASA to do what it could have been doing with the Saturn V since Apollo 17.  We can start with interplanetary fly-bys of Venus and Mars, and rendezvous with near-earth asteroids.  Then, we can move-on and establish a small, but continuing presence on the Moon and on Mars with just two or three SLS launches per year.  We don't even need to invent any fundamentally new technologies to do it.  Today, it is only a matter of specifying the hardware, sending out a request-for-proposals, and awarding the contracts.  Robert Zubrin has made this abundantly clear.  JPL and the Planetary Society recently performed a study on the feasibility of human missions to Mars by the 2030s and concluded that it can be done, if only NASA can remain focused on the goal."

spaceflight,3awmd0,TotesMessenger,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:34:29 2015 UTC,I strongly disagree with the idea is wouldnt have been worth it to have a base on the moon.  If we had we would have solved many moon construction problems by now. The whole world's psychy would have been vastly different for the past thirty or more years as everyone would have been realizing we were an interplanetary species and there was more to do than just squabble about the earth. That alone would have inspired many more space scientists and advancements as well as ending some national conflicts sooner as nations focused more effort and money on more space colonization opportunities.  There probably would have been a great space telescope on the moon already with far higher resolution than hubble.  We would probably have high res photos of other inhabitable worlds by now and launched rockets from the moon to mars and elsewhere.  We might also have mass launchers and have buolt some of Gerard O'Neill's giant space habitats by now.  Even a minimal construction presence on the moon would spun off so much more advancement than we can get from launching from earth. Moon metalurgy and concrete as well as tunneling as well as oxygen mining.  We would also probably be melting water from moon ice by now too whichould habe unleashed incredible options 20 years ago.  We lost a near lifetime of human soace progress by not building  apermanent moon colony in the 80's. The space shuttle was a huge step back sadly.

spaceflight,3amlsb,fireproofsalamander,13,Sun Jun 21 21:11:01 2015 UTC,"My advice to you is to learn to play with CAD until it's fun and awesome and intricate 3D designs flow out of you easily. Learn to code until you can create beautiful mechanisms that exist only in the ether. Find your local makerspace  (like TechShop) and learn to CNC Machine, weld, laser cut, waterjet, etc., until you can build like Tony Stark.  Get your degree and integrate all these passions to create amazing physical machines by yourself (and with others!) that behave organically and do the work of humankind, possibly mining the asteroids.  Never hoard knowledge. Always teach others and be generous and kind, even in the face of aggression and ridicule. You'll win them over.  You're going to have an incredible career. Carry the torch, my friend."

This is an era-defining video and it's a great shame that all that remains is a significantly degraded version. The video will still be important in 100,000 and 1,000,000 years if our species survives this long. Space exploration will become of greater and greater importance over the centuries as humans and robots colonize the Solar System and hopefully someday the Milky Way.

The Commercial Crew Program is aiming to fund private companies to make crew vehicles that will take astronauts into space and to the ISS for NASA. The text of the petition points out why this is important. By signing it, it shows that people want commercial crew funded and demonstrates our belief that it is important to us.   And to ask why we should petition for commercial crew funding when we could just let Elon Musk figure it out demonstrates the exact opposite. It would look like no one would take the sixty seconds it takes to fill out this petition so that they could help commercial crew get the money it needs to get astronauts flying to space by 2017.

I guess we're learning some stuff about effects of space on the human body.  At an enormous money cost.  The manned space program drains money from the things we SHOULD be doing for space.  The manned space program is the wrong thing to spend on.  We need radical new propulsion technology to reduce surface-to-orbit cost by factor of 100x or something.  Space development of all kinds is limited by that.  NASA should be spending most of its money on that, and robot missions and space instruments.  We should kill NASA's manned space program until we find something worth sending humans to. Something with a big benefit, worth the big cost. We haven't found any such thing yet. Keep the unmanned program going.  Put money into robots, radically new propulsion tech, space instruments, etc.  http://www.billdietrich.me/Reason/ReasonMannedSpaceProgram.html"

Are there any specific areas of science that you find interesting and might be amazed?  Your last comment is a little off the mark. Studying crew healthcare systems, human behaviour, vision and other things like the immune system require actual humans in space. How would we have discovered that humans lose bone density in microgravity with the vomit comet? There are many, many experiments conducted on the ISS that require human presence.

And perhaps that AMAZING amount of money would have been better spent on developing new propulsion, which would benefit all space programs.  Cost to Earth orbit is the main barrier we face.

It's an expensive endeavour but spread over 13 years is a vast amount of knowledge and research that we never would have got if it wasn't for the ISS.

You can also check out the experiments Area PADLES and also PS-TEPC.   There are three launch vehicle companies that are competing to make spaceflight much more affordable than what it currently is. Two of which are private companies. Also, if you have a look here you'll see that there is a lot of research and experimentation being done and planned on the future on improving engines and fuels.

First, someone bumped a control panel during loading, accidentally hitting a switch that enabled the Soyuz hand controllers.  Then, someone else touched a hand controller, firing the thrusters.  The station was in XPOP momentum management mode at the time, so the thruster firing rolled the station unexpectedly.

On Sunday, the LightSail spacecraft, failed its first attempt at unfurling its basketball-court-sized sail, but succeeded during a small, second window of opportunity that had lower odds of succeeding.

spaceflight,38jxlu,Improvinator,6,Fri Jun 5 00:45:19 2015 UTC,"The idea is that you'd just reduce the delta-v budget, but you'd still need some propulsion for maneuvers outside of Earth orbit.  There's not a huge amount to save this way: you need to be in LEO already, which is the big cost, so it's mostly saving the delta-v needed for escape and transfer to the target, or TLI in the case of the moon."

An interesting concept I guess could be a moon based laser to launch stuff, then at various LG points, have a booster laser or something?   Just thinking out loud about something I barely comprehend."
spaceflight,38jxlu,Improvinator,2,Fri Jun 5 02:03:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've got it.  You could certainly put this on both the start and destination of a trip and use it on both ends.  Obviously that would be hard to do, but we're already talking about far-off tech.  Delta-v is just a way to talk about how much velocity is needed.  Thrust and mass work together in complicated ways, so it's most easy to talk about how much faster a spacecraft goes before and after it has fired its engines.  You can see how much delta-v it takes to get places with a delta-v map:  https://i.imgur.com/AAGJvD1.png  It takes about 10,000 m/s to get into orbit around Earth.  To get to the moon, you just need 3300, and another 2000 to slow down to the surface.  For a moon mission, this means you need about 10,000 m/s for once you're already in orbit to get to the moon and back.  Now, much of that could be eliminated with this laser technology, as it should be able to direct a craft both prograde (forward in orbit, causes you to go 'up') and retrograde.  This would translate to a much much smaller rocket needed for a lunar mission."

This means, they could be rebooted, but there's no point, and certainly no money to waste on it.

However, for a private organisation, which could crowdfund and get donated a lot of their equipment, it becomes to much cheaper. ISEE3 needed 250K usd, and did it with that. NASA couldn't have done it with that money. If they could've captured it in a geocentric orbit like was planned, it could've served them with some good science and reading still. There's plenty of ""primary mission duration ended, shut down"" crafts like that, right? Or satellites that are in a heliocentric orbit, out of our reach, and by the time they come back around, ""useless"" to agencies like NASA? They basically gave ISEE3's command away for free because they couldn't be arsed, and that was mostly in working order, save for the leaky fuel tanks, as we discovered."

Methane is, in many respects, worse than kerosene due to its low density and need to be kept cold.  It's superior Isp is pretty much cancelled out in overall performance by tankage penalties and increased engine size and weight.  That's the reason no methane fuelled rocket has yet flown into space despite it being first tested in 1930.  There aren't many better engines than the RD-180, but these days, LNG is readily available in massive quantities and cheaper than RP-1 as well as generally being better for reusable engines, although the RD-180 can be reused 10 times as it is."

The satellites are conjectured to be photo reconnaissance satellites and the program has been the subject of atypically public debates about its worthiness in the defense budget since December 2004. The estimated project costs in 2004 dollars are US$9.5 billion (inflation adjusted US$11.9 billion in 2015).

Such worlds may not be as enticing as we now imagine. While it would be nice to find life-bearing planets, gorgeous blue-green marbles with oceans and vegetation, they may be vanishingly rare. Perhaps the majority of worlds will fall into a handful of similar categories, with very few surprises — rocks, gas giants, hot Jupiters — endless reiterations of the same few themes. While this data will vastly enrich our knowledge of the surrounding cosmos, it may have a chilling effect on our aspirations. After all, why cross light years to end up at a place much the same as the one you left?"
spaceflight,36bhb2,neolefty,2,Mon May 18 08:26:22 2015 UTC,"An interesting piece. It is depressing to think that, interstellar missions will almost certainly be preceded by interstellar probes. If FTL travel does prove to be impossible, it seems that it may take hundreds of years for humanity to reach a neighboring star system. I'm thinking about the time it would take for a probe to reach a system, the time it would take for the data to reach earth at light speed, the time it would take to decide to launch a mission, and finally the time it would take for that mission to actually reach another star system.  Maybe it IS going to take an ""Interstellar"" type event, where the world is dying and we send a Hail Mary mission out into the abyss.  Caveat: I've had a little whiskey"

Probably not likely, but an amusing thought, and fitting with the pace of technological development seen in other fields in the last century."

I'm pretty sure recently though, that I read an article about how we may have already stumbled across warp technology. That got me really excited.

But the major point is that the only reason the vast distances of space are considered daunting is because of the short human life span and the dependency of life (currently) to work with organic materials.

As I understand it, the Atlas V's expense doesn't necessarily come from the RD-180, so even if the AR-1 was substantially cheaper (which I doubt) it wouldn't substantially reduce costs. If this was going into business today, that'd be alright, but come 2020, there are going to be 2 substantially cheaper options (Vulcan and Falcon 9/Heavy) both at around $100 million vs. $164 Million or so for the Atlas V. Both of which are also being targeted at a commercial clients, which means they are not solely dependent of DoD Contracts which will help keep their costs down, and it is highly unlikely that they can rely on a future block buy.   So I ask, what future for the Atlas V is there when there are cheaper, just as/even more capable options, (one of which should be thoroughly proven), that aren't reliant solely on DoD contracts?  Edit: also I can't see this thing even coming close to the commercial market, as SpaecX has really set a new bar for that, and even without that the Ariane 6 and Vulcan would be far cheaper."

In fact, that might be the preferable way of doing it because of the advantageous surface/volume ratio which simplifies thermal conditioning costs per unit of ice mass delivered to LEO. Considering that in the long run, it's the $/kg of water present in LEO that you're really interested in, the (almost complete) lack of liftoff gravity from Phobos plus your desire to do things at a really large scale means that frequent small flights might not be preferable anyway, regardless of whence the ice flies."

spaceflight,35gxzp,CuriousMetaphor,2,Sun May 10 15:23:45 2015 UTC,"According to that chart, it's 3940 m/s to LLO vs. 4270 m/s to TMI. Although the latter figure I'd take cautiously, it's launch-window-dependent, and 4270 m/s corresponds to a pretty high C3 level."
spaceflight,35gxzp,jakub_h,4,Sun May 10 15:37:46 2015 UTC,"Those numbers include the orbit insertion delta-v under the intercept, I'm not sure why.  I didn't make that chart.  This one is a little more clear.  I used a good launch window as the baseline, but <8 month Hohmann transfers vary from about 3.54 to 4.0 km/s delta-v."
spaceflight,35gxzp,CuriousMetaphor,3,Sun May 10 15:52:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm, 2033 and 2035 look very yummy! Now it's obvious why some mission plans I saw were centered around it. But apparently, even in 2016, the kind of delta V you need to reach LLO from LEO gets you to Mars in four months and a half, if I'm reading this right."
spaceflight,35gxzp,jakub_h,3,Sun May 10 16:02:13 2015 UTC,"That's right.  On some launch windows, you can get to Mars in 3.5 months for under 4 km/s.  Although you need to shave off a lot more speed at Mars in these fast transfers.  Either way, you'll need a heat shield and about 1 km/s of retropropulsion at Mars when landing."
spaceflight,35gxzp,symmetry81,3,Sun May 10 16:17:21 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, the arrival speed is really limiting at those fast transfers. Probably an even more limiting factor with our technology than the TMI propellant requirements. I hope those magnetoshell decelerators will turn out to be feasible."
spaceflight,35gxzp,joshszman09,1 point,Sun May 10 16:20:51 2015 UTC,"Aerobraking is well developed technology at this point but aerocapture, that is braking against the atmosphere to slow down enough to go into an elliptical orbit, isn't anything anyone has tried before.  The Martian atmosphere isn't static and how much you're slowed is hard to predict in advance.  You need control surfaces that will work at those speeds or a ballute you can cut free at the right time or something more exotic like a tunable magnet to push away the plasma created by your heat shield."
spaceflight,35gxzp,jakub_h,3,Sun May 10 21:05:24 2015 UTC,"Those are hohman transfers, which are the most efficient but also the slowest. We would never send people to mars on a hohman transfer, so those numbers are not comparable."
spaceflight,35gxzp,ManWhoKilledHitler,4,Sun May 10 15:42:17 2015 UTC,"So the most efficient way to get to the Moon consumes (at least) 3940 m/s, and then you stop for a refill. Or, you could have been on the way to Mars already. Perhaps with one of the new shielded Hall thrusters as a sustainer, for which you find propellant on Earth but not on the Moon (to our knowledge). Now what exactly did you buy by doing that stop is increasingly more elusive, especially if there's major extra infrastructure costs for that. And the operating headaches, oh my..."

Mars is more attractive for colonisation even if the economics are suspect, but it won't have much tourist trade."
spaceflight,35gxzp,brickmack,1 point,Mon May 11 15:07:50 2015 UTC,"Tourism, yes. If Moon is where you want to go to, then Moon it is, you go to the Moon.  But that doesn't require complex spacecraft factories on the surface of the Moon, fortunately!  (I also think that Moon actually does have potential for industrial uses, but merely delivering substantial amounts of lunar LO2 to LEO would probably be enough of a task to bite into. You'd have to beat the next generation of launchers on $/kg, though, and that won't be easy any time soon.)"
spaceflight,35gxzp,jakub_h,0,Tue May 12 08:50:43 2015 UTC,"If we build the ship there its a lot better. A small Orion sized capsule could be launched to lunar orbit on a single rocket the size of SLS, carrying a couple people for a mars mission. Build the ship in lunar orbit using components built on the surface and launched by reusable SSTOs (which are really easy to make on the moon) and rendezvous with the crew capsule. From lunar orbit to mars transfer takes only a tiny burn, so most of the fuel can be saved for mars capture and return, and only 1 giant rocket plus a handful of easily reused smaller rockets are needed, as opposed to 5-8 even more gigantic rockets"
spaceflight,35gxzp,brickmack,4,Sun May 10 16:20:29 2015 UTC,"You'd need a tremendous level of development on the Moon for this proposal to make sense. (Spacecraft components built on the Moon? As a replacement for the current well-taken-care-of and accessible clean rooms and facilities on Earth?)  Your propellant assessment also doesn't make much sense since you don't need propellant for Mars capture, and for the return trip, you can (and will!) source it locally.  You'd need hundreds of those gigantic rockets to establish the infrastructure on the Moon. Either that, or tremendous amounts of R&D to ""compactify"" those spacecraft-module-building facilities of yours to send them on several dozen fewer rockets...and those rockets will probably be cheaper anyway in twenty years. Either way, I don't see this as being cheaper in the horizon of several decades than simply sending stuff to Mars directly."
spaceflight,35gxzp,jakub_h,0,Sun May 10 16:30:14 2015 UTC,"I'm basing this off the assumption that mars would be pushed back 20 or 30 years more and we establish a large, permanent presence on the moon first.  Mars capture requires propellant unless you try to aerocapture, which just sounds like a ridiculously bad idea to me. And the return trip would probably require propellants brought from launch, since its unlikely you'll be able to carry enough back up in the lander to get back to earth"
spaceflight,35gxzp,shaysom,2,Sun May 10 17:08:56 2015 UTC,"It's not a ridiculously bad idea, it's the only reasonable way, especially for faster trajectories. And the return trip will use ISRU propellants, because that is also the only reasonable way. (There's also still the wild card of finding water inside Phobos or Deimos, but it's hardly necessary.) Launching propellant from Mars? Build a dedicated tanker! It's not that problematic, compared to the rest of the engineering. It wouldn't be that much different from a manned lander or a cargo lander. Lots of identical components. Larger fuel tank instead of a cargo bay or a cabin with seats. You've already amortized the R&D of those, so it's a small incremental cost."

Something to consider, though, is that the launch escape tower still must separate from the capsule in order for its to safely deploy its parachutes, so that is another potential point of failure in the system.   I think that the bobbing about that Dragon 2 did at apogee after separating from its trunk and during the deployment of its drogue chutes would be pretty minor from the astronauts' perspective. They just endured 6g and would be fully strapped into their launch seats/couches, and there isn't any real violence to the motion of Dragon 2 as it reorients to its natural aerodynamic preference of having its heat shield face towards the direction of travel."

spaceflight,3526kk,mutatron,3,Thu May 7 02:46:47 2015 UTC,"The aerodynamics of Dragon 2 lead it to always want to fly with its heat shield forward, so I'm not surprised that there is some wobble as it separates from the Trunk and pops its drogues. There isn't any particular violence to the reorientation, so I doubt that it would be too onerous for fully strapped in astronauts who have just escaped certain death and punched out at 6g.  Now here's an interesting thought: I wonder how a trunk laden with cargo might affect the performance of an abort?"

On the plus side, the SuperDraco engines on Dragon 2 are designed to accommodate engine out events and still accomplish the mission and this test proved that. In fact, it is my understanding that up to half(!) of the SuperDraco engines can under-perform or be out of commission entirely and still have the Dragon 2 get to a minimum safe clearance distance during a pad abort or an in-flight abort to ensure crew survival."

There's simply no way we'd have enough power generation in a small enough mass to get the kind of accelerations that would allow 40-day Mars trips, etc. However, it's a perfectly legitimate means of propulsion for low-acceleration jobs, like station keeping or high delta-v, long-duration mission profiles."

The whole proposed function of VASIMR is to bridge the gap between high efficiency electric propulsion and high thrust chemical propulsion. Which it does, if you can bring a 50 MW power generator with you (at which point it becomes just as easy to put a few dozen Hall effect thrusters on). I seem to remember a series of critiques specifically mentioning the specific power to weight ratio of electric generators in space would need to increase by a factor of a few hundred to make short duration Mars trips using VASIMR possible; something that the group developing the propulsion system does not talk about or work on.  We also have an existing, efficient, mid thrust method of thrust generation: nuclear propulsion. It's fairly cheap to develop and test, and pretty easy to implement. VASIMR is absolutely worth studying from an experimental theoretical and technical standpoint, but it isn't the short term solution to Mars propulsive needs it is often marketed as."

His second point of criticism concentrates on the lack of a suitable power source.  Ad Astra subsequently responded to the criticism in a press release: ""It is abundantly clear that the nuclear reactor technology required for such missions is not available today and major advances in reactor design and power conversion are needed"" on very fast manned transits to Mars. Zubrin's Mars Direct mission plan also calls for nuclear power reactors, though for purposes other than direct powering of propulsion, including fuel production on the surface of Mars.

However apogee height doesn't make a rocket.  its worth mentioning that SpaceX has already achieved booster relanding from SUBORBITAL launches with it's grasshopper launches and landings.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZDkItO-0a4  So a Blue Orgin landing and reuse from it's suborbital hops will not be a first.  Not from the height of the Blue Origin launch but the grasshopper flights and landings were all full launches and landing from suborbital heights ... the last ones high enough to fully exercise the engines.  What SpaceX ALSO has/ or has nearly acheived depending on how you want to look at it are multiple landings on the water from full space heights and ..more importantly... speeds.    Remember SpaceX has ALREADY sofly landed multiple first stage boosters from FULL ORBITAL BOOST BURNS  on the ocean starting in 2013.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZ33C9JZTM and http://www.space.com/23230-spacex-falcon9-reusable-rocket-milestone.html    The fact that there wasn't anything under them to hold them up when they touched down softly on the ocean doesn't change the fact that SpaceX has ALREADY fully landed first stages from orbital heights/launches.  SpaceX has done orbital first stage soft landings from space.  Now SpaceX is attempting PRECISION targeted soft landings from space to hit a tiny targeton a a ship which is a whole new set of manuverability goals and way beyond just a soft landing.  It's the difference between lofting a cannon ball in the direction of a target and launching a steerable high speed MIRV warhead with landing engine at a target.  What SpaceX is now attempting with it's ship landings is miles beyond merely soft landing from space which they HAVE ALREADY ACHEIVED. It's now PRECISION soft landing.  It's highly likely that if SpaceX had been launching from the west coast several of its earlier boosters would have been soft recovered on land on US soil.

It sounds like they had a similar problem to what SpaceX experienced on one of their launches when the hydraulic fluid ran out.   It's highly likely that if SpaceX had been launching from the west coast several of its earlier boosters would have been soft recovered on land on US soil.   No they would't.

This drive, if it works, is not only the greatest discovery for spaceflight since, well, the 19th century, but it means that our understanding of a lot of basic physics is wrong or incomplete. Since we've built quite a lot based on those theories, you'd think we'd noticed something is off before?  The results so far displayed are interesting enough to warrant further research. The most likely result is still that something is wrong about how we measure the device. However, the measurement has been now been done well enough that even if it's wrong, it's probably wrong in an interesting way.

spaceflight,34ay1c,apterium,10,Thu Apr 30 06:26:15 2015 UTC,"Relativity is based on the idea that there's no absolute velocity. There's only your velocity relative to something else (hence ""relativity""). You have an infinite number of velocities at the same time, just depending on what you compare to, and they're all equally valid. What you compare to is called the ""reference frame.""  If you can avoid violating conservation of momentum because you're pushing against the vacuum, that means the vacuum has its own momentum and hence its own velocity. Also, if you want to avoid violating conservation of energy, you have to say that the drive gets less efficient as you go faster, which also means there's absolute velocity. So now suddenly there's one reference frame which is the correct one to measure against.  The most basic assumption of relativity turns out to be false, which makes it a pretty big coincidence that atomic bombs work."
spaceflight,34ay1c,ItsAConspiracy,3,Thu Apr 30 12:10:17 2015 UTC,"Well, tweak it, sure. If the vacuum of space only interacts with a very particular kind of energy, maybe the universe remains bound by the theory of relativity. It might explain the certain anomalies that we previously couldn't account for.  I mean if we're talking about bending space time, that might not count as a framed reaction, but it's certainly a reaction we can see and measure. We know that space can be bent to extremes, so I don't see it as much of a conceptual jump to think it can be reacted with as well.   tl;dr The universe might be frame less enough to only require a slight tweak to the theory of relativity instead of a complete toss out."

So both expended energy and velocity rise linearly vs time. kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity.   So by doubling the energy you put in, you quadruple the kinetic energy out. At some point both curves cross each other and you get free energy. Suspicious no?"
spaceflight,34ay1c,wcoenen,4,Wed Apr 29 23:14:02 2015 UTC,"But the input isn't fixed, there's a limit to the acceleration a fixed power input could provide. With a power source, the drive could accelerate constantly, but the total power you've put into the system is increasing linearly as well."
spaceflight,34ay1c,wcoenen,9,Thu Apr 30 06:09:07 2015 UTC,"The total energy (not power) that is put in the system increases linearly with time. While the kinetic energy increases quadratically with time.  Let me give a concrete example. Let's say we have a 100kg probe consisting of an EM-Drive and solar panels that provide 1 kilowatt. That 1 kilowatt is used by the drive to provide 1 Newton of thrust.  This results in a constant acceleration of 0.01 m/s2 . So after x seconds, velocity will be 0.01x m/s. Kinetic energy will be 0.5 * 100kg*(0.01x m/s)2 = 0.005 x2 joules.  At 1 kilowatt fixed power input, energy put into the system is 1000x Joules after x seconds.  You can see on this graph that after 200,000 seconds (about 55 hours), the kinetic energy will be more than the energy that was put in."

The CMB rest frame would seem like a good candidate for that."

Still, we have several different hypotheses for the origin of inertia and don't know whether any of them are correct, and we don't know how to unify quantum physics and gravity, so who knows.

spaceflight,34ay1c,wcoenen,2,Thu Apr 30 15:11:32 2015 UTC,"The most similar thing would be an ion thruster, which may also provide a fixed thrust for some fixed electrical power input - but only for as long as the reaction mass lasts.  So how much kinetic energy does an ion drive gain as it accelerates? There is still the velocity squared factor, but like you say, we also need to take into account the fact that mass is expelled.  If we rewrite the rocket equation to find out the left-over mass m_1, then it turns out that this decreases exponentially with the speed gained (delta-v). For a large enough delta-V, this exponentially decreasing factor in the kinetic energy would start to dominate and kinetic energy would start to decrease.  (This is not the full story; the exhaust must also be analyzed to make the complete energy balance. But I hope this already made it clear that a normal drive with reaction mass is very different from a hypothetical reactionless drive.)"
spaceflight,34ay1c,HlynkaCG,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:09:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, mass is being expelled and or converted into energy, thus conservation is maintained."
spaceflight,34ay1c,wcoenen,2,Fri May 1 16:45:42 2015 UTC,Might it be possible that the exact numbers provide an intersection near the speed-of-light asymptote that solves this problem?
spaceflight,34ay1c,ItsAConspiracy,2,Thu Apr 30 18:42:36 2015 UTC,The numbers I used in my example are within an order of magnitude of the ones I've seen claimed for the EM drive. The cross-over point for free energy would happen long before light speed.
spaceflight,34ay1c,skerit,2,Thu Apr 30 22:25:32 2015 UTC,"Damn. This assumes, of course, that the drive is truly reactionless and it isn't pushing on something.

spaceflight,34ay1c,Luxuriousmoth1,8,Thu Apr 30 22:59:16 2015 UTC,"However that does suggest a spaceship design. Two large disks on a central axle. EmDrive thrusters on the edges make the disks counterrotate, driving a generator at the axle. Power from the generator goes to the edge thrusters, and excess goes to additional thrusters that move the ship. Assuming greater than 1g thrust we might as well streamline it for operation in atmosphere, giving it a saucer shape.  Yeeesss. Mighty suspicious indeeeed."

The simple hypothesis is that the 'quantum foam', i.e. the spontaneous creation and annihilation of particles in a vacuum that's well established, allows for this effect.  Now, this leaves a lot of open questions.  If this is occurring, then presumably those particles have more energy after the interaction, so that energy must go somewhere.  That sort of mechanistic explanation is necessary before we can say we understand something like this.  It does not, however, necessarily contradict 'everything we know about physics'.  This would simply be an extension to our understanding of some quantum behavior.    There's a lot of work to be done before this gets really interesting, but discounting it by invoking Newton isn't appropriate.  New, revolutionary things are discovered from time to time.  This criticism is far too broad."

For example, your body has mass, so it has a certain gravitational attraction to other objects of mass, but when was the last time a baseball was attracted to your hand via gravity?  I'm pretty sure it takes a whole lot of mass to make a dent in spacetime that's worth mentioning - a lot more mass than this little box contains."

The point is even just a little bit of an effect is enough, because you can turn the switch on and leave it on for a long, long time. The force keeps acting the entire time and starts to really add up to some delta-v after a while.

There have been a number of ""reactionless drives"" that have been reported in my lifetime (ie: the ""Phaser"") that were reported by researchers to produce net thrust. None of them passed the free-pendulum test to demonstrate actual thrust by physical displacement.    As I understand it, the test that ""confirmed"" the thrust of the EM drive found thrust that was MUCH lower than that originally reported and was barely above the minimum that the test was designed to measure -- that suggests the phenomenon of ""avoidance"" where positively tested effects (that aren't real) are always just at the level of detectability no matter how you test them (in other words the researchers are somehow subconsciously selecting for positive results in the noise) -- in this case, I strongly suspect that the detected thrust is an error of experimental design (ie: an interaction of the drive and measuring device) that has not been realized by the researchers.    It FEELS to me like the FTL-neutrino story of a few months ago that just turned out to be a subtle failure of the measurement procedure."

spaceflight,34ay1c,UCXC_2015,11,Thu Apr 30 01:58:16 2015 UTC,The publishing comes later. They just posted the results as they came in. The Discover article from before was criticizing the media hype and playing skeptic about the methods. This new study used more rigorous methods.
spaceflight,34ay1c,Shpasm,-6,Thu Apr 30 02:15:11 2015 UTC,"So disconnecting the drive, setting it up so it can't possibly work, and getting the same reading is just being 'skeptical' about the methods? LMAO  It criticized the media because they reported on the hype without checking the facts or even if things like 'quantum vacuum virtual plasma' actually existed."
spaceflight,34ay1c,lmxbftw,10,Thu Apr 30 02:39:42 2015 UTC,"The null device test has had a lot of misleading coverage. That was just a test of one particular hypothesis of how the device might work. The alteration would remove the thrust if the hypothesis were true, but they still measured thrust, invalidating that hypothesis. A third device was the experimental control and did not measure thrust.   I'm fairly skeptical, as you may be able to tell from my other comments, but they're not being complete idiots about the experiments."
spaceflight,34ay1c,xkcd_transcriber,11,Thu Apr 30 03:01:39 2015 UTC,"They didn't disconnect it, they just fiddled with it so they could prove or disprove the mechanism that the inventor claimed made it work. The new setup was made not so that it couldn't work, but so that it couldn't work in the way others had suggested.   The fact that it produced results anyway either meant they were measuring wrong, or that it does work, but for some unknown reason. The article you posted was right to say that the first experiment didn't prove the device worked. It didn't prove that, and skepticism was merited. But because it didn't prove that it didn't work either, future, more rigorous testing was merited. This vacuum test was the more rigorous testing.   They might still be doing something wrong, but there's something unexpected happening here. Whether it's the EM-drive actually working or the EM-drive messing with the apparatus in a weird way is still up in the air, but it isn't a simple measurement error.   Obviously, further review before publishing might still reveal issues with the study."
spaceflight,34ay1c,SBareS,-10,Thu Apr 30 02:52:08 2015 UTC,"They didn't disconnect it....   I'll give you this one. I kinda have this habit of presuming that any intelligent being would disconnect the electricity from a system before messing with it. I could be wrong though.   The new setup was made not so that it couldn't work, but so that it couldn't work in the way others had suggested   Funny, the article says ""but it worked just as well when it was intentionally disabled set up incorrectly. Somehow the NASA researchers report this as a validation, rather than invalidation, of the device."" So everyone lied about what was done. OK   The fact that it produced results anyway either meant they were measuring wrong, or that it does work, but for some unknown reason.   In the paper by White et al, they also write that the Cannae Drive “is producing a force that is not attributable to any classical electromagnetic phenomenon and therefore is potentially demonstrating an interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma. ""Quantum vacuum virtual plasma"" doesn't exist and the 'energy' reported was was an incredibly tiny effect that could very easily be just noise.  You can't get something for nothing or violate the laws of physics by making up things like 'Quantum Vacuum Virtual Plasma'."
spaceflight,34ay1c,ItsAConspiracy,14,Thu Apr 30 03:18:11 2015 UTC,"Congratulations, you've read one Discover article and you're now an expert. I'll alert the media.   Disabling the device wasn't about testing the rig in a control setting. They could do that without the machine connected at all. Disabling it was designed to prove or disprove a hypothesis about how it worked. If you think that a lizard thinks with its tail, and you cut the tail off and it moves around anyway, you've proven that your hypothesis was wrong. If the way they thought it worked was true, it shouldn't have produced energy, but it did. That doesn't necessarily disprove the test method, just the original hypothesis about the device.  I'm not trying to tell you that they've proved ""quantum vacuum plasma"" or whatever, just that they've done a new experiment that addresses the methodological criticisms your article described and seem to have found an effect anyway. That doesn't absolutely confirm anything, but it's strong evidence that there's a phenomenon here worth investigating."

But the real reason for fecal processing is to prevent false positives when looking for native Martian life.   Finding uncontaminated martian life is important to understanding how life develops and how often it emerges. For example we could examine its DNA to find out how similar it is to Earth life. If Earth and Martians are genetically similar that could be evidence that some form of panspermia took place. If the two are vastly different than that could suggest that microbial life at least is very common in the universe which makes it more likely that complex life has developed elsewhere.
spaceflight,331056,Laxziy,28,Sat Apr 18 13:47:35 2015 UTC,"Because it is one of the most fundamental questions we can ask: ""are we alone in the universe?"". Additionally we might begin to further answer the most fundamental question we have, which is ""where did we come from? "". It's possible that potential life on Mars could be related to terrestrial life, which would open up a world of scientific research if true. We want to be sure that any life we find on Mars wasn't put there by us and truly did originate before we started looking."
spaceflight,331056,DrFegelein,8,Sat Apr 18 13:45:22 2015 UTC,"Microbial life outside of our planet is especially important to Biologists. Imagine a field in science where you only have one experiment to go by... it's a mess. If (when) we find life that has began separately from us, it will advance our knowledge in biology immensely.  There's also one hypothesis (Panspermia) which suggests that life as we know it may have originated on Mars, back when it was hospitable, and big asteroid collisions flung out rocks into space (which we know can reach escape velocity) and hit Earth... Assuming that some life survived on these rocks, they may have planted life here on Earth. And it was found that Tardigrades can survive in the vacuum of space while subjected to solar radiation.  If the microbial life that we might find on Mars (assuming that it's not our own poop) have some sort of DNA similar to ours, then it might give some credit to that suggestion."

Right now we don't know if abiogenesis on Earth-like planets is a one in a quadrillion event or a one in a hundred event. Are there intelligent aliens in the universe? Did life start on Earth? Did life on Earth come from Mars? Did life on Earth come from another solar system? In what ways can we change our biochemistry and still be alive?   If we shit on life on Mars we may kill it, or make it harder to research it by contaminating it.  Everyone wants to know the answers to these questions. People who don't care about finding life on Mars are either nihilists, or more likely just ignorant of its implications."

I imagine if Mars is the second case, we'd so far have had a one in a million chance of finding it. I think most exobiologists would also agree the second case is profoundly more likely.

Your higher ups want you to design the landing craft and habitation unit to keep Mars as pristine as possible, so you can limit the error in scientific findings conducted there. I understand it must be frustrating, but that's what innovation is: overcoming insane obstacles to accomplish a goal. That's the NASA I knew when growing up. Whether or not you see it is irrelevant. You have been tasked to design it because it is important to someone somewhere who has power over this kind of stuff.   Also, let's just imagine you could do away with fecal containment. What's your plan of action? Mars isn't exactly hospitable. You can't just unzip, squat, and wipe. I think it would be best to come up with a way to build some method of containment until you can build a proper processing and recycling method. You can't exactly just keep throwing it in some hole. What happens when that fills up? I'm pretty sure most people don't want Mars to become the Earth seen in Wall-E."

Having used the name for other business ventures doesn't give him control over its use in unrelated fields.  The fact that his aerospace 'business' was only registered after ULA started suggesting they might use the name (13 April vs 26 march) puts him in a much weaker position that if that side of the company had been in operation for a while.  The fact that he didn't approach ULA when the Vulcan name was put forward would also reduce his ability to make a successful challenge to their use.  The key thing about trademarks is that it's a case of use it or lose it.  Raytheon couldn't now sue SpaceX for using the Falcon name.
spaceflight,32y0dt,Drogans,-1,Sat Apr 18 02:30:40 2015 UTC,"Having used the name for other business ventures doesn't give him control over its use in unrelated fields   You're right, trademarks don't tend to prohibit use in unrelated fields, there are notable exceptions, but they don't apply here.  This is exactly why it's going to be a very bad day for ULA.  Vulcan Aerospace is launching rockets into space.  Vulcan Aerospace is in the exact same business as ULA.     The fact that his aerospace 'business' was only registered after ULA started suggesting they might use the name (13 April vs 26 march) puts him in a much weaker position that if that side of the company had been in operation for a while.   The first to register earns the right to the trademark. 1 day earlier, 1 hour earlier, it doesn't matter.  First to the trademark office wins.  Allen was 1st to register.  In any event, it's easy to imagine that Allen's company had selected the name far earlier, but was holding back on filing in order to prevent an early release of their plans.  This is typical behavior of corporations.  If so, they would likely have documentation of these plans.  Likely even documentation from court officers while clearing the name.   The key thing about trademarks is that it's a case of use it or lose it.    Vulcan Aerospace is using it.  One imagines they'll keep using it.    ULA's laywers did a terrible job at clearing this.  Perhaps they cleared it a week before the final selection.  Whatever the reason, ULA seems bound to lose this name.    A competitor in the exact same industry beat them to the trademark office. It's not like Paul Allen can be out-lawyered or out spent.  If Allen wants this name, it is his."

Vulcan Inc have incorrectly asserted that they own all rights to the name Vulcan which is clearly untrue since plenty of other companies use it in both their name and products and have done so without challenge.   Perhaps they cleared it a week before the final selection.   There is no evidence that Vulcan Aerospace was in any way a public trademark until the day of ULA's final announcement.   It's not like Paul Allen can be out-lawyered or out spent. If Allen wants this name, it is his.   LOL.

It is enough that the their competition has named their vehicle identically to the name of a company in the exact same industry.  For instance, even though Proctor & Gamble is the corporate name of a soap making company, not the actual name of an individual soap product, no rival company could name a their soap, ""Proctor & Gamble soap"" or even ""P&G Soap"".    Vulcan Aerospace would likely argue for an outright trademark violation, not trademark dilution.     who beat them by 63 years    As you pointed out above, dead trademarks are difficult to enforce.  Who can say if BAE even filed for a US trademark, they're a British concern.  Vulcan Aerospace's wouldn't be a dead trademark, it would be as live as they get.   There is no evidence that that is the case.   What upside would there be for Vulcan Aerospace to lie about this?   The trademark office will have it online soon enough.   Vulcan Inc have incorrectly asserted that they own all rights to the name Vulcan which is clearly untrue since plenty of other companies use it in both their name and products and have done so without challenge.   It's actually the exact opposite of incorrect.    Yes, other companies in other industries use the mark.  There was no rocket company using the mark, and that means  e v e r y t h i n g.   If the law doesn't agree with him (and it's not that complex), it doesn't matter how much he spends on lawyers.   You're right, and the inverse directly impacts ULA.  If Paul Allen filed with USPTO before ULA, he wins.  All the money in Boeing and Lockheed's coffers won't change it.  My guess,  the only reason ULA has not yet backed down is because they're waiting to confirm that Allen actually beat them to USPTO, and USPTO isn't known for their speed in approvals.  Once the trademark is officially awarded to Allen's firm, ULA's smartest move would be an immediate renaming.    My guess, that's exactly what will happen."

spaceflight,32y0dt,Drogans,2,Sun Apr 19 18:09:33 2015 UTC,"It's not an exact comparison, but it's close enough.  Trademarks are commonly awarded (and upheld) for names every bit as generic as Vulcan.    While Vulcan Aerospace can not trademark Vulcan across all product lines, they can certainly trademark that name for the specific industry of orbital rockets.  For example, were there a US company named Hercules Inc. that only made hammers, they could have a fully enforceable trademark on the generic name Hercules.  This would likely only be enforceable within the hand tools industry.    Even though there are many products in unrelated industries and countless companies in unrelated industries named Hercules, within the hand tools industry, the name would be theirs.    Were a rival firm to release a hammer named ""The Hercules"",  ""Hercules Inc."" could prevent that use of their name, even though none of the ""Hercules Inc."" hammers had been named ""Hercules""."

It is enough that the their competition has named their vehicle identically to the name of a company in the exact same industry.   The law is pretty clear on it.  Vulcan Inc falsely claimed to have exclusive rights to the use of that name despite it being used by dozens of products and companies in America and elsewhere in the world.  They obviously wouldn't have a leg to stand on as far as trademark dilution is concerned, but trademark law is very clear in that use of names or other aspects of a trademark must be likely to cause confusion or mistakes by the customer, or that such use is part of a strategy to deliberately deceive.  There is absolutely no way that someone in the market for the services of Vulcan Aerospace could possibly end up buying a $100m ULA launch vehicle by mistake.  This isn't the average man in the street who might be ill-informed, it's commercial and government clients who know exactly what they're buying.  Similarly L-M couldn't take action against SpaceX for the use of the Falcon name because the Air Force isn't going to mistakenly by a rocket when they thought they were getting a plane.  The Supreme Court has also been fairly clear in deciding that plaintiffs must be able to demonstrate to have suffered or be imminently threatened with a concrete and particularized ""injury in fact"" that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.  Vulcan Aerospace couldn't possibly demonstrate damage to their ability to do business because as a new company, they have no reputation or credibility in the market that could possibly be damaged by the existence of a non-competing product that happens to share a name.   As you pointed out above, dead trademarks are difficult to enforce. Who can say if BAE even filed for a US trademark, they're a British concern. Vulcan Aerospace's wouldn't be a dead trademark, it would be as live as they get.   BAE Systems Inc is very much an American company.  The fact that they currently use product names that are even older than Vulcan such as the Typhoon fighter jet shows that their ability to do business could easily be damaged by others using names which they would benefit from bringing back."

Dilution applies when a mark is used in a non-competing market.   This is not a case of dilution.    The two companies are in the exact same market, this will be a case of outright trademark violation.  The likelihood of confusion has no place here.   Vulcan Aerospace couldn't possibly demonstrate damage to their ability to do business because as a new company   Damages won't even be taken into consideration unless ULA does something truly stupid, like ignore the ruling of the Trademark office.  If Vulcan Aerospace's application arrived first at the Trademark office, Vulcan Aerospace likely wins this.   BAE Systems Inc is very much an American company.   No, they're a British company.  They're headquartered in Britain and traded on the London exchange.  While they have a North American subsidiary, USPTO has no record of their trademark for Vulcan.  The mark was either never filed or has been abandoned.  None of this is the least bit pertinent to the present matter.  If BAE Systems wants to allege trademark violation for an aircraft that has been sidelined for 2 decades, it will be their case to bring.  A case they could bring equally against either Vulcan Aerospace or ULA.   The law is pretty clear on it.  ...to have exclusive rights to the use of that name despite it being used by dozens of products and companies in America and elsewhere in   You keep using that word.    ""Exclusive"" doesn't mean what you think it means.    Allen's firm has not claimed rights to the ""Vulcan"" mark in non-competing markets.  They've only taken issue with the mark's use by a direct competitor in exactly the same market.    When Vulcan Aerospace says ""Exclusive"" they clearly mean exclusive use within their chosen market.  Claiming to have exclusive rights does not make their claim false.  They may in fact be awarded exclusive rights to both the ""Vulcan Aerospace"" mark and the term ""Vulcan"", but only when applied to the rocket business.  We don't yet know.  There lies the heart of the matter.  Vulcan Aerospace's and ULA's contrary claims will neither be proven nor disproven until USPTO processes the applications.  This has not happened yet.  Unless you've inside information, you cannot know what you claim to know."
spaceflight,32y0dt,ManWhoKilledHitler,2,Sat Apr 18 18:15:10 2015 UTC,"Your Proctor & Gamble example was a perfect instance of where another company couldn't possibly use that name either as part of their company name, or for a product because there's no way that potential customers wouldn't confuse the two.  Proctor & Gamble has never been used except in association with the firm of that name, unlike Vulcan which started out as a Roman god and has been used in within a range of company names and for a range of products, including several within aerospace and rocketry.  Vulcan are claiming that the word itself is their trademark except that it's actually lots of people's trademarks, not just theirs.   Which is an apt argument for dilution. Dilution applies when a mark is used in a non-competing market. This is not a case of dilution. The two companies are in the exact same market, this will be a case of outright trademark violation. The likelihood of confusion has no place here.   I specifically didn't cite the law on dilution for that reason because they wouldn't have a leg to stand on.  Dilution requires your brand to be famous and have standing in the market which clearly isn't the case for a company registered less than a week ago that has achieved and sold nothing.  The Lanham Act which governs trademark law is quite clear that there needs to be the potential for confusion, mistake, or deceit, and the Supreme Court has asserted that for cases to succeed, they would expect plaintiffs to demonstrate harm done to their business.  There is no possibility of harm or confusion in this case.  Using the same name isn't enough, if there isn't potential to harm the business.  On the one had you have Vulcan Aerospace who have no track record or reputation within the space launch business and have never put anything into orbit, and on the other hand you have ULA with a product that shares a single word with a company, and not its products, who have actually done these things.  Even the notoriously litigious McDonalds haven't always been able to prevent other restaurants calling themselves McDonalds and that's a much easier situation where customer confusion is more likely.  The other thing is that ""Vulcan is a registered trademark of BAE Systems plc."" (in reference to the aircraft and from documents relating to their work on restoring a flying example), so they would seem to have a strong case against Mr Allen and his company, now that they're moving into the aerospace market and will be offering their services to international clients.   No, they're a British company.   No, BAE Systems plc is a British company.  BAE Systems Inc is its American subsidiary with an American board and run according to American law.   Allen's firm has not claimed rights to the ""Vulcan"" mark in non-competing markets. They've only taken issue with the mark's use by a direct competitor in exactly the same market.   ""Vulcan is a trademark of Vulcan Inc. and we have informed ULA of our trademark rights""  That certainly sounds like they're claiming rights to the word Vulcan in all cases where it might be used.  Note that there is no mention of its use in aerospace.  They perhaps should have said ""Vulcan is a trademark of hundreds of companies, both in the US and abroad""."
spaceflight,32y0dt,Drogans,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:55:32 2015 UTC,"Using the same name isn't enough   They're in the same industry. The potential for confusion is assumed and obvious.  If Allen reached USPTO first, it will be an open and shut case.  Regarding your other arguments, we'll have to agree to disagree.  Time will tell which of us is right.  I don't believe Vulcan Aerospace would be so brash if they didn't believe they'd beaten ULA to the Trademark office, but I do accept that this is possible.  Whichever side was 1st to USPTO is likely to push the other out of the Vulcan business.   McDonalds haven't always been able to prevent other restaurants calling themselves McDonalds    IIRC, those cases involved exception circumstances.  Restaurants either preceding the famous McDonalds, named differently, or run by owners with the surname of McDonald.    A similarly exceptional case can be found with Nissan computers.  These cases are anything but typical and would seem to have no relevance to this impending action.   The other thing is that ""Vulcan is a registered trademark of BAE Systems plc."" (in reference to the aircraft and from documents relating to their work on restoring a flying example), so they would seem to have a strong case against Mr Allen and his company, now that they're moving into the aerospace market and will be offering their services to international clients.   You conveniently ignore that BAE would have the exact same case against United Launch Alliance.    Why is that?  Do you believe BAE has a special affinity for ULA?   No, BAE Systems plc is a British company. BAE Systems Inc is its American subsidiary with an American board and run according to American law.   BAE Systems Inc is a subsidiary that is wholly owned by its British parent company.    There is no method by which anyone could discretely invest into the North American subsidiary.  It is no more a US company than Boeing Defense UK is a British company.    As I pointed out above, BAE seems to have no mark registered with USPTO.  The mark has either been abandoned or was never filed in the US to begin with.  This seems to be a complete non-issue.    Most importantly, even were BAE to take action, ULA would be just as likely to lose their naming rights as Vulcan Aerospace.   That certainly sounds like they're claiming rights to the word Vulcan in all cases where it might be used. Note that there is no mention of its use in aerospace.   Only to you does it sound like that.    Perhaps this is because you've hung your entire argument on the mistaken belief that Allen's firm has made an error so bone headed that even a 1st year law student would know better.  The mere thought that they'd attempt something so audacious nears absurdity.    Why do you believe Allen's attorneys are witless enough to make such an massive error, yet refuse to countenance the possibility that ULA's lawyers may have made a far smaller error?  ULA's lawyers may have cleared Vulcan a week prior to Allen's filing, but not again prior to their own.  As things go, a minor oversight, but one that could be quite consequential.  I have to say, your defense of ULA's every move continues to invite curiosity.    As I said above, whichever of these pair was first to file with USPTO will likely win this battle, we should know soon enough."

spaceflight,32qd36,Alidaco,24,Wed Apr 15 23:47:50 2015 UTC,"The TL;DR version is that the engine supercools air using the extremely low temperature of the liquid hydrogen fuel, then injects both the fuel and condensed air into the combustion chamber and ignites them. As the vehicle gains altitude and the atmosphere becomes thinner it gradually adds liquid oxygen from onboard until the engine is running purely on stored propellants.

spaceflight,32qd36,autowikibot,5,Thu Apr 16 00:13:29 2015 UTC,"SABRE (rocket engine):       SABRE (Synergistic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine)  is a concept under development by Reaction Engines Limited for a hypersonic precooled hybrid air breathing rocket engine.   The engine has been designed to achieve single-stage-to-orbit capability, propelling the proposed Skylon launch vehicle. SABRE is an evolution of Alan Bond's series of liquid air cycle engine (LACE) and LACE-like designs that started in the early/mid-1980s for the HOTOL project.  The design comprises a single combined cycle rocket engine with two modes of operation.  The air breathing mode combines a turbo-compressor with a lightweight air precooler positioned just behind the inlet cone. At high speeds this precooler cools the hot, ram-compressed air leading to an unusually high pressure ratio within the engine. The compressed air is subsequently fed into the rocket combustion chamber where it is ignited with stored liquid hydrogen. The high pressure ratio allows the engine to continue to provide high thrust at very high speeds and altitudes. The low temperature of the air permits light alloy construction to be employed which gives a very lightweight engine—essential for reaching orbit. In addition, unlike the LACE concept, SABRE’s precooler does not liquefy the air letting it run more efficiently.   After shutting the inlet cone off at Mach 5.14, 28.5 km altitude,  the system continues as a closed cycle high performance rocket engine burning liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen from on-board fuel tanks, potentially allowing a hybrid spaceplane concept like Skylon to reach orbital velocity after leaving the atmosphere on a steep climb.

The rocket thrust chambers in the back of nacelle need to point through the centre of mass of the vehicle so are angled down; again by 7 degrees but it is a coincidence the angle is the same.   http://web.archive.org/web/20110615125323/http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/faq.html"

Beginning his career as a signwriter, Bond formed what was to be Bond Corporation in 1959. He became a public hero in his adopted country after bankrolling challenges for the America's Cup, which resulted in his selection in 1978 as Australian of the Year  (awarded jointly with Galarrwuy Yunupingu). His Australia II syndicate won the 1983 America's Cup, which had been held by the New York Yacht Club since 1851, thus breaking the longest winning streak in the history of sport.  In 1992, Bond was declared bankrupt with personal debts totalling A$1.8 billion. He was subsequently convicted of fraud and imprisoned after pleading guilty to using his controlling interest in Bell Resources to deceptively siphon off A$1.2 billion into the coffers of Bond Corporation. The funds were used to shore up the cash resources of the ailing Bond Corporation, which spectacularly collapsed, leaving Bell Resources in a precarious situation. Following release, he became active in various mining investments, predominately in Africa, including Madagascar Oil PLC and Global Diamond Resources, and was included in Business Review Weekly's ""Rich 200 List"" in 2008.

Interesting, and I think this should make Europe even more worried than before. But not as game changing as they are trying to paint it as (at least that is how I feel).   How will it compare to the Falcon 9/Heavy?: That will depend on how much cheaper reusability / Partial reusability will make the rockets and how capable a partially reusable Falcon Heavy will be. I think, for a short time at least, that the analogy of a new entrant pushing established companies further up the tree will be literal. ULA will dominate most things beyond LEO, but SpaceX will pretty much own the LEO and light GTO market if they can nail down partial reusability and if they can be more reliable with their scheduling. If they push reusability further, and/or develop a Space Tug of some description, then the ULA could be screwed.   ULA really only seems to be paying lip service to reusablity at this point as well, aren't they targeting their engine capture in the mid 20's? By then SpaceX will probably have the 1st stage reusable, and be fairly far along with developing their next rocket, raising the bar further. Though I wonder if ULA could short cut by adding landing rockets to the SRB hard points, they seem to be symmetrical, and doing a boost back/ reentry burn with the BE-4's throttled down, then landing with the side mounted rockets.

Fine. But that is completely tactical, and here's why.  If we look at the bigger task of reducing the costs of access to space, or at least the task of competition with SpaceX, NGLS is a major flop. The price reductions are very small, less than an order of magniture. This is not enough. Not even close. We need at least a 100 times decrease.  Of course if you compare with other mediocre competitiors, such as Ariane 6 or H-3, NGLS is great. It solves a major problem of dependency on Russian engines.

Of course the usefulness of these comparisons is somewhat limited  without knowing Vulcan's payload capacity."

If ULA can get Vulcan to come in at below $100 million, at least for the basic models, they should have a good chance of competing."
spaceflight,32m9fp,ManWhoKilledHitler,2,Fri Apr 17 13:09:09 2015 UTC,Do you think there's anything new in the Falcon 9?  It's engine design dates from the 1950s but it works and is thoroughly tested.  You don't want to be using radically new technologies if cost and reliability are your main concern.  Being revolutionary is what gave us the Space Shuttle with its launch costs two orders of magnitude higher than NASA claimed it would have.
spaceflight,32m9fp,zaitcev,3,Thu Apr 16 12:16:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you missed the point so badly, but let me explain. The neweness in my comment related to the course charted by ULA, not to the relative age of various technologies. Of course the IVF is an amazing new technology that nobody else has even close and it is crucial for the in-space operations. Imagine how much cutting down on number of stored components helps a depot. However, as far as NGLS goes as a whole, it is basically the same rocket that would've come out if they wanted to build Atlas 6. It promises to become an excellent expendable with a token gesture towards reusability. What difference does it make if it's built with the newest and shiniest technologies?"
spaceflight,32m9fp,dorylinus,-6,Thu Apr 16 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, ULA is just starting to sound desperate. The ""catch it in midair with a helicopter"" strategy is very limited in the mass that can be handled, as well as be dangerous and extremely difficult.

spaceflight,32m9fp,yuuray,10,Tue Apr 14 23:03:44 2015 UTC,"If SpaceX can learn to retrieve a complete first stage through retro propulsion, why can't ULA learn to catch a pair of engines on descent? I have no idea how those things compare in difficulty and viability, but to me it looks like they're trying to innovate (call it desperation if you want), and whether it fails or succeeds, something good is bound to come from that."

spaceflight,32m9fp,zardwiz,4,Tue Apr 14 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"Which doesn't make it less limited in the mass that can be handled.  The Sikorsky CH-53E can carry external slung loads of 36,000 pounds, or 18 tons.  Not a physicist, but I know that the downward force exerted by grabbing something in motion is significantly higher than the force exerted by just having it hang underneath the aircraft.  Even if we assume that the stage can perfectly stabilize itself in midair, the RD-180 alone has a dry weight of six tons - that's without anything attached to it.  Someone else can do the math to convert that weight into force, but any non-trivial motion of the object being caught in midair would likely overwhelm the aircraft from what I can tell.  Rather more significant forces acting on it than a film capsule.  Each KH-7 weighed about 2kg in its entirety, it appears.  Anyone here who can do the math is welcome to tell me I'm wrong - I may well be - but it sounds rather unlikely to work reliably at a glance."
spaceflight,32m9fp,ManWhoKilledHitler,9,Wed Apr 15 00:15:11 2015 UTC,"The RD-180 is also a relatively heavy engine so it will be interesting to see if a pair of BE-4s end up weighing less.  Add in the rest of the structure and it's going to be a sizeable weight to catch but I tend to think they've considered the challenges before deciding to use this particular method.  It won't be easy but as we've seen again, propulsive landings are pretty tricky as well."
spaceflight,32m9fp,zardwiz,2,Wed Apr 15 00:17:51 2015 UTC,"That they are.  On the other hand, the risk to life and property is somewhat lower with landing on the barge than when you involve a helicopter.  That, of course, changes when they move to landing on actual land."

Correct, but the recoverable engine section is under gliding under parachute at that point. It will be travelling quite slowly. Mass-wise this should not be an issue.  It's a pretty impressive feat if they can pull this off.   And makes sense from a financial standpoint to recover the expensive and light parts rather than the heavy and not so expensive parts.  Good idea that makes sense on paper, let's see if it works in practice."
spaceflight,32m9fp,zardwiz,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:22:10 2015 UTC,"So with the parachute involved, we can treat the mass as just mass, and (mostly) ignore force in this context?  That makes it sound more practical, though still quite an accomplishment if they pull it off."

But it's also my opinion that there's some merit to OP's criticism towards ULA, considering that both CNES/Arianespace and Energomash have already announced their plans for reusability a while ago.  This announcement especially contrasts with ULA's earlier strategic vision on EELV vs. reusability under Gass just over a year ago, when Gass fought tooth and nail against SpaceX's vision on reusability. As far as I can tell, Bruno is the one who reevaluated and redirected ULA's stance towards reusability.  I agree with OP that this strategy change is somewhat ""desparate"" and last to the party, though I also applaud ULA's change of heart. It sounds like a complex architecture (of which certain aspects I definitely don't like), but I hope they pull it off."
spaceflight,32m9fp,ManWhoKilledHitler,3,Wed Apr 15 12:00:49 2015 UTC,ULA have studied reusability for a while and were apparently proposing a similar upgrade for the current Atlas V several years ago.  I suspect the problem is that both they and their customers had achieved a comfortable situation where there was very little demand for innovation.  There have been a number of very detailed engineering studies by ULA into how their launchers could be improved but I can only assume that they met with little or no interest from the DoD.

They are going to develop a new Methalox engine similiar to the Raptor. And the relatively same (quoted) price for Falcon Heavy.  On top of that, they opted for a heavy lifter configuration, competing with the super-heavy SLS. Although I'm not sure if NASA would do commercial missions.

[EDIT: BTW, it's about 55% of the cost in ULA's case, if we can trust ULA's own infographics, and the savings will be further reduced slightly by the costs for reintegration. So you're saving about 50% of the first stage. Now combine this with the significantly higher costs of the ULA upper stages and it becomes quite clear that ULA will save much less money relative to the cost of the rocket than SpaceX, so that's certainly not the thing that could be labeled as comparable.]   And the relatively same (quoted) price for Falcon Heavy.   Quoted now. Also, price and cost are different things. I'm pretty sure that triple-recovery Falcon Heavy will not cost $90M. That's just a momentarily competitive price quote. From what I can tell, your ""relatively same"" basically means ""we'll be only 50% more expensive that you are today, ten years from now...if everything goes right"" or something like that.

It means that gopro got lucky it didn't happen to get hit by a cosmic ray in just the right way to knock it out, and when a rocket launch costs a hundred million dollars it makes sense to spend the effort to design the hardware that's riding on that hundred million dollar rocket launch to be as reliable as possible under the conditions of space."

spaceflight,324vu7,arkofcovenant,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:55:56 2015 UTC,"That's basically what the space shuttle does, minus the 3D printing. I think your biggest penalty to this is the mass of the wings, which you will have if you launch with them or build them en route. I would guess that the drag penalty during launch is relatively minor compared to that, but I'm not totally sure.   One of the main challenges in returning from space is that you have to slow down from orbital velocity. The space shuttle accomplished this by aerodynamic forces (drag) over a long period. This method is much harder on Mars because there is a lot less atmosphere, though it can be done, depending on a lot of things."

Without doing any math, at 0.9 c you shouldn't be able to see anything -- apart from radiant propulsion (say, stellar-source beams for gray sail propulsion), should you happen to look along the axis.  Subjective travel time in absence of relativistic time slowdown is irrelevant, since the craft is so small it has to be all solid state, and hence dormant or slowed down so that subjective travel time is zero or at least comfortable."

Among other things, on Cape Canaveral they can make a lot of noise, run around waving guns, and not bother anyone.  Some years ago such a unit secured permission to use a complex on the Cape for a typical exercise. But then, once underway, they decided to expand their exercise outside of the complex. And then they encountered a real, non-simulated, non-exercise spacecraft enroute to its launch pad and decided it would be fun to further expand their exercise and capture it.

They simply require less energy than a direct transfer burn.  Also claiming that they ""don't work"" is silly, since they work and are actually used in real-life missions (eg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART-1 ).  Author claims that it's pointless since oberth effect can give us more gain during a capture, but he forgets that there are more and more spacecrafts with electric propulsion that can't benefit much from oberth effect and that can't do an easy capture burn."
spaceflight,31p418,Pharisaeus,6,Tue Apr 7 07:18:07 2015 UTC,"he forgets that there are more and more spacecrafts with electric propulsion that can't benefit much from oberth effect and that can't do an easy capture burn.   Those would be spacecraft that are ill-suited to these kinds of missions then.  You cant just handwave criticisms of an inefficient + horribly slow process by slapping a ion-drive on everything, because net delta-v isnt the be-all-end-all of spaceflight.  At some point you just need to build a bigger probe and stop crying about the oppressive cost and tyranny of the rocket equation."
spaceflight,31p418,T-Husky,6,Tue Apr 7 09:33:20 2015 UTC,"I can't see why. If you can wait few weeks / months more and it will save you half the costs (10 times less fuel -> much lighter spacecraft -> much smaller launcher) then why not do it? Especially if you are cost-constrained.  There is always a trade-off of some sort. Low energy transfer idea was prepared exactly for those low-thrust probes and it works for them very well.  According to your logic we should also dismiss gravity assists since they take so much time and impose a very precise timing for the mission, make it much more complicated. We should just ""stop crying"" and ""build a bigger ship"" with enough delta-v to make a direct transfer, right? You know very well that it doesn't work like this ;)"
spaceflight,31p418,Pharisaeus,2,Tue Apr 7 11:29:30 2015 UTC,"For very low thrust ion engines, the transfer path is a spiral rather than an ellipse.  The general rule for gradual ion engine spirals is the difference in speeds between the departure and destination orbits.  These paths take more delta V than a Hohmann.  In the case of ion engines the energy can come from solar panels. And due to higher exhaust velocity, the mass fraction is nicer.  But low thrust ion spirals are not low energy WSBs."
spaceflight,31p418,HopDavid,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:56:04 2015 UTC,"It's true that generally low thrust transfer costs more delta-v, but keep in mind that hydrazine-like propellant has ISP of 250 seconds and average ion thruster has 5000 seconds (not to mention prototypes like DS4G with almost 20000 seconds). This means it uses 20 times less fuel. And low thrust burns generally don't cost more than twice as much as hohman, which still gives us 10 times less fuel to carry.  Also you generally don't perform all the burns with ion thrusters. On the contrary - ejection burn or at least most of it is performed by the launcher. Once you're in high sun orbit your orbit time is very long, so you can do a hohman-like transfer burn even with low thrust, without the need of spiraling.  The problem with ion thrusters is that you can't make an easy capture burn with them, because you can't deliver so much delta-v in a short time. This is why low energy transfer is a better option for such probe - you have much more time to thrust and you have much less delta-v to deliver."
spaceflight,31p418,Pharisaeus,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:33:13 2015 UTC,"You've completely missed my point. I'll say it again.  Low thrust ion spirals are not low energy WSBs.  Yes, long burns with higher exhaust velocities take less reaction mass. Thank you for stating the obvious.  Does it follow that ion spirals are low energy paths along weak stability boundaries? Well, that is only obvious to those willing to conflate wildly different trajectories."
spaceflight,31p418,HopDavid,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:47:13 2015 UTC,"Sadly you don't read my comments :( I know what low energy transfers are and what they aren't. I also know what trajectory ion thrusters make. However you are the only one missing the point.   Ion spirals are a valid term only when you are close to a planet / moon, or otherwise when your orbit is short. If you escape earth SOI your orbit time is 1 year, and thus even thrusting for a week counts as ""impulse burn"", because it's just a small fraction of whole orbital period. But this is irrelevant right now :) Ballistic capture still requires certain capture burns. In the example you brought it was 0.7 km/s for Mars transfer. However unlike with a hohman transfer, you have a very long time to perform this burn, which is perfect news for low thrust engines.   My point is that you can't perform a capture burn with a probe with ion thrusters with a hohman transfer because you will simply run out of time. And no oberth effect will help here. You will have most likely few hours and it won't be enough.  However, if you follow a weak stability boundary trajectory you will have much more time to fine-tune your orbital insertion. And also the final capture burn will be much smaller. Perfect conditions for electric propulsion."
spaceflight,31p418,Pharisaeus,2,Tue Apr 7 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"I did misread your comments, sorry.  If you're saying there's a WSB from SML1 to a location just below Mars orbit, I would agree.  You're correct that ion engines confer more of an impulsive burn when angular velocity is around 1º per day (heliocentric at 1 AU) vs 4º per minute (LEO).  Your no-Oberth-benefit scenario seems to assume the ship's already spiraled from LEO to C3 = 0. We're going from the edge of one Hill Sphere to another?  Well then, the Hohmann delta V changes. Instead of an ellipse between earth and Mars it's between SEL2 and SML1. 1.01 x 1.51 AU rather than a 1 x 1.52 AU ellipse. Aphelion of this Hohmann transfer is a little faster,  perihelion a little slower.   Also remember the Lagrange necks travel at the same angular velocity about the sun as the Hill Sphere centers. So SEL2 is traveling about 101% of earth's speed and SML2 is traveling about 99.6% of Mars speed.  Going from this Hohmann's aphelion to SML1 takes about 2.4 km/s.  So now Belbruno's 2 km/s capture burn seems to be a .4 km/s improvement rather than .7 km/s  Is a .4 km/s advantage worth another year added to the trip time?  If memory serves Hall thruster's exhaust velocity is around 30 km/s. e2.4/30 - 1 = .083. e2/30 - 1 = .069  So given a 100 tonne payload, we're talking about 8.3 tonnes of xenon vs 6.9 tonnes. 108.3/106.9 = 1.0134. So with an extra year of trip time we get about a 1% improvement in GLOW.  I will say it again: Pop wisdom greatly exaggerates the benefits of these so-called superhighways."
spaceflight,31p418,HopDavid,2,Wed Apr 8 16:38:21 2015 UTC,"Nice case-study :) However you forgot about one important thing - time of the burn. In terms of the Hohmann transfer you need to deliver this 2.4 km/s in relatively short time - when you are doing a close Mars flyby. In case of ballistic capture you are going ""alongside"" Mars for a long time, at which you can already work on matching the orbits.  I totally agree that it's an exaggeration to call this a ""highway"" or a ""fast interplanetary travel"", nevertheless saying it ""doesn't work"" is just as wrong :)"

I'm going to copy and paste some of my arguments from this thread.  Regarding time of burn, I'll quote you from upthread ""so you can do a hohman-like transfer burn even with low thrust, without the need of spiraling"".  If the thrust is up to doing an impulsive burn for TMI from the 1 AU neighborhood, the same is true of the rendezvous burn at aphelion. Even more so. While a 1 A.U. orbits moves ~1º/day, a 1.52 A.U. orbit moves a little more than .5º/day. The pace at Mars heliocentric orbit is even more leisurely than earth heliocentric."

I pointed out in the case of Belbruno's paper that the .7 km/s savings are less than the 2 km/s delta V savings that can be realized with the Oberth benefit.  There are plenty of people who believe there are very long routes from one planet to another that take virtually zero energy. Drake and friends haven't said as much explicitly. But evidently their graphics and explanations are easily misinterpreted. And I haven't seen much effort on their part to correct this misconception.

Oberth effect, as you very well know, can be applied only if you have a high thrust engine which can perform capture burn in very short time. And this is not always the case.  Well obviously low energy transfer will not be much cheaper, since you need a high elliptical orbit in the first place. So in reality, the first burn might cost even more than it would for a simple transfer orbit. You ""save"" only on the capture, but again not so much. If this was your point, then I'm sorry, but the article sounded differently."

This means that his books are readily available and accessible to people who do not have the background required to understand the math or physics. As a result, they misinterpret it and go on forums espousing this 'low energy superhighway' stuff without understanding its use cases and limitations, nor when other solutions (such as the aforementioned Oberth effect) are superior."

It is sort of a reverse bi-elliptic path where the apogee goes beyond earth's Hill Sphere and the sun's influence lowers perigee of the second ellipse.  And I'm fairly confident this is reversible. If the timing is correct I believe we could luanch to an 1,800,000 km apogee and let the sun's influence raise the perigee so the ship slides right into EML2. The total delta V for this three month trip from LEO to EML2 would be about 3.2 km/s  Which is about a .3 km/s advantage over Farquhar's 3.5 km/s 9 day route from LEO to EML2."

spaceflight,31p418,bea_bear,2,Tue Apr 7 04:24:35 2015 UTC,There is a slow way to get durable commodities to Mars: An ion engine with high exhaust velocity but low thrust. With very low thrust the trajectory might be a spiral from earth to Mars instead of a Hohmann ellipse.  It still takes about 5 or 6 km/s delta V to get from Earth's Hill Sphere to Mars' Hill Sphere. Payload mass fraction could be higher due an ion engine's higher exhaust velocity.  But this certainly isn't a zero energy pathway along WSBs.

spaceflight,31j5t1,megachirops95,7,Mon Apr 6 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"We could do that now, we would just need to send a smaller payload or use more fuel.  The New Horizons spacecraft passed Mars's orbit less than 3 months after it was launched.  That's the fundamental choice here.  With any rocket propulsion technology, you can shorten trip times by lowering the payload ratio (either using more fuel for the same mass, or sending less mass for the same fuel).  It comes down to whether you want to send 100 tons to Mars in 6 months, or 50 tons to Mars in 3 months, using the same rocket.  I would say it's almost always better to send more mass."

The neat thing about the [VASIMR engine]( is that it has dual modes that can be used for short bursts of high impulse or long burns of extremely high efficiency... in the same engine.  It is a bit different from the ion propulsion that is being used on the Dawn spacecraft, assuming that is the ion propulsion engine you were thinking of.  Still, this is a similar general concept so far as ionizing some sort of plasma to extremely hot temperatures and achieving extremely high specific impulse.  Rather than just being some random thought experiment and power point presentation, these guys have ""bent metal"" and working prototypes running on test stands.

spaceflight,31j5t1,DrFegelein,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:03:50 2015 UTC,"The article mentions the need for a 1000 W/kg nuclear reactor. We're currently approaching something like 400 W/kg with just solar panels. So at least for LEO escape to Mars or the outer solar system (which is really the interesting part of the performance improvements offered, since most mass in interplanetary missions will have to be hauled away from Earth rather than towards it), this is almost like a non-issue.  For a large LEO-escape tug, there's also the option of power amplification by using ground-based lasers, which would be comparatively cheap and very beneficial. (In fact, the larger the panels would be, the cheaper the ground unit optics could be as well, so there are some interesting tradeoffs with respect to scalability, and I feel quite optimistic about it.)"

Doesn't take a super competent aerospace engineer to understand these arguments.  Given that best current alphas are around 300 electric watts /kg, I think a bright 8th grader could see that the need for a 2000 electric watts /kg power source is a show stopper.

And resupply craft are always well under their payload limit. For example, Dragon can bring up 3310 kg to ISS, but the most payload its actually carried so far was 2317 kg on CRS-5.

spaceflight,31d03e,hapaxLegomina,39,Fri Apr 3 22:43:33 2015 UTC,To expand on this comment the vestibule is the space between the hatch on the ISS and the hatch on the Soyuz.  The leak test consists of letting some air into the vestibule and then sealing it off to see how fast the air leaks out of the seal between the Soyuz and ISS.  Since the Soyuz will be docked for 5.5 months even a very slow leak will drain the station of a substantial quantity of air.  Some leakage is allowable but the acceptable rate is so low that it takes a long leak check to measure it.
spaceflight,31d03e,Neptune_ABC,7,Sat Apr 4 00:46:55 2015 UTC,But aren't they going to need to bring them into the ISS anyway? Why not let them in an then do that check?
spaceflight,31d03e,spinney,14,Sat Apr 4 03:34:57 2015 UTC,"In general if their is an air leak you want to be in a vehicle that is equipped to land.  There is really no point to letting the astronauts in and then doing the leak check, because if something goes wrong you are trapped outside your capsule."
spaceflight,31d03e,sunfishtommy,5,Sat Apr 4 03:48:32 2015 UTC,Ah ok yea that makes sense. I'm not sure if it's ever happened but suppose there was an airleak would they simply send them back down immediately?
spaceflight,31d03e,spinney,10,Sat Apr 4 04:00:11 2015 UTC,"Not immediately, but astronauts have been evacuated to the Soyuze capsules during problems or high risk times.  Usually they are evacuated to Soyuze and then they wait for further info and directions from the ground.  In Soyuze they are pretty safe, because the capsules are capable of providing life support to the astronauts, and landing capabilities if that becomes necessary.  No sense being hasty and landing all the astronauts when the problem is small and can be easily fixed.    I just realized your question was about air leaks immediately after docking.  I suppose it matters how bad the air leak is, and what is causing it.  It might just be the seal didn't line up very well during docking, in this case just dock again and see if the seal is better.  On the other hand if there is a physical defect in the rubber seal that can not be fixed, I suppose NASA would be left with no options but to land.  In the mean time Soyuze has enough resources to sustain the three people in the capsule for at least a few days it is likely that NASA would use at least a couple days to work on a solution before sending Soyuze back to earth."
spaceflight,31d03e,sunfishtommy,2,Sat Apr 4 05:03:10 2015 UTC,"And i'm sure there is a further grey zone is that type of situation where they could open the hatch for a short time to transfer supplies and even refresh life support.   I mean, you could open the hatch, move the crew and what limited cargo went up with them, and simply close the hatch back up while you worked the problem. You don't want to give up on a ~$150 million mission unless all alternatives have been exhausted."
spaceflight,31d03e,faizimam,2,Sat Apr 4 07:18:24 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but I think that they want to keep the hatch open so the crew can enter it quickly in an emergency.  But who knows what they would do."

The ISS electrical system uses solar cells to directly convert sunlight to electricity. Large numbers of cells are assembled in arrays to produce high power levels. This method of harnessing solar power is called photovoltaics.  The process of collecting sunlight, converting it to electricity, and managing and distributing this electricity builds up excess heat that can damage spacecraft equipment. This heat must be eliminated for reliable operation of the space station in orbit. The ISS power system uses radiators to dissipate the heat away from the spacecraft.

NASA wants vehicles that will be safe above all else, and the Air Force wants vehicles that will be reliable, and never change. This forces designers looking to capitalize on these markets (which far outstripped private launches when comparable rockets were originally designed, which was also a time when private launches were expected to be just as costly as government ones) to build their rockets to high margins, with a large number of costly safety systems, and to not change those designs after a few flights. It's odd to me that Elon didn't realize this was the major reason for the high costs of domestic launch vehicles. Or maybe he did, and just thought the Air Force and NASA were logical organizations which would switch to his side as soon as they saw a functioning rocket, and accept risk for cost savings."

I find it quite plausible that he didn't realize the amount of extra paperwork costs involved, but SpaceX isn't a 100%-government-dependent outlet anyway, so it's not an extra cost of the launch vehicle itself but rather a simple nuisance for the occasional DoD mission.

There was one failure due to operation outside of the environmental margins, and one due to an impact from foam (something which necessitated the creation of novel analytical methods to even analyze).

spaceflight,311izh,jakub_h,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"It's not surprising there was inherent risk in building a space shuttle, especially since no one had ever built one before. Saying that it's due to luck that none were lost is a major disservice to the men and women who designed, built, and flew the vehicle.  The first four test flights were racked with technical difficulties and problems. The first spacewalk was cancelled due to an electrical malfunction in one of the suits. The first landings were made on a dry lake bed, because they weren't sure the orbiter could make a runway landing. The first flight saw both astronauts (including veteran John Young) become dehydrated and sleep deprived during the critical landing phase. The first launch saw damage to the orbiter attach struts, which experienced higher than expected loads. The point is, it was an experimental system, and NASA was experimenting with the vehicle, it's capabilities, and it's engineering in order to improve those safety margins. At the turn of every problem, the health of the vehicle and risk to the crew was assessed, and remarkable measures put in place to ensure there was as little risk as possible.   As an example, when the crew of STS-1 reached orbit and saw tiles missing from the forward portions of the OMS pods, there was concern on the ground that there was a possibility of the loss of tiles from the heatshield. After much debate, Gene Kranz (of Apollo fame) informed everyone throughout mission control that they didn't need to worry about heatshield tile loss. NRO satellites on orbit were capable of photographing the base of the Shuttle after launch, though this wasn't made public knowledge at the time.  Most of NASA's safety pushes are easy to see. The vehicle was redundant on every flight critical hardware system, and every system was thoroughly checked before and after each flight. Loss of redundancy (not loss of function) was enough reason to ground several flights. And the vehicle was built to be fault tolerant in any single flight critical system. It's not often remembered that the vehicle was capable (and was, for one flight) flown through re-entry to landing entirely by the commander, with no flight computer. Or that it had cross range capabilities to fly a polar orbit (an Air Force requirement for the vehicle). It was a remarkably adept, and yes, dangerous system, which is why NASA is so driven to safety in everything that they do."

spaceflight,30xlot,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:27:32 2015 UTC,"Spacecraft thermal control:       In spacecraft design, the thermal control system (TCS) has the function to keep all the spacecraft parts within acceptable temperature ranges during all mission phases, withstanding the external environment, which can vary in a wide range as the spacecraft is exposed to deep space or to solar or planetary flux, and rejecting to space the internal heat dissipation of the spacecraft itself.  The thermal control is essential to guarantee the optimum performance and success of the mission, because if a component encounters a temperature which is too high or too low, it could be damaged or its performance could be severely affected. Thermal control is also necessary to keep specific components (such as optical sensors, atomic clocks, etc.) within a specified temperature stability requirement, to ensure that they perform as efficiently as possible.  The thermal control subsystem can be composed both of passive and of active items and works in two ways:   protects the equipment from too hot temperatures, either by thermal insulation from external heat fluxes (such as the Sun or the planetary infrared and albedo flux), or by proper heat removal from internal sources (such as the heat dissipated by the internal electronic equipment). protects the equipment from too cold temperatures, by thermal insulation from external sinks, by enhanced heat absorption from external sources, or by heat release from internal sources.   Passive Thermal Control System (PTCS) items include:   multi-layer insulation (MLI), which protects the spacecraft from excessive solar or planetary heating as well as from excessive cooling when exposed to deep space coatings that change the thermo-optical properties of external surfaces thermal fillers to improve the thermal coupling at selected interfaces (for instance on the thermal path between an electronic unit and its radiator) thermal washers to reduce the thermal coupling at selected interfaces thermal doublers to spread on the radiator surface the heat dissipated by equipment mirrors (secondary surface mirrors, SSM, or optical solar reflectors, OSR) to improve the heat rejection capability of the external radiators and at the same time to reduce the absorption of external solar fluxes radioisotope heater units (RHU), used by some planetary and exploratory missions to produce and store electrical power for TCS purposes   Active Thermal Control System (ATCS) items include:   thermostatically controlled resistive electric heaters to keep the equipment temperature above its lower limit during the mission cold phases fluid loops to transfer the heat dissipated by equipment to the radiators. They can be: single-phase loops, controlled by a pump two-phase loops, composed of heat pipes (HP), loop heat pipes (LHP) or capillary pumped loops (CPL) louvers (which change the heat rejection capability to space as a function of temperature) thermoelectric coolers      Interesting: Heat pipe | Türksat 6A | Robotic spacecraft | Wright Brothers Medal   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Isn't that attributable to either/both of   i) the larger pressure head that the heart would have to overcome in someone who is tall and lanky?  ii) the greater vascular volume (in absolute terms) below the heart than above it, in someone who's tall. This would imply more blood could pool lower, leaving someone light-headed, until more water is absorbed into the  blood vessels. (Presuming that the heart doesn't scale in size as fast as the rest of the body does... and therefore the ventricular ejection amount doesn't increase as fast as the extra volume).  Think of both those conditions in the context of reduced gravity induced reduction in blood volume. (Zero g implies blood collects in the upper parts of the body... exerting more pressure on the vessels. Water volume is lost, as the higher pressure leads to an efflux of water, and eventually its excretion).  When they return to 1g, they would have to tackle hypovolemia.  This is why they fluid load, and drink loads of juice. (The hypertonicity of the imbibed fluid helps draw water from cells etc. into the blood-stream, I presume... IF the sugars/solutes are digested and find their way into the blood in the first place. If they don't and if they remain in the alimentary canal, it would be counter-productive).

In that scenario, it was a 5-segment SRB so it was a much bigger rocket to begin with and they've maybe looked at a comparable failure in a GEM 60 and conclude that it's survivable.  Or perhaps not!"
spaceflight,30r2n3,ManWhoKilledHitler,1 point,Tue Mar 31 12:26:40 2015 UTC,"Well, survivability depends largely on the spacecraft's LES. Like I said above, for DreamChaser a GEM rupture presumably wouldn't be an issue because the vehicle would be gliding after reaching its apogee. Additionally, since it doesn't use parachutes it would (due to the smaller size) be less likely to encounter burning chunks of fuel, and (because it's not using fabric) less likely to suffer a catastrophic failure if it did."

The point is that the infrastructure that exists there is not about to go derelict, by any means.

The only thing you lose is ~15 tonnes (or so) of downmass, which, frankly, has been used so seldom that paying for it on all the other flights was hardly worth it.  The primary mission of the Shuttle was to squeeze the cost of space access for all kinds of payloads way lower. Consequently, the opposite having happened was Shuttle's primary failure. The kind of delusional thinking that makes some people involved and emotionally invested in the STS program engage in self-deception is not surprising, but at the same time, it doesn't make it any less irrational."

Within 2 decades of the first space probes that just barely got into space, we made a spacecraft that was capable of visiting almost every planet in the solar system and escaping the sun.   I think with the current drive towards commercial space flight, within 50 years we could have vastly superior spacecraft technology to what we currently have. Voyager left the solar system using basic chemical based technology and gravity assists. Imagine if we made something like that in 20 years with VASIMR or ion propulsion. We could cut in half (or even more) the 40,000 years it would take Voyager to reach the nearest star, with technology that is available now.

The moon is a fairly easy target, seeing as they only needed life support for a few days, and were  still fairly close to the sun. Sending a voyager probe out, or sending man to the moon, are both bone head simple missions compared to a manned flight outside the solar system. Where are we getting power? We don't even have hints of minutely efficient fusion, RTGs  could be an option, but the amount of rad shielding you'd need is tremendous. Plus, how are you even going to build the ship? It can't take off from the ground, so we're either going to have to build it in pieces and assemble on orbit, which leads to a fantastically weak structure, or build it on a base someplace else, which in and of itself is 50 years away at best. There's no worldwide drive to go anywhere right now, which makes me really sad, because I can't imagine anything more exciting than helping design the fist extrasolar space vehicle, but I can't imagine a scenario, even if we need to leave the planet in 100 years, where we can actually do it.

spaceflight,30k36m,silencesc,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:55:25 2015 UTC,"I think you're absolutely right. There is no scenario where we go to other star systems without the ability to create very large ships in space, from resources gathered in space. That will only happen once there is a very large, beyond LEO, space-based economy. That in turn requires a large in-LEO economy to even start to happen. And THAT will only happen once launch costs become far lower than they are today, and someone (looking at you and your satellites Elon) develops a very profitable reason to exploit those lower launch costs.  So we are many, many steps away from where we would need to be. I think we will actually get there in time. But it's really important to think about what other changes will happen on the same time scale. Advances in computing eventually leading to AI, and sophisticated synthetic biology are likely to happen on the same time scale. So by the time we can send significant mass to other stars, the definition of 'we' may well have changed substantially."

If we did find some propulsion method that vastly outperforms what we had when we launched, we could build a module around it and send it out to rendezvous with the generational ship. If the new propulsion method needs to be incorporated into the design of the entire ship, you just send out a new ship, rendezvous, and transfer all the people over. Both require the use of more resources, but the added cost would be stretched over many years, and there's definitely a benefit to getting people off Earth earlier."

It's like this: you go to warp, move about 5 lightyears, then turn around and launch a bomb also warp-capable to where you were.

spaceflight,30iz74,ManWhoKilledHitler,7,Fri Mar 27 20:43:00 2015 UTC,"When the R-7 missile was designed (which was gradually evolved into Soyuz), getting large rocket engines to ignite at all was a major challenge so designers avoided having to air start anything if possible.  The solution used by R-7 and the American Atlas missile was to ignite everything on the ground and then jettison parts of the rocket midway through flight as a form of partial staging.  R-7 used a central core plus strap-on boosters that each contained an engine plus propellants while Atlas used a central core with a single set of propellant tanks that fed a sustainer engine plus booster engines which fell away during the flight.  The design of Atlas was such that the fuel tanks were so lightweight that just ditching the extra engines was enough to make the system work."
spaceflight,30iz74,MatthewGeer,15,Fri Mar 27 23:44:42 2015 UTC,"To expand, one of the major concerns with igniting an upper stage was how to settle the fuel to the bottom of the of the tank after staging, when the rocket is essentially in free fall. The Atlas and R-7 put off this problem, but it had to be addressed eventually.  The Americans will typically solve this problem with ullage motors, small solid rockets or gas jets, which provide just enough thrust to cause the propellants to settle.  The Soviets, on the other hand, often took a different approach, lighting the upper stage while the lower stage is still firing, then separating the stages soon after.  This is why you see lattice work between stages on the Soyuz, Proton, and N-1.  It's to allow the exhaust from the upper stage engines escape while it's still attached to the lower stage.  As crazy as it sounds, they've worked out how to do it pretty reliably."
spaceflight,30iz74,BrewCityChaser,1 point,Sat Mar 28 06:12:32 2015 UTC,while Atlas used a central core with a single set of propellant tanks that fed a sustainer engine plus booster engines which fell away during the flight.   I made rockets that used this staging technique in KSP but I had no idea that the original Atlas rockets actually did this. This is fascinating to me for some reason.
spaceflight,30iz74,ManWhoKilledHitler,2,Sat Mar 28 16:24:27 2015 UTC,It was an amazing feat for its time.  It went from contract signing to first (unsuccessful) test flight in less than 2 1/2 years and had put a satellite into orbit less than 18 months after that.  It's still one of the most efficient designs ever produced in terms of fuel fraction because it used pressurised balloon tanks which were incredibly thin and lightweight.  Keeping the stainless steel of these tanks clean and corrosion free was the first significant use for a new water displacement product called WD-40.
spaceflight,30iz74,Sargeross,4,Sat Mar 28 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"I believe the Russian's have a different stage naming convention than the US. While the US tends to go 'booster-first stage-second stage', the Russians consider the 'boosters' to be the first stage, Hence they go 'first stage-second stage-third stage'"
spaceflight,30iz74,MaddingtonBear,4,Sat Mar 28 00:43:30 2015 UTC,"While watching the launch today, the narrator referred to something called ""hot staging"" where the second and third stage fire together for a bit.  How does this work and why would you design a rocket stack this way?"
spaceflight,30iz74,natedogg787,6,Sat Mar 28 04:41:30 2015 UTC,"If you look at this, you'll see the ""struts"" between the orange (upper stage) and gray (lower stage) tanks.  Basically, with hot staging, the engines on the upper stage ignite before the lower stage separates.  Exhaust goes out the sides, where the struts are, before the stages separate.  This is because the Russians had concerns that the third stage would not be able to ignite and start feeding fuel in free fall, which it would be in, had it separated, then ignited.  Instead, it ignites while the second stage is burning, to ensure that fuel is flowing to the bottom of the third stage tanks."

spaceflight,30iz74,Ravenchant,-1,Sat Mar 28 06:27:08 2015 UTC,"In addition to all the other excellent responses, the Americans who cannot live without pigeonholing everything according to a rigid convetion, use a play on ""half-stage"" to describe boosters like R-7. In that case, Soyuz without Fregat is a ""2.5-stage"" rocket. Ed Kyle uses that terminology, although as we know it's purely fanon."

spaceflight,30ek45,marzipandancer,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:47:53 2015 UTC,"Making a starship capable of bootstrapping an industrial complex upon reaching its destination would be quite the undertaking.  The first step would be to start with asteroid mining and human colonization of the asteroid belt.   This would give us the neccessary industrial base to actually make a starship, along with much needed technology and experience with self perpetuating industry.  The ship itself would probably need to be big, in order to carry enough fuel to decelerate at its destination, and to protect against high energy radiation and abrasion from instellar dust and molecules. The speed would also probably be ""low"", 1-5 times the speed of voyager, due to this mass.  This means the travel would take many thousands of years, so the ship would have to be completely inactive for most of it. The resulting cold internal temperatures would preserve the payload of the ship. The payload itself would have to include multiple redundancies, further increasing the mass of the ship.  In all, i think we are between 200-1000 years from achieving this, depending on how motivated we are to make it happen."
spaceflight,30ek45,ThrowAway9001,3,Fri Mar 27 11:41:57 2015 UTC,"There's been an argument that interplanetary missions that take more than, say, 20 years don't make sense because by the time your spacecraft reaches its destination, it will have been already overtaken by its own technologically more advanced successor. Presumably for interstellar missions, that limit time is going to be higher, but still - sending an interstellar vessel onto a trip lasting thousands of years could be pointless if in a few hundred years after launching it, we'll have a spacecraft even just twice as fast."
spaceflight,30ek45,jakub_h,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:46:40 2015 UTC,"Thats definitely possible, but it might also be that there are practical physical limits to how fast you can make a spaceship that is also large enough to survive the journey with a full payload.

In that case, we should err on the side of sending out our interstellar spacecraft early, before something unpredictable and bad happens to our civilization."

So what we need to do is go to Mars and have an independent colony on Mars, which is technically doable now and probably reasonably doable in a total of about 100 years. Because if we have a colony on Mars that's really completely independent of Earth, then no extinction event can kill us all anymore — not asteroids, ecological issues, bioterrorism, whatever it is. And if no single extinction event can kill the species, then the species is effectively immortal.   That's always been an idea close to my thinking about humanity's future in space.
