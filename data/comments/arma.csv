arma,3e2h6u,BanterousBane,3,Tue Jul 21 13:20:26 2015 UTC,I love how smooth EUTW runs.
arma,3e2h6u,Niklasgunner,2,Tue Jul 21 16:22:57 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I actually play EUTW quite a bit but my friends don't (I need new friends). In these videos you'll find; newb things, amazing things, amateur squadplay, the struggles of ""WHY ARE YOU SPRINTING EVERYWHERE?"" ""USE YOUR COMPASS"" kinda shit."
arma,3e3dkr,zeinweathers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:48 2015 UTC,Try switching arma to dev branch. Don't think it will let you play multiplayer though.
arma,3e3dkr,Yareen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:31 2015 UTC,Make sure all windows updates are installed too.

arma,3e3dkr,FerrumCenturio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:57:50 2015 UTC,Is Windows fully up to date? Did you get Arma 3 through Steam? What are your system specs?
arma,3e30df,msrichson,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:48 2015 UTC,What server/group is this?
