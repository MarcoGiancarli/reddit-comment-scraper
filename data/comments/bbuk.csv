bbuk,3e244v,WeLikeYourSheep,7,Tue Jul 21 10:57:46 2015 UTC,You have to think though that Helen would have never won if she didn't get a pass to the final. Even though she did she shouldn't have won she was a right bitch to everyone.
bbuk,3e244v,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,8,Tue Jul 21 11:30:37 2015 UTC,That free pass to the final is the worst thing bb has done.  When I saw jack get immunity at the beginning of this season I was upset because I thought they did it again.  At least jack was to dumb to use it with any level of strategy
bbuk,3e244v,LemonHerb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:25:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think they should ever give people a pass to the final but I guess they had to do something a bit different.
bbuk,3e244v,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,2,Tue Jul 21 16:41:35 2015 UTC,How is this even a question?
bbuk,3e244v,wigsnatcher,3,Tue Jul 21 16:14:10 2015 UTC,"Helen owned her mistakes pretty well I thought. She's always acknowledged she's a bitch. Who was right and who was wrong in their petty arguments was pretty irrelevant to why Ashleigh lost though.  Ashleigh's fans held the most organized internet campaign I've ever seen in weeks 9-10 in order to evict Winston, with heavy backlash on Mark as well. They both had tons of fans who would only be left with Helen to root for once they left, whereas Ashleigh still splits votes with Chris and Christopher in the finale."
bbuk,3e244v,ZombieDonShula,7,Tue Jul 21 14:24:10 2015 UTC,I don't think you get a free pass to be a bitch just because you admit to it.  It kind of makes it worse that she is completely unapologetic about it.
bbuk,3e244v,LemonHerb,7,Tue Jul 21 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Blah, blah, ""I'm a bitch but at least I'm being real."" OH. MY GOD. Shut up. You're a bitch, and there's nothing ok about the comments you make to people no matter how you justify it. Vile piece of trash who deserves it handed right back to her tenfold."
bbuk,3e244v,pfliegerz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:18 2015 UTC,I'm not saying she should get a free pass and I don't think someone that acted like Helen should win the show. I was explaining how it was possible for someone like Helen to win and I'm downvoted for it?
bbuk,3e244v,ZombieDonShula,2,Tue Jul 21 16:40:13 2015 UTC,"This sub is a little downvote happy.  There is really no reason to downvote anyone here unless they are being an asshole, it's all just opinions about a show."
bbuk,3e244v,LemonHerb,2,Tue Jul 21 21:23:51 2015 UTC,I thought I was bringing up a different kind of perspective on why Ashleigh lost despite being the nicer person but it's auto-downvotes when you compliment Helen in the first sentence.
bbuk,3e244v,ZombieDonShula,-1,Tue Jul 21 22:07:14 2015 UTC,"The most entertaining should always win imo, because it's a competition. Helen was ""worse"" by what you're saying but I don't think that matters so much"
bbuk,3e244v,historyisgr8,0,Tue Jul 21 11:01:27 2015 UTC,"So by that thinking, if Helen went killing a new puppy every week but in a very entertaining way, she should have won? You know when people read the Hunger Games and wonder ""What kind of people would want to see that happen""? I think you're precisely that. Entertainment and winning should not be put together just as rudeness and honesty shouldn't either. Helen was vile and never deserved the money, attention, nor the fame for the terrible things that she did."
bbuk,3e244v,janeetai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:43 2015 UTC,"So by that thinking, if Helen went killing a new puppy every week but in a very entertaining way, she should have won?    If she managed to make killing a puppy entertaining, that would be very impressive, but yes that's pretty much like saying ""If chloe was a nazi and caused the holocaust BUT WAS STILL VERY HONEST AND NICE would you still vote for her?"" aka it's a pointless strawman comment. I don't see why you equate a reality TV competition to murder twice in that comment, but fair enough.  I think you're taking big brother a bit more seriously than just a silly popularity contest, god forbid you watch gordon ramsay's kitchen nightmares (spoiler: he insults people a lot!)   Entertainment and winning should not be put together   umm..."
bbuk,3drw19,wigsnatcher,8,Sat Jul 18 21:29:25 2015 UTC,I tried watching BBUS but... it's not the same.

bbuk,3drw19,Pricey1983,2,Sun Jul 19 02:20:17 2015 UTC,I think there's only about a 10-15 minute delay.
bbuk,3drw19,CRB94,2,Sun Jul 19 04:28:40 2015 UTC,I watched an episode in the last week I think and a runner came on to the set to help Rylan take off a prop and he told her that it was live and then she ran off embarrassed!
bbuk,3drw19,thetopofmyhead,2,Sun Jul 19 10:51:19 2015 UTC,Couldn't blame her. I thought it was about to cut to a break the way Rylan finished his little skit. Instantly knew that she messed up and was hilarious to see them both confused.
bbuk,3drw19,joiroy,2,Sun Jul 19 22:33:25 2015 UTC,I know! I live in the US and I am always so entertained by BBUK. Now all I got is BBUS which is a whole 'nother animal and I am saddened :(
bbuk,3drw19,LemonHerb,2,Sat Jul 18 22:00:43 2015 UTC,"I'm from the US and can't really stand BBUS, but BB Australia isn't too bad and it can be found on youtube, I have a link somewhere probably.  It has a slightly different format, but they get a house Dog which is awesome."
bbuk,3drw19,LemonHerb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:47:54 2015 UTC,I gave it a go when they revived it a few years ago and didn't even care who won by the end.  That they try to be so 'family friendly' is grating.
bbuk,3drw19,LemonHerb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:32:55 2015 UTC,"I thought the last few seasons were good. They have some strange aspects to it though with the whole competition to get immunity, and the house party.  I didn't even notice the family friendly aspect though."
bbuk,3drw19,Axist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:35:10 2015 UTC,I distinctly remember people being put in jail and punished for swearing; I thought it was pretty petty.

bbuk,3drw19,joiroy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:39:16 2015 UTC,I remember it happening to multiple housemates throughout the course of the series.  I'm certain it wasn't a task.
bbuk,3dp36m,iffriben,10,Sat Jul 18 02:27:05 2015 UTC,Kathy would be great!! She loves BB!!!
bbuk,3dp36m,ok_then23,6,Sat Jul 18 02:38:52 2015 UTC,"Being a filthy American I can't really speak for British celebs but as for Americans considering the theme I would love to see Kathy and Hulk in there.   And honestly, I would LOVE to see Julie Chen go in the house since she hosts American BB on CBS. But it would never, ever happen."
bbuk,3dp36m,pfliegerz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:57:18 2015 UTC,"I think Julie might have a little too much respect for herself than to enter that sorta environment, lol."
bbuk,3dp36m,joiroy,3,Tue Jul 21 02:09:48 2015 UTC,"I really doubt the Lindsay Lohan and Hulk Hogan rumors, but then again last year I said there was NO way Perez Hilton would do British CBB"
bbuk,3dp36m,bellecasey,5,Sat Jul 18 06:09:57 2015 UTC,I wish he hadn't done it. he was awful and the olny thing that happened was arguments which is good the first few times but then just gets boring.
bbuk,3dp36m,cheesehead99,3,Sat Jul 18 17:30:57 2015 UTC,"He was genuinely psychotic, it was so uncomfortable to watch"
bbuk,3dp36m,bellecasey,2,Sun Jul 19 03:50:23 2015 UTC,Yeah and the worst thing was that normally big brother would make sure to calm them down or give a warning but they didn't bother doing that at all. They just made sure he wouldn't leave.
bbuk,3dp36m,cheesehead99,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:54:11 2015 UTC,I completely forgot about CBB after that damn season. Can we get Kathy Griffin on as some kind of apology? please?

bbuk,3dp36m,Nightshiftworker,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:45:39 2015 UTC,The thing with speculating is that you cant really think of half the people they put in because they will be nobody's that only a small amount of people will know. which is stupid really. like some guy that was a contestant on a show about 10 years ago or something.
bbuk,3dp36m,cheesehead99,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:29:37 2015 UTC,It would be funny if the whole house caught Hulkamania like on Kimmy Schmidt.

bbuk,3dp36m,Alfiedog100,0,Mon Jul 20 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"as an American I can honestly say that the Americans they have put into the CBB house in the past have been downright embarassing.  Mostly washed up reality show veterans for a while (Heidi Montag, Spencer Pratt for instance who were hideous, The Situation, Courtney Stodden etc), then poor brain damaged Gary Busey (who somehow won despite being delusional through much of the series) and then godawful sick fuck Perez Hilton, so I don't hold out much hope for anyone I might actually look forward to seeing."

bbuk,3dpmtc,deathbybayleaf,2,Sat Jul 18 05:51:29 2015 UTC,"2005 I remember well and that had some moments, Kinga and wine bottle, Eugene ramblin on, cornflakes over the head, Science being all important and annoying, Makosi manipulator, Derek freaking out over, ok you can go now, loads of stuff. 2007 I found interesting, especially with just women going in for the first few days and how they got on till men arrived. 2008 was also interesting, to see a luxury bedroom vs a basic one and who took the nice one, and the infamous painting fiasco, memba I told u, ha ha. 2006 was entertaining throughout, Spiral, Nikki, Shabazz, Glynn, loads of memorable characters for me. 2009, Rodrigo and the queen, ha ha. I dunno, haven't seen them all. Watched the very first one live but all I really remember is the nasty nick confrontation at the table."
bbuk,3dpmtc,MotionEyes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:53:05 2015 UTC,"lol Makosi's ""pregnancy"" and Craig Coates as Myra Hindley/his general existence."
bbuk,3dmznh,iffriben,6,Fri Jul 17 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"I think it would have been a lot better had some characters who left, not have left as soon as they did.  Like Aaron (even though he deserved it), Adjoa, the twins, Sarah, Jade, Marc, and Simon on Day 1.  Because they did leave, though, we were left with a relatively peaceful house, whose best highlights in the following days were conversations of what they plan to do when they leave the house."
bbuk,3dmznh,BertGlamGa,2,Fri Jul 17 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I think the order of eviction did have an impact on this house as well, though some of those names (Simon, The Twins, Adjoa) I don't quite agree with.  I do think Sarah, Jade and keiren went way too soon. Jade to me was a dark horse winner. The fact that they brought her back for a visit in the final week showed that she might have been a misused houseguest.  Marc was a prick and should have been thrown out weeks before he was voted out. When he was on the show, the show became about him. When he wasn't on screen people were talking about him. Big brother invented many tasks so he could ""get up to some mischief"". The Marc show was the big reason why this season was a turd. After that boring houseguests, and after that boring tasks."
bbuk,3dmznh,CitizenJaggers,3,Fri Jul 17 20:28:17 2015 UTC,"It was a great season, I never missed an episode but a underserved winner. I have done farts with more personality than she has."
bbuk,3dmznh,Jordy_Banks,3,Sat Jul 18 12:07:39 2015 UTC,"I thought last year's was bad, but this one made it seem great by comparison. The housemates had decent potential, and they did as well as could be expected under the circumstances. But there was just too much chaos for it to be the kind of big brother I enjoy.  Constantly having twists, and challenges that are designed to cause conflict in too direct a way meant that the house dynamics never developed naturally. There was way too much focus on forced drama, and not enough on getting to know what the housemates are really like as people (I love drama, but not when its created on a weekly basis by the latest 'who said this nasty quote' challenge). The older seasons being so formulaic meant you could get a better understanding of the housemates' personalities, see relationships and conflicts grow and fade, and it wasn't just one big reaction after another.  I also hated having so much outside influence. The second a housemate gets an idea of how the public sees them, their real personality is gone for good."
bbuk,3dmznh,scratchmellotron,5,Sun Jul 19 00:59:13 2015 UTC,"I think it was quite a good one, but also a complete mess. They can't pull the stunts they did this time again, the initial casting was off. You need more divisive characters in there from the start, with Simon getting the boot on the first night everyone fell into their roles too quickly and got too comfortable.  They need to go back to vote to save to keep the bigger characters as well, the final didn't reflect the series."
bbuk,3dmznh,Bananananafish,3,Fri Jul 17 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say divisive, but the casting really needs to learn to spot a fake. I mean, look at Chloe's VT. she made the biggest deal about being SO judgmental and confrontational and HATING people with money and loving winning blah blah.   I know they've had oversights from the beginning (see: BB7 Mikey coming in pretending to be hugely misogynistic) but by now they should still at least pick a good ratio of characters : phonies"
bbuk,3dmznh,bellecasey,2,Fri Jul 17 18:37:05 2015 UTC,"I think the initial cast was great, a fantastic balance. Honestly, for me, 4In4Out ruined it. They sent out all the dominant housemates, it was truly ridiculous. I was glad that Nick made it to the end though, himself and Harry kept me tuned, as they were the truly entertaining housemates."
bbuk,3dmznh,Marcusaur,2,Sat Jul 18 14:11:51 2015 UTC,Horrible winner cancel reg bb uk and keep celeb bb uk
bbuk,3dmznh,branhoo88,2,Sun Jul 19 04:39:56 2015 UTC,"I've not been a long time watcher, but I found the HM to all be relatively boring. Marc was the most entertaining and he barely lasted, AND wasn't even picked as an original HM. I'm not saying it has to be conflict 24/7 but everyone wanting to hug and be besties for life got old super fast. Not to mention that I've never seen a group of people laying in bed under the covers for so much time. WAKE UP PEOPLE!"
bbuk,3dmznh,MavisJ,2,Fri Jul 17 16:40:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know they always say ""well we can't be entertaining 24/7"", but when 50% of the highlights show has people sleeping in the background or laying in bed there's a problem"
bbuk,3dmznh,bellecasey,4,Sat Jul 18 05:46:29 2015 UTC,"Someone like Marc can't survive vote to evict, which also means they have to keep interfering with nominations to keep them any time at all.  It makes them more money but it buggers up the show, they have to change it to vote to save for next time."
bbuk,3dmznh,Bananananafish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:07:37 2015 UTC,I really do think Marc is just one of those insane mishaps in voting that will never make sense properly even if you break it all down
bbuk,3dmznh,bellecasey,2,Fri Jul 17 18:31:30 2015 UTC,"Nah, it was similar to Nikki getting the boot in BB7 when the whole house was put up. When a character dominates the show they will go over everyone else under vote to evict.  Their support is split."
bbuk,3dmznh,Bananananafish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:37:06 2015 UTC,"I forgot about that, that was terrible. Her re-entry was actually one of the only times I've been totally cool with production interfering, because she HAD to get back in there and make the final"
bbuk,3dmznh,bellecasey,2,Fri Jul 17 18:39:35 2015 UTC,"Marc was loved by a selection, but hated by more. Much like Marc his supporters were the most vocal it seemed, but most people hated how misogynistic, rude, showy, and annoying he was. I don't vote, but I would have voted Marc out quickly if I did."
bbuk,3dmznh,CitizenJaggers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:31:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending Marc at all, it just seemed that the crowd, twitter, reddit and polls were all hugely in Marc's favor, to the point where I'm not sure he really was hated by more. I think people were counting on him getting through and weren't jumping to evict others to save him, or the vote was too split. Who knows"
bbuk,3dmznh,bellecasey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:48:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly I found this season at all times either boring, tedious, painfully aggressive, manipulative or silly, or some combination of the above.  There were a few fun times and great dramas, but other than that I truly regret watching at all. I really do blame casting - though a lot of the production twists this year were just over the top and too manipulative, I can see myself liking them more with better housemates. Like, Dex, Glyn and some of the time warpers were more dynamic in their 1 hour - 48 hours than any of the housemates this year ever were, and that's not because they were the best ever housemates, it's that they were good housemates at all.   I'm not sure what will really fix the casting issue, which I've rambled on before and this is long enough so :3"

bbuk,3djv7u,mimre,3,Fri Jul 17 00:07:48 2015 UTC,with a bit of luck we will just have marc and a couple of Aspergers kids.
bbuk,3djv7u,henry82,14,Fri Jul 17 04:12:29 2015 UTC,"Not the worst winner, and definitely not the worst season, but far from the best. Not particularly good.  The timebomb theme didn't work, imo. The past housemates coming back made sense and I expected it, but other than that it seemed like they mostly came up with a lot of big bombshells that they could call timebombs because of the cog theme. It annoyed me during the whole show.  A lot of housemates had little entertaining personality. I wasn't aware Chloe was even in the house until I spotted her two weeks in. It only got good when things were shaken up BY Big Brother, not naturally. Even the housemate's ""rebellions"" felt manufactured.   Other than that though, it's been okay. Some bits were funny. I found BB themselves to be funny this year (Sarcastic comment to Cristian, also cute things like encouraging Chloe this evening and saying goodnight). A few good characters (personal favourites being Marc, Jack at the end, and Joel even though he's a Tory).   Anyway this got longer than expected. First time I've watched BB in a few years because I find the C5 series less interesting, was slightly better than I imagined. Not great though."
bbuk,3djv7u,lilegg,3,Thu Jul 16 22:47:07 2015 UTC,"That's a shame, both Secrets and Lies and Power Trip were a lot better than this year. Hopefully the next one you tune in for isn't so disappointing"
bbuk,3djv7u,bellecasey,3,Fri Jul 17 02:12:54 2015 UTC,I personally really disliked the old housemates going in. The season ceased to be about the housemates who were in there like it was supposed to be. The core housemates didn't have a chance to make things interesting for themselves!
bbuk,3djv7u,modernbenoni,3,Fri Jul 17 09:31:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was drawn out (wasn't it meant to end sooner than it did?). I did like the idea though. I liked it when random housemates came in for a few minutes and everyone froze. It should have only been a short stay for Nikki, Helen, and Brian, because it definitely got too focussed on Nikki and Helen. Good idea that was executed poorly."
bbuk,3djv7u,lilegg,8,Fri Jul 17 16:26:46 2015 UTC,The past two years' winners were worse. Last year takes the biscuit for me.
bbuk,3djv7u,Thar_Cian,10,Thu Jul 16 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"really? I thought last year was great. Helen was a bitch, but damn she was entertaining."
bbuk,3djv7u,henry82,3,Fri Jul 17 04:04:40 2015 UTC,"I hate when people downvote someone else's preference.   Anyway, Helen was entertaining but she got a pass to the final and the votes were split letting her win. I'd want her to be in the final but I don't think I'd want her to win, but the rest of the cast was lame too."
bbuk,3djv7u,originalnutta,2,Fri Jul 17 06:10:51 2015 UTC,Last year nobody else in the final really deserved to win in my opinion. At least Helen was entertaining.
bbuk,3djv7u,modernbenoni,4,Fri Jul 17 09:29:25 2015 UTC,"Not the worst winner, but probably the worst season so far. Chloe did not deserve to win anyway, no idea how that happends. Joel or Nick where the only possible winners in my eyes, did not see anyone else having a shot at all."
bbuk,3djv7u,Klaent,4,Fri Jul 17 12:52:30 2015 UTC,"A normal girl? Haha check her instagram, not every normal girls goes to Dubai on fancy holiday and drive a big white bmw. Her oul lad is in prison for Money Laundering and Drugs."
bbuk,3djv7u,Jordy_Banks,8,Sat Jul 18 12:08:59 2015 UTC,My vote for worst winner goes to sam.
bbuk,3djv7u,Dixie1337,4,Thu Jul 16 23:57:45 2015 UTC,I find it odd that the worst winner came from one of the best seasons.
bbuk,3djv7u,TheFreshPrince12,6,Fri Jul 17 03:56:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah Sam was slightly worse than Chloe because he literally didn't even exist until the last week, and won solely based on playing up to the cameras through the final stretch, pulling sympathy votes and being less controversial than Dex and Gina   I hate Chloe, but at least she's been vaguely present throughout the process"
bbuk,3djv7u,bellecasey,5,Fri Jul 17 02:39:32 2015 UTC,"There are aspects of this season I loved and other aspects I hated.  Worst season, maybe, but that is because of my own personal reasons and what I expect from bbuk.    I know that my opinions are my own and I don't begrudge other watchers and their likes and dislikes, including housemate preferences."
bbuk,3djv7u,Kigurumix,5,Thu Jul 16 22:04:53 2015 UTC,i think its the worst ever. Chloe is just plain boring and annoying..... I think the show is completely rigged to be honest
bbuk,3djv7u,branhoo88,0,Thu Jul 16 22:00:22 2015 UTC,"She won because she is ""normal"" and gave a speech saying so.   Joel and Nick didn't care about the money, Jack was a part, Danny was sketchy and Christian was boring.   People wanted to vote for the anti-helen and someone more like them.Plus she had some good DR sessions."

bbuk,3djv7u,branhoo88,2,Fri Jul 17 12:08:03 2015 UTC,"I watched Seasons 5-11 and then this one. For me, this was easily the worst season. People in this house often showed one of two traits. Boring and Borderline abusive. It was either people doing nothing or people being assholes (read: Marc). Neither are good TV. and The tasks were very cheap and boring. Very few good week long themed tasks, and way, WAY too many ""pop-quizes"" where people had to talk shit to each other without a choice to not do it. It got dull."
bbuk,3djv7u,CitizenJaggers,4,Fri Jul 17 07:46:18 2015 UTC,I can't hate the entire series because it gave us Marc.  But I absolutely hate who won.

bbuk,3djv7u,WezVC,3,Thu Jul 16 21:42:17 2015 UTC,Joel would be my least favorite person to win.  The reason Chloe won is because everyone was so horrible at the end she probably just got the vote for being the girl
bbuk,3djv7u,LemonHerb,2,Thu Jul 16 21:44:19 2015 UTC,"I stopped watching just under a week ago which I can't say I did in the previous seasons ive watched (which isnt very many) but i still wouldnt say chloe is the worst winner.  helen to me is the worst because i think she should have been removed and i hate her without even ever meeting her. it hurt me to watch her last year and this year.   chloe is like sam. we'll all forget who she is in a short while, which happens with big brother. this season is marc's season like sam's season was dexter's."

bbuk,3djv7u,bellecasey,2,Fri Jul 17 05:58:55 2015 UTC,I dunno. I kind of enjoyed having a nice person win. Makes up for that basic bitch winner from last year.
bbuk,3djv7u,muffsponge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"I was disappointed that so early in the series, well before any drama could have evolved naturally as it always does, the producers chose to change out the cast and put in a handpicked ""villain"" which was supposedly more ""entertaining"".  They then brought in a seemingly neverending stream of former housemates who basically reduced the original housemates to extras in their own series, they protected The Chosen One from nomination for a solid month, gave Helen Wood an undeserved second chance at being relentlessly hateful,  and threw out most of the format Big Brother was supposedly based on.  If it wasn't the absolute worst, you have to give them A for effort because it did seem everything they did was deliberately meant to undermine the very concept of the show as we know it.    My feeling is, if you liked this series, you must not have liked Big Brother before this.  For those of us who did, this was just a producer's circlejerk."
bbuk,3djv7u,thatssorandom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:13:53 2015 UTC,"I stopped watching the minute Mark left. I hated mark with a passion but he was at least something to watch. I couldn't stand Joel - far to political in a sense that I don't feel like I met Joel, only the Joel he wanted to present. Jack just seemed like he was fake and I don't feel like I got to know him either. Danny was a knob. Harry and Nick were just plain uncomfortable to watch and Christian is an afterthought even when recapping the season.   Her winning is ok I guess. Right along the lines of Sam tbh. Don't care that they won and didn't even bother to watch the last couple weeks. It makes me sad because I was super excited when this season started. But it kind of fizzled. They brought in a few good ones I feel like they even misses the mark with bringing people back. There's always next year."
bbuk,3djv7u,Nightshiftworker,0,Fri Jul 17 18:01:54 2015 UTC,"Well, when the final is literally 5 guys and 1 girl, there isn't much doubt. You have to consider vote-splitting and all that and Chloe was at a serious advantage going into it because of the dynamics of the group remaining. You can't get caught up on who deserved it more and who was more entertaining etc. Chloe was literally the only girl left in a sea of guys and of course in an ideal world people wouldn't root for her just because of that, but that's not the reality of the situation. If this is a problem for the UK public, they shouldn't have literally evicted every single other girl (most of whom were way more interesting/entertaining than Chloe, if I may add) whenever possible, because the public is ultimately what created this finale setup. If you had a hypothetical finale of Chloe + Joel + Danny + Christian + 2 other girls, Joel probably wins.   And you know what, I'm not even mad. This year's finalists were pretty terrible and I consider Chloe to be the least objectionable so there ya go. I honestly think she's kind of sweet and thought her reaction to winning was pretty heartwarming. I feel like the crazy entertaining bitches like Helen are hated so much and then when someone nice and boring wins, they're hated as well.   Although, apparently Joel was the subreddit favorite so maybe I'm just delusional because that seriously baffles me. Joel? JOEL? He's been atrocious throughout and although I think Chloe ranks pretty low in terms of winners, I find it hard to take the opinion of someone who believes Joel should have won seriously."

bbuk,3djv7u,bellecasey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:14:09 2015 UTC,This subreddit thrives on members belittling people for their opinions of housemates.  People who didn't like Marc were downvoted into silence and god forbid if you posted that you supported Chloe or Danny the same would happen.    Doesn't make for a very fair and frank discussion of BB if you can't participate if you don't follow the majority.
bbuk,3djv7u,Kigurumix,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:24:44 2015 UTC,"I have found this subreddit just fine regarding others' opinions and lively discussion.  BTW I also favored Helen and posted as such.  Regardless of your views on any housemate, you are likely to find at least one kindred spirit here.  Why would you let downvoting silence you?  This subreddit is here for you to express your opinion regardless.  Just ignore the trolls."

Great great winner!  Great runner-up as well. Fitting with the huge Conservative victory in the USA was a young conservative man and again one who was more a 'real boy' than a lot of others.  despite Emmas obsession with pretending he had some manipulative plot.. which wasn't a theme or anything HMs or anyone was going on about"

Put in characters with real personalities. If next series is this bad i think i will be done with big brother."
bbuk,3die52,Winter_knights,4,Fri Jul 17 02:19:24 2015 UTC,From the entire series the only thing I will remember is Marc. By far the biggest prick and most entertaining house guest.  The rest was just meh.
bbuk,3die52,juanchopancho,7,Fri Jul 17 07:25:32 2015 UTC,Not done well:  Vote to evict during Marc's eviction.  Should of been vote to save.  The show took an absolute nose dive after Marc's eviction.  A missed opportunity around the fat kid's money box.  He should've been challenged to have the money taken somehow.  Failure to cycle boring housemates out.  The final housemates are some of the most dull and shallow people I've seen on the show.  I have been fast forwarding through most content the past week or so.  Done well:  BB legends.  Wow.  During the time Marc and the legends were in the house I was thinking this was the best BB ever.  Ever!  Pacing.  Aside from the first 2 weeks and last 2 weeks the pacing of the show has been stellar.  Rarely a boring show was to be had.  Abundant alcohol.
bbuk,3die52,Lewdie,3,Thu Jul 16 18:19:10 2015 UTC,"I do hope we get a change in the voting system, the voting results this year have been bizarre throughout.  I have barely watched this last week too!  Thank you for your response."
bbuk,3die52,JuiceBusters,2,Thu Jul 16 18:31:04 2015 UTC,"As you guys know I've had some 'insider' info and angles this season but that has nothing to do with why I think this was one of the better BB seasons. Here are my reasons:   Real People love them or not but i was massively refreshed to see more real people than 'characters'. ""The Boys"", Jack, Nick and Joel were real 19,20 year old boys who were.. well.. mostly like young men coming of age (in a bizarre circumstance). Cristian was a real boy. He wasn't a gimmick rapper. He was a real boy who desperately wants to have a character and can't do it. Chloe was a real girl. She wasn't a Geordie Shore 'character'. A real girl. Amy and Sally were actually surprisingly normal nice young ladies who never did gimmicks or 'characters' or were trying to show off 'acting skills' etc. Keiran was a good and real normal young man. Sam was 'who she was'. Harriet was a real young woman. The 'Normies' actually ran the asylum, fought those who'd take it over, fought BB from taking it away - the 'Normals' won.  The Public and the Normals One of the most refreshing things ever - the voting public, whos way too often prone to voting in 'characters' and 'antiheroes' (who are characters themselves) was WITH the NOrmals this year! The Great British PUblic promptly kicked the 'shocking nasty im-hot lesbian' crappy character. Sarah came way too close to being the 'Im a bitch so what!' and was gone. Jade another, Harry another.   The Normal's Conversions I absolutely love that the outrageous BB 'characters' who persisted were the ones who got blown up by the Normals until they showed their true normal sides. Harry was this way. (Jade too actually). Simon is a superb example of a big fantasy 'BB Character' who got crushed by the Normal House until he actually became suprisingly normal himself. Marc had this too. He became a 'normal' and when he returned a 'character' he was promptly booted out.  Returning All-Stars:  As everyone knows I was aware of this and tipped off only this reddit forum about the plot to bring them back in various tasks etc. In fact, I loved moments like the 'Time Freeze' and letting all the past greats run about. Legends.   What things I didn't like: Returning All-stars -I'm a BB Purist. I think it ruins the entire premise, psychological premises, the very fundamental dynamics when any HM gets any outside visitors but ESPECIALLY if they get ANY kind of outside information like telling them how popular they are, were, can be, informing them who's a cheater, etc.   4-in-4 out Again, as a Purist I have no interest in new people entering later on who then share information and in this case the season wasn't boring. Nobody was complaining about them being too boring. That was a 'narrative' just talked about only by BB right after they did the 4-in-4-out thing. Especially since Keiran and Harriet were great IMO. They could have just ADDED 4 new ones IF they wanted that angle IMO.  *Minor Complaint:  I have said for a long time they need to have young conservatives in that house. And NOT choosing a radical nutjob who's obviously made to be the bad example. But good young Christian or conservative types. They had 1 this year and it was Joel and low and behold - he was hugely popular with the public! For some reason Emma (who i love) just felt it necessary to keep going on about how he must have manipulated people, how manipulative he was etc. No, he wasn't. Nobody thought that.   Other annoyances - the 'barf challenges'. I am not interested in watching people vomit. I get this is almost a 'standard' but really just annoys me. Also not a fan of touching the prize fund in any ways. I felt the editing and production values were very good but.. a little too 'pat' but that's just nitpicking quality after all."

bbuk,3die52,branhoo88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:05:20 2015 UTC,I completely agree with the housewife statement.  I thought with all this social media nowadays that the younger audience would determine the vote but it seems to be 40 plus woman ringing up getting ride of the personalities.

This series has been a joke in terms of cutting them off from the outside world already, and now they're letting an ex-housemate in with only a few days left so she can give them some last minute advice?   EDIT: Yeah, I'm absolutely ready for this series to be over. I feel like I've just been watching out of habit for a while but I haven't really been enjoying it, I've just been getting more and more annoyed by it."
bbuk,3deu8q,WezVC,6,Wed Jul 15 21:24:46 2015 UTC,Chloe can say what she likes to who she likes but they have to speak to her differently because she's a woman according to Jade.
bbuk,3deu8q,Alfiedog100,4,Wed Jul 15 21:45:21 2015 UTC,Every time somebody says something like that to defend their gender they only end up harming it further! That woman Cristian necked was exactly the same.
bbuk,3deu8q,WezVC,3,Wed Jul 15 21:58:09 2015 UTC,It made me cringe when Chloe told Jack his waist size got bigger.  Imagine if anyone said anything like that to her!!! She is a hypocrite with more than just the money.  I was surprised this didn't come up in BOTS.  Nobody wants to dis Chloe for some reason.  She does not deserve the win.
bbuk,3deu8q,fefe2000,10,Thu Jul 16 15:58:22 2015 UTC,"Jade hugging Nick and Joel being in the background just like ""jaaaaaade"" lol"
bbuk,3deu8q,glassjesoos,9,Wed Jul 15 21:36:22 2015 UTC,"Eyerolling at Jade assuring Chloe to feel good about taking the 5k. For goodness sake, she incured wrath not because of 5k. It was because of her hypocritical preaching to everyone else not to take money. So sick of this Chloe woman getting away with bs and everyone licking her arse because her feelings are so damn delicate. I want anyone but Chloe to win."
bbuk,3deu8q,lurkjoy,7,Thu Jul 16 00:48:32 2015 UTC,Chloe talking about how much she has changed whilst in the house...saying she isn't as judgmental as she used to be.  Hello?  Chloe is the judgiest judge this side of judgeville.  She doesn't know herself at all.
bbuk,3deu8q,fefe2000,14,Thu Jul 16 07:49:39 2015 UTC,Joel is officially a bigger queen than Aaron
bbuk,3deu8q,AcePlague,5,Wed Jul 15 21:12:55 2015 UTC,"The random blonde haired dude on the webcam might just be Aaron reincarnated. I've seen him on BOTS before, funnily enough"

bbuk,3deu8q,oliverecks,4,Wed Jul 15 21:07:00 2015 UTC,I need brain bleach after seeing Danny do that
bbuk,3deu8q,Bananananafish,3,Wed Jul 15 21:10:34 2015 UTC,I'm confused. Why does everyone have hot water bottles? Is this a British thing that a Yank like just doesn't understand?  I don't understand why they would send someone in there with 2 days left and expect for that to be enough time to change what the public thinks of them. Do they think that people only base their votes on a day to day basis?
bbuk,3deu8q,MavisJ,2,Thu Jul 16 01:04:51 2015 UTC,"I'm also confused, maybe the house is quite cold at night since its quite open making it harder to warm up?"
bbuk,3deu8q,JohnnySwoleCash,3,Thu Jul 16 14:00:29 2015 UTC,"Nick and Jade are so sweet. That was a nice, genuine happy moment amongst all the forced OMGBFF bullshit this week"
bbuk,3deu8q,bellecasey,3,Thu Jul 16 13:41:04 2015 UTC,"I wish Joel had given it back to be honest.   As soon as the guy said ""Of course I've made mistakes, like talking to you"" I'd have loved to see Joel respond with something like ""You're only getting paid because you're talking to me""."
bbuk,3da7dn,TrillTurtle,2,Tue Jul 14 18:28:02 2015 UTC,"Why didn't he mention Marc on that BB segment of past HM's. Made me kinda sad he is a distant memory.

bbuk,3d6flu,DotDotDot16,3,Tue Jul 14 07:28:26 2015 UTC,"The ""come here often?"" joke is too much for me. It was said twice last night alone I think, and both tanked."
bbuk,3d6flu,TrillTurtle,3,Tue Jul 14 13:06:37 2015 UTC,"Got a bit of a headache from everyone yelling over each other for the first half D:  It's nice to see even panel guests agreeing that this final six is mostly bullshit.

bbuk,3d6flu,bellecasey,4,Tue Jul 14 03:25:23 2015 UTC,"Sarah, Harriet and even Aaron were all entertaining housemates and they went so early. I still think the 4 in 4out made the show worse, it was such an unfair eviction. And it kept a lot of boring uninteresting housemates in while throwing out the housemates who were constantly getting airtime."
bbuk,3d6flu,TrillTurtle,8,Tue Jul 14 13:09:17 2015 UTC,"I quickly forgot who Kermit Kieran was, and Harriet, while I do like her, only got air time because if so much a fly was in her vicinity, she would have a meltdown."

I think they needed to shake up the house a bit, but they took the wrong people out of the house. They should've taken Chloe, Danny, Christian and Jack out instead."

bbuk,3d5wbg,osprey81,4,Tue Jul 14 06:31:26 2015 UTC,It's already got two e's in it!

bbuk,3d5wbg,nefelibatae,3,Mon Jul 13 20:45:35 2015 UTC,Exactly that! Haha
bbuk,3d5wbg,mixdkinkster83,2,Mon Jul 13 20:49:14 2015 UTC,Thats why I dont want her to win. Looking at her Instagram you can tell she was lying about how 5k will change her life... Pffftttt
bbuk,3d5wbg,Toridon88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:59:57 2015 UTC,Exactly what I was going to say. You can see from her instragram that she's done some travelling.
bbuk,3d5wbg,fefe2000,12,Tue Jul 14 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"Sigh. This season.  I have dedicated so much time.  Watched every day, watched all BOTS episodes.  What a pity we are left with this sad lot of housemates undeserving of the win.  I really really hope they go back to voting to save next season."
bbuk,3d5wbg,Kigurumix,6,Tue Jul 14 00:35:57 2015 UTC,Vote to save is only used for Celebrity Big Brother and the final of the regular Big Brother.
bbuk,3d5wbg,fefe2000,3,Tue Jul 14 01:03:34 2015 UTC,"OK, thanks for the information.  I have only watched a few seasons and didn't catch that.  I wonder how differently (if at all) the outcome would have been if it was vote to save for the whole season?  Perhaps this is also a commonly posed question... :-)"
bbuk,3d5wbg,Beevo,5,Tue Jul 14 01:10:32 2015 UTC,If it was vote to save I suspect Marc would still be in the house. The reason he's gone is because his supporters split their votes trying to get any of the other 3 he was up against out.

bbuk,3d5wbg,Kigurumix,16,Mon Jul 13 20:42:07 2015 UTC,I cringe every time he starts singing.
bbuk,3d5wbg,Davelbast,11,Mon Jul 13 20:50:21 2015 UTC,"Nevermind Marc and Helen, the worst pair this series has been Joel and karaoke"
bbuk,3d5wbg,the_cucumber,2,Mon Jul 13 20:56:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's hilarious! He has the most deadpan singing voice I've ever heard, it really cracks me up. I think Chloe's right about all politicians having a weird side."
bbuk,3d5wbg,MavisJ,4,Tue Jul 14 05:02:06 2015 UTC,I agree. It gives me LIFE that he loves it so much. I'm impressed every time that he knows all the words so well.
bbuk,3d5wbg,oliverecks,15,Tue Jul 14 13:51:36 2015 UTC,Not very entertaining watching Jack get constant grief from housemates and BB. Edit: How does Joel know every word to every song they play
bbuk,3d5wbg,AcePlague,28,Mon Jul 13 20:18:15 2015 UTC,Because he's a massive closet queen
bbuk,3d5wbg,jokinson,18,Mon Jul 13 23:24:43 2015 UTC,Shame Aaron got kicked out. Reckon him and Joel might be an item by now
bbuk,3d5wbg,a_tiny_monster,15,Mon Jul 13 20:46:31 2015 UTC,Aaron was gross.
bbuk,3d5wbg,DrowningInRealism,4,Mon Jul 13 23:39:49 2015 UTC,The way Christian was watching Joel during his performance had me thinking they'd be a great couple. Joel is way more comfortable with Christian than he was with Aaron
bbuk,3d5wbg,Osinib,3,Mon Jul 13 22:20:27 2015 UTC,Yes I get that vibe too. I don't know what that was. But Joel was singing to christian and he was into it. Too bad they never made a move on each other during this season. That would have been fun to see
bbuk,3d5wbg,nefelibatae,14,Tue Jul 14 06:50:31 2015 UTC,Jesus fucking Christ. Hands down that was the best ending to an episode this series.  Joel made me cry of laughter into my cushion. Nick's intoxicated swaying was the icing on the cake.  Ah man.
bbuk,3d5wbg,mixdkinkster83,11,Mon Jul 13 20:59:37 2015 UTC,Joel was feeling that song!! He was feeling his oats!!
bbuk,3d5wbg,fefe2000,3,Mon Jul 13 22:18:29 2015 UTC,"Hmmmph.  I watched the teaser before the opening credits and stopped there.  I have no desire to watch this episode AT ALL, but based on this comment maybe I will turn on the last five minutes."
bbuk,3d5wbg,Kigurumix,3,Tue Jul 14 00:25:41 2015 UTC,Only if you like to watch Joel singing and dancing.  I know when I watch again tonight with my husband I will either spare him the pain or leave the room if he wants to watch it.
bbuk,3d5wbg,nefelibatae,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I was making dinner for three quarters of the episode and therefore was only hearing what was being said like it was background music.

bbuk,3d5wbg,Snoopyseagul,13,Tue Jul 14 02:01:34 2015 UTC,The whole bloody song? Did we really have to go through that?
bbuk,3d5wbg,bellecasey,2,Mon Jul 13 20:57:00 2015 UTC,"That was a horrible editing decision. The song is about winning, it's the final, WE GET IT. The worst BB edits are always when they try to be overly sentimental and deep"
bbuk,3d5wbg,SP0oONY,6,Tue Jul 14 03:27:18 2015 UTC,I think it's more that the current housemates are so boring that they didn't actually have anymore decent footage.
bbuk,3d5wbg,bellecasey,2,Tue Jul 14 03:59:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I mean also the silly panning over the housemate 'finalist' pictures and stuff, I just found it so cringe"
bbuk,3d5wbg,the_cucumber,11,Tue Jul 14 04:44:26 2015 UTC,"Danny was such a dick to jack during all the tasks. Pouring the bucket slowly, suggesting they go inside, making him hold the food and complaining about the food in the DR later... jack didn't have to do all that, show some appreciation at least."

bbuk,3d5wbg,086bagofcats,2,Mon Jul 13 23:54:25 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what bb said
bbuk,3d5wbg,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,2,Tue Jul 14 00:06:46 2015 UTC,Just watched it and Danny was being a right prick. Seems extremely salty about not having £24K. Hope he doesn't win.

Nick - boring, Joel, seriously I don't want to hear you sing and slut drop thanks."

Paying down your debt in lump some so interest does not accumulate is an intelligent idea, but no body ever does it.

Given the fact that if you're a low earner (like Cristian) you won't pay off your loan anyway as you'll hit the 30 year mark (where it's wiped at no impact on your credit), it makes no sense to pay off debt that you might very well not have to pay at all. Paying off your student loans early only makes sense if you are in a high paying job and have a a substantial amount of liquid money."
bbuk,3d1gqx,SP0oONY,3,Sun Jul 12 23:07:22 2015 UTC,"Right that it what i wrote.... IF he is going to invest, eg down payment on for a Mortgage on a house, mutual funds, etc, sure take your risk their but if your are going to invest in the party lifestyle than he should absolutely pay his debts off.  Furthermore paying down your debts in large sums is good for credit history. With that I would be able to take out larger debt in a short amount of time for further investment.  So they are forgiven after you are 51 one years of age? That is crazy for anyone to except."
bbuk,3d1gqx,ed2rummy,4,Mon Jul 13 00:04:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're from the UK or not, be here a student loan is not like a regular loan, it's got nothing to do with your credit rating and no one comes to collect the debt if you aren't making payments (there is a minimum threshold of yearly income that you must be making before payments start getting deducted - £15K or £17K I think). And like SP0oONY said, it gets wiped after 30 years so... It's really not detrimental for an unpaid student loan to be sitting there."
bbuk,3d1gqx,osprey81,2,Mon Jul 13 06:47:02 2015 UTC,"It makes no sense to pay off the student loans unless you think you're going to earn enough between now and the 30 year period for the interest on the loans to matter. Even if you do earn enough for the interest to matter it still might be a bad decision to pay them off, because having a lump sum now is worth more than having small benefits over 30 years.  If it was a different kind of loan then I'd agree that paying off early makes sense, but with student debt 9/10 it makes more sense to keep the debt. In a lot of people's financial situations, paying off the student debt with prize money would literally just be throwing money away.  If the choice is between pissing the £23k up the wall, blowing the money on random shit and paying off the student loan, then obviously the student loan is the better bet... but both are probably bad options.   So they are forgiven after you are 51 one years of age? That is crazy for anyone to except.   What? The fact that it's forgiven at all is a massive boon. You'll never get another loan in your life with such a ridiculously good clause."

Annoyed that she tried to have a go at Christian about money and debt. He had a good point about not having a job. Danny annoying as usual. Joel probably won't crave pizza again for a long time-it was kind of perfect they gave him that task. Nick and Christian didn't do much but were still interesting.

He's kind, genuine, self deprecating, funny, loyal, forgiving, a team player, and not at all materialistic, judgmental or elitist in spite of his wealth... He might be the only person who's never been horrible in a fight with someone, gone back on his word hypocritically or shown to be fake or tactical  But I think maybe my favourite thing about Nick is seeing him live his dream, he's so happy to be there every day and these days that's RARE   ... Plus he deserves it just for putting up with Harry so long and maintaining his sanity :'D"
bbuk,3cxcjp,bellecasey,4,Sun Jul 12 04:45:09 2015 UTC,Yup yup! All of the above!   I think he is braver than the rest. He's such a fan of the show so he had to kown what he was getting himself in for despite his nervousness and insecurities he still went for it and I really really admire that because no matter how much I love the show I'd never be brave enough to do it.   I think he desrves it more than the rest because I think he needs the feeling of acceptance more than any one else. I want him to know people can and do like him for him.
bbuk,3cxcjp,bellecasey,4,Sun Jul 12 08:51:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points. It's really impressive how chilled out he has been about the stressful aspects of the show in spite of his anxiety and introversion.  Plus, he's the kind of winner I prefer because he'll be a quality BOTS guest, guest presenter, timewarp housemate etc. I mean honestly, who would care to see Chloe or Jack again after this?

bbuk,3cxcjp,bellecasey,5,Sun Jul 12 01:08:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with some points on Joel, he's a nice kid and he's really freakin smart but I think he's got some growing and learning still to do. I think he's gotten his head too wrapped up in politics and debate that it makes it difficult for him to have a normal discussion without using political/debating techniques    They just don't like his questions because they are paranoid about their true colours being exposed.   He does phrase questions sometimes in a way that forces the responder into a certain answer (which he has anticipated) in order for him to be proven right... which will stand to him in his career. I think he's treated the whole series as Joel's political audition highlights reel and therefore should not win."

I think he's a decent lad and felt sorry for him going in to loads of cheers as it was kind of predictable we'd think he was a flop. I think he's had the best one liners of the show, which is what I enjoy most about watching."
bbuk,3cxcjp,bellecasey,2,Sun Jul 12 00:00:50 2015 UTC,"I said from week 1 that I wanted Jack to win. That changed when Marc came in, it took a while but I got won over by him. Now he's gone I can see Danny being more and more forceful in arguments, Joel winding people up with hypothetical situation questions and Chloe just being boring. Above all, Jack has maintained the same grateful attitude of the BB process, and is looking forward to his life changing when the series ends. I wish him well, even if he doesn't win, he's over the moon to be in the last week without getting evicted. Bless his little heart."
bbuk,3cxcjp,originalnutta,2,Sun Jul 12 18:15:18 2015 UTC,I just can't unsee his horrible nasty aggressive side. Totally negates his good qualities for me
bbuk,3cxcjp,mistermonstermash,3,Mon Jul 13 02:39:35 2015 UTC,Chloe
bbuk,3cxcjp,bellecasey,0,Sun Jul 12 03:07:36 2015 UTC,"Chloe, because she's ""normal"".  If she's playing a game, she's playing it better than everyone else in the house. If she's not playing a game, she seems like the most likable one of the bunch.  I set my flair on launch night because she seemed ""real"" vs. wanting a reality TV ""career"" and I'm sticking by that. I hate how people use BB as a platform to launch their careers now, or only go in for the prize. I miss the old series' where it was just a bunch of weirdos hanging out on TV for the summer with the hopes that the might win.  EDIT: That was a fast downvote. At least tell me why!"
bbuk,3cxcjp,mistermonstermash,8,Sun Jul 12 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, 'normal', but also boring, weak, thick, hypocritical, and a self pitying crybaby who hides behind other people while they fight her battles unnecessarily because she lets them treat her like a child or a precious snowflake.  Beyond that, what has she actually offered this series in terms of personality, entertainment, growth, interesting relationships, stimulating conversation etc ?"
bbuk,3cxcjp,bellecasey,0,Sun Jul 12 04:38:09 2015 UTC,"This is where I break from what most people want from the show.  I don't care that she doesn't ""offer"" anything, I just think she's better than the rest of the people in there.  You sound like a Helen fan, and Helen is the worst kind of person in my opinion.  Let's agree to disagree. And that's why BB is still such an interesting show."
bbuk,3cxcjp,mistermonstermash,4,Sun Jul 12 04:50:35 2015 UTC,"I don't mean making drama or story lines, if she was funny or interesting I would like her plenty.   I do see your point, I just don't think being present and being generally inoffensive makes a worthy winner over more compelling characters"
bbuk,3cxcjp,joiroy,3,Sun Jul 12 04:56:14 2015 UTC,"being present and being generally inoffensive   So like 99.9% of the general public who watch vs. people who want to be a ""character"" (ie. Sam/Mark).   I just don't think being present and being generally inoffensive makes a worthy winner over more compelling characters   If those characters were real I'd 100% agree with you, but everyone in there is doing what they think net them the prize.   Honestly, I don't think Chloe is a good housemate by any means, but at least she's just being herself. C5 really dropped the ball, the last ""real"" housemate IMO was Josie. Chloe is just a copy of a fax of a copy of that kind of person... I'm not a fan, and I agree with your assesment of her, but she's just the least terrible person in there for the final... OP's post was ""who do you think deserves to win?"" and I pick Chloe because she's...""normal""."
bbuk,3cxcjp,mistermonstermash,2,Sun Jul 12 05:20:32 2015 UTC,"So much yes! Sometimes a pleasant person is just that, pleasant."
bbuk,3cxcjp,Beevo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I could name a dozen housemates from previous series' that I would say should win over Chloe if they were in this house, but right now she's the best of the bunch."
bbuk,3cxcjp,joiroy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:01:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, she's just the most ""instantly likeable"". I don't know her, but I feel like she's the one I'd most want to spend a week hanging out with."
bbuk,3cxcjp,mistermonstermash,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:53:04 2015 UTC,"Ugh! I so agree. I'm not super into drama for the sake of drama. Chloe seems pretty well balanced and like a nice person. Sometimes it's good to just see ""normal"" people and how they get on. Though I kinda got my money on Christian or Nick (if he would just keep his gd finger out of his nose already)."
bbuk,3cxcjp,LemonHerb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:46:06 2015 UTC,"Christian is my 2nd pick for winner just because he's gonna get votes based on his looks. He's also seemed pretty real, like, he tried being fake and playing a game a few times but it always backfired, so he's just given up and and basically been himself IMO.  Nick I don't get. I just find him generally irritating in some way that I can't put my finger on lol."
bbuk,3cwt5s,sadmep,4,Sat Jul 11 13:34:53 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought this was an image of him when he was like 12 years old, he looks so god damn young and I just realised he looks so young."
bbuk,3cwt5s,ProfsOak,2,Sun Jul 12 20:45:12 2015 UTC,Hahaha brilliant!
bbuk,3cwpsg,HeelBatman,3,Sat Jul 11 12:53:22 2015 UTC,"I've never really been able to put my finger on what it is about her that grates on me so much.   But whatever it is, she's still not a worthy winner and everyone on BOTS and stuff that says she is only seem to back it up with 'she's so nice!'. Well, she isn't, in my opinion, but more than that being 'nice' and average shouldn't automatically win you this show when you've offered nothing else all series"
bbuk,3cwpsg,bellecasey,2,Sat Jul 11 15:20:47 2015 UTC,Bare in mind that Marc was the favourite to win the night he was evicted. The bookmakers haven't got things right this series.
bbuk,3cwpsg,SP0oONY,3,Sun Jul 12 03:15:43 2015 UTC,"I think they have the odds all wrong in my opinion. Chloe is the favourite, and Jack is 2nd favourite?! I'm not big on Chloe but do realise she will have a decent portion of voters that will want her to win, but Jack surely doesn't deserve second favourite. He's improving in my eyes but still isn't quite there. Maybe it might be because the public are sympathetic to him that Chloe kinda pushed and bullied him around the past week, and he's obviously too fond of her to stand up for himself.  Odds are drifting on Nick which is quite strange. I think he is worth punting on, Harry's gone so he might open up and be more entertaining. And he's already likeable as he is. The public knows he's genuine and really wants to be there. He doesn't seem to be hated by the public at all, so this could benefit him if there is a decent amount of viewers wanting anybody but Chloe or Danny to win."
bbuk,3cwpsg,TrillTurtle,2,Sat Jul 11 14:32:11 2015 UTC,Odds are drifting on Nick which is quite strange   Everyone keeps forgetting about his mum armed with her phone and her husbands fortune.
bbuk,3cwpsg,Axist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:03:20 2015 UTC,"The odds are totally crazy to me. Yesterday I checked them and it was Danny, Chloe, Jack. What the actual fuck? If it goes down like that this whole series will have been a complete waste from start to finish"
bbuk,3cwpsg,bellecasey,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:29:38 2015 UTC,I think they have the odds all wrong in my opinion   the odds are calculated from previous bets. They don't choose arbitrary numbers while watching the series.
bbuk,3cwpsg,henry82,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:57:25 2015 UTC,"I do wonder about that though. During every episode, the odds are taken down and up afterwards. With whoever looked good in that episode odds shorten and if someone is fighting or being generally disliked the odds will drift."
bbuk,3cwpsg,TrillTurtle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:45:32 2015 UTC,I am fairly confident that Jack would have gone in this episode had they not let the house decide.  The public did not like him at all.
bbuk,3cwpsg,sanyosukotto,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"There were cheers though I thought, and I think he's getting back to being liked. I like him now, that toast comment was comedy gold :)"
bbuk,3cwpsg,TrillTurtle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:47:12 2015 UTC,"this is the issue I have with BB though.  Everyone forgets all the bad people have done throughout a series based on a comment or a good couple days.  Sam was a sweetheart from the beginning of her stay right through to the end and she had to be the one to go.  Meanwhile Jack was a grumpy asshole throughout the entire process, through his friend under the bus ""because Joel did it"", frequently touted what a good person he was for trying to save Chloe. I feel like he is the weakest housemate in the final and probably should have gone earlier in the season.  Maybe he can change my mind this week but I don't think he deserves a win."
bbuk,3cwpsg,sanyosukotto,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:54:04 2015 UTC,If she wins they might aswell cancel bb uk after this shit show

bbuk,3cwpsg,TrillTurtle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:50:49 2015 UTC,I dont see anyone but Nick winning the show.
bbuk,3ctjp3,Crystal-Abyss,24,Fri Jul 10 17:37:17 2015 UTC,Chloe is getting cheers. Fuck these live crowds. Fuck 'em with a rusty boomerang.  Edit: And Harry's going.
bbuk,3ctjp3,bellecasey,5,Fri Jul 10 20:28:08 2015 UTC,And she got upped big time on BOTS yesterday. Blech.
bbuk,3ctjp3,Crystal-Abyss,5,Fri Jul 10 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"She's raising my blood pressure, I swear, and I'm already a pretty stressed dude"
bbuk,3ctjp3,OliverLyndon,5,Fri Jul 10 20:46:36 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if I'm being sadistic or something but I kind of wanted her to be booed so that she knows she did wrong but now she's going to the final and I feel like people could just completely forget the incident and the fact she's a hypocrite.
bbuk,3ctjp3,Crystal-Abyss,5,Fri Jul 10 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's sadistic, it's just a desire for some karma, although they'll likely forget, so much happens in that house, it's easy to. Hell, I couldn't even tell you what I had for breakfast today"
bbuk,3ctjp3,WezVC,11,Fri Jul 10 20:54:44 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, Marc also got cheers.  I know I haven't.  I never will.  </3"
bbuk,3ctjp3,Crystal-Abyss,6,Fri Jul 10 20:29:26 2015 UTC,"Seconded. If it was 'vote to save' then he'd have won the whole thing. Hands down. I know live crowds are no reflection of the voters at home, it just sucks to see how anyone buys into Chloe's hypocritical garbage."
bbuk,3ctjp3,henry82,3,Fri Jul 10 20:32:11 2015 UTC,Marc also got cheers   F
bbuk,3ctjp3,jamielfc1994,14,Sat Jul 11 01:44:38 2015 UTC,That could be the most brutal way of leaving I've ever seen. Unbelievably harsh on everyone
bbuk,3ctjp3,Bananananafish,17,Fri Jul 10 21:09:58 2015 UTC,Danny couldn't wait to get shot of her for 15 grand.
bbuk,3ctjp3,-randomity-,13,Fri Jul 10 21:14:51 2015 UTC,"I always feel sorry for her, even though I don't particularly like her. Her face is like an open book and she has gotten rejected so many times in the house, it's kinda sad. And her exit was the same, everyone was saying her name so she just resigned herself to the rejection and encouraged them. I felt so sad for her just then."
bbuk,3ctjp3,Bananananafish,6,Fri Jul 10 22:05:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she'd grown on me a bit by the end and didn't deserve to go like that. She was doomed whatever the amount of money was, quite a stupid twist."
bbuk,3ctjp3,Axist,8,Sat Jul 11 00:34:38 2015 UTC,"I was really hoping Joel's refusal would turn into a full on rebellion but nope, Danny and Christian were happy to throw Sam under the bus."
bbuk,3ctjp3,ellelelle,3,Sat Jul 11 00:42:22 2015 UTC,"If Danny and Christian were really smart they would've rebelled. Joel knew, I'm sure, that Jack and especially Chloe were bigger threats. A chance to force big brother's hand to remove them would've been better. I'd suspect it was close between Sam and Jack - Jack probably annoys people more."
bbuk,3ctjp3,KentuckyMax,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:34:59 2015 UTC,I felt like it was over for Sam when I saw she got the 15k. If Jack would've gotten the 10 or 15k it would've maybe been a different story.
bbuk,3ctjp3,bellecasey,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:05:12 2015 UTC,"I would've joined and refused to do it. I'm actually shocked at just how quickly and intensely they went straight for the kill, without a hint of guilt or hesitation"
bbuk,3ctjp3,WezVC,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:42:09 2015 UTC,"My first reaction was that I'd have assigned them numbers (1, 2, and 3) and then asked one of the safe housemates to pick one of the numbers.  Fairest way to do it in my opinion, and it completely writes the money aspect out of the equation."
bbuk,3ctjp3,bellecasey,3,Sat Jul 11 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"They're going too far for shock value this season. The great moments are never manufactured, they come from the housemates or the public"
bbuk,3ctjp3,zummerzet,14,Fri Jul 10 21:22:05 2015 UTC,Why did they let the housemates decide? They would have chosen Sam to go regardless of how much money she had
bbuk,3ctjp3,ellelelle,3,Fri Jul 10 21:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was a silly twist, maybe they wanted to keep the others? Jack was probably second in votes."
bbuk,3ctjp3,ScottFromScotland,21,Sat Jul 11 03:36:46 2015 UTC,"Fuck, that 'cash bomb' is brutal.  Sam is amazing."
bbuk,3ctjp3,AcePlague,13,Fri Jul 10 21:07:37 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely the worst thing I have seen on big brother. Sam wasn't the greatest housemate, but no one can deny she's a nice person all round"
bbuk,3ctjp3,WezVC,5,Sat Jul 11 01:04:36 2015 UTC,This last week is going to be so incredibly boring. All the remaining housemates are the original best friend club.
bbuk,3ctjp3,ScottFromScotland,10,Fri Jul 10 21:11:10 2015 UTC,I'm sure Joel will continue pissing people off.
bbuk,3ctjp3,mimre,4,Fri Jul 10 21:11:52 2015 UTC,She is! I've been a fan of hers from day one and it's been tough watching her being rejected by the other housemates time and time again for the silliest things. I wanted her to win but I knew that the public would never be up for that unfortunately.
bbuk,3ctjp3,sackboy-0-0-,12,Sat Jul 11 03:50:36 2015 UTC,"What a rubbish twist.  Poor Sam was going to get picked.  Even if she had £1000,  it wouldn't have made a difference.    The way the twist should have gone: each pick an envelope,  the person with the second highest votes from the public got evicted.  Whatever amount they picked got added to the prize fund.    Or If BB really wanted the housemates involved and make it fair,  all they had to do allocate the amount of money in regard to amount of votes.  So the highest voted housemate got highest prize fund.  Then let the housemates decide.  They would have at least then consider who was hated and liked by the public."
bbuk,3ctjp3,ellelelle,3,Sat Jul 11 02:16:11 2015 UTC,"they should've asked housemates to predict and if they got it right, they get the 15000 grand. That would've been fairer. And technically then the public would have decided."
bbuk,3ctjp3,Alfiedog100,3,Sat Jul 11 03:40:54 2015 UTC,"I agree they would have picked her anyway but I would have loved to see what would happen if Chloe had £50,000 in her envelope.   Then we would see who really cares about the money."
bbuk,3ctjp3,sackboy-0-0-,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:05:03 2015 UTC,Danny would turn on anyone in that house if it gets him more money.  He thinks he's won the show already.

bbuk,3ctjp3,bellecasey,9,Fri Jul 10 20:47:29 2015 UTC,"It's a little sad that she just can't because she's gained too much weight in there (this is NOT me being an asshole, I haven't noticed, but she mentioned this as she took it off after the last eviction and was bummed about it)  I think it was almost like sexy battle armour to her"
bbuk,3ctjp3,Kigurumix,3,Fri Jul 10 20:51:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, I remember her literally ripping it off because she couldn't breathe.  She looks great tonight."

EDIT: Haven't they worked out yet that they should be trying to guess incorrectly so the the housemate with the task actually passes and they get the money?  EDIT2: Fucking hell, Danny completely controlled that eviction. I would have loved it if Chloe had been the biggest amount, would've been so interesting to watch."

bbuk,3ctjp3,Kigurumix,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:04:54 2015 UTC,Not Danny because he just thinks he's already won. Everyone is annoying me in a different way except Christian so I wish he'd win now. I can't see Joel winning anymore because he's such a confrontational twat and I feel like people won't like that. He's always been sort of like that but now he does it in a rude or mean way usually. I feel like Nick has it in the bag.

I'm not from the UK and very curious. What exactly is Irish and Scottish banter? He has used this a lot to justify his jokes and it makes it seem like English banter is more politically correct. How accurate is this? And is it true that Marc's banter is typical of Irish people? Is there a Welsh banter?"
bbuk,3ctjp3,lord_alphyn,2,Sat Jul 11 09:36:10 2015 UTC,"Every area seems to believe they have their own form of banter and that only certain people can handle it.  In reality there are only two types of people, people that can take banter in general and will return it, and people that just can't be bothered with it at all.  I've met tons of people that are exactly the same as Marc in terms of personality and humour, and they're not from Ireland."
bbuk,3ctjp3,086bagofcats,2,Sat Jul 11 13:57:53 2015 UTC,You are right. I know a few Marc types here too and they are definitely very far from Irish.
bbuk,3ctjp3,bellecasey,2,Sun Jul 12 18:20:21 2015 UTC,"It really annoys me that Chloe still doesn't get why people were angry at her. She thinks people think she was selfish.  No one cares if you're selfish, people can relate to that. Everyone went mad because you're a massive HYPOCRITE!"

That's what I assumed at the beginning, but then she started talking about how she's not allowed to hook up with boys or date anyone and stuff, and used it to reject Nick until she went all out with that... For attention, maybe? Weird..."

bbuk,3cs23y,chrissiecott,5,Fri Jul 10 13:13:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's easy to say 'Sam is just trying to have fun,"" but when you have to deal with someone like that 24/7 it can add up. I had my full of Sam weeks ago."
bbuk,3cs23y,farmerwouldsay,5,Sat Jul 11 02:59:34 2015 UTC,"It's not fair of him to snap at her, but he's explained a few times and in his nomination this week too that a lot of her catchphrases and mannerisms really grate on him, so I think it's just a case of personalities clashing over time as patience runs out"
bbuk,3cs23y,bellecasey,3,Fri Jul 10 09:55:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. I don't mind Sam, but I know full well that whenever I hang around with people like that in real life it doesn't take long for me to hate them."
bbuk,3cs23y,WezVC,2,Fri Jul 10 14:50:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's a ploy by Christian because he knows Sam is unpopular and he thinks he knows why. He's trying to ""tell it like it is"". It's fairly playground because he also knows she is not the kind of person to defend herself, and it just makes it more awkward to watch. Her face dropped when he used to word annoying to describe her, and I felt for her then, even though she took it really well and made no apologies."
bbuk,3cs23y,ellelelle,2,Sat Jul 11 03:28:16 2015 UTC,"Sam has a better voice than Cristian and her rhymes are more clever, regardless of her annoying catch phrases."
bbuk,3cs23y,fefe2000,2,Thu Jul 16 16:10:04 2015 UTC,The last couple days in the house Sam has gone out of her way to wind Cristian up.  The songs she made up about Cristian would have pissed me off if I were him.  THe kitchen incident was after the song and Cristian was trying to have a conversation with Chloe about Danny and she started butting in and accusing him of going after Chloe when he wasn't.    Everyone in that house  has problems with sticking their noses in other housemates conversation when they aren't wanted or necessary.
bbuk,3cs23y,Kigurumix,2,Fri Jul 10 22:27:53 2015 UTC,"The sad part is, with that song I think she was trying to impress and have the bantz~ with him.. It was a bit of a flop."
bbuk,3cs23y,ellelelle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:29:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that's exactly what it is.   Also, minor thing - but if you know that someone is constantly writing and singing songs to you, you start to realise that this person must inevitably thinking about and analysing you in order to construct cohesive verses about who you are as a person every single morning. I'm not saying it's 'creepy' - that's not the right word. I'm saying it's unnecessary and downright annoying tbh.  If I put myself in his shoes, I would have without question reacted like he did. #hatinglife"

bbuk,3cppz2,WezVC,19,Thu Jul 9 20:20:32 2015 UTC,"I've no problem with her taking the money, good on her. The problem is when she's spent a week giving people shit over it , when she actually could of given it to the winner as she's been championing for all week. Boring bitch."
bbuk,3cppz2,AcePlague,10,Thu Jul 9 20:56:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly, nobody was mad at Jack or Sam because they have never even suggested that they wouldn't take any money offered to them.  I was actually rolling my eyes when her and Danny made up. He doesn't want to look like a villain because it's so close to the final, so now it's just everybody holding hands with each other. When she said ""I don't think anybody in this house understands each other as much as we do"" I really wanted one of the other housemates to just sort of be like ""Well, hang on..."""
bbuk,3cppz2,WezVC,8,Thu Jul 9 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"I'm behind a little bit, but I just watched Chloe's bit about Danny , nearly threw up. He doesn't think he's superior my arse."

bbuk,3cppz2,the_cucumber,5,Sat Jul 11 09:27:43 2015 UTC,I did she has been the most vocal about the money. She wanted everyone to add to the stash because she thought she was going to win and her only competition was Jack so she bashes him.
bbuk,3cppz2,ed2rummy,4,Thu Jul 9 20:52:10 2015 UTC,"she deserves it, shes a commoner so needs the money. ;)"
bbuk,3cppz2,henry82,3,Fri Jul 10 02:20:40 2015 UTC,"Actually taking the 5k for herself, which is several months pay for her, is a lot different than bitching about someone who pays 2.5k for a frozen pizza.  She is human after all."
bbuk,3cppz2,boobsalad,10,Thu Jul 9 21:36:28 2015 UTC,She's being a hypocrite.. She said at the beginning of the episode how they are all a team and they need to get the winner the most money. Then she just completely contradicts herself and takes the 5k.
bbuk,3cppz2,OddFu7ure,7,Thu Jul 9 23:21:45 2015 UTC,"It wasn't just that though. She has been saying this whole week that they should all ""stick together"" and make the prize fund as big as possible for the winner.  She even complained when jack gave up a mere £100 to get his suitcase back."
bbuk,3cppz2,WezVC,11,Thu Jul 9 21:39:55 2015 UTC,100 quid is a lot of money for some people!!

bbuk,3cppz2,5ACK8OY,3,Fri Jul 10 00:29:55 2015 UTC,And then she sees the 200 and is a complete hypocrite again.

bbuk,3cppz2,ed2rummy,0,Fri Jul 10 14:45:02 2015 UTC,"She was right though. They didn't keep the money. They  wasted it on stupid things. With a week left, no less. And she even said she has no chance of winning so might as well get 5k."
bbuk,3cppz2,originalnutta,17,Fri Jul 10 17:01:49 2015 UTC,It's sad that I like Christian the most just because he seems to be the least hypocritical out of a really bad bunch.

Sorry wtf, I have no problem with people taking the money it shouldn't be a problem but you can't become a sudden hypocrite and cry because people call you out on it. Fuck Danny aswell sucking her asshole and playing this nice guy card, ""she's my sister"" ROFL you told her to shut the fuck up and then pussy out   Jack needs to sort it out, if some bitch like Chloe talked shit all week to me and says ""my opinion has changed of you jack"" I would let rip into that bitch.

Yet when Danny told her to ""shut the fuck up"" she turned into a mouse?  Just like with the Nick and Harry situation, Jack is a fool if he continues to put up with her shite.  I'm quite sad that Chloe didn't walk; like she said, she most probably won't win so what is she waiting for?"

The show started out with less than half of the prize of the american version and now it's a 4th. I feel sorry for the people who had to compete in this and then the last week they are like fuck you we'll chop the prize in half. That is some babyback bullshit.
bbuk,3cppz2,LemonHerb,5,Thu Jul 9 23:31:18 2015 UTC,The prize money in the UK has always been a much smaller amount than the amount in US Big Brother.
bbuk,3cppz2,OddFu7ure,4,Thu Jul 9 23:58:17 2015 UTC,US has 4 times the number of viewers too
bbuk,3cppz2,henry82,6,Fri Jul 10 00:44:26 2015 UTC,"Well America has over 5 times the population of the UK, so percentage wise BBUK is more popular in the country."
bbuk,3cppz2,OddFu7ure,2,Fri Jul 10 03:16:02 2015 UTC,Does it really? Celebrities don't know about big brother or anything here in the US. I thought it was much more popular in the UK.
bbuk,3cppz2,henry82,2,Fri Jul 10 02:32:46 2015 UTC,"I went and looked up the ratings for last year before i posted.  BBUK gets around 1.5-1.6, BBUS gets 6 million viewers /ep"
bbuk,3cppz2,TheFreshPrince12,2,Fri Jul 10 02:37:50 2015 UTC,"So 1.9% of people watch in the US, and 2.3% of the nation watch in the UK. It's around the same percentage, but since the US is bigger I guess they get to up the prize money."
bbuk,3cppz2,henry82,2,Fri Jul 10 02:57:46 2015 UTC,"I think it would largely depend on advertising CPM. Also, having a cash prize 4 times larger might not attract 4 times the audience."
bbuk,3cppz2,OddFu7ure,3,Fri Jul 10 03:01:32 2015 UTC,You could also argue that the BBUS contestants have to do more. They're in there longer and it's more challenging mentally/physically.
bbuk,3cppz2,henry82,2,Fri Jul 10 03:11:20 2015 UTC,"yep, they seem to have more survivor style endurance tasks. Like standing on a pole for hours."
bbuk,3cppz2,bellecasey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:20:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm more of a fan of those types of tasks.. They should implement some of that into BBUK somehow. Awesome name if it's actually Henry by the way..   EDIT: But those tasks would also be more expensive so now I'm thinking maybe not..
bbuk,3cppz2,OddFu7ure,2,Fri Jul 10 04:40:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i'm somewhat impressed that they have the funds to build a new challenge set so often.   The thing is, they're generally physical tasks and benefit those who are stronger.   Each to their own, i currently like the UK version. BBAU can be okay too, BB likes to fuck with the HMs, just is a lot more friendly about it"

bbuk,3cppz2,LemonHerb,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:01:10 2015 UTC,"I do wish bbuk had a lighter version to air as well though. I can't always be arsed to watch episodes every single day and if I get too far behind I tend to give up. This is the first season I watched the whole way through, probably because I'm unemployed right now haha. Where does everyone find the time?? Extend 2 or 3 of the daily shows into a more condensed recap instead of showing every little thing."
bbuk,3cppz2,OddFu7ure,2,Sat Jul 11 09:39:38 2015 UTC,Well I don't have many TV shows to watch.. Usually I have 3 or 4 at a time to watch and BBUK is the only one that comes on daily so I just watch it at night before bed.
bbuk,3cppz2,-randomity-,4,Sat Jul 11 13:11:14 2015 UTC,"The American version is a pile of shit too, it's unwatchable IMO."
bbuk,3cppz2,-randomity-,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:15:07 2015 UTC,"Why is it unwatchable..? It's just a different format, on the US version people want to see manipulators, liars and backstabbers. It's fun to watch people play an amazing social game and still manage to put the knife in everyone's back. If you can watch season 2, 7 or 10 and say it's shit then idk what to say...."

If you agree with a post that contributes to the conversation for all means up vote it but don't down vote a comment because the housemate that is being talked about is someone you don't like, it isn't fair to the users of this subreddit to be attacked for posting a comment, or for their personal views or opinions.."

bbuk,3clr92,Bananananafish,2,Thu Jul 9 02:36:23 2015 UTC,she wanted people to add to the amount after she messed up. Than proceeded falsely bash Jack because she thinks that is her competition for the prize. She also continues to bash other mates in the diary room but never speaks her mind in the house.   She is a gone girl. She owns that house.

It's been obvious since the first time she opened her mouth about hating the money factor of the game. She is like a dog after a bone, and ain't very good at hiding it.

bbuk,3clr92,Crystal-Abyss,10,Thu Jul 9 21:27:10 2015 UTC,She is picking on Jack. I don't think their is anyone more insecure than Jack.  The fact that Chloe did that to Jack and people laughed. If this was reversed Chloe would have flipped shit.
bbuk,3clr92,ed2rummy,7,Thu Jul 9 00:01:05 2015 UTC,She's fake.
bbuk,3clr92,ProfsOak,6,Thu Jul 9 05:22:20 2015 UTC,I hope Chloe is evicted! She's been so self righteous and mean these past few days. I don't want her to win.
bbuk,3clr92,Toridon88,6,Wed Jul 8 23:26:04 2015 UTC,I hate that she's always shitting on Jack for pretty much no reason. I think she doesn't actually like him at all but pretends to be his friend so she can keep up the nice-girl persona. It's just that sometimes she lets it slip how she really feels about him.
bbuk,3clr92,TheFreshPrince12,7,Thu Jul 9 07:06:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's Joel's mission to be ""argumentative and start conflict over nothing"". He just enjoys interesting conversations and hypotheticals and everyone else in the house takes them too seriously.   I agree with Chloe though, I actually liked her at the start of the programme when she seemed quite humble... but ""cash bomb"" has really shown how much she cares about the money. Getting pissy at everyone for effecting the prize money, calling them selfish and greedy, when really they're just having fun... knowing that they probably won't win anyway. Shit, even Cristian and Danny when talking about the suitcases were like ""Yeah, I'd have put down £100 for a chance to get my suitcase back."" While Chloe was ranting about how unfair it was on Danny and Cristain that Jack bid £100.  While the prize money is fluctuating because of the task, it's not real, and in my mind the people desperate to maintain and increase the prizepool rather than enjoying their time in the house look more selfish than those who are having fun with it.   Sam was the big winner today. She had fun doing the task; keeping herself, Jack, Danny and Cristain entertained with jokes and games... and then she put her own enjoyment in the house ahead of increasing the prizepool (even though she also increased the prizepool) by ditching the endurance task and bidding on her suitcase."
bbuk,3clr92,SP0oONY,-3,Wed Jul 8 23:20:09 2015 UTC,"He just enjoys interesting conversations and hypotheticals and everyone else in the house takes them too seriously.   Joel is like a double agent inside the house for BB. Those are the exact type of questions BB asks in the DR and they are specifically designed to get a reaction out of people.  He has looked like an absolute twat the past week and Jack has handed it to him two days in a row. I for one, hope Pie Face keeps shutting him down."
bbuk,3clr92,farmerwouldsay,2,Thu Jul 9 00:18:46 2015 UTC,I was annoyed when she said Jack should not have spent 100 quid to get his suitcase because he doesn't have many clothes anyway. The way she delivered that was mean and condescending.

The fact that Chloe was so bitter and annoyed about it really gave me the feeling that she thinks she's going to win and there's nothing worse than someone who expects to win. I can only hope for a Sam victory right now I suppose. Harry would be a good winner if the Nick issues weren't in play. When she's standing up for her friends and not going off about Nick she's enjoyable. Danny is a bully, Cristian is his second-in-command, Joel is childish, and Nick has gotten boring."
bbuk,3clr92,ellelelle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:34:30 2015 UTC,"I actually don't think Chloe thinks she will win, that's why she had a selfish moment and took the money. She then regretted it because it could make her look bad and even less likely to win. I think she is at the end of her tether because she wants to win but doesn't know how to win and a few people around her don't seem to be taking it seriously (like using up prize fund for football results and pizzas). I'd be annoyed too, but I guess she can't admit how much it annoys her because it would betray the fact that she is there for the money, like everyone else. They didn't go on holiday camp. They went on a gameshow."

Even rewatching bb9 you can tell the difference. These days it sounds like he's doing an impression of himself, rather than narrating naturally.  For example: watch an eviction from any BB on channel 4 then compare it to how it says it on Friday:  JACK, you have been evicted from the big brutha howse, you must leave IMMEEDIAATELY."

bbuk,3cj4da,Axist,6,Wed Jul 8 08:52:09 2015 UTC,I've enjoyed him as a housemate in the last week that's for sure.
bbuk,3cj4da,jamielfc1994,4,Wed Jul 8 11:27:49 2015 UTC,"I think it would definitely be interesting if he won, but I still don't want him to.  I've been rewatching the series and there is a reason why he became hated, he was a complete arsehole for a long time."
bbuk,3cj4da,WezVC,6,Wed Jul 8 11:39:38 2015 UTC,I actually want him to win despite everything. I think he has turned it around a bit with being more free as a person. I felt a dislike towards him when he reacted badly to nominations among-st other things but I think the way he has been lately has been interesting.

bbuk,3ch7ib,clientnotfound,3,Wed Jul 8 10:15:11 2015 UTC,Insta-karma! that whole episode just highlighted her hypocrisy
bbuk,3ch7ib,alaff,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:15:31 2015 UTC,Yes! And her feeble attempt to justify her hypocrisy! Laughable
bbuk,3ch7ib,TheDmac,8,Fri Jul 10 18:59:32 2015 UTC,"What a selfish bitch. Takes 10 seconds to move room so Nick can have a bath but she refuses to move. She then has the audacity to call Joel selfish? ""Peoples selfish sides are really coming out now"" Speak for yourself, Harry!"
bbuk,3ch7ib,MavisJ,6,Wed Jul 8 10:02:25 2015 UTC,"It infuriates me to see her freak out over a single sarcastic comment Nick made in the diary room, yet she can slag Nick off and be as sarcastic as she wants and he's not allowed to feel snubbed?"
bbuk,3ch7ib,bellecasey,17,Tue Jul 7 23:54:16 2015 UTC,"People on BOTS kept arguing that it's Nick's fault for taking it or rolling his eyes behind her back, but who the hell wouldn't roll their eyes? He took it because he was equal parts scared of her and smitten with her, that doesn't make him a bad person or at fault for her bad behavior.   She always takes it that step too far and is genuinely spiteful and horrible to him, when the worst thing he's done to provoke it is try to have silly couple banter with her"
bbuk,3ch7ib,Crystal-Abyss,4,Tue Jul 7 22:07:29 2015 UTC,"Someone downvoted you? I say no to that. Upvoted. Now they'll downvote me, too xD"

bbuk,3ch7ib,dunave,7,Tue Jul 7 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"It's scary how similar Harry acts to Nick and how my mate's girlfriends treats him! Constantly putting him down and then sulking if he ever stands up for himself, leading to him just giving in and apologising!  I wish my mate would do what Nick is currently doing and just get sick of her shit! Seems unlikely though sadly!"
bbuk,3ch7ib,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,2,Tue Jul 7 22:20:45 2015 UTC,"TBH, probably one of the reasons it bugs me too is that my ex would do the same sort of, she wouldn't be so aggressive, I wouldn't stand for that... but when something was wrong... it'd be the same ""no, it's fine..... we're having fun right!"", when it's clearly not, and she'd sulk until it just becomes unbearably uncomfortable!  She is aggressive and malicious and hypocritical ontop of all that though which is vile"
bbuk,3ch7ib,sanyosukotto,3,Wed Jul 8 06:30:03 2015 UTC,I hate her. Nick was having a laugh and she got mad and had a strop for the whole day and then got in jacks business for no reason and she started acting crazy and childish.
bbuk,3ch7ib,henry82,4,Wed Jul 8 18:26:37 2015 UTC,"What she said to Nick at the end of the episode was genuinely one of the most wretched things I've heard someone who was part of a couple in the BB house say.  ""don't you expect to come get in my bed tomorrow...""  I am beginning to think he is a victim to her using him for the air time that shomances guarantee.  If she truly cared about him she would let him sleep with her again even after their differences, after everything she's put him through.  I hope the GBP see it the same."
bbuk,3ch7ib,ProfsOak,5,Tue Jul 7 23:44:49 2015 UTC,"The thing that scares me.... Is that Harry is so fucked up, and Nick is so nice... that they could well make up in tonights episode.... and fall back into this ridiculous ""relationship"""
bbuk,3ch7ib,SmashingRectums,3,Wed Jul 8 06:32:15 2015 UTC,"I knew someone in a relationship like that. He spent much of his time getting in trouble for things that he didn't even know why. It affected him mentally, and put a strain on his other friendships. Despite everyone telling him that she was bad company, it took him over a year to ditch her. As soon as he did, his life improved significantly.   It's kind of frustrating seeing the situation here, because i've seen it before."
bbuk,3ch7ib,SmashingRectums,2,Wed Jul 8 00:20:00 2015 UTC,She actually must have mental health issues
bbuk,3ch7ib,JohnnySwoleCash,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:42:00 2015 UTC,"I can't defend Harry's actions as far as her relationship with Nick stands, but I would like to see Harry win the show or at least make the final. Call me crazy, but over the last couple of days I've grown to appreciate her. I think prior to Jade/Simon/Marc being evicted, she was a little bit overshadowed by bigger characters in the house who were more willing to stand up for themselves and make waves, specifically Marc. Now that it's just her and she truly only has herself to watch out for, she's standing up to people like Cristian. As much as Harry has been an asshole to Nick, Cristian's reasoning for nominating her was COMPLETE bullshit."
bbuk,3cgrf3,BoboTheGoatHobo,17,Tue Jul 7 20:01:17 2015 UTC,Harry hasn't grown past 13 mentally.
bbuk,3cgrf3,WezVC,15,Tue Jul 7 21:48:27 2015 UTC,She is really showing just how bad her issues are in this episode.
bbuk,3cgrf3,086bagofcats,7,Tue Jul 7 21:50:32 2015 UTC,She's mentally unstable and should be removed from the house in my opinion
bbuk,3cgrf3,henry82,3,Tue Jul 7 23:19:06 2015 UTC,"You have to have a few strings loose to be on BB...   ....or be a ""glamour model"" for that matter"
bbuk,3cgrf3,the_cucumber,2,Wed Jul 8 01:43:03 2015 UTC,"She hasn't done any one particularly horrible thing that would warrant removal, unfortunately. After Marc and Helen, she'd probably have to straight up murder someone at this point. But I agree, I wish she were gone. She's brutal."
bbuk,3cgrf3,bellecasey,4,Fri Jul 10 08:40:09 2015 UTC,I'm afraid for her dealing with the boos when she comes out...

bbuk,3cgrf3,ed2rummy,2,Fri Jul 10 08:41:27 2015 UTC,yesterday she said along the lines that you need to earn your keep. I am guessing that selling vag is earning her keep and preverts buying her things is earning her keep too.
bbuk,3cgrf3,jokinson,16,Wed Jul 8 05:38:04 2015 UTC,Nick showing shades of the guy I loved so much in the first few weeks. Probably too little too late though
bbuk,3cgrf3,WezVC,7,Tue Jul 7 21:41:15 2015 UTC,"Nice to see him not just mindlessly agree with and defend Harry, I'm glad he's actually having a chance to get it all out."
bbuk,3cgrf3,dunave,5,Tue Jul 7 21:48:20 2015 UTC,I think it took a lot of pressure from the guest-HMs but it was definitely Jasmine that finally made Nick see what Harry was doing to him!   I thank her for that!
bbuk,3cgrf3,bellecasey,2,Tue Jul 7 22:17:45 2015 UTC,"I think he's making a comeback and I'm so glad. I don't think his fading to the background has been entirely his fault either, the live twitter updates have shown him still having silly fun with the guys and stuff, but BB only puts his stuff with Harry in the highlights"
bbuk,3cgrf3,glassjesoos,14,Tue Jul 7 22:09:13 2015 UTC,Chloe still obsessed with money won't even the food to loose out...
bbuk,3cgrf3,AcePlague,12,Tue Jul 7 21:20:42 2015 UTC,"Spot on, fed up with her now. I liked her before but I've realised how little she's actually contributed too it. Just whining about money now. Like jack said, even if they get the money for the food, BB are going to fuck with the number anyway"
bbuk,3cgrf3,dunave,10,Tue Jul 7 21:32:47 2015 UTC,Because she clearly thinks she might win it!
bbuk,3cgrf3,henry82,4,Tue Jul 7 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"Well, she hasn't really done anything positive or negative inside the house. The HMs generally love her. In the past HMs have won who just cruised to the end not doing anything. After marcs eviction she was probably lying in bed thinking 'ive got a real chance of winning this'"
bbuk,3cgrf3,WezVC,13,Wed Jul 8 01:45:11 2015 UTC,"I don't understand at all. Joel and Jack weren't even being aggressive about it, all they said was ""I want to eat it, but if you don't want to that's fine and we won't"", yet everybody acted like they were being selfish.  If anything the others were being selfish, as they didn't even consider the other point of view/opinions."
bbuk,3cgrf3,glassjesoos,6,Tue Jul 7 21:23:11 2015 UTC,Exactly they were the only rational ones.
bbuk,3cgrf3,Meeha,11,Tue Jul 7 21:24:16 2015 UTC,This show has gone from who I want to win to who I want to lose least.

bbuk,3cgrf3,WezVC,7,Tue Jul 7 21:56:37 2015 UTC,"The way she peaked into the room and was smiling the entire time talking to Nick, fucking hell."

Do people need more reasons to fucking evict her on Friday?"
bbuk,3cgrf3,wiiwierdo,10,Tue Jul 7 21:48:01 2015 UTC,"Her justification now is literally ""I am a hypocrite"". Seriously, she's losing her mind in there."
bbuk,3cgrf3,bellecasey,6,Tue Jul 7 23:43:12 2015 UTC,"Her argument lately is literally ""Stop making me bully you so I look like a bully!"""

bbuk,3cgrf3,dunave,15,Tue Jul 7 21:57:02 2015 UTC,Looks like Danny has picked Joel as his next 'villain' so he can be the 'hero' once again!
bbuk,3cgrf3,WezVC,14,Tue Jul 7 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"I've seriously never seen him bitch so much about Joel until now, I hate that they can all sit there going ""we weren't talking about you"" when they clearly were.  I can't believe these people are still in the house, and I especially lost a lot of respect for Sam. All it took was one person to use the term ""manipulative"" and then everybody else jumped on. Danny could barely fucking say it."
bbuk,3cgrf3,Toridon88,2,Tue Jul 7 21:33:28 2015 UTC,Danny always has to argue with someone. sigh I agree with that!
bbuk,3cgrf3,glassjesoos,7,Wed Jul 8 15:33:24 2015 UTC,Harry is genuinely barmy.
bbuk,3cgrf3,HeelBatman,6,Tue Jul 7 21:47:52 2015 UTC,Harry is actually horrible
bbuk,3cgrf3,henry82,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"I think shes decided she will be the next to go, so just stir a heap of shit up."
bbuk,3cgrf3,dunave,10,Wed Jul 8 01:49:56 2015 UTC,So cocking fed up with Harry!   How 17 people currently on that poll on the other thread want her to win is utterly beyond me!
bbuk,3cgrf3,bellecasey,4,Tue Jul 7 21:28:16 2015 UTC,I think they'll be changing their tune now...
bbuk,3cgrf3,glassjesoos,14,Tue Jul 7 22:11:58 2015 UTC,Chloe and Sam both cannot argue against Joel so they have to call him manipulative.
bbuk,3cgrf3,giz0ku,12,Tue Jul 7 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"I think Sam's stance on that point (and basically everything else) is 'I don't care enough either way to make an issue out of it' - which is fair enough, it might mean she's boring but I don't think it's an inherently bad thing, as Joel was trying to make it out to be."
bbuk,3cgrf3,WezVC,15,Tue Jul 7 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"""STOP OUTSMARTING ME!"""
bbuk,3cgrf3,Toridon88,0,Tue Jul 7 21:32:12 2015 UTC,Exactly what I was thinking.
bbuk,3cgrf3,HeelBatman,13,Wed Jul 8 15:32:01 2015 UTC,Chloe and Danny better not win
bbuk,3cgrf3,WezVC,4,Tue Jul 7 21:41:17 2015 UTC,"I'm really worried that they will, but some of those answers made me feel a little better.  There's nobody in there that I actually want to win, I just really don't want them to."
bbuk,3cgrf3,henry82,2,Tue Jul 7 21:43:56 2015 UTC,"There's nobody in there that I actually want to win, I just really don't want them to.   hahaha this is how i vote in Australia. I always countdown in preferences from the least wanted."
bbuk,3cgrf3,Toridon88,5,Wed Jul 8 01:48:40 2015 UTC,"Chloe, Sam, Harry and Danny are so annoying this week. Danny has always been irritating to me and Harry, but now Chloe and Sam...calling Joel manipulative just because he called her out on being a follower. And Chloe is so desperate for the money, she can't even hide it. Pretending that it's all about teamwork when now the greed is getting to her. Joel was definitely irritating this latest episode, but I still wouldn't mind him, Nick or even Jack winning. They seem to be thinking more clearly than the others. ....Not even going to talk about Harry. She's in need of some serious help. She probably shouldn't have entered big brother, she can't handle stress at all."

bbuk,3cgrf3,JonathanSloanAUS,8,Wed Jul 8 13:22:01 2015 UTC,Just your friendly daily reminder that Cristian is also in the house.
bbuk,3cgrf3,5ACK8OY,2,Wed Jul 8 00:19:33 2015 UTC,Cristian? Christian who? You know it's a rubbish house when Big brother has to make them eat a chill just to get a reaction out of them.
bbuk,3cgrf3,JonathanSloanAUS,6,Wed Jul 8 02:37:02 2015 UTC,I love Cristian. He's unintentionally hilarious.
bbuk,3cgrf3,WezVC,2,Wed Jul 8 05:08:59 2015 UTC,I love the reaction faces he pulls every time somebody says something remotely negative about him.

bbuk,3cgrf3,WezVC,10,Wed Jul 8 13:20:39 2015 UTC,"Yes thank fuck people voted Danny as the biggest gameplayer, glad the housemates got to hear that.  EDIT: Danny telling somebody not to get involved with somebody else's argument? ""Chloe can stick up for herself""? All he ever says is that he feels like he has to protect them, but it looks like that must just be when it's against Marc."
bbuk,3cgrf3,JohnnySwoleCash,2,Tue Jul 7 21:36:57 2015 UTC,probably because Marc would just throw insults etc. plus hes quite intimidating in comparison to the BFG Jack.
bbuk,3cgrf3,RideOrDieRemember,14,Wed Jul 8 00:46:05 2015 UTC,"Joel is getting annoying now. He is so patronizing.  I am gunning for Sam I think she has been the ""cop out"" target for a while and i'm not sure if she realizes it or just shrugs it off.   I think this is the only Big Brother were my opinion changes on most housemates almost every episode."
bbuk,3cgrf3,JonathanSloanAUS,2,Tue Jul 7 21:35:51 2015 UTC,There's always room here on the Sam bandwagon
bbuk,3cgrf3,Crystal-Abyss,7,Wed Jul 8 05:44:47 2015 UTC,"I'm worried Harry may have been broken, like she may have snapped - Noticed it building up for weeks now. I felt Nick's discomfort so much when she peered into the room with that scary smile on her face. I won't even run her down, I'm just saying that I'm genuinely worried that when I sign in tomorrow, she'll have been removed for something proper bad."
bbuk,3cgrf3,mixdkinkster83,3,Tue Jul 7 22:24:11 2015 UTC,All I got from this episode is that Joel loves some takeaway.
bbuk,3cgrf3,MavisJ,9,Wed Jul 8 00:18:26 2015 UTC,"I probably will get downvoted, but I don't mind Joel.  I can see the tone he uses being defined as patronizing,  but I feel like he's just playing devil's advocate.  He's looking for a bit of discussion instead of the, ""let's all be best mates"" circle jerk that's been going on for weeks."
bbuk,3cgrf3,JohnnySwoleCash,6,Wed Jul 8 00:05:16 2015 UTC,"Chloe, Danny, Harry, Christian, Sam can all fuck off."
bbuk,3cgrf3,Toridon88,2,Wed Jul 8 00:46:45 2015 UTC,Agreed. Really not liking them anymore.
bbuk,3cgrf3,5ACK8OY,2,Wed Jul 8 15:37:53 2015 UTC,Don't forget jack.
bbuk,3cgrf3,the_cucumber,2,Wed Jul 8 02:39:25 2015 UTC,Oh snap Joel that was some solid manipulating... that's the first time I've really seen him do it. He'll make a good politician twisting people's words like that wow.  I'm not on Sam's side either but I do see what he did there.
bbuk,3cgrf3,bellecasey,2,Fri Jul 10 08:06:24 2015 UTC,That... doesn't sound like a particularly safe choice
bbuk,3cgrf3,TrillTurtle,2,Tue Jul 7 21:52:32 2015 UTC,"After tonight's episode, I honestly can't see Harry surviving this week's eviction. Think I voted Jack earlier on today in the poll on this page, now I fully support Harry to get the boot.   I think it will benefit Nick massively as well, he'll get to be free from Harry and more fun-loving. I've really liked him over the past few days. Not too sure why, but I really liked how spent 5k for a pass to the final, putting Chloe up. Possibly because he showed everyone that after all it's a game and HE wants to make it to the final, and he didn't care if people thought it was backstabbing or whatever. Might be wishful thinking, but I think Nick will do really well. Either winning it or in the top 3."
bbuk,3cgrf3,Gladiator995,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:10:46 2015 UTC,Harry may be suffering from depression.
bbuk,3cgrf3,WezVC,5,Wed Jul 8 03:06:58 2015 UTC,"I feel like the warning at the beginning might be related to something that gets said later on, most likely directed at Harry."
bbuk,3cgrf3,WezVC,5,Tue Jul 7 21:07:58 2015 UTC,"I missed the beginning, what was the warning?"
bbuk,3cgrf3,Gladiator995,3,Tue Jul 7 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I can't remember completely because I was finishing off a game and listening with one ear, but it definitely had something to do with mentions of mental health."
bbuk,3cgrf3,CRB94,2,Tue Jul 7 21:11:51 2015 UTC,Well it was mentioned on BOTS yesterday or the day before by some expert that she is showing signs of potential depression.
bbuk,3cgrf3,Gladiator995,8,Tue Jul 7 21:14:28 2015 UTC,"I also kind of hated that someone on the panel of BOTS (I can't quite remember who) 'diagnosed' Harry with manic depression. It just seems odd that someone would feel that they have the right to diagnose someone else with something so serious and on TV, regardless of if it is the truth or not."

bbuk,3cgrf3,LemonHerb,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:51:25 2015 UTC,It's probably both. I don't like that she uses her issues as a copout for her shitty behaviour. She is being crazy and refuses to ask for help and that is very hard to watch.
bbuk,3cgrf3,henry82,2,Tue Jul 7 21:23:18 2015 UTC,"that smirk on Joel's face after he has more or less deliberately caused an uproar...he knows exactly what he's doing. Joel believes he is the intellectually superior housemate, and maybe he is, but look how he's using it. Just my own personal theory but I think once Marc left Joel got a whiff of Marc's popularity and decided, in his own way, to emulate him and cause trouble as often as possible. He likes to act the part of the ""voice of reason"" but although his method is different, he is just as much a wind up merchant as Marc was, only more subtle, and he isn't doing it unconsciously, he knows exactly what he's doing. And so far, he's not nominated so he knows he's in the final. As the days go on, watch for that smirk. Smug is such an unattractive quality in someone that young. Cocky little prick."
bbuk,3cgrf3,LemonHerb,-1,Fri Jul 10 08:49:33 2015 UTC,Am I the only person who is starting to want Sam to win only because she is the only person not a raging asshole in the whole house?
bbuk,3cgrf3,henry82,10,Wed Jul 8 08:15:36 2015 UTC,I can imagine sam losing the prize money in a phone scam or something

bbuk,3ciczv,bellecasey,5,Wed Jul 8 04:21:57 2015 UTC,"There is no way people will vote for Sam to win, she has really done noting in that house but be indecisive.  Yes this week is vote to evict but for the final it is vote to win."
bbuk,3ciczv,Kigurumix,3,Wed Jul 8 05:19:17 2015 UTC,Have just chucked £8 in bets on some of the less-obvious housemates after seeing these odds.... as I know how mad the winner can sometimes be!  £1 on Sam to win £51! £3 on Christian for £36 and £4 on Nick for £28!  Remember a few seasons back when I bet £5 on Deana early on because I just had a feeling from BOTS that she would have some psycho fan following! Turned £5 into £60!
bbuk,3ciczv,DavidBowiesGhost,3,Wed Jul 8 06:45:46 2015 UTC,It will be a vote to win. And there is no way Sam will get more than Chloe in that situation.
bbuk,3ciczv,Axist,2,Wed Jul 8 08:54:41 2015 UTC,"Probably bet for Harry to win. She's survived evictions and so far people have been liking the way she's acting now (i dont like it personally but i can see why people might admire her).  EDIT: I dont want Harry to win anymore. Latest episode was too much. I don't want a female to win anymore but if I had to choose, maybe Sam."

bbuk,3cc1t7,WezVC,8,Mon Jul 6 20:29:51 2015 UTC,It's funny that she keeps talking about how she's fed up of hearing about the money when she was the main one having a go at Jack about it when nobody else was.
bbuk,3cc1t7,bellecasey,6,Mon Jul 6 23:23:25 2015 UTC,So glad Nick put her up
bbuk,3cc1t7,jyunga,2,Mon Jul 6 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time judging her. It does feel like she's concerned about the money falling, but at the same time, I'd be pissed at someone being idiotically selfish and doing what Jack did. Regardless of who wins, pissing away the prize fund to make air time annoys the shit out of me. My impressive of Joel went down quite a bit when he bought that pizza."

bbuk,3cc1t7,bellecasey,4,Mon Jul 6 21:52:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like she's just in a constant state of flustered floundering around, she can never fully commit to saying or doing anything"
bbuk,3cc1t7,AcePlague,18,Mon Jul 6 22:46:24 2015 UTC,"I say fair enough to Nick! He loves BB.  Chloe can bugger off being pissy, she showed when she argued with jack all she gives a shit about is the money"
bbuk,3cc1t7,essessemm,7,Mon Jul 6 20:21:19 2015 UTC,Harry threw him under the bus in the diary room.  Ridiculous.
bbuk,3cc1t7,bellecasey,5,Mon Jul 6 23:19:34 2015 UTC,"""I bet you're all about money in the outside too, thinking it'll buy happiness"" was a really low blow, too. It was nothing to do with money"
bbuk,3cc1t7,TheFreshPrince12,8,Mon Jul 6 23:27:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, isn't Nick rich on the outside anyway? He probably needs the money the least."
bbuk,3cc1t7,ellelelle,5,Tue Jul 7 02:06:12 2015 UTC,"Nick had a more valid reason than the other two, but I do see where Harry is coming from. Ideally I suspect I'd prefer to get there more on my own merits but Nick doesn't have that confidence, and he wouldn't have done that if he did. And it is a game, he was trying to play it. Pizza and football results though, come on."
bbuk,3cc1t7,TheFreshPrince12,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:21:55 2015 UTC,"Well he was unfairly nominated. Cristian was desperate for immunity and, based on his reasoning, clearly wanted to nominate Harry but couldn't, so he did the next best thing."
bbuk,3cc1t7,ellelelle,2,Tue Jul 7 16:53:26 2015 UTC,I agree. Christian and Danny were both just desperate for immunity.
bbuk,3cc1t7,bellecasey,5,Tue Jul 7 19:36:55 2015 UTC,"I don't judge him, this will absolutely make his life. Chloe doesn't deserve the final anyway, plus she's barely ever been nominated"
bbuk,3cc1t7,stackablesoup,5,Mon Jul 6 22:51:52 2015 UTC,This is fucking brutal.
bbuk,3cc1t7,jamielfc1994,10,Mon Jul 6 20:42:45 2015 UTC,Hahahaha as if she's had a go at jack for being selfish and then not got rid of her own letter
bbuk,3cc1t7,TheFreshPrince12,3,Mon Jul 6 20:45:19 2015 UTC,"Can't decide who is more of a doormat: Nick or Sam?   Sam thinks ""kill them with kindness"" is going to win her the game... it's not. I hope she wises up because I'd like to see her make some moves."
bbuk,3cc1t7,WezVC,6,Tue Jul 7 16:55:02 2015 UTC,"I was so glad Cristian got his letter read. I've never really been a massive fan of him but this episode made me like him a lot more, he seems to have grown a lot within the house and was fully willing to accept losing his letter even though he is one of the youngest in there."
bbuk,3cc1t7,ellelelle,2,Mon Jul 6 23:26:33 2015 UTC,I think what his family said about a character building experience was very apt. And then when he made the comment about them seeing him in a positive light or something like that actually did disarm me. He is very guarded I think but that was definitely a crack in the veneer. I actually got an idea of who he is.
bbuk,3cc1t7,LemonHerb,2,Tue Jul 7 07:25:05 2015 UTC,I don't understand how anyone can like Nick.  Get your hands out of your face all the time and stop being such a bitch.
bbuk,3ccmeo,MavisJ,5,Mon Jul 6 21:35:19 2015 UTC,"I am an episode behind, but I would love to see Christian go. He bugs the shit out of me. He's so incredibly defensive, but he's willing to talk massive shit about others. When Joel and he were in the bath and Joel suggested the public could see him as selfish, perhaps, he got all twitchy right away and was insulted. He's a prat.   I want to see Harry go. She spends 80% of her time sleeping/closing her eyes/under the blankets. She adds nothing to the house and drags Nick down with her."
bbuk,3ccmeo,jokinson,2,Mon Jul 6 21:49:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you! All my friends like Cristian and it annoys me so much, I dislike him the most by far. He can't take a joke about himself and the way he got so jealous when Jasmine spoke to Danny that time was laughable"
bbuk,3ccmeo,bellecasey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"He grew on me a little the last week, but his over the top Mr Morals act is so offputting.   Also 100% ready for Harry to get out of my face. Tonight she literally said ""DON'T EVEN ARGUE WITH ME"" to Nick during an argument, like no one is even allowed an opinion other than hers"
bbuk,3ccmeo,fefe2000,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:56:20 2015 UTC,"Could not agree more about Christian.  He is overly sensitive and super judgy.  In other news, Chloe is the worst at the game.  Danny is a straight-up douchebag pandering to the cameras and trying to be someone he is not.  Sam is boring as fuck.  Joel has shown himself to be a hypocritical baby.  Jack finally started to act and play with conviction, then succumbed to peer pressure.  At this point, I think I am Nick for the win."
bbuk,3ccmeo,ZombieDonShula,6,Tue Jul 7 05:24:04 2015 UTC,"I'd like Danny to go but I'll settle for Jack.  Sam, just like Eileen, has never received a legitimate nomination yet has been up every time. I don't particularly like her but she's done an excellent job ignoring the fact that she's ganged up on at every turn."
bbuk,3ccmeo,bellecasey,7,Mon Jul 6 22:36:49 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have nominated her for the annoying, cringey catchphrases and cliche speeches which to me is extremely legitimate hahaha"
bbuk,3ccmeo,ZombieDonShula,2,Mon Jul 6 23:00:34 2015 UTC,"If they're willing to nominate her for saying hashtag, don't you think they will nominate her for anything? I mean people are getting into knock-down drag out shouting matches but she's still nominated every week, coincidentally along with the other newbies, for that?  Or wait my favorite is the one she usually gets, ""I'm just closer to everyone else."" If that's not a crock of shit answer idk what is."
bbuk,3ccmeo,bellecasey,2,Mon Jul 6 23:12:14 2015 UTC,"Sure, but if her catchphrases annoy me this much I can only imagine it frustrates them enough to want her out more than the others. You can make up from a fight and fully move on, but annoying habits are more consistent"
bbuk,3ccmeo,bellecasey,3,Mon Jul 6 23:15:13 2015 UTC,"The panel was horrendous! Did even one question get properly answered? One just rambled about star signs, Aisleyne started talking about Nick to answer a question about Sam and they all uncontrollably laughed, interrupted each other, forgot the questions or didn't understand them hahaha   Good to see Marc though"
bbuk,3ccmeo,Beevo,6,Tue Jul 7 04:48:21 2015 UTC,"Jack, I just don't like him.   He seems to whine a lot more than he used to.   Will stab a friend in the back, and is looking more and more selfish as the show goes on.   He KNEW he was breaking a rule eating a pastry, but then bitched and cried when called on it.   When everyone agreed to go running around through the set and behind the scenes he pussed out.   After everyone was upset about Joel making a mistake over the pizza/money thing, Jack jumped at the opportunity to spend more money to get some clothes when he walks around in that damn bath robe 90% of the time anyway."
bbuk,3ccmeo,ed2rummy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:49:23 2015 UTC,"Jack, selfish? he probably is one of the least. He is beyond insecure. He cares way to much what other people think.   What are you going to expect from an obese person when you dangle sweets in front of a starved fat boy. Food is an addiction just any other drug.   He even felt so sad that he went back in to break his request. He probably just did that because that money kept going lower and be a contributor affected him.  Fuck Chloe, only her true colors are showing."
bbuk,3ccmeo,CRB94,6,Tue Jul 7 05:06:48 2015 UTC,Would anyone else like to see Rylan replace Emma sometime in the future?  I think he's improved loads.
bbuk,3ccmeo,bellecasey,2,Mon Jul 6 22:26:27 2015 UTC,A lot of people still find him grating but I agree he's improved. He's great campy fun but can also be really sharp and serious when he needs to be  Although Emma is queen
bbuk,3ccmeo,CRB94,3,Mon Jul 6 22:59:02 2015 UTC,I think he is everything Brian Dowling should have been.  I just worry that Emma will leave with all the other stuff she seems to be doing nowadays especially with the BBC.

Why was it OK for Joel to be greedy and not for Jack?  I don't understand.  It's a game that promised a huge pot of gold at the end."
bbuk,3ccqvo,fefe2000,4,Tue Jul 7 05:34:47 2015 UTC,Joel is pretty much doing the same

bbuk,3ccqvo,LemonHerb,7,Tue Jul 7 01:57:28 2015 UTC,The weak lie is what got me. He was kinda drunk on his own power.. and then meek w hen he realised he was answerable for it. Classic politician right there.
bbuk,3ccqvo,ellelelle,3,Tue Jul 7 07:05:56 2015 UTC,"Why is the public so against Sam? Right now she's probably my second favorite behind Cristian. She keeps getting booed, but I'm not sure what she's actually done."

I think Jack would have gotten massive points if he had worked out with the boys and tried to better his health while in the house.

Nice to see Jack still showing some personality at least. I think it would be hilarious for him to have another complete turnaround with the crowd.   EDIT: Everything Danny just said about the diary room is an absolute lie. It's always Marc saying ""I like Danny but he's playing a game"" and Danny saying ""I hate Marc he's a dick""."

bbuk,3c6ljr,velox_mortis,2,Mon Jul 6 07:27:13 2015 UTC,"At least there is only a week left.. Without marc the show is back to watching sesame street, to quote marq."
bbuk,3c6ljr,OddFu7ure,2,Mon Jul 6 03:20:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have a problem with that. Unlike the other HM's who seem to blend in with the furniture, he actually provides entertainment."
bbuk,3c6ljr,TheDmac,2,Sun Jul 5 10:46:27 2015 UTC,"Goddammit, the house just feels so empty watching the cash bomb episode without him."
bbuk,3c6ljr,TrillTurtle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:27:11 2015 UTC,Doubt it. People paid money to evict him.
bbuk,3c4pdl,MotionEyes,9,Sat Jul 4 19:29:57 2015 UTC,"It's vote to evict.  All of Marc's fans would have spread their votes amongst the other 3 whilst the people that didn't like him all focused their votes on him.   Because he has such a strong personality it drew attention to him and allowed the others to sort of coast by. People either really loved him or really hated him, whereas they would have been indifferent about the rest.   Vote to win would have had a very different outcome."
bbuk,3c4pdl,WezVC,3,Sat Jul 4 23:47:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, vote to evict ruined it. Vote to save, he would have never been evicted-even Jade would've stayed. So many people would've been saved if it were not for vote to evict."
bbuk,3c4pdl,Toridon88,2,Sun Jul 5 11:53:50 2015 UTC,But vote to evict CAN work if you don't make it multiple candidates. Put 2 people up and make their fans fight it out.
bbuk,3c4pdl,Beevo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:15:23 2015 UTC,Ah I see that's a good point.
bbuk,3c4pdl,Toridon88,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:39:42 2015 UTC,But then it is manipulated with whoever has the most fans. People should use there vote to actually evict the person they like the least.
bbuk,3c4pdl,spudral,3,Mon Jul 6 18:06:35 2015 UTC,And that's why I don't like multiple candidates on vote to evict. It should be 2 people up for eviction and the public can vote between them. Splitting the vote is bad for the show (IMO).
bbuk,3c4pdl,Beevo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:37:40 2015 UTC,"SO on the list of people up there, you have nothing you could label Marc as.... Marc... The Marc from this show... Nothing bad to say? Class act, A+ Housemate, deserved the money, great entertainment, love his personality? Because in my mind he is maybe the biggest asshole the show has ever seen, a self proclaimed prick, started arguments daily for no reason and treated many people, maybe all people, especially the women in the house like absolute trash.  What you wrote up there is pretty much Marcs view of everyone in the house for the most part. Marc, while being the biggest personality in a house of very dull people, was also the most repulsive. If this was a scripted show I could see loving to hate Marc. But this is someone doing these things to real fucking people. Nah. Not a winner. Not a good house mate. Not missed."
bbuk,3c1cru,Crystal-Abyss,17,Fri Jul 3 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched Big Brother since about 2011 I'd say, and the evictions have been seriously pissing me off. How can you vote out Marc instead of Harry, or even Jack although he's improving. Marc was the show to be honest, and although I will watch it I won't really care for it I'd say.  It might be because I'm Irish, but I thought Jade and Marc were brilliant housemates and the most undeserved evictees. It's extremely annoying to me that HM's with great, strong personalities get voted out instead of dull, boring, moaning HM's who seem like they don't want to be there."
bbuk,3c1cru,TrillTurtle,6,Fri Jul 3 21:34:02 2015 UTC,"They always vote out the most interesting housemates. When I think of a BB viewer I think of a fat, chain-smoking, middle-aged to old woman that reads gossip magazines and types incoherent messages on facebook about dailymail articles. I think of stupid people."
bbuk,3c1cru,Tayschrenn,2,Sat Jul 4 02:57:05 2015 UTC,"I wish voting was free to vote, and Irish people could vote. That'd possibly broaden the voting audience."
bbuk,3c1cru,TrillTurtle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:50:26 2015 UTC,i see where you're coming from but irish people have won in the past and the vote has never been open here. the voters either like you or they don't and that's fair enough. gonna miss his silly arse dancing around the house though.
bbuk,3c1cru,deathbelle,3,Sat Jul 4 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"Too right, it's complete BS, I couldn't agree more without turning into a parrot. My face was quite a picture when it was announced, and it's quite an injustice too because if they we voting to save then he'd still be in there. My post isn't even loyalty to the show though, it's more a loyalty to my favourite sub. Either way, we've been entertained"
bbuk,3c1cru,TrillTurtle,2,Fri Jul 3 21:38:36 2015 UTC,"This is a brilliant sub! I joined reddit about 2 weeks ago just to post in this sub!  I wish they could just offer the public to vote to bring back a housemate. Although it'd be unfair and obviously the producers needing a boost in entertainment, I would definitely welcome the return of Marc ;_;"
bbuk,3c1cru,gotbeff,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:48:52 2015 UTC,Agreed. I can't even say I care who wins anymore. I'm totally not bothered.

bbuk,3c1cru,LemonHerb,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"I'm interested, how would this go about?"
bbuk,3c1cru,TrillTurtle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:11:04 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, it would be hard.  Generally you could just link to an episode, people watch and discuss an episode per day etc.  But I am sure this sub has rules against linking to episodes since it would be pirating, and it doesn't seem 4od has any of the older series to watch.    Looks like 5od has back to 2011 up to watch so that could be do-able."
bbuk,3c1cru,LemonHerb,2,Sat Jul 4 00:18:32 2015 UTC,I mean most is up on YT as far as I'm aware. Definitely up for it.
bbuk,3c1cru,TrillTurtle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:07:39 2015 UTC,"It is, all of it, but this sub might have rules against linking like that.  I would say start from season 1, but that's a tough watch IMO."
bbuk,3c1cru,LemonHerb,5,Sat Jul 4 01:10:10 2015 UTC,"Perhaps after this series and probably also the celebrity series has finished, dependant on when it starts, we can think about doing something like this! It might be difficult to organise but it would be wonderful if it works well."
bbuk,3c1cru,deathbelle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:13:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen season 1 actually, why do you reckon it's a tough watch? I started watching at season 4 I think, and kept watching till the season with halfwit, although I wasn't too involved in that season.  This is the first season since then I've seen."
bbuk,3c1cru,bellecasey,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:43:45 2015 UTC,"The format is a lot different, it isn't nightly shows of the same length.  At least from the copy I have seen on youtube it's like 1 or 2 hour long shows a week, with random length 4 to 10 minute episodes in between.  Also nothing seems to happen.  I think season 4 is where it starts to get the format we see today but I could be wrong."
bbuk,3c1cru,TheDmac,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:58:21 2015 UTC,we could set up a private sub to watch youtube maybe? even with hola i wasnt able to watch on demand so i watch it on there
bbuk,3c1cru,WezVC,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:14:55 2015 UTC,BB7! Or I've been wanting to watch Chantelle's CBB and Jade Goodys series
bbuk,3c1cru,henry82,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:26:29 2015 UTC,That's a great idea. Sticky a post everyday with a YouTube link or something to the episode.

bbuk,3c1cz7,muffsponge,4,Sat Jul 4 06:56:50 2015 UTC,Makes me think. Maybe they should do votes to evict and stay at the same time. I think we'd get much more balanced results.
bbuk,3c1cz7,ellelelle,2,Sat Jul 4 09:21:48 2015 UTC,I'd say vote to evict is the most lucrative for them.

bbuk,3c1cz7,deathbelle,-1,Fri Jul 3 22:52:31 2015 UTC,fuckin devastated he's gone. at least they are gonna put up the prize money for the dish cloths to fight over next week.
bbuk,3c1h6s,MerroStep,5,Fri Jul 3 22:03:02 2015 UTC,"Only 1.2% separated Helen and Ashleigh so it wasn't exactly comfortable.  I do think that with last year, there was no real massive contenders, only really Helen and Ashleigh.  Perhaps whenever Helen's friends got evicted like Pav and Ash etc, maybe their fans directed their votes to her?    I do agree that with the later statement however.  For me let Helen win over somebody dull like would've happened before.  The Channel 5's edition of BB likes to create disruption as oppose the Channel 4's so obviously the people who are more disruptive will gain a following."
bbuk,3c1h6s,CRB94,7,Fri Jul 3 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"I watched the whole series hoping they would just throw Helen out, hated her the whole time."
bbuk,3c1h6s,LemonHerb,3,Fri Jul 3 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"People were protest voting for her to win, because they hated the fact that she was given a free ticket to the final. ""If you are gonna change the rules we will vote for a nasty bully bitch to win the show"". Channel 5 did not get the point though."
bbuk,3c1h6s,Klaent,3,Sat Jul 4 14:13:16 2015 UTC,I don't think channel 5 cares. money talks  Also protest voting sounds pretty retarded.
bbuk,3c1h6s,henry82,6,Sun Jul 5 02:34:49 2015 UTC,Helen would have been out in the first couple of weeks if she didn't get immunity to the final.
bbuk,3c1h6s,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,3,Sat Jul 4 01:26:15 2015 UTC,I think I recall Tamara being nominated for associating with Helen and was the first evicted.  Without the pass I think Helen would've been first boot.
bbuk,3c1h6s,boobsalad,2,Sat Jul 4 08:04:39 2015 UTC,"Vote splitting, same reason Marc was evicted.  Ash/Chris fans had their votes split between 2 while Helen was all on her own."
bbuk,3c1h6s,Branfip81,3,Tue Jul 7 15:52:25 2015 UTC,"Through her bully tactics, vile & trashy behaviour and free pass to the finale, she somehow won. I'm still mad about that 1.2% that helped her win over Ashleigh. It's sad that her disgusting behaviour in the house was rewarded and considered as entertainment by the British Public . FUCK PAULINE for giving Helen a pass on launch night lol"
bbuk,3c1h6s,dee-vee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:12:56 2015 UTC,"I never voted, but as soon as she walked into the house (before she opened her mouth), i picked her as the winner.  If it wasnt for the pass to the finals, and the fact they edited her in the final week to be a changed person, she wouldn't have won. She was very memorable though, and very entertaining."
bbuk,3c1h6s,henry82,-1,Sat Jul 4 05:51:04 2015 UTC,Helen won over the last 15 mins of the show. She made up with Ashleigh in that time and showed she might actually have a nice side and that won it for her.
bbuk,3c1h6s,spudral,2,Fri Jul 3 22:55:00 2015 UTC,"even though that ""nice side"" was totally fake"
bbuk,3c1h6s,dee-vee,2,Sat Jul 4 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"I think she won when they froze the lines and all the votes for Pav and Ash were evicted, when the lines opened up again all their votes shifted to Helen, while if Christopher had gone before all his votes would've gone to Ashleigh."
bbuk,3c1aqr,Jordy_Banks,11,Fri Jul 3 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"Not watching anymore either.  It has to be a fix, I get the whole ""just because you don't get what you want"" argument, I even said that with Helen last year, but how did Marc go?  I mean, the top comments on Facebook posts were all supportive of Marc, his picture got the most likes on FB, the most retweets on Twitter, he gets the biggest cheers from the live audience.  There is no way you can convince me that tonight was not fixed so that their golden boy Danny would win."
bbuk,3c1aqr,DibsBrown,17,Fri Jul 3 21:20:09 2015 UTC,"I'm also gonna stop watching but I'm sorry; to claim it's some sort of conspiracy is complete bullshit.  It's not a vote to save, it's a vote to evict. So although I might love Marc and a lot of others share my opinion, he is a controversial person and is probably as disliked as he is liked."
bbuk,3c1aqr,I4gotmypasswords,12,Fri Jul 3 21:23:57 2015 UTC,"It was a vote to Evict, Mark was hated and loved, if it was a vote to save he'd win and Sam would be out, too many people disliked him"

bbuk,3c1aqr,Klaent,2,Sat Jul 4 09:18:36 2015 UTC,"If anything they wanted Harry out, she got so much negative air time this week. Marc is just a huge cunt and even the producers couldnt get him to stay."
bbuk,3c1aqr,DibsBrown,-1,Sat Jul 4 14:16:32 2015 UTC,I cannot be convinced now that more people dislike Marc than Jack or Harry no matter how controversial he is.
bbuk,3c1aqr,henry82,6,Fri Jul 3 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"Don't touch me i'm gay   Really disappointed he left, but oh well, it's a show."
bbuk,3c1aqr,RoloisRight,7,Fri Jul 3 23:36:48 2015 UTC,"Vote to evict is tough. I think the logical explanation would be that the votes were split. Even if Marc had more supporters than the other 3 combined, it's possible his supporters split their votes too evenly between the other 3 while the other 3's supporters all voted to evict Marc. This is under the assumption that fans of Harry and Jack probably hated Marc the most of the choices. Sam probably doesn't have enough supporters to make a difference. That's just my guess.  Ultimately, it's a huge disappointment. Whether you liked Marc or not, he brought a lot of entertainment and the last few weeks are when the house really needs it. It would've been nice to keep him until the last week at minimum."

bbuk,3c1aqr,OddFu7ure,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:55:21 2015 UTC,DibsBrown had a genius idea as to why he is gone. That is because the people who liked marc voted for harry/jack but the people who disliked him just voted for him obviously.

Nice isn't a requirement to win, I'm just saying calling women a cumbucket and treating others like shit doesn't make me want to watch you and give you money. I'd lean Danny and Nick to win. Maybe Joel. Again, it would be the ""weakest"" winner of any season I watched, but it's what we got. This is big brothers producers fault.

I love a good task, a good conversation, an observation of people. Yea, this isn't an enthralling cast, I dislike more than half of them. But like I said. Let's see if the producers can do their job and make it a show about more than just bickering. They use to be great at it."

bbuk,3c1aqr,Bunny_ofDeath,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:35:07 2015 UTC,He pokes and prods people to start fights and stir shit for airtime. That old guy from a few days ago nailed it. Ignore him. Pretend he's not there. It's all a show so he can get attention. It's not genuine.
bbuk,3c1aqr,Karmarghh,-1,Sat Jul 4 19:19:20 2015 UTC,"The one time I saw him actually being a nice person expressing a real opinion was when he was comforting Aisleyne. I don't like most of the housemates this year, but Marc was overbearing and blatant about both his need for attention and his complete disregard of the feelings of others.   Yes, he didn't care who he offended, and he called this ""honesty"", but he's honest in the same way Helen was, aka the way a mean spirited, overly-set-in-their-way grandmother will say they're ""laying their cards on the table"" and then proceed to spit out vitriol in the name of the Great God Truth.  I would like anyone who hates Helen but likes Marc to really think about why one is good, but the other is bad."

bbuk,3c06iy,shutitleonard,3,Fri Jul 3 20:20:21 2015 UTC,"Totally agree! Britain should be voting for their winner from the start not for the worst of the lot. When the season wraps, the winner isn't the most loved, they're the least hated out of the remaining HMs. BBAU votes to save and shows the voting percentage for the first half of the evictions, which is a better format for the viewers. Even though BBUK is vote to evict, it's still leagues better than BBUS."

bbuk,3c06iy,ellelelle,2,Fri Jul 3 20:25:44 2015 UTC,Funny how these boos/cheers affect people!!!
bbuk,3c06iy,kingoftheplankton,10,Sat Jul 4 11:12:01 2015 UTC,Fucking fair play Jack. Danny really can't take it but he's happy enough to dish it out. Huge fraud
bbuk,3c06iy,WezVC,11,Fri Jul 3 20:13:30 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I think Jack might have got a few supporters there, although it might be too late.  ""It's not like that, we have a brother sister relationship"". You've known him for what, a day?  Also loving the killer Marc and James combo.  EDIT: Fucking yes Jack, he shouldn't take that from Joel. Throwing food at somebody? I love that it took Marc less than half a day to completely break them, and all he did was tell Jack to eat a croissant."
bbuk,3c06iy,tvwatcherguy,7,Fri Jul 3 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"""Listen to me as a female a decade older than you!"" - some z lister, patronising yoke of a thing!"
bbuk,3c06iy,WezVC,8,Fri Jul 3 20:15:22 2015 UTC,She keeps using her gender in the worst situations and just ends up looking like an idiot.

bbuk,3c06iy,FreydNot,3,Fri Jul 3 21:08:15 2015 UTC,The Great British Public has spoken.
bbuk,3c06iy,MABGB,14,Fri Jul 3 21:08:53 2015 UTC,Joel's been a bit of a prick these last few days
bbuk,3c06iy,CitizenJaggers,3,Fri Jul 3 20:28:46 2015 UTC,"I think Joel was 100% on point. You do a task, you are hours away from winning it most likely and he eats a bite of roll and losses it for everyone else in the house. He took a bite of food that cost the rest of the house a week of food. If I was Joel I'd be more harsh. Weak willed Jack."
bbuk,3c06iy,MABGB,2,Sat Jul 4 04:45:00 2015 UTC,"I found Jack funny and entertaining last night. Throwing food wasn't acceptable either. If roles were reversed people would call Jack out for it saying he's always moaning, they had lost the task because Harry the day before anyway and Jack wouldn't have done it if he thought they would lose it solely because of him."
bbuk,3c06iy,ellelelle,3,Sat Jul 4 09:00:44 2015 UTC,I agree but I think Jack rage-ate it when he saw that the others thought he was capable of it. That's even more petty. What sort of a prank did he think he was pulling anyway.. no one was going to find that funny. He was just being bitter and frustrated.
bbuk,3c06iy,the_cucumber,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:16:45 2015 UTC,I feel like bb called out Harry just so that everyone would go easier on jack. If he'd lost it alone he'd probably be driven to self evict.
bbuk,3c06iy,BoboTheGoatHobo,10,Thu Jul 9 02:05:42 2015 UTC,They really need to make evictions Vote to Sav. Neutral people benefit while any sort of exciting character is worse off through Vote to Evict because no ones gonna waste their single vote on someone who they don't care about either way. BB has taken great effort (often unfairly) to keep divisive characters in this year yet the whole voting system to set up to get rid of them as soon as possible. R.I.P Marc
bbuk,3c06iy,Kigurumix,4,Fri Jul 3 21:11:58 2015 UTC,They use vote to evict because it makes it so every housemates fans can influence the outcome of every eviction.  Vote to save tends to center around each nominated housemate and really only their fans will vote.  In Marc's case I think he was a victim of most other housemates fans voting to evict him whereas his fans had to spread their votes around the other nominees.  It sucks but it is the way bbuk has always done the regular seasons of big brother.
bbuk,3c06iy,WezVC,3,Fri Jul 3 21:28:28 2015 UTC,This... makes a lot of sense.
bbuk,3c06iy,FreydNot,3,Fri Jul 3 21:36:15 2015 UTC,It's all about the money.  Vote to evict generates more calls and thus makes them more money.
bbuk,3c06iy,CRB94,19,Fri Jul 3 21:32:34 2015 UTC,"I fucking hate this show.  How is Marc gone, there goes all the fun in the house.  Now two weeks of boring laid back chatter."

Entertainment is one thing, but I'd rather have two weeks of chat (where BB should be giving entertaining tasks that they are failing at real hard this season) than 2 weeks of some wanker treating normal people like shit."

Like /u/tvwatcherguy said, some of the most fun I've had has been coming on here and discussing it with you guys!  I'm hoping BB have some plans for the last few days though because I really think most of the housemates have got so much more to give. Jack showed more character in tonight's episode alone than the entire series."

bbuk,3c06iy,shutitleonard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:11:37 2015 UTC,"I LOVED Nick at the start. He was self-deprecating, funny, and endearingly awkward but he alters his behavior based on everyone else's opinions. I'm looking like a bed-hopper? Well I'll lay off Jade. Harry's a demon and Nikki loves me? Well...snuggle time with Nikki! Harry walks all over me, you say? Well it's time to stand up! It's good to listen to others' perspective but there's no reason to let them completely guide your behavior. However, it could just be the edit and he finally got fed up with Harry after trudging through the emotional quagmire of their relationship."
bbuk,3c06iy,ellelelle,0,Sat Jul 4 11:19:09 2015 UTC,"I really wish that Harry had been evicted instead of Jade, even for Harry's sake as she is really doing herself no favours but to be honest, Nick had begun to present himself in a bad light even before her arrival. He was already showing himself to be a bit flaky with Jade and he just did the exact same thing with Harry when she came on the scene - except he stood up less for Harry than he had for Jade - never mind that other housemates were throwing the exact same stuff at Harry as they did at Jade. He was just another one intimidated by Marc. He's just a flake."

It's been the most desperate BB series I've seen in a while, chucking in old housemates to try and claw back some sort of popularity. It's been so dull, Marc changed things up, yeah, but I still didn't even like him enough to be fully into the show. What even was this series?"
bbuk,3c06iy,ellelelle,2,Fri Jul 3 21:08:45 2015 UTC,it was a flop.

bbuk,3c06iy,WezVC,6,Sat Jul 4 04:43:23 2015 UTC,"I just shows who's calling and voting.  He had clear cheers from the crowd whilst the rest had boos, yet he was still evicted."
bbuk,3c06iy,CRB94,2,Fri Jul 3 21:09:17 2015 UTC,"Who is calling and voting?  Why is there such a massive difference between online views and those who actually vote?  Go on here or twitter, Marc's the clear favourite but he gets kicked off.  It's bizarre."
bbuk,3c06iy,WezVC,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:10:37 2015 UTC,Did you vote?
bbuk,3c06iy,CRB94,0,Fri Jul 3 21:12:43 2015 UTC,No but that's what i'm saying.  All of us with Marc in our flair and know that he's a great housemate don't vote and rely on those who do vote.  I personally don't know anyone who votes but I think those that do are one's that like the bores because they're nice... and dull.
bbuk,3c06iy,TheDmac,2,Fri Jul 3 21:20:29 2015 UTC,"It would take far too many people to save him. As it's been said before, all the other nominee's fans would have voted Marc out. Whereas us Marc fans spread our vote. Marc fans didn't (and obviously couldn't) band together and focus all our votes on one person to ensure they go and Marc stays :( If it was vote to stay Marc would have been fine and probably won."
bbuk,3c06iy,WezVC,3,Fri Jul 3 21:23:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do agree, but it's vote to evict and Marc stirs way more in people both positively and negatively because he has such a big personality, whilst others can just coast by.  He truly is Marmite."

bbuk,3c06iy,TheFreshPrince12,7,Fri Jul 3 21:26:12 2015 UTC,"This episode had my blood boiling from start to finish. The most annoying part was Jasmine acting like a whore while Danny just sat there and let her jump in his bed. Then he got mad at Cristian for feeling mugged off. I was, however, very pleased with Jack for calling them out.   Then I was angry again when Cristian made up with Jasmine, making himself look like a mug. He knows what she is. But hey, he's definitely gonna win now because Jasmine said she'll use her influence!!..lol who is she, again?   I continue to hate Joel more and more because he has become such a pompous ass. Putting your fingers in peoples' faces is one of my pet peeves and he does that a lot; it's incredibly rude. Him throwing food at Jack was way out of line. I don't think he was just acting the part for the task; I genuinely think the power has gone to his head. He's a prick now. Chloe, too, is annoying. I'm tired of watching that baby-faced idiot mouth off at people.  The housemates and their ""revolts"" are childish and annoying. They knew they were going to obviously fail the task and still acted like fools. Also, them running up the stairs while Marc was exiting was annoying. I think now that there are no ""legends"" in the house that BB has to appease, the hammer will finally come down... hard and punishments will start being doled out in force.   With Marc leaving, I don't really care for the house. Surprisingly, I think I want Jack to win. He is beginning what seems to be a slow, but steady turnaround in the house. If he can control his temper, I think he has a shot. It would make for a good ""journey"" story. He has his outbursts, but I noticed that when he calls people out, he's usually right. He's pretty in tune with the house, even if he is a complainer.  Oh and get ready because the rest of this season is going to be housemates being patronized by Daddy Danny."

His hero complex and self-righteousness drive me up the wall. He also has gotten away with being the biggest ladies' man in the house with Sarah, Jade (if it got counted against her, it gets counted against him), Sam, Helen, and Aisleyene while Jade and Nick get all the heat. He has been completely insincere with all of them and with everything coming out about him, it shows the lengths he goes to ensure air time and the perceived win. As much as Marc toyed and emotionally picked at women, so did Danny. Sarah must be breathing a sigh of relief, realizing her (and her son) dodged a massive bullet."
bbuk,3c06iy,tvwatcherguy,5,Sun Jul 5 02:08:38 2015 UTC,"I know I seem bitter but I just can't comprehend how the British public thought that seeing Harry and Nick arguing, Jack complaining and Sam doing nothing would be more entertaining than Marc!"

bbuk,3bwrnc,WezVC,2,Fri Jul 3 05:10:06 2015 UTC,"I'm probably biased but Marc is always the bigger man by trying to clear the air, and I think he genuinely regretted calling her those things so didn't want her to think he meant them.  Even though he probably did."

bbuk,3bwrnc,tvwatcherguy,7,Fri Jul 3 01:09:54 2015 UTC,I wonder does Christian know how big of a moment not moving to the other side of the bed was? I reckon he's done himself loads of credit in jasmines mind with that one!  Especially since she was impressed how he wasn't intimidated by her.
bbuk,3bwrnc,Meeha,3,Thu Jul 2 20:58:45 2015 UTC,I think it was mainly because he cant hear with his left ear.
bbuk,3bwrnc,TheFreshPrince12,7,Fri Jul 3 08:23:51 2015 UTC,"Jasmine is so clearly using Cristian to snatch up some headlines, I agree with Jack.  Oh, I'm 80% attracted to women but will go with a man when someone special comes along. And that special person who connects with you is Cristian? lol ok. I believe she finds Cristian hot, but I'm skeptical of her motives."

bbuk,3bwrnc,Gladiator995,14,Thu Jul 2 20:16:00 2015 UTC,"Starting to talk down to the other housemates, being up his own arse and thinking he's better than everyone else."

bbuk,3bwrnc,WezVC,17,Thu Jul 2 20:41:28 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad James just blatantly disagreed with her. He completely shut her down.  Seriously, because he's a ""big man"" he should sit there and take her insults but he can't say anything back because she's a woman? She's a fucking disgrace to women by making them look like they can't stand up for themselves.  As everybody in that house loves to say, ""if you can't take it, don't dish it out""."

On the one hand I just want her to fuck off, but on the other hand I loved seeing her face as soon as she realised she was about to get swapped with Marc, and then his shit-eating grin.  I'm glad somebody had a chance to say something positive to Marc, I was worried the upcoming eviction might have got in his head a bit.  But I just don't understand the guest housemates at all. They're saying things like ""just get one of them to do it, tell them to do whatever you want"" which isn't at all how hotels work, and then when Marc asks them to do it they act like he's the one being a dick."

bbuk,3buo8r,Smoking_Fish,4,Fri Jul 3 10:59:59 2015 UTC,"Marc genuinely hasnt been a wanker for a long time, the other housemates are so on his back these days, any time he makes a joke they immediately pounce on him and twist it. When he was arguing with people and deliberately  being a bellend, he'd admit it. Now he's getting annoyed because he genuinely isn't trying to antagonise anyone, but people keep coming in and telling him how horrible he is, because Helen was a whore to Brian. That ashleyne is 100% worse than anything Marc does. As is Danny.. People think he's a genuinely nice guy, go check out his past twitter. He's a right prick."
bbuk,3buo8r,AcePlague,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:40:20 2015 UTC,"He's a wanker. The comment about being educated seals it, the pleasure he takes from trolling  further proof.   He's getting annoyed about being called out on being a wanker and like most bullies can't handle others truths."
bbuk,3buo8r,smashing3000,6,Thu Jul 2 14:44:31 2015 UTC,That comment was following an absolute torrent of abuse from her and was a spur of the moment comment.

bbuk,3bsb2k,TheFreshPrince12,17,Wed Jul 1 19:14:18 2015 UTC,"Love when Trashleyne gets her ass handed to her. Bonus treat that it happened twice in one episode! Chloe is on some other level of stupid, though. I love that Marc doesn't even give her the time of day and she still loses her cool.  ""I have a car and a mortgage!!"" okay...? She is probably the dumbest housemate. You're a commoner, we get it; it's not an excuse to be boring though. I'm just glad Danny wasn't within earshot because you know he'll fight to the death over her honor...  As for Joel, he left a bad taste in my mouth this episode. The way he spoke to Jack was patronizing and rude. I know he just wanted to win the task, but there's no need to talk down to someone. I've noticed a lot that when he talks to people sometimes, he himself uses a condescending, fatherly tone. I have a feeling he thinks he's better than everyone in that house. Fair enough, he probably is the smartest, but there's no need to act like that."
bbuk,3bsb2k,WezVC,6,Thu Jul 2 05:38:57 2015 UTC,"It's funny that Joel was acting as though he was only trying to be in character, is that how he treats hotel staff in real life? There's a difference between playing a character and being a complete dick.  None of the other housemates have ever acted like that during a task when they've had the benefits, they usually just did silly and playful things."
bbuk,3bsb2k,ZombieDonShula,6,Thu Jul 2 11:15:38 2015 UTC,Didn't Sam just ask him how his night was going and he reminded her that she was hotel staff?  I'd love to stay at a hotel where the chef has an interest in my evening.
bbuk,3bsb2k,Smoking_Fish,5,Thu Jul 2 12:15:44 2015 UTC,Agree on the Joel thing.
bbuk,3bsb2k,bellecasey,2,Thu Jul 2 07:42:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points, except I find Joel's ""I am the prime minister of you and you must listen"" routine really cute"
bbuk,3bsb2k,WezVC,13,Thu Jul 2 07:35:02 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how Danny can accuse Marc of going after all the girls when he is on his second at this point.  And both times he's flirted with and pursued the girl until they start to like him back, before instantly regretting his decision and backing off.  EDIT: I don't think I've laughed so much during this series as I did when it cut to Marc, Jack, and Nick all quite clearly staring at Christian through the mirror with bated breath. It was a nice light-hearted moment compared to all the other shit going on."
bbuk,3bsb2k,Smoking_Fish,4,Wed Jul 1 21:30:48 2015 UTC,"Marc at the end..brillaint. He can be brillaint sometimes when he's like that and the normal banter, then he ruins it being a smug know it all prick."
bbuk,3bsb2k,WezVC,5,Wed Jul 1 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean, and that's why I love him. Nobody can deny he is entertaining, he made that whole situation so funny.  It was like some sort of modern Fawlty Towers."
bbuk,3bsb2k,Smoking_Fish,-1,Wed Jul 1 22:03:14 2015 UTC,"He can be, but then he can be a nasty prick. Being honest and yourself doesn't give you an excuse for being a dick. More of that (end of episode) and he'd win easy"
bbuk,3bsb2k,tvwatcherguy,3,Wed Jul 1 22:06:49 2015 UTC,I have to ask you're not mistaking Marc simply defending himself against the nasty crap aisylene was saying to him with him being a dick are ya? He had more than a right to say whatever he wanted to her when she attacked him the way she did first.
bbuk,3bsb2k,Smoking_Fish,2,Wed Jul 1 22:21:00 2015 UTC,"Na he was OK there as she started that. Recently I've found hes just been defending himself. Just because the guy is entertaining, doesn't make him a nice person. He even agrees himself that hes nast"

I like Helen and alot and thought that was funny but then after shes turned into a drunken bully. And honestly Danny shoulda been remove hes squared up 3 times with Marc, without a warning even.

bbuk,3bsb2k,WezVC,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:25:16 2015 UTC,Marc can take it though so when people attack him it doesn't seem as serious.

bbuk,3bsb2k,AcePlague,15,Wed Jul 1 22:09:13 2015 UTC,"Danny acts hard as fuck but he wouldn't square up to Marc in the real world.

He said ""it was a two way street"" but he also said Marc antagonised him, which Marc admitted, in his own words ""yes I have antagonised you"" I think it's unfortunate it comes down to that single argument, that was almost entirely on Helen's shoulders, but he did wind him up the entire week he was there, as deserved or undeserved as that may have been."

bbuk,3bo9k7,WezVC,2,Tue Jun 30 22:10:07 2015 UTC,I really can't imagine Nick would nominate anybody other than Marc and Sam. It's going to be interesting to see who he goes for next week if one of them goes.

bbuk,3bo9k7,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,4,Tue Jun 30 23:45:10 2015 UTC,I think Nick should just leave Harry and let her just be on her own. She gets mad for no reason at him and then she doesn't even tell him what he did. I would have just left her to be mad and not gone back. She seems a bit crazy.
bbuk,3bo9k7,tvwatcherguy,8,Wed Jul 1 12:30:57 2015 UTC,"Iv always been against Harry but the way she's the only one speaking honestly about Marc has given me a lot of respect for her!  People need to realise Brian scaled the wall on his own accord,  based on the horrible crappie HELEN said to him.  Marc disagreed with what she said straight away!    I think the hms think that the public will hate Marc now and are hopping on the anti Marc bandwagon."
bbuk,3bo9k7,WezVC,10,Tue Jun 30 22:02:08 2015 UTC,"It's funny because what Harry is saying about Marc is probably the absolute best thing she's done in terms of looking good in the eyes of the public, and she probably doesn't have a clue."

bbuk,3bo2ai,VitaminDeej,2,Wed Jul 1 09:18:31 2015 UTC,"I think the reason it's a popular drink is that the cola will normally mask the vodka flavour, so you can have quite a few without feeling like you're 'drinking'. Maybe it really is just a UK thing only? IDK"

bbuk,3bjoz9,TheFreshPrince12,13,Mon Jun 29 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"God, I'm so over this house. It's the exact same shit day in and day out. The next two weeks can't go by fast enough. I just want it to be over.   At first, I was mad at the housemates for all nominating Marc and Sam. However, after Nick did his face-to-face nominations he explained why he nominated Marc: ""But what I will say is: remembering, out of all these people, there's not a lot that stands out to me as well.""   Nick's right. Nobody in the house stands out because nobody does anything. They're BORING. There is nothing interesting that goes on. There was a time, long ago, where housemates would make their own fun. To this house, fun is defined as getting drunk and fighting with each other... isn't that sad?  It's not just their fault either. Big Brother himself has gotten very boring as the season progressed. I remember, in past seasons like BB14, Big Brother was very involved with the house. Food comps were interesting, there was a secret task at least once a week, and there were even little reward/punishment tasks that were thrown in to keep the house from stagnating. The beginning of this season was interesting; tasks were imaginative. Production has gotten SO lazy. They're relying on a character-driven series AFTER they pulled some strings that sent the characters they needed for it to work (Sarah, Harriet, Amy/Sally) out the door. They must have blew this season's budget on paying returning houseguests' stipends. Now they only have enough money to buy cheap alcohol to throw at the contestants every night.  Big Brother: Timebomb is an abomination and the biggest flop of a series I've seen so far."
bbuk,3bjoz9,WezVC,2,Tue Jun 30 03:54:32 2015 UTC,"I'm only just watching from the start and the whole time I've been thinking ""Aaron, Kieran, and a few of the others seem really fun, how the fuck did they get evicted before Jade etc."" then I got to the ridiculous nomination twist which essentially made the public have to evict the relatively liked people while the disliked people were made safe for another week."
bbuk,3bjoz9,WezVC,10,Tue Jun 30 10:43:06 2015 UTC,"Jack is a fucking tool. He's acting like Sam betrayed him because he correctly assumes that she nominated him, even though he nominated her as well.   Brave man waiting for the door to absolutely and completely shut before telling her to ""fuck off""."
bbuk,3bjoz9,Crystal-Abyss,6,Tue Jun 30 11:07:20 2015 UTC,"Nick... STICK UP FOR YOURSELF!! STAND YOUR GROUND!!! FUCKING HELL!! Sorry, just had to let that out"
bbuk,3bjoz9,WezVC,6,Mon Jun 29 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"Good luck with that. Even his nominations were basically ""other people think these things about you and it can be perceived badly"".  When Harry is standing up for Marc against Nick you know something is going wrong, although she wasn't exactly in the best mood. And yet, Danny had to get involved again."
bbuk,3bjoz9,bellecasey,4,Mon Jun 29 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"In his defence almost every single person in there throws a huge tantrum and holds a grudge no matter what reason you give for nominating them, and he's the only one in that firing line this week... I'd be jittery about it too"
bbuk,3bjoz9,WezVC,6,Mon Jun 29 23:32:13 2015 UTC,"I understand that it must be difficult and I'm actually only just watching this series from the start, so I can see he's struggled the whole time.  But I just feel like it's exactly the same every single time he nominates somebody, he never gives a valid enough reason in my opinion and instead tries to say things like ""because I don't think anybody else will nominate you"", which you never used to get away with in Big Brother.  But yeah, he was very unlucky to get lumped with the public nominations by pure chance. I can't say how I'd react under it, and one good thing about Nick is that he's a self-confessed ""coward"" so he has no false pretenses and accepts his faults. I definitely don't think his nerves during any public speaking are an act."
bbuk,3bjoz9,Crystal-Abyss,4,Mon Jun 29 23:44:35 2015 UTC,"I'm close to giving up on Nick - I get what it's like, I've been hopelessly infatuated with a girl before, but I still stood up for myself when.... eh, you're right, there's no hope for him"

bbuk,3bjoz9,Jimmymule,16,Tue Jun 30 07:49:35 2015 UTC,It says a lot about people saying Mark intimidated Bryan when the person that hates Mark the most stands up for him. He really is the easy target for face to face cause he will take it the best.

bbuk,3bjoz9,WezVC,3,Mon Jun 29 21:03:24 2015 UTC,Obviously I'm a fan of Marc so my opinion will be different but I think he felt like he had to say something because Nick used an excuse that he has already tried to defend himself about over and over.   This was made very clear when even afterwards Nick couldn't give an example of Marc antagonising Brian other than the water which he admitted to.
bbuk,3bjoz9,WezVC,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:56:22 2015 UTC,I'd say about as often as Danny.

bbuk,3bfinq,chrissiecott,7,Sun Jun 28 21:06:13 2015 UTC,There were actually funny moments this episode rather than just arguing which was refreshing. I heard Joel even speak at one point! Keep it up bb
bbuk,3bfinq,bellecasey,7,Sun Jun 28 22:00:38 2015 UTC,Joel suggesting they could convince Marc and Sam to stay in there for days was the highlight for me :3

I think he did like her when things were normal, but Danny would prefer to take things slow and not get serious inside the house.  And now that its become such a big thing, he's been put off her"
bbuk,3bfinq,ed2rummy,0,Mon Jun 29 03:32:04 2015 UTC,Overbearing too. She also has a constant need for someone to care for her.  It's gold digging behaviour. I really do believe Helen.

bbuk,3be88c,Jotchee,6,Sun Jun 28 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"I think Helen's treatment by Emma was appropriate, considering Helen's behavior. To go easy on her would have been biased, IMO."

If Emma just let her repeat her bullshit again, the interview would have been pointless.  And the booing crowd? Well, Helen seems to love that part. They're just ""playing into her hands"", after all. :P"
bbuk,3be88c,Jotchee,0,Sun Jun 28 17:20:46 2015 UTC,This is helen's persona to be the bitch on the TV. That's how she makes money. I guarantee you she doesn't regret anything she said in that house. She strives on people hating her. I had to watch the interview after seeing this thread. Emma actually went easy on her. So please
bbuk,3be88c,Osinib,12,Sun Jun 28 20:36:09 2015 UTC,I like her and I think she is pretty good and you can't really blame her because Helen is a massive prick and said some really awful things. It's probably hard to keep it unbiased.
bbuk,3be88c,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,4,Sun Jun 28 12:16:39 2015 UTC,Kinda can blame her though if its literally her job to look at the house objectively
bbuk,3be88c,gotbeff,3,Sun Jun 28 14:06:49 2015 UTC,"I think she has to look at housemates objectively if they're in the running to win the show, it doesn't really matter if she was impartial to Helen or not because that wouldn't influence votes. That's how I took it anyway. Also, she's probably met Helen a few times since she won so it might be harder for her to remain impartial because she'll already have some sort of attitudes towards her which have been created away from the house."
bbuk,3be88c,jyunga,9,Mon Jun 29 00:12:20 2015 UTC,You can't really say that. You don't know what her contact states or what production wants from her when it comes to the live shows. They may want her grilling Helen because they think the fans want to see that.
bbuk,3be88c,Jotchee,4,Sun Jun 28 16:21:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's her job, really. She says what production wants her to say. And this show is in no way trying to present an objective view of anything at all. They're telling stories, and this (hopefully final) chapter of Helen's story ended with her getting a bit of comeuppance. Because that's how the show runners wanted it to end."

bbuk,3be88c,CRB94,5,Sun Jun 28 12:09:08 2015 UTC,Yes!  I was thinking the exact same thing.  I was feeling her bias not only on Friday but also last week whenever she was interviewing Jade where I also found her to be a little rude.  Hope she goes back to how she was before.

bbuk,3bcz14,Smoking_Fish,2,Sun Jun 28 09:00:23 2015 UTC,"There's no point in starting this argument because of our flairs, but seriously how can you think Marc started that conflict? He asked Nick if he wanted to win, Nick said ""no"", and Marc playfully said ""don't lie"".  Later on in the conversation Nick even went on to say that he does want to win.  I don't think Danny intended for it to go so far because he did calmly say ""Can I be honest, I think you're being a dick"", but there was no reason for it to start in the first place.  With somebody like Marc if you're going to start a confrontation you better be ready to go the whole way, and you can't let him get to you. Danny is just not good at arguing with people like Marc, because he's not as good at getting his point across."
bbuk,3bcz14,WezVC,4,Sun Jun 28 22:10:52 2015 UTC,"No Marc kept telling Nick what his intentions are. Nick asked what the point of the question was and Marc was acting like a bully. Nick did admit that he would love to win, but that wasn't his only intention of being there like Marc was trying to make out.  Marc is a shit stirrer and is excellent at manipulating even the audience to seeing past his bullshit."
bbuk,3bcz14,your-beast-of-burden,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:41:35 2015 UTC,"Wow that is the worst use of the word bully I have ever seen. Shouldn't they all be able to answer that line of questioning with grace, since it's kind of the point of the show? Marc wasn't being aggressive at all, yet Chloe is immediately defensive and Danny's first contribution to the conversation, yet again, is an attack on Marc."
bbuk,3bcz14,ZombieDonShula,7,Sun Jun 28 16:10:12 2015 UTC,"Marc is a bully, you can't deny that. He intentionally aggravates people's. He intentionally provokes. But because he admits that he does this on purpose he's not a bully?  I don't think his actions should be dismissed because he calls it honesty.   Chloe has admitted it the past that she is a bit of a pussy with Marc and just goes with what he says because she is scared of being on his bad side and scared he will chose her to provoke next. Sooo... Tell me how is that not bullying?  Edit: just because someone isn't being aggressive doesn't mean that they aren't prodding and poking people for a reaction. A bully isn't just someone who's physical. There is mental bullying, which can be just as exhausting. Marc has become less overt with his bullshit, but it still stinks. He plays mind games with the housemates, which can go too far. The housemates shouldn't have to live in fear or constant frustration."
bbuk,3bcz14,your-beast-of-burden,-2,Sun Jun 28 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"Verbalizing why you should win the show is tantamount to, well, winning the show. I'm not speaking about Marc's entire stay in the house, I'm talking about one conversation where Marc asks what the audience asks themselves every week, why should this person win?   In that conversation, we see Marc calmly ask a reasonable question and then poke fun at the answer. His tone is clear in it's playfulness. Please rewatch this scene and judge Marc's tone of voice. This is not a fight, but a conversation to him. It's met with aggression instantaneously, not from the one being asked, but from outside the conversation. In this instance, Danny is in the wrong. He's aggressive in an otherwise calm situation and this is his umpteenth time doing that.   If you think Marc should be shouted at whenever he speaks, questions or otherwise pokes fun at the housemates because of his past behavior, I can understand that but I disagree."
bbuk,3bcz14,ZombieDonShula,3,Sun Jun 28 16:34:52 2015 UTC,"In that situation it wasn't even time for Marc to talk. The task was for Nikki to address the weakest link and give advice. And it gave time for that person to respond. Sam had a nice moment and Nikki was respectful of what she said. Marc then had to stand up and make the whole thing about himself as per usual.   Danny was right, it wasn't for Marc to speak. And to be honest it feels like it's going to be the second year in a row of a vile personality winning. Sad, but we can agree to disagree."
bbuk,3bcz14,your-beast-of-burden,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:32:54 2015 UTC,"I think it would be easier to understand everyone who lives in the house's feelings towards Marc if we were in the house. Because of his past behavior, even when he asks innocent questions, because he often tried to rile people up verbally in the past, other housemates are going to overreact to anything he says."

bbuk,3bb7oo,bellecasey,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:35:30 2015 UTC,I agree slightly however this years new batch of housemates have absolutely delivered and excelled in comparison with their last year counterparts.    Harry and Bianca are pretty similar however I remember Bianca being more sexual and wanting to have sex with Winston whereas with Harry she is much more candid with Nick even though she is always topless.   Yeah Pav may have had a good VT but who doesn't.  He was invisible last year and still don't understand how he made it to the final.  No further likenesses to Marc from that.    Zoe and Sam are alike too however Zoe was much more of a wannabe attention seeker whereas Sam is more of a sheep but I get your point!
bbuk,3bamvx,DotDotDot16,10,Sat Jun 27 11:11:01 2015 UTC,"I have, I can only comment on how it was like 7 years ago though.   So you queue up for ages and then when you get near the front of the queues, you re put into groups of 10-12, they then ask you to do some silly excercises to see if you're entertaining, like spell a word with your bodies and such. You also have to do mock nominations where the person who gets nominated most gets kicked out of the audition process If you're deemed entertaining enough, you get a hand stamp and sent over to the next stage.   The next bit is to fill out a massive document of questions about yourself. Essentially giving them tons of information about you and how your mind works. You hand this in and then wait a bit while a member of the production team read over your stuff. Then you get to wait a bit more to enter the diary rooms. Which is just a couple of curtains and a camera while you talk to an actual big brother voice. This is a very short time like 2 minutes where they ask why you should be a housemate.  They then decide if they want to see more of you and call you back that day or the following day for a longer diary room session.  You then have to wait weeks to find out if they want to see more of you. If they do, they then call you down to london for similar stuff, where they have you in groups with other auditionees, where you debate against stuff like prison quality, plastic surgery and such. I then had a longer 10 minute diary room thing where they just asked about me and then I was told I wasn't through to the next stage."

bbuk,3bamvx,RideOrDieRemember,6,Sun Jun 28 12:30:53 2015 UTC,"Yes and not only did I make it to the final stages (which sounds cool until I guesstimate that might be 1000 people) but the guy along side me - an obnoxious little dick - he made it into the house. I say this seriously - I couldn't have been more excited about it than if it was myself. It really felt like 'One of US' got in. 'My guy' was in there representing. I lived vicariously through him because it was in fact our initial feud is what caught their attention to him. In a real way I was part of him getting in and to his credit that annoying little fucker sent me a great sincere email just before his social media was blacked out. Good kid.  Anyways, my only tip on process .. actually I dont want people to know this but..  in fact they aren't so interested in how you do in the stupid group activity tasks. these are those corporate team-building stupid things like catch people falling backwards or improv-for-amateurs sketches etc.   Not so much those but its the two show people outside where everyone has smoke breaks (they may not even appear to be BB people) who bullshlt or just observe smoke-break people. Its what they see people doing BETWEEN the test exercises. or BEFORE AND AFTER the camera tests. I'm also 99% certain there was constantly planned mind-games. Like for example telling people to be at a certain room at 1pm but its a mix-up and then everyone is told to wait downstairs for 2 hours. That was done on purpose to see how everyone reacted. Some were dullards when they thought it was NOT part of the audition process. Others were just full of shlt-disturbing, gossiping non-stop while waiting, others genuinely having rage-attacks at the late fuckn' mixup! <--- THAT was the test. THAT was the REAL selection process right there! NOT the ball-tossing lifeskills group session thing itself.   In the end I received a beautiful 'rejection letter' (seriously it was a lovely personalized email I wish I'd printed).  Oh - yes I 'made it' onto the show in a different way. I've made it onto BBUK and BBUSA several times and could not be anymore satisfied."

bbuk,3b8g76,DontCallMeSurely-,3,Fri Jun 26 20:31:24 2015 UTC,"also, the cameras have a full view of the toilet? obviously they would never show any such footage, but the thought of producers being able to see would stress me out!   They show Lesley ""doing her business"" in BB6 (because she carries on a conversation with Craig and Vanetha in the process!).    Emma repeatedly walking in on Victor on the loo in BB5 was one of the reasons they hated each other so much."
bbuk,3b8g76,Omio,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:39:13 2015 UTC,"wow i never knew that. confirmed, i can never be a housemate lol"
bbuk,3b8g76,bellecasey,3,Sat Jun 27 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"SO stressful. I'm not sure why but that's totally the BB deal breaker for me, I couldn't cope with it. And the ones who go on to be famous, don't they live in fear of some jerk ex-employee releasing some of that old footage? Shudder haha"

bbuk,3b8b8w,bellecasey,3,Fri Jun 26 20:50:10 2015 UTC,"His exit was great quality, I'm happy for him going out proud"
bbuk,3b8b8w,WezVC,11,Sat Jun 27 15:14:54 2015 UTC,"It's a bit frightening how much enjoyment I'm taking in watching Jack absolutely shit his pants waiting for the result.  EDIT: Oh great he's still in. Gotta hand it to Simon for going out cock swinging, but please stop saying ""showbiz"".  EDIT2: Something tells me Emma might like Nikki a bit more than Helen... the presenter is usually way less obvious/more impartial than this."
bbuk,3b8b8w,scratchmellotron,10,Fri Jun 26 20:36:22 2015 UTC,Emma has never been that great at being impartial. She struggled to hide her disdain when Helen won last year.
bbuk,3b8b8w,WezVC,3,Fri Jun 26 23:28:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see that more clearly now. She barely let Helen speak and kept talking over her defending Nikki, then let Nikki say whatever she wanted and kept telling her how much ""we"" love her."
bbuk,3b8b8w,fefe2000,3,Sat Jun 27 00:23:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed and agreed.  I love Emma and find her to be the best host of all the BB series I've ever watched (UK, US, CA and AU), however, it would have been great to see her being a bit more impartial regarding Helen vs. Nikki.  Both of these time warp HMs were uniquely flawed and entertaining.  It was as if Nikki could have done no wrong.  Puh-leeeese."
bbuk,3b8b8w,bellecasey,7,Sun Jun 28 09:18:08 2015 UTC,"Emma started grinning when the crowd started the ""get Helen out"" chant, it bummed me out a bit. One thing I usually adore about her is she manages to find empathy for even the biggest jerk of a housemate. And she admitted on BOTS later that she was biased and grilling Helen based on her own disapproval (proudly, to cheers from the crowd, uch), which kinda makes it worse because it shows it was premeditated and she doesn't regret it. I feel really let down and disappointed, not because I like Helen, just because I really expected more of Emma"
bbuk,3b8b8w,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,7,Sat Jun 27 07:51:05 2015 UTC,I think she likes Nikki more because Helen is a massive cunt.

bbuk,3b8b8w,TrillTurtle,5,Sat Jun 27 02:05:39 2015 UTC,"She'll leave in a few days. It's kinda infuriating how we can't just have the original HM's in the house on their own without sending ""legends"" in. I know they're in to spice things up but I got so tired of Helen fighting with Brian and Nikki for 2 weeks.   It's like they can't trust the HM's to bring enough entertainment, that they have to let more guests stay in the house this Sunday for the next week after Aisleyne leaves."
bbuk,3b8b8w,bellecasey,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:58:57 2015 UTC,"The only way I can justify what they've been doing is the ratings must have SUCKED royally, enough to make them panic about losing sponsors and ad revenue in future. It's a shame, I wasn't a big fan of this series before all this either, but it didn't seem like a crisis situation"
bbuk,3b8b8w,lukaeber,2,Sat Jun 27 07:47:43 2015 UTC,"I think this has been planned all along ... hence the ""timebomb"" theme.  The ratings have apparently gone up though."
bbuk,3b8b8w,bellecasey,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:21:09 2015 UTC,"They definitely planned doing something like this, but not on this scale. They dragged out the Legends visit by a week, and now they've added Aisleyne and planned even more... If this was all planned, I don't even know why they bothered with the rest of the cast at all"
bbuk,3b8b8w,Jotchee,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:25:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. Replacing four originals was in the plan from the start, which means that convincing us they were boring was just a sales technique to make the replacements seem better than they really are.  If people like Marc and Helen were actually better housemates, then BB would have cast people like that and had them in the house from the start. They also wouldn't need to protect them from the game they're supposed to be playing, if they were good players."
bbuk,3b8b8w,bellecasey,2,Sat Jun 27 17:20:05 2015 UTC,I see absolutely no point in leaving her in there now. It's been a bit of a waste already imo
bbuk,3b8b8w,TheFreshPrince12,2,Sat Jun 27 07:45:13 2015 UTC,"It is so annoying to watch Simon and Jack interact. They're so passive aggressive and rude to each other. It's like a competition to see who can be the most condescending. Meanwhile, they keep saying ""I think we're getting on better."" Just stop, you're not; you know you hate each other and it's better if you just don't speak."
bbuk,3b8b8w,mixdkinkster83,3,Sat Jun 27 03:19:55 2015 UTC,Any guesses who the Hotel guests will be next week? Didnt want to make a new thread for spoilers...but I think Michelle Visage may pop up...
bbuk,3b8b8w,bellecasey,3,Sat Jun 27 14:58:34 2015 UTC,"I wish I cared more... I usually would, but I'm just exhausted with the Legends already"
bbuk,3b8b8w,lukaeber,3,Sat Jun 27 15:18:16 2015 UTC,I was surprised that Simon got evicted over Harry and Jack.  Seems that BBUK voters like to hold grudges ... Simon has not been that bad since the first week he came back.
bbuk,3b8b8w,Jotchee,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:18:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's because he talked himself up as entertaining and then very, very wasn't. Harry and Jack don't pretend to be anything they aren't. So maybe some voters still appreciate authenticity.  Simon was pointless, aside from the drama of his hypocrisy when targeting Eileen."
bbuk,3b8b8w,AcePlague,7,Sat Jun 27 17:28:08 2015 UTC,"Why anybody is voting to evict Simon over the boring trio of Christian, jack or Danny is absolutely beyond me."
bbuk,3b8b8w,Beevo,12,Fri Jun 26 21:53:07 2015 UTC,"An old man with the emotional makeup of a 12 year old girl isn't endearing. He cries at anything, he bitches about having to do basic housework, and he doesn't really 'fit in' well with the other house guests.   He wouldn't have been my vote, I wanted Joel out, but I understand 100% why Simon was booted."
bbuk,3b8b8w,scratchmellotron,4,Sat Jun 27 04:17:10 2015 UTC,Lack of a personality isn't enough to make people vote unfortunately. Vote-to-evict is a terrible system.
bbuk,3b8b8w,ConnDeReplay,5,Fri Jun 26 23:12:15 2015 UTC,"Cristian and Danny have jumped considerably for me. Those two and Chloe are my top 3 at this point.   I think Danny has had enough with a lot of the shit going on in that house. Ever since the pizza boxes he's been dropping truthbombs left and right, and he's really the only person who has sincerely owned Helen (haven't seen tonight yet so maybe Aisleyne does at some point, one can hope!).   I loved Cristian's random subplots of everyone treating him like a child/getting mad at him for being greedy (he's a growing boy!!!!!) but once he got nominated he just became unhinged (in a good way!). I'm totally down with the people driven paranoid by the house (Shout out to Lea Walker) and Cristian walking around antagonizing everyone and reminding them to ""remember who their REAL friends were >:("" really spoke to me. Being eye candy doesn't hurt either.  Chloe for me reminds me of Rachel Rice, a sweet, genuine person who gets a lot of shit for no reason. I really like her every time she's on and I hope she goes far.  Jack can fuck off though lol. I've been over him since Launch night and he needs to leave ASAP."
bbuk,3b8b8w,AcePlague,2,Sat Jun 27 01:31:10 2015 UTC,"Ill give you dany then haha but Christian can bugger off. He's boring, he had no personality and suddenly he's just an argumentative tool!"
bbuk,3b8b8w,JonathanSloanAUS,4,Sat Jun 27 10:42:47 2015 UTC,"I found this very accurate. As good as drama is, sometimes it's nice to just watch people who are genuinely decent guys"
bbuk,3b8b8w,mixdkinkster83,2,Sat Jun 27 01:43:12 2015 UTC,"Because he kept saying he would bring some entertainment into the house and he fell flat. Plus the whole ""young house"" thing pissed me off, he nominated the other person that was around his age. And than sort of complained about it being a ""young house."".. WTF..."

bbuk,3b8b8w,mavmlvc,2,Fri Jun 26 21:57:26 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I'll be in the minority, but I really enjoyed Helen this season. Yes,  she stirred things up, but I never saw anything truly offensive in her behavior.  She was cast as the villian and played it perfectly.  When she was on the screen I'd be rivoted.  I had never seen Nikki or Brian when they were in the house originally (and would probably like them more if I had), but they both seemed pretty useless and only there for attention.  Nikki's constant mugging and pulling faces cannot be genuine! She's like a cartoon character!! Brian could've easily walked out the front door, but had to make a scene and climb a wall (and I agree with Helen, he's creepy.)  Attention seeking behavior at it's worst."
bbuk,3b8b8w,henry82,4,Mon Jun 29 12:55:17 2015 UTC,"Did anyone notice when Helen was evicted, she stood up, walked away from the couch and began the hugs? That way it wasnt awkward for those who don't care for her.   She may appear as a bitch, but i think theres more going on up there than people think"
bbuk,3b8b8w,bellecasey,2,Sat Jun 27 02:06:00 2015 UTC,"She's a walking contradiction, that girl"
bbuk,3b8b8w,Jotchee,0,Sat Jun 27 07:41:02 2015 UTC,"She's still awful, even if she's trying to pretend she isn't 5% of the time. The more that's going on up there is that she's manipulative. It's not that she's actually lovely. LOL"
bbuk,3b8b8w,sewlazy,3,Sat Jun 27 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether I like Helen or not, I think during her exit interview, Emma Willis was pretty biased in the way she was asking her questions. As the host, she should have stayed objective instead of talking over her and putting her own opinions in the leading questions."
bbuk,3b8b8w,WezVC,10,Sat Jun 27 09:20:40 2015 UTC,Emma: What do you think of Nikki?  Helen: I don't like Nikki because she's a drama que-  Emma: YEAH BUT HOLD ON THAT'S JUST HOW NIKKI IS.  And the contrast.  Emma: What do you think about Helen?  Nikki: I don't like Helen because she's poison and intimidating and satan.  Emma: We love you Nikki.  It was clear just from the greeting hugs who she liked more.
bbuk,3b8b8w,bellecasey,4,Sat Jun 27 10:56:31 2015 UTC,"It was actually gross. She outright told Helen her personal opinion was wrong several times. Even the biggest assholes she has interviewed she usually gives them the basic respect of impartially moving on without agreeing or disagreeing, instead of tearing them down further in front of an already booing and heckling crowd. I'm so disappointed."
bbuk,3b8b8w,Jotchee,-1,Sat Jun 27 15:24:25 2015 UTC,"She outright told Helen her personal opinion was wrong several times.   This is a good thing. People like Helen shouldn't be allowed to get away with spewing bullshit as ""just my honest opinion"" without being challenged. Fuck Helen's opinions, she has no respect for anyone else's."
bbuk,3b8b8w,your-beast-of-burden,0,Sat Jun 27 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you! There is honesty and then there is Helen. Yes, Helen's feelings might have been hurt because Brian called her a bully, but she goes for low blows to try to destroy people.   Honest is, ""I disagree with your opinion because I believe..."" Helen is, ""You're a fucking moron, no one would care if you lived or died. Fuck off and shut up.""  Like that's vile, and if someone thinks that's an okay way to live then they might need to reevaluate their own lives."
bbuk,3b8b8w,lukaeber,4,Sat Jun 27 19:38:23 2015 UTC,Her job isn't to be neutral ... her job is to get ratings.  She is merely reflecting the opinions of most people in the audience.
bbuk,3b8b8w,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,0,Sat Jun 27 16:25:26 2015 UTC,I agree that she should act the same towards both of them but it must be pretty hard when you are talking to Helen who has said some awful things not to be a bit biased.
bbuk,3b8b8w,bellecasey,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:52:10 2015 UTC,"That's her job, though. Her one job. I usually love her, but she let everyone and herself down tonight.

This seemed like a somewhat nasty thing to say to get people wound up I feel. Right then I thought Simon was going to be evicted as it was just before lines close and re-opened again to evict either Jack or Simon. I saw that as a turning point, as I thought Jack was going to be evicted by a slight margin."
bbuk,3b8b8w,Bartowskiii,-2,Sat Jun 27 00:58:16 2015 UTC,Why is Sam so hated? I adore her
bbuk,3b8b8w,your-beast-of-burden,13,Fri Jun 26 20:42:13 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it's because she doesn't seem genuine. I think Sam would be more liked if she put the same effort into getting to know people as she does trying to make them like her.   She's kinda a fence sitter but in the sense that she hops the fence when convenient and her convictions come from who she is talking to at the moment.   I may be completely off base, but that's how I feel watching her."
bbuk,3b8b8w,WezVC,5,Fri Jun 26 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"Along with this just watch her interactions with anybody, she's constantly trying to stay in their good books and always jumps straight into damage control whenever she isn't."
bbuk,3b8b8w,the_cucumber,2,Fri Jun 26 20:52:39 2015 UTC,Is that really problem though? Some people really just don't care enough about an issue to make it into a confrontation when someone else disagrees.  I already dislike sam due to her relationship with Marc but I don't think fence sitting and insta damage control is a bad thing.
bbuk,3b8b8w,WezVC,3,Sat Jun 27 09:01:24 2015 UTC,"I personally think it's a bad thing because it looks like she's playing a really, really bad game.  Why don't you like her because of Marc?"
bbuk,3b8b8w,the_cucumber,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:37:40 2015 UTC,"It's women like her who let men like Marc think it's okay to treat all women like crap, and be rewarded for it, because ""it's just banter."" No. No one should ever speak to someone that way, especially in public.   I also feel very negatively towards her over the top bubbly enthusiasm for everything. I like how she stays positive in conflicts but she takes it a bit far."
bbuk,3b8b8w,your-beast-of-burden,2,Sat Jun 27 20:15:46 2015 UTC,"The only reason I think it's a problem is because it feels like we've never gotten to know Sam. I think she overly worried about what people think and tries to conform to the opinions of those around her.   I totally understand avoiding confrontation. But again, my opinion is that Sam is focusing too hard on trying to get people to like her. It doesn't really feel like she's able to form genuine bonds because she just says what she thinks people want to hear.  That can make for very shallow connections and distrust towards her among the other housemates."
bbuk,3b8b8w,bellecasey,5,Sat Jun 27 12:35:46 2015 UTC,"On top of being a bit of a turncloak at any opportunity, she's just so so so cringe. I physically wince at some of the cliche platitude bullshit that comes out of her mouth, and her terrible dad jokes that fall to total silence. I wouldn't say I HATE her, but I would like to see her go haha"
bbuk,3b8b8w,Louniness,3,Sat Jun 27 07:43:58 2015 UTC,"Its probably because she was Marc's ""friend"" but when he went in the bunkhouse she slagged him off + she's quite boring and doesnt add much to the house"
bbuk,3b8b8w,fefe2000,3,Fri Jun 26 20:43:56 2015 UTC,Glad you like Sam.  Someone should!  I find her to be super needy of others' approval and lacking character.  Very superficial.
bbuk,3b8b8w,Kigurumix,0,Fri Jun 26 21:17:00 2015 UTC,"My dislike for Sam is because she never owns up to some things she says or does, it's always no I didn't from her if she is confronted."

Now that he is jumping ship, it's obvious that even the most reasonable person in the house has had enough of her crap. That's got to feel destabilising. She said herself, she thought she had things under control but the narrative is slipping from her hands and she is becoming the villain in a way she can't even run from. She either has to apologise or just stay in that role, and she's not one for apologising is she. The tables have turned on her."

bbuk,3b3eeu,ellelelle,11,Fri Jun 26 09:26:26 2015 UTC,Marc's whole demeanour has changed. He has become so conciliatory. I think Nikki was right. He has realised that when Helen goes he will be alienated. He is trying to reinvent himself.
bbuk,3b3eeu,WezVC,3,Thu Jun 25 21:56:07 2015 UTC,"Personally I just think he's trying to prove that he's not up her arse. He's still winding people up, he's just doing it on his own."
bbuk,3b3eeu,ellelelle,4,Thu Jun 25 22:02:55 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen him winding anyone up in this episode. He seems Mr. Personable tonight, even sweet talking Aisleyne. I'm not finished the episode yet though.. about 15 min left."
bbuk,3b3eeu,ellelelle,11,Thu Jun 25 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"Of all people, Helen thinks she is entitled to describe another person as a ""professional slag"". I can't get over her self loathing. If she judges her own actions half as much as she judges other people, she must find it very hard to live with herself."
bbuk,3b3eeu,ellelelle,9,Thu Jun 25 21:48:38 2015 UTC,Helen the slut shamer. The actual irony.
bbuk,3b3eeu,deathbelle,3,Thu Jun 25 21:51:14 2015 UTC,I think it's projection and I don't take delight in it. Attack being one of the best forms of defence and all that. edit - a word
bbuk,3b3eeu,ed2rummy,2,Fri Jun 26 01:28:05 2015 UTC,"Oh and that unclassified remark. Helen instantly says ""oh that is the banter we are having here""."
bbuk,3b3eeu,JonathanSloanAUS,5,Fri Jun 26 00:40:56 2015 UTC,"I will be saying ""oh shut up you fucking wench"" for a very long time"
bbuk,3b3eeu,Lockowandt,10,Fri Jun 26 00:11:34 2015 UTC,Helen was so irritating. She started both arguments with Nikki and then proclaimed that Nikki was playing into her hands like she's some sort of manipulative mastermind. She also seems to think everyone likes her but obviously Marc is the only person who does but everyone else is too frightened to say anything a part from the legends.
bbuk,3b3eeu,ellelelle,7,Thu Jun 25 22:03:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think most people might see some good in her, but no one is ever going to condone the way she baited, provoked and then attacked Brian. She has left herself open to two defamation of character cases in her short time in the house. No one is there for that. They have to look after themselves. Sorry Helen, but no one is going to publically be on your side with that. Not even Marc."
bbuk,3b3eeu,ZombieDonShula,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:33:06 2015 UTC,"How can anyone think Helen started both arguments with Nikki? I am the biggest Nikki Graham fan but she literally inserted herself into Helen's conversation that had nothing to do with her, actively looking for a fight. When Helen questioned her on it, Nikki said that she feels emboldened and supported enough to fight now.  I love any narrative where Nikki is the hero but I don't want to twist the show to do it and Nikki did suddenly become the aggressor once Ais walked in."
bbuk,3b3eeu,Lockowandt,3,Fri Jun 26 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"Really? If you really were a fan of Nikki you would have seen that Helen was playing up the entire situation on both occasions and then retracted. First purposely talking shit about Aisleyne knowing Nikki was in the room and then proclaiming the house would be better if 'someone', meaning Nikki, wasn't in it. I'm sorry but if she is so real and always speaks her mind then she should expect people disagreeing with her. She's also delusional to think the whole house liked her before Aisleyne walked in which was obviously not true."
bbuk,3b3eeu,TheFreshPrince12,9,Fri Jun 26 21:34:07 2015 UTC,"Why does Marc breathe exclusively through his mouth? He's always standing there, in his underwear, with his mouth slightly agape revealing the top half of his bleached-beyond-belief teeth. He is a neanderthal."

This shit isn't exciting anymore, it just seems like Ultimate BB with interactions between the past HMs. The new cast is just sitting in the background. What a joke. And now Aislyene is a permanent HM.   Damn, Im really hoping BBUS doesn't go downhill either or that will be 0-3 for BB series this year."
bbuk,3b3eeu,ellelelle,4,Fri Jun 26 03:18:14 2015 UTC,How do you mean Aisleyne is permanent D: I just want all these legends out now. Even the Hills had a better script.

bbuk,3b3eeu,WezVC,2,Thu Jun 25 22:55:58 2015 UTC,It's like an episode of Jackass when they just dress super extravagantly for even the slightest theme.
bbuk,3b3eeu,Louniness,6,Thu Jun 25 23:36:39 2015 UTC,"As it stands:    Nikki needs to stop proclaiming shes a legend because it makes her look self-opsessed.    -Helen is a BB legend not matter how much other housemates may want to dumb it down.   -I actually admire Helen for wanting to fight her own battles and not want to play the victim card.  -I think Marc hit the nail on the head that Danny only wants to join in because he believes Nikki's the hero and Helens hated.   -I feel Dannys being fake by trying to act the house counselor who is on a plinth and is so ""wise"". He even admitted a while back he needs to start playing the game.   -It was cringey when Nikki and Aisleyne started hugging when they heard Helen shouting outside the diary room. Theyre putting on the act that they're the good ones too much.   I think thats all, had to get it off my chest."
bbuk,3b3eeu,fefe2000,4,Thu Jun 25 21:03:54 2015 UTC,Completely agree about the hugs in the DR.
bbuk,3b3eeu,WezVC,4,Fri Jun 26 07:14:38 2015 UTC,"Nikki is an absolute drama queen and is quite frankly embarrassing to watch at this point, she's playing up her persona so much and it's just making her so unlikable to me.  The thing about Helen is you could actually see how much she regretted losing herself like that, and it seems to me that where other housemates try to exaggerate and play it up she tries to keep  calm and controlled. She knows exactly what she's doing and, like you, I admire her for it."

BB edited this fight to make Nikki seem insane and full of herself. If you watch the extended fight on the website, Helen is clearly antagonizing."

bbuk,3b3eeu,TheDmac,0,Fri Jun 26 03:08:55 2015 UTC,How the hell is Nikki so popular with the public? Jesus Christ she drives me fucking nuts. I hated Helen last year but this year I am on her and Marc's side more than anyone elses
bbuk,3b3eeu,fefe2000,-1,Fri Jun 26 12:01:45 2015 UTC,"Sigh. I find it disturbing to see how many BBUK fans carry such outright hatred for Helen.  I enjoy watching her play this game.  I liked it tonight when she agreed with Nikki and said, ""I'm vile.""  She fully owns who she is and how she comes across.  Sometimes she even outwardly regrets her outbursts.  NONE -- NOT ONE of the other housemates this season truly understands their own character or sees their own flaws as Helen does her own."
bbuk,3b3eeu,scratchmellotron,6,Fri Jun 26 06:14:11 2015 UTC,I do like her (as a housemate) but I wouldn't judge someone for hating her. Owning or being aware of her negative qualities doesn't redeem them.  A lot of people simply can't find a character enjoyable if they aren't likeable.
bbuk,3b3eeu,Jotchee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:19:39 2015 UTC,"It's about how severely unlikable she is. That's why she's poison to the show.  Personally, I can enjoy someone who is unlikable as long as they don't bring the tone of the entire show into the gutter. I don't find Brian very likable, but he's not so repulsive that I fast-forward past him like I do with Helen. There's also the matter of intention, and Helen is an example of someone who aims for negativity. She revels in it.  And I totally agree, admitting you're vile doesn't make it okay. It actually makes someone more unlikable, because they realize how they act and refuse to make any effort to improve. If everyone was anti-social like that, society would collapse."
bbuk,3b3eeu,WezVC,-5,Sat Jun 27 17:03:10 2015 UTC,"Both Brian and Nikki are far from ""legends"" after this series for me."

bbuk,3b3hqe,ellelelle,4,Fri Jun 26 00:27:11 2015 UTC,I think Simon or Harry. I hope it is Harry for her own sake.
bbuk,3b3hqe,Smoking_Fish,3,Thu Jun 25 20:23:29 2015 UTC,I think jack or harry. Hopefully harry. Don't dislike her but jack brings more i think.

bbuk,3b3hqe,ellelelle,2,Thu Jun 25 22:16:44 2015 UTC,"I fully agree, the whole episode tonight was about the time warp housemates. I don't really care for it, and I think it's actually making Nicki look bad."
bbuk,3b3hqe,the_cucumber,2,Thu Jun 25 22:40:21 2015 UTC,If Aisleyne thinks she is staying for longer than the next couple of days then I'm guessing the time warpers will be kept around too. The actual contestants are just extras at this stage.

bbuk,3b3hqe,pfliegerz,2,Thu Jun 25 18:42:25 2015 UTC,I really feel like Jade only caused her eviction in the last couple of days leading up to it.  If she hadn't tried the whole fake romance with Brian she might have stayed in.
bbuk,3b3hqe,ChasingTheGhost,2,Thu Jun 25 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"Vote to evict Sam. She is a complete shell of a personality and her opinions area never of her own.

She's quite a sad person really, despite all the outward positivity."

bbuk,3b3hqe,charlottenberg,3,Fri Jun 26 04:12:28 2015 UTC,"Very possible. At the same time he hasn't done much recently while hiding behind Marc and Helen, I wonder if the public are bothered getting rid of him!   This is the first time Jack is exposed to getting evicted, and I can see a large amount of the voting public dying to vote for him. I can't imagine how he will react if he comes out to a lot of boos and abuse! If I was from the UK and could vote I'd probably go for Jack, although I've wanted Harry to go for quite some time. Her relationship with Nick is getting very weird and she's acting very strange. She hasn't caused much of a stir though the past week, and reckon she'll be safe unless it's a double eviction."

As much as I'm not a fan of the Harry/Nick antics when she takes a background role and makes silly comments every once in a while I enjoy her. I'd like to see the clique get split up this week so I'm hoping for a Cristian/Jack eviction but it doesn't seem likely.

bbuk,3azvqf,JonathanSloanAUS,8,Thu Jun 25 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"When Helen tried her ""honesty"" bullshit, Danny asked her if calling Brian a murderer/rapist was honesty. She was stumped, but STILL WENT BACK TO THE ""HONESTY"" EXCUSE ANYWAY, almost immediately.  Helen then admitted in that conversation that she does things to wind people up and provoke reactions like Brian's. So is it ""honesty"" or baiting? And why does she get to bait someone into reacting and then tar him as having ""overreacted""?  And Danny asked, if she honestly felt Brian looked dangerous like that, why would she wind him up? Stumped again!  When Helen brought up how it would cross the line for her if someone spoke negatively of her kid, Danny simply stated that Brian would not sink that low. But who would stoop that low? Helen would. Which makes her a massive hypocrite.  It would have been perfect if Danny had jokingly said something like, ""Well, you look like you probably beat and molest your kid."" He could have smirked and said he's just being ""honest"".  It was a great conversation, that indeed exposed her dishonesty and viciousness, but I think it was too subtle for most viewers. Helen knows about buzz words and false narratives, truth be damned, and she'll still have people parroting nonsense about her ""honesty"" after this."
bbuk,3azvqf,Jotchee,5,Thu Jun 25 13:25:04 2015 UTC,Im surprised no one goes at Helen for being a prostitute or having part of her face done but i guess no one wants to go down to her level.
bbuk,3azvqf,big_phat_gator,3,Thu Jun 25 14:06:25 2015 UTC,Brian had been holding back. Nikki knows. Aisleyne knows so who knows what is going to happen.
bbuk,3azvqf,ed2rummy,2,Thu Jun 25 17:00:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah Brian knew but didnt tell, i think that showed some class. Or maybe he did tell but they just didnt show it in the episode."
bbuk,3azvqf,big_phat_gator,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:03:33 2015 UTC,Those aren't reasons to attack a person. Although the way Helen treated Harry she was asking for the prostitute thing to be brought up.
bbuk,3azvqf,ellelelle,7,Thu Jun 25 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"I love Danny.  He's a good man.  Boring at times, but I would love to have him as a friend."
bbuk,3azvqf,lukaeber,2,Thu Jun 25 04:00:31 2015 UTC,"To me it seemed like he was trying to talk her into a corner about double standards, but she was too clever for it."
bbuk,3azvqf,scratchmellotron,9,Thu Jun 25 00:33:18 2015 UTC,"So glad to see that Helen got a formal warning for her comments to Brian, but it isn't enough.  Marc also gets a warning.  Shouldn't he be kicked out for this since has been warned about his unacceptable behavior before???"
bbuk,3azvqf,Kigurumix,9,Wed Jun 24 21:55:58 2015 UTC,"You get two warnings, I believe. Helen received two formal warnings in her season for being a bully.  Anyone remember last year when Helen and Co. decided to gang up on Jale and refer to her as ""slug""? That was the worst bullying I had seen on BBUK ever. I don't know how anyone can be a Helen fan. She is a nasty, nasty person."
bbuk,3azvqf,TheFreshPrince12,4,Thu Jun 25 01:36:19 2015 UTC,Brian climbs over the wall!
bbuk,3azvqf,Kigurumix,-3,Wed Jun 24 21:39:17 2015 UTC,As far as I'm concerned if you really didn't care about the money or the publicity you would leave through the diary room like a normal person.
bbuk,3azvqf,WezVC,11,Wed Jun 24 21:45:26 2015 UTC,"This season BB has done everything in their power to prevent any housemate that has wanted to leave from actually leaving.  They keep them in the Diary room until they can calm them down, make them wait till morning to decide, let them sleep in a different room until they have calmed down, they are prisoners this year until BB wants them gone."
bbuk,3azvqf,Kigurumix,4,Wed Jun 24 21:50:13 2015 UTC,"No chance, if somebody wants to go they can go.  The reason BB has managed to keep them is because none of them wanted to actually go, so they agreed to be ""persuaded"".  If somebody legitimately wanted to leave BB could not, and would not, stop them."
bbuk,3azvqf,WezVC,2,Wed Jun 24 21:54:34 2015 UTC,"There could be something in their contract allowing for exits at Big Brothers discretion - so if someone seemed too upset, Big Brother might want to keep them under observation to make sure they were ok. If they didn't seem too upset, Big Brother might be able to insist they wait to calm down - there could be an enforced cooling off period. Maybe Brian didn't want a night in the ""spare bedroom"". Seemed like he just wanted out."
bbuk,3azvqf,ellelelle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:23:14 2015 UTC,"I would think they would but after watching the past seasons and people wanting to leave and some of the things producers will do to get housemates to stay. It's not as easy to leave as I thought it was especially after I talked to my sister (she ""produces' some shows)."
bbuk,3azvqf,mixdkinkster83,0,Thu Jun 25 06:20:07 2015 UTC,"Not true.   Case in point Nikki in yesterdays show, she goes for the door, insists she wants to leave and they refuse.  They make her sit in the diary room and have Brian there to calm her down and give her a private room to sleep in until she agrees to back in the house."
bbuk,3azvqf,Kigurumix,3,Wed Jun 24 21:59:32 2015 UTC,"And you didn't see the rest of the conversation.  You really think Nikki said ""I want to go home right now"" and BB just said ""No you have to sleep in this room until you agree to go back in the house""  There's a reason we only see certain parts of the exchange. Anybody with half a brain could see Nikki was just being Nikki."
bbuk,3azvqf,WezVC,3,Wed Jun 24 22:02:15 2015 UTC,And howany times did Nikki claim to want to leave in her season? Pretty much in every DR session.
bbuk,3azvqf,originalnutta,-1,Thu Jun 25 01:40:05 2015 UTC,"And you didn't see the rest of the conversation.   for that matter, neither did you."
bbuk,3azvqf,Kigurumix,2,Wed Jun 24 22:04:57 2015 UTC,"True, but be honest and consider which is a more likely scenario.  That they didn't actually want to leave and just needed a ""time out"", or that BB is forcing them to stay in the house."
bbuk,3azvqf,WezVC,2,Wed Jun 24 22:06:35 2015 UTC,I will believe that some just need a cool down but watching Brian make the choice to climb the wall to the roof to escape tells me that he knew that BB would not let him leave via the diary room by his choice.
bbuk,3azvqf,Kigurumix,3,Wed Jun 24 22:09:40 2015 UTC,Did Harry leave early or something?  Was she in this episode at all?
bbuk,3azvqf,lukaeber,2,Thu Jun 25 04:03:23 2015 UTC,Literally didn't see her face once. Not complaining
bbuk,3azvqf,bellecasey,8,Thu Jun 25 08:28:16 2015 UTC,If Jack called someone a murderer/rapist the viewers would lose their shit but because it's Helen everyone will be fine with it.
bbuk,3azvqf,MABGB,11,Wed Jun 24 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"What does Nikki having an eating disorder have to do with her acting like a child when she got hit in the face by a box?  As far as I'm concerned Marc is completely in the right with his argument with Brian. He wasn't saying anything about Brian and Brian had absolutely no response when Marc brought up the things he's lied about other than saying Marc isn't honest, when he is the most honest person in there."
bbuk,3azvqf,WezVC,3,Wed Jun 24 21:36:06 2015 UTC,"Eating Disorders are associated with anxiety. It's not uncommon to treat eating disorders as if they WERE anxiety. Simplified, you could see it as someone attempting to manage their anxiety through controlled (or uncontrolled) food consumption. In fact, many relate eating disorders to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder .. Anxiety attacks could well be related to her personal history, though really only Nikki could comment on that."
bbuk,3azvqf,ellelelle,5,Thu Jun 25 17:30:47 2015 UTC,"It's a long story that's been told here a hundred times, but basically in a lot of ways she's mentally a child"

bbuk,3azvqf,Gladiator995,3,Wed Jun 24 22:22:09 2015 UTC,Did Helen actually call Brian a murderer and rapist?
bbuk,3azvqf,Kigurumix,7,Wed Jun 24 21:38:13 2015 UTC,"Yer, and seems BB doesn't seem to care. Way too far."
bbuk,3azvqf,Smoking_Fish,8,Wed Jun 24 21:41:10 2015 UTC,That is crossing the line and any microscopic like I had for Helen has now evaporated.  She should have been removed from the house for that.

bbuk,3azvqf,Smoking_Fish,-3,Wed Jun 24 21:53:27 2015 UTC,"""you look like a rapist, murderer""  isn't that different than ""you're a rapist""  I don't know, I don't find her offensive."
bbuk,3azvqf,kyotonao,5,Wed Jun 24 23:21:55 2015 UTC,"I find her completely offensive, but I don't know why you're being downvoted for quoting her accurately.  Part of what I hate about her is that she's just smart enough to choose her words very carefully."
bbuk,3azvqf,wigsnatcher,4,Thu Jun 25 02:41:58 2015 UTC,"Probably because people don't like that I don't find her offensive.  He did look like he wanted to kill her, not that he would or had in his past. He just looked like he wanted to."
bbuk,3azvqf,kyotonao,2,Thu Jun 25 08:26:17 2015 UTC,"It's different because she knows she has no actual proof, and can get away with running her mouth off as ""her opinion""."

bbuk,3azvqf,tvwatcherguy,3,Wed Jun 24 21:22:52 2015 UTC,Problem is Helen dishes it out be cannot take it so she diverts to personal insults rather than further argue the point.
bbuk,3azvqf,Jotchee,6,Thu Jun 25 17:03:33 2015 UTC,People that play the nice guy act easily forget it's equally as annoying as people that play devils advocate.
bbuk,3azvqf,lukaeber,4,Wed Jun 24 21:26:12 2015 UTC,"People who play the ""villain"" easily forget that some nice people are actually just nice."
bbuk,3azvqf,ellelelle,5,Wed Jun 24 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know, saying someone looks like a murderer and a rapist (especially a black man) is pretty fuckin' evil."
bbuk,3azvqf,Jotchee,3,Thu Jun 25 03:48:37 2015 UTC,"It's especially heinous because I'm sure a black man could pick up the fact that it is probably a race related, but could never prove it. Helen would be smart enough to conceal that stuff."
bbuk,3azvqf,WezVC,2,Thu Jun 25 17:33:53 2015 UTC,"You gotta keep in mind that they have power in there, protected by production. That means their ""pretty mean"" behavior becomes much more intimidating to the other housemates, who have been made to feel expendable and powerless. The fact that there's no way to strike back at them probably makes tensions build up to the point where people are just flipping out from the pressure.  And then Helen, from the comfort of her privileged position, can sit back saying, ""Look at the state o' ya! Look at the state o' ya!"" so the other person looks like they're overreacting.  But if not for favoritism, the other housemates would have nominated the master-baiters and sent them packing already, without any ""overreactions""."
bbuk,3azvqf,mixdkinkster83,2,Wed Jun 24 21:42:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly Marc has barely done anything over the last few days yet people still act like it's ""the Marc and Helen show"".  I feel like what he said to Nikki was harsh but I feel like there was some sneaky editing there that cut a lot of the conversation. People bitch about them far more than they have ever bitched about anybody else, because they're upfront and honest.  I never root for the ""bad guy"" in BB but Marc is right, everybody else is just constantly kissing eachother's arses and it's so boring. Nick is the absolute worst for it."
bbuk,3azvqf,ellelelle,7,Wed Jun 24 21:31:27 2015 UTC,"Just because you are being ""honest or upfront"", doesnt mean you are not a horrible person or a jerk."
bbuk,3azvqf,Jotchee,2,Thu Jun 25 06:25:43 2015 UTC,"Seems like it's the horrible people who need to paint honesty as a virtue the most.. that's their justification for hurting people, after all."

bbuk,3azvqf,WezVC,6,Wed Jun 24 21:39:51 2015 UTC,"They are nasty to people's faces and behind their backs. The former doesn't negate the latter, although it seems to be an effective distraction.  Also, it's possible to be honest without being vicious or inconsiderate."
bbuk,3azvqf,lukaeber,2,Wed Jun 24 21:51:06 2015 UTC,That's what honesty is. I'd rather actually hear what somebody thinks about me than have them pretend to like me while they bitch about me.
bbuk,3azvqf,swizzlejr,8,Wed Jun 24 21:53:05 2015 UTC,No it isn't.  She intentionally antagonizes people.  Taking perverse pleasure in getting a rise out of people has nothing to do with being honest.

bbuk,3azvqf,WezVC,0,Thu Jun 25 10:48:07 2015 UTC,"He actually said something like, ""Whatever I say to your face, I'll say behind your back."" LOL  So he can say whatever he wants to someone's face, as long as he then goes and repeats it behind their back. That's a neat trick."
bbuk,3azvqf,Jotchee,2,Thu Jun 25 14:01:01 2015 UTC,"I get it, you don't like Marc.  If only he sat in the smoking area all day agreeing with everything anybody says about anyone."
bbuk,3azvqf,WezVC,5,Thu Jun 25 14:34:11 2015 UTC,"But it's not total honesty. It's just a manipulation, to make you think that they aren't saying even more nasty shit behind your back."
bbuk,3azvqf,Bunny_ofDeath,4,Wed Jun 24 21:55:26 2015 UTC,"Well I disagree, I haven't seen them say anything particularly nasty behind anybody's back that they haven't already said to their face.  After every single argument the rest of the housemates go off and bitch."
bbuk,3azvqf,WezVC,2,Wed Jun 24 21:56:21 2015 UTC,While Marc runs to the diary room to ensure the viewers understand his side of the argument.
bbuk,3azvqf,Jotchee,2,Thu Jun 25 10:19:44 2015 UTC,I don't see what's wrong with that. Every housemate has the same opportunity to do so. If I was in there I'd want to make sure the viewers understood exactly what I meant as well.

But then I'll go and tell everyone you know that you're the biggest fucking moron on the planet, you look like a pig, and are probably a pedophile.  But hey, I told you I thought you were dumb, right to your face, just brutal honesty. If you can't handle honesty, then that's your problem.  And then I go behind your back again and start telling everyone you're fake and can't take the truth, and how much I fucking hate you so much.  Now admire me for all that, for I am Helen, Teller of Like-It-Is-ness, Speaker of Truth. :P"
bbuk,3azvqf,lukaeber,4,Wed Jun 24 22:02:07 2015 UTC,"Well, you've massively exaggerated it there, that's nothing like what is going on in the house.  Helen, not so much. But Marc, I honestly wouldn't be watching the show if he wasn't on it."
bbuk,3azvqf,TheFreshPrince12,2,Wed Jun 24 22:03:47 2015 UTC,Being vicious is not the same thing as being honest.

bbuk,3azvqf,kyotonao,10,Thu Jun 25 11:09:15 2015 UTC,I think he held it in relatively well.  I don't know that I could have been as patient with her slandering me like that so viciously as Brian has been.
bbuk,3azvqf,Tomla,2,Thu Jun 25 04:06:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly, she's just a troll. I don't take the words or opinions of people I don't like so seriously. She just says stupid shit and they go insane. How can someone have such power over others emotions?"

bbuk,3azuzm,ConnDeReplay,5,Thu Jun 25 01:08:43 2015 UTC,Are the producers really that desperately disappointed in the cast and ratings for this series that they have to manufacture past housemate grudge matches? Was it going that badly?
bbuk,3azuzm,bellecasey,2,Thu Jun 25 02:08:09 2015 UTC,"I think it was, but at the same they didnt give the new roommates enough time to ""marinate"". If that makes any sense"
bbuk,3azuzm,mixdkinkster83,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:27:31 2015 UTC,"I think they jumped ship on their original casting so early, it was pretty obvious they were not happy. Four out, four in says it all. There were a lot of people that failed to live up to their characters as portrayed in their VT (Jade, Christian, Sarah, Danny, Kieran, those are the first to come to mind) so maybe Big Brother was pissed. What they don't realise is that many of these legends were just ordinary people being true to themselves, and they also did a lot of boring things.. Nikki excepted. They just also happened to get more airtime than the current housemates."
bbuk,3azuzm,ellelelle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:12:41 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about it earlier. Do you think that some of them put on a facade during auditions? It seems like it. I mean Nick came in a spoiled rich kid and thinks everyone hates him. But in reality, he is very meek.  You are right, the past housemates were big personalities. I wonder if they could even find people like that anymore."
bbuk,3azuzm,mixdkinkster83,2,Fri Jun 26 03:44:13 2015 UTC,"I think maybe it's a problem with their casting as they can't see through the facades their auditionees present. The rarely pick the genuinely eccentric people. Eileen and maybe Joel are the only ones this year, really. The go for standard kind of archetypes - the pretty girl, the pretty boy, the daddy protector, the villain, more villains, and maybe a few flamboyant showbiz characters that either stop giving or get booted out. I bet they could find people like that but they also appeal to career tv personalities so maybe they've been finding it hard to sieve between the poor impersonators and the real deal. Or maybe real and authentic people are going to get put off by the drama baiting and preferential treatment given to baiters and villains. It can't be an coicidence that the biggest legends are Channel 4 castings, not CHannel 5s."

bbuk,3b266l,Xerxias,3,Thu Jun 25 10:51:24 2015 UTC,Helen insulted the weight of a woman who has anorexia. That's all I have to say
bbuk,3b266l,rjolly,4,Fri Jun 26 20:21:54 2015 UTC,I've been down voted in the past for saying this but I did not like Helen one bit last year but this year I'm all for her. Her and Marc are not 'bullying' anyone. The only thing I did not agree with is how she said Brian looks like a murderer and rapist (and yes she said looked not IS like the housemates said) However I do think Brian would have got violent if not on camera. You could see it on his face. Zero respect for him.
bbuk,3b266l,TheDmac,3,Sat Jun 27 00:16:57 2015 UTC,"I don't agree but a lot of young women do thing its a 'smart' and acceptable thing that is a man makes you feel bad then you can accuse him of rape or spread rumours he might be a rapists or LOOK like a rapist.  BBUK is notorious for petty 'PC' policing, word-crime and think-speak nonsense HOWEVER in this case they are actually correct and here's what it comes to: - You can't actually accuse someone of a crime or even infer, insinuate or start associating their appearance with criminal activities and especially rape, pedophilia, murder, child-abuse etc.   If you don't believe this then let me start suggesting to the OP she REMINDS me of a person who hurts and abuses children. Her WRITING LOOKS LIKE the writing of a child-abuser. Someone who, when babysitting and nobody is looking would punch and smack children.   I can't do that. The OP can report that and this comment will be deleted. Why? Because its not the same as me 'hurting the OPs feelings' or calling her a 'bitch' or even saying something 'racist' against Americans or 'sexist' (or something thats 'insulting').  No, it would be insinuating actual crimes and even worse if I go about suggesting u/Xerxias looks to me like a child-abuser that can destroy your reputation (unjustly). It will spread around, rumours start. We start hearing ""you know I heard Xersias .. i dunno.. something about smacking toddler once"".   And when I say 'crime' this really is a legal issue we must understand. Seriously. This is something decided by BBUK Lawyers. They really are doing that for legal purposes because Brian could have a helluva slander, false criminal accusation sort of case.  And this is why Helen shouldn't have been invited back. Because there is a difference between being a Nasty Nick (who'd be adorable by today's standards) and then being such a despicable lowlife that at her age she's doing vindictive teen girl shlt like creating a 'false rapey narrative' about Brian of all people. I guess because he's tall so hence 'rapey'.   Good thing is the public and producers saw through it immediately and she was severely caught and warned this isn't a nightclub or a college.   'EvilDick' isn't a comparison. BBUSA (by Dick's episode) was a written 'simulated Big Brother' and he was doing things arranged and condoned and even written for him to do. Including throwing a glass of water in a girls face which was prearranged and done as a 'task' then edited to appear as a spontaneous events. Like almost everything on the fake BBUSA's you see now. They are basically 'reenactments' of Big Brother seasons. Not real seasons."
bbuk,3b266l,JuiceBusters,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:13:58 2015 UTC,"There was no false narrative. He stood up to fight her, what was she supposed to do? She defended herself the only way she knows. And only after did a grown ass man attempt to fight her twice. He did look like a murderer go back and see the rage written all over him. That wasn't slanderous and she never charged him with the crime of murder/rape. Saying someone is acting a certain way and it's not good is not the same as accusing. Words matter you can't just ignore bits n pieces of her sentence that's not fair."
bbuk,3b266l,JuiceBusters,0,Thu Jun 25 16:42:40 2015 UTC,"No of course he wasn't standing up to fight her. He wasn't attempting to fight her twice either.   he did look angry. just as your words are angry and defensive. So what else am I supposed to do but insinuate that you would probably say racist things here and you sound like the Charleston Church murderer in the way you write.   And I will assure you of something and you can bet on this and remember I told you and years from now you might get confirmation on this but for anyone reading this is undoubtedly the situation: - Her accusations fall into BBUK Lawyers' hands and that is exactly why it was stopped, she was warned and why certain words are not allowed to be used on BBOTS, by Helen or anyone in BBUK staff or otherwise. (if you noticed they cannot and will not replay or even use the terms in descriptions of the events). Lawyers did that because yes it can be a legal problem.  But anyways you sound just like that Church Shooter racist murderer who said the people in that church looked like rapists because they looked black. Hey, according to you he defended himself in the only way he knows right?"
bbuk,3b266l,JuiceBusters,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:57:14 2015 UTC,No he did get up once and came at her Danny stopped him. And feel free to say I look like w/e cuz it's not true. And your getting way too upset over this lol.
bbuk,3b266l,JuiceBusters,0,Thu Jun 25 17:14:48 2015 UTC,"Whatevs racist.   hey, you were upset but then said that I was upset and came after you lol.. so clever!   But seriously, you might need to contact BBs legal team because while Helen and everyone else go up to each other to argue and shout it was only Brian that was described as 'murderous' or 'rapist'.   But of course that does bring the question to you - why did you think he looked like a murderer and rapist but the other don't when they confront other HMs in the same manner?  Seriously.. ask yourself that."
bbuk,3b266l,ellelelle,0,Thu Jun 25 17:44:02 2015 UTC,I mean if someone told Danny he looked like a psycho killer during his freakout on pizza boxes I would agree. There is no prior statement to defend that's similar. And it was only Brian who wanted to hit her. Foreigners are just made of glass apparently.
bbuk,3b266l,ellelelle,-1,Thu Jun 25 17:50:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm no, Danny attacked Pizza boxes. Inanimate objects. But had someone been an immature vindictive teen girl like yourself and said she felt he looked like a rapist and psychotic killer coming at HER then there would be monster problems. Huge legal problems.  None of the HMs are foreigners. They are all British citizens or permanent residents (or at least have residential visas of some sort)."
bbuk,3b266l,JuiceBusters,3,Thu Jun 25 17:55:24 2015 UTC,"well, except Marc and Jade!"
bbuk,3b266l,scratchmellotron,2,Thu Jun 25 20:47:26 2015 UTC,attempting to fight a female over words is a thousand times worst than an observation    you must think it's alright to hit a woman with an opinion     what!?
bbuk,3b266l,fefe2000,2,Thu Jun 25 18:02:12 2015 UTC,"Okay lets get back to the thing where you falsely accused a black man of being violent and having rapist tendencies. I'm sorry but I don't agree with you that because someone is black in appearance they are 'raping our women and murdering us'.  I guess what I'm asking is that when you feel threatened because of your racist beliefs do you have the right to falsely accuse men of rape just because its how you like to keep winning the fight you started?   Well, i guess you think its alright to shoot black people who dare have opinions different than yours."
bbuk,3b266l,ZombieDonShula,2,Thu Jun 25 20:48:20 2015 UTC,"Your the only one bringing his race into this. If a black,white,yellow,red,purple or pink person tried to hit helen I would defend her. He looked like a murderer trying to murder helen. Did she goad into doing this?yes. But it's his fault for reacting that way. If someone tried to fight me I know I would call them worst than a rapist. And he wasn't accused of raping or murdering just rather he looks like he can. It has nothing to do with race, your like a thousand times more racist than me. Bringing race into it, a nonfactor."
bbuk,3b266l,WezVC,2,Thu Jun 25 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. A lot of the hate she gets is probably fuelled by the favouritism she got from the producers last year. I think she was a great housemate, but even I feel bitter about her pass to the final, and the blatantly false redemption she got via editing that many people fell for.  That said, I totally understand why a lot of people would hate her just because of how she acts."
bbuk,3b266l,WezVC,2,Thu Jun 25 18:33:40 2015 UTC,"Helen is a PROVOCATIVE housemate and excellent TV.  This season was seriously boring drivel before the sht-stirrers entered the house.  It *IS a game, and she plays it very well."
bbuk,3b266l,WezVC,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, I was bout ready to be done with this boring version of BB then helen came in and the show got interesting again. But apparently playing a game well is a crime in the UK version."
bbuk,3b266l,big_phat_gator,2,Thu Jun 25 17:21:57 2015 UTC,"I think you're right but I wouldn't expect much support. The clique waits for Helen or Marc to say anything at all and they all pounce.  On rewatch, I think Helen-haters would be surprised at how often she's roasted as the ultimate evil when she's really playing on the defensive, being personally attacked for tasks Big Brother placed on her. And really is calling someone psycho (when they are clearly acting erratically) somehow more offensive than calling someone evil? The clique calls Helen all kinds of terrible names, they're just only brave enough to whisper."
bbuk,3b266l,big_phat_gator,2,Thu Jun 25 17:25:55 2015 UTC,"""Only brave enough to whisper"" fuck that's right Jack being the worst of it. I wasn't expecting support honestly. So even your statement makes me happy."
bbuk,3b266l,big_phat_gator,3,Thu Jun 25 11:21:39 2015 UTC,Jack last night was the worst.  Jack: I'm on Brian's side in this.  Danny: Don't take sides.  Panicked Jack: Okay no yeah you're right I'm not taking sides but I feel for Brian.
bbuk,3b266l,big_phat_gator,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:28:09 2015 UTC,Jack is always the worst. All he does is in his bed and bitch/talk shit but yet when it comes to put money where his mouth is its the only time of day he won't open it.
bbuk,3b266l,big_phat_gator,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:37:50 2015 UTC,"I'm with you 100%.  I don't like Helen by any means but at least she has her own personality. As far as Brian goes I did watch his series and his return has been a complete fall from grace in my eyes. He seems to be one of the biggest bitches in there, the way he talks about how they've completely changed Joel and are having a negative influence on him just because he stood up for himself."
bbuk,3b266l,ellelelle,-3,Thu Jun 25 11:45:24 2015 UTC,"Brian seems like a 4Chan white knight from my highschool days. I think after this series' I might even watch Helens. As I'm starting to like her and want to see why I should feel bad for it.(not saying you said I should, just seems she's so hated I might be iin the wrong lol)"
bbuk,3b266l,ellelelle,3,Thu Jun 25 11:36:28 2015 UTC,"I never watched Helen's either! I should clarify I definitely don't hate Helen and I'm really glad she's in the house, but I don't always support a lot of what she says whereas with Marc I always seem to be on his side.   The rest of the group always say how those two team up when really it's the rest of the house constantly trying to take them down and failing. They'll have a huge argument, then next minute all of the ""big names"" will still be sat down chatting with them again."
bbuk,3b266l,ellelelle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:44:30 2015 UTC,"Marc is alright but yeah you tend see him/helen fight the clique. Then the clique leaves to another room to keep bitching and you'll see ""the evil two"" talking to simon/joel/whoever bout random shit, cuz well they moved on. ""The clique"" reminds me a hell of a lot of BBUS6' ""the friendship"".        Edit: fixed an autocorrect."
bbuk,3b266l,ellelelle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:01:31 2015 UTC,"Helen is very childish, people who say they are honest all the time just has issues handling social codes and norms. They cant fit in and to justify that instead of working on the issues they have, they simply straight out says ""Well im just being honest thats all it is"". Always telling people straight to there face what you think even if that is your honest opinion can and will create uncomfortable situations, everyone except a child knows this. Its the same with why you get honest answers from children and drunk people."
bbuk,3b266l,Smoking_Fish,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:05:31 2015 UTC,I agree in real life. BB isn't that. you live in a house with all the people you either like or don't. I would much rather be around a helen who HATED me cuz I know she isn't speaking behind my back like a pussy. Unlike jack who will tell you how funny(or whatever) then turn to his friends and proceed to talk shit bout me. Now if this is real life then just leave.
bbuk,3b266l,bellecasey,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:50:03 2015 UTC,"But you can live with a Jack for years but Helen just a week or two, thats the difference. I could agree with you if Big Brother was just a week or two but try living with a Helen for two months and i can tell you that you would change your opinions very quickly. Big brother is about surviving and having fun, not argue and confrontations."
bbuk,3b266l,ellelelle,0,Thu Jun 25 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"To me it's always been about winning. Every person who entered that house wants to win and thinks they have a way. Its about surviving,winning and being entertaining. Atleast to me."
bbuk,3b266l,ellelelle,2,Thu Jun 25 18:07:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah and the best way to do that is to accept that there are people like Jack in the house and then find a way to live with it, he doesnt get up in your face and he doesn't irritate you 24/7. Brian might have had issues but was a perfect example of why you cant live with a Helen for very long. But yeah, i could easily ignore Helen also even if she got up in my face but it would just be a bit more annoying."
bbuk,3b266l,ellelelle,0,Thu Jun 25 18:10:51 2015 UTC,Thing is Jacks way would irritate me 24/7 I'd feel like all he ever does is lie to me.
bbuk,3b266l,ellelelle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah but thats all in your head, you could just as easily tell yourself that he doesn't lie to you and then be on with it. With Helen she is in your face..."
bbuk,3b266l,ellelelle,-1,Thu Jun 25 18:16:59 2015 UTC,But you know he is. How can I know someone is constantly(since that's how it would feel) trashing my name behind my back but then try to be nice to him or her? Sorry but jack is the most 2faced HM this season. Atleast his cohorts will say shit to whoever they don't like. Not just hide in bed.
bbuk,3b266l,ellelelle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:51:44 2015 UTC,"Just accept the fact that he has opinions about you wether they are true or not, you may not like them but you know what, just suck it up and try to not think about it and hold on for 2 months is way easier then to deal with someone like Helen for hell 2 weeks."
bbuk,3ay029,CRB94,17,Wed Jun 24 12:12:37 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely miss Brian, but I don't think his stint in the house has tarnished his reputation. Being a housemate is very different to being a mentor, which is the position he was placed in after coming in halfway through. He knew the publics perception of people, and he knew how the public viewed people like Helen, so instead of being able to just relax and enjoy himself like he did last time, he constantly felt as though he had to protect people that he saw as venerable. He's still one of the BBUK greats in my eyes."
bbuk,3ay029,JonathanSloanAUS,5,Wed Jun 24 12:17:50 2015 UTC,Well put. Hes alot more normal than Helen (bitch) and Nikki (mental) so prob why it's affected him more
bbuk,3ay029,Smoking_Fish,5,Wed Jun 24 13:08:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think people actually had standards for Brian, whereas nobody expects much from Helen, for example. But I don't think Brian has done anything really awful, he just responded to the utter bullshit of the situation. Compare him to Helen and Marc and he's obviously got relatively good intentions.  And without him there, I think we'd probably still only have Harry standing up against Marc. Nobody would be challenging Helen at all. So it's definitely a good thing that Brian was in there for balance."
bbuk,3ay029,Jotchee,3,Wed Jun 24 13:36:38 2015 UTC,booooooooo. I did not like him in last nights epi when he first was laughing at Nikki entering the DR then quickly changed his tone. I still do not want him to go
bbuk,3ay029,ok_then23,2,Wed Jun 24 13:45:53 2015 UTC,Probably needs some Jade lovin.
bbuk,3ay029,originalnutta,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think he has ""anger issues"". He never lashed out at anyone. He got very angry, he was baited on many occasions, but he managed to hold back. I can't say the same for Helen. I won't miss him in the sense that I don't think this series is or should be about him, but it's a pity he won't be there to see the ""legends"" grudge match. The original housemates are looking more and more filler by the day. It's embarrassing."
bbuk,3ay029,ellelelle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:02:33 2015 UTC,What are they supposed to do when most of the HMs won't do anything more than lay on the bed and bitch or lay on the couch and bitch? They have to make the show interesting enough for people to wanna watch. Just bad casting it seems to me.
bbuk,3ay029,Xerxias,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:17:47 2015 UTC,Did Harry go too?  She was mysteriously absent from today's episode entirely.
bbuk,3ay029,lukaeber,0,Thu Jun 25 04:07:47 2015 UTC,Won't miss him. He clearly has anger issues. So many times he was at boiling point over nothing. You could see it in his eyes. Not to mention he lied on multiple occasions.
bbuk,3ay029,TheDmac,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:22:12 2015 UTC,Take it from me no one here reads eyes.
bbuk,3ay029,Xerxias,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:15:09 2015 UTC,Haha the guy looked like he was going to burst. I think Helen had a point. He would have got violent if he wasn't on camera
bbuk,3ay029,TheDmac,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:54:42 2015 UTC,Without doubt. She was also on point when she said he had an obsession with women.
bbuk,3ay029,Xerxias,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:58:29 2015 UTC,Glad to see I'm not the only one who didn't like Brian and saw what he could (potentially) do! Every one seems to be in love with these BB 'legends' but I don't like any of them apart from Helen who I absolutely hated last year!
bbuk,3ay029,TheDmac,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:13:06 2015 UTC,I've never seen any of them before but was expecting brian to be the one I liked and helen the one who made me cringe. Instead it was the opposite I don't see how people think FIERCELY defend their own is bullying. Marc is just making nsfw jokes. I don't even wanna bother with thursday episode it's just yelling at helen for bs reasons since nikki gets a friend(and coincidentally a backbone) i'll tune back in for the eviction episode.
bbuk,3ay029,Xerxias,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:35:05 2015 UTC,It baffles me as to how the majority are on Nikki's and  Brians side. I never watched their series so I had no opinion on them before they entered the house so maybe that's why I'm on Helens side. They must be reality tv national treasure or something
bbuk,3ay029,TheDmac,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:05:43 2015 UTC,Yeah idk. I think since people said she's a bully last season so therefore bullying her back is ok. I don't agree with it but w/e. I genuinely like Helen I will watch her season to rip people apart.
bbuk,3ay029,Xerxias,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:03:47 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, because an eye for an eye is ALWAYS the right way to go about it!  Last season was great, you'll enjoy It :)"
bbuk,3ay029,TheDmac,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:21:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm waiting for this BBUK to end first, as I'm watching BBUS too atm so 3 BigBrothers would just be a bit much."

bbuk,3b0fmi,wigsnatcher,2,Thu Jun 25 17:19:59 2015 UTC,She hates Helen and she will voice her opinion and she'll stick up for Nikki so I can't wait to see her in the house.
bbuk,3b0fmi,Jordy_Banks,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:11:21 2015 UTC,"I think the viewers probably do want it but i also think it will detract from the nasty shit Helen has already done in the house. Like you say, there is a chance we will start to feel sorry for Helen. I don't want to see anyone ganged up on. Aisleyne is a strong character, she won't bow to Helen and I don't think Helen will be able to take it."
bbuk,3b0fmi,ellelelle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:59:28 2015 UTC,"More horrible confrontation. I like her as much as the next BB fan, but even she has said she can't control her temper around Helen and I'm getting a bit sick of this series setting up pathetic old grudge matches to distract from the actual cast. If this cast was a dud, fine, accept it, stop dredging up the past to cover for it"
bbuk,3avtny,jaggedllama,6,Tue Jun 23 22:22:11 2015 UTC,Nikki's face in general has been the highlight of the season.

bbuk,3avtny,henry82,8,Wed Jun 24 21:45:56 2015 UTC,They should have let her ass walk out that door.  Tired of BB keeping people in who say they wanna go. eg. Brian and Nikki

bbuk,3awlkx,chriskicks,4,Wed Jun 24 02:16:16 2015 UTC,Not to mention how Nick and Harry were mooching off the side while everything kicked off.  Couldn't have chosen a perfect timing for some more comedic value 😂
bbuk,3awlkx,hoolytoledo,2,Wed Jun 24 07:00:57 2015 UTC,I had to replay that moment a few times. I love how much fun everyone was having.
bbuk,3awlkx,brick-face,2,Wed Jun 24 04:47:09 2015 UTC,"Nikki is wildly entertaining in almost any scenario, I can't get enough of her. I do feel bad for thinking her meltdown was so hilarious, because the BOTS panel spoke about how that was a real panic attack."

bbuk,3awlkx,cheesehead99,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:00:20 2015 UTC,It's fucking irritating and stupid. She puts on a show and it's so obvious and pathetic.
bbuk,3avler,Gladiator995,5,Tue Jun 23 21:20:04 2015 UTC,I'm surprised Nick has put up with it for this long. He should just leave it and move beds.
bbuk,3avler,cheesehead99,9,Wed Jun 24 15:56:51 2015 UTC,"I think Nick is just a lost puppy at this point. This would be a totally new experience for him, he still has confusing feelings for her, he doesn't want to hurt her, probably fears her wrath hahaha and is easily manipulated by her attention seeking games. I could hardly believe he stayed in the bed with her after she tried to pretend he was snoring when he wasn't even asleep, but the poor guy probably started to believe it himself.   A big part of Nick is his lack of self esteem, he probably thinks he's lucky to have a girl interested in him at all :("
bbuk,3avler,bellecasey,7,Tue Jun 23 22:02:12 2015 UTC,When I see Nick and Harry together anymore it just feels so cringe and it's going to hurt him in the game.  It's a shame because I really like him. I honestly hope she and Jack go this Friday.  The house would be in such a better state if that happened.
bbuk,3avler,sanyosukotto,2,Wed Jun 24 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"I hope Harry leaves soon for her own good. She seems to be having some difficulty in dealing with her emotions and taking that out on Nick has done her no favours. Saying that, I think Nick would be lost without her and Jade. People talk about housemates using Nick (like Harry implying Nikki was... which was ridiculous) but I think Nick benefits from these relationships just as much if not more. He craves the affection and he is submissive so I think it's more likely he would be drawn to women who are more upfront and demonstrative. I think that's why Nick has let Harry's behaviour fly for this long. It's sweet that he seems to want to give her time to calm down so they can go back to being whatever they are but she does need someone to reel her in and explain why her behaviour is completely irrational and actually a bit worrying."
bbuk,3avler,ellelelle,2,Thu Jun 25 16:55:05 2015 UTC,Why doesn't Nick stop being a massive coward and actually tell her to bugger off?   I guess he likes it (unfortunately).
bbuk,3avler,spaceageclockwork,3,Tue Jun 23 21:51:09 2015 UTC,It will be a miracle if she doesn't get evicted this week.
bbuk,3avler,originalnutta,6,Wed Jun 24 01:10:31 2015 UTC,if I could vote it would be for her. In her VT she tried coming off as a damm bad ass but really is just teenage brat
bbuk,3avler,ok_then23,6,Wed Jun 24 13:50:22 2015 UTC,Because Nick isn't exactly the alpha male type. He's in too deep now and there's no way he has the balls to change anything.
bbuk,3avler,WezVC,2,Tue Jun 23 21:57:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he doesn't have ""the balls"" - he doesn't have the heart, poor guy. He wouldn't want to hurt her"

bbuk,3av2d8,ed2rummy,-1,Tue Jun 23 23:03:27 2015 UTC,She has done it in other relationships. She needs a psychiatrist woman with stories similar to hers they always seem to be molested at some point.
bbuk,3av2d8,lukaeber,5,Wed Jun 24 02:32:18 2015 UTC,Hopefully the public will do what Nick is too much of a pussy to do and send her packing on Thursday.

bbuk,3av2d8,gotbeff,8,Tue Jun 23 21:19:40 2015 UTC,Not defending her but I think Harry has some obvious insecurity issues and the pressure of that house and the intensity between them is probably making that all the worse for her. One of them needs to go.
bbuk,3av2d8,Jotchee,2,Tue Jun 23 21:37:15 2015 UTC,They were back to making out before the episode ended. I don't think they're really as upset with each other as it seems.
bbuk,3av2d8,Kigurumix,7,Wed Jun 24 03:02:00 2015 UTC,Looks like big brother is finally punishing them for sleeping all day.
bbuk,3av2d8,086bagofcats,5,Tue Jun 23 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"Really enjoyed that episode, it reminded me of bb of old with a bit of rebellion and bb trying to get it under control. I totally understood Nikki's panic attack, I'd be the same. Its all fun and games until someone gets dazzled in the head!"
bbuk,3av2d8,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Tue Jun 23 23:06:22 2015 UTC,"The good ole days  And, of course"
bbuk,3av2d8,JammaWho,4,Wed Jun 24 02:29:53 2015 UTC,Ahh this was one of my favourite years!
bbuk,3av2d8,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Wed Jun 24 06:26:58 2015 UTC,Every week it got better and better.
bbuk,3av2d8,bellecasey,6,Wed Jun 24 06:27:59 2015 UTC,Nick actually seemed like he was trying to kindly suggest he and Harry should finish things when they were talking outside
bbuk,3av2d8,Kigurumix,11,Tue Jun 23 23:47:48 2015 UTC,In the diary room I loved that Brian called Helen a dementor.
bbuk,3av2d8,bellecasey,4,Tue Jun 23 21:15:58 2015 UTC,"Haha or ""a Dementia"""
bbuk,3av2d8,gotbeff,9,Wed Jun 24 04:26:41 2015 UTC,"Why does it seem like Helen accuses genuine people of game playing whereas all the obnoxious, air time grabbers, she praises for being 'honest'?"
bbuk,3av2d8,Jotchee,12,Tue Jun 23 21:47:30 2015 UTC,"I think she's the type who finds it so hard to be positive that she has to convince herself that positivity is fake, to make herself feel better. She needs to believe her dementor tendencies are good, that it's ""honesty""."
bbuk,3av2d8,the_cucumber,2,Wed Jun 24 02:58:12 2015 UTC,Haha dementor tendencies
bbuk,3av2d8,ed2rummy,4,Wed Jun 24 22:27:00 2015 UTC,"It is one those 1st GF is the worst, 2nd gf is the ... Nick is only going to learn once he gets his heart broken."
bbuk,3av2d8,Tomla,7,Wed Jun 24 02:42:25 2015 UTC,"Marc, when you start your DR by proclaiming that women owe men sex just for existing for a year (It's the law? LOLOLOLOL), everything else you say after it loses all credibility."
bbuk,3av2d8,im_back_baby,4,Wed Jun 24 02:40:17 2015 UTC,Who's gonna go on Friday?
bbuk,3av2d8,WezVC,12,Tue Jun 23 21:46:28 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Jack.  There are a few people I dislike in there, but he is genuinely annoying to watch."
bbuk,3av2d8,bellecasey,8,Tue Jun 23 22:02:38 2015 UTC,"Jack or Harry, fingers crossed"
bbuk,3av2d8,lukaeber,8,Tue Jun 23 22:37:06 2015 UTC,Jack AND Harry
bbuk,3av2d8,bellecasey,4,Wed Jun 24 02:33:40 2015 UTC,Is it a double?
bbuk,3av2d8,lukaeber,7,Wed Jun 24 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know ... with this many nominees, I wouldn't be surprised.  I hope it is."
bbuk,3av2d8,bellecasey,3,Wed Jun 24 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"I do too, although they almost always mention upfront if it's a double to build hype"
bbuk,3av2d8,086bagofcats,7,Wed Jun 24 04:27:27 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping Harry, I'd like to see what Nick is like when he's not being whipped ;p"
bbuk,3av2d8,originalnutta,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:04:12 2015 UTC,I bet he's still boring.
bbuk,3av2d8,Tomla,3,Wed Jun 24 07:35:52 2015 UTC,"Sam, Joel, Jack, Danny, and Simon did really well with the secret task. That was entertaining :)"
bbuk,3av2d8,bellecasey,3,Wed Jun 24 03:03:56 2015 UTC,"I loved Danny's last resort tactic to get away from her by just repeating ""YOU'RE BANG OUT OF ORDER"" as he leaves without explaining what he even means"
bbuk,3av2d8,Tomla,2,Wed Jun 24 04:29:01 2015 UTC,"Hah! Yeah :) I was surprised, I expected at least one of them to break and slip up."
bbuk,3av2d8,Tomla,3,Wed Jun 24 04:41:17 2015 UTC,"The shot of Nick and Harry snogging outside the pantry while the rest of the HMs are inside throwing Weetabix genuinely made me laugh out loud, heh."
bbuk,3av2d8,Tomla,5,Wed Jun 24 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"Helen, commenting on the 'rebellion' ""It's like, you know like when kids at school are thinking they're being badasses?""  Yes, Helen, I know exactly what you're talking about. I feel that almost 100% of the time you are speaking."
bbuk,3av2d8,Tomla,4,Wed Jun 24 03:12:35 2015 UTC,"Seriously, Joel? After all that grandstanding about specific and accurate nomination reasons you did in yesterday's episode it took you only 5 seconds to revert to ""Well, there was only 3 people left to nominate!"" when your weak nomination reason was mildly challenged as false?"
bbuk,3av2d8,Kigurumix,2,Wed Jun 24 02:48:31 2015 UTC,Big Brother is getting serious tonight.  This is not going to end well for the housemates.
bbuk,3av2d8,TheFreshPrince12,3,Tue Jun 23 21:54:01 2015 UTC,"Brian is so wrong about Joel. He is level-headed and makes his own decisions. Joel is on his own team and won't be influenced by either ""side"" of the house. This house is so annoying because apparently anyone who agrees with another person is automatically a ""brown-noser."" It basically means ""I think this housemate is an ass licker because he talks to someone I don't like."""
bbuk,3av2d8,Jotchee,5,Wed Jun 24 00:33:04 2015 UTC,"They've got bullshit buzz words to negatively describe any type of behavior.  If you're nice, you're ""fake"".  If you're impartial, you're a ""fence-sitter"".  If you're upset, you're ""playing the victim"".  Anything they do in there, someone (probably Helen or Marc) is going to spin it into a negative. (Even if they're also spinning the same behavior as positive when they're doing it.) And it makes sense because the show is now almost entirely about tearing other people down, rather than rising up on one's own merits."
bbuk,3av2d8,Gladiator995,0,Wed Jun 24 03:14:19 2015 UTC,That was a shit rebellion
bbuk,3av2d8,hoolytoledo,4,Tue Jun 23 21:50:01 2015 UTC,"I was genuinely excited to see something like this happen other than people claiming they're ""brown-nosing"" who and all that boring nonsense.  And l literally had no idea what that term even meant until Marc began to say it a lot."
bbuk,3aru7l,dunave,11,Tue Jun 23 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"Hey now, she occasionally cries over nothing in front of men she know will get up and stupidly defend her honour and make an ass out of themselves. Quality television -rolls eyes-"
bbuk,3aru7l,bellecasey,6,Tue Jun 23 00:21:47 2015 UTC,"I remember Chloe's VT and I got really excited about her.  She may have seemed like a 'normal' person, not fame hungry or anything like that but that is what excited me.  I thought she would be similar to Jade Goody but boy has she been a let down."
bbuk,3aru7l,CRB94,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:09:37 2015 UTC,Normal and Jade Goody don't belong in the same sentence.
bbuk,3aru7l,pfliegerz,4,Thu Jun 25 18:11:04 2015 UTC,I like her! I get the most enjoyment from bb from one liners. Her comments about mark wearing his pants to intimidate them with his balls as hilarious
bbuk,3aru7l,chrissiecott,2,Tue Jun 23 10:51:09 2015 UTC,Not as bad as Sam who was in a few years back. The dude slept his way through BB
bbuk,3aru7l,TheDmac,5,Thu Jun 25 11:19:20 2015 UTC,Yea shes a pain in the ass to watch
bbuk,3aru7l,branhoo88,3,Tue Jun 23 02:20:59 2015 UTC,They're allowing people onto the show again besides Marc and Helen?
bbuk,3aru7l,Tomla,7,Tue Jun 23 00:31:17 2015 UTC,"It's not because she's being overshadowed by Marc or Helen, it's that since she entered the house she really has done almost nothing of real worth.   I completely agree that people shouldn't be absolute twats just for TV and for more viewing time under the umbrella of 'entertainment', but Chloe would be a background HM in any season. She hasn't done anything unless it's related to those loud, obnoxious HMs like Marc and Helen.   Before they entered she still was a background HM and I just feel she is adding so little to the experience that I can't see the point in her being there anymore. Yes she's a nice girl and I'm not asking for her to be crazy or a prick, but at least add something."
bbuk,3aru7l,jyunga,2,Tue Jun 23 00:37:45 2015 UTC,EVERYONE is being overshadowed by Marc and Helen. It's been the Marc show since he entered the house.
bbuk,3aru7l,AcePlague,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:00:19 2015 UTC,Better than the dany and Christian show.
bbuk,3aru7l,pfliegerz,0,Thu Jun 25 12:01:25 2015 UTC,"Well what do you want her to do? If you're a twat, everyone hates you, but you get the camera time. If you're not a twat, everyone hates you because you get no camera time.   It's not like she can go next door to Tesco and get the makings for a Thanksgiving feast per no request from anyone but rather doing it from the goodness of her heart. She's trapped with whatever drama Big Brother fabricates and Marc and Helen (and I guess Aislepropylene now) perpetuate."
bbuk,3aru7l,ellelelle,2,Thu Jun 25 18:14:26 2015 UTC,hahaha exactly.
bbuk,3aru7l,henry82,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:32:48 2015 UTC,Shes to appeal to the common nobody who cries for no reason.
bbuk,3ar2yj,tvwatcherguy,17,Mon Jun 22 20:42:47 2015 UTC,"I really like Nick, I would love to grab him by the shoulders and shake some sense into him. I said it from day one harry reeks of something bad. I couldn't quite put my finger on it. It's like watching the birth and evolution of a real life domesticly abusive relationship!"
bbuk,3ar2yj,AcePlague,8,Mon Jun 22 22:01:48 2015 UTC,"She's not right honestly, she shit herself when she got caught out lying about him snoring, threw a temper and hid under the blankets! All because she started an argument because she was jealous ! What a nutter!!"
bbuk,3ar2yj,gotbeff,10,Tue Jun 23 12:57:43 2015 UTC,I'm still trying to get over that bath scene we had yesterday. Seriously - what WAS that?! Why was he panting so heavily?? Why did that have to be something I watched with my mother???
bbuk,3ar2yj,RideOrDieRemember,13,Mon Jun 22 23:09:45 2015 UTC,"LMAO. I think the water might of been cold, not sure. I find it strange that Jack is always in the background watching them."
bbuk,3ar2yj,gotbeff,12,Mon Jun 22 23:17:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I found it weird that he was like... Commenting and chatting with them. It seemed like it was supposed to be a somewhat intimate moment and they had tweedle dumb gawping at them. The entire thing was odd.
bbuk,3ar2yj,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Mon Jun 22 23:19:19 2015 UTC,Jack seemed so jealous. And he was acting like he was welcome to stay and watch. Wtf Jack?
bbuk,3ar2yj,WezVC,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:36:43 2015 UTC,"I find it strange that Jack is always in the background watching them.   So, how did you feel tonight? That guy is strange as fuck."
bbuk,3ar2yj,bellecasey,4,Tue Jun 23 21:59:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured either the water was very hot or very cold, and it seemed like the poor guy got shampoo in his eyes too haha"
bbuk,3ar2yj,WickedBagel,3,Mon Jun 22 23:29:56 2015 UTC,That was disturbing I agree. like wtf?
bbuk,3ar2yj,bellecasey,6,Tue Jun 23 03:09:27 2015 UTC,Her accusing Nick of choosing her because he thinks he's more likely to get in her pants than Nikki's was actually disgusting and pathetic. I lost a lot of respect for her
bbuk,3ar2yj,ellelelle,4,Tue Jun 23 00:23:08 2015 UTC,"She is really struggling in there and not doing herself any favours. The fight was so awkward to watch. Nick does need to distance himself, she is not handling it well. I don't think she is capable of being fake, but that's not always a good thing. She is not handling her emotions very well and unleashing them on Nick is not helping anything."
bbuk,3ar2yj,ed2rummy,4,Tue Jun 23 07:37:23 2015 UTC,she only cares about how Nick makes her feel she does not care for Nick. Even on his birthday it was about her.
bbuk,3ar2yj,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Tue Jun 23 03:29:02 2015 UTC,I knew he would pick Harry for the reason he did. I did NOT think he would he tell her the reason. Is he fucking crazy?
bbuk,3ar2yj,lukaeber,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:35:50 2015 UTC,"Hopefully she leaves this week so he can get back on track.  She is fuckin' insane, and not the good kind of insane."
bbuk,3ar2yj,Kigurumix,8,Tue Jun 23 20:40:40 2015 UTC,So have they thrown out the rule about talking about nominations???  Everyone is discussing with other housemates who they want to nominate or who they think people should or will nominate.
bbuk,3ar2yj,bellecasey,4,Mon Jun 22 21:25:13 2015 UTC,I guess they're considering this round of nominations differently. It'll be funny when everyone gets busted for discussing the next round thinking it's okay
bbuk,3ar2yj,Beevo,6,Mon Jun 22 21:59:02 2015 UTC,"That rule to me makes sense when they do ""private"" nominations but now that they all seem to have to do their nominations in public, let them discuss it. They're not going to vent and get mean in their nominations now, let them stir up drama this way."
bbuk,3ar2yj,Kigurumix,7,Tue Jun 23 00:32:05 2015 UTC,I still think the process of who they choose should not be discussed regardless of how nominations are given because it is supposed to be that housemate's choice not who the people around them tell them to nominate.
bbuk,3ar2yj,ellelelle,4,Tue Jun 23 00:58:27 2015 UTC,ie. who Marc wants them to nominate. They are really letting Marc run the narrative.
bbuk,3ar2yj,ellelelle,4,Tue Jun 23 07:39:05 2015 UTC,I think that's why BB is doing it alright but it's annoying. They change the rules at their own discretion and the thing has no integrity.
bbuk,3ar2yj,RideOrDieRemember,16,Tue Jun 23 07:38:45 2015 UTC,"I miss diary room nominations where people said what they really think. These ""cop out"" reasons are dragging on a bit."
bbuk,3ar2yj,gotbeff,8,Mon Jun 22 21:46:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm sick of 'nom-bombs' too. Give us diary room bitching over this crap any old day.
bbuk,3ar2yj,bellecasey,6,Mon Jun 22 23:10:31 2015 UTC,I miss when noms were basically HMs venting about everything that drives them crazy about a person
bbuk,3ar2yj,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Mon Jun 22 22:20:32 2015 UTC,"It's like the face to face process was supposed to increase tension, but now everybody expects it and comes up with arse kissing lies."
bbuk,3ar2yj,ellelelle,4,Tue Jun 23 06:40:36 2015 UTC,yeah now it's just a device to outrightly hurt peoples feelings (and create drama)
bbuk,3ar2yj,Zulgrath,13,Tue Jun 23 07:37:50 2015 UTC,"I don't like the fact Marc has been safe since he entered the house, but wow these nominations this week really make me happy Marc isn't a possibility. The fact EVERY person is saying to each other: ""Oh, I'm so sorry I absolutely love you all and I would never want to nominate you..."" is utter bullshit. Pretty much says that the people who would be nominated by every original housemate are Sam, Simon, Marc and Harry. Coincidentally, the new housemates were nominated first (besides from Jade to Christian) although done by each other. I could see what Marc meant by the Clique keeping each other safe, but damn this is new-level frustrating."
bbuk,3ar2yj,ellelelle,2,Mon Jun 22 23:33:04 2015 UTC,It's annoying but what does Big Brother expect. I think it's their only resistance.. to refuse to lower themselves to bitching for the sake of it. They are being forced to go after each other.
bbuk,3ar2yj,scratchmellotron,12,Tue Jun 23 07:40:21 2015 UTC,Jack is such a hypocrite. But he's too dumb to understand it even when someone explains it to his face.
bbuk,3ar2yj,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Mon Jun 22 23:37:50 2015 UTC,Get Jack Out!
bbuk,3ar2yj,spaceageclockwork,10,Tue Jun 23 06:38:03 2015 UTC,Love Nikki's painting of Nick! :)
bbuk,3ar2yj,bellecasey,4,Mon Jun 22 21:44:37 2015 UTC,I hope he keeps it!
bbuk,3ar2yj,bellecasey,10,Mon Jun 22 23:58:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, Harry just lost a lot of respect from me for the things she accused Nick of this episode and the way she treated him. He didn't deserve any of that, especially on his birthday"
bbuk,3ar2yj,ellelelle,5,Tue Jun 23 00:24:02 2015 UTC,I agree. I have felt really sorry for Harry but if I actually knew her I'd be taking her aside and asking her if she thinks it is ok to lash out at people like that. She is having a problem regulating her emotions and expressing them and I understand it is a very heightened situation but she needs to stop. It was awful to watch.
bbuk,3ar2yj,henry82,4,Tue Jun 23 07:42:03 2015 UTC,"I wish he hadn't chosen her as the guest, knocked her down a peg or two"
bbuk,3ar2yj,bellecasey,8,Tue Jun 23 05:10:34 2015 UTC,Is it Harry's tongue piercings that make her constantly sound like she has a mouthful of food?
bbuk,3ar2yj,gotbeff,6,Mon Jun 22 22:19:43 2015 UTC,"She's very nasal, and I don't think her accent helps her case. It always sounds like she has a bad head cold."
bbuk,3ar2yj,bellecasey,6,Mon Jun 22 23:08:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a bad head cold, unhappy monotone and mouthful of toffee... I don't mind her but I honestly can't listen to her for too long without cringing"

bbuk,3ar2yj,bellecasey,8,Mon Jun 22 21:42:10 2015 UTC,She's Nikki Grahame... She IS a princess in that house

bbuk,3anviv,dunave,5,Mon Jun 22 01:27:34 2015 UTC,"Me me me!!!    I have been saying this for the past couple seasons.  Go ahead and pick some big characters to put in the house but let the natural process happen when it comes to tension and conflict, don't manufacture it.  This group of housemates were never given a chance to be outstanding because they wanted chaos from day one."
bbuk,3anviv,Kigurumix,4,Mon Jun 22 02:16:35 2015 UTC,"Agree. I'll even solve their big ""entertainment vs. integrity"" dillemma for them. Let the game play out fairly, but don't evict anyone. Just have the losers ""voted out"" of being eligible for the prize at the end and take away their nomination privileges, but keep them in the house to be shit-stirrers. That way they get to have their muppets like Helen and Marc in the show, without making the game pointless."
bbuk,3anviv,Jotchee,5,Mon Jun 22 02:57:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! There have been a few posts on here the last week or so that have made me pine for the good ol' days.  It's getting harder and harder to justify why I watch this show any more. The reason I fell in love with the show was because of the psychological aspect but now it's evolved psychological warfare.   On a related note I can't stand puking tasks! Once a season, maybe, but week after week it's too much. I dont understand how it's ok to show that on tv generally. They can't show somebody having a shit even though that doesn't make you want to shit, but seeing people puke makes me want to puke. Enough already!"
bbuk,3anviv,sillykittenpoo,2,Mon Jun 22 12:13:53 2015 UTC,"Strongly agree. I also loved the sometimes subtle and sometimes overt psychological warfare.   And extremely strong agreement on the puking tasks thing. I have absolutely no idea how that can be so popular its all but mandatory each season.   Personally, I turn off the TV and/or Fastforward. I don't understand how people love watching that??"
bbuk,3anviv,JuiceBusters,3,Mon Jun 22 17:54:12 2015 UTC,"It was fine when it was big brother being nice or big brother being nasty because it brought HM's together. BB knows as much psychologically about the HM's then as they do now but they're using it for the ratings game, for evil! Night 1: Simon point and case, they KNEW given his personality he'd be chosen and they KNEW he'd go for the middle podium, center stage was waiting, ""Showbiz!"" It's so calculated and planned it may as well be scripted.   Channel 5 have made a copy pasta format that's just a conveyor belt of wannabes and egocentrics who back in the day might have grown as a person not just their bank accounts and twitter followings."
bbuk,3anviv,sillykittenpoo,4,Mon Jun 22 18:24:25 2015 UTC,"I think it was somewhere after BB4 that they really went for the media-whorey types. I think BB saw a huge bonanza in finding 'Wannabe Celebs' and even better if they were arrogant and desperate and not nearly as hot as they think they are.   People LOVED it! They loved hating the hell out of anyone trying to be a big somebody.  But for me it started becoming a huge turnoff when I realized that yes that became a 'copy-paste formula' and even worse the Wannabes were themselves would-be actors or attention-seekers purposely 'acting like wannabes' AND even worse BB was playing along to play along to play along etc.  Then it almost became so standarized with every launch night its no less than 3 make-up queens entering to ""..she says she'll be the hottest housemate and plans to drive the boys crazy and make the girls jealousssss!"" add the male equivalents ""..He claims to be a top model who can make the gals melt on command and is too sexy for his shirtttttssss""  One thing I do like about this season - the boys and chloe. Its one of the rare times I see genuine people. They are real 20 year old boys who probably don't know how to 'manscape' and aren't exactly sure why anyone would be mean to Chloe and I like seeing that. I'd prefer most of them be real life normals but I dont know if most viewers will agree :("
bbuk,3anviv,JuiceBusters,3,Mon Jun 22 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely like a more basic series, but then again the best series of all time was 7, and they had a few big twists and new HMs that really made a lot of the greatest moments and characters. I think it comes down to execution, casting and the creative team"
bbuk,3anviv,bellecasey,3,Mon Jun 22 03:40:22 2015 UTC,"YESSSS!  I accept it will never happen but as a solid original old-skool BB Purist I WISH and dream this would happen just one more time in the series!  and by original untouched I'd like that to mean everyone with an internet connection or a TV channel can watch different cameras in the house 24/7.  yep.. that was a real thing.  There were no clocks or calendars and absolutely ANY outside communications from phones to newspapers or tvs or anything was absolutely forbidden.   Where the original social idea was a dozen COMPLETE STRANGERS who were from all walks of life. This did not mean 12 attractive 20-somethings from the same Agency who shout ""Oh I know youuuu! when they walk into the house"".   I don't mind face-to-face open nominations however one of the most intriguing dynamics was secret diary room nominations where the HM knew it would never be revealed in game. The suspicion, the guessing, the intrique was subtle and deadly.   Big Brother cannot and never reveals what anyone ever said about anyone else in game. This seems so exciting when a secret slur is replayed (the look on her face!) however.....  it works once then totally ruins the game, the show and steals your entertainment value because quite simply now every HM knows that any secret talks, insults or gossip can be just replayed to everyone the next hour or day. So they purposely STOP themselves from saying anything TOO dangerous. They carefully choose words. they now know it will be replayed and it sucks.   Strongly agree with the OP all these 'Pass to the Final' or 'Returning HMs' or making the nominated the 'safe ones' but everyone else surprise nominated....  this is BS, ruins the premise and dynamic and again it might be a 'crazy exciting twist' once. Then its just making the entire thing 'pointless' in a way. It becomes 'who cares?' moments when half the time none of it matters anyways.  The funny thing is that the only 'Twist' and 'Shock Season Theme' really is a 100% Original BB Series!  thats the one thing most of the younger viewers don't even know can happen or would be amazed to see. HMs themselves would find themselves shocked and surprised to find out there is actually NO TWISTS at all but that they are in a real serious BB season!!  Please let this happen. I know it wont. It will be another 'anything and nothing Summer Pool Party no-rules-any-rules' seasons but.. we can hope."
bbuk,3anviv,JuiceBusters,2,Mon Jun 22 08:58:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, right back at you. So much yes.  But they won't do it. Because producing the type of show you're describing is haaaarrrrrd-uh. It's easier for them to just produce repetitive, shallow bullshit and then manipulate viewers into thinking it's the height of entertainment.  ""OHNOES! We cast boring people! However did this happen? I guess we have to send in some new people, totally unplanned, we swear.   ""Ah, thank goodness for this amazing entertainer, Marc, who is entertaining. What luck that he turned out to be so entertaining! He sure is genuinely great in comparison to those other people we kept telling you were boring. They were so boring, boring, boring, weren't they? Yes, they were! I mean, who even cast these boring people?  ""But hallelujah our savior has arrived to rescue the show. Thank goodness it all just happened to work out this way. The show was boring, but now it's great!""  And viewers are like, ""Yup, I'll just accept the narrative the show is pushing becaus-- oh, look a shiny object!""  It's like if Coke released a new soda that tasted like dishwater, then acted all surprised at how bad it tasted, and immediately brought out another new product that tastes the same as Coke but comes in a slightly different package. That new Coke would seem better than it really is because of the comparison with the dishwater soda, which was never meant to be enjoyed in the first place."
bbuk,3anviv,Jotchee,3,Mon Jun 22 20:20:44 2015 UTC,"heh I noticed that too. Before Marc and Co showed up I don't think I knew anyone complaining this season was so boring. It did seem to be agreed these guys were actually more realistic, less ridiculous than usual.   Now, interesting thing - if I look back on the comments here on this subreddit a lot of them are VERY POSITIVE about that! In fact, many calling it 'refreshing'.   Yep, you are right that just prior to the '4-in-4-out twist' Emma and BBOTS and were - as if coached and memorized - repeating how these 'nice people were TOO nice' and 'now its time to get some LIFE IN THERE!' and I think I heard versions of that dropped 20 times.   Yep, almost like we're all hypnotized into the sales narrative, without thinking we just start repeating it ""Well... I guess they needed to do that because it was too boring"". ""I don't like it but they had to do something - like Emma/Rylan/BBots Panel said a dozen friends is sweet but its not good TV"".   I totally agree 'Lazy' has a lot to do with it now too. I can think of no better example than the ongoing story with the 3 boys who are having a real social experience that so many 19-21 year old men could relate to as one is lured to a bad girl. This could and would be a wonderful 'coming of age' story with tremendous subtle but important turns and negotiations and boys coming to terms and well.. growing up too. The PAST BB would have needed to follow that closely, focus, then really assign their editors to bringing out those sometimes small but key moments, conversations and emotions. I think it would be hard to do but pays off into an amazing substory that would even grab the hearts of viewers in a special...  NOPE...  ""Marcccc is feelin' frisky..."" Marc crashes into the room pumping his dong in front of Jade's face while she's cuddling Nick and smash cut to *""The boys are in the garden discussing Nick...WHEN MARC gets ANGRRYYYY and Sam LOSSSES IT"".   Basically I have what would be 2 or 3 interesting little personal stories now serving as temporary sets for Marc to launch some outrageous outrage or Over-the-Top Attitude into and then Nikki can scream and now ""..but HELEN has had enough of Marcccc!"" smash to senseless reality show fight.  HOly hell I just made myself suddenly very disappointed in this season :((((("

bbuk,3ao2wp,bellecasey,7,Mon Jun 22 04:20:15 2015 UTC,"It's so dumb, though, because they're already running out of legit reasons for nominating each other and it'll just get more insincere and silly as their options dwindle.  Last Person Nominating: ""I choose [only person left] because they're the only person left and ... and--""  BB: ""YOU MUST INSULT THE PERSON YOU ARE NOMINATING.""  LPN: ""I guess I don't like her haircut and ... um--""  BB: ""SPIT ON HER!""  And they'll all know they're just being forced to pretend to turn on each other so BB stops shouting at them."
bbuk,3ao2wp,Jotchee,2,Mon Jun 22 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"I know, I'm getting really fucking tired of the ""that is not a valid reason"". How is being less close with / liking someone less than everyone else NOT a valid reason? BB is just milking the drama and it's pathetic. Even in other nomination scenarios this series sometimes you can really tell people are like ""I have nothing else to say without making things up"", which is the exact opposite of what BB says they want"
bbuk,3ao2wp,bellecasey,2,Mon Jun 22 05:12:57 2015 UTC,This is exactly it.

bbuk,3amtbn,chlod4chlod,9,Sun Jun 21 19:40:28 2015 UTC,Watching Harry bathe Nick was a little bit strange. Adult baby anyone? Kind of cute and kind of weird at the same time.
bbuk,3amtbn,ellelelle,3,Sun Jun 21 21:32:06 2015 UTC,"I genuinely like Nick and wouldnt mind him winning, but I feel like Harry would never have gotten involved with someone like him outside the house."
bbuk,3amtbn,bobb77777,3,Sun Jun 21 21:51:06 2015 UTC,"She might never have gotten to know him outside the house. I think it's an artificial situation so it's obviously going to create artificial relationships. They are doomed anyway, even if they did like each other. The gold digger and using thing will follow them wherever they go."

bbuk,3amtbn,originalnutta,3,Mon Jun 22 04:08:54 2015 UTC,I like him but it definitely seems like he's coasting now and avoiding getting involved with anything.  Even when Christian made some good points about Harry's nomination he just lazily defended her.
bbuk,3amtbn,WezVC,4,Sun Jun 21 22:03:09 2015 UTC,"Spot on, he picked his time to coast and in fairness he has picked it well because there is enough drama going on for people to forget he is coasting, but the danger is people will just forget him full stop. He has always lazily defended Harry. If I was Harry, I'd be questioning whether or not he had any convictions or was just a coward."
bbuk,3amtbn,ellelelle,3,Sun Jun 21 22:17:24 2015 UTC,shes so done it before in her job
bbuk,3amtbn,henry82,4,Mon Jun 22 04:35:51 2015 UTC,I got a kick out of Jack's fascination with it. And Nick's freak-ay. :)
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,3,Sun Jun 21 23:54:34 2015 UTC,Nick is so adorable. I'm not sure what it is about him but he's so endearing. I don't mind Harry but I'm dying for her to leave so we can see more of him being himself again
bbuk,3amtbn,bellecasey,3,Mon Jun 22 03:45:36 2015 UTC,"I think the way he is with Harry might actually be Nick's real self. Remember, he said that he thought BB had sent Harry in there specifically for him. He likes dominant women, likes having his hair pulled and washed. And I say, more power to him."
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,2,Mon Jun 22 04:18:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe, I just mean seeing more of him in general, doing something other than cuddling. I feel like we're not seeing the Nick I like because he's not shown doing anything else"
bbuk,3amtbn,bellecasey,2,Mon Jun 22 05:14:21 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I like seeing more of him, too, but I don't mind seeing his interactions with Harry. Actually, I think we kinda have been seeing him apart from Harry more in the last week or so."
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,5,Mon Jun 22 06:01:34 2015 UTC,"Marc is such a whiny cunt and I'm sick of him. He's had complete power over this house ever since he got in, he's never been eligible to go home and he's been productions pet, but this is the first week where things aren't going exactly like he wants them too and he's throwing a bitch fit."
bbuk,3amtbn,JonathanSloanAUS,5,Mon Jun 22 06:02:25 2015 UTC,The producers are trying to stir the pot to bring up ratings but they are allowing mark to kill the show.   Its becoming too contrived. And Helen and Mark keeping talking about right and wrong and the truth but only from their perspective. Helen brings out the worst in everyone she is around. It horrible to watch.
bbuk,3amtbn,your-beast-of-burden,4,Sun Jun 21 22:24:57 2015 UTC,Has Harry picked Nick's nose for him yet?
bbuk,3amtbn,originalnutta,7,Mon Jun 22 04:09:37 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else think that BB was unfair to Harry when she nominated? I don't remember any other nominations where drama has been forced so much. I don't see why having completely differing personalities and that they probably wouldn't keep in touch in any other scenario is not a personal and valid reason for nominating.   Those producers are desperate to squeeze out any amount of drama. Showbiz might cry, Marc might see this as an attack on his ""friends"" and vicariously him, Harry might get upset and lie in bed all day with Nick.   I'm really disillusioned with this series."
bbuk,3amtbn,Limonene,6,Sun Jun 21 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"I was just glad they allowed her to point out that Marc is the person who she'd nominate for very valid reasons, if only he wasn't inexplicably immune. It reiterated how unfair that is, and it really can't be said enough, IMO."
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,6,Mon Jun 22 00:11:21 2015 UTC,"Yep! And not everyone was even eligible to be nominated. I don't get why Marc gets immunity from nomination and also the ability to try to sway others in their nominations.. and then he and Helen both sulk when they don't get their way? It's so rich. Showbiz was the cop out option, and Harry said that herself. I don't see the point in creating and fabricating vindictive reasons just for the sake of nomination, and twisting the knife, and pleasing the producers. Big Brother is manipulating the whole situation, as per usual."
bbuk,3amtbn,ellelelle,4,Sun Jun 21 22:06:17 2015 UTC,"I'm getting really, really pissed off at the ""that is not a valid reason"" - if it's a reason, it's a reason. Sometimes you can tell people are genuinely like ""there is no more I can say without making stuff up"" which is just milking drama instead of what they describe as ""honest reasons"""
bbuk,3amtbn,bellecasey,8,Mon Jun 22 04:24:13 2015 UTC,Its come to a point now where Big Brother is making up the nomination rules as they go.
bbuk,3amtbn,Louniness,3,Sun Jun 21 20:51:11 2015 UTC,"They clearly are. They are putting up who they want to put up, getting rid of who they want to get rid of, and keeping who they want to keep. At this stage i think it would be easier for them to just rig the voting. It would look less contrived."
bbuk,3amtbn,ellelelle,2,Sun Jun 21 22:07:07 2015 UTC,"Who says they don't rig the votes? Anyone who votes, agrees to their terms, including:   You may vote by any of the above methods as many times as you like but the eligibility of any vote is at the sole discretion of Channel 5.   They can cancel out votes if they want.  They could also freeze the lines just as their preferred evictee/winner is in the lead. (Bye, Jade. / Congrats, Helen.) So they'd really only have to manipulate nominations to get a close enough race between them. Maybe that's why Marc has to be immune, because he'd get an overwhelming majority of votes to evict."
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,2,Sun Jun 21 22:29:32 2015 UTC,"They're very closely policed by an outside, not for profit organization though who monitor and verify the whole process"
bbuk,3amtbn,bellecasey,3,Mon Jun 22 04:26:19 2015 UTC,"But it says right in the terms that they don't have to use all the votes. Voters agree to those terms. That policing organization only has to verify that C5 is fulfilling their part of the deal as explained in the terms, so nobody is technically being deceived.  And what other reason could there be for doing vote freezes, aside from fixing the result in a tight race? They don't give any reason for doing it in their terms, just says they can do it whenever they want.  I'm so bored, I did some googling and found this article on BBSpy. After BB12, ""Presenter Emma Willis also revealed that Luke S was consistently bottom of the vote for the eighth eviction. However, a decision to feature voting freezes in the live show prompted a last minute surge of votes for him once Ashleigh was saved, resulting in Caroline leaving the house."""
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,3,Mon Jun 22 04:40:20 2015 UTC,"Vote freezes are just to milk more votes out of people by showing that their fave might be about to leave, I thought that was obvious. Sometimes Emma literally says it"
bbuk,3amtbn,bellecasey,2,Mon Jun 22 05:15:08 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, I see what you're saying there. But just because there's an obvious reason, doesn't mean there isn't any other less obvious reason.  And there's still the line in their terms about being able to determine the eligibility of votes at their sole discretion. Is there an obvious (to everyone but me right now, LOL) reason for that? Because that technically means that, after Electoral Reform Services has verified the number of votes received, C5 could then decide some of those votes are ineligible. It'd be interesting to hear a description of ERS monitoring process. Should I e-mail them? I'm too curious not to now.  :D  Hijinks!"
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,3,Mon Jun 22 05:48:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, so ERS responded:   As we are a commercial organisation we would be unable to provide these details regarding our work with Big Brother, as it is our policy not to release commercially sensitive information into the public domain.   So the supposedly impartial group that monitors the votes, and calls itself a ""commercial organisation"" rather than a non-profit, is not willing to say exactly how they do their job because it's ""commercially sensitive"". How are they impartial if they are protecting a product and in it for profit?  Is there something going on that would harm the show's reputation if the public knew about it? If it's a fair process and everything is legit, why hide it? Dun dun DUNNN! :P"
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,2,Mon Jun 22 19:02:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, why the need to temporarily block votes in order to announce the percentages at the time and motivate voters? Wouldn't they make even more money if they did that without freezing the lines?  For example, if I were collecting paper votes for a poll, I could grab the ballot box, quickly count those votes and announce the totals at that time, while having left out another box for people to keep adding more ballots. That way I could maximize the number of votes received over the entire voting period. I wonder if C5's vote counting software is more advanced than a dude with a couple of boxes, though."
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,2,Mon Jun 22 13:10:27 2015 UTC,Would he though. I think he was sent in to appeal to the audience on some level and give the public what the producers think we want. I think he will win.
bbuk,3amtbn,ellelelle,3,Mon Jun 22 09:11:37 2015 UTC,"Well, we'll probably never know for sure if Marc could survive a vote on his own. :/  But he's such an extreme character that I think he'd either be way in the lead or way behind in a vote. So if BB wants a tight race they can fix by closing/freezing lines at their discretion, or by disqualifying inconspicuous amounts of votes, they'd need to keep someone like Marc out of it."
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,7,Mon Jun 22 13:43:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they did the exact same thing to Simon back  when he nominated Jack by demanding he give more of a reason than not having much of a connection with Jack, when there was no issue when half the house nominated adjoa in the first week because they didnt have much of a connection with her. Im not even much of a fan of Simon or Harry but BB definitely stirred the pot each time."
bbuk,3amtbn,bobb77777,8,Sun Jun 21 20:54:34 2015 UTC,"They should have done it with Cristian.   ""We're sorry Cristian, you need to give an actual reason for your nomination, because nothing when you're trying to sound deep makes any sense."""

Completely with you that if this continues in the way it is that I will give up shortly. The fact I have to endure another week of fucking Helen and the past-HMs is enough as it is!

bbuk,3amtbn,ellelelle,7,Mon Jun 22 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"Ever notice when Marc gets in an argument or something annoys him, straight to the dairy room to get more of his views across. He must know that a lot of diary room visits will be on TV. Hes lost in arguments alot recently, then runs to the diary room to try salvage his argument. I know he's not the only one to do his, but he does it the most"
bbuk,3amtbn,Smoking_Fish,5,Sun Jun 21 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"In the previous episode, they actually showed Brian talking to Nikki about how Marc spins and spouts propaganda to reframe events in his favor. The edit cut immediately to Marc in the DR doing exactly that."
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,4,Sun Jun 21 22:07:13 2015 UTC,"It's when he gets to put his spin on the whole thing, and it's smart because people will get to see what happened, and then get his point of view twice. And he knows (or should guess) that the producers are giving him disproportionate airtime so obviously he would milk it. That's the smart thing to do."

bbuk,3amtbn,Tomla,6,Mon Jun 22 00:36:33 2015 UTC,This episode is such a joke. Now Marc trying to influence Simon. And thank god the housemates themselves are at least trying to resist it. I'm really pissed that Big Brother doesn't care to call out Marc or Helen for trying to influence nominations. What they did with Sam was ridiculous. And now Marc gets to put a target on Sam's back for not going along with his vendetta against a supposed clique? It's farcical.
bbuk,3amtbn,ellelelle,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:11:04 2015 UTC,"""Housemates"" may not be allowed to discuss noms, but Marc is a ""time warper"" or some bullshit now, so he's not bound by that rule. :P"
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,4,Sun Jun 21 22:54:28 2015 UTC,Did they say that? What's the point in making that rule in the first place if they are going to change it as it suits them. Marc is a real housemate insofar as he is eligible to win. He should therefore be bound by the same rules and not get special treatment. Big Brother didn't tell housemates that it was ok to discuss nominations as far as I could tell.
bbuk,3amtbn,ellelelle,4,Mon Jun 22 09:10:14 2015 UTC,"No, I was joking about the noms rule, but I wouldn't put it past them. That was their flimsy reasoning for his immunity this week, that he's now the same as Helen, Nikki, and Marc somehow.  I agree with what you're saying about having the same rules for all housemates. But BB gives no fucks, apparently, or thinks their viewers have no critical thinking skills. Probably both."
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,2,Mon Jun 22 13:51:24 2015 UTC,"Good episode. Got to understand some people better: Danny, Sam, and Harry. I could even bear to listen to Marc and Helen. Still don't like them, but I can endure them when they're just part of the ensemble like everyone else.  And Nikki in the suitcase was a good laugh, too. BB wasn't having any of that, though, were they? Did they think she'd plot a rebellion against production from inside there? :P  And also-also, everyone humoring Joel about how he wants to ""get to know"" Nikki. I don't know whether to cringe or chuckle. But it's true, it does get better, so Joel will be okay in the end."
bbuk,3amtbn,Jotchee,2,Sun Jun 21 23:44:47 2015 UTC,I think they were just terrified at the prospect of being responsible for her suffocating and costing the world our only Nikki Grahame :3
bbuk,3akxvs,iamthemusic09,3,Sun Jun 21 05:25:46 2015 UTC,I need a set of Nikki reaction memes. Her face when Helen and Marc got into bed together in the bunker was priceless.

bbuk,3ak09y,Jotchee,15,Sun Jun 21 16:59:19 2015 UTC,"I could not agree more. I personally believe Marc is a smart man who has no qualms with playing the reality tv super villain and in that regard, him and Helen probably have the same agent. I can understand the producers being eager to create drama to increase ratings, but this is so transparent I believe it could have the opposite effect. Marc is not a real housemate. If he was he would be subject to the same rules. He gets to discuss nominations, manipulate others into nomination, and gets a free ticket every week bringing him closer to the final, where I presume he will be rewarded for all his hard work. The rest of the house have every right to resent him at this point. He's had every advantage and has actually put a lot of them at a disadvantage. They are all lucky to have this experience, but Marc is a plant, and with all that information, watching him lord it in the house would get to me too. I'm not surprised Danny flipped at him and Helen. The ""original"" housemates must be wondering what their purpose is in the house. I guess just moving targets for Marc to create controversy. The voting thing is a farce, but the four in, four out kinda showed that. There is no point getting invested in a housemates journey when production treats the majority of them as disposable fodder and clearly pick their champions/antiheroes."
bbuk,3ak09y,ellelelle,14,Sun Jun 21 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"I have been shocked at how much nomination convo has been happening. It's really absurd and I thought against the rules of the show. Jade and Nick were punished for doing it week one and it was a huge deal. Now Marc is calling out voting circles, explaining who and why he votes for people, and almost every vote except one so far I think has been a public vote. It's boring."
bbuk,3ak09y,Smoking_Fish,2,Sun Jun 21 02:16:13 2015 UTC,I started watching this series late (halfway through week 2 I think)and I just assumed that it was OK to talk about nomination. I remember old series you couldn't even make the slightest hint about nomination or you would get in trouble. Even talking about the nominations in general could have gotten you in trouble
bbuk,3ak09y,ellelelle,2,Sun Jun 21 21:01:46 2015 UTC,Different rules for different people I guess. If this isn't brought up by big brother or at least on BBOTS I will be disgusted.
bbuk,3ak09y,SmashingRectums,10,Sun Jun 21 07:14:56 2015 UTC,"His talk about ""clicks forming in the house"", when there appear to be none   I'm not sure if we're watching the same show but there definitely are cliques. Are you refusing to notice the fact that Jack/Chloe/Cristian/Danny passive-aggressively pick on people week after week and then accuse others of bullying?  I'm not saying Marc is some saint by any means but at least he's making things interesting."
bbuk,3ak09y,ellelelle,4,Sun Jun 21 03:22:24 2015 UTC,"Are you refusing to notice the fact that Jack/Chloe/Cristian/Danny passive-aggressively pick on people week after week and then accuse others of bullying?     What are you referring to here? I don't think they pick on people. I think there was a lot of behind backs resentment and bitching, but that was mostly the Jack and Danny misery club... I don't see cliques in the way Marc describes. If anything, the house got on too well before the newbies arrived. That was clearly a concern for producers."
bbuk,3ak09y,AcePlague,2,Sun Jun 21 07:18:16 2015 UTC,"They definitely do pick on people. They choose someone to bitch about and they go on and on, turning reasonable discussions into arguments simply because it comes from that person."
bbuk,3ak09y,Jotchee,2,Sun Jun 21 15:04:39 2015 UTC,"I don't care if there are alliances or not because it's a numbers game, but I don't really see what you're describing. There's a narrative I keep hearing about smaller cliques like you're saying, but it seems to me that it's actually all the originals bonded against the noobs and repeats."
bbuk,3ak09y,henry82,-1,Sun Jun 21 03:39:37 2015 UTC,"(For some reason, I can't even explain why he gets this   because the show would be shit otherwise. The week before helen and co arrived (and mark was bring 'normal') was absolute boring shite."
bbuk,3ak09y,WezVC,-2,Sun Jun 21 00:24:48 2015 UTC,You got downvoted but it's so true. Everybody else is way too passive and scared of conflict. I'm not saying it should be non-stop arguing but people would rather stay quiet than stand up for themselves or others.
bbuk,3ak09y,Jotchee,6,Sun Jun 21 14:43:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that the others aren't performing all the time, like Marc does.  They were getting into conflicts before Marc, and they were actually legitimate personality clashes and disagreements. It was just getting interesting between Joel and Sarah, for example, not because they are both attention starved clowns looking for arguments like Marc, but because they really were at odds based on their personalities and the events in the house. It was more real, and more interesting than Marc acting out like a spoiled brat and everyone being annoyed by him all day every day.  The drama Marc generates is boring, IMO, because it's shallow and repetitive. They could have sent in a monkey with a water hose and it would have also caused drama in every episode. And from the way this series is going, Hose Monkey would be your new ""champion"" in the end."
bbuk,3ak09y,lukaeber,0,Sun Jun 21 17:08:00 2015 UTC,Speak for yourself ... I don't want him to go.
bbuk,3ak09y,branhoo88,-3,Mon Jun 22 18:46:11 2015 UTC,Im fine with it because he deserves to win over the other boring people
bbuk,3ak09y,Jotchee,8,Sun Jun 21 06:15:51 2015 UTC,"Win what? Is he participating in the game? Because he seems more like the boss's kid who gets handed the promotion at work, because the boss knows the kid can't earn it on his own."
bbuk,3ak09y,branhoo88,-2,Sun Jun 21 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"Because hes the only entertaining person in the house, without him the series would get shittier ratings than they already do"
bbuk,3ak09y,Jotchee,4,Sun Jun 21 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree that the ratings would drop without Marc, obviously. But even if that's the case, then they should've done a better job in casting, rather than relying on Marc as a plant for the entire series. Hell, they could have even cast a house full of Marc types (works well enough for The Bad Girls Club) and let them actually play the game on their own. People like him are not rare."
bbuk,3ak09y,wigsnatcher,-8,Sun Jun 21 22:15:05 2015 UTC,"Where the fuck did all the whiny babies on this sub come from?  Glad you people aren't the voting public, otherwise the show would be boring as shit.  Not that it would matter if you were because you still wouldn't be able to get rid of Marc.  :)  Oh and GET HARRY OUT!"
bbuk,3ak09y,Jotchee,12,Sun Jun 21 15:32:11 2015 UTC,"Quit whining about people having different opinions.  And we know Marc isn't a real housemate and cannot lose. That's why it's impossible to root for him, IMO."
bbuk,3ak09y,wigsnatcher,-9,Sun Jun 21 16:56:01 2015 UTC,Any narrative on this sub that doesn't cast Harry as a victim and Marc as a villain is immediately downvoted.  I'm pretty sure that I'm not the one butthurt about other people's opinions.

bbuk,3ajo58,ellelelle,5,Sat Jun 20 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"If he legitimately had a lawyer, he wouldn't have commented on twitter about it. I wouldn't be suprised if BB gave him the heads up and hes employed to play it up."
bbuk,3ajo58,henry82,-3,Sun Jun 21 00:26:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's just trying to seem cool. He actually violated whatever agreement/contract he had with BB by running around trying to influence the housemates, so he doesn't have a leg to stand on and I wouldn't be surprised if they broadcasted Helen saying all that (which they shouldn't have and usually wouldn't) just to spite him"
bbuk,3ajo58,bellecasey,2,Sun Jun 21 01:45:11 2015 UTC,That's really not how the law works
bbuk,3ajo58,ptar86,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:25:58 2015 UTC,"I wasn't talking about ""the law"". To appear on big brother like that you have to sign several release forms and such, which included conditions he broke, rylan mentioned that on BOTS. It's not like they're going to pursue damages, that would just be thrown out, but my point was the producers must be pissed, the same way they are when new housemates give outside world info"
bbuk,3ajo58,bellecasey,2,Mon Jun 22 21:56:24 2015 UTC,"Yes but he can still sue for defamation: I don't see how he ""doesn't have a leg to stand on"""
bbuk,3ajo58,ptar86,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:58:08 2015 UTC,"Because Helen isn't necessarily to blame - she did verbally accuse him of drug use, however the distribution and broadcast of this was done by BB. So at the very least they'd both be the defendants in the suit - Helen could easily, reasonably pass the blame on to BB, particularly because there have been occurrences of this before and BB chose to deal with it privately instead of broadcasting it and causing the defamation, so in this case actively chose to spread the derogatory information. Speaking to a person one on one is not defamation, the distribution of that information is, so though Helen was aware of being filmed she still has a strong case. And the producers could then counter with Victor's violation of his contract being the cause of Helen's actions to begin with, ""provocation"" so to speak, and/or threaten damages due to his negatively affecting the season and violating their agreement in the process. Also Helen saying that about him was in response to him defaming her, which wasn't broadcast but she references several times.  I'm not saying it's right or how it should be, but civil suits like these get so convoluted and nasty with counter arguments and countersuit threats they're usually just thrown out or mutually settled, especially with a giant like Channel 5"
bbuk,3ajo58,bellecasey,3,Mon Jun 22 22:07:46 2015 UTC,"When she was in the DR afterwards and said she didn't actually know him personally I figured she realized she screwed up. That level of self-awareness usually escapes her, heh."
bbuk,3ajo58,Tomla,2,Sat Jun 20 22:15:02 2015 UTC,"They're complete fucking idiots for including it in the highlights show, it's totally on them. Helen shouldn't have said it, but when housemates do things like that they get a private diary room warning from big brother and it isn't included in the show, because DUH.  They really fucked up on this one. They still could have aired the rest of the argument, that was just a small nugget of it"
bbuk,3ajo58,bellecasey,2,Sun Jun 21 01:42:56 2015 UTC,"i did not watch yesterday episode, what did Helen say?"
bbuk,3ajo58,ed2rummy,4,Sun Jun 21 02:29:29 2015 UTC,She called Victor a coke-head
bbuk,3ajr1p,heartswellss,5,Sat Jun 20 21:46:03 2015 UTC,"Jade made a comment about how ""normal"" people do not deserve the Big Brother experience. I liked how Emma called her out and said Big Brother is for everyone and anyone. I don't remember her exact wording, but it was very well-put."
bbuk,3ajr1p,TheFreshPrince12,0,Sat Jun 20 22:51:44 2015 UTC,I literally just commented the same thing before I read this. I liked that too.
bbuk,3ajr1p,ellelelle,2,Sun Jun 21 07:22:27 2015 UTC,"I liked when Emma shut down the ""deserving"" talk from Jade straight away. She was not having it."
bbuk,3ajr1p,ellelelle,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:21:52 2015 UTC,"I have a few rambling thoughts having watched along with my housemate.   If you watch the interview with Jade after her eviction she mentions she knows Marc from Tallafornia, some Irish version of the Jersey Shore format he previously starred in. They're not really normal people anymore.   I watch a bit of Love Island (ITV2 reality TV currently airing) in passing (housemate likes it) and a lot of their chatter is about, ""This is your job, you do this for a living."" What that means really is there's a class of people who's aim it is to get on television by any means necessary.   We're in the age of stuff like Made in Essex and The Only Way is TOWIE. They're hired actors portraying some weird form of reality. The interesting part to me, having watched some Big Brothers before (notably series 1 and spatters of the rest), is seeing the two styles clash. I came in around week 3 and have watched every night since and I still see people pop up who I didn't really realise were there (Joel?). I suppose these are the normal people who are stuck in the middle.  This definitely leads to entitlement from people who have these goals. It's odd to see reality TV collapse in on itself in this way.   Every episode since the release of the previous housemates and Marc has been a bunch of arguments I can't really follow, but boy do people get angry. The idle chatter you'd see in series past hasn't really been present for some time. Marc, while a character, strikes me as a dumb version of Will Kirby from one of the Big Brother US series (there's an hour long video on YouTube regarding him that's fairly entertaining, an excellent character) they brought in, but instead of being a calculated player is boisterous without goals and has clear protection from the production staff."
bbuk,3ajr1p,Handypandy1,2,Sun Jun 21 05:14:05 2015 UTC,"I think you touch on one of the most interesting parts of reality tv: how the reality of being watched actually changes behaviour. In psychology, it's called the Hawthorne effect. When we watch reality tv now, the participants are generally wise to the objective of the show, and go in with their own agenda. I think the beauty of early Big Brother was that people weren't sophisticated enough to know how to react to the house as a social experiment. Obviously it would enver have been a perfect reflection of reality, but it was more about the contestants. Nowadays, a lot of reality tv actually says more about the viewers: what producers, and contestants, think we want to see. Big Brother now is a great example of that.. and it is destroying the franchise from the inside out because people won't tune in if they don't feel there is something authentic or meaningful going on, and contestants and producers know they won't tune in if they don't create some exaggerated version of reality that entertains. As an aside, I also miss the idle chatter. We don't really get any character development or light hearted talk. It's all nastiness or upset that is prioritised when they do the final edits."
bbuk,3ajr1p,ellelelle,2,Sun Jun 21 07:28:13 2015 UTC,"I remember how the first Big Brother was marketed as a social experiment. I don't watch enough channel 5 to know how they advertise it now but I bet it's a far cry.   It'd be nice to see people blossom as friends, but again I'm probably not the target audience."
bbuk,3ajr1p,Handypandy1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:23:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think I am either, but they are probably right not to pander to me. I won't vote to pay and I am probably too cynical about what is genuine and what is manufactured."

bbuk,3ajhwr,TheFreshPrince12,11,Sat Jun 20 20:19:09 2015 UTC,"Cristian is so enlightened by his own intelligence. He's basically like ""WAKE UP SHEEPLE!"" Why does he need to patronize everybody?  Also, I'm starting to not like Chloe. A lot of the major fights revolve around someone doing something to her and her crying. Then people get into shouting matches about it while she sits there like a meek puppet without standing up for herself/explaining anything. It was cringey to watch her sit there silently while Marc and Danny fought about her."

bbuk,3ajhwr,ellelelle,4,Sat Jun 20 22:00:22 2015 UTC,The producers are probably too busy worshipping him to realise he is subject to the same rules.. or is he.
bbuk,3ajhwr,ellelelle,9,Sat Jun 20 22:09:31 2015 UTC,Also: he wasn't just hinting at it to Sam.. he was actually trying to bully her into it. She told him she was supposed to nominate for HER reasons and neither he nor Helen were having any of it. How transparent is he? Such a manipulator.
bbuk,3ajhwr,Tomla,11,Sat Jun 20 22:40:05 2015 UTC,"It was ridic! When Sam said that those were Marc's reasons and not hers and that she didn't want to be in the middle of their stuff, Helen was like 'What are you going to do then? Pick someone randomly for no reason?' as if it's either Marc/Helen's way or else it's just random nonsense. I am very surprised they allowed that whole conversation into the show."
bbuk,3ajhwr,ellelelle,2,Sun Jun 21 03:06:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's the only thing Sam has done since she arrived into the house that I have been able to respect. Helen portraying it as Sam ""being picked on"" actually turned my stomach a little too. Surely Sam doesn't want to be some weak, hapless victim going from ""clique"" to ""clique"". Marc and Helen want that divide in the house to drive the narrative. Sam and Simon as newbie victims works great for them too. Ultimately, I guess Sam is a complication because she is a fence sitter, but at least she didn't let herself be pushed off it."

bbuk,3ajhwr,ellelelle,9,Sun Jun 21 01:25:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's because of how duplicitous Marc comes across.

bbuk,3ajhwr,cheesehead99,2,Sat Jun 20 21:58:26 2015 UTC,Just watched it and when Jade was talking about herself and there is like 2 of her she just sounded mental. and just constant arguments is just like the last Celeb Big Brother with Perez. not as annoying but just arguments every day is boring.
bbuk,3ajhwr,lurkjoy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"Danny must be such a likeable lad. You can see how much Marc and Helen hurt whenever Danny kicks off at them. He is probably the only one, not on their side, that they both respect."
bbuk,3ajhwr,Smoking_Fish,5,Sun Jun 21 14:36:59 2015 UTC,Agree
bbuk,3ajhwr,lestu4get,-1,Sat Jun 20 23:16:54 2015 UTC,Anyone else slightly over Brian's blow ups? He's making himself look stupid at this point.
bbuk,3ajhwr,Jotchee,2,Sun Jun 21 08:38:49 2015 UTC,I was over all the recycled housemates before they even got there.

bbuk,3aj0ar,sadmep,2,Sat Jun 20 17:39:56 2015 UTC,I don't want to read into too much but at the end of this video it looks like Christian gives Joel a little grab. Just sayin'   http://bigbrother.channel5.com/day-62-joel-and-cristian-make-sweet-pillow-talk
bbuk,3aj0ar,BeckyOMFG,3,Fri Jul 17 02:42:43 2015 UTC,If that were the case it would be a very homoerotic household as Danny was holding Jack's hand last week. I don't think its sexual tension
bbuk,3aj0ar,chrissiecott,5,Sat Jun 20 18:27:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't notice that, but I couldn't see it. I thought Joel and Aaron had chemistry, maybe, until Aaron actually started harassing him. I think there are just a lot of ""modern"" men in the house that don't mind showing their feelings or being affectionate and I think that's a good thing. Danny, Nick, Joel, Jack are all fairly relaxed about this stuff. I would've said Christian less so, but maybe I got him wrong. I think he would lose it if he saw this post."
bbuk,3aj0ar,ellelelle,2,Sat Jun 20 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"Hahaha love this!  I bet Cristian is just using him for airtime, the swine."
bbuk,3aj0ar,bellecasey,0,Sun Jun 21 01:47:36 2015 UTC,"I think you're looking into it a bit too much. When I get all touchy-feely with another dude, it's because I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, and they often are as well. As /u/ellelelle said, it's probably a ""modern men"" thing. I like seeing that kinda thing, as opposed to guys getting all awkward about it."
bbuk,3aicej,bobb77777,6,Sat Jun 20 13:43:00 2015 UTC,"Brian is one of the very few level headed people in the house right now. One of the few people with a good heart and who isn't a puppet looking for airtime, or atleast its how its coming off to me. You can say you don't like him and I'd be fine by it, but if you say you like a lot of other housemates this year and still don't like Brian, thats when I really start to question things."
bbuk,3aicej,CitizenJaggers,4,Sat Jun 20 23:24:35 2015 UTC,"Level headed? Surely youre joking, his temper is out of control. After Chloe was nominated he took his shoes off and threw them like a child having a tantrum rather than deal with things in a mature manner like an adult. After Jade was nominated he was shouting far more aggressively than Marc. Marcs a twat but Brian needs to control his temper and stop flying off at the handle constantly."
bbuk,3aicej,Tomla,5,Sun Jun 21 17:41:13 2015 UTC,"In my opinion there's a difference between going in to the show as a contestant and wanting to leave and Brian's situation. He's already done this. He has the experience. He won the game. He's a massive Big Brother fan and isn't there to try and stay relevant like Helen is. He's just there for the enjoyment of Big Brother and if he's no longer enjoying it then there isn't anything else in it for him. He's here now as the paid entertainment and found the over the top ridiculousness of the Helen/Marc duo not worth what he's getting paid, obviously."
bbuk,3aicej,jyunga,4,Sat Jun 20 16:06:28 2015 UTC,Brian's not in there to try and stay relevant? You haven't noticed how he's been part of BOTS nearly every season since he left the house a winner? He's TOTALLY trying to stay relevant in the Big Brother world.
bbuk,3aicej,Tomla,-1,Sat Jun 20 17:55:46 2015 UTC,He's trying to stay involved in the Big Brother world because he loves Big Brother more than anything. Helen is trying to stay famous because she loves being famous more than anything. Big difference.
bbuk,3aicej,tvwatcherguy,6,Sat Jun 20 18:00:05 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree with ya there!  He pissed me off last night when chloe got upset and ran into the bedroom and Brian says ""Marc thinks he's a big man making a girl cry""! That pissed me off so so much!  Trying to use pc to drag Marc trough the dirt the exact same way harry did! Also it happened minutes after Helen made Danny upset in a much more vindictive way!  And ofc he had nothing to say to Helen. I mean Chloes a strong person well able to handle herself! Her and Marc have had their ups and downs but they're well able to sort it out amongst themselves.  They are mates under it all I believe."
bbuk,3aicej,mixdkinkster83,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:08:09 2015 UTC,"I feel opposite. I think when Chole wanted to say her piece after getting nominated she couldn't say anything because Helen and Marc kept talking over her. She said she wanted to say something and all the roommates agreed to let her speak but as soon she started talking Helen and Marc interject. To me that was rude as hell and Brian just told them let her say her piece. But Helen couldn't be quiet for one damn min.  I don't think it was a ploy or him being manipulative at all.  Someone in another thread said that Nikki and Brian are used to old school Big Brother where you put people in a house and some get along and some dont. But back than, you didnt many people just being vicious assholes 24/7. Of course, there are a few bad apples but not 24/7 all day, every day.  It seems that Brian is one those people who just thinks everyone is a good person, I guess."
bbuk,3aicej,lukaeber,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:05:41 2015 UTC,"He cries to much.  Helen is a witch, but the way to deal with her is to simply ignore her.  It is impossible to win an argument with a person like that."
bbuk,3aicej,Xerxias,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:52:22 2015 UTC,"I hated Brian this season. He was such a dickhead whiteknight, I honestly don't understand how he is considered nice."
bbuk,3aicej,bellecasey,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:27:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I find him a self-righteous creep. And the manner in which he has attacked Helen a few times has honestly been just as aggressive and spiteful as he says she is"
bbuk,3aicej,originalnutta,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:39:59 2015 UTC,I had high hopes for him and expected to at least get a few laughs but hookung up with jade ruined all that and it pretty much turned into another harry and nick under the cover situation. Glad she got evicted.
bbuk,3aicej,WezVC,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:47:27 2015 UTC,"I think he made a big mistake going back in, and an even bigger mistake letting Jade make him look like an idiot.  Everybody in the house talks about hating bitching yet they do it all the time, and he is as guilty as anybody."
bbuk,3aicej,ellelelle,0,Sun Jun 21 14:47:37 2015 UTC,"Are you the only one who dislikes Brian? Yes. But seriously, I think Brian genuinely likes Nikki and respects her opinions whereas he sees Helen and Marc as causing conflict for conflicts sake.. and I think he is right as if there was a career to be made out of being a wanker.. those two would be professionals. I do think he is intimidated by them though, and that's why he gets upset when he tries to stand up to them. Interesting perspective though, I think Helen and Marc would agree with what you are saying. I just don't think Brian is that calculated, but maybe I am wrong!"

bbuk,3aftyl,Crystal-Abyss,3,Fri Jun 19 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"Personally, none.  I've usually made up my own mind on everyone already, and just see the audience reactions as a way to judge the public's opinions.  Of course, they're not always very telling of the voting audience, though."
bbuk,3aftyl,BertGlamGa,2,Fri Jun 19 20:25:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I just find myself curious as to how many people might even change their vote based on the audience's reaction, like a 'hive-mind' kinda thing, y'know"
bbuk,3aftyl,Jotchee,3,Fri Jun 19 21:11:29 2015 UTC,"Depends on the person, I suppose. Some people will hold stronger to an opinion if they think it's a popular opinion, some might question their opinion if they think it's unpopular. And then there are those who will be influenced to go against the crowd, too. But it definitely has effects. Same as how laugh tracks on sitcoms make them seem funnier to people."
bbuk,3aftyl,ellelelle,4,Fri Jun 19 20:34:23 2015 UTC,"Good point, oddly enough, I remember watching an edited Friends episode without a laugh track once, it was more awkward than my teenage years"

bbuk,3aetzp,Kigurumix,9,Fri Jun 19 21:09:28 2015 UTC,With only 24 hours to vote it is hard to come back from the confrontations in that house and jade was the last to be nominated and have to defend herself against all the attacks and accusations.
bbuk,3aetzp,spaceageclockwork,7,Fri Jun 19 21:13:05 2015 UTC,"""... the legends are going nowhere""?!"
bbuk,3aetzp,aubnonymous,10,Fri Jun 19 20:03:14 2015 UTC,Ah of course they aren't because Helen and because of Brian/Jade fauxmance. Ugh. What is even the point of this show anymore.
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,6,Fri Jun 19 20:10:56 2015 UTC,That fauxmance kind of backfired with evicting Jade.
bbuk,3aetzp,Jotchee,5,Sat Jun 20 07:27:59 2015 UTC,"The point of the show is morbid fascination. Next series will have the corpses of deceased housemates from the past, bouncing around on strings and spewing zombie vomit everywhere. Wait until you see the entertainment value those corpses bring to the show. It's really compelling stuff."
bbuk,3aetzp,SuperDramatic,13,Sat Jun 20 14:33:41 2015 UTC,"That's why I don't like vote to evict, we only get rid of the biggest personalities."
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,3,Fri Jun 19 21:10:45 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this and I'm guessing vote to evict probably does earn them more money.. people more likely to vote if they feel strongly about a contestant.. and dislike is stronger than like, especially with a lot of vanilla housemates in there."
bbuk,3aetzp,SmashingRectums,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:18:48 2015 UTC,People are going to dislike it whether it's vote to evict or vote to save. Vote to save got out strong characters like Sallie Axl </3

bbuk,3aetzp,spaceageclockwork,9,Fri Jun 19 21:08:15 2015 UTC,I was so sure it was going to be Harry.
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,-1,Fri Jun 19 21:08:49 2015 UTC,Me neither.. I thought Christian or Harry. I'm not a Jade fan but I was still shocked.
bbuk,3aetzp,chrissiecott,4,Sat Jun 20 07:15:13 2015 UTC,what do you all think the legends 'decision' will be tonight?
bbuk,3aetzp,CRB94,4,Fri Jun 19 20:05:19 2015 UTC,"I thought it was the evictee who has to make a decision, maybe put someone up for eviction?"
bbuk,3aetzp,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Fri Jun 19 20:19:21 2015 UTC,"I missed the beginning of the argument between Helen and Danny, who's Victor?"
bbuk,3aetzp,TheFreshPrince12,3,Fri Jun 19 20:42:15 2015 UTC,"BBUK5, one of the original fight night fighters. He came in yesterday and told Marc that Helen was a bad influence and the public didn't like the way Marc acted since the Time Warp."
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,4,Fri Jun 19 20:46:16 2015 UTC,"OH, right yeah that makes a lot more sense. I was seriously confused about how the conversation escalated so quickly."
bbuk,3aetzp,Tomla,7,Fri Jun 19 20:48:57 2015 UTC,"This is my personal belief.  Helen called Victor a cokehead and Danny freaked out because, contrary to Emma's disclaimer, Victor probably really does have a coke problem and that's why Danny took it so personal."
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,7,Sat Jun 20 04:00:53 2015 UTC,And Victor is a friend of Dannys.. so that could also reflect badly on Danny.
bbuk,3aetzp,chrissiecott,5,Sat Jun 20 07:19:42 2015 UTC,"Out of the 4 HMs up for eviction, Chloe, Harry, and Christian all butted heads with Marc since he came back in the house. Jade is the only one who didn't even say a bad word about him and even had her 'confession' recently about fancying him in the past.  Part of me hopes the eviction was because she was the friendliest with him out of the 4, heh."
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,6,Sat Jun 20 04:35:35 2015 UTC,I think that's optimistic. I think it was because people saw her as the fakest and the Brian Bello thing was the icing on the cake.
bbuk,3aetzp,jamielfc1994,12,Sat Jun 20 07:41:20 2015 UTC,"helen ""I don't get why this arseholes been allowed to come in and cause trouble"" er, helen, what are you in there for exactly?"
bbuk,3aetzp,Kigurumix,7,Fri Jun 19 21:00:39 2015 UTC,"She really talked a lot of crap tonight.. does she even listen to herself? Danny's reaction was way over the top, but he was right with what he was saying to her. She goes way too far. And then she can't handle being called out for it."
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,11,Sat Jun 20 07:22:22 2015 UTC,Shocker shocker Marc is also safe....
bbuk,3aetzp,Jotchee,13,Fri Jun 19 21:26:17 2015 UTC,This is just absurd!
bbuk,3aetzp,BeeBeeBuckley,7,Fri Jun 19 21:28:40 2015 UTC,Now that did piss me off.. If they are going to protect him by keeping him with the legends then he better leave with them.
bbuk,3aetzp,TheFreshPrince12,3,Sat Jun 20 07:20:01 2015 UTC,"That won't happen. The show is about winding up viewers, not satisfying them. They'll all be there acting like children for the rest of the series."
bbuk,3aetzp,BeeBeeBuckley,10,Sat Jun 20 14:13:00 2015 UTC,"So, he is immune TWO weeks in a row. That's a little much."
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,11,Fri Jun 19 21:28:43 2015 UTC,"Actually 4. Week 1 he couldn't be nominated because he was new. Week 2 doesn't count because the public knew it was a fake eviction. Week 3 he controlled nominations. And now week 4 he is considered a special ""timewarp"" housemate. That's ONE MONTH of protection.  Allegedly the timewarp housemates are staying in for 2 more weeks. Does this mean his immunity will carry on for that time as well? It seems he's getting the Helen Wood treatment by production."
bbuk,3aetzp,Jotchee,4,Sat Jun 20 03:53:07 2015 UTC,Holy Shit! Good catch.
bbuk,3aetzp,Jotchee,5,Sat Jun 20 03:56:26 2015 UTC,Yep. It's ridiculous. If he wins it will be a joke.
bbuk,3aetzp,mixdkinkster83,4,Sat Jun 20 07:20:58 2015 UTC,"It's already a joke. They already had a bullshit ""winner"" who never played the game last series, so it's not like this series could be any less legit."
bbuk,3aetzp,Kigurumix,6,Sat Jun 20 14:15:27 2015 UTC,"I guess he's another Helen, he'll never have to actually survive the game and will still be called the ""winner"" in the end."
bbuk,3aetzp,Jotchee,7,Fri Jun 19 21:45:07 2015 UTC,"He will probably get a pass to the final. And if he wins, they are going to say, ""Marc the public loves you so much that you won."" No,  yall gave him a pass to the final."
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,12,Sat Jun 20 00:23:31 2015 UTC,I think this season needs to be renamed the Marc show.
bbuk,3aetzp,BeeBeeBuckley,17,Fri Jun 19 21:30:00 2015 UTC,"I'm probably just going to clip this series onto the back of the folder that holds Helen's series, and file it back in the ""Shows I Regret Watching"" drawer in my mind-cabinet. :P"
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,2,Fri Jun 19 21:55:41 2015 UTC,It's getting a bit much.
bbuk,3aetzp,BeeBeeBuckley,11,Sat Jun 20 07:22:58 2015 UTC,"Helen yelling at everybody, calling people twats...five minutes later, ""we can have an amicable conversation, this isn't supposed to be an argument."" Wtf Helen?"
bbuk,3aetzp,Jotchee,8,Fri Jun 19 20:53:02 2015 UTC,"Funny because it seems like it's always an argument when you question her or challenge her behaviour. It's all amicable until she gets it back, I guess?!"
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,11,Sat Jun 20 07:40:36 2015 UTC,"Helen: Marc's not up anybody's arse. That's why I like him.  Okay, Helen, pull him out of your arse and tell him."
bbuk,3aetzp,Louniness,14,Fri Jun 19 20:30:14 2015 UTC,"He's actually up his own ass, and then up Helen's as well. It's worse than the human centipede, even."

bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,-3,Sat Jun 20 07:23:38 2015 UTC,"There's no way Marc is up Helens ass, or anyones for that matter, he does what the fuck he wants and clearly doesnt do things just to please people. I dont see how you can think this?"
bbuk,3aetzp,Jotchee,6,Fri Jun 19 20:46:38 2015 UTC,"He does what he thinks production wants him to do. I think it because I've seen it countless times on other shows. ""Marc"" is a reality TV trope, not some uniquely strong personality."
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,3,Fri Jun 19 21:14:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed.. and Marc knows what it means to be memorable in reality TV... People in your real life will know you played a character. Meanwhile, you are laughing all the way to the bank. Think of all the people you remember in the reality tv shows you've watched and I bet you the ""Baddies"" will stand out the most. He is a smart guy."
bbuk,3aetzp,Louniness,3,Sat Jun 20 07:25:09 2015 UTC,"I remember the clever, funny characters the most. (Britney Haynes from BBUS just popped into my mind, one of my faves.) Cartoon baddies like Marc aren't really novel, IMO. It's been done to death and beyond on reality shows, and I can see personalities like Marc's and Helen's at any junior high school."
bbuk,3aetzp,Jotchee,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"I remember baddies from the reality TV show I watch.. but I would make an exception for BB as when I watched it it used to have eccentric characters like Nikki, Pete Bennett, Brian, Jon Tickle.. They stood out to me because they were so set in their ways, it was disarming. I think Eileen was that kind of character but didn't get the chance to shine. Joel could potentially be put in that category but he is fading a bit lately."
bbuk,3aetzp,Louniness,0,Sat Jun 20 16:48:26 2015 UTC,That's got nothing to do with him being up anyones ass...
bbuk,3aetzp,Smokratez,5,Fri Jun 19 21:17:32 2015 UTC,"You said he does what he wants to do, and I said that I think he's doing what production wants him to do. So he's up production's ass, and Helen's by proxy. And then I just find him to be a self-absorbed clown who only pretends to give a fuck about others when it benefits him, hence the wisecrack about him being up his own ass.  Obviously, your mileage may vary."
bbuk,3aetzp,Louniness,-1,Fri Jun 19 21:36:43 2015 UTC,"Well I think that he's doing what he wants and that happens to coincide with what production wants, hence hes a good housemate in that sense."
bbuk,3aetzp,BeeBeeBuckley,-2,Sat Jun 20 08:44:33 2015 UTC,"Most people in the UK don't know how men or women act naturally. Everything they know is what they see on tv, meaning they get manipulated."

bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:44:30 2015 UTC,Marc is Helen's little lapdog. He's too blind to see it.
bbuk,3aetzp,Louniness,-2,Fri Jun 19 20:55:08 2015 UTC,What has he done to make you think this?
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,3,Fri Jun 19 21:10:07 2015 UTC,What hasn't he done? Did you not see him throwing himself at her feet when she arrived into the bunker? How many times did he tell her he loved her and general sycophantic behaviour. And of course he would admire her. She is cut from the same cloth as him. They both know how to play the game and aren't afraid to deliver what the producers want. Helen got rewarded for it and that's exactly what Marc wants. He idolises her.
bbuk,3aetzp,Bunny_ofDeath,0,Sat Jun 20 07:27:23 2015 UTC,Yes I did think that was a bit OTT but since then he's shown no signs of being up Helens ass. Its not like he's laughing at everything she's saying or they are constantly together. Marc is his own person and he doesnt follow anyone.
bbuk,3aetzp,CRB94,3,Sat Jun 20 08:51:42 2015 UTC,"He is his own person, but he is also playing a game and catering to what he thinks the producers and the public want to see, which is a delicate balance. Clearly Helen somehow managed to get to the finish line last year and he is up her hole because he basically wants to emulate her. Him and Helen are great for each others egos."

bbuk,3aetzp,Dietfuckingcoke,9,Sun Jun 21 01:01:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know, Cristian is boring as anything but it's vote to evict and I feel like Jade has given a lot more reasons to be evicted. If it was vote to save I'd be surprised coz I don't know who would vote to save Cristian. Jade thinks incredibly highly of herself with little reason to do so."
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,2,Fri Jun 19 21:09:00 2015 UTC,"Seriously, yes. That baby voice of hers made me want to strangle my ears every time she used it."
bbuk,3aetzp,Jotchee,3,Fri Jun 19 23:20:33 2015 UTC,"Saying that I find Cristian, Harry and Chloe incredibly boring and Jade does bring more to the house than they do."
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:59:09 2015 UTC,Jade really does love herself.. there is a difference between self love and narcissism and she is on the wrong end of that equation.
bbuk,3aetzp,rsuperq,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:42:30 2015 UTC,"I expect that by 2020, literally nobody will know the difference between confidence and arrogance."
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,-1,Sat Jun 20 07:17:30 2015 UTC,I think even when I was a teenager he would've bored me to tears.. and the fake accent.. and his patronising ways.
bbuk,3aetzp,WickedBagel,11,Sat Jun 20 14:17:42 2015 UTC,Can Cristian & Danny go back to being non-existent please?
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,5,Sat Jun 20 07:16:39 2015 UTC,"I've enjoyed Danny being more outspoken this week. I was actually team Danny until he had the freakout with the pizza boxes.. That was a bit over the top.  Christian though, he grates on me no matter what he does. Well, except when he calls Marc out."
bbuk,3aetzp,086bagofcats,5,Fri Jun 19 20:26:49 2015 UTC,"I like Jade, I don't think it was the right person to evict. harry was basically invisible this week. After hellen won last year, i knew this show was rigged, they probably rigged the voting too for this whole season."
bbuk,3aetzp,RideOrDieRemember,6,Sat Jun 20 07:43:13 2015 UTC,"Harry seeming invisible is because of the editing and all the crap with the legends taking over.. who aren't even eligible to win it. A lot of housemates are actually being robbed of airtime, unless they want to go into direct confrontation with the legends.. a la Danny and Christian. I guess it's been a great week for them. THe likes of Nick, Joel, Sam, Simon.. you think they've been more present than Harry? They've been more notably absent."
bbuk,3aetzp,bellecasey,8,Sat Jun 20 03:52:08 2015 UTC,Someone mentioned sam last night and I genuinely had to rack my brains wondering who Sam was
bbuk,3aetzp,CRB94,3,Sat Jun 20 07:29:02 2015 UTC,I'm not even sure who I like and dislike any more. Pretty sure I dislike Cristian. A lot of he said she said arguments happening recently.
bbuk,3aetzp,mixdkinkster83,6,Sat Jun 20 09:41:26 2015 UTC,Of course we'd lose the best girl in there in favor of the most boring. Sigh
bbuk,3aetzp,Kigurumix,4,Fri Jun 19 21:02:10 2015 UTC,Has anyone's else opinion changed on Brian ever since he has returned?
bbuk,3aetzp,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Sat Jun 20 01:23:53 2015 UTC,I like him more. Although colored-contacts are not my thing at all.
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,2,Fri Jun 19 21:29:11 2015 UTC,And all Marc cares about is the alcohol.
bbuk,3aetzp,aubnonymous,2,Sat Jun 20 00:05:56 2015 UTC,"Christian trolling Marc ala Evel Dick. I dunno...doesn't pack the same punch. Now Christian is apologizing to Jade for arguing last night? Ok, now back to arguing...with Joel. He's making me dizzy."
bbuk,3aetzp,Jotchee,2,Fri Jun 19 20:42:31 2015 UTC,He is literally all over the place. He doesn't know who he is angry with.
bbuk,3aetzp,sadmep,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:28:52 2015 UTC,I'm so glad BBUS is back next week it will peel me away from this farcical season of BBUK. It's like we are watching last year's show plus CBB all over again.
bbuk,3aetzp,BeeBeeBuckley,9,Sat Jun 20 10:39:21 2015 UTC,"It's crazy to me how BBUK seemed so much higher quality than BBUS when I first started watching. Now it's a complete joke, while at least BBUS and BBCAN are honest about the whole thing being a manipulation/deception competition. BBUK seems to completely lack integrity now, it's crazy.  They should just switch to the BBUS/BBCAN format if viewers want manufactured conflict all the time. At least then people like Marc and Helen would deserve to win because they were the most skilled at manipulation/intimidation/etc., rather than being protected by production because they couldn't survive the game in it's current format. At least then it would make sense."
bbuk,3aetzp,Jotchee,4,Fri Jun 19 21:32:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, watching the interaction between the traditional BBUK reality types and the analogs of the US/CAN has been pretty interesting to me.  What is telling though is everyone on the UK show right now is otherwise an entertainer, pretty much.  Chloe is maybe an exception, but Nick isn't.  He's admitted to watching every series of BBUK, he's admitted he's trolled previous housemates.  Nick is probably playing the best game."
bbuk,3aetzp,carrymeback1,2,Fri Jun 19 21:50:33 2015 UTC,It's so funny how the BB versions are mimicking each other to some degree this season. I can only imagine the Frankenstein bastard that BBAUS will be.
bbuk,3aetzp,mixdkinkster83,4,Sat Jun 20 17:47:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not too worried about BBAUS because that show seems to generally have a more fun, comedic tone, IMO. They don't seem to push the whole ""mean=funny"" schtick that BBUK does. Even if they decorate their house with gears and shit, and go overboard with producer manipulation, I still don't expect that we'll have to watch people screaming and crying in every episode while being told it's the only way the show can be entertaining.  The most recent BBCAN wasn't grotesque like BBUK, either. It just had lots of manipulation which now seems moderate compared to how Marc is protected every week on BBUK."
bbuk,3aetzp,ellelelle,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:08:36 2015 UTC,Thought that I read in a post somewhere that BBAU was possibly being canceled....??? I like that version better than BBUK so far.  This is the first season I have watched BBUK and while I was hooked for a while I am over the moon that we are being rescued next week!
bbuk,3aetzp,Smokratez,4,Sat Jun 20 14:05:22 2015 UTC,"I am not watching BBUS because of the racist shit they let housemates get away with on BB15. It was disgusting that they only ""punished"" one housemate for it when several  housemates were particpating in it. And on top of that  $5.99 to watch a livestream. Nah, I'm good.  For BBUK, I am enjoying  Bit on the Side more than the actual BB show. BBUK has the most entertaining housemates from past seasons and I love it."
bbuk,3aetzp,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Sat Jun 20 07:34:13 2015 UTC,I am the exact same with BBOTS. The main BB show has become the Marc show. And it's not as entertaining.
bbuk,3aetzp,chrissiecott,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:05:02 2015 UTC,"Julie Chen alone makes me not want to watch BBUS. I have never seen someone more robotic, and with more of a lack of personality."
bbuk,3aetzp,TheDmac,2,Sat Jun 20 10:38:48 2015 UTC,"Good job Danny. Oh shit, Christian just washed it all off. :/"
bbuk,3aetzp,Tomla,2,Sat Jun 20 09:10:14 2015 UTC,I think Simon is about to have a heart attack
bbuk,3aetzp,Jotchee,4,Fri Jun 19 20:13:25 2015 UTC,"Jeez, check out all the Marc hate! Marc is a great HM and is actually entertaining. Same can't be said for the other bores in there. Right now Marc and Joel are my favourites.  I also hated Helen last year but another week of Helen, Nikki and Brian will do the house good.  And I am really hating this fake Cristian... settle the fuck down and stop trying too hard. Hope he goes this week."
bbuk,3aetzp,Smokratez,5,Fri Jun 19 20:56:43 2015 UTC,"I don't mind asshole HMs but the one thing I can't abide is hypocrites and Marc (and Helen, for that matter) is a huge hypocrite and very fake.  Another week of the timewarp HMs may do the ratings good but it's not doing the house any good. It's short term gain for long term loss. What do you think is going to happen the moment they are gone? The HMs have been wound up to the breaking point. The moment they are gone everyone is going to just turn off, like when Marc was evicted to the bunker. That's what happens when you try to squeeze out a month's worth of drama in one week. You end up with one week of high drama and three weeks of emotionally exhausted and traumatized people."
bbuk,3aetzp,Smokratez,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:32:45 2015 UTC,"Marc is as entertaining as my spoiled 4-year-old nephew after Starbucks. Actually, less, because my nephew comes out with original shit I've never heard before sometimes, which can be amusing even when I'm just counting the hours until he goes back home.  Marc is a by-the-numbers reality TV troll who does nothing I haven't already seen many times. How he can be considered such an amazing breath of fresh air who saved the show, after like 20-something years of reality shows with characters just like him, I don't understand. He's redundant and it's tiresome."
bbuk,3aetzp,Smokratez,-3,Sat Jun 20 13:43:16 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who skips any scene with Emma. Ever since she acted sexist I can't stand her.
bbuk,3aetzp,Smokratez,4,Sat Jun 20 14:42:41 2015 UTC,When?
bbuk,3abncn,Kigurumix,10,Thu Jun 18 20:02:43 2015 UTC,Christian implying he was the hot topic of the week...
bbuk,3abncn,Louniness,12,Thu Jun 18 20:37:22 2015 UTC,"For some reason I nearly ( I don't cry Grrrr manly) felt more emotional when she went up to mark and said ""thanks for looking after my boy""."
bbuk,3abncn,Jimmymule,6,Thu Jun 18 20:09:55 2015 UTC,"I liked that Marc was totally baffled by that, like ""I did?"""
bbuk,3abncn,bellecasey,-1,Thu Jun 18 23:05:49 2015 UTC,"I totally didn't get that.. how did Marc ""look after"" Joel.. by not targeting him? That's like walking up to the playground bully and thanking him for not picking on your kid. I don't get that."
bbuk,3abncn,ellelelle,11,Thu Jun 18 22:29:20 2015 UTC,Joel is the only housemate that was honest about Marc in the bunker and didnt bitch behind his back. Joel's always been the most honest housemate so I think even Marc has to respect that.
bbuk,3abncn,bobb77777,3,Thu Jun 18 23:05:28 2015 UTC,"Yes but how did he ""look after"" him. Joel seems well capable of looking after himself. I don't get it."
bbuk,3abncn,ellelelle,6,Fri Jun 19 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"Notice that she couldn't really look directly at Marc's face. I got the impression that she doesn't necessarily like him, but sees that it's part of his gameplan to protect her son for now and wants to encourage more of that.  Also, notice Marc looking diabolical and pleased with himself as he walked away when the others were hugging Joel. Looks like someone has hitched his horse to the right likable housemate."
bbuk,3abncn,Jotchee,10,Fri Jun 19 01:40:50 2015 UTC,Interesting to see Mark in the diary room questioning his behavior in the house.
bbuk,3abncn,Jotchee,6,Thu Jun 18 20:34:55 2015 UTC,It's pretty obvious he's just changing his game because Victor said the viewers weren't liking him anymore. Must be nice to have producers send someone in to tip you off when you're doing badly like that.
bbuk,3abncn,ellelelle,6,Fri Jun 19 01:29:55 2015 UTC,"He is so much more likeable when he is humbled. I think Victor was right, and someone else here called it before.. he could've been the ""Journey"" character.. but I think he has blown it now."
bbuk,3abncn,gotbeff,2,Thu Jun 18 22:31:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think Marc is a bad person in the real world. He thought that being a dickhead was what the house needed and was the way for him to win/go far. Now he's starting to question that, and we saw the real Marc in the diary room in this ep. I want more of that Marc."
bbuk,3abncn,ellelelle,7,Fri Jun 19 12:51:53 2015 UTC,Surprising that there is only going to be one day to vote.
bbuk,3abncn,bellecasey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:41:18 2015 UTC,I was wondering that. If the first person got more votes because they were up longer.. but ok!
bbuk,3abncn,ellelelle,2,Thu Jun 18 22:31:27 2015 UTC,Were the lines open then? I thought they only opened when everyone was announced
bbuk,3abncn,Tomla,4,Thu Jun 18 23:12:19 2015 UTC,"They announced the lines open and gave numbers at the end of tonight's show, no numbers have been given before that."
bbuk,3abncn,ellelelle,2,Thu Jun 18 23:21:47 2015 UTC,i wasn't sure. i think it was not open .. because I don't recall them giving out voting details until last night. I was confused at first though.
bbuk,3abncn,henry82,7,Fri Jun 19 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"Only Nikki can go from a physically paralyzing emotional breakdown in one episode to ruthlessly cutting in the next, lol. Such a great character.  ""Thank you for being so... obliging."""
bbuk,3abncn,CRB94,11,Fri Jun 19 04:27:27 2015 UTC,Now that Cristian is up for eviction he is targeting Jade to make himself look better so he won't get evicted.  It's seems common when you are up to call out your fellow nominees on their faults.
bbuk,3abncn,Jotchee,3,Thu Jun 18 20:46:20 2015 UTC,"Totally.. I kind of see it as a bit karmic for Jade because she threw Harry under the bus when Harry was being treated like some sort of sexual predator gold digger but it's fairly obvious that the guys pick their targets because of threats/affronts to their own status in the house. That said, I think everything Jade does is calculated, right down to the polyamory, which she doesn't even know how to say right."
bbuk,3abncn,bellecasey,6,Thu Jun 18 22:28:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for making a thread!
bbuk,3abncn,CRB94,4,Thu Jun 18 20:22:38 2015 UTC,not a problem.
bbuk,3abncn,gotbeff,4,Thu Jun 18 20:23:52 2015 UTC,Marc's face when he got a kiss from Joel's mum
bbuk,3abncn,bellecasey,13,Thu Jun 18 22:22:19 2015 UTC,Did anyone else feel slightly offended that Cristian didn't know who Pete Bennett was?  Like show some respect
bbuk,3abncn,Winter_knights,5,Thu Jun 18 20:25:21 2015 UTC,"Not offended, but I did think he was foolish to give the ass-kissers ammo to use against him. If it's ""Past Housemates Are Better Than You"" week, then you best start pretending to worship those clowns. Gotsta stay on script, and all. :P"
bbuk,3abncn,spaceageclockwork,6,Fri Jun 19 01:35:55 2015 UTC,"He's too young, I suppose.  Ahh Pete and Nikki <3"
bbuk,3abncn,Jotchee,6,Thu Jun 18 23:11:11 2015 UTC,I'm the same age as him and I remember that series like yesterday!  He's just obviously not a fan of the show.
bbuk,3abncn,ellelelle,6,Thu Jun 18 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"As soon as I heard about a Pete and Nikki reunion I was excited, and I'm the same age as Christian. It's so nice to see that their breakup hasn't ruined the air between them!"
bbuk,3abncn,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Fri Jun 19 12:47:17 2015 UTC,"Me too, actually. If I was going on a show like this I would at least look into the history of it!"
bbuk,3abncn,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Fri Jun 19 00:03:48 2015 UTC,I was jumping for joy when I saw Pete love him so much. Hope he's turned his life around.
bbuk,3abncn,bellecasey,5,Fri Jun 19 07:09:04 2015 UTC,Holy shit. Marc is almost crying in the diary room.
bbuk,3abncn,ubergrind74,10,Thu Jun 18 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"This is the part where he reveals his heart of gold for all the suckers, and blames everything on Helen. She'll leave and take with her all the animosity Marc generated around himself. Two days later nobody will remember what a self-absorbed ass he was, and he'll go on to become the ""champion"" of the series, just as planned. Can't wait to see it all play out, so suspenseful. :P"
bbuk,3abncn,rsuperq,5,Fri Jun 19 01:20:57 2015 UTC,He needed that reality check. Victor went easy on him.
bbuk,3abncn,Smoking_Fish,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:31:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Marc should have taken Glyn's advice, too....lol."
bbuk,3abncn,Jotchee,6,Thu Jun 18 23:27:31 2015 UTC,"The party was well done! Seeing Glyn topped it off for me. His comment to Marc was perfect. I would've unfrozen and started dancing with them, feed me rations for a week!"
bbuk,3abncn,bobb77777,4,Thu Jun 18 23:02:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know why the housemates even bother trying with this task every series! I would 100% get up and party with Pete and Glyn or hug my mum, it would be worth a week of lentils. Plus whenever they're on rations they get better parties and food rewards anyway to compensate"
bbuk,3abncn,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Fri Jun 19 00:05:21 2015 UTC,Did anyone else notice Jade say she has someone on the outside when BB was quizzing her about Brian in the diary room?  She then turned around and told Brian she was single... can't stand her.  Hope she's out tonight :(
bbuk,3abncn,Bunny_ofDeath,12,Fri Jun 19 18:07:48 2015 UTC,I agree with Jade... Christian is a twat!
bbuk,3abncn,Jotchee,8,Thu Jun 18 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"Christian is slagged off for being on the fence and boring. Told to get of the fence and therefore get into arguments. Gets into arguments with jade, and looks bad. Feel bad for him. BB house seems to be the only place where getting involved in arguments is encouraged"
bbuk,3abncn,tvwatcherguy,7,Thu Jun 18 22:17:50 2015 UTC,"It's a real mind-fuck for the original HMs this series, isn't it? Be yourself! No, you're boring, do ""entertaining"" stuff you wouldn't normally do! Oh, now you've done too much, that's not like you! Stop being fake!  They literally can not win."
bbuk,3abncn,TheDmac,7,Fri Jun 19 01:17:09 2015 UTC,"Neither of them look good after the last couple of episodes. Christian's starting arguments to get airtime after being nominated while Jade is bedhopping once again for airtime. I lost a bit of respect for both of them, especially when Jade lied and said she hadnt kissed anyone in the house even though she had Brians tongue down her throat only 24 hours earlier. Plus the way she got defensive and called Christian a little boy and said she wasnt attracted to him even though she spent ages flirting with him was pathetic as well. I feel like Jade is kind of insecure, since she said earlier that she could have Christian anytime she wanted him even though its obvious hes not interested(I kind of think christian might be gay or asexual, he tried to change the subject of conversation when Joel asked him how many people he slept with.)"
bbuk,3abncn,bobb77777,4,Thu Jun 18 23:10:57 2015 UTC,"I noticed that Jade didn't go to her baby talk condescending voice...she almost did, but stopped. Helen obviously had a little chat with her."
bbuk,3abncn,TheFreshPrince12,2,Thu Jun 18 23:26:47 2015 UTC,"My God, you mean Helen did something I actually approve of? Next thing you know, the sun will rise in the west and pigs will fly."
bbuk,3abncn,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Sun Jun 21 01:05:06 2015 UTC,"This series does seem especially like a drawn-out episode of Punk'd, with the original housemates as the punks. Why didn't production just cast a full house of people like Marc & Helen in the first place, if that's what they want? The way they did it, it seems like they knew the new ringers and tenured goons could only be ""entertaining"" if they made sure we thought  the original housemates were ""boring"". It looks like they needed that false comparison to convince us Marc & Helen & Nikki are what we want to see, because our only other choice is supposedly boredom."
bbuk,3abncn,Winter_knights,7,Fri Jun 19 07:41:38 2015 UTC,I love Marc and Chloes back and forths!
bbuk,3abncn,Winter_knights,6,Fri Jun 19 14:06:30 2015 UTC,"I love them two. Clearly they're mates in the house but Marc always plays the tough mean guy persona, which is fine because deep down everyone knows hes a softie haha  Marc: ""I think you're a great person and I mean that ok""  Chloe: ""Thanks Marc it means a lot""  Marc: ""Just don't touch me ok?""  Chloe: ""Fucking asshole""  Their friendship is gold."
bbuk,3abncn,Winter_knights,4,Thu Jun 18 20:54:11 2015 UTC,"Good to see christian stand up for himself instead of being so passive. Also it's great that Jade was finally called out for her behavior. Nick got crap for switching from Jade to Harry and was called a bed hopper, but Jade flirts with Nick then switches over to Mark, then switches over to Christian and then switches over to Brian yet people are only copping on to it now.  I still wish Jack was up for eviction instead of Chloe, its a shame he did so well in his interview."
bbuk,3abncn,Winter_knights,3,Fri Jun 19 08:05:55 2015 UTC,"The farce continues as 20-something ex-housemates enter the house and tell all the contestants who is a gameplayer, who is liked, who is hated, etc. I despise this show anymore. It's a joke. What happened to ""cut off from the outside world""?"
bbuk,3abncn,Tomla,5,Thu Jun 18 22:53:37 2015 UTC,I have to agree. Giving strategic advice is against the premise of the goddam show!
bbuk,3abncn,TheDmac,2,Fri Jun 19 02:01:37 2015 UTC,Been rewatching bb2010 and saw Ben Duncan in the house today. Think he's hit the Botox a bit too much.

bbuk,3acsms,SmashingRectums,5,Fri Jun 19 01:40:52 2015 UTC,It gets asked every day but here again:  BB7 then BB8 and BB9.  BB9 IMO is the single greatest season overall factoring in everything.   But maybe BB7 is the good starter and marathon to and through BB9.
bbuk,3acsms,JuiceBusters,2,Fri Jun 19 17:51:15 2015 UTC,"I honestly preferred BB5 and BB6 to 7, 8 & 9."
bbuk,3acsms,SP0oONY,2,Fri Jun 19 19:52:02 2015 UTC,I preferred BB9 over BB7 but I agree BB5 and 6 are great.   I think I was trying to think of the OP and in my experience BB7-9 seems to be great starting points for someone wanting to choose one and get into the BBUK world.   (believe it or not I actually loved BB4 (boos?) and for me BB1 is just magic - however - I wouldn't recommend those as a new viewers 1st seasons to get into it).
bbuk,3acsms,JuiceBusters,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:57:04 2015 UTC,I really liked Big Brother UK 14! I think you should keep watching it.

bbuk,3acsms,bunnygoboom,2,Mon Jun 22 19:56:58 2015 UTC,Even though I've only seen one regular series start to finish I prefer the regular series just based on the fact that they all don't have massive egos. However I do really enjoy Celeb  I've heard BB7 is the best so I'll probably give that one a go
bbuk,3acsms,Winter_knights,2,Fri Jun 19 02:11:38 2015 UTC,BB7 is great. So much drama and craziness. You will either love Pete or hate him. But I loved him from the moment he fell into the house and I mean fell cause he falls down the stairs coming in.

bbuk,3ac2a5,CitizenJaggers,5,Thu Jun 18 21:54:02 2015 UTC,I thinks it's partly to do with channel 4 selling it to channel 5.  They sold it because it wasn't getting the ratings. I reckon ch 5 fabricate these ways to get the housemates at each others throats just purely for the ratings game.   I don't like it as much as the next fella but at the same time I'd rather have Big Brother on the air than not at all so I'm happy to take it as it comes.
bbuk,3ac2a5,deathbelle,4,Fri Jun 19 01:26:56 2015 UTC,"They have a real issue with casting, which isn't helped by the fact that with the reality show boom all the applicants are too self aware, too polished and too sharply fame hungry. Older series were often lightning in a bottle - great casting, genuine friendships, surprising relationships and dynamics. Now the producers AND housemates try to manufacture good television and it just comes across awful."
bbuk,3ac2a5,bellecasey,5,Thu Jun 18 23:02:27 2015 UTC,That's an excellent point you made about the housemates being as bad as production. I agree 100%
bbuk,3ac2a5,deathbelle,2,Fri Jun 19 01:29:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, someone on here just told me they prefer the regular series to CBB because they don't all have big egos, and I was like uhh haha lately they have even bigger ones and already consider themselves celebrities."
bbuk,3ac2a5,bellecasey,3,Fri Jun 19 02:18:31 2015 UTC,"Yup, and the message this series is sending to future housemates is basically, ""Don't be yourself, don't act candidly, don't even be a real person, that's boring. Be an entertaining character, an exaggeration of a person. Just force yourself to be whatever you need to be to bring in the ratings for us, or GTFO and be replaced.""  It's turning into nothing but bad improv acting."
bbuk,3ac2a5,Jotchee,2,Fri Jun 19 00:59:58 2015 UTC,"Producers are just more desperate than ever, and the show is a complete joke now. It's not targeting the same audience that watched when it was a quality show. Now they're just going for dimwits who never get tired of seeing people pretend to argue and shout at each other, and they're probably right to do that because those dimwits are the ones most likely to throw away their money on votes."
bbuk,3aarht,aubnonymous,16,Thu Jun 18 16:11:09 2015 UTC,"This season has been destroyed by the producers. I actually don't care what happens at all with the actual housemates. The four-in-four-out brought it down because it introduced us to Marc. The drama this season is just so so forced. Shouldn't the producers realize they've done too much when it's apparent Helen Wood, Brian Belo, Marc, and Harry are the stars of the show? It's tragic; because I remember when we were all pleased with the original cast and had high hopes for the series."
bbuk,3aarht,TheFreshPrince12,5,Thu Jun 18 16:48:40 2015 UTC,"I knew it was going to happen. Last year was bad enough with all the drama manipulation, but the housemates this year were so resistant to conflict that the producers had to crank up the interference to get the effect they wanted."
bbuk,3aarht,scratchmellotron,2,Thu Jun 18 17:48:01 2015 UTC,"I just wish they own up to their mistakes and just get on with it. It's a little painful to watch them try to patch up what's essentially a sinking ship.   If you think the original housemates are boring and find the BB veterans more entertaining, then play that up more! BB is trying hard not to admit this and it kind of bugs me."
bbuk,3aarht,MerroStep,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:09:21 2015 UTC,"I think the diary chair is a clue, it looks like the Game Of Thrones opening credits wheel, they're creating Westeros this year and the nice characters are being bumped off."
bbuk,3aarht,smashing3000,11,Thu Jun 18 20:21:24 2015 UTC,"The beauty of BB UK has always been normal people from different background and different ages trying to get along in a house. The drama came from nominations and small things like who doesnt clean. Now it's all so forced, it feel more like fear factor then Big Brother. Almost all other versions of BB are terrible because it's all about sex, drinking and humiliating tasks, now the UK version is turning to this as well."
bbuk,3aarht,Klaent,6,Thu Jun 18 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel.    I have been saying this all season and am so upset with all the interference and changes that have been made and it has become an abomination, almost worse than bbus."
bbuk,3aarht,Kigurumix,7,Thu Jun 18 22:05:40 2015 UTC,"They're stupid, they should have done another season of Ultimate Big Brother.  I can't wait for the catfight though."
bbuk,3aarht,SuperDramatic,6,Thu Jun 18 16:57:17 2015 UTC,"Three weeks is far too long. Oh lord, the original housemates got robbed."

bbuk,3aarht,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Thu Jun 18 18:59:41 2015 UTC,"This year started so well, I had second year vibes from it, then the whole mass eviction, new housemates thing happened and it's ruined it for me.   It's so forced, not at all entertaining and borderline bullying from the producers, a big fat fail.   I wonder if they're desperately trying to make us forget a mild sexual assault occurred?"
bbuk,3aarht,smashing3000,0,Thu Jun 18 20:19:58 2015 UTC,"Lol my first season of bbuk and im loving it. I couldnt care less cuz theres already no integrity in their gameplay. But its still entertaining as hell. Fucking love marc, helen, jade, nikki and brian. would you rather jack christian harry and danny begin to get airtime again? l0l"

bbuk,3ac6a7,BeeBeeBuckley,7,Thu Jun 18 23:31:45 2015 UTC,"I'm slightly annoyed at Victor running around giving everyone advice because since his opinions are the only ones they've gotten, they're going to take them as gospel even though they're not all necessarily right. Outside info always makes the housemates do stupid things"
bbuk,3ac6a7,bellecasey,5,Fri Jun 19 01:15:04 2015 UTC,"Cristian. His fake London ""bruv"" accent when he gets in confrontations is the male equivalent of Jade's baby voice; It's so grating."
bbuk,3ac6a7,TheFreshPrince12,8,Fri Jun 19 15:41:25 2015 UTC,Harry. She still sucks. Christian has at least opened his mouth recently.
bbuk,3ac6a7,originalnutta,3,Fri Jun 19 05:34:26 2015 UTC,Harry without a doubt is a dud and so is Jade imo (tho they've both been better than horrible lately).   I like Cristian and he's having a great week but I have to agree with whoever said 'too little too late' and to me he's just never been that interesting anywhere in this season.
bbuk,3ac6a7,JuiceBusters,2,Fri Jun 19 17:54:25 2015 UTC,I'm seriously gonna struggle to watch if iv to keep hearing Harrys horrible voice. It's like scratching a blackboard!
bbuk,3ac6a7,JuiceBusters,2,Fri Jun 19 18:08:55 2015 UTC,Ugh strongly strongly agree.   I'd like her to go 1st. If its a double-eviction then please let her be one of them.
bbuk,3ac6a7,Jotchee,2,Fri Jun 19 18:38:38 2015 UTC,"Imagine if they brought in the editors, made them explain their choices for how each HM has been represented on the HL show, and then had the HMs vote to nominate three of them to face the public vote. Now THAT would be a twist worth seeing."
bbuk,3ac6a7,aubnonymous,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:41:38 2015 UTC,Christian as well. Sure this little scrap with Jade is great because boy do I love it when people go at Jade really but otherwise nothing much there.

bbuk,3ac5zs,MerroStep,4,Thu Jun 18 22:22:10 2015 UTC,"New housemates haven't been going well in recent seasons. They're generally out very quickly, don't generate much of a fan base and aren't taken to particularly well by the original housemates who forever consider them ""newbies""  I agree though, BB7 was PERFECT"
bbuk,3ac5zs,bellecasey,2,Thu Jun 18 22:59:52 2015 UTC,"I'm cool with bringing in new housemates, but I didn't like the way they got rid of four housemates who were playing the game well, just because they decided they were boring.  Makes it seem like we were never meant to give those housemates a chance, so why should we care about the next ones they send in? They might kick them out a week later, too, for all we know.  The treatment of the original cast this series has been pretty ridiculous in general, but the idea of bringing in newbies is a good one. I just don't think they should have to degrade the current HMs just to make us excited for the new ones."
bbuk,3ac5zs,Jotchee,2,Fri Jun 19 01:53:57 2015 UTC,"I actually don't mind new housemates in general. However, in the context of this season, they took the places of housemates who, in my opinion, were unfairly evicted. There's just been too many twists and I now watch these characters with apathy, because nothing's real and anyone could go at any second."
bbuk,3ac5zs,TheFreshPrince12,-1,Fri Jun 19 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not and it should never happen.   Now, they can make a TV show called 'Rotating Summer Pool Party' or how about a 'Big Brother Style' spin0ff but it actually destroyes the very fundamental premise (and hook) of this concept itself."
bbuk,3ac5zs,JuiceBusters,2,Fri Jun 19 09:24:44 2015 UTC,There have been more seasons of BB where new housemates have been brought in than ones that haven't. There for I would say it's very much a part of the show and had been for a decade.
bbuk,3ac5zs,AcePlague,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:07:36 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt it there's been more with 'added HMs' than not and that's too bad. It breaks one of the main premises, interupts 'arcs' and blows up the whole social dynamic that took x-long to develop.  I don't mind it when its done in the first week and especially if the additions are sequestered or at least not allowed to view anything on TV.  But sure, I understand that just making everyday like a launch night and blowing up every weekend with more and more people is the ratings-grabber (with a certain desired demo).  So basically yes - 'Rotating Summer Pool Party' probably will get the highest ratings. I have to admit that's surely true."

bbuk,3a6748,tvwatcherguy,2,Wed Jun 17 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"Thought the same. Tv3 had to buy the right to the show right? And they obviously have Irish ppl in there to appeal to an Irish audience, so why not take their money in votes? Can Irish ppl vote in UK X factor?"

If he's ever watched Big Brother, he would know a housemate can go from favorite-to-win to evicted in just a week. The problem is that he is letting Helen guide him. Helen won the game because she had immunity throughout her season. Trust me, she would have been gone as soon as she was nominated. Marc doesn't have anything to protect himself from eviction. He's a goner."

Sam had his own fanbase while Gina and Dexter likely shared the same fanbase since they were friends and were always together. Even though they had the bigger fanbase, the votes were split between them for the win, allowing Sam to slide by because his entire fanbase voted for him.  This is also how Helen won.

bbuk,3a2w03,Kigurumix,7,Tue Jun 16 21:27:32 2015 UTC,I have read that they leave on Friday with the evicted housemate.

bbuk,3a2w03,OliverLyndon,9,Tue Jun 16 21:45:51 2015 UTC,How did Helen win Big Brother? I asked on the night and I ask now.
bbuk,3a2w03,Louniness,8,Tue Jun 16 21:37:34 2015 UTC,"Also I think a part of it was due to the public not wanting Ashley to win because it was clear, in my opinion anyway, thay she was being fake and all nicey nice when she realised she was close to winning."
bbuk,3a2w03,Tomla,5,Tue Jun 16 22:00:00 2015 UTC,Immunity to the finals and even then she only won by like 0.6 percent of the votes.  Which probably wasn't helped by people like me who started to skip episodes and tune out.
bbuk,3a2w03,bellecasey,3,Wed Jun 17 01:57:07 2015 UTC,She WAS that season of Big Brother. and at times she showed a vulnerable side that won her quite a few dedicated fans

bbuk,3a2w03,liaseraph,9,Tue Jun 16 21:36:01 2015 UTC,Harry needs a mercy killing. Why would you even bother going on BB when your normal reaction to being upset is to hide under the covers all day?
bbuk,3a2w03,ellelelle,6,Tue Jun 16 22:57:31 2015 UTC,It's not a normal situation so we can't really expect a normal reaction. I think she knows she is handling it in a dysfunctional way and is embarrassed by that too.. she keeps claiming to be fine but she is clearly not.
bbuk,3a2w03,the_cucumber,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:32:33 2015 UTC,She's so frustrating to watch. Completely boring and waste of space and everyone's time. She's clearly not equipped to handle the house and god for her sake I hope she doesn't shut down like this every time there's conflict and it's just a bb side effect. Brutal.
bbuk,3a2w03,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,2,Thu Jun 18 08:32:37 2015 UTC,I liked Marc before he went into the thing with the legend but now it just seems like he's taking it to far and being a dick instead of just messing about.

They nominated her for being boring but they just went overboard with the insensitivity and i'm not even a sensitive person. ""boring bitch"" i think were Marc's words."

bbuk,39ydxb,Jotchee,4,Mon Jun 15 21:35:00 2015 UTC,"I don't believe Jack's really falling for it. He pointed out what he'd seen Nikki say about him in the video package, and she just pretended not to remember. She acted like she was on a different planet, basically, and Jack said something about the situation being ""mental"". I heard him call Nikki mental, between the lines, and I doubt he's taking her very seriously. He could just be kissing ass to avoid nomination.  But Nikki did make me chuckle in the DR, talking about her lies spiraling out of control. I just hope she listens to Brian and causes more mischief in a fun way, rather than being another aggressive Helen or Marc."
bbuk,39ydxb,CRB94,12,Tue Jun 16 14:40:02 2015 UTC,Loving all the constant panning to Jack's face whenever Marc's talking about him!  :)
bbuk,39ydxb,TheFreshPrince12,13,Mon Jun 15 21:27:31 2015 UTC,"""You're not a rapper""  And you're not a physicist, Marc. It doesn't matter that he is (allegedly) getting a degree. I doubt he'll return to school after the show anyway. Besides, he has no chance of getting a respectable job because as soon as potential employers google his name, they'll be bombarded with stories about his controversy and pictures of his dick wrapped in tinfoil."
bbuk,39ydxb,ellelelle,2,Tue Jun 16 03:56:35 2015 UTC,That's why he spells his name different ways I think. I doubt he uses Marc in personal life. But I also doubt a stint on Big Brother would really stand in the way of him becoming a research scientist. Funding would be granted on the merits of his research!
bbuk,39ydxb,TheFreshPrince12,13,Tue Jun 16 19:19:06 2015 UTC,"This laundry drama is confusing to me. It seems that Harry only offered to do everyone's laundry AFTER Simon asked her. Yet it seems like Helen thinks Harry offered to do everyone's laundry and got shitty after Simon asked. Either way, Harry wasn't complaining about doing Simon's laundry; she was remarking that it is strange for a grown man not to know how to do laundry at all.   Also, have these contestants not watched Helen's season? They should know not to listen to her since she's just an aggressive bully."
bbuk,39ydxb,Jotchee,7,Tue Jun 16 03:33:42 2015 UTC,"I think a major part of the problem is that the other HMs realize that these new assholes were sent in by the producers of the show. And they literally can not outplay production, so they're intimidated by anyone who seems like a ""teacher's pet"". They're going to roll with anything that seems to be coming from production because they're disposable, as was demonstrated early in the series when several houseguests who weren't nominated were tossed out at once.  I think it's a big part of why they're intimidated by Marc, as well, especially now that he's practically been declared the star of the show, with his own back-up dancers for a week.  Anyway, I think it doesn't matter if they respect Helen or Marc as people. They're going to walk on eggshells with them because of the power they have been given by production. They could have sent in four random 8-year-old kids like that and the other HMs would be forced to listen to them."
bbuk,39ydxb,ellelelle,9,Tue Jun 16 14:30:03 2015 UTC,Well Marc gave Sam what for. I'm kinda glad he did though. She can't charm her way out of that.
bbuk,39ydxb,Smoking_Fish,4,Mon Jun 15 21:36:48 2015 UTC,"Mark needs to get of this power trip, its boring. Worse person to give that much power too. Not a mark hater btw.    Also, is he able to listen or just talk as loud and fast as he can to intimidate as much as he can?"
bbuk,39ydxb,ellelelle,11,Mon Jun 15 22:30:23 2015 UTC,"I was starting to warm to Marc because he really did bring a bit of fire and energy to the house but no one likes a bully. Him and Harry clashed, but he relished turning others against her and lording that over her is just uncomfortable to watch. Yeah, yeah Marc.. you ""won"" now let the girl enjoy whatever time she has left in the house. You don't need to twist the knife any further."
bbuk,39ydxb,Smoking_Fish,5,Tue Jun 16 01:47:15 2015 UTC,"Spot on. Hes just in a very lucky situation where the are people who like him in the house (Simon) ppl pretending to like him to keep on his side (most) people he can manipulate, Joel, Nick. And then the ones who are with him from the bunker (apart from Brian as he seems fair). Would never happen without that confidence he has. Could have easily had a situation where he came back in, and everyone just turned around and said "" Yer you saw everything we said, no one cares fuck off lol"" and invited him"
bbuk,39ydxb,ellelelle,6,Tue Jun 16 07:37:31 2015 UTC,Just gained a little bit of respect for Danny for standing up for Harry.
bbuk,39ydxb,ellelelle,3,Mon Jun 15 21:39:22 2015 UTC,And almost for Christian when he tried to tell Marc that he picked on him.
bbuk,39ydxb,Jotchee,7,Mon Jun 15 21:40:30 2015 UTC,"They did the old switcheroo with editing again. You can see the full clip of Cristian's argument with Marc at the BB web site. Marc and Helen are accusing Cristian of stuff he didn't do, and Cristian defends himself by telling the truth. Helen straight up leaves when it becomes clear that Marc and she were wrong, and Marc starts making fun of Cristian's ""rapper"" image. It was clear as day that Marc and Helen were talking bullshit, stirring it up with lies.  On the highlights show, you don't see Marc and Helen making those false statements at all. Edited out, changing the meaning of the entire scene."
bbuk,39ydxb,ellelelle,2,Mon Jun 15 22:24:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting!!! I am definitely not a Christian fan, but I'm glad he stood up to Marc tonight and I was more on his side of the argument. It's totally true that Christian has been a fence sitter and not really done anything exciting or even said anything decisive to contribute to the situation, but Marc is coming off as bitter and childish and I think this week will be to his undoing if he is not careful. He had a great opportunity but I think him and Helen together are just a really bad combination."
bbuk,39ydxb,Kigurumix,7,Tue Jun 16 01:50:00 2015 UTC,"Harry is being stubborn, ""They can come to me if they want to say hello""  And now she is off to hide in her bed, her own words."
bbuk,39ydxb,TheFreshPrince12,9,Mon Jun 15 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"I would do the same thing. Why would she go up to them and smile and hug and say hello after they nominated her? Even worse, they called her a liar and a manipulator in front of all the housemates. LOL fuck them, who would give them the time of day? They 100% should come up and say hello and speak to her on their own, not the other way around. I actually commend Harry for that because she would have looked like a dickhead if she went up and acted all cheery."

She's not good with being disliked, though she seems to pretend it doesn't bother her. She withdraws an goes into her own head. She isn't good at resolving things. In all fairness, I can see myself behaving in a similar way if I had to go up against Marc. He has the ability to influence others and people don't want to go against him. If she felt alienated or outnumbered, you have to admit she would be right to. People didn't have her back, not even Nick, and he admitted that!"
bbuk,39ydxb,glassjesoos,3,Mon Jun 15 21:28:01 2015 UTC,Well it seems the other 3 secret HMs have given Marc the confidence to argue with everybody else in the house except Joel.

bbuk,39ydxb,ellelelle,15,Mon Jun 15 22:03:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree.. I think she is feeling vulnerable and it must feel very personal. I mean she hasn't done anything wrong.. She hasn't done anything vindictive. So she goes around topless - being comfortable with her body is important in her line of work. Showing that body could also help her in her line of work. Both Marc and Helen, as people who work in adult entertainment/sex industry - they are not innocent to that. It's complete hypocrisy the way they have ganged up on her. It doesn't legitimise them and their pasts. If anything it gives them less credibility. They don't have to like the girl, but these BS reasons for ganging up on her are really weak. Her main crime is standing up to Marc, and he can twist it any way he wants but that's what it comes down to. It's obvious that they have shaken her and it's clear she is retreating into herself. TIme to back off. They've ""won"". Lording it over her will only make it more uncomfortable for everyone."

bbuk,39vw1d,MerroStep,19,Mon Jun 15 05:47:48 2015 UTC,"I actually miss Adjoa who was evicted in the first week, I think she was quite a loose cannon but we never got the chance to see that.  Aside from the legends, only Marc will be remembered from this series, the casting has been extremely poor.  All too often know it seems to be boring and dull model types like Cristian and Danny getting a spot in the house because they are 'eye candy'.  I miss whenever Big Brother would select normal people!"
bbuk,39vw1d,CRB94,12,Mon Jun 15 11:13:21 2015 UTC,"I was extremely disappointed when Adjoa was evicted. I definitely felt that she had a lot more to give to the show and she was a fascinating character to watch.  The whole #4in4out twist was meant to mix things up in the house, but Marc is realistically the only new housemate giving much to the show at the moment. There were some points where Simon created drama with Chloe, but he mellowed out, especially with Eileen gone.   I think Harriet and Sarah would have stirred things up a lot. The Twins may not have been entertaining, but you could tell they would be bitchy housemates. Harriet had no filter and would cry a lot: sounds like great potential for a housemate!"
bbuk,39vw1d,ellelelle,6,Mon Jun 15 18:16:35 2015 UTC,"I think they need to realise that ""eye candy"" means nothing in the absence of personality. Christian is not endearing, and Danny is so over the experience. It's like he is in denial that he ever wanted to be a celebrity. Now he just wants to pass judgement on those who do? Surely they could've come up with better than those two. Aaron was the best looking guy they got in, and I'm saying that as a straight female."
bbuk,39vw1d,CRB94,3,Mon Jun 15 20:36:20 2015 UTC,"I personally can not remember myself a good ""eye candy"" housemate from the previous series.

Think of Luke Marsden, Victor Ebuwa, Brian Belo, Pete Bennett - all brilliant male housemates who weren't 'model types'!"
bbuk,39vw1d,ellelelle,5,Mon Jun 15 20:44:10 2015 UTC,They definitely over rely on physical attractiveness to bring ratings.
bbuk,39vw1d,Omio,3,Mon Jun 15 20:48:35 2015 UTC,"Luke Marsden, Victor Ebuwa, Brian Belo, Pete Bennett - all brilliant male housemates who weren't 'model types'!   3 of those 4 still had showmances (and I'm pretty sure Pete holds the record for the being crushed on by the most number of girls in a season, so he's hardly the best example).    BB9 Sara, BB12 Aaron, ""Best Buttocks in Lanarkshire"" BB5 Jason etc. were all pretty great housemates despite having eyecandy value.  There's as many prettyboy duds as there are 'crazy people' duds or 'normal people' duds."
bbuk,39vw1d,CRB94,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:00:45 2015 UTC,"My argument isn't that if you're a good looking male housemate that you'll automatically be dull.  My point was that with Pete, Luke, Victor and Brian is that they are normal run of the mill people with normal life's and not wannabe celebrities like Cristian.  Cristian and Danny for me see Big Brother as just a television opportunity in order to gain exposure.  If you noticed in last nights episode Cristian had to ask who the Big Brother legends were, telling me that he probably has never seen the show before.  I feel that he and Danny would not be out of place in an MTV show like ex on the beach or ITV's Love Island.  And also I feel that Pete had so many crushes not due to his looks but instead his infectious personality."
bbuk,39vw1d,Omio,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:29:40 2015 UTC,"The ""fans"" like Nick and Jack are worse than Danny/Cristian, in that they're actively making the season worse.  Danny/Cristian are just in the same bland void as BB7 Mikey, BB9 Stuart, BB10 Kris etc.  I can agree with a lot of what you're saying in principle though - except the idea that Luke was not a wannabe.  I'm struggling to think of many housemates who were more pathetically desperate for attention than him (cf his recent Judge Rinder appearance to try and stay in the spotlight)."
bbuk,39vw1d,CRB94,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:35:05 2015 UTC,"First of can I say I appreciate your points, it's nice to speak with someone with such a keen fondness of Big Brother like myself! Would have to disagree with the point that Jack and Nick are worse than Danny/Cristian.  Even though I dislike Jack and can tolerate Nick, both of them have at least give at least some form of storylines, (Nick's love interests and Jack's fall from grace) put it this way, I would not like to be the person to be editing Danny and Cristian's best bits because they will sure be very few and far between.     That's a fair point about Luke, I guess I just found him to be a very entertaining male housemate who tried to play the game and not be some muscle bounded guy.   He even does or has done some presenting on Challenge TV for a wrestling show, something which he was involved with before he entered Big Brother.  Wasn't aware that he was on Judge Rinder however I do remember Rex Newmark once appearing and also Winston from last year's edition appearing on a ITV daytime television show."
bbuk,39vw1d,Omio,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:54:35 2015 UTC,"All fair points - as a viewer, I only really rate the housemates who create storylines I find enjoyable to watch.  Cristian's subtle insecurities have been more interesting for me to watch than Nick's transparent neediness.  And I feel like they didn't cast Danny to be interesting, so I can't blame him as much as I do someone like Nick who completely lied on his VT more than anyone.  I obviously do like plenty of ""BIG CHARACTERS"" (Rex, Marcus, Bea, Ben etc.) btw :), but I think you need some quiet ones too and Cristian's one of my favourites by default.  Also, Luke is my least favourite HM of all-time so I would switch off if someone like him was cast again (I stopped watching BB9 during the week where the highlights were dominated by ""NO WEBBECCCA NOOOOOO!"")."
bbuk,39vw1d,ZombieDonShula,9,Tue Jun 16 16:03:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think casting is soley to blame as the public kicked out the Twins, Harriet, Sarah, Eileen and Adjoa and the housemates beat Jade down until she started to play nice. So everyone that has been in an argument and then gone up has gone home."
bbuk,39vw1d,scratchmellotron,2,Mon Jun 15 17:29:02 2015 UTC,Well I think the ridiculous 4 of 6 being evicted deserves a lot of blame for that. There was no way the boring people could go.
bbuk,39vw1d,TheFreshPrince12,8,Mon Jun 15 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"A ""vote to save"" format would work better at keeping the crazy people in the house. Then characters like Cristian would be wiped out quickly as no one could be assed to actually pay to KEEP him in. Also, the live crowds would be a lot better. It seems this year it's just a mean, brooding bunch. They boo EVERYTHING."
bbuk,39vw1d,scratchmellotron,3,Mon Jun 15 17:59:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I couldn't believe it when they changed back to vote-to-evict.  It must make more money from how passionately people can hate vs want to save housemates. That's the only reason I can come up with anyway.
bbuk,39vw1d,bellecasey,3,Mon Jun 15 18:48:07 2015 UTC,"There are definitely pros and cons for both. On one hand, vote to evict is responsible for such travesties as Nikki Grahame's eviction. On the other, vote to save meant us all suffering Perez Hilton much longer than he was worth"
bbuk,39vw1d,ellelelle,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:18:45 2015 UTC,"I suspect even from a business point of view, the vote to save would make so much more sense. Especially on a night like the 4 in 4 out."

bbuk,39vw1d,jyunga,7,Tue Jun 16 19:59:43 2015 UTC,You're exactly right. That's the problem with BBUK in it's later years. Anyone that's crazy or bitchy gets put up early and goes. This is way so many people love Marc despite how abrasive and vulgar he can be. He's the only one really causing drama and tension in the house. As soon as he was sent to the bunker the house cooled down again (aside from bitching about Marc finally being gone).   If Marc doesn't stay to the end things are going to be pretty shit.
bbuk,39vw1d,ok_then23,5,Mon Jun 15 10:30:33 2015 UTC,Agree they need to stop with the eyecandy HM's. This year so boring!
bbuk,39vw1d,Smokratez,2,Mon Jun 15 15:32:50 2015 UTC,"In the house. Harry, Joel and Jack with their little hate on everyone alliance."
bbuk,39vw1d,Winter_knights,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:40:26 2015 UTC,"I've said this numerous times. The BB producers stop caring about personalities and started putting pretty faces in. They swapped unique regular people for models,  wannabe rappers, and people looking for fame. It started happening after the change to channel 5 unfortunately. When they stop doing this it will be a great show again."
bbuk,39u3r1,lukaeber,13,Sun Jun 14 20:02:10 2015 UTC,As long as Jack gets nominated this week I'll be happy with this twist.  He is the worst.
bbuk,39u3r1,BeeBeeBuckley,10,Mon Jun 15 00:59:21 2015 UTC,The thirteen questions is great. Joel's answer was scathing!
bbuk,39u3r1,ellelelle,7,Sun Jun 14 20:39:56 2015 UTC,This is going to blow up in Sam's face. You can't sit on that fence forever! She's totally been hedging her bets and now she is backpedaling big time.
bbuk,39u3r1,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Sun Jun 14 20:10:00 2015 UTC,"Obvious gameplaying. She thinks that the public disliked Marc, so she's quickly on board that train. Meanwhile, she's as boring as Danny."
bbuk,39u3r1,ellelelle,5,Sun Jun 14 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"I had such high hopes for her.. just like Nikki said. I thought she was going to be a big, bubbly, individual but she just jumps on bandwagons and tries so hard to endear herself. It's contrived, like /u/Crystal-Abyss said. That's the perfect word."
bbuk,39u3r1,ellelelle,8,Sun Jun 14 20:15:33 2015 UTC,Simon dodged Jack's twitter question.. he must've been aware of the tweets about his nasty past.
bbuk,39u3r1,Crystal-Abyss,3,Sun Jun 14 20:23:34 2015 UTC,Exactly my thoughts! The look on his face said everything
bbuk,39u3r1,im_back_baby,3,Sun Jun 14 20:24:30 2015 UTC,what nasty past? Haven't heard.
bbuk,39u3r1,ellelelle,6,Sun Jun 14 20:50:25 2015 UTC,"https://twitter.com/hashtag/abusedbysimongross  Basically he seems to have exploited a lot of people who contributed to his productions and there seems to be many disputes over work going unpaid. His agent attempted to downplay it by asking anyone with a dispute to contact him directly but as you can see, it's still going."
bbuk,39u3r1,CRB94,5,Sun Jun 14 20:53:18 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see Jack's face whenever Marc comes back in...
bbuk,39u3r1,lukaeber,13,Sun Jun 14 21:10:13 2015 UTC,"Love how Chloe was calling him out for being two-faced.  One of the first times someone in the house has called him on his shit.  He was licking Marc's balls for the two-weeks he was there, thinking the crowd would like him.  Then when he though Marc was evicted, he suddenly thinks Marc is the worst person in the world.  Jack is playing the game, but not very well.  I so wish we had live feeds so we could watch Nikki tell him how much he sucks."
bbuk,39u3r1,ellelelle,3,Mon Jun 15 01:04:24 2015 UTC,"In fairness I think Jack was vocal about not liking Marc but like Chloe pointed out, it was two faced in the sense it was behind Marc's back.. It's that Jack was too much of a coward to actually openly say it. Not the biggest Jack fan but he has at least been consistently bitter. I don't think it's game playing. Just cowardice. He is some mixture of intimidated and bitter while claiming to be entertained. That's how I'd sum up Jack since Marc came in.  I'd much prefer if he had been open like Joel and had some conviction. It's disappointing to see how wishy washy some of the housemates are in the face of conflict - Jack, Danny, Nick, SAM.. but I guess that's how most people operate in real life."

bbuk,39u3r1,chrissiecott,4,Sun Jun 14 21:29:41 2015 UTC,I hope the old HM's remember Helen Wood isn't a moral compass when she waltz's in the house tonight
bbuk,39u3r1,Kigurumix,9,Sun Jun 14 20:42:00 2015 UTC,it is so frustrating that they let them spend so much time in bed now.  In past years they would be telling then not to be in bed and they would even not let then sleep on the couches during the day.

bbuk,39u3r1,TheFreshPrince12,4,Sun Jun 14 20:23:41 2015 UTC,I ignore Cristian because the way he talks is annoying. His inflections drive me insane because he tries to sound smooth and profound. He is so contrived. I hope the returning housemates inform him on what a horrible contestant he is. The only time he is seen on screen is when he is messing with Jade or giving a non-answer.

Harry: (Asked what her boyfriend would think about her and Nick.)  Bunkher HMs: We got you now!  Harry: I don't have a boyfriend.    Is that it? Was that your pot stirring?

That is the extent of your entertainment value. If you were clever you wouldn't be hypocrites. Helen, sitting there with your tits hanging out of the side of your shirt while you slag off Harry for having hers out. Marc, walking around with your willy out because no one was paying attention to you or snuggling up with Helen in bed then slagging everyone off for doing the same.

Because she's the easiest target. I feel like I just watched a celebration of scapegoating.  I can say with ease that if the next week is about Harry being humiliated by people who have no place to judge anyone else, by people who don't even have a stake in the game, just for what BB keeps telling us is entertainment, I will be done with the show altogether. I like trashy, junk food TV, but I'm not a sadist. No, thanks."
bbuk,39u3r1,ellelelle,5,Sun Jun 14 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"My heart went out to her. Even if they don't like her.. god the housemates even made sure Showbiz didn't feel alienated. Don't do that to Harry. I can understand her standing back and being a bit overwhelmed by four massive personalities who have obviously singled her out and made a decision about her, but if it becomes something like playground bullying where Harry is purposely left out or continually attacked, I will find it difficult to watch."

There was no way it was going to be anyone other than Harry!   I think Marc and Harry have so much in common and it's actually a clash because of that. He demeans her for working in the exact same line of work as he does when he strips. It's pure hypocrisy. I'd love to call him out on that. He doesn't like her as a person, it's a personality clash. I don't believe it's because of her job, or her nudity, or her being there to get airtime. Those are bs reasons because they are all there to get airtime and make money. And he's a guy who gets his dck out for cash. He hated she stood up to him and was adversarial. He couldn't intimidate her like the others at first, so he resorted to manipulating the others so she would feel alienated."
bbuk,39u3r1,ellelelle,0,Mon Jun 15 09:26:28 2015 UTC,"I noticed that too, and I was so glad she knew at least one wasn't completely anti-her. It's just a TV show, after all."

bbuk,39phdt,JuiceBusters,2,Sun Jun 14 02:24:55 2015 UTC,I just noticed GarryBB is down too.. or at least stopped uploading any new episodes :(  It seems the others (and their new replacement channels) are also down and out.   One other option is 'torrents' and so far I've been finding new episodes posted quickly (some in high quality) here: http://kat.cr/usearch/big%20brother/?field=time_add&sorder=desc  I guess it depends a little on your geek factor but torrents are not so difficult and a light little app 'utorrent' is safe opensource and will open and download them for you. If you have a decent bandwidth they should download quick enough.  *a nice thing with getting the full download is that despite waiting a bit for it - you can then watch them without buffering or offline.
bbuk,39phdt,sandoooo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:00:39 2015 UTC,It's because the episodes are now shown in Ireland so the Irish channel is cracking down on the Youtube uploads even though Channel 5 doesn't care.

Like,"" I just can't wait for all those women because my face right now is how exciting that sounds, woo hoo-oo...."" And it makes no difference to me if Joel is not interested in dating women.  But I'm going to throw my hands up and say that: A) I wouldn't have gone on TV when I was in the closet, and B) BB clearly edited that scene to end on Joel that way, so what's the point in not talking about it now?  Joel. Gay? Closeted? Let's do work. :P"
bbuk,39hor0,bellecasey,6,Thu Jun 11 21:46:00 2015 UTC,I thought it was more that he thought Cristian was being a bit aggressive and condescending about it
bbuk,39hor0,Rorkimaru,9,Fri Jun 12 02:03:10 2015 UTC,The point of not talking about it is because if he is gay it'd be a rough experience for a 19 year old to be outed by media scrutiny. Just let him be him.
bbuk,39hor0,realister,5,Thu Jun 11 23:23:16 2015 UTC,maybe Aaron gaydar did see something in Joel who knows.   I mean look at Nick he is certainly straight but does some really gay things in the house

bbuk,39cgn1,BeeBeeBuckley,6,Thu Jun 11 08:56:18 2015 UTC,"Jack should be required to wear overalls at all times, it keeps his ass from popping out."
bbuk,39cgn1,Jotchee,12,Thu Jun 11 01:51:19 2015 UTC,"I feel sorry for Sam. She's so impressionable, just believing Marc when she knows he did not see what happened and already has it out for Harry. Danny was the first one I saw making the rubbing gesture about whatever Sam was doing in her sleep, and he brought it up in the morning, too. I don't remember who brought it up in the living room later, but it wasn't Harry. Harry's the one who bothered to stop laughing long enough to cover Sam up, and now because Marc says so, Sam somehow blames Harry for the entire embarrassing incident. SIGH  Also, Cristian doesn't know anything at all about foot fetishes, does he? I mean, it's not like he's ever been in a foot fetish video that you can probably still find on YouTube right now. :P But what was up with him saying he saw Sam masturbating and then changing his story when Marc started campaigning against Harry? Tsk, tsk....  Hey, at least this episode was relatively light-hearted. And I like the zone task. Good way to mix people up into new groups, and confine together those who have tension between them, too, but it's not really overtly sadistic or slanderous like some other tasks.  Jack needs all the naps because he is getting cranky as hell in there."
bbuk,39cgn1,ellelelle,4,Wed Jun 10 22:25:43 2015 UTC,Marc has got them housemates wrapped around his little finger. He is so good at manipulating.
bbuk,39cgn1,the_cucumber,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:07:49 2015 UTC,"Harry was the rudest though. Any nice person would drop it and say they could be wrong, even if she knows what she saw. Let Sam save face. Instead she humiliated her for the sake of being right. Disgusting behaviour from Harry and I felt terrible for Sam."
bbuk,39cgn1,Jotchee,3,Thu Jun 11 07:51:13 2015 UTC,"I think Marc whipped it up into being humiliating for Sam, for the sake of having ammo against Harry. Without him there, Sam would have probably laughed it off as the harmless banter about a harmless incident that it was. Nobody was trying to attack Sam over it, IMO. For fuck's sake, Sam gave Marc a handjob the other day, she's not shy about her sexuality, nor should she suddenly be ashamed just because Harry was one of the people playfully teasing her.  I think if Harry farted in the same room as Sam, Marc would convince Sam to think Harry was trying to suffocate her. And he'd order her not to speak directly with Harry about it, to make sure they don't clear the air (lol)."
bbuk,39cgn1,ellelelle,5,Thu Jun 11 13:44:32 2015 UTC,Jack should maybe not be a parent if he thinks this is bad!
bbuk,39cgn1,SP0oONY,3,Wed Jun 10 22:15:02 2015 UTC,Jack looks especially bad because Chloe is in exactly the same situation and she's laughing.

That's not even sneaky, Sam just isn't that bright or is knowingly going along with Marc's smear campaign for her own purposes."
bbuk,39cgn1,mixdkinkster83,4,Wed Jun 10 22:36:45 2015 UTC,Probably for her own purposes. I remember her saying how exciting she will be when she gets off the show and will have the public's attention. I Wonder how the people in UK feel about her?

bbuk,39awma,laurenisbitchin,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:12:08 2015 UTC,"I watched a ""Best Of"" video about this person I've heard about a few times, and apparently she's a total headcase. But she seemed to mostly humiliate herself a lot, and I did laugh at her ridiculous meltdowns and flailing limbs. She seemed just really annoying to live with, but she didn't seem sadistic, really, so I laughed. Why couldn't they have brought in a dude like her instead of Marc? Why is ""harasses others"" now a requirement for the token obnoxious human caricature role? (Maybe she did harass people as much as he does and it wasn't in the clip, though.)  I guess we'll be comparing the two of them a lot more pretty soon, though. Should be ... something."
bbuk,39awma,Jotchee,3,Wed Jun 10 19:32:43 2015 UTC,It's like big brother just wants us to appreciate awful garbage people.

I am so disappointed in Nick for not standing up for Harry. And letting everyone basically ostracise her. He is jumping ship to save himself. So much for being friends. He clearly had an agenda there and that was it.
bbuk,397k8g,your-beast-of-burden,9,Tue Jun 9 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting with Marc. When he is being offensive, everyone is sensitive and choosing to be offended.  However, when someone, as in Harry, gives him criticism he gets offended and acts extremely sensitive. The only reason there is a struggle between the two is Marc's fragile ego cannot stand a woman challenging him. Even Chloe has admitted in the past in the diary room she plays along so that Marc doesn't target her and will bully a different house mate.   I understand Marc trying to be entertaining. But at this point, it's tedious. It's distracting from the other housemates, and it's to the point that we aren't even getting a chance to get to know them anymore because the entirety of the plot and house is focused on Marc.   I'm really disappointed with this season. I thought it would be so much better."

Don't get me wrong, I love a bit of drama but I like when it occurs naturally and not forced with characters like Marc and Helen from last season.   In all honesty, I would react the same way as Harry especially after non of my so called friends even remotely expressed standing up for me. I would definitely have just shut down for a while and just removed myself from an uncomfortable situation for me.   I couldn't stand to live in a house with someone with such an acid tongue as he."

Marc walks around in nothing but a tiny speedo and I don't see the same derogatory remarks about him wearing shit all.   I think it's wonderful that Harry is so comfortable in her own skin. I understand why it may feel uncomfortable to some of the audience or the housemates because society has sexualized and objectified women's chests. As a society we do place way more value on a woman's bare chest than a mans and I agree with Harry that there isn't a need for it.   I think it's gross that the first thing people say when talking about Harry's nudity is making disparaging remarks about her breast shape and size. That says more about you than it does about her."

I'd agree with marcs assessment (as did most of the hm's) that she's dodgy as! I called it either on the 4 in 4 out ep,  or soon after that there's something about her I couldn't put my finger on.  She's crazy!"
bbuk,397k8g,ellelelle,7,Tue Jun 9 21:58:57 2015 UTC,"I think she's flipping at him because he is meant to be her friend .. not condescend or cajole her into submitting to Marc. Marc attacked her personally, has made horrible comments about her, and it's her fault for not playing nice? I dunno. I have to say I was disappointed in Nick this episode.. taking advice from Jade and Marc.. the two most self interested people in the house!"
bbuk,397k8g,bobb77777,0,Tue Jun 9 23:15:13 2015 UTC,Harry needs to calm down. Insinutaing that she was going to hit Marc with the bottle was way out of line. Marcs a massive twat but even he hasnt stooped to violent threats. Nick did well trying to get Harry to cop on so I hope she improves a little. I still think Nicks showmance antics are doing more harm than good. I found his relationship with Jade tedious and Harry's is no different.
bbuk,3958ue,radiofan,14,Tue Jun 9 10:12:56 2015 UTC,I'd say the main difference is that Aaron directed and rubbed naked genitals sexually.   These things aren't so much set by BB producers but by the lawyers and the Aaron thing gets dangerously close to a legit sexual assault case.   But I get your point. Marc is pushing it and has so far received some strict warnings but is there a point where he just gets repeated strict warnings over and over again then so what?
bbuk,3958ue,JuiceBusters,11,Tue Jun 9 16:01:40 2015 UTC,Two different kettles of fish! Helen Wood had loads of warnings last year and was never removed. (She also never tried to rub her flaccid penis on anyone)
bbuk,3958ue,chrissiecott,16,Tue Jun 9 11:38:30 2015 UTC,"Marks nudity was not targeted nor was it up close and personal with someone in the same way Aaron's was. Mark's comments are generally asides and his nudity was not geared towards any of the housemates. Aaron got naked, grinded up on Joel, got into Joel's bed, and repeatedly propositioned sex despite repeated requests to stop over the course of ten or so minutes.   Now there was no malice to what Aaron did. He was drunk and misreading the situation. However it doesn't change the fact that it was at the very least it was sexual harassment. Aaron's actions were a world away from anything Mark has done so far. Some housemates find Mark unpleasant but it's a different sort of misbehaviour."
bbuk,3958ue,Rorkimaru,7,Tue Jun 9 11:37:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't recall that he was grinding on Joel while naked. That makes things different. BB have been pretty zero tolerance on this in the past. Thanks for the perspective!"
bbuk,3958ue,Rorkimaru,5,Tue Jun 9 11:49:27 2015 UTC,Well grinding is probably too strong a word but there was hugging and contact as Joel tried to push him off. It was more about the invasion of personal space in an inappropriate manner than the actual nudity
bbuk,3958ue,Kigurumix,2,Tue Jun 9 12:20:10 2015 UTC,Marc has invaded other housemates personal space inappropriately.
bbuk,3958ue,bellecasey,22,Tue Jun 9 13:53:36 2015 UTC,Honestly the horrific stuff he said to Sam about being turned on when she cries was dealt with so lightly it's shocking
bbuk,3958ue,dunave,4,Tue Jun 9 12:43:40 2015 UTC,She did then wank him off in the bedroom however so I think there is a slight difference. How on earth she likes him though after the way he treats her I will never know!
bbuk,3958ue,originalnutta,-1,Tue Jun 9 22:55:31 2015 UTC,She's not all that hot and she's an alpha male in great shape. I can see why she's attracted to him..

bbuk,3958ue,whatthefrudoing,9,Tue Jun 9 15:21:25 2015 UTC,What Aaron did can be classified as sexual assault which is a much more serious offense than mild verbal abuse.
bbuk,3958ue,realister,3,Tue Jun 9 10:26:18 2015 UTC,Its a TV show after all.  Aaron exposed his genitals repeatedly I dont think anyone else did it like that.
bbuk,3958ue,PsychoLeopardHunter,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:10:20 2015 UTC,"Well, thatssorandom. IMO you're being foolisih. These days to make good television you HAVE to have someone outspoken and ridiculous.   (An Irish man speaking) I'm sure to a lot of you Marc comes off as being a hater of women/abnormal commentor, maybe even a man who takes things a strech too far! I DO BELIEVE that this is because there is a DIFFERENT sense of HUMOUR between my common folk and thee. I may be, and most probably am, completely bias towards Marc. Although I do think the man deserves a bit of credit for undergoing such strenuous, hectic abuse from ALL the housemates bar Sam. Contrary to popular belief, Marc isn't misogynistic! Marc treats women the same way he treats men - as an absolute prick! Mark says wprse things and physically pesters men in at least the same fashion as those of women in the house. So, in summary, it is unclear to me how such a man is devalued on his skew on life.  Then again, I could be completely wrong.  Apologies for any spelling/grammatical error."
bbuk,3958ue,bellecasey,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:32:10 2015 UTC,NOT TO MENTION during the highlights on the fake eviction he undid jades bikini top and she had to hold her boobs to cover them - last CBB Jeremy moved Chloe's robe thinking she had a bikini underneath and was immediately kicked out.  They really let Marc do whatever the fuck he wants
bbuk,3958ue,PsychoLeopardHunter,-7,Wed Jun 10 05:26:38 2015 UTC,"Who exactly is Marc making feel uncomfortable sexually? Fair enough he takes it quite far with Sam... But she signed herself off by agreeing to a night of hanky panky.   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I am yet to hear Marc make a misogynistic comment to one of the housemates. The worst I've heard is along the lines of 'pig'. Marc's biggest flaw in the house is the lack of a bridge between Irish and English humour. He is such an outsider, and often will have the whole house jump on the bandwagon if one is reprimanding him/scolding him, which is often the case. Marc definitely needs to town it down, but the catch 22 is - when he does, he won't be himself anymore. Very, very entertaining man."
bbuk,3967g5,ImSofaKingCole,22,Tue Jun 9 15:26:48 2015 UTC,Sorry but US big brother is 300% more scripted and produced.
bbuk,3967g5,realister,6,Tue Jun 9 20:49:05 2015 UTC,This is so true!
bbuk,3967g5,Kigurumix,3,Tue Jun 9 21:00:05 2015 UTC,It's not even the same show. Pretty much the only thing it has in common with this series is the name.
bbuk,3967g5,TheFreshPrince12,6,Wed Jun 10 03:05:00 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to enjoy it more. There was a little patch where I had the same views as you but I honestly think the 4 in 4 out twist, despite removing some of the most interesting housemates, provided us with a chance to see people like Danny/Chloe shine. Hopefully we get at least one more new housemate at some point because I can't do the consistent Marc storylines for the rest of the series but I do like him."
bbuk,3967g5,SmashingRectums,3,Tue Jun 9 20:19:07 2015 UTC,I stronly agree with you on a few things - the 4-in-4-out ruined a lot of it for me. It really violates the entire fundamental premise and imo especially worse introducing a 'professional' (Marc) which is to say he's already done a reality show (so Im told?).  And yes he is getting way too much airtime and infatuation from the editors if you ask me.   I'm more interested in the story of 'the boys' and Chloe and the ones who aren't there to be carrying on as 'characters'.
bbuk,3967g5,JuiceBusters,3,Tue Jun 9 16:05:53 2015 UTC,Lots of BBUK houseguests have done reality shows. Simon was on Hell's Kitchen
bbuk,3967g5,branfip4,3,Tue Jun 9 18:31:33 2015 UTC,Not so much worried about that as bringing in someone who's done a series as the panto-villain before and so much so that other HMs immediately recognize him.
bbuk,3967g5,JuiceBusters,3,Wed Jun 10 00:16:47 2015 UTC,Most people who apply for reality shows have applied for other shows before so there's usually a few crossovers. This isn't limited just to Marc in this season.
bbuk,3967g5,Axist,0,Tue Jun 9 22:21:34 2015 UTC,Not Applied.  I mean has been in a series before. He was the star villain in some other reality show Im told.
bbuk,3967g5,JuiceBusters,3,Wed Jun 10 00:08:39 2015 UTC,He was basically on Ireland's version of Jersey shore.
bbuk,3967g5,Rorkimaru,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:17:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but also people like Ben from BB10 had been on Come Dine with Me before, Freddie from BB10 had also been on Beauty and the Geek or something, Simon has been on another tv show, Jade is close friends with other reality tv stars etc."
bbuk,3967g5,Axist,3,Wed Jun 10 01:38:47 2015 UTC,"Okay but keep in mind I didn't tell anyone here ""Marc is THE FIRST HM who's ever been on a Reality Show!"" and now we finding out if what I said is true.  What I did say was that (like the OP) I was disappointed in the 4-in-4-out and added:   Especially since one of them was a quoteunquote 'Professional' or a 'Ringer' in that he's already had a run on Reality TV and as a 'Villain idiot' character.  So if you can see my point it wasn't that 'Hey Marc is THE FIRST and only one to ever appear on another TV show!'.   and yes that makes the 4-in-4-out especially disappointing for me anyways. IF they'd wheeled in 4 people who were 'ordinary people' I'd be happier with that.  Keep in mind again - I'm not so concerned that Marc was once on an episode of a Reality Show. Im bothered that (so people tell me) he was a long running Nasty on some series and was (even worse) brought into this house AFTER getting to sit back and watch and study the original HMs.   Hence calling him a ""professional"" whos not 'acting' per se but is sent in to do his known character and use his experience for TV on TV. ugh.  My Auntie was on an episode of 'Whats in Yer Attic' (if that was the name) and she'd still go in there as a very real person who'd probably have no better comprehension or way to start as anyone else off the street. Marc..he is a 'ringer' and a 'pro' with series experience :("
bbuk,3967g5,JuiceBusters,2,Wed Jun 10 04:21:20 2015 UTC,I have to say I am getting a bit bored. No one will stand up to Marc and he is predictable. If I wanted to see a group of adults putting themselves forward to be put down by a fake showbiz character I'd watch X factor.
bbuk,3967g5,ellelelle,2,Wed Jun 10 00:37:58 2015 UTC,"I feel like having such a big twist so soon kind of ruined the season's identity. I'm still somewhat enjoying it, but looking back on it so far it just seems a big mess.  Australia is usually my favourite BB. Although I'll have to rethink that if they have a cast so mind-numbingly dull as last year's again."
bbuk,3967g5,scratchmellotron,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:26:19 2015 UTC,"The only problem with BBAU is they're so stuck on trying to appeal to a ""family audience"" and never let anything fun on air and punish people for swearing - as an Australian I can tell you that is the antithesis of our humour and culture, so it makes everyone/everything come across slightly plastic and watered down"
bbuk,3967g5,bellecasey,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:00:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I totally get that. In spite of it I usually enjoy it more overall thanks to other aspects of the show that are done better. The housemates tend to be interesting without having circus personalities, and as a kiwi I find them a lot more relatable too.  But I do miss the late night episodes it had back in the day for sure."
bbuk,3967g5,scratchmellotron,3,Tue Jun 9 20:44:13 2015 UTC,Yeah people are definitely more genuine there. I just remember a couple years ago when one of the girls was almost kicked out for telling someone to fuck off or go fuck themselves and it's like who are the producers kidding? These are adults
bbuk,3967g5,bellecasey,2,Tue Jun 9 23:00:00 2015 UTC,"I'm personally loving it at the moment, and I'm glad they switched things up taking out my 4 least favourite characters.  I caught up on every episode I missed when I went on holiday and that was purely down to the chaos of the new housemates... If it was the regular ones I probably wouldn't have bothered as I found it pretty dull."
bbuk,3967g5,ryleto,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:31:50 2015 UTC,australia hasn't announced a regular series this year only a celeb version so the regular might be dead
bbuk,392l5o,poosmelly,8,Mon Jun 8 20:14:52 2015 UTC,Hahahahahah! I wish we could have a mash up of empathetic sensitive jade moments like her deadpan emotionless comforting Eileen when the twins went. Or saying she didn't mind about Harry while carving into the table with a knife. Or being secretly happy when Marc got called out on the first night. Or gloating over champagne when she thought everyone hated her. Or simply relishing all the food when the others were on rations. Poor sensitive soul Jade!
bbuk,392l5o,ellelelle,10,Tue Jun 9 01:00:36 2015 UTC,She has done a complete 180 since that quadruple eviction!  I just find her hilarious to watch now haha.
bbuk,392l5o,hoolytoledo,4,Tue Jun 9 01:12:43 2015 UTC,For real - I remember when she was public enemy number 1 (both inside and outside the house).
bbuk,392l5o,Axist,5,Tue Jun 9 03:01:45 2015 UTC,In fairness they don't connect. Better that then hug and cuddle her before going to the diary room and saying she wouldn't be missed
bbuk,392ryi,glassjesoos,10,Mon Jun 8 20:59:29 2015 UTC,Chloe's impression of Jade in the diary room was brilliant.
bbuk,392ryi,spaceageclockwork,7,Mon Jun 8 21:52:37 2015 UTC,Chloe is so adorable!
bbuk,392ryi,chrissiecott,3,Mon Jun 8 21:58:02 2015 UTC,seconded!
bbuk,392ryi,ellelelle,3,Mon Jun 8 21:53:48 2015 UTC,It was kind of adorable!
bbuk,392ryi,the_cucumber,2,Tue Jun 9 00:55:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't been a fan of Chloe until that diary room, she was super cute in that and I feel bad that the house has been using her like a punching bag!"
bbuk,392ryi,chrissiecott,9,Tue Jun 9 09:08:35 2015 UTC,another episode of the marc show
bbuk,392ryi,Jotchee,3,Mon Jun 8 21:01:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, at least it wasn't the ""Marc is Legendary"" show. I can see the entertainment in him being exposed as a massively insecure hypocrite. That shit was a breath of fresh air after seeing his ass kissed by the editors since he got there."
bbuk,392ryi,chrissiecott,5,Mon Jun 8 22:56:53 2015 UTC,It's only going to get worse when we vote him into the secret room with the 3 past housemates who will no doubt be there to encourage him to stir the pot!
bbuk,392ryi,Kigurumix,6,Mon Jun 8 23:17:00 2015 UTC,That's if he can keep himself in line and not get kicked out before the fake eviction.  With all the warnings he's been getting and the fact that he hasn't stopped it's only a matter of time before they have to boot him.
bbuk,392ryi,chrissiecott,5,Mon Jun 8 23:45:28 2015 UTC,I don't think he'll get kicked out. If big brother kept Helen in last year they'll do the same with him
bbuk,392ryi,Jotchee,3,Mon Jun 8 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, believe me, I've seen enough from this show to know that one fairly edited episode doesn't mean the rest of the series won't be back to the same predictably one-sided story lines we usually get.  But if I'm gonna be critical of the show when it's crappy then it's only fair to appreciate the rare times when it's slightly less crappy."
bbuk,392ryi,Jotchee,12,Tue Jun 9 00:53:06 2015 UTC,"Finally someone can get under Marc's skin the way he always tries to do with everyone else, and he can not handle it. Of course, it was funny and no big deal when he thought Danny had called him out. Makes you go hmm...  Harry made this the best episode in days, IMO, just by daring to give Marc a small taste of criticism. More, please. I like seeing narcissistic egos falling apart.  ""WHY would anybody challenge ME when they know I will just unleash abuse on them bla bla bla...."" It's just banter, kiddo. Don't be so sensitive, you idiot. LOL  And then his apology to Chloe is all about how it's not his fault because Harry made him do it. More LOL  Keeps telling Chloe that she should have said not to bring her name up, despite the fact that she did exactly that. He ignores her reminding him that she did that, and tells her she should have done that. Now we're really LOLin'.  Says he avoids Harry because he hates her so much, then can't resist calling her a pig when she's not even paying attention to him. Such amazing mental capacity.  He thinks he is ""walking on eggshells"" in there, even! The delusion is strong in that one, folks.  In other news, Chloe actually came off really level-headed and patient as fuck. She's growing on me. She must have experience dealing with irrational children.  Danny is not the smartest guy, the way he blamed Harry when Marc called her a pig out of nowhere. Stockholme Syndrome alert. Now he's just Marc's minion, apparently.  Jack was never a fave of mine, but he is really looking like an idiot now. Really cringeworthy and catty behavior from him in this episode.  All in all, a decent episode because, for some reason, BB decided to show a relatively balanced perspective of many of the housemates. It's like it's a better show when they, you know, show us what's going on. What a novel concept! :P"
bbuk,392ryi,tvwatcherguy,4,Mon Jun 8 22:29:30 2015 UTC,"I really like Chloe,  she was a bit quiet at the start but the way she handles herself is admirable!  I can see her as a dark horse for the win."
bbuk,392ryi,ellelelle,5,Mon Jun 8 22:34:12 2015 UTC,"Your summary is spot on. I was so delighted that Harry stood up to him and was not backing down. He is such a hypocrit. He can give it, but will never take it. He calls her a prostitute when she is effectively in the same line of work as him. They both take off their clothes and get paid handsomely to do it. She gets her bits out in the house, he gets his out and wraps them in tinfoil or randomly gyrates on things. The only thing he can hold against her is the fact she stands up to him and sees through him. He is threatened by her, and she is clearly not threatened by him.  Danny is coming across like a tragic asswipe. He is too cowardly to outwardly agree with Marc, but yet he endorses what Marc says and acted like Marc's enforcer when he goes to Harry? Embarrassing.   Kieran would never."
bbuk,392ryi,the_cucumber,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:32:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a little impressed that of all the people that Marc has pissed off, he's given Chloe not one, but two really sincere apologies. I don't think anyone else in there has gotten even one from him."
bbuk,392ryi,ellelelle,13,Tue Jun 9 09:11:38 2015 UTC,Jack & Danny Misery Club    ..Jealous of Nick ..Uncomfortable with Harry ..Confused about their own status in the house ..Intimidated by Marc but want to avoid confrontation    I suspect this will become a daily meeting.
bbuk,392ryi,dunave,6,Tue Jun 9 00:49:55 2015 UTC,"Since the new HMs these two have regressed the most! I mean I didn't think Danny could become less of a part of that house but somehow he managed it!   Jack however is clearly doing it out of jealousy and the fact he is no longer the favourite! He got the immunity passes and, as predicted, was forced to use them all incredibly quickly.   Without them he has become bitter and increasingly annoyed with the HMs that are taking the limelight from him! I can see him being one of the next evicted as is often the case with the 'early fav' who takes criticism far worse than others, as they see the public on their side!"
bbuk,392ryi,ellelelle,3,Tue Jun 9 01:02:25 2015 UTC,I can see Jack coasting along for a while more with Sam and Simon in there as great distractions.. Marc will get saved by the week with the old housemates I'm guessing.  I do expect some sort of meltdown though so I wonder if what you say will come to pass!
bbuk,392ryi,xorosetylerxo,2,Tue Jun 9 02:36:36 2015 UTC,Danny lost the people he was closest to in Sarah and Kieran and then had these 4 new people come in and he's just lost because he doesn't have Sarah or Kieran to talk too
bbuk,392ryi,Out_of_Chicken,4,Tue Jun 9 08:03:58 2015 UTC,I think Danny has actually stepped up a bit into Kiernan's role.
bbuk,392ryi,ellelelle,5,Tue Jun 9 01:40:47 2015 UTC,"Tried and failed, my friend! ;)"
bbuk,392ryi,ed2rummy,2,Tue Jun 9 02:30:22 2015 UTC,"""jack are you cry?"" .... ""you know what Kieran would do?""  I remember when Jack was crying after Kieran left."
bbuk,392ryi,Kigurumix,3,Tue Jun 9 02:53:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, Marc and Sam are going for it."
bbuk,392ryi,ellelelle,6,Mon Jun 8 21:01:56 2015 UTC,I don't know why it made me feel so uncomfortable. I would not be able to be in the same room!
bbuk,392ryi,the_cucumber,0,Tue Jun 9 00:55:51 2015 UTC,That was pretty shameless. I feel bad for Sam. Part of me hopes she was too drunk to remember because ew but on the other hand that would be rape so I dunno what's worse willfully sleeping with Marc or getting to at least claim ignorance...
bbuk,392ryi,dunave,5,Tue Jun 9 09:14:53 2015 UTC,"Marc is getting a lot of shit for being 'disrespectful towards women', even at times when he really hasn't been!"
bbuk,392ryi,tvwatcherguy,5,Mon Jun 8 21:08:17 2015 UTC,"He has, but he's been disrespectful to everyone,  he just knows how to get on peoples nerves. I don't agree with calling people ""cum dumps"" and STI test remarks at Chloe etc. But I think Harry is also very very clever,  turning it into more than it is! People seem to be lapping it up.    They're both as bad as each other IMO, playing the game well."
bbuk,392ryi,dunave,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:11:42 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that he has been disrespectful at times in there (in fact a lot of the time).   But yea my thought was that people are now using it as something against him all of the time and with everything he seems to do, even when it clearly isn't true and he is clearly just having a laugh (and I'm not talking about his definition of laugh)!  Harry has also indeed been completely overplaying the point on Marc though and has begun to really get on my nerves as of this episode."
bbuk,392ryi,ellelelle,7,Mon Jun 8 22:26:22 2015 UTC,"Man I am the exact opposite! I think she is actually coming into her own now! I was getting tired of her and Nick just sitting around cutesy all the time.. and I am extra glad that now there is at least one person who won't back down to him. I don't think she is overplaying it. He is a complete hypocrite - him and Harry have more in common than anyone else in the house considering their line of work and he tries to use it against her? What is that if not misogyny? It's OK if he gets his bits out and grinds on things sexually, but she can't stand around in a bikini in non-sexual contexts? It's totally a personality clash, but I think he is more threatened by her standing up to him than she is of him. She's ruining his fun by not rolling over and letting him put her down? Pity about him!"
bbuk,392ryi,bobb77777,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Harry seems very manipulative. At 2.19(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5p4kUQtSzY) she told Nick to pretend they were shagging, but then at the 5 minute mark she's complaining that Nick led her on and she fell for it hook line and sinker. Marc no better, so tbh Im actually struggling to find a housemate thats both likeable and interesting(Chloe and christian have about as much personality as a roll of toilet paper)"
bbuk,392ryi,tvwatcherguy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:39:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah 90% agree.  It's just about Christian and Chloe I think we need to remember were watching what 50 odd minutes of a 24 hour day. With Marc,  Harry, Simon etc taking the air time that doesn't mean the others aren't playing a roll that bb just can't fit it."
bbuk,392ryi,tvwatcherguy,3,Tue Jun 9 21:45:37 2015 UTC,"I would love to see Marc sent to the secret lair,  just too see harrys face when he comes back!  Haha."
bbuk,392ryi,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Mon Jun 8 22:02:50 2015 UTC,"Serious question: Is Harry really married, legally? She keeps talking about her wife. I got the impression that she was single."
bbuk,392ryi,the_cucumber,5,Tue Jun 9 05:43:33 2015 UTC,Yeah that was really unclear. Sam said that Harry can sleep with her wife/best friend and other girls but not with other guys because she's straight..?? What??? I'm confused.
bbuk,392ryi,Zhen_Ji,2,Tue Jun 9 09:23:34 2015 UTC,She said it was just a friend she lived with but she calls her 'wife'.
bbuk,392ryi,TheFreshPrince12,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:27:31 2015 UTC,"Nick has become so cringey; This is why I hate showmances. I'm gonna have to call it like I see it: Harry is a shitty person because she knows Nick has genuine feelings for her and, because she is aware of this, she knows that she is leading him on. Romantic subplots are the bane of reality tv."
bbuk,392ryi,BeeBeeBuckley,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:23:02 2015 UTC,"I think the reason that Harry is so pissed off at Marc is because Marc sees right through her game plan, and Harry is teasing Nick. Harry and Jade are so similar personality wise, both with their detachment from intimate relationships and their inability to acknowledge that they care about anything or anybody."
bbuk,38z14f,Hooligang,17,Mon Jun 8 01:19:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, he almost made me feel bad for Simon tonight by the way he was treating him.  He can't take a nomination..should have taken the car haha"
bbuk,38z14f,siimsgirl,3,Mon Jun 8 01:36:57 2015 UTC,"That argument that Jack started with Simon was such a fail. And so unneccesary since Jack wasn't even nominated. I think Jack was starting shit with Simon because Simon is nominated, and Jack was using his own influence with the audience to persuade a Simon eviction. Ha! Jack doesn't realize that the audience is over Jack mania."
bbuk,38z14f,BeeBeeBuckley,9,Tue Jun 9 14:49:44 2015 UTC,I'm really surprised how cynical he turned out to be
bbuk,38z14f,springer070,18,Mon Jun 8 01:58:23 2015 UTC,Dude has a chip on his shoulder that he can't eat.
bbuk,38z14f,Meeha,8,Mon Jun 8 01:54:51 2015 UTC,Ooooh he's gonna be maaaad when he doesn't win this after rejecting a brand new car...
bbuk,38z14f,nirzenra,5,Mon Jun 8 17:46:17 2015 UTC,I don't know what anyone ever saw in him.
bbuk,38z14f,lukaeber,7,Mon Jun 8 14:18:51 2015 UTC,He thinks because people voted for him as the winner he's got the audience on his side. I would love for the audience at an eviction show to go Get Jack Out
bbuk,38z14f,xorosetylerxo,6,Tue Jun 9 12:50:56 2015 UTC,"Ugh he's so annoying, I hate that I liked him. I get frustrated everytime he has an unwarranted rant or is gossiping like a little bitch"
bbuk,38z14f,jwC731,5,Mon Jun 8 10:54:38 2015 UTC,Fantastic. Wanted to talk shit about Jack. There's other people who agree. They fed his ego a tiny little bit and he starts acting like everything he does is important.
bbuk,38z14f,Smokratez,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:26:55 2015 UTC,SJW at its finest. He's a twat and I hope the other HMs smell his bullshit and nominate him.
bbuk,38xwyv,xorosetylerxo,17,Sun Jun 7 19:59:16 2015 UTC,Wow Jack getting angry that Simon nominated him for not connecting when he nominated Adjoa for not connecting
bbuk,38xwyv,Misspells-Definitely,8,Sun Jun 7 20:55:29 2015 UTC,"Also, Big Brother has some nerve calling Simon out for nominating Jack ""because they don't connect."" Where was BB when Adjoa was being nominated for the same reason?   One may argue that such nominations are only allowed in the first few weeks but this is Simon's second week."
bbuk,38xwyv,xorosetylerxo,5,Mon Jun 8 05:39:16 2015 UTC,I know that annoyed me a lot.
bbuk,38xwyv,TheFreshPrince12,3,Mon Jun 8 08:02:21 2015 UTC,"Big Brother needs a clear antagonist the house can gang up on. First it was Jade, so they aired her conversation with Nick. But she didn't have what it takes to be the bitch, so they moved on. Next was Marc, so they made him head of a task that would allow him to abuse the housemates. But the plan backfired because the housemates, despite thinking he is an asshole, find him too entertaining to hate, so they moved on again. Now it's Simon, but I don't see him being the antagonist much longer. I wonder who the producers have lined up to be the next villain? Probably whoever walks back in the house with the fake evictee..."
bbuk,38xwyv,ellelelle,4,Mon Jun 8 22:57:54 2015 UTC,That's a good catch.
bbuk,38xwyv,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,-2,Sun Jun 7 22:48:28 2015 UTC,He didn't really say not connecting. He just talked about himself and didn't give a reason and then he said It was because jack will win.
bbuk,38xwyv,-randomity-,4,Sun Jun 7 21:37:33 2015 UTC,"""You're not giving me a chance to get to know you properly and for us to connect...I don't feel I can connect."""
bbuk,38xwyv,xtinaphile,9,Sun Jun 7 22:24:06 2015 UTC,Why has everyone turned on Sam?! Because she was 'disrespectful' to Eileen? Did she die?? Jeez  Cristian is really annoying me - he's literally a zero person.
bbuk,38xwyv,pomegranatechips,12,Sun Jun 7 23:34:11 2015 UTC,"But, it was totally fine when Joel was making jokes and laughing when Adjoa was in the process of getting evicted, right?"
bbuk,38xwyv,ellelelle,3,Mon Jun 8 02:11:27 2015 UTC,Didn't he make some awful joke about her getting booed or something? Really insensitive. I will need to watch back.
bbuk,38xwyv,originalnutta,3,Mon Jun 8 19:36:34 2015 UTC,The original housemates are so fucking lame. They act like they were such a tight crew and bffs and evicting someone is the worst thing ever. Get the fuck over it. I hope a new HM wins now just because the originals are whiny bitches.
bbuk,38xwyv,modernbenoni,3,Mon Jun 8 12:51:29 2015 UTC,"They're always like that though, and a late entry has ever won."
bbuk,38xwyv,ellelelle,2,Mon Jun 8 20:12:01 2015 UTC,There's a lot of entitlement going on. That made watching the likes of Sarah and Harriet get evicted kind of amusing. Bitter was not the word.
bbuk,38xwyv,modernbenoni,2,Mon Jun 8 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"I like Christian for standing up for Simon tbh. I don't like Simon but really he's only annoying, he doesn't deserve to find himself with ~10 people stood up against him insulting him as often as he does."
bbuk,38xwyv,RideOrDieRemember,20,Mon Jun 8 20:13:13 2015 UTC,Jack really needs to get over this self entitlement he has. I've done a total 180 of my opinion of him.   It felt so uncomfortable watching/listening to Nick talk to Harry while they were in bed
bbuk,38xwyv,modernbenoni,2,Sun Jun 7 20:32:28 2015 UTC,Yeah like he gets so angry and just cares so much about it all. Like don't take everything so seriously and just enjoy yourself.
bbuk,38xwyv,Natniss,6,Mon Jun 8 20:13:55 2015 UTC,Lol marc sounded so rapey
bbuk,38xwyv,ellelelle,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:43:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I cringed for him and then cringed with Sam when she seemed to accept his explanation.. what... that should've been pointed straight out to him.. and then Danny going along with it. Ugh.. it turned my stomach. And I was feeling a bit delicate to begin with.
bbuk,38xwyv,ecctv,7,Sun Jun 7 22:54:18 2015 UTC,"Not a Simon fan but everyone is being so rude to him. Cristian being mad at him for NOT nominating Chloe? Jack verbally attacking him for nominating him in the garden. I'm only halfway through the show, but dang.  Jack is a little bitch. And Joel peed in the sink? Ew."
bbuk,38xwyv,zummerzet,6,Mon Jun 8 00:40:19 2015 UTC,I really don't get the love for Marc. Apparently being an all round twat and calling people disgusting names is 'irish banter' now?
bbuk,38xwyv,the_cucumber,3,Sun Jun 7 21:10:37 2015 UTC,I think being in the Navy is a bigger influence than his being Irish. Those guys really rail on each other but most of them know how to tone it down when they get back to the public and real life.
bbuk,38xwyv,Jotchee,4,Mon Jun 8 21:18:19 2015 UTC,"He creates situations in which people are offended just to convince himself that he's not a sensitive ""baby"" like they are. He's desperate to see himself as a big, strong man who laughs in the face of conflict. Clearly he was bullied at some point, made to feel weak, and now he's continuing the cycle. Massive insecurity going on there."
bbuk,38xwyv,-randomity-,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:19:51 2015 UTC,To be fair Irish banter is a bit crude and usually we wouldn't take much offense to things because we inherently have a low opinion of ourselves anyways. Generally speaking.
bbuk,38xwyv,Jotchee,5,Sun Jun 7 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"It's not an Irish thing to be aggressively annoying. It's an asshole thing. Irish people are not assholes in general, no matter how often Marc tries to hide behind this fallacy.  Even if Irish people were assholes in general, Marc would still be responsible for his own behavior. Because he's supposed to be an adult."
bbuk,38xwyv,-randomity-,2,Sun Jun 7 23:44:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's being a bit of an eejit, he says it himself it's not the real him. That whole over the top, annoying behaviour is him playing up. The stuff that comes out of his mouth, I can vouch is what would pass as grand banter here."
bbuk,38xwyv,ellelelle,3,Mon Jun 8 00:13:47 2015 UTC,"Not with me, it wouldn't. I wouldn't be having ""the craic"" with that Marq. Seriously."
bbuk,38xwyv,Jotchee,4,Mon Jun 8 19:39:50 2015 UTC,That's sad.
bbuk,38xwyv,deathbelle,4,Mon Jun 8 00:43:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's def playing up. I don't really agree with you about it being grand banter though, no lad I know has ever said the shit he says to women."
bbuk,38xwyv,poosmelly,10,Mon Jun 8 09:56:14 2015 UTC,"Take it on the double chin, Jack. You're not even up for eviction"
bbuk,38xwyv,pomegranatechips,5,Sun Jun 7 21:22:23 2015 UTC,"I mean I can't stand Simon or Marc, but the original housemates nominate so cowardly. All of their reasons for nominations are basically incoherent regurgitations of what the previous person had said. Their reasons are so generic, and (in most cases) it applies to themselves as well regardless of if they realise it or not. Pissing in the sink sounds more disrespectful to me than trying to stay positive after someone was evicted (who half of the house nominated anyways.)  You can tell the house is nominating like sheep when Nick finally feels confident with face-to-face without those weird hand gestures."
bbuk,38xwyv,modernbenoni,3,Mon Jun 8 02:27:13 2015 UTC,"Oi I really like Marc and honestly right now I want either Simon or Marc to win. Simon just because fuck everybody else, and Marc just because fuck everybody else but in a different way."
bbuk,38xwyv,ellelelle,6,Mon Jun 8 20:15:18 2015 UTC,"I was really tiring of Sam's schtick but now I'm more bewildered by the fact Christian, Jade and even Danny are getting to coast along while the newbies take the heat/ask for the heat.   I am sick of the Marc/Simon show too, to be honest. Marc just makes me roll my eyes constantly. And the editing is way disproportionate. I know he has some wit and charm and definitely knows what he is doing when it comes to making airtime for himself but I could care less about it. It's not real or meaningful.. there's no substance to it. He is the true Showbiz of the house. I really wouldn't mind if any of them or each of them went, to be honest.  Maybe it's getting to that point of the season where I get a bit bored?"
bbuk,38xwyv,Jotchee,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:59:53 2015 UTC,Marc is a joke. He thinks the rest of the world needs to conform to suit his personality. I actually feel sorry for the kid.
bbuk,38xwyv,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,4,Sun Jun 7 21:08:21 2015 UTC,"Simon is such a fake ass bitch. Nominating jack because he wants to have a journey or whatever bullshit he tried to say for his reason. I hope mark goes into the lair because he will probably be safe for eviction after. This means Simon will be up (most likely) and hopefully go the week after that. I predict many tearless vying sessions and many ""I'm going to leave"" tantrums."

bbuk,38xwyv,Smokratez,0,Mon Jun 8 10:52:13 2015 UTC,Please shut the fuck up Joel. You do nothing entertaining. All you do do is bitch about people. BB picked you because you can't decide your sexuality. Marc stop answering to Joel. I already think you are beta. You are not helping this image of you. Tell Joel to fuck off. You are acting like he is your boss.
bbuk,38xwyv,Smokratez,-4,Mon Jun 8 10:53:09 2015 UTC,"Because Nick is in bed with a self admitted dumb slag, I should think he is doing something worth while? Wow, this show has a low opinion of men."
bbuk,38xwyv,Smokratez,-3,Mon Jun 8 10:56:49 2015 UTC,BB gives Marc a talking to about his words. Mean while Harry does everything in the nude. BB finds male words more offensive than a naked woman. What a joke.
bbuk,38xwyv,Lockowandt,5,Mon Jun 8 10:42:06 2015 UTC,"Did you even listen to what Marc said about Sam? It was disgusting, I'm surprised Marc fans are trying to brush that off."
bbuk,38xwyv,Smokratez,-1,Mon Jun 8 13:01:02 2015 UTC,I am not a Marc fan. He is a beta boy who uses words to get attention. He is literally a woman.
bbuk,38xwyv,ellelelle,7,Mon Jun 8 18:44:37 2015 UTC,How can you see anything through all that misogyny?
bbuk,38xwyv,Smokratez,0,Mon Jun 8 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"What mysogyny? He loves women. He is rude to everyone, not only women. If he was only rude to women, you might have a point. However he is a dick to everyone. That is an indication of immaturity, not misogyny. Do you even know what that word means?"
bbuk,38xwyv,ellelelle,5,Mon Jun 8 20:00:25 2015 UTC,I'm not surprised you thought my comment was about Marc.. but maybe you are trying to be ironic.
bbuk,38xwyv,Smokratez,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"I am talking about Marc. You are talking to me. If you are not talking about Marc, why are you talking to me? Kindergarten psychology."
bbuk,38xwyv,ellelelle,4,Mon Jun 8 20:21:02 2015 UTC,"The comments you yourself made about Marc betray your own misogyny. You set yourself up as spokesperson for Marc, but really it's more about what you've had to say here.  Marc will say anything to get a bit of airtime, and uses obvious, tactless misogyny to do it. He is nothing if not efficient.   You can't seem to see past your own bias here!"
bbuk,38xwyv,Smokratez,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"Oh now I hate women. Because I think that someone doesn't hate women, I hate women? Holy shit. Are you like this outside of the internet as well?"
bbuk,38xwyv,ellelelle,4,Mon Jun 8 20:41:36 2015 UTC,I think maybe you need to learn a little bit more about the ways in which misogyny can manifest itself.   You think you can belittle a man by comparing him to a woman as if being a woman is a bad thing.. and not be somehow misogynistic?  Think about it.
bbuk,38xwyv,Smokratez,-7,Mon Jun 8 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"Marc you did something manly, please stop doing that since we are social justice warrriors who hate anything male. Sincerely Big Brother."
bbuk,38yf46,Jordy_Banks,2,Sun Jun 7 22:18:48 2015 UTC,"Marc will be the most entertaining coming back into the house, so I hope it is him.  I was actually hoping it was Nick, although he isn't really my favorite anymore.  It seems like it would be something that Nick would really appreciate and use."
bbuk,38yf46,lukaeber,2,Mon Jun 8 14:20:48 2015 UTC,"I would definitely agree with that.  Anything where Simon thinks he's being rewarded is definitely not a good situation.    As annoying and douchey as Marc can be, he's still entertaining.  Sam is the best of the three options!"
bbuk,38yf46,Skwrelz,-1,Sun Jun 7 23:24:50 2015 UTC,Sam literally does nothing other than eat and walk after Marc and Simon. Why would you think that's the best option?
bbuk,38yf46,Smokratez,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:47:37 2015 UTC,"Sam is pointless in the house right now as you've said.  Maybe she'll at least become slightly more interesting if she doesn't have Marc to rely on.  I would rather watch Marc in the house, and Simon I don't want to get anything good because I just want him to leave.  Therefore, with the way I'm looking at it Sam is the best of the three options."
bbuk,38yf46,Skwrelz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:52:43 2015 UTC,"They'll focus a lot on whoever goes in there, so I'd rather it be one of the guys because they don't bore me to tears."

bbuk,38xiwm,Lockowandt,7,Sun Jun 7 18:11:23 2015 UTC,Predictable yes but now I wonder who would get the most votes keeping in mind the voters know its 'who to hide in the secret room'. I'm thinking Marc.   In a way he should stay in though because he's the stir stick inside the house.   Then I don't want to watch Simon fake-crying and being 'bitchy' or whatever the hell he does.   Sam would be good though - she delights in cruelty and poking from a distance.
bbuk,38xiwm,JuiceBusters,9,Sun Jun 7 18:16:09 2015 UTC,I can't believe how Christian is getting to coast by doing absolutely nothing. These newbies were great for him and Jade. Now they don't have to feel like outsiders and get to blend in.  I hope Marc goes to the secret lair.
bbuk,38xiwm,ellelelle,6,Sun Jun 7 22:25:38 2015 UTC,"I hope Marc goes into the ""lair"" just so I can watch the other housemates exist for a while without a desperate cartoon villain hovering around them all the time."
bbuk,38xiwm,Jotchee,2,Sun Jun 7 21:27:52 2015 UTC,"Without marc everyone in the house is dull, all nick does is pick his nose and get played by a girl. And jack just bitches and moans"
bbuk,38xiwm,branhoo88,2,Mon Jun 8 13:17:54 2015 UTC,I understand that but I've completely gone off him since his recent comment about Sam. I could never support someone who said something like that.

bbuk,38xiwm,lukaeber,2,Mon Jun 8 07:30:26 2015 UTC,I think he is going in. I'm not sure what it would do to his popularity though. What if he annoys the ex-housemates?
bbuk,38xiwm,CumCum2000,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:04:05 2015 UTC,". . . disappointing.  I get why all the newbies were nominated, but I was hoping someone else would be thrown in to keep things interesting.  They should have gone to five and put Joel and Harry up for noms as well.  No one in the house will be shocked if any of the three are (fake) evicted."
bbuk,38v84t,mistermonstermash,8,Sun Jun 7 02:54:08 2015 UTC,I get what he's doing and he's done a fairly good job of it after all. he has more experience than the others and so far so good but..  ..even after 'getting it' I'm not so sure I love it over and over again and maybe the editors are a little too infatuated with the whole thing.
bbuk,38v84t,JuiceBusters,2,Sun Jun 7 04:50:47 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, he definitely annoys me. I wouldn't want to be friends with him or anything, I'm just speaking in the context of ""good housemates"".  All I meant is that he's clearly more self-aware than I thought he was before, and knows his role. Biggest game player in there, but what he's doing is making it all work so much better."
bbuk,38v84t,JuiceBusters,4,Sun Jun 7 04:56:01 2015 UTC,Oh yes I agree. I did think he was fairly clever from the beginning (I didn't know him from his previous reality show) but yes he does seem to be a decent guy beneath it all.  he has a kind of advantage though in fariness - he's an experienced reality show trouble-maker character and was called into this one with a lot of inside information on everyone else and (thankfully for us I think) knows he's not there to win at the end.   But yes I think he's been a great HM so far but I'm starting to get a little annoyed with too much airtime.
bbuk,38v84t,Jotchee,7,Sun Jun 7 06:34:48 2015 UTC,"I've found the last several days to be quite tedious with Marc in there. Half the show is about him needing attention or others talking about how tiresome he is. Maybe I've just seen too much reality TV already, so someone like Marc is not that impressive. He's too predictable, IMO, and now so is the show in general."
bbuk,38v84t,originalnutta,2,Sun Jun 7 15:25:13 2015 UTC,I could actually see him on BBUS or BBCAN and going far. I love the guy. He makes the house fun. Even Danny is getting airtime now.

bbuk,38tx4s,ecctv,6,Sat Jun 6 20:03:35 2015 UTC,its ridiculous that they're all kind of mad at Sam and Simon for making Eileen leave. She had been nominated EVERY previous week BY the housemates!
bbuk,38tx4s,the_cucumber,4,Sat Jun 6 23:41:35 2015 UTC,"Hilarious to hear Simon whining about being the oldest housemate left now though. After nominating Eileen for being the oldest. That is the most shortsighted thinking I've ever seen, lol."

bbuk,38tx4s,dunave,3,Sat Jun 6 20:09:37 2015 UTC,Then again Harry being without her suitcase would barely make a difference...  She'd probably tie it around her waist and continue to stroll around with her baps out!
bbuk,38tx4s,RideOrDieRemember,4,Sat Jun 6 23:11:58 2015 UTC,"Simon definitely was hoping for a return of the gift, saying how much we would love to have it.  What do people think about Jade being jealous of Harry with Nick? Seemed odd giving the handcuffs to Harry when Jade knew she was going on a date with Nick."
bbuk,38tx4s,-randomity-,4,Sat Jun 6 20:32:04 2015 UTC,Sabotage! Lol! She mentioned Sam and Marc or Nick and Harry in the diary room so defo wanting to infringe on the date
bbuk,38tx4s,dunave,4,Sat Jun 6 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"Completely agree! She was definitely wanting to ruin their 'date' and I'm not really sure why (being as she said he would only ever be her friend), it's most likely because she knows she has lost attention since Nick basically sacked her off.  It also successfully ruined Nick and Harry's date. Marc was Marc and just took over, whilst Nick clearly felt uncomfortable talking to her while he was there! In a way she played it well (from her POV)!"
bbuk,38tx4s,-randomity-,5,Sat Jun 6 23:10:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm glad! I think Marc felt a bit weird that there was an awkward air between Harry and Nick, with him being uncomfortable at all. So that's why he starting messing around trying to lighten the mood. And he was right too, it is a TV/game show."
bbuk,38tx4s,wiiwierdo,3,Sat Jun 6 23:44:03 2015 UTC,"My theory is Simon knows Chloe doesn't trust him (I mean, she straight up told him she'd never trust him again) so he knew that if he played up how nice the gift was she'd naturally think it was bad and reject it. Simon knows exactly what he's doing in there."
bbuk,38tx4s,the_cucumber,2,Sat Jun 6 22:20:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people are ad at Simon for that. He got what he wanted by saying what he needed to say and that was the point of the task. It's Chloe's fault she turned down the gift. Like Jack said, at least she's not left off any worse like he was. She's just being petty now."
bbuk,38tx4s,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Sun Jun 7 08:31:30 2015 UTC,Marc and Danny still trying to sort out who is more alpha.
bbuk,38tx4s,Smokratez,2,Sat Jun 6 20:07:39 2015 UTC,Neither of them are. Marc is too sensitive for himself and Danny will protect women to any cost.
bbuk,38tx4s,ed2rummy,0,Sun Jun 7 11:55:02 2015 UTC,"Keiran was by far the most alpha, but he had the save-a-hoe white knight quality"
bbuk,38tx4s,Smokratez,3,Sun Jun 7 16:37:46 2015 UTC,"I like how well Danny can lie. He told Sam that she wouldn't mind having to be invisible, while what he mean was that she needed to shut to fuck up since he is sick of her. I wonder if anyone else watching this show can see more than one layer."
bbuk,38tx4s,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Sun Jun 7 11:53:55 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that if you reject the gift, that is the safest choice. There should be some penalty to rejecting the gift, other than simply not getting something nice."
bbuk,38tx4s,the_cucumber,2,Sat Jun 6 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"Joel: ""when I get in the shower, 'where's Mark??'""   Haha poor Joel. That won't help the closet rumours go away."

bbuk,38tx4s,Smokratez,2,Sat Jun 6 20:49:03 2015 UTC,I don't hate Sam. I can tell you what I don't like about her. She seems like she doesn't have a personality. She follows around Marc. That's all she does. I don't mind. But other people might get upset.
bbuk,38t411,Lockowandt,2,Sat Jun 6 16:15:24 2015 UTC,"Well people did talk about nomination tonight, this is them replaying it this morning."
bbuk,38t411,ed2rummy,3,Sun Jun 7 00:43:31 2015 UTC,Sooooooo is there ever going to be a round of normal nominations/eviction in this series?
bbuk,38t411,ConnDeReplay,4,Sat Jun 6 16:32:09 2015 UTC,Not until Big Brother stops looking for attention at every opportunity. It's like Simon and Big Brother have the same personality traits.
bbuk,38t411,ConnDeReplay,5,Sat Jun 6 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel like if this season had been left alone from the beginning it would have been fantastic. Everyone seemed just a bit off so house dynamics and natural tensions would have arisen and whatnot without any prodding. But C5 seems hellbent on trying to turn it into what last series was aka CONFLICT AND FIGHTING AND DRAMA AT EVERY MOMENT and it's all too much. I feel like even though I've grown fond of some housemates (most of which have been evicted at this point -__-) I can't get comfortable at any given moment because another twist will be thrown in and lord knows who will leave because of it."
bbuk,38t411,scratchmellotron,3,Sat Jun 6 17:08:47 2015 UTC,Yea. And I felt the exact same way last season too. We never get a good feel of the housemates and their dynamics because they're constantly having to react and adjust to some external influence.
bbuk,38t411,JuiceBusters,4,Sat Jun 6 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"Sam and Marc seem like the most obvious next to Simon as well. Of course the problem for me is that I think we've all had enough of Simon (I did after 10 minutes of episode 1) while Marc and Sam still have a lot of potential left.   Mind you.. Sam is strangely dull to me. I can't explain why because I feel she should be super entertaining to me...  but I actually saw this and was ""Sam.. which one is that??"" and righhhht yes her of course!  Maybe more bikinis from her?"
bbuk,38t411,Tomla,4,Sat Jun 6 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"She's basically been overshadowed by the Marc and Simon shows since she's been in there. Even Harry gets more play than she does. She's never been the center of attention, really. At this point she's just going to have to have a big row with someone to get any kind of spotlight."
bbuk,38t411,JuiceBusters,2,Sat Jun 6 17:20:16 2015 UTC,"Ya it might be a lot with the editing lately and those 2 (marc, simon) really getting all the showcasing.   I kinda like her as a HM but ya she needs to have some kind of fight/drama/sexual exploits. Otherwise she seems to stir stuff then disappear somewhere for the rest of the day somehow."
bbuk,38t411,dunave,2,Sat Jun 6 17:34:49 2015 UTC,"I think she definitely could have been a big player had she successfully continued to pursue Marc (the cuddling/almost kissing in bed etc), but at the same time it all came across as a bit fake and Marc wasn't reciprocating that much! Since that moment she's faded.  However, if she has been nominated this week I think she will up her game and certainly try and put her mark on the house so next week should be interesting!"
bbuk,38t411,JuiceBusters,3,Sat Jun 6 23:17:33 2015 UTC,"Sam would be a good person to fake evict because we will see more of her but the public is going to choose Marc by a landslide with Jade and Simon tailing behind him. I predict Sam, Simon, Marc and Jade to be up this week by the way."
bbuk,38t411,Beevo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:58:57 2015 UTC,I'd like to think Marc would stay just because the public might be getting keen on the idea of keeping the superstirring highly annoying people in but...  ... I'm sure you are right. He will get evicted and especially by the crowd mostly likely to vote the most.   Sam does have more potential to be a good 'secret room' shlt-stirrer since she seems delighted to do poke and snicker from a distance.   Marc may actually be really disappointed since almost entirely this reward is actually BEING the 'stir stick' himself!

bbuk,38t411,Beevo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:20:41 2015 UTC,I think this week its a 'fake vote' sorta thing. The HMs don't know it but the audience is in on the scheme.  So the 'loser' will actually be whisked off into a secret room with some former HMs to watch the house in secret.   Mind you.. it might still be Simon who could be a good candidate and Marc is better in the house IMO too. Good TV yes heh

bbuk,38t411,Misspells-Definitely,2,Mon Jun 8 00:40:10 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying. The public doesn't necessarily need to see this as 'rewarding their fave' (of the nominees) but may still see it as a chance to get the HM out of the main house.   So you'd still get stuck with Simon in terms of the TV show going to him and the other group on the secret house BUT at least he's OUT of the main group.  Personally, at this point I'd want to vote out Simon too and mainly because I think Sam and Marc are definitey way more interesting in play among the housemates.   Simon can do more being bitchy in a secret room I'd say."
bbuk,38qqck,sanyosukotto,5,Sat Jun 6 00:36:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Perez told Rylan that he asked to leave and BB begged him not too. But Perez is prone to lying about things or twisting things to make himself look better so I don't know. People kept Perez in because they thought he was entertaining."
bbuk,38qqck,Lockowandt,3,Sat Jun 6 10:31:59 2015 UTC,I feel the same way about Jade with 4 In 4 Out. Why did they have to switch the nominations? Jade would have 100% been out if she was up.
bbuk,38qqck,Dietfuckingcoke,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:15:51 2015 UTC,Was just about to reply here to say that!
bbuk,38qqck,-randomity-,2,Sat Jun 6 19:23:43 2015 UTC,I think it will be Marc. He's going to get that affection more than Simon. Simon is just a weed.
bbuk,38qqck,ellelelle,2,Sat Jun 6 19:10:02 2015 UTC,"You're just associating twist manipulation in his favor because he's the obvious one people want out (in and out of the house). If it was a toss up between who might or might not go, you wouldn't have made this thread."
bbuk,38qqck,jyunga,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:43:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was designed on the fly to keep Simon in, purely based on the fact that it would take a bit of organisation and planning to have previous housemates lined up. And it could be a situation where people are asked to vote for certain housemates to enter the real house after a week in the lair so.. it might not be a good thing for whoever gets sent and they may be competing with fan favourites."
bbuk,38qqck,ellelelle,0,Sat Jun 6 19:29:52 2015 UTC,Timewarp sounds like it's going to be a pretty big deal. I doubt any of it was designed on the fly to keep Simon in.
bbuk,38qqck,RoloisRight,2,Sun Jun 7 22:44:30 2015 UTC,I really hope that's the case but I'm pretty sure they've done it in the past like when Hilton went into that secret room instead of being removed. Maybe I'm biased....Just want that two-faced queen to GO!
bbuk,38qqck,dunave,2,Sat Jun 6 04:40:58 2015 UTC,"I think that keeping Perez in was definitely from the production team and wanting the continued ratings/drama he brought.  However, this season's TimeWarp had definitely been the plan from the outset (think about making sure you had all the ex-HMs sorted for returning, etc.) and that it has just annoyingly coincided with Simon being hated!"
bbuk,38qqck,Smokratez,-4,Sat Jun 6 05:20:25 2015 UTC,"Good. In this house of pussies, Simon is the most alpha male. How sad is England?"
bbuk,38q1qx,nathanthenerd,4,Fri Jun 5 21:32:59 2015 UTC,I would love for the final sting in the twist to be a vote to keep one of the past-housemates from a previous series as a full-time housemate.

bbuk,38q1qx,Lockowandt,7,Sun Jun 7 03:33:35 2015 UTC,I cannot wait to see the fan base implode when the producers put Helen back in. She's been around so much that it's so obvious she's going to be one of them.

bbuk,38q1qx,Lockowandt,3,Fri Jun 5 21:45:40 2015 UTC,"With my logical head I will say Marc will be fake evicted will be joined by Helen but I cannot say who else would be willing to go back into the civilian series. Nikki probably won't, she's been in Ultimate Big Brother and came 2nd, there's no reason for her to go back in.  My fan head says I want Jade, Helen, Charley, Nikki, Gina and Toya to all be in close proximity to each other."
bbuk,38q1qx,dunave,5,Fri Jun 5 21:51:51 2015 UTC,If fucking 'Hurricane' Toya returns then I'm not sure I can watch anymore! Just a terrible human!
bbuk,38q1qx,Kigurumix,2,Sat Jun 6 07:39:48 2015 UTC,Have they actually said any of the veteran housemates will go back in the house with the fake evicted housemate?  It sounded to me like they would be in the room with the fake evictee but was itstated that they would go in?
bbuk,38q1qx,Kigurumix,3,Fri Jun 5 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"The official Channel 5 Statement regarding the event..   ""The Housemates with the most public votes will not be ejected from the House but will move in to Big Brother’s ‘Secret Lair’. The ‘evicted’ Housemate will receive another shock when they discover they will be living with some VERY familiar, legendary Housemates from Big Brother’s past. This Timebomb will kick off ‘Big Brother’s Time Warp Week’, during which Big Brother will be turning the House upside down with a succession of time travelling twists, classic tasks and a roll call of Big Brother famous faces from the past.   Together with the legendary housemates, whoever ‘leaves’ the Big Brother house on Friday will live a parallel life to their unsuspecting neighbours and will be set their own special tasks. However, their stay in the secret lair will be short lived as both the ‘evicted’ housemate and the legendary visitors will dramatically enter the main house during the LIVE Big Brother Time Warp Week launch programme on Sunday 14 June at 9pm on Channel 5. For the duration of Time Warp Week, the housemates from Big Brother’s past will live in the house with this year’s remaining housemates until the next ‘real’ eviction takes place on Friday 19 June.""   So it looks like the ex-housemates will not even be with the evicted housemate, but both the ex-housemate and the past housemates will enter as part of a Timewarp twist."

For the duration of Time Warp Week, the housemates from Big Brother’s past will live in the house with this year’s remaining housemates until the next ‘real’ eviction takes place on Friday 19 June.

bbuk,38os4f,Refuge_Of_Losers,3,Fri Jun 5 20:30:21 2015 UTC,"I think Simon wanted Marc and Danny to come in the DR with him, so he sort of forced them both into that mediator role. Because I think both of them are too nice to just be like ""figure it out yourself, jagweed."""
bbuk,38os4f,-randomity-,8,Fri Jun 5 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Marc even said himself that he wants to separate himself from Simon now. Simon whining on that he feels he's not getting any support. Every time he's done something sneaky they've patched things up with him in fairness. He's a classic sociopath."
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,5,Fri Jun 5 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell if he has any insight into what he is doing that causes drama, but he clearly feeds off it. He must have a long standing pattern of this sort of behaviour, and he hasn't been able to check himself so I'm guessing there is little opportunity for learning here. He just looks to be enabled."
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,2,Sat Jun 6 00:58:21 2015 UTC,"I get what you mean but I actually felt a bit of respect for Marc when he wanted to stand up for Simon. I don't like bandwagons or people ganging up, even if Simon deserved it. That sort of mob mentality makes me uncomfortable. That's when it veers towards bullying."
bbuk,38os4f,deathbelle,3,Sat Jun 6 00:56:48 2015 UTC,Big time. Everyone deserves to be treated with a bit of respect no matter what. I'd say Jade is glad that the negative attention has shifted onto someone else.
bbuk,38os4f,-randomity-,2,Sat Jun 6 08:46:46 2015 UTC,And Marc is equally surprised the negative attention isn't on himself lol
bbuk,38os4f,deathbelle,2,Sat Jun 6 14:33:45 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, he's def doing his best! I'd say the housemates are too scared to get into a confrontation with him, it just wouldn't be worth it. He's such a charmer as well that they just can't stay mad at him."
bbuk,38os4f,sadmep,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:52:52 2015 UTC,This will change in about a week
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,11,Sat Jun 6 22:51:53 2015 UTC,"I was really excited by Sam last week. I really thought she would bring a lot to the house.   I am quickly tiring of her schtick though. Marc is not her husband.. she didn't throw red wine at him like she claimed to Chloe, she didn't go along haplessly with Simon for nominations - and she could've stood up and said her piece instead of letting Simon take the fall. She is trying to act like everyone's best friend but really she is all about Marc and lapping up his attention.   I don't strongly dislike her, but she is not doing herself any favours in that house. I thought she would be way more likeable but I don't relate to her at all. She comes across as fake now. I think she will be up next week."
bbuk,38os4f,-randomity-,3,Sat Jun 6 01:17:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Sam is trying to make sure that she gets in with the right people and the romance is icing on the cake. I could see it as soon as they were tasking with nominations. She couldn't possibly throw anyone under the bus! She was covering her ass so she didn't become a villain. I think overall she is generally a nice person, but just a bit slimy.  Technically she didn't throw red wine at Marc the way she insinuated she did to Chloe. Apparently it was accidental lol."
bbuk,38os4f,gfygfygfy,2,Sat Jun 6 14:40:58 2015 UTC,"No, she did throw red wine at Marc by accident (or so she claims). She grabbed a glass and tossed it at him and then was kind of all, ""Didn't mean to do that, thought it was empty.""  https://youtu.be/VqzQ6MV9rhs 37 minute mark or so."
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,2,Sat Jun 6 02:55:13 2015 UTC,"That was easy to miss. I would've missed it again except I heard her say ""I thought that was an empty cup"". And then she is holding a glass of beer. Weird. Still doesn't actually act on her convictions. She is hedging her bets."
bbuk,38os4f,hoolytoledo,12,Sat Jun 6 13:47:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you guys, but I will unashamedly miss Eileen's presence in the house. She was such a unique and intrinsic individual."

bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,4,Fri Jun 5 20:10:58 2015 UTC,"The preoccupation with food in the house always makes me uncomfortable. They also thought Adjoa was greedy. The twins nearly lost their heads over eggs.  And yet they all made plenty of excuses for Jack.   Clearly it's not about the food, they just think it is."
bbuk,38os4f,BeeBeeBuckley,10,Sat Jun 6 00:55:43 2015 UTC,Simon in the DR saying that he is going to quit the show. Sounds like a flop to me.

bbuk,38os4f,BeeBeeBuckley,6,Fri Jun 5 20:28:57 2015 UTC,"Simon is starting with the classic ""I don't need to be here"" spiel. How many times have we heard this bullshit line?"
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,3,Fri Jun 5 20:18:48 2015 UTC,"Does anyone ""need"" to be there.. They all just want to be there and are chancing their arm. It's such an empty line. It's just to cater to his own ego."

bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,4,Fri Jun 5 20:22:23 2015 UTC,Nail on the head. And yet Simon himself seems to have zero insight into his own behaviour.  This is probably the biggest possible opportunity for him to see it under a microscope.. but I think he will just cling to blaming everyone and everything else.
bbuk,38os4f,BeeBeeBuckley,8,Sat Jun 6 01:05:38 2015 UTC,"I love that Jade told him, if you don't like being here, get the fuck out. In ten minutes: fake tears and false remorse."
bbuk,38os4f,-randomity-,5,Fri Jun 5 20:20:35 2015 UTC,Agreed! Probably the only words out of her mouth so far that have had any substance lol
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,3,Fri Jun 5 20:23:51 2015 UTC,"If only I believed she meant them. I think she is just loving getting to be the moral warrior and part of the group. She isn't on the outside anymore, but I think her and Sam over compensate to feel part of the gang."
bbuk,38os4f,Kigurumix,2,Sat Jun 6 01:08:51 2015 UTC,I so want him to be the loser he is and walk from the house.
bbuk,38os4f,BeeBeeBuckley,7,Fri Jun 5 20:21:12 2015 UTC,"He is so false. ""I don't care, I don't care."" Aaron was more mature than Simon, literally. This guy is an overgrown 8 year old asshole."
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,5,Fri Jun 5 20:26:24 2015 UTC,At least Aaron had some modicum of self awareness.. and better social skills.  Could still work on the ownership and responsibility.. but a lot more opportunity for him to grow. Simon is clearly set is his toxic ways.
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,2,Sat Jun 6 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"Me too. I would be angry if others did considering there was evictions coming up and they could all just nominate the unhappy person next week.. but with him, it would be a relief."

bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,2,Sat Jun 6 08:55:13 2015 UTC,"I wish he did but I don't think he will. He best chance is they put it up to a vote next week with the other evictee, but he will have tough competition."
bbuk,38os4f,deathbelle,2,Sat Jun 6 13:42:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah true, he'd probably end up getting lost in there with all the madness going on anyways. It just annoys me that Christian is still in there while characters like Kieran and Eileen are out."

bbuk,38os4f,deathbelle,2,Sat Jun 6 14:43:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah! He was so quick to jump ship, it really didn't say very much for his character! Haha lets hope Marc stays a bit longer XD"

bbuk,38os4f,Kigurumix,6,Sat Jun 6 04:09:08 2015 UTC,Simon is acting like Eileen will be going for sure.  Keeps telling Eileen he'll miss her.
bbuk,38os4f,-randomity-,6,Fri Jun 5 20:05:09 2015 UTC,What a prat
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,2,Fri Jun 5 20:12:33 2015 UTC,I also noticed that. But it seemed to go over Eileen's head? Or else she already knew he thought she would go. Maybe they had a conversation about that.
bbuk,38os4f,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Sat Jun 6 01:02:53 2015 UTC,What?????? Harry Amelia is wearing a top?
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,5,Fri Jun 5 20:30:54 2015 UTC,Last night I dreamt I married Joel. It was weird fake marriage. But we were friends.
bbuk,38os4f,SuperDramatic,8,Fri Jun 5 21:53:36 2015 UTC,DAE think Eileen is so beautiful? I actually find her stunning with some makeup on.
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,7,Fri Jun 5 22:04:23 2015 UTC,"Me too. At first I couldn't really get used to her face. It was just.. otherworldly? But as the time went by.. it actually became otherworldly in a good way, and it kind of goes with her character. She is like some glamorous fae creature not of this world. I find her aspirational actually. I'm glad I am not the only one that saw her as beautiful, though."
bbuk,38os4f,the_cucumber,2,Sat Jun 6 01:13:14 2015 UTC,I think she's very pretty without. The makeup is a bit harsh for her paleness but without it she looks very Madonna.
bbuk,38os4f,Lockowandt,2,Sat Jun 6 06:03:56 2015 UTC,"Inevitable. People think Joel is sweet so he stayed. But, you know, with Eileen gone the nominations for Simon and Marc have gone up. I think it will be Marc, Simon, Jade, Sam and Harry Amelia up next week (if it's normal nominations) I can't see anyone getting many a part from Simon and Marc but BB will never put just those two up so it will be everyone who received one or something."
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,7,Fri Jun 5 21:10:22 2015 UTC,"I actually don't think Joel is that sweet.. but it must've been close. I thought Joel would go, to be honest. I thought people would rally around Eileen.   I think Sam and Harry up next week, at a minimum. I don't even think Simon will last that long. I would be amazed."
bbuk,38os4f,Lockowandt,5,Sat Jun 6 01:11:37 2015 UTC,Danny please tell her to put some clothes on! She's only doing it for attention.
bbuk,38os4f,-randomity-,2,Fri Jun 5 20:06:54 2015 UTC,HON DANNY!!
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,4,Fri Jun 5 20:07:56 2015 UTC,"It really doesn't bother me. It's like some sort of social experiment. How often do people have to deal with that? It's really their own discomfort. Like Danny himself said.. why do men get to take their tops off. There is another side to it, we're just not used to seeing it. I like to think it wouldn't bother me... though I'm not sure I'd want to cook in front of hot oil like that. People wear aprons for a reason!"
bbuk,38os4f,Lockowandt,-1,Sat Jun 6 01:10:15 2015 UTC,It's still her trying to get camera time no matter what way you look at it. Its the same thing Cristian did week 1 and Sarah called him out of it. It's irritating because Nick and Joel are being are being perverts and she loves it. Nick and Jack sitting in a bathroom with about four other women and one of them fully naked pretending not to watch. It's disgusting.
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,3,Sat Jun 6 10:25:11 2015 UTC,"I believe it probably is camera time but she also is career minded. They all do what they do to further themselves in their own idea of careers.. like Sam randomly singing and Joel talk show politician, Marc reality tv villain of the ages with a soft side, they all actually could be classed as future tv stars. Don't think harry sees her future in day time TV ..."
bbuk,38os4f,Kigurumix,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:40:54 2015 UTC,I don't need to look at her naked breasts.
bbuk,38os4f,Lockowandt,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:08:03 2015 UTC,She thinks we all do though.
bbuk,38os4f,Lockowandt,0,Fri Jun 5 20:08:39 2015 UTC,So Joel thinks he didn't deserve to be up but Eileen does? Why? What makes him so special?
bbuk,38os4f,ellelelle,2,Fri Jun 5 21:00:11 2015 UTC,oh good catch! i didn't spot that. When was that said?
bbuk,38os4f,Lockowandt,3,Sat Jun 6 01:13:56 2015 UTC,"It was outside at night, I think he was talking to Nick but I'm not sure. Harry might have been there as well."
bbuk,38os4f,the_cucumber,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:25:41 2015 UTC,Is sam really married?? I feel terrible for her husband.
bbuk,38os4f,-randomity-,2,Sat Jun 6 06:02:08 2015 UTC,She was referring to Marc
bbuk,38os4f,the_cucumber,2,Sat Jun 6 14:45:35 2015 UTC,Ohh okay I'm glad to hear that
bbuk,38os4f,Kigurumix,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:23:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is the case, she said something about her ""husband"" the first night in the house."
bbuk,38os4f,-randomity-,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:41:49 2015 UTC,I don't think that's true? I'm pretty sure she mentioned also had a wife after Harry had said she has a wife.
bbuk,38os4f,Kigurumix,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:53:58 2015 UTC,Drag queen Simon!
bbuk,38os4f,Kigurumix,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:50:05 2015 UTC,"I hate that Marc thinks he need to be the mediator, he needs to get out of other peoples problems."
bbuk,38os4f,deathbelle,2,Fri Jun 5 20:35:45 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, why do you think that?"
bbuk,38os4f,Kigurumix,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:03:19 2015 UTC,Mostly because his way of mediating usually ends up with him telling the parties involved to be quiet or to shut up instead of letting them talk things out.
bbuk,38os4f,Smokratez,-2,Sat Jun 6 17:25:59 2015 UTC,"Simon talks back from getting abuse from Cloe. Which is standing up for himself. The whole house hates him, since he says something to a woman. What a joke. Cloe feels like she is entitled because she thought she had to protect Simon. He didn't ask for your protection. He is still able to think you are a daft cunt. Since that is what you are. Even Marc is starting to act like  beta boy. Come on GB, is this the most balls you have left?"
bbuk,38pfrr,OddFu7ure,3,Fri Jun 5 19:02:55 2015 UTC,"On the side bar click ""show my flair"" then ""edit"" beside your name. Select and save!"

bbuk,38nzli,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,4,Fri Jun 5 13:21:56 2015 UTC,Keiran n Harriet need to go back in. I think Marc would break Harriet
bbuk,38nzli,ed2rummy,4,Fri Jun 5 14:02:33 2015 UTC,I think if they kept bringing people back from this season there wouldn't be any point in evicting people so I think they will have another house or something or just kick everyone out and start again. But I doubt that would happen.
bbuk,38nzli,ed2rummy,5,Fri Jun 5 14:16:25 2015 UTC,"i wouldn't mind if the time bomb kicked both housemates out today. Joel, Eileen, Simon, Christian or Chloe need to be evicted they are extremely boring  Marc + Keiran dynamic would entertaining to watch  Harriet + Marc dynamic would be fun too. It's the impatient ones that break the quickest"
bbuk,38nzli,-randomity-,0,Fri Jun 5 14:23:00 2015 UTC,Ooooh so exciting!! I love Kieran and Harriet!
bbuk,38nzli,JuiceBusters,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:34:21 2015 UTC,Keiran and Harriet didn't need to be evicted and if Simon was only temporarily kicked out then surely they deserve to be back in for however long they can last.
bbuk,38nzli,Crystal-Abyss,2,Fri Jun 5 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"The problem is, mate - Simon was ousted out of pure luck, whereas Keiran and Harriet were evicted via the phoneline voting system, meaning the voters have all just wasted their money if Keiran and Harriet are allowed back in. Don't get me wrong though, I liked Keiran, but that actually was ""how long they could last."" Unfortunately."
bbuk,38nzli,foxtribe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:48:39 2015 UTC,"could be that the viewers get to vote someone back in, similar to BB7 where they voted people back into the second house and then 1 returned to the main house from that"
bbuk,38nzli,Crystal-Abyss,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:55:54 2015 UTC,"Could be. It'd be fairly unoriginal, but it could work. I was just thinking of Nikki and how a lot of people were apparently pissed off when she went back in, was that due to the vote you were referencing? I swear it was but I can't remember for the life of me. Eh, my memory is wank anyway"
bbuk,38nzli,foxtribe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:03:21 2015 UTC,"yeah, as far as i remember the public voted 4ish housemates back into a secret house, then the remaining housemates chose one of those to go back into the main house. don't remember the public reaction but it wouldn't surprise me if people were pissed cos they've basically wasted their money. Saying that i'd like to see some housemates go back in, i just can't think of a decent way to do it"
bbuk,38nzli,Lockowandt,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:23:04 2015 UTC,Nikki got 60% out of about twelve choices so I think majority wanted her back in. The people who didn't just wanted money out of it.
bbuk,38nzli,JuiceBusters,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:55:43 2015 UTC,We can safely assume Simon wasn't ousted by pure luck however I must have missed something with Keiran and Harriet and the voting?   I don't remember any kind of vote system (but maybe they used whatever recent ones) but I just remember Jack insisting they cannot be gone because (he believed) the rules state clearly you can only be evicted by public vote.
bbuk,38kfaa,spaceageclockwork,13,Thu Jun 4 20:13:56 2015 UTC,"Jesus fuck, can these people hop off Marc's dick. He's like the god-damn Messiah to them.   They way the house reacted to Simon you would think he poisoned their water supply, burned their crops, and delivered a plague unto the house. All he said was Chloe is boring. Jack and Joel are idiots in the way they presented it."
bbuk,38kfaa,TheFreshPrince12,5,Thu Jun 4 22:48:03 2015 UTC,They're kinda like kids who've been let loose and are running for uni' president. Cringey
bbuk,38kfaa,-randomity-,13,Thu Jun 4 23:18:17 2015 UTC,Jade almost nonexistent since Marc's arrival - something I am indebted to him for!!
bbuk,38kfaa,dunave,7,Thu Jun 4 21:18:20 2015 UTC,"Chloe is once again going for a verbal attack on Simon, and I totally understand her. He really seems like a terrible person. More crocodile tears incoming?  Edit: Yup. There's more ""tears"" on the way, guys."
bbuk,38kfaa,scratchmellotron,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:22:26 2015 UTC,He's a dick for sure but I don't think he deserved what happened in the bedroom. Chloe especially was clearly waiting for an excuse to let loose on him.
bbuk,38kfaa,Kigurumix,3,Fri Jun 5 07:21:10 2015 UTC,"Marc is out of control, he gets reprimanded from big brother and sent to bed."
bbuk,38kfaa,-randomity-,4,Thu Jun 4 20:52:08 2015 UTC,He drinks like crazy!
bbuk,38kfaa,lurkjoy,3,Thu Jun 4 20:57:11 2015 UTC,Yeah. I found that ten minute silence thing a bit weird. Trying to tell them something without words? The heck?? XD
bbuk,38kfaa,the_cucumber,6,Thu Jun 4 23:15:58 2015 UTC,"Sam puzzled me by getting into Marc's bed. Why? He did call her a 'cumbucket' and all sort of inappropriate things. If I were her, I'd be wary and keep banter to a minimum. Not cuddle and smother the guy with sweetness. Marc probably has insane charisma or something."
bbuk,38kfaa,mavmlvc,2,Fri Jun 5 01:43:44 2015 UTC,That confused me too. Did they actually kiss? Doesn't she have a boyfriend??
bbuk,38kfaa,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,6,Fri Jun 5 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"Between Aaron and Simon, the LGBT representation this season has been terrible.  I don't think I've ever cried / tantrumed in my life as much as those two do on a daily basis... so superficial and self-centered."
bbuk,38kfaa,OliverLyndon,5,Fri Jun 5 12:43:25 2015 UTC,"5 episodes in a row that Simon has ""cried"" and it was probably the hardest thing ever to get that one tear out. Harry getting her tits out again seems like it's been every episode. Wtf was going through marks head when he did that tin foil thing looked like a silver gimp."
bbuk,38kfaa,Kigurumix,6,Fri Jun 5 10:46:52 2015 UTC,Marc + tinfoil! (NSFW)
bbuk,38kfaa,deathbelle,4,Thu Jun 4 20:43:34 2015 UTC,Did anyone else see Lord Humungus from Mad Max?
bbuk,38kfaa,Refuge_Of_Losers,3,Thu Jun 4 20:50:51 2015 UTC,Simon's crying yet again.
bbuk,38kfaa,deathbelle,3,Thu Jun 4 20:36:34 2015 UTC,"Goodness gracious, great balls of tin foil"
bbuk,38kfaa,-randomity-,3,Fri Jun 5 00:17:43 2015 UTC,"Danny had three different scenes! <3  The editing on the ""here's what's going to happen in the next segment"" when it came to Simon's crying was so great. They cut it down to just Eileen saying ""We know you don't mean it."" Hilar."
bbuk,38kfaa,Kigurumix,6,Thu Jun 4 21:02:42 2015 UTC,Danny was so funny when the moth flew into the sky room. There was something very endearing about his body language when he jumped onto the sofa :-D
bbuk,38kfaa,tvwatcherguy,2,Fri Jun 5 00:21:14 2015 UTC,Think Marc is going for the Rubberbandits look lol <3
bbuk,38kfaa,-randomity-,2,Thu Jun 4 20:28:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for making the topic
bbuk,38kfaa,-randomity-,2,Thu Jun 4 20:36:02 2015 UTC,Yea Marc is growing on me. Much less embarrassing being Irish around here these days haha. Less of Jades antics and Marc getting popular!
bbuk,38l3s5,dunave,5,Thu Jun 4 22:29:37 2015 UTC,"Eileen has more support from bots, but Joel is winning by a hair in the polls. It should be close."
bbuk,38l3s5,poosmelly,6,Fri Jun 5 00:49:29 2015 UTC,Yea I noticed in BOTS that the majority of the audience wanted Eileen to stay and Joel to go!   Then again BOTS has proven to be wrong so many times! Even the crowd on the night is often very different from the overall vote. Still holding out hope that Joel can squeeze a victory!
bbuk,38l3s5,-randomity-,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:56:12 2015 UTC,"I don't watch BOTS most nights. But one night I did and Eileen had been put up for eviction, Rylan turned to the crowd and was like that is so unfair to nominate her for her age. Seemed a bit non-impartial lol"
bbuk,38l3s5,bellecasey,2,Fri Jun 5 02:58:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Rylan struggles with the impartial thing, although he does try. Emma was great because she genuinely empathized with every housemate, even the biggest jerks"
bbuk,38l3s5,-randomity-,9,Fri Jun 5 04:41:44 2015 UTC,I think Joel will go. Eileen is more entertaining plus people will support her because they might feel the age nomination is unfair.
bbuk,38l3s5,aislingiche,4,Thu Jun 4 23:11:29 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that being nominated for her age is unfair and its sad that it's been the case every nomination week. However, I wouldn't say she is more entertaining at all.  I think Joel brings a lot to the house, gets stuck in with the arguments and is also occasionally and surprisingly funny! Eileen is a bit of a bore and comforting Simon and complaining about the ageism is pretty much all she has done so far in the house.  What are your thoughts on the potential twist? There's no way a Friday Live episode will only involve a 2 person eviction!"
bbuk,38l3s5,aislingiche,6,Thu Jun 4 23:31:36 2015 UTC,"They'd have to let people know about a twist before they opened the phone lines so there can't be an eviction twist involving those two; not saying there wouldn't be something else separate from it though.    I feel like I've kind of forgotten what a normal eviction feels like :/  Sorry, forgot my prediction!  It seems incredibly close but Eileen's getting the great edit and Joel the terrible one so I think he'll go, just."
bbuk,38l3s5,bellecasey,3,Thu Jun 4 23:51:54 2015 UTC,Yea I didn't necessarily mean an eviction twist more just what they'll throw at the remaining HMs.   I do agree that Joel is getting a much harsher edit this week! Including every time  that Mark has gotten naked/slightly nude they show Joel's reaction - possibly to do with when Aaron got removed from the house.   Personally I'd rather Eileen went as Joel has much more to give in my opinion over the coming weeks!
bbuk,38l3s5,-randomity-,2,Fri Jun 5 00:19:36 2015 UTC,"I agree that Joel staying would be more interesting as he, oddly enough, seems to be the only one capable of standing up to Marc.    Mmm, interesting point about the reaction shots to Marc being naked, I hadn't thought about that..."
bbuk,38l3s5,mamashark,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:00:11 2015 UTC,"Yes! I'm glad someone else noticed. He goes against Marc so calmly and rationally without any intimidation, it's impressive. Everyone else either does it aggressively out of anger or do nothing."
bbuk,38l3s5,lukaeber,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:39:41 2015 UTC,I'd prefer Eileen to go as well. She's really irritating. But I still think they'll keep Eileen in :/   I would assume there'd be something timebomb-ish tomorrow. Going off evictions up until now. Have no clue what they could do but definitely looking forward to it!
bbuk,38l3s5,bellecasey,4,Fri Jun 5 02:55:34 2015 UTC,I'm in the US so I can't vote but I hope it is Joel that goes!
bbuk,38l3s5,Beevo,7,Fri Jun 5 00:13:32 2015 UTC,"I really, really, really hope that Eileen goes ... but it will probably be Joel.  I don't dislike Eileen at all, but I think Joel has potential to be one of the best of the season.  I find him fascinating.  Eileen is kind of one note."
bbuk,38l3s5,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Fri Jun 5 01:53:01 2015 UTC,"I really hope Eileen goes, to be honest. I just don't find her that interesting or entertaining, I'm sick of hearing her complain (even when she has a reason to, it's just tiring) and I don't think she's been as fun as everyone makes out, I just haven't seen it.   Joel is really solid in tasks and debates, and I like that he actually calmly goes against Marc with no hesitation, it's far more interesting than the people who go in too aggressively or do nothing"

bbuk,38l3s5,mavmlvc,2,Fri Jun 5 00:47:07 2015 UTC,"I hate that it has come down to these two. I think Eileen had a better edit this week, until she fawned all over Simon. That might hurt her chances. I'd like to see Joel stay, I think there is a hidden side of him that he has yet to reveal.   Either eviction is going to cause drama. If Eileen is evicted, Simon will probably put on a big crying act, that seems to be his schtick this week, since SHOWBIZ is used up. As far as twists, Big Brother can't go a Friday without one, maybe the evicted houseguest will get to give a HM some sort of power. I think the big twist next week will be that everybody is up for nomination, and it's gonna be a double. I get the impression that Big Brother really wants to thin the herd."
bbuk,38l3s5,JuiceBusters,2,Fri Jun 5 02:18:55 2015 UTC,I'm hoping the eviction will be cancelled and both can stay. This has been a real tough week for me. I'm not even going to vote because it's a lose/lose situation for me :(
bbuk,38l3s5,ed2rummy,2,Fri Jun 5 06:30:55 2015 UTC,"I like Joel a lot, if I had to choose, I'd pick Eilleen for eviction."
bbuk,38l3s5,RoloisRight,2,Fri Jun 5 12:20:52 2015 UTC,"Always one of these where both are mostly liked and you don't want either to go.   Eileen might have run her course overall. I almost feel like she's only going to lose respect or something if she keeps going.  Joel is a classic and I think has great potential and purpose straight through to the end.   I don't see any twists because they almost need one of these no-twist ""hate to see either go"" ones in between twists and shockers in order to keep them 'twists and shockers' of course."
bbuk,38ewn6,pfliegerz,5,Wed Jun 3 19:31:16 2015 UTC,That's actually sort of sad. I'd feel a bit gutted if it was as if I was never in that house! Adjoa even stays she was there much shorter period of time!
bbuk,38ewn6,aubnonymous,3,Wed Jun 3 20:13:17 2015 UTC,As far as I remember they've always replaced faces of evicted housemates with new housemates when they move in. Aaron's face was removed earlier for obvious reasons but you'll notice his spot now has Marc's face and it's probably just coincidence they replaced the twins.
bbuk,38ewn6,wiiwierdo,2,Wed Jun 3 19:35:15 2015 UTC,Aaron's photo was removed like any other ejectee.   Simon already had an image  so that leaves 2 newbies with no photo take the twins photo down and that gives everyone an image
bbuk,38ewn6,xorosetylerxo,2,Thu Jun 4 08:37:01 2015 UTC,"I point this out because why the twins? Were they picked out of a hat? Why not Adjoa, Kieran, Sarah or Harriet? I'm just curious."
bbuk,38ewn6,ThePope15,2,Thu Jun 4 15:19:00 2015 UTC,Possibly just easier to make space since they took up 2 spots IIRC.
bbuk,38ewn6,xorosetylerxo,2,Thu Jun 4 15:30:05 2015 UTC,that's what I was going to stay and technically they were the first evictees of 4 in 4 out so maybe BB plan was to take down the first 2 evictees images
bbuk,38ewn6,ellelelle,2,Thu Jun 4 15:32:32 2015 UTC,I was thinking along those lines until I realised Adjoa was still there..   Big Brother probably knows this will be spotted though!

bbuk,38f11r,rsuperq,20,Wed Jun 3 21:14:04 2015 UTC,My predictions for tonight's show: Mark says he's a prick but at least he's honest!  Nick smiles awkwardly and rubs his hair back!  Harry gets her baps out! Jack complains (while wearing a bathrobe)! Simon says showbiz! And Jade makes silly baby face!    Still can't wait! Haha
bbuk,38f11r,tvwatcherguy,11,Wed Jun 3 20:54:24 2015 UTC,5 out of 6 ain't bad! Haha
bbuk,38f11r,tvwatcherguy,8,Wed Jun 3 21:56:48 2015 UTC,"This was my favorite episode so far, it was really funny all the way though. One of my highlights of the season so far has to be Marc skipping around the house flinging the red cups all over the place in such a care free manner. It reminded me of a scene in ""One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest"""
bbuk,38f11r,deathbelle,7,Thu Jun 4 12:15:33 2015 UTC,"Has Jack not seen big brother before?   He keeps talking about 'what the old HMs will have done?' and 'If only the old HMs were still there', seriously fella get a grip and move on! They aren't coming back, they weren't your real friends, they were contestants in a gameshow and competing against you for the top prize.  All it has done is make him look immature/bitter and unable to move on...therefore more likely the public will want him to go as he is offering nothing new or of value.   People had very high hopes for Jack but he really hasn't done much that's been great for this series (other than turning down a BMW, which funnily he wouldn't even have been able to drive)"
bbuk,38f11r,dunave,8,Wed Jun 3 22:56:24 2015 UTC,Is simon going to cry every episode? It looks really fake. I thought Eileen going all out on Simon was awesome and he deserves it.  Mark took it a bit to far IMO but that just him being himself I guess.   Also I'm not sure what to think about Nick and Harry? Is it real or fake? Most likely fake.
bbuk,38f11r,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,2,Thu Jun 4 01:04:43 2015 UTC,"I felt so completely, truly and utterly violated when Eileen was doing the blind taste task. She was licking all up on those crusty bits of paper and I'm just thinking... actually I'm not even thinking. My brain is just trying to die in some sorta fashion so as to avoid having to watch that any longer.   Anyways. What I'm getting at is, I absolutely LOVED the way she called Simon out like that in tonight's show. I was like YES! That's how you stick it to him! Probably because I'm also a bitch and would react in a similar fashion lol [minus the crocodile tear hugs!]."
bbuk,38f11r,-randomity-,3,Thu Jun 4 02:20:02 2015 UTC,Yeah when she was licking the things it was really weird and made me want to turn It off but she did good saying what she felt about him.
bbuk,38f11r,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,6,Thu Jun 4 08:45:29 2015 UTC,"I can't stand Jack.  He brings nothing to the show aside from his constant whines and complaints. I wish he had taken the car and was shown the door.  In regards to Harry, I've never seen anyone on reality TV so blantantly and overtly sexual as her.  It's offputting. Maybe because, as an American, I'm not as accustomed to seeing that much nudity on a primetime show.  It just seems very transparant to me that she's trying to shock and / or play to the cameras (even moreso than Marc).  The other HG's sing her praises so maybe its just how she's edited.  Good episode overall."
bbuk,38f11r,mavmlvc,3,Thu Jun 4 14:05:45 2015 UTC,Jack's attitude sucks.
bbuk,38f11r,aubnonymous,2,Thu Jun 4 18:41:25 2015 UTC,100% agreed on all of this!
bbuk,38f11r,-randomity-,5,Thu Jun 4 19:30:40 2015 UTC,So much for the shopping task the week.  On bots Rylan reveals that they housemates that were pledges and watching the other housemates tell the others what they heard and saw which they were told they had to keep secrets.
bbuk,38f11r,RoloisRight,7,Wed Jun 3 22:50:41 2015 UTC,"I'm torn on changing my flair. Nick has been my favorite to win, but since Marc went in the house there's been a constant flow of entertaining moments. I like them both. I want a double flair."
bbuk,38f11r,-randomity-,4,Thu Jun 4 01:13:06 2015 UTC,Do it. Jump ship!! MARC all the way!
bbuk,38f11r,hoolytoledo,7,Thu Jun 4 02:20:48 2015 UTC,We'll be waiting for you on the douche canoe ;)
bbuk,38f11r,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Thu Jun 4 03:55:12 2015 UTC,Big Brother is a fraternity....whose anthem is Hail To The Chief?
bbuk,38f11r,originalnutta,4,Wed Jun 3 21:04:26 2015 UTC,Plot twist: Jack was picking his nose instead of Nick. I hope by the end of the season they will be picking each others noses.
bbuk,38f11r,TheFreshPrince12,4,Thu Jun 4 07:21:51 2015 UTC,"This was just a great episode. I was genuinely entertained throughout and found the task to be great. Honestly, if anyone other than Marc was in charge of it, the task would have been a bore; I don't even care that production favored him for it.   Rant ahead:  One thing I hated though was the pledges' reactions to Marc and Simon's diary room answers. They ask loaded questions like ""who is at the top?"" and ""who is at the bottom?"" and then flip their shit at the answers. Honestly, at this point they kind of just look for reasons to hate Simon. They only would have been pleased if he said ""Jade, Jack, and Joel to win and me to lose."" I don't understand why they're mad he said chloe couldn't win. Apparently because he likes her and is nice to her, he isn't allowed to think she is a poor contestant. He is answering in the context of what viewers like. He's right; she isn't entertaining and many viewers think an entertaining contestant should win. In the minds of the housemates, you can't be friends and then nominate them/highlight their weaknesses.  I hate this belief that contestants have that ""you're not allowed to WANT to win Big Brother."" Everyone knows you apply to Big Brother to get on tv and to win money; the experience and friend-making are your secondary reasons. For this game to end, one contestant has to send all the others out the door. Yes, this includes nominating people you like. Then again, maybe I'm accustomed to the ""play-to-win"" mentality because I'm American. But I just get tired of this ""I am REAL, everyone else is FAKE and a GAME-PLAYER"" nonsense. You're contestants on a game show, by default you are all game-players."
bbuk,38f11r,Rorkimaru,6,Thu Jun 4 02:57:50 2015 UTC,"I think being American actually does have a bit to do with it. Self assertion and competitive nature is one area where British and American cultures clash. Though you're right, they are by default game players. It's just a UK thing to try and be humble.   Although I must say, if I ever managed to get on the show a lot of my reasons would be the experience of 3 months of isolation from the world, seeing how I could cope with the madness that is the BB house and seeing how such an experience affects me as a person. I think it would be a uniquely interesting experience. Honestly, I'd probably give it a go if it were just a web show or it wasn't broadcast. Of course being on the telly every night would be fun and £150k is literally life changing money. With that I could buy a nice house and be set up for life."
bbuk,38f11r,scratchmellotron,4,Thu Jun 4 03:16:48 2015 UTC,"I think the format contributes a lot to the differences between the US and UK versions too. The US one has them literally compete to win so there's no reason to pretend otherwise. The UK one has them put on a show of personality for the public in order to win, so I can understand why they would think game-playing would make them look bad. Even though it's not necessarily true."
bbuk,38f11r,-randomity-,3,Thu Jun 4 17:50:26 2015 UTC,"I love both the UK and US version. Even though they're both Big Brother, they definitely are completely different in the way you say. The US version is cut throat competition to get to the top. You couldn't pretend you didn't want to win and act all sweet. You'd be out the first week or kept as a pawn to take the title over at the very end."
bbuk,38f11r,aubnonymous,3,Thu Jun 4 19:28:48 2015 UTC,This task is one of the best I've seen in a while. Everyone seemed like they were having fun and Marc clearly rose to the occasion to be the pledge master. Hahah
bbuk,38f11r,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Thu Jun 4 18:40:27 2015 UTC,Joel sure dropped to his knees suspiciously fast!
bbuk,38f11r,ed2rummy,2,Wed Jun 3 21:08:51 2015 UTC,BOTS ruined the Nick & Harry relationship
bbuk,38f11r,-randomity-,2,Thu Jun 4 04:32:35 2015 UTC,What happened? I didn't watch it
bbuk,38f11r,ed2rummy,3,Thu Jun 4 13:42:32 2015 UTC,"They showed her with cash on top of her vag, at first i did not believe that was her but after looking at ig that is her and i think she also has a Indian bf or something she is not telling Nick.  Well harry is a camgirl and she is not going to give up her career anytime soon."
bbuk,38f11r,-randomity-,2,Thu Jun 4 13:51:13 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I've come across that pic' alright lol. I think the Indian bf they might be speculating about is gay. If it's the one from the pic's on her Instagram holding hands and whatnot, she mentions something about his boyfriend."
bbuk,38f11r,JonathanSloanAUS,2,Thu Jun 4 19:26:22 2015 UTC,"What do you guys think of Cristian? I thought he was a bit of a stuck-up knob in the first week or so, and was taking himself way too seriously, but he's become my favorite housemate. He was hilarious in that bed with Nick and Harry."
bbuk,38f11r,-randomity-,5,Thu Jun 4 07:59:53 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda neutral on Christian. He's really closed off though, probably trying to sail to the end by keeping outta the firing line. I think he could actually be quite a decent fella but or some reason he's not putting anything out."
bbuk,38f11r,JammaWho,6,Thu Jun 4 13:44:02 2015 UTC,"I think in a way that Marc is bringing out a better, funner side to him."
bbuk,38f11r,sadmep,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"I think it brought out a different side of Christian, but not a better one.  As soon as Marc was in there, Christian became a little puppy dog following his douchebag master."
bbuk,38f11r,RoloisRight,3,Fri Jun 5 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"Now that he's dropped the bravado from the first week, he does seem like a nice, normal guy. It's too bad that nice and normal is boring in BB and doesn't get you any airtime. I don't dislike him anymore, but he's faded into the background."
bbuk,38f11r,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Thu Jun 4 14:22:37 2015 UTC,"Joel about Marc's power: It hasn't gone to Marc's head, because it was already in his head."
bbuk,38f11r,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Wed Jun 3 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"Loved Harry's comment to Marc, we're going to fail if your a prick."
bbuk,38f11r,tvwatcherguy,2,Wed Jun 3 21:05:30 2015 UTC,Harry and Nick are holding hands. Young love.
bbuk,38f11r,-randomity-,3,Wed Jun 3 21:11:03 2015 UTC,Is it real you think?
bbuk,38f11r,jennm1484,4,Wed Jun 3 21:22:39 2015 UTC,"I think he's doing it because she's a willing recipient and he knows it'll buy him some votes to be this corny, awkward guy with the beautiful girl.  I think from her point of view, any port in a storm lol.  I wonder how Jade actually feels about it. As much as I don't like it, that must be an awkward situation for her. Especially with the whole thing with Christian, getting shot down XD"
bbuk,38f11r,-randomity-,8,Wed Jun 3 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"Jade holding a knife and stabbing the table while talking about Harry to Nick yesterday was kinda great... I'm an awful human being but you can tell it makes her uncomfortable. Even though she doesn't like Nick in that way, she was definitely enjoying the attention."
bbuk,38f11r,hoolytoledo,2,Wed Jun 3 22:17:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I think with the way Harry and Nick are so cosied up she must feel a bit lost. To be fair, she is a bit of a knob, I'd run for the hills myself!   Think at this stage though, it's fair to say she's onto Danny now. See if she can get any sorta Summer lovin' from him lol"
bbuk,38f11r,tvwatcherguy,8,Thu Jun 4 02:14:56 2015 UTC,"Lmao her getting shot down from Cristian was probably the funniest thing I've seen from this season so far (#ThirstyThot), including Eileen eating her biscuit and Nick drinking champagne from the bottle."
bbuk,38f11r,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Wed Jun 3 22:01:49 2015 UTC,Ouch! Hard on poor Nick!  Haha. Tbh I think Nick is actually sincere.  He knew with Jade he didn't really have a chance.  I think maybe he's appearing a bit unwilling to make the move with harry is because he doesn't want to fall for the same trick twice.
bbuk,38f11r,the_cucumber,4,Wed Jun 3 22:02:08 2015 UTC,I think they really like each other.
bbuk,38do9h,bulnreinhart,3,Wed Jun 3 15:19:03 2015 UTC,Put a firework in one side of the room and a pile of wet blankets the other side... Which one will grab your attention?
bbuk,38do9h,deathbelle,3,Sat Jun 6 08:38:20 2015 UTC,It has become the Marc show.. this task could not have been more perfect for him.
bbuk,38do9h,ellelelle,4,Wed Jun 3 22:34:12 2015 UTC,"BB is giving him special treatment though. Not only are the housemates depicted of talking about him all day, everyday, we also seem to get his POV on everything. Even when the public didn't vote for him to have anything to do with nominations we still got his opinion on the matter, probably more than Sam's who was actually nominating. I think it's obvious he is BB's chosen one to win this year. He even has a task centred completely round him this week. It's working though, people seem to really like him."
bbuk,38do9h,Lockowandt,4,Wed Jun 3 18:25:45 2015 UTC,I don't agree with you at all. Marc is stirring the pot. He knows he won't be in that long (or assumes). He's prodding the 'nice' people and look at the reactions we are getting from them. Jack overreacting to getting nominated and trying to play off it's about Eileen. Eileen ACTING over simon nominating her. Marc's taking the spot light because he's actually doing something in there... and it's dragging out sides of the other house guests they don't want to show the public.
bbuk,38do9h,jyunga,6,Wed Jun 3 19:14:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, all that is true. I'm taking about production not Marc himself. He has nothing to do with the the way he's edited. Do you really think during a day Marc is the only person who had a conversation with Eileen about her nomination? No. Of course not they just chose to show Marc's over everyone else's.  But if you want to talk about Marc as a person, the housemates will get used to him soon and take what he says with a pinch of salt or as a joke because what else can they do? This house is good on getting over things quickly, look at how much everyone likes Jade again. Marc has done too much, too quick and will either settle down or go too far. Either way, Marc cannot completely win over the public."
bbuk,38do9h,Lockowandt,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:38:32 2015 UTC,They are overdoing it a little IMO and sometimes the producers seem to get a little infatuated with certain HMs.
bbuk,38do9h,JuiceBusters,0,Fri Jun 5 14:22:47 2015 UTC,"Well he is sorta ""reality tv famous"" so that makes sense"
bbuk,38do9h,realister,-1,Wed Jun 3 22:42:30 2015 UTC,Marcs gonna win
bbuk,38b0lo,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,13,Wed Jun 3 01:24:40 2015 UTC,I wonder if he genuinely believes he's a good actor and that he is fooling the audience as well as the house. Some real delusion right there.
bbuk,38b0lo,laurenisbitchin,8,Wed Jun 3 01:56:50 2015 UTC,My favorite part was him telling Christian he is 60 this year followed by telling everyone he is 46 and needs his sleep. He is just so fake!
bbuk,38b0lo,Nightshiftworker,2,Wed Jun 3 08:13:01 2015 UTC,I picked up on that too haha
bbuk,38b0lo,TheDmac,6,Thu Jun 4 12:06:24 2015 UTC,"I definitely prefer this version of him to Mr Showbiz. He's still awful, but not in a way that makes me want to stop watching."
bbuk,38b0lo,scratchmellotron,4,Wed Jun 3 07:48:56 2015 UTC,"I was hoping somebody would say, don't leave because we need you as a meat shield."
bbuk,38b0lo,BeeBeeBuckley,6,Wed Jun 3 03:09:50 2015 UTC,I really wonder what goes on in his head. Does he think he's a good actor? Does he think people like him?
bbuk,38b0lo,jennm1484,5,Wed Jun 3 16:25:48 2015 UTC,"Its so cringe, it's somewhat entertaining"
bbuk,38b0lo,henry82,3,Wed Jun 3 14:09:34 2015 UTC,Wait until you hear what he thinks of himself and his chance of winning. He's bloody delusional.
bbuk,38b0lo,Lockowandt,5,Wed Jun 3 18:26:40 2015 UTC,"I think he had a decent enough reason to put Eileen up. Hell everyone will be nominated, and she is just as good as any. She doesnt do much on the show and is immature for her age. But Simon played it all wrong. I'd just let the hate flow through and let her act the fool resulting in her eviction.   Sam is a snake for throwing Simon under the bus for all the nominations."
bbuk,38b0lo,originalnutta,2,Wed Jun 3 07:13:16 2015 UTC,"That's not why people are really mad though. He said before going into the house he thought it was terrible that Eileen was nominated for her age and then goes and does exactly that. He is hypocritical and as we learnt from Danielle last year it doesn't matter how you act from then on, you can never shake that off."
bbuk,38b0lo,Lockowandt,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:46:40 2015 UTC,He can nominate whomever he wants but his reasons and behaviour around it are what caused the upset. Compare the way Marc said Chloe would go vs the way Simon did. Marc said it in a way that got the housemates on side where as Simon has been telling her she's a winner then behind her back he called her lazy after she cooked dinner and cleaned up.
bbuk,38b0lo,Rorkimaru,-5,Thu Jun 4 02:55:33 2015 UTC,"Hello, the show is scripted thats his purpose in the house."
bbuk,389lty,Kigurumix,23,Tue Jun 2 20:02:32 2015 UTC,"Simon's the worst actor ever. His fake crying is out of this world, haha. No tears in sight."
bbuk,389lty,spaceageclockwork,9,Tue Jun 2 21:40:16 2015 UTC,"I'm glad they're not all trying to look honourable on camera by sympathising with it. It's blatantly fake. Nick trying to stifle a laugh, actually made me laugh more XD   Simon doesn't regret it. He'd do anything to get what he wants."
bbuk,389lty,-randomity-,3,Tue Jun 2 21:49:10 2015 UTC,He's not very convincing. That's why he didn't make it in SHOWBIZ.
bbuk,389lty,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Wed Jun 3 03:03:08 2015 UTC,"Simon's crocodile tears were getting a lot of attention, but Sam was the exact same when she pretended to cry in front of jack about nominating him for gambling issues and offloaded the blame onto Simon. Her whole demeanour changed when he left the room and her voice went back to normal, so I lost a lot of respect for her there."
bbuk,389lty,bobb77777,13,Wed Jun 3 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"Simon last night: I'm nominating Eileen 'cause she's old [not the only reason, before someone jumps down my throat].  Simon tonight: You've got to remember I'm old and might need more sleep.  Guess it's time for you to leave then too Simon!"
bbuk,389lty,-randomity-,9,Tue Jun 2 21:09:15 2015 UTC,"As he is someone who is 5 years younger than Eileen (Eileen: 51, Simon: 46) I thought his reasons for nominating her based on her age was a bit rich. Surely being 46 years of age also equates to being ""halfway through [his] life"" too."
bbuk,389lty,Limonene,4,Tue Jun 2 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"Halfway through his life would mean he'll live to 92, and if that's the case we're all screwed, we'll never hear the end of showbiz"
bbuk,389lty,Megan_Nicole7,2,Wed Jun 3 10:10:19 2015 UTC,"He told Christian he was going on 60, was that a joke?"
bbuk,389lty,the_cucumber,10,Thu Jun 4 20:20:08 2015 UTC,"Simon threatening to leave and all his crocodile tears are just pissing me off. He will play the age card to get his way, and then throw someone under the bus with the same card? He says Eileen doesn't need it but now he claims he doesn't need it. Why even bother coming in Simon? What a weed. Pity he couldn't nominate himself!"
bbuk,389lty,ellelelle,7,Tue Jun 2 21:50:26 2015 UTC,"crocodile tears   SHOWBIZ, DARLING. SHOWBIZ! What a wanker..."

bbuk,389lty,BeeBeeBuckley,9,Wed Jun 3 03:04:16 2015 UTC,"Haha classic Eileen: ""I'll take it on the chin!"" ""I'm fine I'll swallow it!"" God, my minds in the gutter!  Haha Edit: I blame Harry!  Haha"

bbuk,389lty,spaceageclockwork,7,Tue Jun 2 22:03:25 2015 UTC,I was cackling so hard when everyone continued to eat pasta while Simon was trying SO hard to squeeze out those crocodile tears.
bbuk,389lty,pomegranatechips,13,Wed Jun 3 08:03:19 2015 UTC,I'm getting so sick of Jack. He's just been complaining and whining this entire game since he gave up the car. Plus he hasn't worn proper clothing for the entire time in the house. I'm getting so sick of seeing him mope around in his bathrobe. Thank god he's out of immunity passes now.
bbuk,389lty,sandoooo,5,Wed Jun 3 00:16:07 2015 UTC,I think it is absurd that he was ever a favorite.  He has never done anything to deserve that besides being fat and a little antisocial.  He has been a whiney bitch since Day 1 and the house will be much better once he is gone.
bbuk,389lty,lukaeber,4,Wed Jun 3 05:20:36 2015 UTC,He's playing up the SJW angle. He might last a few more weeks before people catch on he's a phony.
bbuk,389lty,originalnutta,3,Wed Jun 3 07:18:22 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but you're right it's because he's fat. The housemates acted the same way on the first night, saying something like 'aww yeah he really deserves the immunities most' when they didn't even know him yet. It's rather condescending."
bbuk,389lty,scratchmellotron,4,Wed Jun 3 16:21:00 2015 UTC,"Oh Aaron.. what a half hearted ""apology"". It was banter.. He was just having fun. People get portrayed wrong.. Em.. Ok.. And he giggled through his response. He does seem nervous though."

bbuk,389lty,ellelelle,5,Tue Jun 2 22:16:36 2015 UTC,Aaron was on bots tonight so that is what they are talking about.
bbuk,389lty,ellelelle,3,Tue Jun 2 22:19:41 2015 UTC,Actually I was talking about him on BOTS..
bbuk,389lty,rsuperq,5,Tue Jun 2 23:17:28 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, so we're getting an old fashioned head to head eviction this week!"
bbuk,389lty,spaceageclockwork,3,Tue Jun 2 23:20:53 2015 UTC,I love it.
bbuk,389lty,ellelelle,3,Wed Jun 3 01:11:41 2015 UTC,Second nominations is Jack.  Looks like they forced Big Brother's hand to have 3rd nomination.
bbuk,389lty,Smokratez,3,Tue Jun 2 21:59:14 2015 UTC,Third nomination is Joel.
bbuk,389lty,Heyittiskyle,3,Tue Jun 2 22:03:47 2015 UTC,Big brother is revealing the nominators to the housemates and showing them the nominations.
bbuk,389lty,lukaeber,3,Tue Jun 2 21:14:15 2015 UTC,Well it looks like these are our final nominees since they have given phone numbers.
bbuk,389lty,sillykittenpoo,3,Tue Jun 2 21:22:01 2015 UTC,Aaron calls Showbiz attention seeking.. Em.. This is like when Nicky was on BBOTS hating Aaron..
bbuk,389lty,Heyittiskyle,3,Tue Jun 2 21:31:06 2015 UTC,Holy shit Jack. Stop being such a white knight. Grow some balls and be your own man ffs.
bbuk,389lty,spaceageclockwork,4,Tue Jun 2 21:57:37 2015 UTC,Does anybody else love bitchy Joel? It puts a great smile on my face. 😂
bbuk,389lty,-randomity-,3,Tue Jun 2 22:13:29 2015 UTC,I love Joel ... one of my favorites in the house.  Really hope he doesn't leave this week.
bbuk,389lty,ZombieDonShula,4,Wed Jun 3 09:18:27 2015 UTC,I like Joel too but really though what else has he got to give? More politician cadence and cringe dad dancing? Really nice kid and all I'd pick him to stay over others in the house but not over Eileen.
bbuk,389lty,scratchmellotron,2,Tue Jun 2 23:48:30 2015 UTC,Who brought up Jacks gambling?  I thought it was Sam.
bbuk,389lty,-randomity-,4,Wed Jun 3 05:22:09 2015 UTC,Watching this show must be more interesting for you than it is for me. Lol
bbuk,389lty,-randomity-,6,Wed Jun 3 14:13:48 2015 UTC,"The only thing Eileen seems to be doing is talking shit about other housemates in the bedroom. Well... She's also annoyingly insecure about her age (although she wants to make everyone sure about the ""fact"" that she doesn't care about age). Yes. Simon is a fucking hypocrite for nominating her, but she's been like this since the beginning. She's like a moody teenager. I hope the next one to go is her, then Simon.  Edit: I'd rather see Simon go before Eileen, but he's immune..."
bbuk,389lty,scratchmellotron,3,Tue Jun 2 21:39:28 2015 UTC,Definitely Eileen is the one who created the issue surrounding the age. She put the nail in her own coffin there. It's pretty sad. But I also think she's pretty boring and annoying.
bbuk,389lty,-randomity-,6,Tue Jun 2 22:13:15 2015 UTC,"I'm legit confused how she made it an issue?   She was nominated the first week for it, with Kieran admitting that she had never complained about being kept awake but that he worried about it. Every nomination from the others was for her age with no other explanation. When she defends herself they all get defensive and nominate her again for ""making it an issue."" What other choice does she have? She has to address the reason she is being put in danger or it will never change.  This week, Simon makes his age and sleeping an issue and it's revealed that Eileen has never made the same complaint, which is met with agreeance from the others, despite them nominating her for it repeatedly.  If the housemates agreed with you that she was boring and annoying that would be valid, but they never say that when they nominate. Over and over they just say she's old and that's not fair."
bbuk,389lty,-randomity-,2,Tue Jun 2 23:49:22 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. The only time she made it an issue was when she confronted Kieran, and I just saw it as a friendly way of making him aware that he hurt her feelings without meaning to. Then it got exaggerated by Sarah (I think) who acted like Eileen was trying to make him look bad."
bbuk,386kv3,pokemaster28,6,Tue Jun 2 05:31:00 2015 UTC,"Totally get what you are saying but thankfully all the commentary I've seen has been about sexual harassment, as opposed to gay men (one comment here excepted). Even Joel himself, to his credit, tried to frame it to Sarah as how would she feel in his position. That victim blaming was awful to watch.  I do believe a lot of homophobia lies in the fact that some straight men feel threatened by being objectified or pursued in the same way they feel free to objectify and aggressively pursue women. (A la what Marc is doing to Sam, who is clearly not there for that and has a wife). I would love to see how Marc would accept the same comments from a man.. but actually I wouldn't as that would probably get ugly and uncomfortable to watch.  You're not really that late as Aaron is on BBOTS tonight and I am hoping beyond hope that he can take ownership of what happened and hasn't been talking to the likes of Sarah and Harriet, who I think would encourage him feel justified in acting like that."

I'm more worried that he's taken the side of his delusional followers on twitter."
bbuk,386kv3,spaceageclockwork,2,Tue Jun 2 19:11:29 2015 UTC,What are the followers saying?
bbuk,386kv3,jennm1484,3,Tue Jun 2 19:23:17 2015 UTC,"He's been retweeting so much praising shit about himself since he got out (so I don't feel like going through all his tweets and responses). It's mostly tweets about how he shouldn't have been booted out, that they laughed with the rest of the housemates, how unfair it was, how they can't believe he got kicked out because of that harmless fun, that they'll never watch Big Brother again etc.  Edit: If you want to dig deeper, his twitter handle is aaron_frew (https://twitter.com/aaron_frew)."
bbuk,386kv3,spaceageclockwork,0,Tue Jun 2 19:39:31 2015 UTC,but actually I wouldn't as that would probably get ugly and uncomfortable to watch.   We're watching the same show right?  I thought that was kinda the selling point of locking a bunch of strangers up together.
bbuk,386kv3,sadmep,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:00:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry, not here for physical violence, sexual harassment or homophobia, which was what i was envisioning."
bbuk,386kv3,ellelelle,10,Fri Jun 5 21:38:44 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.   I had flashbacks to Sam pepper and knew they couldn't possibly allow him to stay. Aaron crossed a line but I do feel a sliver of sympathy for him because how easy it is to make a mistake that can change your life, if he behaved that way with the wrong person irl he'd be on the sex offenders list. I hope he has learned his lesson.   The biggest problem I have was with Sarah and her victim blaming. The next day or two some of the things she said to and about Joel were disgusting. If the situation was flipped and it was Joel who did that to one of the twins there's no chance she'd say it was Amy or Sally's fault. For that and many other reasons I'm glad she's gone."
bbuk,386kv3,sillykittenpoo,5,Tue Jun 2 09:05:49 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem I have was with Sarah and her victim blaming.    I actually started to somewhat like her (compared my first impression) up until that point. I'm glad I didn't drop my votes until the recap of the previous day. That crazy argument she got into with Joel got me voting for her (I voted for Sarah and Harriet). I love how oblivious the majority of the housemates seems to be when it comes to the fact that people watch this ""shit"". Nick is the only one in there who understands how Big Brother actually works, and how it usually pans out.  Edit: Excuse my somewhat sloppy English. It's not my native language."
bbuk,386kv3,spaceageclockwork,2,Tue Jun 2 19:02:45 2015 UTC,"This wasn't a problem of gay/straight. I really don't believe that Aaron was attracted to Joel. It was a mixture of: 1. People not seeing men as possible victims and 2. Mob mentality.   It would not have gotten that far had the others not egged him on and tried to normalize this harassment. If it were a woman being harassed, right away it would have been recognized for what it was before it got too far. When it's a man being harassed, people are much less likely to intervene or see a problem because ""men aren't victims"". Look at how Sarah responded to Joel. She is a prime example of this crazy mentality. If Joel were a woman, she wouldn't have victim blamed and people wouldn't be supporting her. It boggles my mind absolutely how she is able to stay in the house when she and Harriet were the most vicious in egging on Joel and negating his feelings of safety.   The problem isn't 'gay men who think they can change straight men', because that is really not a common thing. However, I'm sad that even though this isn't a common situation, Aaron, being not a member of the majority, will be treated as a representative for the community and people will ascribe his behavior to what it means to be 'gay'. This post should be more about women who don't see a problem with men getting sexually harassed."
bbuk,386kv3,jennm1484,2,Tue Jun 2 17:18:07 2015 UTC,"If Joel had been a woman, Sarah may well have victim blamed.. just look at any rape case commentary and tell me women aren't complicit in victim blaming other women.   I was shocked that Sarah herself wasn't able to empathise with Joel though.. surely she must have experienced similar as an attractive woman. You don't really have to do much to be accused of ""welcoming male attention"" - like being scrutinized for wearing things that encourage men to objectify you.. the same way she criticised Joel for what he wore that must somehow have enticed Aaron. Maybe she thinks she can handle that, but it's very different when you have someone invading your personal space and then you are meant to feel guilty for ""asking for it"".. Yikes.  I think the post should be more about people not seeing the same problem with men being sexually harassed though. I definitely agree there."
bbuk,386kv3,ellelelle,2,Tue Jun 2 17:51:29 2015 UTC,"If Joel had been a woman, Sarah may well have victim blamed.. just look at any rape case commentary and tell me women aren't complicit in victim blaming other women.   Totally right that people blame the victim all the time, but, I want to believe that Sarah made these comments about Joel and found it easy to blame him because she couldn't relate to him. Had it been one of the twins, I think she would have responded differently? I really truly do not want to believe Sarah is so vile that she can't see the problem with this ideology in other variations. She has, however, given some super cringe worthy comments about a variety of topics, though. So, who knows. Maybe she really is just a super asshole who refuses to see things from another's point of view."
bbuk,386kv3,jennm1484,0,Tue Jun 2 18:47:07 2015 UTC,You could be right about that.. What other cringe worthy things did she say?
bbuk,386kv3,ellelelle,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:49:36 2015 UTC,"Right in the beginning, during week 1,  she was talking to Harriet about common people and working class people in a particularly negative light. Then she went on to talk about how she hates racism, but you know, immigrants are taking all the jobs and abusing welfare. Sarah has been quite the class act all throughout. I don't know why people like(d) her at all. She's been spreading hateful/hurtful ideologies."
bbuk,386kv3,jennm1484,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:55:17 2015 UTC,"Oh my god I remember that.. and wondering if she was trying to get a rise out of Harriet but Harriet just deferred to her.  But then Harriet is a UKIP supporter so Harriet, Sarah and Joel should be best buddies."
bbuk,386kv3,ellelelle,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:59:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is some sort of unwritten understanding that's existed that yes the homosexual male gets to sexually assualt the normal male and even moreso if that male is a 'homophobe' (as he can suppose Joel was) or is just shy and conservative.   One of the good things everyone can enjoy about this is we are finally seeing true 'equality' in treatment. Aaron was treated the same as if he was 'Danny' (for sake of comparison) doing that to Jade.   If you asked me - they let that go about twice as long as they would have if it were a man-woman BUT I'm not going to complain about that because in the end they were pretty consistent and Aaron didnt get a 'gay pass'.  And credit to BB for talking to Harriet and giving her a warning. Here again - true equal treatment is starting to happen. Had the been Keiran or any other guys hooting and physically pushing and cheering wildly at a man-woman scenario they'd be severely warned as well."
bbuk,384668,Kigurumix,16,Mon Jun 1 18:54:17 2015 UTC,Nick's impression of Jade's bitchy 5 year old alter ego .. that clearly annoys him too.

bbuk,384668,BeeBeeBuckley,7,Mon Jun 1 21:36:44 2015 UTC,"Me too, such a snake.  Even if I didn't know about the #abusedbysimongross tweets, I think what he did with Eileen would have clinched it.  Don't know how Sam is saying it's not her choice though, she let Simon choose it and went along with it."
bbuk,384668,ellelelle,7,Mon Jun 1 21:42:07 2015 UTC,"I cringe at his reasons. She's older, she should've played Big Brother when she was younger. Her time has passed. I hope he gets a taste of ageism while he's in there."
bbuk,384668,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Tue Jun 2 00:21:33 2015 UTC,It is so strange he thinks he is one of the 'young ones'! Christ there's enough mirrors in there you think he'd see sense!
bbuk,384668,dunave,2,Tue Jun 2 00:59:12 2015 UTC,It must have felt like  more of a betrayal coming from him.. what a hypocrit.
bbuk,384668,ellelelle,-1,Tue Jun 2 02:59:30 2015 UTC,He also said she doesn't contribute to the house much and stays in the bedroom all the time. Which is true. Don't hate the man for being right sunshine.
bbuk,384668,Smokratez,3,Tue Jun 2 11:53:57 2015 UTC,"We don't really know if that's true and neither does Simon since he's spent a day in the house.  Obviously the other housemates thought Eileen was contributing enough to not be nominated, thus why they were upset."
bbuk,384668,ZombieDonShula,-2,Tue Jun 2 12:06:51 2015 UTC,"You got a point there I suppose. I know what I think about Eilleen though.   A lot of them get upset if anything happens to a woman, regardless of it being something to be upset about. I hope Eilleen goes. I find her fake, boring and annoying."
bbuk,384668,Smokratez,3,Tue Jun 2 12:14:01 2015 UTC,"Well, if those were his reasons, he didn't need to bring up her age. Not hating, just pointing out the fallacies of his thinking buttercup."

bbuk,384668,BeeBeeBuckley,-1,Tue Jun 2 15:53:09 2015 UTC,Christian isn't as annoying as Eileen.
bbuk,384668,Smokratez,3,Tue Jun 2 17:34:50 2015 UTC,That is arguable.. Christian is fickle and afraid to take a stand.. He holds back in the background afraid of any criticism. Just look at him becoming Marc's groupie when the night before he was Danny's backup in the Marc argument! He would fall to pieces of Marc actually called him out. He wishes he was like Marc but he is too insecure.
bbuk,384668,ellelelle,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:58:51 2015 UTC,"She cooks for them and she likes to get involved with Joel's theatrics.. I think they feel protective of her because they would miss her..

bbuk,384668,-randomity-,6,Tue Jun 2 20:57:59 2015 UTC,Ha! Simon just told Nick that the public views Nick as Jade's puppy dog.

bbuk,384668,Lockowandt,8,Mon Jun 1 21:08:34 2015 UTC,Simon sort of did that when he misrepresented public reaction to his first eviction. He said some bullshit about there being outrage over the unfairness of it.

And he thought he'd do the same, just to keep himself in everyone's favour. Sly dog. He knows exactly what he's doing. Loved him to begin with, but he really showed his true colours"
bbuk,384668,-randomity-,9,Mon Jun 1 21:34:37 2015 UTC,"All I got from this episode is that Nick & Harry are an actual interesting showmance couple. The word adorkable comes to mind when they flirt, and I actually do believe that Harry fits the description of Nick's dream girl that he probably gave to BB during auditions. I guess a romance between them would just be kinda Pretty-Woman-ish, but it's still more interesting than the usual routine played out on shows like this, IMO. I will be rather disappointed if we don't at least get some kind of ""Harry dominates Nick"" task setup at some point.  Oh, yeah, and as for The Mask nominating Eileen? It's so hypocritical that it must be his way of trying to be the center of attention, IMO. Contradicting yourself is an easy way to get people talking about you. Jade's been doing it with her entire personality since the start of the series.  Glad to see that even the BOTS puppets are saying that age is no reason to judge someone, though, because that's actually just true. Even a broken clock is right twice a day, or whatever."
bbuk,384668,Jotchee,2,Mon Jun 1 23:46:28 2015 UTC,"It's so strange because I didn't see it coming, and it seems like Nick is the one making the advances. They are a lot more believable than that Danny/Sarah farce."

bbuk,384668,Jotchee,4,Mon Jun 1 21:51:27 2015 UTC,"She can nominate him back, which she probably wouldn't have done otherwise. But I think Simon's the type to want the nominations anyway, just to have his picture up during the voting instructions bits on the show."
bbuk,384668,ZombieDonShula,2,Mon Jun 1 23:59:27 2015 UTC,Big Brother gives them opportunities to make each other look bad nearly every episode. I imagine she'll just be raking him over the coals in tasks.
bbuk,384668,ellelelle,6,Tue Jun 2 12:09:38 2015 UTC,"They showed the nominations on bots, Eileen, Jack and Joel.  Jack used his immunity pass so Eileen and Joel are nominated."

bbuk,384668,ellelelle,5,Mon Jun 1 22:31:44 2015 UTC,I doubt there will be more.    They nominated 3 and Jack saved himself.  It sounded like it was originally going to be 2 joint nominations but when they said that they would nominated Eileen and Jack and then Jack could save himself with his immunity pass and Eileen would go they had them choose a third.
bbuk,384668,Jotchee,3,Mon Jun 1 22:36:34 2015 UTC,"Quite the oversight on BB's part there, if they hadn't foreseen that."
bbuk,384668,ellelelle,3,Mon Jun 1 23:01:33 2015 UTC,They didn't have to foresee it because they see and hear everything in the house and when they said they were nominating Jack they just made them nominate 3 people to cover that.
bbuk,384668,Lockowandt,2,Mon Jun 1 23:07:08 2015 UTC,They should've made it three people originally to cover that. It looks a bit awkward to increase it to three after the fact. It didn't make sense. And there's no way to know it stopped at three. That whole thing didn't make sense.
bbuk,384668,spaceageclockwork,3,Tue Jun 2 03:02:15 2015 UTC,"Some tool on BOTS, I think Rylan himself, said that those were just the nominations, ""for now."" Plus, it makes no sense to only have two options for the paying voters, bless their hearts. :P"
bbuk,384668,Lockowandt,2,Mon Jun 1 23:55:54 2015 UTC,"you should have your own flair saying ""resident cynic"" ;)  Yeah I can't accept just two.. though whoever else goes up it will be a poisoned chalice because I think both Eileen and Joel are popular with voters."
bbuk,384668,Jotchee,6,Tue Jun 2 03:00:39 2015 UTC,"Hasn't Simon just told Eileen and Joel he is one of the nominators?  ""Eileen how do you think I felt?"" He kept saying it."
bbuk,384668,ellelelle,6,Mon Jun 1 21:46:59 2015 UTC,I think he referred to him getting evicted the first night.
bbuk,384668,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Mon Jun 1 21:57:43 2015 UTC,"Eileen didn't take it like that though, she was basically saying to him if she stays she's coming for him."
bbuk,384668,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Mon Jun 1 22:02:30 2015 UTC,I think it was just edited to seem that way so we get our hopes up that Simon could receive a punishment nomination from BB.

Big brother has a significant viewer base from older women, and she will probably get a fair bit of support from them.

bbuk,37zmlb,Kigurumix,10,Sun May 31 19:20:23 2015 UTC,If I had to wake up in the morning and the first thing I heard was showbiz I would probably shoot myself.   I thought Joel did well asking the questions but Simon is a dick for butting in during Sam's questions.  Jade doing that annoying thing when people say something about her is just stupid and makes her seem like she is five years old.  Marks a dick but at least he's truthful and doesn't beat around the bush.
bbuk,37zmlb,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,5,Mon Jun 1 01:16:00 2015 UTC,Jade's little response thing is strange but you have to admit that she is not getting an easy time like Christian.
bbuk,37zmlb,Heyittiskyle,-1,Mon Jun 1 01:29:24 2015 UTC,She's a bitch she deserves it.
bbuk,37zmlb,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:50:42 2015 UTC,"Why do you think she is a bitch?   I don't believe that she is a bitch; I like her a lot. Yes, she may be fake but I believe that people should be able to empathize with her because she posses a nature like that of a teenager. She made one mistake and the cut-throat twins, who I did like and now miss, along with everybody else ganged up on her; this resembles high school drama and shouldn't be taken so seriously."
bbuk,37zmlb,Heyittiskyle,3,Mon Jun 1 02:02:38 2015 UTC,I think she's a bitch because she will get upset about something-like Eileen saying one of her nominations was easy-which she has done herself-saying both of her nominations were easy- and then rant about how terrible Eileen was for saying that when what Jade said was twice as bad.  She complains about people behind their backs constantly.  She talks in a baby voice-nothing good ever comes of adults doing that.  She's generally mean-spirited.
bbuk,37zmlb,Bunny_ofDeath,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:50:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending her in general, but I saw her 'walk in the park' comment about nominations as a counter to Eileen saying it first."
bbuk,37zmlb,scratchmellotron,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"I think people give her a very shitty time over that, it's relatively clear that going like that is her defence mechanism"
bbuk,37zmlb,Bur_Sangjun,0,Tue Jun 2 19:03:51 2015 UTC,"I think if there's any character she can play, it's a menacing 5 year old. It's creepy and intriguing at the same time."
bbuk,37zmlb,ellelelle,10,Mon Jun 1 17:19:01 2015 UTC,I wonder will Marc even get sick of himself.
bbuk,37zmlb,ellelelle,12,Sun May 31 21:08:54 2015 UTC,"This ep made me like Harry. I think she'll turn out to be much more than just ""tits"". And why should she care if people call her a slag? It's the people who would call her that who have problems, not her. I think she's got the personality that Jade pretends to have. I'd like to hear more about her past, her being homeless and finding her way out of that situation. She's controversial, but actually genuinely interesting as well, IMO.  Nick is still my favorite, though. He sees everything, it seems. I like that he and Joel both had Marc's number immediately, maybe because they're the youngest and will remember grade school behavior the best. I think they're as savvy as Marc pretends to be, and actually likable on top of it."
bbuk,37zmlb,Jotchee,8,Sun May 31 22:50:52 2015 UTC,"Nick is coming across as very smart, which was hidden when he was just talking with Jade all day. Joel did well as the interviewer too"
bbuk,37zmlb,vivabarry,9,Sun May 31 23:58:34 2015 UTC,"Yup. I'm seeing lots of people parroting the opinion that Marc is some kind of genius for being able to figure everyone out and push their buttons, but he could have watched the show and already knew Jade. He didn't have to figure anything out at all. Any viewer could go in there and pick at their flaws and weaknesses because it's laid out for us on the show.  What's impressive is that Nick can read the others and maneuver through the house so well just by being observant and insightful. That's actual evidence of social skills and intelligence, no helping hand required."
bbuk,37zmlb,Jotchee,6,Mon Jun 1 00:17:43 2015 UTC,"I noticed this from the start; Harry has a genuinely nice character that's refreshing. By sharing her story, she really solidified my hypothesis that she is down to Earth.   I also agree that she has the personality that Jade portrays, but I feel sorry for Jade."
bbuk,37zmlb,Heyittiskyle,3,Mon Jun 1 01:33:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is clearly much more to her than what she does for a living, and she does seem genuinely comfortable with her body so more power to her. I hope the housemates take the time to get to know her as a person.   Nick is very adaptable.. I think he definitely has staying power. Him and Joel make a great power couple."
bbuk,37zmlb,ellelelle,10,Mon Jun 1 17:17:59 2015 UTC,Jade's attempt to get Marc ejected by putting on the waterworks in the diary room was priceless.
bbuk,37zmlb,SP0oONY,3,Mon Jun 1 06:57:28 2015 UTC,He must know something crazy about her. She keeps saying how he doesn't know her well but is constantly freaking out about his presence. I wasn't interested in Jade as a person before but now I'm on edge waiting for when Marc finally tells what he knows about her.
bbuk,37zmlb,jennm1484,3,Mon Jun 1 12:28:07 2015 UTC,It was pretty bizarre to watch. I think she was genuinely upset and frustrated.. but by the fact he was in there.. not the fact he flashed. I think you're right.. she just wanted desperately for him to be kicked out.
bbuk,37zmlb,ellelelle,8,Mon Jun 1 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"I detect a lot of false sincerity from Cristian. I think he is trying to find himself because, from what I've seen, he comes across as an awkward character with no personality. When he speaks, it seems like he uses a forced tone. He tries to portray himself as sensitive and intelligent, but I think he is just confused. All in all, watching him is uncomfortable."
bbuk,37zmlb,TheFreshPrince12,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:34:07 2015 UTC,"I think of all of them, he is the least prepared for celebrity and for being under the microscope. There are too many cracks in the veneer. I don't dislike him, but I think he is struggling to get by in there. He's very controlled, and I think will struggle to be genuine and open up to people because he is insecure about how that will be seen. I think that's why he had such a disastrous first week."
bbuk,37zmlb,ellelelle,8,Mon Jun 1 17:13:46 2015 UTC,Jack needs to chill out and have a drink.
bbuk,37zmlb,spaceageclockwork,7,Sun May 31 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"I have such a soft spot for Marc.  Sure he's a wanker (it's obvious to point that out), but after his discussion with Chloe, there was a light of sincerity.  He's all show, but deep down it seems he might have that sorta extra in him that isn't all too bad.  He's definitely a character in the house, and whether he's playing up for the cameras and whatnot, so far he's been a solid add to the house.  Obviously, he's there to cause chaos but a harmonious house for long can get so monotone and boring.  Simon was totally right about Big Brother not being a holiday, and that's why those tasks are there for, stirring shit up!  (Let's not forget how amazing that House of Commmons task was).   Not to mention how this year BB is making it hard for these housemates to win the shopping luxury, since they know basic rations will drive the housemates completely mad (exhibit A: Jack).    Basically what I'm saying is, the house definitely needed a spice up.  Since we lost a person most of us truly disliked, Harriet, there always needs to be that one person people need to bicker about, and that solution is Marc.  Plus, we still have Jade there, which imo is just bizzare to even analyze recently."
bbuk,37zmlb,hoolytoledo,7,Mon Jun 1 00:19:50 2015 UTC,"Marc is what the show needed if we want to see the laziest, most played out villain with a heart of not-complete-shit plot that's already been on every other reality show evar~  I keep thinking about Perez, and how he put such a uniquely compelling spin on the troll role. He should teach a fucking class on how to be the asshole on reality shows. (Speidi can be his teaching assistants.) Marc's schtick is paint-by-numbers compared to Perez's grotesque masterpiece.  I would prefer more creative tasks that force conflict amongst castmembers who are actually interesting as people. But I get why BB would find it easier to just call up Rent-A-Douche and send one in there to shit on everyone."

bbuk,37zmlb,ellelelle,4,Mon Jun 1 17:16:47 2015 UTC,Simon crying in the DR was the darkest thing I've ever seen.
bbuk,37zmlb,JonathanSloanAUS,4,Mon Jun 1 08:32:53 2015 UTC,Simon crying in the DR was the fakest thing I've ever seen.  You'd think someone so invested in Showbiz would at least learn how to decently fake cry.
bbuk,37zmlb,laurenisbitchin,2,Mon Jun 1 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"Haha, that shit was hilarious. It only got better when he asked Sam - ""I'm a good actor, right?"", when they talked about upcoming nominations in the bathroom. If you haven't already seen the clip on the official website, there's another fake cry (which is REALLY!!! over the top) from Simon in tonight's episode. #"
bbuk,37zmlb,spaceageclockwork,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:51:18 2015 UTC,That was meant to be fakest. My phone evidently autocorrected
bbuk,37zmlb,JonathanSloanAUS,2,Mon Jun 1 20:30:25 2015 UTC,Oh. I thought you actually meant dark.  This makes much more sense.

bbuk,37z1f3,drstevenguyen,8,Sun May 31 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"There are no internet or TV live feeds for BBUK (except sometimes on a Friday evening immediately after Big Brother's Bit On The Side for 1 hour).   It sucks, I know!"
bbuk,37z1f3,nathanthenerd,3,Sun May 31 17:17:51 2015 UTC,Ah damn :( Thanks anyway!
bbuk,37z1f3,floydmoon,-3,Sun May 31 17:23:15 2015 UTC,A part of me thinks is it that one of the house mates is in fact an actor and BB is advising them what to do.As there is no live feed we don't see what happens in the diary room at other times and BB could be specifying to one of the HM's exactly how to manipulate the whole house.
bbuk,37z1f3,Gingerdancergirl,2,Sun May 31 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"Even when there was a live feed,we never saw inside the diary room as part of it."

bbuk,37v2ns,tvwatcherguy,6,Sat May 30 17:31:57 2015 UTC,I was actually kinda angry when Eileen was egging him on by saying Showbiz whenever he said it when he re-entered.
bbuk,37v2ns,ellelelle,11,Sat May 30 18:22:54 2015 UTC,Desperation is not a good look on Eileen. I wish they'd sent her a better saviour.
bbuk,37v2ns,kavien,3,Sat May 30 18:41:43 2015 UTC,"I wish they'd sent her better make-up. I understand she's vampire obsessed, but even my most alabaster-skinned friends has at least some color to their face. Her deathly pallor seems more a mask than a beauty aid."
bbuk,37v2ns,ellelelle,8,Tue Jun 2 12:47:01 2015 UTC,That was my initial reaction too.. be careful what you wished for housemates D:  At least for us it's just an hour a day.
bbuk,37v2ns,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,3,Sat May 30 18:41:02 2015 UTC,I hope they put him up and he goes next week I can't listen to him say shoebox every time they have a task or do anything.

bbuk,37v2ns,TheDmac,5,Thu Jun 4 16:18:14 2015 UTC,"As per request in another thread, I put together a quick video of the times he said. I've no doubt missed some, but I wasn't going to watch the whole thing haha. Has 'showbiz' from the launch and last nights episode."
bbuk,37v2ns,ellelelle,2,Sun May 31 06:55:59 2015 UTC,Well at least we can predict now what his best bits will look like..!!
bbuk,37v2ns,chriskicks,3,Sun May 31 08:06:32 2015 UTC,i want to see another side to him. a more subdued simon who is a little more real. that showbiz front...it's only a matter of time before someone pulls him up on it and tears him down.
bbuk,37v2ns,JuiceBusters,4,Sun May 31 02:23:44 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, the last episode where Simon actually goes extended periods without shouting 'showbbizz' and starts having actual conversations - he's not unbearable!  He COULD be a great HM as everybody's uncle IF he can STFU with the worlds worst hammy stage actor thing."
bbuk,37v2ns,lukaeber,3,Mon Jun 1 07:34:27 2015 UTC,"I agree, he was tolerable for most of the episode but it really annoyed me when the first thing he said after waking up was 'showbiz'"
bbuk,37v2ns,realister,2,Mon Jun 1 08:21:04 2015 UTC,"Tolerable, but I still found him incredibly fake.  I don't believe those tears in the diary room were sincere at all."
bbuk,37v2ns,ellelelle,6,Mon Jun 1 13:11:29 2015 UTC,"Certainly they put him in on purpose, why? It's simple housemates will have to make a choice now who to nominate annoying Simon or someone they hate in the house.   Honestly BB manipulates the house every time but this year they clearly wanted certain people out and just flipped the nominations might as well drop nominations all together"
bbuk,37v2ns,realister,6,Sat May 30 17:49:58 2015 UTC,I kinda suspect that was always the point of the time bomb - it wasn't a normal eviction. Maybe whoever it was would've been brought back.

bbuk,37waqp,JuiceBusters,2,Sun May 31 13:29:24 2015 UTC,"But here's what I'm loving and fascinated by:   Just as with the launch night, most of the HMs are NOT impressed with gimmicks or 'reality show stirring characters' and they are totally aware of this 'Timebomb Exchange' thing. They (the originals) almost immediately cooperated to COUNTER and battle Big Brother's gimmick! They are actually WINNING the battle and have done a surprisingly effective job and for that matter are now recruiting OUT of the 'Shocking Shltstirrers' and a day later now seem to have Simon WITH THEM on their side.   So this is fascinating to me and I am totally refreshed by this and whats worth noting is that Jade who was previously on the 'outs' for being a 'Reality Show Character' has actually latched on and joined in with the originals as being 'Anti-Gimmick' herself!  In almost all the other past seasons (and in almost all other Big Brothers anywhere) we would have seen 'Originals' playing straight into the Shit-Stirring Gimmicks, finding 'Showmances' or trying to game themselves into the fray but this is different:              This is the Originals fighting and actually successfully countering the gimmick.   Personally, I LOVE this group of originals and what they're doing together!   In a strange way this actually goes to the most 'Purist' of BBUK beginnings where its HMs Vs Big Brother in psychological warfare as a united group and its making me happy."
bbuk,37waqp,tvwatcherguy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:45:08 2015 UTC,I really wanna see Simon get into a fight first. I wanna see how his angry side is. Then boot him.
bbuk,37waqp,ellelelle,3,Sun May 31 06:58:46 2015 UTC,"Good point, he's probably quite virulent - He's odd, he says he wants drama, and then tells Danny and Marc to stop when that drama surfaces. When he gets set off himself, it's gonna be interesting indeed."

Honestly almost all the seasons are worth a watch through at some point more or less but you definitely don't hurt yourself by watching the best first. It's not like BBUS where you should probably watch earlier seasons before watching all-stars.  There are probably people who like Celeb better than I do and can give you good recommendations on those seasons but I've never gotten that into them. I usually end up only watching about half the season's worth of episodes when it's on.  Edit: I kept changing my mind on which to exclude and decided I just couldn't leave any out of the 5-13 run, lol."

bbuk,37wpd5,TheDmac,1 point,Sun May 31 05:47:38 2015 UTC,"I think this was just asked yesterday but I will say again:  BBUK 9  Just about the most perfect BB Season you can ever find. Characters, editing, production values, tasks and they don't blow things with too many gimmicks.  BB11 is interesting because it might have had one of the greatest casts of all time BUT I don't want to recommend it for a start and its because its the C4 Final and they basically break all rules.   BB7 and BB8 are awesome.   The other thing I'd recommend is watching the Celebrity BB seasons and almost all of them great or good or crazy in some way.  I do agree things like Helen winning were just huge disappointments.   Ultimate BBUK might have been one of my all-time favourite things ever but then I feel its not good to watch that unless you've already seen many or most of the previous ones.  *but holy hell they did a GREAT GREAT JOB on Ultimate BBUK!"

The original males talking outside about beating him with kindness is what sealed it for me.  I really like the clash with Jade. It seems like he's just winding her up and she's falling right into it over and over. It was hilarious watching her 'acting' in the diary room in an effort to get him in trouble or removed from the house. I hope they both stick around for a few weeks so he can continue to make a fool of her.

bbuk,37voq8,ed2rummy,1 point,Sun May 31 10:17:26 2015 UTC,"I don't mind Harry with her Tits outs, I am quite happy seeing men can be topless but it is shameful for a women to do the same. All they are are tits"
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,8,Sun May 31 17:08:18 2015 UTC,"The edit when Simon is in the garden, Simon ""!!Showbiz!!"". Cut to Eileen who dramatically cries ""Simon!"". I actually burst out laughing.   I don't think they would'v written a better villain in this Marc guy though, wow."
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,9,Sat May 30 20:31:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This is going to be explosive.  Jade unemotionally ""comforting"" Eileen. ""I know babe, I know"". Deadpan emotionless face. Awkward.  Looks like hatred of the newbies might unite the oldies though! I want to know how Sam and Harry will fit into the mix."
bbuk,37voq8,Taylor_Kittenface,4,Sat May 30 20:09:27 2015 UTC,Jade reminded me of Frasier's wife on Cheers. Stoic and flat.
bbuk,37voq8,the_cucumber,3,Sat May 30 20:12:13 2015 UTC,"I really like Jade, she's so honest with how uncaring she is for other people. I hope she atleast puts that Irish twat in his place. Such a massive cunt ..."
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,4,Sun May 31 02:53:16 2015 UTC,Nah she seems like she's flirting with him.
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,6,Sun May 31 14:31:33 2015 UTC,Sam appears on the screen.  Chloe: OH NO!  Danny: What the fuck is that?
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,9,Sat May 30 20:20:46 2015 UTC,Poor Chloe is so forgiving.   I don't think he deserves it.
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,6,Sat May 30 20:48:42 2015 UTC,Kieran and Danny talking.  Kieran: Tonight will be interesting.  Danny: I can't wait to stir shit up.  Kieran: Maybe there will be another Time Bomb.
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,5,Sat May 30 20:04:58 2015 UTC,Kieran if only you had known :'( Bet Danny will rue those words too. Great foreshadowing!
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,3,Sat May 30 20:09:53 2015 UTC,Kieran is so level headed. I was hoping out of him and Chloe we would at least keep one of them. I'm surprised Kieran went over Danny. I was so sure he would go.
bbuk,37voq8,Jotchee,3,Sat May 30 20:25:46 2015 UTC,Me too.. but I guess it's the young girl thing. I would love to know how Kieran would've handled all this stuff. Would Kieran have been more able for this Marc guy? Would anyone be able?
bbuk,37voq8,lukaeber,3,Sat May 30 20:34:44 2015 UTC,"Danny seems to be doing fine. He just told Marc to shut up, don't pick on the girls, but pick on him instead. Danny looks like he gives zero fucks if he gets ejected."
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,2,Sat May 30 20:37:24 2015 UTC,This could be good for Danny I guess.
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,6,Sat May 30 20:41:16 2015 UTC,"Amy and Sally's eviction sending the housemates reeling. Harriet begins to cry immejiately, of course."
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,6,Sat May 30 20:08:04 2015 UTC,"Wow Marc telling Harry Amelia to dance with her tits.  Can't put my finger on it....something reminiscent of sexual harrassment. Way to start off your first night, Marc. Tread carefully, Big Brother has an itchy trigger finger."
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,2,Sat May 30 20:33:23 2015 UTC,"He likes to demean people with his humour.. can see that straight off.   Considering he made a show that didn't even make it to the public, I wonder can he actually last.. is he TOO MUCH of a villain."
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,6,Sat May 30 20:44:58 2015 UTC,"Jade playing the shoulder to Eileen's tears, who is crying because she liked the twins. Well, that's what she told Jade...maybe Eileen was crying because Jade was safe, considering their respecive nominations this week."
bbuk,37voq8,Jotchee,7,Sat May 30 20:10:11 2015 UTC,"Did Big Brother just switch on Marc in the diary room. It sounded like it started with the light-hearted male Big Brother and ended with the strict female Big Brother with the stern voice.  Marc exits the DR where Jade is posing, so so dramatically seductive.  Jade in her squeaky baby talk voice: Oh, do somebody get a warning?"
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,8,Sat May 30 20:43:54 2015 UTC,She really puts on this strange persona when threatened.. I suspect Marc has seen that before!!
bbuk,37voq8,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,7,Sat May 30 20:49:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm calling. They are way familiar....I'm mean VERY familiar. They've fucked. I'd bet money. She's talking about his penis size, it just rolls off of her tongue.  Jade to Marc: Trust me, you don't want to dip your feet in dat pool."
bbuk,37voq8,Kigurumix,7,Sat May 30 20:51:40 2015 UTC,They were both probably sold to BB by the same agency.
bbuk,37voq8,Kigurumix,4,Sat May 30 21:39:45 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I think a lot offpeople know what his penis size is since there are pictures of it all over the internet (plus, he is a stripper)."
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,6,Sun May 31 02:10:01 2015 UTC,It's very familiar.
bbuk,37voq8,Jotchee,2,Sat May 30 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"Nah I think you're right. And they obviously have a chemistry. They understand each other, and that's threatening and attractive at the same time I bet! And both are ruthless about making a name for themselves - even if they have to play the baddie or the weirdo. He also mentioned her boyfriend at one point. Maybe she cheated on a boyfriend, or has always been in relationships that were monogamous but whatever the truth of it, I'd say Marc knows it!"
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,5,Sat May 30 21:15:26 2015 UTC,Jade it's not polyamorosy.. it's polyamory.. awkward.
bbuk,37voq8,aubnonymous,8,Sat May 30 21:20:09 2015 UTC,"Marc: Look, listen love, stop. Can I ask you.. have you ever tried to act? Forget what you've done, I don't want to talk about it. Jade: Yes Marc: And have you ever watched yourself back? How bad are you at acting? Jade: I'm actually quite good. Marc: All I'm saying to you is that you're not being the person who you are.. Jade: People don't know who I am Marc: What do you think you're gonna get? Jade: I'll tell you.. I'll be honest with you. First and foremost, I'm coming on this for a self journey, for a soul journey, for a spiritual journey, and to find myself, and to find people you like me. Secondly- Marc: Polyamorous though? Jade: Do you know me? Marc: Yeah! I know of you. Yeah! Polyamorous!? Jade: Do you know what that means? Marc: How many people have you slept with? Jade: Multiple relationships at once. Marc: Are you for real? Jade: Why are you questioning my polyamorousy [sic] Marc: Because you're not polyamorous Jade: You don't know me personally. Let me give you the definition of polyamorousy [sic] for myself.. is to be a free spirit and to not be clung to one person and only have that, and to be able to experience other things with other people. That's why I'm polyamorous. Marc: So you're polyamorous Jade: Yes I am polyamorous and I have been active polyamorous and that is what I am. Marc:  So you're acting to be a polyamorous person, but you're not. Jade: You clearly don't understand Marc: Clearly. Jade: Clearly Not. Marc: OK Jade: So would you rather be in a relationship with someone and cheat on them and break their heart or would you rather let them know where they stand? Marc: Are you still going on about polyamorous?    Think Marc might have cut to the heart of the matter on that one.. and he approached this one calmly, and they ended in joking banter..  Aithníonn ciaróg ciaróg eile."
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,5,Sat May 30 20:51:14 2015 UTC,"Wow! Both of their facades dropped, it was like watching old lovers reunited. They are both in the house to advance their acting careers. Him, we knew about. But this was the first time we got even a glimpse of the real Jade. Great catch elielelle!"
bbuk,37voq8,Jotchee,5,Sat May 30 21:04:54 2015 UTC,They were both so at ease after that conversation. There was definitely a mutual understanding and acknowledgement there.
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,2,Sat May 30 21:25:18 2015 UTC,They've called a truce.
bbuk,37voq8,Jotchee,7,Sat May 30 21:36:57 2015 UTC,"It was obvious to me that polyamory was Jade's bullshit hook to get on the show when she had that conversation about wanting to be monogamous when she gets married. Polyamorous folks I've known aren't just doing it as some phase while they're young, they are just wired to be in love with multiple people at once. To end up in a monogamous marriage would be like a gay dude ending up married to a woman when he gets older.  Marc is actually worse, though. At least there's some subtlety to the way Jade gets attention by rubbing people the wrong way."
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,3,Sat May 30 21:48:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I've only met one person who identified as polyamorous but when they came out about it (late 20s), it was pretty obvious that it made sense to them as a lifestyle.. not a passing whim.   Marc is more of a bully, I think. But he definitely has Jade's number!"
bbuk,37voq8,Jotchee,2,Sat May 30 21:31:07 2015 UTC,"Marc: So you're acting to be polyamorous, but you're not."
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,6,Sat May 30 21:35:14 2015 UTC,When it got to Simon coming back in I just wanted to cut my ears off. He's such an annoying twat and should have an execution time bomb. and that mark seems like a bit of a dick.
bbuk,37voq8,Jotchee,3,Sat May 30 20:53:03 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was away from my pc.  I stickied this for the day."

bbuk,37voq8,tvwatcherguy,3,Sat May 30 20:20:16 2015 UTC,Aw poor sam feeling like a rotten egg.
bbuk,37voq8,ellelelle,3,Sat May 30 20:56:37 2015 UTC,Big Brother not missing an opportunity to sow dissension.
bbuk,37vrdz,aubnonymous,2,Sat May 30 20:24:21 2015 UTC,I don't follow.. there's a space so two will come in and one will leave?  Should there be more spaces?
bbuk,37vrdz,ellelelle,2,Sat May 30 20:42:36 2015 UTC,I included an image for reference. The new hms photos aren't up yet. Simons is not red anymore. There is an empty frame on the top left.
bbuk,37vrdz,KyouLine,1 point,Sat May 30 21:06:00 2015 UTC,The empty space was Aarons photo I believe till he was ejected..
bbuk,37vrdz,Jotchee,2,Wed Jun 3 14:01:56 2015 UTC,"Couldn't they just change the photos, though?  I hope you're right, either way. Sam's the only one who seems lively, and not in a basic asshole way, so far."
bbuk,37wwd2,PetayPan,7,Sun May 31 02:03:14 2015 UTC,I think he might just be a bit camp.
bbuk,37wwd2,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,3,Sun May 31 02:05:52 2015 UTC,"it's too early to tell with joel. we know he's a virgin, he hasn't even put his toes in the dating pool yet. he's got a lot of room for growth. from what i see though, he might look like he ticks the boxes, but i think he's just a simple guy who likes to have simple fun. dressing up in girls clothes is simple silliness."
bbuk,37wwd2,chriskicks,2,Sun May 31 11:23:07 2015 UTC,"I think he is; not purely based upon what his interests are, but because it was my initial thought about him. Plus, the way he seemed to not like the flamboyant Aaron yet would flirt with him made me think it even more."
bbuk,37wwd2,Heyittiskyle,0,Mon Jun 1 04:05:17 2015 UTC,Like most American conservative politicians.
bbuk,37tq8h,kiwi_bb_fan,5,Sat May 30 08:49:31 2015 UTC,The only way I can see some of the evicted housemates go back in is if big brother lets the new housemates in for a week or so and lets the public vote based on what they've seen if they prefer that specific new housemate or the one they replaced (ex housemate). Whoever gets the most votes will stay/go go back in and replace the new?? Just a wild prediction doubt it'll ever happen :(
bbuk,37tq8h,Frankuu,3,Sat May 30 11:50:35 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to believe it so I can live in hope that Kieran gets another shot. He was well liked, I think people would rush to have him back after a week or two of !!SHOWBIZ!!"
bbuk,37tq8h,ellelelle,4,Sat May 30 12:31:00 2015 UTC,"I could have sworn I've heard/seen somebody mention this before but, didn't they do this before?  (Bring back a hm that's been evicted by the public) and it caused war? They eventually had to return all the money to the people who texted/rang in to evict the hm.    Iv no more details I didn't see this event myself. I just remember seeing someone mention it on this sub.   So I'd imagine they'd wanna stay away from that again if true"
bbuk,37tq8h,tvwatcherguy,5,Sat May 30 09:07:02 2015 UTC,That was Nikki IIRC
bbuk,37tq8h,Bur_Sangjun,2,Sat May 30 11:16:34 2015 UTC,I think you are right.
bbuk,37tq8h,ellelelle,2,Sat May 30 12:28:28 2015 UTC,She's the only housemate to have entered a total of 3 times I think
bbuk,37tq8h,Bur_Sangjun,3,Sat May 30 12:32:36 2015 UTC,Didn't people pay money to send her back in though?
bbuk,37tq8h,Lockowandt,3,Sat May 30 12:35:34 2015 UTC,She went in People payed to evict her. She went to a bedsit and went back in. She was in the channel 4 Ultimate Big Brother
bbuk,37tq8h,Bur_Sangjun,6,Sat May 30 12:43:40 2015 UTC,"She was in, but then evicted by public vote. Every ex-housemate was then up for a public vote to re-enter. Nikki, Leah, Mikey and Grace won the paid public vote, and then housemates decided for Nikki to re-enter.  People were upset because they had paid for her to leave. In Simon's case, it was a free app vote that caused him to have a 1/5 chance of leaving. Him returning (albeit annoying) is much fairer than Nikki's case."
bbuk,37tq8h,nathanthenerd,2,Sat May 30 13:05:27 2015 UTC,"No, I'm pretty sure there was a vote to send people back in.  http://youtu.be/o3p3G4_SZ4k  That's the link to the episode and they all have voting numbers at the beginning, so she went back in fairly. People paid money.  Plus Nikki received 63% of the vote so if people were unhappy it was a minority."
bbuk,37tq8h,Lockowandt,1 point,Sat May 30 14:33:46 2015 UTC,She's great TV. Wish they'd put her in again.
bbuk,37tq8h,JonathanUnicorn,2,Sat May 30 16:40:45 2015 UTC,You could be right  - I remember something along those lines as well... oh well lets wait and see - thats half the fun of the show :-)
bbuk,37tq8h,realister,4,Sat May 30 10:24:40 2015 UTC,Black people never last in UK because nobody votes for them. You gotta be 10 time as good if you are black on BB for white girls to vote.   90% of BB voters are young school girls.
bbuk,37tq8h,JuiceBusters,2,Sat May 30 17:52:18 2015 UTC,"I think its possible the HMs will be allowed to KEEP or EXCHANGE the new HMs for the old ones.  Normally, I'd say the exit with 'Best Bits' is the end of the end confirmation however.... ....Jazz Hands also had an interview and Best Bits farewell this year so that seems to mean anything can happen again."
bbuk,37tq8h,Tyler_Owens,1 point,Sat May 30 14:35:08 2015 UTC,"Nah, they've already done their interviews and have seen their best bits. Usually when hms are put back, they were placed in a safe house for the time being.   I'm glad Harriet and Sarah left, but I enjoyed the twins and Kieran"
bbuk,37tq8h,floydmoon,6,Sat May 30 10:59:34 2015 UTC,Yeah but didnt Simon do an interview as well and did the best bits.
bbuk,37tq8h,Tyler_Owens,5,Sat May 30 11:11:25 2015 UTC,"Ha oh yeah I forgot about his 2 second long best bits clip! He wasn't evicted by the public, though."
bbuk,37tq8h,ellelelle,3,Sat May 30 11:21:08 2015 UTC,I think that's the difference.. being evicted by the public is pretty final.. unless there will be a vote to bring them back in. Maybe that could be a workaround.
bbuk,37tq8h,WickedBagel,1 point,Sat May 30 12:29:30 2015 UTC,Show Bizzzz. Who is ready?
bbuk,37tq8h,JuiceBusters,3,Sat May 30 15:31:06 2015 UTC,As we speak I'm submitting a task/gimmick for Simon and I can only tell you its going to involve these two things:   He is handcuffed (and to a belt) hence he cannot outstretch his hands. He is not allowed to say the word 'Showbizzzzz' for at least a full day. If he does they lose rations/hes nominated sorta thing.   I'm going to try and submit that to BBUK tonight asap so hopefully you will see that coming soon. We can only hope.
bbuk,37rc5c,chlod4chlod,17,Fri May 29 19:42:21 2015 UTC,Eileen is so excited to have someone over the age of 35 in there with her.
bbuk,37rc5c,Refuge_Of_Losers,5,Fri May 29 21:55:24 2015 UTC,He kept trying to shake her off haha she's not one of the cool kids
bbuk,37rc5c,the_cucumber,3,Sat May 30 04:16:56 2015 UTC,I noticed that.. it's like she was trying to cling to the last life jacket and he was not having it.
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,14,Sat May 30 10:47:30 2015 UTC,"Oh good, Harry likes to sunbathe topless. I wonder if Harry's sexual freedom is going to set Jade off. Maybe Harry's sexuality isn't 'spiritual' enough for Jade."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,6,Fri May 29 20:59:43 2015 UTC,"I like how the laddy lad guy was like ""hell no I'm not messing with Jade"" I would love to see her try to come on to him and him blow her off."
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,2,Fri May 29 21:00:35 2015 UTC,"That's the first thing I thought! Harry is obviously a model in her own right and comfortable in herself and her body. Jade will have to find a way to dislike her in order to hide the fact she will feel a bit threatened ;)  I wouldn't be surprised if she tried to demean/belittle the modelling Harry has done as ""lesser than""."
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,2,Sat May 30 10:50:56 2015 UTC,"I predict Jade will trash her, then say: ""That's just my opinion."""
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Sat May 30 11:07:11 2015 UTC,"Ha, even a gambler wouldn't bet against that."
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,12,Sat May 30 12:17:30 2015 UTC,"I take everything what I said about Kieran back.  He out of the four housemates that I was so gutted to see the most leaving.  He definitely was the glue and mediator of the group, and he's such a humble, level-headed guy.  What frustrates me the most was that he's replaced with that Chippendales tool..."
bbuk,37rc5c,hoolytoledo,5,Sat May 30 01:48:18 2015 UTC,"He was possibly too level headed for BB. Even the way he took it on the chin and shrugged it off was humble. I don't think I was ever as gutted to see someone go when I watched it before. I guess being the voice of reason gets in the way of good television.  I really think he was still finding his feet and was playing the long game. He was building good relationships with everyone there and would've been safe from nominations for a long time. If Danny and Sarah had left, that would've been good for him because viewers would've seen him in less of a wingman/mediator role.. He didn't get a chance to really let loose in there!"
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,21,Sat May 30 11:03:51 2015 UTC,Please get instantly evicted again.

bbuk,37rc5c,Zulgrath,10,Sat May 30 03:07:58 2015 UTC,Oh good!!! Danny and Marc are kicking off already! Maybe Marc called him a knob.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,19,Fri May 29 22:52:29 2015 UTC,I think even Jade could survive against Simon.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,11,Fri May 29 22:01:07 2015 UTC,Kieran and Sarah look a little disgusted with Joel's rock star look.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Fri May 29 20:28:17 2015 UTC,I wonder if they thought it was playing to cameras to protect image after all the upset with Aaron and the fact he was up for eviction? I hope Kieran didn't take the same view of Joel as Sarah did in the aftermath of Aaron leaving.
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,6,Sat May 30 11:05:45 2015 UTC,"I actually thought Joel was playing for the cameras, to come off as gay-friendly.  Those outfits were pretty campy. They may have thought that, too. But, I think Kieran is too mature to mitigate Aaron's behavior by blaming/shaming Joel. Kieran is very level-headed. Wish Danny had gone instead."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Sat May 30 11:11:39 2015 UTC,"I think there is a dance kid in him, someone that would always have played to cameras or to an audience.. but he probably realised at some point that he got more praise for being smart and mature, especially if he was a non sporty boy. He does seem like he changes in a Chameleon like way to get what he needs out of a situation.. i think that's why he reminds me of Leo in Catch Me If You Can. He has that salesman thing.. even as a 19 year old he has it. I made my friend watch BB with me last night after we got home from a night out and she was convinced he was gay but I don't think it's that simple. Actually quite an interesting character!  I really don't see what was gained by keeping Danny.. that one baffles me. I had really gotten sick of his schtick with Sarah.. I thought others would have too."
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,3,Sat May 30 12:25:05 2015 UTC,"You know who actually told Joel that he looked like Leo?  SHOWBIZ. On Launch Night. Joel disagreed, but SHOWBIZ saw a resemblance."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Sat May 30 12:32:05 2015 UTC,"No way!! Maybe a con man knows a con man when he sees one. I'd say SHOWBIZ is in a league of his own though, judging by those #abusedbysimongross tweets.  EDIT: ok showbiz probably meant just physically looked like Leo, which I actually can see too. I got a bit carried away there thinking showbiz saw the catch me if you can thing too."
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,19,Sat May 30 12:45:39 2015 UTC,"I wanted Kieran to stay, that sucks."

bbuk,37rc5c,ecctv,5,Fri May 29 21:06:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Brummie (Birmingham) accent can be very irritating at times but he was a cool guy, I don't know why anyone would spend money to evict him over someone like Sarah."
bbuk,37rc5c,OliverLyndon,7,Fri May 29 21:13:46 2015 UTC,Not even the accent but how high pitched it is! But yeah I have no clue why people wanted him out.
bbuk,37rc5c,ecctv,7,Fri May 29 21:14:37 2015 UTC,"All the evicted girls just bitching it up about Harry Amelia, they don't think she will stir the pot like she says in her VT. Funny, they said the same thing in their VTs."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,16,Fri May 29 22:48:16 2015 UTC,Oh wow Sarah. That was not smart.
bbuk,37rc5c,Kiel297,12,Fri May 29 20:30:10 2015 UTC,Clearly dressing like that he was asking for it /s
bbuk,37rc5c,Bur_Sangjun,5,Fri May 29 21:41:58 2015 UTC,"He tried to say imagine if a guy did what Aaron did to her. Well Sarah imagine if that happened and then you got victim blamed for it too! Poor Joel! But almost funny to see a guy go through it, in a tragic way."
bbuk,37rc5c,the_cucumber,2,Sat May 30 04:19:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say it was an eye opener for a lot of guys watching, and probably even for Joel himself. Nick was clearly rattled by it too.   I actually have a theory that the root of much homophobia is the fact that men struggle with the idea of being sexually intimidated by another man. They are not used to experiencing that with women, and a man is more threatening, in a physical sense but also because they are more likely to be forthright and approach them directly. Men are not used to being objectified and/or harassed like women are, though I know it does happen."
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,2,Sat May 30 11:20:37 2015 UTC,It really shocked me how plainly all the victim blaming that happens in rape / sexual assault cases got flung right at Joel.. like word for word almost. You brought it on yourself. Your clothing. You liked it. You wanted it.
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,2,Sat May 30 11:13:00 2015 UTC,"People don't sex check scenarios. Play out all 4 sexual scenarios in your head, if any of them make you uncomfortable, it's wrong."
bbuk,37rc5c,Bur_Sangjun,12,Sat May 30 11:15:13 2015 UTC,"I can't even believe that she just did that. Joel, as always, handling himself ever maturely."
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,3,Fri May 29 20:30:53 2015 UTC,I was very impressed that he would stand up for himself firmly and not be intimidated by Sarah who was clearly riled.
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,9,Sat May 30 11:10:05 2015 UTC,"Joel gets a lot of undeserved shit, people seem to forget that he's 19"
bbuk,37rc5c,Kiel297,7,Fri May 29 20:33:54 2015 UTC,It's unbelievable to me. At least from where I sit he's done nothing to warrant the scrutiny the housemates have him under. I'm just not seeing it!
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,9,Fri May 29 20:36:22 2015 UTC,"I thought Nick handled that situation well considering how rude Sarah was to him. It was also nice to see him show some backbone, and stand up for himself."
bbuk,37rc5c,ScottW51,2,Fri May 29 20:36:24 2015 UTC,I was impressed with Nick too. He just wasn't having any of it.
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,6,Sat May 30 11:11:06 2015 UTC,Next out will be Harriet and then Kieran according the polls.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,4,Fri May 29 20:46:10 2015 UTC,I wonder if things will change with how bitchy Sarah was just a little bit ago. Getting in some last minute votes.
bbuk,37rc5c,ecctv,5,Fri May 29 20:49:15 2015 UTC,If she's going she will be either 3rd or 4th out tonight.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,7,Fri May 29 20:49:50 2015 UTC,"Nick ""she's absolutely stunning"""
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,7,Fri May 29 21:02:23 2015 UTC,Haha classic nick!  1 ticket to the friend zone please!
bbuk,37rc5c,tvwatcherguy,7,Sat May 30 00:04:33 2015 UTC,Danny's gonna lose both of his best friends.
bbuk,37rc5c,Refuge_Of_Losers,17,Fri May 29 21:04:47 2015 UTC,There is a friggen petition to get Aaron back in the house and Aaron retweeted it!! Ugh. People don't get how inappropriate he was.  This IG comment made me so mad. http://i.imgur.com/1rRN6D4.png
bbuk,37rc5c,ecctv,12,Fri May 29 20:15:14 2015 UTC,"That tweeter is delusional. She'd probably be the first to condemn a naked, drunk, straight guy jumping on a resistant woman's back while making suggestive remarks."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,6,Fri May 29 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"Of all the words to emphasize, she chose to emphasize the least important and least impactful word. Smh"
bbuk,37rc5c,Out_of_Chicken,3,Fri May 29 20:48:01 2015 UTC,*chose to emphasize THE least important...  FTFY /s
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Fri May 29 20:56:48 2015 UTC,Can't tell if grammar nazi or trying to emphasize unimportant word
bbuk,37rc5c,the_cucumber,9,Sat May 30 04:20:53 2015 UTC,It happened to Chloe in CBB as well and she was voted out really quickly after it happened. I have a feeling Joel will be gone soon and it will be because of the typical victim blaming public.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,12,Fri May 29 20:19:22 2015 UTC,Kieran's eviction is the first in BB history where it's actually upset me. :(
bbuk,37rc5c,BoboTheGoatHobo,6,Fri May 29 21:14:47 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sad he's gone as well.
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,2,Fri May 29 21:16:16 2015 UTC,I hope we don't lose Chloe and Kieran tonight.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Fri May 29 21:17:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was really hoping that Kieran and Chloe would survive."
bbuk,37rc5c,SP0oONY,2,Sat May 30 06:24:38 2015 UTC,not surprising judging by the fact that the vast majority of voters in UK are young white girls (something like 80%). So any black contestant has to work extra hard to stay. Just not enough votes in or out. So in a situation like this its always out.
bbuk,37rc5c,realister,14,Sat May 30 19:18:03 2015 UTC,Tonight has been such carnage... Loved it!
bbuk,37rc5c,rsuperq,6,Fri May 29 21:56:04 2015 UTC,Thank God for that. I absolutely hated the twins
bbuk,37rc5c,Kiel297,5,Fri May 29 20:43:28 2015 UTC,"Simon and Marc promise to deliver hard truths, call knobs knobs, and kick some ass, and push Jade into the grave she has dug for herself. Marc predicts he will fit in like a 9 inch willy in a vagina 2 inches deep. Um...ok."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,6,Fri May 29 22:41:01 2015 UTC,"I predict Marc makes me feel uncomfortable 99% of the time, all the time."
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,7,Sat May 30 11:37:28 2015 UTC,I'd have rather the public voted who to send back into the house because then we would get to see Adjoa return.
bbuk,37rc5c,TheFreshPrince12,2,Sat May 30 06:04:40 2015 UTC,"you know they did it on purpose, they need someone to get the votes so they can manipulate the show better, its not like they need him but it helps."
bbuk,37rc5c,realister,11,Sat May 30 08:59:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Joel, don't put words into Sarah's mouth. She's doing a fine job on her own."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Sat May 30 19:06:54 2015 UTC,ha!
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,4,Fri May 29 20:31:17 2015 UTC,Wow Sarah is still getting a mixed response.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,5,Sat May 30 11:37:41 2015 UTC,Oh Good. Save the best part for later. Don't tell them there are four evictions.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Fri May 29 20:40:54 2015 UTC,There's my answer. :D
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,6,Fri May 29 20:41:32 2015 UTC,This is horrible to the new housemates.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,7,Fri May 29 20:42:00 2015 UTC,It is sad that Kieran and Harriet didn't get proper exits.
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,5,Fri May 29 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"OK, so new girl's name is Harry Amelia."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Fri May 29 21:06:58 2015 UTC,Lots of sex talk from Emma tonight.
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,6,Fri May 29 21:23:04 2015 UTC,"Oh no, they are gonna have Sam announce the eviction."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,8,Fri May 29 21:32:42 2015 UTC,I thought she was going to have to pick who to evict which would have been more awkward.
bbuk,37rc5c,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,4,Fri May 29 21:35:54 2015 UTC,"Me too, I was nervous for her. She seems nice and they would tear her apart for that."
bbuk,37rc5c,the_cucumber,3,Fri May 29 21:38:39 2015 UTC,Same! I really liked her from her VT but that would've been a death knell for her in there.. even as it is I think she got the most insincere half hug off Sarah when she tried to commiserate with her. Awkward.
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,6,Sat May 30 04:25:48 2015 UTC,Rylan is going to have to rearrange his entire wall.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,10,Sat May 30 11:35:51 2015 UTC,Harriet's getting a warning everyone! Now you can put your pitchforks away for BB.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,8,Fri May 29 22:36:28 2015 UTC,"Twist seems a bit shit, new house mates seem like absolute gimmers but i'll give them a chance. If that showbiz prick comes back from the first episode i'm done though."
bbuk,37rc5c,Hellwemade,11,Fri May 29 20:15:56 2015 UTC,Looks like your done then lol
bbuk,37rc5c,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,8,Fri May 29 21:41:29 2015 UTC,For fucks sake why would you do this he's such an annoying prick.
bbuk,37rc5c,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,11,Fri May 29 21:55:17 2015 UTC,I am seriously considering not watching the series anymore. They've took a bunch of the most entertaining housemates out and put Simon back in...literally anyone else would've been better.  This twist was disappointing...
bbuk,37rc5c,MABGB,8,Fri May 29 21:53:54 2015 UTC,"I'm most disappointed that Simon went back in. It kind of diminishes the game since he was evicted instantly. I thought Big Brother had balls.  I'm willing to give Simon a chance to show another side of himself. But ""showbiz"" was well worn by the time he got up the steps on Launch Night. He's gonna have to come up with more than that."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,8,Fri May 29 21:56:01 2015 UTC,Bye bye Harriet. I hope.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Fri May 29 22:27:19 2015 UTC,Look at Jack! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,4,Fri May 29 20:01:18 2015 UTC,Why are they being booed so much?
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,4,Fri May 29 20:39:55 2015 UTC,Now we get to watch Chloe have a melt down.
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,4,Fri May 29 20:43:26 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a sad eviction for Harriet."
bbuk,37rc5c,ecctv,7,Fri May 29 21:00:17 2015 UTC,I was looking forward to the crowd booing her. :(
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Fri May 29 21:02:52 2015 UTC,Yeah she dodged that.. I'd say that would've really shaken her.
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,2,Fri May 29 21:07:59 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, the polls were actually right! But the polls predicted Danny to be fourth out so I don't know between Sarah and Chloe."
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,5,Sat May 30 11:47:47 2015 UTC,So one more out and two more in?
bbuk,37rc5c,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,3,Fri May 29 21:04:41 2015 UTC,"yes, that is the plan."
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,4,Fri May 29 21:19:37 2015 UTC,Sarah and Dannny look very grim.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Fri May 29 21:25:17 2015 UTC,YES. Now the house is truly gonna be shaken up!
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,5,Fri May 29 21:34:37 2015 UTC,That was awful! But Sam can probably get over it.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,10,Fri May 29 21:36:05 2015 UTC,Sarah is bitter. I'm glad that she and Harriet got booted! It gives the house a chance to move past Aaron's dismissal. Kind of wipes the slate a bit cleaner.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Fri May 29 21:36:52 2015 UTC,"I had warmed to Sarah but the minute she went off on Joel, I kind of thought all bets are off. And she didn't take it well. Neither did Harriet really. I'm not even surprised."
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,3,Fri May 29 22:35:12 2015 UTC,"I liked Joel's response to her. She obviously didn't. How can you argue with, 'how would you feel if it was happening to you'? Funny how Sarah quickly ran away from that argument. Not sorry to see her go."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Sat May 30 10:52:20 2015 UTC,"yea she knew she lost the argument right there and all she could say after that was to repeat ""dont put words into my mouth"" hahah ha its always funny when confident but not intelligent people get put into place"
bbuk,37rc5c,realister,7,Sat May 30 11:05:27 2015 UTC,Is Jack misunderstanding Big Brother's instructions? Why is he admitting that he has hinted to the HMs that anything could happen? Doofus!
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,6,Sat May 30 19:12:49 2015 UTC,Her name is HARRY?
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,5,Fri May 29 20:34:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe short for Harriet?"
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,6,Fri May 29 20:56:05 2015 UTC,"She said her name was Harry Amelia, I think that's her first name."
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,8,Fri May 29 20:57:44 2015 UTC,Harriet crying....gaaaaah...
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,6,Fri May 29 20:58:14 2015 UTC,Danny is like the Sam Tarley of this house.
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,6,Fri May 29 20:59:48 2015 UTC,He is so going as soon as he's up.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,2,Fri May 29 21:44:08 2015 UTC,"Rebeca ain't looking so bad now, eh? ;)"
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Fri May 29 21:55:05 2015 UTC,Fucking Absolutely!
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,6,Fri May 29 22:01:00 2015 UTC,Who bets everyone will be booed going in and out tonight?  EDIT: Everyone a part from Chloe was booed! Ha! This crowd is unbelievable!
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,7,Fri May 29 22:02:55 2015 UTC,"Jack keeps wearing the same thing, that shirt and that hat..."
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,4,Fri May 29 20:00:29 2015 UTC,At least he isn't wearing his dressing gown.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Fri May 29 20:23:37 2015 UTC,Spoke too soon haha.
bbuk,37rc5c,ecctv,7,Fri May 29 20:25:44 2015 UTC,"Dumbest argument ever, Sarah. Bye, bye..."
bbuk,37rc5c,spaceageclockwork,7,Fri May 29 20:32:42 2015 UTC,SARAH UGH
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,4,Fri May 29 20:29:10 2015 UTC,This is like watching someone get killed in front of you.
bbuk,37rc5c,Refuge_Of_Losers,5,Fri May 29 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"""YEAH YOU'RE BACK... oh.""  my sides"
bbuk,37rc5c,OliverLyndon,5,Fri May 29 21:01:21 2015 UTC,<333333333 Danny.  Keep staying boring <3.
bbuk,37rc5c,Refuge_Of_Losers,3,Fri May 29 21:01:28 2015 UTC,"No freezing? It will be close between Sarah, Danny and Chloe. BB was very clever putting that bit between Sarah and Joel literally a few minutes before the vote closed. Now Sarah might have a chance to stay."
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,6,Fri May 29 21:03:43 2015 UTC,I think that's what sent her out actually.
bbuk,37rc5c,the_cucumber,3,Fri May 29 20:34:29 2015 UTC,Here we go!!
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,3,Sat May 30 04:24:05 2015 UTC,Yes!! Shock the hell out of them.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Fri May 29 20:38:12 2015 UTC,"Ok I couldn't hear completely I did hear Emma say ""the first to be evicted"" but did they actually say there were going to be four evictions?"
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,4,Fri May 29 20:39:53 2015 UTC,She said third.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,4,Fri May 29 20:41:41 2015 UTC,I  misheard with all the hullaballoo. thanks!
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,3,Fri May 29 20:42:18 2015 UTC,I don't think they said how many to the HMs.
bbuk,37rc5c,ecctv,3,Fri May 29 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"She said third, since this is the third eviction of the season."
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,2,Fri May 29 20:42:17 2015 UTC,NO! HAHAHAHA!
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Fri May 29 20:43:14 2015 UTC,Harriet's out!
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,3,Fri May 29 20:42:15 2015 UTC,"I'm so confused...  BB said to Danny, Sarah and Chloe that time was on their side and that they were safe but someone is still coming out. Is it Chloe vs Sarah? Is Danny actually safe or did they run out of time to do Sarah and Chloe as well?"
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,3,Fri May 29 21:00:55 2015 UTC,"It was planned this way, because they had only introduced two of the new housemates.  As for time being on their side, it may have just be for that moment in time/time bomb event."
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,3,Fri May 29 21:20:02 2015 UTC,He didn't say they were safe. He said time was on their side.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Fri May 29 21:23:42 2015 UTC,"Sarah is out, at least she gets to say a proper goodbye."
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,3,Fri May 29 21:25:06 2015 UTC,"Ok. Now, who's the familiar face we're gonna see go in???"
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,6,Fri May 29 21:36:16 2015 UTC,I bet it's going to be disappointing like every time someone from BB4 steps out of Rylan's time bomb thing in BOTS.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,3,Fri May 29 21:38:11 2015 UTC,It was :(
bbuk,37rc5c,the_cucumber,3,Fri May 29 21:40:17 2015 UTC,"Before she knew she was being evicted, Sarah told Danny that she didn't want Marc sleeping in Kieran's bed, but he could sleep in Aaron's. Meanwhile, Marc was talking to Harry Amelia and Chloe and says the house smells like cock. Is everything going to be a penis reference from this guy?"
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Sat May 30 04:26:59 2015 UTC,"I feel uncomfortable even looking at him, never mind listening to him. I actually feel like I need to take a shower to cleanse myself now."
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,2,Fri May 29 23:12:58 2015 UTC,"He does come off a little smarmy. And what a snazzy suit he is wearing. What is the point of walking into the house, looking all respectable and fresh...and then start talking about the way cock smells? I dunno, seems a bit contrived."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Sat May 30 12:00:32 2015 UTC,"He should've gone on Geordie Shore instead, seriously."
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,2,Sat May 30 12:10:30 2015 UTC,does he even have a neck?
bbuk,37rc5c,realister,4,Sat May 30 12:13:03 2015 UTC,Joel to Sarah: How would you feel if a bloke did that to you?  Sarah: A bloke wouldn't do that to me. I would make it absolutley clear that I wouldn't tolerate it.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Sat May 30 19:08:20 2015 UTC,Where the hell did they find those housemates? Urggh
bbuk,37rc5c,SuperDramatic,8,Fri May 29 20:29:43 2015 UTC,Craigslist personals?
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Fri May 29 20:59:12 2015 UTC,"Good god, it's going to be Showbiz!"
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,7,Fri May 29 21:00:23 2015 UTC,I'm so completely and utterly disappointed and annoyed.
bbuk,37rc5c,Kiel297,6,Fri May 29 21:52:20 2015 UTC,"me too, the crowd is booing"
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,6,Fri May 29 21:52:56 2015 UTC,OH GOD I ALREADY HATE/LOVE HIM AGAIN!
bbuk,37rc5c,Refuge_Of_Losers,6,Fri May 29 21:54:51 2015 UTC,I'm just excited for every task and eviction to be marred by screams of SHOWBIIIIIIIIZZZZ
bbuk,37rc5c,Refuge_Of_Losers,4,Fri May 29 21:52:51 2015 UTC,I don't feel excitement.. I feel a vague dread.
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,5,Fri May 29 21:59:44 2015 UTC,No.
bbuk,37rc5c,the_cucumber,4,Sat May 30 11:38:03 2015 UTC,I'm so ready! This Armeggedon doc that's showing on channel 5 right now is so fucking extra right now.
bbuk,37rc5c,bbukvynse,4,Sat May 30 04:17:59 2015 UTC,Feel the hype!
bbuk,37rc5c,spaceageclockwork,4,Fri May 29 19:44:40 2015 UTC,Do they still not know they are up for eviction?  Will they just have to have other housemates pack up after the evictions?
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,2,Fri May 29 19:56:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they'll be packing all night. And unpacking for the new HMs."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Fri May 29 20:06:13 2015 UTC,Apparently not but Amy and Sally looked more nervous than Joel.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,4,Fri May 29 20:07:28 2015 UTC,"They better get a move on, this 4 out 4 in is going to take some time, especially if they plan on interviewing all the evictees."
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,4,Fri May 29 20:08:04 2015 UTC,"Oh good, Harriet is going to get a warning!"
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,3,Fri May 29 20:14:47 2015 UTC,Jack needs to just keep his mouth shut or he is going to get the boot.
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,5,Fri May 29 20:15:23 2015 UTC,I don't see him lasting much longer than his get out of jail free cards will allow him to. Big Brother knows exactly how to push his buttons and turn him into annoying flustered Jack.
bbuk,37rc5c,Kiel297,5,Fri May 29 20:16:36 2015 UTC,"It's one of my favorite things so far about this series. what can I say, I love schadenfreude ;)"
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,3,Fri May 29 20:18:29 2015 UTC,"I do think it's silly to waste time on Jack struggling with the burden when he obviously hasn't been kicked out as he's sat on those couches for the eviction. Unless, of course, they kick him out with everyone else tonight."
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,5,Fri May 29 20:20:02 2015 UTC,If they were going to do it I would imagine they would make it a surprise for viewings.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,3,Fri May 29 20:24:09 2015 UTC,Can't lie. That would be epic!
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Fri May 29 20:25:09 2015 UTC,Jesus Christ Jack stop talking.
bbuk,37rc5c,Kiel297,4,Fri May 29 20:27:28 2015 UTC,Jack was so trying to get Harriet and Chloe to ask him what is going on 'in his head'.
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,2,Fri May 29 20:26:38 2015 UTC,Why are these people always sharing baths?
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,7,Fri May 29 20:27:25 2015 UTC,I know!  And it is always the guys together in the bath.
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,3,Fri May 29 20:31:12 2015 UTC,So not liking the new guy.

bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,4,Fri May 29 21:36:41 2015 UTC,Are you serious right now Sarah and Harriet...
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,2,Fri May 29 21:39:47 2015 UTC,"I think Harriet, Danny, Sarah, and Jack contributed to Aaron's behavior. Joel was the only one that told Aaron to stop."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,10,Fri May 29 20:10:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that Danny, Sarah and Jack did much a part from laugh. They probably thought it was okay because Joel was laughing + they were all really drunk."
bbuk,37rc5c,Lockowandt,5,Fri May 29 20:10:11 2015 UTC,I heard Jack encouraging Aaron. I forgot to mention that Nick was also a laughing bystander.
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Fri May 29 20:13:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after Aaron's exit I would've preferred Big Brother had debriefed all of them while they were on the couch. It would've been better explain to explain that Big Brother had no option after what was caught on camera (to ease some tension for Joel) and that it was unfortunate that the situation was encouraged by housemates who were watching it happen.. and then they should've called out Harriet right there as the prime example. I would've loved to see her indignant face while being called out in front of everyone. At least they did it in the diary room though, and it is over now that Sarah and Harriet aren't there to drag it out. The others clearly understood the gravity of it after the fact, especially Nick and Jack."
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,2,Fri May 29 20:16:14 2015 UTC,"I think Big Brother overlooked Harriet's behavior, until some objective observers in positions of power decided, uh wtf is that chick doing? Pushing a naked guy into the other guy? Not to mention the fan outrage. Funny how that incident seems so long ago after last night's live show."
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Sat May 30 12:06:14 2015 UTC,It actually does.. and it will probably be quickly forgotten about now that there is so much other stuff going on.. !!SHOWBIZ!!
bbuk,37rc5c,ellelelle,2,Sat May 30 12:14:43 2015 UTC,Please don't say that word....it's too early to start drinking. :)
bbuk,37rc5c,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Sat May 30 12:16:26 2015 UTC,I sincerely hope that Sarah gets booted so maybe Danny can do something else in the house. I have a feeling if Sarah stays they'll just stay glued to each other since they've lost their pals at this point.
bbuk,37rc5c,aubnonymous,4,Sat May 30 12:27:54 2015 UTC,"Just a quick help call, I'm going to be away for just under a week starting tomorrow, is there anyone who would be willing to take care of the sub for that time? Just reply under here if you're willing, thanks."

bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,4,Fri May 29 20:19:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the quick reply! Would you be able to post the discussion thread daily and update the sidebar?
bbuk,37rc5c,Kigurumix,2,Fri May 29 20:21:27 2015 UTC,The nominations on the sidebar?  The discussion thread is no problem.
bbuk,37rywr,tvwatcherguy,10,Fri May 29 22:23:48 2015 UTC,Rylan just said that Marc and Danny are already kicking off!
bbuk,37rywr,ecctv,9,Fri May 29 22:52:36 2015 UTC,"I never watched tallafornia but I really cringed the minute I saw Marc. Him and Jade.. They must be distantly related. I don't think they could pick two worse people to represent us!  I want to know more about how Jade and Marc know each other.. they obviously know each other personally and have a strong dislike for each other.   Marc is really scathing about jade here.  He didn't look happy to see Simon either, which I thougth was strange. Maybe he didn't like that the return of !!Showbiz!! was about to overshadow them?"
bbuk,37rywr,ellelelle,5,Sat May 30 02:46:47 2015 UTC,"Yes I noticed that face myself.  Both him and Jack had absolutely filthy faces on them. The thing with Simon for me is he better cut that ""showbiz"" crap down and quickly!   I think jack was maybe a bit pissed off because he's lost good friends tonight yet Simons getting another chance.  Mark had that face on him because he obviously had watched the first episode and already formed an opinion about him. Mark is not going to be subtle about how/what he likes and doesn't.    Excellent move by bb!  Maybe sad to see Kiran go. But they've effectively taking out the 'mammy and daddy' of the house and replaced them with a couple of stranger danger, alcoholic, meth and crack heads (figurative) that are gonna destroy the place. Fun to watch :)"
bbuk,37rywr,ellelelle,5,Sat May 30 08:23:37 2015 UTC,"I think unfortunately with Simon he's had the time outside to see how his persona and catchphrase was received, and it has only encouraged it. I wish I'd actually counted how many times he said it in his first five minutes........   Not going to lie, I was actually gutted over Kieran but I knew he was going the minute Danny was saved. And then Kieran was in my dreams last night so in Jade's words, I believe I have been ""psychically traumatised"".   It was a great move in terms of entertainment though. Bad for housemates, ultimately better for viewers. It's going to really go off in there now."
bbuk,37rywr,Lockowandt,8,Sat May 30 10:41:31 2015 UTC,"Well then, Jade looks like she's probably going to be safe for a couple of weeks."
bbuk,37rywr,floydmoon,10,Fri May 29 22:29:12 2015 UTC,Please don't judge Irish people by Jade and Marc. These two are complete twats.
bbuk,37rywr,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Fri May 29 23:18:49 2015 UTC,This is what we can look forward to. Here's the latest from Daily Star.
bbuk,37rywr,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Fri May 29 23:26:09 2015 UTC,More details on Marc and Jade's history.
bbuk,37rywr,pfliegerz,3,Fri May 29 23:40:16 2015 UTC,"Theory: Jade told producers in her pre-show interviews that she watched the program, they knew he was an ass on the show, so they pulled him in knowing Jade would tell the other housemates he was an ass to cause a divide and start drama right from the start of his tenure."
bbuk,37s1b4,Lockowandt,9,Fri May 29 22:43:35 2015 UTC,If Simon lasts four days that would be five too many.
bbuk,37s1b4,laurenisbitchin,6,Sat May 30 05:47:46 2015 UTC,i think they should've kicked him out in the first 10 minutes like they did the first time.
bbuk,37s1b4,alaff,3,Sat May 30 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"I am very curious to see the Danny/Marc argument. This is probably good for Danny's game because it was really tiring to watch the forced showmance drag on and on and on....  And when it comes to first impressions of people, I probably had the strongest reaction to Marc of all the housemates this year.. Do not like. He will probably know, even from the twist itself, that drama is the way to make your mark in the house.. I think if it had been the expected nominees up for eviction.. Jade probably would've stayed.  I kinda worry that Aaron will look like a shrinking violet compared to this Marc guy.."
bbuk,37s1b4,ellelelle,1 point,Sat May 30 12:43:35 2015 UTC,"I don't like Marc either, he has already argued with Danny and has had run ins with Harry and Jade this morning as well. Him and Simon think that by 'confronting' people they are being up front but it's actually coming across really rude and unnecessary."
bbuk,37s1b4,ellelelle,1 point,Sat May 30 14:59:21 2015 UTC,Do you watch live?  He is going to dominate a lot of the conversation over the next week or two I'm guessing.
bbuk,37s1b4,Barryva,3,Sat May 30 15:20:12 2015 UTC,Sarah out and Simon in? this one night just ruined the series for me.
bbuk,37s1b4,the_cucumber,2,Sat May 30 13:30:46 2015 UTC,"Since when are Eileen and Joel popular? I don't like Eileen much but Joel is my favourite, but I thought the public hated him?"
bbuk,37s1b4,ellelelle,2,Sat May 30 04:08:01 2015 UTC,I think Eileen is popular but is Simon was very smart he would be aligning himself with Nick and Jack.  I can't see that happening though.
bbuk,37s1b4,sourcefed_me,1 point,Sat May 30 12:36:39 2015 UTC,Joel wasn't popular when people first heard Aaron was ejected but during that episode Twitter and Facebook was very anti-Aaron and pro-Joel and it continued into last night's show with Joel and Sarah.
bbuk,37s1b4,JuiceBusters,1 point,Sat May 30 14:54:12 2015 UTC,I think the same thing is gonna happen

bbuk,37rvrb,Jordy_Banks,9,Fri May 29 21:59:59 2015 UTC,"I know. BB's big bid to get people watching is...........Simon? Really? Him? Over Adjoa, Amy and Sally, Harriet, Kieran and Sarah? Simon?"
bbuk,37rvrb,Lockowandt,10,Fri May 29 22:05:17 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I'm suspecting foul play. This guy has links to the show business industry so who knows whether someone behind the scenes pulled some strings for him. One episode of airtime wouldn't have been enough to get his name out there so now he's back in to get some more publicity. I mean I don't have any evidence but check out the #abusedbysimongross hashtag on Twitter, the guy's a slimeball and definetely has something like this in him.   Extra thought: he wasn't evicted by the public, no one spent money to evict him so it's not classed as fraud. Who knows?"
bbuk,37rvrb,OliverLyndon,7,Fri May 29 22:10:48 2015 UTC,I just checked the hashtag out and I think it's safe to say he's the most hated housemate in there at the moment and he's only been in there for 5 minutes.
bbuk,37rvrb,Lockowandt,6,Fri May 29 22:17:48 2015 UTC,"Naw I'm sure it was planned all along. His first night eviction was so unfair, and it almost happened to Adjoa, and if it had we'd all be pleased to see her back now. It makes sense that they were planning to give them their chance back later in the season as a returning HG."
bbuk,37rvrb,the_cucumber,3,Sat May 30 04:13:45 2015 UTC,Aw how great would it be if one of the 4 evicted could be saved and go back in as the 4th HG over Simon in the same night?? It'd be like a hilarious cruel joke. Missed opportunity there.
bbuk,37rvrb,the_cucumber,3,Sat May 30 04:15:00 2015 UTC,"I know like he said showbiz and 14 times when he went in, I really hope one of the house mates get on to him. But Marc from Tallafornia enough said!"
bbuk,37rvrb,ellelelle,7,Fri May 29 22:09:27 2015 UTC,I have to say.. I liked Sam straight away.. but I am so gutted over Kieran. I think I will have to keep the flair for a while in remembrance.   :(
bbuk,37rvrb,Devtactics,2,Sat May 30 01:54:23 2015 UTC,Same!
bbuk,37rvrb,realister,2,Sat May 30 06:06:08 2015 UTC,"you have to understand that vast majority of voters are young, white school aged girls. There is just not enough ""black"" voters in UK to keep black people in.  That sounds racist but its true. In order for a black person to stay they have to be 100 times better than the rest and really stand out. Kieran was ok but not good enough.   White young girls never keep black males."
bbuk,37rvrb,ellelelle,1 point,Sat May 30 18:58:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe you are right,  maybe the race thing is an issue. I guess if you are black you probably go in as an outsider to majority white voters and black voters are hardly going to like him just because he is black! You need to win over the majority. I think a lot of people liked him but he had tough competition with that group he was up against."
bbuk,37rvrb,realister,1 point,Sat May 30 20:14:02 2015 UTC,yea he is a very good housemate its just the situation he got put in meant certain eviction :(
bbuk,37rvrb,pomegranatechips,6,Sat May 30 20:18:59 2015 UTC,"I could care less about the timebombs, but the fact that Simon is back in the house really bothers me."
bbuk,37rvrb,JuiceBusters,4,Sat May 30 03:01:44 2015 UTC,Strongly agree with you. The entire premise of 'Big Brother' is destroyed and when they actually started out with a very refreshing 'mostly real people' BB we end up with...  ...Model Agency Summer Pool Party.   I hope it doesn't get that bad but the OP is right - this 'timebomb' just blows up the entire point and premise and blows 2 'arcs' for bitchy models :(
bbuk,37rvrb,ellelelle,2,Sat May 30 06:50:04 2015 UTC,Model Agency Summer Pool Party is now filling me with dread.
bbuk,37rvrb,ecctv,9,Sat May 30 12:53:55 2015 UTC,"That's showbiz!!!! I think this is a crazy brilliant twist. Amazing for ratings and drama. It is like a whole new house, I love it. I'm still watching definitely.  I do think the public was wrong with Kieran, though. No clue why he went."
bbuk,37rvrb,ellelelle,8,Fri May 29 22:04:12 2015 UTC,Ad prefer if Chloe went as she has done feck all in the house so far!
bbuk,37rvrb,pfliegerz,2,Fri May 29 22:08:12 2015 UTC,"What I don't get is keeping Danny over Kieran.. Danny's whole schtick in the house was Sarah.. what's happening with Sarah, cuddling with Sarah, saying he didn't like Sarah, acting like might like Sarah, talking about Sarah..  At least Kieran was funny and was able to have a conversation with everyone single person in the house. His only mistake was being too much of a wingman when it came to Sarah! He probably should've let them sort it out between them."
bbuk,37rvrb,realister,0,Sat May 30 12:53:04 2015 UTC,He was boring and annoying to listen to. I'm glad he's out.
bbuk,37rvrb,originalgirl77,1 point,Fri May 29 22:29:37 2015 UTC,The most hated people got taken out. Even if it didnt happen now it would have happened later. They were most hated by the public. Deal with it.  Sarah spoiled hot girl with no brain - majority of voters are girls = out.  Keeran - majority of voters are white young girls = out.   Loud mouth - again majority of voters are girls and they hate loud mouth girls = out.
bbuk,37rvrb,tvwatcherguy,1 point,Sat May 30 18:53:44 2015 UTC,"I am upset about the 4 in 4 out thing... The reason I love watching BBUK and BBAUS is because it was supposed to be a social experiment with everyday people from different walks of life. I like the tasks and the games that are played to get people to show their true selves. The outright manipulation happening this season is disappointing.  One of the major reasons I dislike the US and CAN series is because of the backstabbing/cheating/lying among the players and it becomes more of an outwit/outlast scenario akin to Survivor... I would love to see the US and CAN versions go back to public votes.   I will still watch BBUK this season as I think that as much as I am upset that Sarah, the Twins and Kieran (note that I'm NOT upset Harriet is gone) are gone I believe that Marc could be a VERY interesting character to watch. He is going to be the one we love to hate and hate to love. I would have loved to see Sarah and Marc kick it off with each other, both strong, opinionated intelligent people."

bbuk,37rwtx,Heyittiskyle,2,Mon Jun 1 11:20:05 2015 UTC,"are you really a female? How can you say such things, you are blaming the victim for rape.   So when a woman is raped you going to say ""hey don't dress that provocatively?"" are you serious right now?"
bbuk,37rwtx,Lockowandt,2,Sat May 30 18:51:28 2015 UTC,I thought the exact same thing when I hear Sarah saying it and I thought it was so disgusting that a woman would blame the victim; this just proves that male on male sexual assault is not taken seriously.
bbuk,37rwtx,Kigurumix,0,Mon Jun 1 04:21:27 2015 UTC,"I don't blame Joel but its not like he prevented it? It wasn't rape, lt was really just a joke... but if Joel was that threatened, he should've went straight to the diary room..."
bbuk,37rwtx,realister,2,Mon Jun 1 11:22:40 2015 UTC,"Joel gotta be smart, he said it never happened to him and he didn't know how to react."
bbuk,37o1ar,ellelelle,6,Fri May 29 01:32:55 2015 UTC,"Evicted:  Harriet- Her pushing naked Aaron on Joel is only one reason of a long list that I have for why I do not like her. Kieran- He is an okay guy, but he does not entertain me as much as the others.  Plus, although he seems like a stand up guy, his voice really irks me. Danny & Sarah - Their flirtmance is not for me.  Both seem like okay individuals, but again I do not find them all that entertaining. In all honesty, I really do not care who goes as long as it is not Chloe.  Personally, I would like to see house guests of seasons' past return.  It might not be a popular choice, but I would like to imagine it as ""Fans vs Favorites"".  Plus it would go well with the time theme of this season.  I do not think that a shake up was necessary for this season.  Although some of the cast is bland, I think that it was shaping up to be a good season.  But let's be honest, anything would be better than last year's Big Brother."
bbuk,37o1ar,JesterCrim,2,Fri May 29 03:30:53 2015 UTC,I think fans versus favourites would be a great idea.. and it does actually fit the theme like you say! :O
bbuk,37o1ar,wigsnatcher,5,Fri May 29 11:47:40 2015 UTC,"As long as Chloe doesn't go, I'm cool.  I just can't wait to see everyone shit themselves when they start getting the unexpected boot.  Oh and those screeching harpy twins need to go back to Hell."
bbuk,37o1ar,aubnonymous,1 point,Fri May 29 06:52:19 2015 UTC,"I can't wait to watch that either. There's going to be total panic. Even Jack is going to freak. If he hadn't used that pass, he could've been right out the door. It will definitely shake things up and I doubt they'll have the wherewithal to actually give the new housemates a proper welcome with all the fallout."
bbuk,37o1ar,Refuge_Of_Losers,1 point,Fri May 29 11:56:56 2015 UTC,"Furthermore I wonder if people will resent Jack for being aware of teh situation and being powerless to it the same way they do with Nick's face to face evictions. This is the situation big brother has given them, to not abide by the rules is to be booted which they don't want."
bbuk,37o1ar,wigsnatcher,2,Fri May 29 17:18:26 2015 UTC,I hope not. It's like you say: it's the situation big brother has put them in. I even felt the same with Jade's princess thing but she didn't do herself any favours either.   I think it would be hard to be angry at Jack though.
bbuk,37o1ar,jyunga,3,Fri May 29 17:22:05 2015 UTC,"I would like Danny to stay <3. But if they put in a bland and useless, but attractive and nice guy in there to replace him, I'll be okay. For some reason, I always enjoy that character type. The rest, I don't really care one way or another. If Sarah were to leave, then maybe they would show Danny having conversations that don't involve her. That'd be nice.  I don't know if I care for the character descriptions we've been given of the incoming housemates, but as long as they are funny in some way, I'll accept them. And I'm hoping for Bianca from last year, because she was an absolute nutjob who deserved to stay longer.  I actually like that they flipped the noms and then are getting rid of a bunch of them, because it's getting rid of most of the bores and potentially adding in interesting folks with the interesting folks that are staying in there."
bbuk,37o1ar,Lockowandt,2,Fri May 29 03:56:57 2015 UTC,Biannca is a goddess.  #gone2soon
bbuk,37o1ar,JuiceBusters,1 point,Fri May 29 06:50:59 2015 UTC,"It's true that anytime we see Danny, he is either with Sarah or talking about her, it seems. Kinda unfortunate for him that there isn't other footage being shown.  Where did you find the description of the incoming housemates?  I like that they flipped it too, it makes for great television and I like that it stops the coasting strategy that was mentioned on BBOTS."
bbuk,37o1ar,bbukvynse,3,Fri May 29 11:46:46 2015 UTC,"Amy/Sally, Chloe, Harriet, Danny gone for me."
bbuk,37o1ar,JuiceBusters,3,Fri May 29 06:02:50 2015 UTC,same as me!
bbuk,37o1ar,JuiceBusters,3,Fri May 29 11:42:36 2015 UTC,If show is freezing the lines between evictions then I am predicting:   1st out: Amy and Sally  2nd out: Harriet  3rd out: Kieran  4th out: Sarah  It they don't freeze (which is unlikely) then Sarah could be over taken by Chloe.
bbuk,37o1ar,dunave,1 point,Fri May 29 14:56:53 2015 UTC,I never thought about leaving voting open might affect it. That's a good point.  I guess reopening the voting lines after each eviction would be quite profitable for them..
bbuk,37o1ar,ptko,1 point,Fri May 29 15:44:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a BB purist and detest the idea of any HMs entering after launch night.   I'd like to see Sarah, The Twins, Danny and Kieran gone even though I don't even dislike any of them I see them going nowhere special anymore."
bbuk,37n2bj,chlod4chlod,17,Thu May 28 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"The rest of the house should be reprimanded over how they were laughing and not stopping him. Harriet even pushing them together, disgusting.  Have to say Joel handled it very well making an excuse to get deodorant originally and in the diary room"
bbuk,37n2bj,bovinejumpsuit,11,Thu May 28 21:58:34 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Aaron as a housemate but that totally got out of hand and it really didn't help that the others were actually egging him on.. that bothered me too - especially Harriet pushing him towards Joel. I wish someone had been there to intervene.   If Kieran had been awake he would have ;)   Not a fan of Joel as a housemate, but jesus I don't know what I would've done if I had a naked man invading my personal space and try to gyrate on me. That was way too physical.   Maybe people weren't seeing it in context, but if it was a guy doing that on a girl, I think there would have been alarm bells straight away."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,5,Fri May 29 00:10:49 2015 UTC,The only thing I think he should have done for his own safety would have been to have gone to the diary room when he went to the bathroom instead of going back into the bedroom.
bbuk,37n2bj,Kigurumix,5,Thu May 28 22:06:24 2015 UTC,Weren't their only like four of them awake in the corner though? I could only see Harriet walking around the bedroom and Sarah and Danny awake in a bed. I think everyone else was out of it.
bbuk,37n2bj,Lockowandt,3,Thu May 28 22:13:58 2015 UTC,"Joel, Harriet, Jack, Nick, Danny, Sarah, and obviously Aaron were awake at the time."
bbuk,37n2bj,Heyittiskyle,13,Fri May 29 04:46:43 2015 UTC,"Jade telling Big Brother in the DR that she doesn't want to unleash on Joel, because clearly Joel cannot ""handle her mental capacity.""   Delusions of superiority."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,7,Thu May 28 21:45:19 2015 UTC,"She tries to come across as so balanced and reasonable, probably so no one can accuse of her of being up herself, but every so often she makes a slip. Her ego is really quite fragile."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,7,Fri May 29 00:35:05 2015 UTC,"I think her self perception is so different than how other people see her, possibly because, any people that have dared to point out her inconsistencies and fallacious thinking were eliminated from her life. At least, that is how she handles this issue with the housemates on TV. One of her favorite sayings is ""that's just my opinion."" And she says this during discussions in order to block any right to opposition on the part of her detractor, after all, everybody has a right to their own opinion. This woman has never been wrong in her life. Just ask her. And talk about fragile egos....only a week and a half in, and she is crumbling and transparent. I'm just waiting for her to see it. But, alas, she switched her personalities and avoided any true self discovery."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Fri May 29 00:52:07 2015 UTC,"You're really encouraging the armchair psychologist in me to come out now.. but yeah.. the dissociation could actually be a defense mechanism to shield her from negative aspects of herself. If she really believes herself even half of the time, that's a whole lot of cognitive dissonance to shield oneself from!  I also noticed the ""just my opinion"" thing! She wasn't happy when Joel wouldn't accept her opinion after she called him out about the bath hair, but what was he going to say, yeah, you're right, I am devious?! Obviously people are going to defend themselves, or they might actually have no interest in your opinion of them! And they certainly don't have to accept it! I thought that was an odd comment, to be frustrated that someone wouldn't accept your opinion of them.  Also think you are right that she is not used to having to deal with people who don't like her. It's easy to act tough when you can run away and play damsel in distress with people who stroke your ego.  Nick has been so patient with her!"
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,5,Fri May 29 01:07:17 2015 UTC,"Nick has been amazing, and I proudly flair him! It's somewhat ironic that he has such low self esteem, but is one of the most empathetic housemates ever to walk in the door, especially in how he deals with Jade."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Fri May 29 01:22:33 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched many seasons, and not in absolute yonkers, but he is very empathetic and unexpectedly concillatory for someone who admitted to trolling previous big brother housemates. The exchange between him and Jack was really heart warming tonight. I can see them being good friends by the end. When Nick said he was learning so much about himself, I genuinely believed him, and that is no small feat because I am sure that is a line that many give as their motivation to go into the house and their ""takeaway"" when they leave."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,10,Fri May 29 01:30:56 2015 UTC,I enjoyed Jade and the twins making up. I know it's anti drama but still twas nice.
bbuk,37n2bj,tvwatcherguy,6,Thu May 28 21:29:56 2015 UTC,Me too. It was like they were genuinely working well as a team and forgot they were meant to hate each other because they had a common objective.
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,5,Fri May 29 00:30:45 2015 UTC,As Harriet would say... Chocolate!
bbuk,37n2bj,tvwatcherguy,17,Fri May 29 00:39:16 2015 UTC,"Joel in the DR: I am uncomfortable. My personal space was invaded. I thought I might have to punch him. I didn't do anything to entice his behavior. It was unacceptable, and I didn't know how to react to it, because it hasn't ever happened to me before.  Joel's right."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,11,Thu May 28 21:56:11 2015 UTC,"Joel was 100% right, and it broke my heart to see him blame himself and feel guilty about Aaron leaving. That actually made me warm to Joel, I think he was genuinely gutted for Aaron. The situation definitely got out of control, and to Aaron's credit, he seemed to genuinely understand that. There was no other option but to remove Aaron. I just wish someone had intervened, instead of egging it on."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,4,Fri May 29 00:15:48 2015 UTC,"Nice to hear from you, I literally just read one of your comments on the other thread. Joel was surely put in a very awkward situation. Not only was his space violated, Joel's game was also compromised. I'm glad Big Brother made it clear that Aaron's actions were what lead to his ejection, and regardless of Joel's feelings, the decision was irreversible. I'd hate to see Joel bear the blame in the eyes of Aaron's voting fans. It really was surprising that nobody empathized with Joel while it was happening, and the sobering reality of their own behavior was evident when Joel exited the DR. I'm hoping Aaron checks into alcohol rehab and takes some sensitivity training courses, and gets some therapy, too. He hasn't had it easy, as he was targeted by bullies for being gay when he was a teenager. But, it's time for him to grow up and be a responsible man. I hope there are some positive people in his life that encourage him to make healthy choices in order to move forward."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,6,Fri May 29 00:37:01 2015 UTC,"I'm all over this sub tonight!   But yeah, I agree with you. I actually think there is still a great opportunity for Aaron do well after the show, especially if he can take ownership of what happened, address his relationship with alcohol, and learn to respect the boundaries of others. He's not the only person in the world that has trouble with boundaries. Hopefully he will reflect upon this and learns something."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,2,Fri May 29 01:00:11 2015 UTC,Maybe this was the wake up call he needed.
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,8,Fri May 29 01:02:06 2015 UTC,"Did anyone else notice the death stare Harriet had on her face after it was announced that Aaron had left? If that was directed towards Joel, I would actually be disgusted."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,1 point,Fri May 29 00:16:31 2015 UTC,"If there is one person out of the four evictees I'd like to see the door hit where the good lord split them it's Harriet. I really had hopes for her but alas, she's annoying."
bbuk,37n2bj,aubnonymous,1 point,Fri May 29 17:13:48 2015 UTC,I never really warmed to her. I was shocked when she was top three favourite to win. I thought maybe people had her confused with Chloe?!?
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,2,Fri May 29 17:25:56 2015 UTC,"""Regular"" folks want to root for someone they can identify with. There are loads of cafe workers (waiters/waitresses) that don't have posh backgrounds I can see why they'd want to root for her the first night (based on VTs and their entrances) but if you had to poll everyone NOW I sincerely doubt anyone would vote her as a favorite HM."
bbuk,37n2bj,aubnonymous,16,Fri May 29 17:27:42 2015 UTC,Wish I was seeing what housemates who don't like Joel are seeing. I think he's so level-headed and clear and rather funny. He handled this situation the best he could.
bbuk,37n2bj,aubnonymous,5,Thu May 28 21:55:28 2015 UTC,"I don't strongly dislike him but I do think he has a persona and I really don't agree with his politics or moralising tone. The level headedness and clearness is all a part of the persona, I think, but he is a skilled debater and clearly takes that seriously. I just wish the politician roleplay was put aside for a bit. I much prefer the other role plays! The Katy Perry Fan. The Desperate Housewife. The Bingo caller. He actually has great comedic instincts. He reminds me of Leonardo DiCaprio in Catch me if you Can. Read into that what you will ;)   But yeah, he definitely handled that situation well, and my heart did go out for him when he started blaming himself. Aaron overstepped the boundaries, that's not Joel's fault. He clearly stated his boundaries, he was very clear in his requests for Aaron to stop, and he was very smart to remove himself from the situation.  Any housemate who would blame him for that isn't worth his time."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,6,Fri May 29 00:23:30 2015 UTC,"Ha! Big Bot is dickish. Sarah quoted as saying Danny's butt looked great, than Danny quoted saying he doesn't see himself with Sarah. Awkward."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Thu May 28 21:20:21 2015 UTC,"The Sarah/Danny narrative has been heading that way for a while though, I doubt Sarah was even surprised."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,3,Fri May 29 00:29:57 2015 UTC,"I kinda feel bad for them. It's like they don't really want to have a showmance, but they're obviously being shipped. Also, I totally expect them to both be evicted tomorrow. They are both so neutral, and voters tend to go for the extremes."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,7,Fri May 29 00:42:10 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, though Sarah seems slightly more polarising so might have a better chance. At least she is outspoken!"
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,3,Fri May 29 00:51:46 2015 UTC,"I think she would have a better chance of staying if the fans were voting to save their favorite housemates, instead of voting to evict their least favorite."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Fri May 29 01:00:56 2015 UTC,That is a good point.. ahh I can't wait to see what happens!
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,5,Fri May 29 01:15:04 2015 UTC,"Wow, Nick's home sounds pretty sweet. Stables, swimming pool, tennis court."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,7,Thu May 28 21:33:51 2015 UTC,"Weirdly I can't imagine him making much use of any of those things, though I guess I could kind of picture him awkwardly trotting on a horse."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,6,Fri May 29 00:33:41 2015 UTC,I thought the exact same thing....he probably doesn't even use them.
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Fri May 29 00:43:26 2015 UTC,Thank you for that image haha
bbuk,37n2bj,the_cucumber,8,Fri May 29 07:29:42 2015 UTC,Joel is handling Aaron ' s obnoxiousness rather calmly.
bbuk,37n2bj,aubnonymous,13,Thu May 28 21:49:29 2015 UTC,Can you imagine if this had been happening to a girl in the house?
bbuk,37n2bj,ecctv,8,Thu May 28 21:48:48 2015 UTC,"I think there is a silver lining in how it shows males can be subjected to sexual harassment and that its is not them being weak or anything feminine. Had it happened to a girl, however, shit would have went down. I doubt there will be a big deal made out of this compared to what happened with Hazel and that guy a year or two ago."
bbuk,37n2bj,Heyittiskyle,3,Fri May 29 04:50:12 2015 UTC,nail on the head.
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,2,Fri May 29 00:17:11 2015 UTC,Completely agree.
bbuk,37n2bj,aubnonymous,4,Thu May 28 21:50:46 2015 UTC,There is so much to cover today! This will be/is a great ep so far.
bbuk,37n2bj,ecctv,5,Thu May 28 21:23:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, Big Brother, you've clearly drawn a line. Now be consistent."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Thu May 28 21:58:29 2015 UTC,"Well, it wasn't Fight Night Two as some rumors implied, but it was a very clear violation of rules on Aaron's part. After ignoring several requests by Joel to desist, Aaron actually escalated his behavior and rubbed his naked body against Joel. Absolutely aggressive behavior and I don't see that Big Brother had any other choice. Aaron's conduct is indefensible. But, the rumors of Aaron hitting Joel are not supported by anything seen tonight....and we can be sure had it happened, it would have been shown.  edit:syntax"
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Thu May 28 23:18:48 2015 UTC,"I think I saw Aaron throwing something at Joel after Joel hit him with a pillow but I didn't see what it was and Joel didn't appear physically hurt. Whether he hit him or not though, the physicality and harassment was indisputable, like you say."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,9,Fri May 29 00:43:52 2015 UTC,"Joel has asked Aaron several times to stop. Aaron has continued at least 5 times and now has his body up against Joel. Big Brother calls Aaron to the DR. I dunno guys, I'm seeing the promised ""sexual misconduct."""
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,5,Thu May 28 21:53:17 2015 UTC,"Jeez, they are all so drunk! Last year they hardly ever had alcohol, this year everyone is drunk all the time!"
bbuk,37n2bj,Lockowandt,3,Thu May 28 21:54:07 2015 UTC,You know I think jack may have even be drunk. When he was talking to Nick he was a little slurry with his speech.
bbuk,37n2bj,aubnonymous,6,Thu May 28 21:56:20 2015 UTC,Jack was definitely drunk. He even said to Nick that he was drunk but used a different word.
bbuk,37n2bj,Lockowandt,5,Thu May 28 22:01:56 2015 UTC,"I think the four people going tomorrow will be the twins, Sarah, Harriet, and Danny.   Chloe and Kieran have both been basically non-existent in the shows since the votes have opened, so it'll be hard for anyone to want to evict them, especially Kieran."
bbuk,37n2bj,Refuge_Of_Losers,4,Thu May 28 22:14:15 2015 UTC,I really hope you are right because Kieran is my favourite!
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,6,Fri May 29 00:35:50 2015 UTC,Is anyone watching bots atm?  I'm a little disappointed at how little they made of the Aaron/Joel situation.
bbuk,37n2bj,tvwatcherguy,3,Thu May 28 22:17:11 2015 UTC,I haven't finished watching bots but Rylan did try to explain diplomatically Big Brothers decision at the start and that made me think there might have been some controversial opinions in the audience. It wouldn't be right to have people trying to excuse of defend that behaviour. It might've gotten ugly?
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,4,Fri May 29 00:32:06 2015 UTC,I'm thinking the network or the production company had no choice based on their company policies. It's pretty cut and dry for any Human Resources rep.
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Fri May 29 01:05:05 2015 UTC,"BOTS isn't live, except for the Friday show. You can tell this because on the live BOTs shows they show the time at the start of the show. They probably couldn't talk about the situation because it had only been dealt with in the house."
bbuk,37n2bj,nathanthenerd,1 point,Thu May 28 22:46:30 2015 UTC,I think they are taking the day in chronological order.
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,1 point,Thu May 28 22:18:54 2015 UTC,"I was absolutely disappointed about that. It was just soooo light hearted on BOTS last night. I watched the main show without any idea what was coming and I was appalled at how long BB let that behavior continue. It never should've gotten to the point that it did. If it's not addressed properly today with the gravitas it deserves, I might have to stop watching this season."
bbuk,37n2bj,Bimboden,4,Fri May 29 20:13:23 2015 UTC,"Joel in the DR blaming himself. But when he goes out to face the house, they take responsibility for their roles in the matter...for egging Aaron on. Handled well."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,7,Thu May 28 22:22:42 2015 UTC,I felt relief that they didn't turn on Joel or blame him. That would have been awful.
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,5,Fri May 29 00:42:27 2015 UTC,Most adult acting house I've seen in ages and it's rather young. I'm actually rather impressed.
bbuk,37n2bj,aubnonymous,5,Thu May 28 22:23:36 2015 UTC,It's because of Kieran.  Ok I'm going to stop now..
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,3,Fri May 29 00:36:08 2015 UTC,"Nick, Harriet and Kieran are recruited to hang from the hands of the clock for as long as possible. This is their last chance to gain time to use in Big Bot's time machine.  Harriet: I'm going to cry.  Of course she is."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Thu May 28 21:12:24 2015 UTC,"So, now Aaron is flashing his ding dong at Joel. Aaron clearly being egged on by the other housemates. Joel does ask him not to continue."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Thu May 28 21:50:33 2015 UTC,"Ha! That guy in the audience likes Jade because ""she is so spiritual and she knows who she is."" I see her spirituality as an excuse to act superior to the other HMs, and she hides behind her polyamorous status in order to prevent any true intimacy with her lovers. She is  flighty and deeply confused."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,8,Thu May 28 22:50:01 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better in terms of the ""spirituality"".   I actually believe the polyamory is a farce because on the first day I believe she said that if she met the right person ""her soulmate"" she would be true to them and only them, but immediately Danny called her out on that, like ""how do you know.."" and then she gave some weird explanation that she thought you could have many loves but one soulmate, and she is young now so that's why she feels that way, but she'd need her husband to be polyamorous too..  I remember thinking.. she really needs to get her story straight!  I only know one person who is polyamorous, but from what I know it is a lifestyle. It's not something you do for fun before you settle down with your One True Love(tm).   I guess Jade's polyamory is the special snowflake polyamory..! She picks and chooses what sutis her, but hey, she is entitled to do that, I guess!"
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,4,Fri May 29 00:40:30 2015 UTC,"I remember the conversation to which you are referring. But, my inference was that Jade could still be polyamorous if she were married, but her husband could not. I thought at the time that it was a double standard. So, your view on that exchange was that she'd want a polyamorous husband? Who knows, Jade vacillates so erradically, it's hard to know what she actually believes. I think that is part of her modus operandi in her relationships."

I almost wish I could go back and listen to it now.  Vacillate is the perfect word for her."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,3,Fri May 29 01:27:08 2015 UTC,"She meant that she wants to be polyamorous now, but if she finds someone she can spend her life with then she wouldn't be. It's a little strange. I think she was trying to say while you're young it's a time to experiment, find who you are, what you like, and not settle or be boxed in by only one person and to instead experience a lot. Then once you're ready it's time to lock the leash in.  It kind of makes sense, but generally yeah, polyamorous is a lifetime thing and mindset. She sounds like she just wants to fuck around and find herself which is fair, but she's guising it under some spiritual thing to gain her more spirit cred. I wonder if she feels any vibes or if maybe it's just the air around her trying to shake sense into her? Her delusion is so brilliant and beautiful."
bbuk,37n2bj,laurenisbitchin,1 point,Fri May 29 05:03:57 2015 UTC,"I went back to that episode and listened again. My ear is much better trained to Jade's accent at this point, and I initially misheard what she said. You are correct, she does not want to be polyamorous in her marriage. She did connect her polyamory to her spiritual side, stating that she wanted to be free to be intimate with multiple partners without the burden of a committed relationship. She describes herself as ""free to the bone."" (I think I know which bone she is talking about.)"

bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Thu May 28 21:22:19 2015 UTC,Chloe is dreading the first time she will have to face eviction. I hope she doesn't get the boot on Friday night.
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Thu May 28 21:23:35 2015 UTC,30 min left and it is already the end of the day! I'm soo excited.
bbuk,37n2bj,ecctv,2,Thu May 28 21:34:39 2015 UTC,Do you think the house being told about Aaron leaving will be shown on BOTS?
bbuk,37n2bj,aubnonymous,3,Thu May 28 21:57:16 2015 UTC,I hope so!
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Thu May 28 21:57:37 2015 UTC,"Here's the Big Announcement, all housemates are gathered to the sofas at 240pm this afternoon.  Big Brother: Housemates, Aaron has been removed from the house for behavior deemed unacceptable. He will not return."
bbuk,37n2bj,aubnonymous,4,Thu May 28 22:20:26 2015 UTC,Glad to see the HMs all realize their actions the night before as well.
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,3,Thu May 28 22:22:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And glad to see Big Brother informing Joel that removing Aaron was their decision, not Joel's.  They really had no choice."
bbuk,37n2bj,tvwatcherguy,2,Thu May 28 22:24:21 2015 UTC,"I can't wait to see fully what happened with Aaron and Joel. From the ""on tonight's show"" section I'm 50/50 on whether it's Aaron being inappropriate or Joel playing the game."
bbuk,37n2bj,tvwatcherguy,3,Thu May 28 21:13:57 2015 UTC,"Sad to say it but yes he needed to go! Rules are rules! Bb stated his acts as well as informing him that the rules apply to any and all housemates! There shouldn't be a question of if he needed to go or not! As there wouldn't be if say, Jack done the exact same thing to Chloe for example!"
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,9,Thu May 28 22:00:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I enjoyed Aaron as a housemate, but there was no other option. Even Joel was gutted about. And to Aaron's credit, he didn't protest. He understood himself. It's sad that the situation got that out of hand, with Aaron even being egged on, but let it be a lesson that sexual harassment isn't always an obvious male/female transgression. It comes in many other forms and we should all be mindful of the boundaries we can overstep in our own lives!"
bbuk,37n2bj,tvwatcherguy,5,Fri May 29 00:25:50 2015 UTC,"""let it be a lesson that sexual harassment isn't always an obvious male/female transgression."" - Golden point!"
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Fri May 29 00:36:44 2015 UTC,"And Joel's statements are classic. He wasn't sure how to handle it....he considered punching Aaron to stop it.  That right there is a red flag to production, because if it happened again and Aaron and Joel came to fisticuffs, production would potentially have some very serious and very legitimate legal problems, having been aware that this had previously occured. Hope Aaron learns a lesson from this."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,6,Thu May 28 22:17:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think Joel's comments should've swayed Big Brother, but there was already more than enough evidence that there was sexual harassment going on and it had just become physical. They were already in danger of coming under fire without it getting to fisticuffs. Even though I enjoyed Aaron as a housemate and will miss him in there, I am really glad Big Brother was firm on it. It sends a strong message."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,1 point,Fri May 29 00:29:02 2015 UTC,"Surely, there must be more than the clip they showed."
bbuk,37n2bj,tvwatcherguy,3,Thu May 28 21:15:41 2015 UTC,Yeah we'll see. No doubt there'll be strong opinions either way.
bbuk,37n2bj,Kigurumix,1 point,Thu May 28 21:27:18 2015 UTC,So what Joel said in the diary room is most likely what caused him to be evicted after his warning.  The laughing and giggling and egging on of the other housemates is partially to blame for what happened and all the alcohol they give the housemates.
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,7,Thu May 28 21:57:24 2015 UTC,It sounded like Joel was answering questions. I'm sure production is obliged to get Joel's side of the story for human resources.  edit:sp
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,5,Thu May 28 21:59:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think Joel could have swayed the decision with his comments: there was enough reason there to remove Aaron. Joel was right in everything he said, though."
bbuk,37n2bj,Bimboden,1 point,Fri May 29 00:47:53 2015 UTC,"I don't see this as very unlike Chloe and Jeremy last year. He just tugged on her dressing gown to expose her breast, which at its core isn't a big deal. I don't think he was going to do anything beyond that, but it was highly inappropriate, technically assault and he was removed. Rightfully so.  While it was the attacker who was naked in this instance, he wasn't going to do anything beyond hump him, but it's highly inappropriate, technically assault and he was removed."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Fri May 29 20:10:13 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. Peer pressure on Joel. I didn't hear Joel choose. All I heard was Joel say ""It wasn't a dare."" I wish production was more accurate in their portrayal. This clip clearly depicts Aaron in a poor light. But, they were playing a game of truth or dare."
bbuk,37n2bj,TheFreshPrince12,5,Thu May 28 21:42:44 2015 UTC,"What happened was Joel was given the dare without being asked ""truth or dare"".   To be honest, the housemates can be malicious. Joel is dared to kiss Aaron even though it is known that Aaron is going to take it seriously and this will make Joel very uncomfortable. Second, for some reason Joel is made to say who he likes least in the house. I found that to be really despicable. They're all having a good time and then Danny has to go and ruin it. I really didn't like that. I'm actually on Jade's side because I too believe that Danny asked Joel that because he knew Jade would be the answer."
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,4,Fri May 29 02:31:50 2015 UTC,"So, Danny was trying to shade Joel? Good catch. If Danny survives tomorrow, I'll be watching him closer. Honestly, I find him bland and his presence irrelevant. Hopefully, this is his last night in the house."
bbuk,37n2bj,Devtactics,3,Fri May 29 02:39:19 2015 UTC,I watched the episode without any knowledge of Aaron's impending boot and was already feeling uncomfortable when this scene came on. Kudos to Kieran for advising Joel he didn't have to do it if he didn't want to.
bbuk,37n2bj,aubnonymous,2,Fri May 29 03:08:18 2015 UTC,"Jade, while entertaining, is one of those people I stay very far away from as there's no room for anyone else but her own massive ego."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,7,Thu May 28 21:43:59 2015 UTC,I think her and Christian are cut from the same cloth. They both have fragile egos and both struggle to be authentic because they don't like being criticised or questioned. They like to remain aloof and as observers or critics themselves.
bbuk,37n2bj,BeeBeeBuckley,2,Fri May 29 00:46:05 2015 UTC,"Okay, it looks like Aaron sincerely apologized to Big Brother and Joel."
bbuk,37n2bj,ellelelle,5,Thu May 28 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"That was the one redeeming thing about the whole thing for me.. he appeared to understand and though he was obviously gutted, he didn't protest. I think that is to his credit."

bbuk,37n2bj,Bimboden,1 point,Thu May 28 21:25:16 2015 UTC,"I have a lot to say on this matter because no one I know watches the show, so bear with me...  I've disliked both Joel and Aaron throughout the show, although I've been warming to them as of late. Aaron has been too forward with Joel throughout the entire show though, culminating last night in both the Truth or Dare game and the bedroom activities. I've been incredibly impressed with how Joel has handled each inappropriate interaction actually. He's expressed his distaste for Aaron's advances, but was never angry and would later approach Aaron to get a better understanding of where he was coming from (ie. the hot tub, which I thought was a very sweet moment). With each discussion, Aaron's behavior was toned down, but would eventually end up escalating as a part of his ""performances"" for the house each night.   I don't in any way believe that Aaron was acting maliciously or intended to go too far. He was having fun and so was Joel, up until the point that he wasn't anymore. Unfortunately, Aaron was too drunk to know the difference and I think everyone else in the room was just caught up in the moment. To them, it was a bit of banter. Joel is not comfortable with that kind of sexuality and whether it's because he's a repressed gay man or just a very sheltered child shouldn't matter. I've seen a lot of people say it's his fault for staying closeted and he was asking for it by getting in a hot tub with Aaron after Truth or Dare. THIS IS AN ENTIRELY FALSE PREMISE. His sexual orientation has nothing to do with the matter. When a person is uncomfortable with a sexual situation, it should NOT be forced on them, regardless of your own opinions on the matter.  A 19 year old BOY, whether he's a politician or not, should never be put in a position to feel bad that he doesn't want a naked man flashing him, in his bed, on his back, etc. Everyone was having fun, unaware of the position Joel was being put in. How was Joel to react? He was doing his very best to not make a huge deal about it, but he was CLEARLY uncomfortable. I'd like everyone in the house to think about how intimidating this situation probably was for him and just how they would have reacted had it been a straight man doing the same things to a 19 year old woman.  I've also heard a lot about Bianca and how she did similar things to Winston, but never got evicted. I actually believe she probably should have and this is a clear case of gender bias. Everyone thinks that a woman can't sexually harass or even rape a man because a man can just push them off, but anyone who still believes that in 2015 has some reading up to do. Both instances are so inappropriate it's not even funny. I believe they shouldn't have even let Aaron back into the bedroom that evening as they forced a victim (yes, I said it) to sleep in the same room as his attacker.  The only other option I would've been okay with seeing is BB asking Joel if he wanted to have a discussion with Aaron before removing him from the house. If he said no, then we leave it at that. If he were to say yes, which I think he would have, then they could've had closure and Joel could've asked BB to let Aaron stay, but I don't think he should have. I actually think both Aaron and Harriet (who I adore) should have both been kicked out and everyone else laughing about it should've been strongly reprimanded. People have been complaining about how strict BB has gotten, but this is not a subject that should ever be treated lightly. Unwanted advances (beyond an annoying chat up at the pub) are no laughing matter.  Aaron was quite obviously ashamed of his actions as he should have been, but it seems that now that he's out and he's getting support from people that don't quite understand the severity of the situation, he don't see it in quite the same light.  I'm not one to get really worked up about stuff, but this really struck a chord with me. No means no, even for boys."
