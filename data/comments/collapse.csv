We only have so much budget in the US to cover disasters, and the hits just keep on coming.  In West Africa, the UN is asking for donations to address this incredibly crucial issue. Twenty million dollars. That was the damage done in Iowa alone. Even if the disease doesn't spread to humans, the loss of livestock could be devastating. And we don't know much about how the virus behaves in wild bird populations, or what the impact is on environments where species of wild birds have been affected.

After Hurricane Katrina, some pump malfunctions shut down the Colonial pipeline which supplied the East Coast with petrol. Had either of those situations had some other coincidental interference with the emergency repairs, such as a following storm or other significant disruption, the damage to the economy could have had an exponential ripple effect.

As an example of how computing can address the Fermi paradox, consider the aestivation hypothesis of Anders Sandberg, Stuart Armstrong and Milan Cirkovic. Aestivation is a period of prolonged torpor into which some creatures slip. Unlike hibernation, which is a response to the cold of winter, aestivation is a response to heat or drought and is thus most often observed during summer months. Sandberg and his colleagues point out that the cost of a given amount of (irreversible) computation is proportional to temperature. One joule of energy will buy you a certain amount of computation today. If you wait, however, the universe will expand and as it does so it will cool and that joule of energy will be worth more in terms of the computation it can buy. In terms of the amount of computation that can be performed there is huge value in waiting before deciding to use your energy endowment; if you wait a trillion years, you gain by a factor of about 10 power 30 . So here’s an idea: civilizations, which are motivated by the desire to maximize computation, colonize a certain amount of the universe in order to gain access to sufficient raw materials, and then aestivate until it becomes rational for them to use those resources for computation. We don’t see ETCs now because they are “sleeping”, sheltering from the unbearable heat of our present-day universe."

The mean IQ is only 100. That roughly corresponds to those who might be happy in repetitive and menial jobs like cook, truck driver, butcher, welder, assembly line worker, warehouse work, etc. It's not even necessarily indication of college ready aptitude. 70% of the population falls within +/- one standard deviation or a score of 85-115.

Look what we've done to our world. What is to keep us from doing that to some other world? What is to keep up from destroying the biosphere of another planet and wholesale slaughtering its indigenous species? Certainly it takes some wits to get to another planet, but also takes a certain amount of wisdom to know when something is wrong.    You need only look at SpaceX. People act like Elon Musk is going to save the planet. He criticized NASA for not having a time-table for a Mars landing, but he was embarrassed because he didn't have one either. And that's who I'm gonna put my faith in? I don't think so. This is going to be rude, but Musk can't even keep his own personal life in working order. Yet, I'm to believe he can run a space colony?

Yes, 50 children in africa consume one of us, and its a good thing they are not all having 50 children.  No, your analogy of dehydrating myself might be the dumbest thing I have ever heard.

Neither can they get expensive suspension to save their backs. And cycling in the tropics is hard. Also while breathing in lungfuls of poisonous city air just shortens life. Besides try cycling in the night in crime-heavy areas. You are lucky to be able to cycle in your locality. Don't assume all localities are the same.  Well extra time, money and energy and the not harming yourself you have is great. But how is it staving of collapse exactly? Any child you bring into the world has its own carbon budget. You could make a child carbon-neutral using best standards of sustainability? It's only the carbon budget that is fixed. Besides how much of your own carbon budget do you use spuriously unknowingly?

Well, the broken collar bone was me being very reckless on a trail I was unsure about. It won't happen again and it happend once in 10 years so, not that big of a deal. Breaks are fantastic things. Please don't let bad air discourage you from riding. Its better to ride a bicycle than, for example, be overweight and not active. There is not a ton of evidence of air pollution killing people as a result of bicycle riding but there is a BREATHTAKING amount of evidence for a TON of people dying because their hearts are not healthy. If you are overweight, you have absolutely no business talking about the ills of riding bicycles in poor air quality.  Im not saying I am going to save the world (which you seem to be stuck on), I am saying I am not destroying the world. The world would not collapse if everyone was me.

Biomass absorbs solar energy, sequesters carbon then decays into fossil fuels. This is ""charging"" the battery.  Humans are using the energy of the battery (eg. fossil fuels and biomass) but by destroying about 50% of the pre-anthropocene biomass humanity is not only unsustainably using the earth's stored energy, it's also destroying the capability of the earth to ""recharge"" itself."

It's like saying we need to get big money out of politics because the weak nuclear force can't be reckoned with; yes we get our energy from plants, but water is also wet, big deal, you're being sensationalist (or ignorant on the science) in trying to boil everything down to thermodynamics.

Sure, I can easily imagine two centuries from now a humanity numbering in the hundreds of millions, in a world 6 degrees warmer, most humans living on the surface under conditions comparable to a mix of Dune and Afghanistan, with extremely lethal weapons empowering a gruesome feudalism. In such a world getting back to a previous standard of technology, science, reason, prosperity, industry is next to impossible. I can hundreds of millions of humans so survive in enclosed arcologies or eking out an existence in poisonous dust storms for thousands of years. But it would be the most horrible existence short of a concentration camp I can imagine.  Assuming there will still be meat and plant life available to eke out a living as hunter-gatherer is silly, unless you count roaches as a prize protein. This will be nothing like the Hunger Games. Well aside from cannibalism, but that is not a sustainable long term ecological concept. The human meat runs out very quickly.
