ImaginaryWarships,39ospr,yaboiwesto,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:03:54 2015 UTC,"I am very much in love with them too, I like drawing the giant battleship types, but this one I was trying a smaller cruiser type of ship instead"
ImaginaryWarships,39ospr,theprinceoftrajan,2,Sat Jun 13 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"Very cool man! I've actually been spending the last month or so prototyping a video game idea around floating ships and islands. I'm always looking for inspiration, so I'd love to see more of your work! Here's a quick 'n sloppy (and poorly compressed, haha) vid if you're interested!"

ImaginaryWarships,34v7hc,KapitanKurt,5,Mon May 4 20:57:08 2015 UTC,Do they actually launch these while underway? I always assumed that they had to at least stop moving before launching them.
ImaginaryWarships,34v7hc,Malkron,3,Tue May 5 02:22:28 2015 UTC,Yes.  The Delta IV can launch missiles while steaming at 5 knots (I assume the Delta III is similar).
