neuroscience,3e5gfq,darbyhouston,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:37:54 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer / fair warning: I didn't watch the entire video, but I understand Dennett's general position on the mind & the brain.  To me the issue is not, ""Do brains compute?"" (of course they do.)  The question is, what is it that is observing those computations?  And--do we know what the preconditions / requirements for that observer (consciousness) are?  Here I am making the brazen assumption that I possess a free will which exists independently of it's processing hardware--the input devices controlling the otherwise mechanical processing hardware.  In other words, what are the requirements for sentience?  What makes a system self-aware and capable of choice?  Is it sheer operational complexity, and therefore sentience could emerge from sufficiently complex plumbing just as well as it could from a brain?  Is electricity a requirement or just an advantage / mechanism for relaying messages quickly?  Do quantum effects play a role, creating the bridge between choice and determinism (with or without cellular microtubules)?  I wholeheartedly submit that any answer at this stage is premature, and while it's easy to throw the ""fear"" moniker as a rationale for anyone who believes that consciousness is it's own unique system, it's equally unlikely to presume that it's not.  </0.02>  (Apologies in advance if that wasn't the theme of this video and I'm attacking a straw man.)"

neuroscience,3e2ngm,neurone214,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"So my thinking here is, LFPs indicate the underlying brain processing going on, with different frequencies and their prominence (relative power) being behaviorally dependent, theta for exploratory behavior, beta for associative processing.   Now we have the stock market. Information comes in, investors and traders process it, and the stock/market reflects their processing. So, it may be, like during the financial crisis, the ""processing state"" of the market changed, and perhaps higher frequency oscillations emerge due to the panic. Since 2009, the market has been very stable, perhaps a different oscillation band is prominent."

neuroscience,3e4unq,ForScale,7,Tue Jul 21 23:39:34 2015 UTC,"I think you're misunderstanding him, and heavily overestimating how much knowledge we actually have. All the stuff where we're controlling things like drones, robotic arms, sending brain-to-brain communication, etc., is all just machine learning. It's complete black box computing; we have basically no idea what's actually going on inside the box and thus we don't actually understand what the brain is doing or how it's generating movement.      Take visual neurons, for example. We don't have a clue how they do what they do. Yes, we have some rudimentary sketch that we teach to undergraduate students, where we have a nice simple view of the retina feeding to the LGN feeding to V1, where there are beautiful and neat columnar arrangements, and clear examples of simple cells, which all converge to make up complex cells. Except none of this is really true. Yeah, the LGN feeds to V1, but the LGN also receives a tonne of feedback from everywhere. What does all of that stuff do? No clue. The columnar arrangement in V1 is a completely cartoonised version of what's actually going on, and these so-called cortical columns: not at all that neat in real life. Here's an exercise for you: Try to come up with a good and accurate description/model that can capture the response properties of a V1 simple cell. You're just not going to be able to do it because our understanding of the brain is super shallow (yeah, you can model it naively as a linear filter, but everyone who does this stuff knows that it's a bullshit model). If we can't even come up with an accurate model of a V1 simple cell - literally the first stage of cortical processing - how on Earth are we to get a comprehensive understanding of what the rest of the brain does? The reality is that we are very far away from a thorough computational understanding of the brain. We have sketches - cartoons - that we teach to students. But always remember that these are cartoons. They're easily digestible, comparatively uncomplicated, and minimalistic qualitative models of what the brain is doing. Once you start digging a bit deeper into this stuff, you'll learn that pretty much all of the stuff that you were taught is bullshit and everything is way more complicated than that."

neuroscience,3dw61n,JanneJM,2,Mon Jul 20 05:53:18 2015 UTC,"Hafed and his team found that these tiny eye movements play a major role in ""highlighting"" sensory information in our periphery -- without us even being aware of them.  [The study shows] neuronal response gain enhancement for peripheral stimuli appearing immediately before microsaccades. This enhancement occurs both during simple fixation with behaviorally irrelevant peripheral stimuli and when the stimuli are relevant for the subsequent allocation of covert visual attention. Moreover, this enhancement occurs in both purely visual neurons and visual-motor neurons, and it is replaced by suppression for stimuli appearing immediately after microsaccades. Our results suggest that there may be an obligatory link between microsaccade occurrence and peripheral selective processing.    The new aspect is the direct link that microsaccades assist in selective processing, i.e. they reduce noise in the peripheral environment."

I ended up getting hired in a lab using fMRI to study the neural systems involved with breathing sensation, something I never would have even thought was an area of study. Out of studying this though I found the perfect area of research which intersected with my many interests. So for me simply the exposure to new fields that I got while working in a lab was essential.   You don't need to know right away what methods you're interested in using, but I would try to use your post-bac years (which I would strongly recommend taking unless you have extensive research experience and publications coming out of college) to get a sense of which techniques you like and what level you like to think about the brain at. Computational neuroscience can opperate at many different levels, and you don't need to be exclusive to one, but it will be important to have a sense of how you like to think about problems in the brain so you can choose a grad school mentor who would be able to support your area of interest."

neuroscience,3d7ksr,THATBUSFROMSPEED,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:22 2015 UTC,"I think quantitative and programing skills would help you stand out relative to the average clinical psych student. If you can independently get some experience with programing (Python, Matlab, shell scripting) that will be hugely beneficial for you as a neuro RA as compared to a clinical psych path. Also any statistics background you can get. There is a truly great Coursera course called Statistical Analysis of fMRI data that covers the stats you need to understand and perform fMRI analysis that would be good to take if you're interested in applying to neuroimaging labs. For me the thing that helped me stand out was some (very basic) experience with fMRI data. I didn't an independent research project using publicly available fMRI data  in my undergrad and the PI of my lab needed someone who had experience working with the data.   For all of this though YMMV. It will be very dependent upon the research institution and lab you apply in. In lots of labs the RAs don't really do any analysis and their main job is coordinating studies, collecting data and managing the IRB and other administrative aspects of the lab. In those cases the analytic skill set will not be nearly as valuable as the interpersonal and organizational skills set that's required to  coordinate the studies. Regardless though I think any scientist will be intrigued by applicants with quantitative and analytical skills"

Are you also looking for recommendations about the line of research that will be a good fit with your background?   You don't sound too keen on pursuing a purely computational route. If so, how about chemosensation or olfaction in invertebrates? There is some fascinating work out there where the combination of chemistry, neuroscience and computational skills will come in very handy. One, there is still a lot of work to be done in identifying chemoreceptors and their assembly in invertebrates. New classes of receptors have been discovered as recently as 2009. Modeling their structures using amino acid co-evolution etc. is something I've come across in my readings. As more transcriptomes and genomes are being sequenced, there is a greater need for people who can code at least a little bit. The other aspect of the chemosensation story is figuring out how olfactory coding in the brain works, not just in inverts but other phyla too.   Edit: grammar."

If she hasn't seen a neurologist (not psychiatrist) who has at least some sort of faculty position at a medical school, she should do that first. If it truly is psychogenic, then there isn't a clearly understood mechanism for how this works. We have descending inhibitory systems that quiet activity in our spinal cord. We also have higher cortical systems that perceive sensations and direct movement-- these are arranged in a way that maps out the body, allowing one region to be affected while sparing another. The are also cases of ""neglect"" (neuropsych term, not meant the way somebody might neglect a child) in which people don't perceive body parts as their own. In those cases, though, it is generally limited to the left side of the body. I hope things get better for her."

Instead, it is believed that  the convolutions (ridges and valleys) in the cortex of the brain (surface) are responsible for this. These convolutions allow for more surface area of the brain  and therefore more connections between neurons/higher brain functions. I am not currently able to look up pictures to post with this, but if you look up images of a rat brain vs a human brain vs a dolphin brain, you can very clearly see the difference in amount of convolutions. The dolphin brain is not only larger but also has a lot more convolutions than the human or rat brain. From my understanding, this is why scientists/researchers believe dolphins are able to use their echolocation. It's just another higher-up function that their brain can handle (which ours can't)."
neuroscience,3d2xls,purduenbph,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:03:42 2015 UTC,"Brain size/brain volume actually is correlated to intelligence.  The folds, aka the gyri and sulci of the brain, are important... but only because they increase the surface area of the brain (basically increasing the size and volume), more specifically, the outer layer (the cortex).    Also, dolphins do have more cortical folds, most cetaceans do, in fact elephants do as well, however dolphins still have a lower encephalization quotient (about half that of a humans) and they have less neurons in their cortex (again, less than half of what humans have).  The reason they have more cortical folds is because those folds are related to the size of the brain - in that, as the size of the brain increases, more folds are needed to keep the same ratio of cortex to other brain matter... so a creature of larger size needs more cortical folds to maintain a certain level of intelligence."

Brain size is correlated with cognitive ability, the only reason anyone would even suggest otherwise is because of the brain size difference between females and males and the brain size differences between people of different geographic areas (different races).  It's a politically motivated statement.  However, objectively and realistically, brain size absolutely does correlate with intelligence.   evidence: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289604001357  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2770698/  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20145623  http://www.livescience.com/3862-bigger-brains-smarter-people.html  http://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Brain-Size-and-Cognitive-Ability-Correlations-with-Age-Sex-Social-Class-and-Race-1996-by-John-Philippe-Rushton-C.-Davison-Ankney.pdf  HOWEVER, your question:   is possible the smaller brain individual could posses some mental capabilities over the bigger brain individual?   Is it possible? Yes, there are plenty cases where people of low intelligence have had larger than average brains or vice versa. Neandertals had larger brains than modern humans, but judging from the archaeological evidence, they probably weren't more intelligent. Neocortex ratio, or the ratio of neocortex size to overall brain size is important, as is the amount of cortical folding. So structure plays a big part, and its definitely possible for a smaller brained person to posses a higher level of intelligence than a larger brained person... but, like I said in another comment, overall there is a correlation between brain size and intelligence."

neuroscience,3cxtkh,Beatle7,8,Sat Jul 11 19:14:06 2015 UTC,"Let's see.  The conduction speed of the squid giant axon is ~ 25 m/s.  Any good conductive wire should carry an electrical wave propagation near the speed of light at 300,000 Km/s or 30e7 m/s.  The ratio between the two is (30e7 ms)/(25 ms) = 1.2e7 ~ 10 million. So a near perfect electrical wire will need to be on the order of 10 million times the length of a squid axon that runs the length of a squid's leg (don't know how big this is).  Other measurements of peripheral nerve conduction are of similar order of magnitude around 10-100 m/s. Axons in the brain are mostly unmylenated and much smaller in diameter, making them slower. But if I had to make a rough guess I would put them around 0.1-1.0 m/s.  However the bigger bottle neck will be at the synapses and dendrites. I image the speed of an electrical potential across a synapse doesn't vary too much for the monoamines and amino acids. But dendritic trees comes in all manners of sizes of branching patterns that have huge effect on conduction velocity."

It's possible though, to detect REM with fewer channels, albeit with some loss of accuracy.  For overall simplicity I'd use submental EMG. Integrated power is simple to compute and will be at its lowest during REM. I'd record a few nights, see what the lowest integrated power tends to be, and decide on a cutpoint. I'd use a rolling average of 30-60 seconds if you wanted to have some sort of real-time estimate. The rolling average should smooth out the data and help deal with transient increases in muscle tone.  REM EEG is too non-specific for me to recommend it. EOG would require two leads and some sort of operational definition of what is ""rapid"" to avoid picking up slow eye movements in stage 1. I don't know how you'd deal with eye movements during wakefulness though.  Of course, some medications (especially SSRI's) can increase EOG and EMG activity, so that's something to keep in mind."

neuroscience,3ct5pn,TDaltonC,2,Fri Jul 10 15:52:46 2015 UTC,"In my mind there are two types of communication that are worth considering: symbolic and continuous communication.  Language is the best example of symbolic communication. We point to shared symbols (eg ""ball"" or ""bag"" are symbols for an abstract classes of objects) and the relationship between symbols (""the ball is in the bag"").  For continuous communication, think about helping a friend move a mattress. Through subtle movements of your body, you communicate ""slow down"", ""rotate this way"", ""you lead here"". You're coordinating a task as if you were a single mind.  I think that b2b links could improve both of these types of communication. I know that I have flashes of symbolic realization that take a few seconds to think up, but minutes or hours to serialize and communicate through language. b2b will enable whole new forms of symbolic communication that we don't even have names for yet (linked parallel symbolic streams, or weak recursion). It will as different from language as language is from point-and-grunt.  On the continuous front it will allow the communication of anticipation and preparation. A pair of dancers can only respond to movement actually made. Maybe a wink or a nod could anticipate a tempo change (and that verges on symbolic communication), but the movement must be made to achieve communication. An improvisational dancer can prepare herself for a coming movement and coordinate her whole body for it. b2b will enable a whole troop of dancer or soldiers to prepare and coordinate without symbolic translation or symbolic comprehension (ie they will be able to do it without explicitly know it what 'it' is) all while smoothly tracking each other.

What is happening is that he's reducing the cravings. When you are addicted, or just wanting, there are parts of the brain (usually the VTA/amygdala) pushing you to seek-out and satisfy your cravings. And there are other parts of the brain (PFC) holding that seeking behavior back.  We do know the longer a person goes without satisfying the cravings, the less likely relapsing occurs. The exact mechanics are still being worked out. But we do know that when someone goes longer and longer without relapse, the part of the brain responsible for drug-seeking behavior that is getting weaker. Yet the more reasonable portion of the brain preventing seeking behavior doesn't appear to get stronger. If it did, then we would expect people who have gotten off one drug to be less likely to become addicted to other drugs (or drug-like behaviors). In fact the opposite is true. Having kicked one habit earlier in life increases the likelihood you'll become an addict later in life.  tldr; there is a part of your brain screaming ""I WANT DRUGS!"" and another part screaming ""NO!""

There's some possibility that something is causing the hypnopompic hallucinations, such as another sleep disorder or effects of medication, but there's really no way to tell at this point. If this or other symptoms are causing problems, then I recommend seeking medical attention."

I have found that I suffer from it more if I am stressed out or if my hormones are out of whack (period, or a week/1.5 week after i start taking my birth control pills). I see things which range from the house falling apart to spiders to people/animals in the room trying to kill me and my SO. Usually my SO wakes up if I'm acting crazy and calms me down and eventually I'll really wake up. I always feel so stupid afterwards, because I do these strange things and have absolutely no control over it even though I am conscious of what I am doing. Apparently its in the family as my mother has suffered from it when she had newborns (a lot of stress), and my grandmother had it to when she was younger."
neuroscience,3cepnf,deadliftqueen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:59:07 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Sometimes pretty similar things happen to me:  I wake up in the middle of the night, completely confused where I am (often with the question why I only wear boxershorts), sometimes talking to ""people"" who are of course not in the room and then go back to sleep. I can remember pretty much all of these encounters but don't find them necessarily terrifying, just confusing. I think these things happen more often when I am stressed out, but I don't really care about it to be honest. I guess I am just a very vivid dreamer (sometimes even with lucid dreams)  I know that some drugs can cause these ""hallucinations"" (are you taking meds at the moment?). When I was in Africa for example I took drugs for malaria prevention (Malarone) and here I had some disturbing and funny ""hallucinations""  1) I woke up and thought little elephants are walking through the room. Needless to say there weren't any, although I even had a look under the bed (because they were tiny you know...) 2) I woke up and thought little spiders are all over my bed, stood up looked at my bed => nothing, went back to sleep 3) Once I dreamed we were on a safari and the driver is about to crush someone while parking, here I woke up. Naturally I wanted to protect the guy, stood up and started hammering against the metal posts on the bed, shouting ""Stop, you are going to kill him"" and after realizing I am in a bedroom and it is very unlikely that a safari jeep is about to crush someone in the room I went back to sleep. This one was the most vivid encouter. A friend of mine who slept in the room next door didn't even ask what happened that night, since he had similar experiences.  And Malarone was the prevention with the mildest side effects..."

Many times, an eating disorder manifests because the person is trying to control something within himself/herself, the same reason a person with OCD habits organizes things to reduce stress. The mentality is, I feel out of control. But I can control what I eat, and that makes me less stressed because I have control over something. So I'm going to excessively control my eating. That has nothing to do with speculated judgements from other people.   On the other side of the coin, a person who gets bullied a lot or has been sexually abused in the past might eat himself or herself into obesity to become ""undesirable"". This totally has something to do with other people's opinions of the person with the disorder.   It's tough to answer your question. In my experience, most eating disorders are stress/anxiety induced, and that it is the body's coping mechanism to try to ""control"" something when they feel out of control.

neuroscience,3c6ynt,Birch_Tree,2,Sun Jul 5 22:53:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe someone can chime in with a more detailed answer or correct me if I'm off.  I believe the important thing here is getting oxygenated blood flowing to the brain in order to fuel neurogenesis. Your body consumes energy differently in an anaerobic zone than in an aerobic zone, and the anaerobic energy consumption is not as conducive to neurogenesis as the aerobic. I would also guess that anaerobic exercise is more physiologically stressful than aerobic especially if you push yourself too hard, and your body's chemical response to that stress can have a detrimental effect on the brain.  I would also think that taking rest periods would be better than a session of constantly high HR, 'high HR' meaning an aerobic zone of somewhere between about 120 to 145 from what I understand. Pushing yourself constantly becomes stressful to the body, and that stress can become detrimental, so taking a rest period gives the body a chance to recover.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiological_effects_of_physical_exercise"
neuroscience,3c6ynt,Jaraws,3,Mon Jul 6 01:37:21 2015 UTC,"I agree about the stress on the systems. Stress signalling molecules, such as cortisol, are extremely beneficial when regulated properly, but cortisol may also be detrimental to the brain as is seen in Cushing's Syndrome patients. These patients usually end up suffering neuronal loss within the hippocampus due to the sensitivity of the structure, as well as cortisols ability to travel readily through membranes and alter the cell directly at the level of the nucleus.  What I do not agree with however are the points pertaining to neurogenesis. Neurogenesis is a phenomenon of the brain that is largely over-hyped. In the central nervous system of the adult brain, the only significant areas of neurogenesis are found within the olfactory bulbs, and Sommer's sector of the hippocampus (dentate gyrus & CA4). The number of neurons is highest shortly after birth, around 2 years old, and through the processes of synapse formation and selective synaptic pruning, circuits are formed to facilitate learning.   I think a key thing to consider here is the promotion of angiogenesis through aerobic exercise rather than neurogenesis. 1/3 of the brain rests on the hypoxic threshold, meaning these neurons are delivered oxygen via diffusion from neighbouring glia. With aerobic exercise comes an increase in the presence of angiogenesis-promoting molecules, circulating to all areas of the body, including the brain. It should be noted that some molecules may not cross the blood-brain barrier.   As muscles grow, there needs to be an increase in blood flow and subsequent O2 delivery to enable increased efficiency of the heart; the same may be said for the brain. With an increase in capillaries and branching within the blood vessels of the brain, comes a more efficient system for oxygen delivery which may be neuroprotective in nature by preventing loss of neurons which would otherwise be found on the hypoxic threshold. Also, the improved delivery of nutrients and oxygen to support metabolic demand of the nervous system may allow for an increase in the number of glial cells. Glia are the sole intermediary between blood vessels and neurons making them a key player in sustaining neuronal energy demands. Their importance in terms of functionality have been overlooked in much of early neuroscience.   Just my theory! Open to any discussions."

For instance, it's well known that things like chronic stress, or chronic inflammation promote depression. It's also know, for instance, that chronically elevated cortisol (via stress) promotes hippocampal atrophy.

If a study determined that the smaller hippocampus is a result of persistent stress or that is in fact caused by the depression itself that would be more interesting. Although the stress is probably the culprit, right now there is only correlation.

neuroscience,3bwe6e,Akaliam,2,Thu Jul 2 18:24:38 2015 UTC,"(Source: Bachelor's degree in Neuroscience) Those are called electroencephalography electrodes. Example:   http://bio-medical.com/products/brainet-electrodes.html?gclid=CJL_nM2OvcYCFciFfgodl5AFNQ  They're usually attached to different areas of the scalp with stickers or tape. The part that connects to the scalp is a hollow disk lined with conductive metal, and usually filled with conductive gel when applied to the scalp. These conductive materials pick up on the electrical frequencies coming from the scalp, and send that information to an amplifier. The amplifier turns that faint signal into one a computer can read. You then use that information with computer programs to do a bunch of things.  Other quick note: most go on the scalp, but you also put one electrode on the earlobe and one on the mastoid process (the bone just behind your ear). The earlobe is just skin, and the mastoid process is basically just bone; the computer uses these values to figure out what electrical activity is just interference from bone and skin, and leaves you with just brain activity.  If I may ask, what are you working on that would involve EEG electrodes, but no knowledge of neurology/neuroscience?  Edit: And yes, they are ridiculously expensive."

What struck me was how moving outside the standard grad student/post-doc model (i.e. employing staff scientists) is thoroughly resisted by grant review boards. There is no doubt that junior scientists are being heavily exploited in the current system, and shockingly, it is pretty much a designed mechanism in the funding model.      I recall reading a proposal for an alternative funding model, where money would be given through ""peer credits"". In other words, each scientist would receive a finite number of credits and can award these to other researchers. The more credits you get, the more funding you receive. The idea being that people whose work is creative and likely to have an impact will receive prioritized funding, but still giving more unorthodox or inexperienced researchers a way to get funding. It's also a way of getting around this winner-take-all way of funding research programs that the current grant model favours.

But there is no reason for things in nature to relate so simply to our everyday experience.  That quantum physics isn't easily related to our everyday experience is not a failure of physics, it is simply the reality of the situation.    Trying to shoe-horn a certain way of thinking onto a different topic just because it would make things easier if that way of thinking worked is a great way to get wrong answers.  You need to provide some reason to think that this way of thinking actually tells us something useful about what we are looking at.  But the author doesn't even try to do that.  Further, the way the author talks about thinking about the brain isn't really related to FPGAs, discovering these sorts of ""primitives"" go back well over a century, to the work of Ramon y Cajal in the late 1800s, amongst others.  So I don't see FPGAs really contributing anything other than a name for an established way of thinking.  In terms of the actual operation, FPGAs are really almost completely unlike how the brain works in any substantial way.   If neurons are akin to computer hardware, and behaviors are akin to the actions that a computer performs, computation is likely to be the glue that binds the two.   Those are two big ""ifs"", and I think it is pretty clear that both are false."

But that doesn't make the brain a computer, anymore than the weather is a computer.  ""Brain is a computer"" is just a handy metaphor; see cognitive linguist George Lakoff's great books about the power of metaphors.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff  And having done FPGA work professionally for many years, you're quite right, they don't add a single thing to these discussions. They are a handy way to accelerate digital circuits without having to create a full custom IC. No more.  Their field-upgradability is sometimes very handy but still doesn't enter into it.

neuroscience,3bay3k,wildeye,2,Sat Jun 27 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  And although it is computable, it is barely so.  As I mentioned above, in order to simulate the brain (at least as far as we know now) you need to use coupled systems of non-linear partial differential equations.  Amongst mathematically well-defined problems, this is almost certainly the one that computers are worst at.    Of course there are some things like pattern-matching that are even harder for computers, but that is due to a large part to the fact that these of problems do not have rigorous mathematical solutions to them.  We don't know, mathematically, how to define pattern matching like the brain does.  We do, however, know exactly what a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations is."

My personal belief is that the interesting characteristics of the mind will turn out to be more easily simulated than those difficult issues with the brain, but I might turn out to be wrong.  BTW the technical term ""computable"" isn't about whether something is super slow to compute, like simulations of non-linear partial differential equations (chaotic or not), it's about whether they can be computed at all (on a Turing machine that is not exponential in size/time relative to the input problem size).  Some problems are formally undecidable.

The alternative is that it runs forever without halting.   Here we are asking not a simple question about a prime number or a palindrome, but we are instead turning the tables and asking a Turing machine to answer a question about another Turing machine.

I don't think there are any undecideable problems known outside of theory. The halting problem itself only works because it's based on a logical paradox. I know some quantum stuff is impossible to determine, but it can still be done so probabilistically, and it only is so because it's impossible to get all that information.  If we suppose that every process in physics is decideable, then that means that, by definition, no combination of those processes can be undecideable.  Then another question arises; if there is something undecideable, is there anything in the brain that could possibly rely on it? What possible use could it be to the evolution of the brain that something like that would be necessary?

Lakoff (/ˈleɪkɒf/, born May 24, 1941) is an American cognitive linguist, best known for his thesis that lives of individuals are significantly influenced by the central metaphors they use to explain complex phenomena.  The metaphor thesis, introduced in his 1980 book Metaphors We Live By has found applications in a number of academic disciplines and its application to politics, literature, philosophy and mathematics has led him into territory normally considered basic to political science. In the 1996 book Moral Politics, Lakoff described conservative voters as being influenced by the ""strict father model"" as a central metaphor for such a complex phenomenon as the state and liberal/progressive voters as being influenced by the ""nurturant parent model"" as the folk psychological metaphor for this complex phenomenon. According to him, an individual's experience and attitude towards sociopolitical issues is influenced by being framed in linguistic constructions. In Metaphor and War: The Metaphor System Used to Justify War in the Gulf, he argues that the American involvement in the Gulf war was either obscured or was put a spin on, by the metaphors which were used by the first Bush administration to justify it. Between 2003 and 2008, Lakoff was involved with a progressive think tank, the now defunct Rockridge Institute.   He is a member of the scientific committee of the Fundación IDEAS (IDEAS Foundation), Spain's Socialist Party's think tank.

What is interesting, I think, is the idea that the brain is a computer because it is an information processing device, that performs computations. Now, I know this is different to what people mean when they say computer in common parlance, but I don't think its a vague or uncommon definition in cognitive science or neuroscience, because it's an important part of the computational theory of mind."
neuroscience,3bay3k,NeuroCavalry,-5,Sun Jun 28 09:37:06 2015 UTC,"I think neuroscience could definitely be looked at more from a computer science perspective. Personally, I find what Jeff Hawkins is doing to be pretty interesting and promising, even if there are some problems with it.  While some people will disagree, I seriously doubt the brain is very complex. Sure, there are a lot of neurons and synapses, but that doesn't mean it's complex. A 1 TB solid state hard drive has several trillion transistors, and even more wires, but it's still structured in a very simple way. If you look at the cortex, you see modular structures everywhere. Cortical columns are ubiquitous and nearly identical regardless of there location. Plus, when you consider the fact that the human genome is ~750 MB of data, only ~3% of which is coding DNA, and that only a small portion of that is used in the brain, it seems pretty unlikely that the brain is some inconceivably complex system.  Unfortunately, most neuroscientists aren't computer scientists, and most computer scientists who talk about ""neuroscience"" are basing their work off of outdated information. Modern neural networks and deep learning techniques may be biologically inspired, but still have almost nothing to do with how the brain is known to work. We know that neurons always spike at the same threshold, but that doesn't stop the machine learning people from using models with non-spiking analog neurons. Then, while they probably aren't the majority, on occasion I'll hear neuroscientists talking about how they think the machine learning people have good models, despite them having almost nothing to do with actual biology. The only person I can think of who isn't doing this is Hawkins, but his work is relatively controversial, especially among the machine learning community."
neuroscience,3bay3k,charles2531,6,Sat Jun 27 18:44:00 2015 UTC,"The brain is much more complex than you realize.  There are around 40 voltage-gated potassium channels alone, and a given neuron may have an arbitrary collection of them.  Then you have to add a variety of sodium, calcium, and chloride channels to the mix.  There are dozens of neurotransmitters, and a given neurotransmitter may have multiple different receptors.  Some neurotransmitters even change from being excitatory to inhibitory during development.  The same metabatropic neurotransmitter receptors can act on different ligand-gated ion channels in different neurons.  There are a variety of rectifying and non-rectifying gap junctions and hemichannels, which are made up of multiple subunits that can be mixed and matched to give a wide variety of behaviours.  A given neuron easily has thousands of parameters it can vary, resulting in absolutely massive variety of behaviours.  So yes, although the gross structure of, say, the cortical columns may be similar, the differences in the details of how the neurons in different columns behave is substantial.  Further, the more we learn about neurons, the more complex they turn out to be.  Dale's Law isn't strictly true.  Area release of neurotransmitters, which we only discovered in the last 10-15 years, turns out to be extremely common.  Glia seem to play a more active role than previously thought, although it is still not clear what role they play and how active they really are.  The brain may have seemed pretty simple back in the days of Hodgkin and Huxley, but everything new we learn adds another level of complexity, even at the single-neuron level.   Although computer science can help with studying neurons by helping us build more efficient neurons, I don't see what computer science ways of thinking can help.  The way computers work seems to be more of a hindrance than a help.  The most effective way to simulate neurons is with a set of coupled, non-linear partial differential equations, basically the one well-defined task that computers are worst at doing."
neuroscience,3bay3k,TheBlackCat13,-1,Sat Jun 27 19:21:01 2015 UTC,"What I mean is that computer science can help by giving people more of a data-processing perspective. It's pretty obvious that the brain is an information processing machine. There's absolutely no doubt about that. Looking at it from a point of view of ""what could this mechanism be doing computationally"" could certainly help.  For example, if you look at how neurons behave, you will notice that they have very sparse activations, and in many cases react to specific patterns. This is the exact same principle that sparse distributed representations and bloom filters are based on, which are forms of probabilistic memory. When looking at properties of human memory, and properties of probabilistic memory, there can be some interesting similarities.  I'm not saying we need to see the brain as having a CPU and RAM, or similar analogous features to a computer. What I'm saying is that some of the theory of information processing integral to computer science could definitely help in neuroscience.  I know the brain is pretty complex, but that doesn't mean it's far beyond human comprehension. If you look at anything close enough, it gets pretty complex. That doesn't mean it follows insanely complex rules though. If you want to create a physics simulation, you could hypothetically simulate everything on the atomic level if you really wanted to, and it certainly would be pretty accurate, but that doesn't mean that everything needs to be simulated on that level to be even close to reality. Likewise, it's pretty unlikely that every little detail in the brain is absolutely necessary to create a basic model of it. If that was the case, and every little feature needed to be in place for it to work, it's pretty unlikely that it would have evolved at all."
neuroscience,3bay3k,charles2531,4,Sat Jun 27 19:50:24 2015 UTC,"It may be a bias from being in sensory neuroscience, but I don't know anyone who doesn't  look at the brain from a data-processing perspective.  I know there are some pretty low-level folks out there that are primarily interested in the intricacies of particular ion channels (I don't know them personally, but I know they exist), and certain areas that have eventually more or less given up on the data-processing angle after trying it for decades (cough cerebellum cough).  But a very big chunk of neuroscientists are ""looking at it from a point of view of what could this mechanism be doing computationally"", and looking at the history of the field this has always been the case.  It is certainly the baiss for many very prominent areas of neuroscience, for example sensory neuroscience, hippocampal place cells, and dendritic spines.  As for whether every detail is needed or it is possible to do a much higher level simulation, that remains to be seen.  Neuroscientists are certainly hoping a higher-level simulation is possible, but whether it actually is remains to be seen.  Evolution works by building on what is already there, adding to and tweaking existing things to do something new and different.  Evolution is not concerned with keeping things logical, well-organized, or based on higher-level abstractions.  That is how humans work, but it doesn't seem to be how biology works.    Falling into the trap of trying to shoe-horn biology to match human ways of solving problems has proven to be a major problem in biology.  In fact it was one of the first things they tried to teach us not to do when I first entered my biomedical engineering undergrad program.  It is a very, very easy mistake to make, but one that has led to all sorts of errors and even medical mistakes.  For example the first artificial knees were just hinges.  That is how humans build joints, so it makes sense that this is how the knee would work too.  But the knee wasn't build by humans, and it doesn't actually act like a hinge, so the people who got these implants had a really hard time walking.  Easier than without a knee at all, but still bad."
neuroscience,3bay3k,TheBlackCat13,-1,Sat Jun 27 21:36:23 2015 UTC,"At the same time, I don't see a lot of people who seem to be trying to piece it all together. Everyone seems to just be looking for more details. Jeff Hawkins and the other people at Numenta are doing some interesting stuff, and I think their HTM model is pretty interesting and a lot more biologically plausible than any other models I've seen. Unfortunately they do have some problems with it, mainly that they can't get it to generate behavior. I think this is mainly because there's no way to bias neurons towards activating under certain conditions. From my research, it certainly appears that this is what the basal ganglia is doing, but Hawkins can be pretty stubborn and refuses to talk about it. There was a paper on PLOS ONE (I can't find it right now unfortunately), that actually showed that adding a simple model of the basal ganglia could allow it to generate behavior, but I don't think Hawkins took notice. It could certainly be that the cerebellum suffers from a similar problem; we don't know exactly what problem it's solving yet. If that's the case, it may not be as difficult to model as it appears; it's just that no one knows how it's used.  Of course, HTM is based entirely off of probabilistic memory types, which are almost never used in computer science. From how it sounds, they are used in a small number of tasks, but otherwise remain to be taught as a toy algorithm; they have interesting properties, but no one really comes across many cases to use them. Regardless, they do have a lot of interesting properties that make them seem very comparable to human memory, and only work well with sparse activity, which is something noted to be extremely common in the brain. It could certainly be that this is what the brain is doing, but most computer scientists know little to nothing about it.  What I'm suggesting is that looking at it from a traditional computer science angle is definitely not a good idea, but there are some obscure areas of computer science that, combined with some information theory, might be able to answer some questions. I think the main approach of comparing the brain to artificial neural networks is deeply flawed because of how vastly different they are from actual biology, but regardless I still hear neuroscientists on occasion talking about them and how ""the computer scientists say this is how the brain works, and they know more about this than we do, so they're probably right."" I've even got a neuroscience textbook (Principles of Neural Science, 5th edition) that has an entire chapter devoted to this.  Like I said, the brain isn't a computer in the traditional sense. There are some huge differences. Regardless, a lot of the fundamental theory about computers, mainly fundamental information processing, may still be helpful. It would probably have to be adapted to fit the brain, but I think the most basic principles can still apply. Regardless of how different they are, all information processing systems are going to have things in common. A lot of what could be potentially useful is fairly obscure and barely studied, but there's no reason it can't be improved upon to better solve this problem.  I certainly agree with your other points. If you look at how computer memory works, it's pretty straightforward. If you try to implement it though, even with humans designing it it still effectively becomes a tower of duct tape. I think any system will eventually have to get insanely complex to try to do even a simple task on large scales and with a limited set of tools. There's no correlation between complexity of the principles something is based off of, and how complex the implementation is.  I agree with a lot of your points. I'm just trying to say that really basic information theory can still be useful. The brain just likely operates on a vastly different computing paradigm if you will. I'm sorry if I just don't get my points across terribly well."

Regardless, if you are concerned about it you should contact a medical professional for help (I saw you mentioned a therapist), since they are trained professionals and will know the best for helping you. It's their job to help people in these situations!  A quick Google search brought up an article suggesting there was no link While another brought up a peer reviewed study suggesting a correlation between cannabis use and schizophrenia  If any fellow redditors know any more about this they will probably be more helpful! Best of luck and keep your head up!"
neuroscience,3b944e,theBlinkKing,5,Sat Jun 27 03:46:08 2015 UTC,"The linked article is quite intriguing. It made me think whether its possible that the marijuana use is increasing my tendency to 'dialogue' with myself - maybe if not shizophrenia, but a related branch of mental illness. I feel encouraged to discuss with my health care professional in more detail.  Thank you for the comment!"
neuroscience,3b944e,dude2dudette,3,Sat Jun 27 05:33:41 2015 UTC,"With regards to why various studies seem to find varying links between Cannabis use and both positive and negative effects is covered partially in this video by C0nc0dance. Essentially, different strains of cannabis have different levels of THC (CB1 agonist) and CBD (CB1 antagonist) as well as various other exogenous cannabinoids. This unpredictability of proportion or even exact type of cannabinoid profile is likely what leads to such varied findings.   I know it isn't exactly the same, but it would be similar to testing morphine and codeine as if they were the exact same drug, when, in fact, the latter requires an enzyme which is limited in the liver to convert it to morphine, causing it to have shorter, weaker effects. If they just happened to be called 'brain number haze' and 'blissful releif kush' respectively and assumed that they were just different 'strains' under the main term 'opiates', things would be quite different. We would just continue doing research using both types of drug calling it 'opiate research' and assuming that different strains could all lead to the same conclusions. I hope that this analogy (however crude) helps illustrate one of the reasons that studies into cannabis use rarely lead to similar conclusions."
neuroscience,3b944e,orthodox_caveman,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:30:28 2015 UTC,"This is probably correct. Most basic research relies on pure THC which is well documented to cause schizophrenia like symptoms. However, the plant is not purely THC, there are other less studied active ingredients that modify the effect of THC. This makes sense at the molecular level, as THC is a strong agonist of the CB1 receptor but the next most abundant cannabinoid, cannabinol, is an inverse agonist. Thus, the natural mixture is a lot more complicated."

neuroscience,3b944e,psychonauto,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:20:24 2015 UTC,"No problem. It's actually only something I started to think about earlier this year when I had part of a module at university on the dopamine hypothesis, and other, linked hypotheses regarding how it is we feel pleasure and want. The 3 systems we learnt about were the Dopamine (DA) system, the opiate system and the cannabinoid system and my lecturer started speaking about how different drugs which act on the same systems alter biochemical proceses somewhat differently (cf. Cocaine and Amphetamines for DA). It wasn't a huge jump to think about how different subtypes might work differently."
neuroscience,3b944e,psychonauto,2,Tue Jun 30 06:45:47 2015 UTC,"I'm in a very similar situation. I am going into my third year in college, and started smoking almost a year ago now, I believe marijuana has helped me with various psychological issues that I won't get into, and I can absolutely sympathize with you in that smoking has helped me identify my negative patterns of thinking, and have tons of introspective revelations.   On the topic of psychosis, I also have a dialog with myself frequently, and I talk to myself when others aren't around. I've been this way my whole life though, and I don't think smoking increased it or anything (I don't know if it could  have been increased any more, I've always had an over-thinking problem). My understanding of schizophrenia is that its two basic components are disorganized thinking and delusions of any kind. I am always keeping a close watch on myself to see if either of those things come up, and so far they have not. My aunt has schizophrenia, so I have a bit of a genetic risk as well.  If you don't mind me asking, was your panic-attack marijuana related? Also are you taking SSRIs and smoking at the same time? I've never taken SSRIs (I probably would be a candidate though due to depression), but I did try molly once, which I'm guessing feels like a short but intense burst of whatever SSRIs feels like."
neuroscience,3b944e,psychonauto,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:06:13 2015 UTC,"No actually, the panic attack was actually because I connected my talking to my self to schizophrenia- though I did smoke the previous night.  Yes, I am on SSRIs. I've also tried molly and SSRIs aren't a joy ride or anything. It kind of dulls my thinking down and also makes me drowsy non stop.  It's good to know that there is someone with similar situation! If you don't mind, can you tell me  little more about the self talking?  (You can inbox me as well)"
neuroscience,3b944e,kidneysforsale,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:57:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's good we found eachother! I'm fine with discussing it here rather than inboxing if you are too.  I believe I live my life in an overly conscious and verbal way. This grew exponentially in late high school, after a period of intense anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. For example, whenever I make a decision, even a little one like how I should spend my free time, I have an internal dialog in order to ""problem-solve"" what to do. Sometimes this just ends up wasting time and producing anxiety because I just end up sitting down and thinking, non-stop, rather than spending my time doing anything fun or productive. This is the over-thinking I was talking about. I eventually learned that if I could get myself to a place where I felt comfortable talking to myself, I could speak this dialog rather than thinking it. One of the most comforting things for me is to go on a walk in a desolate area in the middle of the night when not a single soul is around, and to just talk to myself the whole time. Speaking my thoughts out loud helps me stay on track and find the solution to whatever introspective problem I'm dealing with at the moment.  Have you ever seen the movie A Beautiful Mind? Its my favorite movie, and I could fit it into this conversation so well but I don't want to unless you've seen it for the sake of spoilers haha.  Whenever I have a revelation while high, I feel more in touch with reality in a very deep way. Sometimes I write down my thoughts and read them while sober, and I am almost always amazed by the philosophical and psychological ideas I came up with. Why do you link having revelations and talking to yourself to being schizophrenic? You said it yourself that you aren't speaking to a delusion. Do you feel like you are losing a grasp of reality in some way?"
neuroscience,3b944e,psychonauto,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:35:30 2015 UTC,"I have seen A Beautiful Mind, and I see where you're going with it :D I do very similar things when I overthink. For example, if I obsess over efficiency and what the 'best' thing to do would be given the circumstance. It drives me crazy sometimes and I almost often just force myself into doing something that I am actually don't want to do.   I also write stuff down when I'm high! Sometimes its related to neuroscience or just some philosophical realization. For the past 2 months or so, I acted as my own 'psychoanalyst' and became more aware of myself. And yes, I agree I feel more in touch with reality. The mornings after a sesh everything feels so relaxed and lucid. The 'revelations', as we call it, felt and continue to feel so real to me that I decided to even make a symbol of it and got a tattoo of it.  With regard to your last question, it's mostly because my sister has schizophrenia and I realized I have been having similar symptoms prior to her transition into full schizophrenia. But also, my social anxiety can be magnified (often when I'm high -also depends on the type of weed) and I get a little paranoid."

neuroscience,3b3lxg,CarbonFire3DPrints,6,Thu Jun 25 18:14:22 2015 UTC,"Yes. Kinda. :) The most brain-like image, at least anatomically, is a T1-weighted image (MPRAGE is a pretty common sequence). You should be able to get the DICOMS -- this is the image file format -- from the scanner tech, but some places are reluctant to share them for some reason. I'd just bring a flash drive  and ask. Then you need some software that can read DICOM format, either to generate a mesh directly from those data or to convert it to another format (e.g. NIfTI). I primarily work with NIfTI format files, and have some python code that can import them into blender, which is just generally awesome. It can also export STL, which is pretty common for 3D printing. I've used blender to generate STL files for this purpose before, but haven't tried a whole brain yet.   Anyway, if you're interested in the fMRI results, those will not be DICOM (probably NIfTI or ANALYZE if it's a research place), much lower resolution, and generally in the form of a z-statistic map, so you get blobs of where activity is. You might be able to get them to dump both the T1 (ask for the skull-stripped version) and z-map onto your flash drive and pick it up later. If the images are co-registered, that'd make your life easier, so ask for it!   What else? Oh, software: blender, dcm2nii (if you get DICOMs; just to convert to .nii), nibabel (for working with the images in python), and FSL is quite handy for thresholding images. The whole thing can be a bit involved, though, as I mentioned, I have some code for importing NIfTI files into blender, so if you have a brain and an activation blob it can automagically import them, give them materials and colors and so forth. All of which is free! My code isn't really ready for prime time yet, but hopefully in the next week or so.  Your friend's idea is cool, but brain imaging is not often commensurate with cheap and portable (giant superconductors, you know). I could imagine an fNIRS setup with a template brain to use as a background, though.... still not cheap, exactly, but cheaper. HTH!"

Anyway, yeah, just let me know where I can find your files and I can hook you up with an stl or 2. But what do you want to see? If it's just your brain (which is pretty cool, IMHO), that's cake. You mentioned fMRI, though, and showing activation is trickier. For the most part, 3d printing is a single color, so you'd have to color the activation pattern after printing somehow. I could make those areas raised above the cortical surface a bit, but you'd still need to be able to distinguish between them and brain... might not be too hard."

neuroscience,3b3lxg,curly_haired_freak,2,Sun Jun 28 18:46:51 2015 UTC,"So, it looks like they got scans that have pretty good resolution in one dimension, but not so good in the others. Particularly for the T1 it's nice to see 1mm isotropic (that is, each little cube of data is 1mm on a side), but you've got two that are acquired with the best resolution along different axes. This is not uncommon with clinical scans, but poses some challenges for doing what you want to do. If I have some time in the next couple of days I'll see if I can combine them.  As to how things look, usually there isn't much to tell from just looking (unless there's a tumor or something), so some analysis would have to be done. I expect that's they're up to right now."

Why would ""voluntary"" muscle movement be more evolutionarily advantageous than non-""voluntary"" movement, for a start?   Here is my take:  It isn't that voluntary muscle movement was evolutionarily advantageous, it could be that, as societies (communities) began to form out of the smaller groups, they spent less time hunting (involuntary motor movements) and more time doing things that took a deliberate, planned motor action (such as fine motor action sequences like cooking an intricate meal). Consciousness, I believe Morsella might say, evolved to supplement the brain in signal relay necessary for these voluntary, planned motor action sequences.

Slightly longer version: we have vague ideas about mechanisms and chemicals in the brain that we've stumbled upon, usually through studying the effects of some biological compound. Then we tinker with that biological compound to make it more digestible, etc. and make up a story about how it effects the brain and hope that's really what's going on.  In reality, we don't understand the full chain of events that leads from a drug binding to a receptor to whatever overt effect it causes. For example: lithium is one of the main drugs prescribed for bipolar disorder. There is no good mechanistic explanation why this works, but it does.  We are woefully far away from being able to predict what a drug will do the human body. We can barely predict where and how a drug will bind to a protein"

Negative resting potential is actually a confusing concept.  Mainly, because things are not negative in the sense that they have a bunch of negative ions floating around. A more accurate term would be ""less positive"".  So inside the cell you have X mM of positive ions (Ca2+, K+, Na+), and outside the cell you have 2X mM of these ions (which is established through ion pumps).  So the inside of the cell is still positive, just not as positive as the outside. Compared to ground, they are both positive. Compared to each other, one is relatively negative.

You now have a list of 10-1000 companies that are in some way related to neuro.  There are LOTS of 6-figure salaries to be made in neuro."

neuroscience,3atsif,Fruitforthought,3,Tue Jun 23 17:50:14 2015 UTC,"Certification for what? A job at those companies? Of course not.  I know people who do customer support, marketing, communications, sales, and various tech roles at these types of companies, and none of them have any ""certifications"". (Though obviously some of the more advanced roles do require a bit of experience... but the entry-level roles do not.)  The only people with ""certifications"" are the people in legal, regulatory, engineering, senior leadership... and that's all I can think of off the top of my head. The other jobs are open-season."

neuroscience,3atsif,neuro_neurd,10,Tue Jun 23 17:50:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Neuroscience is a great degree to get before you go into some sort of science career - Medicine, research (ie., tech positions which don't need grad school), etc.   It's not computer science or business, but it's way better than anything in the social sciences.  Most degrees nowadays are what you make of them, anyway.  Very few guarantee you a job without putting in some effort to market yourself & your skills.  Edit:   1) I just remembered a job talk I went to, targeted to neuro and bio undergrads, that was for positions at biotech & pharma companies.  No advanced degree required.  So, maybe look into that?  2) for those that think you can't support yourself on a tech salary, tell that to all the techs/lab managers I know that have worked happily at their jobs for years (ours just celebrated 25 years with the current PI).  She makes 65k+."
neuroscience,3atsif,ForScale,-5,Tue Jun 23 13:51:11 2015 UTC,Yeah maybe if you have someone supporting you financially throughout your process of self promotion and self discovery. You can't support yourself with a tech position. It's like I've been indentured into some kind of slave industry. BS tech and lab assistant positions are a joke.
neuroscience,3atsif,Fap_Slap,4,Tue Jun 23 14:25:04 2015 UTC,"You can certainly support yourself for a few years after college with a PRA position. I've never seen one less than 35k a year, plus full benefits and vacation time. In 2015 that's a pretty decent gig fresh out of college and you can use the experience to prepare for grad school. If you really didn't want to keep moving with higher education though, neuroscience probably is a bunk major."
neuroscience,3atsif,rusharz,0,Tue Jun 23 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"Excellent, straight forward useful advice. Thank you."
neuroscience,3atsif,Fap_Slap,2,Tue Jun 23 16:34:12 2015 UTC,He's right. Neuro isn't a BSc degree that is made to clearly lead directly to a career the way an engineering degree would.  It leads places - many good places - but it's not a short nor direct route.
neuroscience,3atsif,seth106,-2,Tue Jun 23 17:31:35 2015 UTC,So patience is the key you say? How philosophical.

If you're concerned about money, you're probably far better off going in to something health science related like pharmacy/dentistry/medicine. Even going in to a branch of psych (clinical, forensic, educational etc) is probably more realistic.

I was in graduate school for 6 years and started at USD$26,500 and the stipend increased by ~$500/yr. This was doable even in the SF Bay Area with roommates. Good luck."
neuroscience,3atsif,seth106,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:33:20 2015 UTC,"Dude... plenty of people have the intellectual curiosity... Those programs are hyper competitive though.

neuroscience,3atsif,ForScale,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:01:52 2015 UTC,"There are a LOT of graduate programs and I doubt they're all highly competitive. My experience is only in the US and it's true that I don't know what the stipends are for less competitive programs but I think most neuroscience PhD programs in the US offer tuition remittance and a stipend.   Having been through it, I do think that ""fit"" is really important with someone you'll be working closely with/slaving under for the next 5+ years and whose opinions of you are fairly important regarding your success in the program and beyond. Some reasons may be arbitrary (""oh cool, this guy likes cycling and so do I!"") and some are less arbitrary (corresponding senses of work ethic, work-life balance, scientific approach, etc.) Everyone ""fits"" better with some people than others but if you didn't fit well with the programs you checked out, it's probably good you didn't attend them. It's a big bummer to figure out the fit bit after the fact, particularly if you've made significant life changes to join the grad program.  edit: Also, my statement about his/her possible lack of intellectual curiosity comes from his/her consideration of their degree in neuroscience a complete waste of time. If I value the knowledge I gain from a pursuit and, esp if it has triggered even more of a desire to learn, it has not been a complete waste of time. Sure, a lot more than intellectual curiosity is required to succeed in a PhD program but I'd say it's a most basic requirement."

I mean, maybe there are some fluff one's out there just looking to train anybody in neuroscience, but from what I've seen that doesn't seem to be the case.   I think most neuroscience PhD programs in the US offer tuition remittance and a stipend.   That just adds to the competitiveness, right? They don't want to just fund anybody who's curious about the brain.    Sure, a lot more than intellectual curiosity is required to succeed in a PhD program but I'd say it's a most basic requirement.   Yeah, I think we're in a agreement there. I guess I was thinking that OP entered in to and made it through a BS program in neurosci... He's gotta be at least somewhat intellectually curious about it all, right?

Lying professors, manipulators, slave drivers, deception, IT students being 'zombies' because they choose their major to make money (which is what you want...?)... Oh man.    What have you done to improve your marketable skills?"
neuroscience,3atsif,Doc_Nag_Idea_Man,-3,Thu Jun 25 01:07:00 2015 UTC,You have to be sensational to garner a response. Look at the discussion I've fostered. I'm not a fool.
neuroscience,3atsif,goodygood_274,3,Tue Jun 23 16:41:17 2015 UTC,"You started the discussion by attacking what the people here love. You can't honestly think that makes you clever in any sense. It's very true that making your way in neuroscience is rough and does not offer any instant gratification, but the same is true for the vast majority of sciences. Based on your responses, you hardly looked into your prospects post grad. You haven't mentioned a single end goal other than ""something I could support myself with like my professors said I would"". That's not an answer. What specifically did you want to be? What interested you about neuroscience in the first place? Lab tech jobs are typically low paying grunt work but that's where everyone has to start. Did you think they'd just give you your own lab and a bag of gold coins right out of school?  It's perfectly fine to not know what you want to do with the rest of your life, but don't blame this professor who is trying to market the field for your struggle. Yeah, he shouldn't have said you'd be scrooge mcducking right out of college because that's just not true, but this is more on your shoulders. Just because one guy showed up and said you could be huge doesn't absolve you of anything. If you don't like the field, suck it up and learn something else. Most employers value skills and experience over your college major anyway, so learn to do something that someone will pay you well to do. For the most part, people go into the sciences for the science, not the money because the money is pretty terrible. Sadly, the US doesn't revere scientists and doctors like it once did. They tend to be overworked and sorely underpaid, but they do it because they love it. And if they don't love it, they do it because it's a job. Complain if you want, I know I certainly have, but don't go offending people because life didn't give you what you wanted."
neuroscience,3atsif,Doc_Nag_Idea_Man,0,Tue Jun 23 17:19:48 2015 UTC,"You cannot honestly think that I believed I was going to get gold coins right?

neuroscience,3atsif,goodygood_274,2,Tue Jun 23 18:29:55 2015 UTC,"And that's fine! As far as I can tell, most people don't know what they want to do, and of those that do, only a handful actually get to do it. Chances are things aren't going to be great for a while. You'll struggle some more to make ends meet. I won't pretend to know anything about you or your situation, but I'm going to guess that you're like me, early-mid 20s with a fairly vague degree, a hungry bank account, and lofty goals of getting into a particular industry.   What makes you think you're too good for anything?   Everyone has a degree these days. If you're unemployed, find a temporary job. Wait tables, work retail, anything. You might get a connection or two out of it. People know people. Try to get one of those lab tech jobs you spoke so poorly of. It's a foot in the door. A lot of university owned and private labs will help pay for a higher degree. Try to intern somewhere. Entry level jobs are not glamorous. They will test your patience and your resolve, but if you do the work, you will be rewarded."

neuroscience,3atsif,no_notthistime,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:39:24 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is, playing the victim isn't advancing you towards your goals.   I worked as a tech for 4 years, and made enough to live on.  I really started hating it towards the end, and decided against grad school, so I quit.  I hiked the Appalachian trail, then worked at fedex loading trucks for a year, and now I'm heading to wilderness EMT school in a few weeks.  After that, I'm not sure what's next, maybe park ranger, paramedic, physicians assistant... I'm not sure.  Either way, the neuro BA will help me.  Every step of the way, people are impressed by the degree (whether that is valid or not is another point.).  It's going to help me in EMT school, and any ensuing medical occupation.  If I want to be a park ranger, it's a biology degree at its core, so it will assist me in landing that job.  If I want to do anything else, people will see that on my resume, and know that I have a background in a technical science, and therefore critical thinking and problem solving.  Not to mention that it sounds fancy, which helps (although it probably shouldn't...)  Tech jobs can be excruciating in many ways, but there are tons of different tech jobs.  Tissue culture, behavioral assays, human imaging, psychology/mental illness testing (with imaging and such), computer oriented programming... The list goes on.  There's also industry, which gives you the option to climb the corporate ladder into management.  You could be a clinical research associate, and work for a company assessing clinical research programs.  You could audit labs.  You could get into sales and sell equipment and laboratory supplies or drugs to doctors. Go work for Lumosity or some other similar company.  Ophthalmology, pharmacy, nursing.  Shit, there's tons of options in which a neuro degree would be advantageous.  You're not screwed.  Essentially no one makes six figures straight out of college.  A high salary is something you work towards, not something you are entitled to.  Do things to help you get the job you want.

neuroscience,3atsif,no_notthistime,8,Wed Jun 24 02:25:56 2015 UTC,"Hey!   What kind of responses do you think you're gonna get here? This is /r/neuroscience. You know that...  Anyway, check this, I majored in psychology and then education/counseling. With an MS degree, I'm in like the top 10% of most educated people in the US... and you know what? I think it was largely a waste of time and money! I agree with you!  If you're like me, you came up in the generation and geographical space where education was touted as something that was always good. There was no consideration given to the fact that certain educations may not be very useful/practical. ""Just go to college! Study what interests you! It will pay off!!""  I honestly feel that I really fucked up and was encouraged to do so. People still try to tell me it wasn't a mistake.   Anyway, yeah, psychology and neuroscience (I had a concentration in behavioral neuroscience when I was in undergrad... worked along side ""prestigious"" professors in multiple labs...) is interesting but not practical, as you know.  I very much agree with you that many people in the fields (psych/neuroscience) are pretentious and think that knowing esoteric terms and philosophical buzzwords makes them better than others. I think they're really just nervous about their job prospects. ;)  Anyway, overall, I hear you! I very much agree! As someone with a master or science degree in education, I think we need to change how we approach education and need to do more with regard to practicality and less with regard to ""what interests you."" We need to stop doing the youth in the US a major disservice by encouraging them to pursue degrees that don't amount to shit!  Finally, with IT, you can teach yourself a bunch of stuff online for free. I've been at html/css/javascript for like a year now and I love it! I've started applying to junior web developer jobs. I've thought about/done a bit with coding a therapy bot and developing simple AI programs.  I'm sorry this has been our experience, we just have to try to make the most of it, I suppose."

Honestly, I feel your pain.   so you're saying I should take programming classes   I mean... if it's something that *you find interesting and that you think you have a reasonable chance of making money at (if that's your goal). Here's a great place to start: http://www.codecademy.com/ Plenty of support here on reddit too. Seems to be an in demand skill set...  I just really enjoy design and programming. And it seems to be a pretty in demand area... with decent salary prospects. I know now that I should have studied IT or CS or web development... maybe all three kind of thing... in school; just gotten a BS degree in CS.  Anyway yeah, if money is your primary concern right now, I suggest sales. I kind of hate sales, but I've done it. I've sold power equipment, hair products, roofing supplies... I even sold cell phones with a master's degree. People we're really funny. ""Dude! You should be like a principal or dean or something! And stop psychoanalyzing me!"" :) But yeah, sales fields are kind of cut throat, easy enough to get in to with any kind of bachelor's degree though. And I liked learning about the various products. I really liked the cell phones! I like tech.  But yeah, overall, I really dig the design/programming stuff and I haven't paid a dime to learn any of it! And like I said, after about a year now, I've started applying to some entry level stuff... nothing yet, but I learn something new almost every day and meet cool people online here who have a passion for it and know how to go about landing a job in the field. Other than that... it's kind of sales if you want to make some money...  And the stats still say that having a bachelor's is better than not having one in terms of total life-time earnings. So there's a little bit of silver lining there."

Neuro is a great field, but the job market is tough (it was even worse a few years ago when I was still in grad school).   My own academic experience has all happened at large state universities, and I feel like a lot of students have very similar experiences to yours.

Neuroscience is definitely not a great track if you're not deeply interested in research or medical school. You can make it work in other fields if you combined it with a pretty strong computer science background, or maybe migrate to another bio field. I think you do need to come to terms with a future of pursuing a higher degree, though.   It was absolutely irresponsible for your instructor to suggest you'd be earning six figures out of the box with just a BS.

neuroscience,3aq087,RyBry,4,Mon Jun 22 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"Music Therapy is booming in the US and UK (I'm assuming that you're US-based?) So glad that you've taken interest!  Firstly, You must obtain a Masters of Music Therapy before you can apply for a PhD in the subject. This requires getting into one of the programs, of which there are hundreds. Here's a comprehensive list;   https://netforum.avectra.com/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=amta2&WebCode=OrgSearch  Here's the kicker, though; music therapy is more music than neuroscience. That said, the field needs more researchers, but you have to pass a rather rigorous set of music auditions to get into music therapy school. Most involve auditions in voice, piano, guitar, and a separate ""primary"" instrument. A few colleges, in fact, only accept those holding bachelors degrees in music or music education, but thats the exception.   So, secondly, I would practice up or take a few semesters of music courses, then go ahead and apply. Some of the places I applied to include NYU, Leslie University, and Florida State. NYU and FSU both have great research centers for it, and there are a lot out west, too. Newcastle upon Tyne (English Uni) is breaking some ground, also.   Thirdly, music therapy research is highly competitive, and most already hold a masters in the subject before they can even get on board.  Fourthly, DO YOUR RESEARCH. The Music Therapy field is very niche, and has a whole lot of information, controversy, and general information that any person who wants to get into it needs to know. I recommend reading through the entirety of the American Music Therapy Association website, along with their affiliated blogs. Also, talk to a music therapist; you may find that it's not at all what you think it is, or you may find that it's 1,000 times better than you think it is.   If you purely want to research it and not practice it, you may want to apply to Neuro PhD programs and concentrate on music/rhythm cognition."
neuroscience,3aq087,williamtheconcurrer,3,Mon Jun 22 23:03:46 2015 UTC,"You may want to try r/musictherapy. I'm studying music therapy at Appalachian State University as a master's equivalency student. The program is amazing. I'm very interested in the neurological music therapy (NMT) techniques. Specifically rhythmic auditory simulation (RAS) - used to help people who need gait training, e.g. people with Parkinson's disease. The main schools I think of off hand for NMT are University of Miami and Colorado University. Michael Thaut is the music therapy authority on NMT. He's a professor in music and in neuroscience. Baker and Tamplin also have a good book (Music Therapy Methods in Neurorehabilitation). The neuroscience in probably all NMT books would be stuff you already know but the way the music functions will likely be new information.   All that being said, a music therapist does have to meet potentially daunting requirements and proficiencies to the beginner musician. However, if you begin conversations with music therapy faculty, they would warmly welcome you and aid in your musical preparations. If you'd like to talk through anything else, let me know.

neuroscience,3an9yk,TheHouseOfMySoul,2,Sun Jun 21 22:06:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not a neuroscientist, but perhaps I can take a shot at this. Consciousness exists on a sliding scale, rather than being like an on-off switch. At the one end of the scale you have extreme alertness and other the other end is deep sleep. But even in sleep you have a slight level of awareness. If you track people's brainwaves during sleep, the brainwaves associated with alertness (beta, in particular) are still present, but just at a lower level. Think of it like closing the curtains to make your room dark and still being able to see a bit, rather than closing the curtains making your room absolutely without light."
neuroscience,3an9yk,adoarns,2,Sun Jun 21 23:06:02 2015 UTC,"Assuming consciousness is mediated entirely by the brain (this is a widely but not unanimously held assumption), then it depends very much on the parameters of the physical brain at any one time. Which implies that a consciousness cannot be replaced with another one in a meaningful sense without significantly changing the configuration of the brain.  Ultimately the question of whether two consciousnesses are identical or not is metaphysical. We usually choose to regard consciousnesses as identical when they occur attached to the ""same"" brain and the ""same"" body at different points in time. One possible exception is in the case of people who undergo substantial changes in personality and/or mental ability due to brain injury or degeneration. Eg, ""he's like a different person entirely after the car crash."" This buys into the basic assumption above, because in these cases there typically has been a significant change in brain configuration.  What do I mean about brain configuration? Well, that isn't all clear, either. It seems to involve the set of synaptic connections between neurons as well as the strengths of those synaptic connections, as well as ongoing dynamic changes in oscillatory signalling between different groups of neurons."
neuroscience,3an9yk,subs_innominata,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:53:23 2015 UTC,"Short answer: There are many good leads toward answering these questions, but we need more data and more accurate models to know for sure.  'Consciousness' per se does not have an agreed-upon definition in the neuroscientific community. It is often treated as an aggregate of behavior consisting of a 'central executive' which presides over attention, memory, goals, etc. This is because these properties can be demonstrated and studied in animal models. The exact role played by subsystems in the brain in each of these processes is the area of research you should examine more closely."

Harre takes a cue from Witgenstein and claims that ""person grammars"" operate under different assumptions and rules from the ""molecule grammar"".

It is very natural to speak of cats using their tails to balance, of birds using their wings to fly, and of humans using their hands to hold on to things.

neuroscience,39ie76,tonk,3,Fri Jun 12 11:14:44 2015 UTC,"I'm no scientist, just a mere undergrad, but I've heard a few lectures on sleep and thought that maybe my quick,  loose explanation may help ease your concerns as far as the scientific understanding of sleep goes.   Essentially,  the rate of release of various neurotransmitters (brain chemicals that enable various brain processes) shift according to a specific ~90 min cycle that repeats throughout each sleep session. Brain waves (electrical transmission between neurons) go through several stages of slower-wave synchronization before returning to a more wake-like desynchronized state known as REM (rapid eye movement) where more complex dreaming is most likely to occur. These experiences are poorly remembered, however, most likely due to a corresponding decrease in norepinephrine, a NT which is important in memory formation. Basically, while sleep is a very different brain state then waking consciousness, it is still a complex, evolutionarily-organized process that is a part of being alive and,  in that itself,  quite unlike biological death (which would include an absence of brain activity).  I'm sure there are many more well-educated people here who could explain it much more accurately than me, but I hope this helps in some way."
neuroscience,39ie76,jibenotjive,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:35:04 2015 UTC,"You're pretty much spot on. A couple of things I would add, is that there is some research to suggest that sleep allows us to ""clean up"" the waste products of our brains metabolic functions (source, sorry for paywall :/  http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6156/373).   There's also some research to suggest that sleep helps us to consolidate memories, and forget those that are not as important (again, paywall, sorry! http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945214000598). Some speculate that a reason we don't usually remember our dreams is because the random firing is related to the process of forgetting memories we have no use for (for example, you don't really have any need to remember what you ate for lunch two months ago, so it's a better use of resources to forget this information). Remembering your dreams may actually inhibit this forgetting process.  To answer you question of consciousness, I don't have a source as it would be a difficult concept to study scientifically, but I think we can infer that it's the same consciousness as our waking selves. We often have dreams that are directly relevant to our waking lives (although there is still an intense debate as to whether these are just random firings or some deeper cognitive driven process). I think another strong bit of evidence to corroborate the same consciousness would come from studies on lucid dreaming (http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/dreaming/Lucidity%20Institute%20Research%20Papers.pdf#page=163)."

Longer answer: This is because we actually do have brain activity in our sleep. As a matter of fact, the brain is very active. Just not in the way it is during wakefulness. This image shows some of the measured brain activity from EEGs.   I believe that to be neurologically dead, our brain should show no activity. Or at least an amount of activity below a certain threshold. This is most certainly not the way during sleep.  I'm pretty sure that we are not even considered brain-dead if we're in a coma.

Let me put it this way, you don't choose a PhD in 'neuroscience' or a PhD in 'cogsci'. You choose a PhD with a particular supervisor, researching a particular question which can straddle one or more disciplines.  It's worth pointing out that neuroscience and cogsci have significant overlaps, and how much they have in common entirely depends on who you ask! ... I would like to think there's a fair few people here who identify as both."
neuroscience,3992nm,Grey_Matters,5,Wed Jun 10 08:38:28 2015 UTC,"This is a good post.   It's probably easiest to consider it as a gradient. I myself started out as a cognitive psychologist, focusing on theoretical models to better understand cognition. This involved experimental designs that focused on cognition rather than the brain itself. After that, I switched to molecular neurobiology where I studied the functioning of neurons, neural networks, knockout mouse models, etc. All of this involved directly measuring/manipulating parts of the brain (regions, neurons), yet we did not necessarily care about the underlying cognition. The key thing to understand is that these are simply two (partially overlapping) approaches to better understand nature. Cognitive neuroscience essentially utilizes both approaches, although the degree can differ from topic to topic.  As noted by /u/amadeus_x (here) the skill sets can vary accordingly, as the different approaches require different skills, but that is true for any field. For example, I learned how to program during both cognitive psychology and neuroscience. The difference for me was that the psychological research was more useful for mastering methodology whereas neuroscience offered a lot of practical hands-on skills (PCR, immunoblots, mouse perfusion, cell culturing, MRI, etc.).

As happy as everyone else is, he is sad. As much pleasure as the town has, he has in suffering.  You can leave the town, or you can stay and enjoy it.  It's a distinct scenario, it requires learning in that the scope of the problem usually needs to be drilled into by people, and it requires a clear decision. You either stay or go, though there's a lot of parameters around the decision, it has to be binary in the end.  The task would likely include questions like ""how can I escape with the boy?""

Rick Strassman administered dimethyltryptamine (DMT) to human subjects intravenously and recorded their behaviors and experiences. His book is called The Spirit Molecule and he leads a research group that studies consciousness. He believes high states of consciousness (soul, spirit, mind) are accessed through the molecule DMT. DMT binds to its receptors in the brain and the transpersonal experiences, as you put it, are activated. This is essentially the same experience achieved in the shaman traditions. They extract DMT from plant roots and make a ceremonial drink with it.   Michael Persinger used pretty much a form of transcranial magnetic stimulaton (TMS) and stimulated the temporal lobes of participants while sensory depriving them. He called his contraption the God Helmet.  The subjects felt euphoric and saw beings in the room with them, or so they claimed. This seems to be a higher cognitive experience, or consciousness, whichever. Maybe the brain evolved a euphoric feeling and the experience of higher beings to cope with the fear of death? Maybe the brain realized it could not function knowing it would cease to exist, so this neural tissue formed? Who knows. Anyway, cool research.  It is difficult for scientists to conduct this research now, and it is a waste of time, in the opinion of many.  Drug regulations make it nearly impossible. The idea of understanding consciousness is nearly impossible, as well. The brain is an abyss, along with its all of the systematic pathways and functions involved. We have neurotransmitters and have no clue what they are for. We do not know how a thought or memory is physically stored. We cannot even cure our serious mental disorders. People do not fund the seemingly impossible (studying the self/consciousness). We are toddlers trying to put together a big puzzle. People pay to put together the small pieces first."
neuroscience,38xeev,17ts,5,Mon Jun 8 04:48:55 2015 UTC,"higher states of consciousness   It would probably more accurate to call them lower states of consciousness, as these states are likely accessed through a disruption of normal brain function (reduced functional connectivity and activity in certain regions). Going with the popular Carhart-Harris interpretation, deactivation of systems stabilizing order of the system, thus increasing entropy and decreasing certainty is what underlies the psychedelic state (and dreams, psychosis). Same with the transpersonal experience OP is talking about, being 'one with everything' is unlikely to be experienced by accessing something that is normally hidden, but rather by taking away something that stabilizes normal consciousness."

This review makes an argument that the two may have converged to produce similar structures. The author gives three examples:    The hyperpallium, which processes visual information in birds, is laminated like the mammalian visual cortex and may work in a similar fashion. There are similar connectivity patterns in the brains of birds that exhibit vocal learning (e.g. songbirds), such as connections between brainstem motor nuclei and the motor and premotor areas in the forebrain. This includes possibly my favorite name for a brain structure: ""Area X"" The caudolateral nidopallium (CDLN) has many similarities to the mammalian prefrontal cortex. For example, lesion studies in pigeons impaired their ability to perform working memory tasks. It remains to be seen what role this structure has in other species and for more complex cognitive tasks.   Overall, an interesting paper. He even calls birds ""the feathered ape in your garden.""

Again, because this is hard-wired and anchored in genetics I think it isn't 'true' intelligence. I mean cellular signaling and biochemical pathways are discretely controlled and updated in a goal-oriented fashion, through interactions and experience, in a way that could be considered incredible intelligence if it were not for the fact that it was automated on a very low and straightforward level.

This intent information would be fed into an area of the brain called the Basal Ganglia as well as an area called the 'Premotor Cortex', which take that intent and turn it into a sequence of muscle movements that will achieve the effects you want. The basal ganglia acts as a sort of 'gate-keeper' on movement, and is part of what ensures you only make movements that are 'useful.' You can see that in the symptoms Parkinson's Disease, which is a loss of a special kind of neuron that controls the basal ganglia.   So the Premotor cortex and basal ganglia both output to the Primary motor cortex (the BG runs via the thalamus, but that doesn't matter for out purpose), which contains a 'map' of muscles in the body. The Motor plan formulated by the premotor cortex excites the sequence of upper motor neurons, which then project down to the spinal cord and excite the alpha motor neurons which excite muscles directly.   I hope that answers the question, although I've probably butchered reality. Motor control isn't my area."

neuroscience,38u6df,DReicht,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:45:43 2015 UTC,"Ok stop for a second at ""This intent information would be fed into the area of the brain"".......so the intent has been there the whole time, i decided on what i wanted but i paused to ""contemplate"" the thought process more, so.....what FINALLY causes the ""intent"" to fire the impulse???   Excuse my randomness i'm just in brainstorming mode bare with me lol"
neuroscience,38u6df,highbuzz,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:04:14 2015 UTC,"The ""pause"" you experienced is you considering what item on the menu would be more ""rewarding"". Somewhere in your thought logic, you already determined you are only ordering one item. So now you pause to consider what item you would like best (more rewarding). This is opportunity cost.   Reward judgement is mediated predominantly by the orbitofrontal cortex but other brain regions like the nucleus accumbens (involved with reward more broadly) and also non-specific areas of the cerebral cortex would play a role as memories are thought to be stored in varying areas of the cortex. To make a reward judgement you'd need to call upon past memories of how you liked the items in the past.  The meat of your question is tied into consciousness and the self, which we don't have a specific answer. What happens chemically in the brain that drives you to finally decide on sesame chicken instead of Mongolian beef? We know general areas and functions but in terms of individual neurons or highly detailed mechanisms, that has yet to been fully hashed out.  There's a lot of other physiological factors to consider too. For example, high stress results in high cortisol levels, which have been shown to cause people to favor high fat and/or high sugar content. So there's a lot of other factors at work in the body that influence your decision just day to day, honestly second to second."
neuroscience,38u6df,bigbobbigbobbigbob,2,Sun Jun 7 09:36:44 2015 UTC,I feel like the question posed initially can be loosely related to debates on the origins of abstract thought. I tend to lean towards the CEMI electromagnetic theory of consciousness... but I'm no doctor.  I like to believe that there is an electromagnetic field that serves as an additional sense in decision making tying things like genetic predisposition to preference caused by favorable memories while taking stress levels & other physiological drives into consideration. At least that's what I like to believe.

neuroscience,38jcam,marc5387,5,Thu Jun 4 16:34:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, 4 years of neuroscience and I have not once heard, or even considered, what CA stood for. Obviously not need-to-know info, but you'd think I'd hear that at least once. I'm impressed how he fit projections within and without the hippocampus in 2 minutes even with all that jibber-jabber about etymology, but it would have been nice, for laymen listeners, for him to go into detail of the doubly-dissociable roles of CA3 and CA1 in long-term memory (the processes for reconsolidation and consolidation, respectively, of spatial memory tasks for instance). Even just by saying they have different roles, full stop."
neuroscience,38jcam,serialaccountkiller,5,Thu Jun 4 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"This video manages to cover the hippocampal indexing theory in 7 minutes, is this (re-)consolidation?"
neuroscience,38jcam,True-Creek,2,Thu Jun 4 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure reconsolidation occurs to strengthen long-term potentiation, by updating the previous engram either with new information to supplement old information, such as reexposure to a stimulus for the previous memory in a new context. All it means is that the original memory becomes labile, susceptible to change, and the subsequent updating schema is strengthened by hijacking the machinery that encoded the original memory. I learned the concept of reconsolidation at the molecular level (protein synthesis regulation,  signaling cascades and interactions, with CREB, C/EBP, BDNF and other transcription factors) rather than a signaling level such as pattern separation/completion concept. But my guess is reconsolidation occurs when overlapping pathways are reactivated (autoassociation), along with the some or all of the same neural populations (pattern completion) and extending to include new populations to 'update' the memory, I suppose strengthened by means of pattern separation. I'm not confident in the accuracy of this though as I didn't learn it in this paradigm."

neuroscience,38jcam,lacunosum,3,Fri Jun 5 00:12:27 2015 UTC,Do a google image search for hippocampus anatomy and I think you'll find CA4 is a common designation; my personal experience is that it's more common than calling it the hilus or hilar region. Here's an example from the literature and here's the wikipedia entry for CA4.
neuroscience,38jcam,lacunosum,2,Fri Jun 5 00:54:45 2015 UTC,"It's probably specific to field or species. At least in my subfield, ""hilus"" is far more common. Though not enough people talk about CA4/hilus anyway. (Apparently I was so surprised I used a ""y"" to type ""hilus"".)"
neuroscience,38jcam,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:58:45 2015 UTC,"Region IV of hippocampus proper:       Region IV of hippocampus proper is a portion of the hippocampal formation.  Region CA4 (often called the hilus or hilar region when considered part of the dentate gyrus, as neurons here do not have pyramidal morphology like those of areas CA1 & CA3 (suggested by Lorente de Nó  and verified by David G. Amaral))  contains mossy cells that primarily receive inputs from granule cells located nearby in the dentate gyrus in the form of mossy fibers. They also receive a small number of connections from pyramidal cells located in CA3. They, in turn, project back into the dentate gyrus at distant septotemporal levels.
