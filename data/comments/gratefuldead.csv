gratefuldead,3dy1hd,TheShadeofDennis,9,Mon Jul 20 15:59:56 2015 UTC,"It wasn't in Vegas it was 1986-04-21 at Berkeley Community Theater. He stayed on the stage during the drums/space part, and then broke down during ""Maybe You Know"" at the end with ""maybe you don't know how I'm fuckin feeling, but maybe to you it don't seem so real."" as he starts to breakdown. The others sense his distress, and Garcia quickly tries to change the mood by playing a lively ""Going Down The Road,"" which Brent barely plays keys on. He does sing on the ""Feeling bad bad bad"" parts. Jerry then plays ""Morning Dew"" to speak to Brent, singing ""I thought I heard a young man cry today"" and ""I guess it doesn't matter"" directly sung to him.  I actually love this show for this reason. I have always liked Brent."
gratefuldead,3dy1hd,sylvanriv,3,Mon Jul 20 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"During the next show, 4-22-86, Brent was trashed, probably because of the incident the night before.

gratefuldead,3dy88b,Calufa01,4,Mon Jul 20 15:01:50 2015 UTC,"New Deadhead here, only been listening for a month or so. I started off listening to American Beauty and Workingman's Dead and then took a listen to Dick's Pick's 1-5 (5 was my favorite). For the past couple weeks though, it's been all tapes from Archive.org and that's where it's really at. The band's emotion, passion, and love for music really comes through with the tapes. I'm in love.   You mentioned that you're not a huge fan of live recordings, but give it a chance with The Dead. Their concerts weren't known for being over the top, flashy stage shows, with impressive pyrotechnics, wardrobe changes, and set pieces. Dead Concerts were essentially a group of guys holding public jam sessions, making beautiful music for hours. If I can make a recommendation, pop over to headyversion.com and find a few of your favorite songs from the studio albums you listened to. Find the most upvoted show for that song and click the ""Listen on Archive"" link beneath the show and take a listen. There are thousands of shows out there and usually multiple recordings of each show. Look for Matrix, Soundboard, or SDB recordings, they're usually the best.  If I can make one more recommendation, check out Barton Hall, Cornell University on 1977-05-08. The quality is great and its one of the shows that I see regularly in lists of the great shows. I really love Scarlet Begonias > Fire On The Mountain and then St Stephen > Morning Dew. Absolutely beautiful."

gratefuldead,3dy88b,ernstwebber,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:57 2015 UTC,"The Grateful Dead were known for their free-flowing improvisational jams that blended songs together, and although they had a rough set list, on any given night not even the band knew where the music may go, which kept the music fresh and interesting and spoke to the moment. The studio albums are nice to hear the ""definitive"" version of any given song, however as you listen to theGrateful Dead more, you will find that the live shows are a lot of fun to experience. You can find many streaming shows, and shows to download, at archive.org"
gratefuldead,3dy88b,gratefulfloyd67,2,Mon Jul 20 16:46:37 2015 UTC,The studio albums are good but the real magic is with the live shows. It's what the band is really known for.

You'll find gems throughout the years -- just listen to Bobby songs.  I think the soundboard from Merriweather 6.30.85 - Shakedown Street - does a great job of isolating Bob's playing and clarifying just how important it was to the whole Dead sound.  Jerry is Jerry, no denying -- but IMO Bob's accents and colors all just made Jerry even better. Selfless and amazing.  Also, another path: look for any version of When I Paint My Masterpiece during the late 80s. A great song for Bob, aways sung IMO with a touch of irony - given that they started doing it after the mega success of In the Dark change the scene so much.  That song, plus pretty much any Bob version of Dylan's other tunes. Queen Jane. Desolation Row. etc.  As I said,you'll find the good stuff throughout."

Now if they release individual shows I'd bet it would just be the audio on CD or FLAC/MP3 Download & NO Bluray. (Just a guess)  One last thing, This box is a limited release of 20,000! For reference the Spring 1990 Too Box set ($240) had 9,000 limited release and they have just under 500 left a year later. (also a excellent quality box set) I think the FTW box set will sell quicker than that but I wouldn't be that worried about missing out on it especially if you get Dead.net emails.   Personally I feel they need to do some restructuring with this box. I'm holding off on ordering until they include the Santa Clara shows or drop the price to reflect that this will fit on 9 CD's & 4 Blu-Ray's (Not the original 12 CD's & 7 Blu-Ray's they are advertising)  I'm personally ok with just getting the 7/5 show on CD & Blu-Ray as a back up and that is not limited in quantity."

Pig Pen had to tell Phil what his bass was and that he had to go on stage to play music with the band. I can't remember the exact date of the show but I'm pretty sure it was in June 8, 68.   Also in the new documentary about Bobby, The Other One, Bobby says he tripped very Saturday for a few years. So the band likely tripped during early years Saturday shows"

gratefuldead,3dmndk,deadheadkeg,6,Fri Jul 17 14:40:30 2015 UTC,These shows had some of the best drums > space segments I've ever heard. The visuals on the pay-per-view stream were amazing as well. I don't understand the Bobby hate however. I think he took the weight that Jerry shouldered for so long on his own shoulders and he did it masterfully. I knew Trey was gonna kill it and I'm glad a lot of new people are getting into his music. Overall I'm still extremely pleased with the shows.
gratefuldead,3dmndk,Space_Your_Face,3,Fri Jul 17 16:04:01 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the drums/space but I could've done without all the pre-programmed stuff.  It was like these sections were an outlet for Mickey's unique brand of electronic music.  Which is fine but they did pretty similar segments every night
gratefuldead,3dmndk,fishbulb00,2,Fri Jul 17 16:33:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. I got really tired of the electric mbira that Mickey seems to be in love with now.  Actually, I'd love to listen to all the Drums segments back to back and see how similar they sound."
gratefuldead,3dmndk,auf_der_autobahn,5,Fri Jul 17 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"My take:  Trey - Great, killed it, good tone, paying attention, under a lot of pressure and more than delivered.  Bobby -  People are being too hard on the guy/forgetting what he's all about. He was always the youngest guy in the band, he always had a weird uptightness that is either annoying/adorable depending on who you ask, and he's easy to make fun of. I thought he destroyed these shows. He was obviously having a lot of fun. His singing was raw and excellent. His guitar playing was raw and excellent. His various wails and improvised swearing demonstrated that this was serious shit for him and he wasn't going to just relax and see what happened. And his (up for interpretation) bossiness is, frankly, just who he is. Think about how many times he tried to cue Jerry and was totally ignored, often to the crowd's delight.  Phil - Again, it's just who the guy is. People have hated his singing forever, but he's been singing forever. I'm not upset they let him sing so much. I knew it was coming and I honestly always like to see Phil sing. If you paid attention to Furthur then you probably expected a lot of Phil, and a lot of Phil is what we got.  Billy - Slayed it.  Mickey - Super goofy during Drums, which honestly I didn't care for, but you can't knock him for doing exactly what he was asked to do.  Bruce - Yes, a bummer he wasn't called up more. His singing absolutely made the songs on which it was asked for. I particularly loved how he handled Brown-Eyed Women on 6/28.  Jeff - Poor guy. Who's going to pay attention to him when you have five Dead dudes and Trey fucking Anastasio onstage? That said, he crushed it as usual and it's really the cross a non-singing organ player has to bear. These shows weren't really made to highlight him, but I'm sure he had a blast and the people who were really happy to hear he'd be on the bill (like me) were, I'm sure, appropriately thrilled to hear him play."
gratefuldead,3dmndk,auf_der_autobahn,3,Fri Jul 17 15:02:25 2015 UTC,"I think that Phil should be allowed to sing HIS songs and the songs of the Dead without anyone complaining, Mickey's drumming has ALWAYS been carried by Billy, Bob was stronger than he has been in recent years, Trey did a great job and I think he was the best choice for the job, and he really stepped up his game in Chicago, I've never been a Bruce fan, but was glad to have him there anyway (I still think that TC should have been there for at least one song), Jeff did a great job on the organ and vocals. I don't understand why they didn't have Donna there either, but I can see why they didn't want a big special guest rotation - that disrupts the flow  of the shows, but former core band members should be acknowledged. I would have liked to have seen at least one Pigpen-specific tune such as Easy Wind and one Brent tune played - Easy to Love You or Tons of Steel would have been nice, but overall I was thrilled with the set lists."
gratefuldead,3dmndk,beauxregard,3,Fri Jul 17 15:04:28 2015 UTC,"""Mickey's drumming has ALWAYS been carried by Billy"". I thought Mickey seemed a bit dialed down for these shows. I figured it was more or less a 'he's getting older' type thing (which I am cool with).  Your comment of 'Mickey being carried by Billy' just seems odd to me. I only did about 120 shows from 88-95. I cant remember ever feeling like that or hearing anyone say that about them. Seems like I am am hearing this sentiment a lot more after FTW. Was this always a thing and I was just oblivious? If anything... back in the 80's I would hear the opposite (which I still didn't agree with). The train horn cracked me up... I forgot about that thing :)"

Not that I don't love mickey to death. I do. Bill is the drummer and Mick adds extra to it that's simply the musical dynamic between the two"
gratefuldead,3dmndk,derpaperd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:45:22 2015 UTC,"I gotta admit I never really felt billy carried mickey ""back in the day"" (pretty much same Era as you...I started a couple years sooner and not as many shows).  But it did seem to be the case more for these shows. No complaints about the drumming for these shows though....it was strong...i just feel more of that strength came from billy than mickey....it think ultimately it was a wise choice how they did it...they just haven't played together enough to have made anything else work as well."
gratefuldead,3dmndk,beauxregard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:39:23 2015 UTC,"This is not a new feeling, at least on my part.  Don't get me wrong, I love some of the projects that Mickey put together, such as Diga Rhythm Band, and Dafos, and The heartbeats shows are among my most favorite. Mickey is a great rudimentary drummer - he has mad skills as a military type drummer - in fact he went in to the military just to learn how to play drums like that. I started seeing the dead in 1979, and my last show was Jerry's last show, and I saw about 200 shows. In my opinion, when it comes to feel, Mickey is usually a bit heavy handed and not as delicate or as intricate as the drumming of Bill. At the FTW shows he played mallets, and Bill played drum sticks. Bill's compositional skills on the drums are amazing - Mickey is great when he locks in with Bill, but Bill is always leading the pocket. Bill floats on those drums."

I feel that just as OP said, he fulfilled a childhood dream, even bucket list.  He was up there crying during a few songs, i saw.  Scarlet and SotM for sure.  Bobby - (B+) bobby was bobby.  played great rhythm, filling in as best as he could for trey, whom he wasn't used to playing with.  did a fine job.  messed up lyrics as per usual.  Phil - (B+) very strong on bass and had a blast out there.  my only complaints were too much singing.  specifically terrapin and eyes come to mind.  i actually liked him singing alligator.  that song is awesome.  Billy - (A) overlooked, and just completely played great.  i love this guys attitude.  Mickey (B) - kinda the bobby is to jerry, he was to billy.  he filled in the blanks, and Drums > space was great  Jeff - (A) just like trey, stepped up and slayed it.  He had a ton of experience playing w/ these guys don't forget.  Bruce - (C+) (please don't kill me) sorry bruce, you were the weakest link out there. Your piano and voice were very solid.  but you were the least prepared it seemed and came in way to early on songs (fire on the mountain killed me), and also sounded ridiculous on some other songs (He's Gone).  i didn't love you on Loser either.

gratefuldead,3dmndk,DrGraffix,3,Fri Jul 17 19:27:08 2015 UTC,"OK I am going to say it: Trey was a mixed bag. He actually did really well for what he needed to do. He put a lot of thoughtful work into the songs and really helped carry them. It sounded good and felt right.  Phish is a four person group. Trey does well in that area, he has a nice bouncy funk and plays the role of rhythm and lead. I think that was really beneficial to the overall sound as he and Bobby could make these songs sound ""full"".  However: He does nothing for me on lead guitar in soloing or exploration. He does okay on the rockers (Alabama Getaway for example) but cant really pull off the songs the way Jerry (or several of his contemporaries) could. I remember saying during Uncle Johns that it was beautiful, but was really missing a nice leading guitar. And give me a danceable lead guitar too.  I would give Trey a B+ for the effort."
gratefuldead,3dmndk,comosedicewaterbed,0,Sat Jul 18 00:17:50 2015 UTC,"I think the lack of exploration was intentional.  But he was in songs like dark star, st Stephen, and Mississippi half step.    His guitar work in songs like hell in a bucket, morning dew, and death don't have no mercy was very sharp and fantastic.  This is off the top of my head.  If I had the setlists in front of me I could give some other examples."

gratefuldead,3dmndk,Rotationation,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:28:42 2015 UTC,"Ok.  I think I agree with almost every comment a little but all in I loved every second of my favorite bands ""last stand"".  Trey a+ bobby a+ Phil ( minus singing) a+ billy and Mickey a+ Bruce and Jeff a+.   The only thing that took away from the shows (obviously besides jerry being gone) was the planned set lists each night.  I know that was the only way that they could pull it off but I missed the seamlessly long transitions...most notably China cat rider (again, for me) That was the only missing link from the pre 95 shows for me...and that only comes with time and practice.  Loved these shows and would go to more if they wanted to play more."
gratefuldead,3dmndk,Povertypizza,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:06:01 2015 UTC,"Trey was the MVP. Strangely enough, Bruce was somehow the weakest link. Everyone was amazingly strong, and maybe it was the mix, but he didn't seem to do much. Jeff was the big surprise for me, although I had seen him do some absolutely nutty stuff with Furthur, so I kind of expected him to be surprising. Bobby and Phil had more energy than I've seen in years. Mickey was doing a lot of really cool fills and color, but he was quiet in the mix and seemed timid until it was his time to shine... Although I think we could have done with a few less drum/space segments, Mickey went NUTS during those. That first night drums segment in Santa Clara was religious. Billy did a fantastic job, and looked like he was having so much fun.  Overall, they were all way better than I imagined."
gratefuldead,3dmndk,KDShark,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:57:25 2015 UTC,"I feel that Trey was under utilized. The guy could of melted the entire stage at times but was held back by Phil and or Bob with their ""signals"". Trey was far too polite, he should of just ignored their silly hand signals at times and let the music off its chain, that is the reason we all love The Deads music in the first place. It was a travesty having Bruce there and not have him sing more, Trey as well IMO, Phils singing is impossible to understand at times and in a stadium of all places annunciation is pretty important.  I also feel some of those setlists or song choices were pretty bad, so many better and more important songs went tragically unplayed.  Trey in an interview listed a bunch of songs that he was told to specifically practice and he wrote a short list of his own of songs HE wanted to play ( and sing ) Halfstep, China Doll and Crazy Fingers were three. Mickey friggin killed on Drums, so happy to see that back again, something seriously missing from many recent Dead side progects."
gratefuldead,3dmndk,DrGraffix,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:54:25 2015 UTC,"Do you not recall crazy fingers being played?  The communication on stage (or ""signals"" if you prefer) is just part of being in a band. The Dead always did that, albeit maybe less obviously since the original guys had lived together and played together for decades. And also communicated through ESP (haha- jk but seriously).   I think it's a two way street- maybe Trey  was foiled a couple times by Bob's eager band directions. Far more often, I saw Trey leaning in or looking over for help and direction on songs and appreciating the help he was getting. Plus, a lot of people seem to incorrectly ascribe every move Bob made as ""directing the band"". His most animated gestures were directed off stage and had to do with levels on his mic, guitar and monitor. All the waving and pointing at the mic and guitar were not for Trey.  I think Trey definitely played all he cared to play. I saw him run through a few transitions and the boys gladly backed off and let him have it. I think what you were picking up on was Trey's desire to listen as much as he played and his respect for the music. Granted, Jerry didn't always operate that way and often played lead all night, over top everything (sometimes brilliantly, other times not). At any rate, I had a few moments of frustration about Trey hanging back but then reminded myself of what it must be like in those shoes and always ended up really impressed with how he balanced. And when he went for it-- he usually nailed it and added a ton of much needed energy to the music.   My only complaint as a pay per view attendee was that the mix on the audio was really out of balance. Trey was super loud, Bob/Jeff/Bruce were non-existent. Bob seemed to come up a bit on Sunday. I have no complaints at all about the music itself or the setlists."

It was more like a straight SBD but with the usual missing info above 16k and a compressed signal with minimal dynamic range.    The first night is the best sounding FM recording and therefore slighly better sounding than the other 2 nights.    All DJ chatter and station ID's have been meticulously removed. These edits are completely inaudible.    Quite a bit of DSP has been performed on the FM and what is left sounded like a really good SBD. The FM background noise was easy to isolate and remove. The recording was heavily compressed but utilizing a dynamics plugin and then introducing the AUD, this undesirable aspect has been fixed. The FM recording was also quite narrow. This too has been greatly improved in the Matrix.    This is a great sounding source and will do nicely until the band puts out the multitracks.

After downloading a show, I manually open the folder and rename each file.  I then use an ID3 tag editor (I use Linux, so am using kid3qt for this) and properly edit the tags.  I also attach album art (for unreleased shows, I search for original poster art to use).  Any time I want to listen to any show, I just drag and drop it into my media player on my PC (Audacious), but for the most part I'll have just copied the files to my phone and play them with JetAudio.

Friend! I asked whether the Grayfolded album is still in print! Not if it is available used, or if I could purchase and download the MP3s, or if I could stream it! Of course I saw the used copies! I course I saw the Amazon MP3s! And I know it's on Youtube and Spotify and could be torrented! But none of those things are what I asked! I would like a physical copy for the liner notes; and I would like a new copy, if possible, both so that my money contributes to artists instead of resellers and to avoid the possibility of getting stuck with a scratched disk or an imperfect booklet! Perhaps, as has been suggested here, it is indeed out of print; that's what I assumed when I couldn't find any sign of readily available new copies. And in that case I will take advantage of one of the used copies for sale on Amazon or ebay, and probably grab electronic files from someplace as well.

What you did for and shared with your brother in his last days here was a great thing, and whatever grief you feel should be tempered with the knowledge that you were as kind as could be and did everything possible to increase his comfort and happiness.

gratefuldead,3dfnsh,rutherfordblizard,2,Wed Jul 15 22:11:54 2015 UTC,"I've found that they're very hit or miss (mostly miss), but there are some gems out there. It may depend on the taper, and so if you find a good one make sure to look up their other stuff. One of the ones I'll always look out for on the archive is Rob Bertrando. This show from 1971 is possibly the best AUD I've come across so far, and his other recordings are pretty top notch as well. His recording of the first Terrapin is pretty incredible too.  I usually just look for the soundboards, or matrix mixes, but those aren't downloadable from the archives. I would, I guess, just suggest to do similar searches as you would for any other show when searching for an AUD. Look for high numbers of views, high reviews, and dig through the comments sections. I can't remember how I found the first show I linked, but I'm pretty sure I found the second one just by reading how people were raving over the other recordings this guy did.   Edit: 8/6/71 is actually the 1971 show I'd meant to link. It's got one of my favorite Hard to Handles, hearing it from the audience gives it something else that a SBD just can't capture. Thanks to /u/gratefulfloyd67 for recommending it!"
gratefuldead,3dfnsh,braney86,3,Thu Jul 16 00:38:00 2015 UTC,"August 6, 1971 is also a great show with a great AUD recording"
gratefuldead,3dfnsh,gratefulfloyd67,2,Thu Jul 16 12:30:31 2015 UTC,"You know what, I had meant to link the August 6th show. I totally didn't notice that I'd linked the 5th instead.   I guess I'll have to listen to the 8/5 now to see how it compares."
gratefuldead,3dfnsh,braney86,2,Thu Jul 16 17:12:37 2015 UTC,look for matrix mixes.  they are soundboard and audience mixed together so you get best of both worlds... i just stream them from Archive.org if i started downloading i'd be out of space in no time
gratefuldead,3dfnsh,NotHerbert,2,Thu Jul 16 00:41:22 2015 UTC,"Ken and Judy Lee have a fantastic AUD from 6-24-1970 at the Capital Theater that is 100% worth checking out.  A great AUD will beat an SBD, IMO, but great AUDs are rare. 6-24-70 is one of those ones that beats an SBD, because you can hear the dynamics of the crowd and audience. There also isn't an SBD from this show, however.  Just my opinion, though."
gratefuldead,3dfnsh,Rotationation,2,Thu Jul 16 01:21:38 2015 UTC,"There are some tapers and remasterers out there that are better than others. Oade brothers, Green Mountain Boys, Wise, Chuck Miller masters are good choices, in general."
gratefuldead,3dfnsh,Billy_Bongs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:23:43 2015 UTC,Look for Charlie Miller auds (as mentioned above). Any other audience recording you generally want to look for FOB in the naming convention too.  It's not a guarantee to consistent A+ recordings...but FOB is the sweet spot for tapers.  Check out shnflac.net...great site for all kinds of quality shows...I believe Charlie Miller plays a role in the site itself?
gratefuldead,3dfnsh,Derrick4Real,2,Thu Jul 16 23:14:20 2015 UTC,"Check out this blog at deadlistening dot com. There are enough good aud reviews to last a long, long time. If you read the reviews from first to latest, in the order they were written, it is very interesting; notice a certain evolution in the writing, and gain loads of taper and band lore in the process. And, listening  to the recommended shows from 7/16/1966 on, and the early shows are not auds, but SBDs, the same thing applies; you will hear the band transform across the months and years, and understandably come to perhaps appreciate all the years for the good things each one reveals."

Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann and Phil Lesh have come together under that name for the last time, they say, to celebrate the band's fiftieth anniversary with last hurrahs both in the Bay Area – where they formed in 1965 – and in Chicago, where they performed for the last time with Jerry Garcia, who passed away soon after that show, in August 1995.  You can watch and listen to the concerts a million different ways. Multiple media outlets are wallowing warmly in Dead nostalgia. A New Orleans delegation is in Chicago right now to play a Thursday (July 2) kickoff concert, co-presented by Hart.

I've probably seen nearly every post-Dead combo, tons of Zero and Kimock shows (I got to interview him once, and I got to interview Robert Hunter + Greg Anton another time, yay!), and I live in the Bay Area. I have had my fill, no problem.   I was merely predicting that they will keep playing if they want to and most of them want to.  The real issue is that a couple of them (and their ""teams"") really can't stand each other anymore, so I doubt we'll see the ""core 3 + mickey"" play together any time soon / ever.  And I love my work and I love music so I hope I get to keep working and playing music as long as possible, not to sound defensive!"

When I was in my late teens I saw this wonderful scene unfold before me.  I wondered how I could deserve to be part of such a thing.  There was plenty of activism intertwined with the partying and hedonism.  I took it to heart and set out to make a difference.  Almost 30 years later, I build super energy efficient lighting and support 200 employees and their families (mine included).  I made that difference I set out to do. There is solar on my roof and I just killed my lawn so I stop wasting water.  It's the sum of the parts, the Dead has always been about that.  We all come together through the music and try to take a piece with us and ""do some good with it"".    I hate labels and flags.  I know plenty of people who lean to the right in certain aspects and to the left in others.  Society is a very complex thing.  What is right and wrong??  Who really knows??  The Dead was supposed to be a place where you could stop caring for a few hours and subsequently arrive at your own conclusions.

Chicken and the egg I suppose. How could you complain about having to offer insurance if you didn't get to make a company with 200 employees. Knowing that company would not exist if Republicans got their way.  Oh and I am only guessing you are a Republican by your first insulting and amazingly condescending sentence.

It happens to everyone as their priorities in life change.  When I was 19, I could live in the back of my truck or sleep in the dirt for months at a time. I could exist on very little.

You may agree with a Republican on a certain issue yet completely disagree on other issues.  Same with the Dems.  They are basically the same and all are bought and sold.  My point only is that some of the Heads' viewpoints have changed when they get to different places in their lives.  Even the staunchest businessmen who truly believe in positive change are cynical.

gratefuldead,3dexvf,bigfike,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:12:50 2015 UTC,"what I'm talking about is people that proudly support politicians who explode poor brown people as a form of geo-political chess and to increase the bottom line of the military industrial complex, spy on citizens, put people in cages for years for possessing plants, slash education for budgetary reasons but yet give tax cuts to friendly corporations that donate to their reelection campaigns, etc. etc. And this is problem in both the right and left, but it's especially a deeper problem on side that promotes ayn rand style ""selfishness is a virtue"" ideology.   If such supporters of such nonsense have taken psychedelics, then they haven't learned anything. they just got high. this runs parallel to the Christians who attend church every Sunday and are fully immersed in the identity of being a Christian, but hold the beliefs of ""let everyone fend for themselves"" and hatred for gays and Muslims which is the complete opposite of the love  compassion, and openness taught by Christ himself."
gratefuldead,3dexvf,bigfike,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:44:33 2015 UTC,"Like I said, neither the right nor left has a monopoly on virtue and ethics. And certainly the modern American parties are both bastions of corruption, greed, myopic vision, violence, and dogmatic thinking. I'd just argue that conservatives, particularly of the social kind, are just caught deeper in their delusions than others.   I also agree that psychedelics are not a panacea, either. But they certainly have the potential to peel away the calcified layers of culture, egoism, shame, and fear that keep this suffering world spinning along. What did the Good Friday experiment (and the MAPS follow-up) demonstrate? That 8 of 10 people that undergo deep psychedelic experiences encounter the divine (whatever that may be) and, subsequently, enter into profound life changes. I think the key in those experiments was intention. If someone just takes the drug for the high, well, they'll just get all fucked up. If someone takes the drug as a spring board into a mystical experience, well, that happens too.     Did you ever read this article? http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/trip-treatment -- good stuff."

I download the files, and after a listen through, I decided to make a mix from the recordings that only included the instrumental sections. I then imported each Dark Star into my music software (Sony Acid), and sliced out each vocal section. Once all the vocal sections were gone, I worked on mixing each instrumental segment into each other. In some cases, some of the music was cut to create a more seamless transition with the next segment.  In all, the mix came to 10hrs in length. Enjoy!

McNally's book has a couple quotes he gave to English reporters on the Europe trips. May 1970: ""We've got past the stage of thoughts of breaking up. What usually happens is that we go into town, to a saloon, shoot some pool or play cards. Then we accuse one another of cheating and start fighting."" April 1972: [quit drinking] ""Now my only vices are smoking cigarettes and pestering the wenches.""  Generally, Pigpen stayed far away from interviewers, though.   here is a transcription of an interview with a DJ from 1966: http://www.angelfire.com/fl/goodbear/interview66.html  here is a write-up about pigpen: http://wild-bohemian.com/pigpen.htm  another nice write-up: http://deadessays.blogspot.com/2010/03/pigpen.html"

Pigpen was always going to be a blueser, and the rest of the boys were ready to go furthur into deep space. I think even if he had lived he would have split from the Dead by 1975."
gratefuldead,3d6j87,cyrilspaceman,4,Tue Jul 14 00:55:35 2015 UTC,"He was there for the Acid Tests and for all the drawn out Dark Stars in the late 60s. I don't think he would have gone anywhere. The band probably would have stayed more of a blues band than they did, so they might not have done all the Space stuff or anything like Shakedown Street or Estimated Prophet, but they still would have been a hell of a band. I can't even imagine what it would be like to have 30 years of Love lights to listen to. I loved their tours with Warren Haynes because he could sing all those great Pig songs."
gratefuldead,3d6j87,comosedicewaterbed,2,Tue Jul 14 06:43:44 2015 UTC,"True, but he was the only member of the band that didn't indulge in drugs (aside from getting dosed against his will). Not to say that's the be-all-end-all of what makes the Grateful Dead the Grateful Dead, but I doubt Pigpen would have been on board for nightly Drums>Space's or 30 minute Scarlet>Fire's to boot. Also I doubt we would have ever seen Disco Dead with Pigpen still in the band. I didn't know the guy personally, so this is all my own conjecture, but I think his diminished role in the band by the turn of the decade supports my case."

gratefuldead,3d6j87,slugga_slugga,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:17:50 2015 UTC,I do think from early on they realized that having multiple folks singing allowed them to be very versatile. But Pigpen was the reason they had the balls to get up their and go for it right out of the gate.  But it does follow they had a lot of talent and I doubt it would have gone to waste had Pigpen not passed.
gratefuldead,3d6j87,rhinowing,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:52:30 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing as you did.  Immediately after the Attics of My Life I started up the earliest shows I had and just listened to them straight through.  I'm about midway through '68 at the moment.  I always knew that Pigpen was a lot more important back then, but I didn't realize just how dominant he was.  He was by far the most important member of the band pre-68, and stayed important through 68 (even with the firing), with Caution, Lovelight, Schoolgirl, and a couple other showcase pieces.  But I think that they had already started down the track they ended up following the rest of their careers by '69.  So I think they would have been pretty similar.  They were already marginalizing him a bit, and that continued until he left the band after the Europe trip.  Had he stayed, they would have kept Lovelight and Caution in the setlists probably, but just would have made them more jam-based.  Just my thought.  Glad to know someone else has been listening to that early stuff too!"

gratefuldead,3d7f76,Mizzyaxp,2,Tue Jul 14 14:58:06 2015 UTC,They usually have the Garcia's tent at Lockn' and other festivals (they were at soldier field too) where they just blast some I-cant-help-but-stop-and-dance-to-this JGB and have a buch of fans and couches and free redbull once. Pretty cool.

That would be very cool though if they screened a Dead show in a late night tent or something with a ridiculous sound system. That's like all I wanted to stumble into wandering around shitfacedosed 3am at burning man but noooooo, we've gotta play more fucking dubstep, more fucking house, more fucking psytrance...shit I could have even done for some more electroswing at that point but unfortunately this supposedly diverse, international ultra-event of 70k people is really just 70k mainstream EDM fans from the bay area. Truth. Most fun I've ever had in a week, but fuck. Thank god for the Jazz Cafe. Anyways...rambling... I think I just got dosed by my merch from Santa Clara lol. Not even kidding. Didn't wash shirt I bought, just wore it for first time, played drums, started sweating...now I'm dosed. o_- . Would not make this up. Compared to most music fests I've been to Vibes is usually pretty good at catering to instrument fans...screening an old Dead show in a rave tent would be fucking hilarious, and amazing."

It's a voluntary exchange. Maybe it's priced too high for you but it's not priced too high for the people who willing buy it, they're more than happy to pay it obviously.   I don't get what people want, $5 tickets & $10 t-shirts? I mean it's not 1978.   It's silly to call everything they sell a cash grab. By your reasoning they can't sell anything without it being a cash grab.   Apparently if they don't play free shows and don't sell anything for a profit they're just cash grabbing. The whining about this is just getting old. We're lucky they're even doing anything anymore."

It is hot, over 100 degrees on stage, and the sound of the music is so dense I still get goosebumps.  And an amazing Dark Star to boot.    If I was looking for a great 25 minute span of music it would be from The Ladies And Gentlemen album, Live at the Fillmore April 1971.  There is a knock out version of Good Lovin' that segues into Drums, then an amazing 15:00 Pigpen wrap up of Good Lovin'.  So much going on in this, including some amazing Phil bass drops, and a great guitar sound, sort of soft and offsetting the bass, and of course Pigpen improv is outstanding.  Ultimately they are all good.  If I want to reflect I will hit up the last show, July 9, 1995.  Check out So Many Roads.  Jerry summons early 1970's Jerry vocals and is so bittersweet.  Or Black Muddy River from the same night.    And for fun try the studio album American Beauty.  It really is a treasure.    It is all good, I could type until my fingers bleed."

Even $60 isn't anything to blink an eye at.    Even if they did cost four bucks to make, the total charges after shipping them to the distributor, then shipping that to your house, along with what the employees need to be paid, ends up costing the seller way more than just that $4.  Even if they are making $30 on a shirt, who cares?  Why would they charge any less if they knew it would sell at that price?

I am guessing yes.  Well another thing that made that era so great is the middle class was subsidized by the ultra rich.  This has been flipped and the redistribution of wealth is happening but the tax burden has shifted to the middle and lower tax brackets.  This is a mathematical fact, taxes are zero sum game.  You need to collect enough to pay for running things.  We have cut the taxes on the ultra rich so much that the middle and lower brackets have to make up the difference.  But here is where history is a bitch.. That middle class dream all the old white guys lament about, it happened on the backs of the rich!  Here is a link to a graph of the historical tax brackets. But to summarize for those that don't know the reality of taxes in America. 1932 = 63% Rate 1936 = 79% Rate 1936-1945 =94% Rate! 1945-1964 = 91% Rate! 1964-1980 = 70% Rate 1980-1988 = 50% Rate then it goes down down down to 33-35% Remember this is a zero sum game and someone has to carry the burden.  Now 90% is a scary concept if you think its a brand new idea. But we had it and we thrived, Robber Barrons still existed, the Rockfellers, Duponts, Carnegies ect...all existed and still were filthy rich. If you make 100 million and get to keep 10 million you still fucking have 10 million, if you make 50k and you get to keep 35k you still only have 35k.  The rich will still be rich! Oh and just because he said 90% you think it just happens like I dream of Jeannie, wiggle his nose and its done.  But even at 50% top rate over 10 million would not be unprecedented.

Socialist math is obscene. Flat tax for all... everyone should have the same amount of proportional skin in the game, and frankly, the poor suck up far more resources than they provide. But that's an inconvenient truth.   The problem with socialists and communists is that they all think they will be part of the politburo, not the guy getting shit on."

Gods creation, each with the respect and wonder of being alive. Some is always going get a better deal. That is the system. You want the the with a private jet I want the everyone who can work to work hut for there to be a job for them to have. That takes investment and that takes the population spending. It is also proven out that 40 + years of trickle down economics(supply side/voodoo) does not work. The rich horde the moneys they are saving by the lower tax brackets. I am open to a debate. But flat tax is a non starter. It's a sophmoric concept that sounds good u til you see it in action. It is regressive like  sales tax is. I will concede one point. If a person is creating something new that has benefits for society as a whole I accept the. Being rewarded. But that is not where we are at anymore. The industialist have been replaced with hedge fund managers and trust fund babies that don't work or create anything. Carried interest is a tax give away that no one asked for and don't expect. Google it if are not aware of what it is. Philosophy is a great thing when you have time to burn. But I work for a living and thus vote and identify with those like me. I anticipate you not being in the one percent. But yet you identify with them and will vote agaisnt you own best interest for their benefit. You are a true believer. I admire your convictions to believe in something so strongly you would actually do harm to you and yours. That is a powerful belief. I am more tactile and vote for my best interests."

The top 5% tax bracket covers 60% of the tax burden. To be in the top 5%, you have to only be making $175k. Why should someone making more than 175k be forced to pay for shit that they don't benefit from?   Taxes are theft plain and simple -- and Sanders supporters don't understand shit about economics or fairness. Who the fuck cares if they make 200k, 1 million or 10 million. Thats their wealth and at no point is it ""fair"" to make them (under threat of violence) give their money to other people.  The super-rich are honestly the ones keeping this country afloat right now. And if taxes go up, what's stopping those people from moving to a country with little taxes? And then we will be even more SOL than before.   The amount of authoritarian idiots in this sub.... The fact that this shit is even brought to this sub is disgusting within itself.

Know what you are buying, first printing or second, or third.. Is it signed and numbered? A first edition signed and numbered is always best, but right now prices are crazy, they seem to be coming back into some reality. Lithograph and screen print is best in my opinion, I dont care for digitally printed pieces. Got one before the shows on ebay and I am not supper thrilled with the quality.    It is hard it say what prints will hold their value (or go up) and which ones will be worth what you paid today in 15 years. Just be sure you really like it, that way it wont matter.

So how do you manage Bruce and Mickey standing? Well it has to be a slope, no? Nothing balanced looking will have Bruce in the middle so slope is inevitable.   New question is it left to right or vice versa? Being we read left to right I assume he picked a downward slope from left to right.

Based on some silly comments that always seem to appear when an artist that is not usually associated with this scene shows up... John is not trying to join Phil and Friends, or The Dead, or trying to replace Jerry. Phil and Jill ran in to John in LA last week and invited him up. The basic premise of Terrapin is an intimate venue where ANYTHING can happen! Phil brings in players from every genre, to make Terrapin a special place with magical musical moments as often as possible. John accepted the invite and drove up from LA. He hung out with all the musicians, was humble, polite, social, engaging and very cool. Before they went on stage Phil was giving him some words of encouragement and John said ""Im just going to try and find the space between the other 2 guitars"". Phil said "" well with 3 guitarists, thats a really good plan"". With that they walked on stage. I would say most of the audience knew John was there, but no one really knew what to expect. John started off quietly, with some simple but beautiful fills in between what Stu and Scott were doing. Within a few songs he really found his groove and the solos he did were all right in line with the Grateful Dead vibe...powerful and pretty. He was doing what every other guitarist who plays this music does...pour their heart and soul in to it and make music that moves us all. By the second set, John really found his place in the script and with every song he got stronger, louder, and won over everybody in the room. Terrapin was on fire! The crowd was loving every moment of this legendary 1977 show they were playing, and John added so much fuel to that fire. The set ended with Morning Dew. John took the last solo, and completely blew every single mind in that room. Stu joined him for some intense guitar madness at the end of the solo, and when that song ended, the room erupted. Phil was beaming, as was everyone else on and off stage. THAT is the Magic of Terrapin Crossroads.."

There are a number of people who I think would have been better choices without the taint that Trey (really, any association with Phish... not specific to Trey) brought to the mix.   My top choice would have been Jorma Kaukonen. He's one of the very few living contemporaries of Jerry's who has both the talent and credentials to hang with the band. He's got a long history of having played with them almost from the beginning, and would have brought a little Pigpen flavor with him.   He can certainly hang with them for all of the electric stuff, and would have brought with him the notion of playing a badly-absent-from-the-recent-shows acoustic set, which would have been the cherry on top.   Jorma and Jerry playing together.  Jorma plays ""Operator""."

I think joe a is great.  I never liked phish at all.  After Jerry passed I felt like they were a good place for all the trustafarians( that imo were killing, and ruined the scene anyway).  I never gave them a shot at all.  In the lead up to FTW I tried to immerse myself in phish music so thAt I could get treys tone, vibe and ability in my head.  Guess what...he's  pretty f'ing amazing. At the shows he stepped up to the plate and hit it out of the park.  He's not jerry and he didn't try to be..and he nailed it.  Again, jorma is great...but the band picked Trey..and I (and 350,000 fans) (70,000 *5) agree.  The shows exceeded my expectations and from the reactions of the folks around me at Santa Clara and Chicago, they exceed theirs as well.  I am sorry that Trey ruined it for you....and I am not trying to be a dick, or snarky at all...but you are really in the minority on this.

To me they represent everything that was bad about ""the scene"" in the couple of years before Jerry died. The scummiest, dirtiest tourers toting around stolen nitrous tanks were also typically the folks who followed Phish, and those of us who were older than college aged largely disliked the whole thing.   Musically, I'm pretty indifferent to Phish. I saw them a dozen or so times, the most recent in about 93 or 94. I first saw them in the fall of 88 at a bar in Burlington. They didn't do much for me, and I thought that there were other jam bands of the era that were better..."

Honestly I wasn't all that impressed with the poster selection at Soldier Field.  I didn't care about the price and just bought the one I liked the most, which just happened to be the Terrapin turtle one that was only $30.  I'd rather hang that on my wall than the triptych.  Think about it this way, if those three posters weren't selling at all on eBay, would you still have paid $180 for the set?  I wouldn't, that's a crazy price."
gratefuldead,3cx5af,Hwy61Revisited,2,Sat Jul 11 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"I really wasn't feeling them at the time either, definitely not for 180. And 50$ for a shirt?! Yea, I passed on all of that. But the Masthay and the Munk One are really growing on me, especially the Masthay. In terms of the prices, I'm trying to consider what me 20 or 30 years from now would think. Im thinking I'd rather have them then another $500-1k. I'm really hoping prices drop in the next year or two or whenever.   edit 500-1k for a poster seems insane. I'm probably just going to wait this one out."
gratefuldead,3cx5af,Hwy61Revisited,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"Yea the Masthay set was my favorite also, but I didn't see it sold at one stand all weekend.  I was one of the first people in the venue on Sunday and they didn't even have them at the Club level merch stands.  Would have been cool to have those with my 2014 Ratdog Masthay poster, oh well.  The Munk One was also cool, wasn't that VIP only or something though?  I didn't see those sold either.  I was pretty disapointed that Stanley Mouse was only commisioned to do the Everything is Dead poster for the field museum and nothing for the actual shows.  I would imagine that was his choice, I doubt Shapiro or any member of the band wouldn't have wanted Mouse to make any of the show posters.  That would have been awesome."

I have been watching ebay closely. Some people are putting all kinds of old stuff on ebay hoping to catch some of that hot market, nobody is really biting. Eventually this market will cool, especially with the incentive to print more posters. I'm waiting it out. I too was tempted by the beautiful posters I saw but did not want to carry around all nite.

gratefuldead,3cskh2,Moonpile,0,Fri Jul 10 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"What the heck?  It really is ""Faring thee well""!  That does not actually make grammatical sense except as an incomplete statement using the verb ""to fare"" in the sense of ""to smooth out, to sand down"", as in ""[I am] faring thee well"", or ""I'm smoothing you out.""    The sense I think we all mean, to bid someone goodbye, uses the imperative.  Unless I'm missing something, in which case I'd appreciate any thoughts."

gratefuldead,3crjek,sylvanriv,53,Fri Jul 10 04:57:48 2015 UTC,"Continued here as I ran out of room-   Now, here are some show recommendations!   7-16-1966 - this show contains the best and clearest examples of their blues playing. Check out Pigpen on ""Big Boss Man"" and ""Next Time You See Me"".  3-18-1967 - this show both contains bluesy playing and proto-psychedelic songs. You can basically see the Dead evolving. For the proto-psychedelia, check out the jam out of ""Viola Lee Blues"".   2-14-1968 - this show is the best example of 68 music. It's heavily psychedelic, but it hasn't fully evolved. Check out the whole segment from ""Dark Star"" all the way to ""In the Midnight Hour"".  3-1-1969 - this is one of the best shows from probably the best and most psychedelic run of 1969. The tracks you saw in the 1968 show are now heavily jammed and lead into one another. Check out all the songs from Cryptical to...aw hell, just listen to the whole show!  2-13-1970 - this show contains both country-rock and psychedelic rock. Check out all the psychedelia in the earlier part of the show and see how it transitions to stuff like ""Dire Wolf"" and ""Uncle John's Band"".  2-18-1971 - during this show, they phased in 5 new songs. They're all very good and this was the last show played with Mickey.   8-6-1971 - this show is played with only Billy, and while containing similar songs to the above show, it has a different sound, and it's one of the best of the year.  4-17-1972 - this was one of the best Europe Tour shows, and you can see how the sound of the band was evolving into a very original sound.   8-27-1972 - considered one of the best shows they ever played, this was a show with incredible jams on things like ""Dark Star"" and ""Playing in the Band"". Keith may be the MVP of this show.  6-10-1973 - possibly the longest show they ever played, this monster is a perfect example of how the Dead were getting jazzier. Keith shines, as does Jerry.  6-18-1974 - this is true jazzy Dead. Check out ""Eyes of the World"", and pay attention to Billy's hi-hat focused drumming, Phil's bass line in the intro, and Keith's piano.   8-6-74 - another jazzy one that I felt I couldn't go without writing about- EPIC Eyes and The Other One!  8-13-1975 - technically during their hiatus, Mickey was back and they were playing some new tunes. Listen to ""Help on the Way->Slipknot->Franklin's Tower"" and the jams in the three.  8-4-1976 - quite a bass heavy recording, this both gives an excellent sense of how Phil played and how the whole band was transitioning out of jazz and more into an ""original"" sound again.   5-7-1977 5-8-1977 5-9-1977 - these three shows, especially the middle one, from Ithaca, are considered some of the all-time best. Incredibly strong playing. If you only listen to one thing, listen to ""Scarlet Begonias->Fire On the Mountain"" from Ithaca.  7-8-1978 - one of the last excellent Keith shows. Everything here shines, but check out the ""Wharf Rat->Franklin's Tower->Sugar Magnolia->Terrapin Station"" segment.  10-27-1979 - an early Brent show. You can hear how the sound of the band readjusted fitting in with him. It's an excellent show with a lot of jamming.   6-21-1980 - there are many better shows than the acoustic shows with electric sets in October 1980 to showcase the Dead's early 80s electric playing. This is quite heavy and jams very hard.  10-31-1980 - check out the acoustic set. Some of these songs were even originally electric songs played acoustically. Sounds freakin' awesome!  5-1-1981 - the Dead played fast and hard in the early 80s. Check out Jerry's flamenco-style intro on ""Let It Grow""!  7-31-1982 - more excellent early-80s heavy Dead. Check out ""Scarlet Begonias->Fire On the Mountain""!  7-13-1984 - this show demonstrates the heaviness and ""phatness"" of 1984. They also happened to break out ""Dark Star"" after a few years!  10-12-1984 - Jerry's vocals sound awful on most of these songs, but his solos are through the roof!!!  6-30-1985 - one of the best shows of 1985. Jerry's sounding and playing even better and it's got the best ""Shakedown Street"" of all time! Also check out ""Cryptical Envelopment->The Other One"".  3-20-1986 - 1986 simply wasn't a great year for the Dead. But this was a pretty good show. They also broke out ""Box of Rain"" after 13 years!  3-24-1987 - Jerry's back, people! Everyone's amped up and while the playing isn't insane, the energy is! Check out ""Terrapin Station"".  7-17-1989 - Absolutely incredible! The jams here are unreal. Check out ""China Cat -> Rider"" and ""Playing in the Band"" and ""Uncle John's Band"".   3-24-1990 - Spring 1990 was an incredible tour! Check out the whole show here, Jerry's on fire!  3-29-1990- Branford Marsalis sat in playing saxophone. This made for a FUCKING incredible show, with incredible interplay between Jerry and Branford. Listen to all of the second set.   9-20-1990 - Vince and Bruce were on board, and this show contains some hardcore intense jams. Check out ""China Cat -> Rider"" and ""Dark Star"".  6-17-1991 - this show contains the only ""Eyes of the World"" opener ever played. The whole show is exquisite, but check out ""Eyes"", ""Brown Eyed Women"" and the whole second set.  5-26-1993 - full of energy, especially for 1993! ""Playing in the Band"" is a monster.  9-22-1993 - Saxophonist David Murray sat in for this show, and it's overall very strong. Check out the ""Help->Slip->Franklin's"" opener and ""Dark Star.  10-1-1994 - in a bad year, this is a standout. ""Help->Slip->Franklin's"" and ""Scarlet->Fire"" are awesome, and ""So Many Roads"" is a top 3 easily.  3-18-1995 - definitely one of the best 1995 shows. When no show was very good, this was a relief. ""Visions of Johanna"" is an epic, and ""Iko Iko"" is ridiculous and crazy.  5-26-1995 - often remarked upon as the last ""good"" overall show, this contains some monster (for 1995) renditions. Check out ""Help->Slip->Franklin's"" and ""Scarlet->Fire"".  7-9-1995 - this show's a hard listen. Jerry's out of it for most of it. He pulled himself together and played the best ""So Many Roads"" he'd ever done, and ""Black Muddy River"" was also a masterpiece. Many, including myself, hear him sing ""LAST muddy river"" instead of ""black muddy river"" in the first verse. The show concludes with ""Box of Rain"", with Phil being quoted as saying ""because I couldn't stand the thought of ending the tour with one of Jerry's most sorrowful songs.""  Now, I'm sure many of you are wondering what to listen to when you're listening to a heady Dead jam. What I personally enjoy to do if I'm somewhat overwhelmed is listen to a single instrument. So I'll for example hear Keith, and just follow what he's doing for a bit. Then I'll see how that combines with say, what Jerry is playing, and then with Bob, and eventually I'll have the full picture. Generally, if you can't tell who's playing on a recording, there are some cues. Jerry generally plays leads, and plays with a lot of chromatic scales up and down the fretboard. Bob has a distinct, kind of metally chordal sound.   I hope this guide has at least been somewhat helpful! If there's anything you guys feel I should add, please let me know!"

The entire acoustic and country set is over the top great.  4-29-1971 - excellent 71 show, in a similar vein to 2-18-1971. Ripple is gorgeous and all the jammed out songs are incredible versions. This is a must-listen.  8-6-1974 - absolutely incredible, fast and inspired playing here. Eyes of the World is one for the ages, as is Playin' in the Band.  6-9-1977 - more awesomeness from one of their best years- they're all rippin' it up! Help->Slip->Franklin's, Loser, Mississippi Half Step, They Love Each Other.... this is definitely one to listen to all the way through.  4-16-1978 - Jerry's on fire! Coked out, likely, but on fire nonetheless! Fast and killer playing, check out Peggy-O, Dire Wolf and Estimated->Eyes.  10-16-1981 - a little one-off show in a tiny club in Amsterdam, the Dead are at their bar-rockin', hully-gullyin' best and it's awesome. First Turn On Your Lovelight in nearly ten years.  10-10-1982 - top 5 of 1982 easily. Looks Like Rain and Cassidy are all time versions, and the whole show is superb.  10-15-1983 - one of the best shows out of the first year of Jerry heading steeply downhill. First St. Stephen in years, and China->Rider->Playin' is superb.  9-20-1991 - after a relatively uninspired first set, legend has it Bruce told Jerry to get his shit together. That's where the ""Help->Slip->FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN"" in the second set comes from. Trust me, it's great."

The three night run at Winterland in June 1977 should definitely be on this list! Help/Slip/Franklins from the final night, June 9th, is the best version ever recorded, in my own humble opinion. Franklins Tower is so full of energy and passion that I can't help but smile every single time I hear it - it's pure Dead joy from start to finish (and it's 17 minutes long!) Google ""Grateful Dead 6/9/1977"" and you'll be able to find it.

gratefuldead,3crjek,GD_NRPS,2,Fri Jul 10 22:04:51 2015 UTC,1.) She was a good singer. At the time she joined the Dead she was already an established backup singer. If you've ever heard her with her current band she's awesome.   2.) Most of her singing issues came from the fact she usually didn't have a monitor on stage. It's next to impossible to sing in that sort of environment without being able to hear yourself.   3.) I don't think she was always that bad. Check out 4/23/77. I was listening to that the other day and though to myself that it was a good example of what she sounded like when she was able to hear herself. I think she sounds great at the Winterland 77 shows too.   Plus I think she was hot :)

His main electric axes were: –1965 and '66: Guild Starfire –1967: Guild Starfire and 1957 Gibson Les Paul –1968: a different Gibson Les Paul –1969: Gibson SG –1970: 1963 Sunburst Strat until May, then back to Gibson SG –1971: Sunburst Les Paul until March and April, custom built guitar (Alembic) until May, '57 Fender Strat (nicknamed ""Alligator"" because of the sticker on the pick guard, given to him by Graham Nash) until summer, Gibson Les Paul TV  –1972: Alligator until June, Sunburst Strat, then back to Alligator –1973: Alligator (last used Roosevelt Stadium on 8/1/73), then Wolf (custom guitar by Doug Irwin).  –1974: Wolf  –1975: Travis Beam TB 1000A (aluminum-necked guitar) –1976 and '77: Travis Bean TB500 until Fall '77, Wolf –1978: Wolf –1979: played an Ibanez Musician with Reconstruction (1979-08-10!), but his main guitar was Tiger (Doug Irwin, debuted 1979-08-04)  Tiger was his main guitar for the next 11 years.  –1988-'89: Black Strat w/ MIDI synthesized sounds during space –1989 (fall): Wolf with MIDI –1990: Rosebud (Doug Irwin, debuted 1989-12-31) –1993: Lightning Bolt (built by Stephen Cripe, debuted 1993-08-07 with the Jerry Garcia Band) –April 1995: Top Hat (built by Stephen Cripe as a backup for Lightning Bolt, but rarely played)  –During the last show at Soldier Field, Garcia had trouble with Rosebud, so went to his backup Tiger and finished his last show on his long-time guitar."

gratefuldead,3crjek,twm055,2,Fri Jul 10 18:35:04 2015 UTC,"Good work OP. This is impressive!  And no offense, but...  For people newly interested in the Grateful Dead, I think jumping headfirst into the huge (and hugely subjective) catalog of live shows is the wrong direction.   Each show is like a three hour investment, and there's no way a n00b can discern between a mediocre version of [X] song VS something unique or noteworthy.   But the studio (and traditional live) albums are (relatively) short, and more directly to the point. They give the new listener a solid base from which to expand to live performances, and should enhance the appreciation of what's been done to the basic song...  In the time it takes to listen to one concert on your list, somebody could listen to American Beauty 3 times through, and have a really good feel for all those songs...   This would be the list I would focus on if I was going to do an introductory course on the GD  Please don't get me wrong, though- What you've done so far is an excellent second step for the new head! Let's just get them all on the same page before we start blowing their minds with the richness and diversity of the band in their real element. :)  Peace"

I found it interesting to see where your list overlapped with mine and some of the glaring holes in mine.

In retrospect a lot of it was probably Jerry's issues going on - and a lot of what I hated was the sound they chose for him. Jerry did not want him playing organ because it was Brent's sound. I think simply having him on a B-3 would have made him less bothersome to me. I always wanted someone like Merl Saunders or Melvin. I remember seeing him walking around at the Golden Gate Garcia memorial looking crushed and no one was talking to him. Hopefully at least Wavy gave him a hug like he did me. RIP Vince."

gratefuldead,3csj0t,TouchofTrey,22,Fri Jul 10 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"Mickey is a huge part of it too. He influenced Bill a lot before he left... The Grateful Dead sound the way they do because of the drummers. Imagine a really stiff standard rock drummer playing short versions of mid-60's Pigpen tunes. The Dead turn into prog CCR, probably still get very popular due to their incredible songwriting but rapidly fizzle out as a pop band after bad record sales and low demand for a (relatively) boring live show. Instead we got Billy K, who takes acid, listens to Elvin Jones and countless other guys, get into weird meters and cross/polyrhythms through Mickey Hart and decides to incorporate Jazz percussion principles into Rock and Roll songs. He swings hard and effectively turns every Dead song where possible into some variation on gnarly ass heavy swung psychedelic funk. The best Jack Straws are a great example. Nobody plays Dead tunes like that anymore. Back in the day people would clap and stomp and keep the beat while dancing steadily in-time-non-stop for the entire show. When Billy was 'on' the band was 'on' (for the most part) and the crowd was definitely on. The Grateful Dead are who they are because Bill Kruetzmann figured out how to make entire crowds dance involuntarily by transforming standard Rock beats into psychedelic-as-fuck grooves that swing properly unlike a lot of the famous 'beats' being played by nearly every other Rock drummer of the time. I think Ian Paice could've pulled it off or obviously Tony Williams or someone similarly ridiculous but what Bill (and Mickey) did with those songs is creative to the point of being groundbreaking, at least in Rock-n-Roll. What makes Grateful Dead songs Grateful Dead songs is the rhythms and to this day nobody gets close to Billy's best or is remotely as subtle or expressive in their drum technique. No one can play his tunes properly but him, as I think we all witnessed this these past two weeks, incase anyone forgot...Not even freaking Billy Cobham can really do it right. Bill(K) is a monster and is the sound of Grateful Dead."

gratefuldead,3csj0t,YzenDanek,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:43:35 2015 UTC,"I'm no troll. The vibe of the band seriously changed when Keith left. He was important to the sound. Doesn't make Jerry less important. I'll give him props for being a founder and main songwriter, but I think in terms of playing Keith or Brent were just as significant to the band's overall sound. And I think calling him the best vocalist is a stretch. At times, undoubtedly he was the best,  but he was also the most wildly inconsistent member. On his bad nights, he was dreadful."
gratefuldead,3csj0t,iforgotmyother1,2,Fri Jul 10 15:18:25 2015 UTC,I love Brent but I really liked Keith and his mellowness. 5/18/78 JGB show he shines on Knockin'. One of the best versions Ive ever heard.

gratefuldead,3csj0t,585AM,5,Fri Jul 10 16:26:28 2015 UTC,"There is way too much Jerry worship, but in the same way as John Lennon, you don't have the band without him.  Just losing his vocals takes away half the character of the band.  The Beatles wouldn't have been nearly as listenable either if every song was a McCartney song. The juxtaposition of the different lead singers and the flavor of their songs was a big part of who both of these bands were.  Garcia was way more playful, sardonic, and soulful as a singer, and that mixed it up against Weir's showmanship, yodel and growl. Kimock and Anastasio and Herring and Haynes and a lot of other guys can all bring totally acceptable, and at times even better lead guitar to the Dead's sound, but no one can replace Garcia's vocal style."

The Spring '90 tour is also an extension of this period, and probably the peak. 3-22-90 and 3-29-90 are my favourites.  There are some truly great shows spread all throughout the 80s. 6-21-80, 6-30-85, and 9-18-87 are favourites as well, but basically any show in from the beginning of 1989 until the end of the Spring '90 tour is gold."

It was the Live/Dead Dark Star (and ensuing suite) that did it for me.   I definitely think that the, like, good ol' grateful dead / pigpen era has more of that classic rawk thing going on that the uninitiated would expect from the band rather than more mellow / less edge and Brent's jangly keys or short shorts bobby screaming everywhere. For instance, I adore the shit out of Foolish Heart, but it's about the furthest thing from fillmore power 1971 dead that I can imagine. But at this point, all the variety, it's just more to love for me."

Bruce really helped fill in after the irreplaceable Brent went missing and the boys were really firing on all cylinders, some very special times for the boys and Bruce pushed Jerry....  Late 70s are worth a very, very, very occasional visit, it's very saccharine for me.      The golden era of 72 to 74 is nice, especially for the nice Playin and similar jams, there's an energy and intensity of those jams that was never matched in quite the way they were played in that era and in that way and is unique to that era .... I'm warming up to 93 and later but the sloppiness in a lot of 94 and 95 shows makes me sad .... it was even sadder watching Jerry fall apart as he was obviously sick and peeps around me didn't notice at all and didn't notice he was completely missing and fucking up lyrics with a teleprompter the size of a bus in front of him and called in solos.      One thing commonly forgotten is that Vince was a major force in bringing in a lot of the new tunes .... of course, if you were disgusted to hear yet another I Fought the Law encore, that may not be a good thing!"

gratefuldead,3cvljs,sunflowersup,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:57:19 2015 UTC,"He leaked the 3 days chicago run, and that trey was playing guitar...although, he claimed a lot more that didn't happen too...  he said this last november   Since we last discussed the topic of a Core Four reunion of the Dead, a lot of things have changed, and plenty of divergent but credible opinions have emerged about what may or may not unfold in 2015. As I have stated twice, it is a fact that concert promoters have been demanding exorbitant insurance policies for any show, tour, or series of dates involving a Core Four reunion that includes Bobby. For example, it was revealed earlier this week that promoters required the Rolling Stones to take out a $29.2 million insurance policy for their 18-show tour of Australia and New Zealand earlier this year in the event a show, shows, or the tour were canceled due to death in the band, a death in the band's family, or a sickness or illness. From what I understand, the Core Four's ""camp"" has developed a strategy to deal with the insurance policy issue: The band plans on playing just one or two major headlining gigs this summer at a festival or festivals, and a series of residencies on the West and East coasts. The ""camp"" sees this as a way to circumvent concert promoters' demands, with the goal to work with as few promoters as possible. A 2015 reunion of the Dead featuring the Core Four seems, suddenly, despite my earlier-given lack of optimism, very real. The afore-mentioned strategy of having the Dead limit their appearances in 2015 made promoters more amenable; as stated, the Dead, apparently, are looking to headline a single festival or two and play a series of West Coast and East Coast residencies - in arena settings or a handful of stadium dates. Phil and Bobby still have a little patching up to do, as Mr. Lesh privately rode Bobby pretty hard during the past 18 months. The Furthur cancellation at Lockn' in September put a serious dent in everyone's coiffeurs, none more so than Phil's close friend, Lockn' co-promoter Peter Shapiro. Speaking of Mr. Shapiro, and Phil, and knowing of Phil's deep loyalty and appreciation to Peter for the highly-successful and concept-redefining residencies the pair will conclude on December 30 and 31, 2014 with the Phil and Joe Russo shows at the Capitol, I'd say it would not be a longshot to predict that any festival headlining slot by the Dead in 2015 would most likely go down at Lockn', the pre-eminent jamband festival in America, and fast becoming the most-exciting festival, period, in the U.S. My ""sources"" in the music industry have confirmed that the Dead are already in negotiation with Lockn' to headline the Arrington, Virginia-based festival that's held on hundreds of acres of pristine, starry-skied countryside. Should a 50th anniversary tour and a headlining slot at Lockn' go down, my hope is the Dead will study the model on 50th anniversary tours or shows utilized by the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones (as well as the Allmans' farewell shows). All were tributary, involved all or most of the past members, and were anything but hokey. And should it happen, this is what I am hearing about the Dead lineup in 2015: the Core Four plus Bruce Hornsby on keyboards. Apparently, to my disappointment, Jeff Chimenti will not be involved. I hope that changes. Hornsby makes sense on a number of levels, including financial, but Chimenti would be the man, for me, at the keys. A number of what may be described as near-silly issues have/ had to be resolved, from what I understand, before the choice (or choices) on lead guitar could be worked out. For one, Billy, who unmercifully ripped Furthur's choice of John Kadlecik as guitarist in 2009, had to make repairs there. For another, in order for Steve Kimock to be involved, an issue dating to 1999, between Kimock and a ""camp insider,"" had to be hashed out. And, from what I hear, should this reunion unfold, the band is seemingly committed to, and working with, the concept of using more than one lead guitarist. How that would work is unclear. Would a different, lone lead guitarist play each night or for each short residency ? Would there be a night-long rotation of leading men at each gig ? The guitarists are known to be John Kadlecik, Steve Kimock and Warren Haynes, with a fourth, unnamed guitarist, possibly Trey Anastasio or Barry Sless, also being considered; Stu Allen, according to my music promotion source, is not, to my disappointment, on the short list. The Core Four with Bruce and a three or four guitarist rotation. Something for everyone, we hope !! My same booking ""source"" is reporting that Lockn' is deep in negotiation with the Dead to be the host for the band's 2015 major festival headlining gig. In fact, Mr. Shapiro and the Lockn' Festival are attempting to pull off the greatest coup in jamband festival history in 2015: having the Dead and Phish headline on alternating nights. As the String Cheese Incident and Umphrey's McGee did at Lockn' in 2014, expect to see Phish and the Dead playing alternating sets. The plan is to have Phish play an opening set, followed by an opening set from the Dead. Phish would then play their ""closing"" set, followed by the Dead, who would also perform the night's closing set. The following night, the order will be reversed, with the Dead up first, and Phish closing. Phish fans, meet the Deadheads. Deadheads, say hello to the Phish fans. We hear that Lockn' is also trying to nail down another special treat. As you know, Widespread Panic backed John Fogerty in 2013 for a set of Creedence and Fogerty classics and did the same this past summer with Stevie Winwood. For next summer, the goal is to have WSP back Teresa Williams and Larry Campbell for a set of Band and Levon Helm classics !! Have a happy Wednesday — Scott"

He was constantly getting hugged by Phil after songs (Standing on the Moon being the most obvious), and was given the all-clear to sing/solo more as the band became more comfortable in his abilities. Bobby came out in a ""Let Trey Sing!"" t-shirt! I honestly don't think anyone could have done a better job, and I was pretty skeptical of the decision coming in."

Just to get this out of the way, the first night in Santa Clara was by far the worst of the five shows, and I would attribute this largely to the set list, which covered far too much material from the band's early period, and none of it very well. I admired the commitment to stray from the ""hit parade,"" but songs like ""Alligator,"" ""Born Cross-Eyed,"" ""Cream Puff War,"" ""Viola Lee Blues,"" ""Cryptical Envelopment"" and ""What's Become of the Baby"" should have been integrated gradually over the course of the five shows (or skipped entirely)"

During and after the show the Warfeild was buzzing with activity. The scene was absolutely beautiful. I meet some of the first deadheads ever - actual Pranktsers and followers from the beginning. The twinkling sidewalks of San Fran are home to this whole movement. The city is accustomed to hippies - some portions of it seemed to laid out just for the minds that like to wonder. I also noticed a tolerance in the local population that is usually unseen in a lot of U.S. cities. Perhaps it's just a northwest coast thing. I've been to Washington state and Alaska they were much the same. While in Chicago I was invited to a similar gathering. A private party held for actual Pranktsers and old road crew. Sometime in the early morn a brick was thrown from a moving car, ""a local no doubt"" according to witnesses. Minor injuries ""Thank Jah"". Five days were dedicated to Chicago and not one went by without their being plenty of ignorance to be seen.

Before anything was announced (Fare Thee Well shows, etc.) for the 50th anniversary, my mind was already spinning in the possibilities. I truly thought that I would see the Grateful Dead at Seaside Park this summer. (I have attended half a dozen times, and this summer will be my fourth consecutive.)   I was surprised by the lineup this year, as it doesn't include any members of the Dead, and instead has a heavy Allman Brothers vibe. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the Allman Brothers, but I really thought this would be the year that the festival returned to its ""Gathering of the Tribe"" roots and went full-on Grateful Dead celebration.   You do have Dark Star Orchestra headlining Thursday night, which should be great, but there seems to be no special recognition about what this summer means in terms of the Grateful Dead and the purpose of this festival, which to me is a big disappointment.   You do have the ""Vibes 20th Anniversary Spectacular"" on Saturday night. Joe Russo is in there, who has the smoking Almost Dead cover band, but there's not any mention of the Grateful Dead. Instead my impression is that this is a celebration of Gathering of the Vibes, rather than the celebration of the Grateful Dead that it should be.   I sincerely hope that I will be proven wrong. Perhaps the success of the Chicago shows and the high tide of interest that the band is receiving will shake some sense into the heads of whoever puts this thing together and realize the significance of this moment and the duty that they have to Deadheads to bring the tribe together in a big way."

gratefuldead,3cu3i5,Giant_Cat,5,Fri Jul 10 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"Jerry loved the Heads.  He really did, and took great care to make sure that the scene was as good as it could be.    What killed him was Diabetes, Heroin, and Cigs.  They were most likely his coping mechanisms for being caught up in the Grateful Dead Rock and Roll machine. It was a big business and employed a lot of folks.  It could not simply cease.    I am convinced his true love was bluegrass and playing old standards.  He took shelter in the music and holed up with Grisman a lot.  Not that he didn't love playing with GD, I just think it was the music that fed his soul and what he longed to do full time.  We all have things we are committed to.    That's my take on it."

At the beginning of the show you get a chorus in effect, by the end you're 7 or 8 minutes out of sync. It's just a nightmare. I've never done a Matrix,  but I've worked on film projects where I'm trying to sync sound to image that was recorded at variable speeds. The effort is just so hard to justify."

I would now say my bias comes form the interaction and body language more than the music that was very good at times and dismal at slight moments.   Chicago was a different story.  Also I must add that in post production rather than live mixes, it will be a far superior product come November.  This cash cow aint in the barn yet. The DVD /CD will be mixed and edited correctly.

I'd bet the backup plan was to add the 2 SC shows to round it off and keep it at the same price. Just a hunch but otherwise they better do some price adjusting.   I may jump on the set if they add the SC shows at the same price.

She has talked about seeing the Dead in tiny rooms in 65-68, and the weirdness of watching them go from playing in the park for free all the way up to filling gigantic arenas. She saw them through the late 70's, I believe, before stopping.  To be frank, though, she was often blown out of her mind on acid at these shows (her own words), and doesn't have very coherent memories of the shows. I've tried poking and prodding to find some stuff out, but it basically goes like this - high on acid, doing goofy shit, the Grateful Dead were playing.  I'm relatively certain she was at the human be-in, for example, based on what she's said. I'm pretty sure she was on the white lighting batch, but... She doesn't have coherent memories. It's all a big mush. I won't lie, though... I have looked through videos of those old events to try to find her. Nothing yet.   She's awesome. One of the best people I know. One of the few coherent stories I've gotten from her was at Winterland (maybe) where she ended up serving drinks behind the bar, or hiding underneath it. She doesn't remember. In her own words, she was a ball of mud. She remembered Jerry's guitar being like a piercing eagle, and a security guard calling her a ray of crazy sunshine."
