Mine was totally cool for 10 minutes, then decided to jump out like a dumbass while we were still moving. Almost ran him over. Fortunately he only scratched his chin a little when he landed. Just trying to save others the unbelievable panic I felt when I realized I could have accidentally killed my fluff ball. Cute as hell video though!"
Pomeranians,3dlqqa,jdblackb,4,Fri Jul 17 08:20:59 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, he's wearing a harness which is attached to a leash tied around the handlebars. I had the exact same thing happen when I first tested the basket out. He was totally fine for the first 10 minutes then he saw someone walking on the sidewalk and took a leap. luckily I was going slow and he jumped to the side. He took a tumble and only scratched his snout. Too scary"

Pomeranians,3cczi7,JAYDEA,5,Mon Jul 6 23:13:50 2015 UTC,"Poms definitely won't tear things up like bug dogs will, but they are lots of work especially puppies.  Grooming/brushing needs to happen more frequently than with other breeds, and poms have a tendency to be a little stubborn when it comes to training. That being said, they're great dogs and will be wonderful companions for many years. Just know what you're getting yourself in to :). If you have any specific questions just ask."
Pomeranians,3cczi7,shiner986,3,Mon Jul 6 23:46:31 2015 UTC,"Poms are a lot of fun; they are a constant source of amusement.  They are not as temperamental as chihuahuas and, generally,  much smarter and friendlier.  They're great apartment dogs, but they do need exercise and training, just like a bigger dog would.     My pom never ate anything weird, except for the unfortunate time she got in the litterbox (ugh) and she never chewed on anything around the house,  though she did want to dig on the couch (again,  training is your friend).  Pom's are fairly independent for little dogs, which means they're somewhat less likely to suffer severe separation anxiety, which, in addition to lack of exercise and stimuli, is what can lead to destructive behavior in dogs.  Some breeds are more likely than others to exhibit destructive behaviors and poms are not one of those breeds.       Just remember,  just because they're small,  doesn't mean they don't need exercise or training.   Good luck!"
Pomeranians,3cczi7,DustyValentine,5,Tue Jul 7 13:32:24 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about getting a puppy, maybe consider getting a rescue? There are many  pom and small dog rescues out there. They live a long time (average is 12 to 16 years), so adopting one who is already 4-6 years old means you can avoid some of the puppy behaviors and still have a furry friend for many years. I would suggest though, puppy or adult, getting your new dog(any breed) into obedience training early so you can teach them basic commands and start that bond where they know you are the leaders."
Pomeranians,3cczi7,elizabethraine,3,Tue Jul 7 04:14:41 2015 UTC,"Yes! I got my pom from a pom rescue. She was three years old and house trained.  It was great. She still needed some training, but not bathroom training.  She was the best dog.  Puppies are adorable, but an insane amount of work.  I recommend an adult dog if you don't have the time/ inclination to deal with raising a puppy."
Pomeranians,3cczi7,DustyValentine,4,Tue Jul 7 13:19:50 2015 UTC,"For sure! My pom is still struggling a bit with potty training, but she took really well to other training and is very affectionate and a lot calmer than a tiny puppy, although she still loves to play. I would love to rescue a puppy or at least a slightly younger dog (I got her when she was 6) in the future too though."
Pomeranians,3cczi7,elizabethraine,4,Tue Jul 7 13:23:36 2015 UTC,"poms aren't so bad when it comes to destroying things. my pom can chew through shoelaces and cords like a mofo, but the good news is that she can't really get much else in her mouth. i think training will depend on the pom, my pom was actually super easy to train and poms are very intelligent dogs. that said, small breeds are often difficult to housetrain, simply because they have smaller bladders and need to go out more often, and also people have a tendency to baby them/carry them.   the main things you have to look out for when it comes to poms are barking and exercise. they can be VERY yappy if you don't train them to be quiet early on, so that will take some work. also, they need more exercise than their size would lead you to believe. unlike most toy breeds, poms were bred down from working dogs not too long ago, and they have the energy of sled dogs.   puppies are a lot of responsibility, so you might want to look into rescuing? ocpoundhounds is a great small dog rescue org in socal."
Pomeranians,3cczi7,axianaa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:01:49 2015 UTC,I've owned quite a few poms they are social and tend to attach to one person more than another. My two bear and honey (male and female) were inseparable even when honey died bear was visually depressed for weeks.   In other words they enjoy being in small packs. It's better to have two than just one. In my opinion.

Pomeranians,3bshva,strongtoes004,2,Wed Jul 1 21:11:50 2015 UTC,Yup. To add: when I work 12 hour shifts I take whatever time needed to go home (lucky enough to work within minutes of the house) and let my old pooch outside so she can at least relieve her bladder and such.

Pomeranians,3bshva,sleepsoncouches,2,Thu Jul 2 04:19:33 2015 UTC,"Is doggy daycare an option once or twice a week to break up the routine? Even someone who can come by and take her for a walk once in awhile? My poms sleep a good portion of the day, even when I am home, so she is probably not too upset about it. I would make sure you are taking her on a stimulating walk before you leave in the morning. (I mean a new place, or new path each time so she can see and smell new things.) If you fully wear her out she should sleep most of the time you're not home. You could do a baby gate and keep her confined to a single room, that is what I do with mine when my husband and I are both out."
