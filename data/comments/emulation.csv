It really is a travesty that Sony went to such great measures to prevent piracy, when it is arguable that piracy was what kept the PSP alive for so long.  I mean, it's cool that emulation was possible via the native PSP emulation on the Vita, but now that we're at a point where we are emulating stuff solely through the Vita and NOT through the emulator, we can potentially see some amazing stuff.  Keep at it, hackers. You're doing God's work."

I'm not so desperate to have yet another half-arsed media streaming box and another way to play SNES/PSX games on a television that I'd like to see the complete destruction of the console to bring it about.   Frankly, that's all the Wii homebrew scene ended up amounting to - a few fun little demos, WiiMC, 16-bit system emulators, and USB loaders for current-gen piracy. I'm glad it existed - I had a huge amount of fun with it. But the scene emerged at a time when a HTPC-esque solution was completely out of the reach of most people - nowadays, a Raspberry Pi 2's enough to emulate almost anything feasible on the Wii U for ~£30, and's significantly more flexible in every way.  What would we get out of native emulation on the Wii U? A better N64 emulator, a better PSX emulator, and perhaps a Dreamcast emulator that'll end up being abandoned mid-development. The hardware's not really capable of much more, and anything else can already be done just fine in vWii mode."

Take the others advice, spend some time learning how Retroarch works, and it will be better for all your emulation needs.  I wish that other emulators were in Retroarch..."
emulation,3e0b0u,tomkatt,2,Tue Jul 21 12:10:45 2015 UTC,"This doesn't sound like a ePSXe specific or complicated issue based on the specs posted. The biggest problem is with OP's integrated graphics. Generally GPU reads and Writes is what's selected for the graphics plugin in ePSXe, but that doesn't play nice without a dedicated GPU (I know from experience with my old Llano APU based HTPC). Setting GPU to only read, or only write, and same for buffer will likely fix the problem.  Also, it could be OP is reading directly from the disc, which doesn't tend to work well with any emulators, better to rip the disc to ISO."
emulation,3e0b0u,tomkatt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:40 2015 UTC,"Yes I do use the CD directly. Does rip the means I can use it anymore after that ?   I will give a try to what you say on ePSXe, but so far pSX 1.13 has been working great so far for me."
emulation,3e0b0u,tomkatt,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:24 2015 UTC,"""Ripping"" the disc means copying the data to your hard drive in a format that the emulator can read (generally an ISO, which can be either loaded as a virtual disc, or in most cases, just loaded directly with the emulator).  Emulators don't generally work fantastically with the original discs because of the limits on read speeds. The PS1 read at 2x CD speed, or around 2.45 Mbits, or 300-ish kilobytes per second I think. By contrast, even the slowest SATA drive will read at 1.5 Gbits, or over 1570000 kilobytes (~150MB) per second.  For a more specific example, even on very fast hardware, a game with sensitive timing like Legend of Dragoon is near unplayable from the disc. In combat, the button timings will stutter and suffer slowdowns and speedups due to the disc reads. Likewise, something like Dance Dance Revolution will also be unplayable. However if you rip those discs to images (ISO, or BIN/CUE files), they're completely playable and run without issues.  So as a rule, emulators work better if you burn the disc to an image. This doesn't damage your disc, but it makes it no longer necessary to play, you can just keep the original disc as a backup.  IMGBurn is probably the simplest software I've ever used to make disc backups (ISOs). It's very straight forward to do."
emulation,3dyqn0,krawhitham,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"That's a great build! It's true that Dolphin uses a maximum of 3 cores, but it should work very well with the G3258. I would read some reviews of that motherboard to see if it supports overclocking to 4.5 Ghz though, from memory the 'B85' series motherboards are business-oriented, whereas, the Z series ones offer the best performance from overclocking, and then getting a compatible motherboard for overclocking, and a G3258 can start becoming cost prohibitive. Something I could recommend is looking at a non-overclockable processor, like an i3-4150 and check out how it performs with the games you are looking to run on the machine on Youtube. It leaves out the hassle of an overclock and also helps you keep motherboard costs down.  The 750Ti should be more than adequate for your needs, and yes, it does support Gamestream so you should be able to stream to Limelight/Moonlight.

emulation,3dyqn0,VERNEJR333,2,Mon Jul 20 18:51:58 2015 UTC,"To piggyback on what /u/darklynx4 said, I'd agree with getting a i5-4690k. It's a great processor and will definitely run Dolphin and PCSX2. Also, PCSX2 is capable of using three+ cores, and does see a performance boost in many games with the additional core with the MTVU hack enabled.  If you have a Microcenter near you, you can get the 4690k for $200 with an additional $30 discount on the Mobo. With that, I'd recommend either this or this budget motherboard and you'll walk away with the CPU and mobo for about $215 + tax, which should keep it within your budget, or pretty close.  If you don't have a microcenter nearby though, that might not work out, I haven't seen that processor that cheap, or with such a good mobo bundle price anywhere else, even online.  I'm also concerned about the power supply you chose. You can easily get a 450w or 500w PSU for around $40-$50, so I don't know why you'd skimp on a 300w unit. That's asking for trouble once your system's under load. 300w is the minimum requirement for the video card you chose, but going straight for the minimum isn't exactly a great idea.  I'd also agree with /u/VERNEJR333 on the Radeon R270. It will outperform the 750TI by a good margin, and even with the prevalence for Dolphin and PCSX2 to perform better with Nvidia, the R270 should still be a better choice simply because it outperforms the 750 TI that much (something like double the performance) in the same price range."

BUT quite a few ps2 games only properly work using software rendering, which would require like atleast an i5-4690K for more cores to use for extra rendering threads and mtvu multi-threading.  if you are looking to be able to emulate almost all ps2 games and almost all gamecube/wii games, id maybe lean more towards the i5.

Then OC that CPU, but you'll want to up the PSU.  Corsair has some very nice semi-modular PSUs in the 500W to 600W range.  If this build is purely dedicated to emulation (to which I will recommend installing Lakka or similar slimmed-down Linux distro) then 8GB of RAM is vastly overkill. Even if you chose to put Windows on this thing, no emulator will even take full advantage of 4GB of RAM.  And incidentally, always aim to use the latest development builds of any emulator you chose. Nearly all emulators I know of, especially PPSSPP, Dolphin, PCSX2, mGBA, Desmume, etc rarely publish a ""stable"" build. Dolphin latest dev builds have astronomical improvements over its last stable build. Some games that previously wouldn't even boot are fully playable with little to no visible errors."

I've just activated 2 options (ADVANCED_CRT and PIXELART_CRT) with custom settings. Here's what i got on Genesis and another one on PlayStation 2 in 1440p. I think every 2D element looks fine with that. Those are my tastes, of course, and it's really not the most authentic settings for a CRT render.

Most of them will work properly in software rendering mode.  But im using a 4.5ghz overclocked i7-4770k, and using mtvu multi-thread speedhack, vu cycle stealing at 1 or 2, and 8 extra rendering threads at native resolution.  i barely get full speed play-ability. i get an occasional lag spike lasting only a split second, but its enough to completely break the gameplay of the game, as it will cause you to miss notes and etc.  so yeah unless you plan on overclocking an i5/i7 to 4.5ghz+, probably not going to work out well.

Specifically, the cue describes where in the bin file the various audio/data tracks start and end.

emulation,3dp4fw,EmulateAnyThing2,11,Sat Jul 18 02:39:18 2015 UTC,"I kind of have to take exception to the last point (about emulator programming, not MS Paint). Before I got hooked into emu-dev, I was making little PC games (Mass Blaster - Dual Ship Shoot'em Up), so I can speak from experience about the two sides.  First let me say that practically any domain of programming can be ""super hard"" or difficult. It all depends on the scope, complexity, and availability of tools and resources for a given project. Writing a compiler, an OS, a disassembler, or text-to-speech software can indeed be very challenging tasks. However, I don't think it's appropriate at all to say there is nothing specific to emulation that makes it a harder. As I see it, each area has it's difficulties, with some being greater than others.  Consider that in making an emulator, I essentially need all the tools I would to build a PC game; in my case this meant having SDL, knowing how to use the API (for sound, keyboard/joystick input, graphical output). At this level, my efforts with PC games were not so far apart. However, as soon as I got into the individual components that needed emulation (my first attempts at the GB, e.g. the GBZ80 CPU, the MMU, APU, timers, etc) I found writing a ""basic"" emulator required much more skill than a ""basic"" PC game. That is to say, for my given skill level at the time (10 years of hobbyist programming) emulation pushed what I knew and forced me to be far more creative than any of my previous projects. Now, if you're a seasoned programmer, there may not be a great difference between making a GB emulator and making 8-bit games, but for me it was quite apparent that emulation was a new tier of programming. Keep in mind, I'd dabbled with all sort of things before emulation and games (encryption, stenography, websites and databases, Sonic fangames, tons of Linux bash scripting stuff, OpenGL 3D rendering, blah blah, etc), but out of the lot I found emulation to be the most taxing. Consequently, emulation happened to be the most rewarding.  Off the top of my head, one of the biggest difficulties in emulation is hardware documentation. For many pioneers, the documentation is hands-on: probing the hardware via homebrew, finding exploits (if necessary) to run homebrew in the first place, and even hacking the hardware itself just to take a peek under the hood. Reverse engineering, imo, is probably more prevalent in emulation than in most other fields of computer science (anti-virus/malware research might be one of them, after that) and it's not child's play. You honestly have to have a thorough idea of what the hardware is doing (or at least have a good guess) then figure things out on your own, make a software implementation, and see if it's accurate. An intimate knowledge of the underlying hardware is required for every major component just to get an emulator running with some semblance of gameplay.  Even with perfect documentation, it's all about the implementation. When you're telling one machine to act like another, that involves a lot of moving parts, each of which needs to properly do its job in order for the whole to correctly function. Debugging emulators has been far more exhausting than any other program I've ever written. Consider that with a PC game that I myself wrote, I have a relatively large degree of freedom in determining the program flow. I can decide what level to load, the player's position, and what enemies are on screen. I can stop it at my pleasure and inspect whether everything is running fine. With an emulator, I basically hand the program flow over the the game ROM. The ROM decides what it wants to do; the emulator is just there for the ride. If something goes wrong, I don't technically have the source code to see what the emulated game is trying to do. I have to work my way backwards, looking for clues in assembly, checking register values, checking memory values, and setting breakpoints.  Ultimately, I think it would be better to dispel the sort of ""mystique"" that surrounds emulator programming in that it's basically ""voodoo"" that only super elite lvl. 99 Grand Master Programmers can achieve. I kind of feel that regular folks get the impression that only hardcore programmers who eat, sleep, and breathe binary code can even hope to make an emulator. When I was a kid first getting into the emulation scene, I marveled at who these authors were. In my young mind, I always imagined them meticulously dissecting hardware (with Arduino-like hacker kits) and spending hours programming. I never thought I'd be doing the same myself 12-14 years down the road. I never dreamed that making quirky, two-bit programs to do my math homework would lead me to GB/GBC/GBA emulation (and beyond hopefully). So, the focus, in my opinion, should be to get rid of the notion that emulator programming is magic. It's not; it's just plain old dedication, persistence, and a couple of sleepless nights with some energy drinks. And once again, Reddit has brought me to make a Wall of Text...  tl;dr - I'm not saying that emulation is the hardest field of programming to do, but it is harder than other projects, especially in certain regards. It certainly isn't ""black magic"", but it does require programmers to have (or at least develop) a particular level of skill."

I'm not kidding, games commonly spend 20% of the time in CPU emulation and the rest just translating and feeding the GPU with data, and most of that time is spent in driver code. PSP games are often quite unfriendly to modern OpenGL implementations, making tons of tiny draw calls that can't be joined for various reasons.  Next-gen API:s like DX12 and Vulkan (of which I would prefer to use Vulkan, but if that doesn't get widespread I will also make a DX12 backend eventually) greatly reduce the overhead of making small draw calls so will be a performance boon for sure. Also, being able to compile shaders in the background and precompile them will help against the ""shader compilation stuttering"" we are currently seeing a lot of.

emulation,3dfpuy,PinkyThePig,20,Thu Jul 16 17:37:20 2015 UTC,"DX12? I'd imagine that very few would be likely to use it. I'd see Vulkan as a far more likely contender. Emulators are all cross platform already, and while the API itself is not likely to bring any amazing performance boosts for emulators (as GPU performance is typically nearly irrelevant to emulator performance), it could help with having the same codebase run on multiple platforms which means fewer bugs and less maintenance work.  The reasons I lean this way is:   Current OpenGL drivers vary WIDELY in quality, and generally require work arounds and hacks for each OpenGL vendor you support. This means an emulator has more tweaks, more code and more bugs for every platform they want to support. The new Vulkan driver will be more uniform than it ever has been before. Valve&Intel will have an open source Intel driver ready, and Kronos themselves (for the first time) are providing a reference implementation of the non-device specific code (which means less differences between platforms, and less effort needed by the GPU manufacturer to support it). Platform support is way better for Vulkan compared to DX12. DX12 supports Windows 10 (and XBox One, although XBO is irrelevant to emulators). Vulkan Supports: Windows XP(if the GPU vendors still release drivers for it), Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, OS X, Linux, Android and iOS(if Apple isn't retarded). This means you write the GPU code once, and it runs everywhere with minimal/no platform specific changes. The new APIs are a lot more work to code against for the game/emulator developer. Having both a DX12 back end and a Vulkan back end may be less justifiable considering they should do the exact same thing (having both originated from Mantle). Some Vulkan implementations will be open source, which is likely to be much more appealing to the devs working on open source emulators if nothing else than from a philosophy standpoint.   So, as a TL;DR, it is possible that Vulkan would be adopted so that the multi platform support is a cleaner implementation, but there is no similar incentive for adopting DX12."

Having both a DX12 back end and a Vulkan back end may be less justifiable considering they should do the exact same thing (having both originated from Mantle).   Have to agree with number 4 though a lot. These new APIs involve now a lot more work to get stuff done with. Which means the onus is now a lot more on the developer to do things.  imo, since iirc OGL4 support bindless textures already, there goes one of Vulkan's features.

Games like Pokemon had a 3D world with 2D sprite characters that won't be affected by increasing internal resolution.  I use xbrz since they seem to be the best quality but they are also the most demanding. I also switch between the renderers because some games seem to have graphical glitches in one or the other so I switch when needed.
emulation,3de330,RCero,2,Wed Jul 15 16:12:58 2015 UTC,Increasing the resolution could improve some 2D games. Some games zoom in or zoom out sprites and that pixelated them more.  A higher resolution reduces or removes that pixelation and the images remain sharp.
emulation,3de330,healu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:13:59 2015 UTC,Increasing the internal resolution adds more pixels to the 3D models smoothing out the edges. You can't just add more pixels to a 2D flat texture. You have to completely redrawn them which increasing the internal resolution would not do at all.  If you have some examples to prove your point I would be happy to eat my words. :)

In those instances, using a 2x scale rendering would allow you to see every pixel of the 2D object, in so doing increasing it's apparent quality.

emulation,3de330,RCero,2,Wed Jul 15 19:07:36 2015 UTC,"The thing is some 2D games enlarge, reduce or rotate images like we could do with paint. It's not a sequence of sprites, is a transformation of a unique image. The problem is when we take a small sprite (like 50x50 px) and magnify a little (10%, 20%, 30%) the image will turn into another more pixelated and some of its ""pixels"" will be larger than others.  That problem would be less noticeable with a bigger image, but the resolution of the DS is only 256 × 192, therefore all the sprites of DS games would be small. Also, Nintendo DS doesn't support any filter to dissimulate, only can use nearest filter.  When you set a higher internal resolution in DesmumeX432r, all the sprites are scaled to higher resolution (with nearest filter). It looks identical to the native resolution screen, but when the game rotate the sprites they will look very sharp during the rotation (unlike the same game in a real DS). It's the same with the magnification or reduction.  Think about a game that show a image reduced to the 25% of its real size and makes it grow to the 100%. In a Nintendo DS the sprite would have the 25% of the pixels... but in a emulator with 4 times the original resolution, the image would show all its pixels in the first time (and after to  400% ).  There's games like Pokemon Black and White that have 3D scenarios and 2D sprites as characters. When we move away from a sprite it would be reduced with the nearest filter, and the sprite would turn into an unrecognizable mess of pixels. But with a higher resolution that wouldn't happen.

Some extra bonuses of doing it this way is that you get the ability to launch the system menu in Dolphin, and along with it all of your Channels. See here for more information.

Dolphin has a huge list of game specific settings that improves the experience significantly, but this does not work at all when launching a game from another game or system menu. (example trilogy boxes that have games that need different settings).  AFAIK there is no plan on making this possible to do, there are some settings that cant be changed during game. But I think this will get better over time, over all I think the goal of Dolphin is to in the long term remove all hacks."

But otherwise, same controller support. Also, I was really feeling it, so I made a script to show the Lakka boot screen before booting it.  But anyway, since Lakka was made by the Retroarch team, they didn't wanna exclude anyone, so that XMB UI can be used on the Windows version, Mac version, and Linux version.  Tbh, I can make you a video or something showing it, but I think I set up my cores and files improperly or something, because I managed to glitch some stuff up. I've got ~3 of my games running, now for the rest.  But anyway, all Lakka does is boot Retroarch. I swear. You can even change stuff in the Lakka config to have rgui(that ugly-ish Retroarch look).

So the clock speed for the CPU in the super card is 396 MHz and the CPU for the PSP is 333 MHz.  Even with the increased horse power on the super card you are going to need to disable the sound and/or skip frames to play some titles at full speed.  So on paper, the super card would be the way to go.  Go to gbatemp and read the super card stickied thread and you'll be on your way.  A huge caveat, since I own both systems... Suspend.  You really can't do that in a ds flashcart.  You'd need to create a save state (snapshot of where you are in the game) and then shut off the console and remove the card.  As long as that CPU inside the flashcart is engaged it is pulling power and it will drain your battery as it can't fully suspend.  That isn't the case with the PSP.  Just flip the switch and come back to it later, the standby draw from the battery is negligible.  Wololo is your resource for psp stuff   Hope that helps!"

emulation,3d3l8v,Lawnmover_Man,8,Mon Jul 13 12:35:03 2015 UTC,"developers often put padding files to move certain portions of the game to the outside of the disc so it decreases load time.  if they do stuff like that, it'll compress nicely."
emulation,3d3l8v,SCO_1,4,Mon Jul 13 13:34:49 2015 UTC,"Depends on the game. The most compressible game I have is Vagrant Story. (It is also one of the best. :) )  Vagrant Story bin:         750,6 MB  100,0% bin.xz:       73,6 MB    9,8% bin.ecm.xz    57,4 MB    7,6%   ""xz"" is simple compression (like zip, rar or 7z). ""ECM-Tools"" (Error Code Modeler) is some kind of pre-processor, which strips data that is not necessary and would be hard to compress. It is safe to do this. So first using ECM-Tools and then compress it again saves quite some space.  There are also games with audio tracks. You can compress those to flac, mp3 or ogg vorbis with any bitrate you like. The bin file of the software (game) part is usually much smaller. In case of WipEout it is only 65 MB uncompressed. Under Linux you can use CDemu to directly use such files (ecm.xz and flac/ogg) without manual decompression in a virtual cd drive. I actually like it that CDemu does that, so any other program can use compressed cd images on the fly, because the compression logic is handled by CDemu and the virtual drive is nothing more than a normal cd to any emulator or other programs. That saves the developer of emulators the hassle with such stuff.  WipEout Normal (bin + wav): 697,4 MB  100,0% xz + flac:          429,1 MB   61,5% ecm.xz + 96kb ogg:   68,6 MB    9,8%"

Yeah, imo it's not nearly as helpful as actual FPS, but you can work it out (1000.0/number_in_file).

If you have a desktop PC, you want to buy the Pentium G3258. It's a strong CPU and it's only $70. CPU is the most important thing, so this is where you start. Stick the G3258 in a desktop PC and you're pretty much good to go. You might need a GPU if you want to upscale or get things looking good, but you don't need a high-end one (mine was $100 and more than does the job).   The nVidia Shield is a nice thing, but it won't run PS2 games. The only real PS2 emulator is PCSX2 and it's not available for Android.   You can build a desktop PC capable of emulation for less than the price of an nVidia Shield, though. CPU $70, 4GB of RAM $35, refurb Z87 motherboard for $50, PSU for $50. That's $205, you can buy a GPU, controllers, better components and still be ahead of the Shield in both specs and price. Maybe get a pretty case that looks nice under your TV. PCs support Xbox/PlayStation controllers, if you have those, or you can buy duplicates of classic console controllers. It's just one cord to plug them into your TV, all works really nicely."

PSP 3000 does NES, Genesis, Gameboy, GBA, most SNES (games with later chips like MarioRPG can be choppy), PSX, and PSP (of course).  N64 emulation is poor and DS is virtually non-existant.   Android-based phones are usually the best all-around but suffer from finding a controller solution.  You can find mounts that you can use with your PS3 controller, but those aren't as portable.  You can find tiny bt controllers but it is hard to hold them and the phone at the same time.  There are telescopic controllers that collapse for portability and extend to cradle your phone.  There are many options for phones depending on what you want to carry around.  Android has the advantage of Android games and DS emulation as well.

emulation,3cx0o9,vikksorg,5,Sat Jul 11 14:57:01 2015 UTC,"Basically RetroArch has a frontend coded in native android on top of the actual RetroArch application. ""Load Retroarch"" is a shortcut to bring you into the application where you last left off (or if you're starting from scratch, loading the app's main menu).  The options in this frontend are shortcuts for either Android specific options or common options. Some of these options also appear in the RetroArch app UI. So yea, they are redundant.  The UI is really weird. I will not apologize for it. The latest update makes it ""pretty"" but the organization of it it is still terrible. And this doesn't even take the additional frontend into account.  Here's common things you'll want to do:  Install Cores  Cores are the actual emulator engines that allow you to emulate the specific systems using RetroArch. Usually you just want to download them all.  Start out by loading RetroArch. Next, use the touchscreen overlay (or, I guess since you're on a TV, a controller) to move the cursor and go into the online updater. Update everything, and go into the core updater and download everything here as well.  Touchscreen Overlay  Since you're on a TV this isn't applicable to you but might help others. It's easiest to set up overlays from the frontend since it gives you touch input (plus if you screw up the overlay, you can still change it from the frontend) but you can do it from the app UI as well.  In the frontend you go to Settings > Input > Input overlay, then select a new overlay. The default overlay may not be good for some games, and each console has its own overlay that might work better.  Another side note about the touchscreen overlay: Each overlay has portrait and landscape modes but RetroArch will not auto switch between them (which is dumb). There is a rotate button that will do this manually on each overlay.  The touchscreen also has a button to go into the app UI to change settings or whatever while you're playing. I expect this is mapped to some button on your controller.  PlayStation DualShock mode  Oddly enough there's no touchscreen overlay control for the Analog button on the DualShock controller. You have to go into the Core Options using the RetroArch UI to switch it. I tested using PCSXR but I expect other PSX cores have this option too.  Auto-detect Core From Content  This doesn't always work for me, especially for content without predictable file extensions like DOSbox and ScummVM. Plus for content with multiple compatible cores you can't pick which one to use. I usually just select the core first manually."

I grabbed the high-res pack from here (second link) and here (first link).    For my emulator itself, I have Dolphin installed at H:\Games\Emulation\Nintendo\Wii\Emulators\Dolphin\ (it's version 4.0), btw. Within this folder, I created a User\Load\Textures set of folders and, in Textures, I have a folder named RMGE01 and another named SB4E01. Within each of these is a bunch of folders with assets. Here's a screenshot.  Also, here is my Dolphin configuration as well.  Now, I went to Documents and see that there's also a folder there named Dolphin Emulator, and it already had the folder structure for User\Load\Textures inside it (plus a bunch of other folders), so I copied the two high-res folders from the previous directory and pasted them into this location as well.    I had tried to test two different games I own to see if it was just that one wasn't working versus the whole thing not working as a whole. It appears to be the latter, and I can't figure out why. I should also mention that, in case it matters, my actual game folders are named to the same folder name as the high-res textures, just to be safe (RMGE01 and SB4E01).    None of this works. When I load either game with Load Custom Textures unchecked vs checked, it looks the same. Really, it looks the same as before I even had grabbed the high res packs. It's immediately noticeable when the Wii strap warning is fuzzy compared to the high res versions provided in each pack, and I see it when the game loads and the UI isn't sharp, and so on.

emulation,3ctwk1,Kafke,16,Sat Jul 11 10:04:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I am at work, so let me give this a shot:  Step 1: Downloading the emulator  This is the easy part, go to https://dolphin-emu.org/ download the latest version of the Dolphin emulator software then Install the .exe file from where you saved it on your computer.  Step 2: Setup  Start dolphin.exe from the install directory, you will be greeted by a screen with a row of icons; such as config, graphics, DSP, open rom and so on and so forth. If you have any problems in any games, look up the game on the game wiki found here: https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Main_Page   It usually just needs a tweak of some sort, but for the most part stock config should work fine for the surface pro 3... Albeit with an i3 you may not be able to run games very fast. If you really have problems, look up on youtube ""best dolphin config"" and sort by newest, you can usually find a nice walkthrough on how to inprove perfomance.  Step 3: Getting games  The most legal way to do this is ripping your own games, and getting a clean .ISO image (or commonly reffered to as ROMS). But there are certain PARADISES on the internet that are pretty COOL to get ROMS. Not just COOL but DOPE as a HUSTLER. The ZONES to get them are all over the internet YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW WHERE TO LOOK...  Once you obtain an .ISO of your favorite game, click the ""open"" button and play  Step 4 (OPTIONAL): Connecting a usb xbox 360 controller  Since you are on a windows this should be pretty simple! Windows will automatically detect and install the drivers for the controller. Give the computer about a minute to do this. After, go into dolphin again and choose the ""GCpad"" on the top bar of icons. once in, on the drop down menu on the top left and choose the XBOX360controller option (something like that, can't remember off the top of my head). You will then do a process called ""mapping"" the controller, essentially just press the button that you want to ""map"" like the ""a"" button and then press the corresponding button you would like as ""a"" on the controller. Same goes for joysticks, click something like ""y+"" which would be y axis up and then move the desired joystick up to map that direction.  Let me know if you have any questions, I can try to help."

So I can't tell you anything specifically for it.  But I can give you a kind of overview of what the fuck this emulation thing is.  So, first of all, a videogame system is a computer.  It's got some hardware that runs programs.  Those programs are usually on read-only media like CDs (though they can be in cartridges too, but they're still read-only) and are called ROMs.  Trouble is, while the game system knows how to run these ROMs, your computer does not.  The ROMs were built specifically to run on that system.  So you need to emulate that system somehow -- that would be a program on your computer that reacts the same way to the instructions in the ROM as the system itself would.  That would be an emulator.  Now, there might be some software on the system that's built-in that handles stuff like loading games, etc.  It's basically the OS, but it's at a more basic level.  This piece of software is called a BIOS.  Some systems have one, some don't.  You're going to need an emulator to run your game, the actual game ROM to play, and maybe a BIOS.  And then you'll probably need some sort of controller.  A lot of emulators support keyboard controls, but some games really work better with the original controller for the system!  Hopefully you can find a decent substitute.  Now, game systems are complicated beasts and emulating them is hard.  Especially because we don't have access to how they were coded or built.  So for more advanced systems, there are all sorts of options or plugins that may make your game work better, or even at all.  Sometimes effects depend on something you don't have.  Games won't necessarily run perfectly.  This sucks.  But it's what you have to deal with if you don't want to play the original game on the original system.  So be prepared to do a lot of googling to make your game run correctly.  Hopefully someone has already solved your problem before!"

emulation,3cvm7u,tomkatt,2,Sat Jul 11 04:02:22 2015 UTC,"A lot of great points here, but one general comment:  ARM CPUs (What android generally runs on) clock speeds aren't really comparable in performance per clock compared to an x86 based Intel/AMD. Being a RISC processor, many operations (and yes, I am aware they have come a long way) take more clocks to perform than a CISC based processor such as an x86. This is a general simplification, as a CISC processors extended operations almost always take >1 clock to perform, but are generally better equipped for general useage/multitasking by the same token. RISC architectures just don't perform as well with an OS with many background services and IO running in the background at all times. A great example: Microsoft Surface RT vs. one of the low-end Surface Pros.  RISC vs. CISC is a very complex topic and I'd say I still only have a beginner's knowledge, but generally speaking ARM processors, even if they were theoretically clocked higher than an x86, still will not perform as well as an x86.  Even with ARMs rapid evolution in terms of performance, there is still a huge gap compared to an Intel or AMD chip, and I don't see that gap closing anytime soon.  An answer to OP's question though: It will be a few more years. Thankfully (and obviously) the hardware of older systems remain the same, while the mobile processor world is always growing by leaps and bounds. Qualcomm and Samsung are putting out some mean chips, and with code optimizations to use multicore/multithreaded capable systems in better ways, we'll have our Wind Wakers in our pockets soon enough.  EDIT: One more quick note on ARM performance and recent changes: Obviously there is the big.LITTLE advances to account for to lift to overall burden of background tasks to the smaller cores and leaves the higher performance cores open to more user-based application performance, but they still do not perform nearly as well as an x86 in these tasks."
emulation,3cvm7u,UnsureSherlock,3,Sat Jul 11 06:37:01 2015 UTC,"RISC vs. CISC is a very complex topic and I'd say I still only have a beginner's knowledge, but generally speaking ARM processors, even if they were theoretically clocked higher than an x86, still will not perform as well as an x86.   Technically speaking RISC is more efficient in the grand scheme and is oriented toward piplining, becaue RISC is oriented toward each instruction completing in a single clock cycle. RISC actually scales up well with clock speed because the faster CPU cycle scales linearly to my understanding. That said, it's heavily dependent on software. When optimized for RISC instruction sets, applications tend to be faster (e.g. - Photoshop and similar CPU intensive programs ran better on the old 800MHz RISC-based Macs than on PCs that were over 1GHz back in the day).  I'll be honest, I don't have a lot of experience here either, but it's my understanding that this is why a lot of early consoles were RISC based. Here's a good write up on it."

It was pathetic   Good points. It's probably why the architecture's worked well for Android and iOS, but not so much for desktop. The phones/tablets are designed to do one, maybe two tasks at a time besides background processing, while storing all the rest in RAM until needed.  Edit - I looked up Mill computing/CPU, that sounds fascinating, but the limited stack looks like it might come with issues. Mainly it's the spill and fill idea that bothers me. I assume it can be worked around, but if done poorly could lead to buffer overflows and crashes, or other unknown, unexpected states.  Of course, that's interesting in its own right for specific architectures (some of the neatest stuff on the older consoles like NES and SNES came from abusing exploits on the hardware stack), but might come with problems for general computing. It's an interesting concept though, I just don't know how realistic it is, and if it will actually realize the whole ""10x faster than OoO Superscalar"" thing.   I thought OoOE superscalar is how we've made CISC much more efficient with multi-threaded processing. It's currently the only thing that's maintained Moore's law, IMO. Without it we'd still be stuck at the heat cap with P4/Pentium D style chipsets. Granted, it's also increased complexity, so maybe there will be better solutions one day.

PS1/PSP or lower   Nah man, all the way through Dreamcast, even with budget chipsets like the Tegra 4 (which you can get for around $90 now in tablet format).  There's just a large increase in complexity scale when we move up to the PS2. We'll likely see Gamecube emulation at full speed in the near future (Shield console can already almost do that). It's just a long time coming before we get Wii and PS2 I think."
emulation,3cvei9,CloudRunnerRed,3,Sat Jul 11 02:28:05 2015 UTC,Build your own PC! You'll get exactly what you need at a decent price.  Something like this could easily do what you're wanting. Add your WiFi/BT and you're set.
emulation,3cvei9,MarblesAreDelicious,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:00:43 2015 UTC,"I would definitely second making your own build. I built my own mini-PC dedicated to emulation for under $300 (Gigabyte Brix, 1037U, 4GB RAM + 64GB SSD). It takes a bit more effort, but you can get exactly what you want from the machine."
emulation,3cvei9,Shonumi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:53:15 2015 UTC,"That build is $561 CAD without an OS (Windows in Canada adds another $100) I would need to add wifi and blue tooth, runs at 200W. That cost puts it close to the same amount as some of the higher end pre-builds on my list that are smaller and use far less power.  I'm not against building my own but every mini PC I have priced out ends up costing slightly more, takes up more space and uses more power."
emulation,3cvei9,Timzor,2,Sat Jul 11 14:15:22 2015 UTC,"Can I reccomend an android device? Nvidia Shield TV has emulators, Kodi, Netflix and streams games from your gaming PC quite well. $199-299"
emulation,3cvei9,Timzor,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:52:26 2015 UTC,I don't have much experience with android. Can it emulate higher then PSX?
emulation,3cvei9,Timzor,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:06:54 2015 UTC,"It can do Wii and GameCube, not sure about PS2."
emulation,3ct2sd,Nikitoo,9,Fri Jul 10 15:30:08 2015 UTC,"When confronted with the question of ""Will X run on windows 10?"" Ask yourself, did it run on windows 7,8, or 8.1? If yes, it will almost certainly run on windows 10 just as efficiently if not faster. If it doesn't run as fast, that means that you might have some outdated drivers or other issue."
emulation,3ct2sd,CrashOverrideCS,5,Sat Jul 11 01:59:02 2015 UTC,"Everything I used works fine. Retroarch, dolphin, pcsx2."
emulation,3ct2sd,TheShinyQuaza,2,Fri Jul 10 19:13:29 2015 UTC,Agreed to that - everything (including frontends) have been working flawlessly on Windows 10.
emulation,3ct2sd,thealchemistbr,2,Sat Jul 11 02:09:15 2015 UTC,Reshaders for Dolphin don't seem to work on Windows 10 for me. Keeps crashing whereas it worked perfectly in Windows 8.1. Could just be me tho..

emulation,3ct2sd,GrammerPants,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:31:11 2015 UTC,the preview versions are out and free to use. its been out for months. the final version is july 29th.
emulation,3ct2sd,pcpBandit,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:51:57 2015 UTC,"Doubt it. I've played a few emulators on my laptop (which seems buggy as hell on windows 10 preview) and whatever my system can handle seems to handle no problem. So far I've tried everything on up to psp though. So no GameCube, ps2, etc yet, so those may be more important. From what I've read though, direct x12 should improve performance overall for graphics in games. Even some older windows games that didn't work in windows 8 properly, work properly in windows 10. Hopefully it will bode well for emulators as well."
emulation,3ct2sd,unvaluablespace,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:14:03 2015 UTC,"direct x12 should improve performance overall for graphics in games.   Another myth that gets passed around too often. It can theoretically improve performance if the application is already well threaded and is being bottlenecked by the API overhead or draw calls (which is rare for games and almost unheard of in emulators).  Sure, it kicks ass in benchmarks but every version of DX has crushed the previous version in benchmarks and nobody can notice the difference in actual games. Vulkan has an even lower overhead than DX12 (and works on a much wider range of software and hardware) - that's the graphics API to watch out for.  The only emulator where you might see gains with D3D12 is Dolphin. But they're already (thankfully) balls deep in OGL and we're all enjoying the benefits of that."
emulation,3ct2sd,Rossco1337,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:15:44 2015 UTC,I haven't had any issues with any emulator with Windows 10 stuff seems to work better especially kega fusion. I think they improved direct draw in dx12 for older games and such.
emulation,3crqiu,djlewt,3,Fri Jul 10 06:16:37 2015 UTC,Don't have an AMD card but from what I hear Xenia now works for users with the new drivers (assuming they have a CPU that supports at least AVX)
emulation,3crqiu,Razzile,2,Fri Jul 10 10:53:52 2015 UTC,"You mean, 15.7 drivers OP?  15.2, as the name suggests is a February driver which was a Win 10 development driver."

Super meat boy went in game but was not playable. All the videos show it being playable. I tried about 15 games, some booted but very few went in-game and none were close to playable. the only one that played fine was puzzle bobble.  i5-4670k and a r9 270 card. i also tried on my other pc i5-3570k and radeon 7950 and i didnt notice a difference"
