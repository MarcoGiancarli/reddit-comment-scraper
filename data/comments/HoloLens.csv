This means what when shown through a video camera, the technology is able to fill most of the FOV of the camera.  You cannot accurately demo an AR device with a regular video camera. You could use a really wide fish-eye lens, but then you would end up with something that would look like the YouTube videos that are prerendered for VR. They would be warped and look like crap.    The huge difference between AR and VR is that in AR, the area outside the FOV is filled with reality, while in VR it is just dark.   FOV is still important in AR, but not nearly as important as it is in VR. The comments I have seen from people that have had hands-on-time with the Hololens have convinced me that current FOV will effect what developers choose to do with the device, but does not ruin the viability of the device as a product."

For example, one of the situations that Microsoft has demonstrated is the use of HoloLens in a partially finished building, enabling builders, architects, and clients to discuss changes while literally standing in the partially finished building  Even with field-of-view limitations, this application isn't something that can be readily performed any other way; 3D renders lack the immediacy that a site visit provides, and physical models lack the easy malleability that virtual worlds offer  HoloLens doesn't have to be the perfect AR implementation to offer practical value over these alternatives  No, it's not going to offer a perfectly immersive 3D world  But it is going to offer substantially richer interaction than a mere computer screen could ever hope to.  A $500 gaming peripheral is expected to deliver the moon on a stick; $500 is a lot of money to spend on a gaming device  You can buy an entire console for less than that, so it sets expectations extremely high: it should offer nothing short of a Scott Pilgrim vs the World style experience  A $1,500 business productivity device is, for that very different market, relatively inexpensive  While even this audience will expect HoloLens' visuals to impress—which they will—the main thing that HoloLens will be expected to do is save time, improve collaboration, and make money"

The watches look cool, and will most certainly be ubiquitous in the future, but tethering them to our phones is just too clunky and un-futuristic.  There's just no wow factor to that.  Contrast that to the reactions when it was announced that Hololens was as sleek as it is now.  No wires going to your 15 pound backpack CPU, no giant processor on the back of it.  Just the visor and you're good.  Now, this has clearly limited the FoV, but if that's just a processor issue, then Moore's Law will take care of it eventually."

Voila, a black raven on blue background appears on your white wall.  Now let's say you want to have a black raven ""hologram"" floating in front of your white wall. The HoloLens would have to make the part where the raven is darker than the wall actually is, and there is no such thing as negative light. For HoloLens, showing something black is the same as showing something that's 100% transparent, i.e., invisible.  Now say the HoloLens' tinted visor makes everything darker. Your wall is now grey, but you still can't make a raven-shaped part of it blacker.  You could in theory project nothing where the raven is, and project white onto the screen in the correct places to cover the rest of your wall to bring the background brightness back up. Now you would have a grey raven in front of a white wall. The problem is, HoloLens doesn't have the sensors or tracking/display latency to do this."

HoloLens,3dcl6q,Cueball61,-4,Wed Jul 15 21:06:50 2015 UTC,"It is a competitor, even if they are going after different userbases.  Just like the Xbox One is a competitor to PS4, despite one system focusing on games like Halo, and the other focusing on games like Watch_Dogs.  The primary uses of both the Oculus and the HoloLens will be game playing and watching movies... some of them will involve people wearing clothes."
HoloLens,3dcl6q,kinyutaka,8,Wed Jul 15 13:02:09 2015 UTC,"Other than being mounted on the head....they really have very little in common.      To use your example -->  the Xbox and PS share 95% of content and all exclusive content is only exclusive because one of the two competitors paid for it or built it themselves (fwiw: the Xbox has both Halo and Watchdogs.....the former being exclusive only because it's an in-house property).    AR and VR, on the other hand, will have almost completely different content.     You might have the same IP, but the games will be unique to take advantage of each platform.    VR will move 3D games into a new, more immersive, medium, and AR will redefine what's possible in gaming while bringing the games into your world.    The primary use of Oculus will be playing games.    It's hard to say what the primary use of HoloLens/AR will be....gaming will play a part, but that's just the tip of an iceberg.   Augmented reality can and, very likely, will play a part in everything we do.    I guarantee it will eventually play a part in the business enterprise and in education and in many day-to-day situations."
HoloLens,3dcl6q,Tojuro,-4,Wed Jul 15 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"I guarantee you that because the Oculus will be operating using a PC, and the HoloLens is a PC, they will share a not insignificant amount of uses and content.  And I'll be willing to bet that within a year there will be an Oculus-mounted camera attachment that allows for AR gaming/programs, modded by fans, if not made by the company."
HoloLens,3dcl6q,kinyutaka,4,Wed Jul 15 15:04:57 2015 UTC,Applications for VR and AR will be nothing alike. AR is all about interacting with the real world while VR is all about creating a new one. Also the power of the PC powering Oculus will be significantly more than the processing power of Hololens. Trying to run the same app on both would be like trying to run a next gen console game on the Wii.
HoloLens,3dcl6q,SplitReality,-4,Wed Jul 15 16:35:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, the HoloLens will be able to interact with a Laptop or Desktop PC to act as a display, in that situation, the on board processors would work with the PC processors and make a more powerful unit."
HoloLens,3dcl6q,kinyutaka,2,Wed Jul 15 16:53:58 2015 UTC,You got a source for that because I've never heard of that capability although I have speculated in the past that Microsoft would offer a lower cost version that did that. Of course if you are connected to your computer with a cable you reduce one of the key features of AR which is interacting with the environment since you'd be tethered to one spot.
HoloLens,3dcl6q,SplitReality,-1,Wed Jul 15 21:43:18 2015 UTC,"What's with the downvotes? Is this not true? From the demos, it clearly looks as though the Hololens will be able to pair with a computer in some way, and it would be foolish of Microsoft not to take advantage of the potential leap in processing power that that could provide."
HoloLens,3dcl6q,km89,0,Wed Jul 15 21:20:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I remember hearing about that capability, but I am having trouble finding the specific article now.  But it isn't like I'm saying something controversial, and we know at the very least that Windows 10 devices will stream to each other."
HoloLens,3dcl6q,kinyutaka,2,Thu Jul 16 00:53:45 2015 UTC,"You'd need depth sensors, a 180 degree camera that doesn't distort the real world, and the ability to project images properly, in real time.     The software to model the real world and project images is not lightweight stuff.    And, it's that link to a PC which ultimately cripples current VR tech for anything beyond seated/low-mobility uses.    Oculus isn't a self contained unit, and that's a big leap to make from where it is now.  Nobody is going to walk around with a powerhouse GPU-backed laptop on their back.....pushing the cost to $2000+.      Is this feasible?   Maybe, but then you have to ask ""why?"".    This type of thing might happen if there wasn't viable AR units in the works, and it's very likely HoloLens will launch before Vive and Oculus CV1.    I have two Oculus units and am a fan of the technology, but the limits are quite clear.    It's going to be good for niche gaming, but nothing beyond that point."
HoloLens,3dcl6q,Tojuro,-3,Wed Jul 15 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that Oculus will be quite inferior in the field of Augmented Reality, but the fact remains that the companies will be competing with each other."

People may want both but only pick one due to costs, but I don't believe their competition will be deeper that. Most uses require one device or the other and the purchases will be based upon the use case the consumer needs most."
HoloLens,3dcl6q,openzeus,0,Wed Jul 15 19:48:38 2015 UTC,"Most users don't require either. Let's get that straight.  I want one so I can effectively slap a big screen TV on the wall without the problems associated with buying and installing a big screen TV.  And both systems can do big screen equivalents. The difference being that with HoloLens, I can see when my roommate walks into the room.  HoloLens will be able to do VR with a single, simple upgrade... a black visor to blot out surroundings. Oculus would require some doing to get AR, but it isn't impossible.  I'm not saying that these are identical products. But one is this kind of toaster and the other is this kind of toaster  Both will make toast (act as a way of interfacing directly with a computer), but they will do it differently. And you'll probably only buy one of them."

HoloLens,3d9b3r,Shooob,6,Tue Jul 14 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"MJF: I have a HoloLens question. I've heard that when you first saw HoloLens -- back when it was Project Fortaleza -- you said we need to expand this beyond just gaming. Where do you think the initial demand for HoloLens is going to be? Is it going to be more in gaming, or is it going to be more in business and research?   NADELLA: For sure in the first version, it's going to be more about developers and enterprise scenarios  I did buy Minecraft to create a new genre of gaming for mixed reality. We bought Minecraft for many reasons: because it's the number one PC app; it's the number one console app; it's the number one paid mobile app on iOS and Android. I wanted a hit game even for the new medium of mixed reality. And we will have that. Gaming will always be a scenario and there will be other entertainment broadly. But, with the V.1 of HoloLens, I want us to push a lot more of the enterprise usage.  In general Microsoft's approach will be always this dual-use focus, or this multi-focus. What we can uniquely do is bridge consumer to enterprise. That's in our DNA. That's why it's even in our mission statement of empowering people and organizations. I want every technology of ours to seek that out. In the HoloLens case, when I look at the interest, it's amazing how many are in hospitals, healthcare, retail. That's where I'm seeing the interest and we'll definitely go after it."
HoloLens,3d9b3r,km89,2,Tue Jul 14 14:44:01 2015 UTC,"For sure in the first version, it's going to be more about developers and enterprise scenarios   This makes me feel a bit more confident in the Hololens--rather than misunderstanding their market, as I thought they were, they're just focusing on a different market. The minecraft demo made me think that they were focused on average-joe consumers."
HoloLens,3d9b3r,SplitReality,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"Always knew this was the case. HoloLens is going to be way too expensive, and has way too few applications for games. The FOV is too low and it doesn't have a controller scheme responsive or versatile enough for complex game interactions. Mostly what you'll get gaming wise will be 3D table top strategy/puzzle where the interaction is a minor part of the gameplay."
HoloLens,3d9b3r,re_kinect,2,Tue Jul 14 19:38:42 2015 UTC,What controller scheme is better than a controller lol? They already talked about a demo of a game (Project XRay) using a controller with hololens.  So that erases that to complex crap.  Too few applications for games? That depends on how you look at things.  To me all we have to do is look at illumiroom.  Minecraft demo does this where it extends beyond the screen.  Some people minds are so closed that they cant think.  I mean lets keep it honest  VR only has one application.  Its just you with the tv pressed against your face with headtracking.  Thats it.  It does nothing more than that.  So in reality AR will always have  more things that it can do just by the nature of it.
HoloLens,3d9b3r,SplitReality,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:51:00 2015 UTC,"What controller scheme is better than a controller lol?    For VR/AR that would be hand tracking controllers like Valve's Lighthouse or Sony's Move controller. When working with a virtual display it is natural to reach out and touch things. Plus AR is particularly bad for regular controllers because you can still see the real world which the device can't alter. So you can't use a controller for first person view flying or driving which is an acceptable input and game type for VR.  I'm not sure what you mean by Illumiroom apps. If you are thinking about augmenting games played on the TV that won't work due to the small FOV. When looking at the TV screen the entire visible display area of HoloLens would be inside its view area so would have empty so as to not block your view. There would be no peripheral view which is the whole point of Illumiroom.  Minecraft was nothing like Illumiroom. It was just like the table top games that I said would be the main game type for Hololens. I can also guarantee you that Hololens will have a Star Wars Battle Chess type tabletop game too.  Think about this for a second. If Hololens was a good platform for games then why is Microsoft only targeting enterprise vertical markets with it?  You are quite a bit confused about what VR games can do. It's significantly more than a TV pressed against your face. It gives you a sense of immersion that no regular game can touch. To give you a taste of what I'm talking about, take a look at this thread discussing the potential problem that horror games in VR might be too scary.  http://m.neogaf.com/showthread.php?t=1078145  For a broader sense of what games are possible look at this thread discussing the games/demos already announced for Project Morpheus.  http://m.neogaf.com/showthread.php?t=1044658"
HoloLens,3d9b3r,re_kinect,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:35:54 2015 UTC,"Its exactly a TV pressed against your face.  If you put on a roller coaster video on you tube and put your face close to the monitor BAM immersion.   VR is indeed simplistic.   Nothing to think about.  They never said ONLY targeting enterprise, they said first.  The answer to that is quite obvious.  It's easier to just use the universal apps than building games from the ground up for it.  I mean come theres no one knocking at the door to do games for hololens.  All they did was look at Kinect sales.  If it was ONLY for enterprise they wouldnt waste time with Minecraft on it would they?  They are thinking big.  At a good price point Minecraft could sale 50 million hololens easy.  And thats how theyll create the market for hololens games.   Back to the handtracking part.  Wakeup man if you are talking games on the xbox one theres this little thing called kinect."
HoloLens,3d9b3r,SplitReality,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:31:34 2015 UTC,"Wow there is so much wrong with that reply that I am starting to think you are being sarcastic.  As for immersion you didn't answer any of my points so they still stand and I have nothing else to say about that.  As for MS not targeting games...what...I mean what in the world are you going on about. You just repeat that Microsoft is not targeting games. Dream up some low price point that isn't going to happen. And then Step 3...Profit.   As for hand controls and using Kinect, Kinect has too much lag and imprecision which btw is why it failed. Plus if they used Kinect then you would always have to be facing your TV since if you turned the camera would lose sight of your hands and arms. That defeats the whole purpose of Hololens being untethered. It'd also make for a crappy AR experience since you'd always be looking at your TV."
HoloLens,3d9b3r,NotDaPunk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:05:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sure next year there will be many OEMs with Surface Hub like devices. We will do HoloLens, and then, since the holographic computing platform is right there in Windows, there will be people who will build holographic computers beyond HoloLens. So I want all of that to happen.   The more hardware companies making holographic devices, the sooner FOV becomes an issue of the past, and the sooner problems we haven't even thought of would become an issue of the past I think."
HoloLens,3d9b3r,SplitReality,0,Tue Jul 14 21:52:39 2015 UTC,"I am a very optimistic person when it comes to technology advancements but the FOV problem will be tougher to solve than people think. In my admittedly limited understanding of the issue, there needs to be a fundamental breakthrough in order to increase the FOV. This isn't a simple matter of there not being enough processing power or battery life to drive a larger view.  The problem as I understand it has to do with the fact that in order to avoid having a big clunky projector sitting right in front of your eyes, the image is produced on the side and then projected into the glasses. Then by some means that projected image needs to be redirected in order to hit your eyes. There are physical limits, like the refraction index of the lens material, to how much that light can be bent which is why the FOV is so small.  I've probably butchered that explaination. Here is the article I read that discusses the many different AR technologies where I learned about why AR has such small FOV.  http://optinvent.com/HUD-HMD-benchmark"
HoloLens,3d9b3r,NotDaPunk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:31:47 2015 UTC,"It mainly comes down to resource allocation I think. Given enough motivation, like total war, humans invented nuclear weapons, which probably would have taken a lot longer in a period of relative peace. This isn't to say we should start a world war just to get great FOV, but human ingenuity is always directed at whatever has the most attention. Who knows, in a more peaceful version of the 20th century, we might have gotten cold fusion instead of nukes."
HoloLens,3d9b3r,SplitReality,0,Tue Jul 14 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"Like I said I am generally very optimistic about tech. The thing I wanted to point out is that an AR's small FOV seems to be an intractable problem over a wide range of display methods.  This is not like an optimization pass for a video game where if you throw more resources at it you will see results.   The underlying tech has to change. I had to bring this up many times on this subreddit to people who just assumed that the FOV would get better for the consumer version. Now I'm doing it to people who expect an improvement in the next version. Maybe the next HoloLens or the one after that will have a larger FOV, but if it does it will be because for all intents and purposes, it will be an entirely different product."
HoloLens,3d9b3r,SimpleWireFree,2,Wed Jul 15 02:34:51 2015 UTC,"I do think that the FOV will get better using other technologies.  1.0 has a limited FOV and is for Enterprise customers 2.0 has a much better FOV and is for consumers  1.0 will be out sometime this year and 2.0 will be out sometime next year.  They are working on the FOV issue as we speak.  They have hired Casey Hudson to assist in making future video game titles for the Hololens.  Realistically using existing engines you would have almost two years of development.  Next years windows 10 update is codenamed ""Redstone"" which comes from minecraft and they showed their Hololens Minecraft demo this past E3.  So, the consumer version is going to be due out end of 2016 (at the very least or 2017 at the very most) and I think it's going to be 2016.  So, they are using the limited FOV version as a test bed and also to get something out now for Enterprise customers and then later on to Consumer customers.  We know that they are working on new technologies for the FOV, we know this as a fact.  They have a guy working on it, but it's going to be awhile and it uses different technologies.   So, right now they show these amazing demos of what they are working on and keep working with third party VR to keep in the news and to get them on board.  I believe that if they can get the FOV as high as the other VR devices, this device can double as an AR and VR in the same device.   They can do fovated rendering on the FOV so that low resolution is on the sides of your vision (peripheral vision) and high in front.  So that they don't have to render as much."

Just think of this as a prosumer device similar to the Surface pro brand. I bet HoloLens V1 will cost $800.   He's 100% right about going enterprise first, you need to showcase a new platform in an impactful way, after that's met entertainment plus developers will come in the end. Sure I can watch Netflix on my holographic tv but I'm not going to be watching Netflix forever."

At Microsoft's Worldwide Partner's Conference, the company demonstrated how the HoloLens would integrate with Autodesk's Maya 3D animation software — a popular graphic art and design program.  You'll be able to work on a project in Maya on your desktop computer with a traditional mouse and keyboard while projecting a realistic 3-D rendering of the model, as Microsoft demonstrated. This could make it easier for coworkers to see what you're working on without having to peek over your shoulder. The changes you make also show up on the 3-D model as you're working.  Microsoft You can also project 3-D models onto a real-world objects to see how your project will look in real life. In the example below, a model of a motorcycle is being projected over an actual motorcycle so that you can change its color.  Microsoft But perhaps the most interesting use case shown in the demo was how the HoloLens lets you collaborate with coworkers around the world. If someone leaves a comment on your project, the HoloLens can pull it up and show it on the exact section of the design your coworker was referring to in the comment.   The HoloLens knows where you're looking and how close you are to the object, too, so when it shows you comments it knows exactly how large the text should be and where it should be placed.   Microsoft The HoloLens can then read the comments out loud and demonstrate the changes. So, if the comment was referring to certain changes that should be made to the mirror, the HoloLens would show that. It looks really futuristic in the demo.  Microsoft  ""Every time I see it, it just gets even more exciting,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said after the demo during the keynote. ""For the very first time, we're going to have a computer that's going to allow us to mix the digital and the real.""  Microsoft has yet to announce when the HoloLens will be released or how much it will cost, but the company has said in the past that it will launch during Windows 10's lifetime. A report from The New York Times said it will cost more than an Xbox gaming console."

HoloLens,3d82a5,Genesis_Prime,2,Tue Jul 14 06:13:36 2015 UTC,"Seems it isn't filming through the headset at all (I think we already knew that that from the field of view in the stage demos), but is instead likely using them just for the tracking hardware and possibly rendering hardware.  I think it must be compositing the renderings onto the video feed, and this explains some of the misrepresentation of the overlayed projections as being almost fully opaque even under bright stage lighting. Very Milo."
HoloLens,3d82a5,muchcharles,2,Tue Jul 14 08:00:12 2015 UTC,"Great! This should put the rumors that the on-stage camera films through a real HoloLens device, and therefore accurately shows the device's capability, to rest once and for all. The camera uses the HoloLens' sensor pack for 6-DOF tracking, and composites the appropriately-rendered virtual objects into the Red camera's video feed. That's why it has a larger field of view, and can create opaque or black ""holograms."""

HoloLens,3d571n,norir82,3,Mon Jul 13 17:10:58 2015 UTC,Did you notice there was actually a reflection of some kind in the virtual mirror that moved as the camera did?
HoloLens,3d571n,gnieboer,2,Mon Jul 13 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"That'd probably be the same environment map that's used for the reflections on the paint.  More of a shiny effect than a true mirror.  If the texture matches closely to the actual environment its in then it generally will look pretty good, provided you don't inspect it too closely anyways."

HoloLens,3d6w50,pittsburghjoe,8,Tue Jul 14 00:07:49 2015 UTC,Even Hololens FOV is not that great. But I think judging it from 3rd-person's point of view is somewhat unfair and misleading. (misleading as much as MS show the immersive holographic filled in the entire room)
HoloLens,3d6w50,khun_panya,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:08:30 2015 UTC,"Looks somewhat misleading for near-stuff (because that is at the small end of the view frustum pyramid, so from from third person looks absolutely tiny, from first person it wouldn't be quite so stand-out). At the end when he is in the immersive demo and looks at stuff far away I think you can get a better picture of how it really is.  However, even then, still seems pretty tiny."
HoloLens,3d6w50,muchcharles,8,Tue Jul 14 08:20:03 2015 UTC,"This is even more unrealistic than the full camera view you saw at Build & E3.     This third person perspective doesn't take into account that our brain mostly processes just what we are staring at.       For example -- you are looking at a monitor/screen right now, and only focusing on a small part of it....words or paragraphs.   The fact that this page of Reddit comments likely extends below the view-able area on screen (whether it's words or pictures you see) does not really matter.  It doesn't diminish the value of the content, since you can only consume portions at a time.     A camera from 20 feet back from the place you are sitting that's showing the scope of what your brain is actually processing would be a small fraction of the screen in front of you.    In the video you see a shot of a globe from the perspective of someone 20-30 feet away, but the figure using augmented reality is just a few feet away and would only really be processing a sliver in front of their face, even with 180 degree FOV.    They'd have to step back just as far as the camera to take in that whole thing even, with that 180 degree FOV.        A wide FOV is definitely a nice-to-have thing, but it's not essential like it is with VR, where you need to fool the mind.   I think this whole FOV discussion is overblown."
HoloLens,3d6w50,Tojuro,2,Tue Jul 14 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"Perfectly said.  Here's why the FOV doesn't bother me that much:  I sit 12 feet away from a 55 inch diagonal television.  I have never complained about the size of my television from that distance.  Therefore, I have never complained about the FOV I have from my couch to my television.  Interesting enough, if the Hololens really does have a 30 x 17.5 degree FOV, I could see an entire 90 inch diagonal television from that distance using the Hololens.  At 12 feet away from a hologram(s), I get a 90 inch, 16 by 9 aspect ratio window to view my hologram(s) in.  I could have one big 90 inch diagonal video at 12 feet away, or nine 30 inch diagonal videos at 12 feet away.  From 12 feet away, I could see an entire 43 inch diameter globe of the earth (limited by the 17.5 degree vertical FOV of the Hololens)  From 10 feet away from the center, I could see an entire 72 inch diagonal holographic soccer field on my floor.  (Actually bigger, because your vision is not perpendicular to the face of that soccer field when your viewing it, but one can get the idea.  Stand 10 feet away from the center of an area rug to get an idea.)  I mention all of these things because I think people are focusing on the wrong thing.  Instead of thinking of all of the possibilities, people are just thinking about the FOV."
HoloLens,3d6w50,DontFearTheFuture,2,Wed Jul 15 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"You forget that even though we don't focus on it, we know its there. I'm looking at my monitor, but the wall behind it is beige. I see my water bottle although blurry, out of focus, and my brain is trying to render what it looks like even without focus. But it is there!! The holograms will not even be there... There is a big difference with what you are trying to equate it to."
HoloLens,3d6w50,ChronoChris,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:24:41 2015 UTC,"I think this is the big thing. It's not that, outside the main area, everything will be less detailed. It's that it's cut off entirely.   I think it's more akin to trying to walk through a dark room with a small flashlight than watching TV or reading Reddit. Yes, you can see what's right in front of you, but you can't see anything else at all.   But to use /u/Tojuro's example of a Reddit comment, it'd be like reading this comment but not being able to see its parent comment. If you wanted to see the parent comment, you'd have to go searching for it. You know roughly that it's probably above this one, but there's a clear difference between knowing roughly where something is and being able to just snap your eyes to it immediately."
HoloLens,3d6w50,km89,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:56:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you are saying about holograms appearing and disappearing out of no-where.  For some people and some conditions, that is a problem.  For others, not so much.  Having holograms popping in and out of existence can cause an Immersion issue.  While only a bigger FOV can help find your holograms easier, there is a possible way to increase Immersion.  That's why I wrote a post here on Reddit entitled, ""My argument to have a removable, external “Blinder” for the Hololens.""  In my argument, I suggest having a optional ""Blinder"" that could be added the exterior of the Hololens to make sure that the FOV of your real world matches the FOV of the Hololens.  Sure, your ""Natural"" vision would be similar to wearing a welders helmet with the visor open, but in exchange your real world and holographic world will match.  Essentially, it would be like wearing an Oculus Rift with an FOV of 30 x 17.5, but such that you have the options of having both Mixed Reality in the FOV or Virtual Reality (when a hologram takes up the entire view) in the FOV.  Either way, it would be an optional, easily removable and reusable device.  It'll give customers choice on how they want to experience the holograms.  Some may not mind having holograms popping in and out of existence, while other might.  Personally, I rather have the Blinder and feel more Immersed with a smaller FOV than having holograms popping in and out of existence with a natural FOV.  PS:  As far as locating holograms:  When one places a Hologram, it will be right where they left it.  Even so, Microsoft is already experimenting with adding little tiny markers to help locate holograms when they are out of view.  The experiment was seen in a demo called ""Project X-ray""."

HoloLens,3d6w50,DontFearTheFuture,2,Wed Jul 15 14:08:42 2015 UTC,"I see your point, though I disagree. Yes, the technology is amazing. No question. But yes, the FoV is a problem. Also no question.   To be frank, it would be like bitching that your car is much more difficult to drive in the rain because the wipers only clear half the windshield for you to look through."
HoloLens,3d6w50,km89,3,Wed Jul 15 16:58:11 2015 UTC,"Yup. This is the best representation I've seen of what it actually looks like from my experience using it at Build 2015. I remember it being more square though.  Don't get me wrong. It's almost completely lag free, and even handles cropping out when real world objects ""obstruct"" the view of distant holograms. I even shook my head back and forth quickly to see how well the holograms would ""stick"" to the real world, and the wiggle was less than 1cm... But the FOV makes it really only useful for the small scale maya type use we saw demoed. They've got to get the FOV up before regular consumers are going to be happy with it for more than the first ""gee-wiz"" week."
HoloLens,3d6w50,BryanTheCrow,4,Tue Jul 14 06:54:16 2015 UTC,"I have been a big proponent of the HoloLens while simultaneously expressing my dissent about the FOV.  Once again, this is a huge issue. The demonstration here clearly showed, as you begin interacting with the objects in 3d space, the closer you get, the worse the FOV problem becomes. Although making the object smaller will display more of the object in field of view this starts to add precision problems, takes away from immersion, and it means that you will never get full view effects.   When he had the example of his body, you couldn't see what his feet were doing.  Edit: I received massive downvotes the last time I said that this product will be useless if they don't fix the fov. But I just wanted to point out how hard it was for him to pick pieces of the triangles off the sphere, or interact with the globe. Unfortunately, it's a mechanical problem with the way the lens has to be built, and not a processing problem. My hope is that the first product they release will be nice and clean to draw people in, but then the next one, even if the glasses part is more robust and protruding, they fix the fov."
HoloLens,3d6w50,ChronoChris,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:53:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that this is a huge issue.  When I first heard about Hololens, I immediately tried to grab every scrap of information I could about it. If it had a release date, I'd be camping out already in preparation for it.  But this... this is quite possibly a deal-breaker. I'd definitely have to experience a demo before I bought the thing now."
HoloLens,3d6w50,km89,6,Tue Jul 14 00:59:29 2015 UTC,"Don't dismiss it without getting a demo first. Aside from the limited FoV, the HoloLens is extremely impressive. And whether you can live with the narrow view or not depends on what you want to do with it.  I picked three typical applications I'd want to do in the video, and the ""game world"" setting just for context. That's definitely not something you'd want to do."
HoloLens,3d6w50,Doc_Ok,2,Tue Jul 14 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"Don't dismiss it without getting a demo first.   I won't. The technology is so impressive that it would have to be really, really bad for me not to get one.  I understand that this isn't a gaming device; I agree with that and understand its limitations, so far as they've been announced or implied.   But between the demos and the video (I'm assuming this is you doing the video?), I definitely question a bit more than I did a few days ago.   That said, I'm still so hyped for this that I'm practically drooling. If I got a demo and it was bad, that could be a deal-breaker--but though I probably came across like ""I'm defaulting to 'not worth it' until proven otherwise,"" I'm really still ""defaulting to 'buy it buy it buy it' unless it's really bad."""

It's such an amazing technology that will just never catch on if it can't be used.   It's a little frustrating to see, honestly. For all their demos, they have the special camera that can do a pretty huge FoV; they need to get that into the Hololens."
HoloLens,3d6w50,Shooob,6,Tue Jul 14 00:52:04 2015 UTC,"Let's assume for a moment that the general public doesn't accept the HoloLens for whatever reason. Just to play devil's advocate. MS has already shown several industry-specific uses that will likely catch on to this technology.   One example is for education. Will college students buy this themselves? Maybe not (let's face it, most of them live on Ramen noodles), but universities will. Go watch the Case Western Reserve University use case video again. They are already considering using it in other departments outside of anatomy. That's a big deal. Universities are likely to adopt a technology like this just like they did with the Kinect, even though it was considered a failed device in the eyes of gamers.   Other examples are the Maya & Trimble (architecture) use cases. Even if the 3D modeling hobbyist doesn't adopt this (though I think many will) there are plenty of large firms who see the possibilities and will buy in (and some already have).  And let's not forget about JPL/NASA who are already using the device and like it so much that they're sending it to ISS.   Microsoft isn't going to trash a device just because you don't like the FoV; there are plenty of people/companies/industries who see the possibilities and the experience that will more than make up the difference."
HoloLens,3d6w50,km89,-1,Tue Jul 14 14:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was exaggerating there.  I love the concept. I think it has the potential to have a greater effect than even the smartphone did. I can see it replacing every screen--TV, monitor, tablet, whatever else--in your house. But if they can't increase the FoV, that's not going to happen. It's going to be limited to industrial/niche use.   It's an absolutely amazing piece of technology, but you can't deny that the FoV is a pretty big flaw."

Even in the mostly scripted demo (where they told me where to stand), I couldn't see the whole building model on the table without moving my head around."
HoloLens,3cyflo,BryanTheCrow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:06:57 2015 UTC,"Because this is the hololens PR machine and these fanboys like to pretend everything is perfect. FOV is a huge problem for anyone who realistically hopes this will catch on with a large user base. I mean, look at the demo video they're all pointing to celebrating the FOV in. That is clearly not the FOV the device is going to have, it's just too big to match the numbers. But, they all eat it up because that's what people do when they invest so much hype in something."
HoloLens,3cvf3m,Shooob,2,Sat Jul 11 02:33:48 2015 UTC,WPC is an annual conference where Microsoft and their partners get together to catch up on the latest Microsoft strategies. There will be at least one HoloLens session. I don't expect that they'll say anything new but it's possible that we'll hear about more hands-on demos.  Monday @ 8:45 AM - WPC Keynote (livestream)  Tuesday @ 4:00 - 5:30 - Growing Your Business With HoloLens  edit: Times are in EDT.

HoloLens,3ctkh2,Tojuro,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:26:32 2015 UTC,"Does it break the illusion of TV when the picture doesn't extend past the screen?   No, because you are putting too much value in the peripheral vision.   Boxing up your vision isn't going to help, and greatly diminishes the potential for AR.     What you are describing could be replicated with pass-through augmented reality, like you see on mobile phones or the Nintendo DS systems, where the content is added to the camera output on a small screen."
HoloLens,3cqsti,Lemaz1ng,12,Fri Jul 10 01:00:20 2015 UTC,"And with Skype, they can do it geographically remote from each other, still see the same board, and as one player manipulates anything, all will see the changes reflected in real time"
HoloLens,3cqsti,khainesylph,0,Fri Jul 10 03:31:50 2015 UTC,Hopefully the Hololens will be able to do something similar. Everyone clears a 2'x2' space and the D&D app can create identical holograms for anyone connected to the game session online.
HoloLens,3cqsti,openzeus,4,Fri Jul 10 14:51:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats what I'm talking about, skype with hololens.  The demos show a scenario that would be close to this"

Any ""board"" based game will be easily transferred to Hololens.   There are murmors about Valve Dota VR demos where the field is on a table in front of you and you can get up close and inspect it in VR. Now imagine a games cafe where live Dota games are displayed on tables around the place.   Sweet jesus I'm excited about the future."
HoloLens,3cqsti,AzurousRain,2,Fri Jul 10 12:21:47 2015 UTC,Hearthstone would be even more awesome if they modeled every card in 3D :O
HoloLens,3cqsti,Seelengrab,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:54:53 2015 UTC,Every card is modeled in 3D to handle the card rotation and such in Unity.  Rumors is Blizzard is making a Universal app to deploy Hearthstone into Windows 10.  Here's hoping they make a HoloLens version at some point shortly after that.
HoloLens,3cqsti,Summons,3,Fri Jul 10 15:30:03 2015 UTC,"If that Universal App rumor is true, I'll just play it on my WP in bed instead of starting my day with HS on the PC xD  What I meant by 3D modeled cards was modeling the actual monsters, heroes, spells etc, to make it look like there's a real Questing Adventurer upgrading his gear :D"
HoloLens,3cqsti,Seelengrab,2,Fri Jul 10 15:47:00 2015 UTC,I'm imagining playing MTG similar to the Duel Disks from the second season of Yu-Gi-Oh. That'd be freaking awesome.

HoloLens,3cmpme,ralexand56,6,Thu Jul 9 08:32:24 2015 UTC,"According to my googlefu, it stands for Modulation Transfer Function, which represents how faithfully a lens reproduces or transfers detail of an image shown through it. The higher the number, the better the detail, basically.  http://photo.net/learn/optics/mtf/  So in other words, they want someone that has experience making lenses that have a wide fov and have very good image quality.  My extremely layman speculation is that maybe their plan is to instead of make a hololens style the way it is now, have an oculus style headset that's actually a pair of 'glasses' that you then also draw the light field onto. Because the glasses are much smaller than the headset, you could keep the same lightfield technology they're using (I assume), but just render them onto a curved surface instead... maybe. Solving the FoV issue with high quality lenses without having to make their actual rendering surface larger which I assume was an issue or at least very expensive.  But I have no idea, other than that they want a guy that knows his shit about lenses."

See this screencap. http://i.imgur.com/BSSulCy.png  Microsoft dimmed the FoV outside the hologram box, and shows it cutting off the head and legs of the holographic person.  (I think the dimming outside the box is artificial.  People who have used it say that the box cannot be seen in actuality, save for the fact that it cuts off the holograms.  They also appear to have made the hologram more transparent than in prior demo videos.  Here is another: http://i.imgur.com/rrzyvOT.png"
HoloLens,3ckoqo,xeoh85,6,Wed Jul 8 18:02:56 2015 UTC,I hope we don't see that frosted rectangle around everything like it is in that image. Can someone confirm or deny who have tried out the unit.
HoloLens,3ckoqo,ralexand56,4,Wed Jul 8 22:50:49 2015 UTC,"There was no frosted rectangle and it didn't blur around the edges in the demo I did. Edges were sharply cropped, although I don't doubt it can be achieved in software."
HoloLens,3ckoqo,BryanTheCrow,2,Thu Jul 9 13:14:37 2015 UTC,"The dark outer shade does a good job making the actual screen edges invisible, other than the abrupt cropping of any holograms that overlap (which will be pretty much any hologram, if you're not at least 10 feet away)."

HoloLens,3ck3mq,unt1tled,18,Wed Jul 8 15:09:21 2015 UTC,"Yet another Engadget reporter who doesn't know what they're talking about:   Unlike most VR headsets, all of the AR processing is done onboard the device.   What? He obviously doesn't know the difference between VR and AR (or Mixed Reality). HoloLens isn't like VR headsets because it's not a VR headset.   But the images need to fill your entire field of vision.   No, they really don't for an AR device. Would it be better if it had a wider FoV? Sure, but is it ""needed"" for a 1st Gen device? No.   Once I had my Minecraft world on the table, I didn't want to take it off.   This, above all else, is what Microsoft wants. And it tells me that as much as the reporter complains about the FoV, he wanted to keep using it. Which is exactly the same thing we hear/read from others that try the HoloLens.    Before that's achieved, I don't think HoloLens should be sold to the public.   So even though you wanted to keep playing with the HoloLens, the rest of the public wouldn't? Give me a break."

The reality is falling way short of what they're proposing.   What they've got now might be good enough for some specialized purposes, and sure, some consumers would buy them and be happy with it, but it doesn't seem to me like it'd be a really useful general AR device with the current FOV."

HoloLens,3ck3mq,eviljello,7,Wed Jul 8 19:36:30 2015 UTC,They will not fix FoV because they want to sell it at reasonable price point.

As for Google glass it was called explorer edition for a reason and the cost was far from a consumer buying it thinking it was for the masses.   The FOV is a big thing, but if you have it on your head and using it is a blast  so much so that you do not want to take it off, I think it is not as big a deal as most make it out to be.

HoloLens,3ck3mq,Strood,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:06:26 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, the physical limitation you are referring to is related to the material the HoloLens is being made out of. With the material they're using, it's physically impossible to have a wider FoV. With different material, a wider FoV can be achieved. However, this different material is much more expensive, and as such is not being used.  It's not so much physics, as it is economics."
HoloLens,3ck3mq,jaces_dream,0,Thu Jul 9 02:27:26 2015 UTC,No that's not what I was referring to. There is a physical refraction of light problem that can't be solved.
HoloLens,3ck3mq,Strood,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:52:15 2015 UTC,"Please elaborate. I could easily stick a giant screen on my face, in my periphery, and have light reach my eyes; I'm skeptical of there being an absolute physical limitation here."
HoloLens,3ck3mq,jaces_dream,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:19:21 2015 UTC,"Please elaborate. I could easily stick a giant screen on my face, in my periphery, and have light reach my eyes;   If your goal is only to have the light from the screen reach your eyes, no problem.  The challenge here is to have a translucent screen, where light from the screen reaches your eyes, but also allow light from your environment follow its usual path through the screen and onto your retinas - in a way that you're not compromising either environmental light or your AR light too much in service of the other.  It's a bit much to say this is an insoluble problem - but with the engineering path they've taken (some sort of a waveguide approach) they're not going to be able to turn around and say, ""Okay, we dropped more pixels in and not you've got 120 degree FOV,"" they'll have to start over with a radically different optical solution to see really dramatic changes to the FOV.  That said, apparently the tethered prototypes shown in January had a significantly larger (but still limited compared to typical HMDs) FOV -so it's clear that part of the reason they've scaled back is not optical but more likely in order to improve power requirements."

HoloLens,3ck3mq,Strood,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:08:23 2015 UTC,then how come the non production model had a larger field of view. They need to refine the manufacturing process. All in good time.
HoloLens,3ck3mq,coadyj,0,Wed Jul 8 22:24:53 2015 UTC,It's not about any manufacturing process. There is a limit to the light physics and the distance the screen is from your eyes.
HoloLens,3ck3mq,Strood,2,Wed Jul 8 22:28:54 2015 UTC,But that still doesn't address the original question of why the other model had a larger fov.
HoloLens,3ck3mq,ralexand56,-1,Wed Jul 8 22:45:24 2015 UTC,Who knows but I'll give you the obvious answer. Microsoft knew the small FOV would be an issue before they released it to the public and still did it and thus there must be some real reason why they couldn't make it bigger.
HoloLens,3ck3mq,Strood,2,Wed Jul 8 22:59:29 2015 UTC,Let's hope it's not a 25 cent part.
HoloLens,3ck3mq,gc3,0,Thu Jul 9 00:20:05 2015 UTC,"yeah, the reason is they want to have a slow rollout of the technology so they can make as much money as possible from it. It's obviously cheaper to make a smaller fov when they get their part cheaper and manufacturing down, the fov will be bigger.

HoloLens,3cf8fw,gom99,7,Tue Jul 7 15:14:09 2015 UTC,"They won't, Microsoft already said it's subject to change, but not by much if at all.  Probably has something to do with optics or battery life.  I am sure they are already investigating it.  This is just a 1st gen device, hopefully the 2nd one will be able to overcome this issue."
HoloLens,3cf8fw,MrHackworth,2,Tue Jul 7 17:40:07 2015 UTC,IIRC someone from the team says the optics manufacturer just hasn't need to make a bigger FOV version because it's never been ordered in bulk. If hololens takes off I'd say gen 2/3 will be much improved.
HoloLens,3cf8fw,ralexand56,0,Wed Jul 8 02:22:38 2015 UTC,That better not be the reason they deny us of a bigger FOV. Spend the money to get them to beef up their manufacturing if that's the case.
HoloLens,3cf8fw,MrHackworth,2,Wed Jul 8 14:56:54 2015 UTC,Unfortunately that's just not how most industrial production works. Forking out what I imagine would be an obscene amount of money on developing the machining tools to make larger FOV displays at scale would be risky if you can't show there's going to be a market.
HoloLens,3cf8fw,ralexand56,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:28:22 2015 UTC,But that's just there problem. You have to believe in your product especially something almost everyone believes is the future of computing. They are willing to waste money on tons of other things. They should make the investment into something that is about as close to a sure thing and a game changer than they've had recently.
HoloLens,3cf8fw,gom99,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:08:14 2015 UTC,"You have to remember, cost and time to market are important metrics as well.  VR/AR is potentially the next big home entertainment sector (think we have a while to go before it moves outside the home as well).  It is probably better to get a solid, but flawed product to market to get a wider array of feedback, and see how the development community works with it.  I am sure if they ran a limited edition Hololens and upped their cost to enterprise levels that they could achieve that device we all want.  But then we all couldn't get one.  Also, the device would be tailored to enterprise use, and not consumer use.  But one could make the argument for 2 products.  I still think the hololens as it exists today is nothing short of a marvel.  From all the articles I've read the surface detection, all-in-one device, image quality, device comfort are very well done."

HoloLens,3cbnf4,7Seyo7,5,Mon Jul 6 19:54:12 2015 UTC,"It's also likely to be the first thing that will see improvement as hardware and software improve.  Stuff like Oculus starts off bigger, bulkier, and requiring a tether to a more powerful computer but offers a much wider FOV.  Over time, they'll improve to slim it down and as chips get better, probably lose the tether.  Hololens is starting from the other angle.  It's light and wireless and also offers good performance...but the FOV is limited so future versions will probably offer wider FOV and higher-resolution imagery as hardware becomes more capable.  Really interesting to see the different approaches (not just counting VR vs AR)."

HoloLens,3bxv26,MrHackworth,2,Sat Jul 4 00:47:11 2015 UTC,The issue will be you arm being out of FOV of the device for most of the throw. As I understand it all the kinect camera are aiming forward (as you would expect) therefore anything to your side or back would not be seen.

HoloLens,3bxv26,Zohard_Tucheus_Anaim,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:58:35 2015 UTC,"Most likely. Kinect already does something like this, and HoloLens uses Kinect's technology.  If you have seen the Orbus(?) game demo/video, the character uses the surrounding as the level area (and therefore interacts with it). Any changes or movement of any real object in the environment will also affect the virtual characters/objects in HoloLens, as demonstrated in the Robot demo in BUILD. We don't know, however, the latency between this virtual and non-virtual interaction. Tracking latency is said to have been really good, so perhaps it's good too."

HoloLens,3by2jq,redrad56,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:42:51 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I don't doubt Microsoft will eventually compete.  With their new platform that allows you to write apps with one binary and be able to format the output based on the platform so it can adjust dynamically to each platform and then on top of that you have Hololens, which is going to be a big deal over time.  Windows 10 + Universal Apps + Improving the platform over time and doing so quicker + Hololens = Big sell  On top of all that offering Windows 10 for a Free upgrade for Windows 7 + Windows 8 users.  The only thing I would like to see Microsoft due that would be the ""ultimate"" smasher is to have Android 4.x emulation.   Android Emulator would be FREE Android Emulator would be a ""Universal App"" for Windows 10 Android Emulator would output so that the apps have Windows 10 look and feel while offering a built in Android Store   All of the features would be translated from Android to Windows, graphics, printing, GPS, ect...  If Microsoft did this and advertised it as an advantage.  I feel after a short period of time it would be over.  You could run all of your android apps on Xbox, your Windows Phone, Your laptop, Your Desktop, Your Windows Tablet, and on Hololens.  Imagine if on a laptop or desktop you could run Win32 apps, Win64 apps, Windows Universal Apps and Android apps all using the same interface."

HoloLens,3by2jq,Seelengrab,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:09:53 2015 UTC,"This is cool, but it's not the same thing.  It's not android emulation.  It just makes it easier for Microsoft to have their apps built if someone is already working on an android version.  The problem that Microsoft is having is that when you buy an Android device, you are not buying the device as much as you are buying into the ecosystem.  Microsoft needs a way to get into that ecosystem to nullify it.  So, if they have an emulator that is native (meaning it emulates the Android apps, but makes them look like Windows 10 apps) and you can still use that ""Android Play Store"", you can download the apps that you paid for on Android and run them directly on any Windows 10 device (because they are Universal apps), this would allow you to nullify the ecosystem and allow you to adopt Windows 10 as your new platform of choice.  Making higher quality and also low end phones (Low, Middle, Highend market) + Universal Android Emulator would make things really sweet and invite people into the Microsoft fold quickly.  That is what I would do."
HoloLens,3by2jq,SimpleWireFree,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:30:33 2015 UTC,"That's probably the last thing MS needs to worry about, they already have legions of developers all over the world who are familiar with the development stack.  Apple had the time had hardly any people (relatively, not absolute) developing desktop apps.  I don't think the mobile market is particularly relevant either. This is the desktop market if anything. Potentially also a new market and a way of making in roads to the mobile market as well."

Most start-UPS are fail or sell their stock to google before they become publicly traded so it is hard to get in on the ground floor.  And with manufacturing agreements and spec details unavailable, it is hard to guess who will benefit from making chips, displays, and other components.  AMD, who produces XB1 chips could get a nice rebound if they get a contract out of any of this.  Also AutoDesk stands to benefit from a/r and 3d printing growth.

I'd be very surprised if it was getting html back from bing and directly rendering it. That is a terrible design and MS knows better than that.   Ok, maybe it's not html directly, but it's web hosted code from Bing.  But this is what's happening as Bing continues to evolve, Microsoft has been adding more friendly results that can be displayed to us on the phone without having to navigate to websites and load them with all their crap/ads.   Microsoft only needs to provide a fairly simple API that other search providers can hook in to.   Ok, tell Apple/Google to do that first.  There's a few reasons manufacturers don't like giving such deep level integration.  1) it's a lot of work to make an API.  2) it's dangerous to give such deep level control.  Think of how much information your phone's search can access.  Contacts, e-mail, text messages, apps, phone settings, etc.  Then you throw in how this goes in as a background service (and most likely not optimized for the device hardware) it'll lower battery life on the phone, increase wear, and since it's another API, it'll probably be using up more data."

It never fully handled voice to text without a massive database to compare to and figure out pronunciations / bad grammer sentences, slurls, etc.   You really have no idea what your talking about. We had full voice dictation 20 years ago. I think the accuracy rate was around 85%-90%. It's actually much harder than the limited recognition cortana offers.  Dragon natuaraly speaking is one of the better known ones. It came out in 1997, a couple of months after the pentium 2. It was actually more accurate for me than google now is today, although to be fair I'm not sure if my balls had dropped yet.  My PC could do this 20 years ago, with a fraction of the processing power and storage of even a low range smart phone today. Why does it take a supercomputer now?"

So yeah, I think that processing is needed considering what it does.  And if you don't want the internet connection to figure out what you said, then they need to put in a supercomputer processor into it.  Sounds pretty illogical to me.

The explosions you're thinking of is the first stage descent. SpaceX is trying to do something incredibly difficult which is de-orbit the first stage and land it vertically like you used to see in kids cartoons.

HoloLens,3bfis9,Ampix0,5,Sun Jun 28 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"I think this whole FOV thing is overblown.   First off, FOV on an AR device is apples to oranges with VR devices.    VR is replacing everything and needs to fill the peripheral vision with stuff, even if the vast majority of image processing is done on a small cone that we focus on.       The truth is that AR only needs to fill in that small cone in the middle -- our focus.    Early reviewers of the HoloLens compare its FOV to a 60"" TV from about 8 feet away.   That means it fills our vision like your average television, which seems to work fine for the medium of TV.   And, TV, as a medium, did just fine when they were much smaller, with far lower resolution.  The only way I see a competing product being a risk to the HoloLens brand is if there was a competing product.    There isn't really any competition, much less competition with a 180 degree FOV.    And, I doubt you'll see that 180 degree product soon, given the technical complications."
HoloLens,3bfis9,Tojuro,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"I have a 60"" TV and I just tested standing 8' away from it. That's a really, really bad FOV. Moving my glasses away from my face to be about the size of the screen from where I was standing, that's an equivalent FOV to holding your glasses 5"" away from your eyes. Try that. It's really really bad.  I'm hoping that they improve this. I really want to replace that 60"" TV with a bunch of Hololenses so I open up the floor space in my cramped living room and have a virtual TV instead of a real one. You need that FOV so that you can actually see the whole TV. It'd be terrible if you have to keep moving your head around in circles, only able to see about a quarter of the screen at any given time, because the FOV is so terrible."
HoloLens,3bfis9,KimaniSA,0,Thu Jul 2 06:52:44 2015 UTC,"I think you are mostly right, but the 1st test of the hololens at the beginning of the year when they first revealed actually had a wider FOV than the one that was just recently demonstrated, and people responded very positively to it, and most of the complaints was how this new one felt very limited comparatively.  Now, I don't have the exact dimensions, but clearly 60 deg might not be good enough for customer satisfaction.  180 would probably be overkill, and bulky, but I can definitely see a healthier middle like 90 degrees or something like that to improve customer satisfaction and user experience.  AR still needs to feel fully immersive to trick your mind, and I think the end-goal is to at least eventually get something comparable to what eye glasses bring us today...  We'll get there, just might take a few more years in terms of shrinking the devices more, battery life, and so on... Honestly, I am convinced that in the next decade these things will probably all just stay powered on through wireless transmission anyway, at least while in your home."
HoloLens,3bfis9,GeneticsGuy,7,Tue Jun 30 03:17:28 2015 UTC,"Well then rest easy, because your fears have no basis in reality.  The hololens v1.0. Will succeed or fail on its on merits but will not determine the future of new iterations or a/r development in general.  I cant think of a single technology that was ruined because the first iteration had limitations.  Can you?  Google glass didn't stop msft from developing hololens or stop google from investing in magic leap, or apple from buying an a/r company.  It's moving forward, so rest easy, technology does need an overly-concerned mother to watch over it"

HoloLens,3bfis9,Soverance,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:49:56 2015 UTC,"a) you might want to double check your math on the 10 years calculation.  b) are you suggesting that if a tablet pc hadn't been introduced that someone would have somehow overcome the hardware limitations such as battery, shrinking SoC, and touch screens a few years sooner?  That if they just kept the tablet in the research phase that apple would have innovated sooner?    c) there are already a/r devices on the market and several more in development.  hololens vastly improves on these in many areas, including FoV.  Why haven't this other releases prevented exploration in the tech, but the hololens will?"
HoloLens,3bfis9,vizionvr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:56:45 2015 UTC,"The computing tablet design, according to the wiki, can be dated back to around 1956.  Additionally, there were a number of companies with commercial tablets available in the late 80's and early 90's, one of the most visible being Apple's Newton).  The biggest one in the 90's may have been the Palm Pilot? everyone had one of those back then.  Ampix0 is somewhat correct in that ""10 years"" point... Microsoft released the Pocket PC around 2000, and due to the poor performance of this device, the tablet market wasn't reinvigorated until ten years later, with the release of Apple's iPad device in 2010."

The extra effort to make something simple cool with all the effects flying around you.  What will probably happen in the near future: Nothing like this unfortunately, however I can see maybe a Yu-Gi-Oh game coming out much like how MTG has a limited amount of cards on their game on the Xbox 360/One.  This way the whole library of cards isn't available giving the developers enough time to make something to start then add on to it eventually.  Also another point I would like to make is that the game would probably look like something from the first generation of Yu-Gi-Oh (very first season too I might add) where they play on those big machines.  This would however happen on a table that you would use.  Perhaps single player would create an avatar to sit in the chair across from you and play.  Having a limit set for the boundaries (such as a table) sounds more realistic.  MTG doing something like this would be awesome too!  All for the flashiness potential of card games. :D"

Nintendo is working on its own holocomputing device, as well as Apple and others. Anyway, I don't think there are many Nintendo games on Windows, if any. Nintendo is pretty strict in this area. They were the first who pioneered the hardware lock for their games. They behave like the software Nazis and that's why they are still alive, unfortunatelly. E.g.

HoloLens,3baj8f,chachakawooka,3,Tue Jul 7 09:00:20 2015 UTC,"Though this sounds crazy impossible right now, when VR headsets start proliferating eventually some 13 year old hacker kid in china will do exactly this. As the number of people adopting it go up and up and up, the odds of someone finally doing it also go up. Odds are it would be a combination of a hardware hack (to bypass DRM/enforcements) with custom software/os to run. Definately possible and doable. Rockbox for mp3 players is one of many good examples of this happening, though replacing the OS on those players is nothing complexity wise compared to what would be involved to hack a hololens unit. But, one day there will be a ""hololensOsReplacer.exe"" or somesuch that will make it a 2 click affair."

They could all barely speak english and had lots of wierd knockoff computer parts and such, that actually seemed to work pretty well considering. But the employees would often change, and nobody had any idea where they lived. Jokes and rumors about the computer store started that they would smuggle employees in and out of the country in boxes of computer parts. When 2 really thin short chinese guys appeared one day we joked they were packing them in pairs to save money on shipping. The unofficial joke motto for the store (now long gone) was ""Compwing, where the parts are imported, and the employees are too."""
HoloLens,3baj8f,Pbkcars5000,3,Sat Jun 27 17:45:24 2015 UTC,"Rereading my story and thinking really hard about it, I'd say there was a good chance the store was a front or something for an actual human smuggling operation. It's the only explanation that makes any sense as I must have seen 30+ different employees within a year in a store that normally has 3 people to run it, and they were always helpful and polite so they definately arn't all getting fired."

With Windows Holographic you will be able to utilize those APIs as platform features on HoloLens and any other Win Holographic headsets down the road. Was that so hard. ;)  Due expect a Windows Holographic SDK, Alex was saying that UWP apps will work on Win Holographic from the get go but they won't be necessarily Windows Holographic friendly AKA 2D plane. This is where the framework comes in with Unity and etc. When he says Windows Holographic apps are UWP apps they're virtually the same you just would tailor your interface to the variants.  Don't expect direct access to the HPU, this will prevent rogue apps and crazy user interactions.  Start your Windows Holographic apps today!  Edit: Looking at Microsoft's trademark history the framework will be called CodeLens!"

The best way to ensure you receive developer updates and holographic APIs when available is to join the Windows Insider Program.   As it turns out this is false.   This is reading way too much into Kipman's twitter comment. A tweet does not overrule the official FAQ. The tweet and FAQ are also not entirely contradictory. All Xbox apps will be UWP apps too, but there are still specific features that are only available on Xbox. The same goes for phone apps, desktop apps, IOT apps, and undoubtedly holographic apps. Feature-detection across different devices is a basic component of the universal windows platform."

So I started out with a negative attitude, but after a while it was overshadowed for me by the overall design.  Having a self-contained headset that does everything to make AR work - tracking nearby surfaces, recognizing voice and hand input, etc. makes hololens look like the first generation of science-fiction-like AR glasses.  I'm sure that there could be other issues with the final product (maybe battery life or occasional tracking problems), but maybe if people can ignore the hype they'll appreciate what it can do instead of focusing on its limitations."

I am not sure how HoloLens works, but if the effect is created by sending different images to each eye, like stereoscopy, then we might have problem."
HoloLens,3b2juz,Interleap,2,Thu Jun 25 14:05:10 2015 UTC,I don't think you understand how vision or your condition actually works. Depending on the severity of your vision you may not experience depth of field as much as others. The Hololens does not bypass your cornea so you should expect a similar result from what you see in real life.   Now the real amazing thing would be to map out your corneas irregularity and convert the image on your worse eye to compensate for that. I have not seen any studies mention something like this.

HoloLens,3b1hyv,solarfingers,2,Thu Jun 25 14:26:45 2015 UTC,"There's only a few issues I can see with using VR to do AR. One is your AR FOV is also your entire FOV. The next is your vision of what's actually there is computer generated, so you can only see as good as your resolution, plus the light isn't natural reflections but oleds. Also, I don't believe cameras have typically very good FOV capture, even if your actual headset is good, so that'd have to be dealt with too. Finally I'd imagine there's some potential issues of latancy.  If they can get passthrough cameras that can pull in enough data to fill the whole HMD fov, and do it fast enough including video processing that it feels real time, I think VR will be the way to do AR."

AR is hard, harder than most other hard things.  Camera technology is not nearly advanced enough to do it properly on an immersive display, which is why you see most dedicated AR hardware going for an optically transparent approach.  Things along the lines of the GearVR camera passthrough can be useful tools, but not pleasant to use for any length of time.  Even basic passthrough is not as simple as putting two cameras on the headset - not only is the IPD wrong, the translation is completely off.  Stereoscopic video cannot accurately depict a ""real"" 3D scene, it is just a neat trick that can provide a similar effect under very specific constraints.   http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/2zrf5j/could_oculus_be_implementing_ar_mode_to_the_cv1/cplnai7"
HoloLens,3b1hyv,bboyjkang,2,Thu Jun 25 18:42:28 2015 UTC,"See-through AR (HoloLens) has an FoV problem due to the difficulty of bending light without lenses, but pass-through AR, i.e., the kind of camera-based AR/VR mixture that you're referring to, has problems on its own.  You can't just have a single camera mounted on a VR headset and display the camera's stream in VR. That way the entire world would appear two-dimensional, exactly as if you were watching a video on a regular 2D screen. It's pretty bad.  You also can't easily have two cameras side-by-side and pipe the left/right camera streams to the left/right eyes. The problem is that the field of view and projection parameters of the cameras will typically not match that of the viewer's eyes, which will cause 3D distortions and simulator sickness.  The best approach is to have depth cameras that capture a 3D model of the surrounding environment, and display that 3D model using standard VR rendering methods. This will create a realistic 3D impression, but depth cameras have resolution and latency problems. See this video and this video for example. This video shows how to embed virtual objects into a captured 3D environment (watch through to the end).  All these videos are five years old. We can do better than that now (but I stopped making those kinds of videos)."

The reason why the hype is at an all-time high is because of the restrictions and how MS is only letting out a trickle of information. Most people forget that occulus was a kickstarter project and was the reason why it had public dev-kits. MS will certainly have dev-kits to partner and prominent developers with a thick NDA and that's how it should be.  Morpheus, iphone, ipad, apple watch, original xbox, kinect 1, and more.  All those device did not come with a public kit and they were big apart of morpheus. You don't want 5,000 videos demonstrating your device and pointing out all it flaws before it launches and shows up at bestbuy, walmart, target, gamestop, etc.  You want to launch with adequate software and apps and have people rush out to experience and buy it.

If microsoft plans to do this, i guarantee, you that people will wait some time before microsoft ""go's public"" with the hololens. when publicized windows 10 to become an insider, people are already talking about how crappy and how slow it is for the average computer.

Every game at uses DirectX will already work with it, most likely with steroscopic 3D - even the old ones. Every windows application that exists will already work.

However given the dedicated external SOC systems being used, as well as the graphics accelleration and API use, as well as the very-convincing rumors that it uses intel Atom chips - Expect a typical intel x86_64 processor with all the functionality of a traditional atom-powered media-PC.  So in short, unless they decide to use ARM/RT (and that would be stupid on a fundimental level, given they are trying to get away from the RT nightmare). Yes, your run of the mill script-kiddy visual-basic Forms app will work, along with the C++ code I spin through my cross compilers, and that copy of Steam."

You're setting yourself up for disappointment. Holograms are Windows Universal apps that run on the Windows Universal Platform (as described in the FAQ). Read up on the Windows Universal Platform here. You're not going to be able to just throw together a native x86 (or ARM) executable, copy it to the HL and run it. And that goes for ""every windows application that exists""."
HoloLens,3b10be,darthpjb,0,Fri Jun 26 13:02:18 2015 UTC,"The ""windows universal platform"" is simply ""A version of windows that works on a device our toolchain supports"". What Microsoft are essentially doing is presenting a ""bundle"" of binary instruction code with their toolchain. Much like when Apple-apps provided both PowerPC and Intel instruction sets. Except this mechanism relies on using runtime translation rather than compile time : ie, you use the C#/.net frameworks and API and it ""just works"". But just like the above apple example, a C program compiled for PowerPC (with the appropriate header) will run on a PowerPC mac, but not an intel.  In this regard, ""windows universal"" is, as stated the provision of Window's API's on a hardware platform. If said hardware platform is x86, x86 applications will run. Further, take note that the ""hololense"" does run a UI-modified version of windows, that much is official. Take note of that concept - then run with it to the extent of sanity.  Providing hardware that uses a ""new"" platform isn't realistic - It's going to be ARM or x86. Providing a entirely new OS for a device running an existing platform is far too time-consuming (and costly) for a project that has already taken years of R&D.  Microsoft has a low-memory, high-speed kernel and system configuration for x86 and ARM already, as long as they use it (with appropriate modifications for UI and display), natively compiled applications will work. Providing the kind of experience they want, using x86 via Intel Atom is the logical decision - especially given the amount of 3D processing needed will require at the least a meaty parrell GPU (I'm expecting an onboard Nvidia/AMD Mobile processor at the least).  [edit] as for reading up on the platform, the best place to start is the ground up, consider this some light reading: https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Universal-Windows-app-cb3248c3/view/SamplePack#content"

I didn't do that, I wish it had been me because I'd probably not need to work for the rest of the year looking at it.  You get a lot of people who don't have much interest in paying real money for this, but if they're going to one of the more expensive trade shows in more higher-priced countries (think US, UK rather than Africa, India, etc) they're generally willing to spend a fair amount to show off what they do.

It's likely it uses very similar tech to Kinect for spatial mapping though, unless they went for LIDAR but I doubt it as they've got a pretty good set of tech for IR right now.  Microsoft's stuff is pretty good, download the toolkit and you'll get loads of samples with it, and the docs will tell you how they work and how they're made. Kinect 2.0 is where it's at though, if you have a Kinect for Xbone already you can get an adapter for it instead of buying a new one.

HoloLens,3asgo0,yellowviper,8,Tue Jun 23 03:38:08 2015 UTC,"There are basically two kinds of AR: pass-through and see-through. Pass-through AR is what you've been able to do on smartphones and tablets for many years now. You place AR markers into the environment so the smartphone/tablet camera can detect its own position and orientation relative to the marker(s), and the virtual objects are rendered via standard 3D graphics and composited into the camera image to appear as ""holograms,"" albeit only visible on the smartphone/tablet screen.  See-through AR is when the user wears a headset like HoloLens or Moverio or Meta etc., which measures its position and orientation relative to the real environment in some way (often using the same AR markers), and then renders virtual objects as usual and projects them into the viewers eyes so they appear as ""holograms"" embedded into the real environment.  HoloLens is better than all other see-through AR devices I've tried because it nailed marker-less tracking via its multiple depth cameras and whatever other sensors it has, but the basic principle is the same.  Unless Microsoft pulled a rabbit out of a hat, the camera they used for the on-stage demos is nothing magical: it's regular pass-through AR using high-end digital cameras, and using the HoloLens' marker-less positional tracking technology.  Meaning, if you're willing to live with placing markers into your livingroom, you can do what the stage demo camera did right now. Just download any of the available pass-through AR software for your device of choice, for example the ARToolkit."

Adaptation is a big part of moving forward in technology. Microsoft pushes the Hololens forward which is great. If others hadn't pushed the smartphones forward Microsoft had no technology to build a Hololens because it highly relies on hardware used in smartphones. That's how the world works. It's not negative if you are being copied. If others copy what you do you did something very correct. Patents are a way to brake the progress in technology and people like Elon Musk have understood and got rid of it. Everyone is free to build a Tesla Model S using all its technology for free.

If it works anything like the robots I've worked with, they'll have it build a map of the room using that data, and as they continue to map the room, they use any passes over previously mapped features to improve the knowledge of the position and orientation of the headset. Then, the headset just has to do some relatively simple (for a computer! Doing it by hand sucks!) computations to figure out where the apps have to be in relation to itself.  If you want to know more about this, the process is called SLAM, which stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping."

I have done that thing in the video using VR headsets with 33% larger FoV than HoloLens', and it significantly reduced effectiveness.

HoloLens,3afewu,visgc,2,Fri Jun 19 20:20:16 2015 UTC,"Here's an example. One application Microsoft highlighted during their Build keynote was using HoloLens as a big-screen TV replacement. The demonstrator opened a huge video window on the living room wall. According to comments I've seen, this seems to be a highly attractive use case for many people.  So say you're creating a giant video window, say 120"" diagonal, on your wall to approximate the IMAX experience. Problem is, from eight feet away, HoloLens can only show a 60"" diagonal image, approximately. So you can only see 1/4 of your big screen at a time, and if you happen to look at the top-left corner, you're going to completely miss anything that happens in the other four corners. I'm skeptical that that would be a compelling movie-watching experience.  Granted, HoloLens can create a virtual 60"" screen at 8 feet away, but that's not what most people who make these comments want."
HoloLens,3afewu,DontFearTheFuture,2,Fri Jun 19 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"from eight feet away, HoloLens can only show a 60"" diagonal image, approximately   Funny, this is exactly the calculation I came up with. (And I've been researching a lot)   Basically what I came up with is a ratio of 0.62 to 1.  Meaning, for every 1 foot you are away from a surface, the Hololens can display a diagonal window of 0.62 feet.  Your 8 feet = 60"" diagonal matches perfectly.  Currently, we have a 55"" television at 12 feet away from us in our family room.  A Hololens could then provide roughly a 90"" display.  Much better than we have now."

That would be nice.  When the guy opened Skype at the Build conference, Skype was fixed centered in his view until he pinned it to the wall.

HoloLens,3afewu,solarfingers,3,Sat Jun 20 04:39:38 2015 UTC,"Problem is, from eight feet away, HoloLens can only show a 60"" diagonal image, approximately.   So then I'll make a 60"" widescreen TV/PC monitor projected on the wall. Still bigger than what I have now. And not only that, if I want a bigger screen I just have to stand a bit further away so that it fits PLUS I can move it, with a hand gesture, to any wall I want, any time I want without breaking a sweat. People want it to fill up their full FoV, I get that. But having less than that doesn't negate what you can do with what's available right now. Besides, to be honest, if I want a full FoV, I'll plug in my Oculus and sit back and relax."

Unless I held the device up in a certain way, I started to miss out on pieces of the presentation.   Do you mean having to turn your head? Is it really that much of a bother to tilt your head slightly to see some other part of the hologram? Does it really warrant a ""decent"" rating which turns in to being a dealbreaker just because you didn't want to move your head around?  I could understand if there were other, more severe limitations such as opacity, tracking, location awareness, resolution, ghosting, judder, latency, motion sickness, headaches, too heavy, uncomfortable, too unrealistic, etc. etc. but the only problem you have is that you didn't want to move your head."

Not even going into the FOV related side of things there is no way for that demo to have gone the way it did without it being purely pre-recorded content. In the first part of the video where he is playing off the wall, the camera was streaming live content from Sax's glasses , and if that is the case, then the HoloLens must have streaming tech built into it (very much doubt that MS would have been built in yet). Next the camera switched to a entirely separate view from Sax's which means it would have to have an account of its own to ""view from"", if that is the case then why would Sax's ""world interactions"" (moving the map, zoom, etc) effect the cameras view of the world?  Way too much ""breaking the fourth wall"" in that demo for it to have worked the way it did. And too many people are just eating up the term ""specially rigged camera that has built in HoloLens hardware"" BS which explains it all."

Demanding things on reddit doesn't make them happen.  Each of us is faced with 3 options.    1) Forget about AR for now until a better FoV becomes available. 2) Embrace the capabilities of the device that is released 3) Figure out a solution yourself  For my part, .I can't wait to try the experiences that are available in the hardware's current state and can appreciate the bright future for much more.  The thing has a much larger FoV than cell phones, tablets, PCs, and even TVs and is capable of everything these devices can do and much, much more...in 3D.  We all own the above devices but the hololens is supposed to be a useless bomb of a reputation destroyer.  Heh.  The notion that supporting this device in it's current state will prevent future advances and ignoring the hololens will somehow spurn engineers to create the same device but with better FoV.  Heh."

Especially after the novelty wears off. We pay alot for cell phones but we also use them 24/7. how much use will hololens get through out the day? that's the question.  All i'm saying is that, low fov means very low adoption. which means low dev support and will result to low apps being available. which directly effects your use of the device.  d1 for me if $799 or under. else its not worth the money due to FOV limitations."

They are foremost a software company and the direction Windows 10 with Universal Apps is going, I can see a strategy unfolding.  Does nobody else find it interesting why Microsoft is working closely with competing hardware technologies?  One last thought.  Your eye can only focus on a narrow FOV anyhow.

This type of device, with this level of technology, and this amount of R&D has never been done before. No one, not you or me, knows how much market acceptance it's going to have. We also don't know how much FoV in a device like this is ""good enough"". In VR ""bigger is better"" when it comes of FoV because you need a fully immersive experience. In AR (or mixed reality), that's not necessarily true. Based on the 100s of people who have tried it in recent months so far, the overwhelming majority enjoyed the experience. That's not to say that all of them will buy it; after all, we don't know how much it's going to cost. Indeed, I believe the price of the HoloLens is going to be the main driver in acceptance, moreso than FoV.  In addition, MS has announced partnerships with some pretty big companies. If they felt the FoV was going to majorly impact the experience and market acceptance they would wait until either V2 or a competing product. These companies don't take partnerships lightly, especially when it comes to new and unproven devices and technology. There's a huge risk involved and they at least believe it's worth it."
HoloLens,3ah7vu,smoledman,-2,Sat Jun 20 13:06:54 2015 UTC,"trying out something for an hour is different from living with it 24/7. yeah its like marriage. In an one hour demonstration, its the most amazing thing you ever seen. but when you live with it. its faults that you dismissed starts becoming ever more glaring. its weaknesses starts popping up as it usage either increases or decreases then you start regretting the $1,000 you dished out.  I'm buying surface pro 4 later this year. Why should i buy this in place of the pro for the same amount? only if it can replace the pro could that even be a thought.  Let's be real, the price range will be able a grand give or take. The base model of surface pro 3 is $799. There is no way this thing cost less than the surface. And we all know people don't buy things off of niche demonstrations (unless they are techies) but off of wants or needs and sometimes it reaches the paradigm shift of both.   People need/want smartphones. People need surface pros. People want smartwatches. People need TV. People need computers/laptop. People want ipad.  People want hololens? well we would be naive to not think that a tight FOV wouldn't cut that desire for over 70% of people.  people need hololens? If hololens is shown to be able to replace my day to day productivity, entertainment and gaming then a need is created.  FOV matters as much as price. with a $1,000 price tag. this won't be a kiddie device unless its subsidized."
HoloLens,3ah7vu,interger,2,Sat Jun 20 14:19:29 2015 UTC,"Now you're throwing around fictional numbers to try to back up your argument. No one outside of MS knows what the price is going to be at release. The only hint we have is ""HoloLens would cost significantly more than a game console"" based on this NYTimes article. But how much is ""signifcant""? Is it $500? Is it $1000?    a tight FOV wouldn't cut that desire for over 70% of people.   Where are you pulling that number from? It's a made up number that has no basis in fact. The fact is that we don't know what that number is going to be. It's more likely that MS, and partner & competitor companies, are paying close attention to the feedback they're hearing. I can guarantee you that they are all doing market research, and probably have been for a couple of years already. If they feel the ROI is there, they're going to keep moving forward. That's what companies do. Based on their market research, MS obviously feels good enough to move forward.

HoloLens,3aekn3,red_arma,5,Fri Jun 19 14:12:09 2015 UTC,"Hololens has depth cameras at the sides and an IMU, those provide information that makes it much easier to get a position then just with a raw 2D image. Here is a longer talk on the topic, it uses Kinect, not Hololens, but what Hololens is doing is probably quite similar. That said, what Microsoft is doing is still impressive, as nobody else so far has managed to get tracking as fast and precise."
HoloLens,3aekn3,grumbel,5,Fri Jun 19 16:41:18 2015 UTC,"The HoloLens has two Kinect-like depth cameras on it (facing forward-left and forward-right), which continually scan the environment of the user. These cameras create three-dimensional geometric representations of objects in the environment.  Say that the user is looking at a table in the room. The cameras will sense a rectangle at a certain position/orientation relative to the headset, and an additional suite of sensors, namely and inertial measurement unit (IMU) of accelerometers and gyroscopes, will tell HoloLens that the rectangle is horizontal.  Now imagine the user taking a step forward. The cameras will again sense the table, but now the table top is going to be in a different position relative to the headset (it will be somewhat closer). The HoloLens tracking software deduces that the new rectangle is the same as the old rectangle, and assuming that the rectangle didn't move, it can now calculate exactly by how much the user moved between the two scans. The result of this is a continuously-updated estimate of the headset's (and user's) position and orientation relative to the surrounding environment, which is exactly what's needed to insert virtual objects (""holograms"") into the real environment.  While that is going on, the HoloLens also continuously updates its current 3D model of the environment by accumulating new scans into the existing model using some variation of the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) algorithm, see also Kinect SLAM.  SLAM yields drift-free position and orientation tracking as long as the environment is mostly static, but it suffers from noise and relatively high latency. To account for that, HoloLens most probably uses Kalman filter-based sensor fusion to merge drift-free, noisy, high-latency tracking data from SLAM with drifting, low-noise, low-latency tracking data from its IMU, resulting in a drift-free, low-noise, low-latency overall solution.  These algorithms are very computationally intensive, but are (most probably) implemented in custom silicon in the so-called ""holographic processing unit"" that's part of the HoloLens package."

Last thing we need is getting a piracy letter in the mail for turning my honda civic into a lamborghini for myself.

You can turn on sharing for nearby devices maybe and it would run over bluetooth or an ad-hoc wifi. It would be a pretty cool interface if you can just look at someone wearing a HoloLens and air-tap them to start sharing holograms.   It would also obviously be useful for multiplayer gaming, or if you have a household where you want to co-customize holograms with others."
HoloLens,3acjqs,openzeus,3,Fri Jun 19 02:02:49 2015 UTC,"Kipman talked about this during build. He said the other user would have to allow it, but it seems like that's what they are doing by having the hololens user and a hololens strapped to a camera sharing what they see. The mars demo also had two users."
HoloLens,3acjqs,ralexand56,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:55:32 2015 UTC,Good to know!  I was wondering if the devices could connect to each other as well as mentioned above on multiplayer games for example.  Such as a card game that could be played up to four people.  Having everyone playing against each other on the same table would be awesome of they can all see the 3D animation happening!

HoloLens,3a8z56,ralexand56,22,Thu Jun 18 04:20:26 2015 UTC,"Comment I just made in another thread:  As far as anybody outside Microsoft knows, the HoloLens' display is based on planar holographic waveguides (the two small pieces of flat material, one each directly in front of the viewers eyes). This paper goes into all the details.  The field of view of planar waveguides is limited by the total internal reflection angles of the optical material, which in turn depends on the material's index of refraction. For cheap-ish materials with an index of refraction of 1.7, the maximum achievable field of view is around 36 degrees; for high-end optical glass (n=1.85), it's around 45 degrees. Source."
HoloLens,3a8z56,Doc_Ok,10,Thu Jun 18 05:00:48 2015 UTC,"All the information in your post seems reasonable to me and the linked paper is a good resource.  The question that's most interesting to me at this point is what was the FOV of the first prototype displayed (on Jan 21st) and what is it now? I remember you claiming something much smaller than 30 degrees as the current FOV, and everyone who tried both the Jan 21 and the later prototypes swears the earlier ones had a larger FOV. The first prototypes did involve a bulky computer pack, but the optics for that unit did not appear to be that much larger than the current iterations.  Even the earliest prototypes had complaints about FOV size, and even with the later prototypes some people still say the FOV is fine, so personal expectations and preferences clearly override the actual specs... however, it's clearly technically possible to have a HoloLens with the FOV as it was originally demoed in January, whatever that was."
HoloLens,3a8z56,BI_Joe,8,Thu Jun 18 05:23:27 2015 UTC,"I measured the FoV at Build 2015 as approximately 30 degrees by 17.5 degrees. Here's a picture showing how I did that, and how you can replicate it at home.  There might be many reasons why they could create a higher FoV in a non-integrated, non-portable, non-mass produceable prototype, but not in the final device."

That's another question I would like answered from MS. What's different between now and January that caused the reduction in field of view."
HoloLens,3a8z56,Doc_Ok,5,Thu Jun 18 05:21:17 2015 UTC,"They might have been using super-duper high-end glass in the initial prototype, and realized that they can't sell that at cost, so had to go to ""regular"" glass and the concomitant lower FOV. That's speculation on my part. It might also be that the first prototype used a completely different image generation technology that turned out to be impractical to mass-produce or miniaturize."
HoloLens,3a8z56,Cueball61,2,Thu Jun 18 05:28:53 2015 UTC,I can't imagine that high end glass is so expensive that it would make much of a dent in the price of a $600-1200 device when it could put a lot of people off.

HoloLens,3a8z56,hololeo,9,Thu Jun 18 04:29:56 2015 UTC,"Magic Leap has not publicly disclosed anything that would indicate that they can create larger FOV transparent displays in a head-mounted form. They do have a convincing AR system in a very large, stationary form and also a slightly more portable (shopping cart-sized), more constrained system, but nothing that would appear to be an improvement on the current state of the art. They might have other undisclosed tech though.  On the other hand, there are technologies that can get around the FOV limitations that AR is facing and Microsoft is pursuing them (as evidenced by their recent hiring of Andrew Maimone, one of the researchers behind pinlights), but those technologies will take time to refine and bring to market. Eventually this will be fixed, but I'd rather not wait for it if everything else is ready."

FOV plus low latency perception are an interesting set of variables to understand deeply.   Not particularly concrete and there are few CEOs I trust less on technical matters than Rony Abovitz, but we at least know he thinks it's important (or thinks he should say he thinks it's important... I'm way too jaded about Magic Leap; hopefully they're doing alright).   Nice find with the pinlights.   They've been posted to this subreddit before. Maimone's dissertation is genuinely cool and it's good to see him going to MSR, but they are unfortunately still early in development."

HoloLens,3a8z56,BI_Joe,2,Thu Jun 18 05:28:52 2015 UTC,"PCWorld impressions: My chief complaint? The field of view is terrible. Your eyes have a natural field of view of about 180 degrees. Starbreeze’s new StarVR headset boasts 210 degrees. Oculus and Valve’s virtual reality headsets compromised on 110 degrees.  http://www.pcworld.com/article/2937446/microsofts-augmented-reality-halo-is-breathtaking-but-hololens-still-needs-work.html  I don’t know what the field of view is on HoloLens, but if the Oculus Rift/HTC Vive have a “looking at the world through ski goggles” feel on occasion, then HoloLens is like looking at a cell phone screen someone held up five feet in front of your face. Or like peering at the world through the slit of a welding mask.  The field of view is so small—both vertically and horizontally—that Microsoft’s own demo didn’t fit the constraints. I constantly had to tilt my head up and down, left and right to try and take in the full scope of the “holograms” in the Halo 5 experience. And these weren’t massive, life-size objects. They were eight-inch-tall scale models (if I had to estimate based on the size of the table and the perceived “distance” from my eyes)."
HoloLens,3a8z56,SimpleWireFree,2,Thu Jun 18 15:27:35 2015 UTC,"Comparing VR FOV to AR FOV is apples to oranges.    VR is replacing everything you see, while AR is putting objects into the real world.    The fact is that our brain does far less analysis, and a great deal more guesswork, on peripheral vision than it does with what we are looking directly at.    The ability to augment the peripheral vision just isn't nearly as important as it is for VR to fill it with something.    I would argue that the lack of a decent representation of your arms & body in VR is more off-putting than what the limited FOV on the HoloLens is like, under your typical usage for each device.    They compare the FOV on HoloLens to a 60"" TV from 8 feet away.   If you were watching a TV like that would the fact that the image doesn't go outside of the TV take you out of a movie?   No."

HoloLens,3ad64c,DontFearTheFuture,2,Fri Jun 19 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"Hey Folks.  I have a question.  What does everyone think the FOV is of the image titled “Demo” in the link provided up above?  If I remember right, that table was described as being roughly 3 foot by 3 foot in dimension.  Interesting that the image titled “Demo” doesn’t even contain that entire 3 x 3 foot table in its view.  For example, if I was standing in the same spot as the person holding the camera that provided that image, I would easily still be able to see the rest of the back part of that stage though my peripheral vision.  I would, for example, be able to see someone out of the corner of my eye hiding behind a curtain on the stage waiting for their turn to enter the show.  As I type this on my computer, out of the right corner of my eye I see my kitchen table roughly 20 feet away, and out of my left corner of my eye, see my fireplace roughly 10 feet away.  What I’m trying to say is this:  My personal belief is that the image labeled “Demo” has roughly the same FOV as the Hololens but doesn’t appear that way because the camera does not have peripheral vision.  Our peripheral vision helps us compare our surroundings with what we are seeing to help us get a better understanding of size.  So while that image titled “Demo” looks all immersive, if you took the full peripheral vision of the person holding that camera and added it to that image, you would find that image or window would be much less immersive.  Meaning, you don’t realize how small the window titled “Demo” really is because there is no peripheral vision to compare it to.  So when the person who posted the image comparing the estimated field of view for Hololens, they are essentially showing a smaller window inside a window that is already small to begin with."
HoloLens,3ad64c,BI_Joe,2,Fri Jun 19 20:07:09 2015 UTC,"This is on point. The ""demo"" image is an image with roughly a 16:9 aspect ratio that shows a hologram over a relatively small area.

HoloLens,3a7c26,magicmellon,10,Wed Jun 17 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"No one outside of Microsoft really knows, although I talked about this issue to some extent in a previous post.   Is it battery life? or screen size? or the webcams FOV?   The sensor FOV is not a limiting factor (it's been reported as 120 degrees by 120 degrees). Battery life and processing capabilities are factors, but I think the optics are the major constraint.  It is fairly well established that the January prototypes had a larger FOV than the current batch and the ones shown at Build. To repost another one of my comments:   From the press reports alone, it does seem pretty clear that there's a difference between the Build devices and the January prototypes. The question is: why the change?  Was it a cost-cutting measure for Build? On the one hand, it seems odd to cut costs when demoing the device for the first time to a wide audience. On the other hand, Build is an audience of developers, and making high fidelity HoloLens prototypes is a huge expense for a weekend event since they're still being produced in tiny volumes.  Was it a conscious decision to favor resolution over field of view? The new prototypes have a smaller FOV than the old, but they also appear to have a higher resolution. It's possible that there's simply a tradeoff here, although from the reaction to the two prototypes, it's clear that the larger FOV is the winning side of that trade-off. Or at least that's the impression people have after using the device briefly. With extended use, perhaps higher resolution is more useful than a larger FOV though not as immediately impressive.  Was it unfinished? The smaller FOV design may be a step towards a final version of the device with alternative methods of expanding the FOV. In that case, which seems to be what ilovegoogleglass is suggesting, the current prototypes may have taken a hit in FOV because they moved to the display technology used in the final version of the device without some components of that system available yet.  I think all of these possibilities are reasonably likely. Personally, I believe that the HoloLens hardware was slightly behind schedule for Build. We were originally supposed to get information on the SDK during Build, which notably didn't happen. The hardware is very close to being done, but the delay of the SDK release is likely due to delays in the production schedule of the hardware, not the state of the SDK itself. That being the case, it seems reasonable to assume that the hardware at Build was not final (and the manual entry of IPD is one major indication that it's not final hardware) but HoloLens had to make an appearance at Build regardless.   Edit: the FOV in the prototype appears to be approximately final, based on comments Kudo made recently (as posted here). Nothing is final yet, and bear in mind that Microsoft is aware of these issues, but yeah, might want to rein in expectations."
HoloLens,3a7c26,BI_Joe,3,Wed Jun 17 20:51:58 2015 UTC,"So, you think it's just a stage In the development? And the screen may be slightly larger in the real thing?!"
HoloLens,3a7c26,BI_Joe,4,Wed Jun 17 21:03:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do.  I wouldn't bet that much on it, since it still seems extremely difficult to make a wide-FOV AR display, but I do expect the consumer release to have a larger FOV in response to the critiques they've received so far.  I think most people are underestimating the difficulty of creating a see-through display like the one used by the HoloLens. It's really substantially different from most commercially available devices. Obtaining a comparable display now would cost thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars, although that price is going to plummet as AR manufacturers switch to consumer products from business (primarily military)."
HoloLens,3a7c26,BI_Joe,3,Wed Jun 17 21:38:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I was thinking of suggesting the curve it- but knowing how long regular screens took to curve I was like, that's just stupid! It is really cool though! Seems better than the google glass projector thing (although that was really clever) do you think you'll get a holo when it comes out? I really want one- but I think the FOV will be the killer, and maybe battery life too! I just really want to be in the first to develop it!"
HoloLens,3a7c26,BI_Joe,2,Wed Jun 17 21:41:10 2015 UTC,"do you think you'll get a holo when it comes out?    You're asking me this, of all people? LOL, of course I'm getting one when it comes out. I really want to develop for it as well. I really, really want use and/or build 3D modeling tools that actually visualize models in 3D. To a very slightly lesser extent, I also want to have a holographic dog, globe, Martian landscape, weird alien thing that runs around collecting orbs, anatomy guide, Skype app, experimental AR FPS, and all the other announced and yet-to-be-announced applications for HoloLens.  I'd obviously like a large FOV and long battery life, but I'd accept deficiencies in those areas if I could use a HoloLens now."
HoloLens,3a7c26,root88,2,Thu Jun 18 04:36:46 2015 UTC,"Do you not think it's worth waiting for second generation? As someone else posting said, for sustainable profits they have to hold back on the first model! I'm definitely waiting till the first few service patches!"
HoloLens,3a7c26,SauntOrolo,3,Thu Jun 18 07:16:09 2015 UTC,"The idea that they'll need to ""hold back"" anything is ridiculous, because tech in this area is improving rapidly and the following generations will be much better anyway.  For me the decision is pretty clear. I have enough uses for HoloLens in its present form that it would not be worth the wait. I'm not typically an early adopter, but HoloLens would be too useful to me to pass up. However, if it were possible to get a flagship phone or Surface Pro with HoloLens-quality spatial tracking and mapping (and full Windows Holographic support), I might take that over a first generation HoloLens."
HoloLens,3a7c26,ralexand56,2,Thu Jun 18 08:02:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe there will be more than one version? One with a larger field of view for gaming and one with a smaller field, but better resolution for  small details, like reading text. I would think that, eventually, there would be a large field of view and high resolution across all of it, but maybe the hardware just can't handle that many pixels.  Maybe it's all the same resolution and it just feels like more resolution when the view is scaled down. Maybe there is a setting that is not currently user configurable that can resize the output."
HoloLens,3a7c26,root88,3,Thu Jun 18 01:31:48 2015 UTC,"I think that may be accurate.  Consider that MS Ceo Nadella is interested in the hololens as a business application - telepresence for expert tasks,  augmented reality for assisting in business/construction/maintenance type tasks.  Sure they will show off Minecraft and promote the experience as a gaming device, but Microsoft built its empire with business software.  *Therefore they may build a scaled down FOV device first and then have a more 'augmented reality' improved FOV device second."
HoloLens,3a7c26,ralexand56,2,Thu Jun 18 03:29:54 2015 UTC,Doubt they will release multiple SKUs. Would be a little confusing to users.

HoloLens,3a7c26,CheetohTheFragile,10,Thu Jun 18 00:24:02 2015 UTC,"As far as anybody outside Microsoft knows, the HoloLens' display is based on planar holographic waveguides (the two small pieces of flat material, one each directly in front of the viewers eyes). This paper goes into all the details.  The field of view of planar waveguides is limited by the total internal reflection angles of the optical material, which in turn depends on the material's index of refraction. For cheap-ish materials with an index of refraction of 1.7, the maximum achievable field of view is around 36 degrees; for high-end optical glass (n=1.85), it's around 45 degrees. Source."
HoloLens,3a7c26,newfor2015,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:58:36 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... Makes sense- so for a larger FOV they need not only higher quality materials- eg glass, but also denser(?) materials for a greater TIR angle!"

Cost/power consumption/battery life/heat dissipation/weight and other ergonomic factors/processing/display size/latency/resolution/time to market. Yeah, FOV might be a problem, but the real question is, is it good enough for 1st gen for it warrant a 2nd or 3rd gen device?"
HoloLens,3a7c26,newfor2015,7,Wed Jun 17 21:45:41 2015 UTC,"Is there anybody else besides me who wouldn't mind a wired version of the Hololens if it means a more powerful device with a wider FOV, more power, etc. I mean there are still plenty of cool things you could do with it. I'd rather get the best experience possible than force them to rush an imperfect mobile device."
HoloLens,3a7c26,root88,3,Wed Jun 17 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"That's what I want too.   Without having tried too many variations, I imagine I rather to have a wire going down to a belt clip or shirt pocket so that the headset itself is as light and comfortable as possible, but have it fitted with the best camera/display/lenses/audio as possible so that it looks and sound good.   Let the belt pack hold a hefty battery pack and the main PCB. Sure that belt pack ruins some of the immersive experience, but  I don't think I would care about a single wire down my back.   I don't think we're at a point where it's technologically feasible to cram all the stuff we want into a headset comfortably."
HoloLens,3a7c26,CheetohTheFragile,3,Wed Jun 17 23:40:26 2015 UTC,I don't see why you couldn't have all the processing done on your computer and then have just the view streamed to the headset via Bluetooth or WiFi. The headset wouldn't need to be more powerful than a cell phone and you could fit a lot more battery in it.
HoloLens,3a7c26,Casey_jones291422,3,Thu Jun 18 01:38:08 2015 UTC,Apparently latency is a big issue. Sending that amount of data back and forth over wifi or BT is too slow
HoloLens,3a7c26,Summons,2,Thu Jun 18 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know. At that point, isn't it just a fancier Oculous Rift? Isn't the whole point to get up and move around your environment?  However, if you mean that you wear a Ghostbusters backpack with a computer in it and a wire connected to it, then yeah, I would say it's still worth it."
HoloLens,3a7c26,ralexand56,4,Thu Jun 18 01:35:23 2015 UTC,VR and AR are different experiences regardless of whether you can walk around. Working at my desk Tony Stark-style would be cool enough to me for first gen.

Microsoft are obviously aware of the limitation as it is the first comment of just about everyone who tries it, so they must be very keen to enlarge it. The fact that they haven't (yet) seems to imply that it's not easy to do. If it's not possible that would be a real shame, as it sounds like this tech with an immersive sized FOV would be insanely awesome."
HoloLens,3a3pr1,solarfingers,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:21:25 2015 UTC,"FoV seems to find it's way into every single hololens topic, so check through the post history here on reddit.  BIJoe and IloveGG have done great work posting some patents and other sources to help us understand this one remaining obstacle.   A lot of it is highly technical.  There is also a lot of speculation in some of the topics around the time of the build conference about whether the FoV is final for v.1.0 or just a manufacturing limitation or information security.  What we know is that the hacked together January kits had larger FoVs, there are very real limitations when reflecting light and refocusing it to the eye, and MSFT has been extremely protective of prototypes and quiet about this particular issue.  Providing only vague hints like holoens is 'smacking right up against the laws of physics'.    It's tough to read the tea leaves on this one, but it appears the  E3 prototypes were essentially the same ones used at build.  One last thought from hololens creator Alex Kipman:  ""In physics, there are laws you can't bend. But in software, you can bend anything. So nothing is impossible.""  This quote pretty much sums it up for me...It's impossible!, but is it?"

The fact that its 3d and looks like it actually exists in your world seems to make a huge difference. I was just reading and article on polygon where they say,   the virtual screen was about the size of a deck of cards if you held it in front of your eyes with your arm half-extended. It sounds small, and in some cases, including once you first put it on, it looks small. But once you get into the experience of playing a game with it, the size issue seems to fade away. http://www.polygon.com/e3-2015/2015/6/16/8791473/hololens-project-x-ray-delivers-a-first-person-augmented-reality"
HoloLens,3a2nrx,AkNak,4,Wed Jun 17 06:34:35 2015 UTC,"That was also stated by a lot of people who experienced the HoloLens at //Build. There were a lot of comments about how they did notice the FOV when they put the headset on and felt it was very limited, but then after a few minutes (seems to be between 5 - 15 minutes from the articles/reviews I've read) that you don't even notice it. I don't always read the comments on articles but there was one I read from someone who said they were an optometrist. They said that they will get the same immediate feedback from people who have to wear certain types of glasses, but after a few minutes they hardly notice it. It has something to do with your brain getting used to it. The HoloLens (and AR & VR in general) is already tricking your brain into believing something is there that isn't. I don't think it's far-fetched in believing that after using the HoloLens for a few minutes that you don't even think about the FOV any more because your subconscious is compensating it. I think that plus the fact that it's AR and not fully immersive, wraparound VR and the 3D sound helps out too."
HoloLens,3a2nrx,Shooob,2,Wed Jun 17 10:41:39 2015 UTC,That's a good point and says a lot about how good our eyes are at compensating but I hope MS isn't relying on that and are still on working on increasing the fov.
HoloLens,3a2nrx,ralexand56,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:32:41 2015 UTC,"Well if Magic Leap's version with Google Glass provides an opaque experience like in their demos and it's full 180 degrees, Hololens has some real competition.  Complaints about the FOV may encourage consumers to wait to see what Magic Leap has around the corner before laying down $500 to $1000 for new tech."
HoloLens,3a2nrx,solarfingers,3,Wed Jun 17 03:55:44 2015 UTC,Very true.  I have also been thinking that Microsoft plans to fix the FOV problem by version 2.0 and merge VR with Mixed reality but using the holograms.
HoloLens,3a2nrx,visgc,2,Wed Jun 17 06:31:55 2015 UTC,"Has there been anything to suggest Magic Leap's FoV?  Or any real information at all?  I'm guessing the 180 degrees was just hyperbole because anything over 90 has severe diminishing returns in AR.  Unless the peripheral vision is necessary for full immersion to keep from getting sick, I don't think there is much point in having digital items in my peripheral where I wouldn't notice them unless I forced myself to.   And Magic Leap has a lot more questions to answer than just opacity and surpassing hololens FoV.  The environment mesh mapping, pinning of digital objects, other holographic processing, known IPs, input,  key 3rd party commercial, software and hardware partnerships, and financial capital to launch required to market, produce, distribute, and support millions of units.    Competition is great, but magic leap has much to prove, starting with the 180 degree FoV"

HoloLens,3a1lmu,BeezyBates,2,Tue Jun 16 18:37:04 2015 UTC,"The game to watch out for is all board games. Tabletop games. They are about to get the biggest facelift of their existence. But I agree with you, simple turn based RPGs are a perfect fit."
HoloLens,3a1lmu,recardos777,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:23:09 2015 UTC,"Yes this is what I thought of as soon as I watched the demos and trailers for this device.  I imagine that if they do work on card games becoming 3D animations as you play them, they probably won't go as far as having the whole thing appear in your room.  I would guess that they would have the creatures (for example) come out of the card and have a basic attack animation for each.  Although some cool ideas I thought of would be if you were to play a field card in Yu-Gi-Oh.  Just think of the whole room filling up with lightning and destruction, depending on the card, around your opponent."

You then repel an invasion force or play vs someone else's fort.  Drone support: drone racing is becoming a big thing and most drone users are using fpv goggles (first person view) if you could keep your first person view and be able to see your drone in relation to you im sure drone enthusiasts would love it.  The dog is armed and dangerous: puts guns on your dog that shoot at you as you try to evade him. Some levels he will have a suicide vest and will explode if he gets too close. Throw the tennis ball to evade his attacks.  Personal jesus: carry around a little personal jesus and act as his father to enact your revenge on the world. Ants in your yard? Show them the wrath!

HoloLens,3a162l,Shooob,3,Tue Jun 16 12:54:50 2015 UTC,But you can't use a wireless Xbox controller with windows 10 without a special adapter and that hasn't even been released yet.

Its getting a little bit ridiculous at this point and starting to look like its just a marketing piece and not an actual product. Btw, windows 10 time frame can mean anything. Doesn't mean its coming out this year."
HoloLens,3a0oqj,ralexand56,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:01:34 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's going to be due out this year.  Windows 10 timeframe means in the time frame of Windows 10.  Windows 10 launches in July 29th and that time frame would end as of December 31st, 2015.  When a video game console launches and games come out for it, they will say ""in the launch time frame"".  It's the same thing.  Windows 10 is the last retail upgraded version of Windows, so there is no Windows 11.  Windows 10 will be upgraded in place.  So, let's say the 2016 upgrades come out, your Windows 10, will upgrade to the 2016 updates and that is all.  There is no Windows 11, 12, 13.  It's all upgraded in place.  So, the Windows 10 timeframe would be forever and that isn't logical.  The real answer is the Windows 10 ""release"" time frame which is until the end of 2015."

HoloLens,39xtf5,bestnicknameever,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"That was it from this morning's Xbox briefing, but there may be more throughout E3. Mike Gallagher told VentureBeat that Microsoft will have HoloLenses ""for people to try"" so that's something.  I've said it a few times today, but E3 is actually June 16-18. We're on ""Day 0"" right now. There's a daily Microsoft show at 4 PM PDT (7 PM EDT) today, tomorrow, and on the 17th. There's also all the events taking place during the day of E3 proper (see this schedule).  HoloLens has always been kept to the end of events. There are more AR/VR announcements yet to come out of E3.  If we don't get anything new today, I'm not sure what the next PR event will be. Perhaps the release of Windows 10 on July 29. For Minecraft specifically, there's Minecon on July 4-5. The Imagine Cup World Finals (July 27-31) this year will also be a HoloLens hackathon."

Considering they only bought Minecraft 9 months ago, to be able to integrate it with an unreleased product in a polished way is very impressive.  This is awesome for some obvious categories like CCG and tabletop games, but I'm curious how they'll leverage it beyond just a screen strapped to your face for other genres. I can't really imagine an FPS that is interactive or AR-based, but maybe I'll be surprised."

I was disappointed because we know MS is working on other games and with other game developers, so I'm disappointed that the only game experience they showed or even talked about was Minecraft.  Now that said, the Minecraft demo was just amazing. It's not quite what I was hoping, based on the reviews from the Jan 21 demo, but this ""tabletop version"" of Minecraft is still great and looks like it's going to be a lot of fun.  I hope there are more HoloLens announcements and demos at some point during E3. I don't have high hopes at this point though."
HoloLens,39xtf5,HaikusfromBuddha,0,Tue Jun 16 00:02:35 2015 UTC,Looks like gaming on it will be dead since devs have to create unique experiences for it. The only reason VR will do better is because they can Jerry rigg old games and make thw game play in first person.
HoloLens,39xtf5,Shooob,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:43:01 2015 UTC,"Because developers never try new technologies or go where the hype is? That's why the iPad was DOA, right? Also, you can't just ""Jerry rig"" an old game and suddenly it's VR-capable. It takes a huge amount of effort."

HoloLens,39z7zy,NashedPotatos,4,Mon Jun 15 23:58:40 2015 UTC,"Based on what we know at this point, there are two different solutions, depending on what you're trying to do. If your app is something that can simply be pinned to a wall (such as a video player, browser window, painting, etc) then you should look at developing a Windows Universal App. These can be written in either C# or HTML/JavaScript and will run as a ""window"" on the HoloLens that the user can ""pin"" to a wall, for example. If you're looking for a much more immersive experience, such as the Minecraft, Anatomy, Architecture, HoloPet demos, then start learning how to work with Unity and C# or C++ (but I recommend C# for beginner programmers). These are the apps that will give you the ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" feedback from your users, but will take time to get right."
HoloLens,39z7zy,Shooob,2,Tue Jun 16 01:19:03 2015 UTC,Start learning Unity3D. It can be used for much more than just games and they have a deal with Microsoft to support HoloLens soon. In the mean time you can learn plenty of important stuff that's not specific to AR.
HoloLens,39z7zy,ZenDragon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:35:34 2015 UTC,The thing about programming its not really hard to do but knowing makes things more compact.  Where a novice makes 20 lines of code an expert would use 2.    That being said coding is about questions.  Depending on the complexity you can google yourself to a working product.   There are coders for hire as well.  Ive seen guys make millions in a day from less than $5k spent on coders.

I waited there for 4.5 HOURS in a line at the start of the show with about 40 people in front of me order to try the Hololens and after 4.5 hours they said that was it for the day and they were not letting anyone else in. That was the whole reason why I went to E3~ and a completely wasted day.   They had minimal communication with the people in line. When we asked why the line was not moving until one Microsoft employee assured us that we would get to be able use the Hololens. An hour later to have another tell us here is a lanyard and too bad.

Also I believe they mentioned the feature during the //Build conference but didn't demo it.  Personally I think MS is downplaying that feature on purpose. One of the big jabs against Google Glass was the ability to record people in public without their knowledge. It was, and still is, a very controversial subject. This is another reason MS hasn't shown examples of the HoloLens in public environments. They want to make it very clear that they intend for the device to be used at home and work. This will help keep them from the bad press that Google Glass has received...at least until it's in our hands, then we'll have to see."
HoloLens,39y2p1,Shooob,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:51:41 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree with your line of thinking. I had the same question regarding the recording possibility. But I didn't capture the recording moment you're referring to - could you please share a link?

HoloLens,39v7i7,bestnicknameever,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:10:44 2015 UTC,Meaning a whole separate product similar to HoloLens?
HoloLens,39v7i7,Tojuro,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"I wondered if they'd go this route myself -- two separate products so you could tap into gaming/home users, but release a more expensive, capable and durable one for business use.        My guess is they won't do this, at first.     My theory is that the one truly compelling reason for an upscale product would be the ability to develop/deploy custom apps for it, and I don't think they'd want to cap people from using either headset from that.     Also, the FOV, tech-specs, etc, of this brand new product will be questioned, and you don't want to deliver a second rate product to most users.     I just don't see a clean way they could differentiate the products without alienating uses.    Most of the time when a product is split between pro & regular models, it's to set a baseline and drive more expensive purchases.  The actual differences are minimal for the cost of top models' extra components (think of paying 25% more for a product because it has double the internal memory).   I think that would be short-sighted at this point......in the future, definitely, but not now."

HoloLens,39v15l,hololeo,5,Mon Jun 15 00:57:21 2015 UTC,"It's very unlikely that you'll have a HoloLens hands-on demo during the Build tour. I don't believe there's been a HoloLens sighting since the main Build conference.  They will talk about the HoloLens, but none of the official conference materials go into further depth than we've already seen. I'd still say it's worth going, but don't expect too much on the holographic side. Your best bet for news will be hoping someone says more than they should. Of the people at LA, Jerry Nixon may be your best bet for HoloLens info, as I know he's tried it. You can try asking questions during the Q&A at the end.  From the Toronto event:   Joe Stegman made a comment about using the HoloLens in the ""holiday season"" during the keynote. It was possibly a joke; sort of hard to tell. He went ""off-script"" fairly often and had a bit of a quirky sense of humor, so I wouldn't read too much into it, but there was definitely a lot of murmuring in the crowd at that comment. Some people tried to get information about the HoloLens release date and opacity specs during the Q&A at the end. Vlad Kolesnikov was the go-to HoloLens guy at Toronto, and he seemed to be fighting not to reveal more than he was supposed to, particularly in response to a question about the ""state of AR in 18 months"". Again, I wouldn't read much into it. On the topic of opacity, Vlad said that it was something that was noticeable and something that should be considered in design, but not something that you really ought to be worried about from an experiential viewpoint. Someone also asked about whether Microsoft will suggest best practices or whether developers will have to fend for themselves. The answer to that is that Microsoft is of course working on best practices guides and those are already developed to some extent. There will be a recording of the Toronto event available at some point, although the news out of E3 in a couple days will likely overshadow any of the small snippets we can get out of the Build Tour. Although it was technically a recap of the main conference, some things stood out to me while seeing the presentations again. The demo given in the day 2 keynote shows a C++ code snippet that sets up left/right eye rendering for a 3D scene. What's interesting about that demo is that it shows how similar Holographic development is to standard 3D graphics work. The more relevant stuff for developers is the new input methods (speech/gesture) and there are talks and demos about those. They did give out sweet t-shirts with this Hololens-centric design."

HoloLens,39rf4m,ilovegoogleglass,7,Sun Jun 14 00:49:59 2015 UTC,"I really think that Microsoft is trying to make the Hololens as all in one device without peripherals.  They want users to just put it on and be done, not have to grab controllers.  Of course that doesn't preclude the fact that they COULD include them to create a deeper level of immersion with the AR. The Magic Leap concept video for that steampunk robot game showed the gamer having a prop gun in their hand as a controller, which makes more sense than using your finger as a gun."
HoloLens,39rf4m,sirdomino,2,Sun Jun 14 01:30:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, if Oculus touch comes to HoloLens it should foremost be a peripheral if anything."
HoloLens,39rf4m,Summons,2,Sun Jun 14 01:36:39 2015 UTC,"I think for true HoloLens focused app I would agree that they would prefer to stay away from controllers.  However, I think they ultimately need to support them directly on the HoloLens hardware.    The most obvious need would be to stream Xbox One games.  They said last week they plan to do this with OR.  It would be crazy to not do the same with HoloLens.  Other needs would be some niche manipulation or feedback needs.  Say something like these haptic gloves.  But that may be more appropriate for latter generations."
HoloLens,39rf4m,Larry_Mudd,2,Sun Jun 14 20:34:29 2015 UTC,"Oculus Touch looks great, but the design doesn't make much sense for Hololens, since the IRLED array used for tracking is designed to be seen by a camera in front of the user.  If you used Hololens' cameras, they would always be occluded, since they're on the wrong side of the controller.  I guess you could use the depth camera to rough in their approximate position (ie; most likely on the ends of your arms) but without bang on tracking I don't think they'd be as useful as something purpose-built."
HoloLens,39rf4m,Larry_Mudd,2,Mon Jun 15 05:21:24 2015 UTC,"It may seem like that at first glance but Oculus touch has top & side view IRLEDs as well. Also HoloLens has a 120° x 120° depth field of view, I'm sure HoloLens wouldn't have a hard time tracking them. We'll see tomorrow!   :)"
HoloLens,39mmnl,Summons,3,Fri Jun 12 20:30:37 2015 UTC,"I think Microsoft sees VR HMD's as a new form of computer monitor, and AR technology as a entirely new platform.     What it comes down to is that VR will just be used to consume slightly modified forms of existing media, while AR will completely change how we use computers.    This is why they are content having Oculus (and maybe even Vive and Morpheus) run on the Windows platforms (PC/Xbox/etc).     Let those players duke it out to provide the best/cheapest VR headset in a rough commodity market, just so long as they need Windows and the powerful API under the hood to drive them (DX12)."

Elite Dangerous already being one of them where menus are hanging in mid air around you in the cockpit and you activate then by looking at them. These popular games get a huge budget, have the most talented designers and are a great testbed for feedback from a large audience."

AR, by definition, is augmenting your reality, not replacing it with a virtual reality, no matter how nifty the menu system looks and feels. Elite: Dangerous is a great example of VR, not AR in a VR world. You could probably say that the menu system might be a great example of AR if you were actually in the cockpit of a spaceship. In the context of E:D it's simply a great use of 3D menus in a VR game that supports head tracking, not an example of AR."

When you can make a virtual screen anywhere in your real environment at any size in any number, what do you need a monitor for? The only rub is enabling other people to see your AR screens, but AR is still going to be better at that than VR.  They're both whole new platforms though. Both have potential for wildly innovative things no one has seen before and are going to have growing pains as everyone tries to figure out what we can do with this."
HoloLens,39mmnl,Blackstream,0,Mon Jun 15 07:26:20 2015 UTC,"I think you've got that backwards. AR is going to be the monitor replacement while VR is going to have the have specially made content. Just look at what both platforms are already being advertised for. VR is all about purposely build VR content like games or Google's new VR camera setup. Almost no one is talking about VR as a substitute for a monitor, and when they do it is portrayed as some utility app like a remote desktop instead of the main purpose of the device.  AR on the other hand seems more geared towards productivity by allowing you to bring the content normally displayed in apps into the real world. You see TV screens, weather, Skype and so on."
HoloLens,39mmnl,SplitReality,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:49:23 2015 UTC,"Let's examine the Holodeck on Star Trek.  What is it really?  In it's simplified form it is a dedicated room that creates Holograms (thus the name Holo), but it creates it in a ""virtual reality"" way.  Meaning it creates virtual reality using Holograms.  Now, the HoloLens uses Holograms to do Mixed reality, so it can do AR but if the FOV is wide enough it can also do VR.  That is the point, to get that FOV wild enough so that you will no longer notice.  It's one device that can eventually do both AR and VR depending on the game.  My ""HOPE"" is that by 2017, Microsoft will bring out HoloLens 2.0 and that will have a bigger field of view (FOV) and better battery life to fight against the other VR guys, but while offering AR as well.   This is the future standard with AR and VR in one HMD. Whoever has this first will the best content will win.  My ""HOPE"" is that Microsoft understands this and is working towards this, but we don't know at the moment.  We do know that Hololens is using ""Mobile components"" and those will obviously get better over time and which is why I see Hololens getting updated every two years or so."

So, the Windows 10 ""timeframe"" could be from July 29th to however long Windows is used (a year, a decade, eternity?).  If they meant ""within the Windows 10 release timeframe"", now that would be different, and can probably narrow it down to ""sometime this year"".

HoloLens,39aeb4,tsujiku,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:47:47 2015 UTC,"My assumption is that there is a middleman built into the OS that a developer can interface with to render their applications without giving the developer full access to all of the cameras and sensors.  So, you don't need to give an application permission to see everything in your workspace/house/etc for that app to render holograms.  This seems necessary to me if they want the hololens to have an app store ecosystem. Without it, you would have to put a lot of trust in each and every app you download that they aren't doing anything privacy-breaking with the sensor data."

The problem that I have heard is that the Hololens doesn't cover your entire field of view, so if you stretch it too large, it is just going to look cut off. That was with a test version, though. We don't know what the final product will be like yet."
HoloLens,3917iw,root88,5,Mon Jun 8 17:11:58 2015 UTC,"HoloLens is capable of locking a layout directly in front of you.  So whatever those FOV limitations are, locking it would take advantage of your full FOV without cutting it off.  You probably would want this movie/video view locked when your watching it for an extended period of time."
HoloLens,3917iw,Summons,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:43:08 2015 UTC,"Let's say that the Hololens projects in the middle third of your FOV. You could easily scale a video much larger than that.

The demo I tried was a space ship shooting game that shots lasers where you look. Imagine a grid of 10 by 10 (?) and when you look close to one of grid, it snaps into place and shoots laser at that point. I rotated by eye in circular motion and device had no problem tracking my eye movement. However, it was hard to tell how accurate the tracking was because laser was snapping to pre determined grids."

HoloLens,38ykao,solarfingers,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:29:40 2015 UTC,I think this technology would help Hololens because eye tracking on the Hololens would be really cool.
HoloLens,38ykao,squeakeel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:28:01 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the problem is that Hololens is designed to exploit the fact that your eye doesn't have clear vision all around, and gets weaker the farther from the source.  Hololens does this probably to reduce graphics loads on the GPU inside.  If they put eye-tracking on Hololens, Microsoft would get complaints of poor graphics quality around the sides.  Though this would be a cool addition, it would be for a later model."

HoloLens,38wmed,hololeo,10,Sun Jun 7 17:50:23 2015 UTC,"Meta intends to sell the consumer version including an i5 processor and battery pack for somewhere around $3600 (yes, that's three thousand six hundred, not a typo; the $660 kit may be a better deal if you already have a computer you can stick in a backpack and don't mind the lackluster devkit optics).  Price aside, it seems to work reasonably well, although reviewers have noted the alpha software seems buggy (as you'd expect of an alpha) and the optics of the developer kit have been compared unfavorably to ODG's smart glasses (by Gigaom).  The developer kit has two hoods/lenses: one that provides a 23-degree FOV and one with a 32-degree FOV. The consumer product is expected to have a respectable 40-degree FOV (though VR enthusiasts would still likely say that that is tiny).  Personally, I think the Meta glasses are most lacking on the software side. I really think Meta/CastAR/Atheer need to embrace the Windows Holographic APIs, unless they are locked into a competing agreement with another major AR platform (i.e. Google/Magic Leap or Apple/Metaio).  Additional sources:   Gigaom: For $3,000, Meta’s augmented reality glasses provide a look at the future  Tom's Guide: I Am Iron Man: My Time with the Meta 1 AR Glasses Sydney Morning Herald: Hands on with Meta Pro, the futuristic augmented reality glasses Gigaom: ODG just set the new bar for augmented reality"

HoloLens,38wmed,grannyte,2,Sun Jun 7 17:17:13 2015 UTC,Meta announced their device about a year (IIRC) after the Oculus Rift. Well before HoloLens. I think most people just dismissed it pretty quickly since AR is a hard problem and they had lofty ambitions.   I think the crucial difference is that HoloLens has a dedicated holographic processor and Microsoft has access to next gen sensor hardware where is meta is mostly off the shelf. Not to mention access to massive amounts of funding.

HoloLens,38qr5l,Boulderado,3,Sat Jun 6 00:43:47 2015 UTC,"I'd go with Unity, as it allows developing for all major AR/VR hardware. If possible, try to go with C# instead of Unity Javascript, as C# is faster and most of the code example on the Internet are with C#. And it's not that hard anyways, plus, monodevelop has very good code completition for it.   I started Unity development about 9 months ago; I've got 15+ years of experience developing with PHP, Javascript, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. and from the coding point of view the transition has been easy. Unity (and 3D world itself) brough a bunch of other stuff to learn like 3D modeling, texturing, applying textures to 3D models and so forth.   With Unity, you can start developing already, without Windows 10 or without Hololens.   I dunno if Hololens supports Unreal Engine, but maybe have a look at that too."
HoloLens,38qr5l,bLaind2,2,Sat Jun 6 08:47:11 2015 UTC,"If you program in Javascript, transition to C# should be no problem... The greatest skill you will need is to believe in yourself.  Dive in, test the waters and swim to the deep end.  There is no try in success.  There is only do... just do it."
HoloLens,38qr5l,solarfingers,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:56:10 2015 UTC,Except for the syntax I wouldn't say that C and JS are very similar. But if you ever programmed in any language you can learn C# relatively easy.
HoloLens,38qr5l,Kredo374,2,Tue Jun 16 18:25:21 2015 UTC,"More important than the language is your knowledge of interactivity, something that many will forget to consider completely. You can't just know how to program and start making apps for anything you please, that's how you end up with poorly designed apps for iOS, Android, Windows, etc. It's why you end up with horrible to use applications used in Enterprise settings too most likely.  User Interaction and Experience is very important. Start learning about VR UI, how you shouldn't overlay things on the screen (make them real world objects instead), etc. Yes HoloLens isn't VR, but the same premise applies."

HoloLens,38qr5l,ChronoChris,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:46:59 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue you are going to have is Coding for Windows 10 Universal Apps, I couldn't imagine creating a windows 10 universal app in Javascript but it is possible...  That being said, everything you know makes you a good candidate, if your Javascript is on point. You will need to learn Unity 5.0.1f1 on Windows 10 and make Windows Universal Apps with Visual Studio 2015 RC. All of these are free right now.   I don't see any database experience, but I'm sure you will want your app to store information in some shape. So this might be another barrier  If your laptop can run the specs for windows 10, you can develop Hololens projects.  So, if your javascript isn't up to snuff.

The non-Unity apps might be limited as floating windows I suspect.  From what I've seen at Build, they seemed to imply if you want make the fully featured applications you saw in the demos you will have to program in Unity and C#.  I highly doubt your going to see 3D modeling being done in JavaScript.  While XAML 3D has been done in the past, there hasn't been any indication that will be supported directly for HoloLens."
HoloLens,38qr5l,tsujiku,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:34:40 2015 UTC,"Surely they will have a closer-to-the-metal developer experience, no?  What about working in DirectX directly? I believe DirectX is supported for Universal Apps, I imagine they would offer some solution utilizing that, rather than having to go through Unity.  My guess is that Unity is offered as an option, since it's fairly easy to get up and running using it, but I don't think it would be the only option for HoloLens apps."
HoloLens,38qr5l,Summons,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:01:20 2015 UTC,"One would hope there would be multiple ways to develop full featured HoloLens apps.  However, the experience people had at  with the Holographic Academy demo at Build proved that Unity is the only available option currently.  They haven't implied that other options exist yet.

Might br dangerous, but it turns out to be more precise than HoloLens. And why? HoloLens, as said by many demo testers, has a limited field of view for its holograms, some sort of square or rectangle, just like a screen. While they stick to that rectangle with their lens being lightened and having images being formed on it, Magic Leap tells us they're making our eyes be the screen. I'm looking forward to this. And, also, competition to HoloLens SHOULD be mentioned. It makes the developers more uneased and gives them a competitive attitude.

Or am I right in assuming the click is based on being able to see the object in your field of view?   If you're using the HoloLen's ""AirTap"" as a click, selection is based on gaze, so the hologram would have to be centered in your field of view. If you're using a mouse or alternative input device to click, the hologram could in theory be anywhere. It'd be a bit weird selecting objects you couldn't see, but I think it will be possible because if you were to click an object and look away from it, the mouse cursor should still be actively dragging the ""off-screen"" object.   Also Imagine there is a cube in front of you. Would I be able to flick each side of the cube from either direction and make it move to the opposite side .

It is a fairly obvious feature for the device to have, but it depends on having high-quality hand tracking, and so far the HoloLens demos have conspicuously not shown off any hand tracking features beyond recognition of predefined gestures.  I think the HoloLens should be capable of this sort of interaction given the demos we've seen with Leap Motion, Intel RealSense, and Kinect devices, but it remains to be seen."
HoloLens,3892ga,BI_Joe,2,Tue Jun 2 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"Yea I agree with you , hopefully more will be revealed at e3"
HoloLens,3892ga,justbrowsingtoo,2,Tue Jun 2 20:24:56 2015 UTC,"If you look at microsoft's official website for the hololens hardware, it has the picture of the sensors.  http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us/hardware  It looks like the cameras are on the front.  So if it can't sense it, it probably will not know if you are doing anything off to the side."
HoloLens,385pyp,hololeo,4,Tue Jun 2 01:13:32 2015 UTC,Very cool but you still have an issue of where you put the chip. Seems like they are targeting hololens being a self contained unit and if you have to put that chip on the hololens itself then it doesn't have any real advantage over a actual button or touchscreen surface.

HoloLens,385pyp,ralexand56,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:04:31 2015 UTC,"True, but I think we need to think about HoloLens as PC while mouse / keyboard / gamepad or other peripherals are needed to interact with it."
HoloLens,385pyp,GrzegorzWidla,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:15:26 2015 UTC,True but I think MS is focused on it being considered a standalone unit that use gaze and a finger gesture as a mouse click.
HoloLens,385pyp,ralexand56,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:50:30 2015 UTC,It'd make a difference since the only way to click on HoloLens is like a mouse left-click except for the pointer being your eyes.
HoloLens,385pyp,TemoKun,4,Tue Jun 2 02:50:55 2015 UTC,"Or you can use a mouse, which they've demonstrated a few times."
HoloLens,385pyp,Shooob,3,Tue Jun 2 10:28:27 2015 UTC,"Might be redundant.  The HoloLens sensors detect hand/finger movement to handle the gestures.  However, you have to have your hands high enough for the sensors to pick it up.    I could only see a need for this if the HoloLens sensors are not accurate enough for tiny movements or you need to read the gestures outside of the HoloLens sensor range."

HoloLens,37wqh6,BI_Joe,5,Sun May 31 01:10:26 2015 UTC,Excellent article. Agreed that the most encouraging thing is the fact that they were able to get an acceptable fov in one of the prototypes which suggests that the optics can be solved.

HoloLens,37wqh6,YoungAndHungry,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:20:18 2015 UTC,"I think the limitation is not in the lens. The FOV limit regards to lens is when you draw a line from your pupil to the edge of the lens (theoretically), so the placement of the lens also affect FOV. The FOV can be big. Well, big enough.  The limitation lies in how fast the light can be generated. That's key."
HoloLens,37wqh6,seanleith,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:58:27 2015 UTC,"The FOV limit regards to lens is when you draw a line from your pupil to the edge of the lens (theoretically)   That's not really the case. The edge of the lens is an extreme upper bound; clearly, images aren't going to be shown beyond the edge of the lens. However, even getting the image to the edges of the lens is very non-trivial, for the reasons described in the OP.   There's no light source in the lenses. Showing an image in them requires transporting that light through the lenses and reflecting it out at very precise angles and that's a challenging task for the optics.  I really doubt rendering speed is the main bottleneck. You don't even need to render anything for most of the scene, since it's just see-through. The hard part (environmental sensing and tracking) is being done with 120° by 120° sensors and the dedicated HPU."
HoloLens,37toou,__Julia,4,Sat May 30 08:25:25 2015 UTC,"There's lot of stuff going on with the HoloLens, so it depends what aspect you're interested in.  Some of the main concepts are:   3D computer graphics. This isn't specific to holographic technology, but if you want to develop programs for the HoloLens or understand the basics of how images are created, this is probably the most important thing to know. I recommend this free Udacity course. The optics of see-through displays. There's a lot of speculation around how the HoloLens display itself works. Basic concepts in optics such as refraction and Snell's law, total internal reflection, diffraction, virtual images, and collimation are all relevant as are many others. There are many issues here: transporting light in front of the user's eyes, having the light be in focus when it hits the pupils, keeping the screen in front of the eyes transparent and the image-forming device out of the line of sight, being able to portray dark virtual images while keeping the transparent passive screen, etc. I've been planning on writing a post about this for a while. One of these days... Depth-sensing. The depth-sensing technology used by HoloLens can be thought of as an evolution of the Kinect technology. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). SLAM is an algorithm that forms a map of an environment while also figuring out where you are in that map. It's the basis for the HoloLens's ability to track its position and hence keep all the holograms positioned relative to the environment. There are lots of cool videos of SLAM implementations on YouTube."

Be aware that there's a lot of speculation here so take some of it with a grain of salt; we don't have any official specs from MS."
HoloLens,37toou,Shooob,1 point,Sat May 30 12:49:50 2015 UTC,"There are two aspects, hardware and software... The software is written to overlay a projection onto special film on the glasses with holographic (3D) images. This film reflects the image back to your eye. The trick to the hardware is in using a number of sensors to determine what you are looking at and the distance of surfaces in the room.  All of this is done to create the illusion of real objects existing in view of the glasses.  That's it in a nutshell... for a in-depth explanation you can Google around and find some good discussions... for example: http://forums.windowscentral.com/microsoft-hololens/336812-depth-analysis-whats-inside-hololens.html"

The purchase of Metaio is an effort to do some major catchup in the area of AR.  They probably have a line on some alternative technology or have something hidden in their dungeons... On any hand they will have a difficult job doing catchup when Microsoft, followed by Magic Leap take the larger part of this trending market.  The good news is that all this competition will force down prices and innovation will drive sales..."
HoloLens,37qfp7,TheTechTheorist,5,Sat May 30 05:09:52 2015 UTC,"One comment: Metaio is big, I will admit.  Apple could use the patents, tech and engineers for AR from Metaio.  But Metaio isn't what Microsoft is doing with Hololens.  It would be for AR on tablets and whatnot, which frankly is child's play compared to Hololens.  Apple simply can't compete with Hololens with the Metaio acquisition.  It may help Apple with AR, but Metaio is putting stuff on a 2D screen, not creating 3D images in the real world."
HoloLens,37qfp7,Summons,1 point,Sat May 30 00:46:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I think software like this can be easily adapted to AR devices.  The applications they could of made for HoloLens may have been top notch.  Now they are going to be prevented from doing that.  I suspect Apple has something intended for them other then 2D tablet/phone applications.  Have they supported Magic Leap in anyway?"
HoloLens,37qfp7,TheTechTheorist,2,Sat May 30 14:37:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe I wasn't clear. Apple will get a major boost in AR from Metaio, yes, stalling competition a bit and getting more tech.  But when the title says ""iPhone meets HoloLens:  Apple Acquires Augmented Reality Company To Compete With Microsoft"", that is way out of proportion.  Unless Apple was working on a HoloLens level product (not just 2D AR) for years, Apple will not win the AR war, much less compete just by buying Metaio.  Still, you bring up a good point of killing off HoloLens developers."
HoloLens,37qfp7,Shooob,1 point,Sat May 30 15:23:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with the first part. At this point, MS, and supposedly Google (Magic Leap), built devices that apparently display very high quality images, that has taken years and millions of dollars of R&D. If Apple wants to compete in this world, they're going to have to do the same. Releasing something along the same lines and quality of the Moverio isn't an option any more.  I disagree about the Apple purchase losing HoloLens developers however. There are hardcore Apple developers, no doubt, but the majority of app developers go to the device that's the most popular at that moment. HoloLens already has the hype to be the most popular AR device when it's released. Even if Apple releases the Metaio SDK for the iPad, it's going to be overshadowed by the HoloLens."

At this point, we don't know what MS is thinking and where they're heading. Personally, I don't think they'll release in July.

Not just people who want AR for personal use, but if they can lock in business users it will definitely be a big win for them.   If hololens comes out, looks good, and Magic Leap is still just vaporware then I'll probably buy a hololens and get so locked in by owning certain apps, etc... it would be too painful to switch even if the magic leap offering is a bit better."

MS is more interested in selling copies of Windows 10 than they are in selling the HoloLens hardware.  As I recall from /Build they fully expect, and hope for, additional hardware providers.  So, if Magic Leap runs off Windows 10, then you wouldn't be locked into any apps.  Now, the big question is will Android be adding in the APIs needed for AR, and if so Magic Leap will probably be bound to use Android over Windows due to Google's investment.

Yeah, it's cheap and started as basically a joke, but it's by far the most accessible form of VR at the moment.  The Expeditions software and Jump camera setup that they showed are both interesting, and I like that they're working on developing content. Open standards for Web VR are going to be important in getting applications that run across all of the competing HMDs and I hope Google moves in that direction (instead of sticking with a proprietary Android/iPhone app)."

HoloLens,37ff1t,Shooob,1 point,Thu May 28 19:55:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not that familiar with Metaio but it looks like they didn't have a HMD so I would guess that they're going for the SDK & AR experience of the employees themselves, that is if they don't lay everyone off. This is probably the first of many acquisitions to come for Apple as they scramble to catch up to MS & Google/Magic Leap."
HoloLens,37ff1t,BI_Joe,2,Thu May 28 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I believe Metaio was purely software, which is interesting as Apple will certainly want to have their own hardware. They may try to get in on AR through software on their mobile OSes (holographic iPad / iPod support) before an HMD.  Apple does seem to be playing catch up at the moment, though their smartphone experience should help a lot because smartphone tech is driving HMD tech. And with them making this move now, before the release of HoloLens or Magic Leap, they won't be all that far behind (though I hope they don't somehow usurp credit for inventing or popularizing AR). Or they could reveal iGoggles tomorrow, for all we know.  On the flipside, Metaio may have seen the writing on the wall after the reveal of Windows Holographic. It'd be difficult for them to stay competitive on Windows when the main features of their product become a core part of the OS."

Alright, for the first one, he kinda just gave the standard ""Hey, everything works well"" review, I didn't hear a lot of interesting stuff there.  The second one was a bit more interesting, he talked about the Developer Workshop with Unity. The first half was again, stuff you can find really easily in English, but I picked up a few details that I didn't know before: 1) HoloLens connects to the computer via USB for immediate deployment from Unity. 2) HoloLens remains pretty comfortable when worn with glasses on. Then at the end, he talked more about spatial sound and Minecraft (independently), but that's nothing new.  The third guy had a One on One where he did a lot with HoloStudio. When asked if the user interaction felt natural, he said that it was slightly difficult in the beginning to control things with his eyes, but after a few minutes, he got used to it. After that, he said something interesting about what he thinks to be the most astounding feature, but I couldn't quite understand enough to translate - something about positioning in the real world? At the end, he complained about the FOV, saying it was only about 110-120 degrees, but other than that, amazing."

Those measurements are taken diagonally across the entire FOV. Most other AR devices currently available have FOVs under 35° (the Epson Moverio has a FOV of 23°; Google Glass was something like 17°). People have estimated the HoloLens FOV at anywhere from 20° to 120°. It's kind of ridiculous."

HoloLens,36nmq3,BI_Joe,4,Wed May 20 21:38:14 2015 UTC,The ramification for this tech might be the biggest reveal since the hololens reveal. The question is does the tech create a high res polygonal model or is it just displaying a series of images. If its the latter than the hololens would not have to have a high end gpu to display 3d objects that exceed the quality of current polygonal based rendering. I assume this is how they created the hologram of the guy from the January reveal.
HoloLens,36nmq3,ralexand56,3,Wed May 20 21:40:04 2015 UTC,"The question is does the tech create a high res polygonal model or is it just displaying a series of images.   The answer is probably neither of the above (with the usual disclaimer that I'm not affiliated with Microsoft and may not know what I'm talking about).  This isn't just two 2D videos played back to give a stereoscopic effect; the viewer can see the model from any angle (as shown in the reveal demo with the Terry Myerson hologram) which would not be possible if the hologram was just a stereoscopic video recording.  On the other hand, holographic video could be thought of as a series of three dimensional images. The three-dimensional analogue of a bitmap image would be something like a point cloud. At first glance, a high-resolution point cloud would seem to require far more processing power than a polygon model, but all the lighting in the video would effectively be pre-computed and there's no simulation involved, so this probably could display pretty complex geometry.  The model could also be represented by a standard mesh and still benefit from pre-computed lighting and movement. The usual trade-offs apply: pre-computing information leads to larger files and higher-fidelity images, while real-time processing can create more dynamic effects with smaller input files but requires more computing power.  Edit: After more consideration, representing an animated 3D model with a point cloud or voxel approach seems highly improbable. We're probably talking about fairly conventional meshes here, though that doesn't change any of the above (or below) conversation."
HoloLens,36nmq3,BI_Joe,5,Wed May 20 22:08:37 2015 UTC,Check out the SIGGRAPH 2015 technical paper teaser video.  I think that implies you'll get a lot more information in a few more months.

HoloLens,36nmq3,calrathan,3,Thu May 21 05:44:10 2015 UTC,"God, I love SIGGRAPH. Everything in that video is pure awesome.  Based on the teaser, it looks like the video is constructed starting from a slightly sparse point cloud, which is smoothed/filled in, and converted to a mid/low resolution mesh with a high resolution normal map. I look forward to seeing the details of this. I've never been so impressed by jiggling fat before."
HoloLens,36nmq3,BI_Joe,1 point,Thu May 21 06:11:53 2015 UTC,Love the fact that it is polygonal mesh since that can allow for more interaction vs. taking many images from multiple angles. This solves one of the major hurdles that I believed would be near impossible to do this early concerning creating compelling photorealistic 3d content for a device like this. 3d AR/VR movies are all of sudden possible now without relying on rendering a video to a flat plane and automatically adjusting the face of the polygon to face the user viewing the content like they used to do in videogames.

HoloLens,36nmq3,ralexand56,2,Fri May 22 17:10:28 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, thanks! With this technique, would a user be able to control the character let's say if you wanted it to raise its hand due to user input?"
HoloLens,36nmq3,ralexand56,2,Wed May 20 22:36:29 2015 UTC,"This is a bit of a tricky question to answer, but let me unpack it into a few simpler cases:   If we're talking strictly about a single 3D video (defined to be a series of 3D images played over time), then no, you won't be able to control a character in the video. The video is non-interactive by definition, but that's not a very interesting answer. If we had a bunch of 3D videos, we could start doing interactive stuff. One (naive) approach is to have different clips for different actions and cut between the clips to show different actions. This is the ""choose your own adventure"" approach to interactivity and it has some obvious limitations as you can't combine animations easily, transitions between animations are tricky, and authoring this content to transition seamlessly is tough, but it's something. An improvement on the previous suggestion is to cut up the video of the character into separate body parts. You could have video clips of the character's body from the neck down separate from video clips of the head, for instance. That would allow clips of different facial animations and spoken lines to be triggered independently of what the body is doing. Separating video clips into pieces like that could be a challenge, but it is possible. However, there are still problems: individual parts still have problems transitioning between actions (each animation would need to return to a resting state to avoid a jump) and the final composite hologram runs the risk of looking like a collage instead of a proper render. With pre-rendered lighting, the apparent light sources for holographic videos would appear to move with them. With lots of moving holographic videos, this would look unnatural. Could a holographic video / animated point cloud be lit in real-time? Well... yes, but then you'd lose the advantages of it being a video. There's no free lunch: accurate, real-time lighting of complex models is going to be computationally intensive, period. The last thing to consider is that it this isn't all-or-nothing. You can combine pre-rendered parts with dynamically-rendered parts. This has been a staple of computer graphics for ages, and holograms won't change that. In that short video clip we have of this talk, Steve Sullivan mentioned something about changing the eyeline of a recorded person for a game. I took that to mean that you could overlay a model of an eyeball on top of the 3D video to control where the character was looking."
HoloLens,36nmq3,BI_Joe,1 point,Wed May 20 23:23:27 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm, very interesting. Thanks! I assume this technique would also work for inanimate objects but they tend to be less computationally intensive so probably less need for it in those cases."
HoloLens,36nmq3,ralexand56,1 point,Wed May 20 23:33:41 2015 UTC,"I should stress that the last bullet point above is by far the most important. There will undoubtedly be a ton of tricks used to optimize hologram graphics and there's a huge continuum between trivial lighting models and photorealism.  Increased interactivity generally requires more processing, which is why a lot of interactive rendering techniques fudge effects. If you've ever heard of baking a normal map or using an environment map for reflections, those are examples of techniques that approximate tough real-time calculations with pre-calculated data. (If you're not familiar with these, baking a normal map allows models to be colored in a way that makes them look like they have more polygons than they actually do, meanwhile reflection maps allow models to appear shiny by simulating the reflection of a single image instead of accurately reflecting the actual 3D scene).  All conventional 3D graphics techniques should port over to HoloLens. The main difference is that the hardware acceleration of the GPU will be supplemented by the HPU, though the functionality of the HPU is not entirely known and it seems to be focused mostly on the input and tracking side of things."

HoloLens,36kbxd,ilovegoogleglass,2,Wed May 20 03:12:13 2015 UTC,"Didn't initially see the appeal but now that I think about it, this could make some killer story book sessions with the kids having a different monster or character appear at every page turn. This could obviously extend to all genres of books. History books that display historical sites, self help books with animated diagrams of key concepts. One thing is clear with this new tech is that content creation is going to get a lot more expensive and time consuming."

HoloLens,36hh50,seeeel,7,Tue May 19 12:41:15 2015 UTC,"Autodesk announced partnership with HoloLens at Build, so I think autoCAD will be supported down the road. As HoloLens is self contained device, no other sensors are needed."
HoloLens,36hh50,Genesis_Prime,3,Tue May 19 13:11:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, they did announce a partnership, but the focus is on 3D printing and expediting that process I'm more interested in whether or not Autodesk Revit and other Architecture software will be compatible.

You folks are wayyy overdue for some new shiny toys.  side note, I'm curious to see how some of your software will display on the hololens as the software I've seen for architecture/building plans are very very bloated.  (took 5+mins to load up plans)"
HoloLens,36hh50,holonames,4,Tue May 19 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"But architecture/building plans are basically ""compiled/rendered"" in real time (for example, like when you try to export a video in a different format; it takes much longer to export a video then to run it when it's exported) If the app or game is compiled already the execution will be quick."

I could see this working well for games with in-app purchases.   Things like Tamagotchi-like, Pokemon-like or Farmville games which are based on in-app purchases to buy something might work very well.   My theory here being that ""owning"" something like a virtual pet (or cow on the farm) would seem more valuable if it could ""exist"" in your house.    What will be interesting is to see the limits of ad-based content.   So, if you are running an ad-based app, can it put an ad for Coke on your refrigerator?    Can there be ads?  Can the ads be disconnected from the app?    What will they allow you to do with ads, and what will people accept?"

Like if you're tapped into weather API, you have to pay for each call (I forget the exact number) but change your price as a result.  How do the comparable apps price themselves?  If you're aiming to be the luxury version of the similar apps, price higher, but make sure you're fancier.  If you're the budget version, lower pricing."

But MSFT will probably integrate that functionality, we will see. I will probably try to add the gesture recognition as well, but you need quick reactions for an action game and a press of a key or a tap on the screen of your mobile phone/tablet is a microfraction of the time you need to move your whole hand/arm. Not talking about the fatigue of your limbs after a 30 minutes of an intense action unless you are playing a holo aerobics or something ;D"
HoloLens,36aoeo,kryptomena,2,Mon May 18 09:13:47 2015 UTC,"It started like this... Seriously, developing action games for HoloLens (except casual games) that you play for more than 30 minutes will be pain in the ass without an Xbox or other controller or a keyboard or yout mobile/tablet for the tap control.

HoloLens,36aoeo,undeadalex,2,Sun May 24 10:59:44 2015 UTC,You have more inputs than just tap/pinch (the same gesture really)   Gaze - placing a cursor in the game by looking at it Tap - taps the gazed object Voice - recognizes the voice very well   Probably gonna be additionally * Gesture for Start menu (bringing hand up and opening it)
HoloLens,36aoeo,sala91,1 point,Mon May 18 10:48:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by limiting on the gestures.  As far as I can tell, tapping is like clicking a mouse and pinching is like holding down the left mouse button.  Perhaps we need a right-click gesture, but other than that, it should be fine.  As for the lever, you could probably trick it into thinking your ""grabbing a lever"" is really ""Pinching the end of the lever."""

There is a delay between the camera picking up the world the processing and rendering so the processed output image must be rendered for the future speculating where the user will be looking. If you notice in the demos the objects pretty much do not move at all.

HoloLens,366yj6,weeeeezy,1 point,Mon May 18 17:42:34 2015 UTC,"One interesting thing to note is that the Russian stop on the tour is a multi-track conference (http://www.msdevcon.ru) and not a one-day mini-event. The schedule of that conference doesn't show any HoloLens-specific content though.  Given all their security precautions, I wonder if Microsoft would even be willing to let a HoloLens prototype leave the country. In addition to concerns over leaks, the HoloLens is a prime target for industrial espionage.  ...they should at least bring it to Canada though. Please? I promise we won't steal it."
HoloLens,366yj6,BI_Joe,0,Tue May 19 00:21:13 2015 UTC,I am curious if they will have anything relating to HoloLens at the event.
HoloLens,366yj6,Genesis_Prime,1 point,Sat May 16 23:22:21 2015 UTC,"that has already been confirmed. I think Kipman even mentioned, that they will take plenty of those demo devices on tour for everyone to try out."
HoloLens,366yj6,bestnicknameever,3,Sun May 17 08:41:14 2015 UTC,"It hasn't really been confirmed. Kipman mentioned ""several events over the summer"" in ""Microsoft lofts"". I would not expect to get hands-on time with the HoloLens during the Build tour. Would love to be wrong on this though.  Edit: The schedule of the events has been updated. They have the keynote followed by a universal windows platform session, followed by a web session, followed by lightening talks, followed by a panel q&a. Note that each stop on the tour is a one day event. It'd be awesome if they ran a HoloLens academy on the side, but there's not a whole lot of time for it."
HoloLens,366yj6,BI_Joe,3,Sun May 17 14:10:48 2015 UTC,"If they are under the same security I saw at the BUILD conference, I'd say its unlikely everyone would get a chance to try it.  They locked down an entire floor of a hotel and had about 40-60 people working the floor just to handle about 15+ people trying out the 4 or 5 different HoloLens experiences over 3 days.  They would have to scale that down dramatically to have it in the same building, which would mean very few would get a shot at it in one day.    The prep for using the HoloLens required an eye distance check to, something I cant see them doing for even quick hands on for a large crowd.  I'd expect they would at least be doing demo's similar to what we saw in the keynote."
HoloLens,366jrd,ChronoChris,6,Sat May 16 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"As a consumer, I'll postpone my judgement until final product has been revealed or until I try on the product myself. However, if I was a developer, I would never say never. I believe Hololens will eventually take off and that only thing that is holding it back is processing power and battery capacity.   When it does takeoff, as a developer, you want to be there at forefront ready to make and launch an app, or at least be ready with an idea for an app."
HoloLens,366jrd,Genesis_Prime,6,Sat May 16 18:01:21 2015 UTC,"A total deal breaker for me is judging it based off of first generation of portable hardware that isn't finished yet.   The casing is finished, but the hardware and software are still not ready yet.  This is going to be released by end-of-year 2015, and it's May.   Please keep that in mind.   They manufactured only 100 sets, if it was all ready they would have manufactured a lot more than that.  It was only meant for build and that was all.  You are correct the field of view is small and that is how it existed at BUILD, but BUILD is a long way from release.  They will start manufacturing these things probably by late August or very early September based on history.  That is a long way off from the beta version that we saw end of April.   I think it's great to keep your expectations low, but let's not go off the deep-end here.  Microsoft is aware of the issue as so many people commented on it, that it's hard to not notice the obvious.   It's a work in progress.  Did you know that the development kits for the Xbox 360 were using Desktop mac machines?  Yes, that is right.  Desktop Mac PowerPC machines as the development kits for the Xbox 360 (A Microsoft Product).   So, let's keep our expectations in check, but also lets not go crazy, if you don't want to make money on building software someone else will.   That is how the world works.  Someone takes risks and invests time and energy into something and someone else won't and lose out."
HoloLens,366jrd,SimpleWireFree,-1,Sat May 16 23:40:10 2015 UTC,"I'm expressing that, a small field of vision, is just a total deal breaker, I wouldnt have showed any product at build if the results were what they showed. If that's the product they release it's game over. I'm well aware of some changes can come out. This was meant as an ultimatum for sure. I have high expectations regardless of where you want me to set them. If they have to release a helmet, or a PC that does all the processing in the house, so be it."
HoloLens,366jrd,SimpleWireFree,7,Sun May 17 00:18:45 2015 UTC,"It's an ultimatum for what exactly?  I mean if you don't make software for it, someone else will like I explained.  All it means is that you lose out of having money and someone else grabs it.  For example, we have heard in podcasts that even though the FOV was extremely limited at first, after awhile your brain stopped focusing on it and went along it's merry way.  The brain can adjust eventually.   I am not saying it doesn't matter, but I am saying why worry about it?  If it's as big as it was in January upon release (which is what I believe) or it's smaller, either way your brain will eventually adapt.  We will find out more at E3 and I am looking forward to it.  However, I am not going to say that an unfinished product is unfinished because it is, what it is."
HoloLens,366jrd,stesch,3,Sun May 17 02:00:59 2015 UTC,I'm waiting until E3 before I have a real opinion about it.
HoloLens,366jrd,skralogy,-4,Sat May 16 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"I will continue to Learn Unity, 3d development, and Windows Universal until then. But Microsoft needs to understand, this is a total deal breaker, if they need to release a helmet, or a product that is 2000 dollars, so be-it. The crap they demoed at build is worthless."
HoloLens,366jrd,SimpleWireFree,2,Sat May 16 23:51:17 2015 UTC,"Microsoft knows, most people who have heard of the hololens and have been interested in it knows. When they first demoed it the hololens had a much wider fov. Microsoft is probably toying with the idea on how to tweak the look and form factor to make the fov as wide as possible.   It is also entirely possible that absolutely no one knows what they are talking about with this technology. A year ago it was only a science experiment and Google glass was a completely different idea and use.  We may not know what it takes to produce the fov we need or want and we also don't know the downsides of using a larger fov at this time.   So sit back and wait, one of the only companies in the world that currently develops this technology is aware of the problems it has and is certainly not saying "" well this thing is stupid, let's just stick it in a box and sell this crap. So if you have any faith in Microsoft just let them work their magic."
HoloLens,366jrd,holonames,2,Sat May 16 19:34:38 2015 UTC,"Let me explain something that you guys may not be aware of.  In January, the FOV for the HoloLens was bigger, correct?  Well, a version of that January HoloLens is a Development Kit, that all the developers will have in their possession with that larger field of view.    Don't you wonder why Microsoft has not released the specs other than the FOV for the depth camera?  So, all of the games and software are being made with that original FOV in January, it's not going to be like what I want which is a 110 field of view, that will probably come in 3.0, but it's going back to the size in January.   That FOV is what all the mainstream software and games are working with right now and you guys are in OMG panic mode.  Just relax and we will finally get the specs and final versions of the hardware later this year."
HoloLens,366jrd,Zohard_Tucheus_Anaim,2,Sun May 17 03:21:02 2015 UTC,not a deal breaker for me.  just release the damn thing.  People who never tried the first demo say the FOV didnt matter and they were still blown away.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2qDppynHwg&t=1131  I already knew what to expect with the FOV since pretty much every other AR smart glasses are similar.  This one is still the best and the real innovation is the stable tracking.  I really hope they don't delay it for the FOV crybabies.
HoloLens,366jrd,visgc,3,Sun May 17 04:26:25 2015 UTC,"Dear Redmo(n)d(ian)s,   Why so many down votes when he is right?  I know that this subreddit is run or partially run by MSFT folks, but he is telling the truth.  Vouyer porn and the simulator of snow-on-the-front-window driving are currently the only things that will be popular, unless the field of view in the final product released in October will be bigger.  That's why I did this HoloLens FOV parody, because I want HoloLens to be good and have bigger FOV.   I hope that this is just some AB testing how will people react to the smaller FOV. I really do ;)  Man, I own over 100 Holo- related domains and I am the last person who wants HoloLens to fail!   That's why I am telling the truth, even though it's not nice and hope that the final HoloLens will have bigger FOV.   Final verdict for MSFT's marketing AB testing department:  A (January) - good  B (April)      - bad  Howgh!"
HoloLens,366jrd,setoman,4,Sat May 16 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"OP may be right, but he ain't contributing anything - he's just basically ranting. That's also useless at the moment since the final specs aren't even announced. If the final product has been unveiled with a small FOV, and if the OP chooses to rant again, I might actually upvote him."
HoloLens,366jrd,holonames,3,Sat May 16 20:09:30 2015 UTC,"He is not right.  NASA has already found a use for it.  Navigating f'in Mars and exploring the terrain ""first-hand"" from their office. Game-changing stuff, and he calls it useless. It's ridiculous.  Many of MSFT's independent studios are developing and finding uses for it.  Many 3rd party institutions are developing and finding uses for it.    This person writes-off the most exciting new tech in years based on nothing more than articles and you-tube videos, which in total, are overwhelmingly positive but note this one limitation that is, by all accounts, unsettled.  It may be a deal breaker for a few narrow-minded and obtuse individuals, but not to reasonable people who appreciate what a step this is.    Humanity has created a beautiful digital world and for the first time we can begin to bring it into our physical world, but we are being told the project should be scrapped because we won't be able to see this virtual objects in our peripheral vision.  laughable.  This no more a deal breaker than the first automobile being incapable of doing 60mph, the first plane being able to fly across the Atlantic, the first phone being wired to a wall, the first TV lacking color or HD, or my current 48"" tv representing only ~10 degrees FoV.  Obviously, the larger view the better and there is nothing wrong with challenging MSFT and other OEM's to continuously improve it.  But to call it useless is useless, especially considering some of the most advanced companies and organizations on the planet have already signed up to use it."
HoloLens,366jrd,Genesis_Prime,0,Sun May 17 04:21:47 2015 UTC,"obviously, NASA are getting a specilized different version. they are certainly not getting the narrow FOV build version. which would be ""useless"". yes. Especially for business applications, i wouldn't see any one making this a standard for their business with such low FOV.   The thing is, when creating a new category that has never been created before. Your product needs to be good, and not have a huge flaw. Apple gets away with this because they join a category after 4 to 10 years of it being in the market. Ala smartphones and smartwatches. They don't have to do anything but make marginal changes and you will see people use their product instead of others because maybe its has this or that feature or that it has less flaws.  Nowadays people use their branded products even though its shitty (apple watch). But hololens is creating a new big category and because of that, it can't have a huge flaw because it will demage its future. There are no saturated AR devices in the market, so hololens can't come out claiming its the best. People will always buy what they think is the best out at the moment. But  people will dismiss things if it had major flaws and there's isn't a competing product to compare with to tell them this new thing is awesome.  So then you release a version 2 or 3 and see little traction. why? because people saw one and dismissed it and word of mouth and everything damaged the category and therefore it has to grow small by small. But a product with alot of minor flaws right out the gate would flourish. aka kinect (fastest selling consumer electronics). One you build that user base and market share with the first version. your next version would grow it tremendously.  your version 2 doesn't even have to be a magnitude leap better than version 1. but it will still sell like hotcakes because you built that user base and word of mouth with version 1."
HoloLens,366jrd,holonames,1 point,Sun May 17 06:32:48 2015 UTC,"It's not useless. MSFT must see that people are not liking the option B. If they don't want to hear the rants, I suggest them to tweet something like, yeah, we will improve the FOV guys, don't worry. If they won't do that, these kinds of ""rants"" will not go away and I am afraid that they will increase and the parodies of Hololens small FOV will increase too. Down voting will not help solving the problem. Just look at Bitcoin subreddit and their down voting when somebody criticize some relevant thing about Bitcoin. Hence the rise of Buttcoin subreddit. I really don't want to be a regular on VouyerLens subreddit. MSFT guys, I hope you understand."

HoloLens,35zs0a,Shooob,3,Thu May 14 21:53:55 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised the BBC decided to run with this story. I know some other sources were reporting it, but it seems pretty speculative to comment on this particular patent as an aspect of the HoloLens.  The connections are certainly there: Kudo's listed as an inventor and the HoloLens fits the bill as a head-mounted holographic-showing display, but there are many other patents that could just as easily be linked to the HoloLens and this one strikes me as something that won't be part of the core device (though I could see the HoloLens reacting to data from an external source like a Microsoft Band).  I don't mind the speculation of course; it just strikes me as odd that this idea is the one making headlines. However, I'll be happy if this capability turns out to be present in the consumer HoloLens since it will make my graduate research (on user modeling and adaptive interfaces) more relevant than I had anticipated."
HoloLens,35zs0a,BI_Joe,2,Thu May 14 23:56:11 2015 UTC,"I agree about the speculative part. I think they, like everyone else, is jumping on the bandwagon with all of the ""possible"" applications and health is a pretty big industry.

HoloLens,35x7p2,ralexand56,10,Thu May 14 07:07:25 2015 UTC,I am under the impression that they were throwing kits together so that they would look closer to retail units instead of the neck-strapped equipment they showed off earlier in the year. I don't expect what was shown off at BUILD to be final hardware.
HoloLens,35x7p2,bearxor,10,Thu May 14 14:19:04 2015 UTC,"It makes sense that the FOV isn't final.  If you look at the lenses, you can see the interference pattern is only taken up half of the size of the lenses themselves (The dark part of the lenses that do the actual work of bending light).  So, if she said that her insiders say that the FOV isn't final, then I believe her.  You won't get full 110 degrees or anything like that, you will have to wait for 2.0 or 3.0 to get that, but in theory it should be at least much better than what they had at build.  Remember, they only made a small supply available ONLY for build and notice how there is no detailed spec listing of what everything is inside?  The FOV will be better at launch, we just don't know how much better."

HoloLens,35x7p2,ilovegoogleglass,3,Thu May 14 19:00:23 2015 UTC,"Well, if you have a look at the lenses you will see a dark rectangle, that is the part that allows for the light to be bent like a ""refraction"" and that is the part that helps create the FOV.  If you were to use the rest of the lens you would be able to gain a higher FOV.  My conservative hope would be 20-30 percent higher, but in the end it could be a little bit higher."

HoloLens,35x7p2,ilovegoogleglass,2,Thu May 14 22:31:24 2015 UTC,One frustrating thing is that Microsoft isn't saying anything. Now we wait again for the next public event and hope to learn more about the HoloLens.  We got answers during Build 2015. And new questions. And hopefully they get answered in 1 month at E3.  The field of vision (FOV) is a deal breaker for some. A disappointment for most. This needs to get addressed. Even if it's just some marketing spin. But the total lack of communication is very frustrating.
HoloLens,35x7p2,stesch,8,Fri May 15 02:56:01 2015 UTC,Questions are good for Microsoft. People are talking about HoloLens. That's all that matters at this point.
HoloLens,35x7p2,GrzegorzWidla,6,Thu May 14 11:48:22 2015 UTC,"Cheapening aside, I think MS is keeping mum regarding the device's FOV to ""manage expectations"" while hyping/teasing at the same time. Remember that even Nadella (sp?) is stressing on this one.  Let me elaborate: Demoing a ""lesser"" product will lower people's expectations for the final release (as someone has already said, I forgot who). Keep in mind that the first demo in January isn't fully immersive; it has a big-enough FOV to occupy most of your vision, but it's still confined in a ""box display"" and doesn't cover the extremes of your peripheral vision (or perhaps a significant chunk of it).   So, by further limiting the FOV and staying silent, MS is giving an impression that the FOV won't be impressive. And then, when the next demo comes along, bam! The FOV is suddenly wider (but still limited like the January demo), and every news site will give it full of praise because they ""listened"". Headlines will be like: ""Microsoft Delivers.."", ""The Real Next Big Thing is Finally Here"", ""The Future of Computing"", blah, blah, blah. People will love it, and a whole lot will adapt the technology.   Anyway, we really can't do/know much until MS opens its mouth, or some MS exec cracks, so take my speculations with a spoon of salt. But I would have to say that the technology is already there, and it can only get better. I'm very excited! :D"

Everyone who's used it has been blown away by how awesome it is -- even the people who've said "" the FOV is less than I'd like"" have also said, it's magical and great.

Saying that it's not final could mean that it only improves 5% or even 30% which would still be too low.

HoloLens,35utp1,ilovegoogleglass,8,Wed May 13 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting and certainly not a coincidence that this and last week's ""Inside Microsoft Studios"" blog posts were about people working on HoloLens games with E3 coming up. I'm hoping for some big reveals on the gaming front."
HoloLens,35utp1,ralexand56,0,Wed May 13 19:59:23 2015 UTC,"If they can't increase that fov, they will be savaged if they try to show this off at e3."
HoloLens,35ncv4,massivebacon,4,Mon May 11 22:35:41 2015 UTC,"As unsatisfying as it is, I think we'll need to wait until the release of hardware to be able to how problematic clipping is and how it could be mitigated.  Intuitively, I imagine the biggest issue for ""immersion"" is tall holograms (trees, people) getting clipped above the ground. That might be something users will learn to accept or it might be something that needs to be avoided. Some of the existing demos work around this constraint by showing off large environments behind a virtual whole in a wall or floor. Using the HoloLens to ""X-Ray"" through real objects to see virtual environments contextualizes clipping effects as the limits of the x-ray ability instead of the virtual environment disappearing.  Although clipping is annoying, objects that are entirely out of view are a more pressing issue for productivity-oriented applications. Objects could go out of view regardless of how large the FOV is, but a smaller view compounds the issue. Several people who tried the HoloLens at Build noted that it was easy to lose sight of holographic objects and frustrating to locate them once out of view.  There are a number of ways to deal with out-of-view objects, and this Microsoft patent details a few of them:   drawing virtual ""tendrils"" from within the FOV to out-of-view objects showing a (head-locked) map to locate holograms placing markers at the periphery of the FOV indicating where out-of-view objects are using animation cues when moving objects out of the field of view to indicate how far away the objects will end up using spatial sound"
HoloLens,35ncv4,BI_Joe,3,Tue May 12 14:10:35 2015 UTC,so if they patent this what does that mean exactly about someone implementing these solutions
HoloLens,35ncv4,hololeo,3,Tue May 12 19:03:20 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. Some of the claims in the patent are ridiculously broad and would (hopefully) not hold up in court if Microsoft took the claims to their extreme (any AR computing device that indicates the position of virtual objects outside the FOV). On the other hand, when you look at some of the patents involved in the Apple/Samsung battle, some elements of this patent seem comparable in scope. Hopefully, this patent will be used mostly defensively, but if I were Facebook or Google, I'd be very wary of infringing on elements like the tendril system (claims 14-19) without licensing this patent. The patent system is terrible for software in general, but this patent shouldn't affect most developers (unless you have billions of dollars in sales, in which case you should already have an army of lawyers). I really wish someone would reform this system already."
HoloLens,35ncv4,BI_Joe,2,Tue May 12 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"Oh man, awesome link. Thanks!"
HoloLens,35ncv4,ianott,3,Tue May 12 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"The bottom line will be that apps must be developed to encompass smaller sized objects. TV Screens that span your entire wall should be discouraged. As very large objects will surly be clipping most of the time they are visible. The objective should be that yes clipping will occur, but scaling your objects, or spreading them out in such a way to minimize the percentage of time a user is looking at a clipped object."
HoloLens,35ncv4,unt1tled,2,Tue May 12 01:53:05 2015 UTC,"Well we want objects to look as if they're in the real world and since real objects don't do anything fancy within our natural field of view, I don't think there's anything that can be done by developers that won't break the illusion. Adding borders or dissolves would be just as jarring.  An increased FOV is simply imperative in order to increase immersion."
HoloLens,35ncv4,ChronoChris,2,Tue May 12 00:51:19 2015 UTC,"My idea was to have something be ""minimized"" until you entered fov, which then it will ""open up"".  It's like don't worry, all your stuff gets minimized out of view. like a tiny box containing your app."
HoloLens,35ncv4,visgc,2,Tue May 12 01:52:35 2015 UTC,"Seems like spacing and detail are important.  Larger objects should be reserved for cases where the user would typically want to be a few feet away, such as shooting aliens or reviewing home decorating options.  Items that the user would want to view up close should be sufficiently detailed to allow the user to focus on a specific aspect of the hologram, such as a with a city building game or a holographic heart.  But until developers get to with with it and final fov is revealed, it will be difficult to guess what will work and what will not.  Even a 30 degree fov would make for a really nice tv though"

In the prototype you can see  the actual layers of substrate while in the concept it's all one slab of glass. In their marketing renders they showcase the one slab of glass system.  To speculate we could say the current prototypes are using a placeholder system or the production concepts are just  marketing coys to make the device look prettier.

HoloLens,35eorr,ralexand56,1 point,Tue May 12 00:11:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The FOV was the very first thing I noticed, unfortunately. Although it wasn't as bothersome after we applied a cursor to the scene which followed your gaze and narrowed your focus. When you're looking large objects, however, seeing them get clipped off is indeed unsatisfying.  But given that the device has already solved so many of the other technical obstacles, I consider increasing the FOV to be a rather small one. If the consumer version had say double the FOV, it would truly be above groundbreaking and I imagine people wouldn't want to take the thing off.  I did mention the limited FOV to several people on the team, but the interview asked specific questions."

A caveat to this is that everything would be in 2D, but since you specified for peripheral vision it's highly suitable (humans don't have depth perception in their peripherals.)

Augmented reality is far, far harder to do well. Rather than replacing the real-world, AR objects must co-exist within it. Any lag, or positional drift, or 3D creations too translucent will all undermine the experience.   This isn't quite so simple. The effects of lag, drift or other tracking errors are typically comparatively worse for VR than AR. ""Whoa the world is lagging! -Brain"" == simulator sickness, while a single object lagging just limits the experience.  I do agree, though, that the tracking faced by AR is in general much (much!) harder than the one faced by VR, but with VR the tracking really has to be close to flawless to be consumer ready. AR systems can have quite a bit of lag and still be useful.  And just as a disclaimer I've used neither any VR system or any AR system. This is just what I've gathered from reading about these issues."

HoloLens,358sin,Homsar3,2,Fri May 8 01:36:18 2015 UTC,"My feeling is that they want to put themselves in a position where they have to achieve the best FOV that they can possibly muster.  That, if they were promising what we see with the Epson headset that DontBuy123 shown earlier, they would settle on that, put the Hololens out now, and go from there.    But, they want more, the consumer wants more, and that's at least what they're shooting for.  That's what every developer, their supervisor, their VP, all the way up to the top is clamoring for...a flawless, seamless, standalone with an extremely big FOV.  We won't get that.  Not in the first iteration, we all know that.  I guess the idea is to shoot for the stars, but land on the moon...then shoot for the stars again from the moon lol."

They came up with a new device, that is in no way revolutionary (yeah, haters… tell me how innovative the taptic thingy is…). It does not serve a purpose, besides substituting your iPhone in some ways.  Still, most reviews put Apple on a golden podium, applauding for its genious and creativity.

On a separate note, users need to see the real world through those lenses. The lenses shouldn't be warping that view. If the lens in question only affects projected optics I still don't understand how we're seeing anything in these photos (where the device is off) and I'm also unsure how this lens+waveguide system is supposed to work.  OTOH, it's really late and I haven't paid enough attention to these aspects of the optics so I could be missing something simple."

HoloLens,34wuye,hololeo,2,Tue May 5 21:54:38 2015 UTC,i am left confused by 'black is a lack of light'  can hololens achieve 100% transparency? it does not seem to be the case as reported by the AMA users  which means this is not a laser projection system
HoloLens,34wuye,bestnicknameever,3,Tue May 5 06:13:12 2015 UTC,"Not sure exactly what you're asking, but black is, by definition, a lack of light.  In the tweets, Alex seems to be agreeing that black objects are transparent for the HoloLens (or as transparent as it gets, not necessarily 100% transmissive) as it does not remove light but acts in a purely additive way.  This was the topic of my earlier speculative post which I still think holds some validity, but there is at least one recent report (the one from Doc_Ok) suggesting that the HoloLens cannot darken scenes at all."
HoloLens,34wuye,Doc_Ok,3,Tue May 5 06:36:45 2015 UTC,"Plus: in none of the demos did they show holograms against a light background… the always had dark backgrounds (especially in the first demo with the holostudio (?) app, where she build that drone…"
HoloLens,34wuye,Doc_Ok,3,Tue May 5 08:09:17 2015 UTC,"The demos with the ""special camera"" have repeatedly shown holograms that are substantially darker than the background. If the holograms appear like they do in those video, there is absolutely some form of darkening happening. The most blatant example of this is all the dark borders on windows in the living room demo, but in any of the stage demos a purely additive blend would look different than what was shown. In the January event, the Terry Myerson hologram has very dark hair and shoes, the HoloStudio toolbox has dark lines on it and objects in the toolbox have a holographic dark square behind them, and the color picker in HoloStudio includes shades of colors going all the way to black. There is also a white wall behind part of the holograms in that demo."
HoloLens,34wuye,Doc_Ok,4,Tue May 5 15:15:38 2015 UTC,"The demos with the ""special camera""   Those cameras do not have a HoloLens in front of the lens. They use a similar or the same tracking system as the HoloLens, but the rendered virtual objects are merged into the camera's video stream via post-capture compositing, not by projecting them into the lens. In other words, the video footage from the on-stage demos does not represent functionality of real HoloLens devices."
HoloLens,34wuye,visgc,2,Thu May 7 03:23:29 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of that.  All I'm saying is that those videos do depict a user interface that would look significantly different with a purely additive display. Using a dark theme for the windows and showing virtual shadows from windows onto real furniture would be misleading if there is no way to display darkening.  Your impressions and Alex's statements point towards purely additive blending, but many reports have said that the opacity and colors of the holograms have been comparable to the concept videos, which doesn't seem possible with purely additive blending. I haven't tried a HoloLens myself, so my impressions of it have to rely on secondhand information.  Edit: I trust your impressions more than most, but when you have people like Will from Tested saying ""It can make black. Not sure how."" (quote taken from the comments on their recent video) and testers of the January prototypes also claiming to see black in normally lit rooms, I don't know what to believe. However, the device is giving some people the strong impression that it's displaying black and the UI seems to take the capability of displaying black for granted in its design. Kipman is still unambiguously saying it doesn't display black though."
HoloLens,34wuye,Aceofspades25,2,Thu May 7 04:30:11 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of that.   OK, wasn't clear.   would be misleading   Yup.   many reports have said that the opacity and colors of the holograms have been comparable to the concept videos   The demos were done in carefully controlled, quite dark environments, with the displays dialed up to maximum brightness I guess. I myself wasn't certain that the display was purely additive until I managed to get a ""hologram"" between me and a table lamp that they had forgotten to turn off. At that point it became clear."
HoloLens,34wuye,Seelengrab,2,Thu May 7 05:09:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, as always.   I myself wasn't certain that the display was purely additive until I managed to get a ""hologram"" between me and a table lamp that they had forgotten to turn off. At that point it became clear.   Light sources are definitely known to break through the effect. I think we can conclude definitively from Kipman's comments and hands-on reports that HoloLens does not block light completely with an LCD screen or similar technology.  I'm bad at conveying this concept, but it seems pretty clear to me that the HoloLens is capable of ""removing"" light because it adds that light to the display itself. We know the following:   The HoloLens visor is dark and translucent. It acts like a pair of sunglasses. Bright lights cut through any holograms. Holograms are not 100% opaque. A ""black"" hologram projects no light and appears simply as whatever light passes through the visor. The HoloLens displays colors by adding projected light to the light coming through the glasses. In order for the previous point to be possible, HoloLens has to have a model of the light coming through the glasses. The amount of light filtered by the visor would be a known function to the HoloLens team. The amount of light removed by the visor could be added back to the display via projected light (given points 4 through 6). This would make the visor appear more transparent than it actually is. Light that is added to the display via projection can be removed programmatically. All the preceding points amount to a display technology equivalent to programmable sunglasses with a resolution equal to the HoloLens display (since this effect is in fact driven by the display) and a maximum opaqueness governed by the visor. Every single one of the publicly shown (videotaped) demos has blackish holograms that would appear almost invisible regardless of lighting conditions if light could not be programmatically removed from the display over the real environment. Many (but not all) reviewers have found the HoloLens very opaque and a couple have stated outright that they believe it can display black."
HoloLens,34wuye,Doc_Ok,3,Thu May 7 05:47:26 2015 UTC,"That's a conceivable scenario, but it's contradicted by several observations. The HoloLens display has a small field of view, with large borders around the display that are visible to the user. It cannot add light outside the display area. Therefore, if the HoloLens visor were sunglass-like, the central area (where light gets added back in by the display) would appear significantly brighter than the peripheral areas, but it doesn't. The display area is only very little brighter than the outlying areas, which is explained by the non-infinite contrast of the display engine (most probably LCOS), which cannot produce true 0% blacks.  An alternative explanation could be that only the central display area on the visor is darkened, and the peripheral area is clear. But if that were the case, there would be a significant difference in apparent brightness between the areas when the HoloLens is powered off. But that's not the case; the entire visor, i.e., the display and screen areas, are almost clear and do not show different tinting in different areas. This could be seen on the display models (which were shown with no supplied power), and I saw it myself when my HoloLens ran out of battery and shut down halfway through my demo.  This is the big evidence; a more subtle issue is that, if the display engine were to ""overdraw"" the real world to bring its brightness back up to original, the real-world view through the display would appear pixelated at the display resolution. That was not the case, either -- the display pixels were small, but visible, and the real-world view had no noticeable pixelation artifacts.  Overall, the HoloLens' visor is not at all like a pair of sunglasses. It is almost completely clear.  Until further observations come in, I would consider reports that HoloLens can display dark or black objects as cases of confirmation bias."
HoloLens,34wuye,bestnicknameever,3,Thu May 7 08:13:04 2015 UTC,Quick additional point: in the living room demo they literally show virtual shadows from the holographic windows on the real world. That's pure darkening and it wouldn't be visible at all in an entirely additive display.
HoloLens,34wuye,re_kinect,2,Tue May 5 17:15:15 2015 UTC,There is also a lot of black in the netflix app in the on-stage demo. Why would they even show a Netflix app if they can't produce dark images?

HoloLens,34wuye,Zohard_Tucheus_Anaim,2,Fri May 15 13:05:15 2015 UTC,"Well, in order to darken a scene, you have to remove light. The hololens is a lot of awesome things, but not a light magnet. You'd need a black hole for that."
HoloLens,34wuye,Larry_Mudd,3,Tue May 5 12:27:51 2015 UTC,"You could add a liquid crystal display layer to the lens itself. That will allow you to adjust the opacity of the lens on a per-pixel basis from almost 100% to almost 0%, and can be used to darken the real-world image and present opaque objects. But HoloLens isn't doing that (yet)."
HoloLens,34wuye,ralexand56,2,Thu May 7 03:26:02 2015 UTC,maybe in Hololens second generation… hehe
HoloLens,34wuye,yoda2577,2,Tue May 5 12:32:17 2015 UTC,"You'd need a black hole for that.   You don't need to actively suck away light, only prevent it from hitting the user's eyes. That's relatively easy: you can do it with sunglasses or a blindfold. The trick is to blend darkening into the environment in a way that selectively blocks light in specific areas and keeps images in focus.  The visor of the HoloLens does provide some amount of darkening. A ""purely additive"" display may be adding some base level of illumination back to the scene which could then be selectively removed to darken objects. That's not trivial to implement, since the virtual display would need to carefully match the light removed by the visor, but it's conceivable.  There are a lot of reasons to believe that the HoloLens doesn't provide any sort of darkening, but as I just said in my other reply, the on-stage HoloLens demos showed content that would require displaying darker-than-background colors to appear properly."

Guess we can speculate as much as we want, but only time will tell. To be fairly honest, what did Build actually teach us?

HoloLens,34v2js,Karma_V12,4,Wed May 6 16:48:47 2015 UTC,"That seems to summarize it pretty succinctly. I think for //Build/ what they may have done is cut back on the price to manufacture a bunch of devices so that developers can see exactly how easy it is to build for/what it can accomplish. This does a couple of things for Microsoft:    They are able to show a lot of developers how to develop for it so that they can start making their applications now.  The product (outside of the FOV) works beautifully and seems to be quite revolutionary.   Now, my thoughts for Microsoft going forward are this:    Microsoft is going to be showing off the HoloLens at E3. E3 is a gaming conference, one can assume they will be showing games on it.  Games simply will not work with the FOV people have stated that the //Build/ version had, but will work on what the FOV of the January event seemed to be.   I also do not think this is the final build because of the following:    The event was extremely secure (had to lock up all belongings, couldn't take pictures, etc, etc).  Developers still have no idea when they can get their hands on a developer kit. [1]   [1] - This is a big point here. If Microsoft was confident with this or didn't have something better, they would be opening the floodgates to developers, especially since Microsoft loves developers and know that a product is sold by the applications/uses that exist for it.

(Probably a Haswell Core) The final product is said to have passive cooling. (Correct me if I'm wrong.) No reviewers mentioned heat regarding the BUILD prototype, which may mean a lower-powered processor compared to the previous iteration, i.e., Core-M Broadwell. (Although they may have used a Broadwell Core, which can also be fanless? Not sure..) Final Product will be released later this year, which is within SkyLake's release time frame. (More powerful, efficient, fanless processor.)   Add the BUILD prototype's measly 2GB RAM, and we  can guess that it's a really cheapened version. There really is no reason for them to go all out on a prototype, which is only for demoing purposes. If they do, they might as well have made it as a devkit, but they didn't."

HoloLens,34v2js,z0oinks,3,Mon May 4 23:42:51 2015 UTC,"They should just make it more expensive, this needs to be revolutionary!"
HoloLens,34v2js,cybelind,3,Tue May 5 02:19:16 2015 UTC,Agreed. The iPhone was considered expensive at the time and people said no ones paying $500 for it. Imagine if they went with the older touchscreens to save $100 or so. I would rather they overprice it and deliver magic instead of pricing it to sell but giving it a mediocre experience. It will inevitably come down in price like all things if they make it expensive.

HoloLens,34v2js,Lt-Twinklez,3,Tue May 5 13:56:23 2015 UTC,"It might not just be an issue of make it more expensive, it is possible that the battery drain on a super wide FOV would make the headset too heavy or bulky with their current design."
HoloLens,34v2js,yoda2577,3,Tue May 5 14:58:06 2015 UTC,"IMHO, it would be unwise to cut costs on a hundred or so prototypes for such a big event. I'd bet on some technical difficulties, e.g. they encountered performance problems when running untethered, and decided to have small FOV rather then laggy picture."
HoloLens,34v2js,richard_h87,3,Mon May 4 22:03:47 2015 UTC,"That sounds equally likely. Considering they were trying to get across the point of ""hey this product is actually real and  practical!"" I could understand choose performance over FOV."
HoloLens,34v2js,l3ugl3ear,2,Mon May 4 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"I can imagine it being a combination of both. Given how early the devices are cutting costs makes sense.  Additionally, I imagine they are still trying to figure out the right balance for the consumer release. Battery life, price, speed probably all pulling the team in different directions."
HoloLens,34v2js,BI_Joe,1 point,Tue May 5 02:01:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed, my best guess how intencive the proccessing is to figure out what the user is looking at is probably easier on a smaller FOV :/"
HoloLens,34v2js,visgc,1 point,Sat May 9 22:22:21 2015 UTC,"It could also be that they didn't want to release all of their tech into the ""open"" in build? At least not until they're closer to launch, in order to stay ahead of everyone else."
HoloLens,34v2js,ilovegoogleglass,4,Tue May 5 05:24:43 2015 UTC,"From the press reports alone, it does seem pretty clear that there's a difference between the Build devices and the January prototypes. The question is: why the change?  Was it a cost-cutting measure for Build? On the one hand, it seems odd to cut costs when demoing the device for the first time to a wide audience. On the other hand, Build is an audience of developers, and making high fidelity HoloLens prototypes is a huge expense for a weekend event since they're still being produced in tiny volumes.  Was it a conscious decision to favor resolution over field of view? The new prototypes have a smaller FOV than the old, but they also appear to have a higher resolution. It's possible that there's simply a tradeoff here, although from the reaction to the two prototypes, it's clear that the larger FOV is the winning side of that trade-off. Or at least that's the impression people have after using the device briefly. With extended use, perhaps higher resolution is more useful than a larger FOV though not as immediately impressive.  Was it unfinished? The smaller FOV design may be a step towards a final version of the device with alternative methods of expanding the FOV. In that case, which seems to be what ilovegoogleglass is suggesting, the current prototypes may have taken a hit in FOV because they moved to the display technology used in the final version of the device without some components of that system available yet.  I think all of these possibilities are reasonably likely. Personally, I believe that the HoloLens hardware was slightly behind schedule for Build. We were originally supposed to get information on the SDK during Build, which notably didn't happen. The hardware is very close to being done, but the delay of the SDK release is likely due to delays in the production schedule of the hardware, not the state of the SDK itself. That being the case, it seems reasonable to assume that the hardware at Build was not final (and the manual entry of IPD is one major indication that it's not final hardware) but HoloLens had to make an appearance at Build regardless.  By the way, I have no idea what happened to the first comments in this thread. They weren't removed by moderators or the spam filter and no one appears to be shadowbanned."
HoloLens,34v2js,ilovegoogleglass,3,Tue May 5 04:33:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all of those possibilities seem highly likely. We'll know more in 6 weeks at E3 :)"
HoloLens,34v2js,bestnicknameever,2,Tue May 5 05:16:28 2015 UTC,Another possible limiting factor is licensing/acquisition.  MSFT has a lot of A/R patents but not all of them.  Maybe they are waiting on negotiations of additional tech before implementing it in prototypes for public/developer use.  100% speculation but MSFT's virtual silence on the matter leaves our imaginations open

HoloLens,34v6ej,hololeo,2,Mon May 4 23:07:49 2015 UTC,I think the image they used is also misleading. At AMA thread mentions credit card 2 inches away from eye method.

HoloLens,34vqlj,Summons,8,Mon May 4 23:25:22 2015 UTC,"I am baffled as to why journalists are keep comparing price of HoloLens to a gaming console. HoloLens its not a toy for gaming where a highschooler or collage students could easily afford. HoloLens is all-in-one untethered device that uses top of the line technology that can handle display, sound and computing. For regular consumers, its a purchase option that comes after owning essential devices like a computer, a phone (and a gaming console). Which makes this 3rd or 4th option, meaning its a luxury item. I expect HoloLens to cost around $1000~$1500; however, I think developers and industries will jump on even if it costs near $2000."
HoloLens,34vqlj,Genesis_Prime,4,Tue May 5 03:43:55 2015 UTC,"To be fair, this isn't new information and a Microsoft executive didn't say the price would be out of reach for some people.

HoloLens,34vqlj,yoda2577,3,Tue May 5 15:00:03 2015 UTC,"The HoloLens has very little to do with videogames. The author of the article is misinformed in many aspects of the HoloLens. The HoloLens is more similar to a PC than a gaming console. It is a PC that is wireless, battery-powered, and generates holograms in lieu of a traditional display. Like a PC, it can play games, but it is not meant to replace your console. If anything, I imagine it could enhance your console gaming experience. I'm expecting it to be $1000 or more, simply because the specs would have to be high to deliver a great experience, especially given the size, form-factor, and that it's wireless and battery-powered. It has a lot of utility and could theoretically replace your entire PC and other devices--for that reason, it will be more similar in cost to buying a mid-range gaming PC, not a gaming console."

HoloLens,34u8vn,holonames,4,Mon May 4 16:39:37 2015 UTC,"As a technical writer, I was excited until I read that the HoloLens had such a limited FOV. I usually have many reference documents open as I write, and currently my solution is to have multiple wide-screen monitors, but, as the number of required reference documents rises, eventually my current solution fails. I was excited because the prospect of unlimited reference documents meant I wouldn't be alt-tabbing as much.  The limited FOV means I'd have to move my head around a lot to reference the documents versus simply my eyes. In practice, this would probably cause some strain after a solid eight hours of work.   I'll probably be a second or third generation adopter."
HoloLens,34u8vn,JayDurst,2,Mon May 4 17:40:35 2015 UTC,"The FOV will be probably bigger. The previous version presented in January had bigger FOV than this one presented on BUILD. But even if that's not the case, the next generations will have much bigger FOV, as you have said."
HoloLens,34u8vn,catnipd,2,Mon May 4 17:50:58 2015 UTC,"Even if FOV would be increased, the question of resolution still remains open. I honestly doubt that Hololens has more than FullHD resolution, which translates into only one virtual screen. So, moving one's head can be the only solution here, with many virtual screen anchored in different places, but only displaying the one you are directly looking at.  EDIT: typos"
HoloLens,34u8vn,BI_Joe,2,Mon May 4 21:21:11 2015 UTC,"Upvoting you for contributing to the discussion, but you don't need an HD display for a text editor. Super high pixel density screens need to magnify text considerably for it to be legible at all. If an HMD had an HD resolution spread over a large FOV, it could emulate more than one readable standard-sized display.  FOV limitations would still limit the number of virtual monitors you could see simultaneously, but without using the device in that context it's hard to know how much of a problem that will be. My intuition is that the benefit of having infinite monitors would be worth having to move your head to see some of them, but if I already had a 3 or 4 monitor setup I might think otherwise."
HoloLens,34u8vn,catnipd,0,Tue May 5 03:49:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about ""readable"" part. However, 21""-23"" inch FullHD monitors are pretty much standard nowadays, and at least for me text with 960x540 resolution on 21"" screen looks like (albeit readable) shit.

HoloLens,34qji5,Akitoru,6,Sun May 3 18:00:18 2015 UTC,If they were enlisting feedback form the folks who tried it on at build or read any of the reviews from most tech websites then they know they need to fix the FOV.

HoloLens,34qji5,tuseroni,1 point,Sun May 3 20:59:26 2015 UTC,"why do you believe light diffraction is involved in the image production? seems to me like it's just an LCD without the reflector (or working like an LCD, that is it polarizes the light coming in, the liquid crystal flips the polarity allowing it out the other end, and changes to the liquid crystal increases or decreases the opacity by rotating the polarity of light traveling through the liquid crystal) do you have some place where they have explained how the display works?"
HoloLens,34qji5,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Mon May 4 17:42:41 2015 UTC,In waveguide optics there's a limit to how far/close you can diffract the image to the user. Microsoft seems to be using a Holographic waveguide approach. Increasing the exit pupil will make the waveguide prone to image loss due to stretching the image at a higher angularity.
HoloLens,34qji5,krylonshadow,3,Mon May 4 21:27:47 2015 UTC,"I am confident the FOV will be higher in the final product. There have now been various accounts that the HoloLens prototype in January seemed to have a higher FOV. I think there's a good reason why Microsoft is going out of their way to keep the specs and other details quiet, and why they had so many security procedures for testing it at Build, and why their live demonstration was misleading about how much FOV the device has--they know what their end goal is, but they want to start marketing it today. It is much easier to generate hype about a product that has a near-final design and already looks and feels consumer-grade. They built over 100 units for Build 2015--perhaps it just wasn't cost-effective at this time to build so many units with the finalized specs. What they wanted people to see was the power of the technology, that the ""holograms"" themselves are incredibly smooth, that the resolution is good, that the light-blocking tech is solid, that any Windows universal app is ready-to-go for HoloLens, and that, when this thing comes out, and has a better FOV, it's going to be a game-changer. Oculus kicked off the VR revolution, but they are not going to be first-to-market anymore most likely, which is going to hurt them in the long-run. As someone else mentioned, it's a great distraction to reveal this device which appears to be so far along in development that it would be overwhelmingly difficult for a competitor to catch up in time. I'm confident the HoloLens is coming out this year with a reasonable FOV, but I do think it may cost anywhere from $600-1000 simply because you are buying a wireless, rechargeable, hologram-generating computer."

Some of the higher-end models - better graphics hardware, more displays, bigger battery to power it all - will have a fuller field of view. The basic model will have a field of view like this, at least at first.  Hololens isn't one product, it's a platform."

HoloLens,34qji5,guard_press,2,Sun May 3 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"This is where the Microsoft PR Team needs to step up and manage expectations.  If they made an official announcement stating the FOV would be enlarged then people would be put at ease, but since they're not it makes one think that the product shown at Build is pretty much what we'll get at the end of year.  I have no problem and it's not crazy to have a first gen product with a smaller FOV but they need to speak to the future.  If it's technologically impossible to improve the FOV, beyond insanely expensive cutting edge tech, then the project needs to be shelved if the FOV is really that limited."
HoloLens,34qji5,CorvusVR,2,Mon May 4 20:24:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not a hardware designer but the solution is obvious to me.  If the image is distorted by stretching the FOV then they need to project two view screens.  The one that is stretched would have the field blocked out where the second one without stretching exists.  When we look at objects, we don't see things in our peripheral vision in high definition.  Our brains would become accustomed to the illusion and we would see objects in our peripheral view just as we see them in the real world, distorted. For example, as you read this don't look away from the words.  Everything in the peripheral view is blurred.  You can only focus in a narrow corridor to begin with. I believe this could solve the problem though it might require a bit more hardware and make the unit more bulkier than in the latest demo.  They can manipulate the peripheral screen and make it blend with the focal area and even allow it to distort more as it leaves your peripheral view.  IMHO..."

I'd guess that it's the most epensive component of the device by a mile, and that the cost is roughly pegged to the square of its surface area.  The difference between a 20 and 90 degree FOV could easily be several thousand dollars.  This ignores the multiplicative problems with resolution and data processing, which are probably a big concern too... but I really think the size constraints we're seeing are going to wind up being heavily dependent on the production cost of the ""screen"" itself."

I direct you to this thread, which has this illuminating comment:   SBGs are switchable bragg gratings developed by SBG Labs[1] to increase FOV and image quality. In the first photo her HoloLens has two SBGs attached to the main waveguide, SBGs can increase FOV by 10 degrees. But using a surplus SBGs can add to the bulk of a optical system. In the current prototypes they've opted for a clear waveguide with no polarization or SBGs. The polarization basically directs the light to the correct SBG. The prototype that was shown off at the reveal might of had a bigger FOV (~45°+).   As to why Microsoft didn't show off this ""better"" product to journalists? I'm not sure, but I can think of several legitimate reasons ranging from limited hardware availability at the time to hiding the fact that they can do a higher FoV to distract competition."

HoloLens,34q20h,Countdown216,3,Sun May 3 18:44:47 2015 UTC,"No, the FOV is small. Easy way to estimate it is hold a credit card at the center of your vision approximately 2 inches from your nose. The difference in FOV between the adjustment mix and max would be the difference of about 1/16th of an inch difference in that 2 inch distance from your nose."
HoloLens,34q20h,seiggy,2,Sun May 3 19:00:20 2015 UTC,"Easy way to get the distance, take two credit cards, one vertical so the long edge is against the tip of your nose, and then the other as the view screen again that credit card."

HoloLens,34pze6,setoman,1 point,Sun May 3 15:23:05 2015 UTC,Yes the apparatus is fabricated into one slab of glass (in the current Build prototypes). Here's a side view 1 2  The Wired picture was taken at a resolution of 2400x1600. 3  Reflections wouldn't be as uniformed as that.
HoloLens,34pze6,setoman,2,Sun May 3 15:51:48 2015 UTC,"i read a review that said the actual glass is like 3 glasses sandwiched together. (can't remember where)  Also if you look, the size of the Jan/current glass are about the same. But the Jan clear glass is half the size of the current clear glass.  To summarize:  January glass = half clear slab + half darkened slab (sandwiched into one) current glass = full clear slab (standalone)  So that's why i'm a bit cautious to say whether or not that's the reason for the low FOV. It could also be that because the display is active in the JAN photo, that one side of the glass is darkened as a result. Would like to see any close up photo/vid of the current version in action if you have them."

The lenses in the devices are definitely different.  For one, you can see the entire lens from the January event being utilized (as shown by how much of it is lit up while being used), whereas at the //Build/ conference only the smaller 2/3 of the lens is used.  They appear to be quite different.  EDIT:  Photoshopped together something showing exactly what /u/ilovegoogleglass is talking about: http://i.imgur.com/CBiENOn.png  EDIT 2: You can also see the difference in the lenses in the device at //Build/ and the device they render in promotional content: http://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/microsoft-hololens-sg-5-1280x720.jpg <- //Build/ device (notice the lens is one piece).  https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/microsoft-hololens-hardware.jpg?w=950&h=391 <- Product rendering (notice the lens looks like the one shown in January, not the one shown at //Build/)."
HoloLens,34pze6,krylonshadow,1 point,Mon May 4 20:07:09 2015 UTC,"So, the devices used at build are essentially supposed to be final build prototypes. But even though they have them on display behind glass you can get right next to, they still won't let reporters/devs take cameras into demo times.   Is this standard extreme due diligence, or is the working device being used now something they ordered just for build, and plan to invest more into wider FOV units meant for final release.  I assume FOV might be the biggest increase in cost/processing. More render area requires more processor.    Just random thoughts. The FOV being described is so small, there is no way Microsoft expects this first hardware release to really, really take off."

HoloLens,34o0lb,AkNak,8,Sat May 2 22:45:29 2015 UTC,"FOV is the full angle subtended by a display. 180 degree FOV is a half circle.

HoloLens,34o0lb,Doc_Ok,4,Sun May 3 07:24:17 2015 UTC,Sounds like the whole FOV thing will be the biggest issue for HoloLens. I was really excited until I heard how tiny the FOV was. Kinda burst the excitement bubble.

HoloLens,34o0lb,kn33,2,Sun May 3 02:58:24 2015 UTC,Oliver Kreylos estimates that the FOV is: 30° x 17.5° http://doc-ok.org/?p=1223[1]
HoloLens,34o0lb,kn33,2,Sun May 3 03:21:24 2015 UTC,"That's 30 both ways ""near peripheral"", right?"
HoloLens,34o0lb,brianpeiris,3,Sun May 3 03:32:05 2015 UTC,"The way I've usually heard FOV described, the degree value represents the full view, not half of it. So I think Kreylos means 30° in total, which would be 15° on this diagram, just under ""macular""."

HoloLens,34o0lb,re_kinect,3,Sun May 3 04:01:19 2015 UTC,Just for reference - when you're programming or dealing with graphics the degrees describes the full vision not just one half. No idea how hololens people would describe it though.
HoloLens,34o0lb,HumanistGeek,1 point,Sun May 3 07:23:49 2015 UTC,But this has to do with peripheral vision not just making an angle.  With your eyesight that angle may not be even. So you have your left and right periphery.

HoloLens,34m8qz,Ampix0,6,Sat May 2 23:06:04 2015 UTC,"I think this makes the BUILD device evidently a cheapened prototype (as stated by another user). 2 GB RAM doesn't make sense for a device that focuses on professional applications, which also possibly explains the smaller FOV compared to device in the announcement in January. 2 GB RAM is already considered lacking for laptops nowadays, what more for a 3D/AR machine. You would expect at least an 8GB RAM for a device of this kind, even with a dedicated HPU (according to my baseless speculations)."
HoloLens,34m8qz,Zohard_Tucheus_Anaim,11,Sat May 2 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"Comparing the RAM for the HoloLens to the RAM in a laptop is like comparing apples to oranges. Keep in mind that the HoloLens doesn't run a full Windows 10 Desktop UI. Nor does it have to deal with all of the possible device drivers, miscellaneous background services and crapware that most of us run on our PCs or laptops. Granted I can imagine the RAM being soaked up by all of these holograms running at the same time, we just don't know how memory intensive it's actually going to be on the device. 2 GB of RAM could be more than enough to run 100 holograms, or just barely enough to run 5. We'll have to wait for benchmarking to be done, which probably won't happen until the device gets in more developer hands."
HoloLens,34m8qz,Shooob,3,Sat May 2 15:37:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that they (HoloLens and Desktop PC) are that different to analogize them to apples and oranges, maybe lemons and oranges. HoloLens is still a computing device like laptops, and so would still need a handful of RAM for multitasking. The HPU (and whatever associated memory it comes with), which is said to process TBs of data, probably focuses on real-time sensing and mapping of the environment, and other related tasks. The ""holograms"" that are displayed in the visors are probably handled mainly by the GPU, and not the HPU alone - otherwise, there won't be a need for a 3rd processing unit if one would suffice.  Presumably, if my above statements are correct, the device would still need some RAM for multitasking and running memory-intensive 2D applications. I'm pretty sure the device also runs a handful of background services along with the active voice and gesture recognition, so it won't be much different from laptops.  Now, if only MS could finally reveal some more info so we can all be finally at ease (or more excited)... lol"

The device could be a prototype/dev kit similar to the Oculus Rift DK1, as a large number of reviewers really mentioned the fov and to release with such a small fov could kill the device, especially when a earlier model was shown with a higher fov.  One thing I could potentially see is a surface style line of products in that they could have the ""Hololens"" with a smaller fov and less storage/memory and then the ""Hololens pro"" with a larger fov, possibly larger frame and more memory, it would also account for the lack of direct access to sensors that was said in the BUILD events."

If I recall correctly, the Pro edition of Surface was clearly stated from day 1 (not sure, poor memory lol) and it doesn't seem to be the case this time, still...  Anyway, I've watched a video of Kipman(?) being interviewed saying that they really won't allow for direct access to the sensors of the device, and just the ""experience"" as they want it to be uniform across other (future) devices. Not sure about that, I wasn't really paying attention. You may want to view it yourself: http://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2015/C9-08 It's around 22:00, I think."

On the other hand however they say that they want a ""plurality of these devices that exist"" which could suggest either multiple versions at launch, or they're trying to future proof.   Reviewing it seems to suggest that the second path is more likely, though the first one shouldn't be ruled out either :)"

HoloLens,34mkmr,Jon_Freebird,4,Sat May 2 14:54:45 2015 UTC,"It looks like the assumption is that the bottleneck on FoV is battery life or processing power.  Do we know that this is really the case?  There is no screen and the holograms are being processed in full whether they are outside the FoV or not.  Not sure this is the real limiting factor.    It appears the FoV is limited by the size of the colored reflective lens that mirrors the hologram light back to your eyes.  Is this a costly material? Is there limited supply of larger lenses due to lack of current demand?  Is it due to current manufacturing limitations because of no set design?  Is this not the real bottleneck either?  Until we define precisely what the limiting factor is, it is difficult to speculate on when msft might be able to expand the FoV and what the tradeoffs are.  Unfortunately, msft isn't helping us grasp the issue with their super-secret approach to this.  But I get it, knowledge for us is also knowledge for potential competitors.  I think E3 will be interesting.  Expanded FoV will be much more impressive for gamming applications than for holo-origami"
HoloLens,34mkmr,visgc,4,Sat May 2 18:42:51 2015 UTC,Exactly. Don't know why everyone is assuming they know what the issue is. We really need an official response from MS.
HoloLens,34mkmr,ralexand56,3,Sat May 2 19:45:45 2015 UTC,I don't think it has anything to do with being tethered. There is no doubt they know about the FOV issue.

Thats because the FOV was larger and it included peripheral vision. But with the Build version, all journalists and attendees complain about ""TINY"" and they didn't even show fully immersive demos.

HoloLens,34mkmr,Shooob,1 point,Sat May 2 20:43:00 2015 UTC,"For me it would depend on how tethered we're talking about. If it's just a wired battery pack attached to your belt, then sure, I'm all for that if it would give me more FOV without hindering mobility. If we're talking about a HDMI plus USB to a PC or tablet, then I'd have to really think about it. Mobility is a big selling point for the HoloLens and I don't think MS will want to throw that away."
HoloLens,34mkmr,Eterna1Soldier,1 point,Sat May 2 15:24:13 2015 UTC,"If a smaller field of view is more about cutting production cost than a technical hurdle (which I believe it is), then I really hope Microsoft releases two different skus for Hololens (similar to the Surface 3 and Surface pro 3). For example a 'Hololens Pro' having a much wider FOV.  Even if it greatly increases the market cost, I think MS underestimates how much more people are willing to pay for a superior version of a product. I work at bestbuy, and I can tell you that our best selling laptops, tablets, macbooks, and phones are typically the most expensive ones we carry."

HoloLens,34n3tk,tuseroni,1 point,Sun May 3 21:38:51 2015 UTC,"probably not. main thing with movies is that they tend to be passive experiences, what's more they tend to be somewhat focused (the action is happening here, so having things going on behind you serves little purpose except to make it less likely you will notice it but which would never the less need to be filmed and presented in the event that you DID turn your head) the best that a 3d movie could give you would be a theatre experience (like live theatre, not movie theatre) so in this case something like a window appears and you look through it and there is a world where things are going on. then it's like watching the action unfold out your window. maybe from time to time something shoot through the window but there would need to be that constriction so the producer can know what you are going to be looking at in any given instance (the window scenario has a limitation there though, since your distance from the window will limit how much of the scene you see, but there are clever ways around that)  but in terms of being more immersive, i'm doubtful. could be interesting, novel even, but more immersive? not in a non-interactive medium."

HoloLens,34kon9,ilovegoogleglass,6,Sat May 2 00:08:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry but you're gonna have to dumb this down a bit for me. First, what does SBG mean? Also, I can't tell the difference between the photos. Can you point out what appears to be missing?"
HoloLens,34kon9,Shooob,7,Sat May 2 00:33:03 2015 UTC,"SBGs are switchable bragg gratings developed by SBG Labs to increase FOV and image quality. In the first photo her HoloLens has two SBGs attached to the main waveguide, SBGs can increase FOV by 10 degrees. But using a surplus SBGs can add to the bulk of a optical system. In the current prototypes they've opted for a clear waveguide with no polarization or SBGs. The polarization basically directs the light to the correct SBG. The prototype that was shown off at the reveal might of had a bigger FOV (~45°+)."
HoloLens,34kon9,shadyendless,7,Sat May 2 01:15:44 2015 UTC,"So, let me try and understand this without understanding this and you can tell me if I am correct :P   By using the SBGs they are able to increase the FOV by layering small (essentially films) onto the lenses. Each film increasing the FOV by 10 degrees. Microsoft already has devices using this (such as the sets that people were using on stage). Microsoft probably wasn't able to produce a lot of these for the press/developers to use. At E3 (the next confirmed appearance of HoloLens), we might see the device using the SBGs and having a larger FOV?   Tell me if I am close or way off. Watching the video you linked, it seems like increasing the FOV is already very possible (and you seem to insinuate that they already have)."

HoloLens,34kon9,hololeo,3,Sat May 2 01:59:24 2015 UTC,"I've been doing some more research into technology that exists that could fix this, and this is an issue that was fixed awhile ago. I feel like Microsoft will be able to fix this either by launch, or definitely in time for the second version (assuming they don't already have it fixed and not mass-produced yet).  I mean, if we think about it, these devices shown at //Build/ were likely made a couple of months ago (to be tested and also to look as good as they do now), and their optics technology could already  be beyond what they showed at //Build/.  It would be awesome if they showed up at E3 with a device that has the wider FOV thanks to SBGs or some other technology."

HoloLens,34mwm7,pokemasterflex,7,Sat May 2 16:46:50 2015 UTC,It's starting to look like MS shot themselves in the foot with this public demo. The fov is such a major negative that it's almost completely overshadowing all of the positives. I hope they can workshop this and do something to improve the fov or this might get dismissed before it has a chance to take off. That would be a shame. There's so much potential in this.
HoloLens,34mwm7,supersnappahead,1 point,Sat May 2 19:13:10 2015 UTC,They only have themselves to blame by showing this off with a larger field of view at the introduction and then nurfing the device. Did the same thing with the original Kinect. They should've have known they wouldn't be able to deliver that fov modified their prototypes accordingly. Guess that's why they wouldn't let journalist use the actual hololens device they had on hand back in January.
HoloLens,34mwm7,ralexand56,2,Sat May 2 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the ""nerf"" came from going from external power to self contained..or another factor resulting from them going wireless, but we don't yet know if this is final tech or how close it is to final, so I'm still holding out some hope that improvements can still be made before release.   They obviously felt confident in the tech for them to do such a big demo session, so they may have thought the fov was good enough, but that's clearly not the case. Every review focuses on it and it's definitely taken the wind out of HoloLens sails which I'm sure wasn't what MS expected or they likely wouldn't have been so ready to show it off."

I really do appreciate your review, as it is the ONLY review I have been waiting for in regards to the Hololens.  You've really cut through the hype and given an accurate representation of the reality of the Hololens and where we stand when it comes to such AR technologies.  Magic Leap may not have been too far off in their estimation of 3-5 years for a consumer device."

HoloLens,34kdx7,Doc_Ok,3,Sat May 2 01:32:04 2015 UTC,"Even with the 60 cm near clipping plane, I would think that a complete lack of accommodation cues would be noticeable. If it's not possible to tell the difference at all it may not actually matter.  The big surprise for me here is the purely additive imagery. That doesn't seem to match what others have said about opacity.  I wonder if the 60 cm near plane was present on the tethered prototypes. It sounded like people had been getting closer than that to the rocks in the OnSight demo."
HoloLens,34kdx7,BI_Joe,5,Sat May 2 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"With all the virtual objects being between 0.6m and 2m away (that was the demo room radius), and the focal plane at, say 1.2m, and the bright imagery, focus mismatches would be very subtle."
HoloLens,34kdx7,Doc_Ok,3,Sat May 2 01:15:40 2015 UTC,"True. I can see how it would be difficult to judge under those circumstances.  Which demos did you see? It sounds like you're mainly commenting on the Trimble (architecture) demo which does have really light images even in the concept trailers.  Were there any holograms that looked like they were supposed to be dark? The windows shown in the ""living room"" demo on stage have dark grey borders which seems like an incredibly poor/impossible choice if the device can't darken the view at all."

HoloLens,34kdx7,Doc_Ok,2,Sat May 2 02:12:57 2015 UTC,The clipping plane is a bigger problem than the fov.  With Fov you can just look around.  Clipping plane is permanent.  Nobody is talking about it becauseither it's not as obvious as the small fov.
HoloLens,34kdx7,BI_Joe,2,Sat May 2 02:11:41 2015 UTC,"Sean Hollister wrote this in the comments of his new HoloLens impressions:   Resolution, hunh? Between only having the chance to eyeball it, and relying on my memory, I’m probably going to totally botch an estimate, but... closer to 720p than 1080p, let’s say? Looked crisp enough. Not really comparable with VR-type screendoor effects since there are no magnifying lenses involved, just the fact that your eyes are pretty close.   CG objects start to alias badly if you get pretty far away from them (like 20 feet away), much like they do in video games as textures get scaled down.   Also, if you get too close to objects they start to blur. Originally, Microsoft set the minimum distance to 0.7-meters in Unity, so they would just disappear instead of going fuzzy, but closer than that there seems to be some kind of limitation in the optics.   That does imply that the focus is set at a fixed distance as Doc_Ok suggests, but the clipping plane is possible to override. Microsoft has done work on variable focal depths and holds several related patents, so hopefully it does eventually become a feature if it is not yet."
HoloLens,34kdx7,bboyjkang,2,Sat May 2 06:04:41 2015 UTC,"HoloLens does not provide, or the application did not use, eye/gaze tracking      In summary, here are the main take-home points:  Usable gaze-based selection   I suppose usable gaze-based selection is still head-tracking?

I wonder what these patents are for:   Gaze detection in a see-through, near-eye, mixed reality display US 20130300653 A1  The gaze detection coordinate system allows for determination of a gaze vector from each eye based on data representing glints on the user eye, or a combination of image and glint data   http://www.google.com/patents/US20140152558   Direct hologram manipulation using imu US 20140152558 A1  In some cases, the initial position of the virtual pointer within the augmented reality environment may be determined based on a particular direction in which the end user is gazing and/or a particular object at which the end user is currently focusing on or has recently focused on.   http://www.google.com/patents/US20130300653"
HoloLens,34kdx7,Doc_Ok,3,Sat May 2 02:10:30 2015 UTC,"I suppose usable gaze-based selection is still head-tracking?

HoloLens,34kdx7,camisado_,1 point,Sat May 2 02:30:33 2015 UTC,"Hey Doc, thanks for your write-up! It seems that FoV is the biggest complaint amongst those who have tried it. I got these responses from one of the attendees in regards to the FoV (from this thread):   When I was viewing a very large object the FOV became apparent. However, when you started to manipulate the object you were not focusing on the edges, just the content in the middle. Its was like watching TV, you know there is more content beyond the edges but you don't care to much because your focusing on what is in view.   And   I thought it was acceptable. If your thinking this is a holodeck replacement, its far from that. For the purpose of seeing some holograms and manipulating them I think it would be fine. If this were to be used in a way like the Illumniroom for Xbox, the FOV would be acceptable at a typical distance from the TV you would normally play at.   This makes the FoV seem like less of an issue (especially if I can use as a personal Illumniroom), although of course a better FoV would be more acceptable.  I guess my question is, how accurate do you think these responses are in relation to FoV? Are they overstating the insignificance of a limited FoV?"
HoloLens,34kdx7,Doc_Ok,2,Sat May 2 01:55:59 2015 UTC,"That's mostly a matter of personal taste. I found the low FOV very limiting in trying to work with the models. Oftentimes, what I was looking for was just out of view, and then I had to find it again by looking around (wait, where's the toolbox again?), as there's no indication.  Others might not be bothered as much, and it's possible I'm spoiled by my other VR environments, which have true surround ""holograms.""  I can only say that the FOV is X by Y. Whether that's too small or big enough is for everyone to decide for themselves. It should be easy to code a Rift app that simulates a HoloLens based on these numbers."

I will definitely buy this as soon it comes out and I can't wait to see the future improvements on this technology in the years to come. The parts that I am most amazed about is that the solved two major issues in my mind. 1 a shaky image, all the reports I have read say that the objects stay on the table where they should be and second that you cant see the pixels.  BTW from what I can tell for them to have the objects not move when you move the hololens needs to also predict your movements because there is a display lag. aka it is rendering the images for where you will be before you get there :o"

There's an image that iPhone fans like to pass around pretending that all phones looked different before the iPhone, and all looked like the iPhone after.  But in the real world, there were a bunch of phones from HTC, LG and Samsung that looked like the iPhone BEFORE the iPhone was released.  LG even accused Apple of copying the LG Prada design, which had win a design award the year before.  I like iPhones.  I like my iPad.  I like the Apple II and the Macs I've owned.

But let's be honest: at the time the iphone came out the user (hand-)friendliness and smothness of the OS was far ahead of everything else. The first android I owned that I thought started to feel comparable was the first galaxy s. At launch the iphone didn't have flaws as major as the HL's tiny FOV. Its a HMD. The FOV is crucial. I hope they wait with releasing it.

HoloLens,34jagg,alsomahler,10,Fri May 1 18:56:09 2015 UTC,"I did see that so yeah, Hololens is not exactly what was shown on stage.  However, given the technology, even this ""dissapointing"" form is STILL mindblowing. If there's any tech that doesn't deserve to be slammed for being a prototype, it's something as advanced as this.  That being said, if this is it's current state, I REALLY hope the rumors of it being released along with Windows 10 are false. This needs to be worked on for at LEAST a couple more years first instead of being rushed out as a disappointing hype-grab."
HoloLens,34jagg,abs159,5,Fri May 1 19:01:22 2015 UTC,It does seem like it should be pretty straightforward to expand that field of view.  (It might have even been limited solely to reduce processing power to what a battery pack can drive.) I'm just not optimistic that v1 is going to be much different from what they're demonstrating.
HoloLens,34jagg,ralexand56,2,Fri May 1 20:16:20 2015 UTC,"If the price point of the V1 product reflects this, I think it's okay. V1 is about getting the early adopters, pioneers, and creators thinking about the promise of it. Earlier the better, in my opinion. Think of it like the early Oculus DevKits.  Future revisions is where they can improve engineering, cost-reduce, and leverage the natural progression of processor and battery technology to have an even better product.  I'll take this version of hololens this year to get started on it, and buy an improved version that is suitable for the masses when it is available."

But everytime they show another unrealistic demonstration which doesn't represent the final product, without saying out loud that it's currently not near that state, I don't think they deserve their success.  Edit: Some background. CastAR has had a succesful Kickstarter where you can now order this device online, which is also pretty advanced stuff. Yes it needs a reflective surface, but it's here... However nobody is talking about it, because they just never suggested that their device would do that much more than it did. That just feels unfair to me."

I think that is a positive thing we can take form this article, as it means, that the technology is there, to make the FOV Bigger! I think it might be possible, that they made just the prototypes FOV smaller, because it was a smaller series, which is already more expensive to produce, thatn on a large scale. What do you think?"
HoloLens,34jagg,abs159,8,Fri May 1 19:12:27 2015 UTC,Its probably a price point thing. They want it in households as well as businesses. The first round is to get it out there. And for investors to know it works.  Second gen will get bigger FOV I bet.

HoloLens,34iovw,Macmee,1 point,Sat May 2 12:36:25 2015 UTC,"I think there's room for both, along with the traditional approach of playing it on the computer. I think we're still going to do the majority of mining on our computer (or VR, if you like). It'll just be easier and more convenient to quickly move around, break blocks and collect resources. But I can also see the appeal of having our Minecraft creations laying about and scattered around our physical environment. Stuff that you'll see every time you put on your HoloLens, even if you're just jumping on to make a Skype call or watch a movie or whatever. In this sense, it's just another form of decorating your house (or office...you know people will do it :) ).  To take that further, I'd also like to see these decorations be alive and do things. In the promo videos and from the January demos we can see that it's a living Minecraft world. I want to see lava flowing from the coffee table to the floor, bats flying out of a ""hole"" in the wall, creepers walking around and blowing stuff up....okay, maybe not that (damn you creepers!). I want it to give me a sense that there is a living, magical, mystical virtual world all around me, even if I'm just sitting on my couch and reading a book."

I thought it was funny though when he said something like ""I read paper after paper that said what we wanted to do was impossible."" I'm all for challenging the impossible but if those papers he read were technical documents with the technological limitations of his target phones and he wants to exceed those limitations then, yeah, it's gonna be impossible. It sounds like he's trying to use the phone's sensors to calculate depth. Isn't that pretty impossible to do with just one camera? Even if he uses the phone GPS, accelerometer, etc. those aren't precise enough to get an exact phone location for mapping. Or am I missing something here?"

Of course they want to know the opinions, it´s not coincidental, that they dont mention any specific release date yet.  I´m very curious on how the next months will be. Will MS start with all the secrecy again (hate it, but i guess it will), or will they go for a different approach, maybe involving developers more? Will be get to see some further developement now? Will the Hololens Newsletter finally start sending newsletters out more regularly?   Or is it just another dry waiting till… E3?  Exciting times we´re living in!"

HoloLens,34j2np,Genesis_Prime,3,Fri May 1 16:59:45 2015 UTC,It seems that the FOV in the prototypes demonstrated at Build is actually substantially smaller than the FOV used in earlier demonstrations.  Processing power and battery life may be limiting the amount of content that can be shown. That seems the most likely explanation for why the new untethered units would regress on FOV.

HoloLens,34kaf3,magicmellon,6,Fri Jun 5 17:56:08 2015 UTC,Waveguide optics have relatively stayed the same for the past few years it's just they've got cheaper and smaller. And waveguides are expensive to fabricate. Don't expect the FOV to go to 90-150° in a year. I just want people to know that don't be expecting a breakthrough in optics in 12 months even if they considered delaying it. Plus Microsoft has an add-on plan for HoloLens that remedies the FOV. I've found a patent describing this and I'll be putting up an analysis in the future.   The FOV isn't as nefarious as people think. The LCD shutter and the purported add-on device (that will be release with or separately) with HoloLens does wonders (at least expressively in the patent). I can't confirm if they will be releasing the add-on device (or even if it's still being actively developed on) but FOV isn't an issue with it. Look forward to my post in a few.  Cheers guys! :)

HoloLens,34inz5,Larry_Mudd,3,Fri May 1 15:25:07 2015 UTC,"u/Larry_Mudd is succinct in that there will be a server.    To elaborate, an application would most likely store an object in the cloud, and sharing of an object so that another user could open would be transparent.    Transparency could happen based on Active Directory settings.  For instance, members of a team could all be a part of a group that has access to the same content, and they can share it automatically.  Or devices could all be registered in a domain tree, which could share objects.  For instance, all the HoloLens units within an organization can see the same apps in the same location throughout a business.  So, if there is an app that allows everyone to see a schedule of meetings for a meeting room on a door, every unit would see it regardless of the wearer's permissions.    Another possibility is accepting requests.  If two people are passing in a hallway, and they both play a particular game, their presence may trigger an alert to join in a game.    Since many of them are already in use by Microsoft by various means, the likelihood is that they would likely use them with HoloLens."

I'm gonna guess that it'll be possible to run hololens using a surface 3 as a base, but I assume the experience will be better with a more powerful computer, especially if you want to enjoy a lot of complex visuals at once.  I'm thinking the Hololens acts kind of like a monitor when connected to a pc.  I think the processors on the headset just get data about the 3d space you're looking at, to feed back to a CPU somewhere else, and to decide how to draw what you see on the screens.    I predict that to have an ideal hololens exprience, you should have a multicore desktop pc with a capable GPU.  And a great wifi network.  And a clean home :-)"

HoloLens,34jk52,Shooob,11,Fri May 1 18:26:15 2015 UTC,"No, that's not true. The device being used by developers and at the //Build conference is completely wireless. The only exception is during the HoloLens Academy when they published new code to the device it was connected to a PC via USB. Otherwise, it does not require a tether.  Edit for clarification: Back in January, there was a custom box that was used while the device was still being developed and engineered. This is no longer the case and the units will ship as standalone devices."
HoloLens,34jk52,Shooob,2,Fri May 1 18:34:56 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm. That does seem like more information, but I am kind of searching for the same answer.  Is all the computation being done inside of the headset, or when you say that it is completely wireless, do you mean that the bulk of the computation is being done externally?  Figuring out position/orientation, environmental processing, understanding visual user input, understanding auditory user input, application processing, audio output, display output... where is all of that processing actually being done?  It seems a bit too much for a mobile processor, so that's what I'm trying to understand. Are all the sensors and all the processing and all the output done on the device, or is it more of a wireless input/output peripheral, or some hybrid?"
HoloLens,34jk52,Shooob,4,Fri May 1 18:47:51 2015 UTC,"According to Microsoft, all of the processing occurs on the device. Keep in mind that they have a CPU, a GPU and a custom engineered HPU (Holographic Processing Unit) all inside the device. According to them, the HPU processes terabytes of data every second, including the inputs you describe above.   Now, this is not to say that it couldn't offload or side-load some of the processing wirelessly to a PC on the network. We do know that it knows when a mouse cursor is moved off of a monitor that it can pick up the location of that cursor on the HoloLens. So, my guess is that the HoloLens will communicate with a PC on the network in some form. This may even be used if some heavy processing is needed for a particular app, but so far they haven't said anything about it. It's also probably that there will be a ""server"" app that will run on the PC for when there are multiple HoloLens devices on the same network so they can share and coordinate data/holograms."

HoloLens,34hze1,Genesis_Prime,2,Fri May 1 09:02:31 2015 UTC,"Kipman said that was intentional, so HoloLens wearers could still take advantage of their peripheral vision while wearing the device.   guess the FOV wont improve..."
HoloLens,34gj4c,ilovegoogleglass,3,Thu Apr 30 23:27:31 2015 UTC,Did I read correctly...? HoloLens and 2015 in one sentence? Is this like the first ever official confirmation of a release before the year is over???
HoloLens,34gj4c,bestnicknameever,1 point,Fri May 1 07:27:49 2015 UTC,"As a user of both Windows Phone 10 TP and Windows 10 TP, it is definitely noticeable which is getting far more development, for obvious reasons. I'm just hoping that the HoloLens is also getting a good amount of development put into it, honestly I hope it's getting more than the phone development, as this device needs to dominate when it comes out.  Regardless, I will probably be trying it out the day of release as my father is dead set on getting it on release."

HoloLens,34h1pa,holonames,2,Fri May 1 07:55:40 2015 UTC,As in a mp4/jpg file from the headsets camera but also containing the Holograms. So company's can record demo's of their apps and anyone can record app interaction and send it to youtube.  It will definitely help HoloLens gain popularity seen as all the other VR/AR experiences have to be physical.
HoloLens,34hy88,Evie19,2,Fri May 1 08:41:41 2015 UTC,"These guys talk about it a bit: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=e2qDppynHwg#/watch?v=e2qDppynHwg  Power is a big concern. But keep in mind these are pre-release devices; having the best battery or the most power-efficient processor (or tuning perf to make the device use less power for the same tasks) isn't a goal yet.  Still, I think an hour or two of active use is the most we can hope for here. Everyone comments on how light the device is... a bigger battery would mean more weight. At some point you cross a barrier between more battery life and unusable neck strain."
HoloLens,34hy88,atrich,2,Fri May 1 09:14:24 2015 UTC,"It sounds nutters, but it would be really nice to be able to have external, plug in, battery belt type things for extended use.

The problem is they get bad press when they try to compete against other companies when they try something new. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Apple spends too muchon advertisement lately and (not knowing the numbers) less on R&D... their devices are pretty, yeah… but not as innovative, as they used to be...  The last big throw I can remember was the iPad. (not mentioning the watch on purpose, because I think it´s not innovative. They created a product, to which there was no need. They made the watch obsolete with the first iPhone, now they try to make the iPhone obsolete, by ""reinventing the watch""?)  Microsoft is trying to develop new stuff, trying out new ideas. The Metro UI, while not succesful, it was NEW. And so I believe, that just because the HoloLens has Potential, it doesnt mean, that Microsoft is uncapable of creating a magical product.

HoloLens,34ep46,StopBeingDumb,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:42:10 2015 UTC,"Yea, from what it sounds like, that 100"" screen during the demo is not feasible.

One thing I have seen most commenters/testers say is that they think this FOV for 3d objects will be ""improved"" or ""expanded"".  I'm curious why they think this.  Are they not using a device with similar specs to the ""release"" device? Have they been told the release device will have a bigger FOV?"

From looking at the pictures, it seems there is plenty of space without significantly changing the design.  Now, they are probably using ""off the shelf"" components on this, especially given it is a prototype in limited quantity.

HoloLens,34grtm,agnl,4,Fri May 1 03:53:12 2015 UTC,"But the image itself only covers ~40°, which is a hard limit with optical waveguides that Microsoft and others also faced with this technology (47° at best with the highest refractive index possible for optical glass).   http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/314dfy/fov_will_it_ever_be_perfect/cpz4jwu?context=3   I'm not sure 60° is possible with a small for factor.  With free-form optics a 53.5° diagonal FOV is possible (less for horizontal FOV though I guess), but I'm not sure it would result in a small form factor.  With waveguides (what everyone seems to be using for AR), Microsoft has published a patent where they can obtain 47° at max with a material close to the refractive index limit for optical glass.  But anyway, 60° would be not enough for VR, 80° or more is required for immersion (the limit at which you don't see the stereoscopic window).   http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/2walla/mit_technology_about_magic_leap/copsggc  At 47°, that's like working with a 30 inch computer monitor.  http://carsfov.moritzlawitschka.de/calculate  For me at least, that would be way bigger than my current monitor.

HoloLens,34ga4u,zite00,2,Fri May 1 00:43:48 2015 UTC,"Three very large problems with this as an analogue to HoloLens.  These clearly are highly translucent.  We've heard many many people who've experienced them describe the objects as firmly opaque and almost indistinguishable from ""real"".  These are unlike that.  Second, none of these are pinned to the geometry, as a consequence, they ""float"" aimlessly in space, completely detached from real space.  This is also totally unlike HoloLens has been shown to work.  Each of these is in a fixed window.  Objects (say, the butterfly) are totally obscured by the this fixed square window.  There is significant hardware (the opacity?) and software (the other two) reasons this is totally unlike we've already been told HoloLens is like."
HoloLens,34ga4u,abs159,1 point,Fri May 1 00:54:52 2015 UTC,"couple clarifications   they are pinned to the marker below them and are not floating aimlessly. they do in fact drift because of the software/hardware hololens also has a fixed window. this is the rectangle that people talk about when they say it clips the image. however hololens does not use LED projection so the black is truly black and doesnt show what i am pointing out is that because of the rectangular FOV, the experience is much like this - you are looking into a cropped area in front of you. In the demo at keynote with the big globe, that person was not seeing the entirety. they were experiencing it much like earth demo i have here - parts and pieces of the earth depending on how far away they were   this has big implications for any AR that is up close. first of all your head is the camera , so to move the view down you have to bend your neck. our eyes can just look down, with hololens/moverio you have to bend your neck.   just try this : sit in front of your desk with a piece of paper in front of you. look at the paper. your eyes will look down. with hololens you have to turn your neck down into your chin. hold it there. does that feel good?  update: here is a hololens demo user confirming my suspicions  http://www.reddit.com/r/HoloLens/comments/34c0i0/ama_request_anyone_trying_out_the_hololens_demo/cqtlzpe   1 right in the middle. So it works amazing for holograms about 6-10 ft away, but closer holograms clip quite a bit more than I'd really like.   and more evidence here:  https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/demo.jpg"

HoloLens,34c0i0,zmanx_88,5,Wed Apr 29 23:32:13 2015 UTC,"http://blog.galasoft.ch/posts/2015/04/so-i-tried-the-hololens/ thanks a lot for sharing your experience! so with this limited field of view... is the field of view still good enough that I can scale up a video to the size of my wall to watch tv? Seems like when they did it in the demo, the 'holographic' camera was able to see all of it.. but maybe not so from the users' view"
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,7,Wed Apr 29 23:42:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on how far you are from your wall. The best I've been able to equate the FOV to is a credit card about 2 inches from your nose. It's more square than a credit card, so not quite as wide as that. Although I wear glasses, so I couldn't get the device as close to my eyes as someone who doesn't."
HoloLens,34c0i0,dboxvr,6,Thu Apr 30 02:36:38 2015 UTC,"When you say a credit card two inches from your face, do you mean the area is like holding one credit card in the center of your view 2 inches from your nose. or it's like each eye has a credit card 2 inches from it? The difference is astronomical."
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,7,Thu Apr 30 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah sadly it's a single credit card in the center of your vision. It's really distracting at first, but you adjust pretty quickly and like I said elsewhere, it works really great for holograms 6+ ft away. It's the large holograms up close that it's really distracting."
HoloLens,34c0i0,atrich,5,Thu Apr 30 20:30:41 2015 UTC,Could you comment on whether this is an accurate representation of the FOV?  http://www.reddit.com/r/HoloLens/comments/34ga4u/we_now_know_hololens_uses_2_rectangular_screens/
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,8,Thu Apr 30 23:55:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's pretty close to the FOV. It could be slightly larger, maybe 10-15% larger at most. But the quality is light years better. 0 Light bleeding. And the holograms are opaque, not translucent like in those videos. Oh and 0 lag as well. Where the butterfly video the headset moves and the hologram lags behind in position, yeah with the hololens it doesn't do that. You can swing your head around pretty damned quick and it doesn't jitter, jump, or lag at all."
HoloLens,34c0i0,roocell,1 point,Fri May 1 01:33:24 2015 UTC,I suspect it's the latter (credit card 2inches on eye).  The former wouldn't really work for all the demos they have been showing.
HoloLens,34c0i0,roocell,2,Thu Apr 30 18:01:25 2015 UTC,Take it back - elsewhere in this thread someone mentioned it's one credit card in the middle of your vision. Works well for things 6-10 feet away. But closer ones get clipped.
HoloLens,34c0i0,dboxvr,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:11:29 2015 UTC,"I sure hope so, because it would be terribly disappointing if it were the other way."
HoloLens,34c0i0,G0ldengoose,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:55:36 2015 UTC,Like a postit note 3 inches from your face?
HoloLens,34c0i0,Citizen_Gamer,3,Thu Apr 30 07:59:34 2015 UTC,"Or maybe a poster board, 10 feet from your face?  Or a movie screen, 50 yards from your face?"

HoloLens,34c0i0,ilovegoogleglass,4,Wed May 6 02:45:49 2015 UTC,Was gaze detection relative to your eye or head position?
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,12,Wed Apr 29 23:56:22 2015 UTC,Head position. As far as I could tell there wasn't any detection based on my eyes.
HoloLens,34c0i0,ilovegoogleglass,8,Thu Apr 30 02:34:06 2015 UTC,Were you able to focus on digital objects that had different focal depths?
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,26,Thu Apr 30 02:48:53 2015 UTC,"Incredibly easily. It's nothing like anything I've ever used to view 3d objects before. It was 100% natural watching the objects as if they were literally there in real space. My eyes had no issue focusing on different depths. Best I could tell, I could wear that thing for hours with 0 eye strain."
HoloLens,34c0i0,BI_Joe,12,Thu Apr 30 02:53:28 2015 UTC,"This is so unbelievably huge. It's what I've come to expect by now, but even so I don't get why more news reports aren't making a bigger deal of it. I don't get why Microsoft isn't making a bigger deal of this. You'd think they'd at least add it to the ""how is this different from existing AR and VR technologies"" part of the FAQ. This is not a conventional display technology, not even within the niche of AR glasses, and I don't get why they're letting people think they're just translucent stereoscopic screens when they're clearly more."
HoloLens,34c0i0,BazGibb,10,Thu Apr 30 07:10:49 2015 UTC,"Good point. Apple release a watch where you can't even build custom watch faces and the press are hailing it as the next best thing, while Microsoft show probably the biggest advancement in computing in decades and nary a thing is mentioned."
HoloLens,34c0i0,blueCube1337,1 point,Thu Apr 30 10:15:03 2015 UTC,Completely agree. If the 'holographic projector' allows images to appear at different focal depths then its huge. This isn't the standard microdisplay projected at a set depth stuff of the Epson Moverio or any other display in the market.
HoloLens,34c0i0,chillzatl,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:21:47 2015 UTC,hololens is attached to ever piece of windows 10 marketing that they've done so far and I only expect that to increase. I think your question is why isn't the tech press talking about it more than they are.
HoloLens,34c0i0,BI_Joe,1 point,Fri May 1 22:27:50 2015 UTC,"No, it's not the amount of marketing that I'm puzzled by: Microsoft has been pushing HoloLens a lot and I have no problems with that. The thing that's strange is that they're avoiding mentioning the technical accomplishments that really distinguish the device. I can understand not giving specs, but there's some profound functionality that appears to be present that they're just not advertising (variable focal depth, dark virtual objects, opacity controllable from nearly transparent to nearly opaque)."
HoloLens,34c0i0,ilovegoogleglass,3,Fri May 1 22:33:57 2015 UTC,Also can you comment on the black visor? Did everything look tinted?
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,7,Thu Apr 30 02:56:34 2015 UTC,"A little at first,  but your vision adjusts surprisingly fast. It's probably around 2-3% darker than normal."
HoloLens,34c0i0,lbugnion,7,Thu Apr 30 03:00:42 2015 UTC,I would say head position. The whole experience was a bit of a blur. They did measure my pupils distance before starting the demo so there is a setting on the device for that
HoloLens,34c0i0,RIFT-VR,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:50:08 2015 UTC,"IPD has a lot to do, person-to-person, with how scale is perceived, so I'm glad they're taking that into account."
HoloLens,34c0i0,lbugnion,3,Thu Apr 30 21:28:14 2015 UTC,if you only saw the rectangle when you panned past it but otherwise it was clear than thats great.   did you sense any eye fatigue after using it? would it be something you would put on for an hour or two? say if you were reading or surfing the web?
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,12,Wed Apr 29 23:37:55 2015 UTC,"I did not feel any fatigue and I really liked that I could,look at the person who was walking me through the demo and see her. We do a lot of work for Oculus rift and it's a very ""antisocial"" experience because you are immersed. With HoloLens I felt a lot more sharing with my surroundings and other people in the room. Very different experience"
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,11,Thu Apr 30 02:54:15 2015 UTC,0 eye fatigue for me. There was 0 jitter or shakyness in the holograms. Even when I moved my head really quick everything was positioned perfectly. And I didn't feel like I had any issues with focusing on the holograms as if they were in that exact position in the real world either.
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,3,Thu Apr 30 02:38:05 2015 UTC,thanks for commenting.  did the holograms cover all the area of the inner glass/frame that we see? was there any detectable light on the edges if there was a hologram in the middle or was it all clear except for the image?
HoloLens,34c0i0,notentirelywrong,6,Thu Apr 30 03:06:42 2015 UTC,"No, the visible holographic canvas is roughly the size of a credit card about 2 inches from your nose. 0 light bleed at all."
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,3,Thu Apr 30 03:13:28 2015 UTC,"you say you were glasses. so in my glasses i can clearly look down say at my belly and get a sense of the glasses frames above my line of sight. is that how it was as well?  in that case, if you had a hologram below you did you have to purposefully tilt your head down to see it? this would lead to head strain after a while i imagine"
HoloLens,34c0i0,notentirelywrong,3,Thu Apr 30 03:16:15 2015 UTC,Yeah you had to purposely look directly at any hologram. There's practically 0 peripheral vision of the holograms sadly.
HoloLens,34c0i0,bboyjkang,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:06:40 2015 UTC,yup thats what i thought. its a big failing point IMHO
HoloLens,34c0i0,OneDegree,3,Thu Apr 30 06:17:23 2015 UTC,"My work colleagues are looking at me funny for trying this. That's quite a small FOV though, Is that 1 c/card right in the middle of your face, or 1 for each eye?"
HoloLens,34c0i0,dgmib,6,Thu Apr 30 06:30:11 2015 UTC,"1 right in the middle. So it works amazing for holograms about 6-10 ft away, but closer holograms clip quite a bit more than I'd really like."
HoloLens,34c0i0,lbugnion,2,Thu Apr 30 06:48:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Oh well, I'm sure they'll release something soon on why it is like that.  Makes me wonder though that if they could display the output via the video camera, that you can hijack that and use it via a different media method"
HoloLens,34c0i0,BazGibb,2,Thu Apr 30 07:33:08 2015 UTC,"From reddit user Fredz:   According to their patents a FOV between 36.1° and 47° looks more plausible.   Based on a 40°x40° FOV prediction:   To get the horizontal FOV you can first calculate the width of a 16:9 monitor, then you can calculate the horizontal FOV knowing the width and the distance :   width = 16xdiagonal/sqrt(337).  fov = 2xatan(width/2/distance).    You can first calculate the width from the horizontal FOV and distance, then you can find the diagonal knowing the width and aspect ratio :   width = 2×tan(fov/2)xdistance. (21.84"" for a 40° FOV and 30"" distance) diagonal = sqrt(337xw²/256). (25"" diagonal in this case)    It would be like a 25 inch monitor window that is 30 inches away.  Does the FOV feel like it could be the size of an average computer monitor set-up?  FoV Calculator  http://carsfov.moritzlawitschka.de/"
HoloLens,34c0i0,lbugnion,3,Thu Apr 30 23:12:18 2015 UTC,How opaque do the holograms get?
HoloLens,34c0i0,q_-_p,4,Fri May 1 04:29:57 2015 UTC,"They were pretty solid.  You could still see the walls/surfaces behind them but only barely, and only if you were trying to look at that.  That said, they had us in dimly lit, windowless interior rooms for the demos.  I suspect that in daylight conditions it's a lot harder for the display to block out the ambient light."
HoloLens,34c0i0,dgmib,3,Mon May 4 03:29:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the delay, I was traveling. The demo was both in a well lit room with a cardboard model in a table, and a 3D model added to that, and then in a room with (fake) walls of red brick very much like old buildings in Seattle or SF. The holograms were very opaque, so,much so that I would have tried walking through the fake door if I hadn't known better"

HoloLens,34c0i0,jmanici,12,Tue May 12 04:38:15 2015 UTC,Is text readable to the point that you could use it for email?
HoloLens,34c0i0,ralexand56,4,Thu Apr 30 23:09:06 2015 UTC,"Hands-On Impressions by Tested talks about readability of text, seems like it is readable."
HoloLens,34c0i0,BazGibb,2,Mon May 4 04:40:50 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for even linking the time they talkyd about it. I was intimidated by the 30 minute length of this when it was first posted, but it seems to be a good review so looks like I'll be watching it now."
HoloLens,34c0i0,fish1479,4,Mon May 4 04:45:44 2015 UTC,"Yes & No, In the demo there's only a couple of brief points where they put text on something, and it was a holographic note designed to look like a sign on a wall that could be read from a great distance.    They didn't demo a hologram of a book or a computer screen so I can't say if the resolution is high enough to put readable text on something like that.  But if I was to guess, I'd say probably not."
HoloLens,34c0i0,Passan,3,Mon May 4 03:52:27 2015 UTC,Bummer. Thanks for answering though. I honestly think the practicality of constant use for this thing (for me) will come down to whether text is readable or not. I want constant acess to information without staring at my phone. Hopefully it's possible for resolution to get there in time.
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,2,Mon May 4 04:00:36 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it'll get there in time, though I suspect part of the reason for the narrow FOV is related to the resolution limitations of either the display or the GPU driving it.  A larger FOV would require more pixels to achieve the same pixels per arcsecond.  (Or to put it another way, if they expanded the FOV with the current display/GPU, the maximum perceived resolution of a virtual holographic screen would be lower)"
HoloLens,34c0i0,z0oinks,9,Mon May 4 04:12:00 2015 UTC,"Question for someone who has tried the Hololens, how were the pixels, did you notice them? was the PPI good enough?"
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,18,Thu Apr 30 05:23:57 2015 UTC,"Resolution is good enough. I didn't notice the pixels. Like everybody else, I was a bit disappointed by the field of vision. But positive point, head tracking, gestures & voice recognition worked much better than I expected!  Overall, it felt like final 1st gen hardware. No fatal flaw. Just the limitations that often comes with 1st gen devices.  Another positive point, it worked well with my prescription glasses. And the device was lighter than I had imagined."
HoloLens,34c0i0,ElvisNixon,5,Thu Apr 30 05:57:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the impressions. I wonder what it would take to increase the fov.
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,-4,Thu Apr 30 07:35:06 2015 UTC,"I personally think they won't increase the fov. Because it's untethered and designed to be use when walking about your house/work, having the hologram over your whole field of view would be too dangerous."
HoloLens,34c0i0,ilovegoogleglass,13,Thu Apr 30 09:23:11 2015 UTC,by too dangerous I will assume you mean too awesome.
HoloLens,34c0i0,ralexand56,4,Thu Apr 30 22:39:02 2015 UTC,Insanely excited for this device in gaming applications.

The tech had to reboot and recalibrate the device before we could start (which tool like 30 secs, very impressive). I also had problems moving the visible holographic area down into my central Field of View. At first I felt like I had to look up the whole time. After a minute or two of futzing with it with help from the Tech, we got it adjusted better."
HoloLens,34c0i0,murtokala,6,Thu Apr 30 02:49:15 2015 UTC,Okay so probably some early release bugs
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,10,Thu Apr 30 11:43:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't see it releasing to consumers this year. They're really pushing it hard for industry and scientific research use. I think it's mainly because they know that consumers won't like the FOV constraint. So I'm guessing the first iteration is going to be out of the consumer price range (probably around $1500-2000). They wouldn't answer any of those questions though, so it's hard to say."
HoloLens,34c0i0,dgmib,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:04:51 2015 UTC,I really hope so! The wide FOV is a must for this product to be successful in the consumer market!
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,2,Fri May 1 21:54:03 2015 UTC,Did you make notice how they did the calibration? Assuming it really uses a markerless / beaconless inside-out tracking it must know the origin point from somewhere or else everyone would see the objects at different physical locations.  Was anything virtual attached to a moving physical object?
HoloLens,34c0i0,MGMTtoCS,3,Fri May 1 01:39:11 2015 UTC,I believe they're basically using a more advanced version of this system: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/surfacerecon/
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,2,Fri May 1 02:33:09 2015 UTC,"I would be amazed if that system (or an advanced version of it) was as latency free as you guys say the system was! My guess would be there is something else besides that, but you might very well be right and if so, that's super exciting. Those lighthouses are looking like 90's tech already ;)  Edit: they mentioned they have a dedicated custom chip doing all that work, but it a bit sounded like the current versions might be tethered still to get the raw power to process quickly. But still, even if it's done that way, considering the latency in data transfer back and forth plus computation time, it really would be awesome."
HoloLens,34c0i0,MGMTtoCS,8,Fri May 1 02:54:25 2015 UTC,"Nope, they were not tethered in the current iteration. Got to talk with another Microsoft guy in the line tonight to go watch Avenger's Age of Ultron. He spilled a bit more than he probably should have, but basically he said that the current ""tether"", is literally just for device configuration, launching the apps, and collecting analytics. All the actual graphics, tracking, sound, etc are running 100% on the device at this time as they will in the full production model. He got to play with a different demo: a rc car spawns on a table and you can select any point in the room. Then the car jumps off the table and goes zooming around objects etc to get to the destination you selected. Then there was something with some sort of ball or something that fell and shattered open the floor. He said he got down on his hands and knees and there was this whole view of this ""world"" underneath the floor."
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,2,Fri May 1 05:49:05 2015 UTC,"That's good to hear! Was there anything dynamic in the scene, did any real world objects move that would have had an effect on the virtual ones?"
HoloLens,34c0i0,MGMTtoCS,3,Fri May 1 15:23:05 2015 UTC,"Not in my demo,  but they showed that working on stage with a robot powered by an arduino that emitted a hologram as an avatar."
HoloLens,34c0i0,RIFT-VR,1 point,Fri May 1 15:32:24 2015 UTC,"It was clearly calibrated before I walked into the room.  Other than an adjustment for inter-pupillary distance which they measured in advance and you handed a card with your measurement to the tech when you go to the room.  Now that I think about it, the particular demo they took us through would be relatively forgiving as far as calibration goes.  There wasn't really any point where the exact position of a hologram needed to line up exactly with something physical in the room."
HoloLens,34c0i0,MGMTtoCS,1 point,Mon May 4 03:37:13 2015 UTC,"He literally put the device on, brought up some app on the PC that had a red and blue box, clicked a button and then handed it back to me. It took like 15 secs total."
HoloLens,34c0i0,RIFT-VR,3,Fri May 1 05:44:23 2015 UTC,What was the general impression for the people that tried it? Were people pleasantly surprised? Do you recall anyone displeased with the device?
HoloLens,34c0i0,Vincent__Adultman,16,Thu Apr 30 02:49:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone was super impressed. Only complaint was the same from basically everyone, the FOV is smaller than we had all hoped for. The device was surprisingly comfortable too, even with me wearing my glasses."
HoloLens,34c0i0,jmanici,5,Thu Apr 30 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"That is really good to hear! Very similar to how the press felt a few months back. I remember the MIT review pointing out the narrow FOV as a major weakness..  With this weakness in mind, do you think the Hololens is capable of producing a more immersive experience than our current tools(e.g. 2d/3d tvs, laptops)?"
HoloLens,34c0i0,Vincent__Adultman,8,Thu Apr 30 03:02:18 2015 UTC,Absolutely.  It's like nothing I've ever experienced before. I would wear it everywhere!

I had to ask, because I've heard so many people ripping it to shreds just because they tried it once for 5 minutes at a convention without audio and without their IPD being measured."
HoloLens,34c0i0,techyvrguy,-5,Fri May 1 04:55:44 2015 UTC,"I would say it is closer to Microsoft's Apple Watch than iPhone.  There will be a lot of people who love it and line up on day 1 to but it.  It just don't see it having the wide scale consumer appeal of a smartphone.  Don't get me wrong, it is very cool.  But I think the average person won't find a use for it in everyday life."
HoloLens,34c0i0,Chris_knyfe,11,Thu Apr 30 05:11:53 2015 UTC,"Nope. Apple Watch has nothing impressive or magical. IMO it's as boring as all the android watches released so far.  Hololens, on the contrary, feels like the first step toward a new era. Possibly a post smartphone era. Imagine in 10 years, this thing being the same size as prescription glasses. There would be no reason to want to use a smartphone anymore. We're far from there, as Hololens is still bulky for now (but it feels surprisingly light!)."
HoloLens,34c0i0,my_elo_is_potato,-3,Thu Apr 30 06:09:18 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with your view about the future and what this technology could be in 10 year.  In that way, maybe the Apple Watch is a bad example (although I think you might be overly dismissive of non-head wearable technology).  My comparison was more in the terms of consumer appeal.  I just don't see the average person getting excited about this version of the device or finding an everyday use case for it."
HoloLens,34c0i0,q_-_p,2,Thu Apr 30 13:59:25 2015 UTC,"Right, this version of the device is not suitable to everybody. But as an education tool (see the example of studying the human body in yesterday's keynote), it's ready for use. I think that can really help students and engineers understand complex schematics faster, in 3d. And as a toy for geeks, it's awesome (games, and so on)"
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,2,Thu Apr 30 15:12:04 2015 UTC,"I believe its gonna come down to the applications, in this case the Hololens goes above and beyond the Apple Watch. If developers create a lot of appealing and attractive apps, you will see in increase in interest. I'm sorry to say it but smart watches are pretty much an expensive fad with plenty of unresolved problems like short battery life (the pebble being the exception). As far new innovations smart watches have created, there aren't much but with Hololens there are so much possibilities. But again, developers effort to support the HLens is what will decide its fate."
HoloLens,34c0i0,q_-_p,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:28:33 2015 UTC,"like short battery life   I really wonder if this will be a problem with the HoloLens.  It was surprisingly light and since it does all the computation on the device, I imagine the power requirements aren't trivial.  I would be curious to hear from someone who did the 4 hour session instead of the 10 minute one I did and whether they ran into any battery issues along the way."
HoloLens,34c0i0,lobstersoap,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:03:38 2015 UTC,I can't believe its doing all the rendering for three dimensional objects in that tiny frame.  Really amazing if they've found a way to do that without sucking down battery.

HoloLens,34c0i0,ragamufin,5,Thu Apr 30 14:09:46 2015 UTC,"I was in a group with about a dozen other developers, and not one of us came out of that demo thinking it was gimmicky. It really does blow you away what they can do with this thing. It's application in architecture alone will be revolutionary. Medicine, architecture, engineering and material design. This device has an insane amount of function for these fields. There's a reason NASA is already using it about JPL and their Mars missions."
HoloLens,34c0i0,MGMTtoCS,-9,Thu Apr 30 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"I've worked on cave / ar systems, you can't say this is revolutionary at all.

HoloLens,34c0i0,BullockHouse,8,Thu Apr 30 15:46:45 2015 UTC,"Typical armchair reductionist logic right here.  Concerned with generalizing concepts in principle than actual consumer UX and novelty. You seem to believe the past (less defined) steps of an immersing technological evolution in someway discredits its future trajectory purely because of some consumer tribalistic tendencies you have that put you in this belief that a tech must be perfect to be novel, revolutionary or just downright entertaining.  I work in UI/UX and have been researching UX applications in the context of VR/AR. You claim to work on AR but really come across as having a pinhole sized appreciation for its potential future applications. Nobody is calling Hololense perfect, but those who have ACTUALLY used it are telling you they had a novel and compelling user experience while you fall back on your preconceptions as some way to discredit an individuals authentic reaction.  Being revolutionary does not mean being the first to use the tech. it means being the first to make the tech relevant to culture in a functional way.  User experience is everything. You have no idea what you're saying, and that's tragic."

The only thing is that most of that stuff is in a home/office setting.  I can't really see someone walking down the street using it due to weight, battery life, etc.  I think of it as more of a home/office piece, but man, oh man!  And this is just the first version.

HoloLens,34c0i0,ragamufin,5,Fri May 1 05:09:13 2015 UTC,"you really don't notice it. The experience just becomes all a blur. After a couple of minutes with the device your brain just stops realizing there's a helmet there and everything. It's so quick and easy to do the air tap, that you wouldn't even realize that your hand is missing. In fact, chances are you won't raise your hand all the way into the FOV box that the holograms are in. I know it sounds like it should be aweful, but by some weird magic it just works, and works amazingly well."

HoloLens,34c0i0,Nalbandian1990,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:29:34 2015 UTC,The top complaint by far was the limited FOV.  Other than that though everyone I talked to was pretty much blown away.
HoloLens,34c0i0,seiggy,3,Mon May 4 03:38:42 2015 UTC,"How transparent are the images?  The demo videos they show are almost as if you can't see through objects (where intended).  Is it close to that, or is it always obvious you're seeing an overlaid image rather than something actually in the room?  How stable are images pinned to real surfaces?  Any jitter/wobble?"
HoloLens,34c0i0,FizixMan,12,Thu Apr 30 10:47:19 2015 UTC,"I was amazed at how absolutely solid it was. Near 0 translucency when they wanted it. 0 jitter, even when you moved your head quickly. It's way more stable than the Oculus or any other VR headset."

HoloLens,34c0i0,Summons,6,Thu Apr 30 17:09:46 2015 UTC,"They've got a DK2 here at build with a couple demos that I got to try. It's awesome, but the lag is noticeable after using the hololens."
HoloLens,34c0i0,murtokala,2,Thu Apr 30 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"According to Doc_Ok's write-up, the virtual objects presented by the Hololens lag behind the environment when a user moves their head swiftly. (Obviously the environment has no lag because it is simply being viewed directly through the visor.)  The 'motion-to-photon' latency of the DK2 can be as low as 20ms.  Do you mean to say that the Hololens' virtual objects lagged less than the full rendered environment latency in a DK2 demo? (If you happen to know what demo you were using or what harder it was running on, that would be helpful.)"
HoloLens,34c0i0,Summons,3,Fri May 1 22:24:32 2015 UTC,The demo I tried was some kinect v2 demo at the ISS climbing around in space. Not sure what hardware they were running on. Some mid-tower desktop. This was the demo: http://www.gizmag.com/earthlight-tech-demo-iss-vr/36330/  I just read his write-up. I didn't notice the lag at all. I tried moving my head as quick as I was comfortable jumping back and forth between two holograms in the room and I didn't notice any jittering or dragging of holograms. The dragging in the DK2 was much more noticeable.
HoloLens,34c0i0,camisado_,5,Sat May 2 15:49:31 2015 UTC,Have you tried the Vive?  I ask because I'd be very surprised if microsoft was able to surpass active IR photodiode tracking with an as-yet-unnamed markerless tracking tech.
HoloLens,34c0i0,Summons,3,Thu Apr 30 18:30:12 2015 UTC,"Haven't had a chance to try that yet. They've got the Oculus DK2 here for some other demos on the DirectX team, so I got to give that a shot. The other VR headsets I have tried are much older tech from Sony and some of other big players back about 10 years ago. So probably not the best comparisons there.  Pretty sure the way they're doing it is a combination of several sensors that are on the device, including the stereoscopic IR cameras, accelerometers, etc."
HoloLens,34c0i0,Octoplow,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:29:12 2015 UTC,"One thing they could be running a modified version of Windows that allows for straighter route to the display and removes any lag that is unavoidable at the moment. Like what Samsung has done with GearVR, kernel optimizations to make it work at much lower latency than DK2."
HoloLens,34c0i0,Summons,4,Fri May 1 01:31:32 2015 UTC,Did they mention anything of trying to increase the FOV (for the consumer product)? Seeing that's the only 'complaint' I read about from people who used it. Or that they are aware of this 'problem' and what to improve/fix it. Thanks for the answers anyway :)
HoloLens,34c0i0,camisado_,5,Thu Apr 30 05:29:23 2015 UTC,They weren't really allowed to answer any questions.  Everything was kinda off limits.
HoloLens,34c0i0,Summons,4,Thu Apr 30 06:03:28 2015 UTC,"Were you using similar prototype units that the reporters used when the Hololens was originally revealed (like here where reporters where wearing computer units on them) or did they basically hand you the actual display unit. Basically what I'm asking, have they already got the hardware more or less going in the form factor they've been advertising with and showing off?"

HoloLens,34c0i0,ilovegoogleglass,4,Fri May 1 01:42:05 2015 UTC,"I put my hands in front of the object but it didn't obscure it. I didn't put my hands over the sensor itself if that's what you meant.  The FOV was decent but not huge, like a business card 2 inches over each eye like most people reported.  For small holograms I was fine, but huge holograms it was initially annoying but you forgot about it after a few seconds when your concentrating on specific objects."
HoloLens,34c0i0,bestnicknameever,1 point,Fri May 1 06:39:38 2015 UTC,How important do you think FoV actually is for the device? Many people are acting like it is a show-stopper and is the death knell for the device - what are your thoughts on this?
HoloLens,34c0i0,shadyendless,5,Fri May 1 07:31:00 2015 UTC,"I thought it was acceptable.  If your thinking this is a holodeck replacement, its far from that.  For the purpose of seeing some holograms and manipulating them I think it would be fine.  If this were to be used in a way like the Illumniroom for Xbox, the FOV would be acceptable at a typical distance from the TV you would normally play at.    I was told by a journalist that the prototype they used back in January to demo gave a bigger FOV.  I think if they can keep the FOV hype in check this would be a successful device, but I think most consumers are go to have unreal expectations."

However, when you started to manipulate the object you were not focusing on the edges, just the content in the middle.  Its was like watching TV, you know there is more content beyond the edges but you don't care to much because your focusing on what is in view."

HoloLens,34c0i0,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:18:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't notice any lag.  If you moved/turned your head rapidly (faster than one normally would), the holographic object would appear to wiggle slightly because the display couldn't move it back into place quite as fast as you could move your head... but if you weren't trying to trick it, you couldn't tell.  That said the FOV is quite narrow, you couldn't move your head far before the object disappeared entirely because it was outside the frame."

Knowing what the user's body is doing (and not just the bits that are in the HMD's FOV) will make for some neat opportunities - whether you're talking about stuff that's taking place in the same room, or remotely."

HoloLens,34b88i,cyrux004,9,Wed Apr 29 19:37:34 2015 UTC,I got to try it out today and it is actually pretty awesome. The only problem I had was FOV. The resolution and image quality is as you see in the videos.
HoloLens,34b88i,tomtom1229,3,Wed Apr 29 22:24:46 2015 UTC,"I'm curious how the resolution works. How clear are images being displayed? Is anything blurry, pixelated etc? I'm more curious about stretching video as shown in the video posted. Obviously the resolution of the video itself is Dependant too, but let's say the video being played was 8k quality (not taking hardware specs to playback) if you stretched that video to a huge window, would you visually be seeing the video in 8k?"

HoloLens,34b88i,tomtom1229,2,Thu Apr 30 04:20:32 2015 UTC,Was FoV enough of a letdown to prevent you from wanting to purchase one?
HoloLens,34b88i,Diknak,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:51:59 2015 UTC,I probably would still buy it. I think I would need to play with it a little because I wasn't allowed to adjust it however I wanted and I think that could have helped the FOV problem.
HoloLens,34b88i,tomtom1229,2,Thu Apr 30 02:23:01 2015 UTC,The headset looks bulky and uncomfortable. Did you find this to be the case? Could you wear this all day long without issue?
HoloLens,34b88i,no_flex,5,Thu Apr 30 02:10:25 2015 UTC,It's actually surprisingly light and comfy. You forget it's on. They have a lot of cushion on the headwear part.

HoloLens,34b88i,ilovegoogleglass,3,Thu Apr 30 02:30:21 2015 UTC,From your perspective they are just objects in space so it is just like regular focusing.

HoloLens,34b1wx,bestnicknameever,24,Wed Apr 29 18:51:55 2015 UTC,"I was fortunate enough to test the HoloLens a few hours ago. It was incredible. I will say, the screen was a bit too small so it wasn't very immersive -- it was very apparent that you had a set of goggles on as you had to line everything up perfectly and even then you could see past the square screen.  A few notes:  - The air tap gesture worked great, but it definitely might have been scripted as there was a tech pressing buttons behind me. - Interacting with the model in 3D using the computer mouse was amazing and definitely not scripted as you could interact with anything you wanted to.  - It's real. It's so so so so real. I was skeptical, and I still have a hard time believing what I experienced, but holy shit it's real. - It is slotted for a Windows 10 launch timeframe  Hope this helps!  Edit: if anyone has any questions I'd be more than happy to answer them. I might be a bit delayed but I'll do my best."
HoloLens,34b1wx,Klar1ty,7,Wed Apr 29 22:17:41 2015 UTC,"How small is small? If you were to hold your hands out at arms length and put your hands on either side of the screen area, how far apart would they be?"
HoloLens,34b1wx,BI_Joe,7,Wed Apr 29 22:27:17 2015 UTC,"Uhmmmm so it's a little tough to say since it was a while ago so don't quote me on it, but I would estimate it was probably ~2"" tall by ~3"" wide. I would say it was about the size of a credit card. The screen was only maybe an inch from your face"
HoloLens,34b1wx,Klar1ty,3,Wed Apr 29 22:34:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Which demos did they show you?  I'm still curious about this screen effect. Do you perceive it as a transparent glass screen of that size that you look through to see holograms?  Edit: Also, a 2"" x 3"" window that's only an inch from your face is technically a pretty incredible FOV (that would be on the order of 90 degrees by 115). On the other hand, if it's an inch from the HoloLens and not your pupil that could make a big difference; it's hard to estimate distances like that accurately."
HoloLens,34b1wx,BI_Joe,4,Wed Apr 29 22:49:36 2015 UTC,"For the demo, see the response I gave to someone else a few minutes ago :).   that is the best description of it I have heard. You have the wrap around glass portion, and on the inside I perceived it as a glass screen you had to look through in order to see the holograms.   I'm sure the actual tech behind that screen is  insane, I don't want to make it sound like that's all I took away from the demo. I guess I was just knocking the screen because it lived up to all the hype in all other aspects. I guess when you see the videos they're careful to stand back very far with the camera man and show relatively small objects. The videos are also square, whereas our vision is obviously not."
HoloLens,34b1wx,Klar1ty,3,Wed Apr 29 23:00:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response; it sounds encouraging, though I hope we get details about the FOV since that seems to be one of the only limiting factors for the device. Now to wait for several hundred other impressions..."
HoloLens,34b1wx,BI_Joe,2,Wed Apr 29 23:11:31 2015 UTC,Can we get a better measurement of field of view?  Use your monitor as an example.  What size is it?  How far away from it must you be before the FOV is about the same?
HoloLens,34b1wx,GrayManTheory,4,Fri May 1 04:03:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm also really interested in the fov, but I imagine the numbers are hard to estimate. If it's not annoying could you try answering these?    Do the images take up the entire area of the glass they appear on or are they a little square in the middle?    2.Was it like looking through a pair of reading glasses where most of your fov is filled but some periphery isn't, or is it much smaller than that?    If you made a screen on a wall 6 feet away as big as it could be without getting cut off, how large would it be? Bigger or smaller than a 50 inch tv?   If you had one, would it replace your tv for normal solo watching from a sheer size perspective? What about by quality of image and convenience?    Thanks in advance!"
HoloLens,34b1wx,djfurious,3,Thu Apr 30 01:16:15 2015 UTC,"It's not at all annoying, I'm happy to answer questions.    they appear on a small square in the middle of the glasses. It felt like there was a credit card sized screen about an inch or two away from my face.  guess it depends what type of glasses. I honestly don't think the display extended into my peripheral vision at all. You actually had to make sure to focus directly towards the center of the device in order to see the holograms I really don't feel as if I could give you an answer to this. My experience was very much with close up objects as I was in a small hotel room, so I don't want to give you an incorrect answer.  It wouldn't replace my current television. I don't feel it was comfortable enough to keep it on my head for an extended period of time like when relaxing and watching a movie. I think the video playing scenario in the keynote was a pretty neat gimmick, but at least until the FOV is increased I couldn't see it being used reliably for that situation. I mean, just the fact that they had to measure my pupillary distance before I could use the device speaks to its inconvenience. It absolutely has its applications though, I just don't think a television replacement is the one. As for the picture quality, it's tough to tell since I only interacted with computer generated models, but overall it actually looked very good."
HoloLens,34b1wx,Klar1ty,2,Thu Apr 30 05:56:36 2015 UTC,Re:#4 inter-pupillary distance  They've said the final device will do that without intervention (ie: auto measure.)
HoloLens,34b1wx,abs159,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:21:54 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, I just felt it spoke to the convenience of the device. I probably should have mentioned that though :)"
HoloLens,34b1wx,Klar1ty,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"Hey,   Thanks for all of the answers. One more question, would you say this is a pretty accurate depiction of the FOV? Was there more or less of your vision covered? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKhqY856zB0  Did the Hololens cut things off in the same way? Were the edges of the fov as clear as this?"
HoloLens,34b1wx,djfurious,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:42:28 2015 UTC,"Hmm. The FOV was definitely larger than that. It was the same dimensions, but it felt larger than that because it was fairly close to your face. It did cut things off in a similar way, and yeah I believe the edges were as clear as that, if not even more so. I wouldn't really have noticed the FOV cutting out if not for the holograms being too large to display on the screen. I'm not sure if I answered your questions or not, please let me know if I didn't!"

HoloLens,34b1wx,andrewrenn,2,Thu Apr 30 02:56:37 2015 UTC,so you are saying that you see the square/rectangle area of the screen? its not like blended in? secondly i need a better desc of the FOV. hows the resolution? what demos did you go through?
HoloLens,34b1wx,setoman,7,Wed Apr 29 22:40:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly. For instance, when looking at large models they will cut out making it very obvious where the screen ends. You'll have to look down in order to see the rest of the model, even though you otherwise have a perfect view of that area. I'm not sure what the resolution was, but I was not able to distinguish between pixels and it was all very crisp. The scenario I went through was essentially a construction scenario, similar to the one demoed in the keynote.   It's tough to explain with written text, but basically I could interact with 3D models in sketchup and view them in 3D, and then render the building in first person view and see what it would look like. Then I could view the inside of the buildings, see potential construction problems (beams blocking a doorway) etc. You could view the building schematics in basically Xray vision and look at the walls and see all the plumbing and electrical running through the walls. Everything snapped to the wall perfectly. What was crazy is you could be using the mouse on the computer, and essentially keep dragging until it's off the screen and the cursor is in 3D. You could then interact with the models using 3 dimensional space and it would reflect the changes back in sketchup."
HoloLens,34b1wx,Klar1ty,2,Wed Apr 29 22:52:01 2015 UTC,How translucent are the holograms?
HoloLens,34b1wx,um3k,13,Wed Apr 29 22:49:08 2015 UTC,"surprisingly hardly at all. There was an image being overlaid on a brick wall and I couldn't see the brick wall behind the image at all. Where other holograms were more translucent. So it appears to be able to have translucent or opaque holograms within the developer's design. I was actually very impressed how opaque the holograms were. The videos they show really do accurately represent the brightness, clarity, and opaqueness of the holograms."
HoloLens,34b1wx,seiggy,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:46:06 2015 UTC,"The videos they show really do accurately represent the brightness, clarity, and opaqueness of the holograms.   That is insane. I really need to try this technology for myself."
HoloLens,34b1wx,atrich,2,Fri May 1 00:01:14 2015 UTC,"That was the most surprising thing for me, well that and the fact that the ""lag"" that's shown in the videos, doesn't exist at all on the headset. If you watch the live stage demos with the second camera view, you know how everything is a bit jumpy and laggy (like 100-200ms of visible lag). It's 0 on the actual headset. It blew my mind because I expected lag like the stage demos or like the Oculus Rift DK2."
HoloLens,34b1wx,seiggy,5,Fri May 1 01:31:16 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the model being viewed. Certain holograms were just building blueprints rendered on the wall which you could see through, where as others (such as a 3D building model) i honestly couldn't see through at all."
HoloLens,34b1wx,Klar1ty,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:54:38 2015 UTC,"Did the display cut into your periphery, even if it was a little bit?"
HoloLens,34b1wx,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:47:32 2015 UTC,I think the display stopped short of peripheral vision territory. Take a credit card and hold it an inch or two from your eyes -- that's what I feel is the best indication of the size of the screen

No words where lost on Bluetooth… Virtual keyboard? At least on a tablet, i´m still hammering my fingers against glass, and people already complain a lot about that.  So I see two options:   Like we saw in the Onsight demo, you can use your PC, to browse with the mouse across the landscape in the hololens. I assume that works also with the Keyboard. Much more voice control than expected. Cortana will become very useful here maybe. But How will it work in other languages? Cortana in German is much harder to use…    What do you guys think about that?"
HoloLens,34b1wx,Mega_Nerd,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:09:28 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this. Why not type with a virtual keyboard? You don't have to have it anywhere specific. Although, now that I think about it you would have to have it in your field of view, and since I don't look down at my typing, I wonder how accurate that would be. I'm guessing we're going to rely more on voice commands and bluetooth. But that doesn't rule out being able to sit down at a Windows 10 PC and maybe having a feature to use the keyboard attached to it, if they're on the same network or something."

HoloLens,34b1wx,BI_Joe,2,Wed Apr 29 19:05:24 2015 UTC,"Going back to watch the presentation again, I noticed two spots where either the tracking or positioning didn't quite work and caused the hologram to ""jump"" a small amount to the left. Other than that, I haven't found any real glaring issues...yet."
HoloLens,34b1wx,Shooob,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:24:50 2015 UTC,The tracking on the robot was jumpy. Room tracking is really solid.

HoloLens coming to Unity (yet still in alpha), 100 production models being tested out right now, pseudo hardware breakdown, and dev sessions & workshops happening during the course of this week.   Edit: HoloLens is confirmed to be at E3 2015!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We're almost there!"
HoloLens,34b1wx,BigNiko47,2,Wed Apr 29 21:55:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think so quite yet. MS wants developers to start ""thinking"" about apps to develop for it but they're still not comfortable with actually giving it to them, and you don't need Unity for that as ""all holograms are universal apps and all universal apps can be made as holograms."" So if they have the units and framework, why not put them in the hands of the developers to start building the ecosystem? Hopefully the only reason is to continue to raise hype and it's not due to some technical or supply-chain limitation."
HoloLens,34b1wx,BigNiko47,2,Wed Apr 29 22:08:41 2015 UTC,"confirmed at E3 doesnt mean release date though… but I agree, that we might be much closer than thought before :)"

The only way I can see around this would be pairing with another PC, using it to run the most intensive hardware software and using the HoloLens as the output."

Netflix, Facebook, and Valve are also on my speculative shortlist (and I know two of them are direct VR competitors, but I think it's possible that they will partner with Microsoft in some capacity). I think there's a reasonable chance that one of the organizations involved will showcase a medical application or something similarly non-consumer-facing. NASA may also be part of this, since we already know they have early access."

Edit: talks that specifically mention HoloLens in the description:   ""Use New Motion and Effects Features to Captivate Users and Truly Bring Your App to Life"" (3-737) ""Bring Fluid, Responsive, and Highly Scalable UI Experiences to Your Universal Windows Apps with the New Visual Layer""  (2-672) ""Case Studies of HoloLens App Development"" (2-744)   There are also a number of talks that are tentatively titled and set to update after the keynote. I expect at least one of these to be Holographic related (edit: I was wrong; they did not turn out to be HoloLens sessions, unfortunately.)  Other things of interest:   Building Universal Windows Games with Unity (2-648) (""write Unity games that target multiple device types and form factors using the Universal Windows Platform"") Harnessing the Full Power of Input in Universal Windows Apps (3-622) (""The Universal Windows Platform opens up a new world of inputs across devices running Windows.  We’ll explore those input possibilities, as well as dive into some of the more powerful and flexible APIs for Input like Pointer, GestureRecognizer, and CoreInput."") Deep Dive into XAML and .NET Universal Windows App Development (2-790) Cortana Extensibility in Universal Windows Apps (2-691) Developing 3D Printing Apps and Services in Windows 10 (2-718) Building Rich, Contextually Aware Universal Windows Apps Using Sensors (2-735) Vision APIs: Understanding Images in Your App (2-748) A Studio in the Palm of Your Hand: Developing Audio and Video Creation Apps for Windows 10 (3-634) (Not at all holographic related, but I'm almost as excited for this as anything HoloLens.) More sessions about universal apps, cross-platform development, deployment, XAML, etc.   I'm still optimistic. Worst case scenario, we still get info about the input APIs and case studies about developing for HoloLens."

HoloLens,3436tq,ilovegoogleglass,3,Tue Apr 28 01:39:19 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that almost all the sessions are about Windows 10 as a whole and Windows 10 will run on just about anything. 80% of all their sessions are about universal apps or leveraging them, and Universal apps are Hololens apps. The sessions are about Windows 10 as whole which include HoloLens, Xbox One, MS band, IOT, WP, and PC.  I'm pretty sure they will have a Xbox One, PC, WP, HoloLens Dev kit on-hand for all sessions.   I don't think there's a need (even though it would be great) to have many HoloLens specific sessions especially since most likely all the others will reference/demonstrate in some way. That HoloLens specific session will detail the design principles and share experiences across three Microsoft organisations (most likely from Xbox, OSG, and MDG).   BTW I'm betting that they'll announce a $800 Hololens dev kit after the show available for non-attendees. Still got my coins on Hololens will be the free giveaway."

(I'm a bot)     A new flagship Lumia won't be available until Windows 10 is available on phones, but that might not stop Microsoft from detailing some of its hardware ideas for the future of Lumia - in particular, how Windows 10 will work on bigger phones or 7-inch tablets.  With Microsoft preparing at least four new Lumia devices for Windows 10, we expect to hear some details of what unique features Windows 10 will enable.

HoloLens,346smw,Riekopo,5,Tue Apr 28 19:26:46 2015 UTC,I think you might not fully understand its feature set. Imagine if every device in your home offered a rich ui like this  Even though you can't cook Your wife on vacation can walk you through cooking any delicious meal you want. Highlighting every item you need to add to the pot.  You can disassemble and reassemble your car engine.  These are common use cases.  When it grows in popularity it would blossom from a crosspollination of ideas like mobile apps did. So yeah. It's ugly but it's not dead on arrival.

HoloLens,33xf8f,coolio777,6,Sun Apr 26 15:49:53 2015 UTC,Way too early for a huge marketing push. That should come close to the time when you're going to ask the customer to pull out his/her wallet to buy the product.
HoloLens,33xf8f,ralexand56,2,Sun Apr 26 16:36:33 2015 UTC,Microsoft's past marketing efforts for its other products has not been very good. The last thing we need is for Microsoft to ruin another product because of marketing failure.
HoloLens,33xf8f,ralexand56,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:42:13 2015 UTC,"Marketing isn't their problem, giving customers compelling use cases for their products is. This involves compelling hardware and compelling software. A product like the iPhone would have succeeded if apple hadn't spent a dime on marketing at launch because the media would have sold it on every morning show etc. I believe the same will happen with the hololens."
HoloLens,33xf8f,abs159,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:42:16 2015 UTC,Agreed.  They'll do mass-market awareness-type advertising when people can buy the device.

Needs to be something that people would use instead of just trying out once), plus in addition to new apps a decent selection of existing apps would also help (Spotify, Facebook, Snapchat, etc). After those hurdles have been met then marketing the device should receive full focus in my eyes.   Apologies for the lack of formatting but I'm typing this on my mobile."
HoloLens,33xf8f,SimpleWireFree,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:22:38 2015 UTC,As we get closer to the fall of 2015 you will see more and more about it in the news.

Having a hard time seeing how this could be immersive thus compelling. Wish MS would be more honest in their presentations by showing that rectangle instead of these full fov presentations they show in the demo videos. Even the live demo didn't show that rectangle. Maybe I'm missing something here.
HoloLens,33vmi9,ralexand56,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:31:44 2015 UTC,we just dont know what the FOV is like. from the patents it seems its much more than just 1 projector on each side of the eye.
HoloLens,33vmi9,hololeo,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:39:57 2015 UTC,"My thesis is that they're using two LCOS microdisplays configured to an optical system that creates the images. There's also a virtual focus adjuster that works conjunction with the iris tracker to change the focal point of the display at a given time. The lenses can be really close to yours eyes because of this. The closer the lens are to your eyes, the greater the FOV is.  I'll have a write-up explaining this in the future."

HoloLens,33ix0r,TheTechTheorist,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"A CPU or HPU is not a sensor. What costs 250 grand is the spinning lidar sensor on top of the car. Its like a 100,000x more powerful kinect."
HoloLens,33ix0r,setoman,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:42:41 2015 UTC,"There still has to be a system to process the data that the sensor collects to map out where objects are, will be, and should be in relation to each other.  It is my understanding that the hpu does this much more efficiently than a cpu.  I think it is an interesting thought. But I don't know much about it"
HoloLens,33ix0r,visgc,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:52:37 2015 UTC,"You aren't completely wrong about a dedicated computer vision chip (i.e. the non-Microsoft name for an HPU) being something that could lead to significant cost savings+higher efficiency on the compute side of much of the hard parts of self driving cars.  When you're talking about a device as large and expensive as a car, putting in a custom processor isn't going to be a huge cost.  The expensive part of a self driving car though isn't the computer vision compute--it's the actual sensors and the software that does the CV (and there's only so much you'd want to put into hardware on that front).  I think that consumer grade dedicated CV chips will probably trickle up into higher end CV applications, just because the math involved is embarrassingly parallel and specialized/doesn't run well on a CPU and only sorta runs well on a GPU."
HoloLens,33ix0r,Mhibb,0,Fri Apr 24 19:48:06 2015 UTC,"I think the Google car sensor cost is more to do with the sensor hardware itself, and less about the processor. Particularly with a car, you are not limited to a very small form factor, you could easily a processor the size of a top end GPU because the car has room and enough power to supply it.   The MS HPU on the other hand is about providing high processing capability in a very small, low power consumption form factor because they're limited to something that fits on glasses"
HoloLens,33ix0r,AUGA3,-1,Thu Apr 23 16:24:34 2015 UTC,"Think about it.    Microsoft has show a floating animations in a believable way on a display.   Google has to get this thing from running over babies.    Which company's product do you think is going to:   make it calculate 1,000,000x faster  make its sensors detect objects 100x farther and faster spend billions on to get it right to prevent losing billions in multiple lawsuits   I don't think Google is overstating their hardware costs.  It costs that much because it is very specialized hardware that cant fuck up.  Cost is not an issue.  Now in 10 years time that price will drop down to a reasonable car price, but the HoloLens consumer HPU isn't going to replace it soon."
HoloLens,33ix0r,Summons,2,Wed Apr 22 23:04:31 2015 UTC,"I was just saying that the HPU is designed for processing data more specific to this task then the CPU, and that its architecture might be better than a CPU for the task, assuming its not marketing fluff.  But I asked if this was reasonable idea, so no criticism to you for saying that."

I didn't see the differences at first either, but looking back at the FAQ as it was first posted there are some new questions.  The new questions are:   How can I see holograms mixed with my real world with Microsoft HoloLens?  How can I interact with holograms using Microsoft HoloLens?  How is this different from existing AR and VR technologies?  Who will benefit most from Microsoft HoloLens?    Some of these ""new"" questions have been there for quite a while, but this article was probably prompted by an email that just went out to people in the Windows Insider program mentioning that the FAQ had been updated."

HoloLens,33a6iz,ralexand56,1 point,Tue Apr 21 05:42:40 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence about this. MS is doing a great job keeping their cards close to the chest again. The only hint that gives me hope is that NASA is getting the HoloLens sometime in July, and I don't think either NASA or MS wants it to be the wired contraption that was shown to the press in January. I think, at the very least, they'll get an early version of the development kit (if MS goes the devkit route), with an agreement that they'll get each subsequent version as well. So the question is, can MS release a consumer version in October, after the devkit in July? I think they could but if they're going to release in the third quarter, they might as well push it to late November/early December for Christmas shopping hype."
HoloLens,33a6iz,Shooob,3,Tue Apr 21 13:47:07 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I think people are overestimating the ""Windows 10 time frame"" jargon going around. They're showcasing this in a very polished manner, they have a pre-production model on hand for crying out loud. All in all they've could've just shown a dev dairy within the Hololens lab showcasing the prototypes and explaining their vision that way. They actually want this to be a product. There's rumors about Win 10 launching in late July which gives some weight to a later 2015 release. If this was years off they wouldn't have been so secretive on the prototypes and information.   Devs already have dev kits too."

I am a C# developer (not in games), and I suspect that the Unity/Unreal etc. announcements will play into HoloLens info given at Build.  Now, I would not be doing this as part of my day job. If anything, it would be a hobby project, maybe a KickStarter or something like that.   What are the chances of some little indie guy like me getting my hands on a devkit any time soon?

HoloLens,337fd6,BI_Joe,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:57:05 2015 UTC,Cool way of displaying holography on a 2d plane.
HoloLens,336py3,hololeo,5,Mon Apr 20 01:34:58 2015 UTC,it seems to describe a kind of 'holographic overlay' on a surface to provide user instructions on how to do gestures to use the holographic UI.   is it also describing a system that can produce holograms to the naked eye?  /u/BI_Joe?
HoloLens,336py3,BI_Joe,6,Mon Apr 20 01:38:37 2015 UTC,"Preemptive tl;dr: yes, it's describing a system that can produce holograms to the naked eye.  Hey, a username mention. My initial impression is that this is describing a system that overlays a literal hologram (in the old-school visible to the naked eye sense) over an input device. The figures show a holographic overlay on a Surface keyboard, with the holograms being illuminated by a light source on the Surface. These holograms are probably static and not programmable, instead serving as guides for gestural input. I'm still looking at the patent though.  Edit 1: Okay, we're definitely talking ""real"" holograms overlaid on a touch surface (with that input device intended to be connected to a next-gen Surface tablet judging from the figures). On the point of the holograms being static versus dynamic the patent says this:   Additionally, a single holographic recording layer may be configured to record multiple holographic images that may be addressed by illumination from different angles, different wavelengths, and so on. This allows the hologram to support multiple colors and even support dynamic output by switching light sources. For example a green track-pad icon could have the buttons go red when ""touched"" to provide user feedback.   So you can have a single holographic overlay show a few different holograms, but the holograms are still far from fully programmable. The patent also discusses selectively turning off parts of holograms and having multiple swappable holographic overlays.  Edit 2: This patent doesn't actually involve an HMD at all. It's purely about sticking holograms onto various devices and selectively illuminating holograms. Again ""hologram"" in this context refers to a three-dimensional image formed by the interference of light beams from a coherent light source. This is obviously very, very cool but it is important to stress that this does not appear to be capable of showing arbitrary holograms, only holograms that have been captured on the recording medium in advance (see an explanation of holography if you're confused). The holographic overlays are transparent and the visibility of the holograms are controllable by the associated computing device (tablet or phone).

Edit 4: VentureBeat article."
HoloLens,336py3,BI_Joe,2,Mon Apr 20 02:29:27 2015 UTC,great work! as always :)  so what is the value in such a thing? as they describe it it seems like a marketing gimic to attract attention to the devices at point of sale. i can imagine you walk into staples and see the new surface with windows 10 'now with holograms' and when you look over it you see a hologram. well. ok.   there must be more to it than that.   btw. seems VentureBeat should hire you for technical review cause their article is way off
HoloLens,336py3,BI_Joe,2,Mon Apr 20 06:37:49 2015 UTC,"The VentureBeat article seems pretty accurate to me, maybe I didn't explain that aspect well. It looks looks the intended purpose of this is to work with gesture controls. You'll have something like a Kinect or Intel RealSense camera watching the area you're interacting with to enable gestures. Then these holograms are used to make it more obvious how those gestures work.  One of the big problems with hand tracking input is that users don't have a good sense for how waving around maps to the virtual environment. This solves that by letting you show a 3D piano, cursor, game controller, etc. The holograms themselves have minimal interactivity, but they can have basic state changes that could be activated when the hand tracking system observes contact with part of the hologram.  The thing behind the hologram can be a touch or pressure sensitive pad instead of a keyboard and that can be combined with a screen, so in the most elaborate claim you have a pressure sensitive pad with a conventional 2D screen on it and a swappable hologram on top of that with holograms capable of appearing either in front or below the pad and finally hand tracking captures input in the area above the pad. They don't go into many details of how many distinct holograms they can cram into one overlay, but if they have fine control over which holographs are visible then even having only a couple distinct layers could enable crazy programmable effects. Just imagine having a couple grids of holographic voxels at different depths that you could turn on or off individually.  At this stage, it seems a little gimmicky. The thing it reminds me of the most is the music cover which is basically a reskinned keyboard. The difference with this idea is that the skin is 3D and somewhat dynamic. The more precision they get in selectively showing layered holograms, the closer this gets to a general purpose holographic display. Even as a gimmick, it's a hell of a gimmick."

Software and a killer app is also critical.  We should have more information in a few days to scope this out a bit better.  Kinect did well because it was fairly cheap and was cool, but the lack of good software/killer app made it blah after a while.  I think people are a bit jaded by that so they need to have some killer software that makes people really want it from the start."

HoloLens,330v4c,sirdomino,3,Sun Apr 19 01:02:07 2015 UTC,"I find it very unlikely he had this type of insight of the 'base model', whatever that is.  They got information locked down on this and a Microsoft evangelist or sales person will not have this information yet.  I know several Microsoft employees and a few MS evangelists, they generally are not privy to controlled information unless its critical they know about it.  This rep you speak of probably just speculated on his part about it.    I got the impression there was going to just be one model on release, but that remains to be seen."
HoloLens,330v4c,Summons,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:12:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, I would think that it would be in their best interest to just release a single model.  I did not ask him for details but I would assume that they may have a 64gb, 128gb, 256gb, and 512gb models possibly.  Or even a WIFI only version and a 4G/Cellular version.  The reason for this approach may be to allow a lower barrier to entry for consumers who want a hololens but can not afford to pay for a loaded device.  I am wondering if they may take a similar path as they do with their Windows Surface Tablets though?"
HoloLens,330v4c,sirdomino,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:19:24 2015 UTC,"I'd be surprised if they release that many versions. I'm thinking they'll have ""consumer"" and ""enterprise/industrial"" versions, the later having more memory and possibly faster CPU for a premium price. I'm not sure about the 4G/Cellular part. As much as I'd like it, so far MS has been careful not to show outdoor/public use of the HoloLens, concentrating instead with home & office environments, both of which cover the WiFi aspects. Either way, it's easy and common enough to pair with a cell phone for WiFi sharing anyhow."

Right now I could see it being amazing for gaming, but I want it to be more than that. I want it to change the way I organize my life and work.  I predominately PhotoShop and use Capture One for a living, as well as assist with general photographic doo-dads. But using one of these to brainstorm about future projects, and making image journals of sorts, while seeing a whole slew of digital information presented around you in space, while being able to collaborate with others seems like a dream come true.  Not to mention using it as a tether device, like a second monitor, for videography, even using the gyroscope as an input for a gymbal system sounds incredible.  Anyway, $800 sounds acceptable. My bet is that it will be cheaper. But when you think about how much smart phones cost, and how much cheaper higher end electronics are getting, and how much demand there will be, I am betting it will be like $600."

HoloLens,32c7oz,hololeo,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:33:31 2015 UTC,"I'm really interested to see how they are doing this. Considering that a mouse can usually only be connected to one computer (one USB wired; one BT pairing; one IR link?), how can they make that happen? The only way I can think of is that the HoloLens is linked to the PC like an additional monitor. So the Mars program is actually running on the PC instead of the HoloLens, and the HoloLens sends head movement and air taps to the PC. Of course MS could have created a whole new technology to send X-Y coords to the HoloLens from the PC but I think setting it up as an additional monitor makes things a lot easier on them and, in the case of the Mars demo, lets the PC do all the heavy GPU lifting."
HoloLens,32c7oz,BI_Joe,2,Mon Apr 13 21:09:37 2015 UTC,it really not hard at all. hololens can run a local network server and the mouse movements are posted to that server in realtime via sockets. its actually quite trivial
HoloLens,32cvmo,ilovegoogleglass,5,Sun Apr 12 18:55:03 2015 UTC,"I think (I hope) tabletop games will be the most prevalent, at least in the beginning. Seems like that would be the easiest/quickest type of game to experiment with and release.   Along the Minecraft (HoloBuilder) lines, I can see more games like that too. Think of something like SimCity or Cities: Skylines that let you build cities in different areas of your house/apt, connected by roads.   Games like Orbus, that we've seen short snippets of, will be big too, I think. They're a bit more complex than tabletop & minecraft type games but I think the novelty of a game character interacting with your physical environment is going to be unique enough for game developers to jump on it.  I think we'll see a couple first-person games, where you walk around your house and shoot/kill/do things, at launch but I'd bet those are a bit more complex than the previous types so it might be a while for third-party studios to get their games out."

It would be great to have it project augmented inventories or maps so that your TV can just display the game. It could also enhance in game explosions and blow holes in your living room. Scary games are going to give you ptsd   when suddenly some monster walks out of your kitchen. Scfi games can have high tech minority report type interfaces. It may be possible to make racing games finally portray real sense of speed. It could also act as an entire new controller by projecting objects to take cover behind, corners to peek around or having to put together a craft item or puzzle. And who knows what's possible when you link a kinect to it. The kinect could detect what's behind you and relay that info to your hololens for a more immersive experience.  What if it could recognize media and provide enhancements to it, like projecting a concert in your living room or if your watching jurassic park it could fill your room with tropical plants that rustle around and dinosaur pop out on cue.

HoloLens,32ce0u,Shooob,9,Sun Apr 12 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"Two things. FOV and App support.  While FOV can get better in future iterations. By the time future iterations gets here, the market will already be saturated with VR/AR devices. First to market means nothing when your device is mediocre. (Atleast 60 degrees, no screen box)  Branded Partnered Apps.  MS has to reach out and partner with other companies. For example nintendo (pokemon, slightly not possible), yugioh (konami, very possible).  Minecraft purchase was good. Imagine dueling with friends with monsters appearing. or walking with pikachi and battling. or playing age of empires on your living room. card games, board games, figure games, table games, poker.  That right there would sell itself. it should exist on launch.  Please don't rely just on developers, else you will fail. You need partners like disney, dedicate a section of the theme parks with hololen support games.  and App support on release. There should be a saturated store with sufficient amount of apps on release.  Get it in school institutions, partner with museums, stores, businesses, etc. like apple, you need to flood the market with it. Every where ppl goes, they should see hololens.  Its the only way this thing will take off. please don't pull a google glass and let this thing die."
HoloLens,32ce0u,setoman,3,Sun Apr 12 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"All excellent points. Can't agree more. If they nail the tech then the buzz from this device will be deafening, dare I say iPhone esque. It will appear on all the morning talkies. Someone should be fired if they aren't talking and working with Disney and the other major theme park companies to develop compelling content. But in the end, if the tech isn't there FOV etc. then none of that matters."
HoloLens,32ce0u,ralexand56,4,Sun Apr 12 18:38:32 2015 UTC,"Walled garden and lame store: locking all app deployment to a mediocre store killed windows rt and it could do the same for HoloLens. No standard inputs besides gaze, air gestures, and voice: the demoed interactivity of the HoloLens leaves a lot to be desired. They have the tech to make input great, but it needs to be better before a consumer release. Optics: less of a concern for me, but low resolution, low FOV, low contrast, low opacity, high latency, or any other problem with the optics could limit the uses of the HoloLens. Price, performance, power supply: as a computing device, HoloLens will be judged on the value for money it provides for processing power and battery life. How much of a premium will the display tech warrant?   I think HoloLens can overcome these hurdles, but there are certainly ways it could fail."
HoloLens,32ce0u,BI_Joe,2,Sun Apr 12 19:36:45 2015 UTC,"I'm almost sure the hololens will fail mainly for the reasons you stated. Their demo seems cool, but Microsoft is not putting near enough resources behind it to have a successful commercial release. Their interface will be clunky and error-prone, their hardware too unattractive expensive or flimsy, and the complexity of this new style of input will alienate app developers except for very niche applications."
HoloLens,32ce0u,MacBelieve,5,Mon Apr 13 15:08:06 2015 UTC,"We'll see. Despite making that list, I'm one of the most ardent supporters of HoloLens out there, so here's a rebuttal to myself:   I would be very surprised if Microsoft continues to lock deployment of UAP apps to the Store. Doing so would risk killing off far more than HoloLens and it runs counter to everything else Microsoft's been doing lately. What's the point in being able to build a binary that runs across all devices if binaries can be installed exclusively from the Store? HoloLens has been demonstrated to pair with a desktop computer and share its mouse. That opens up incredible possibilities for input, even if they don't announce anything further. The gaze, voice, and gesture input system is also well thought out for a hands-free environment and would not be very difficult to develop for since the gaze+airtap input is highly analogous to input with a mouse. Additional input devices are needed for many applications, but compared to the demonstrated capabilities of the HoloLens there is nothing technically complex about making input peripherals. If Microsoft won't make additional inputs for some dumb reason, other companies will. On optics: based on the several dozen hands-on impressions of the prototype hardware, any problems the display may have are not dealbreakers to the vast majority of people. The HoloLens display tech is so different from a conventional computing device that I think people will realize that it doesn't make sense to judge the HoloLens as a tablet or desktop. There's no shortage of developer interest in the HoloLens and the first-party app support from Microsoft is looking quite good already.   The demo is way more than cool. The technology demonstrated with HoloLens is years ahead of anything anyone else has shown publicly. If Microsoft fumbles this, well, that would be pretty sad."
HoloLens,32ce0u,BI_Joe,3,Mon Apr 13 16:41:21 2015 UTC,"I look forward to the future you see. Again, I expect microsoft to not invest enough in this. I imagine a repeat of the smartphone market: Microsoft will push products but without a cohesive vision or sufficient follow through. They will sell AR/VR headset on some corner of their website or as a peripheral device. People will migrate slowly seeing the use as more applications become apparent. As the market starts to burgeon, a company like Apple will successfully brand and market the tech to the masses. Talent and innovation will follow the money that they produce and microsoft will be out in the cold constantly trying to catch up. They won't see what they have until it's securely in the hands of its competitor.  Microsoft has a history of producing very high quality and open platforms only to dry out when the consumer base rejects it for one reason or another. I am speculating quite heavily and I hope this doesn't happen. They are one of the only major tech players that could produce a product that isn't just a new way to play farmville and get on facebook. But unfortunately, Farmville and Facebook bring the money."
HoloLens,32ce0u,MacBelieve,3,Mon Apr 13 17:20:59 2015 UTC,"""Again, I expect microsoft to not invest enough in this.""  I'm guessing you haven't been following this for very long. We already know that Microsoft has invested at least seven years of research and millions of dollars, and that was before Satya took over and changed it from just gaming to a general-purpose consumer device. Is that to say that MS is going to spend millions more on marketing? No, but there's really no reason to believe they won't, especially if they want a return on their investment, which is quite significant at this point."
HoloLens,32ce0u,setoman,2,Mon Apr 13 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"I agree on one thing and its that MS is always playing catch up. Then when they finally release something first, they don't push it enough (ala kinect).  Its saddening, its the reason we have a slightly less powerful x1. They cost themselves hundreds of millions of dollars.  Again they are very late to the party. WP = late. Surface = late. Cortana = late. Smartwate = they still don't have one. Yes MS band is awesome, but the watch should have been the focus from the start.  The MS band is the portrait of Microsoft. Always playing catchup.  Fitness bands came and are now gone. What happens? MS releases a fitness band to top them all. Amazing, yes but late.  We are now in the era of Smartwatches and Apple is knocking it out the ball park with a sluggish, slow, ugly watch. yet they have 1 mill orders in 24 hours?  Why? because they pushed it hard from every angle."
HoloLens,32ce0u,BI_Joe,3,Mon Apr 13 20:10:22 2015 UTC,"Yes MS band is awesome, but the watch should have been the focus from the start.   Why? Band does pretty much everything the Apple Watch does except for Apple Pay and scribble texting, and if Microsoft were to introduce an Apple Pay imitator they could do it with Band. Microsoft could have pushed Band harder, but changing its form to a smart watch would accomplish little. They are not Apple and should not try to be Apple.   Apple is knocking it out the ball park with a sluggish, slow, ugly watch. yet they have 1 mill orders in 24 hours?   That says a lot more about the Apple brand than it does about the sensibility of making a ""sluggish, slow, ugly watch."" There are first generation boxed iPhones selling on eBay today for thousands of dollars. The Watch is the first new Apple product in years and the first to be developed without Jobs. The pre-order numbers are fantastic, but the watch has yet to really prove itself as a device that people will happily wear all the time. It could be a huge success, but it could just as easily backfire horribly and damage Apple's brand as a fashionable and luxurious tech item. In any case, Microsoft's mobile strategy is very different from Apple's and that's a good thing for both companies and for consumers."

So, instead, i'll offer this:  They have said they'll be including non-Windows Apps in the store.  And, they've never delivered WinRT apps outside the store before (other than enterprise/dev-test).  So, instead, I think it's easily more reasonable to say this:   1.I would be very surprised if Microsoft enables deployment of UAP apps outside the Store.   vs.   1.I would be very surprised if Microsoft continues to lock deployment of UAP apps to the Store.   because that would be the change as opposed to the status quo.  They haven't made any indication otherwise, so why would you be ""very surprised"" if they don't totally change?  I think it's more logical to say ""ill be surprised if they do change""."
HoloLens,32ce0u,BI_Joe,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:34:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I expect the status quo to change.  This is one of the top suggestions on the Windows User Voice site at the moment. The closest thing to an official response I've seen has been this exchange on the Windows blog: imgur | Windows blog (see comments)  I expect the status quo to change for many reasons. Too many to list here, but the most important is that Microsoft's current policy on deploying modern apps is just not very good. They really need developers to adopt UAP and the best way to do that is to make it the API of choice for all Windows development, not just store apps.  Forcing all UAP apps to be distributed through the store is terrible for getting developers to adopt UAP. Academics will be reluctant to use it because academic code is almost always distributed with an ""as-is"" license (or something even more guilt-absolving like Matt Might's CRAPL) and Store certification is a hassle they don't need. Open-source projects won't use it because maintaining community projects is hard enough without needing to designate a maintainer of the Microsoft account and worrying about licensing restrictions and other terms of the store (the only open-source store app I'm aware of is Firefox). Students who complete a CS 101 project and want to send it to friends and family would be out of luck unless they deploy it to the store and clutter up the market even more (I'm pretty sure this happens a lot, since students typically get free developer access). Hackathon projects and other bits of experimental tinkering are better done with Win32 because they can be easily shared at the end of a weekend, again without worrying about store certification. On the other end of the spectrum, large companies are going to be reluctant to cut Microsoft in on their sales. Microsoft's app store is also not all that well optimized for app discovery or sales and companies that have invested in their own distribution systems have no reason to port all their code to the new API just to benefit Microsoft.  I could go on, but contrast all this to what happens if Microsoft allows UAP apps to be distributed outside the store. The store doesn't die. If anything, it gets better than it currently is because Microsoft can be more selective with screening and more developers will self-screen apps that aren't intended for wide distribution. The store would retain its benefit of being the simplest way to manage app sales and distribution across all devices, but consumers and developers would both have more choices. UAP would become the obvious API to target for all Windows developers instead of Win32 and once that occurs getting developers to list their UAP apps on the store (alongside their existing distribution channels for desktop) is a no-brainer.  Steam didn't obtain its near-monopoly on PC gaming by preventing all PC games from being distributed on other platforms. There are Steam-exclusive games as there will be Store-exclusive apps, but the service is popular because it's convenient. I only started using Steam when I had so many (DRM-free) games from Humble Bundles that they needed a service to track. Once Windows users start truly adopting UAP apps we'll see a similar consumer desire for apps to be listed in the store, but that can't happen while Universal Apps are seen as Windows Store Apps."

It doesn't necessarily have to be a single killer app, but maybe a pipeline of content, like you see on the IOS products.  As techies we want to think it's in the numbers....the specs.    The truth is that it will be in delivering what Space Invaders was to arcades, VisiCalc was to Apple II, and what Facebook(et al) was for mobile.  So what would destroy the device?   1) No direction or 2) Micromanagement of content  No Direction -- I think Microsoft botched the Kinect launch, because they never really delivered a killer app for it.    There was no Mario or Sonic type franchise that defined the device, mostly just Wii-ish like games.    It's possible that there just wasn't a killer app, but I don't get the sense that they put enough effort to deliver one.   (fwiw....I think the voice control on the new Xbox's Kinect is a true killer app).   What it comes down to is that they need to set some paths to show that this is a product that can redefine gaming/business/lives.    Micromanagement -- My understanding is that, at the launch of the original IPhone, Apple debated whether to open the app store wide, or keep it internal.    Simply put.....there is no way Apple would be pushing a 1 trillion dollar cap had they gone the other way.     The HoloLens needs a free, open door, wild west style marketplace.

The WHO publishes charts of child growth standards which show various percentiles of head sizes for children up to the age of 5 years old. You can learn about adult head size distributions in this paper (pdf).  Bottom line is that if the HoloLens works on adult women in the bottom percentile of head sizes (which it should because 1 in 100 women is still a lot of people), then it should be useable by 50% of 5 year old girls and 50% of 3.5 year old boys. It's probably not recommended for children that young, or even 7 year olds, but it should work for most 7 year olds and teens shouldn't have any issues."

Deep talk of the development API's are critical for this conference, but to keep the consumer interest in this going we need some more amazing demos of what's to come. The Surface 3 or Surface 4 Pro to be the handout.  If the Surface 3, there has to be an additional giveaway or store credit to cover the traditional ~$1000 or more in hardware that's given away. Windows 10 will be the primary focus of BUILD for its discussions and keynotes.  HoloLens will the 'cool' topic but keynote and discussions will treat it as a secondary focus. Windows 10 for IoT will be announced with a preview SDK and images for Raspberry Pi 2 will be released with this.   Hope   I'd much prefer to have HoloLens the giveaway, but I doubt that its going to happen.  Still holding some hope for it.

A Bluetooth keyboard would be more convenient in cases where you don't need the other computer.  I'd like to see an input device that provides haptic feedback, improves tracking of input, and replaces the air tap with a more comfortable physical button press. The Vive controllers are a good example, though I'd like to see the need for base stations eliminated. A flat controller that just had a few buttons and a rumble function would also probably provide more accurate tracking even without any additional sensors: simply having a solid object of known size would reduce uncertainty considerably and give an unambiguous position and orientation for virtual tools. A smartphone could probably do the job, but a cheap remote control-like device would also work.  One of the bigger questions around this is how will Microsoft standardize inputs? You'll probably be able to use any input imaginable with the right drivers and software, but what input devices will developers be able to expect? Ideally all apps should work with the limited inputs shown already, but that's a bit like saying that Surface apps should work without a keyboard, mouse, or stylus."

I don't really care that the image quality on this isn't HoloLens quality (and even HoloLens might not look very good when you film through the lenses), this is still pretty cool. It's interesting to me that the butterfly wings give a definite impression of blackness even though the black is transparent. It's a bit of a cheat since the high contrast with white wings won't always be available when you want to draw black, but it was effective here nonetheless.  If nothing else, this would be a good prototyping platform prior to the HoloLens release. Anything that can be made to work with the Moverio will doubtless look much better on the HoloLens.  Edit: to be clear, I do think the Moverio does kind of suck for AR and would be very disappointed if HoloLens was similar, but I don't think that's the point here."

Despite what someone else said these stereoscopic images are holographic - even with the limited FOV that cuts off the images when you move around it. Your mind is fooled into believing these objects exist in your space and you want to reach out and grab them  The glasses lack a depth sensor so AR outside of tracking on a marker is limited. But software is improving and i havent fully explored everything the SDKs offer.  The metaglasses by Meta are essentially Moverio lens with 3D cam on top. That is the next step up for my exploration but I will hold off on that until we see if Hololens will be available to developers for ordering in a few weeks.  As for the butterfly, black on Moverio is supposed to be transparent. But because the projector is LCD there is no such thing as 'no light' so you get the dark rectangle frame. Hololens is rumored to have laser projection so that should not be an issue."

In the photo renders there's two light-guides, there's the conventional lenses and directly behind of that, there's the second light guide (grating) that you can faintly see from the side.  http://compass.surface.com/assets/2c/60/2c606567-19b6-485b-a86d-96d2c1b5fd7e.mp4?n=b_hero_06_animation_16s_9-MPEG-4.mp4  Relevant patents from Nokia Corp:  https://www.google.com/patents/US20130088780?dq  https://www.google.com/patents/US20100079865?dq"
HoloLens,320iev,Shooob,2,Thu Apr 9 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"Good eye! At first I passed it off as glare from the lights, but you're right, there appears to be another lens/prism/grating there. MS did say (from some of the articles) that they are using a grating where the light bounces around, that might be it.  When you say ""unbelievable viewing distances"" what do you mean? Can you give me an example or idea?"
HoloLens,320iev,ralexand56,3,Thu Apr 9 18:00:45 2015 UTC,"For example if you were at your desk and you're using Autocad alongside Hololens to view your model beside your monitor, it would use the close EPE and light angularity to provide a similar viewing distance to your monitor. Exactly like the Autocad motorcycle concept they showed. If you wanted see a life sized version of your model it would use the middle EPE.   For virtual environments it would use the infinity EPE alongside the middle and close EPEs to produce something like this.  If it uses this kind of technology it's pretty much ahead of every HMD publicly existing."
HoloLens,320iev,BI_Joe,2,Thu Apr 9 18:44:18 2015 UTC,Technically it could give the affect of a finite landscape with different optical focuses (depth perception). Which they can selectively position a scene to different viewing distances. If this is correct the other grating could provide a semi peripheral vision but not totally 180 degrees... The beam splitter could enable pseudo VR experiences or as Microsoft calls it Mixed reality virtual environments. The units that the press tried out didn't have the fancy visor or optics IIRC.

I don't know about the profit model for the warehouse owner, but I could just see this happening.    A new genre of stories could be told.  Instead of just audio books, and movies, a kind of interactive blend of that could go on with fiction/non-fiction.  Really, I have nothing in mind...I just see someone putting something together creatively like that though even if it was something as simple as each ""page"" you turn, there is an accompanying environment that you're in...if you've ever read The Road by Cormac McCarthy, then that would be damned near scary, and certainly eerie and ominous.

Another gimmicky idea (that I still kind of want): a ""5 km monitor"". The HoloLens would create the illusion of a hole in your wall looking out at a mountain far in the distance with a virtual monitor sitting on top of it. The monitor would be rendered to have a perceived diagonal measurement of 5 kilometers (its angular measurement would still obviously have to be whatever size fits comfortably within the HoloLens FOV). I picture this being sold as a free/demo app with the paid version unlocking even ""bigger"" modes. Aside from being a goofy gimmick (which it is) the reason I want this to exist is that it could be useful as eye relief to be able to focus that far away while you work.  An optometry app to figure out your prescription for corrective lenses would also be cool, though I'm not sure how technologically feasible that is.  Like arvr, I'm also holding on to some ideas that I want to make myself (actually I want to make that giant monitor myself if no one else does, but I won't be too upset if I'm scooped on that)."

HoloLens,31u0kl,Shooob,2,Wed Apr 8 03:35:54 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with this report, except for a couple of things. I think the AR Games slice will be much larger, especially after the release of the HoloLens and the other competing AR glasses that follow. I also think that the AR Theme Park is going to be much larger. However, I don't think AR Film/TV is going to be larger than AR Games, at least not in the next 5 years, and certainly not as large as AR Enterprise. There are filmmakers experimenting with VR and I've seen some niche AR advertisements for a couple of movies but I think we're still years away from a full AR movie or TV experience (with the exception of watching Netflix on a hologram on a wall, which I would classify as more of AR Consumer and not really an AR Film).  What are your thoughts?"
HoloLens,31u0kl,Tojuro,3,Wed Apr 8 04:03:19 2015 UTC,"I'm on the same page as you.  I'd go so far as to say that I think AR will be on par with VR for its share of the gaming market.     The problem is that VR just won't work for every type of game right now.    Fast moving games - most modern (COD/Halo like) games just won't work like people want them to in VR.    In the end, VR will work great for certain types of games, and AR will work better for others.   And, I really think AR has more potential for revolutionary new patterns in gaming, while VR will just fill up the other three walls for modern games.  Beyond gaming -- AR will absolutely dominate.    In business, education and for personal use.....AR has a multitude of killer apps.    There is no competition here.    These are markets where the margins are higher and it will change the way we live and think.    This is why AR will be the bigger force in dollars and in changing our lives.   One area that VR may well do better is porn.    Honestly, this could be the true killer app for VR, because (again, based on my experience with Oculus) it just doesn't work that well for most modern, relatively fast moving, games."
HoloLens,31u0kl,NotDaPunk,2,Wed Apr 8 04:37:18 2015 UTC,"Depending on how easy MS makes cross-hardware development on Win10, you might imagine taking anything developed with 3D objects on a screen (just about all games today) and easily porting that over into 3D objects in space in front of the AR user. Actually doing that would be a different story though - as with a lot of products, I'd imagine the first few iterations to make dramatic progress, while later iterations just become incremental polish."

While the formulas and calculations and theory are waaay over my head, they also mentioned some object-oriented principles that they're using (at least at the time of this paper, which I'm guessing was either this year or last year), which I can relate to and start thinking about. Nothing too surprising on the Object3d side, except maybe Type which determines what type of surface it should attach to in the room, if at all. And the way they define the Environment properties - Camera, Ceiling and Floor - is good to know.  I also noticed a comment at the end:  ""We used planar features for our examples as they are common in indoor scenes and were sufficient to  generate all the examples in the paper. Other environments, such as natural scenes, may require other features.""  I hope they work out how to handle natural scenes as I'd like to explore some outdoor options."

So I'll just assume it is. According to this parts diagram (not confirmed) there's a actually a projector (most likely a LCoS) that projects onto a prism to create images. But it's interesting that you can't see the prism in the lenses (the lenses are crystal clear!). But why is it projecting it in front of the lenses? The thickness of the lenses are a lot smaller than 8mm and 10mm which makes me think this isn't the technology Hololens is using. Plus in the document it says the FOV of 40x23 is by far the minimum, they say with different embodiments they can get close to 60° or even greater. We do know that the lenses have layers of blue, red, and green, so it doesn't really make sense to have the layers of colors when your basically reflective the image onto the retina but I'm no expert or an amateur for that matter. Seems like they're creating wavelengths at different angles by a laser and a special grating which goes back to the idea of them using a Holographic waveguide. But have you see the thickness of the lenses it's borderline small. The only way I see them having extremely large FOVs is by using a similar lens technique like Oculus by exaggerating the light, but it's not practical for AR hmds. Plus it would be a little disorienting. (BS: maybe the lenses are switchable between large and normal FOV use cases, the parts diagram talks about switchable lenses). Highly unlikely, but it's thought.   Hololens rotation gif Side profile of Hololens  If I were to guess I think Hololens' is using a Holographic waveguide approach through a laser. Plus Microsoft has been showing the bleeding/rainbow affect (caused by Holographic waveguides) in some their promo media. Not really evidence but a nod to holography. :)"

I say this because you can see that when she moves her head the interface is still relative where it was displayed before. Before the UI popped up, they showed Terry Myerson's hologram at the bottom right corner of the FOV, when the UI showed up you can see that the interface didn't appear where the Terry Myerson hologram was at. It appeared in the middle of her starting FOV of the wall and stayed relative there. What this ultimately means that a lot more stuff can be displayed at once (greater FOV). Some more evidence is that the UI doesn't clip when she makes settle head movements. It looks like the Terry Myerson hologram depth is closer than the depth of what the UI is at. Which goes back to Hololens ability to bend light to make things look closer or farther than what they appear. It remembers that the Hologram was mapped to that podium thing and keeps it relative to there, and then the UI maps itself to the depth of the wall. Makes me wonder if the UI always finds something farther way to paste itself on.  https://i.imgur.com/zEY3KDX.gif  Edit: It will always find something farther away to paste itself on, we wouldn't be able to focus on the UI if it didn't."

HoloLens,31dw0b,Shooob,1 point,Sat Apr 4 06:17:43 2015 UTC,"Probably getting too carried away at this   Ha ha, welcome to my world. Keep dissecting though, because this is awesome! It's really cool seeing all this stuff I missed in the video despite watching it obsessively.  If ""Fragment"" is the VFS game, it's a really unusual choice for the concept video. It does make some sense: that in-game hand motion would translate well to a gesture, and acquiring a project from a small group of students with a proof-of-concept that got picked up by the gaming media is a proven way to get a good new IP (see Narbacular Drop).  Edit: That's a remarkably clean screenshot of the UI. You can also discern HoloGallery (red icon) and Photo Gallery (bottom middle). HoloGallery would be cool to see. Maybe it's the real name of HoloShelf."
HoloLens,31dw0b,arvr,1 point,Sat Apr 4 06:30:51 2015 UTC,it seems to be a game that you walk around in your home opening and closing doors and seeing enemies around corners etc
HoloLens,31dw0b,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:51:41 2015 UTC,I wonder how this would play gameplay wise in your home? lol
HoloLens,31dw0b,ilovegoogleglass,2,Sun Apr 5 19:19:09 2015 UTC,"It would definitely need to be heavily adapted, but it has a lot of elements that would work well with HoloLens.  You create remote-controlled clones of yourself in the game that pop up a window showing their perspective. In the current game, that window is shown in the top-left of the screen. In the HoloLens version, your remote control clone could be controlled from a floating holographic viewport. Tying movement to these clones means that you could get around space constraints while avoiding motion sickness. Players can then jump into a clone's perspective to walk around from a first-person view (that's also part of the existing game).  I imagine this game would lean towards the VR side of the AR/VR spectrum with relatively complete replacement of the real world. There are still a bunch of tricky design issues (like what do you do when players walk off virtual ledges or through virtual walls?) but the base game is well suited for adaptation.  If this does turn out to be a real HoloLens game, it is crazy that Shooob was able to find it from that icon. Fragment, Orbus, virtual pet dog, 2 versions of Minecraft, whatever HoloVillage is: for having made a single public appearance, it's a good start for gaming on the device. We're still only scratching the surface of what it could do, but if Fragment gets confirmed that would be huge."

I think all the CG concepts in the video are all actual experiences being worked on. You can see more screens of Orbus throughout the video.

You have some really nice finds in your Orbus album. I saw those things in the video but didn't make the connection. I wish the text on the whiteboard was legible; it clearly says something about NASA which is more relevant to OnSight. I also just realized that the whiteboard has the Orbus logo pinned to it."

Escher Canon? The ""Experiences"" one is ""Experiences Sizzle"" which must be referring to a sizzle reel (quite possibly the ""possibilities"" trailer this is from). The NASA one is ""NASA announce"" and the one after that is ""Neil [Veil?] Instructions"". Project H is anyone's guess, though if it's Project B that would be Baraboo / HoloLens."

HoloLens,31dw0b,Shooob,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:46:37 2015 UTC,we need your patent analysis for the posts ilovegoogleglasses just posted   https://www.google.com/patents/US20140240843 https://www.google.com/patents/US20120326948?dq
HoloLens,31dw0b,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:53:45 2015 UTC,"I was looking at that. I don't have much to add to what I've already said about opacity (this seems consistent with it all).  This does imply a more passive filter than the per-pixel opacity grid we've discussed on occasion. Either method could work by itself, or they may be using a combination of both a global filter and local darkening.  Key points from this patent:   ""The light transmissivity of the filter may be about 70% light transmissive to substantially or completely opaque."" In all claims, the filter is removable from the HMD frame. Claim 17 and its sub-claims are for a VR device. Note: ""filtering of the environmental light by the filter lens causes the augmented-reality image to be a primary image seen by a user"" and ""filter lens has a light transmissivity between 0 and 10%.""   If I were to speculate recklessly about what this could mean, I'd say that the front filter of the HoloLens could be swappable between a 0% to 70% 30% to ""substantially"" opaque AR mode and a 90% to 100% opaque VR mode.  Edit: I confused transmissivity with opaqueness with regards to the ""AR mode""."
HoloLens,31djpl,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:23:42 2015 UTC,ok can we put to bed that Hololens has an optical system exactly like Moverio? two screens in front of the eye with lens to make them appear in front of you?  EDIT: ilovegoggleglass made an amazing find of prism system patent to extend the FOV based on eye gaze https://www.google.com/patents/US20140240843
HoloLens,31djpl,arvr,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:46:32 2015 UTC,"What is the chance that you could turn up the filter to 100%, ignore reality, and make it a full VR device?   I feel like the device we've seen people wearing makes more sense to me with this patent and the 'near eye display' one.   The sun-glass like tinting on the glasses being the light filter, and the rounded bottom to direct the image that's projected from the top.      I'm fascinated to know how closely it follows the eyes, both in how it helps make the system function and as a data input from an (app) developers perspective.   Imagine if the eye tracking can be used like a mouse-over event is on screen-based apps.......lots of amazing possibilities there."
HoloLens,31djpl,Tojuro,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:38:42 2015 UTC,"That's a quite interesting remark. I think there's a high chance, this makes the most sense. Block out all real world light, map the room, and light the virtual scene with artificial light. The FOV could increase quite substantially if the filter is reflective in the inside. Or they can block out and occlude your periphery and only display your focus vision. Oh god if Microsoft does this!? Exciting times ahead!   https://i.imgur.com/wOn30Rr.jpg"
HoloLens,31d8u0,ilovegoogleglass,2,Fri Apr 3 23:41:59 2015 UTC,nice find  very similar experience to Moverio which has 23. The problem is your head is the camera so you have to move it all around to see any action beyond that frame. These hololens videos with mincraft sprawling all over the place would only work that way if someone was standing far behind them.  and the opposite is true. the more you close in on that drone map the smaller that rectangle viewport gets relative to the map.  I remember someone saying that the hololens view was like having a laptop screen floating in front of you. so from that report im betting hololens v1 is just 2 projected screens like ODG and moverio.
HoloLens,31d8u0,arvr,4,Sat Apr 4 00:08:41 2015 UTC,I think the display tech in the production model can bend light at different angles to increase the FOV. In the Wired piece Alex Kipman talks about the ability for Hololens to modify the angle of how light is displayed.
HoloLens,31d8u0,arvr,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:07:40 2015 UTC,you are die hard believer! ;)  could be. if they are sending light through mirrors they could strike it at different angles to increase the area of projection. since they have gaze detection they could track the eye as it moves off center and shine light in that area.    another promising feature is if they using laser projection then you wont get there wouldnt be 'black' projection. thats what causes the frame. it would just be a picture of the mountain. THAT would be more compelling especially if they can get it nice and bright.
HoloLens,31d8u0,arvr,3,Sat Apr 4 03:13:43 2015 UTC,There's also this patent that was filed recently on using a prsim to expand the FOV... https://www.google.com/patents/US20140240843
HoloLens,31d8u0,Shooob,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:38:11 2015 UTC,dude. you are crazy good at finding stuff!  so YES it appears they use mirrors to expand the FOV based on where the gaze is at. they have some kind of silver screen that covers the inside of the goggles and the mirrors shine into that area.   that would mean the image would be brightest at the center and be more transparent and 'ghostly' all around.   or maybe not. i guess they can control the brightness on the center screen and increase the mirrored image brightness  either way this sounds very promising
HoloLens,31d8u0,arvr,3,Sat Apr 4 03:58:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's very interesting because I found this image showing a similar set up in the patent. Exciting times. http://i.gyazo.com/82b8b759c5d9411a2630a8edf93a7259.png"

I often require nearly a dozen different documents open at one time while working, and I hate all of the tabbing I have to do to switch between these. Even with my over-sized double monitors, I would love to have more work-space and privacy.   I'm hoping the HoloLens will allow for a spherical working space that allows me to  have as many instances of documents open as I want and set them anywhere in 3d space around me. I would be able to simply move my head slightly to reference another document when needed. I don't need any gestures, just hook this thing up to a standard mouse and keyboard and give me a desktop that is everywhere.  .  Second, to use for home entertainment. I really hate having TVs and monitors in my house. Between the wires and the remotes, it's all just clutter. Want to watch Netflix? Just pin a Netflix window onto the wall across from me while I pin an instance of Chrome below it for browsing. HoloLens should replace every screen in my house. If I wanted to feel like I was at the movies, just have the Netflix window take up the full viewing area."

Even outside of that, I was thinking that it would be interesting & fun to build a large HoloBuilder (Minecraft) area at a gaming convention, like PAX or something. Others could bring their HoloLenses and join in (if the HoloLens version of Minecraft supports multiplayer).  I think other HL owners would love joining in to build a world at the convention."

HoloLens,3173o8,GrzegorzWidla,0,Thu Apr 2 21:17:40 2015 UTC,"I think the app that will most likely get the HoloLens in the hands of the average Joe is going to have something to do with sports. Perhaps a holographic display of the sports players/athletes playing the game on your coffee or dining room table. Imagine what it would be like to watch your favorite basketball, football, rugby, tennis or whatever player or team live on your table in front of you. You'd be able to watch the game from any angle, maybe be able to pause and replay like a DVR? This type of interface/interaction would also be huge for the coaches and players themselves.

HoloLens,3173o8,GrzegorzWidla,2,Thu Apr 2 18:47:10 2015 UTC,"Indeed, they would have to reconstruct their whole camera setups to be 3D and have a camera pointed in all directions (which will cost millions) and have motion trackers on all athletes for this all to work.   I think having a 70 inch holographic 3d TV with interactive experiences flooding your living room will be much more impressive and viable. Like mini games during breaks, 3D reconstruction of the court with markers to show you what's going on, 3D sound, and holographic scoreboards.

NextVR already has these cameras. They use them for all of their events. It doesn't cost millions. Regardless, what I'm talking about doesn't require 360 degree 3D cameras as I'm not talking about the entire 360 degree view. I'm thinking it would just be the court/field and the players. Motion trackers are not needed as depth sensors work just fine. These are proven techniques and the hardware already exists.  I think your second part would be cool as well but I think that what will take the HoloLens further will be to use the whole environment (Living/Family Room, for example) instead of just a 3D TV experience."

With NextVR you basically get a 3D 360 view wherever the camera man is at at a given time. With what you're describing seems to be a 3D diorama sized model of a feed that can be view from any angle. You must understand that you'll need a pretty decent camera rig to map the whole stadium for everything to be optimal. 3D positional sound for the angles and a tracking system for movement."

It's safe to assume that Microsoft has their on proprietary Display technology IP under wraps to mislead competitors. Microsoft claims to basically shine light into the users eye instead of conventionally in front of you/eye. There's few near eye displays that share this technique. We just don't know. A lot of their promo shots kinda hint at the FOV but they're kinda misleading because some show a big, small or a medium FOV.

I think the BUILD attendees will get the kit for free (which is probably what most attendees are hoping since it sold out within 45 minutes). I'm hoping they'll make it available to order for those of us that couldn't get a ticket. I bet that it'll be close to $1000 though. And yes, as a developer I would pay that much.  Keep in mind, a dev kit (if offered) is directed specifically for developers, preferably for developers who work for a company that can afford one, or many, as part of their R&D budget. A dev kit isn't really marketed, or priced, for individuals. I'll be very surprised if it is $500 - $700."

And, why should they?  If they're as far ahead as everyone says, why shouldn't they?  This from Harvard Business Review has been very insightful in my mind since the HoloLens reveal;   because in Forrester’s Technographics survey data, there are 7.2 million adults in the US that have the ideal combination of attributes that makes them early candidates for HoloLens. They like technology, they have an Xbox, they have children, and they have an annual household income of more than $100,000. If Microsoft can persuade even half of them to jump in, that’s 3.6 million consumers, or 45% of the people who bought a Kinect at launch who will try a HoloLens by 2016. And going into 2017, just two years from now, the momentum they will have generated will force executives at your company to sidestep drones, self-driving cars, and robots to focus on this technology. They’ll see by then how it changes the way your customers interact with the products, services, and information that you provide them.   The point: The market is ready for a new segment.  MSFT has the pieces that Facebook/Occulus do not -- reach, ecosystem, hardware, retail, devStack, mindshare.  HoloLens could create the market - a market that rivals ""game console"" or ""tablet"" in scale."
HoloLens,313dzl,abs159,2,Fri Apr 17 00:17:54 2015 UTC,"I might be convinced to drop $1000 on a unit.  If I get a sense this is a really short dev cycle to production I'd probably be reluctant to drop more then $1000.    If the dev kits are identical to the production units, I'd definitely buy one.  I don't want to cough up $1000 or more and find 6-12 months latter its utterly obsolete.  This is all speculation of course.  We are getting closer to BUILD and there still is no good solid information on the dev units.  I suspect its going to be months before they are available."

HoloLens,313dzl,GrzegorzWidla,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:25:24 2015 UTC,I'm quite sure HoloLens will be handed free at Build. When released it'll also be somewhere around $499 and not $2k.
HoloLens,313dzl,ilovegoogleglass,2,Wed Apr 1 21:34:39 2015 UTC,"Indeed, Hololens will be marketed as the ""Tablet killer"" and at $500 they can truly succeed at that. I'm positive as well that they'll announce pricing and a release date of fall 2015 at Build. Build 2015 and E3 should be interesting."
HoloLens,313dzl,Shooob,4,Wed Apr 1 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"If MS is smart, they won't market it as a ""tablet killer"", because it's not. Tablet owners have no problem with using their tablet in public spaces. We haven't gotten to that point with AR/VR glasses yet. ""Glassholes"" really hurt us on that. I hope we'll get there, and maybe the HoloLens is the product to do it, but it's just not socially acceptable yet. In the meantime, everyone will just pull out their tablet."

HoloLens,30v4ve,arvr,2,Mon Mar 30 23:50:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks, arvr.  I've been meaning to ask you: what does your Moverio display look like when you use it near a wall or with your hand in front of it? I think it would suffer from the focus problems described in the first patent I linked, but it would be interesting to know if you notice that. It's possible that this is linked to the headaches you mentioned when you first started using the headset. If that's the case, the effect may disappear or lessen if you use the Moverio while looking at a distant skyline."
HoloLens,30v4ve,arvr,2,Tue Mar 31 00:15:24 2015 UTC,the closer you get to an object the smaller the screen appears to get. it doesnt actually change but it seems that way because if i look at the wall i see a larger screen than if i put my hand in front. then the rectangle appears within the palm of my hand. in that sense i think my eyes are chaning focus because of the mix of the hand and image vs distant wall an image. it may be cause of headache. also sometimes you just want the display out of the way and that causes anxiety   also .. guess what ... optical see through AR is a GO with hololens. :)  look at this leaked LIVE POV footage i found on twitter! (feel free to post this cause i cant post the link - reddit complaining)   https://twitter.com/greg_carpentier/status/580503610456428546/photo/1
HoloLens,30v4ve,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Tue Mar 31 00:21:37 2015 UTC,"if i look at the wall i see a larger screen than if i put my hand in front.   That's really peculiar. I'm not sure how your hand and the display can be in focus at the same time, even if the apparent distance of the display is changing. Maybe when the screen is in your palm you can look directly at it without focusing your hand.   https://twitter.com/greg_carpentier/status/580503610456428546/photo/1   Unfortunately, that's a fake. It's clearly not shot through the lenses of the device since it doesn't make sense to see the nose gap in that position without seeing parts of the near-eye screens and the optics are way too perfect for this to be recorded on a camera (bear in mind that the HoloLens is designed to work with eyes, not camera lenses).

HoloLens,30v4ve,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:16:41 2015 UTC,"Well that's not what I expected. Goes to show I can't trust my intuitions about optics where waveguides are involved. The effect of always having an image in focus but scaled according to the focal distance of the eye is also what you get with a single pinlight (I'm not suggesting their underlying technology is the same, just that the end result is similar). The trade-off seems to be that you can keep an image in focus if its size scales with the eye's focal distance and there also seem to be FOV limitations associated with doing this. Some of this optical trickery is way beyond my understanding."

I tend to agree. I think AR will likely be adopted much more easily and quicker than VR in pretty much every field, with the exception of some areas of gaming and entertainment.   Keep in mind I'm speaking in terms of AR glasses versus VR HMDs. We already have AR on the smartphone (and have for quite a while now) but the adoption rate has been very slow, and I would bet most people don't know about it. If the HoloLens can live up to the hype I think we'll see an explosion of AR growth."

Do we know for sure that MS bought the patents or if they're just paying ODG for a license to use the patent? It seems like ODG is still planning to produce and sell their AR glasses, so there must be some deal that MS made with them to prevent their competition.  I also noticed he mentioned that their glasses will be ""sub-$1000"" but definitely not as low as the $300-500 range.

HoloLens,30mbz8,BI_Joe,1 point,Sat Mar 28 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"illusion of depth can be done with monocular. ask leonardo da vinci :)   You're right, of course. That was a poor choice of words on my part.  What I meant to say is that when you're looking through two lenses close to your eyes, you need stereoscopic 3D to provide an appropriate image to each eye. But that's getting rather pedantic, again you're right about the larger point.   having played with both pass through is way more comfortable   It's way more comfortable on the Moverio, but stable tracking would provide a very different experience. After obtaining that, handling focus properly is the other big requirement for optical see-through AR to be useable. If the most comfortable way to use an HMD is to project a monocular screen, I would much rather use an AR tablet."

Maybe, maybe not.   In one embodiment, an optical see-through head-mounted display (HMD) device includes a see-through lens extending between a user's eye and a real-world scene when the display device is worn by the user.  The see-through lens has an opacity filter with a grid of pixels which can be controlled to adjust their opacity, from a minimum opacity level which allows a substantial amount of light to pass, to a maximum opacity level which allows little or no light to pass.  The see-through lens also has a display component.  The device further includes at least one augmented reality emitter, such as a micro-display, which emits light to the user's eye using the display component, where the light represents an augmented reality image having a shape.  The device further includes at least one control which controls the opacity filter to provide an increased opacity for pixels which are behind the augmented reality image, from a perspective of the user's eye.  The increased-opacity pixels are provided according to the shape of the augmented reality image. An eye tracking component can be provided to track a location of the user's eye relative to a frame, so that the position of the increased-opacity pixels and/or the augmented reality image can be adjusted when there is movement of a frame on which the HMD device is carried.  In this way, the identified pixels and the augmented reality image can be shifted based on movement of the frame, while their registration to one another is maintained.   https://www.google.com/patents/US20120068913  Opacity filter for see-through head mounted display US 20120068913 A1  http://vrwiki.wikispaces.com/Microsoft+HoloLens"
HoloLens,30koy9,newfor2015,2,Sat Mar 28 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"That patent is interesting because it's exactly what Abrash is talking about when he mentions problems with light-blocking methods being out of focus. The patent itself comments on that by saying:   An opacity filter such as an LCD has generally not been used in a see-through lens as described herein because at this near distance to the eye, it is almost completely out of focus. However, this result is actually desirable for our purposes. A user sees the augmented reality image with crisp color graphics via the normal HMD display using additive color, which is designed to be in focus. The LCD panel is placed “behind” this display such that a fuzzy black border surrounds any virtual content, making it as opaque as desired. We convert the flaw of natural blurring to expediently obtain the feature of anti-aliasing and bandwidth reduction.   It's not a bug, it's a feature? I'm not sure how much I buy that, but maybe it's true and this is a valid approach. It's entirely possible that Abrash was specifically referring to this patent in his blog post, given the publication dates of the patent and the post.  An active light filtration system with eye tracking still doesn't seem to fit what little has been said about how the HoloLens works. If this is how it works, it would be misleading to say that it can't remove photons from hitting the eye. Then again, even a passive screen could be said to be removing photons."

HoloLens,30cg68,abs159,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:53:45 2015 UTC,"I believe that the Microsoft Kinect is more advanced.  The advantage of Intel RealSense and Project Tango is that their depth sensor can be integrated into tablets and laptops.  But the people Hololens said that it won't require any external cameras.  If it did however want an additional, external sensor, it would probably use a Kinect.  Edit: I take that back.  Being small enough tl integrate into a tablet means that it's working towards being small enough to integrate into a head-mounted display.  Hololens will still use their own sensor though."

HoloLens,30axyx,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:10:17 2015 UTC,"This is really neat tech, but it's not what the HoloLens is using.  They need both a ""pinlight"" plane with a light source beside it and a modulation plane in front of that. The two planes need to be separated as the size of the image projected by one pinlight is related to the separation between the planes (though many pinlights are used to increase this image/FOV size). The HoloLens design doesn't show this structure at all. It's also pretty recent work and they outline a bunch of problems with their optics, so Microsoft would have to be well ahead of the state of the art in research for them to be using this in HoloLens. Future generations, perhaps.  Their comment on focus is also interesting:   In a tiled pinlight projector display, changes from the expected eye focus do not cause the image to become appreciably “blurred”, but rather change the scaling of the tiled sub-images among the various projectors so that they expand or contract, causing tile gaps or overlaps to occur in some cases. This is expected to appear less natural to the user than normal focal blur. However, the change in scaling is small unless the viewer is focused at very close range; e.g. the change in scaling from a distance of 1 m to infinity is < 3% in a typical display (see Equation 6). Gaps caused by nearer than expected focus can be avoided by configuring the pinlight projectors so that they slightly overlap."

Yeah, I was thinking this post might be helpful because people often ask how they can prepare for HoloLens development and an understanding of this framework plus Unity/UE4 will probably get you 90% of the way there.

If anybody has any questions about Windows 10 from developer stand point (Xbox, desktops, laptops, tablets and phones were covered), just go ahead.   Since you're asking... do you know if all the new ""universal"" desktop apps need to be distributed through the Windows Store? Presumably if you have the binary you can still directly distribute it, but I wonder if that will require users to fiddle with security settings like you need to do to sideload Android apps. All I've heard on this was a response in the Windows blog comments saying ""That’s part of a much larger story to be told at Build. :)"" ...Build is going to have a lot of expectations to live up to at this rate."

Thanks for posting!  I thought it was neat that the UI casts a shadow on the virtual planet. The UI itself is pretty interesting in its own right. Seeing someone quickly navigate through those menus really drives home the value of gaze as a cursor. I used to think of it sort of as a compromise solution due to the lack of perfect hand tracking, but after watching this, I think the gaze cursor will still have a place even with perfect hand tracking. For selecting things out of arm's reach, it's certainly more precise than pointing."

HoloLens,2zoeh8,BI_Joe,7,Fri Mar 20 07:20:41 2015 UTC,"I have to say, this is an unbelievably frustrating review since it says almost nothing new. However, as the author says, no one else claims to have tried both devices yet, so it's still somewhat interesting.  Edit to add list of new things:   Magic Leap confirmed to create opaque virtual 3D objects. HoloLens does not. (Though using my bag of HoloLens impressions I could also tell you that Ars Technica described HoloLens by saying ""It looked for every bit like the holographic projection we saw depicted in Star Wars and Total Recall. Except that's shortchanging Microsoft's work, because these virtual objects were in fact far more convincing than the washed out, translucent message R2D2 projected, and much better than Sharon Stone's virtual tennis coach. The images were bright, saturated, and reasonably opaque, giving the virtual objects a real feeling of solidity."" Emphasis mine. I wonder if the author of this review inquired about the HoloLens opacity settings at all.) No mention whatsoever of differences in providing depth cues (if you needed further confirmation that HoloLens matches the quality of Magic Leap's light fields in that respect). No mention of occlusion quality or lack thereof. That's kind of encouraging, but mostly just baffling. I've literally read more than three dozen reviews of HoloLens and they're all clueless about how to describe it. Magic Leap either has a really large FOV or its demos were constrained to not push the FOV. Both options are plausible considering the prototype is reportedly a massive contraption with limited mobility. ""I was able to walk around some 3-D objects, such as an X-Wing fighter sitting in front of me; it looked fairly solid up close, though not intricately detailed."" First: awesome. Second: if this is unimpressive, whatever demos Magic Leap showed must have looked ridiculously good, all obvious problems aside. ""That’s not the same, though, as making an augmented reality device that is so useful and slickly packaged that millions of consumers will want to buy it. To do that, HoloLens, Magic Leap, and any other competitors must do much more."" LIKE WHAT!? Is this about the prototype hardware again? Do you think I won't buy something that looks like the final HoloLens design that produces translucent but highly stable holograms that clip outside a certain FOV? The HoloLens press demos are still using the debug hardware. The AirTap tracking can be a bit iffy (this isn't actually new info, even in the on stage demo of the HoloLens you can see the gesture fail to register a couple times). This reviewer tried the HoloStudio demo herself (but didn't describe it in detail because she wants me to suffer) but didn't try the HoloBuilder demo at all. In her earlier review of Magic Leap, she described HoloLens with this: ""2015: Months after Google invests in Magic Leap, Microsoft shows off the HoloLens, which also uses a technology other than stereoscopic 3-D to make virtual objects appear to be intergrated with the real world."" I think she believed prior to the demo that HoloLens was using display tech similar to Magic Leap which helps contextualize the criticism of its display.   tl;dr: The Magic Leap display is better than the HoloLens display, but only on transparency and resolution (and maybe FOV) and that's with the setup that is ""a pair of lenses attached to what looks like metal scaffolding that towers over my head and contains a bunch of electronics and lenses."""
HoloLens,2zoeh8,ralexand56,2,Fri Mar 20 07:24:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sounds like the transparency of the objects and the fov are disappointing on the Hololens.  Had heard about the disappointing fov but the transparency depending on how bad could be a deal breaker for me. So frustrating not being able to try these things out to form my own opinion."
HoloLens,2zoeh8,ralexand56,3,Fri Mar 20 09:30:44 2015 UTC,"FOV and opacity are both still low on my list of concerns. Larger FOV is preferable, but it's not going to be a deal breaker. This is the first I've heard of transparency being a main complaint and the only scenario I'd consider a deal breaker for that is if holograms get washed out to the point it being unusable in natural light. Even then I would still be sorely tempted to get the HoloLens anyway.  The real issues for me are input (making it comfortable for extended use, responsive, natural, and tactile), tracking quality in all environmental conditions, and providing a sufficient resolution/contrast/FOV combination to make reading text on virtual displays convenient."

HoloLens,2zoeh8,autotldr,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:01:00 2015 UTC,"For instance, during the Mars demo, the room around me was blanketed with realistic images of the surface of the planet, and a detailed-looking rover sat in front of me, slightly to my right. But I could only see it one rectangle at a time; if my eyes strayed beyond that rectangle in front of me, I’d see bits of the room, but no hologram   This exactly the same experience with the Moverio glasses. Anything outside of that is reality. Its exactly the same as when you use an AR app on a phone or ipad. Whatever is on the screen is the only thing you see at that time. Thus there is no sprawling minecraft world in front of you, only what that rectangle lets you see.   The issues extended to the opacity of the images, too. The demos were all held in rooms that had no windows, but lighting was kept at a normal level of brightness, and the rooms were decorated with furniture, knick-knacks, and other items on and near the walls—not unlike your average living room, and the kind of environment in which you’d be likely to use a HoloLens if you bought one for yourself. Yet I could often see bits of the room peeking through the images themselves in a way that interrupted, rather than worked with, the illusion   So that tells me they are using see-through AR and not video-through AR. If he didnt complain about lagging images then that means they got the tracking down. So thats good news   HoloLens is also really good at having virtual objects follow the user around. As I chatted with a Microsoft employee over Skype, the simple diagram he drew about how to connect a light switch hovered in the air near the electrical box on the wall, while his video-chat window remained in my field of view, even as I moved about.   Well no shit. Its easy to keep a graphic on at all times on a screen. The tricky part is having it pinned on and tracked in the real world. Sounds like microsoft with it depth cameras can do that quite well though   A key difference compared to Magic Leap was that I was able to walk around some 3-D objects, such as an X-Wing fighter sitting in front of me; it looked fairly solid up close, though not intricately detailed.    Probably because the magic leap rig didnt allow for mobility. But what is being described here is basic AR markerless walk around"
HoloLens,2zmyak,Genesis_Prime,7,Thu Mar 19 22:41:11 2015 UTC,"Someone over in /r/oculus commented that this video shows a virtual robot walking behind a short wall and there's no way the Magic Leap system could have known that there was space there. It's actually somewhat possible if the space had been mapped ahead of time, but it wouldn't be a get-up-and-play experience.  The latest (and pretty much only) news I've heard from Magic Leap is that they don't have a tracking/mapping solution to speak of. They probably have something in the works, and Google certainly has the machine learning expertise required to get them up and running SLAM, but I really don't think they have the hardware to do this well (unless the person playing this game is wearing a monstrous piece of lab equipment).  There was a lot of speculation about an acquisition for Magic Leap, based on their AMA and TED cancellations. That's quite plausible to me, as I don't see why else they'd bail on an easily controlled marketing opportunity like TED.  Taken strictly as a concept video, this still wasn't a particularly good concept video. It'd be great for a student design project, but for a company actually working in this space, it's some pretty sloppy work.   How does a fake gun that's not shooting anything (and is not connected to anything) have that much recoil (or any recoil)? Why are you overlaying blood splatter on the corner of the FOV when that will highlight the edge of the AR region? Why does your overlay lag behind head movement while tracking of virtual objects is super precise? Why do you have so many overlays at all? You do realize that your light field display means that those overlays are at a specific depth away from your face and you'll need to focus your eyes at that depth to see them, right? Why are your gestures so handwavey? Why do so many interface actions depend on precise hand pointing? Do you really think your as-yet-undisclosed hand tracking is that much better than Microsoft's Kinect successor? How the heck is that gun even being tracked? I'll admit that it looks cool, but why are you spinning icons in a circle (you can only properly see the item that is centered/selected at any given time, you get to see a spinning blur while trying to make selections, and it continues to drift after it's been slowed down which could easily cause an incorrect selection especially if combined with imprecise input)? How do you plan to disambiguate between open-handed-swipe-to-scroll and open-handed-swipe-to-dismiss-UI? Why are you using another flat-handed gesture to start the game (it's probably okay, since it's modal, but if you could use any gesture, why not just poke the button with one finger like a normal button instead of thrusting your hand through it -- you're apparently able to detect pinch gestures so finger detection is a thing. The only benefit of this gesture is that it looks like a gesture, but if it's a standard gesture it's again too similar to the other swiping/dismissing gestures)? If your tracking is good enough for perfect occlusion, why is the mapping between hand movements and turret placement so loose in the video? Why would you use hand position to place a turret and then use a downward hand movement to confirm position? Do you want people to always screw up their positioning when they try to confirm it? Would you ever consider flicking your cursor to be a reasonable trigger for a click? Have you ever even used a gestural interface‽    Unfortunately, we couldn’t make it to TED, but we wanted to share one of the things that we’d planned to share at the talk. This is a game we’re playing around the office right now (no robots were harmed in the making of this video).   ...sure it is, Magic Leap."

When you continuously draw that line, you are defining a shape.  Eventually, you stop thinking about the letters altogether and develop muscle memory for that shape.”    For one thing, instead of connecting letters, they developed a new type of QWERTY keyboard with Microsoft Research colleague Bongshin Lee, one in which the letter keys are combined into groups that provide larger target areas than a traditional keyboard with 26 distinct letter keys."

HoloLens,2zlhui,arvr,5,Thu Mar 19 16:05:22 2015 UTC,"It has two small projectors that shine an image in front of half mirror that then bounces the light back into the eyes. Is this any different than how hololens will work?   We don't know the details of the display technology yet, but from what we can tell, it is much more sophisticated than that.  Wired was told that 'a “light engine” above the lenses projects light into the glasses, where it hits the grating and then volleys between the layers of glass millions of times.'  This sounds like a holographic laser projection process. (ie, the projectors are actually projecting a dynamically-created master grating onto a holographic diffraction grating - the resulting interference pattern is what gets reflected back to our eyes.)  One of the benefits of this type of projection is that you can do a close projection with a relatively wide spread, without having a bunch of bulky optics there.  Of course this would also make the name ""HoloLens"" make a lot more sense.  And it would also explain what a ""holographic processing unit"" would do that wouldn't typically be a function of CPU or GPU - taking raster input and outputting the diffraction patterns required to produce an image."
HoloLens,2zlhui,Larry_Mudd,-1,Thu Mar 19 19:32:58 2015 UTC,"the 'light engine' is just marketing hype. its so generic it can apply to anything including just a projector. ""Volleying light between layers of glass a million times"" okay. why wouldnt light bounce around a million times. and if you see how thick the Moverio glasses are it also has layers of glass.  i am open minded and hope you are right. I really do"
HoloLens,2zlhui,Larry_Mudd,5,Thu Mar 19 22:41:52 2015 UTC,"the 'light engine' is just marketing hype.    ""Light engine"" isn't really a marketing term; it has a specific meaning in engineering.  (Well, two specific meanings in engineering, if you want to split hairs, but only one applies here.)  That said, it is generic enough that it could describe a run-of-the-mill LCOS projector.  But ""light engine"" isn't the significant part of that quote - it's the bit about ""bouncing around in a grating.""  That's the part that is unambiguously using the language of holography.  If you're talking about simple optical projection, you don't say you're using a ""grating,"" you're using a ""screen"" or a ""projection surface.""  You certainly don't brag about a surface that bounces the photons around before directing them to your eyes, because that's only going to introduce noise.  What's being described is a scenario where the image depends on that bouncing - it's an interference pattern - a holographic image formed using coherent light.  Terminology aside, you can make inferences about whether HoloLens uses a similar display technology to Moverio by using your eyes.  When you look at Moverio, you can see the picoprojectors, and you can see the angled prisms that they project onto.  They're right there; there's no mystery about how it works.  Now take a look at the HoloLens, and try to impose the same setup on it.  Note that there are no angled surfaces; the lenses are clearly parallel to the eye.  They are also two or three times as wide as Moverio's.  If MS is using holographic laser projection, this makes sense - because this technology allows for a much wider spread across a much smaller distance.  Otherwise - where are the projectors?  Moverio projects an anamorphically distorted image at an oblique angle order to place the projector far enough away from the surface to yield a (barely) practical FOV.    Where are HoloLens' projectors?  Why no oblique surfaces?"

HoloLens,2zlhui,BI_Joe,1 point,Fri Mar 20 05:06:38 2015 UTC,"Naw, I'm just a nerd that's been interested in 3D stuff since the '80s, so I read a bunch of junk.  Built a holography table in the '90s that worked well enough under the circumstances. (Low power laser so long exposure times and lived in an urban environment so I was lucky if one of three exposures worked.)"
HoloLens,2zlhui,BI_Joe,2,Fri Mar 20 12:09:00 2015 UTC,"Before reading the rest of this reply, please think of a response to the following question (preferably without trying to guess where I'm going with this, since I'd genuinely like an honest answer):   Do 3D objects projected with the Epson Moverio seem out of focus with respect to their surroundings? Can you selectively focus on virtual objects at different distances?   Okay. Now that you've done that, compare your answer to the one given by MaximumPC editor Jimmy Thang in his AMA. For additional context/speculation, read this.   I have been very disappointed by the technology. First the FOV is quite small. Its about the size of a 13 inch laptop screen about a 2 feet away. I remember reading some reviews saying the hololens was simliar - maybe a 14 or 15 inch screen.   We need to stop measuring FOV in inches. It's bad enough for HoloLens, but for the Moverio the actual FOV is known and it's 23 degrees (which corresponds to a 10.2 inch screen at 2 feet). I'm not sure if that's diagonally or horizontally, but either way it's very small. 40° is a pessimistic estimate of the HoloLens FOV. People have fixated on the ""tiny"" FOV quote from Sean Hollister, but it's largely been ignored that others like Jeffrey Matuley have said ""HoloLens' image doesn't occupy my entire field of view, but it takes up the lion's share of it with my peripheral vision grounding me to reality."" Note that the FOV of the Oculus DK2 is 88°. The demonstrated HoloLens FOV is tiny in comparison to that. The HoloLens FOV may still appear small to you. Who knows? It's not out yet.   But the worst part is that the closer you get to an object, the smaller that FOV becomes.   If you're measuring in inches, that's true for HoloLens as well. It's also true for your eyes without an HMD. The angle subtended by an object is larger when it's closer to your face.   So when people are saying in the Mars demo that they could look down at the rocks. Well maybe they meant they would see a tiny portion of the rock.   As terrible as tech journalists are, I'd think they'd still be able to communicate that if it were the case. If that were how it worked, surely they wouldn't describe it like this: ""Looking down at my feet, I could see the rocks just inches away."", ""Last week, it looked to me like I was walking on Mars."", ""It’s a totally new perspective that felt like I was immersed in touring Mars, but not necessarily there."", etc.  Admittedly, the sentence after that last quote is ""The field of view felt a little too limited to truly immerse myself and trick my brain into thinking I was really on another planet, but what impressed me most is what Microsoft has built into this experience."" But ""trick my brain into thinking I was really on another planet"" is an almost absurdly high bar, particularly when your peripheral vision is still seeing the room you're in.   Third the device produces some serious headaches and dizzy ness. It becomes unusable after a couple minutes.   The demos tried by reporters last far more than a couple minutes (some said they spent around an hour on them in total)."
HoloLens,2zlhui,BI_Joe,2,Thu Mar 19 19:09:47 2015 UTC,"okay i think you asked this question  ""Do 3D objects projected with the Epson Moverio seem out of focus with respect to their surroundings? Can you selectively focus on virtual objects at different distances?""  If i understand the question you are asking does the focus of an object change based on where i am looking. The answer is no because Moverio has no eye tracking technology. 3D stereoscopic objects are the same as from the film Avatar. things up close are up  between your eyes. things further back are out of focus. The resolution also isnt that great so there is that.  Also the 3D stereo i saw are the SBS example movies. This one of a snake is really nice on Moverio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aObU9rh-z8A&t=73 Still its an eyesore to get through it.   But 3D Stereo in AR in moverio is close to impossible to find. There is a good reason. The device is too slow to update the graphics based on the sub milimeter movements of our head. So the result is that images ghost - they lag behind.  Again a limitation of the device.  Will hololens Holographic Processing chip fix that? Maybe. who knows. but if they dont solve that problem then forget it. the experience will be crap  As for field of view it needs to be big enough to allow for enough view of a scene. for example say you have a ping pong game. If you try to track the ball with your eye as it bounces to your side, you will only see a small frame. Making the game play unsatisfactory. Most games then woudl have to be a 3/4 top down view - the typical RPG overhead game.   lastly as for the dizziness i agree this is probably not an issue since no one complained about it. Perhaps there was some kool aid they had before the demo to numb their senses"
HoloLens,2zlhui,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Thu Mar 19 22:38:40 2015 UTC,"At this point, all we can do is wait for more information on HoloLens. Thanks for sharing your experience with the Epson Moverio, I'm really interested in how people describe their experiences with any HMD.  For me, your (bad) experience with the Moverio is somewhat reassuring, because it furthers my feeling that the HoloLens is almost certainly not using the same sort of display tech.  I don't think the HoloLens prototypes tried by journalists had active eye tracking (the gaze pointer was tied to head movement, not eye movement) but reporters still didn't notice virtual objects being out of focus. They should have noticed objects being out of focus, since those objects appeared next to real-world objects at various distances. The only reasonable interpretation of all the reviews I've read is that the HoloLens somehow provides accurate accommodation cues, solving vergence-accommodation conflict. If true, that is profoundly different than the Epson Moverio and similar headsets (the only company even claiming to do this is Magic Leap). If HoloLens does not provide any accommodation cues... I don't know how to plausibly finish this sentence, it's just not conceivable to me that that wouldn't have been noticeable.   Will hololens Holographic Processing chip fix that? Maybe. who knows.   I don't think you can really use the ""who knows"" clause in this instance, since nearly everyone who wrote about the HoloLens specifically commented on the lack of lag. It may perform worse in different conditions or if the miniaturized version is worse than the prototype, but the device as demoed did solve lag.  It's fine to be skeptical about the HoloLens. I can see why you'd be skeptical after trying Moverio/Cardboard, but I think the answer to your original question is simply that yes, HoloLens will be different."
HoloLens,2zlhui,BI_Joe,1 point,Fri Mar 20 00:51:38 2015 UTC,"i dont think there is an issue with objects being in and out of focus.  I am not sure what you are trying to determine or what you think Hololens has solved in this area. Basically if you have a virtual projected screen (or an object in transparent mode), your eye will focus on it and not really care about whats around it. If i put an AR marker on the laptop screen, the 3D object in front of me gets all my attention and focus. I dont notice that the laptop edges are out of focus. In fact I cant because the moment i look at them they become focused.   What im curious to know (since you did that big awesome collection of write ups) is if anyone said the objects were truly transparent. Because it is not possible to have black completetly transparent. its just black. Though that is the case with LED projection not laser. So if hololens is lasers then that will not be an issue  As for lack of lag, i dont think the journalists had a baseline to know what normal was and i think they were in a demo situation where they had to focus more on going through the scripted situation than noticing how things moved in and out of place. Also microsoft had them in a special set with their lighitng and colors of choice to make these things harder to detect"
HoloLens,2zlhui,abs159,3,Fri Mar 20 01:10:15 2015 UTC,"On the focus issue, it may be hard to judge on most AR headsets, because most of them will sensibly not try to present a mixed-reality scene. When you have a demo like the Minecraft one, where you could carve holes in real furniture, people are going to be looking at real furniture and the illusory virtual geometry at the same time. As you say, that's essentially impossible if one of the two goes out of focus when you look at it. The fact that they can place a virtual object in physical geometric contact with real objects and have that illusion be even remotely compelling is hugely telling.   What im curious to know (since you did that big awesome collection of write ups) is if anyone said the objects were truly transparent. Because it is not possible to have black completetly transparent. its just black.   I'm not exactly sure what you're asking. The objects are translucent. If there is a bright enough material behind them, it will be visible. The HoloLens cannot project darkness (as Alex Kipman himself will tell you). The HoloLens is apparently surprisingly good at convincing people that it does project darkness, but that may simply be due to the shaded visor.  Some people did try to test lag by moving around as quickly as the bulky prototype gear allowed. You should also know from your experiences with other AR sets that lag in AR is quite perceptible even if you're not looking for it. That would be even more true if the AR image was pinned to physical objects where lag would be highlighted by misalignment. I have seen some people say there was slight lag in the position of the floating window in the Skype demo. This is odd, as I'd expect the Minecraft and OnSight demos to be much more likely to show lag. I'm guessing that either the Skype demo room was harder to track than the others or the reviewers who commented on lag in that demo may have confused a smoothing animation on the window for lag. The reviewers who were most focused on technical details and latency did not comment on this supposed Skype lag."

HoloLens,2z9tkn,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:36:30 2015 UTC,"The following example caught my eye (I've removed the reference numbers for readability):  ""In another example where the user is walking along a crowded city sidewalk among many other pedestrians, the first rule may adjust the reality factor of the flaming asteroid to a low level such that the asteroid is clearly unrealistic. For example, the asteroid may be rendered with a high degree of transparency. In this manner, the user is unlikely to mistake the holographic asteroid for a real asteroid, and may devote her attention to the current activity along the sidewalk.""  Years ago, I remember reading about an advertisement for a movie where they ""decorated"" the outside of a building along a busy highway (in California, I think) to make it look like it had been destroyed from an asteroid or comet or something. It caused so much on-looker traffic that the advertising agency was forced to take it down.  So this makes me question: Will ""holographic app designers"" be forced to use an ""acceptable"" amount of transparency in order to keep it from appearing too realistic, which would otherwise induce panic? Granted I doubt we'll see too many people in public, on the sidewalks wearing the HoloLens (I bet there will be a few though). But if/when the technology becomes small enough to fit in standard reading glasses, or even contacts, will a law or governing board (ESRB?) need to be created to minimize the realism of holograms/graphics, sort of along the PEGI and maturity ratings we have for video games today?  Some food for thought which I'm sure is being discussed somewhere."

The Mars (OnSight) demo was obviously a highlight for many space exploration fans as it involved a virtual trip to Mars facilitated by NASA. The Minecraft demo was frequently referred to as the most fun and had people saying things like ""I’m not a gaming guy. But now I kind of want to be one."" (Venture Beat). But the Skype demo received at least as many accolades and even some gaming sites were calling it the most compelling of the demos. The only demo that didn't receive much love was the Holo Studio one and that was because everyone wanted to try it themselves instead of watching someone else."
HoloLens,2z7bhd,hologram-engineer,2,Mon Mar 16 21:01:14 2015 UTC,Amazing post. Thanks!
HoloLens,2z7bhd,toejamfloyd,2,Mon Mar 16 06:03:30 2015 UTC,"I read over a few reviews. Here are the summaries to save you time. If you someone could add summaries from other reviews, it would be appreciated.   Controlled Test Environment:   Microsoft’s demonstrations were highly scripted and completely controlled.   The demos were all held in rooms that had no windows, but lighting was kept at a normal level of brightness.   There were four demonstrations: Skype, Minecraft, Mars Rover, Holostudio. The Verge's article describes each demonstration in good detail.   Hololens Physical Properties:   The hardware shown to the media was only a prototype, a two-piece unit that included a heavy battery attachment and a cord that tethered the machine to a computer.  When you put on the device, which looks a lot like ski goggles, you see three-dimensional digital controls — like buttons, lines and pictures... The holograms did not have very high resolution, and sometimes they were a little dull. Yet they were crisp enough to instantly create the illusion of reality — which was far more than I was expecting.  The depth camera has a field of vision that spans 120 by 120 degrees—far more than the original Kinect—so it can sense what your hands are doing even when they are nearly outstretched. Sensors flood the device with terabytes of data every second, all managed with an onboard CPU, GPU and first-of-its-kind HPU (holographic processing unit). Yet, Kipman points out, the computer doesn’t grow hot on your head, because the warm air is vented out through the sides. On the right side, buttons allow you to adjust the volume and to control the contrast of the hologram.  There are few ways to interact: *Glance: you point your head at something. *AirTap: you make a ""Number 1"" sign with your hand, then move your finger down like you're depressing a lever. *Voice: you can issue commands, usually to switch what ""tool"" you're using. *Mouse: So actually the neatest thing is that objects you use to interact with computers can be used to interact with holograms.   Opinions  NY Times:    It blew me away. And it suggests that interacting with holograms could become an important part of how we use machines in the future... For me, the main shortcoming in HoloLens was its gesture mechanism. To select objects, you look in a certain direction, then tap your finger in the air. But there was a bit of a lag between when I tapped and when the machine registered it, and it was also difficult to point precisely.    Wired:    After exploring Mars, I don’t want to remove the headset, which has provided a glimpse of a combination of computing tools that make the unimaginable feel real.   Verge:    It's immersive, but not nearly as immersive as proper virtual reality is... you look down at the coffee table and there's a castle sitting right on the damn thing. It's not shimmery, but it's not quite real, either. It's just sitting there, perfectly flat on the table, reacting in space to your head movements. It's nearly as lifelike as the actual table, and there's no lag at all. The castle is there. It's simply magic. On Skype -  It might sound gimmicky, but the applications here are truly impressive. On control: It's wildly impressive that these objects really do feel like they're out there in your living room, but it's equally depressing to know that you can't treat them like real objects.   Frobes:    Microsoft appears to have cracked the code on early face wearables... I am considering the HoloLens as a productivity device first and entertainment second.   IGN:    “Holy cow.” Unlike virtual-reality headsets, the HoloLens leaves a sense of openness... I felt more like I wearing glasses than a helmet blocking out everything else in the room. Resolution and latency also seem to be something that could drag down the experience. In early concept demos like these, hitches like the slight delay in seeing Skype’s video chat window move with me are fine for now, but could tank the experience whenever the final hardware releases. Fine response to very precise finger movement also isn’t yet present; when digging up specific blocks in the Minecraft-themed demo, there’s a bit of that noticeable, Kinect-esque margin of error...   Business Insider:    The resolution may not be particularly high. It may give some people headaches, or nausea, or who knows what... But it felt a lot more finished than Oculus.. And most important, it felt a lot more like a general-purpose computing tool, with a ton of potential applications for consumers and businesses.   MIT:    After trying demos of Magic Leap and HoloLens, it’s clear that commercializing augmented reality technology will be difficult... Unlike Oculus Rift, HoloLens did not make me feel nauseous. But I was not blown away by what I saw in Redmond. The holograms looked great in a couple of instances, such as when I peered at the underside of a rock on a reconstruction of the surface of Mars, created with data from the Curiosity rover. More often, though, images appeared distractingly transparent and not nearly as crisp as the creatures Magic Leap showed me some months before. What’s more, the relatively narrow viewing area in front of my face meant the 3-D imagery seen through HoloLens was often interrupted by glimpses of the unenhanced world on the periphery. The headset also wasn’t closed off to the world around me, so I still had my natural peripheral vision of the unenhanced room. This was okay when looking at smaller or farther-away 3-D images, like an underwater scene I was shown during my first demo, or while moving around to inspect images close-up from different angles. The illusion got screwed up, though, when it came to looking at something larger than my field of view.   The most impressive part of the HoloLens demos was the use of sensors to track where I was looking and gesturing, as well as what I was saying. My gaze was effectively a mouse, accurately highlighting what I was looking at.  Despite the issues yet to be overcome, Microsoft is making progress toward getting the technology behind HoloLens into a device you can actually wear. That’s not the same, though, as making an augmented reality device that is so useful and slickly packaged that millions of consumers will want to buy it. To do that, HoloLens, Magic Leap, and any other competitors must do much more."

HoloLens,2z7bhd,ralexand56,3,Mon Mar 16 21:52:43 2015 UTC,"There have been no reports of sickness. I'm also not aware of any reports of sickness with the HTC Vive (with the exception of this Reddit post mentioning headaches).  Sickness is much more likely if the virtual environment moves while you stay still. Controlling a character's movement in an FPS with a gamepad would likely cause sickness with the HTC Vive and could potentially also cause sickness with HoloLens. However, if VR/AR experiences are designed properly neither device should make you ill. Even with first-person gamepad-controlled movement, HoloLens is less likely to induce sickness because of the grounded peripheral view and adjustable transparency of the image.  Compared to the devices you've tried, even the DK2 should be much better as it at least has 6DOF head tracking."

She probably did see different hardware than all the other reviewers, but I don't know if it would be better (because it was an exclusive demo) or worse (because it was three months before any other demo). Her description of the visuals is the most positive of any review, but she ends the article with a section saying there's a long way yet to go and not to expect a ""holiday best seller"" despite there being ""no misfires"" in her experience."

The really bothersome quote from the article is that Oculus management isn't worried about Vive.

HoloLens,2z5k3l,arvr,2,Sun Mar 15 23:17:35 2015 UTC,"He is thinking about the old way to do AR.  Which is slap something of a 2D image on the screen and put it into your reality.  HoloLens is way different than that.  You are taking a true 3D object and putting it into your reality, but it knows about the physics of your room and it knows about the materials in the room and can use the physics of your room and can interact with it.  Also it can do pseudo VR using Virtual Environments like that Mars app that NASA is going to use to drive the rover.  Both Vive and Oculus won't have a chance when HoloLens comes out this fall.   I would imagine that a next generation MineCraft is going to come with HoloLens and Microsoft is going to really push it and we haven't even seen what it can do with Xbox one games yet.    HoloLens is truly mobile without any wires and truly social and will be easy for anyone to set-up and play.  Vive will sell some I am sure, but I just don't think it's going to be a massive success beyond some nerds on the Internet.   I think Vive is a game changer though, but the software is the most important part, without that it's just a useless device."

HoloLens,2z5k3l,SimpleWireFree,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:43:31 2015 UTC,Errr…no release dates yet for any version.
HoloLens,2z5k3l,BlastNastier,0,Fri Mar 20 01:02:35 2015 UTC,"Both Vive and Oculus won't have a chance when HoloLens comes out this fall.   Why do you say that. nothing is stopping them from adding a face forward camera, an intel 3D depth sensor, and opening up the peripherals and doing the same as Hololens. In fact they could just come out with a seperate AR goggles and have two products."
HoloLens,2z5k3l,arvr,8,Sun Mar 15 23:19:50 2015 UTC,They can barely get a vr device out. How are they going to get a AR device out with a camera etc. by this fall. And who wants to view the real world through a camera vs. with their own eyes anyway.
HoloLens,2z5k3l,ralexand56,6,Sun Mar 15 23:51:01 2015 UTC,"All of that already adds in expense and won't be the same result as what Microsoft is providing with Hololens.  What a lot of people don't understand is that a lot of people think Microsoft is a dinosaur in the industry.  However, Microsoft has been building Research and Development since the early 1990's and took a lot of people from ""Bell Labs"" and so over time there has been a lot of R&D that has been done and a lot of money backing this R&D for the company overall.  There is a serious amount of brain power being used here and is now being put into products.  As much as I love VR, it's mainly for ""nerds"" right now and that is going to be the extent of it.  It's not ready for primetime and it won't for a while.  People think that AR is actually less developed than VR and this is true if you exclude Microsoft.   Watch E3 and Gamescom for more details and of course at Build for development.   I am telling you now that Microsoft's HoloLens is a lot more advanced than people think and is ready for primetime this holiday and people are going to be blown away.  I am not saying this as hype, I am saying it because HoloLens isn't something new and isn't a reaction to VR.  Microsoft started with HoloLens research with their R&D group going all the way back to 2008.    So, the software that is being released this fall has been in development for about 2 to 2.5 years.  Also, I am not impressed with VR using anything less than Direct3D 12.  It's stupid to use anything else other than Direct3D 12.  Windows 10 is a free upgrade for anyone with Windows 7/Windows 8/Windows 8.1 and has updates for free for the lifetime of the device.   Not only that, but has Direct 3D 12 which gives you free performance upgrades using the same hardware in some cases going from 28 frames per second to 93 frames per second using the same hardware.  If I am going to put out VR, I am going to do it as something new with Windows 10 and let that marketing help drive the adoption of my device (If I wouldn't do this, Microsoft will with HoloLens).  Plus giving me free performance on older devices mean that my games can be played even with older hardware and that makes a lot of sense."

HoloLens,2z5k3l,arvr,3,Mon Mar 16 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"Couldn't overcome Google for what?  Android?  Their internal politics have held themselves back in the past.  The key word here is ""in the past"".  As in not relevant to ""Today"".  Google has their own failures which is why the only Google product I use is their search engine.  There are roads littered with Google failures and cancelled products which is why you should stay away from anything labeled Google in the future, because it's unlikely to see the light of day.  I avoid Google whenever possible and not for political reasons, but reasons based on history.  I have been burned by them cancelling products in the past.  Never again will I make that mistake.

XBox One for example debuted at $500, this piece of hardware would be significantly more expensive.    There is further speculation of price here and they think of it a little higher, but in general, I don't think that we'll see $500 unless they're willing to take significant losses on this product in it's first generation.    It's a standalone product, so it doesn't go with a PC like some other products.    Does anyone hope it's NOT cheap?  I don't know if I feel that or not, I wonder what you might think."

This time the products they are contributing to are very real, ready to deliver and heading to consumers (not just nerds w/ $1500 to burn) in big numbers, so I went back in for a few hundred shares a little while back.  What it comes down to is that AR / VR tech will be the big ticket item of Christmas 2015 and HIMX is really well positioned to provide the bits and pieces for it.    It's also nice that they aren't bleeding cash or anything....they are already profitable, reasonably priced and have paid a dividend for several years now.

Imagine switching different death cases in front of you for a pathology class. This will be insane and will speed up the learning process of the medical students. However, forget the simple 3d models of the heart like in some of the Apple keynotes. The real human body is one kind of mess and sometimes you don't know if it's a nerve or a blood vessel or even some part of a muscle or some other tissue. There is a huge need for some very detailed 3d scanners, because tomography has its limitations in the current form.

HoloLens,2yf8ms,BI_Joe,3,Tue Mar 10 02:07:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're showing with those images; the FOV in them doesn't appear particularly large. If you're assuming the HoloLens will only be able to create a screen the size of the one shown in those pictures from the distance shown in the pictures, that's actually a tiny field of view. For a demonstration of why it would be a restrictive view, consider this image from the same video: you'd need a much larger FOV to see the holographic dog, soccer game on the table, Netflix screen, and the music player at the same time as seen in that shot.  Keep in mind that many of the people complaining about the small FOV are comparing it to VR headsets with 100+ degree horizontal FOV.  Edit: I'm currently using a 15 inch wide display at a distance of 22 inches; recreating this would require a horizontal FOV of only 38 degrees. One report from the hands-on demos said that it was ""like a 16x9-ish monitor floating about 7 to 8 inches just in front of your face."" Assuming the width of that ""monitor"" was a mere eight inches, that's an FOV of 53 degrees by 31 degrees. If we assume a width of 12 inches at a depth of 8 inches, that's 74 degrees; 16 inches at 8 inches is 90 degrees. A 40 inch 16x9 TV is 35 inches wide and would be within a 60 degree horizontal FOV at a distance of 31 inches. That seems pretty close to the distances involved in the second shot posted above. In comparison, a 100 degree horizontal FOV would give you a screen more than double that size at the same distance."
HoloLens,2yf8ms,ilovegoogleglass,2,Tue Mar 10 02:45:44 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good FOV, what are you smoking, especially with AR displays being less than 35 degrees in today's age? I'm talking bout for augmented reality. ;)  I never implied that you could see the dog and the soccer ball, with that you would need a FOV of 150°+ just to see a little bit of the dog in it's current position.    Journalists have been reporting Hololens prototypes to be basically a galaxy note/iPad from a arm length away, that's what I call small/disappointing. That adequates roughly to a ~ 40° FOV. With the first picture I showed, It displayed a FOV of about ~60° or greater which is more appealing. Getting it to this is a accomplishment in it's own right. https://i.imgur.com/GmAy01B.jpg   I'm currently using a 15 inch wide display at a distance of 22 inches; recreating this would require a horizontal FOV of only 38 degrees.    To be exact that would be a FOV 19° of 37°.   One report from the hands-on demos said that it was ""like a 16x9-ish monitor floating about 7 to 8 inches just in front of your face.[2] "" Assuming the width of that ""monitor"" was a mere eight inches, that's an FOV of 53 degrees by 31 degrees.   We don't know that for sure, that reporter didn't specify an estimate display size, which basically tells us nothing. We could guess that he meant a 20 inch monitor (common monitor size) from 7/8 inches, which gets at a 68° 102° FOV, which is really not bad, but sounds off (based on conflicting reports). Eurogamer reports a FOV of a 15 inch monitor from a foot away which equals to about a 35° 64° FOV.    If we assume a width of 12 inches at a depth of 8 inches, that's 74 degrees; 16 inches at 8 inches is 90 degrees.    Are you sure about that, the FOV is not that at those parameters.  Keep in mind that he theoretically sees all of this from this distance from the wall or he has to turn his head just to focus on things in the video (which is unrealistic). https://i.imgur.com/Cnc2S1D.jpg  Edit: Fact check"

I'm talking bout for augmented reality. ;)   I agree, which is one of the reasons I'm not worried about the HoloLens FOV. However, I do think most of the media reports of a ""tiny"" FOV come from people expecting VR-sized FOV which it would be very surprising for HoloLens to achieve.   Journalists have been reporting Hololens prototypes to be basically a galaxy note/iPad from a arm length away, that's what I call small/disappointing.   Fair enough. That estimate is on the smaller end of what I've heard, but I could see why it would be disappointing.  We seem to disagree about how FOV is calculated by a considerable amount. I might well be doing it wrong or misunderstanding how it's defined. I've posted a figure to Imgur that shows how I'm calculating it. It looks right to me, but I'd be happy to be corrected if I'm making an embarrassing trig error.  Technical considerations aside, the first HoloLens article I saw was the Rock Paper Shotgun review and their description sold me on it regardless of what the FOV ends up being:   Unlike VR headsets like the Oculus Rift, the HoloLens only takes up a small part of your field of vision—depending on where you turn your head to look—and uses voice and gesture commands. Although the office around me and the two Microsoft employees next to me are clearly visible in my peripheral vision, so is the holographic world projected in front of it. Wherever I look, Mars appears. In a strange way, they both seem real, two layers of reality coexisting in a way that sounds cacophonous but feels oddly intuitive.   Edit: Having looked into it further, I really think your FOV calculations are incorrect. A 15 inch monitor 12 inches away corresponds to an angle of 64 degrees. RoadToVR also had this to say about Google Glass: ""The display section tells us that the display is ‘the equivalent of a 25 inch high definition screen from eight feet away’ which is a very long and annoying way to say that the Google Glass has a field of view is ~14.7 degrees (diagonally)."" My calculations give 14.8 degrees, but that's close enough to be a rounding error.  My view is that the HoloLens FOV as demoed to reporters is already in excess of 45 degrees and may be up to 60 degrees (horizontal). That may simply not be enough to please VR fans."

The depth cameras use time-of-flight - the light is emitted by the headset.

HoloLens,2y6uk0,kn33,3,Sat Mar 7 00:45:41 2015 UTC,"Well, for sure there'll be stand-alone HoloLens games, but games that offer trans-screen experiences between HoloLens or PC will have a lot of appeal.  Say you've got a game that has Xbox/HoloLens integration - you're getting a lot more than just a screen.  You're getting a natural and familiar input scheme, and (more importantly) a lot more processing power.  Think of it like a host/client connection between Xbox and HoloLens - Xbox constantly streaming x,y,z,v of the holographic elements to be rendered by HoloLens. You have all the benefits of a game on a big screen, but with elements extended beyond the screen.  One of Microsoft's HoloLens-related patents notes that an added benefit of the opacity filter used to mask out real world light behind the AR elements to make them seem solid is that it can be driven to make the headset simultaneously function as active shutter glasses for a 3D television.  Taken all together, think of what you could do with all these elements.  You've got a game console that can fill the screen up with pretty graphics, and a Kinect unit so it sees the room and knows where the player is.  You've got the HoloLens providing pinpoint head tracking and also mapping the play space.    So the game world is rendered on screen, and it crosses over into the real world.  They are mapped together to create a seamless space.  Because the game knows exactly where the player's head is, the on-screen world is rendered from the correct point of view, making it appear as though you're looking through a Window.  (Like this, if that seems obscure.)  If you have a 3D television, this illusion can be further enhanced by using the HoloLens' shutterglass feature.  So you're walking around your livingroom with a controller in hand.  The enemy base is rendered in the TV.  Your base is on the coffee table - or maybe the couch - wherever you've placed it.  Game is half choplifter, half tower defense.  You place your turrets and defenses around the room.  You use the controller to fly a helicopter out of the base, pick up soldiers at the barracks you've built on the floor, fly into the television, evade the enemy AA, dogfight the enemy copter, drop your grunts off for a raid, let loose some vulcan missles, tear out and get back to your base for repairs, oh, damn they snuck in and they're tearing up your base.  Clean that up!  Oh, and that beautifully-rendered world on the other side of the TV is abstracted from the online player's living-room.  When you fly in to the TV, he sees your heli fly out.  That's one hypothetical scenario - but the point is, games that will use Xbox (or PC) + HoloLens have a lot of potential."

But I still have faith in a AR/Mixed reality visor specifically made for Xbox One alongside Hololens in the near future (in fact E3 2015) being announced. I speculate this will be the low cost consumer offering through Xbox One. Many people speculate Hololens to be $500+, and having a Xbox derivative for ~$200 without the bells and whistles would be exciting.

HoloLens,2y6uk0,Larry_Mudd,3,Sat Mar 7 15:39:53 2015 UTC,"It's not really a ""proof of concept"" - that'd be a working test of a concept.  This guy looked at the leaked documents that referenced Fortaleza and attempted a mock up of what it might be like.  It's successful in a limited sense - it's a nice illustration of how holographics in your living-room may look.  Have to agree that it would be disappointing if that's what we were actually getting, though.  It looks like the designer assumed everything would be sort of washed out looking and that the actual environment would be obscured to a large degree - and it's hard to overlook that the simulated AR elements don't add anything to the ""game.""  Of course it's silly to judge a quick visualization like this as though it were a real game.  I don't think many people anticipated how vibrant, opaque and well-integrated the display appears to be.  It looks like MS is poised to over-deliver on expectations we had a couple years ago.  Back around the time this video was made, I remember being cautiously optimistic about Fortaleza - contingent on what display tech they went with.  (I was worried it might be a beam splitter/prism type display like Glass!)"

It'd be nice to have more traffic to the general-purpose AR subs.  /r/windows10 at the moment is basically a support forum for the Windows Insider preview of the desktop/tablet/mobile OS. In its current state, it doesn't have a whole lot of relevance to Windows Holographic.  At some point, it may be possible to have organized subreddit networks for AR / VR / Windows Holographic / whatever, but that can wait until devices are actually commercially available. I'm not the one who would have to organize it though, so anything the mods do is fine by me."

I envision the ability to do normal day-to-day things in one place for all devices. Something like being able to set alarms on any device that is linked to your Microsoft account and push that alarm to all devices or a specific device (for example, while using your Hololens you remember that you need to set an alarm for tomorrow, instead of getting your phone you can simply set the alarm from inside your Hololens and set it to occur only on your phone).  I think that you should be able to push data from a universal app to another device running that same app. I don't think this would be too difficult, and seems to be what they are aiming to do with their cloud services.  Of course all of these things are probably available or capable in some form or another, but if it can be done natively that would be much better."

HoloLens,2xk226,rodcliftonOH,7,Sun Mar 1 12:48:57 2015 UTC,"I think omnidirectional treadmills are a niche product for VR enthusiasts, and don't really offer much of practical use for an AR device.  Treadmills are appealing for people who want VR experience with a lot of mobility who are also susceptible to motion sickness.  This is useful when your aim is to render large environment that the player moves around in.  If your movement controls are disconnected from your actual body's movements (particularly turning and accelerating,) this can trigger nausea for a lot of people.  This kind of disconnect will almost never be an issue with HoloLens apps, because of the fundamental difference between AR and VR apps - rather than being totally disconnected from the physical space, the AR app works in that space.   Of course you could run a VR-style app on HoloLens, but it wouldn't be a good fit for the device - and anyone willing to splash out for a treadmill for a VR experience won't blink at the relatively low price point of a VR HMD that's better suited to delivering that sort of experience.  It's already such a niche product that there's some doubt about how well it will be supported for Oculus Rift.  I can't imagine any developers supporting omnidirectional treadmills for HoloLens apps; there's no sense in it."

If it's not internal, that's even more exciting. I'm hugely envious of everyone getting said training now one way or another.

Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO) said that Hololens's roll out will be slow at first but they want to captivate devs then business, after all that's done consumers. Since this a new paradigm expect it to be $499-$999, but wouldn't hurt for Microsoft to have entry level model with lower specs to accommodate a affordable price point.  Personally I think a head mounted display will be announce for Xbox One exclusively at E3 as well. I think it will be built on the same display technology Hololens has and virtual reality but it's a much more cheaper variant for experiencing holograms in your living room."
HoloLens,2xjnc6,ilovegoogleglass,2,Sun Mar 1 15:00:07 2015 UTC,"$499-$999.   Not a chance.  Really I expect it to be much more like $1500-$2000.  Here's the reasons' I think so;  Compare it to Oculus for example;   HoloLens has pico projectors that project onto your eye.  Oculus has a pair of simple LCD screens. HoloLens has a pair of forward facing, probably-Kinect like sensors to map the world.  Oculus has but a simple webcam planned to face forward. HoloLens will have custom silicon in the form of the HPU.  Oculus doesn't have any such thing. HoloLens has 3D audio output and voice control.  Oculus only has 3d audio planned. HoloLens has iris-tracking, this will probably necessitate another set of 'inward facing' cameras.  Oculus is merely a pair of screen strapped in front of your face.  Vastly less sophisticated input scheme. HoloLens has built in power.  Oculus requires to be plugged into the wall.   Oculus is already at $350 - it's little more than a smartphone strapped in front of your face.  In short, the two devices are world's apart, and we already see Oculus at $350.  There is NO WAY HoloLens will be anything less than $1500-2000.  Custom silicon, a pile more sensors, integrated power, 3D audio / microphones etc etc etc.  This is going to be ultra-book priced.  AND, I'll be preordering at least one."
HoloLens,2xjnc6,abs159,2,Sun Mar 1 20:29:16 2015 UTC,"Let's bet! $1500-$2000 is an extremely absurd price for the components that it wields. This will be nothing more than a smartphone with a fancy mobile processor and projector based display. I don't see a couple pico projectors, a HPU that's rumored to be a ASIC, 3D audio, and iris tracker adding $1000 more to actually cost of it. I think you're overestimating the cost of what's already possible here. Microsoft isn't reinventing the wheel here. You and I shouldn't even be trying to estimate the price when we basically don't know anything about the device. For all we know it could be a high end tablet soc."
HoloLens,2xjnc6,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Sun Mar 1 22:35:01 2015 UTC,"You and abs159 can bet on it, I wouldn't take either side. Where Microsoft is concerned, hardware pricing is really hard to guess.  By all rights, abs159 should be right considering the hardware that's packed into HoloLens... if it were being developed by a startup. The amount of money spent over seven years of development would normally require a massive price tag to recoup R&D costs and make the investment worthwhile. The parts alone are quite expensive and would easily total over $2000 if bought separately... but you can't even buy them separately because some of them are being custom produced.  There's often talk of Microsoft ""subsidizing"" products. In some ways, it doesn't make sense to talk of HoloLens in those terms because the material cost of its parts is insignificant in comparison to its development costs. If Microsoft sells the HoloLens at a ""break-even"" price, it's already hugely subsidized. They may well choose to do that given the importance of dominating AR as ""the next PC"", but the HoloLens has cost them at least hundreds of millions to develop. For a company like Oculus (prior to $2B Facebook acquisition), they would need to earn that back relatively quickly to pay investors. For Microsoft, research is just a cost of staying in business and at this point can be considered a sunk cost as it's already factored into their reports to investors for the past decade.  By that reasoning, abs159 may be overestimating the cost. On the other hand, Microsoft still wants to earn as much money as they possibly can for their investors. If companies with comparable hardware are selling it for $2000, Microsoft won't sell it for $200 even if won't bankrupt them. If they're not worried about competing AR and VR systems, they should sell for whatever price will get them the most amount of profit. That means their original price should be very high as there are some people who'd be willing to pay almost anything to own this device. They'd then lower prices over time to profit from everyone else who want the device but aren't willing to pay quite so much. That Econ 101 view of the situation still doesn't tell us how on earth they'll price it though, because there is a lot of competition in this area and it's hard to know exactly what the demand is for AR of this caliber since it's an entirely new market.  So yeah, I have no idea what the price will be and I don't think anyone else does either. $500 would be ludicrous though; I would be shocked if the initial release were that low. That's the release price of the Surface RT (without keyboard) for a machine that's way more powerful and features a highly specialized display system plus advancements on the Kinect technology."

""They may even carry on a conversation.""  Note the Hololens obviously cannot provide telepresence of the wearer to another viewer since its cameras are all outward facing. The patent also describes the AR device being connected to a hub computing system (""a computer, a gaming system or console, or the like"") with ""one or more capture devices,"" and notes ""An application may be executing on hub computing system, the display device, [...] a mobile device, or a combination of these.""  What I'm picturing is Xbox Fitness built up with more social features.  The application could use the stream from the Kinect on the console to drive a model rendered on the remote user's HoloLens, and vice-versa.  You might both be following an exercise routine on the TV screen, and each seeing a representation of the other beside you in the Kinect playspace. I could see how this might be motivating for some people.  It'd be interesting to see exactly how something like that would be implemented, because there are different approaches you could take.  Most practical would probably be to just use the skeletal tracking data to drive an avatar - this would be easiest on bandwidth and work best in the sense that you could view the ""person"" from any angle it would look correct.  On the other hand, there's a lot of abstraction there.  (They might use something like the champion creator in Kinect Sports Rivals to make it more personal.)  You could use a quick-and-dirty model generated on the fly from the depth camera and textured with the RGB camera, but (apart from using a lot more bandwidth and processing) it would put the ""hollow"" in hologram - it would only look right when you're facing the other person directly.  On the plus side, you'd see the person's expressions best that way.  Sounds like something that'll be a real trip, anyway."

HoloLens,2xbgnl,abs159,2,Sun Mar 1 21:27:15 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking this might be the coin collecting game described in the Wired article:   I play a game in which a character jumps around a real room, collecting coins sprinkled atop a sofa and bouncing off springs placed on the floor.    Wired seem to have more access than anyone else, since they also got to directly try Holo Studio.  Edit: this dude! -- here's his part in the ""Possibilities"" trailer. It's a little alien that runs around furniture and collects creatures in orbs."
HoloLens,2xbgnl,ilovegoogleglass,2,Fri Feb 27 07:11:50 2015 UTC,Makes me wonder if this what they were talking about.  http://i.gyazo.com/57cfb41d9d8011c5ac22f0cea261eff4.gif
HoloLens,2xbgnl,ilovegoogleglass,3,Fri Feb 27 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I strongly suspect that this is Orbus. The design fits well with the icon and name and it makes sense for that game to be one of the 9 example HoloLens icons since it was one of 5 demos shown to press (even if only Wired saw it).  Another thing I just noticed in the Wired piece is that Jessi says this:   I collaborate with a motorcycle designer Skyping in from Spain to paint a three-dimensional fender atop a physical prototype.   That sounds remarkably similar to the concept video footage of a designer tweaking a virtual overlay on a motorcycle, which is the part of the concept video that seems the most far-fetched.  I may be getting overhyped now, but I'm starting to think that they have working prototypes of pretty much everything in the concept video. The 3D modelling program shown in this image is clearly an Autodesk product (the ViewCube® is a giveaway as well as the ribbon) and there's no way that they're just happening to show that without Autodesk being involved."
HoloLens,2xbgnl,abs159,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:53:22 2015 UTC,"Good eye ;)   I really think Hololens will release this Holiday, I think the main thing on there ""to do"" list is getting software for it. Like, they've already shown the semi final production model, showed a live demo of it, let journalist try a early prototype of it, and they're already talking about Devs getting their own kits in the spring. Someone tell me they're not in primetime. ;)   When they say they're still in early development I think they mean in regards to there's more things to do, for example getting actual software. They have roughly less than year. Bear in mind this was meant to be released last year according to rumors and leaks.   Personally I think there will be different models of Hololens when it releases. Here's the most realistic sku possibilities imo....   1: Hololens & Hololens Pro: Hololens Pro would be the professional and prosumer version of Hololens with bumped up specs for the demanding productivity market. Hololens will be the affordable version marketed towards anyone, it works standalone but can integrated with your existing windows/xbox devices.  2: Hololens & Hololens for Xbox One: Hololens for Xbox One would be the streamlined version of Hololens meant exclusively for Xbox One. It allows you to play games in a revolutionary new one way by relatively turning your living room into the display. While playing a game, assets, models and characters can fly right out of your TV bringing the game into your living room. You could use this as a game play mechanic (by hiding or giving the user extra information to interact with for example like RoomAlive) or augmenting your living room similar to IllumiRoom. Imagine playing Halo 5: Guardians where you have the headset on and the spartan HUD shows up on your headset or during gameplay missed bullets can fling out your tv almost actually hitting you in the real world. Imagine a grunt throwing a grenade at your feet in the game where it also rolls beside your feet in your living room showing a explosion as well. The applications with this is limitless, the reason why I think Hololens for Xbox One is a possibility because Terry Myerson showed this concept image of a AR headset working simultaneously with the Xbox One at the Windows 10 event. Hololens will be exactly the same in it's current state but Hololens for Xbox One will have the same HPU but a lower end system on a chip (the Xbox One creates the graphics).   http://cdn3.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-21_01_2015-18_13_10-670x377.jpg?eaa32f   3: Hololens and Hololens for Windows 10: Hololens for Windows 10 would be basically a accessory for your Windows 10 devices i.e PC, Windows phone, and Xbox One. At the Windows 10 event Alex Kipman said that Windows Holographic will be coming to all versions of Windows 10 (which would bring AR experiences to all devices), which made me realize that maybe there might a version for all windows 10 devices.    Hopefully possibility number 2 is the plan because Hololens was originally planned as a Xbox One accessory and many of the engineers working on it have a gaming background i.e Kipman and Tsunoda. Maybe Hololens is the only sku, and as far as integration goes it might have a Xbox One smartglass app that provides the experiences I've mentioned. Possibility 2 in my opinion is the most exciting."
HoloLens,2xbgnl,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Fri Feb 27 21:41:57 2015 UTC,"This is still all speculation, but I'd have to disagree. I think Microsoft will offer a single HoloLens model at release and it will be the professional version. They don't want to repeat the Surface Pro / Surface RT confusion. Nadella also told Wired the rollout was going to be slow to gauge consumer reactions, targeting developers, then commercial partners, then everyone else. Again thinking back to the Surface release, they'll want to avoid repeating the embarrassing situation of having overestimated demand.  I think that anything called ""HoloLens"" will refer to a standalone device, but we may see cheaper devices appear as peripherals with similar display tech. I also expect to see holographic tablets from Microsoft, possibly even before we see a HoloLens-like peripheral. The Surface line will almost certainly gain the sensory and tracking capabilities of HoloLens, possibly as soon as the next generation.  The biggest question is how third-party vendors will react. If cheap AR goggles compatible with Windows Holographic become readily available, Microsoft might be pushed to introduce their own consumer-level product sooner. A lot depends on how all of this is received when it comes out."
HoloLens,2xbgnl,abs159,2,Fri Feb 27 23:23:00 2015 UTC,"rollout was going to be slow to gauge consumer reactions   If that's the case, I'll be preordering 10 units the second the preorder hits.  It will take some time for the general market to 'uptake' on this, and when it does, they'll be going for serious $ on ebay.  Sorry, yes, i'm that kinda guy (at least in my fantasy world, instead, i'll not do that and wish I did when it happens that other people were making serious $ doing just that :) )   If cheap AR goggles compatible with Windows Holographic become readily available,   This to me is the most interesting scenario.  MSFT is clearly doing something significantly dissimilar to the rest of the 'me-to' VR headset players -- oculus being the most obvious VR device, Samsung, Sony, HTC, (rumoured) NVidia and others -- are putting together ""screen before your eyes"" devices, with their own software ecosystem and their own devStack (save Samsung/facebook), that are probably going to hit major production numbers in the next 12-24 months.  The question is, with MSFT blazing it's own trail in AR, what will they do to coopt all that coming super-cheap VR?  This is a risk for MSFT in my mind.  The momentum might shift to VR just because of the sheer simplicity of producing the devices -- but can MSFT make a play to coalesce this coming VR market via software alone - without doing their own hardware.  Billing HoloLens as the super-premium, magic improvement beyond regular VR, and building a ecosystem around that may very well work - their could be some symbiosis between AR & VR that helps HoloLens.  But, all that cheap VR headset hardware floating around -- and it primarily being used to run standard PC-games -- MSFT had better be keeping itself straight on that front also."
HoloLens,2xbgnl,abs159,2,Sun Mar 1 22:13:19 2015 UTC,"I think VR still has a software problem. Contrary to popular belief, designing good VR experiences is as dissimilar from conventional game design as designing good AR experiences, perhaps even more so.  I've seen a lot of people claim that VR has an advantage in the gaming space because it is obvious how you could take first-person games and insert players directly into them. That's kind of like saying that Kinect is easy to develop as a game controller because it is obvious how player movements could be mapped directly to characters: in other words, it's completely wrong.  VR games need to be custom designed to work as VR games. The Oculus Rift best practices guide is evidence of that with notices such as ""Rotating or moving the horizon line or other large components of the user’s environment in conflict with the user’s real world self-motion (or lack thereof) can be discomforting."" Above all, VR has to solve the question of how to handle locomotion. SightLine: The Chair is one of the most interesting VR demos out there because it works with VR's natural tendency to favor stationary experiences and having line-of-sight as an important variable in storytelling.  AR of course has its own challenges, but there's a number of reasons why AR may be easier to develop for than VR:   The art burden for AR is much lower than VR. Even the simplest of virtual objects are impressive when they're brought into the real world. People were blown away by Minecraft graphics in AR. Coupled with 3D modeling software that can allow models to be viewed and manipulated in true 3D, the barrier to making cutting-edge game art will never have been lower. On the other hand, for VR to be immersive it needs to create presence by visually transporting players to a new world. To do that successfully requires some really good art in addition to really good tech. If AAA companies seem to focus too many resources on graphics now, it will be even more of a problem in VR where realism is king. With AR, even the cheapest art is photorealistic because the world is photorealistic; however, it can also be highly stylized. I've been yammering on about this for a while, but I really can't stress how incredibly important this is. If VR is naturally aligned with the first-person perspective, AR is aligned with the third-person perspective. There are quite a few toys and games that provide examples for how to adapt this perspective to AR gaming: RC cars and airplanes, tabletop gaming with miniatures, Lego and construction sets, dolls and figurines, essentially every physical toy ever made could inform the design of virtual objects with AR. ""Pure VR"" games could be directly ported to AR. The experience may be less immersive but AR will still be more immersive than a monitor-based game and still less likely to induce sickness than VR due to having boundaries to the illusion (I'd question whether the assumption of AR being less immersive is even accurate, but that is bound to be subjective and there's not much to discuss until there is a VR/AR port to test). ""True AR"" that mixes virtual objects and characters with the real world offers unique possibilities, but it's not actually necessary to map the real environment to create AR games. I imagine many AR games will simply project a floating island in front of players. That floating game space could also easily ""scroll"" by moving the island and having land appear on one side and disappear on the other such that the island stays confined to the same area. I made that sound more complicated than it actually is [edit: just imagine playing Bastion with its world that is created around The Kid]: point is, you can create windows into 3D worlds with sensible control schemes without needing to know anything about the real world.   All of this is tangential to your point, which was that super-cheap VR may pose a threat to AR simply due to economics. I agree that VR technology is looking increasingly promising and it's going to be possible to get gear much cheaper than HoloLens. The reason I brought up all of the above is that AR needs to win on software. VR is crazy impressive, but right now it's still struggling to be useful. AR has no problem being useful both for gaming and for lots of other stuff besides.  SteamVR may be one of the biggest legitimate threats to HoloLens if it means that Valve is going to release exclusive VR content. For example, Half-Life 3 as a SteamVR exclusive would be a massive system seller. HoloLens wouldn't be killed by that, as it's still a remarkable general purpose computing platform, but without being driven by gaming it could take a while to reach mass adoption which would mean more competition from second-mover AR companies such as Magic Leap."
HoloLens,2xbgnl,ilovegoogleglass,2,Mon Mar 2 07:04:03 2015 UTC,"Your comments are quite realistic, but hopefully there's at least an  affordable consumer offering tho alongside Hololens , maybe through a Xbox peripheral. Maybe a Xbox AR headset built on the Hololens technology, but not with the Hololens name. That's yet to be seen.  Holographic surface tablets sure is an interesting thought, using glasses free 3D tech along side Kinect technology would be amazing."

On this point, for a while I thought Microsoft might give all Build attendees a devkit. They've historically given around $1000 in hardware to conference attendees and they've been really pushing Build as the Place To Be for HoloLens info. The @HoloLens twitter account used to almost exclusively post ""we'll have more info at Build"" or variants.  The main reason I'm hesitant to predict that they'll be giving out HoloLenses is that they don't give out products at Build before they're released and it's clear that it won't be released before Build. However, there's a chance that they'll release the devkit to coincide with Build. After all, it doesn't make much sense to tell everyone about the SDK without providing a platform for development and it likewise doesn't make much sense to provide the devkits before releasing any details about how to develop for them.  If this line of speculation is at all accurate, I'd expect to see development kits costing a little over $1000 becoming available during Build. Unless the dev kit is crippled in some way or considerably more expensive than I'm expecting, it's an easy purchase for me. I want in on developing for this, even if no one else ever adopts the tech."

I'd expect to see development kits costing a little over $1000 becoming available during Build.   I'm thinking it will hit for $1500-$2000.  $1000 is just too little for all the hardware.  Unless of course the dev-kit has compromises not envisioned yet (the first would be like Oculus, requiring an external power source as opposed to built in power.)"

I'm convinced that HoloLens is literally holographic, partly because Kipman directly said in the HoloLens reveal that it has ""holographic lenses"" and partly because the descriptions from hands-on reviews really make it sound like the device is showing a light field. The vague descriptions given about the HoloLens display technology also often invoke the same sort of ""sending light directly to the eye"" and ""working directly with human biology"" language that Magic Leap uses. I'm not sure why everyone is so convinced that holography is a marketing buzzword when everything we've heard about the device implies that it is indeed holographic."
HoloLens,2x8kx7,ImplementOfWar2,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:32:42 2015 UTC,"A light bouncing from a lens into your eye is not any different then light being directly shined into your eye.  Your eye will still be focused in a direction and distance  The eye itself is a lens after all.  Magic Leap's secret approach might be different then Hololens only if it manages to direct light into the eye from larger FOV's then Hololens and adapt to what direction your eye is facing to instantly adjust the light to match.   Which is very hard to do technically.  Larger FOV's would mean they would need more then one ""projector"" into the eye so when you turn your eye there is another projector ready to instantly resume the image,  and more projectors to just generally be reflecting light from more angles to further try to trick the eye.  Each of those projectors though would have to be processing a different image transform.  And each one would need enough processing power  to seamlessly keep rendering the image in it's new transform if you ever moved your eye or head.  That is super hard even if all you are doing is standing still and not moving your eyes at all.  I await to see what Magic Leap reveals though.  I just think they are more about ""hype"" at this point."
HoloLens,2x8kx7,Ericth,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:31:48 2015 UTC,"Actually, was the magic leap not supposed to have light field tech?

Not by the fact that he's saying his own product is better, that's to be expected of course, but the ""permanent neurologic deficits"" comment is frankly irresponsible and their apparent unwillingness to cooperate at the software level is also disappointing (although a Magic Leap running Windows Holographic was always a long shot given their Google owners).  I'm not convinced Abovitz knows a whole lot more about the HoloLens display than we do, which is a little odd given his position. It still seems to be very much an open question what technology drives the HoloLens and what the implications are for optical effects. The HoloLens gives stereo depth cues, it gives motion parallax cues, but does it give optical focus cues?  I find it hard to believe that none of the hands-on reviewers would comment on focus if the HoloLens didn't give focus cues. There is reason to believe that HoloLens is a light-field display of some sort which would make Abovitz's comments moot.  It's good to know that Magic Leap is a light-field display.

HoloLens,2wwlp5,BI_Joe,1 point,Mon Feb 23 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"I actually spent quite a while trying to work out the FOV from a set of pictures like this a while ago. I even made a post on this subreddit about it, then deleted it eventually because I wasn't satisfied that my analysis was correct. I tried reconstructing the scene in Blender using billboards of a couple key images (the TVs and walls), but gave up because I frankly suck at using Blender (if only there were a more convenient way to view 3D things).   Would it be possible to calculate the width & height of the wood wall then to calculate how much of the Hololens UI covers it to find the FOV? MS hololens's depth camera is 120 by 120 degrees.   The extent of the UI is irrelevant, as is the FOV of the depth camera. The UI doesn't cover the FOV (if it did, it would be getting clipped as she moved her head around). You also wouldn't be able to estimate FOV from the UI, since there's no way to know how far away it appears. More to the point, when we're shown views from the perspective of the HoloLens, I'd assume the entire image is what's within the FOV. The depth camera isn't a color camera and isn't what's being shown."
HoloLens,2wrq50,ilovegoogleglass,3,Sun Feb 22 16:25:22 2015 UTC,"I just think hololens could be great because you could watch netflix handsfree and poop at the same time.  No longer need to pause a show because nature calls.  /joke  Actually surfing the web and playing games hands free will also be possible while you poop. Also in hospitals, instead of having a patient stare at a tv all day, they could let them use their hands to manipulate virtual objects and other things.  Imagine not having to watch a rerun because the doctor has you wearing hololense and playing with a virtual rubix cube or minecraft."

That said, it seems like it's a 3 horse race between Google (magic leap), Facebook (Oculus), and Microsoft.   I've tried the DK1 Rift on a number of occasions and my experience with that has been OK, but nauseating. More excited about AR."
HoloLens,2wrq50,squeakeel,3,Mon Feb 23 04:29:56 2015 UTC,"I think in the first generations of these devices, AR tech isn't directly competing with VR tech. In future generations, they will probably be combined into a single device, but for now they're separated. I can see people buying both HoloLens and Oculus, for example, because they serve different purposes for now."
HoloLens,2wrq50,Ansalem1,2,Mon Feb 23 08:08:58 2015 UTC,"I would say Oculus is in more of it's own game with it be just VR. Unless Facebook does something to change this.

HoloLens,2wq63r,stesch,7,Sun Feb 22 09:33:05 2015 UTC,ToF - time of flight. Essentially a camera that also gathers information on how much time light needs to reach the sensor which in the end makes it possible to create depth map that allows you to know how close and how far are objects in the scene.  Kinect 2 camera is ToF camera. Here is how visualized version of the data looks like: http://www.brekel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kinect2_depth.jpg

As long as your finger is not really close to the surface ""the screen"" is displayed on, it will stand out in camera data and be easy to act on.  You can see in the post photo that wood pattern is not visible behind tiles while finger is opaque in front of tiles. They definitely do not treat both as the same object and with this plain background there is no chance they couldn't outline finger 100% accurately.  Not to mention that finger is not pointer device in HoloLens. Finger is ""click"" action so hiding things from view would be stupid - it's like holding gamepad in front of your screen while playing games and obstructing yourself a view."

This might be resolvable by use of the depth tracker to identify the headset's position in space relative to the background, but what if you move objects around?  Also, most apps are going to have to follow you around for obvious reasons. They're all contained in the headset after all: why would I want to move my physical body to access them? There's also the question of how I'm going to tell the device I've moved from one context to another: is it going to recognize the room I'm in? Is it going to dead-reckon its way from home to work and back?"
HoloLens,2wm10y,MrUnimport,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:15:47 2015 UTC,"I think that, in the demos we've seen, there were clearly places where something resided that the human walked to.

HoloLens,2wid34,rodcliftonOH,3,Sat Feb 21 06:41:50 2015 UTC,"I think there's room for both.  MS has clearly devoted their resources to AR versus VR.  VR is clearly plant body, and experience environment through eyes and in your mind.    Remember, the Holodeck (Star Trek) was AR.  MS patented that particular concept a while back. Holodeck MS Patent Link  So, I guess it will come down to you wanting to walk around physically, or mentally."
HoloLens,2wid34,PoopNoodleSoup,-1,Sat Feb 21 12:47:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the most impressive AR demos these days are ones in which your physical environment is recreated in the virtual world. This seems to be the new direction of AR. I think Microsoft is going down a dead end road with HoloLens. The future of AR is reconstructive AR."
HoloLens,2wid34,rodcliftonOH,2,Sat Feb 21 16:39:44 2015 UTC,"Everything that O Rift can do, for example, Hololens can do too.  It's just method.  Essentially, this whole AR vs. VR, or AR done one way vs another...the idea is just how much you see of this world, and how much you don't see.    Just think about the Holodeck example from Star Trek.  That's AR, not VR. But, the concept could be done either way.    When we break it all the way down, it's which company is going to trick our eyes, the best, into thinking that what we see is really there.  That's all."
HoloLens,2wid34,PoopNoodleSoup,0,Sat Feb 21 21:44:25 2015 UTC,"It can do everything the Rift can do, but not as good and for more money. What's the point?  And if your criteria is immersion, the Rift is ridiculously far ahead of HoloLens."
HoloLens,2wid34,rodcliftonOH,3,Sun Feb 22 02:11:11 2015 UTC,"We do not know how much this costs.  In addition, we do not know all that it can do, it hasn't been released.    Rift is not far ahead of Hololens because there would have to be something established for Hololens to say that.  There isn't since it's not released.  As I said earlier, it's just method.  They're both tricking the eyes, and mind, just doing it in slightly different ways, and this is really important...  We can like both of them at the same time!"
HoloLens,2wid34,BI_Joe,2,Sun Feb 22 02:15:26 2015 UTC,"15-hour old account with only posts on /r/hololens and the creator and sole subsriber to the anti-hololens /r/idiotheaddress subreddit... someone really dislikes HoloLens.  To each their own, but I think it is a little ridiculous to say that VR is inherently better than AR. The only real advantage it has is more complete immersion and the cost of that is:   reduced freedom of motion often reduced quality of head tracking (since head tracking is critical for AR but sometimes only partially implemented in devices like the DK1 or Gear VR) no awareness of physical surroundings increased chance of simulator sickness (I have yet to read any reports of sickness with HoloLens) no hand and gesture tracking no modeling of the physical environment surrounding the user, and thus no way to implement true mixed-reality applications in real time"
HoloLens,2wid34,PoopNoodleSoup,-2,Sat Feb 21 21:31:29 2015 UTC,"How is GearVR reduced freedom of motion? And how much do people really want to move around their house while doing computing work anyway? Uh, what? How would the HoloLens be better than the Rift which has positional tracking with an external camera? False. There's a increasing number of AR demos for the Rift that map the surrounding environment into 3D. There's not enough data to make this claim. Especially considering the DK2 has very few reports of motion sickness. There are tons of VR apps that have hand and gesture tracking. False, for the same reason the previous item was false. This is becoming quite common.   And still, I have yet to hear one single consumer scenario that HoloLens can do that isn't better on another device."
HoloLens,2wid34,holonames,3,Sat Feb 21 23:59:38 2015 UTC,"There's a increasing number of AR demos for the Rift that map the surrounding environment into 3D.   Well, try to drink a hot coffee or light a cigarette while using a VR headset vs something like HoloLens."
HoloLens,2wid34,BI_Joe,3,Sun Feb 22 12:33:24 2015 UTC,"Well, try to drink a hot coffee or light a cigarette while using a VR headset vs something like HoloLens.   Or repair a light switch or plumbing...  This whole thing is ridiculous. You can make VR devices act more like AR devices, but the AR experience is going to be lacking. If it's not, then your VR device is an AR device. All of the existing VR devices are inferior to HoloLens in significant ways when it comes to AR.  Tracking is just not that good with existing VR devices. 3-DOF head tracking systems like Gear VR are completely laughable for AR and even with the much praised (external) DK2 head tracker, I've yet to see any AR demos comparable to the HoloLens previews. Maybe /u/PoopNoodleSoup knows something I don't, but most Oculus demos I've seen look like this or this. Note the required markers, the floating-in-space 3D objects (making errors more difficult to notice), and the noticeably poor consistency between the positions of markers and objects.  Hypothetically, if an untethered, self-contained version of the Rift had perfect tracking, or even HoloLens-level tracking, would it be better than the HoloLens? The question at that point is just about display tech and even then pass-through video is clearly inferior to just looking through glass for seeing real-world objects. VR should be able to render virtual objects more vibrantly than HoloLens, but it's still looking at the world through two flat screens."
HoloLens,2wid34,rodcliftonOH,2,Mon Feb 23 05:55:08 2015 UTC,"One thing I think we can all agree on (and I think I may have said it already) is that competition between the two, for our head, is exciting.    I have, for years, just not really ever understood fanboyism.  And, I'm not calling anyone out in this thread for it (other than PooNooSoup who would likely gladly admit to be anti-HL), but what does fanboyism really serve?    I really thing that the HL is going to be awesome...but really, if Oculous Rift turns some corner, or has some absolutely ridiculous upgrade that blows away everything on the market, do you think I'd really shy away from it?    I say we all welcome the competition between all the various companies, because one of them will emerge with something we're all going to mostly like."
HoloLens,2wid34,BI_Joe,2,Mon Feb 23 13:23:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'd love for Magic Leap, castAR, the Rift, or some yet-unknown product to surpass the HoloLens.  My main bias is that simulation sickness is a big deal for me, since the camera movements in most 3D games quickly make sick even on 2D screens. This is purely a gaming thing; I don't have any issues with 3D movies. AR is extremely appealing to me because it can get rid of the need for most, if not all, scripted/gamepad-controlled camera movements (replacing them with the ability to physically look around). The latest VR technology is looking promising on reducing sickness as well, but that's relative to the earlier generation of VR that made literally everyone sick. Even with head tracking, VR is naturally geared towards applications where most movement is controlled with a gamepad, which is a recipe for nausea in my experience. If that stops being the case, I'll happily jump on the VR bandwagon.  There are other reasons why I think AR is more likely to be commercially successful in the short term than VR, but that's the main reason why I want AR to attract more attention."

You're not meant to wear HoloLens all the time like a pair of glasses.  It seems Google Glass was marketed to be a replacement for your everyday eye wear.  Glass is also an under development product, he's reviewing it  like it's meant to be a final version..."
HoloLens,2wcfhj,regular-wolf,0,Thu Feb 19 01:09:45 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand when you're supposed to wear HoloLens. Clearly, when no one's around, but then if no one's around, you're better off just using a VR headset like the Rift, Gear VR, or Morpheus. I mean, it's cool and all in a geeky sort of way, but I can't think of a single scenario that wouldn't be better on another device.

If we're going to accept that projecting data onto the world provides value at all, it's almost a necessity to be able to share that projection with other people. Right now I can read something off the same monitor or smartphone as someone else. I can look at a physical image printed on physical paper at the same time as someone else. Why would I not want to be able to share the object or display I'm viewing with another sufficiently-equipped viewer? Why not make this a consensual hallucination, if you'll excuse the allusion? The whole appeal of AR is to merge the virtual with the physical, and allow us to interact with it in intuitive ways. There's nothing more intuitive than looking at a visualization at the same time as someone else.   Sharing an AR environment was also already demoed during the conference with the Mars simulation, if you don't recall."

HoloLens,2wcfhj,PoopNoodleSoup,1 point,Sun Feb 22 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"The Surface Hub is interesting as a smart whiteboard but I get the feeling it will lack the tactility of the real thing. There's also issues with having to stand in front of it in order to draw on it, blocking everyone's view, and the limited size of it compared to a real whiteboard which can occupy a wall. The Hololens is also going to face adoption barriers like price and interoperability, but if they can make it work as an interface to existing products, I can see the potential being used. The whiteboard is actually a pretty good example: it's a communal persistent 2D space used to illustrate concepts. Augmented/virtual reality technology permits the extension of this concept into 3D space. Obviously you don't need expensive goggles to look at a whiteboard, but I think you're letting your skepticism of the platform itself obscure the potential applications of the format.  Edit: Certainly the Mars demo would work better on the Rift, I just mentioned it to demonstrate communal visualization is a selling point of the device, not an edge case."

I'm glad we have competition to push the technology forward, but Microsoft is channeling in the right direction. I feel Sony won't see a high adoption rate if they market for people wearing these outside of their house/office. Society just isn't there yet. Google Glass, although a failed execution, is closer to what I feel people are going to want to see in AR. Small devices, that are discrete.  Microsoft's execution with a AR device that is meant to stay at the home or office is exactly where I think it should go until we can get them more compact."

HoloLens,2w3pis,fredman555,8,Mon Feb 16 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"With current technology, streaming to the lens would result in a noticeable delay and would make it unlikely that ""holograms"" would stay in place and respond to input quickly enough."
HoloLens,2w3pis,Gatz6,5,Mon Feb 16 19:44:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the volume of data from the sensors alone might be to intense for Bluetooth.  We also don't completely understand how the display technology works so the volume of data there could be much higher then a typical HDMI data stream.  Also the video cannot suffer from much latency to get the holograms right, wireless streaming would add to this.    I'm sure Microsoft's team considered all possible technology solutions for this release of HoloLens.  This is probably the best solution with the technology that is available.  Eventually we should see lighter and perhaps separated wireless components as the technology improves."
HoloLens,2w3pis,Summons,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:24:20 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I consider Microsoft's approach the best in terms of what is technologically feasible today.   We just aren't ready to have these devices be anything more than supplemental to our home and office life, and we're quite a few years off seeing these smaller, and more portable. I'm already excited to see what the next iteration of AR devices are going to look like beyond HoloLens."

HoloLens,2w3pis,BI_Joe,2,Mon Feb 16 23:12:05 2015 UTC,"OP, I think you make a good observation about Glass, however, I think that Hololens is not being marketed, and thus, not intended for use in the same way that Glass is.    If I were to use one of those this is to this questions to form an analogy, it would be like this:  Glass is to a Smartphone as Hololens is to a desktop PC.    What I mean is that Glass was marketed, and intended to be used like we currently use our phones.  We bring them everywhere, and Glass would have been brought everywhere (or worn everywhere).  Our smartphone is mostly used for surfing the web occasionally, directions, text communications, etc.  Same with Glass.  You're not going to set your smartphone down, and (in general), make an Excel spreadsheet.    Hololens is more like a desktop PC.  It's not meant to be everywhere with you.  It's meant to stay at home, and handle the big things (and I'm assuming that means gaming too, but that's a side point).  Produce details reports, interact with others perhaps in a meeting style environment, and of course, Hololens will open up a host of other things that will help with productivity.    Hopefully I'm making sense!"
HoloLens,2w3pis,rodcliftonOH,2,Tue Feb 17 14:28:16 2015 UTC,"good points, and youre right! I get too excited sometimes and jump the gun.  Maybe in a few generations they will be small and light enough to be worn everywhere."
HoloLens,2w3pis,Dunkh,1 point,Wed Feb 18 14:52:47 2015 UTC,"I have a question.  Microsoft owns the BattleTech Mechwarrior franchise, right?  With Hololens they could create a game that uses your room with existing objects into a map.  Scale it as close in to a single unit or as far out to command several units.  Using gestures for telemetry, selection, aiming and firing weapons?    Good ideas?"
HoloLens,2w3pis,SimpleWireFree,1 point,Mon May 4 03:05:52 2015 UTC,"This should be way lighter and smaller than both Occulus and Morpheus.  I really don't see a problem with it.  I have glasses on all day because it helps me to see better, but this is a game changer.  The problem with 3D glasses is many...   With 3D glasses you have to buy a new TV and a new bluray player You can't interact with the 3D, it just allows you to view it People get headaches from the 3D (people haven't had that problem with HoloLens) 3D is only limited to your TV and that is all 3D TV is just a fad.  It doesn't improve anything, but just lets you view content from one angle and that is it.  There isn't a very useful purpose for it.   All of these things are not a problem with HoloLens.  With HoloLens you can interact with it using your voice, gestures, finger pointing, eye control, and probably even an xbox one controller.   Go look at the level of control that they did real-time on stage with the Holo Studio, that was a good look into what you can do.  Microsoft made this thing to be light so that you can work on something for hours.  Glass was dead on arrival because it lacked applications for it.   It wasn't really all that useful.  It was just all 2-D planes, recording videos and that is about it.  Google Glass died because it was useless.  This is far from useless and it's more important than Google Glass."
HoloLens,2w3pis,vrisevl,1 point,Tue Feb 17 01:49:19 2015 UTC,"Glass failed for a number of reasons. but its odd shape steered away an arguably important group.  Im with you, in thatHololens blows glass out of the water in terms of practicality and technical prowess, but for it to get seriously big in the world of wearables it needs to have the ""sex"" factor. So far devices either have one or the other, Hololens is closest to bridging that gap"

HoloLens,2vsme7,KramDevil,3,Wed Feb 18 05:54:01 2015 UTC,"I own a company that is looking into future app ideas for the hololens. Since it doesn't exist yet, it's just a joke for the time being, but here's some ideas on our map:  People   Cataloging of people I pay attention to for more than 1 second (or even absolutely    everyone), Clothes and colors, current hair style, facial piercings, current makeup   configuration   Logging of all conversation text, both in person and cellular. Basically next time I get    into a ""But I never said that"" argument, now I have backup.   Timeline logging of when I see these people, so I can see a monthly or yearly view with all    the times i last saw/interacted with this person.  World   Optional distance tickertape along the ground. So I can see how far i've walked, and see a    ruler going along the ground in 3D correctly following if it's a hill, etc.   Statistics for world stuffs: Vehicle Identifier: Identify vital stats about vehicles around you. (Make, model, color,) Tree Identifier: Tree info and stats from lookng at it Animal Ident   Object Stuff   House/World/Building See Through: Pending the outside views have been mapped (etc etc) Want    to beable to look through walls or multiple walls, or hills, or trees, etc.  Security System Integration   Views from security cameras 3d-integrated and parsed into hololens world or some kind of    hololens-enabled security cameras.    If I own 100 houses, I want to see the security of all 100 combined into a single interface    or something.  Holocam   Let me more or less map the room im in, so then I can recreate that room anywhere I am.  AKA virtual tours of the pyramids, etc.   Translation Holograms   Make a 'style and method' for a particular area, and then apply this to whatever area you    are in. For example, have a 'holoimage' for a town in skyrim, and then transform your house to   look like the inside of a house from skyrim, and the outside of your house to micmic the   village using real houses but transformed, etc. (this is probly not gonna happen for a few   years)   Virtual Redecoration: Redecorate your house. Screen wrapping: Wrap tv screens around objects or have bizzare shapes, etc. Holokeyboards, etc.   Full World   Design a ironman suit that interacts with your body via hololens. Then give a API so I could    enable other hololens users to temporarily interact with it. IE place in real world, then all   people within 50 feet can see it for 5 minutes, then it disappears. Etc.    Localized Headset integration: Through a baseball, other hololens nearby can see, catch and throw baseball along.   Exhibit Virtualization:   Harry Potter Exihibit: Magic wands can now 'work', complete with colorful magic visible on wands. Spells would    world on real-world physical props in exhibits in combo with holos in hololenses. - Virtual programmed characters to help/guide: A virtual dumbledore to follow around that only   you could see, so everyone doesn't see 5000 dumbledores all walking around, etc. - Fire breathing dragons in the sky at night, flying around interacting at random and blowing   fire and magic at people   Museums: Virtual curators and demonstrations of exhibits Casinos: colorful eye murder   Privacy Mode   Ability to join another person's house via hololens, but only see a small limited area, like    a table, or to have identity masking, etc.  Physical   Microexpression Analytics: Identify facial info, etc.   Hololens addons:   Thermal/Infrared vision Integrated FM/AM Tempearture, Humidity, Barometric, UV sensors Detachable computing module - For upgrades, etc. and also for financials, cheaper to replace    the rest of the headset when it breaks, etc.   LCD blackout grid: Put a layer of full transparent LCD grid behind lenses, this allows to    black out portions for screens in bright daylight or blacken the entire view by certain   amounts like controllable sunglasses, but mainly to make watching video in bright conditions   more tolerable.   Not-In-Use protector that goes over projection target lenses, cause cleaning those will be a    bitch and tiny amounts of debris will be more noticable  TOTAL smartphone obliteration: - I don't want a hololens that half requires a smartphone along side it. I want to handle all   phone calls/texts from within the hololens.  Yeah that's a mess. Just pasted it straight. Welcome any comments."

HoloLens,2vsme7,Genesis_Prime,2,Fri Feb 13 20:58:59 2015 UTC,"Start getting familiar with augmented reality, there's tons of SDKs out there to mess around with for mobile and PC. Create a few demos using them. :)"

Unity is massively backed by Microsoft, so, Unity would be my safest bet. But Unreal is also very popular on Windows, so, these two will support HoloLens as the first frameworks, in my opinion.  I think that if you choose i.e. Unity/unreal Engine/etc. for your hologames, you don't need to master DirectX, unless you want to. These engines are made for 3D stuff.   Regarding apps, hmm... I guess they will add some emulation to Visual Studio, so you can test it without HoloLens, but, who knows."

In my opinion HoloLens is the biggest breakthrough in consumer electronics in the 21st century so far.

First film takes a part of the theatre business, now people will get used to seeing what they want, where they want it, without limitations.   Sure there will always be people who will prefer human theatre, but the general public is what matters, since a show and theatre has to be financially feasible.   This is just a suggestion though, well really have to see what happens! Interesting topic :)"
HoloLens,2vbkd0,BI_Joe,2,Tue Feb 10 16:23:15 2015 UTC,"...or it could bring theater to everybody and not only to people who live in Vienna ;). In 10 years the Holo sets and realtime 3D mapping technology of a real performers in Vienna theater (and other small & large theaters) will be far more advanced and you will have a theater performance on your table, floor or in your garden. I think that scaling of the scene will be like cahnging the size of the window of the program on your desktop. Maybe not in 10 years, but it will happen sooner or later. The same will apply to sports and other areas of ""real"" entertainment. Imagine the 3D ads during breaks ;D"
HoloLens,2vbkd0,BI_Joe,1 point,Tue Feb 10 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"It won't be the death of theatre any more than 3D TVs -- or regular TVs and movie theaters for that matter. The appeal of theatre is not that it's 3D; it's the intimacy of seeing a performance live and in an ephemeral, non-recorded form. It's already a pretty niche market (with the possible exception of musicals).  Live-streamed mo-cap animation could be a very cool extension of theatre, but it seems like it would need some sort of audience interaction to distinguish itself from prerecorded (normal) 3D films. I expect 3D films will themselves change to be more immersive and potentially ""play-like"" by placing viewers in scenes instead of relying on camera framing and frequent cuts, but I don't see that as a reason why someone would stop going to see plays if they're currently interested in them despite the availability of Netflix."
HoloLens,2vcovi,arbaminim,3,Mon Feb 9 22:51:16 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, IMO. Skeumorphism is all about taking design cues from the physical world, and Holograms are all about being a part of the physical world. It only makes sense they would be designed to blend in. I don't see flat design going away anytime soon, since it is so popular and, IMO, is perfectly suited for handsets/mobile devices. I'm thinking most design choices will continue as they are on their respective platforms, but skeumorphic will be the way to go for hololens. I don't see skeumorphism ""coming back"" to smartphones, but the design style will come back in the sense that it is being used elsewhere."
HoloLens,2vcovi,corbygray528,2,Tue Feb 10 19:45:18 2015 UTC,"Its possible, it only makes sense. Why interact with a interface that's meant to give you a life like experience when it looks fake itself.   Just my 2 cents..."
HoloLens,2vcovi,ilovegoogleglass,2,Mon Feb 9 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"I think it will be like any other application of skeumorphic design -- useful at first, but limiting in the long run.     The real power of augmented reality will be to bend & enhance reality, and, in doing that, you really need to go beyond what the real world offers.    Mirroring reality will definitely help people adjust, but it won't fully actualize the medium."
HoloLens,2vcovi,Tojuro,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:06:31 2015 UTC,This is what I hated about their software demo. It looked like it was designed for Vista with the fake glass. They shouldn't be afraid to give us something authentically digital that exists in a real world. That's next level.
HoloLens,2vcovi,ralexand56,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:10:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah. If AR interface is meant to take off in a real way and not just exist for novelty's sake, it's going to have to carve out its own interface paradigms and not rely on cute animations. People will have to get used to it as they get used to any technology but the benefits to ergonomics will be worth it.  An equilibrium between the intuitive and the flexible will, as with every other device, be reached, and I suspect that we'll start with the former and progress towards the latter once people familiarize themselves with the device."

Now I see them as testing grounds not for the hardware used, but the software issues that the HoloLens would of needed to resolved years before its release.    Microsoft has been showing us for years what HoloLens will do, without showing the product HoloLens itself.

Still, long term -- the sky is the limit.   The specs will only improve with time and competition will only serve to accelerate the race."
HoloLens,2v6tx4,Tojuro,4,Mon Feb 9 01:20:27 2015 UTC,"This seems likely.  Certainly it was part of the intent for pretty much as long the product has been in development; the 2010 ""Road to Fortaleza"" leak mentioned ""Xbox experiences on any screen.""  HoloLens is a Windows 10 device, so the basics of streaming to it should be there at the same time; you'd just need an app running on it to define the screen."
HoloLens,2v6tx4,Larry_Mudd,4,Sun Feb 8 15:09:34 2015 UTC,"I think its premature to say this is likely.  We have no idea what the resolution of the HoloLens will be. Even if its 1080P, if its mimicking the display on a wall it will have to scale it down to match view.  No to mention the Holograms seem semi transparent, so it may not be a great experience focusing on that for long periods of time.  We also have no idea what the Xbox One and HoloLens integration will be.  The made no official comments on what it will do with Xbox One. We don't know if it can stream the video at a very low latency wirelessly compared to your high speed wired TV.  I suspect it will not be the same, but side content it wouldn't be as important to be high res and low latency.  If any integration, I suspect it may be only limited to Illumniroom like capability, maybe something like this as someone made a mockup off."

It may be premature to say it's certain, but I think we can be confident that it's likely.  While it's true that we don't yet have any hard specs for this device, it's not entirely true that we don't have any idea of the resolution.  Microsoft has described the display as ""high definition"" in its communications about the product, and their presentation showed a representation of someone watching Netflix on a virtual screen across the room, so they are confident that this will be an appropriate use.  The display tech used appears to be a form of near-eye holographic laser projection, so the resolution will be much better than what we're used looking at with LCD HMDs."
HoloLens,2v6tx4,Larry_Mudd,2,Sun Feb 8 17:57:33 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering about this for a while as well.  My guess is that the HoloLens could likely project a high-resolution screen floating at a fixed location relative to the user's head. However, to do what's seen in the trailer where an arbitrarily sized screen is placed on a wall, the HoloLens would need to simulate the screen in only a portion of its display space. If you're looking at your HoloLens TV but it only occupies a quarter of your field of view, the HoloLens would need to have a resolution 4 times greater than a physical TV in that spot.  On the other hand, head-mounted displays only need to show detail that you'd actually be able to perceive. They might be able to take advantage of that by focusing on delivering detail to central vision and having lower-res peripheral imagery. Theoretically, if the angular resolution was smaller than the human eye could resolve you could perfectly emulate any screen in the FOV (Wikipedia suggests that the required angular resolution for this would be somewhere around 20 to 60 arcseconds). It's very unlikely that the HoloLens will have a resolution quite that high, but you should still be able to make some impressive virtual screens."
HoloLens,2v6tx4,BI_Joe,1 point,Tue Feb 10 03:58:44 2015 UTC,"At this point we should be trying to figure out what HoloLens won't do vs what it could possibly do.  For instance, will you likely be able to stream from the X1 and put it on a virtual screen you can look at? Absolutley. Why wouldn't you be able to?  Will you be able to connect the X1 and get it to natively display on the HoloLens? Probably not.  Sure that window won't be 1080p but will it be good enough to play somewhere where there is no TV? Probably."
HoloLens,2v6tx4,bearxor,1 point,Sun Feb 8 21:04:17 2015 UTC,Depends if the FOV is good.
HoloLens,2v6tx4,ilovegoogleglass,0,Sun Feb 8 17:32:10 2015 UTC,I heard the resolution is not HD.

HoloLens,2v6tx4,Larry_Mudd,2,Mon Feb 9 03:34:42 2015 UTC,HD is 720p'ish.
HoloLens,2v6tx4,Incorr,2,Mon Feb 9 18:02:13 2015 UTC,"Ayup. Resolution for this sort of display is a bit nebulous - it's not like we're going to be looking at a simple LCD panel - but overall ""resolution"" is certain to be >720p.  HoloLens looks to rely on Holographic Laser Projection for its display technology.  I don't think HLP will even work at resolutions below WXGA - you need very small pixels to create the diffraction patterns.  For the last two years the most attractive supplier of LCOS chips for holographic projection has been JDC, and they're not even offering anything below 1920x1080.  This gets a bit complicated, because with holographic projection, the pixels on the LCOS aren't what's shown on the display.  The LCOS shows a diffraction pattern that generates the holographic projection of the input image.  (Without getting into  whether or not they go with field-sequential-colour for the increase in perceived resolution, etc.)  Ideally (in terms of display quality) they'd drop one of the 4096 x 2400 chips in there.  This is the chip that JDC has been shopping around for HMD/Hologrophy applications, and it's ideal because it's pixel pitch is just 3.74um, super fine for accurate diffraction patterns.  If this (or something in the same ballpark) is what they go with, then yeah, full HD virtual screens are a go."
HoloLens,2v6tx4,Larry_Mudd,0,Mon Feb 9 22:41:58 2015 UTC,The dev kits are probably not HD but final kits will be.
HoloLens,2v6pgb,stesch,9,Sun Feb 8 12:01:41 2015 UTC,"Unlikely.  While I suspect it will not be released on the same day as Windows 10, they implied this product will be released soon.    The Windows 10 OS appears to have a fully featured Holographic API SDK as seen in the PasteBin list.  I'm hoping the software is mostly ironed out, which would give us a good sense this is almost ready.  They said they will get physical devices into the hands of developers by Spring 2015, real soon.  Most people suspect this means they will be giving the BUILD Conference attendee's a device, this is usually around 6000 or more people.  If becomes true that means they are really close to a final product.  They are not going to give a preproduction device to developers when the hardware and software API's are not in a good state.  They want developers to start making content for the device, not test or Quality Assurance it.  This is all speculation of course, but it doesn't have the signs of most vaporware we have seen over the years.  Microsoft needs a really awesome consumer win, I don't think they are going to screw this up."

Considering that the Windows 8 to 8.1 revision was about 1 year, I'm concluding that we'll see Hololens in October 2016.   My bet is that the schedule looks like: - April 15: Full reveal of APIs & Visual Studio 2016 at Build Conference. Tethered alpha units made available to hand-picked developers.  - Late June/July 15: Windows 10 desktop RTM.  - Sept 15: Windows 10 General Release.  - Sept/Oct 15: Windows 10 Universal apps running on XBox One.  - Oct 15: Tethered beta units (think Oculus DK1 dev kits) made available to registered developers.  - Mar 16: Revised tethered hardware made available to developers. - May 16: Actual ship date announced.

Certainly a lot of this will likely be applicable to Hololens, but none of the display technology (ie; how the image is delivered to the eye) is relevant to a heads-up HMD.  How do you place a compellingly solid and opaque AR element into a real scene viewed with an HMD without using crudities like video passthrough?  A screen that shows you high resolution rendered elements mixed seamlessly with photons that are reaching your eye directly from the real world?  A traditional LED or LCOS picoprojector on a translucent surface wouldn't work this trick; the resolution isn't there and it's still going to be a ghostly image.  So how?  Some form of holographic laser projection as display tech would explain a lot of the mystery about how the headset does what it reportedly does, and it fits with a lot of the language used by MS to describe their technology, in so far as they have described it.  They have said that the HMD features a third processor in addition to the GPU and CPU - a ""holographic processing unit.""  So what would that be, exactly?  When you read about the nuts and bolts of holographic projection, you see that it depends on custom silicon for the signal processing that generates the ""holograms"" from a more traditional raster input.  (ie; the interference patterns that reconstruct the desired image from the input signal when piped through the light engine.)   In the Photonics and Sensors Group at the Cambridge University Engineering Department, several major breakthroughs have been made, together making possible the generation and display of high quality holograms at video frame rates, using just a single custom chip.  A hologram pattern, which to the naked eye looks like a collection of random dots, is displayed on a small liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCOS) microdisplay - a tiny, very fast liquid crystal display built on top of a chip.  The hologram patterns are calculated by Light Blue Optics' proprietary ""hologram chip"" so that when the microdisplay is illuminated by laser light, the light interferes with itself in a complex manner through the physical process of diffraction which, when carefully controlled, results in the formation of a large, high quality projected image on, for example, a screen or a wall.  Unlike a conventional video projector, heavy, bulky lenses are not required: diffraction does all the work for you, and the projected image is sharp and in focus at any distance.There are a huge number of applications for this technology in fields including business, home entertainment, aerospace and advertising.   This would explain the perceived opacity of the rendered elements, how they manage to present unexpectedly high resolution images on a near-eye display, and why they uniformly refer to their AR tech as ""holograms"" when at first blush they appear to be stereographic 3D. (There's actually no contradiction there, because they're stereograms presented using holographic imaging.)"
HoloLens,2v0nac,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Sat Feb 7 17:00:44 2015 UTC,"a stream of feelings, (you look sad, interested, etc), and a precise eye tracking to get exactly what are you are looking for.   I'm pretty sure they don't have either of those things (for now, at least). There's no camera aimed at your face to read your own emotion (it may be able to read other people's faces),and so far the only view tracking is what way your head is facing. I'd imagine if they had pupil tracking they would've made a big deal about it.   Maybe some redditor who knows more about how the eye really works, but i expect that what you see will not be a merely a digital 4k display, or a phone in your face, is more an analog machine.that knows where are you looking at and display in high res while your peripheral vision is in low res.   It's not the same as a display in your face, but it doesn't have peripheral vision, and the view doesn't change based on your eye movement, just your head movement (like the Rift does). Objects will seem like they're at the correct distances for what they're overlapping, but it can't display outside of a certain FOV."

This could probably be replaced on the desktop with a mouse command to indicate what is to be edited, but at this point why not just use keyboard/mouse commands completely for the editing?   I suppose a new sensor could be made to detect what the user is looking at on screen to replicate the HoloLens tracking/targeting, but that would probably be a huge effort to get that working right as there is currently nothing like that available.  I don't see this happening.  It would be hard to get this right and would take away from the 'wow' factor of what makes the Hologram interesting.

HoloLens,2u8ebs,Wupideedoo,5,Fri Jan 30 20:18:36 2015 UTC,"In the long term, I think that augmented reality devices do have the potential to replace much of our current technology, especially screens. However, I disagree with the extent of the replacement you seem to be suggesting. There are a number of things that the holographic interface fundamentally can't do:   Display information to a group of people without each of them using a headset. Even if we reach the ""hololens on every head"" stage of the technology, I think there will still be a use case for screens to share information without having everyone wearing a computer. Provide tactile feedback and interact with the physical world. You can get virtual instructions for how to cook, but if you want a temperature sensor for your turkey you still need a physical sensor. You can have Kinect Fitness style exercise routines, but if you want a treadmill you'll need the physical machine. You mention replacing phones with a piece of plastic, and it's true that you could have simpler versions of some devices that are then augmented, but holographic displays don't eliminate the need for more electronics that provide more complex physical interactions. Replicate the form factor of smaller devices: on the topic of smartphones, they present a less intrusive way of carrying around an internet-enabled device and camera than a headset does. This is particularly true for the first generation hololens which is clearly bulkier and heavier than a smartphone, but even assuming that one day headsets become the size of normal glasses they'd still have to overcome the social barriers to acceptance in public that Google Glass faced. It's possible that they will overcome that, but the ability to discretely use a device without suffering from the hidden camera ""creep factor"" is problematic.   Holographic devices may also have difficulty competing with conventional displays on resolution, color range, and color fidelity, and they may have difficulty competing with conventional computing platforms on raw processing power and battery life.  All that said, I'm as excited as you are for all the applications of HoloLens and similar technologies. I believe it will be transformative and something that will completely change the way many industries and products work. But the last consumer electronics invention? No, I don't buy that."
HoloLens,2u8ebs,BI_Joe,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:22:10 2015 UTC,"To take a different approach, I think that holographic / augmented reality devices take visual interaction with computers to their limits. Resolution and color issues aside, holographic displays are really the ""ultimate"" visual display. However, there's still room for innovation on devices that involve tactile and auditory interactions. There are lots of situations where needing to see an interface to interact with it is undesirable (when jogging, for example, or for any blind users)."
HoloLens,2u8ebs,BI_Joe,3,Sat Jan 31 01:37:44 2015 UTC,Nobody will want a brain implant. Awesome easy to remove AR is here for a looooong time. Methinks.
HoloLens,2u8ebs,Damo3000,1 point,Sat Jan 31 02:10:18 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with the idea of needing a method of non-visual interaction, but I maintain that something in AR is still the solution. It is so spatially aware that you could have some system set up where sounds or some other kind of stimulus alerted the wearer to the presence of people or objects in the surrounding area. There has even been a lot of advancement with taking signals and reappropriating them into something the brain can decode. We could see these connected to ocular implants for blind people to restore a great deal of sight.  What's wrong with seeing an interface while jogging though? If it's got controllable opacity (and it does), you can see where you're going and deal with visual information at the same time. But even if you would rather not see anything, it's a Windows 10 device; you will have Cortana."
HoloLens,2u8ebs,BI_Joe,1 point,Sat Jan 31 03:16:05 2015 UTC,"You didn't actually say anything that negated the idea of it being the last consumer electronics invention.  I disagree with your first scenario. I think it sounds a little too much like the ""the general public has no need for a computer"" sentiment from the late 70s. If wearable displays reach the proper level of ubiquity, sharing a common ""display"" will become the norm.  For your second scenario, I am not suggesting that the HoloLens will replace literally everything in your life (although temperature sensors are not out of the question, especially with smart appliances), I am saying it is the last invention for consumer electronics. A thermometer doesn't need to be invented; it already was. A treadmill doesn't need to be invented; it already was. And touchscreens themselves have already done most of the work when it comes to eliminating the need for complex physical interactions. People are increasingly accustom to the lack of tactile feedback. Specifically with respect to smartphones, there is literally nothing that an actual smartphone could do that an augmented smart phone could not, so I don't know why you think it would need to be a ""simpler version"". The piece of plastic would be merely for the comfort of those who had a hard time letting go to traditional form factors. I don't think it would take many people very long to get past that idea of display-in-hand and just start using floating personal displays.  On your third point, history has shown this to not be any problem. Portable cameras at the start of the 20th century were thought to be some kind of impending epidemic of privacy invading tools. That never really happened. As cameraphones and then smartphones rose to popularity there were a huge number of concerns about what it would mean for locker rooms, but again, it showed to not be a huge issue. All it takes is the right product to have far more benefits than drawback and reach a level of penetration that people recognize it as mostly harmless. Google Glass was $1,500, never really generally available, and far too limited in scope to be a broadly appealing product. AR is different in every key area (although I guess we will see about the price...). I honestly give it 5 years tops before we see a pair of very powerful AR glasses that are about the size of a pair of bulky Oakleys, with maybe some extra mass behind the ears for battery or processing/radio electronics and surround sound capabilities. Those will be the ones that truly penetrate.  But those won't be an invention. They'll be an iteration. My point is that with this now, when it comes to consumer electronics (not all things, just consumer electronics), inventing is over. Even if we get to the point where there are contact lenses or ocular implants, it is still going to be doing what this already does.  Now to be clear, I am not saying those won't have issues. Legislation is going to be a bitch when it comes to regulating how people get to use these while driving for instance. I understand that there is a difference between having a camera on a device that is still fairly conspicuous to be pointing at someone else and having something where the intention is that cameras are seeing everything that you see. But these are philosophical and political questions, and it does nothing to address this being the last consumer electronics invention."
HoloLens,2u8ebs,BI_Joe,4,Sat Jan 31 03:11:00 2015 UTC,"The thing about something being ""the last consumer electronics invention"" is that you're basically making a bet against all future innovation. I can't tell you what the next big thing will be, but we're nowhere near a point where improvements in technology are impossible.  The distinction between incremental improvements and ""inventions"" may be the source of our disagreement. Is any device that ties into the holographic ecosystem merely an iteration of that earlier invention? There's so much work left to do to bring the vision of holographic computing to reality that it seems absurd to assume that when we get there, there will be nothing left to invent.  In the near future, ""hologram"" apps may dominate innovation in the same way that mobile apps attracted a ton of interest from startups and venture capitalists in recent years. A new computing platform presents lots of opportunities for developers to develop ideas that weren't previously feasible. We've yet to even begin to see augmented reality as a mainstream platform, so of course it's possible to imagine many cases where it will change or replace the way we interact with existing technologies.  Leaving aside the fact that it will take many more genuine inventions to bring AR to its full potential, if we're going to be discussing the end of invention (in consumer electronics) then the real question is what happens once we have full, immersive, adaptive AR. If everything works the way you envision it, if displays have fully adjustable opacity, optics so good the human eye can't discern holograms from reality, near infinite battery life, perfect tracking, and so forth... once we have applications that simulate screens and smartphones, augmented-reality Skype, complete control over what is perceived and how digital worlds visually blend with the real world... is that it?  Again, I say no.  Getting to that level of technology would be immensely cool (and I can't help but add that saying we could get there without further consumer electronics inventions is vastly overselling the current HoloLens technology), but even fully programmable optics is still just optics. You'd still want a hoverboard. You'd still want a robot chef. You'd still want a replicator. You'd still want things that have mass and can exert forces on the world. If we had unlimited programmable matter coupled with fantasy-level augmented reality then yes, we might have reached the end of consumer electronics innovation, but only if you didn't consider the endless possibilities available for algorithmic/content innovation.  Everything I've said to this point in this comment assumes that augmented reality computing will reach the highest hopes we have for the technology and that that will happen with full societal acceptance before another disruptive technology leapfrogs it. These are not trivial assumptions. The things I brought up in my first post aren't devastating problems with augmented reality -- far from it -- but any issues will cause someone someday to wish for better tech. If you told someone when cars were invented that they were a neat idea, but it would be cooler if they could drive themselves, they'd surely think you were a Luddite clinging to horses (which at least tend to avoid running into walls), yet here we are in 2015 anxiously awaiting self-driving cars.   And touchscreens themselves have already done most of the work when it comes to eliminating the need for complex physical interactions. People are increasingly accustom to the lack of tactile feedback.   Sure, we've grown accustomed to it. But is it desirable to not have tactile feedback? If physical buttons could be dynamically added or removed from phones, would we still choose to tap a piece of plastic? The end of invention won't come until there's either no room for improvement or we collectively suffer from a ""failure of imagination"" to see how things could be improved."
HoloLens,2u8ebs,jdlashley,2,Mon Feb 2 00:56:50 2015 UTC,"People may continue to invent things like new processor or storage types, better methods of wireless communication, more accurate or believable methods for delivering visual information to your eye, etc. But as a for instance the Galaxy Note 4 is not an invention. It is an iteration. Even if new display types are invented, the category of product that they are going into will be an already invented category. And as a class of product, an AR visor has now been invented, and it can now fill the role of almost every piece of consumer electronics you have. The moment there is one small enough, detailed enough, and connected enough, then you reach a point where further improvements to fidelity don't amount to any practical difference, and improvements in capability can be handled through the cloud backend.  You may be right to think that there will be something past this once it reaches its peak, but that is the reason I put this post up. It was intended to be part self-exploration, part philosophical discussion, and part application of Cunningham's Law. The point is that with this one device, Microsoft has now made the idea of upgrading your television, computer, smartphone, games console, etc. obsolete. As with all things, it will take a few years to get there, and it several years more before everybody is on board, but if HoloLens plus a data connection is all of these things, then what would be the point in also having all of these things?  I feel like the disagreement here is that you're being pedantic. OLED displays were discovered and invented after LCDs. OLED displays themselves however are not consumer electronics. They go into consumer electronics, but they also go into other things that aren't for consumers. This is what I mean. Taking an existing technology and putting it into a piece of consumer electronics might be a good idea, but it is not an invention. And while some inventions may be put into devices at some point down the line, they are not themselves consumer electronics. There is definitely some room for nuance here. And maybe you want to say that the honor of this invention belongs to Sutherland in 1968. These are absolutely discussions that are interesting and worth having. But there is no question that what Microsoft is done here is made the first instance of a viable AR headset, and the potential for that is incalculable.  The point is that the overwhelming majority of people’s time is consumed with entertainment, social media, or digital productivity. A fact which The Onion satirized beautifully with this article. In 10 years tops, the idea of buying a replacement computer, or television, or phone, will start to be replaced with the idea that you don’t buy those things anymore.  In an IRL conversation someone pointed out robotics, as you did, as a field that could not be handled by AR. You might be able to impose a clean house into your field of vision, but someone still needs to clean that house for real. Roomba is safe from this making them obsolete, and I am hoping other companies decide to step in and fill more of this role. (Although I would also argue that replicators are also pretty much already here.)"
HoloLens,2u8ebs,rodcliftonOH,3,Mon Feb 2 22:35:56 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you're right that this is a matter of pedantry. I do absolutely disagree that iterations on a consumer product don't require invention, but that's not my main point. I think it would be interesting for you to read this article about smartphones. It's arguing very much along the same lines that you are (even mentioning heads-up display glasses as part of the replacement of screens).  I don't entirely disagree with you or the smartphone article, but I'm not sure what you're trying to prove either. I'll respond to the following point, since it seems central to your position that most existing forms of technology will be obsolete:   The point is that with this one device, Microsoft has now made the idea of upgrading your television, computer, smartphone, games console, etc. obsolete. As with all things, it will take a few years to get there, and it several years more before everybody is on board, but if HoloLens plus a data connection is all of these things, then what would be the point in also having all of these things?   What's the point now of having a smartphone, desktop, computer monitor, television, and games console? Why not just a smartphone with docks to make that phone a full workstation / game console / television? The technology to do that exists right now and you could even get AR with a kit like Google Cardboard. This sort of setup would lead to rather impoverished versions of worksations, game consoles, and so on, but if you could take your current-gen phone back to when the first BlackBerry prototypes were being unveiled, you'd probably convince people that all those other devices were going to be utterly obsolete. There are two problems here: first, that we are running into the physical limits of what can actually be done with processors so it's questionable whether a handheld phone could ever be as powerful as a modern desktop much less the desktops of the future, and second, that integration for the sake of integration is not always desirable. Why require a phone to be docked to a screen to watch movies when a TV can handle the streaming on its own? Why require everyone in a room to wear glasses and computing devices that need to synchronize amongst themselves to show an image when you could use a single TV? Why did my sister buy a digital picture frame after she already owned an iPad?"
HoloLens,2u8ebs,spoonard,2,Tue Feb 3 01:40:27 2015 UTC,"Two and a half years ago I would have agreed with that article completely. Honestly two and a half weeks ago, while I would have thought AR was the future, I would not have imagined it was this close. I would have still argued that a smartphone with a docking station (laptop, tablet, and desktop docking stations all as options) would be all the computing power that the overwhelming majority of people would need.  If we had reached a point a few years ago where people were buying into the cloud as a complete solution for computing, then a smartphone could have replaced all of these things then. Without the need for local heavy processing or massive storage, then all your device basically has to be powerful enough to do is connect. But there is one hugely fundamental difference between cloud assisted AR and cloud assisted smartphones: with smartphones you would still need the wealth of accessories just to make those things possible. You would need the phone, and you would need the dock for your TV, and for your desktop, and for your laptop, and for your tablet. And even then it would be anywhere near as functional as AR. This doesn't just replace the computing. It replaces the displays, and it at least enhances if not fully replaces input methods. And it doesn't just replace one display, it replaces them all.  It's not just about the technology being possible, it's about it being feasible. At first people will have AR and it will exist alongside their computer and TV and whatnot. But as time goes on, fewer and fewer people will buy dedicated devices for these tasks because the AR already does it. It will be like the very slow transition from landlines to cellphones. There are still people with landlines, but I know fewer and fewer people with them."
HoloLens,2u8ebs,spoonard,2,Tue Feb 3 06:19:31 2015 UTC,"Every kind of computer has been a balance between screen size and convenience. With the solid, flat displays we have now, those are inversely linked. You can't have a computer that shows as much content as you want and also have it be as portable as you want.  The nice thing about these headset computers like HoloLens is that they break the cycle. You're maximizing the display area by making use of your entire field of vision, and you're making it even more convenient than a phone or smartwatch by putting it directly on your face. There's nowhere left to go; they're perfect in that respect. Although of course there will be improvements in other areas."

Everyone here can dream up things that AR can be used for and make it sound great, but the hardware sensors that this will depend on are not at a level anywhere near what they need to be to match the expectations that MS set with its announcement video. Look at the Kinect sensors. They can't even detect their environment with a high level of accuracy all the time. Now pick it up and start moving it around and see what happens. It all goes to crap. Man, you are setting yourself up for a major disappointment."

HoloLens,2u7pku,BpsychedVR,6,Fri Jan 30 17:08:45 2015 UTC,Holography is actually kind of accurate: http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/25/7892663/in-depth-analysis-whats-inside-hololens
HoloLens,2u7pku,Wupideedoo,2,Fri Jan 30 18:12:43 2015 UTC,"HoloLense is an AR  device. [...] and AR cannot be VR.   That's the same as saying ""The Rift is a VR device. VR cannot be AR"". It's pretty obvious that attaching cameras to the Rift (as was already done) could allow it to be used for an AR experience, just like adding a cover to an AR device's display could make it provide a VR experience.  Technically, you're right, AR cannot be VR. However, the displays can work for either one with minor changes.   It does not produce holograms (or more accurately holographic images). This is just a buzzword used by MSOFT to promote HoloLens. A holographic image is a self-contained 3D structure built entirely out of light that people can view without a head mounted display.   This is pretty much the consensus in this sub. The only disagreement you'll see is people who think it's fine to use ""Hologram"" and ""Holographic"" because Microsoft uses those terms."
HoloLens,2u7pku,NeoKabuto,-2,Fri Jan 30 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"HoloLense is an AR  device. [...] and AR cannot be VR.   That's the same as saying ""The Rift is a VR device. VR cannot be AR"".   I'm sorry, but that's not the same as what I said at all. In fact, that's the inverse of what I said. I never would say something as foolish as, ""The Rift is a VR device. VR cannot be AR."" because I already know VR can 'become AR' with pass through cameras. Look up the video AR Rift on YouTube by wsteptoe, or any other AR Oculus Rift experiment video.   Technically, you're right, AR cannot be VR. However, the displays can work for either one with minor changes.   I don't understand how people think AR can become VR. To run a DK2 game to get a semblance of presence, you need to have either a GTX 970 or 980, and even that won't be good enough for a VR HMD that actually create presence. Also the optics and integrated software for a good VR experience are completely tailored for VR. The graphical intensity, optics, and minimal latency standards would have to be integrated in an AR HMD to elicit a decent VR experience, much less presence, which is in no way possible with the form factor MSOFT is going for. Also the display technology for both devices is completely different. Eventually, I do see them merging into one device, but not until at least a decade from now."
HoloLens,2u7pku,NeoKabuto,3,Fri Jan 30 17:36:55 2015 UTC,Whether it's good VR is irrelevant. The principles behind HoloLens and Rift are essentially the same: use digital displays to show you things that don't physically exist such that you can suspend your disbelief enough to believe they do anyway. One is just more translucent than the other.

Still, I was actually surprised that the HoloLens was announced to function independently of mobile phones &/or the Xbox.   I really thought it would leverage the processing power on those devices.   So, my big question as it pertains to the Xbox, is  how they interact?     I know the Xbox One is designed to feed multiple screens (so a tablet + the television), but will this work for augmenting games?    Like, can you add a heads up display (HUD) in the glasses that overlays your computer screen or put 3D effects between the user and the screen -- or maybe around the TV viewing area?      Can the XB1 send the instructions to HoloLens on a fast enough pipe to enable faster games?     Lots of questions."

Some game integration ideas:   The HUD is removed from the TV and placed on the hololens.  It would feel like you are wearing a spartan helmet Snapping apps to holograms instead of taking up screen real estate Increased FoV.  Imagine you are playing Halo and a grenade is thrown at you from far away.  It has a high arc so you see the grenade move up off the TV and into a hologram, come back down into the TV.  Maybe it goes to the side and rolls off the TV to the side of the screen.  This kind of augmentation is the next step in gaming and way more impressive than VR."

Otherwise, if we're wearing this as long as someone would wear, say, their eyeglasses, I think it would go the route of glassholes, and crash and burn quickly.

The biggest deciding factor is exactly how much control a web application would get from the AR browser. In VR, sensor data is only used to move the view around, and an experience does not need to adapt to the space the user is in, since they're expected to not move physically. For a real AR effect, a web application would need to be able to recognize objects in the cameras' field of view and adapt the experience to the environment around them.

HoloLens,2ttnmw,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Tue Jan 27 23:30:20 2015 UTC,"But I hope it's within consumer range tho. There's rumors circling about it using the Intel atom architecture for both it's GPU and CPU counterparts, but the ""HPU"" is still unknown as of right now. Hopefully price wouldn't be so much of a issue since it's rumored to be using a custom mobile processor. Only time will tell."

HoloLens,2tpfnc,fredman555,2,Tue Jan 27 01:00:31 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this from the start, Microsoft had some sort of spiritual journey. They want to be a platform, or experience, you have acrid everything you do with tech.   It's the way tech is going to head and they are on the ball. Hardware is almost irrelevant, it's the software now. And their idea of using Windows os across any device and it looks and functions the same and ate all synced, is a early step in the right direction"
HoloLens,2tpfnc,vusi_dube,1 point,Wed Jan 28 01:08:09 2015 UTC,"I think MS's bigger picture isn't even the HoloLens or this incarnation of their OS. MS has shown through the production of Windows as a whole, Xbox as a whole, Mobile as a whole that they can and have changed the way everyone interacts with the digital. Bring in HoloLens's and the inference is here's a way you can bring everything that you interact will digitally in one device. An inference of their quote ""Change you perspective, Change your reality"" is that as technology evolves we need to evolve with it to me rings true with a future where Microsoft produced implant for our brains or contact lenses for eyes (for the squeamish) will be the norm. We'll consume them as we do PCs, Laptops, Tablets and mobiles today. The beauty is that we wont have a need for any as all will be vitalized  Now that alone has implication the environments (e waste), city infrastructure (billboards. advertisements, shop fronts, road signs, roads, even the way we drive our cars and ride our bikes). The web stops being consumed by devices we carry around in our pockets but by implants that reside in our bodies or infront of our eyes, changing our reality by changing our perspective.   I think what the HoloLens has the potential to spark is a totally revolutionary way to remove the clutter in our lives. Allow for us to live and work in totally unforseen ways.  Imagine waking up in the morning and turning on your inbuilt (ocular/ brain implant) and being walked through the news of the day, your schedule for the up coming days, tasks you would like to complete in your home like grocery shopping etc... all by a virtual butler that you can talk and interact with as though they were a real person standing right in-front you. Instead of getting up to drive to work you walk into your study (desk chair and a couch in the real world) which transports you virtually into an office, work colleagues and business partners all virtually going about their work day as you are from home not really having to go into the office to hold meetings that can all be done from the comfort of you sofa at home. No monitors, no keyboard, not mouse no desktop/laptop/tablet... Just you and the spaces in your own home... Don't even get me started on what would it would look like when you when you go outside or walk down a street in a city...   HoloLens's excite me! The Social, Technological, Economic inferences that can be drawn from this invention are mind blowing. The changes to our physical environments makes me wish I'll be around for the next 50-60 years to see how this all ends up."

Mouse and keyboard support and the ability to run the full version of Windows 10, but able to position windows freely in space (i.e. the end of screen size limitations). I know people will say FOV is a problem, but I don't mind having to turn my head a bit to look at different windows. You'd need to turn your head anyway to read text in your peripheral vision region.

HoloLens,2tlzyp,stesch,4,Sun Jan 25 13:09:42 2015 UTC,I expect it to be in the price range of a high end Surface Pro. Maybe even more. But maybe we get surprised like when Apple announced the price of the first iPad. Everybody thought it had to be more than $1000 back then.  I don't really know what I would pay to own such a device. After seeing the promo video for the first time I would have gone over €3000 but now the hype fades a bit and I realize that a very expensive HaloLens wouldn't have enough users for a diverse apps ecosystem. So I guess around €1500 would be a good middle ground.
HoloLens,2tlzyp,kinyutaka,2,Sun Jan 25 13:09:47 2015 UTC,"Based on the fact that Oculus development kits are sold (by Oculus) for $350, and Project Morpheus from Sony is expected to hit a similar price point, I would expect somewhere in the $500-$750 range, considering the added computer processing in the device."

HoloLens,2tlzyp,maple_leafs182,6,Mon Jan 26 06:42:07 2015 UTC,"I believe it will all come down to the display technology itself. The self-contained PC component is simply the next generation of minipcs akin to the top-end HDMI stick PCs on the market today.  I haven't seen an exact description of how the display tech works, though the vague descriptions I have seen sound similar to virtual retinal display tech. As far as I've been able to find, the only VRD device being marketed to consumers is the Avegant Glyph, which is priced at $599 for a 720p model - and which is still in the ""Engineering and Design"" phase, according to their timeline. Avegant's original kickstarter had a $499 pricetag, but also had an anticipated ship date of fall 2014, which they missed. They're currently saying fall of this year, so the actual release is somewhat up-in-the-air.  So, if Avegant's pricing is still applicable, I would expect the following factors to come into play:   Microsoft can manufacture in much higher volume than Avegant - and if the initial hands-on reactions are anything to go by, expect the HoloLens to be a pretty hot item. VRD is improving in both quality and price at a pretty brisk pace, so Avegant's 720p model is likely now somewhat dated. They were showing a functional prototype in 2013. It's likely that current VRD tech can do 1080p at a similar cost, although 4K would be a better target for this kind of thing. Reports have it that HoloLens uses the Cherry Trail line of Intel's Atom processors (Already shipping to manufacturers, but not yet available in any consumer product). Although Intel is being tight lipped to the public regarding Cherry Trail details (including price), it's likely that it won't be significantly more expensive than their existing Bay Trail chips.   Based on a combination of the above and some arbitrary guesswork, I'd put the HoloLens MSRP at between $600 and $800. I don't believe it would be as low as $500, and I would be very surprised if it were priced as high as $1,000. If I'm right, I will probably guy one. If I've overshot, I will almost definitely buy one. If I've underestimated it, it will depend on how long I would have to live off ramen noodles in order to make up for the cost."
HoloLens,2tlzyp,jacf29,4,Sun Jan 25 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I know very little about it but it seems like something that would be around $700 at the cheapest.

I'm crazy excited to see what comes from HoloLens."
HoloLens,2tlzyp,maple_leafs182,4,Sun Jan 25 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"I probably wouldn't pay 1500 for first gen. But down the road if they can get it to work as well as the concept video showed, I would be willing to pay 3000."
HoloLens,2tlzyp,Hillbillyjacob,3,Mon Jan 26 04:54:46 2015 UTC,"If it's mind blowing and has a battery life similar to most cell phones, $600-800.  $500 would be ideal though.    When you think of it, most high end cell phones off contract are that much.  The most likely thing that will happen with hololens are contracts with monthly payments."

HoloLens,2tlzyp,NeoKabuto,3,Mon Jan 26 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"At this point all we can do is guess. My assumption is that running some specific operations (maybe the 3D positional tracking of user in room, and holo-objects in room) were inefficient on the CPU or GPU, leading to poor battery performance. Splitting those operations out onto an ASIC that only handles them improves efficiencies, and allows them to coin a new processor name.   So probably a fairly cheap to make ASIC, with the HPU name being mostly marketing fluff :)"

They are trying very hard to get EVERYONE on the same page in regards to OS so they can roll out some pretty amazing stuff.  Much like how Apple essentially gets everyone on the same IOS by giving it away for free or selling it very cheaply.    With that, I think the HoloLens will probably sell for around the price of a Smart Phone, probably around $600 give or take.  Or possibly, in order to get it in as many hands as possible, they will sell it at cost with the hopes of making it back via HoloLens apps.  If that is the case we could see a $399 priced HoloLens which competes with Oculus Rift (yes, I know they are not the same, but many consumers won't understand that) and various other ""VR"" offerings.

Augmented with animated pieces, automated handling of rules, the ability to save games, online multiplayer, and a resistance to sore losers knocking over the table. Miniature fighting games and RPGs. 3rd person games would be relatively easy to adapt by shrinking them down and making the camera more static (as the player themselves would be the camera). Large strategy games would adapt particularly well to holographic form, as would games involving lots of 3D spatial information (e.g. 3D chess or 3D platformers) A miniature monster catching and battling game that is totally not infringing on any existing intellectual properties Horror games designed to add minimal changes to the real environment. Was that flicker part of the game? Space invaders arcade game, designed to appear like the aliens are shooting down at you through a huge whole in your ceiling Game that makes your floor look like lava (probably going to be made by Double Fine as part of a sequel to Kinect Party)   Some non-gaming applications:   Being able to completely re-theme your work environment and home.

Being able to just pin it to any wall and use it as my tv (however big I want it to be) sounds amazing to me. So along those lines...my idea is that HoloLens could work alongside Xbox One. Basically you would stream the game through it so you could use HoloLens as your big ass tv instead of your normal tv. On top of that though, for multiplayer...instead of doing split screen, you would each see just your view through your HoloLens.   The second idea might be kind of feminine but I think it would work for men too: shopping. Imagine just looking at yourself in the mirror as you go through clothes you want to buy. It would detect your ""shape/figure"" and it will put the clothing ""on"" you so you can see what it would look like as if you were actually wearing it.

This all points to a larger field of view.   Also, the other demos show that there were multiple holograms displays at the same time spanning the width and height of the room they were in. Notice the live demo on stage when the woman was building the flying saucer. So, it appears that the field of view is actually not nearly as small as you assert."

HoloLens,2teoh5,BpsychedVR,0,Fri Jan 23 17:57:11 2015 UTC,"True, HoloLens is not a traditional VR headset (which is basically just two small screens in front of your eyes).   This is not an accurate description of basic VR at all. Maybe a basic way to activate 3D perception cues, but not VR.   True, HoloLens primary purpose is to produce holograms into our real environment.   HoloLens does not produce holograms. Holograms are self-contained structures made out of light. HoloLens projects an image into your view and manipulates it so it seems as though it is further away than it is, which is called augmented reality. I know, they used the words ""holographic"" and ""HPU"" but it's just a buzzword, not the real thing.   Well, for one, the demo of the Mars rover showed that a complete 360 degree environment CAN be experienced with HoloLens. One of the Nasa scientists stated that she could look in any direction and be surrounded by the Mars environment. So, if game devs choose to, they can use HoloLens to allow gamers to actually virtually experience the game worlds.   I agree with you on that!   particularly the scene where the gamer place bombs on a wall, which exploded, giving the impression that there was a Minecraft world through the hole in the wall) PROVES that HoloLens holograms CAN completely cover over areas in our real environment with game environments.   This was in a promotional video, and this particular experience was not demoed to anyone at the press release.   By the way, remember that the way HoloLens works is that it places the holographic objects closer to our eyes that the actual objects in our real environments similarly to when you place you hand in front of your face. You see your hand as opposed to whatever else may be behind it. Therefore, those holograms cover over and are more visible than the objects in your room.    This is wrong, my friend.   So, all game devs have to do is figure out how to render their game worlds as interactive, explorable holograms.    This can't be done yet. The FOV (field of view) is far too narrow to even perceive your entire surroinding augmented."
HoloLens,2teoh5,BpsychedVR,1 point,Fri Jan 23 23:56:20 2015 UTC,"Current VR methods are basically placing two small screen in from of your eyes to simulate a 3d like, experience with peripheral view. That is the method Oculus and Morpheus and Samsung currently use.  You're knit picking at words. I never stated that the device itself creates the holograms. But the device does make the holographic programs appear to exist in our real world. It is vital to that process.And obviously holograms or AR are not real tangible things. Hence, their being AUGMENTED reality.  Yes these were promotional demos. But in addition to showing live demos on stage, each person present was afterward given a hands on in their labs and Every person present for the stage demo was given a personal hands on with hololens and aside from some stating that the gov was smaller than what they expected, never once stated that the effect they personally experienced in their hands on was in any way different from the stage demo they saw. Its a safe bet to assume that had their actual hands on NOT match that which the stage presentation shown, that these journalists would have mentioned it to msfts embarrassment. Instead, they all praised it. And yes, they got go experience the same minecraft bombs on the wall hologram experience as the stage demo showed. They were amazed by it.  You should do some more research on how hololens works, because I am correct. Hololens projects the light from the holograms into our eyes to trick us into believing that they are real tangible objects. It uses the same method that our eyes use to perceive the world around us -- reflected light into our eyes. Go look it up.  Again, you fail to grasp that these are still under development and more advancements will undoubtedly be made be for release. So the field of view may increase. And again, you assume just how small the gov currently is DESPITE numerous hands on reports stating that the fov did not adversely affect the experience.

HoloLens,2te8ln,Lynkk,3,Fri Jan 23 11:41:05 2015 UTC,anchor points for shit are probably one of the biggest problems they had to solve early.  I can't imagine the journalists who made skype calls with it didn't report wonky windowing. It immediately breaks immersion.
HoloLens,2te8ln,Madd0g,2,Fri Jan 23 11:49:26 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that those little cameras just above the eyes are basically Kinects, and so it knows its own position and orientation relative to whatever is around it. I imagine it will be difficult to ""stick"" things on outdoor objects, though a HUD that travels with you should be fine."

HoloLens,2tapyg,OldRedditorNewTricks,3,Thu Jan 22 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that, but im looking forward to reddit being on any surface in my house"
HoloLens,2tapyg,OldRedditorNewTricks,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:39:26 2015 UTC,"Who needs a surface when the frontpage is dropping as posts from your ceiling? You just reach for the one you want, and the window moves closer into viewing mode (window floating in front of your face, etc.) Want to add a comment? Just speak it, or touch type in mid-air, without moving your hands to an actual keyboard, instead the chosen letters are already appearing before your eyes as you wiggle your fingers at your side."
HoloLens,2tapyg,shallowwatersailor,3,Thu Jan 22 20:40:01 2015 UTC,"The possibilities are endless! I was thinking I'd be ""reading a book"" (like a 700+ page textbook or something), my housemates would pass by and be like ""woah this guy is super productive!"", but I actually have reddit being displayed on the pages of the book. Or maybe, youd be reading a newspaper, so it looks like youre catching up on important global issues, but nope! youre just watching some cute cat video.    this is the future."

HoloLens,2t9qbr,sly1881,2,Thu Jan 22 08:00:48 2015 UTC,Assuming they are going the same way as with Windows 8 app development it will be both. Maybe c# first.
HoloLens,2t9qbr,Pwnycorn2208,2,Thu Jan 22 14:02:48 2015 UTC,I'm thinking it's going to be both from the start
HoloLens,2t9qbr,MitoG,2,Thu Jan 22 22:00:11 2015 UTC,Unlikely.  I imagine the development of this would be closer to game development.  There are several game development engines that Microsoft uses and the best ones are C#.    JS is certainly possible but for something like this that requires fairly high performance I'm putting money on C# only.
HoloLens,2t9woo,Genesis_Prime,0,Thu Jan 22 09:42:25 2015 UTC,Could? Glass (in its current state) is dead. it was pulled.  No doubt Google is going to respond with their own AR based off what they did with glass
HoloLens,2t9woo,fredman555,1 point,Thu Jan 22 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"Its not confirmed that its dead, the explorer edition is just no longer being sold.  I suspect the focus will be on Magic Leap which should supersede all of Google Glass capability and compete with HoloLens."
HoloLens,2t9woo,Summons,1 point,Fri Jan 23 02:03:42 2015 UTC,"application development has stopped and its pulled. if its not dead based off that, the simple fact that AR blows having a reflective quarts, thats less than an inch big, out of the water.  Point being, we wont be seeing Google glass (in its current state) around anymore. Its strange to say, but its pretty obsolete"

HoloLens,2t75gl,toejamfloyd,2,Wed Jan 21 18:56:16 2015 UTC,Yeah. They said in the presentation that they've been working with 3rd party developers on it for years now.
HoloLens,2t75gl,Bossman1086,1 point,Wed Jan 21 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, the article says Kipman has been working on the Hololens for 7 years.   But what I find more interesting is the lack of leaks surrounding this. I mean, if Apple was producing this thing, the whole world would have known about it by now."
HoloLens,2t75gl,toejamfloyd,2,Wed Jan 21 19:10:46 2015 UTC,there were rumors on GDC parties when devs were drunk ;) but everyone suspected a VR HMD

HoloLens,2t75gl,no_flex,2,Thu Jan 22 01:15:34 2015 UTC,I doubt apple is even close to finishing vr or ar.  They have been focusing on wearables

I know it won't magically allow for ""3D"", but should it be as usable to a person with monovison as an overlay to their every day life.  i.e., with monovision, the world is always 2D, will this be able to overlay on top of that."

HoloLens,2t7mec,MicroByte,7,Wed Jan 21 20:57:21 2015 UTC,"I dreamed of this since having my first experience with VR 18 years ago.  It was a crude VR setup that came to my university that ran extremely low poly VR, but it was so amazing.  Since then, I've always wanted something that could create an immersive  experience and Oculus/HoloLens look to be things that could potentially do that.  I love that HoloLens is it's own self contained device.  So much potential and I really hope that it's not a pie in the sky concept.    The fact that NASA will incorporate their tech with the Curiosity program on Mars gives me hope that it's more than just this.    This is so exciting!"
HoloLens,2t7mec,jacf29,3,Wed Jan 21 21:04:59 2015 UTC,"Looking at the presentation video, HoloLens has a advantage of projecting hologram on specific areas such as icons on the fridge and TV screen. I see a future where you will no longer have TV, but having multiple HoloLens which whole family can enjoy a great movie while still being able to interact with each other. One of the advantage of HoloLens over Oculus is that HoloLens is like a wearable glass with no wires required, so you can walk around the house without being disoriented."
HoloLens,2t7mec,fredman555,5,Wed Jan 21 21:16:49 2015 UTC,10 years ago I would have never thought that we would have something like this so soon.  Bravo Microsoft.   This year will go down in history.  Oculus and now this?  Don't know if I can hold in this anticipation :)
HoloLens,2t7mec,idontbelieveyouguy,2,Thu Jan 22 02:34:44 2015 UTC,"The HoloLens can and will change the game.  Everyone remember the first generation iPhone? it was crude and clunky, but within 8 years time we now have pocket computers we incorrectly call phones. Samsung, MS and other companies hoped on the idea of the smartphone and look how far weve come based off of 1 companies idea. What started as a cool piece of tech ('im fine with calling and texting!' we yelled) turned into an extension of ourselves. Today if you DONT have smartphone youre actually limited in our technologically fast paced society.  Monitor? keyboard? dont need it. Architects now have an outlet to properly view their creations. Movie makes, small and large can now create stories and animations that interact with you. Video games are now more customizable and interactive than before. Education is no longer reading from a book and imagining, but rather right infront of your face showing you exactly what happens. business meeting can be in the room with you, not on a 2d box from a screen. Hell, the simple fact we are talking about how obsolete and passe the idea of video calling is when we were drooling at the tech less than a decade ago is testimony to the intensity of this product. who needs to buy the Oculus and the omni for a virtual experience when you can get 5 friends to run to your back yard and create your own puzzle/fps/action game? Advertisements and signs are now in 3d AR space rather than actually there.  Good bye Occulus, so long Glass. And hellooooo Hololens!   And unlike other devices, this is beyond the concept model. MS isnt handing us a barrel of promises, they held up a working product that has the same functionality as their CGI rendered advert, and then let the consumer try it for themselves. Sure the field of view is limited, a poor 20 for so frames per second and only a 179 view angles ( if memory serves) but again, while they are poor compared to other techs standards we need to realize this is the first iteration of this kind of tech, and with that in mind the fps and view angles are pretty damn good.    I dont know what i watched yesterday but it wasnt the Microsoft i knew since i was a little munchikin. theyve seemed to have had a spiritual journey and are changing how they approach everything. they are no longer an operating system provider, they are an experience. Ive yet to see any sort of news or opinion claiming the tech is faulty or has no purpose, i only see people saying ""but what can you do with it"" which a limitation on the persons imagination, and not the product.  Well done microsoft, you invented the wheel and a whole new market. im not one to buy the first iteration of a product, but god damnit if im not trusting my technolust this time and getting the first release."
HoloLens,2t7mec,fredman555,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:15:05 2015 UTC,you do realize that Blackberry and Microsoft both had out smartphones long before the iphone existed.
HoloLens,2t7mec,idontbelieveyouguy,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:51:30 2015 UTC,"Yes but their ""smart phones"" were nothing like the modern concept of a smartphone. And they were only used by professionals, some times.  And in reality, they were more so heavily featured PDAs than smartphones"
HoloLens,2t7mec,fredman555,0,Thu Jan 22 18:05:23 2015 UTC,umm the only difference between blackberrys/ms phone then and now is that we have huge app markets the OS them selves are pretty close
