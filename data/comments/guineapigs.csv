guineapigs,3e1jhz,OhGodAGirl,12,Tue Jul 21 06:22:15 2015 UTC,How in the world did you manage that?  Mine inhale food in such a way as to put feeding-frenzied sharks to shame.
guineapigs,3e1jhz,Svataben,6,Tue Jul 21 10:17:21 2015 UTC,"Lots and lots of training!  I've taught them the 'stay' command - so I'll give him a piece of food and he will put it in his mouth, and then I'll hold up my hand (like a stop sign) and say stay. Once he's able to eat it, I put my hand down and tell him okay and off he goes to inhale it.  Guinea pigs need both a visual and verbal command with training, and they are little arseholes in the beginning, but surprisingly they can be trained to do all sorts of awesome stuff! Even the basic commands are awesome for taking them out of the cage, clipping nails, toilet training, etc."

guineapigs,3e492v,Project_Leda,2,Tue Jul 21 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"Try switching the bedding and give your pig a bath. I know you're traumatized about the entire thing , but you need to take care of your piggy. She needs you. As to cleaning the cage, use vinegar, its much safer to use on the cage, (if you don't want to buy another.)"
guineapigs,3e492v,Miss_Mustaches,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:20:51 2015 UTC,What kind of bedding should I switch over to?   I just finished giving her a bath and I hope she feels nice and clean.  Thanks!
guineapigs,3e492v,halfaxas,2,Tue Jul 21 21:35:35 2015 UTC,"You should definitely look into purchasing a C&C cage (if you don't have one already) and using fleece bedding. This type of cage would give your pig more space to roam around, and I have found that the fleece bedding is so much easier and less messy to clean out, plus it's much more comfortable for your pig. Here and here are some links to info on C&C pages, and here is info on fleece bedding (although there's much more on google if you search). You can buy pre-made fleece cage liners or make your own. Good luck!"

If you're tired of the fruit flies, try this method:  Take a small, shallow cereal bowl (something with sloped edges). Place a portion of apple cider vinegar in it (fill the bowl 1/4 of the way with the apple cider vinegar).  Cover with plastic wrap.  Using a needle or push pin, poke small holes in the plastic wrap.  Change as often as needed, I could usually go a few days without needing to change it.  Good luck."

Last year when I used this method I had an old container I upended and put the bowl on top of it.  It might take a few days for the fruit flies to discover it.  The plastic wrap should prevent any escapees and spills."

I'd just use bleach at 1:9 bleach to water and let it sit for 10 minutes before rinsing. My piggies have never had ringworm, but I'm in dog rescue, plenty of dogs with ringworm. We actually treat the dogs with the 1:9 bleach solution, as well as clean their area/bedding with it. Just dab it right on their spots. I go one step further and treat with anti-fungal cream too."
guineapigs,3e2qpx,ghoudah4221,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:42 2015 UTC,"A similar thing was going on with mine when I just got them. First, I just gave them different food bowls, which helped a lot (this is when the dominant male would nip the other). I had to leave a lot of space between the bowls, though, as Tesla (the dominant one) would just eat from both. Eventually he stopped, and now they get along great."
guineapigs,3e2qpx,lastcommenter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:39 2015 UTC,"Different bowls and bottles can definitely help or correct the problem. Mild nipping is pretty normal behavior, Skip isn't drawing blood, right?"

guineapigs,3e2qpx,laughitupfuzball,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"How old are they? I have two boars who have lived together the younger one's whole life. When I first got them there was a clear power dynamic. Since the younger one, Chewie, hit puberty it has been a constant battle for dominance. I generally tend to see it as a brother-like relationship: they just enjoy antagonizing each other. The rule I have always heard is that unless they draw blood (and not just tiny nips or spots where hair has been pulled out) or go into a ""flying ball of fur"" you should just let them do their thing. What size is your cage? Do you have two of everything and/or things set up so no pig can effectively block the other? Do you have hides with just one entrance? Basically, if one can trap the other or block it from a resource there will be more tension."
guineapigs,3e2qpx,success_express,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:28 2015 UTC,They are about 1 1/2 years old. I only have one bowl and water bottle but I wil probably get a second of each. They're not able to trap each other or block food/water. The cage is 4'x4'. So I think they'll be fine if I get a second food bowl and water bottle. Thanks for the help:)
guineapigs,3e2qpx,success_express,0,Tue Jul 21 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"You should think about even giving them a bigger cage of there's room. It's not overly expensive to do it yourself,  and it gives the pigs space to cool themselves. It worked great with mine"

guineapigs,3e0x9w,OhGodAGirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:04:44 2015 UTC,"0.2 mg per kilo - weigh your guinea pig before administering, it is imperative you dose correctly. Here is where you can read up some more.  Do you think you could get some topical Ivermectin too, to apply directly to the skin? I'd advise that, since Ivermectin administered orally can upset their stomach - and an upset stomach can cause even more troubles. It's 0.5 mg per kilo for topical applications.  For administration - add some water and mix it into a paste, and then syringe it into their mouths. Or, you can do what I do - lather it on a vegetable and shove it in their mouth!   Just take it slow with the syringe - you want to angle it behind their teeth, coming in at the side of their mouth so they don't choke. Once they start 'chewing' frantically, you've put the syringe in far enough - administer the medication in small doses. It might take several minutes to get through the syringe, and that's okay. Just take it slow."

My others don't (American short-haired and what I think is a teddy/rex mix), except for one of my American short-haired who used to bite very hard, he's now accepted me as guinea pig leader of the herd."
guineapigs,3dvjc0,Smiley007,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:48 2015 UTC,"I've got a biter too. I think it's because she was the runt of her litter (and I'm sure it didn't help either that she was the only girls besides her mother). She also tends to grind her teeth and chew on a turret whenever she relaxes on her pigloo, so naturally whenever she rests on me she might lick, or tug my clothes or tug my skin... Just kind of her nature and I don't think it'll stop any time soon. I've had her going on 2 years in october."
guineapigs,3du8qf,cartman2468,4,Sun Jul 19 15:04:04 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry. Pets are never ""just a pet"", they're critters that we form deep emotional bonds with and it's perfectly natural to mourn their loss.  I agree with /u/is2gstop that it's best to give your other pig time to grieve before finding a partner, and be sure to give her plenty of love and affection in the interim.  The grief may feel crushing at the moment, but it will get better. You will get through this."
guineapigs,3du8qf,DimethyleneBlue,3,Sun Jul 19 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry! Hold on, it will get better. :)"
guineapigs,3du8qf,EatorofPizzas,3,Sun Jul 19 15:59:26 2015 UTC,"I dont know what to do with my guinea pig that is left, should I /rehome her? Should she be okay if I give her more attention?"
guineapigs,3du8qf,is2gstop,2,Sun Jul 19 16:06:30 2015 UTC,"For now, give her plenty of attention. She'll be grieving the loss of her buddy too. Eventually you may be able to find a partner for her to live with, but definitely don't rush into it - it may not be good for you to jump into a new pet straight away. Is she safe from your dog? Can he get to her home?  It does get better. Speaking from my own experience, you'll likely cry a few times a day for about a week. After then it'll start easing off. However, you may still cry every now and then when you think about her for months later."
guineapigs,3du8qf,is2gstop,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:28:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah my parents say that we should see how she is for now, and if she starts being different and not eating, etc, then we will get a new one, probably one that comes from a shelter or home. She's in a hutch, the dog can't get into the hutch but when I feed them I open the hutch door a little bit so I can reach my hand in with hay and food, unfortunately he lunged right in and grabbed one completely, I have honestly never been so shocked before in my life it all happened so fast. He's not allowed in any room apart from his bedroom whilst the guinea pig is inside the house now, and obviously he is going to be locked in his room when feeding etc.   I just feel so bad for the pigs you know? I don't want to be an attention snob, but I can't get the image of Cookie out of my head, her eyes were so scared and I couldnt do anything, everyone rushed over and even my dad couldnt get my dogs mouth to let go until it was too late. I think getting a new pig will heal both mine and Coco's heart, although we will both always remember Cookie. Obviously like you said, I'm not going to rush into it, I don't want it to feel like I am disrespecting Cookie by replacing her."
guineapigs,3du8qf,freakstop,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:39:02 2015 UTC,"It's not at all being an attention snob. It's a horrible thing to go through and isn't your fault at all. The image will fade, I promise, but it will take time. You've just got to remember that she had a good life, you were a great owner and nothing more could be done.  Everybody mourns differently, so if you think getting another pig will help look into it. The gut reaction when a pet dies is to get a new one straight away - for some people it works out, for others it doesn't, so be careful. It's not at all disrespectful though, so don't worry about that.  If you ever want to talk, PM me. Hugs."
guineapigs,3du8qf,i_am_ms_greenjeans,2,Sun Jul 19 17:48:43 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry this happened to you and your piggy. It was a traumatic event for you, so it is going to take time, on top of just grieving your loss. And that's OK. You've been given some good advice from the other commenters, but I wanted to express my sympathy. I still remember every rodent pet I've had. It always hurts, but eventually you'll be able to look back at the good memories and not just the sad ending. Take you're time."
guineapigs,3du304,moonsoar,2,Sun Jul 19 14:00:44 2015 UTC,"Our piggy pair was similar. Jadzia exhibited all the behaviors you mentioned, and Ezri, who is now in piggy heaven, rarely did. Ezri was definitely the submissive one, and while we could tell she was hormonal at times, she rarely showed dominant behavior because she wasn't the dominant. Is your pair the same way? I can tell you that the behaviors you mention are perfectly normal, and both pigs should be fine as long as they're not biting or clawing each other. If the non-dominant pig seems unusually stressed, you can perhaps give her some alone time from the other, but remember again that this is normal piggy behavior. :-)"
guineapigs,3du304,SCVannevar,2,Mon Jul 20 07:28:20 2015 UTC,"I should add that Jadzia is, and Ezri would now be, almost 4 and a half years old. Ezri passed just a few weeks ago, and Jadzia kept being all alpha pig right up until the end. (She's lonely these days, but we're hoping to give her a new friend or two next weekend.)"
guineapigs,3du304,SCVannevar,2,Mon Jul 20 07:39:00 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about Ezri. :( You must miss her horribly.  Our older one is currently the dominant one, as we got the other one when she was probably about 2 months old... the younger is almost fully grown now, though, and every so often tries to become the dominant one. We're still waiting to see how this is going to play out.  The older one sometimes nips, but it's usually when the younger one is going out of her way to annoy the other one.  They used to squabble quite a bit, but we built them a second floor to their cage, and their behaviour has dramatically changed since then. Now they rarely fight, unless the older one wants into the hidey hole that the other is sleeping in (even though we have multiple)."
guineapigs,3du304,Svataben,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:14:07 2015 UTC,"In my experience, naturally dominant piggies go into heat much more obviously.  And I agree with you, your old pig never had anyone to dominate or be sexy for, so there wasn't much need.  Now you have a new, more dominant and social pig, and it's showing you all it's got. XD"

guineapigs,3du2v7,Pignamedpig,2,Sun Jul 19 14:19:18 2015 UTC,"I'm in the UK so my answers might not be very helpful if you're elsewhere!  For pellets, I use Science Selective. I looked at reviews/recommendations on The Guinea Pig forum and these had very good reviews, and the pig seems to like it. I got my pigs from a rescue and that's what they use too.  I get hay from pet shops and discount stores like B&M depending on what the discount stores have available.   For veggies, on a daily basis they get at least one type of lettuce (round, red leaf, romaine or gem), cucumber and celery. I add in bits of coriander, carrot, parsley, green pepper, kale, spring greens, apple, a grape (occasionally) etc depending on what I have in the fridge at the moment!

guineapigs,3du2v7,sympathyboner,2,Sun Jul 19 15:05:26 2015 UTC,"If you have adult piggies, your pellets should be timothy based.

I use the Kaytee timothy complete, though I'm sure there are better brands if you want to order online.   I try to stick to a veggie schedule so they know when they are getting treats. :) On a daily basis, mine get romaine lettuce and a carrot. They also like parsley, cilantro, green peppers, the occasional small piece of apple. I would check out the chart Pignamedpig suggested!  edit; I get my timothy hay at the store. I would check livestock feed stores in your area if you have a place to store a bale of hay!"

guineapigs,3dt608,xReimi,4,Sun Jul 19 05:19:50 2015 UTC,I would start by maybe bringing hero to the vet to make sure you do not need to put any ointment on him.  As for possibly putting them together again I would advise against it.  I have had two guinea pigs that did not get along (dusty and ice cream cone). Dusty bit off some fur to ice cream cones lip and made it bleed. I separated them both and got all girls spay so I can pair them up with boys. Now everyone is happy.  You can bring them together for floor time or a place that has none of their scent so that they can all bond together and see if that helps but as far as saying yes put them together I would not do until you give them supervised time together and feel 100% sure that they are not gonna fight again.
guineapigs,3dt608,bigassdragon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:09:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your advice! I have a temporary cage built and placed it side by side the main cage so that they can all interact without getting violent. After Hero's injuries heal, I plan to maybe bathe them together and hope for good results during playtime. It really relieves me to hear that others have gone through the same ordeal. I am kind of sad because I wanted to add in a third one for more companionship for the other two, but it has only ended up with the meek one getting injured.  I'll keep you updated with their situation! Thank you so much again!"
guineapigs,3dt608,horriblenoises,2,Sun Jul 19 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"Yikes, so sorry about Hero's bites. Similar situation here, I have two pigs that simply can't get along despite a long introductory period; they each get along very well with my third pig, the dominant boar.   I think it's almost certain that Toto is doing the biting, particularly if there weren't any bites before you got him. Your situation mirrors mine, everyone gets along with the dominant pig, and the new pig is aggressive towards the other beta pig.  Our two disagreeing pigs alternate days in a smaller pen that shares a wall with our main C&C cage, they can interact, but they can't fight. Every recent attempt at reintroduction has broken into fighting in under a minute. It would be lovely if they could get along, but it's an equitable solution and our dominant boar gets alternating playdates. Hopefully you'll have better luck than we did. Like u/bigassdragon said, re-introduce them after Hero heals on neutral territory. Good luck!"

guineapigs,3ds81b,bigassdragon,3,Sun Jul 19 00:46:37 2015 UTC,"I think your piggy might be a mix of American and teddy breed. Does the fur feel very soft and fluffy? Teddy breeds are fluffy as heck.  Look at my pics of my guinea pigs.  I have two Peruvians, three abbys, one teddy, one teddy and American mix, one Peruvian and Abby mix.  Graham is a full teddy, ice cream cone is the American and teddy mix.  Your guinea pigs hair and description kinds of sounds like ice cream cones fur.

guineapigs,3ds81b,bigassdragon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:52:17 2015 UTC,"All of your pigs are absolutely adorable! They all have the prettiest colors and patterns, too.  The third and last photo really remind me of him. The last photo especially, their face shapes, eyes, and fur (minus the color) almost look exactly the same. His fur is soft with just this slight ""wirey"" feeling to it. His fur doesn't poof out quite as much, but it is still fairly thick and fluffy. The blonde at the ends of his fur seem to give his fur a slimming effect, lol."
guineapigs,3ds81b,NaughtyOrGneiss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:06:30 2015 UTC,The third one is graham he is my full teddy. He is very fluffy.  The last one is ice cream cone. She is my american and teddy mix.  My gf /u/vanillakahlua has a lot of pics of all of them with names attached. I forgot I was the loser that only posted one set of pics of all of them.  So if your guinea pig is like the third and the last then he is definitely part teddy. I don't think he is full teddy maybe a little American in him. Check out my gf's account all she ever posts is pics of our babies.

When tomorrow starts without me And I'm not around to see; If the sun should rise and find your eyes All filled with tears for me.  I wish so much you wouldn't cry The way you did today; While thinking of the many things We didn't get to say.  I know how much you love me As much as I love you; And each time that you think of me, I know I'll miss you, too.  When tomorrow starts without me, Don't think we're far apart For every time you think of me, I'll be right there in your heart. -Anonymous"

Also, See if you can get some fresh sawdust from somewhere, make the place smell like fresh cut logs. Or bake bread, that's supposed to work.  Vinegar deoderizes and cleans, we use it everywhere because of our budgies. They love licking it off the bars of their cage afterwards.

guineapigs,3dausk,Pignamedpig,2,Tue Jul 14 22:36:39 2015 UTC,Neat! I will try this with my piggies.
guineapigs,3dbv6z,SilverHoudini,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:42:11 2015 UTC,"About the startling, that's completely normal. He could've been sleeping and you scared him. I do that to my pig all the time.   And the shaking while purring. It sound like that unhappy/mad purring. You just might want to leave him alone for a while. He's acting completely normally."
guineapigs,3dbv6z,Girlmeetsminecraft,2,Wed Jul 15 05:02:36 2015 UTC,"Yep definitely normal stuff. They run away when startled or scared, it's pretty much their only defense.  You will figure out which veggies they like, they are all different (ours like chicory the best). They love fruit like blueberries and strawberries and watermelon but avoid giving them really sugary things too often (moderation is key there).  Companions are good, they are social animals. But it's also twice the work and expense. And if you think the behavior is weird now, just wait until you have multiple and they start humping and rumble strutting! You generally don't want to mix sexes, and if you get a companion sooner is better. You want to try to avoid introducing new pigs to an established herd if possible.  The purring is usually their ""alarmed"" noise but it's hard to tell without hearing it. Since your pig is new it may take awhile to get comfortable.  Eventually you will be able to tell when they are sleeping and then avoid startling them, but they get startled easily so don't worry about it. They run for cover at pretty much any loud noise or sudden movement. Just move slowly and be gentle and everything will be good!"
guineapigs,3dbv6z,Cal1gula,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:20:41 2015 UTC,"Often he startles when he's walking around though.  Sometimes when he does his purr, he seems to lay down and almost try to show his belly? That's usually when I'm petting him."

If yes, that's popcorning and it's a sign of a happy, excited pig :)  Sounds like your little guy is totally normal and just getting used to his new home. Do get him a companion, though! He'll thank you for a buddy. Just do a little Google to find out how best to introduce them, and remember that you need at least 8 square feet of cage to keep two guinea pigs happy!"

guineapigs,3dbv6z,Quaeras,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:45:20 2015 UTC,It depends on who you ask. I think age is less important than finding the right combination of personalities--which is easier than it sounds. Just make VERY SURE that you're introducing two pigs of the same gender ;)
guineapigs,3dbl83,flame_in_darkness,3,Wed Jul 15 00:24:11 2015 UTC,"I think guinea pigs are more work than dogs.

guineapigs,3dbl83,i_am_ms_greenjeans,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:34:13 2015 UTC,"My family has a dog and four guinea pigs.  I would say that initially a dog is a bigger expense due to all the shots and puppy-wellness check-ups needed and puppy training.  Guinea Pigs also start out expensive, especially if you are constructing a C & C cage.  There is a huge learning curve, and I strongly encourage you to read the information listed on guinealynx.  Pigs can be time consuming, but if you have them in pairs or more, they're independent little critters.  Their diet is simple - timothy hay, food pellets & fresh veggies.

I have one pig (he had a brother who passed away and he doesn't get along with other pigs) in a 3 grid C&C cage put on top of two dressers so I don't lose storage space.  I spend about 3 minutes cleaning their cage before work and after work.  The cage bedding is fleece so I just use a dust pan and brush to sweep them up, then put his 'furniture' back.  Once a week when he's out on the floor we wash the fleece, takes about 40 minutes (we watch tv while this is happening) and another fifteen to disassemble and reassemble the fleece flippers.   (http://www.guineapigmarket.com/fleece-flippers)  He probably eats about $14 worth of hay and maybe one $10 bag of dry food a month.  Then he gets our leftover dinner veggies (uncooked I mean).  We primarily switch up giving him romaine or green leaf lettuce, cucumber, carrot, but mostly the lettuce. Sometimes he'll get a slice of fruit etc.   Usually if my wife and I stay in for the night I'll put him on the floor to run around and explore.  I have a couple designated guinea pig towels i put down and make a small pillow fort on top of, so he'll do his business there.   We scatter pieces of lettuce or slices of carrot across the living room so while we're watching a movie or tv show he's getting exercise running around foraging for food.  It's a lot of fun to watch and fairly easy entertainment for him.   We just shake out the towel each night.   He's five and a half and seems as spry as ever!"
guineapigs,3dc2zu,Project_Leda,3,Wed Jul 15 02:44:48 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you're frustrated by your pigs lack of affection.  Does your Mom tend to give the little critter more delicious snacks than you?  I know my family's pigs (we have four of them) all respond to my voice because I'm the one giving them food.
guineapigs,3dc2zu,i_am_ms_greenjeans,3,Wed Jul 15 02:53:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if she does, because she takes care of her when I'm not home, but I'll definitely try to give her treats while talking to her so she'll associate my voice with food!"
guineapigs,3dc2zu,i_am_ms_greenjeans,2,Wed Jul 15 02:56:33 2015 UTC,Most pigs are food motivated.  Just do your best to offer them some tasty treats when you're around.  It might take a long time since your time with them is limited.  Good luck!

Try not to take it personally OP, I know how upsetting it is but some pigs just don't seem to warm up to being picked up regardless of how much they're handled. I've had two now that were handled daily or almost daily that never got over that, even though they're great during lap time and otherwise friendly and loving."

guineapigs,3d9t7n,Pignamedpig,4,Tue Jul 14 16:51:46 2015 UTC,"Sounds about how my bath times go. I'd say use a lower basin in the bath tub, let them walk in and out if they'd like. Mine is a 3 inch high kitten litter box. I keep them in the basin mostly for washing the tummy, for their back I scoop water over it anyway. They're not gonna enjoy it, so try to be quick about it. Unless you're doing a bonding bath, best to wash one at a time so they're in there less time. Then bribe with veggies after. My sweetest pig held a grudge against me for a whole day after his last bath :( would not come to me when called at all... It was a sad sad day..."

guineapigs,3d9t7n,FrolickingBeans,2,Tue Jul 14 17:52:27 2015 UTC,"When mine were little I would wash them in the sink, but that also ended in a suicidal dive toward the floor. She was okay, but I washed them in the tub from then on. I don't use a wash basin. I just run a couple inches of water in the tub and let the tap run while I'm washing them. They hate it, but sometimes it's necessary. They try to dunk each other. Hahaha. But I just wash them and hold them under the running water to rinse them. I usually only give a bath about every 6 months or if they are particularly stinky."
guineapigs,3d9t7n,Kahlia29,2,Fri Jul 17 05:43:52 2015 UTC,"I've done everything from the wash basins (same horrible experience), to washing them in the kitchen sink (they always escape), taking showers with them (they get too cold by the end), washing them in the bathroom sinks (clogs the sinks and they escape). The best thing so far has been when I was able to wash them in my mom's large sink in the basement. The kind with the really high sides that people usually have in their creepy old basements and wash old paint brushes out in. Seriously, the pigs couldn't jump out and the thing never clogged.  The house I'm in now doesn't have a nice sink like that, so I just wash them in the kitchen sink, one at a time. I hold them in my left arm, hand on their bottoms, and soap them up with my right hand (I'm right handed). That way, when I am washing their tummies I have my hand on their entire spine and I can keep them calm. I never wash their heads. Just from their necks down. I always start with their tummies since that is when they are the fussiest. In the winter I very, very, VERY carefully blow dry them. You have to be careful not to burn them. It takes me a long time since I have three male pigs and they all get their poop pouches checked each time.  You'll just have to keep trying different things and see what works for you. I kinda gave up on bathing mine for now. It's been pretty hot here and I've come to realize that peeing on themselves seems to be a way to keep themselves cool. The second I bathe them they just pee all over again, so it's not worth it."
guineapigs,3d9t7n,horriblenoises,2,Tue Jul 14 17:33:29 2015 UTC,"So sorry you had a rough experience with bathing, it's rarely pleasant.  Like you did, my wife and I usually wash our pigs two at a time, it's a good idea because it supposedly helps bond them. The trick to keeping things under control is to have someone help you, if you can. One person focusing on the bathing, one keeping an eye (and non slippery hands) on any escape attempts. We've bathed them in the sink, which we no longer do because of escape attempts, but we've had better luck doing it on the floor of the tub or the floor of the shower using a separate bowl for warm soapy water. That way they can't jump and hurt themselves, however it still helps to have someone corralling them.  Don't forget to dry thoroughly, especially if you have a longhair, it can take quite a while to dry our texel.  EDIT: clarity"
guineapigs,3d9t7n,BaconTender,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:34:28 2015 UTC,"I've put mine in my bathroom sink to wash her. I'll plug up the sink and let the water fill to about her chin length. She seems to like the water so she'll splash around a bit and get all wheeky. I'll get her fur wet and use pig shampoo if needed, then unplug and let the faucet flow slowly at a lukewarm temperature, and she'll go right under it so I can rinse her off. She's pretty old for a piggy, so I think she's kinda into the routine of bathtime. I consider myself lucky she's so good with this. Now, if she could only be so cooperative for nail clipping...."

I have a towel I put them on next to the sink for when I need to put them down and get the shampoo so they dont have to sit in the water.

guineapigs,3d7tr0,GuapoWithAGun,7,Tue Jul 14 04:43:30 2015 UTC,"Let's talk hamsters for a second. The exercise wheels recommended by pet stores are usually too small, you have to go a bit bigger. A good rule of thumb is the diameter should be a little bigger than twice their stretched out length. So even a tiny little dwarf hamster needs a 6 inch wheel or they will get debilitating back problems that will slow them down and pain them for the rest of their lives. So I don't know why they even sell 4 inch wheels... When people say piggies can't use wheels, it's the same reason that hamsters can't use small wheels, back problems. The only difference is that if you look hard enough, you'll find a 6 inch to 12 inch wheel for your hamster. That's why people stress much more that piggies should not use wheels; there is no commercial wheel big enough to accommodate them. If you feel like building a two foot diameter or larger wheel with solid flooring for your pig and can train it to use the wheel, then by all means, do it. (Emphasis on the solid flooring because piggy feet are too sensitive for running on mesh flooring seen in a lot of metal wheels.) My largest pig is 14 inches long, I'd need quite a big wheel... At that point I'd rather just let him out to run around...  Edit: also guinea pigs don't have the same need for running as hamster do, hamsters might get distraught or even depressed if they can't run through the night, but piggies won't. So even if you give them a properly large wheel, chances are slim they'll run on it the way hamsters do."

Next week the vet had to put him down.  The other had lumps all over her body for months but didnt seem to care. Plenty of other health issues though. After her cage mate, previously mentioned, died it all went very quickly.  So basically, as long as it doesnt grow the pig will probably last months or years more. Being an old pig, it might die of age before anything else.  Guinea pigs are fragile and short lived animals, sadly. Every owner should accept that.

For awhile I made litter boxes out of coroplast and dropped them in one side of the cage. Since pigs poop where they eat, it's worked out for the most part.

I also washed and dried the fleece three times before putting it in their cage, is that enough times? I am also wondering if there are any tips or advice anyone has for me? The cage is a little bare right now but I'm going to be getting a new holder for hay, toys, etc. Is there anything else I should add to the shopping list? Thanks so much in advance."
guineapigs,3d2s2j,Pignamedpig,2,Mon Jul 13 01:50:34 2015 UTC,"You can always test the fleece to make sure it wicks prior to using it.  I found some fleece (usually the patterned ones) takes more than three washings with soap & vinegar to get them to wick properly.  Before my pigs graduated to a larger cage, I used towels underneath the fleece liner and it worked fine."
guineapigs,3d2s2j,i_am_ms_greenjeans,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:55:05 2015 UTC,"Some of my fleece patterns have taken like 8 runs through the washer to wick, ugh. Others take 2. I drop some water on it to test it."
guineapigs,3d2s2j,i_am_ms_greenjeans,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:22:32 2015 UTC,I know when I was prepping some fleece a few months ago I washed the plain fleece three times with a mild laundry detergent & vinegar but the patterned fleece took an additional three washings before it wicked properly.  It can be a bit frustrating.
guineapigs,3d2s2j,i_am_ms_greenjeans,2,Wed Jul 15 13:40:00 2015 UTC,"As far as toys are concerned - you can make some stuff for them out of fleece (I made a tent and some fleece snuggle bags).  They like to climb in and out of boxes, just be sure to cut extra entrance/exit holes."
guineapigs,3d2s2j,holyshitsnackss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:58:55 2015 UTC,Cool. Thanks. Guinea pigs are the funnest. I'm irdering a new proper cage too. The one I have is quit big but it's homemade so I've wanted a new one for a while. The one I have is 4 by 2 feet. I want one with a kitchen area for shavings.
guineapigs,3d2s2j,i_am_ms_greenjeans,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"We used to dread cage cleaning day in this household because cleaning their old cages was a lot of work.  It's so much easier cleaning the C & C cage and the pigs are happier, too.  What's nice is we can always add to it, where expansion is more of a challenge with a typical pet store cage.  Our upper level is the messy level but the mess doesn't filter down much to the lower level, and it's great not having Timothy Hay everywhere.  Good luck with your new cage!  Very exciting!"
guineapigs,3d2s2j,Enceys,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:47:00 2015 UTC,"Hi, I have the same bedding system for my pigs but I use 2 layers of fleece to make sure that the pee is wicked away and does not dampen the first layer as it soaks into the towels to avoid wet bums and urine burns. I tuck the fleece in around and under the towels, but that's just my personal preference as my boys like to try to dig in the corners and it gets a bit messy.  If you're new to fleece and find that it starts to smell even after washing, put a little pet safe disinfectant in the fabric conditioner drawer when washing. You have washed it correctly for first time use and it should wick pee away fine.  As for adding toys, a cardboard box with a couple of holes makes for hours of fun!  I've never had much luck with hay holders and have much more success with a litter tray lined with newspaper and a big pile of hay. They love burrowing and sleeping in there as they munch and it avoids getting hay allover the fleece.  I love your pigs, they're so adorable!"

guineapigs,3d0pkz,jennyinthetardis,3,Sun Jul 12 18:34:10 2015 UTC,I have a jumper specially dedicated to guinea cuddles so the pee no longer bothers me. Though it would be nice if they didn't. And if they could just stop pooping for 10 minutes.
guineapigs,3d0pkz,is2gstop,8,Sun Jul 12 19:55:12 2015 UTC,My favorite guinea actually had good bladder control. She'd get fussy when she wanted to pee and would make a little squeak noise when let back into her cage to piddle. She'd then nose-up in the air asking for cuddles again.  Damn I miss my little Cheery. She had a seizure and passed. :'(  Favorite piggie ever... she'd nap on my neck and purr while I watched TV. Didn't even need to be petted to purr. She'd just purr sitting in my lap.
guineapigs,3d0pkz,cultured_banana_slug,5,Sun Jul 12 20:26:20 2015 UTC,"Aww. My favourite little piggie used to curl up on his side down on my stomach and stare at me, then pat his foot if he needed to pee. He used to climb up onto my shoulder too and watch TV from there - he'd squeak if someone stood in his way so he couldn't see or we changed channel from Doctor Who...  Then you could set him down and he'd scamper off to explore the house and you'd hear the tiny pitter pat of his feet. If you called his name he'd come charging back to you to see what was up.  Plus if you'd open his hutch door he'd jump out and scuttle across the floor and over the doorway, down the stairs and out into the garden.  I love my other piggies, but Phineas was so clever and special I don't think I'll ever move on from him dying, especially as it came out of nowhere üòñ"

guineapigs,3cx5aq,TeslaDelMar,3,Sat Jul 11 15:42:28 2015 UTC,"It is possible for a pig to get a ""hay poke."" There isn't much you can do to keep a popping pig out of a hay pile! The eye will naturally try to push any foreign object out and then heal itself. It is also possible for a tiny hayseed to get stuck between the eyeball and lid, causing inflammation and fluid secretion. A vet is much better equipped to safely remove the object with minimal infection risk. Usually you'll get some antibacterial eye drops and in a week or two the eye will be back to normal. If it happens don't panic because it looks unpleasant, just perform common sense cleaning of the area to limit further damage and get to a vet ASAP."

Things were tense at first but introduce them on neutral territory (takes about 3 hours) and as long they aren't fighting or biting at one another it should be okay. I find that my baby pig treats my big pig like she's her mother. They get along quite well now, they even sleep next to each other during the day"
guineapigs,3czzmh,mermaidkitten5395,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:00:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about Helga, it always stinks to lose a puff.  I'll echo the recommendation about neutral ground.  Set out a towel playpen on the floor and have plenty of things to do, houses to go in, and noms to munch on.  Then be there with them to ensure that they don't fight.  But one thing I will add is that you'll definitely need a temporary cage for the new piggy.  Coming to a new home is stress enough for a puff, don't heap making a new friend on top of that.  Give the new little one several days to a week to adjust to you and the new house and routine, then try the play date."
guineapigs,3czzmh,ShpadoinkleyDay,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:30:12 2015 UTC,Ladypig introductions are usually pretty low-stress. Introduce them somewhere neutral like your bed or the bathroom floor and they should be fine. There might be some rumblestrutting or mounting. Sorry for your loss!
guineapigs,3czzmh,sprinklenoms,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:37:22 2015 UTC,"In addition, remember the quarantine. 4 weeks is a commonly suggested period.   Unless you get the new one from a breeder you trust and know 100%, you should always keep them seperated to wait out any potential signs of illness. Pet stores are quite known for spreading lice or fungal infections. And now you even have a mystery ailment from your previous pig, which might well be still going on with your second pig."

guineapigs,3cu2c8,Pignamedpig,3,Fri Jul 10 19:52:31 2015 UTC,I have a hay dispenser that you load from the top and then they have a little tray at the bottom to eat from. You'd think that would solve the issue but they prefer pulling the hay out and then eating from the floor. So I still end up with a pile of pee and poop covered hay that I end up having to throw out..  Hopefully you have better luck! haha
guineapigs,3cu2c8,adultabortion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:30:54 2015 UTC,It seems to be working alright so far! The problem with the other one was that hay fell right out the bottom and that can't happen with this one.

When I was bonding pair before I added a third, they were fighting too much. I just plopped them in the tub, let them walk around a bit. They left each other alone in the bath, actually came up to each other nicely because they were concerned the floor was water all of a sudden. Washing them helped neutralize their funk too, so once I dried them off together, they were less hostile."

I still have his brother, Zuko, who was never as snugly and a new pig who was billed as shy but is turning out to be very feisty. You may have to accept that your pig is not the snuggle type and find a different way to interact with her. Zuko complains incessantly when being held, but loves to play with me on the floor. I get on my knees and elbows to make myself into a tunnel; he loves to run over my arms and ankles and under my stomach. It's even better if I drape a blanket over my back because then he can tunnel around my sides.   Try interacting with your pig on her level and let her approach you, it may not be the snuggles you want but it can be pretty fun."

guineapigs,3cl8aq,krirsten93,8,Wed Jul 8 19:52:47 2015 UTC,"3/3 of our pigs do this. Guinea pigs are coprophagic--they eat their own poopy. It helps maintain stable gut flora and improves nutrient absorption. From GuineaLynx:   Coprophagy (eating the soft cecal feces) is vital to the good health of all guinea pigs as it provides them with necessary nutrients. Guinea pigs may eat the soft cecal feces 150 to 200 times in a day, usually directly from the anus. If an animal is obese or pregnant, these soft droppings may be expelled and eaten from the floor. Very young guinea pigs may also eat their mother's soft droppings. Some guinea pigs have been known to snatch cecal feces from other pigs. These feces are supposedly the best ones to feed a sick guinea pig on antibiotics in order to reinoculate good bacteria into the digestive system. The drier fecal pellets are also used but do not contain as many beneficial bacteria."

guineapigs,3chc9a,i_am_ms_greenjeans,2,Wed Jul 8 08:00:59 2015 UTC,"Well, the floor of their home is actually a giant outdoor floor rug, so it's made to wipe off wet feet and has a thick rubber bottom. So it soaks up the pee and is easy to clean; I just take it outside and hose it off. Also, they definitely prefer to pee in the cage attached that has bedding.   As far as the baseboard goes, they seem to have no interest in chewing on them, they never really have. However, I do plan on getting some coroplast to cover the baseboards."

I went to cutting out all the pockets in the pair of pants (which happened to be a lot) and then cut the scraps up to use for something else. All I had to do with cut 2 holes in the lower part of the pocket and 2 holes at the top to tie it (bonus: the string is from the pants as well!).   If you have an old pair of cotton pants that you're going to throw out, cut out the pockets to make toys for your pigs instead!"

(But if it does get bad do take your pig to the vet, I only treated a small issue before it got bad.) My boy got weekly baths in special shampoo -- I don't remember the name but something like cocoaneem and it was made for guinea pigs, and I also put some anti fungal and antibacterial creams on the infected spots but then wrapped a bandage (not the sticky kind, just some gauze that was secured with some medical tape - you don't want to rip their fur out) so that he wouldn't scratch any more or eat any of the cream. Just read up which creams do and don't work though, and check in on your pig to make sure he or she isn't eating the bandage. If it doesn't start getting better though definitely take them into the vet! I noticed improvement in a week or so but if it gets worse don't wait and think that it will just take some time. Best of luck!"

My doctor has informed me over and over again that their diet should be pellets and hay. You can give them leafy greens every once in a while. (Once a day).  The hay is for nutrients and it also trims their teeth down for them.  I would make sure you have some wood toys (pet store), make you have plenty of hay, and make sure you add in some hay toys as well."

guineapigs,3cdjr4,Sebazzz91,0,Tue Jul 7 03:51:45 2015 UTC,"Lots of grain and hard pieces in the food can help keeping the teeth at the correct length. But even then, if you have some inbred guinea pig it may be that the teeth grow too long because of that. Especially if the guinea pig is bred for that it has a small pointy nose.

guineapigs,3c94yo,Ephemeral_Halcyon,12,Mon Jul 6 01:46:23 2015 UTC,"That is why they are fighting. Big time. You might try having a look into C&C style cages. Two pigs should have at least 1 square meter, or 2x4 C&C grids. Preferrably even a little larger or with a ramp up to a small second loft.   There should also be enough hidey spots for the two of them. An igloo for each, a fleecey hide for each. Enough chewy things for both. I'd suggest two food bowls as well and a hanging hay feeder so that they hay isn't down in their bedding/excrement."

You can always add the loft later should you choose to, as well! The entire site is pretty cool, and they have some really neat options (like the new cubby system so the cage is lifted off the ground but still offers storage instead of making the cage area a dead space in the room)."
guineapigs,3c94yo,Ephemeral_Halcyon,2,Mon Jul 6 15:18:59 2015 UTC,Thats the move - thanks.
guineapigs,3c94yo,Ephemeral_Halcyon,2,Mon Jul 6 15:27:40 2015 UTC,"So I have another question, my girlfriend and I decided to get  the 2x4 cage, as it fits in our apartment. Now in terms of everything else, will we need two houses, two water bottles, two hay feeders, two pellet things? Pretty much two of everything?"
guineapigs,3c94yo,Pignamedpig,5,Mon Jul 6 15:52:12 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily 2 of everything, but it depends on the pigs. It's good to have 2 ""hideys"" (igloo, wooden or hay hut, etc.) so they can get away from each other when they want to. If they fight over food, 2 food bowls are a good idea, but a lot of people use 1 big bowl for multiple pigs. For my 2 girls I have 2 igloos and 2 food bowls, and when I give veggies it's always in 2 separate bowls because they will fight over it if not. I only have 1 hay rack and it's never a problem. Usually they each go to one side and don't bother each other. I have 2 water bottles, but they both mostly use 1 of them so I might take the other one out.  By the way I'm so glad you're getting a bigger cage! The one you have now is actually small even for 1. I'm sure your pigs will appreciate having space to run around and play, and also to get away when they get annoyed with each other."
guineapigs,3c94yo,MyHorseIsAmazinger,2,Mon Jul 6 16:23:38 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that you need two of everything on the feeding. It's just that what you have needs to be easily accessible by both pigs. I use a bin feeder like this that would work great for one pig to be eating out of each side-- it also holds plenty so that there is no competition for limited food resources. I love love LOVE the bin feeder-- she can't knock it over or get anything but food in it. For hay, something like this or like this would be nice so that, again, one pig can eat at either side.   For hides, the main thing is to just offer them plenty. The igloo that you have is really only large enough for one pig. There is a longer ""rabbit"" igloo that would hold two pigs a little better. There are also wicker hides, cuddle cups, fleece cubes/triangles/igloos/sacks.   One water bottle would be fine, two would be better. My girl drinks a TON, but I'm not sure if all guine pigs really do. I use a 64 oz bottle and have to refill it every two days. So I think two 32 oz or 2 64 oz situated on opposite sides of the eating area might be nice for them."
guineapigs,3c94yo,Zukazuk,2,Mon Jul 6 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"Okay so I ordered the 2x4 cage and it should come 2-3 days I believe, what can I do in the meantime to minimize the fighting while Im asleep or something?"
guineapigs,3c99b7,sprinklenoms,3,Mon Jul 6 02:14:31 2015 UTC,They might get a little rambunctious but i doubt anything bad will come if it. Just remember to keep they cages away from each other because things can still happen through the bars.   Is her male pig neutered? If not it's already too late
guineapigs,3c99b7,MyHorseIsAmazinger,2,Mon Jul 6 03:35:13 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure if they'd go nuts from being able to smell her and start fighting. Nope, he's not neutered. She intends to let them have and keep one litter, separate the boy while she's pregnant, have him neutered and then re-introduce once the babies are raised and separated or neutered."
guineapigs,3c99b7,Svataben,2,Mon Jul 6 03:47:55 2015 UTC,"They might start fighting, yes. It isn't 100% sure, but it's a big possibility.  Also, you'll likely get the ""pleasure"" of experiencing boy-pig stink bombs. Basically, when they smell a hot female, they can make this really big smell quite quickly.   It smells like concentrated guinea pig farts, and has the Axe effect. Just like when teenage boys shower in some Axe product and expect to be hawt for the girls only to be ignored, so will the stinking guinea pig dude be disappointed. (My females have always seemed to unimpressed.)   She has a younger male and female who also live together, they're about 3 months.   Is she planning on having babies? Because that'll happen."
guineapigs,3c99b7,Svataben,2,Mon Jul 6 17:00:28 2015 UTC,That sounds disgusting. Guinea pigs are gross. I still love them though. Thanks for the heads up.    Is she planning on having babies?    She wants to have one litter and then fix the boy and any boy babies and separate them into a couple of herds.
guineapigs,3c99b7,ThatGuysGirl,3,Mon Jul 6 18:22:30 2015 UTC,"Guinea pigs really are gross sometimes. Oh, the poop-eating... XD  But it's great to know she has a plan, and isn't doing the irresponsible thing."

guineapigs,3c6fbq,lady_nerd,3,Sun Jul 5 07:26:53 2015 UTC,"Sounds like eye trouble from a piece of straw. Had that happen with a piggy at a previous place I worked.  Visit a vet. He'll likely give you some eye drops you have to give your pig.  If you do things carefully, the chance that this will leave  permanent harm is small."
guineapigs,3c6fbq,I_ABUSED_YOUR_CHAIR,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:20:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely go to a vet as soon as possible - this could be a pretty serious problem.  In the mean time, if you have any unmedicated eyedrops (visene or the like) you can give your piggy a couple.  This can help to flush out anything that might be stuck in there, but you will probably need antibiotic drops as well."
guineapigs,3c4vbs,NutellaSwirl,2,Sat Jul 4 20:24:37 2015 UTC,"You have to hold them to get them used to getting handled and to trust that you wont eat them. My advice is to get a towel wrap the piggie in it and just hold it in your lap talking to it and petting or just sit with it during floor time and it will eventually start getting used to you. Unfortunately Piggies are still kind of wild so they have a lot of instinct telling them not to trust us, just give it time and eventually it'll warm up to you."
guineapigs,3c4vbs,Hep-Cat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:34:05 2015 UTC,How do you recommend going about wrapping them? Mine bucks and squeals if anything comes up around from under her.
guineapigs,3c4vbs,Smiley007,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:07:10 2015 UTC,The simplest way is to pick her up like you would at any other time. Just wrap your hand around her little tummy and use your other hand to support her feet and gently place them on a blanket or towel and swaddle them up
guineapigs,3c4vbs,Hep-Cat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:57:35 2015 UTC,There is nothing simple about the simplest way with my small hands and very skittish piggy. Thanks for the insight!
guineapigs,3c4vbs,Smiley007,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:05:54 2015 UTC,"I used to scoop mine up by putting a hand under its bum and sort of having him step up onto my hand, then reaching around to his front paws and doing the same, then lifting fairly slowly. It got to the point where he'd beg to be picked up and hold still whenever I went into his cage, and he didn't care if I scooped him fairly fast, he got used to the routine.  Of course, the promise of carrots and a good petting probably helped.  Just be sure to support its feet, go slowly, and if it runs away don't force it."
guineapigs,3c4vbs,boredcanadian,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:01:45 2015 UTC,"My guinea pigs are used to getting picked up. Approx. a week after they came to my house I just started picking them up. But remember that every guinea pig is different, some are brave some aren't. Just remember to go slow so they don't feel like they have been taken by a bird. Keep them in your lap and give them something they like. And after a while they will feel safe."
guineapigs,3c4vbs,callecalzone,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:04:02 2015 UTC,"It helped me that after I caught my piggy I would put her in a hat and have her sit in my lap as I pet her and gave her a few . She still doesn't like being picked up, but she loves to cuddle once she's out now."

Not all guinea pigs will get along with a second one and it just causes more stress. Also someone is always home with Ruby, it's all about the interaction with them which we do lots with her."

He had full roam of my floor in my room in my student house. He loved it. After a few years he was his own character, he didn't need a piggy friend, I was his piggy friend."

guineapigs,3c06vc,JReedNet,9,Fri Jul 3 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"I know seizures are scary to watch, but don't restrain her or try to snap her out of them - it's a very dangerous thing to do and can cause significant injury. Many animals (and people!) continue to live happy and otherwise healthy lives despite the fact they have seizures, so maybe call up your vet and ask if it's worth treating."

They should only last a few seconds- but like with humans, do not restrain her just let it happen (but prevent her from falling from to steep a height!). Has she been on any medications lately? I know first hand that Ivermectin is one that can cause seizures as a side effect. Most definitely call up your vet, if anything to help calm your nerves. :)"
guineapigs,3c06vc,attackofdameepits,2,Sat Jul 4 02:44:27 2015 UTC,"I very briefly had a younger pig with a seizure disorder that was probably due to his neurological damage and head tilt from an untreated ear infection in infancy. I didn't know he had seizures until I brought him home. He had a seizure the first night he was home and was very sluggish after, so I took him to the emergency vet and they told me they had no idea what was wrong or how to fix it and he needed to be euthanized on the spot.   When I talked to my coworkers who had cared for him (I got him from the pet store where I worked), I found out that the seizures were scary but not harmful to him, and that he always snapped out of the sluggishness within a couple hours, per multiple vet visits when he was a baby.   I agree with the other poster that you shouldn't touch her while she's having a seizure, and give her space while she's recovering. She is old and she'll likely live out the rest of her life comfortably as a pig who has seizures sometimes. I wish I had left my pig to recover overnight and taken him to my normal vet the next day.   I would take her to the vet for an opinion, but please make sure it's a vet who has experience with small exotics and preferably guinea pigs and/or senior small pets."

If they weren't specialized then I would maybe make a call to someone who is. If you truly don't feel right about it listen to your gut it can't hurt to get a second opinion. Maybe it could save your piggy
guineapigs,3bxt5k,AsianInvasion113,3,Fri Jul 3 02:45:45 2015 UTC,"She's a rather cavy savy vet, yeah. I went during normal business hours, too - just called ahead saying I had an emergency and they took me right away. It's also a vet school teaching clinic, so they tend to look at animals in teams and I've had nothing but good experiences there (they did the neuters on my boars, so I trust them a lot). It just sounds kind of funny to me. Do you have any thoughts or opinions on the matter?  I'm just hesitant to shell out another $350 dollars for the same tests and diagnosis, you know? I can do it if I need to, but she definitely doesn't look like she's in any sort of danger, just kind of uncomfortable. I've told myself I'm giving it another week, as 2 weeks seems to be pretty adequate time to see any changes, and I'm going to call them if she doesn't look better."
guineapigs,3bxt5k,AsianInvasion113,2,Fri Jul 3 02:54:02 2015 UTC,Maybe she'll perk up soon. I think it's reasonable to wait two weeks. She should be ok as long as she's eating and drinking. I hope she gets better it sucks when your piggies are feeling 100%
guineapigs,3bxt5k,sopwath,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:09:50 2015 UTC,"How old is your pig? My male pig, Blaze, is pushing 6 years old and he does something similar sometimes. He gets vitamin C in his water to supplement what he gets from fruits and veggies.  He has arthritis, especially  in his front left leg, so he will lie down on his right side and has visible difficulty moving. It's worse in the fall and winter, but it looks likes lol the muscle tone in his back is basically gone when it acts up. We give him some pain medication and he usually snaps back in a day or two.  if your female is still eating, it might be better to check for joint pain or maybe a digestion issue (did they see hair in her intestines in that CT?) more than vitamin C deficiency."
guineapigs,3bxt5k,is2gstop,2,Fri Jul 3 03:42:11 2015 UTC,"She's about 3.5 years old, so maybe it is just a joint issue like arthritis? I didn't see the CT myself, but they said it was textbook perfect, so I doubt it was anything like hair. I've been giving her a unit of BeneBac a day just in case it is a gut issue."

They have lots of good info on their site and are really helpful in answering questions.   They have a ""meet and greet"" once a month or so where your guinea pig can meet other guinea pigs to find a friend that they get along with. The first two GPs did NOT like my little guy. The third was much more receptive. And now they are getting along great!"

guineapigs,3bt6a1,atacub,7,Wed Jul 1 23:03:51 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear about Opie.  Guinea Pigs are excellent at hiding their illnesses, so it's very likely he had a problem but hid it from you.  Try not to be too hard on yourself.  When you are ready to try again, I encourage you to find a new pig.  There are many out there looking for the type of home you provided Opie, and they'll be happy you adopted them."
guineapigs,3bt6a1,i_am_ms_greenjeans,4,Thu Jul 2 00:58:02 2015 UTC,Sorry for your guys loss. Even though you had your piggy for a short time I'm sure you guys gave him lots of love and did what you could for him. It's not your fault. I hope you find more piggy love in the future and remember the time you had with Opie.
guineapigs,3bt6a1,nomorenoobtube,3,Thu Jul 2 00:28:41 2015 UTC,Im so sorry. I couldnt imagine losing my lil guy. Hes all I have in the world.   :/
guineapigs,3bt6a1,GrilledChilledCheese,4,Thu Jul 2 01:18:57 2015 UTC,"hugs  I'm sorry, losing a pig is a horrible feeling.  I'm sure Opie would be thankful for having you as a loving owner.  There are thousands if not tens of thousands of guinea pigs that aren't as lucky as Opie and end up in aquariums or hamster cages without proper nutrition, and while sad, it's important to keep in mind that all in all Opie had it pretty good for the last 16 days.  I'm glad you want to get another pig and will be even more vigilant, but if Opie went from being healthy to not in such a short time frame there's very little the vet could have done in my humble opinion.  I've nursed a couple pigs back to health (with the Vet's help of course) and seen two leave me too soon, and while taking them to the vet ASAP always increases their chances, this sounds like Opie's time was up and you didn't do anything wrong.  I hope you can be proud of the 16 great days you gave Opie and eventually look forward to sharing your time with another guinea pig in the future."
guineapigs,3bt6a1,S1LENCE,2,Thu Jul 2 01:21:23 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry about Opie, he was a beautiful piggy. Don't be too hard on yourselves, it happened so fast."
guineapigs,3bt6a1,Abyssinius,2,Wed Jul 1 23:09:20 2015 UTC,"It's not your fault. I've tried to rescue a few animals and owned a piggy that lived for a while, and I think they know when they're dying. They stop eating and quietly lie in place. Prey animals are programmed to die quickly as to not suffer so it's not your fault."
guineapigs,3bt6a1,ExcuseMyTourettes,2,Thu Jul 2 02:44:34 2015 UTC,I just lost two piggies a week ago from a heat stroke. Was he brought outside in the sun for a period of time prior to the incident? It was a horrible feeling losing both of them at once so I know how you feel
guineapigs,3bt6a1,Pignamedpig,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:52:18 2015 UTC,"No, it was like a day or two after we let him out for the first time. I'm so sorry about your piggies. Maybe our guinea pigs are friends right now in heaven. I can't imagine how you feel, do you plan on eventually getting more? I don't think I am anytime soon, I need to recover for a while. I hope you feel better, they're happy and okay wherever they are ‚ù§Ô∏è"
guineapigs,3bt6a1,AsianInvasion113,2,Thu Jul 2 06:08:07 2015 UTC,Pigs are pros at hiding illnesses so this wasn't your fault. Poor piggy I'm sorry :(
guineapigs,3bt6a1,Girlmeetsminecraft,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:12:22 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry. I know how it feels to lose a piggy. First sign mine wasn't eating I brought him to the vet. A nearly $200 bill later he still ended up dying in my hands while we tried to syringe feed him. Sometimes there's just nothing you can do. It's not your fault. It's does get easier with time. Six months after I lost my Oreo I got my current piggy Gizmo. It was bittersweet since I just wanted Oreo but Gizmo really helped me fill the little hole in my heart that only piggies seem to fill. I hope things get better soon <3

guineapigs,3bu7zy,Pignamedpig,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:13:58 2015 UTC,Aww poor peeg :( Once the antibiotics start to work your piggy should start feeling better. Could be a couple days.

Took about 2 weeks for us to get him back, and it turned out the rest of the pig litter at the store had it once we pointed it out. The vet said it was conjectivitis. Basically an eye infection. Piggies get sick very quickly though and cant handle most infections so i would get it treated as fast as possible."
guineapigs,3bu7zy,L00k_Again,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"Within a couple of days of bringing home our first two pigs one had a similar eye issue. I gently wiped the eye with a warm, wet cloth on a few occassions, watched for a couple of days, totally improved on its own. If it hadn't improved in a few days we'd have seen a vet. No issues since, so hopefully this is it for you."

Even more surprising with Flash is that we almost lost her twice to pnuemonia when she was a baby & now the poor thing has a fairly large lipoma on her shoulder ( the one leaning against the bottle) & a few more much smaller ones scattered about.  But both my vet & I are of the opinion that if she's happy, eating & doesn't seem bothered by them to leave well alone, especially due to the fact that her lungs are probably compromised after the pneumonia & she really wouldn't survive any surgery.

Use an old bed sheet or lightweight material with binder clips to hold it in place.  It will reassure him, and hopefully give him confidence to move about his confines.  Give him some things to play with/in.  Shoe boxes, card board boxes, oatmeal containers, etc.  Nothing fancy because he's outside.

guineapigs,3bogmj,SCVannevar,2,Tue Jun 30 21:18:51 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, there's no easy way. You have to be a bit forceful, even though you feel awful doing it. Merlin, my previous pig, had to be syringe fed for a bit after an operation. At first he refused, but I managed to get him to lick it off a plate but I knew that I needed to be more forceful with him. What I did was, sit him on his bottom on the table so that he had the feeling of solid ground under him and then hold him against my body so he couldn't wiggle too much and that his head was up. Then I put the syringe in his mouth so that he had to bite on it, then slowly depressed the syringe. Fortunately he decided he liked the critical care so it became quite easy to feed him as he'd just sit there and enjoy...he used to come running to the front of the cage whenever I went over to collect him for his feeding. Odd piggie."
guineapigs,3bogmj,sherlock2040,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:57:53 2015 UTC,"I actually don't use the towel method, but do place one on my lap because syringe feeding gets messy. I put my pig on my lap with their butt facing my belly so they can't scoot away. I lean in and basically block them off from turning one way with my body and hold their head by the jaw firmly with my hand, using my arm to block off the other direction. After a few tries, I can usually get the syringe in.  The more you do it, the more you'll figure out your own method that works for the two of you, and your pigs will start to realize that if they cooperate, it's less pain for both of you. Also offer treats afterwards to get any bad taste out of their mouth!"

guineapigs,3bnq7g,i_am_ms_greenjeans,2,Tue Jun 30 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"My pigs are slobs, which is why we now have a separate ""messy"" area on the 2nd level of the cage.  That level has a kitty litter box which is where the timothy hay bag is located, there are water bottles and one food dish that attaches to the side of the cage (I would say it prevents them from pooping in it because it's raised up, but one of my crafty pigs is pooping in it), and we have one more ceramic food dish on the lower level.  If you don't have one, find a nice, heavy, ceramic food dish for the dry food.  It will help prevent spills."
guineapigs,3bnq7g,i_am_ms_greenjeans,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, with the savings it was harder to move her piggy furnishings around and now with the fleece she's moving things around to play with them and pooping everywhere. I guess the shavings hid it more."
guineapigs,3bnq7g,smattie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:41:11 2015 UTC,"We used shavings for bedding at first, and I really didn't mind it (I had pigs when I was young, and back then you only used shavings, there were no other options).  However, it is rather messy when the pig(s) decide to fling it outside the cage.  You are right about the wood shavings - it does hide messes well.  In my opinion, fleece can be kinda gross to wash but it's so much easier to use.  Good luck with little critter."
guineapigs,3bnq7g,Pignamedpig,2,Thu Jul 2 16:14:34 2015 UTC,My pig liked to flip his bowl every time and throw it adorns the cage. I replace it with one that clips on the cage and now he flings it out of the bowl with his feet. I can't win and he knows it.

guineapigs,3bmcpr,bunnyonacid,12,Tue Jun 30 11:26:39 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're sleeping for long hours, it doesn't really matter if your piggy is well trained, since they have to poop and pee every hour. So you'll probably wake up covered in smashed pig poop. What if you wake up with a piece of surprise in your mouth?! Your pig can never look you in the eye ever again!  Also, you might accidentally smother and kill your pig, which is the main concern.   Hope you feel better though, I'm sure your piggy can help with that, but probably not by sleeping on it."

guineapigs,3bmcpr,Pignamedpig,2,Tue Jun 30 20:45:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could set up her cage close to you, without her being in bed with you?

guineapigs,3bmcpr,lexanka,2,Thu Jul 2 16:11:07 2015 UTC,"I fell asleep once with my piggies in bed with me. I woke up and they were missing. I found one on the floor under the bed, but could not find the other pig anywhere. I looked all over the house, looked outside, talked to the neighbors, crawled around on my hands and knees listening for any noise.   It turns out the little guy made his way down to the foot of my bed and fell off the bottom, but was caught by the sheet being tucked into the mattress. The sheet formed a lovely hammock and he appeared extremely comfortable.   So much poop in my bed though. Would not recommend."
guineapigs,3bmcpr,Zaphy1415926,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:45:52 2015 UTC,Your peeg is going to use you as a toilet if you do this! Plus you could roll over your little piggy when you're sleeping and crush him/her.
guineapigs,3bmcpr,Svataben,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:44:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend it, but...  Once when I was feeling really down, I put a couple of towels down on the side of the bed I don't sleep on and put pillows under the towel edges not against my body to create semi-walls. My piggies slept quite happily next to me, and any night presents were contained fine (my piggies are normally quite particular about going in one or two spots).  They were safe, my bed was clean, and the benefit for how I was feeling was really substantial.   Hope that helps and give your piggies a snuggle for me :).   Edit: just read that you're drunk which means you're more likely to accidentally roll on them and not wake up. Id suggest maybe just a snuggle tonight but not in the bed :P"

guineapigs,3bm5je,Dielila,3,Tue Jun 30 09:47:16 2015 UTC,"I have three boys, and they will bicker and chase each other. The bad stuff that would cause you to separate them is drawing blood, flying at each other, and if one is stopping the other one from getting a proper amount of food. I would work on their relationship by spending floor and lap time together so they can bond together with you, it helps a lot. A buddy bath also helps since it wipes away scents and bonds them through the common stress of the bath."
guineapigs,3bm5je,superevie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:49:32 2015 UTC,"We have 2 boys, about 7 months apart in age and when we introduced them, the young one(Lonnie) dominated (Charlie is timid).  They have been together now for 4.5 years but initially we had to put them in separate cages next to each other.  We tried to slowly introduce them, but ultimately a joint bath time seemed to do the trick.  Maybe they made a common enemy that day.  EDIT:  oh, also when we put them together, or cleaned their cage we always added treats and/or toys to distract them for the initial mingle"
guineapigs,3bm5je,trouzy,2,Wed Jul 1 07:12:12 2015 UTC,"Everyting superevie said. I have three pigs as well. They get grumpy with each other every now and then, but drawing blood is when to separate.

guineapigs,3bjsc0,MacheTexx,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:47:46 2015 UTC,My piggs and rabbits tend to chew frozen water bottles. To remedy this i bought a brick and freeze it. They stay coool and no sopping wet bedding. I have also heard a flat rock or tile does the trick too.
guineapigs,3bjsc0,BaconFairy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:02:38 2015 UTC,Does that stay cold for long? We've tried tiles but they lose their cool after a short time.
guineapigs,3bjsc0,BaconFairy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:46:51 2015 UTC,Depends on how long you freeze it. The brick and rock stayed cool for a while from what i remember.

His fur was more rubbed away/broken off, than completely gone in patches like that. His skin was also very flaky. Maybe that was just him.   Definitely see a vet. Please be aware that not all vets are well versed in exotics.  The vet should do a scraping to check for mites and then an injection of Ivermectin. The guinea pig will need a few treatments over the next several weeks.  The topical meds for this, like Revolution, only seem to work if it is a very light case.   Also, so you know, this is extremely painful for the infested guinea pig. http://www.guinealynx.info/mites.html"

Maybe it was because my older one wasn't used to having a friend or the younger was too energetic, but they too dislike one another. I keep their cages side by side, but I have individual play time. I've trained my one to do tricks like walk in a circle, nudge a ball around, stand on her hind legs, etc. This keeps her mind active while also getting her yummy treats! I have a lot of lap time with each which they seem to like. Just hanging out around them while you read or are on the computer may help them feel less lonely as well!"

When I was younger I was only allowed one so I gave them plenty of attention and outside time and they were happy. I have two now and still they are happier alone because both of them won't step down when they do their dance. I wanted to get Giz a friend and every chance I've given them Giz gets his skin ripped off. Pairs don't always work out. So yes outside time and cuddles. I'm sure it helps having plenty of things to do in their cage when you or no one else can give them attention

If we had been more prepared we would have gotten another, but it was such short notice and she really needed someone to take care of her.

guineapigs,3b9v6i,FrolickingBeans,2,Sat Jun 27 04:17:48 2015 UTC,"Trios are tricky - sometimes they don't work, so be prepared for that...  What will you do with the third piggy if it doesn't work?  That said - I have a sow trio.  They've been together for about a year now and they get along well - or well enough - but the beginning was rough.  I didn't think I'd survive the stress of introductions.  My original pair were littermates, and I added a 3rd girl.  They were pretty mean to her at first.  It took a few months for them to sort it all out.  Just make sure your new one is healthy - you may want to quarantine for a bit - do introductions on neutral territory, and be prepared for a bit of squabbling!"
guineapigs,3b9v6i,its_all_irrelephant,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:36:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. When I added my second one they got along great from the start. I will definitely make sure they get along before I make any decisions.
guineapigs,3b9v6i,Abyssinius,2,Sat Jun 27 22:36:40 2015 UTC,"I think as long as you're doing the dating step it'll be fine. If they get along and you bring her home, 3 pigs isn't more work than two. But for some reason the poop seems to be inordinately much much more! o.0 Just make sure you have room for 3, that's gonna be a huge factor in helping them get along. :) I just adopted piggy #3 at the end of February, they're all friends now aside from normal brotherly bickering over food."
guineapigs,3b9v6i,Zukazuk,2,Sat Jun 27 05:04:01 2015 UTC,"Haha I remember adding my second one and the doubling of the poop. I'm just hoping that my more dominant Cocoa will get along with the new one. I have no doubt that Rosie will get along with her. She seems pretty submissive. But I don't know how she acts toward other pigs. I'm happy that since I work at PetCo, I will be able to have a neutral introduction before I make this decision. I'm hoping all goes to plan. The woman who dropped her off said that her daughter would be happy if she knew she would have a good home with other piggies. I'm still unsure of the circumstances that caused them to abandon her, but I want to give her the best home possible."

Much. Teeth Chattering. The dominance fights would get so heated that the moment I separated everyone they all flopped over and conked out. It was especially rough on my beta because everyone was beating up on him. I had to rehome the third pig, but at least I sent him on in much better condition than I got him.  I just wanted to give you the other perspective since all of your replies so far are about trios working out."
guineapigs,3b9v6i,Empty_Bother_Pockets,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:34:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply. I wanted a real answer. I want a good home for this pig. She's so sweet. I will happily take her in if she gets along with my 2 girls. I'm hoping that since they are girls, they won't be as dominant as boys can be. My two got along from the start, but Cocoa is the dominant pig out of the pair and she did not like my friend's dominant pig. I'm hoping that they will get along, if not will do my best to find a good home for her."
guineapigs,3b9v6i,caffeineassisted,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:28:09 2015 UTC,"First off, we'll done for being responsible and getting them to meet each other first. A trio can be tricky, but then so can having two. (I've had to separate piggies in the past that was mega aggressive to the other, drawing blood) All you can do is see how it goes, but don't let your heart rule your head. No good upsetting three piggies, and putting more responsibility on yourself, when this new one could be adopted into a just as loving home as yours. :-)"

Usually I'm drawn to Abysinnians. But I've handled her a few times a work in the past two days and she cuddles in my neck like Cocoa does. She's very sweet, but a little scared. She bites a bit, but I think it's just because she's in a new environment. I'm hoping my dominant pig will accept her and I can adopt her on Monday. Fingers crossed."

Mix that with the fan blowing close to them, it seemed to help quite a bit! It probably helped that both our are longer haired though.

I'm invoicing the insurance co. for the vet bills since they couldn't seem to have gotten in fixed the first 5 times. You can also freeze some ceramic tiles, and ice packs. I've done that and the bowl of ice in front of a fan.  EDIT!  Also wanted to add- pick up some black out curtains for the windows to help keep the sun/heat out."

guineapigs,3b8efy,MoBiLiZeHD,3,Fri Jun 26 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"Normally, if you keep your hay container full, piggie will regulate his own intake and eat what he needs. Piggies are natural foragers, and when hay is abundant and always available (as it should be), they'll usually pick through it to find the choicest pieces (the fluffy ones that look like wheat stalks always get eaten first by my piggies).  You're going to waste some hay though, it's kind of hard to avoid. Depending on your setup, hay is probably going to get pulled out of the holder or otherwise flung onto the floor of your enclosure. They'll graze through it but it'll also get peed on; so you'll just want to sweep it out when you clean the enclosure."
guineapigs,3b8efy,castlecraver,3,Fri Jun 26 20:33:19 2015 UTC,"You need to be feeding him alfalfa hay. A mixture of timothy hay and alfalfa hay is also ok. Alfalfa hay is higher in fat and differs in some nutrients and is necessary for babies who are growing at an extremely fast rate. When he's 6-ish months old switch to timothy hay completely. You can ease into it by mixing more and more timothy hay into it around 4 or 5 months. His pellets should also be alfalfa based, also switch at 6 months old."
guineapigs,3b8efy,Abyssinius,3,Fri Jun 26 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"Offer alfalfa hay and pellets until 6 mos. Also, try fresh veggies too. :) Just keep everything available at all times and he will regulate himself."
guineapigs,3b8efy,Ephemeral_Halcyon,2,Fri Jun 26 22:36:34 2015 UTC,Is he alone? Pigs are herd animals and do a lot better when they have a companion. When my alpha passed away my beta was really uncomfortable being by himself without another pig to watch his back when he let his guard down to eat even though he's already bonded with us. Sometimes babies don't know what's food or how to behave without another guinea pig to compete with. I adopted a neglected pig and my beta had to teach him all kinds of normal pig behaviors. Once the new guy saw Zuko eat something he would have to try it for himself and it opened him up to a lot more kinds of food and made him more comfortable with us.
guineapigs,3b8efy,Zukazuk,2,Fri Jun 26 22:51:10 2015 UTC,"the hay could be too rough or dry. kaytee tends to have a lot of straw hay that they don't eat. Try oxbow or another brand, probably a bit more expensive but it's worth it. Mine eats hay as a side dish to her meal of greens, so try giving it to him after a big meal as a digestive aid."
guineapigs,3b8efy,GrilledChilledCheese,2,Sat Jun 27 04:47:59 2015 UTC,Yeah we recently got some hay that has a lot of the big straw type pieces. Usually I try and get a bag with lots of those cat tail like things?   Those are his favorite.  But he does a good job of using the pieces he doesnt like as extra bedding.

guineapigs,3b6rbc,AsianInvasion113,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:53:35 2015 UTC,Occasionally my pigs squeak their hearts out but you can't hear them until I get into my room. They will sometimes run laps in their cage which is noisy but they need that exercise. Sometimes one of my pigs chirps like a bird at night. But I read most pigs don't do that. I've lived in duplexes all my life and even ones with thinner walls no ones ever complained about the pigs. You also want to make sure you have the space in your place for them. One pig needs at least a 2x3 cage and two pigs 2x4. People say you can stick two in a 2x3 but if they're boys you'll want a bigger space

It was written from 1946 to 1948 on a commission by Serge Koussevitzky for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The premiere was in Boston on 2 December 1949, conducted by Leonard Bernstein. The commission did not specify the duration, orchestral requirements or style of the piece, leaving the decisions to the composer.  Koussevitzky was billed to conduct the premiere, but fell ill, and the task fell to the young Bernstein.  Bernstein has been described as ""the ideal conductor for it, and it made Messiaen's name more widely known"".  Yvonne Loriod, who later became Messiaen's second wife, was the piano soloist, and Ginette Martenot played the ondes Martenot for the first and several subsequent performances. From 1953, Yvonne's sister Jeanne Loriod was the ondes Martenot player in many performances and recordings.

guineapigs,3b1wbm,Deep-In-His-Cups,10,Thu Jun 25 08:24:35 2015 UTC,"Sherman was my sister's guinea pig and Charlie's (my guinea pig) companion. We got him from a sleazy pet barn somewhere in ""Sliverdaily"", he was in the female pen for some reason and we have no idea how old he truly was. He was the sweetest guinea pig in the world that loved to run around the couch and would always have a green beard after eating his veggies. He acted like Charlie's older brother and would antagonize him at every chance but when they were lying on the heating pad during lap time they would cuddle up to each other and sleep soundly.   He was always making wheezing and sniffing noises (we knew this wasn't normal though and originally thought he had a URI) and later we found out it was because he had an enlarged heart. The meds worked for a while but eventually his condition worsened, and he passed away in my arms on December 28, 2014. He lived with us for three years. We're very emotional about his passing because he was the very first pet we've ever owned, and have never dealt with the death of a close family member."

guineapigs,3b61o9,selectiverealist,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:59:05 2015 UTC,"I never had a peruvian before but I have a coronet. We trim her hair super short every 4 weeks and she doesn't smell at all. But I must admit,that after the trimming, her fur is no longer than the hair of a short haired guinea pig. Are you sure she doesn't have a bladder infection or a bladder stone? Urin from an infected bladder smells disgusting and very strong. We keep our piggies on wood shavings, as usual in germany."
guineapigs,3b61o9,sojuicy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:07:24 2015 UTC,She's only 6 months old which I don't think is enough time to get a bladder stone.  Plus she doesn't seem to be uncomfortable when peeing. I just trimmed her hair extremely short on the back so hopefully that will help.
guineapigs,3b61o9,sammg37,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:51:45 2015 UTC,"Does she like to hang out in the places she pees in? It might be worth investing in fleece so she can't really camp out in damp, soiled paper. I have mini pee pads I made for my pigs that are maybe 4""-6"" square that can easily be taken out and replaced every few days without a big cage clean. Helps with the smell a lot and definitely prevents urine from hanging around. If you can't invest in something like that, just be really mindful of where she likes to go and spot clean those places a little more vigilantly."
guineapigs,3b61o9,sammg37,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:06:32 2015 UTC,"I took out her fleece house aka the pee den, and I had fleece lining the cage but it got nasty after a few days and as someone who likes everything very clean I was washing it almost every day which costs money/water.  I'm afraid if I use pee pads my other guinea pig will eat them.  Is there a certain way to prevent that?"
guineapigs,3b61o9,sammg37,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:48:59 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with my pigs eating their smaller fleece pee pads, and they like to eat only the things they aren't supposed to. I don't  think they like the taste or texture of the fabric much. They will, however, eat the edges of the puppy potty training pads, so I don't recommend those unless they're covered. The nice part about the smaller fleece pee pads is they're easy to swap out and don't take up so much space for the laundry. I have them lined with that uhaul absorbent fabric and it's great."
guineapigs,3b61o9,sammg37,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:09:52 2015 UTC,The uhaul fabric is a great idea. I had never considered it before but I could sew a covered liner for the whole cage with it in the middle that would be way more absorbent than fleece alone.  Then I could ditch the newspaper all together.  You can still just throw them in the washer right?
guineapigs,3b61o9,Radico87,2,Sat Jun 27 23:55:10 2015 UTC,Yup! The thing to consider is that the fleece is not meant to be absorbent at all -  it wicks the urine away into the uhaul pad. Sounds like that may have been the issue. I have a few sets I have made and only do pig laundry about once a month. It's great!
guineapigs,3b63h5,Yooshebal,6,Fri Jun 26 07:22:38 2015 UTC,Someone else correct me if I'm wrong but I really don't think you should shave your guinea pigs hair.  If you are worried about them being too warm you can put a cool pack in their cage for them to lie on and make sure that they have plenty of fresh cool water and some shade.
guineapigs,3b63h5,still-searching,6,Fri Jun 26 09:07:58 2015 UTC,"No, I think you're definitely right. I wouldn't shave a guinea pig. If the hair gets long and matted I might consider a trim, but never a shave."
guineapigs,3b63h5,kosta_kaylee,5,Fri Jun 26 12:33:10 2015 UTC,Their skin is crazy sensitive so shaving is not a good idea.  You can trim their hair every week to keep it shorter and maybe have a fan near them.

My piggies live in the garden, even during winter when temperatures can easily reach 30F or lower. They have a big house that's protected from the cold, with little houses stuffed with hay where they can cuddle up. Maybe try something similar for Joanie?"

guineapigs,3b0qln,Zukazuk,2,Sat Jun 27 14:14:41 2015 UTC,if she's shivering it could be a health problem. Even when my pig is cold she doesn't shiver. She puffs herself up to try warm herself up.

If I had to do it over, I would make it wider at the top, so it is easier to load with hay.  Pigs love the hay bag.  I found instructions on the web, I'll have to look and see if I can find it.  Wasn't complicated at all (the trickiest part was attaching grommets, and I had to buy the materials to do it)."
guineapigs,3avc9n,Cazzandra,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:31:50 2015 UTC,"I made two (too ;) ) as the piggies were split up at the time due to Flash not feeling well & only letting us know by chewing off half of Cinnamon's ear! [Here is Cinnamon]([Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/OgB2Rya.jpg\)) ignoring one of them ;) Bit blurry sorry, & she's in the ancient cage that only gets dragged out for hospital time.  Was easy to make, basically  folded a rectangle of fleece into a square, stitched up the sides, hemmed the top & cut two access holes in the front. I also cut 2 slits through both layers of fleece just below the hem at the top so I could attach a couple of shower curtain rings to attach it to the cage.  The bags have really cut down on the amount of hay they get through, they're no longer using a hay pile as a loo & wheeking for more after they've been peeing in it!  Oh & Cinnamon is long since healed up & back in with Flash fighting over greens, albeit half an ear short now :( We sure learned what to look out for when Flash is feeling off though!"

guineapigs,3av90a,Pignamedpig,7,Tue Jun 23 19:52:38 2015 UTC,"You may actually be allergic to the hay and not your pigs. Try changing the type (ex, timothy to orchard grass) and see if that helps. Cleaning the cage can disturb the hay dust and cause more of it to circulate, exacerbating the issue. Good luck with the whole situation!"
guineapigs,3av90a,sammg37,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:23:03 2015 UTC,"Good idea, I hope it's just the hay. I'll try that."
guineapigs,3av90a,suzyqmonster,0,Wed Jun 24 03:34:34 2015 UTC,"It is very likely the hay. My husband and I were both very allergic to timothy hay and do much better with orchard grass hay. And our pigs love it. Also if you are in the US, consider ordering online from Small Pet Select or KMS Hayloft vs going to a petstore. Petstore hay tends to take a while to get to the store, and then it sits on the shelf and dries out, creating more dust.  Bathing the pigs is not going to help and isn't necessary (unless you have long hair pigs)."

How often do you wash them? We use Kaytee Squeaky Clean Critter Shampoo once very 3 months or bring them to their adoption center for a spa day.

guineapigs,3as5qg,teenitinijenni,2,Tue Jun 23 13:26:37 2015 UTC,Do you keep your three boys together without any fighting? Do you have any tips? I've heard that keeping boys together can be difficult.
guineapigs,3as5qg,Abyssinius,7,Tue Jun 23 05:22:24 2015 UTC,"Agreeing with u/Abyssinius, big cage helps a ton. Three water bottles, three bowls, three hideys. If someone is getting huffy, they can just go off to a station and have a snack or lay down. I also was careful when adding each new guy to evaluate their personality the best I could to see how it would mesh with the rest, trying not to pick anyone overly hostile. I really don't have fighting, light bickering, normal stuff. One of the older boys plays with the baby, and the older ones tend to protect the baby. As the baby is getting older and can hang on his own, they're leaving him alone more and giving him access to everything.   I know this sounds nutty, but the best thing I ever did involves a paper bag. Back when I was bonding my first pair, I had a cuy pig (didn't know it at the time) and it  had been taking me two months of meetings and it still wasn't taking. The cuy was just so tough to break. Haha I had a large paper grocery bag, the two of them walked into it, and started a tornado. I got scared, so I just picked up the bag. I shook the bag gently and they stopped. It was calm. I looked in the bag, and they were cuddling in there. I let them out, and after the shared experience of the scary bag, they were buddies. Since then, after a new pair or group has met and had to time to sniff and start getting a little sassy, I place them in the bag gently (SO GENTLY) move the bag until they settle. Sometimes it takes a few times, but the light stress makes them bond. I call it Common Enemy Bag."
guineapigs,3asg2k,ExcuseMyTourettes,4,Tue Jun 23 03:32:16 2015 UTC,"That really sucks :( so sorry to hear that. May I ask how the outdoor pen was arranged? When I take mine outside, I put the pen in a particular area of the yard so that half of the pen is in the shade and half of it is in the sun. Also, I put ice in some socks, crush it on the ground once or twice and lay them in the sunny side of the pen. They like to plop down on them to cool off. Again, really sorry that happened, sounds so tragic."
guineapigs,3asg2k,Rager133,7,Tue Jun 23 04:07:03 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling the pigloo was the problem. It would trap heat like a car, so they may have gone in hide and were fatigued quickly by the heat.  We usually take our girls outside late afternoon and find a part shade part sun area, too. I've never taken a hidey out with us.   Sorry for your loss, OP. :("

I can only imagine your panic trying to save your babies.  I always would worry about heatstroke when I would bring my boys outside so I always put frozen marble slabs out and near them so they could cool off.  I never gave them any hides to avoid trapped heat but even then I only let them outside for 10 minutes tops.    This doesn't help you now and I am truly sorry that this happened at all.

guineapigs,3armx5,MacheTexx,2,Tue Jun 23 06:43:15 2015 UTC,Look into fleece for guinea pigs. Do your research on which variety to get.
guineapigs,3armx5,zacsxe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:46:58 2015 UTC,The rainbow Chevron stuff is a fleece that I use as bedding. The cage itself with the turquoise thing is an actual cage. I have two of them set up together with a ramp in-between. You can find them on amazon. Here's the link: http://www.amazon.com/Midwest-Interactive-Guinea-Habitat-Plus/dp/B001NJ0DQ8  Edit: if you're looking into fleece bedding definitely get anti-pill fleece and you have to wash them in warm water like 6 times before you put them in your cage. The fleece needs to be able to whick the pee through. Underneath the fleece I now use like medical pads. Or you can use uhal furniture blankets. It's pretty much the same thing. They are thick fabric stuff made to absorb wetness and make sure nothing gets wet! PM me if you have questions!!

I'm in NY and I've never heard of an auction around here. If there is one near me, I'd like to go to help the piggies that are there‚Äîhow did you find out about it in your area?"
guineapigs,3apz1p,lauraporah,3,Mon Jun 22 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"Its a ""livestock"" auction that mainly focuses on Chickens (and other poultry) as well as Rabbits. Occasionally, a GP breeder will have a surplus of babies, so they will come through. I try to buy a few to rehome, but obviously I can't win them all (for sanity and monetary reasons). There are some pet stores suppliers that purchase them as well. Sometimes larger livestock will come through, but rarely, mainly pygmy goats or milking goats. A lot of the animals that come through our auction are very clean and well fed though, so that makes me think everyone is doing the right thing as far as living standards, its just a new thing. Guinea Pigs just don't have a high birthing rate and long pregnancies, so that's probably a good thing that GPs have going for them as far as becoming a staple. It will probably die down once it starts getting colder, as they won't be free ranging them anymore."
guineapigs,3apz1p,Jeslovespets,3,Mon Jun 22 18:48:51 2015 UTC,"Aww good on you! Just wondering, where are you located, Peru? And don't people normally breed cuys for food as opposed to guinea pigs because they are larger?"
guineapigs,3apz1p,Jeslovespets,2,Mon Jun 22 17:22:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm from Ohio.  There are a few people at the auction who enjoy the meat on a shish-kabob. :( Seems to be a thing mainly in spring-summer-fall months where they can be outside and free range with minimal care. They tend to grow much faster apparently. They guy I was specifically bidding against generally only buys adults - so I'm honestly not sure his intent on these little guys."
guineapigs,3apz1p,lauraporah,2,Mon Jun 22 17:33:44 2015 UTC,"In Ohio, for real? I'm really surprised people are ok with that. Like I can see rabbits, but guinea pigs? That's messed up"

Seems to be a supplemental meat and not a main course. Its so bizarre."
guineapigs,3apz1p,lauraporah,2,Mon Jun 22 18:06:23 2015 UTC,"So ""super pigs"" as in cuys?? And supplemental meat to feed animals? I know cuys are bred in Peru to be a bigger meat source for when they eat them. Poor little piggies."

You could come to terms with the fact that other people have different cultural perceptions than yourself. They're not coming into your house to eat your pet guineapigs after all, you're going into their auctions to be judgmental of their actions."

guineapigs,3apz1p,Jeslovespets,4,Mon Jun 22 22:37:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm not judgmental of their actions at all. Like I said, there are pigs that I couldn't get, and I'm okay with that. I eat and raise meat rabbit, not a lot of people are a big fan of me because I do that.   Guinea Pigs don't come through the auction very much, they haven't been there the past 3 auctions (once a month). There is no mindset of demand, period. Over 300 rabbits sell that that auction, compared to the 11 guinea pigs.   I won't be buying any GPs over the next several months since I have this group, so kill buyers will be purchasing them.   There's no reason to be an absolute ass.  But good on you for choosing to be snarky."
guineapigs,3apz1p,nomorenoobtube,-5,Mon Jun 22 18:42:13 2015 UTC,"...Okay so walk me through this.   You bought these pigs at the auction to save them from being eaten, but you don't care about the fact that other people are eating guineapigs?"
guineapigs,3apz1p,Iheartbowie,6,Mon Jun 22 19:06:51 2015 UTC,"I do care - its not my cup of tea. Having GPs growing up, they've always been like an alternative to a dog. If you didn't have a dog, you had a guinea pig, if you didn't have a GP, you had a hamster. But, if the GP is being raised in an excellent standard of care, who am I to judge? I eat chicken, pig, rabbit and cow. I don't get to judge on what others eat.   I personally purchased them to rehome, I didn't ""save"" them. I never said these were ""rescues"". I just won the bid. I was bidding against a kill buyer on this set, and a small town pet store bid on the rest and I know she provides great care when she has them. I talk to the kill buyer on a regular basis, he taught me what I needed to know about meat rabbits. He knows my opinion on eating Guinea Pigs and that I won't do it and won't try it. I don't think less of him because he disagrees. He raises his animals with integrity, decent enclosures, clean water and food everyday.

guineapigs,3apr18,Lilosss,4,Mon Jun 22 14:40:24 2015 UTC,"Hard to say with the help of the picture. I must admit it looks a little bit male to me. The male genitals look like an ""i"" with a big dot (which is actually the penis) and the girls like a ""Y"". Does it have testicles? By 6 weeks it should be sexually mature, so you should be able to palpate them."
guineapigs,3apr18,sojuicy,2,Mon Jun 22 15:14:39 2015 UTC,I did feel testicles when I checked. Thanks for the advice!
guineapigs,3apr18,Stringmaster29,3,Mon Jun 22 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"its a male. im almost positive. (ima Gpig specialist). one way to tell is to gently press down about an inch above the 'opening', and you can feel a bump, gently push that, and it should make the penis come out a little. its the easiest way to tell on them"
guineapigs,3apr18,_inkrypted_,2,Tue Jun 23 20:35:53 2015 UTC,"I was told Squeaky was female, but now I am not so sure. Gently pressing down above her genitals does not reveal a penis. She is 2.5 months old."

guineapigs,3aos5a,sojuicy,2,Mon Jun 22 15:21:21 2015 UTC,Occasionally one of my water bottles will get an air bubble in the line and stop dispensing water. After a couple of attempts to drink with no water coming out they stop trying to use that bottle.

guineapigs,3ajn1a,sgtlobster06,8,Sat Jun 20 21:07:50 2015 UTC,"you're starting to see their natural behaviors :)   walk slowly with prolonged purring (butt wiggling too?) is likely rumblestrutting, it's a dominance behavior. If they're fairly new to your house, they might have been too timid to do dominance displays until now, now they're settled in they're gonna rumblestrut at each other to sort out who's boss. jumping in the video is popcorning, it's a sign they're really happy :) they usually jump up and shake their head about a little, sometimes even do a quarter turn   Your piggies are doing well! It may be good to look up some articles on guinea pig behavior (videos too!) so you're not too alarmed by their normal (though to us look odd) behaviors :)"
guineapigs,3ajn1a,Abyssinius,2,Sat Jun 20 21:14:39 2015 UTC,Well I had a guinea pig years ago and she would popcorn but not so spastically like this. Its also seems like they would do it when we touch them. (Im the aforementioned girlfriend)
guineapigs,3ajn1a,krirsten93,2,Sat Jun 20 21:17:52 2015 UTC,"babies tend to popcorn more spastically, though my boys will occasionally popcorn that spastically too and they're all adults. If they jump and/or popcorn when you touch them, it's likely out of surprise (1 of my 3 does this sometimes), they're still young and excitable. One thing to look out for is in some cases it might be mites, and being touched in the affected area will make them uncomfortable, but looking at the video that doesn't seem the case. If they were jumping due to mites, they would pretty much jump away every single time you or another pig touched them there.  edit: you might have also just had a calmer guinea pig :P they come in all sorts of personalities"
guineapigs,3ajn1a,Abyssinius,2,Sat Jun 20 21:29:05 2015 UTC,"Well we took them to the vet the day after we got them and they had a few fleas, and we got a medicine for it and they should be gone by now."
guineapigs,3ajn1a,Abyssinius,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:50:28 2015 UTC,"That's good. :) From the video it looks like they're healthy and happy baby pigs. If you're worried about their spastic jumping being more than baby behavior, be on the look out for bald spots, sores, scabs, and excessive scratching."
guineapigs,3ajn1a,Abyssinius,2,Sat Jun 20 22:07:45 2015 UTC,"So now - both of them are rumblestrutting, is this going to be a problem?"
guineapigs,3ajn1a,clumsyninjagirl,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:02:35 2015 UTC,"No, it's pretty normal for them to rumblestrut at each other as long as they're not fighting. Sometimes mine will rumblestrut at nothing at all. I'll hear the rumbling and look over, and the one that's doing it is on a different floor of the cage from both of the other two and I really don't know why he felt the need to...  In terms of fighting, there's bickering, then there's fighting. If it's just bickering, try not to interfere. Bickering is things like rumblestrutting, teeth chattering, chasing around, even head butting w/o teeth. More serious fighting would be raise front paws, snapping at each other, and biting. If blood is drawn you'll want to separate them, at least for the mean time until you have a concrete plan for reintroducing and teaching them to get along."
guineapigs,3ajn1a,sammg37,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:07:58 2015 UTC,"Rumblestrutting is very normal dominance behavior. I've had my boys for 4 years and the older one has to assert his dominance by being all grumbly every single day it seems. As long as no one is being bitten or hurt, it's all good."
guineapigs,3ajn1a,Svataben,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:01:56 2015 UTC,"Looks like you have very happy pigs! The rumblestrutting is normal dominance behaviour and they're just sorting out who's boss between the two of them. Nothing to worry about unless they start to fight, but I wouldn't anticipate that happening. That jumping is what they do when they're happy! They tend to do it a lot more frequently when they're younger just because they have more energy, so don't worry - just be happy knowing your pigs are happy. :]"
guineapigs,3ajn1a,SmashedBrotato,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"I agree wth the others. They're happy.  And the rumble-strutting is something you'll have to get used to. When g-pig females are in heat, they rumble-strut and slink around, and lay down weirdly/with attitude.  It's normal. Well, normal for guinea pigs. It's silly, really, but they can't help that silly is normal for them. ;)"
guineapigs,3ah1bp,lmakemilk,4,Sat Jun 20 02:42:14 2015 UTC,"He's adorable! Just a heads up if you don't already know, guinea pigs are a herd animal and are almost always happier with a buddy."

guineapigs,3ah1bp,Captain-Zebra-Tits,2,Sat Jun 20 05:32:10 2015 UTC,Awesome! He really is gorgeous! :)
guineapigs,3ah1bp,sammg37,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:34:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks! We went to three different places and this one stood out the most and we are hoping to find another fuzzy/longhair one for him to be with. I've been told that males are aggressive toward eachother sometimes, should we try to get a female and just have them fixed?"
guineapigs,3ah1bp,Captain-Zebra-Tits,2,Sat Jun 20 05:53:48 2015 UTC,"Many males will get along just fine! Let them pick each other, as /u/Captain-Zebra-Tits suggested - it'll save you a lot of time and headaches trying to get them to bond if they decide they don't want to. It all just depends on their personalities. However, I had both of my males neutered at a reputable teaching vet hospital in my area. One went flawlessly, but my other pig aspirated on some food he was hanging on to when they flipped him over for prep (not that common of an complication, but it happens) and we immediately had to assume he would develop pneumonia and treat him accordingly. All things considered, I'd do it again with pigs in the future if I had to, but it's not my first choice. I wouldn't fear neutering if it comes to it, but know it is very expensive (no one wants to neuter pigs because their anatomy has some extra protective layers around the testes, and they are prone to post-op infections).  By very expensive, consider the $500 I paid for both pigs a steal - in my area it's usually $500+ per."
guineapigs,3ah1bp,sammg37,2,Sat Jun 20 13:11:53 2015 UTC,Wow. It's cheaper to get a cat neutered than a guinea pig... I guess because of the risks?
guineapigs,3ah1bp,Captain-Zebra-Tits,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"That, and cat neuters are very routine, I'm assuming. I think it's partially a vicious cycle - no one neuters pigs, so no one has experience, so they're scared to, and repeat."
guineapigs,3ah1bp,Captain-Zebra-Tits,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:05:30 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I didn't think if that! It's a very good point.   I do hope the cycle can be put to end one day.

guineapigs,3ah1bp,jeorgun,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:56:49 2015 UTC,"It would be best to take him with you to meet other pigs and let them interact before getting them, let him choose a buddy essentially. Getting guinea pigs fixed can be extremely dangerous, so I've heard.   If you can't find a male that he likes you could always get a female and just put a divider in their cage. If they can talk and see each other they'll be fine. :) Good luck finding his friend!"
guineapigs,3ah1bp,sammg37,6,Sat Jun 20 06:18:04 2015 UTC,"In my experience (and I know I always pick the oddball pigs by happenstance) this only agitated my boys and caused lone Washington to escape from his pen a few times to try to get in and fight Bismarck to get to Penelope...So, uh, make sure the cages are escape proof!"

guineapigs,3ah1bp,Captain-Zebra-Tits,2,Sat Jun 20 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"Ahh. My boy likes to nibble at the bars every so often when either of the females are in heat. Sometimes the female in heat and my male will rumblestrut back and forth along the divider all day (minus leaving for food/water) and then they'll sleep next to each other along the divider. It's the cutest thing. My cage is definitely secure. I still check the divider every day, though to make sure we're still good."
guineapigs,3ah1bp,sammg37,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"Aww, that's super cute. My pigs won't even sleep next to each other in the same cage!"
guineapigs,3ah1bp,Abyssinius,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:34:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my girls usually will sleep in different areas of the cage so it's cute to watch them lay next to him at the divider. My pig PB will lay next to the divider and let him ruffle through her fur sometimes. I would love to be able to get another male for him, but I don't have the space to expand the cage that much. In August I'll finally be adding onto my current cage since at the moment I have a 2x4  cage that's split in half."

guineapigs,3agwoh,Tarqee224,4,Sat Jun 20 01:54:47 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but this sounds like it's par for the course. Sounds like this is a recent introduction and the fact that they're already sleeping together is huge. The humping should taper off in the next couple of weeks, the old girl just wants to make sure the newbie knows who the boss is.   As long as there's no physical injury happening I'd just leave them to sort out their social dynamics without interference.   I've just introduced a new girl (2 months) to an existing pair (6 months) and they're working out their own drama so you're not alone."
guineapigs,3agwoh,L00k_Again,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:10:28 2015 UTC,"Thank's, the older guinea pig has calmed down a bit since the time we first introduced, I just didn't want to go to fast with something and hurt the little one.. he's going strong though."
guineapigs,3agwoh,Abyssinius,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:53:21 2015 UTC,"aww it's so cute that the younger one's already attached himself to the older one :D humping is not a big deal, it has to happen for them to figure out who's boss, like /u/L00k_Again said.   It's good that you have them together in a temporary cage. Keep them in there for a while to make sure they get along. Then when you're ready to put them in the usual cage, do a deep clean to completely rid it of the old one's scent. If possible, rearrange all the furniture in a new way. They'll repeat a little bit of the dominance thing, but if they get along on the floor, they should be fine when put in the cage. Try not to separate them and put them back together too many times, it interrupts the relationship establishment and might make it more stressful for the new pig since he'll have to handle more humping and dominance behaviors.  With boys, you might never completely get rid of humping. My oldest hasn't humped anyone in a really long time, but the middle and youngest boys will hump each other occasionally. The middle one will even hump the oldest fairly frequently. The oldest has been very patient with the middle boy because he knows he's the biggest and there's no unseating him from his throne. He just sits there like ""you just keep trying that, I still rule the cage"" :P"
guineapigs,3agwoh,Abyssinius,2,Sat Jun 20 08:00:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info!

guineapigs,3acf3c,Captain-Zebra-Tits,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:10:33 2015 UTC,"Ahh. He'll be okay if it's just a couple months, then. Even if you have a smaller cage currently you can still put fleece in the bottom of it rather than bedding(just a suggestion it's up to personal preference). Some people will use puppy pads or old towels under the fleece. In my cage I use moving pads from uhaul that are made from recycled fabrics under the fleece in my cage. Somehow my pigs still manage to kick poo out of the cage, though. xP"

guineapigs,3abgjl,dominicanerd85,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:14:39 2015 UTC,"The worst part is the female goes into heat immediately after birth, so if you left a male in the cage get ready for another litter because she's already pregnant.  Oh, and the babies become viable within 6 weeks so you have to separate them after weening or the kids will knock the mother up."

guineapigs,3abkwe,Loelanch,5,Thu Jun 18 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"Well it's all because it depends on your situation and setup. If you're checking out for the weekend (48-72 hours) an overabundance of hay, an extra water bottle and food bowl, and an extra cage cleaning can see them though. They won't starve from lack of veggies in that time despite what their squeaks would have you believe. If you have a large cage getting someone to come and check in on them once or twice a day is ideal if you're going to be gone for 3+ days and anything more than 6 days you're going to need a dedicated piggy-sitter to take them in while you're gone. They'll need a cage cleaning, juicies, and if a medical issue crops up you'll want someone to pick up on it since they get sick fast.  Source: Am dedicated piggy sitter."
guineapigs,3abkwe,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,3,Thu Jun 18 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"It depends on where I'm going.

guineapigs,3abkwe,mstaz1112,3,Fri Jun 19 12:32:21 2015 UTC,"Just echoing what others have said. They're fine for a weekend if you make sure their hay, pellets and water are full and their cage is clean. If I'm doing that I normally will give them big chunks of veg like cucumber before I leave so that it takes them a bit longer to eat it.  Any longer than 2 days (so if I'm leaving on the Friday and back on the Monday) I would  ask a friend to pop in, and for my three week trip this summer they are going to a special piggie and rabbit boarding place."
guineapigs,3abkwe,still-searching,2,Fri Jun 19 09:22:28 2015 UTC,"I'm actually going away this weekend (Friday through Monday). My sister-in-law has agreed to come over twice per day to make sure my pigs have food, water, and a clean cage, and also to hold/play with them. In return I'm letting her use my car (plus I have given her a lot of free babysitting recently).  For me that was the easiest option since she lives close to me and is a stay-at-home mom. Also, my pigs don't have to stay in an unfamiliar environment. If you don't have friends/family willing to do that, you could try finding a pet-sitting service that can do daily checks/feedings."

guineapigs,3abkwe,theotherclairebear,2,Fri Jun 19 07:51:42 2015 UTC,"If it's just a few days, just make sure they have enough water, hay, ands pellets.

And yes, if you look closely in the picture, the black part on the entire top shelf is fleece, as well as the black and blue parts on the bottom! I only give them a certain amount of space of pine shavings & carefresh bedding, and then they sleep on the nice clean fleece! Under it all is puppy pads, toddler bed mats, and newspapers, and along the veryyy bottom is towels & other fleece blankets :) that's why its soooo very tedious... And ohhh, the laundry!

guineapigs,3a8qc3,breezombiee,6,Thu Jun 18 02:58:59 2015 UTC,"Make sure to get two piggies! They are very social animals. Be aware, they are very messy animals! They poop A LOT! It has no odor and is dry, but it's still a lot.  My pigs live free in my room that way they dont need a huge cage, i have a small cage thats only got 3 sides, where they eat and drink and sleep but they have the rest of my room to walk around without a big cage taking up the whole place. I have washable rugs in my room from Hook and Loom, i throw them in the wash every week or two, and sweep up my piggies droppings a few times a day with a dust pan  I made a whole post about it a while ago  http://www.reddit.com/r/guineapigs/comments/2i1l73/how_to_have_free_roaming_pigs_full_instructions/"
guineapigs,3a8qc3,RobotPigOverlord,3,Thu Jun 18 03:41:59 2015 UTC,I saw your post when you first put it up and loved your setup. Next time I move I'm definitely going to try something like this. Right now I just have way too many pieces of furniture making way too many small corners that they'll like to hide in (and therefore pee in). You mentioned in your post that you had just moved there when you set it up. Have you gotten more furniture in your room since then? Do the pigs hide in the corners created by the furniture? I'm guessing I'll just have to be very conscious of the types of furniture I'm putting in the room and keep things off the floor.
guineapigs,3a8qc3,Abyssinius,5,Thu Jun 18 04:01:04 2015 UTC,"yes 1 or 2 guinea pigs need 8 square feet, more pigs need more space. I've read someone saying they're just rodents they just sit around. Well, they'll sit around if put in a pet store cage, but mine chase each other around the cage. Even if 80% of the time they just sit around, it's good they have the space for the rest 20%. If you think about it... we just sit around too... They need the space. Harnesses are not ok, besides, you won't really be able to walk them. I'm guessing you just want to keep a leash on them so you can let them loose outside to play? Their spines are not stiff enough to handle harnesses. Look into play pens. You can make a large enclosure out of storage cube grids for fairly cheap, much cheaper than the specifically designated pet fences. I clip my 3 pigs' nails every month and a half. Plenty of dog and cat owners clip their pets' nails, this is the same, easier because they can't crush you when they get upset like a large dog can. Since it's you and your fiance, it'll be much easier. One of you can hold and distract, and the other one clip. Vitamin C supplements are not necessary if they get a good amount of fresh veggies. If you can, get 2 guinea pigs. The minimal space requirement is the same. Cleaning will not be more difficult. They'll be much better adjusted.   Good luck! Post pictures!"
guineapigs,3a8qc3,Abyssinius,3,Thu Jun 18 03:36:45 2015 UTC,"For starters, Guinea Pigs are social animals and really are happiest when they have another guinea pal. It is safe to clip their nails, just make sure not to hit the quick. When I am at my computer I will answer more of no one else has."
guineapigs,3a8qc3,SmashedBrotato,3,Thu Jun 18 03:38:11 2015 UTC,"Is it true that you really need an 8 square foot cage?  Yes. For one guinea pig your cage should be at least 7.5 sq. ft. You should add an additional 2 sq.ft. per additional guinea pig. The cage should NOT be an aquarium style cage because they won't get enough air. It's also important to make sure the cage doesn't have a wire bottom because that could cause problems for the piggy. The bedding should be something soft, like Carefresh. Most people (and pigs!) prefer fleece bedding, though.   Are harnesses okay for them to use?  Absolutely NOT. Harnesses, exercise wheels, and exercise balls are very dangerous for piggies. Harnesses could break their backs. Wheels and balls could break their backs, cause them to overheat, and hurt their feet.   Is it really safe for us to clip their nails if needed?  Yes. As a matter of fact you're supposed to cut their nails. Cutting a pigs' nails can be pretty tricky. They tend to squirm a lot. Piggies, like cats, have veins in their nails (also known as the ""quick""). If you cut too low and pierce their vein they'll bleed and you need to have a special powder to stop it. I've found it much easier to just take them to the vet. They go about three times a year for nail clippings and one a year for a checkup. (It isn't cheap, but piggies are without a doubt a super expensive pet to have!)   And I've heard a lot about Vitamin C supplements, are those necessary or can I give it to them in their veggies?  No, they aren't necessary. Many pigs hate the way they taste and it deters them from drinking water, which is obviously bad. Giving your pig 1/4 of a green bell pepper a day should provide him or her with enough vitamin C.   Here are some of my favorite guinea pig sites. It's where I got all my information from.   Medical Information: http://www.guinealynx.info/ General Information/Forums: (this was the first site I was ever directed to!) http://www.guineapigcages.com/   They also have a cage/bedding store: http://www.guineapigcagesstore.com/     As well as a ""toys"" store: http://www.guineapigmarket.com/  I hate to link stores because I don't want to seem like I'm promoting one company over another (I get my fleece bedding from Etsy, to be honest) but I think seeing what sort of things are on that site might help you see what is and isn't okay for guinea pigs.     My blog, because someone's personal experience might help you!: http://danniducklovespiggies.tumblr.com/ A Facebook group that helped me more than anyone: https://www.facebook.com/groups/663237273725239/ Online guinea pig magazine of sorts: http://www.guineapigtoday.com/ Here's two veggies charts that I use all the time. I have them handing on my fridge!  *http://www.guineapigcages.com/food/Veggie-and-Fruit-Charts.pdf   *http://www.happycavy.com/what-can-guinea-pigs-eat/  (I give my (4) pigs 1 green pepper every day and than I give them a variety of 6-7 different things every week.)   Please let me know if you have any other questions!!   Edit: Everyone is telling you to get at least two piggies. It is true that guinea pigs are social animals and do better in pairs or groups. But it's more important that you can afford and properly care for the number of pigs you get. You're better off with one pig that you can provide everything for than multiple pigs that you struggle to care for. If you get one pig just make sure to give them extra time and attention.   I guess I should have talked a little more about price, because that's what shocked me the most.   I spend between $150-$200 every month in the pet store for food and litter. (I use fleece bedding which cost about $400 and I can use them for probably a year or two. Regular bedding cost about $400 a month.) Their vet is probably about $800 a year if all goes well. You need to have a good amount of money set aside  Veggies are probably about $60-$80 a week, depending on how much of a variety they get. They also need toys which I've probably spent about $150 in 4 years on, so that isn't bad. Cage accessories like fleece hidey houses and beds tend to be about $30 each. My cage itself cost about $250-$300 in total to build. My friends with cats and dogs don't even spend this much!"
guineapigs,3a8qc3,caviabella,-3,Thu Jun 18 15:49:15 2015 UTC,"A rabbit cage is enough, one thing I wish I knew was, buy plastic bottomed cages. Much easier to clean, because metal rusts once those pigs pee on it! You don't really need a big big cage, as long as you let them run around your house (with supervision, they love to chew on electrical cords and wires!) or yard everyday for a little bit.  Vitamin C is really not needed, kale and greens are enough to keep a pig healthy and happy. Harnesses don't work! They slip out of them, paw by paw, and generally hate any kind of collar so you'll have to have a little fence or block their path with your body when you let them run around.   They love to explore and are naturally curious, even if they're scared at first, I feel that they learn and are very smart animals in their own right.   Boy pigs are more active and social and more vocal, girls are more cuddly and timid, in my experience. Each one has its own tastes in veggies and fruits, and of course each one has its own personality and habits. Some have been traumatized from living in pet shops, and others are obnoxious and mean alpha pigs, it really depends. But always work on nurturing your pig by giving it attention, talking to it, petting it gently, it will become less shy as you expose it to new stimuli like TV and new people.   Support the rump when you pick up a pig, they are slippery little guys and their backs can get hurt by being bent in odd ways. So no running wheels like hamsters have.   A really great book on piggies is The Guinea Pig Handbook, it helped me when I was a little kid with my first pet."

These past two years for me have been the most difficult ones of my life so far. I'm not spending $100 (give or take) of the $600 I make monthly for a guinea pig. When I got her I had every intention of taking care of her basic needs. Maybe I'll give her a dash of fish oil or something to lubricate her bowels and rectum.  There are things in life you can't control and this is one of them. You're all acting like assholes with judgments past your place. You don't know what my current situation is like at all.

I haven't read all the other comments, so I can't speak for everyone, but I am not being an asshole. It is OK to give up a pet if you cannot or will not take care of it, and all I am doing is encouraging you to make that decision. She deserves the opportunity to receive healthcare.

However, you want the appearance of being a good pig parent without the work...and the added expense of having to pay for her health issues.  Pet ownership isn't for everyone, and you are the one who has to live with those decisions.  If you don't want to deal with her any longer, drop her off at your local animal rescue organization.

guineapigs,3a40y8,Abyssinius,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:30:29 2015 UTC,"Haven't been too successful in my personal experience but possible. It also depends a lot on how old the pigs were when you started training and their temperament. You should always go in with an expectation that they'll do their business everywhere. I've a fairly large cage and I don't pad the entire cage. It's all covered with fleece, but I only put absorbent padding under the fleece in certain areas (corners, one or two places along the edge). This was determined by watching where they pee and poop, and they are very consistently doing it in corners over 90% of the time, but I didn't train them to do it, it's just where they feel safe."

Just pellets that's all they need. Depending on their age you need a alfalfa based pellet for pigs under six months and Timothy based over six months.

guineapigs,3a4wb9,MarziNam,3,Wed Jun 17 06:35:01 2015 UTC,"They are at healthy weights for adult pigs of average length.  For some added perspective, I've an extra large pig (14 inches, or ~35.5 cm long) who weighs in at 1.8 kg. He's not excessively chubby (doesn't spread out horizontally like one of my other pigs who weighs less but is definitely the chubbier one) and runs around a lot. So it depends on their actual spine length as well."
guineapigs,3a4wb9,Abyssinius,2,Wed Jun 17 07:26:24 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.   Just as another ""data point"" for comparison: Have ladies that weigh in above 1.2kg at almost 5 years of age now.

guineapigs,3a4laj,i_am_ms_greenjeans,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:14:09 2015 UTC,We use binder clips all along the cage to prevent this from happening.

guineapigs,3a39ij,johnrgrace,2,Wed Jun 17 19:49:39 2015 UTC,"It would help if you got a neutered female from the RSPCA or whatever humane society you have where you are.  Some male pigs can get along with other males, some can't. It's a bit of a gamble.   Introducing pigs is best done in neutral territory, like out of the cage. And let there be plenty of treats.   Other than that, do a very thorough clean of their cage. It is good if they start on neutral smell levels, so that it doesn't support any old-pig-attitude of ""get off my lawn"".  Make sure they also get plenty of floor time to run off energy.  Get used to cutting up veggies in many smaller pieces, so they won't have to fight over one left piece.  Also, accept that guinea pigs are loud and showy about establishing rank in their pack. There will be rumble-strutting, posturing, chasing, and a lot of protesting whines.  Unless one really bites the other hard (as in a ripped ear, fur flying,  or blood appearing), don't worry too much."

Spike still won't eat treats out of my hand, so Oz will come to the cage door, get a treat, and bring it back to Spike. Then he'll come back to the cage door for his treat.   This might be the most adorable thing I've ever heard"
guineapigs,3a22wx,kendalkjd,2,Tue Jun 16 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you may be handling her improperly, or she has a medical condition. Whatever is going on she currently associates you (getting pet and picked up) with bad things and wants to go back in her cage.   To start off with, there are happy purrs and unhappy purrs, and it is hard to know the difference. I would look around for videos on how to pick up and pet a piggie just to check your bases on that front (they are prey animals, you are large and scary) but if that checks out she might have skin mites.   You will need to take her to the vet for treatment, but the short of the long is that skin mites make piggies very sensitive to touch in a bad way. They will not want to be cuddled or held. If you got your piggie from a feed store, craigslist, or it spends a lot of time outside or around other animals I would look into it.   The good news is that your piggie does not hate you. Piggies are fuzzy balls of love and incapable of hate. Whatever is going wrong you can fix it."
guineapigs,3a22wx,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,2,Tue Jun 16 18:27:46 2015 UTC,"My first thought was a misinterpretation of ""purr"". I think it's a fairly common mistake, especially since some websites describe a purr as being a rumbling sound (it isn't)."
guineapigs,3a22wx,L00k_Again,2,Wed Jun 17 04:50:06 2015 UTC,"It depends on your piggies character. Do have only one pig or does she have piggie friends? Some piggies are more into their own species than into humans^ Besides, most piggies are pretty anxious in the world outside and prefer being in their cage (just like mine). Perhaps she hadn't accepted the cage as her home in the past but now she has and feels safe there. Try to tame her inside the cage first and then take her outside. Uh and try to learn her some tricks. Keep her mind busy outside the cage, it makes them forget about their fears ;)"
guineapigs,3a1pw6,spacecasedilla,2,Tue Jun 16 15:26:13 2015 UTC,"Usually fresh fruits and veggies shouldn't stay in the cage any longer than two hours for this reason. Usually piggies eat it all up long before then anyway and this is not an issue. Keep the area very clean, see if there's any leftover food and residue to clean up. You can spray the area with baking soda and vinegar to deter and kill the leftover ants too."
guineapigs,3a1pw6,superevie,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:46:49 2015 UTC,Yeah my boyfriend tends to put big slices in there so he probably couldn't finish it all.

If I stayed very still he'll be more active beside he didn't think I was there. Don't pay so much attention to her, but be active and doing things near her cage so she'll get used to your voice. Don't try to pick her up or even touch her for a few days. You can sit there with your hand in the cage, maybe with a chunk of carrot, and talk softly to her. If she'll come investigate you, great! If not, don't rush it. Also consider getting her a friend. Guinea pigs live in herds and will acclimate better in pairs. Don't worry so much :P"
guineapigs,39ztbu,Abyssinius,2,Tue Jun 16 03:25:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she's probably just not used to you or the fact that she has a human now, so she doesn't know how to deal. Let her sit and think for a bit, she'll come around :)  Like what Abyssinius said, hang out around her a bit, talk to her (not too loud) and try and offer her some tasty food. She might just open up!"
guineapigs,39ztbu,theotherclairebear,2,Tue Jun 16 06:19:52 2015 UTC,Give her one of those piggy tunnels that she can hide in so she can take her time to be more comfortable around you.  It's normal for them to be petrified on their first few days in their new home.
guineapigs,39ztbu,Brynhild,2,Tue Jun 16 10:36:07 2015 UTC,"Both of my little peegs were like that when I first got them. They just sat shaking and terrified in the corner of the cage, poor things. I covered the front of their cage with a sheet for the first couple days so they could adjust to their new house without seeing their scary human. They are ok now."
guineapigs,39ztbu,Pignamedpig,2,Tue Jun 16 13:01:50 2015 UTC,Get her a friend. I promise she will spring into life immediately!
guineapigs,39ztbu,neogeoreo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:58:07 2015 UTC,"I got a rehomed piggie a few years ago. She was just the same, she didn't move an inch even when we left her alone or offered her treats. We also never saw her drink water or eat which freaked us out so we took her to the vet and they gave us some liquid vitamin enhanced food which we feed her with a syringe, it didn't end well for us and I'm not saying that it's the same case with your new piggie and I don't want to freak you out but we also researched and asked the same questions your asking now. It might be that she is just adapting or it might be more, don't doubt yourself though, if your piggie doesn't eat soon or drink water it might be best to visit your vet. I hope it's not the case but I just wanted to share my experience."
guineapigs,39zve4,ririplease,3,Tue Jun 16 03:15:23 2015 UTC,"There is no problem with a pellet free diet. All important nutrients can easily come from vegetables and hay. The main point is vitamin c and fiber, and such information is available from human diet sides of other sources.  There is always controversy about good and bad vegetables, but as long as there is variation, the risks are low.   Your case is still worrying. No matter what exactly it is, the guinea is still refusing food. And if that happens without any real outward reason, it is a pointer towards illness.    Since it appears to be all types of pellets, have you checked their teeth? Can they eat other harder food?   You definitely should not take it lightly. Start weighing them at least once a day. Watch closely what else they are eating - are they replacing the pellets or cutting down overall on food? Do they seem to want to eat and can't or are they not even interested? Are they losing weight?   If they lose weight over the next couple of days and/or show other unusual behaviour, go and have them checked out by a vet.  Also get your hands on some supplementary food like critical care. That powder can be stored over long time in the cupboard or freezer. Having that at home is the essential first aid kit for a guinea parent.  If you don't have access to such and they refuse to eat altogether for several hours, self-made ""smoothies"" from hay and vegetables or even vegetable based baby food is an alternative. Everything to keep the digestive system active until a vet can see them.  However, since your one is still eating, this is just information for the worst case scenario. So far it  sounds more like a tooth problem that might solve itself during the next week."
guineapigs,39zve4,Frida_P,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:47:15 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to take her to the vet as soon as I can. At least to see her teeth. She's still chewing on her wood house and eating the hard bits that aren't pellets when those things are there so I'm not super worried. But of course, I'd much rather be safe than sorry. Thank you for all the information!"
guineapigs,39zve4,theotherclairebear,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:40:34 2015 UTC,Hmm... did you switch the pellets before she decided to protest? What's her poop like? Are they normal? Have you tried hand feeding her?
guineapigs,39zve4,theotherclairebear,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:22:15 2015 UTC,Her poops are pretty normal and frequent haha
guineapigs,39zve4,suzyqmonster,2,Tue Jun 16 20:41:03 2015 UTC,Hmmm then maybe she's just realized she doesn't like pellets then. Maybe just don't give it to her for a while... and then re-introduce them later on in the week. She might want them back after not having them for a while.

guineapigs,39y0ub,blackshirtboy44,2,Mon Jun 15 18:45:27 2015 UTC,It could have once been ringworm that left a scar? If hair begins to grow back within the month then it may have just been a scab from scratching or something.. Just make sure it doesn't feel round under her skin or lumpy and keep a close eye on it. You can opt $50 for a skin scraping but I did this when I got my guinea and it came back negative but the medicine treated it and healed it so i'm really not sure. Thank you so much for taking in an older guinea you two are so wonderful. Just be very careful to monitor her eating if the past owner fed her a lot of sugary pellets or treats you might have to wean her off the artificial sugars slowly.  Also I must ask for pictures please! This sub loves photos lol.

We got her nails clipped and she seems to be walking around a lot more and looks like it doesn't hurt to walk anymore. But the vet did find fleas, so we are treating her. That is also what caused the bald spot he believes because the area that has no hair was perfectly normal otherwise. All in all otherwise he said she is a very healthy piggy!

guineapigs,39us6u,hestonkent,4,Mon Jun 15 04:15:36 2015 UTC,Aw. I used to have a pig who would lick my thumb all time. I've had many pigs in my life but Percy was the only licker
guineapigs,39us6u,7sshare,3,Mon Jun 15 04:17:05 2015 UTC,So cute! I have two pigs that love to lick. I went to the pet shop to get bedding before and left with Stripe because he came up and licked me. If you pet him he won't let you unless you leave a hand for him to lick me or he'll try to lick the petting hand. And Gizmo just licks the hell out of my hands. My boyfriend no matter how much he washes his hands smells like grease and oil and Gizmo never licks him just takes a big munch. I guess he thinks it's food. Guinea pig licks are the most heart melting thing
guineapigs,39us6u,AsianInvasion113,2,Mon Jun 15 05:37:48 2015 UTC,lol accidental piggy adoption was how Nino got here too... though not quite as sudden as Stripe. Friend of a friend was giving up Nino for adoption and the friend forwarded the email to me in case I had connections (I'm the office crazy guinea pig lady). I intended to email the owner and say I'll keep an eye out and when I saw his pictures it was game over. :P then he turned my life upside down for 2 weeks because introducing him to my two other boys was quite an affair... but the hand licking makes it all worth it :D
guineapigs,39us6u,AsianInvasion113,3,Mon Jun 15 06:24:42 2015 UTC,Awe that's awesome. It's so hard to say no to cute little guinea pig faces. Do you have any advise for introducing boys? I had Gizmo for nine months before I got Stripe. At the time I didn't have proper cage sizes so they got their own. But in April I got a c&c cage. It's a 2x6 if the devider is taken away. Sometimes they slept next to each other. They do well on the floor and outside Stripe can't be separated from Gizmo. But once I decided to put them in the cage together without the devider all hell broke lose. I put clean fleece in I wiped the plastic the grids and the three houses I have with apple cider vinegar. I even gave them a bath. They chattered like crazy and Stripe chased Gizmo until they got tired and have up. They even laid next to each other. I left them in there for a few hours and it got bad. They arguing didn't get lessened it just got worst. When I thought they were good I put three houses in there and Stripe claimed all of them. If Giz was in one Stripe would stick his face in there and he'd nip Giz. At night I couldn't do it anymore and separated them again. Stripe has managed to get to Gizmos side when I was gone and Gizmo jumped right out the cage. Came home to Giz greeting me from the floor. Now when I try to do the cage thing again Giz gets on the side and gets ready to jump. Stripe has gotten some good nips on Giz and I really don't think I can trust them alone in a cage. They're outside together almost everyday but once bars are put around them war is on. They're happier alone but it stills feels like I'm doing something wrong because people always say they need to be together
guineapigs,39us6u,LaFumeister,3,Mon Jun 15 16:27:30 2015 UTC,"oh I dunno, your situation sound complicated. If Gizmo was distressed enough to jump the fence and looks like he wants to try it again, I don't know how to remedy this. If they get along outside, then let them have as much time outside as possible? I think just having company may be good enough, even if it's through a fence.   Though if you do want to try to get them together in the cage, I can tell you what I learned from my experience. How long have they lived in the cage together with the fence? When I introduced Nino to my other two boys, I had a temporary cage set up on the floor with a divider. When I come home from work I'd take away the divider, but I'll be there listening to them the entire time. Then I put it back up when I go to sleep. You could try an hour or so of supervised divider-free cage time everyday. How bad is it when they fight? Do they draw blood when they nip? I know it's heartbreaking, but you gotta let them fight it out. Stand by with a large blanket, if they fight bad enough, throw the blanket over them to temporarily stun them, then pick up one of them in the blanket. If the fighting is bad, don't reach in, you might get bit/scratched. There's a chance Giz and Stripe can live happily together in the cage, they just need to sort it out. Can try starting the cage time with a big pile of veggies in the middle so they're both distracted, they'll socialize a little while eating, and maybe that'll slowly transition to getting alone in the cage. hmmm let's see... during their outside time, you can try putting bits and pieces of their cage decor around them, see how they react. If they're still getting along, maybe conflict-free outside time among the home setting will eventually lead to conflict-free cage time because the similar decor will put them in the same mindset, but be careful with that, don't want it to train them the other way (to start fighting outside the cage too). I'm just rambling random ideas, not sure if any of them will work. If you end up trying again, good luck!"

guineapigs,39us6u,IMakeRandomNoises,5,Mon Jun 15 01:34:10 2015 UTC,"i think at first Nino licked my hand cuz of the salt too, and occasionally he would still do it for a really long time, but probably depends on how it's been since I've washed my hands.

I was wondering if you'd mind if I handled it for you?""  He buys the supplies, you look after them. The cage situation is tough.  There might be someone who has one you can get for free by checking on craigslist or a local community posting board.  The key thing you need to remember is you don't want to put him on the defensive because it could backfire and you still have to live with him.   Unfortunately, you can't take them or drop them off at your local humane society because he'll know you were the one who did it.

One way would be to open a dialog (as suggested above). In Germany, it is possible to report animal abuse to the veterinary inspection office. Ask you local vet about it, he should know more details about that option and give you contact data. This would be another way, but he will know it was you and he will probably despise you afterwards. But maybe you should keep this in mind, in case it gets worth and he starts to starve the two pigs, one of them gets sick or anything. Do you have permanent access to the pigs? Are they in the kitchen oder any rooms that are used by both of you? If not ask him to put them there, so you can have an eye on them :)"

I think you've either got to speak to him or his girlfriend. Depending on how close they are, if you can bring her round to the idea of how they should be looked after, he might do it for her?"

guineapigs,39vmc3,InnocenceMyBrother,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:07:56 2015 UTC,"It depends moreso on the personality of the pigs than their age. Granted, if you find a pig that's been alone for most of its life and it's about the same age, it might still be in a ""I've always been my own boss"" mentality. I would just set up pig dates and don't give up hope despite how tedious dating can be! It's definitely possible. Good luck!"
guineapigs,39uw44,dptx95,3,Mon Jun 15 00:09:18 2015 UTC,"One of my pigs does the same thing.  She's not a fan of being handled, and the teeth grinding lets me know she's annoyed with my attentions.  It's a less threatening version of the teeth chatter.  It could also indicate pain.  But in your case, it's more likely annoyance."

guineapigs,39uw44,Brynhild,2,Mon Jun 15 02:41:52 2015 UTC,"Is it a loud type? If its clearly audible like tooth chattering, it's a sign of annoyance. My pig does this when she wants to be put down.  If its a soft type of tooth purring, like how bunnies do, it's a sign of comfort. My pig does this when she's almost falling asleep on me while I'm petting her head."
guineapigs,39uw44,yellowpillow424,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:12:03 2015 UTC,"Our pigs make that chewing sound too.  It's a nice sound, so I don't think it's territorial.  Also, it happens after we pick them up, so I'd like to think that they just had some unfinished hay and pellets in their mouths and just happen to be munching."

guineapigs,39ujmm,Leiissha,3,Sun Jun 14 22:15:27 2015 UTC,They're all like this...  Mine have their own towels for cuddles so I don't have to keep changing my clothes :-P
guineapigs,39ujmm,MissMoo85,3,Sun Jun 14 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"Mine naturally potty trained themselves because they don't like going on me. Before I pick them up I open their cage. They run to the side and go to the bathroom. When I play with them I constantly let them kiss me. When their kisses turn to nibbles, it signals to me they are ready to go home. I can't take credit, they just started doing this. Once in awhile we still have accidents, and I think that is because my guinea is getting older, but for the most part, it seems to work."
guineapigs,39ujmm,emily1643,3,Mon Jun 15 00:46:39 2015 UTC,"Mine both stay out for 20-30 minutes before they have to potty, but the best way to ensure they don't have an accident is just to pay attention to their body language. My two current boys have been with me for six months and they've both had 1-2 accidents total in that time, which is great!  When they need to pee, they'll wiggle their butt down to the ground and start scooting backwards. When they need to poop, they'll tuck their butt downward and sort of drag it on the ground before pooping. If I see either of those behaviors starting, I'll immediately pick them up and put them in the cage.   I think this contributes to them being able to stay out longer, since they associate their bathroom behaviors with going back to the cage (and they love floor/bed time far too much to cut it short). But I'm sure it's less that they're trained and more that I know their body language well enough to avoid accidents!"

guineapigs,39ujmm,infinitecake,2,Mon Jun 15 17:30:33 2015 UTC,Guinea pigs have little bladders. I second the cuddle towels.
guineapigs,39ujmm,freakstop,2,Mon Jun 15 00:13:29 2015 UTC,It was always a mixed bag with our pigs. We had some that would hold it for quite a while if you had lap time (30min+) but we always had lap towels. Because of the constant nature of guinea pig feeding the pee/poo keeps flowing as well. We mostly just accepted it and they're quite hard to train to hold it.
guineapigs,39ujmm,Moar_Entropy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:53:25 2015 UTC,"Pig are like people, they're all different.  If you're tired of being peed-on, just wrap them in a towel when you have lap time.  My older pigs can be held for about 20-30 minutes before having to go back into the cage for some pee time, they don't poop at all when being held.  The two younger pigs can only be out for 15 minutes before they have to go potty, but normally they don't poop on us.  If they do pee on us, usually it's within a certain window of time when they had a special fresh veggie snack.  You might run some experiments and see what works for you and your pigs.  Good luck!"

My boars are messy, ill behaved, little jerks but I love them so much! Just once I'd like to be able to have floor time without a capture/release production. Potty training wasn't even this hard with my human son."
guineapigs,39r82y,princessaurus_rex,3,Sun Jun 14 04:46:39 2015 UTC,"Buy a cot mattress cover, the ones with the waterproof lining, and put that on your floor fluffy-side up. They don't like straying across boundaries, and then you can just shake the droppings off outside. Guinea pigs aren't meant to be potty trained, they're not built to hold their droppings for very long (that's why they poop in their sleep), but what are you using for their toilet when they're in?"
guineapigs,39r82y,is2gstop,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:02:27 2015 UTC,"Their cage is fleece two layers with puppy pad under their favorite poop places. They don't have free range floor time so under the c&c pack-n-play they have a sheet, carpet square or grass outside. They struggle when we bring them in and out of the cage but ultimately settle down being held. They cuddle just hate being picked up."
guineapigs,39r82y,princessaurus_rex,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:11:09 2015 UTC,"I've learned that pretty much all pigs freak out when they get picked up.

guineapigs,39t5zu,sammg37,6,Sun Jun 14 15:04:40 2015 UTC,"If it's just an AC fail and not an outage, fans are always an option. Some people wrap up bags of ice in towels for them to snooze next to or place ceramic tiles in the cage for them to lay on because they stay pretty cool. Is summer heat a significant issue where you are?"
guineapigs,39t5zu,pedrosanchezz,3,Sun Jun 14 15:20:00 2015 UTC,"Those are good ideas, yes I'm in New York actually but in July the summers can briefly get pretty brutal. The worst case scenario is an empty house all day, the Guinea Pig room would be closed with the a/c off due to brownout or circuit failure (any reason really). The temp would skyrocket fast. Even a wet towel won't last long as protection in that scenario I'm thinking.  I'm wondering how I can setup a separate, mini enclosure within the 5x5 c&c cage, a, thermally protected something that I can load up with blue-ice plastic packs in the morning before work for peace of mind, maybe even a small easily accessible mini ""pool"". Just as long as they can be cool in an emergency like that no matter how hot the room gets for the nearly 7hrs+ they might be alone on certain days"
guineapigs,39t5zu,sammg37,3,Sun Jun 14 16:37:52 2015 UTC,My pigges get a soda bottle full of frozen water to fall asleep against and lick when it all gets a bit too warm!   I also place a frozen bottle in front of the fan that serves the cage for a makeshift a/c.

guineapigs,39pe0z,castlecraver,2,Sat Jun 13 13:31:18 2015 UTC,I got a PM asking me a few things about the enclosure I built after posting the pics of Marshie and Penny last week.  Thought I would post some photos of it now that it's completely finished. The fleece is from Piggie Bedspreads and they're absolutely first rate. They particularly love the cuddle cone! The base is Coroplast and the wire grids were cut and bent with a wire cutter to form the custom parts (mainly the ramp).
guineapigs,39pe0z,i_am_ms_greenjeans,2,Sat Jun 13 13:36:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is really nice!  Love all the hidey-holes.  I bet they popcorn their happiness due to their living space.  Does it talk you a long time to clean?"
guineapigs,39pe0z,i_am_ms_greenjeans,2,Sat Jun 13 14:48:48 2015 UTC,"It's not too bad.. I have a dustbuster that's a dedicated ""poop-vac"" that I use every day. I'll disassemble (I just break it in half and move each piece to the side off the base), take the spreads off and launder those along with the cuddle cups once a week.  They're a very, very happy little couple. I still catch him rumblestrutting multiple times a day. They love to chase each other around and they snuggle up together most of the time when they're sleeping. His personality is pretty adventurous and frisky, so he doesn't mind being petted but she's a lot more reserved and doesn't like to be handled as much. She's muuuuch more chill though when he's in my lap together with her."
guineapigs,39pe0z,Ackis,2,Sat Jun 13 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.  I think it's sweet she wants to be with him during lap time.  I know you adopted her, do you think, after some time, she'll settle in and be more friendly with you?"
guineapigs,39pe0z,Macstaffer,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:39:23 2015 UTC,"Hm.. hard to say since I really don't know what her story was before she got to the shelter. But she comes out when she hears the fridge door and begs for food just like Marshie (actually she climbs up and chews on the enclosure a lot more than he does), she just doesn't particularly care for being petted and handled I guess. It's cool though and I dig it.. I'm kind of the same way myself (not much of a 'hugger,' etc). So I let her be most of the time. It's cool. However she's comfortable. She seems pretty happy."

If you have pigs, perhaps keep her cage where she can hear them and know she's not alone? Do your friends intend on getting another pig soon?"
guineapigs,39qgxn,kazulanth,2,Sat Jun 13 19:54:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks - yeah, that's a good idea, giving her view of our other pigs.   We can set up a floor corral with a dividing wall, so they can all see each other but can't get at each other (we've done it with these exact pigs and it worked pretty well). We haven't tried handling the visiting guinea pig yet, though -- we're kind of letting her get comfortable first.

guineapigs,39ejw4,jollyoctopus,3,Thu Jun 11 05:12:14 2015 UTC,Guinea pigs are prey animals so being on their backs is very distressing for them. You will find they stay still because it's an automatic response. They also have very inflexible spines and should never be on their backs because of the risk of injury.

guineapigs,39i3zc,nomorenoobtube,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:32:40 2015 UTC,Its cute but It makes me a bit sad when I do it because in only have a single pig and she gets so happy watching the others. I think I'm going to try and build her a new cage and get her a friend in the next few months.
guineapigs,39i6tf,SmaltedFig,3,Thu Jun 11 21:56:20 2015 UTC,"He's likely just scared due to the new environment. It can take a few weeks for them to come out of their shell, just be patient. It's actually surprising that Echo is immediately comfortable, I'm guessing he was handled by people more often and probably also has a more outgoing personality as well. Their reaction to being brought home depends a lot on their past experiences, and their actual personality might surprise you when it does come out. My first two pigs completely flipped personalities after 2 months. The bigger one seemed more curious and active at first and the little one would sit frozen in place all the time. But turned out the little one is so much more curious, has a lot of attitude, and is also very very vocal. The big one didn't really change his behavior at all, but now he seems like the quiet reserved one. :P Give it some time. Good luck!"
guineapigs,39i6tf,Abyssinius,2,Thu Jun 11 23:39:02 2015 UTC,"I actually picked Echo because he was the one in the litter that wasn't in a hide when I arrived and seemed most calm when I came near. I thought that if Echo (the bigger one) could show Dexter (a really little guy) the ropes, they'd both get along with one another and come to tolerate my girlfriend and I. Thanks for the insight and with any luck, Dexter will come out his shell in the near future"
guineapigs,39i6tf,theotherclairebear,2,Fri Jun 12 00:40:44 2015 UTC,Yeah Dexter is just a shy little guy. Sometimes it takes a little longer for them to come out of their shell. Maybe you can be nearby his cage/playpen and talk to him a bit more often so that he can get used to you?

guineapigs,39b0ww,Htownbitches,8,Wed Jun 10 15:12:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely ringworm.   You need some anti fungal spray or cream and it needs to be treated twice daily, topically applied.   Also, be careful, because all mammalian species can get ringworm including humans, and piggy will need to be isolated from any cagemates.   It will spread if left untreated and can cause some nasty and uncomfortable scabbing. Once treated successfully, hair will grow back normally.

Left untreated, it will continue to spread.  http://www.guinealynx.info/fungus.html"

guineapigs,39c4va,JustAmys,2,Wed Jun 10 19:41:27 2015 UTC,"My boys used to do that with my fleece liner. They'd get into the space between the fleece and the coroplast wall and make a little nest for themselves... You can seal off the opening, either by sewing some velcro pieces onto it or just use large binder clips to clip it shut. I prefer the binder clips for flippers, but if you're worried about them somehow hurting themselves on it (never happened with mine), then velcro may be the way to go, just more work for you. I had the liner attached to the wall by very strong velcro in a few places to keep it in place, but after that I added many more attachments to prevent the pigs from getting under it. I actually both added velcro and ended up clipping the liner to the coroplast wall with binder clips for extra security. They were distressed at the loss of their hiding place at first, but they got over it very quickly. Good luck!"
guineapigs,39c4va,Abyssinius,2,Wed Jun 10 20:25:01 2015 UTC,I'll try the clips first thank you so much!
guineapigs,39c4va,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,2,Wed Jun 10 23:09:15 2015 UTC,"Another tac might be to provide alternatives you know are safe. It is obviously filling some sort of need/desire for him to burrow so if you get a large PVC tube at Lowes, cover it in fleece, but leave some fleece trailing off the edge he can burrow through the tunnel or dig in the loose fleece without getting stuck."
guineapigs,39bm4o,firestar434,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:41:03 2015 UTC,"That may be the best option all around, with a few inch separation so they can't bite through the grate. Since piggies are especially vocal it will certainly be better than not having the second peeg at all."
guineapigs,39bm4o,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:55:23 2015 UTC,"I only have one data point about this but, what the heck ...   When we babysat a friends' guinea pigs, we decided to have them all ""meet"" each other. But we didn't want the whole rumblestrutting thing to happen, and we didn't want fights, of course.  So we tried what you suggested -- not a full C&C cage, but a corral on the floor with the same kind of grated walls, with a dividing wall in the middle. And everything was fine. Two of the piggies even ""met up"" at the wall - they kind of each approached and stood there side-by-side, with the wall between them.   No one tried to bite anyone or even get through the wall. It was interesting. Anyway, based on that one experience, I think your idea might work."

guineapigs,39960x,IdoWhatiwant69,5,Wed Jun 10 03:56:23 2015 UTC,"It's completely normal. As long as blood isn't being shed, let them work it out. They're just figuring out who's dominant between them. It's best to just introduce them once, rather than removing them constantly. Put them out on the floor with a couple piles of hay and fresh veggies. They'll chase each other and chatter a bit, eat, and resume. Unless they're going at each others throats and you see blood/huge tufts of fur, just keep an eye on them."
guineapigs,39960x,emiliah17,4,Wed Jun 10 07:16:09 2015 UTC,"Teeth chattering and rumble strutting is perfectly normal. They'll probably mount each other as well until dominance is established. Introducing the pigs and then separating them is going to make things more difficult. Let them work it out! If they actually start fighting (drawing blood), that's when you want to separate."

The second I set Graham down Ice Cream squirted something outward and I was like omg gross. >:| They went around sniffing each others ""areas"" walking in a circle. Eventually maybe 30min into meeting they just chilled out and started eating together. They laid down next to each other and looked okay. So after about an hour I put them in a freshly cleaned cage. They marked their scent on it and pop corned and chased each other, ate together, played. No signs of fighting, just lots of rumble strutting from Graham, haha. :]"
guineapigs,395eht,TheCryForum,2,Tue Jun 9 11:19:40 2015 UTC,Glad your piggies are happy.  Nice set up.  My pigs would try to see if pigs can fly by taking a diving leap off the upper level.  You might try to put something there - doesn't have to be the grid material.  You could use cardboard or rig up a triangular shape of fabric.  Something to act as a barrier.

guineapigs,396yv2,greendreen,2,Tue Jun 9 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"You should keep washing in very hot water. It's likely that the fleece is not entirely clean and is starting to gather bacteria due to the low temperature washes, even with detergent. And in case you're not already doing this, add a cup of your 1:1 water:vinegar mix to the wash and don't use fabric softener during wash or dry. Good luck!  Edit: also I only have to wash once a week and the smell is only evident around the last day before the wash. As long as you sweep up poop everyday the smell should be minimal. I've heard puppy pads are really good, but in case you want to try something different, u haul pads are great--very absorbent and keeps the smell down."
guineapigs,396yv2,Abyssinius,2,Tue Jun 9 19:40:22 2015 UTC,I'll start adding vinegar to the wash and do hot water. I feel like the puppy pads suck. They pee once and it goes right through the fleece and onto the pad and it just spreads everywhere. Should I fold the fleece in half or just have 1 layer? I don't use fabric softener just reg detergent with no smell or anything. I don't like the gel puppy pads because they are awkward and the gel gathers in spots and the cage won't be entirely covered
guineapigs,396yv2,Abyssinius,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:57:59 2015 UTC,"I've never tried puppy pads, maybe using puppy pads with fleece you need to set it up slightly differently. I have fleece over uhaul pads. The fleece covers the entire cage, but the uhaul pads are only at the edges ~6 inches wide and the corners have maybe 2 or 3 layers of a bigger square (~12""x12""), depending on if they spend a lot of time in that specific corner. Some people use multiple fleece layers, maybe it helps keep the top most layer dryer, but I've found the setup I have to be adequate. In the corners I have extra cushions for them to sleep on that I change out more often since mine are slobs that do their business wherever they're lying down..."
guineapigs,396yv2,i_am_ms_greenjeans,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"We use a combo - puppy pads under the fleece and then I have pads I made to go into the corners.  Those pads have an absorbent fabric within them and they actually work really well.  Those special pads are washed every other day (I have two sets, so I switch them out).  Vacuuming the poops every day makes a big difference, too.  I also wipe down any hard surface every day.  Cleaning the cage out like this once-a-day takes fifteen minutes.  Good luck!"
guineapigs,396yv2,vairuh,2,Tue Jun 9 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"Parsley and Cilantro make my boars very stinky. I notice their cage becomes offensive much more quickly when they eat these veggies. Maybe systematically rotate foods in and out to see if that makes any difference?  Also, do you have male pigs? If so, you might need to give them boar cleanings. WARNING GROSS! Here is an instructional video.  The boar cleanings are incredibly disgusting, but I found they made a HUGE difference in terms of the overall stinkyness of my piggies.   Good luck!"

Also make sure you know the space requirements guinea pigs need- they need lots of space and pet store cages are never adequate. This site sells c&c cages though you can buy the materials and make your own easily for less money. It is still worth it to check out the site and see how much space you will need. One pig should have a 2x3 c&c, and two pigs should have a 2x4 c&c, though bigger is always better!   Also makes sure you have timothy hay in your pig's cage at all times. They need unlimited access to it. Here is more info on diet stuff.   Guinea Lynx is a good source of info, so go check out their care guide :)"

guineapigs,397rkt,fuzzyfuzzyclickclack,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:18:22 2015 UTC,"I know there are plenty of people more qualified to give out information than me, but I can sure help.   You should be prepared to feed your guinea pigs with certain treats such as lettuce (not iceberg) carrots, cucumbers, etc. They can get hungry really fast, especially when they are energetic. Another thing to keep in mind is that you'll have to clean out their cage every week or so, so that they don't end up wallowing in their own poop. Also know that when cutting their claws/nails (whatever they're formally called), you need to be careful about hitting the vein. It can cause the pigs a lot of pain if you accidentally clip it. Depending on the personality of the guinea pig you get, they might enjoy running around A LOT. I had one named Jackie who would never stop unless she was eating or sleeping. It would be nice to keep in mind that they like their exercise.  This is all of the advice I can think of off the top of my head. If you do decide to get a guinea pig, good luck!

guineapigs,3970y9,121519122,7,Tue Jun 9 18:41:03 2015 UTC,"I adopted a pig in the same situation as you. He was alone for 3+ years (we aren't sure how old he is) and I took him in by himself. Another family asked if I wanted their female pig and I couldn't say no. She's much younger, maybe a year old. I kept them in separate cages before having him neutered then very slowly introduced them. Make sure it's in a neutral area, no smells from either pig or else they get territorial. After letting them get accustomed to each other I bought a bigger cage and put them both in. At first they bickered and it seemed like they HATED each other, I was so worried until I found out it was normal and my older male was establishing dominance. They are inseparable now. Always cuddling and eating together. I think it was a very good decision to get Moe a wife.   As for the cage, I have a 48√ó24 cage that I ordered for 40 bucks on Amazon. I can link it if you're interested. I've heard that's the MINIMUM cage size for 2 pigs.  But even if your worries outdo your want to get another pig, I think you're okay as long as you pay attention to her and give her as many cuddles and floor time as you said. When I first got Moe everyone said he'd be fine alone as long as I hung out with him a lot and he wasn't just sitting in his cage all day.   Good luck!"

It was the first time we witnessed her popcorning.  If you are concerned about getting another pig due to her age, you could get her a stuffed companion.  She might like a friend.  Someone mentioned on a different thread they put a mirror in the cage so the pig would think there was another pig with them.  Don't know if that would be successful."

guineapigs,391ajg,Coffeinated,-7,Tue Jun 9 01:01:55 2015 UTC,"As /u/Cthulhumorist pointed out, these bottles need a vacuum. It can drop a little at the beginning, after you fill them, but it shouldn't for longer periods of time. Watch the bottle; if there is air rising not where the pipe is but around it, the o-ring is defective. Does cleaning them like usual include the usage of a q-tip in the pipe?  Anyways, I don't use any bottles, as guinea pigs don't need to drink when they eat vegetables ;)"
guineapigs,391ajg,AsianInvasion113,4,Mon Jun 8 16:30:00 2015 UTC,I hope you're kidding
guineapigs,391ajg,Coffeinated,-4,Mon Jun 8 19:00:34 2015 UTC,"No. I had a bottle in the cage for a year, they never touched it. It's pretty common for guinea pigs that are fed with vegetables (and fruits) that they don't drink at all. A cucumber is like 95% water, maybe even more. Even sweet peppers contain that much."
guineapigs,391ajg,sammg37,5,Mon Jun 8 22:12:08 2015 UTC,"That's not a wise choice. You don't know if they'll become dehydrated for whatever reason (it happens to people and other animals, too!) and not be able to reach water. Though those foods are high in water - that I will not dispute - that doesn't mean they won't ever need more. Always better to have the option than not."
guineapigs,391ajg,Coffeinated,0,Mon Jun 8 22:29:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I figured if I forget to change the unused water daily and they drink some old water that would be pretty shitty too...  I also had water in an open bowl, they did not take a look at it but did all they could to throw the litter in there..."
guineapigs,391ajg,sammg37,3,Tue Jun 9 00:30:02 2015 UTC,"I don't change my pigs' water every day. Maybe every three days? Then again, I'll drink old water found in mystery bottles in my car that have been there for unknown amounts of time...I don't really believe ""old"" water is bad water (unless it's clearly dirty!)."
guineapigs,391ajg,Smiley007,2,Tue Jun 9 04:26:16 2015 UTC,"Old water is better than no water, and I change mine every day because something in it, I've always assumed sulfur, always makes it smell by the next night anyway, but every day is often not necessary. Bowls are really messy and not always successful, as you've found. I know my piggy just kicked it around and got crap in it, didn't drink much of any thing. Once I changed to a vacuum bottle though, there was no turning back. It's far far cleaner and she actually drinks out of it.  Finally, if you're concerned about forgetting it 1) again, doesn't need to be every day, and 2) I can only assume you've got some sort of feeding routine, it is not at all hard to incorporate water into it. And if you can't remember water (or food) for that matter, it becomes a question of if you should or can truly care for the guinea pig.  Fact of the matter is, you're doing a huge disservice to your pet if you deprive it of  water, an essential substance for life. Veggies are great, but you can't really rely on them solely as a source of water. What if you don't give enough veggies to accommodate the pig's water intake? What if you get caught out somewhere or out of veggies and can't give them to the piggy for a day or so? If you want to think of it like this, having that bottle is a nice back up, and your pig will know what it needs and take care of itself in that respect, with little maintenance by you. Please, just  do your little buddy a favor. It'll improve their lifestyle greatly with little work or cost at all to you."
guineapigs,391ajg,Coffeinated,-1,Tue Jun 9 12:43:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting how everyone here makes such a huge drama about this. Seems like the consensus in Germany is different than where you come from. Nearly every german website about guinea pigs states it is completely normal that they don't drink when they are properly fed, and that is what I do. If I understand you correctly, forgive me if I don't, you feed your pigs with ready-made dry food. In this case, you should rather think about that matter than about my water bottlex and read about how a guinea pig's digestive tract works... Again, forgive me if I misunderstood you, or if that was not correct english.  As I stated already, I have a bottle, I have just taken it out after it was ignored for over a year and more in the way than useful. They often touched it accidently with their behinds while eating hay, and I did not want a wet guinea pig."

What I've done is to put a full length mirror lying down lengthwise (I had one extra lying around, don't ask me why) in her play pen so there's ""someone else"" around. I've also got a small cuddly toy in there for her to keep her company.  Byte hasn't really been showing that many signs of loneliness so far. But she has been showing signs of age. Just about three weeks ago she had a bout of diarrhoea. Last week she had an eye infection and is showing signs of  slight paralysis in her hind legs, as in she kinda drags it along, but when you touch her legs, she does retract it, so it's not like she's lost all use of her legs.

guineapigs,38wvst,Return_of_MrSpanken,3,Sun Jun 7 15:00:48 2015 UTC,"If you do, you need to talk to them and comfort them a lot. My guinea pig was petrified during his first car ride and crawled into my jacket for the whole thing. His second car ride was in a cat travel thing (it was pretty big, but it had straps for carrying), it was filled with comfy stuff to lay on, some food, and his water bottle. I keep his water bottle on a little toy ladder anyways because they are free range, but I don't know what you plan to do for water...Anyways, he was pretty scared at first, but I kept talking to him and trying to include him a lot, which loosened him up enough to stretch out and fall asleep. When my pigs make noise, I say oink back at them and it has become a comforting thing for them; if you guys have any rituals it might help your piggy feel safe. If you aren't the driver, or someone will be driving with you, it would be super easy to comfort your piggy."
guineapigs,38wvst,lovecraftians_unite,2,Sun Jun 7 18:03:26 2015 UTC,"Great tips, thanks! I think I'm going to pick up a small animal carrier from my local pet store so that he can be a little more safe and comfortable; the cage seemed like a good idea at first but too risky now. I'll probably attach his normal water bottle to the carrier, even if I have to modify it a bit to make that work. Unfortunately it will be just the two of us the entire ride but that doesn't mean I couldn't stop for some cuddle breaks haha."
guineapigs,38wvst,Frida_P,2,Mon Jun 8 00:51:01 2015 UTC,"To be honest, yes.  I would already find that to long for you ;) However, if you have run out of options, it is definitely possible. The longest I have done was 4 hours on a train. There I was of course more in control than in a car, though. Other people regularly also ship guineas across borders between breeders, often also by car. So, if done correctly, it definitely works without issues.   Your addressed most concerns I could think of.  You have to make sure they are not overheating. Also, there needs to be constant supply of food and water as usual. Cucumbers are good if water is a problem.  I would strongly discourage anybody from transporting their pig in the cage itself. There are things that can fall on them and they can be thrown around quite a lot. I am sure you are not trying to cause any issues in the road, but they happen anyway. Guineas and their cage can then become very dangerous to them and even potentially to you.  I would suggest to have them in a small, but comfortable transport cage. They should be able to turn and take a couple of steps, stretch out and sleep comfortably, but not bigger than that.  There need to be regular breaks for checking up and perhaps some ""floor time"". If your whole cage fits in the car, that would be awesome for them to have a little roam around in known surroundings.   Your worries towards noise, music or the movements in general, I can't confirm. My guineas never cared where they were and ate - as long as there was some form of roof, they would happily munch away after the initial insecurity. There was no anxiousness at all. That surround depends on how skittish yours are, but mine are very independent spirits, but still are ok."

IMO, I'm not sure that's ever a good idea, even if you're sure your piggies won't run away. They're prey animals who've not ever had to deal with predators and other outside dangers, and it doesn't take more than a moment for something to happen. I'd personally be too afraid of them getting hurt or lost to let my piggies run outside unenclosed, and only with my full attention."

Of the 3 I've had, Ender was really good about following me around and chilling out, but didn't like lap time.  Shima was alright with being held, but would run to the nearest corner and stay there the entire time, when on floor time.  And Magnus, he doesn't like any human interaction at all.  He understands I feed him, but trying to touch him in any way, or even getting my hand close makes him run and hide.  They've all been reared the same, with the same amount of attention, they are just different piggies with different personalities."

guineapigs,38pvbf,areazel,3,Fri Jun 5 20:47:52 2015 UTC,"Getting one is fine as long as you can provide them with lots of attention but it's good to always consider getting another if you become too busy. Pet store cages are a no. Guinea pigs have requirements for cage size and pet store cages are like a shoe box. You want one so a 2x3 with suffice. A lot of people use c&c cages. It's grids and corrugated plastic they use for signs as a bottom. It's actually bigger and cheaper to purchase than the biggest pet store cages. You can go to http://www.guineapigcagesstore.com and purchase everything you need. Grids, connectors, and the plastic but you can also buy the plastic cheaper at your local lowes/home depot. You also have to decide if you want to buy $30 bedding however quick you go through it or fleece. Fleece looks expensive at first but you save in the long run. It's cheap to get it off amazon. You need to put towel or uhaul pads under it and it stays dry. You need to wash the fleece a few times for it to wick moisture. You won't need do laundry all the time and it saves you money. You also need to give your pig unlimited Timothy hay. Oxbow is a good brand and cheaper than kaytee. Pigs under six months can eat alfalfa and over need Timothy. Also they need Timothy based pellets after 6 months so they don't get too much calcium. They need veggies. Stuff like bell peppers have a lot of vitamin c which they can't produce on their own. There's dos and donts for veggies you can always do a quick search if you're worried. Not a lot of fruits and absolutely no bananas and it can constipate them. They need somewhere to hide to and some chews. Also make sure you have an exotic vet near by in case of health issues because something can pop up and it's urgent you get it checked out. It's expensive but that's the cost of a piggy. Regular vets really don't know jack about small pets. I think I covered most of it"
guineapigs,38pvbf,AsianInvasion113,3,Fri Jun 5 21:39:32 2015 UTC,"to add on to /u/AsianInvasion113 if you find the C&C cages a little expensive, a slightly lower cost option for up to 2 guinea pigs is the Midwest habitat. You can find it on amazon for $42.50 (free prime shipping if you're a prime member). This is pretty much the only commercial cage other than C&C's that's ok for guinea pigs. The minimum space requirement for 1 and 2 pigs is the same, so get 2 pigs if you can; the care is not more tedious.   Another thing I would be slightly worried about is that it seems the poster has a bunch of new babies in 4 different age ranges, which makes me believe they're home breeding their guinea pigs. From their tone in the post, it doesn't seem like they're a commercial breeder, so it's hard to say how experienced they are (even commercial breeders often mishandle pigs...). Make sure you look up signs of healthy piggies and check them over very carefully when you go pick up your pig. Also check to see if the guinea pig was sexed correctly, and if it looks female, check to see if it has been housed with sexually matured males. You don't want a new litter in a few weeks. I'm just a little hesitant trusting someone who has 11 new baby pigs on sale on craigslist from at least 4 different litters in recent weeks..."

The C&C cage uses storage cube grids and it's really whatever shape/size you make it to be, the C&C store online provides the most basic configurations, but if you look on this subreddit you'll find a lot of creative customized cages. C&C cages started out as a DIY trend for guinea pigs and rabbits, etc because commercial cages were really inadequate. It got popular enough that someone started the C&C cage store to make things easier for beginner piggie parents, but you can still approach C&C cage building with a DIY spirit since the materials are still easily sourced separately. I like the C&C cage better since it's much easier to dismantle and completely redesign using the same starting materials if you ever feel the need to expand, which I have done twice now. Hope that made sense."
guineapigs,38pvbf,Abyssinius,2,Fri Jun 5 23:20:48 2015 UTC,"It always seemed like the Midwestern was better just because of the price, but I never noticed the walls. I think they are also expandable, but they definitely don't have an endless amount of possibilities like C&C. Thanks for elaborating on things, though I should have noticed the difference! I was planning on buying the materials from different sites than the one dedicated to C&C because some things are priced rather high (probably because it's no longer a simple DIY, but a popular, more adequate alternative)...my guinea pigs are free range because my older pig is well behaved and needed freedom to trust me (he is a senior from a bad home).

Water, and let it grow! The tray is low enough to the ground that my girls can crawl in and out of it freely during playtime, and it makes a wonderful foraging grass treat. :)"

I don't know if this would work for you.  If my memory is correct, they kept it in their apartment because it wouldn't otherwise survive."

The grass is longer there anyways. :) I can't imagine using sunscreen on them without it either being too greasy, it irritates their skin, or it irritates the other pig when they go to lick at each other."

guineapigs,38m7il,romm22,2,Fri Jun 5 12:59:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks. The biopsy results indicated it was an aggressive form of lymphoma.   We had taken him for a wellness check-up two weeks ago, and the vet commented how healthy and great he looked for 5.5 years. Two days later, he couldn't close his mouth, eat well, or blink. We took him to three different vets (they initially suspected a tooth problem) before they did a CT scan and found all his lymph nodes swollen. He went downhill really quickly from there, so it didn't seem like any treatments would help. :-("

guineapigs,38nxyo,queenborealis,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:56:59 2015 UTC,"We think this is what happened to one of my pigs - came home one day and she had a big grey patch on her eye with a scratch in the middle, probably caused by hay or possibly her own toenail. We gave her eye drops and painkillers, but it was a really bad cut and she ended up having to go into surgery to have her eye removed after it ruptured. Being a very small and elderly piggie she didn't survive the anaesthetic :'( I wish I could give you some more positive news! We were told that eye injuries are very common in guineas and usually heal well with no lasting impact on their vision, I think it was just a very bad case. The vet also couldn't tell if there was still hay in there, if there was it might have contributed to the eye rupturing - so the fact that you managed to get the hay out is great, hopefully her eye can heal now. Good luck, I hope she gets better soon!"
guineapigs,38nxyo,horsefish5,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:06:32 2015 UTC,"All the time... Mine were all fine though, took a few weeks to return to normal. You could always sift the hay before they get it, that would remove the smaller and more menacing pieces."
guineapigs,38nxyo,is2gstop,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:26:54 2015 UTC,"Literally happened to my Joan last night. The end of the hay was poking out of the corner of her eye, so I grabbed it with tweezers and pulled the rest out. She was/is totally unfazed.

Later, we got Diligentia, and that time, they told us they only sell males, so now we were definitely confused and I found out how to sex them properly and found out myself they were both males. Well that's good, won't be having any unexpected babies, but now they're stuck with these kinda feminine sounding names. However I have changed Acedia's name to Arcadia due to confusion about if Acedia was pronounced ""uh-seed-ia"" or ""uh-sid-ia"". As for Diligentia however, not sure.   Acedia, is Latin for ""Sloth"", one of the seven deadly sins, and also one of my favorite songs by deadmau5.  Diligentia, is Latin for ""Diligence"", one of the seven virtues, and also opposite of Sloth.  I made them opposites, because they have almost opposite amounts of black and white on their fur."

I realised that most of the poop is where they eat their hay so what I now do is i have a large cat litter tray filled with wood pellets and I put the hay on top. So they jump into the box and eat hay and most of their poop is contained. Also there is way less hay mess everywhere too!   One of my piggies does still make a point of doing her poops right next to the litter box tho. Bless. She did it before with the smaller box too. She is silly."
guineapigs,38ilur,still-searching,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:55:49 2015 UTC,"At this stage, I have no idea.  I was hoping they'd use that area as a potty, but, I also wanted to contain the Timothy Hay mess.  They've only resided in the NPP for a few days, so time will tell.  I made pee pads out of fleece and a product called Zorb (Wazoodle Fabrics).  Those pads are on the main floor (the purple/flower pattern).  I have a second set so I can wash them while the others are in the cage.  The product is marketed for people who wish to make their own reuseable diapers and feminine products, so it is meant to go between two layers of fabric."
guineapigs,38ilur,caffeineassisted,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:16:41 2015 UTC,"Zorb apparently works great. Did you get it online? I've wanted to buy it but it seems expensive with shipping so I'm currently just quilting 2 layers of cotton batting between  microfiber fabric for my piggies cages.   I'm also totally not trying to discourage you, but I tried felt and it didn't really work for me :/ I really wanted it to because its cheaper and I liked the thickness, but it doesn't really wick like fleece or microfiber. It just  looks like it does because it spreads the liquid out but the wetness get stuck in the felt layer and didn't really make it to the absorbent core. It also really doesn't wash well and hay/fur will never come off and it pilled a lot. It also can't go in the dryer from my experience or it will melt.    Let me know how it works for you though, since different brands may work better. I used  a Joann's charcoal gray remnant to do the wicking and washing test."
guineapigs,38ilur,caffeineassisted,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:54:31 2015 UTC,"This is my first time with Zorb, so we'll have to see how it goes.  I'm not too concerned about washing it - seemed straightforward as long as I don't bleach it.  The fleece was prepped (took more washings for the pattern fabric than the solid color) so it wicks away the pee.  I've tried cotton batting, just didn't like how thick it was and the pigs didn't like to walk on it.  I'm glad you've had some success."
guineapigs,38ilur,BeniAzuma,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:45:31 2015 UTC,"Wait, I'm confused. Fleece and felt are different. Which one are you using in the cage? It looked like the grey fabric was felt, not fleece. (I also thought that because of the person's comment above, sorry if that was wrong.) You are right, fleece wicks great and can be put in the dryer."
guineapigs,38ilur,still-searching,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:15:56 2015 UTC,"It's a gray fleece.  My husband picked it up from Joann's fabric in December, it's a really robust fabric.  I've never tried felt, my personal experience is more for crafting than for pigs.  :)"
guineapigs,38ilur,RobotPigOverlord,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:55:33 2015 UTC,Oooh! I'd never heard of that before! Thanks for the tip. I think a large litterbox with hay in it might be a good place to start.

Had to order more of the grid pieces because we mis-counted, and are considering adding another level.  It's great fun to watch them move about the cage."

guineapigs,38l20e,-PaperbackWriter-,3,Thu Jun 4 22:19:26 2015 UTC,"If anything, take her off veggies for a few days and see if it fixes the problem. If she's still having runny poops, take her to a vet."
guineapigs,38l20e,MGhazi,3,Thu Jun 4 22:38:14 2015 UTC,Was it iceberg? That has a lot of water and can give pigs diarrhea
guineapigs,38l20e,AsianInvasion113,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:18:41 2015 UTC,"It was iceberg, it wasn't very much though, she's eaten more than that in one go in the past... I'll give her until tomorrow and if she's not better I'll take her to the vet."
guineapigs,38l20e,sammg37,3,Fri Jun 5 01:25:08 2015 UTC,"Iceberg is most likely the culprit - too much induces some nasty diarrhea. Just keep an eye on her, and give her lots of hay!"
guineapigs,38l20e,AsianInvasion113,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:47:20 2015 UTC,That's a good idea
guineapigs,38l20e,lovecraftians_unite,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:27:43 2015 UTC,"If your piggy has been eating lots of iceberg, she may not be getting enough nutrients for everyone. She could have diarrhea because she isn't eating enough ""real"" food to counter the high water content of the iceberg. This will be a quick fix if iceberg hasn't been a regular food in her diet, hopefully not a large part of her veggie consumption either. If you haven't already, feed her some alfalfa hay and offer more pellets (add vitamin c supplement if she doesn't eat oranges), as well as nutritious veggies. Try not to feed iceberg lettuce unless you absolutely have to, and try to avoid the crunchy, lighter parts; the leafy part is best. Iceberg lettuce isn't necessarily healthy, not even for humans, as it doesn't have much to offer once broken down; it's more of a filler food. If she ate iceberg for daily veggies frequently, even before she was pregnant, she will need more nutrition than other pregnant piggies. I can't recommend enough that you give her lots of alfalfa hay even if she hasn't regularly eaten iceberg."
guineapigs,38l20e,lovecraftians_unite,2,Fri Jun 5 23:34:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even know where to get alfalfa hay around here, we don't have a pet store locally. I have a seed/hay/pellet mix I got from the vet in the nearest city, so hopefully that's meeting her requirements. She doesn't love it but she eats it. She won't eat oranges or any fruit really. She really just wants green veggies, but her diarrhoea stopped yesterday so I gave her celery and it came back, so I think we have to avoid the watery green vegies."
guineapigs,38l20e,lovecraftians_unite,2,Sat Jun 6 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"I think you can order alfalfa offline; you will also need it for the babies once they are weaned, until they are six months. Oxbow makes an alfalfa based pellet, which you also need. Alfalfa has potassium and calcium. If she does not eat kiwi either, you should get vitamin c drops and put them in the pellet food; she will need quite a bit of vitamin c to avoid toxemia.The seed mix that you have sounds fine, as seeds are also fattening, but this definitely isn't enough. I agree that maybe watery greens aren't the best thing until her intestines are more stable. Celery is a good source of fiber though, which helps to prevent hair loss during their pregnancy; once alfalfa hay and pellets, vitamin c, and leafy greens are keeping her healthy, celery will be great for her. Lastly, if she is older than 6-8 months, she might need extra care and supervision to make sure she and the babies are all okay."

The wire bottom level is not suitable for hamsters as it can give them bumble foot and the bars seem too wide apart for mice or gerbils.  Anyway, it is far far far too small. Immediately you can take out the wheel and second ""level"" to at least double the space, but asap you need to get your piggie a cage that's at least 27"" x 41"" but preferably bigger since she is having babies and I assume you'll be keeping at least one of the babies as a friend for her if there is a girl baby (guinea pigs shouldn't be kept alone)."

He then has the rest of the run which is big enough for 3 - 4 piggies. Far right section which you can't fully see is the same size as a 2 by 3 C&C the part in the middle is about the same as a 2 by 2.5.   He doesn't get floor time because our dog is inside most of the time and when she isn't he just runs under the couch.

guineapigs,38bc4g,kendalkjd,4,Wed Jun 3 02:51:06 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't want to just use any blanket, it's fleece specifically. If you prepare the fleece properly by washing it 3 (probably more) times the fleece will wick moisture. Under the fleece you have an absorbent layer of something like towels, puppy pads, or Uhaul pads (or a combo- I use towels and then puppy pads in their favorite pee spots). If prepared/used correctly the pig pee will be wicked straight through the fleece to the layer underneath so the top of the fleece will stay dry. You also need to sweep the pig's poop up once a day or as needed. I do a full fleece/towel change once a week, and switch the puppy pads out about every other day. I like using fleece over wood shavings, which is what I used before, but some people find it to be too much work. It's really a personal preference... but I like to think my pigs prefer fleece over shavings :)"
guineapigs,38bc4g,whiterabbit108,2,Wed Jun 3 06:42:39 2015 UTC,"My guinea pigs tend to be picky--which can be explained by me spoiling them for the most part--but they are picky about their fabrics. I use fleece, but it is soft and kind of fluffy; if they could talk, they would say, ""Oh no no no, this just won't do!"", about normal fleece. Maybe it's because I started with a different fleece than normal...I don't know, but this is the only texture they will sleep on (when they have to sleep in their area). It works fine, not as wonderful as normal fleece, but whatever makes them happy and gets the job done. I used to use paper bedding (in the two weeks they had a cage) and it was so easy to clean, but I didn't have money to buy it so often. Using a small amount didn't meet the pigs' standards so I had to use a lot, for fluff. All in all, fleece is way cheaper and easier in the long run; I wash their blankets/fleece every week and vacuum their incredible amounts of poop every day (every other day if I really have to). Keeping up with fleece maintenance is really the only ""hard"" part about it."
guineapigs,38bc4g,lovecraftians_unite,2,Wed Jun 3 12:27:09 2015 UTC,I used bedding when I first got them and then switched to fleece because I read they liked that. They didn't seem to particularly notice and I found the fleece to be much more difficult to maintain and it started smelling quickly as well. I was having to clean their cage 2-3x/week with the fleece versus 1x/week with bedding so I switched back. I think it's just a personal preference!
guineapigs,38bc4g,FelixFelicis23,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:22:10 2015 UTC,"I have exactly the same experience and result. I just wanted to add that there is not just one type of bedding out there.  Wood shavings are cheapest, but also messiest. They work medium well, so are a good solution altogether.  There is wood bedding that looks more like tiny blocks than shavings. Those things don't produce as much dust and also take up more liquid and last therefore longer. However, they are a bit hard. So I tend to use them in combination with a soft later on top - perhaps even shavings.  By far the most points in generally being awesome are awarded in my household to paper bedding. The main brand appears to be carefree, but there are others. It sucks literally twice as much liquid as wood shavings, stays try to the touch on its surface while doing so, doesn't produce any dust, is soft and there is no smell. The downside (and there has to be one), is the quite high price in comparison with the others. With its advantages, though, I totally think it to be worth it."

guineapigs,38b5go,Lawful_Goblin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:26:19 2015 UTC,We used wood chips and some pellets as bedding which we changed in part about once or twice a week and which we completely renewed every week. Sprinkling a bit of vinegar essence on their pee spots on the plastic and rinsing it off in the bathtub or shower keeps it from smelling.
guineapigs,38b5go,aerial_flip,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:54:52 2015 UTC,"I just commented on another thread. There somebody had bad, smelly experiences with fleece with the guineas not even being particularly fond of it. Happened to me exactly like that too.  I have the cage lined watertight, so I can wash it. There are some plastic inlays for toilet corners. The first layer is newspaper, then a mixture of paper and cubed wood bedding of about 1,5cm. Hay is added on top and slowly accumulates as an additional layer until the next cleaning.  And cleaning is scooping it up. My cage is too big for your solution - or the garbage bags in our country too small - but it sounds very handy. I use my newspapers a bit in the same fashion,  but not as effective.   My short summary of bedding in that other thread was this:   I have exactly the same experience and result. I just wanted to add that there is not just one type of bedding out there.  Wood shavings are cheapest, but also messiest. They work medium well, so are a good solution altogether.  There is wood bedding that looks more like tiny blocks than shavings.

There is also a big problem with babies, in that it is very likely the mother will die in labour, guinea pigs are not very good at giving birth and you absolutely must not try to help (often their uterus will prolapse, and if you pull on that thinking it's a baby...). If she survives through some miracle, there is a good chance she will then kill and eat her babies.  Guinea pigs can also breed from a very young age, and so within a matter of months you could easily have a hundred.  In all honesty, don't do it."

You really should avoid babies at all costs not only for aforementioned reasons but also because you would be tasked with getting rid of the babies once weaned... It's like risking your current girls' lives for no reason, and if you were planning on breeding then that's a whole other story.

guineapigs,3863rf,HeatherD92,5,Tue Jun 2 02:57:47 2015 UTC,Same thing happened with my group of 3 males one being father. After like 5-6 months the little one and the father started fighting. You need to separate them right away or they can hurt/kill each other. Check the bites because they go deep. Sadly if they fight you can't ever leave them together again. Even when I pick one up after I handled the other one they chatter cause they can smell their hair on me. It's a territorial male thing that can happen. Maybe cause it is 3 pigs together I don't know just make sure you separate them.
guineapigs,3863rf,Dharmabum12,3,Tue Jun 2 04:27:35 2015 UTC,"We put a partition in the cage to keep them apart. The bites weren't too bad, we disinfected them and put some ointment on them right away. They can see each other through the partition, and they haven't chattered since we put in the partition, but they have smelled each other a couple times. Maybe there's hope :c but we probably won't ever leave them alone together after this."
guineapigs,3863rf,Dharmabum12,3,Tue Jun 2 06:31:05 2015 UTC,"Awesome! That is a really good idea with the partition, at least hey can see each other.I had to do that with the males and females. I have 5 total pigs."
guineapigs,3863rf,schkibberd,2,Tue Jun 2 08:11:24 2015 UTC,"Sadly if they fight you can't ever leave them together again.   That's piqued my curiosity as I was chatting to a friend the other day about this. He has two younger boars, I believe he said they were just over one, they were yet to be nuetered and had started squabbling infrequently. Could they still not be left together after neutering?"

guineapigs,386203,Pignamedpig,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:04:20 2015 UTC,"Mine are mostly litter trained--they will poo in their cozies where it's dark, but typically do not pee outside their litter box unless the litter is due for a cleaning. I started training mine right when I got them by using the same recycled paper bedding as the place I had got them from used, that way they felt safe going there. I also use a big tray (it's actually a drawer from a plastic organizer that I got at the thrift store) and put their hay rack over it, a small pile of hay and food bowl in it; piggies do most of their business while eating it seems! Kind of gross that it's a kitchen and a bathroom, ahaha. I would also suggest covering the area where you are keeping your litter (I draped a towel over the corner of the cage) so that it feels like a good, safe place for them to go. And spot clean--put their stray poos in the litter tray. Hope this helps--good luck and be persistent!"

guineapigs,3853z5,AsianInvasion113,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:36:18 2015 UTC,"The smoke smell is from previous tenants. The summer house is set up to be liveable, it has electric & water and apparently the previous owner had her elderly mother - who definitely went through a couple of packs of cigarettes a day from the smell in there - living in there. So it's not a smoke presence, just a residual smell, we're trying to air it and have given it a top to bottom clean already, but it's clearly pretty sticky, it'll likely need re painting.   Sadly as I write, the house itself is being painted in just about every room barring the one we have our belongings in, so there's no better alternative indoors - yet."

In the beginning they didn't like it at all, but eventually their recovery time went from 3-4 days to essentially a few minutes. If you've moved yours for the first time, it'll take more than a few days for them to adjust. I would give them at least 5 days to fully settle in, then consult a vet if necessary.

guineapigs,384jhm,sgtlobster06,2,Mon Jun 1 20:20:26 2015 UTC,When I got my baby Gizmo only six months after my old one passing I was overwhelmed. He was so hyper and very scared of me. I was used to my old one falling alseep on me. Be patient they'll get used to you and want to be petted. Definitely the required cage size for one 2x3 so they can act out that energy as well
guineapigs,384jhm,AsianInvasion113,2,Mon Jun 1 21:42:06 2015 UTC,I have to say I'm really impressed you got your old buddy to fall asleep on you! How long had you had him until he started doing that? Do you have any techniques for getting a guinea to trust you so much? He sounds like a great friend. I'm sorry you lost him.
guineapigs,384jhm,euendo,3,Tue Jun 2 05:44:11 2015 UTC,Well I think a little story of Oreo helps so sorry if long. I've never planned a guinea pig. I was 11 and me and my mom went to the pet store just browsing. Well little Oreo there is in a fish tank all by himself. The owner lied said nothing was wrong. He had lice. Well anyway I knew how to make guinea pig sounds from my previous guinea pig. We adopted him from a family with wild kids and dogs and the poor thing never bonded with me. So I'm wheeking at Oreo and he talks back and comes up to me. I'm like mom we have to get him. I'd name him Oreo. I begged she likes ok only if you clean your room. So we paid and left without him. She turned around we weren't leaving him. Well when we got home I sat outside feeding him grass and I hand fed him pellets. He had a rabbit cage so he did run a lot. We made quite a few mistakes just because there wasn't ready information then. I don't remember how long it took for me to realize Oreo followed me outside. But we went for block walks and kids told me he was going to have a heart attack. I walked backwards and had him at decent pace following me. It wasn't long. I brought water outside and we'd hang out together in the grass all day playing and eating. He even cuddled me at a few months old. The breeder must've handled them often but even Gizmo will cuddle for a bit. I gave them lots of attention outside time. I had big changes in my life then and Oreo was my comfort. I take them out everyday for a pet and sometimes I lay down and they do too on my chest. Poor little Oreo only made it to five years old living in a pet store cage. He had a dried over eye a random dog vet told us was glaucoma but I'm thinking not these days. And he had issues going to the bathroom himself :/ now that I know all the information I feel so awful Oreo had to live that life. The last two years of his life he'd lay on my chest and fall asleep. He'd twitch sometimes and I had to wake him up. I took a lot of pictures of it. Maybe I'll post. But I think the whole point is I gave them reasons to trust me and I made sure they knew who I was. It took a month for Gizmo to come out his shell and now he's so friendly everyone can't help but love Fluffy Giz. Stripe I got as adult I think he's around the same age as Giz. He licked me that's why I got him. He was very skiddish never let me pet him. But making the changes to bigger cage and everyday pets they will get used to you. Especially love you if you give them their favorite vegetable. Stripe begs for bell peppers even though he ate his and Gizmos. Just time and patience and food. That was all over the place sorry about that

guineapigs,384jhm,FrolickingBeans,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:27:12 2015 UTC,Well the one thing I would say that everyone will disagree with here is that you can just have ONE piggy.  If you do though you have to really be its best friend. We are getting another one once our new cage comes that can fit two.  And figure out what veggies and treats your pig likes. They all have different preferences and tastes. So what one loves his buddy might hate.   Glad you get to have a piggy after so long!
guineapigs,384jhm,GrilledChilledCheese,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"The problem with getting a ""friend"" for your pig is not all pigs are friendly to others. And you always have to introduce them slowly so they can establish their pecking order without fighting. Yes, guinea pigs have pecking orders, I had an incident were I removed one pig from the enclosure and the other two brawled. Also, not all veggies are pig-safe. I usually feed carrots, apple, mint leaves, cilantro, and cucumber. On rare occasions I also feed watermelon, pineapple and pumpkin (at least those are all the sweets I can think of  right now. I suggest doing research and asking the previous owner what they fed. Good Luck!"
guineapigs,3857ra,Butt_Hurt_Toast,3,Mon Jun 1 23:03:34 2015 UTC,I've noticed this with a lot of pet store pigs. They weren't held a lot right after birth so they're more skittish. My piggy I got from the pet store took a couple of months to eat out of my hand. But after six months she stopped running in the cage when I went to pick her up. I think she will calm down soon. Just give it time and you will earn her trust.
guineapigs,3857ra,FrolickingBeans,3,Tue Jun 2 02:24:24 2015 UTC,"It will take some time for your pig to become more comfortable. The first pig I ever owned was adopted from a pet store. He acted pretty much the same way... never leaving his little hidey, scared of everything. I felt so bad for the little guy, and after doing more research found out that having a buddy may help him feel more comfortable. 2 weeks or so after getting the first pig we got a second pig and the difference in the first pig's behavior was dramatic. He was clearly more comfortable, coming out of his hidey and eating with his new buddy. We've always kept pigs in pairs (we actually have 3 now!) since then.  The newest baby we have now would not eat veggies for almost a month after we adopted him. He would sniff them occasionally but mostly ignore them. He eventually must have decided to try them because he will eat all kinds of veggies now, but he does eat slower than our other two pigs for some reason.   But anyway, just be patient.. your pig will warm up to you eventually :) It'll probably take longer without a friend for your pig, but just be persistent with doing lap time and or even just hanging out near her cage and talking to her so she gets used to you."
guineapigs,3857ra,whiterabbit108,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:01:14 2015 UTC,I'd like to know this too.  I just adopted one and she's acting the same way.  I'm hoping it's just getting used to the new surroundings.  Let me know if you have any progress with yours!

She just huddles in corners if her igloo isn't in her cage.  She's shy, but very sweet.  I'm getting her a bigger cage and hopefully with that she'll explore a bit more.  It's a little nerve wracking when they just kinda freeze and don't come out.  I think I worry too much.  We just want to do what's best for our little fur babies."

guineapigs,380uyz,AsianInvasion113,4,Mon Jun 1 01:58:13 2015 UTC,"It's true, i think they have high rates of neglect especially when it comes to medical care, because its 'just a rodent'. it seems like rodents are more likely to be frivolously bought and then left to die than a larger animal"
guineapigs,380uyz,AsianInvasion113,4,Mon Jun 1 06:01:44 2015 UTC,I went to the pet store to buy some food and saw a couple carrying the smallest cage they had talking about guinea pigs. I had to tell them they need more room! The couple was shocked that someone was even talking to them. The guy was like they're a shoe all they do it lie there. Well if you give them a space they will run and jump.. They left and came back saying in was right and they were wrong. Then they grabbed the next big size which is only a few inches bigger on each side. I told them one at least needs a 2x3 space! They're like no no it's a shoe they're low care. My boyfriend told me to drop it. It pisses me off how people may love their guinea pig but when given the correct information they're like no guinea pigs can't possibly need that much space.. They claimed they had a big cage but downsizing because their ferret kept attacking the pig. Well maybe that's why the pig stays in one spot because he's scared.. I wanted nothing more than to help the piggy but all I could do was give up because people don't see small animals as important and needing special care. I was upset

We got rid of them quickly. Wish I could have them, I love them, but they're way to aggressive to own with any sort of prey animal imo."

Over Memorial Day weekend I was at a Rest Stop really late like 2 am and there was a dog there a small white one. I couldn't tell if he was abandoned or not but he kinda looked it. But if he wasn't I didn't want to like steal him. Anyway it ended up being I didn't take him and he in fact was abandoned I found out later by the food and water and bed people had put out for him. I regret not helping him and now have no idea where he ended up. But I can't let it run my life. Things happen and we learn from them. We can't beat ourselves up.

guineapigs,37wylk,nerdnails,8,Sun May 31 02:23:38 2015 UTC,"The guinea pig cages store is a good place to check out to get an idea of the size of cage your piggie should have. Guinea pigs feel much more comfortable and are much happier when they are kept in pairs. The recommended cage size for one guinea pig is 7 sq feet, or a 2 grid by 3 grid C&C cage if you checked out the website I linked above. A 2x4 is recommended for 2 pigs. So yeah, before you go out and buy a cage or buy supplies to build your own c&c cage try to decide whether or not you'll be getting your pig a buddy.  When I got my first pig years ago I did not know that they were so social and did better in pairs, so I only initially got one. After a couple of weeks our first pig was still so scared and just sat around and hid all day, so I did some more research and found out he was probably lonely. I adopted a buddy for him as soon as I found that out, which also meant I needed a bigger cage. He was much happier afterward though, so it was worth it!  So yeah, just plan out what you will do ahead of time :) If you work a lot it would probably be better to adopt a second pig, plus it is so much fun to watch them interact with each other!   Also, it is far cheaper to build a nice big c&c cage if you buy the materials yourself. the guinea pig cages store is great, but expensive. You could build a 2x4 c&c cage (with no base) with one pack of these grids and a sheet of coroplast which you can find at HomeDepot sometimes or a sign shop... So you could make an awesome appropriately sized cage for $40.. way cheaper than a pet store cage, and far bigger! Some people even use a shower curtain instead of coroplast which is even cheaper. You can find tutorials on you tube if you decide to go the c&c cage route :)    Good luck with your new piggie!"
guineapigs,37wylk,whiterabbit108,5,Sun May 31 05:45:31 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm looking forward to getting her a nice cage instead of the makeshift bin shes in now.
guineapigs,37wylk,giraffe_bunnies,7,Sun May 31 05:48:57 2015 UTC,"If she still seems skittish after she has a place to hide and gets used to you, perhaps try putting her somewhere elevated. My pigs didn't like being on the floor so I put them up on a coffee table and they didn't seem to get so scared if I caught them off guard - I read that it's because they're used to predators coming from above.   If you haven't already, check around her ears for mites. I got my pigs from a pet store and they scratched like crazy, poor things were miserable and the store had no idea there was a problem.   The veggie and fruit thing is super important because they can get scurvy.   If you notice her wheezing or coughing, try changing her litter if you're going that route, my boys did well with pine but better with the recycled paper kind."
guineapigs,37wylk,ladyh0rrible,3,Sun May 31 03:59:47 2015 UTC,"this is good advice. it's nice that you work at the clinic; if she does have mites, you can use straight topical ivermectin to make them go away if the vets have it...Just NOT any of the frontline/advantix stuff! Straight ivermectin. I keep a bottle handy for my pigs, you just have to dose it by her weight..."
guineapigs,37wylk,meowzzzies,7,Sun May 31 04:14:36 2015 UTC,"the nice thing is that the company that owns the clinic I work at owns a clinic that also does ""exotics"" so I can get an employee discount."
guineapigs,37wylk,Coffeinated,2,Sun May 31 05:10:47 2015 UTC,thank you for the tips. we didnt see any mites on her at the time but i will be getting her into a vet that knows piggies for a check up soon. im going grocery shopping in the morning for her too :)
guineapigs,37wylk,afilthyhorrorshow,13,Sun May 31 05:04:51 2015 UTC,"Get her some good food! none of the stuff with all the coloured bits and pieces. The best out there is the Oxbow esssentials. Lots of hay (timothy hay is the most popular), make sure she also has a hiding area especially if you just got her she will feel safer in a little hut. Provide her with fresh veggies on the daily (lettuce, carrots, etc.) you can google a list to make it easier.  edit: hay should be in constant supply!   Those are the most important things off the top of my head right now. This website helped me a lot when I was first getting started :)  http://jackiesguineapiggies.com/  Hope this helps!"

guineapigs,37wylk,MortusEvil,2,Sun May 31 03:01:09 2015 UTC,"actually, the best food for guinea pigs are vegetables, and hay of course."
guineapigs,37wylk,theAmazingPlanktopus,5,Sun May 31 20:25:05 2015 UTC,"Lots of space to roam and explore. Remember to have a large enclosure, they dont stay that small for long.  Socializing and handling is also key in having a friendly happy guinea pig, also helps with timidness and anxiety in the long run. Guinea pigs are rather slow to warm up in new environments, patience is key when socializing them. Exploring and roaming is a great way for them to gain confidence.   Good luck with your new little baby!"
guineapigs,37wylk,Warneral,5,Sun May 31 03:16:29 2015 UTC,Thank you for taking her in.

guineapigs,37wylk,weez09,5,Sun May 31 15:33:01 2015 UTC,"To expand on this, op, their spines are very delicate so the running wheels and the plastic balls that people get for hamsters and such are not ok for piggies. They still need exercise though, so at petco they sell little small pet play pens. Get two, you can connect them and make a big area for them. Lay down a big fleece blanket to catch pees and poos. Without adequate exercise, the muscles around their anus can atrophy when they get older and they can become impacted with poo. It usually only happens to males but still very possible for females. Plus exercise enriches their lives and prevents obesity and its related diseases like diabetes."
guineapigs,37wylk,kahvi_4,5,Sun May 31 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"My Mary really likes her hay switched up from time to time. Timothy hay is the standard, but others like orchard grass or Meadowgrass are some of her favorites.  Also keep an eye on her nails, Mary is a fat old lazy blob that only moves if I bring her a carrot, so her nails need to be trimmed about once every month or so.  They make amazing pets, you will love her!"
guineapigs,37wylk,theAmazingPlanktopus,6,Sun May 31 06:29:29 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up (it caught me unawares when I first got mine), if you see them eating their droppings, they do that."
guineapigs,37wylk,is2gstop,2,Sun May 31 09:41:31 2015 UTC,omg...weird? is that unhealthy?!
guineapigs,37wylk,is2gstop,6,Sun May 31 13:23:41 2015 UTC,"No, they actually have to do that to stay healthy. It's called copryphagia. Similar to chewing on cud like cows do. With regards to vitamin c, my vet told me either drops or tablets are best since carrots are really more of a sometimes food and my pigs don't like oranges either. The oxbow tablets they love."
guineapigs,37wylk,heyalliey,4,Sun May 31 13:40:32 2015 UTC,There are plenty of other healthy  veggies high in vitamin C. Red/ Green bell peppers for example. I'd recommend staying away from tablets and drops since its harder to monitor how much of those they consume
guineapigs,37wylk,rustyoldtimer,2,Sun May 31 19:05:59 2015 UTC,I don't usually have a problem with the tablets since they snarf them down. Odd that my vet said to not give them peppers that often. She said they cause gas.
guineapigs,37wylk,sockkysock,3,Sun May 31 19:11:58 2015 UTC,Those tablets are a godsend
guineapigs,37wylk,alpinegirl14,5,Sun May 31 20:16:14 2015 UTC,"No, they can't digest fibre properly so run it through twice. She'll either eat them straight out her butt by crouching, or pick them up off the floor as a tasty snack later...  Also, guinea pigs can sleep with their eyes open and stood up, so don't panic if you see her stood stock still, she may be napping.  Incidentally, you'll need to weigh her every week (I'd do every day seeing as she's new) and record it. When they're ill, they'll lose weight and it may be the only sign."

They now have a 2x6 cage and it was worth the anger of building the grids and doing math so I used my money correctly. I now use one of their old cage bottoms for a hay bin them to eat out of.

guineapigs,37tdfm,MeowMeowMeg,1 point,Sat May 30 06:02:17 2015 UTC,"1) Pellets and hay should be the main fare for a guinea pig. Both timothy hay/hay-based. About a quarter cup of pellets or so is good per day. Hay should be provided in unlimited amounts. Guinea pigs need some form of vitamin C supplement every day as well. About a cup of veggies packed is the amount I hear quoted most. You'll want to make sure you don't feed too many veggies, they can make your piggies pretty poopy. Favorites for my pigs are lettuce (romaine or green leaf), green bell peppers, and carrots- but every pig likes different things. He may not take fresh veggies at first, keep trying if so. If he doesn't take to them you can use vitamin C supplements, you can find these at a pet store. This is a pretty comprehensive food list, you can try any of the foods listed in the amounts specified. You'll want to watch for foods high in calcium and oxalic acid, as these can contribute to bladder stones. My piggies love a bit of fruit every now and then... their absolute favorite is sweet cherry, when I offer them a piece they will sometimes jump for it like a dog jumps for a potato chip. It's kind of hilarious. If your apartment/house gets hot during the summer you can freeze vegetables/fruit and give them a little thawed as a treat to help him keep cool.  2)I've never taken them myself but I hear it's <$15  3) Give him some space to run around in, if he's got a roomy cage that'll be good. Give him things to chew on, you can buy sticks from the pet store. Ours like chewing on apple tree twigs. Guinea pigs typically love grass. If you take them outside be sure that the grass is untreated. Giardia is also a risk, and you'll want to make sure you clean anything you get from outside thoroughly. Also if you take them outside protect them from predators. Mine almost got pounced on by a cat once, and then there's this sad story (and more out there like it).  My guineas like having something to run in and out and around of- I've got a big strip of twisted, folded-up brown packing paper I just plop in the middle of the floor for floor time and they'll run around in it, hide, poop, popcorn, usually in that order. :) I also notice that my pigs really like to burrow in paper bedding- I line my cage with fleece but I put paper bedding on top because they like it so much haha, they get REALLY excited and popcornbuttscootpoop everywhere through it when it's fresh. It does need to be changed frequently though, so eh. Guinea pigs don't do much besides eat, poop, hide, and run around. When they're tired they sometimes get really cuddly!"
guineapigs,37tdfm,Zaphy1415926,1 point,Sat May 30 07:43:57 2015 UTC,"If you want to put him down for some floor time, I recommend purchasing a very inexpensive shower curtain liner to put underneath a blanket.  This way if he tinkles, it won't damage your floor.  Since he's a single, you could give him a stuffed friend.  He'd probably like it.  Now that it's summer, my pigs love to dine on the usual stuff--romaine lettuce, cucumber sans seeds, green bell pepper, grape tomatoes, carrots but, on occasion, they also get watermelon/watermelon rind and cantaloupe.  My pigs love timothy hay.  Make sure your guest pig has plenty in his cage every day.  Good luck with your summer pig!"

Brenda was a huge source of support for Mischka, he did not lose any weight or get super depressed after Leela passed, and i attribute that to Brenda being an awesome lovely peeg who kept him from being lonely.

It was like her vibrant red had faded a tiny bit to expose an undercoat pattern i hadnt noticed before. My current five yr old red pig is starting to become more orange starting at the tip of the nose and sweeping gradually back. Maybe this is how they go ""grey"".

They are very happy and well behaved, never really go to the bathroom anywhere outside their favorite indoor area. When they are running around the house Ihave to keep an eye on them because there is a cat and dog here as well, but I simply call their names and say time to come back to the room and they oink their way over.

Please help me out. I love theme so much and I just am so torn. I have no idea what to do. My lifestyle just does not work around them. I get to really only see them around night time and during the day I only have time to really make sure they are fed. My mom does a lot of the feeding and helps me out a lot and I hate to have her deal with my responsibility. I have a big enough cage and they get their cage cleaned regularly, so don't assume I am mistreating them. They have great food and all the things they need but I feel they need more one on one time and I am struggling to feel I am succeeding at giving them enough."
guineapigs,37fnmy,_inkrypted_,6,Wed May 27 07:48:41 2015 UTC,You have three adorable guinea pigs! I have two cute ones as well and I also work all day so I get to see them at night. As long as they have each other and all the food and water that they need and spacious cage I can't see why you should give them away!
guineapigs,37fnmy,LiliBlume,5,Wed May 27 15:36:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, it makes no sense to give them away just because you have a normal day job. If the job required traveling a lot then I can see where there would be a problem, mainly just due to the logistics of keeping them fed. But guinea pigs entertain themselves most of the time, they don't need constant interaction with people during the day."

guineapigs,37fnmy,himynameiswho,2,Wed May 27 21:06:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with what the others have said, however, if you're concerned about putting extra burden on your mom who has to do some of the caring for the pigs, you might consider talking to her about it. Of course, she could be an angel and just say it's no big deal and you might still feel guilty. In that case, you can feed and spot clean their cage before and after work, just takes a few minutes. They don't need the feeding to be spread out so much throughout the day, they can pace their eating. That way you can do all the feeding and cleaning."

guineapigs,37ejzj,Abyssinius,2,Thu May 28 22:27:47 2015 UTC,Yeah mine are still sorting it out.  It's good to know that it can take a while.  They seem to be getting along better now at least.  Hopefully in a week or two they will be friends.
guineapigs,37ejzj,Abyssinius,1 point,Fri May 29 04:18:14 2015 UTC,"that sounds a lot better than if every time they get close they growled at each other. I'm sure they'll get used to each other. I'd keep them in the same cage but keep a close eye on them. If they're scared now, you can't really be sure if they'll get along once they're no longer scared. You could try putting a pile of veggies in the middle of the cage and see if they'll eat together (basically repeat the kitchen bonding in the cage). Eating together can be a nice bonding experience.  keep us updated, I've never heard of this situation before. I wonder why they're scared. Maybe they've both only lived alone before? Or maybe they associate each other with the bath since that was one of the few times they've hung out together."
guineapigs,37ejzj,Abyssinius,1 point,Wed May 27 03:04:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried the bath together thing, does it really work?  I just bathed the baby so she wouldn't have her own smell.   I tried the veggie pile and that worked a bit.  They played tug of war over the veggies, but never got aggressive, then went back to their respective tunnels.   I think it's because Koda has only ever been around dogs, not other pigs so she isn't sure what to do maybe?"

guineapigs,37c264,FrolickingBeans,2,Tue May 26 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"I never thought of doing that. I have two houses for my two pigs. And they're not always in them, but they still run when I try to pick them up. One will accept being petted in the cage (I think she just really loves her chin rubs). But the other, I have to chase to pick her up. She's always been a wiggly pig. I assumed it was because she had a previous owner and I didn't get her as a baby. But I may try taking the houses out and give them little fluffy beds. They do tend to chew any stuffed items I put in there, though. Do you think they might be too old for it? They are approximately 2 years old."
guineapigs,37c264,FrolickingBeans,1 point,Thu May 28 22:28:14 2015 UTC,I don't think they'd be too old for it. It's never too late to get them more social with people. :] You could also try leaving the houses out when you are nearby and putting the houses back in when you leave or are going to sleep.
guineapigs,37c264,patchesnbrownie,2,Mon Jun 1 06:00:51 2015 UTC,That's a good plan. They're getting their fleece changed tonight so maybe I'll leave their huts out until I go to sleep and throw their blankies in there with them instead.

guineapigs,37cq20,Sneeko,3,Tue May 26 17:47:16 2015 UTC,Cute piggies :) The behavior you described sounds perfectly normal. The pigs will continue to act that way until one pig has asserted dominance and the other accepts it. As long as there is no fighting/blood drawn and one isn't blocking the other from food you just need to let the pigs work out where they stand with each other.
guineapigs,37cq20,whiterabbit108,2,Tue May 26 23:09:05 2015 UTC,Sounds like you're doing everything right to me. Rumble strutting is the sound/behavior you describe where they rumble and shake their butts at each other. It's low-level dominance behavior. It sounds like you have a good chance of pairing them. Just MAKE SURE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE SEXES. You don't want babies. This is the best guide for everything piggie IMO: http://www.guinealynx.info/healthycavy.html and this is where they direct people on successful introductions: http://www.guinealynx.info/records/viewtopic.php?t=37

guineapigs,37cq20,lovecraftians_unite,1 point,Thu May 28 00:12:51 2015 UTC,"Don't separate them unless they actually become violent. A more dominant pig will do these things and it is better if the other is more submissive, there is less conflict than with a dominant pig meeting a dominant pig. There is sometimes nipping but just make sure to watch and make sure there is no blood; the nipping is normally fine. Lots of people get scared and separate them when they are only making noises/rumblestrutting and this is bad because the pigs don't sort things out and establish themselves. Let them run around in the neutral area for a few hours, or until they tire themselves out, before putting them in a cage together. Make sure to wash everything first and try to mix their lifestyle up a bit; move water bottles and food bowls, hidey huts, make an adventure out of everything. Also eliminate scents and smells as much as possible. Provide plenty of space and room, as well as individual attention in order to avoid bickering over that. If you can, with them often to monitor food intake and If one is dropping at all feed him some veggies during one on one time."
guineapigs,37dnbr,berrabear,2,Tue May 26 21:29:54 2015 UTC,I've heard giving the pigs a bath together could possibly help. Also doing a complete clean down of the cage so that there is no scent of the original pig in the cage. There are going to be some dominance issues the pigs need to work out amongst themselves until dominance is asserted by one pig and the other one accepts it... but if they are actually hurting each other it may be more than a show of dominance.

However, this is clearly a subreddit for pet guinea pigs. There's plenty of facebook groups for that type of discussion.   Don't be the asshole who talks about eating everyone's pets. It's one thing to be like, 'haha throw em in the pan' and another to post a photo that most would consider offensive. If you had a pet who everytime you posted a pic of it or talked about it people mentioned eating it, you'd be annoyed too.  I raise meat rabbits and am planning on getting cuy. I talk to many people who have them as well, and they comment less about eating them than people who don't eat them do. If you post a pic of a cute litter, they don't immediately go 'mm, yummy!' Like a lot of dicks will on here (ok mostly ranting about rabbits now, sorry, but my point still stands, you can have a meat animal and still enjoy them and not talk about killing them every 5 seconds).  It's childish, and just disrespectful. Don't start, it's a thing 12 year olds would do."

Just give him green lettuce for treats and bonding time now and again. Pigs get excited for food period. If I open the closet door, the squeak cause they know they are getting fresh pellets and more hay. In the mornings they squeak for their vitamin C tablets. So you don't have to feed them fruits/veggies to make them happy. A lot of that stuff is too high in sugar for them anyway, so leafy greens are the best treat if you really want to give them something special. :] I hope he gets better soon.

So I'm just going to sum it up and if you have any questions ask away.  Dr. Burgess at the SW Animal Hospital told me that fruits have too much sugar for guinea pigs and root vegetables are not a natural part of their diet and also too much sugar for them. Their poop was smellier and mushier when I used to feed them vegetables (bell peppers and lettuce twice a day). When I stopped they had more energy and less smelly poops. Because their natural diet consists of grasses he said I can give them a little pieces of lettuce from time to time for bonding purposes. They get vitamin C from the Oxbow vitamin C tablets that I feed them daily."

Even introducing a baby pig to an older pig seems easier than introducing two older pigs. If they don't get along initially there are things you can do to try to help them get along better, like giving them a bath together.   There will more than likely be some initial dominance behavior- mounting and chasing, but once one pig asserts dominance and the other accepts it, there is usually no issue.  If I were you I would go ahead and get another young male pig. Your original pig will thank you for the company!"

I rushed her to the hospital I work at, we did some xrays, and she had a two huge stones- one in her bladder and the other in her urethra. We knew the surgery was risky but we went forward. She was under anaesthesia for almost three hours- the stone in her urethra was huge and it took two doctors to break it up. We were concerned about a urethral tear so I brought her home to monitor and nurse her there so she wouldn't get stressed. Unfortunately she took a turn for the worse a few hours ago and couldn't breathe so I rushed her in and we put her down. I love you my sweet, sweet little chunky pig."

guineapigs,36z4t3,RobotPigOverlord,2,Sat May 23 13:25:29 2015 UTC,I would give him a week and then adopt another piggy of a similar age. I have found that most pigs will get along within a few days. You can keep them separated at first just using a  C&C grid
guineapigs,36z4t3,dcravenor,2,Sat May 23 13:56:41 2015 UTC,An exgf of mine went through many years of guinea pigs and replacing lost ones and then one day they decided to replace a single deceased pig with two younger pigs and the solo old pig called pi' didn't like them and went on to live by himself for several more years with the other two in a separate cage in a different room. Moral being if he's eating well and hasn't gone all depressed then maybe he too can live by himself but what do I know I'm not a vet or animal specialist
guineapigs,36z4t3,accidentalwarlord,2,Sat May 23 14:55:26 2015 UTC,"I had two and one died a bit over a year ago. I couldn't get a new one, so she has had to live alone. Cuddles are required way more often, but other than that she is a healthy happy pig"
guineapigs,36z4t3,whiterabbit108,2,Sat May 23 15:01:36 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your loss :(  We have lost two pigs over the last 5 or so years. We have always kept pairs of pigs, so in both cases when one pig passed the other was left by himself. Both times we gave the remaining pig a week or so to be by himself and then adopted a baby pig to keep the remaining pig company. I've found that it is very easy to introduce a baby pig to an older pig, and I've heard others say the same thing. We actually adopted 2 baby pigs last time, and they get along great with their 3 year old ""brother"".   Anytime you want to introduce a new pig to a pig you already have there is a risk that they wont get along. But I think it is worth the risk instead of having your remaining pig have to be alone the rest of his life."

I'm honestly shocked they survived their first home, i would have thought that diet combined with misery would have killed them. You are a really good person to have saved them.  They will be traumatized for quite some time. All you can do is be patient, gentle and always quiet around them (i dont mean silent, i just mean no loud tv or music or yelling).  You could try giving this calming supplement to the piggies. Its made for rabbits but i have read the ingredients and it is safe for guinea pigs. I would suggest 1/2 tablet daily for each guinea pig (it takes about 4 weeks to see results from daily use).  Pet Naturals of Vermont Calming for Rabbits, 30 Crisps  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FSAB99I/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_OO1xvb0YPMFPY  It sounds like you're doing a great job. All you can do is just hand feed them lots of yummy fresh veggies and occasionally fruits, and let them sit on your lap and gently stroke and massage them. My piggies like to be brushed, here is the set of brushes i use (they sell them at petco too)  Ware Small Animal Grooming Kit   https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004L4ZNAS/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_IU1xvb1ZZNFWX"

Not quite wheeking, not quite whining. Sometimes they continue when we pet them.  Is this a good or bad thing?  Is this to convey their fear to each other? I've looked up sounds online but can't find a clip that exactly shows their noises."

guineapigs,36ty5i,jadcorn,3,Fri May 22 02:30:13 2015 UTC,"I wash the fleece 1x a week but spot clean everyday. I clean it 2x a week. I empty everything out and sanitize it. I found if I don't clean it out after ~4 days, the pigs start to poop more on the fleece. I got really lucky with my girls because they were basically litter trained when I got them--I just made sure I was using the same litter as the place I got them from had, so they were comfortable going there. I also covered the cage over the litter tray for the first few days so it was darker there. I think what really helps, if this isn't your set up already, is to have a large litter tray and put their hay rack over it and their food bowl in it. I use a big plastic bin. I also toss all their stray poops into the litter box when I spot clean. I use recycled paper bedding. It stays dry and it's what my piggies were already used to.  My pigs will pee and poo in their wooden house where it's very dark--I can't really blame them for that. I don't have a solution for it other than to layer up the absorbent layer and make sure to clean it out daily. :/ I rotate out their hidies so they don't consistently have that spot to go in/they don't get use to it. I hope this helps! Good luck!"

guineapigs,36ty5i,L00k_Again,1 point,Fri May 22 16:49:37 2015 UTC,"I change out the fleece every 1.5 weeks. I sweep out the cage daily, sometimes twice daily. Right now we have two corner litter pans, one gets changed daily because they use it so frequently that the paper bedding gets soaked, the other is changed every few days.   I plan to make a bunch of pee pads though (absorbent core, like an old folded tea towel or pot holder, wrapped in fleece, either glued or sewn) and eliminate the litter pans altogether. That way I can do away with the paper bedding mess."

I haven't been able to find a solution, but I know he does it because he thinks it's funny. His vet says this is not an uncommon thing.   To make it so it's less of a complete mess, you could try switching to fleece bedding.  That might make the hay easier to clean."

guineapigs,36rneb,Jellylamp,2,Thu May 21 16:05:35 2015 UTC,"First off, cool cage! I like their tiki hut.  The cloth you see is fleece--it's polyester so it will allow moisture to pass through it (versus, for example, cotton which would absorb the moisture and just remain damp). It's important to ""prep"" the fleece so it'll let the liquid pass through. You will need to wash it a couple times to get the waterproofing off, and then check to see if water still beads up on it. If it doesn't bead up, it's ready. :) You can get fleece at walmart or fabric stores--the fun part is picking the pattern!  Underneath the fleece you need an absorbent layer--somewhere for the moisture to go once it's not sitting on the surface. Some people use puppy pads or towels; I bought uhaul furniture pads (made from recycled denim) from a uhaul store, and they were huge so it was easy to cut them to the right size for my cage. (They will shrink a bit in the washer, just fyi, so leave some fabric allowance if you don't prewash!)   My piggies love fleece--they popcorn and do laps, go crazy, etc. There's no bedding being flung around when they take off. I also have a litter tray with recycled paper bedding on the bottom. I would really suggest paper bedding over pine shavings--it doesn't stay wet and it's healthier for the piggies. I put their hay and food in the litter tray. They do most of their business in there. I change the paper bedding 2x a week and wash the fleece and underlying pad 1x a week. I spot clean the fleece everyday--pick up their stray poops and toss them in the litter tray. If your pigs don't use a litter tray, you might have to wash their fleece more than once a week.   For your piggie that likes to nap all day (ahh that's the life), I would consider putting an extra towel under the fleece where her house sits. OR you can make smaller ""potty pads"" (ie: sew an absorbent layer to a piece of fleece) and put one under her house and change it out every couple days. That way the majority of the fleece in your cage stays clean.  In summary, fleece makes my piggies really clean, happy and healthy, and it's going to be more cost effective in the long run. I would only make the switch to fleece if you can spot clean every day. It's a necessity. The only con I can think of is it can be expensive if you have to pay for laundry."
guineapigs,36rneb,KT-Boundary,2,Thu May 21 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"We've discovered that fleece is a much less expensive option for piggy bedding.  The main downside is washing it, as long as you are okay with this, then it's not a problem.  I recently purchased a product called ""Zorb"" from Wazoodle Fabrics, and online store.  This product is primarily used for people who make their own diapers/pads.  It is meant to go between a layer of fleece & some other bottom fabric of your choosing and is supposed to be super absorbent.  I haven't made any pee pads yet because I need to purchase fabric, so I don't have any personal experience with the stuff.  I am hoping to get fabric tomorrow (Jo-Ann's has a sale this weekend, with their solid pill-free fleeces for USD $4/yd) and plan on making pee pads this weekend."
guineapigs,36rneb,i_am_ms_greenjeans,1 point,Fri May 22 00:34:19 2015 UTC,I use fleece bedding from Piggybedspreads.com  Its awesome. I've saved literally thousands of dollars not having to buy CareFresh bedding. I wash in warm or hot water with 1-2 teaspoons of plain dawn dish detergent (NOT laundry detergent) and a few cups of white vinegar. I switch out the bedding for a fresh fleece bedding every 3 days.

They live in a four by three with a full second story now, still don't have enough cuddle cups and beds for them but those will come, along with a hay bag. So happy that I have finally finished building their cage though, it has been in the works for months just been a bit lazy, they were in a two by two until they got big enough to not need double grids, then they were in just the three by four ranch till today when I got off my lazy butt and built their second story. The 18 month old smaug is finally tall enough to climb into the cage so we needed to move their food and water to where he couldn't get it. They have a lid over the edges normally so the baby doesn't climb in unsupervised, but even when he manages it without us (he is a crafty smaug) he is so good with his babies, a bit loud but they climb into his lap and let him hug them and pet them. He feeds them every day (sometimes more than once a day) all on his own and tries so hard to take care of his pigs all on his own like a big boy, it is so cute. They are so much fun to just sit and watch and listen to them talk to each other, I'm very glad we decided to get both rather than just one, so many adorable shinanagins.

I don't have the money for washing fleece since I live in an apartment and laundry is expensive. I'll find a way to make this work, I'm hoping this stays cleaner than the last cage which was much too small for them all."
guineapigs,36ms1k,Necca,2,Wed May 20 16:32:43 2015 UTC,Laundry expense is my concern in using fleece too. Have you used paper bedding at all? I switch between Carefresh and Kaytee and I'm wondering if shavings are cheaper/better.
guineapigs,36ms1k,vapeislove,2,Wed May 20 17:14:31 2015 UTC,"Not tried paper bedding due to costs again. I have heard that aspen shavings are the best ones to use due to the very low amount of aromatic oils in it. I have used pine for nearly 20 years with all my pets and never had a problem with it. The cage is well ventilated so they won't get respiratory problems from it. Shavings seem to hold a lot of water in them and dry a bit so they have a fairly long life between changes. I've never used paper or carefresh so I can't really compare how they perform here. Shavings are probably cheaper, they are here for me but that varies a bit too."
guineapigs,36ms1k,i_am_ms_greenjeans,1 point,Thu May 21 01:43:33 2015 UTC,"I have what amounts to a 2 cube  by 8 cube cage for my 4 piggies and I go between fleece and shavings as bedding frequently. I can't decide which is most cost efficient. I can get a 4 cubic feet bag of aspen shavings for $18.00. That lasts for about two cage changes. I spot clean with the aspen and it last 1-2 weeks depending. That means a month is about $18, approximately what you pay.  I live in an apartment with a relatively small stacking washer and dryer and I can only do small loads. It takes at least 2 loads for the fleece then a sanitizing wash. I also live in California which is in the middle of a huge drought so I'm trying to reduce my water usage. I sew and have been testing making cage liners and cuddle sacs made of microfiber or performance wicking fabric. They are way thinner than fleece so I could wash everything in one load, not have hay and fur stick like it does to the fleece, but still wick urine like fleece.   Either way, I find aspen bedding to be a great bedding whenever I decide to take a break from fleece. Different brands have a different texture, I like the smaller chip size because its softer. Its not dusty at all.   Do your piggies like to dig in it to make pillows and sleep in the little ditch?"
guineapigs,36ms1k,Blixxy,1 point,Thu May 21 12:39:12 2015 UTC,"I get about 2 cubic feet of shavings for 16 in canada here which I think will last about a month for me. I use pine, I tried aspen and the cage smelled too quickly for my tastes, also aspen is about 30 here. So far they seem to be digging a bit, Naru (white with dark eye patch on the hay on the left) has pushed the house over and made a cozy little bed next to it. Most the others are content to just lay under the tunnels or house. I think they are still adjusting to it."

Never saw a single ""fleece"" cage in my life. And I own guinea pigs for almost 20 years now. Just never saw it once in 20+ pet stores I went.   The newspaper is perfect below the wood rasps. Recommended by pretty much every pet store and vet. It takes up the last bit of moisture and makes the cleaning very easy. You just gotta clean the cage once in 3-7 days (normally).

guineapigs,36l9gl,ashtonknapp,3,Wed May 20 05:30:46 2015 UTC,"The bald spots behind the ears are normal. Our pig's bald spots have gotten bigger as they got older.   We have our pigs out for lap time every day, and even though they like to snuggle up with us, they still don't like to be picked up initially. Our newest baby pig actually has no problem being picked up out of the cage... but our older two really try to avoid being picked up, and then they are fine once they are out. Just keep picking the pig up and having lap time. Give her some veggies while she's out of the cage so she associates lap time with food. I think the best way to make a guinea pig feel less nervous is to have them live in pairs. They are herd animals and feel most comfortable with a buddy around.   Does your mom feed the pig? Our guinea pigs squeak at us when they know it's close to their daily veggie time. So maybe that's what it is. This is the type of noise our pigs make for food."
guineapigs,36l9gl,whiterabbit108,1 point,Wed May 20 06:45:25 2015 UTC,"She does feed her a lot that may be why. Also, is it better for your Guinea pig to have a blanket instead of bedding? Also can you name every vegetable that you feed your guinea pigs? We mostly just get lettuce so if there's one that she may like more or is better for her then we can buy that instead."
guineapigs,36l9gl,whiterabbit108,1 point,Wed May 20 08:02:13 2015 UTC,"What kind of bedding you use is really up to you. We use fleece because I find it easier to maintain than shavings and cheaper than using something like carefresh. Once the fleece is prepared properly it is pretty easy to care for. We sweep up the pig's poop once a day and wash the fleece and towels ever 5 days or so. We put puppy pads on the fleece in the spots that they pee in the most which we can change out ever couple of days.   Here's some info on what beddings to avoid with links at the bottom to more info on bedding.   We feed out pigs romaine lettuce (iceburg is not good for pigs), baby spinach, bell peppers, kale, parsley, carrots... They get other stuff on occasion but these are the veggies we almost always have on hand to feed them. We like to be able to mix things up so the pigs aren't getting the same exact veggies every day."
guineapigs,36l9gl,i_am_ms_greenjeans,1 point,Wed May 20 14:28:34 2015 UTC,"My pigs like Romaine lettuce, grape tomatoes, carrots, cucumber, parsley, cilantro, watermelon and cantaloupe.  They occasionally eat bell peppers and green leaf spinach.  They don't like oranges, cherries (minus the pits) or any other lettuce.  If you want to read up on what GP's should eat, check out the guinealynx info on the right side of the page.  In the long run - fleece is a less expensive alternative to traditional bedding products, but, check with your Mom first because she might not want it in her washing machine.  Most newer washing machines have a clean cycle you can run after you wash the bedding.  (Fleece needs to be washed in hot water, mild detergent and vinegar at least three times so it wicks away the moisture)."
guineapigs,36l9gl,lovecraftians_unite,1 point,Wed May 20 15:24:04 2015 UTC,"There are so many different variations of squeals, wheeks, squeaks, and oinks. They all mean certain things. My pigs are very vocal, but have a ""neutral"" oink, which they do when they're just walking around and cuddling. When they're hungry or hear something that sounds like plastic rustling, the squeak SO loud and run in circles and popcorn. When the baby gets on the older ones nerves, he starts to whine a little bit and may growl, but neither one is the least bit aggressive in any way. When they are scared they sometimes make a noise that sounds like an alarm, it goes from high pitched to low pitched in each squeak. It sounds like an Australian shepherd attention whine to me though. It's usually pretty easy to tell when your guinea pig is happy or something else, once you get to know them a little bit better. Make sure to give her TONS of attention (if she is comfortable with you yet). Your mom might give her more attention and that's why she is more vocal around her, or she may recognize her as the person who gives her food. Either way I doubt it's a negative noise she is making."

Before I got my first guinea pig, I was going to adopt three sisters who were found in a gas station bathroom. They were an all or nothing adoption though and I wasn't ready for three guinea pigs...anyways! Just keep looking, and you're in the right mindset about avoiding breeders, for sure. I don't know how the pet stores are over there, but my local petsmart is awful. I am usually against getting animals from places like that but the pigs were so sick and I couldn't ignore them. It's a challenge but it's one less life to worry about, so maybe you'd be interested in looking into that?"

guineapigs,36khl8,Uncarina,2,Wed May 20 01:25:08 2015 UTC,She is probably still getting used to her new home. Keep giving her plenty of hay and good quality pellets. Try introducing different foods slowly. Same thing for a couple of feedings this will help you learn her preferences and weed out things that she hates or don't agree with her. Be patient she will come around soon.

guineapigs,36khl8,whiterabbit108,2,Thu May 21 17:07:27 2015 UTC,"Our newest baby pig wouldn't touch fresh veggies for about a month and a half after we adopted him. We have two other boys, so he saw them eating their veggies every day, and he would go over to the veggies and kind of sniff them and then just leave the loft/kitchen area. We give our pigs a little bit of fruit as a treat every once in a while, and he definitely liked apples from the get go.. just no interest in veggies. But recently when I gave the pigs their veggies, the baby dove in and started munching away for the first time. I have no idea why he wouldn't eat them to begin with as I've never had a pig who didn't love veggies, but each pig is different."

guineapigs,36khl8,poxyfairy,2,Thu May 21 17:06:09 2015 UTC,"If she is from a pet store then she likely doesn't know what fresh veggies are. You might want to think about getting her a friend; it is easier to introduce new things. When one pig likes something the other is more compelled to try it. As for now, try leafy greens. Baby leaf mix is my piggies favorite veggie aside from mint. I've noticed my pigs don't like juicy stuff like fruit. They won't eat peppers either, but other people's pigs seem to enjoy peppers quite a lot. If she seems to be interested in certain smells I'd pay more attention to that. Also try baby carrots! All pigs eat them like candy, to my knowledge. If she seems indifferent to some thing, try cutting it into smaller pieces. Maybe even feed the small pieces to her."

If she sounds like she's mumbling or chattering, that's good. it's more of a wheek wheek wheek for distress, but don't confuse that with calling for food.  You can get Vitamin C drops for their water bottle if she's not eating veggies. But keep providing them anyway, a little at a time.  You can also try rinsing the veggies in white vingear, then again in water."

guineapigs,36fn56,form5,1 point,Tue May 19 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"The ones you watch on YouTube are usually easy to train. They're called the ""border-collie"" guinea pigs. Sometimes you really just can't train them. Keep in mind that guinea pigs have common sense. They understand that certain things lead to certain things, like a bell means it's time to eat or after they eat veggies they get to play in the grass. If your pig loves to do something, try associating training with that. Start very slowly and allow her to assimilate. Persistence is key. I taught my pig where all his things are and now he just tells me when they want something. When they explore beyond their room, I taught them to ""come back"". You should try to do the action you are teaching them."

guineapigs,36dtrl,GeoLasers,3,Mon May 18 18:58:24 2015 UTC,"I found that putting them in those roller balls that they have for hamsters can be kind of fun (if you buy the guinea pig sized ones), but sometimes they seem uncomfortable. If your flooring isn't carpet, I recommend just letting them run around. Mine, when I had them, also liked to watch nature shows and animal shows. They would squeek. It was so cute. Also, chew toys are nice, the pine ones. Never get cedar."
guineapigs,36dtrl,ashbeaird,3,Mon May 18 23:22:50 2015 UTC,"Please don't put your piggie in one of those rolling balls! They can ruin their spine. Gives them arthritis later on in life!

Their main hay rack is a bent piece of C&C grid and more than twice this one's size. I used to fill both racks, but none of them ate out of this one, so I stopped filling it... but I didn't remove it in case cage splitting becomes necessary in the future at any point.

guineapigs,36d7hj,carola86,3,Mon May 18 13:26:02 2015 UTC,"Every time I have had a new pig, I cuddled with them right away. With or without food, they might as well get used to it from the beginning. So cuddle away, I say :) but two weeks is nothing, he will be a little scared of you for a long time. But if you have food, it always helps.  Another advice, when he's a little more used to you guys, buy him a friend, if he doesn't already has one. It's honestly the best you can do for him! Don't wait too long though, with two males it's better to bring them together when they're young :)  But after two weeks it's completely normal that they're still scared."
guineapigs,36d7hj,MadamMadLove,3,Mon May 18 20:22:41 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind he's also still young - little pigs just like to run around and get themselves into all sorts of mischief. He's probably also excited that he's out of his cage at home and wants to know what the rest of the room, etc. is like."
guineapigs,36d7hj,sammg37,3,Mon May 18 23:49:46 2015 UTC,"It took my pigs about 3 weeks before they really felt any sort of comfortable around us.  I made sure to take them out for a few mins and hold them everyday.  I noticed if I started skipping days, they wouldn't enjoy it as much.  They will always run from you, that's just ingrained in their species since they are at the bottom of the food chain.  One of my pigs has finally taken a liking to cuddling and will hide her face in my hair while laying on my shoulder. :)  I started holding them in fleece sacks, then eventually set them on top, and now I can just hold them on a towel or straight on my shirt.    Also, talk to them as you approach.  Guinea pigs don't have the best sight in the world, so you may look like gigantic blob coming toward them fast as you approach.  If they hear your voice and know it's you, they will receive you better."

Guinea pig neuteres can be tricky because piggies are so fragile. Make sure your vet is experienced with performing surgery on guinea pigs.  Think about separating momma pig so that she won't be harassed by the boy while she is pregnant.  The male babies will need to be separated from momma and other females at 3 weeks of age. Have extra enclosures on hand.  Start looking for homes for the babies asap. Ask a small rehoming fee to weed out the unfit people.  Make sure the prospective owners are knowledgeable and prepared to care for pigs. Spacious cages, daily veggies, floor time, 24/7 hay, no wheels or balls, etc. Try to adopt them out in same sex pairs."

guineapigs,365nm7,abbymakeup,3,Sat May 16 11:14:36 2015 UTC,"You wash the fleece a bunch of times to prepare it so that it will wick moisture through to an absorbent layer under the fleece. To make sure that your fleece is properly prepared, lay it over a towel and drip water on it. If the water beads up and rolls off the fleece, it's not ready. If the water is sucked through the fleece then it is wicking properly and ready to go in the cage.  The fleece flippers and stuff are nice (I would imagine) because it means less work for you. BUT it is much cheaper to buy your own fleece. We have a similarly sized cage (a 2x4 with a 1x2 loft) and to make one full set of fleece lining need to buy 2.5 yards of fleece, the price of which will vary depending on what kind of fleece you buy. The cheaper stuff can be as little as $2.50 a yard, while the nicer looking patterns can be $10 a yard. After getting an appropriately sized piece of fleece and preparing it, all you have to do is set down a layer of towels for the pee to be absorbed into. We also use puppy pads in the pig's most frequently peed in areas (which we change out regularly).   As to the difference between the fleece flippers and cage liners..  The fleece flippers have a sheet of coroplast in the middle, with two Uhaul pads on both sides of the coro, then fleece covering both sides. This way when one side of the flipper gets yucky, you just flip it over and have a fresh clean side.. Here is more info on fleece flippers.   The cage liners do not have the coro insert, and are just two layers of Uhaul pads with surrounded by fleece."
guineapigs,365nm7,whiterabbit108,2,Sat May 16 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know what it's called specifically, but just washing your fleece lots of times helps with the piggie pee go through the fleece and onto the absorbent material.   Your cage is perfect for 2 piggies. If you have the time finding the supplies to make the C and C cage is pretty simple. I found the grids online and have recently seen them at many garage sales for much less. The coroplast can be found at Home Depot,  they have large sheets for $13 or online/sign stores. I feel like one sheet could cover your cage. By building the cage you have the option to do what ever layout you and your piggies desire (as they can be really bossy ;)  ). As the fleece flippers if your looking to save a huge chunk of change, it's a simple diy, and saves a ton of money!!!   I find the fleece flippers much easier to clean then the fleece lining. You can switch out fleece pads vs the entire lining while doing your weekly cleanings.   If not just watch YouTube guinea pig cage tours I love watching what people buy for there piggies, there are some really great websites they suggest."

When one of my pigs was lethargic I would sprinkle regular vit C powder onto the green pepper and add a teensy bit of water on top so it would stick.

Baby is from petsmart (I know, I'm sorry, but he needed help), but just looking at him through the glass I could tell he was sick and unhappy, though they didn't tell me anything and didn't bother to mention that he had mites. Such a sick little baby!! Anyways, I buy Oasis Vitamin C drops and drop a few drops in their pellet food each day. Because the baby has a deficiency, I put double the amount of drops than I usually do. Maybe it isn't as effective as other vitamin C, but it's something, and the two are healthy (baby is getting there). If you end up deciding on something like this, don't put it in the water like they suggest, you would have to replace the water every day and the guinea pigs wouldn't have gotten the nutrients anyways.

guineapigs,35wmkt,TheyCallMeAnna,3,Thu May 14 04:12:56 2015 UTC,"Stretched back legs and purring sound are a great sign! :D stretching out and flattening their bodies is a sign of comfort.    I've read mixed interpretations of the headbutt. Some people say it's a welcoming sign, others say it's more of a ""stop petting me"" sign. I personally think it's a way for them to push you away. My pig will let me pet him but once he's had enough he will head butt my hand. It really does feel like he's pushing my hand away so I will stop. If I keep petting him, he'll headbutt me harder. I guess you just have to pay close attention when she does it to you and just have a feel for other signs she may be trying to communicate.  Also, I know you mentioned you just got her but once you both get acclimated, you  should definitely look into getting her a friend! I can't stress enough how important this is for them. I just recently got my piggy a friend and he is beyond thrilled! It's like I can almost see a smile across his face, I swear! :)   Edit: pronouns (noticed you said it's a girl)"

guineapigs,35wmkt,wedge9,1 point,Fri May 15 17:41:17 2015 UTC,"+1 ... It might be better to think of the ""purr"" as a growl, if it's the noise I'm thinking of. They don't like to be touched near the rear, so stay away from the lower back.   Head scratches are fine but I agree that the head butt means they're asking you to stop. Our piggies get like that sometimes - other days, they're content to be head-scratched for a long time.  One of our piggies doesn't mind being petted under the chin, either. She'll lift up her snout and let our daughter give her some chin-strokes. Not sure this is all that normal, so, ymmv."

guineapigs,35wmkt,vanillakahlua,1 point,Sat May 16 00:46:36 2015 UTC,"Purring is good. I've heard people say it's bad, I've never had a pig chatter teeth at me during or after purring. Some even close their eyes and relax while purring when I pet them.  The head butt is just them trying to see. I noticed if I pet their head too slow instead of fast little pets with my finger they are like: MOVE I CANT SEE! Hehehe, it's completely random when they do or don't do it. Sometimes I can pet their head and they don't head butt.   If they kinda jump at the spot where you are betting them, maybe move on to another space.   Graham, my teddy, starts shaking his back leg when I pet above the leg, like he wants to start scratching. He acts like it feels good and annoying at the same time so I usually avoid that area hehe. When I pet near the middle of his back he closes his eyes and shakes his head side to side, it's really silly. I'll have to record it sometime. I think he's ticklish or something.   Dusty, my Half Peruvian half Abyssinian, does not like to be petted on her sides near the bottom where her stomach is. She chatters a lot and squeaks and tries to move her body away from the petting. You'll learn over time what they like and don't like. I've never been bitten for learning where my pigs like to be petted.   Post a pic of your new baby! :]"

He'd 'stalk' your mug, hoping you'd leave it momentarily unattended within his reach. I used to give him a bit on a tea spoon just to stop him going for it (I take my tea black so there was never anything other than tea in it). He lived to the grand old age of 9, perhaps his occasional tea spoon of tea contributed to this longevity!"

I know you mentioned you voiced your concerns but maybe have a serious talk where you support your claims with evidence. There's lots of information on how to properly care for a guinea pig and specifically about cage size requirements. Maybe try showing him what a guinea pig's home should look like? Introduce him to this sub? Explain to your friend that your only intention is for the guinea pig to have a healthy life.   Aside from the horrible living conditions do you know if your friend properly cares for him? Feeds him properly? Plays with him? Lets him out of his cage?
guineapigs,35lmjk,kittie_s0ckmilk,11,Mon May 11 16:27:40 2015 UTC,"The GP belongs to the daughter who is around 20 years old. She moved out of her moms and left the GP because her boyfriend wouldn't allow him to go with her, so the little guy lives with her mom. When I got there today, the water bottle looked as you see it and there was no hay or food in the cage. We gave him some food which he promptly dove in it with a furious hunger and spilled it. The bedding was changed and I gave his butt a mild washing. I was told they let him out once and lost him in the couch so they don't let him out anymore. He's incredibly friendly and seems to cry for attention. I just wanted to grab him and run for the border."
guineapigs,35lmjk,merthsoft,9,Mon May 11 17:07:20 2015 UTC,"That breaks my heart! Would you be able to keep him? Maybe just keep him for her? Like the mom is doing, except do it properly.  It seems like the mom wouldn't care if you were to take him, in fact it might be a relief for her. As for your friend, if she cares for him she should only want what's best for him so she should be ok with wanting to give him a better home. If this doesn't seem like a reasonable idea to them, then they're all knowingly neglecting this animal. I'm not sure to what extent this extends to guinea pigs but animal neglect is illegal. At this point, you should grab him and run for the border!   Please keep him and give him a better life! He doesn't deserve to be lonely and stuck in that little box until he dies :,("

Vigilantism doesn't help anyone. It is NOT the right thing to do, even in this case."
guineapigs,35lmjk,ulzzangkitty,1 point,Mon May 11 19:14:21 2015 UTC,"No. It's the pig's best chance. If OP steals the guinea pig, that will make the original owners the victims in the authorities' eyes, and they'll be more likely to side with them and write OP off as an unstable criminal. If the authorities won't think that this cage is too small when the guinea pig is with its original owners, that's not going to change after it's been stolen."
guineapigs,35lmjk,vairuh,1 point,Tue May 12 21:46:03 2015 UTC,"As I said, if they're not going to step in at this point, they're even more so not going to step in when the guinea pig gets stolen and has to be returned to its rightful owner under the law. Stealing the pig is not the right thing to do, not for morality's sake, not for the pig's sake. The owners have already threatened to call the police. If the pig goes missing all of a sudden, there will be no doubt who the culprit is and at best it will have a day or two with a larger cage and no cedar fumes before it goes right back in the cramped box where it started. And then OP gets stuck with a criminal record as well as whatever punishment occurs if the owners decide to press charges, which given their responses so far, seems very likely. I know it sucks to see this pig in less than ideal conditions but stealing it away is one of the worst things you could possibly do for it."
guineapigs,35lmjk,ankaba04,1 point,Tue May 12 23:40:16 2015 UTC,"The thing about this is they already know OP dissaproves of their care and keeps ""pestering"" them about it. Once the pig is gone, they'll look straight at OP and could have them charged. Definitely don't want that happening.  Even if they actually dont care the pig got stolen, they could still go after OP out of some kind of revenge."
guineapigs,35lmjk,tejasisthereason,10,Wed May 13 00:29:43 2015 UTC,"I would explain to your friend what a guinea pig needs. (More space, different bedding, fresh H20, and more more importantly, guinea pig friends. Perhaps your friend simply doesn't know that this guinea pig is being severely neglected.  It's tough when the owner doesn't wish to give up the pet - I ask you to make it clear to the owner that their pet is suffering and unhappy. It's easy to allow them to be happy, and many people who would be interested in caring for that sweet piggy properly.   If they still won't do anything, than your options are to report this to an animal-welfare organization, or forcibly rescue the piggy yourself. Please tread lightly here, but do what is needed to save that piggy.   Thanks!"

This is my cage http://postimg.org/image/m3n60zuxj/ I urge you to seriously consider letting me take care of him until you can take care of him and afford the things he needs.

guineapigs,35lmjk,i_am_ms_greenjeans,5,Tue May 12 00:02:58 2015 UTC,"Are there any animal care services you can report this to? I have no idea if that will work (like if theyd even do anything because its a small animal) or if its a good idea, I'm basing this suggestion solely on all the ASPCA rescue type shows I watched on Animal Planet years ago.  I'd be worried theyd become furious and hate you, but that seems to already be happening. So perhaps this would be the way to go for this little guy. And they really can't blame you...you went to them first and asked politely and even informatively for them to change their care habits. Its not your fault they're continuing to abuse this poor pig.  Once they rescue him and put him up for adoption, you could go on in and adopt him right away.  Again basically basing this off animal cruelty rescue shows I watched as a young child, so apologies if this is actually a bad/harmful idea for some reason."
guineapigs,35lmjk,lovecraftians_unite,4,Mon May 11 22:30:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, please report them. Go online and look up shelters near you or the humane society of your county to see if they have any suggestions. This is definitely animal neglect and it is up to us to report it since the poor things can't do it themselves. I know for a fact you can report pet stores and such for neglecting guinea pigs so I don't see why it would be any different to report a family.  I'm sorry for being so blunt and wanting you to go straight to the police! I know you said she's your friend and I'm not sure what kind of relationship you have with the rest of the family, so I'm sorry if this is something difficult for you to go through. Some might say I'm crazy because in this situation, I'd take the guinea pig over their friendship in a heartbeat! Actually, I would always side with the animals regardless of the situation..  Do you think there would be any chance of the mom having a different response to you?   I wish there was much more I could do to help you save him! :("
guineapigs,35lmjk,chrislaf,1 point,Tue May 12 01:08:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that it backfired on you that way. What you said to them definitely came from the right place, however in the future you may want to try being a little less confrontational if the opposing party has shown reluctance to take unsolicited advice/criticism and you really want them to change. ""Because of his living conditions I fear for his life"" comes off pretty strongly, which can make your subsequent offer to temporarily house him sound like you're accusing them of being bad owners and telling them they don't deserve the guinea pig, give it up or else- kind of guilt trip/bully/blackmail-ish. You did a good job of keeping calm in your message (I can tell you took pains to word it politely), but some people hate to admit when they're wrong and will often twist any form of unsolicited criticism the worst way they possibly can, especially when you show them a thread where several people are telling you to report them to the authorities.  This animal is not in immediate danger and looks fairly healthy for now. In the future, whether you are able or willing to attempt to rebuild the bridges that have been burned here or whether you find yourself in a similar situation, please be patient. If the owners don't take kindly to your first attempts to voice your concerns, try being subtler about it instead of escalating it. If you can, try going all Inception on them (minus the actual dream-traveling, heh :P) and see if you can make them think they came up with the idea to move the pig to a bigger cage themselves. They'll be much more likely to ""independently"" decide to do it than to ""bend"" to someone else's will that they do it, if that makes sense. And at the very least, it's better for the guinea pig to live in a cramped space with you keeping an eye on it than for it to live in a cramped space with you cut out of its life completely and unable to help it at all."

I don't know if there is an animal rescue in your area who would be willing to assist, or if they only focus on the most severe cases of animal abuse.  Alas, however, it looks like this little guy's situation isn't going to change.  If the family reads through all our posts, I would hope they'd have the maturity to get over their anger and act like people who committed to being caretakers to a furry little creature and actually take steps to make his existence a comfortable one or be willing to see that they should try to find a new situation for him."

guineapigs,35lmjk,kittie_s0ckmilk,11,Mon May 11 16:13:13 2015 UTC,"The guinea pig is living in terrible conditions.  This ""cage"" is WAY too small. Even more so because he is never let out to play.  The water bottle looks dirty and is probably not changed very often. OP mentioned the guinea pig was wet, meaning the water must be leaking.  There is no hay rack, it is extremely important for pigs to eat hay to keep their digestive systems working properly. It seems as if he is on wood chips which is not recommend for guinea pigs. And he is alone. Everything is wrong with the picture :("

I think you had a valid question and there wasn't a need for all the downvoting. I mean, if you didn't read OP's comment and just saw the picture, not everyone would immediately come to the conclusion of animal neglect. Out of context there isn't really anything wrong with the picture.   Take this one for instance, http://imgur.com/Qny9nrU if you saw this you might think I'm horrible for keeping him in that box! With context you would know it was just for a few minutes while I added the finishing touches to his c&c cage :)   Anyway moral of the story, read next time before asking questions? Might keep the reddit police from raining down on you! xD"
guineapigs,35lmjk,chrislaf,2,Mon May 11 19:11:22 2015 UTC,Get a traveling cage! It's somewhat easier than getting a box all the time which they chew on. They're like ‚Ç¨15 and I would recommend it because it's secure and safe.

guineapigs,35lmjk,chrislaf,1 point,Mon May 11 22:51:50 2015 UTC,"Local animal stores here have traveling cages for every size animal between Danish dog and feeding maggots. So there are ones that will fit guinea pigs. Often they look like plastic hamster cages. I have never had issues with finding them in the right size.  We have one of these. Plenty of models for guinea pigs available. Some look simple, others fancy. To get an impression of the size; If you take a big fat cat you could squeeze it in and just be able to close it (multiple of our cats may have tried). 2 guinea pigs should fit in there with plenty of room to move about should they want to. Though you shouldnt keep them in there for long.  Edit: we usually put a folded towel in there and something to eat like a carrot, apple or cucumber and hay for bedding and hiding."

Here's a blog someone posted on one of the threads: piggiepen.com/2015/01/26/traveling/  I'm guessing you wouldn't drive for 7 days straight! So the pigs might be ok after all. I think this would be MUCH better than sticking them in cargo on a plane! You can easily monitor them the whole way there!   Also, this may be a LONG shot but if you know any doctors/ therapists that would be willing to give you a doctors note declaring them as companion animals for your stress/anxiety/whatever condition you may have wink wink the plane is forced to let you bring them with you! I know it's a little out there but hey, I just wanted to suggest it in case you didn't know it's possible and you have the connections to make it happen.

They  are two years old and are supposedly ""friendly"" and ""well socialized,"" but they freak out and hide when I try to pick them up. Once I picked them up (this was the only time so far) they calm down and chill, but won't take treats out of my hand. Is this normal behavior? Should I just leave them alone until I need to clean their cage?"
guineapigs,35k46p,lunitabonita,7,Mon May 11 03:24:30 2015 UTC,"Don't just leave them alone. Either she lied and they are NOT well socialized, in which case you need to help them to do so, or they are just not used to you yet, which means that you need to get acquainted."
guineapigs,35k46p,FantaKitty213,3,Mon May 11 03:27:53 2015 UTC,"If you just got them, chances are they're still adjusting to their new life with you and would need about a day to settle down a little. It will take a while for them to warm up to you and until then, just keep working with them. Pick them up several times a day and you can even try putting an old shirt of yours or something that has your scent on it in or near their cage so they get used to it.  As for getting them to eat out of your hand, since they're fine after being picked up, try feeding them food then. Put their favorite treat in the palm of your hand and let them take small bites. You can also do the palm trick while they're in the cage; just take it a lot slower so you don't spook them and try to do it multiple times a day. Soon enough they'll start associating you with food and come running every time you walk in the room.   Pretty much all guinea pigs run from you if you try to pick them up from above (they are prey animals after all) it just takes a lot of work to get them to fully trust you. I'm sure they're socialized; they're probably just scared at this point. Keep at it and I'm sure you'll all become the best of friends."

When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable. All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....  ""  I had to put it here."

guineapigs,35e09t,MeeMaoMao,6,Sat May 9 12:27:19 2015 UTC,My pigs are both short-haired and I never bathe them. They groom themselves and are generally quite tidy.
guineapigs,35e09t,JoeBethersonton,2,Sat May 9 13:44:47 2015 UTC,"I have one Teddy pig that lost an eye to infection before I adopted her, and she has troubles keeping herself clean because she can't see her entire body. So I wash her every 6-8 weeks with guinea pig shampoo, or whenever she's looking/smelling bad. I don't worry about washing my other three pigs since they seem to be able to keep themselves clean enough. I take a warm, damp cloth to their feet if they have poops stuck to them, though. That's as far as I've had to go with cleaning"
guineapigs,35e09t,Buttercupification,2,Sat May 9 14:56:45 2015 UTC,"We only do it twice a year. I use shampoo, but only because we had a mite outbreak out and it was pesticidal. Shampoo is probably the easiest to use, though."
guineapigs,35e09t,is2gstop,2,Sat May 9 20:01:55 2015 UTC,"You really don't ever need to wash your pigs unless they get too smelly and don't keep their butts clean (happens with longhaired pigs more). I usually just bathe them on an as-needed basis, which is maybe once or twice a year. Too much bathing irritates their skin. I've always used liquid shampoo."
guineapigs,35e09t,sammg37,2,Sun May 10 03:09:08 2015 UTC,We wash our pigs about every 5-6 weeks.  It's good to get them clean but you don't want to do it to often because you wash away oils that they need for fur/skin.  We use a shampoo my wife bought at the pet store.  Just use a little bit and lightly soap everywhere but ears and face.  Our previous pig Aspen loved to play in water and would wheek for bath time.  Our current boys act as if the water is lava and try to run or jump out of the tub the whole time.

I cut the hair of the long-haired and wash the oldest pigs (7 years, the teddy) back because she is not able to clean herself anymore completely. In Germany, nobody bathes their guinea pig and animal welfare organization warn from doing it. They say it is stress for the guinea pigs and they can get a cold. I don't know whether this is true.

A young male is more likely to get along, but that doesn't mean an adult won't. See if you can set up a meet and greet or something. Though a first introduction usually doesn't settle a hierarchy, it gives you a good idea as to how it'll work out. Check out this guide for more info. Also, the more space they have, the more likely (in my experience) they are to get along and stay nice to each other. Good luck getting the other pig used to a free range lifestyle!"

Is the commercial food you're using have vitamin c in it, or on of those brands that have other things beside just kibble? My pig can be picky at times, but will never not eat a carrot or a tomato. I would take the veggies and put it in their food bowl with some kibble over it, maybe that way they get that it's food. Another thing maybe is to take the kibble out completely that way they get hungry and eat veggies, then once they eat the veggies you put the kibble back in."
guineapigs,35e13d,elianana,1 point,Sat May 9 14:38:06 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem when I adopted two pigs. They were definitely adults, yet seemed to not want to eat a lot of things my store-bought pigs ate like cucumber, grapes, etc. My only conclusion was that they weren't fed properly in their past home.  Soon i figured out that they would only eat green leafy vegetables. Now a few years later he seems to have opened up to other things like oranges and cucumbers. But for a long time would again only eat leafy greens like parsley and lettuce.  I don't know what you were trying to feed your piggies, but maybe try giving them leafy green things like I did? Lettuce especially is something I find extremely rare for a pig to not like, it's like a staple veggie no matter what."
guineapigs,35e13d,ulzzangkitty,1 point,Sat May 9 16:05:01 2015 UTC,"My Piggies were really awkward with veg. I introduced veg as a treat with lap time. They'd turn their noses up at it but then I would try and get some of the juice off the veg onto their lips. Once they tasted that, they usually wanted to eat the veg. Hope this helps. Let us know how it goes.  Edit: To try and get them to try dry veg like Kale or spinach, I'd wrap it around a veg I'd already managed to get them to like such as cucumber and tomatoes, so maybe try juicier veg first?"

My older one, Gizzy , bites on the spout and makes the noisiest sounds when drinking water but my other, Appa is totally quiet. After working at a pet store for 3 years I've just accepted that guinea pigs are going to be very messy with their water. Perhaps you could put a concrete block or something under the water bottle to absorb the water so it doesn't soak the bedding."

guineapigs,35c4pi,Roosty37,1 point,Sat May 9 03:28:29 2015 UTC,I use fleece for bedding for my guinea pigs. I'd read about it. A lot of pig owners use it and it saves a ton on bedding because you can wash it.
guineapigs,35c4pi,rachierou2407,1 point,Sat May 9 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"I have a similar problem with one of my pigs. For some reason he drinks with his head tilted to the side, so half of what comes out of the water bottle goes straight through his mouth to the bedding. I got two lap pads from hammockyhammocks.co.uk (I'm from the uk) to put under the water bottle to absorb the water he drops. I change them every 3-4 days or sooner if he decides to dowse them in lots of water. Keeps the fleece bedding underneath dry and they don't smell at all. Maybe they would be a good solution for you too."

He just walks out whenever he feels like joining me. He's extremely vocal and popcorns A LOT, but only around me or my boyfriend. I don't know what I did really. I have only given him one bath, and he eats a ton so Im not sure how he lost so much weight!! He is still a bit big, but maybe he gets more exercise with me."

A cage divider seems like a good idea, but since they'll have less room to be mobile, I recommend giving them 'floor time' for exercise.  Is that something you do now for them?"
guineapigs,35bnd4,S1LENCE,1 point,Fri May 8 20:30:01 2015 UTC,"No, but it sounds like a good idea, thanks."
guineapigs,35bnd4,S1LENCE,3,Fri May 8 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"We have a pretty good system for 'floor time'. We take an old towel and put it down and sort of make a pillow fort and cover it with a blanket and put it in front of our TV stand (so it's easy to see the fort when we're watching tv).  This will give your pigs a 'home base' to hang out at, where they can feel safe.  It also means they won't run under a couch or furniture to hide (very often at least), and won't be peeing in the corner or whatnot.   So then to encourage them to come out a bit we tear up some lettuce and sprinkle it around the floor, maybe some chopped up bits of carrot too, so they have some incentive to sniff around looking for it.   It's pretty entertaining, my gf and I can watch a movie or tv while my pig (it was two before Charlie got sick) either running about or chilling in their pillow fort.

guineapigs,35bnd4,FantaKitty213,2,Sat May 9 06:42:39 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, there's no such thing as ""play fighting"" with guinea pigs. Sure, they have disagreements on occasion, but they never bite for fun.  I'm glad you decided to separate them when you did; once blood is drawn that usually means the end of a healthy relationship. If you ever notice them trying to get at each other (fighting through the fence, digging under or trying to climb over) you should consider just getting them separate cages; you don't want any more accidents.    As for wound care, hydrogen peroxide is generally not recommended for cleaning as it kills cells and actually prevents proper healing as a result. Warm salt water is a better option for rinsing. I would recommend that you gently clean the area with warm water twice a day and put a very small amount of triple antibiotic ointment (Neosporin or equivalents) on the wound. Since bacitracin (stuff in Neosporin) is a deadly antibiotic when taken orally, apply sparingly, wipe off any excess, and be especially careful when it's applied near the mouth.  edit I noticed your other comment stating you don't give them floor time. Giving them time outside of the cage to just explore helps cut down on stress while giving them tons of exercise. (imagine if you were cooped up in your house for weeks on end with another person; you might get a little angry too!)  It's a great thing to add into your daily routine. :)"

Did you know that in Sweden it's actually the law that they not be kept alone? They're that much pack animals.  Also, once the cage is bought, having two isn't noticeably more expensive. (And if you don't have much money, how will you afford even one vet bill?)  Anyway, I always have two, and I've seen a pattern evolve: Alpha pig seems to be in charge of pig-to-human relations. Last time I lost a pig and then got a new one, the old not-alpha became alpha, and suddenly became really tame. It's as if she picked up that role.  Anyway, pigs have differing personalities, and some will be incredibly tame, while others will always be more guarded."
guineapigs,359qeg,Svataben,2,Fri May 8 20:55:58 2015 UTC,"I have noticed the same pattern with our pigs- we always keep pairs of males and have lost two pigs over the years. In both cases the two pigs that died suddenly were the alphas, and when we got a new buddy for the remaining pig, the old non-alpha became the alpha. Now we have 3 pigs and it's so funny to think about how passive the oldest and current alpha pig used to be with his former partner... Now he's the boss of the baby pigs!"

Didn't pee on you when you held her (within reason, of course), wasn't much of a biter, wouldn't run off, wanted to cuddle."
guineapigs,359qeg,i_am_ms_greenjeans,2,Fri May 8 12:08:56 2015 UTC,"Currently have one pig (I found him abandoned while walking to work one day) and spend a lot of time with him.

guineapigs,359qeg,evilscary,2,Fri May 8 13:20:33 2015 UTC,"From what I've read all pigs are very different. It might take weeks, months or even years for a pig to be fully comfortable with their human companion. So it's never up the human how close the relationship will develop. Having one pig doesn't necessarily mean that he will have a stronger bond with you. This will all depend on your pig's personality. If your pig is very shy and you're having a hard time handling him without him being terrified, sometimes introducing a friend makes the pigs much braver. Of course this isn't always the case but it does happen.   Like someone else mentioned, once you have a large enough cage, caring for 2 pigs is not that much different than caring for one. You should really consider getting a second one, they will really be that much happier, I promise you!   Sometimes people worry that getting a second piggy will make their first one not love them as much. This may or may not happen. You really don't know how they will react until they meet. The one thing you do know is that they will be much happier together than they will ever be on their own. As a pig parent their health and happiness should be your main concern. Your feelings should come second to theirs (I mean this in the nicest way possible!) and besides, you will ALWAYS be the giver of yummy food and treats! They will always love you for this!   I know you said you have lots of free time to spend with him but you can never replace what another pig can do for him! Just like he can't replace what another human can do for you!   I know we all have different situations and circumstances so I don't mean for any of this to sound mean or judgmental! I myself, just recently got my piggy a friend after 4 months of him being alone. So just take your time and when you're ready adopt a little guy from your local shelter!   Good luck with your baby and I wish you both the best! :)"
guineapigs,359qeg,kittie_s0ckmilk,1 point,Sat May 9 01:19:13 2015 UTC,I think you'd still be better off with two pigs. They are much happier in pairs even if you can spend lots of time with your pig. But all pigs are different so there is no real way to tell ahead of time.

Don't let them out on the grass at rest stops. It seems like a good idea, but people traveling with their dogs let them out in those grassy areas and you don't want your piggy catching anything. If possible have them travel in their regular cage, load it up with hay, and they won't know the difference.   And don't roll the windows down too much. Hay. Hay everywhere."

Make sure their cage rests flat in the back seat. Most seats have an incline to support human posture, so tuck some rolled up towels or small books underneath, where necessary."

Although it's easier not to change everything in every frame, it doesn't always look natural. For example when he first starts walking, only his feets and face are moving but his butt is oddly still. Same for when he's yawning, the body isn't really that still. Just a little change here and there to make it less still would do wonders! After he rolls over and flops, it's just amazing!

I'm positive a 30 minute drive would be no problem for your piggies! I have some dramatic pigs and even they didn't care about the journey and transporting them in and out of the car when we got to hotels and such. Just make sure their carrier is stationary and safe, and that they're not in direct sunlight or any heat. Maybe give them a few slices of cucumber or pepper to distract them during the drive.

Once one of them landed on the pigloo on her back, which was terrifying for a little bit but she didn't appear to be hurt at all. After one too many similar incidents I started cupping them, one hand supporting them under their rump and belly, the other on top of their neck/back, which seems to keep them from jumping so far. Dunno if that works for all pigs or just mine, but it may be worth a try."
guineapigs,34xyau,Frida_P,2,Wed May 6 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, anything can cause damage with bad luck or a bad landing.  However, just a controlled jump in itself is ok as such. My guineas like to jump up and down from their houses, for example, without them taking any damage. The difference here is of course that they do it unstressed and at their own pace. When they are eager to jump from your hand to get back, that is more likely to go wrong.  You should have a look whether the guinea eats and moves normally - and be even more careful in the future when you put them back."

guineapigs,34wer5,Snakeofsolid,1 point,Tue May 5 18:23:34 2015 UTC,Aren't they lactose intolerant?
guineapigs,34wer5,Abyssinius,1 point,Tue May 5 22:46:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's more complicated than a yes/no scenario. When my piggy was sick with a stomach bug, his vet (who is very well known in the area as a good exotics vet and very well versed in guinea pigs) told me to give him small amounts (<1mL) of plain yogurt for a few days to repopulate his gut bacteria. So I'm guessing their lactose intolerance is like humans, there are degrees, and most are not 100% intolerant. I'm somewhat lactose intolerant, and there's a threshold of dairy I can have above which I will get sick, and I'm pretty good at knowing what foods I can and can't eat or how much I can eat. There are people I know who can't have ANY dairy product at all, but I think there's also more people out there who are like me. I think people advise against the yogurt covered treats for piggies because there's just too much yogurt on those to use as a regular treat, but if it's something you give a small piece of once or twice a month, it's probably fine."
guineapigs,34wer5,phyi,1 point,Wed May 6 00:22:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think they do well with large amounts of dairy, but as with most things, moderation is key. He really only ate the carrot candle and my dog ate the rest :)"
guineapigs,34x44e,bangbaby,2,Tue May 5 07:54:06 2015 UTC,"I don't have any good advice on what to do for the eye, besides taking her to the vet, but from what you've described it doesn't sound like a piggy 911 emergency :) Some eye issues can be uncomfortable for the pig, but as long as she's eating, pooping, and isn't getting crusty/drippy eyes, she's good. It's always upsetting when something's up with a guinea pig, but I think she'll be fine until she sees the vet at the end of the week."

guineapigs,34tfq7,superevie,3,Mon May 4 12:33:46 2015 UTC,"You won't have to expand by much, it's recommend that you have 1.2 sq meters or a 2x5 C and C cage, with a minimum of 1 sq meter which is a 2x4. It's not insane to have 3 boars living together. I would recommend a 2x5 C and C cage so your boars will fight less. They should get along, you will notice in the first few days displays of dominance. More space helps with less fights so that way they feel they have there own space.   Would love to see updates on your new expansion"
guineapigs,34tfq7,cosmicguineapig,2,Mon May 4 13:50:08 2015 UTC,"I recently got a third boar myself. I had an 8 month old and a 2 month old that were a bonded pair. Then I rescued a 2 year old. Originally I had a very large C&C cage with a loft and was trying to keep all 3 pigs together, but the 8 month old and the 2 year old do not get along at all. They fight constantly. I had to separate them.  As it has turned out, the 8 month old is now in a cage by himself, since he started fighting with the baby and the baby and 2 year old are in a cage together and are completely happy. I just think my 8 month old (my original pig, by the way) is just a jerk.  So, there's nothing wrong with trying 3 pigs at once, just be prepared to tear your cage apart and have to come up with other situations. I now have a bonded pair different from what I originally started with, but at least everyone gets along."
guineapigs,34tfq7,Kahlia29,2,Mon May 4 13:50:45 2015 UTC,"I recently added an adult boar (1 year) to my 2 adult boars (2 years and 1.5 yr), and all three get along now. Babies should be easier to introduce, so there's hope! Though I think they'll always have factions. My first 2 boars definitely spend more time together than either with the new one, but they don't fight anymore (they did at first). I definitely thought I was crazy to want a third boar when I fell in love with him and just HAD to have him, and I felt crazy for about 2 or 3 weeks after getting him because it was just... difficult... but it worked out :) Good luck! (be ready for a few weeks of possibly rough times)"
guineapigs,34tfq7,Abyssinius,1 point,Mon May 4 21:20:00 2015 UTC,I have 3 in a 2x5 cc cage and it worked well for a long time with my three boars (one is almost 3 and the other two are about 8 months from the same litter) but I also had to pull one of the 8 month olds and put him alone because he was biting the other baby and leaving welts and scabs. I would just say be careful if they are around puberty age because that is when I'm told the dominance behavior really comes out.
guineapigs,34tfq7,xxshixx,1 point,Mon May 4 14:54:28 2015 UTC,What ages does puberty typically run?
guineapigs,34tfq7,xxshixx,1 point,Mon May 4 15:08:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not actually sure, i think around 7 months and up, depends on the pig and some don't really get aggressive, only one of mine did."

Also, if he doesn't have a friend please get him one!"
guineapigs,34pyvh,AllyPent,8,Sun May 3 19:09:46 2015 UTC,Patches is adorable :)  If that's a standard store bought cage and not temporary you need to get him a bigger one.

Yes, as a lot of people have pointed out he doesnt have a deluxe super swanky cage with 8 floors and a mini roomba to clean his poop. (Thats a good idea, lets find someone to make that) However, hes outside of his house most of the time anyway. Only time he really goes in there is for meal times or bed time. We dont know everything; and are willing to take advice if it sounds solid.  Im assuming you have some piggies at home yourself, so ill end with saying: Hope your peegs are living the good lyfe.

He looks like he's happy, and if he's getting plenty of out-of-cage-time, I'm sure he'll be fine.  We're in the process of building a C&C cage for our three girls so they can finally room together (we have a big pig with issues) and it's taken a long time to get her acclimated to the baby pigs.

guineapigs,34pyvh,i_am_ms_greenjeans,1 point,Tue May 5 00:13:11 2015 UTC,"I am kind of confused by all the massive distrust of everything that's not a fleece-lined C&C cage on here. I feel like every time someone posts a picture of their pig in an enclosure that doesn't look just like everyone else's there are always a swarm of ""your cage is too small, switch to C&C"" comments, even when you can't even see enough of the cage to really gauge how big it is, like in your picture.   I guess it's better to err on the side of people being annoyed rather than risk a pig living in poor conditions due to an owner's ignorance, but I wish people would just check to see if someone else had already said what they feel needed to be said, upvote that one and just move on. Or even reply to that comment with a ""yes I agree"", instead of repeating what's already been said as if it hadn't. Even though the comments are usually pretty politely worded, sometimes this place feels really judgmental.  ...that kind of ended up being a rant. Sorry D:"

guineapigs,34rqe6,otterwithaknife,1 point,Mon May 4 00:10:22 2015 UTC,Give her .3mL of infant simethecone twice daily. I would also suggest ordering a syringe of BeneBac off of Amazon. This stuff did the trick for my pig when he was bloated - good luck!
guineapigs,34rqe6,sammg37,1 point,Mon May 4 02:19:09 2015 UTC,Is that like pedialyte? I was considering adding that to her water to get her rehydrated.
guineapigs,34rqe6,sammg37,1 point,Mon May 4 02:39:48 2015 UTC,"Simethecone is an anti - gas formula. It basically chews up gas bubbles so they're easier to expel or reabsorb. You can find it at your local drugstore, just make sure you get the infant kind (it's liquid). BeneBac will help reestablish a healthy gut flora for recovery and prevention of similar issues.   I don't know if pedialyte is safe for pigs - might want to research that."

guineapigs,34re4z,garamasala,3,Sun May 3 22:21:33 2015 UTC,Guinea pigs can be skittish for the first couple of weeks. It would really help if you got him a companion. Guinea pigs are herd animals and are happier and more social in groups. Maybe try petting him when your giving him snacks or maybe more cuddle time can help. Just be ready for a few poops.

guineapigs,34re4z,Switch187u,2,Tue May 5 15:12:43 2015 UTC,You have to put some work into getting a baby pig to sit and cuddle in your lap. It'll take time and daily lap time. We take our pigs out of their cage multiple times a day for lap time and our youngest pig still doesn't really sit still in our laps. Our older pigs do... but they always seem more comfortable stretching out and relaxing when we take two pigs (or all 3 of them) out at once.

It said the noise they make while under pressure can be quite alarming if you've never heard it before but that as long as no one is being hurt, you shouldn't try to intervene.   I'm glad they're getting along just fine now! :)"

guineapigs,34n1so,Zaphy1415926,3,Sat May 2 17:30:48 2015 UTC,I envy your artistry. I especially like the cartoony style. Any chance of piggy photos?
guineapigs,34n1so,EllaTheCat,3,Sat May 2 17:36:05 2015 UTC,"here they are a few weeks ago waiting for me to finish cleaning their cage. They're bigger now c: I don't have any recent photos though because they've gotten a lot less shy since I got them, and they don't sit still very well!"
guineapigs,34n1so,CMRescueAdvocate,2,Sat May 2 17:40:17 2015 UTC,How adorable. You have a great artistic ability!
guineapigs,34n1so,aerial_flip,3,Thu May 14 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"Nice drawings and cute piggies, but guinea pigs do not have tails :c  Edit: They also have four toes in their front feet, not too sure this wasn't a style decision :)"
guineapigs,34n1so,Emarelda,4,Sat May 2 19:11:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean technically they do have tails, they're just little nub-things. I realize that the nubs on a guinea pig don't stick out like my drawing does and instead just kind of give the rump a slightly pointed shape though. The tail buns were an attempt to denote that shape, I knew it wasn't completely accurate but I thought it was cute enough to justify the slight divorce from reality. Something that I've been working on lately in my art is trying to focus on design over anatomy actually, as trying to ensure that I get all the little joints and junk in there has resulted in poorer design from me in the past.  It is good to know that this one went too far in the wrong direction! Hopefully in the future I will be able to strike a better balance of the two sides in my art. Thank you for your comment!   (three toes is staying though, that's already an industry convention haha)"

guineapigs,34nkod,sixxpackjack,1 point,Sat May 2 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"I found the same thing when I was researching a few months ago, so instead of picking one list to go by I chose the veggies that were shared by multiple lists as daily veggies!   I get the organic spring mix (large plastic container) and feed them a bit of that with 2-3 other veggies, and rotate those every other day. Green bell peppers, cilantro, parsley, red leaf lettuce, green leaf lettuce. Those are my go-tos! I use baby carrots and cucumbers as treats only, especially if I'm clipping nails or post-bath time! :D The piggies have seemed very happy with that so far!"
guineapigs,34nkod,shmimsy,1 point,Mon May 4 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"They usually eat carrots like candy. Also, leafy greens are great!"
guineapigs,34nkod,lovecraftians_unite,1 point,Sat May 9 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"I give vegetables that are lower in calcium and oxalate and with a good calcium-phosphorus balance. These include green leaf lettuce, red leaf lettuce, butter lettuce, curly endive, and sometimes I give sprigs of cilantro.  I avoid cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage due to the risk of gas and bloating. I also try to avoid those high in calcium and oxalate for guinea pigs older than 6 months which includes spinach, zucchini, beet, parsley, kale, collard greens, arugula (rocket), and mustard greens.  Carrots are a bit starchy so I only give them in very small amounts as a once in a great while treat. Same with things like yams and sweet potato. Fruits tend to have a higher sugar content so the same rule applies. Once in awhile they will get a couple of blueberries or cranberries."

guineapigs,34io78,lauraporah,2,Fri May 1 14:07:08 2015 UTC,"I think one of my boys has a habit of zoning out - he'll stand on top of his house and just...bob his head back and forward while he breathes? Dunno if that's what Bea's doing, but if it's anything like that, it's probably harmless. If in doubt, take her to the vet. I've noticed it's only something Biz does in his favorite places, so I'm assuming it's just a sign that your pig is comfy enough to let their attention go, and do silly things in the process."
guineapigs,34io78,sammg37,2,Fri May 1 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"Reading this is very reassuring! Maybe she was just zoned out - I was just concerned with how jerky the movement was. I know it wasn't a seizure because that is a more severe thing, but it was so startling to see because none of my other guinea pigs do it. I'm going to keep an eye on her."
guineapigs,34io78,sammg37,2,Fri May 1 14:48:18 2015 UTC,"If what we're observing is the same thing, yeah it is pretty jerky! Biz is also my only pig that does it. See if she freaks out when you get her attention, like startling her from being zoned out (Biz gets really startled when I say hi if he's doing that). From my experience, it's not an issue and I really do chalk it up to a funny pig behaviour that comes from being comfortable and stepping down on alertness. Your Bea might not be comfy with people, but she's probably more than comfortable at home. :]"
guineapigs,34io78,superevie,1 point,Fri May 1 14:53:51 2015 UTC,Hopefully then it's just because she's comfortable and zoned out. I just never saw her do it before and she's always laying and relaxing.

guineapigs,34eska,theymightbejenny,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:21:14 2015 UTC,"While I completely agree with this, I have found that at a few of my local Petco stores, they have had abandoned piggies for adoption. People have dropped them off for whatever reason, and from the ones that I've seen, they are well cared for and have come with cages, some bedding, food and water dishes. In fact, my first pig was adopted from a Petco, and he came with a good marchioro cage, fleece blanket, food and water dishes, pellets and bedding, and all they asked for was a $25 adoption fee. It's also worth noting that if the stores do have piggies up for adoption, they tend to be older pigs who probably wouldn't be picked if someone was going to a store to get a first time pig."

My piggy has has a foot like that for ages but it seemed to develop more as she got bigger. Do patches grow? She shows no signs of any issues but I just thought it was weird and the contours of the foot just exaggerates the strangeness."

The entire salad totals to about a cup per pig, a bit packed. Occasionally an apple core (seeds removed) when I eat apples. If I'm cooking corn I'll save the silk and inner layers of husk and give them that in place of the usual salad, they love it :)"
guineapigs,34azge,Abyssinius,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:52:07 2015 UTC,"Switch it up throughout the week! As long as it's mostly lettuce and adds up to a cup per pig, it's enough.  Other good options include cilantro, other bell peppers (red, yellow), cucumber (seeds removed). You should give fruit about once a week. A slice of orange is a good option.  We avoid broccoli and cauliflower because of the gas."

No apples, citrus, broccoli or cauliflower. We found this list http://www.happycavy.com/what-can-guinea-pigs-eat/ (printed it) to be an invaluable resource for figuring out their diet when we were noob piggy parents.  We shave carrots or parsnip into their regular spring mix they seem to digest it better this way than chunky carrot bits. Parsnips are cheap 1 large parsnip has lasted us 10+ feedings. Sometimes cucumber, bell pepper, sweet peppers or radicchio (we ration our guys go mad for this!)   When our garden gets going we plan to work in herbs and seasonal goodies."

Cut it into small bits and mix it in with the food. I think he is just unfamiliar with veggies if he hasn't had any before other than bell peppers. One of my piggies used to be very picky with her veggies and I would just always have it around for her to eat. Eventually, she just started eating it more and now she prefers it over anything!"

Make sure you have a big enough cage. The links should have the dimensions proper for the number you have/are getting. GET HIM/HER A PIGGIE FREIND (if they do not have one obviously)! This cannot be stressed enough. They are social creatures, and if you do not give them a friend they will not be happy. Make sure they are the same gender though or they will make piggie babies, which is not always wanted. Also, the two will need to be isolated from each other for the first few weeks to make sure no unwanted diseases come across.  Leave the guinea pig alone for the first week. Especially if the poor thing has not been cared for much or has been handled improperly, he or she will not want to be around anyone for a good while. Stick your hand in the cage to feed, and be kind and gentle around him or her for a while. Again, the links will help a ton! :) Finally, if you can take them to the vet pretty quick for a checkup. If the family is willing to let the piggie out into the wild, they probably have not cared for it enough to take care of him/her with vet care or nail care.    Good luck! I just got my two piggies a few months ago and have loved every minute of it! You will do fine! :)"

It's funny to watch them fight over who gets what when I'm placing veggies in the cage though.   Your cage looks like it's too small for your pigs. If it's not a temporary one I suggest visiting http://www.guinealynx.info/housing.html and look in to building a C&C cage for your pigs.
guineapigs,33u1w0,Moonical,3,Sat Apr 25 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"I would give them maybe a day or 2 to settle in, but make sure you feed them veggies with your hands a lot because that makes them trust you more. Make sure when you pick them up, do it slowly and securely. Sometimes they flail and you don't want to drop them! Make a little hole out of a blanket or a towel and have them sit next to you or on you while you pet them. They will eventually fall asleep! Start with maybe 5-10 minutes . don't be surprised if they pee or poop while you have them out. It happens! Good luck with your new babies!"

guineapigs,33ucop,Jeslovespets,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:33:24 2015 UTC,"IMO, the best way to tell if something is mold is to see how quickly it grows (I am suspicious it is mold). If it's gotten worse overnight, throw ALL the seedlings away - they might be carrying more spores on them that will start to grow shortly. Don't try to rise them off or clean them - fungi are crafty and have evolved to adhere to surfaces in the environment.   EDIT: Also, if you move the seedlings around and the fuzz kind of sticks together and moves as one object, that's also a tipoff."

guineapigs,33s26q,Captain-Zebra-Tits,1 point,Sun May 3 19:34:20 2015 UTC,"Some people think fleece is too much work, but I personally like it. Once you invest in the fleece, you don't have to pay for bedding regularly like with the disposable kind. We spent about $25 for two pieces of fleece large enough to cover our 10.5sq foot cage with some fleece to spare to cover the loft area and such.  You have to pre-wash the fleece without fabric softener/dryer sheets 3 or more times to get the fabric to wick properly. Once that is achieved, the pig pee is wicked through the fleece to towels/puppy pads/moving pads underneath so the fleece stays dry. We sweep their poop up once a day with a little hand broom and do a full fleece change once a week, alternating between the two sets we have."
guineapigs,33s26q,whiterabbit108,1 point,Sat Apr 25 10:34:05 2015 UTC,"How do you know when your fleece has been washed enough to wick properly? I'm new to all this, like OP. Thanks!"
guineapigs,33s26q,boldheart,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:07:56 2015 UTC,What we did was test the fleece after we had washed it 3x. So I put a corner of the fleece over a puppy pad and smoothed it out and dripped water on it. The water sat on top of the fleece and didn't wick through so I knew I needed to wash it a few more times. I think we actually ended up washing all of our fleece about 6 times before it would wick right but the amount of times really depends on the fleece and on your washer/dryer.
guineapigs,33s26q,whiterabbit108,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:05:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your answer. Do I need to use any kinds of soap when I wash it to wick it, and do I dry it on high heat?"
guineapigs,33s26q,boldheart,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:20:21 2015 UTC,"No problem. We use mild laundry detergent (the kind that isn't super scented) that has no added fabric softener plus a little white vinegar. The whole idea behind washing the fleece a bunch of times is that you need to break down the protective barrier coating the fleece fibers that makes the fleece sort of water proof. If you pour water on brand new fleece it will just bead up and roll off the fleece. Using dryer sheets and such adds to this layer and makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to get the fleece to wick properly. The laundry detergent (with no fabric softener- that is very important!) will help break down the barrier on the fleece so that it will wick. We do dry our fleece on high heat to help kill bacteria, but while preparing the fleece I don't think it is really necessary."
guineapigs,33s26q,whiterabbit108,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:43:45 2015 UTC,Is there a 'wrong' kind of fleece? :( I bought 2 remnants from Jo-Ann Fabrics yesterday and I've washed them at least 8 times but it doesn't seem to be working. The water still just sits on top. No softener in the detergent or anything.
guineapigs,33s26q,boldheart,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:41:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. I don't think there is a wrong kind of fleece, but I know some types of fleece wick faster than others. I would try using detergent that doesn't have fabric softener in it. The detergent will help break down the barrier on the fleece fibers. It took a lot of washes for our fleece to wick properly too.. Make sure you are testing the fleece with something absorbent under it like towels or puppy pads too."
guineapigs,33s26q,whiterabbit108,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:58:06 2015 UTC,"Well, it finally changed! I've been testing it over a towel. It actually seems to absorb the water, though, because the towel underneath doesn't really get wet at all? I have it in the washer again, hoping it will work..."

guineapigs,33mrm7,Jeslovespets,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:29:39 2015 UTC,I always used to study on my bed with my peeg in the blankets or on my lap. Sometimes if I had to hunch over I'd let him sit on my shoulder.
guineapigs,33o226,ricebeard,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:23:32 2015 UTC,I love their look when they eat large leaves or something like that. They look so happy.
guineapigs,33of9u,Madiusa,3,Fri Apr 24 04:32:21 2015 UTC,"Poor thing! So glad she's with you now.  I have no experience with this, but I think getting another pig to accompany her may help with her nervousness. Try giving her veggies and treats by hand so she comes up to you instead of you going to her. You can also scatter veggies around her cage/area (including the ramps) to encourage her to explore.  I did that with my pig, and now she just bumbles over to me and puts her front feet on me to get her treats.   The most important thing is patience and spending time every day with her. It took almost exactly one year for my pig to warm up to me. She used to dash into her hidey hole when I made any movements, but now she couldn't be bothered and is actually looking to be petted!"
guineapigs,33of9u,Brynhild,2,Fri Apr 24 12:05:32 2015 UTC,"It make take a long time, but she will come around if you keep showing her the love you're giving her now! And treats. Lots of treats, heh. I had to train my pigs to use the ramps by leaving a trail of lettuce - they learn very quickly. Maybe instead of giving them one or two big treats during the day, give her lots of small ones when you walk by (especially when you pick her up or pet her) so she starts to associate people with good things. If she doesn't like being handled, pet her in her cage for a bit so she feels more secure. It's always helpful to pop your hand in and let it hang out for a second first as a way to announce yourself so you don't catch them off guard. Good luck! Socializing a pig like that is frustrating, but there are so many satisfying little victories."
guineapigs,33of9u,sammg37,2,Fri Apr 24 14:34:25 2015 UTC,"Older guinea pigs usually don't care for ramps so it's better to have everything in one level. I've heard they can get arthritis or joint pain with age like humans. I know my older guinea pig won't even stand for a ramp that has about a 2 inch incline. Also I've had my guinea pigs for awhile and they love being pet and held, but they hate being picked up. They'll run around and hide in their igloos, just as yours does, and fight being picked up. But once their being securely held they popcorn and happy squeal and purr and nap in my arms. So don't be too worried if he/she doesn't enjoy the action of being picked up."
guineapigs,33of9u,mentalforks,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:52:03 2015 UTC,She needs a buddy. Guinea pigs are very social creatures. Getting another female guinea (younger the easier) will really help her feel comfortable and contented. There is no way for us to socialize enough that would ever beat having a good friend to live with.
guineapigs,33of9u,ailorn,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:39:27 2015 UTC,How do I find out how old she is? I read somewhere you can guesstimate their age by how much they poop but I don't know how accurate that is.
guineapigs,33of9u,ailorn,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:56:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to guess her age. At this point I can only guess if it's a young pig or an old pig. Her age doesn't matter nearly as much as the new one's age. Guineas are more likely to accept baby or young guineas than an adult guinea into their cage, and girls are more likely to accept a friend than boys. Check local rescues or craig's list."
guineapigs,33of9u,tookMYshovelwithme,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:02:05 2015 UTC,"Time and love.  I was in a similar situation.  When we first got Monty (we gave her a new name for a new life as well), I literally set up my camera on wi-fi, to see if she ever came out of her igloo when I wasn't around.  Her previous owner left for university, and the family gave her away before the owner came back for Christmas break because they had zero interest in her.  She was stuffed in a cramped cage without even hay (they said it was a treat, a sometimes food).   Her feet were encrusted with poop inside her long curly nails.  She didn't like to be touched on the rump, and the vet pointed out she probably had calcium deficiency and scurvy.  We first introduced her to fresh hay daily and nutrient rich foods.    She hated being picked up, she hated people walking by her cage, she only tolerated lap time because she was too scared to move, and would pee on you.  We gave her affection every morning and every evening though, even when she protested.  We built a C&C for her to romp around in, with things to chew and play with, and places to hide.  After a couple months we bought her a companion.  Now she's still naturally skittish, (all piggies are), but we have her wick pushed back, and she accepts handling, floor time, nail trimmings bath swims and blow drys.  She will wander out of her cage with her head held up high, sniffing around.  She's happy being handled and will let you know with a pee dance or a gentle tug on your shirt if it's time to go back in her home.    To be honest, I don't think we'd recognize the piggy we have today from the one we rescued since she's become so much better adjusted.    TL:DR  Sorry about the novel but going from neglect to a loving pet takes:    Working on those nails  Daily handling  Exercise/Floor time  An appropriate sized and maintained cage  Proper diet with limitless hay, adequate pellets and fresh veggies  Chin tickles as required   They are social animals, but there're lunch sized for pretty much every predator on earth, so they are jumpy and always will be.  She will come around, but it may take some time, and when she does it will be very rewarding.    Good luck.  PM me if you need any other info as we've ""been there, done that""."
guineapigs,33of9u,tookMYshovelwithme,2,Fri Apr 24 16:30:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'm considering giving her a new name as she doesn't respond to her current name at all (doesn't move her head or make any movement). Today I trimmed her nails. Her quicks were not as far out as we thought they were, but she was shaking like a leaf the whole time so we didn't push it with her. I bought her a chew brick that PetSmart recommended. Hopefully she will start to warm up."

guineapigs,33olkb,Vi_Stands4,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't have a sewing machine either so i used a hot glue gun to fuse the fleece together, just make sure if you do this you glue it in the same manner you'd sew it, flipping the fleece inside out and gluing 3/4 sides then pulling it back to the proper side via the hole you left and just carefully gluing the last side shut while tucked in. For the potty pads and smaller bits i cut strips about an inch wide and inch or so deep into the fleece edges and double knotted them accordingly, cage turned out very nice."
guineapigs,33olkb,L00k_Again,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:16:49 2015 UTC,"I just made a no sew hammock/shelter for my girls. Just cut a triangle of fleece for the cage corner and three strips of fleece for ties, poke a hole in each corner of the fabric using scissors, slip a tie through each hole and tie to the cage wires. Took less than 5 minutes.  You can also buy a no sew glue at craft stores if you want to try making your own things. You apply it so that it's not exposed along the seams. I usually can't get past the price stores charge for simple fleece items."
guineapigs,33ogwq,caffeineassisted,2,Fri Apr 24 04:50:58 2015 UTC,"What quantity of pellets do you give them? I have 3 girls (8yr, 6yrs, 3 yrs) who live together and have always given them 1/8cup of pellets per pig. They rarely finish them and they aren't  super important if they're  getting a variety of veggies anyway. I always give the  oldest hand fed veggies to make sure she gets enough. I also found that if i give them fresh hay a few minutes after veggies the youngest leave the veggies alone."
guineapigs,33ogwq,GuineaPigOverlord,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:43:10 2015 UTC,"I give about an 1/8 cup a day per pig as well. I have been going by site, but I think I am going to get a plastic cup and mark a line on it with how much pellets they should get to make sure I am not overfeeding them, especially since Hazel is the one eating the majority of the pellets.   The problem with the hay idea is that the oldest pig, who I want to make sure is getting enough food, gets majorly distracted by hay. I used to give them a hay refill right after I put the veggies in, but noticed the other two would get all the veggies while Oreo would go and chomp on hay.   Oreo seems to be a good weight as of now, so at least we are not worrying about that too much. But I always worry about her otherwise because she is getting to be an elderpig."
guineapigs,33ogwq,poxyfairy,1 point,Sat Apr 25 05:03:08 2015 UTC,"Feed enough for 1 pig and feed the others separately.  I have 2 pigs and one hogs it all and is so fat while the other is skinny.  I have to supervise veggie time, or the one will start stealing the other pig's food, even if she has some of hers left.  It's annoying, but really the only solution.  Can't stop a pig from eating if it's there."
guineapigs,33ogwq,poxyfairy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:06:48 2015 UTC,"Yea we currently supervise veggie time too. When we give a baby carrot for a snack, Hazel will eat hers, then go seek out Oreo and wait till Oreo has a mouthful and steal the piece of carrot in front of her. During leafy veggie time though she doesn't seem to bother Oreo too much which is good. When would you feed the other two, during floor time? Or put a cage divider in during pellet time?"

guineapigs,33mbrj,meowzzzies,8,Thu Apr 23 18:06:57 2015 UTC,"I let my two pigs graze on my lawn. They can mow down ~8-10 square feet per day before they get full and snooze. I have an open-bottomed pen that I put them in to keep them safe, and move it regularly so they have fresh grass.   Unfortunately, they don't do the most even job, so my lawn ends up looking very patchy and I mow it anyway. Plus, its often too hot or too cold to put them out (or maybe I just baby them a bit).  But at least they are not soiling their cage for those few hours, so that is a positive.   Plus, they love it and it's adorable to watch them grazing.   I have wondered if with enough pigs, I wouldn't have to mow at all. Something to try once I am retired."

It always surprises me how fast they can eat all the grass, and they get so excited when it gets moved. They were very confident in their home and its safety the dogs or cats no matter how interested in them. The guinea pigs were never shaken. They would go right up and smell the other animals. I was always worried a raccoon might figure out how to open it, But they never did. The cage was big enough That myself or my kids could go in and play with them. At my old house i never mowed the front lawn the guinea pigs took care of it. We did this for 5 years till the last one passed away last summer."

guineapigs,33nwpb,floodingthestreets,2,Fri Apr 24 03:10:07 2015 UTC,"It's 14 days for Petsmart.  I think just refund the purchase price or provide a ""replacement"" versus covering the cost of vet care."

guineapigs,33mml4,Kaia95,13,Thu Apr 23 19:25:32 2015 UTC,"Aggressive? Guinean pigs are, on avarege, pretty much the least aggressive pets I've experienced.  Anyway, I find them friendly, alert, chatty, curious, and sometimes very cautious. Some pigs will never be all that comfortable with being lifted up.  I've done things differently in the past, but the way I keep guinea pigs now is that I hardly pick mine up at all. They are free range in my living room 24/7, and I just make sure to only feed them in their cage so I never have to chase them. I call, they come running.  You'd think that makes them more feral, but it doesn't. In stead, I spend a good deal of time on the floor with them, and often stop to pet them quickly before moving on when I'm going about my day. They're still interested in contact, and love sniffing things I'm carrying. (Like I'm bringing clean towels to the bathroom, and I stop to let them sniff briefly, or I'm carrying a DVD case or whatever.)  The trick with guinea pigs like that is to give them veggie treats often, so they know you're the awesome veggie-giver.  Also, this one great piece of advice that I live by: If you have a less cuddly pig, always stop petting it before it runs away! That way the petting stops because you chose it, not because the pig escaped. Over time it won't think of a petting as something to escape at all."
guineapigs,33mml4,Svataben,3,Thu Apr 23 22:23:25 2015 UTC,"I have 3, they're very different in terms of how they approach you. 2 were rescues, and they're more skittish in general. They don't approach me very often without food, but once I pick them up they're fine and will sit on my lap for a very long time being petted. They'll let me know when they've had enough by pushing my hand away with their nose or walking off my lap. One of them even likes being held to my chest. The other one doesn't, but that might be because he's very large and I have small hands, so he's just not well supported enough to be comfortable for long. The third pig was a pet store pig I adopted from his previous owner. He will come to me to lick my hand and get petted on the head. Sometimes he even nudges his head under my hand so I'll start petting him. But he hates sitting on my lap for petting, he gives out affection on his own terms. He also hates being picked up much more than the other two; he'll kick and squirm until I put him down on my lap. So it depends.   Also depends on how well they know you. They might be nervous with strangers regardless of their actual personality. Sounds like you don't have pigs and have met other people's pigs? Then it's really hard to tell, because my pigs don't behave the same with other people."
guineapigs,33mml4,Abyssinius,3,Thu Apr 23 19:50:04 2015 UTC,It's really dependent on how well socialised they are. Mine will run up for cuddles when she feels like it. My uncle had a couple of rescues who were very timid and hated being touched at all.
guineapigs,33mml4,wanna_hang_out,3,Thu Apr 23 19:51:39 2015 UTC,"I have two and they are completely different. One of them gets scared easily, but calm once she realizes that it is just me and I have a hold of her. She is very easy to grab, will cuddle with you, allow you to pet her, etc. She is the easiest to cut her nails.  The other, she is very friendly and always comes up to me, climbs all over me, BUT only on her term. If I try to grab hold of her, she will run away or try to escape. I have almost dropped her a few times with the amount of squirming she does. Once I sit down with her, she'll run around, climb my body, try to get away, won't let me pet her. Cutting her nails is like preparing for war."
guineapigs,33mq6a,Spectreman17,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:51:58 2015 UTC,"I have 6-8 inch steps for my pigs' cage because my second floor was too high for a straight ramp and I didn't feel like dealing with turns. For my steps, I give at least 10 inches of room in front of the drop for them to comfortably land. 4 inches will be a breeze even for pigs on the smaller side. (I'm speaking for adult pigs.) Though a 4x4 landing might be too small even for a low 4 inch height. I'm gonna say at least 6 inches long, if not more. Maybe set up something temporary and see how comfortable they look coming up and down. I had previously set up something with a few steps and one didn't have enough landing room and no one went up or down that step. Another problem you might encounter is that they'll be scared of going up and down the steps at first, but they'll figure it out. As soon as one does it, the other ones will learn from him, especially if you entice with veggies on the stairs ;)"
guineapigs,33mq6a,Abyssinius,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:37:43 2015 UTC,"Do you think a 6x6 landing would do for a 8 inch climb? My plan is to go up a 16 inch climb, so if i could just cut it in half with a single step, it'd be super easy."
guineapigs,33mq6a,Abyssinius,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"So the one step that my pigs hated before had a 6 inch landing space and was a 6 inch rise. Based on that, I'm gonna guess 6x6 landing for 8 inch rise is way too small. If you only have space for 6 inch space landings, probably wanna stick to the original 4 inch rise plan. But I also have very fat pigs... (one of them is a 4-pounder...)"
guineapigs,33mq6a,Abyssinius,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:17:28 2015 UTC,"I reworked my plans and found something that i think will work. The 6x6 landing for a 5 inch climb and just do 2 steps.  Most of my structure is wood, so I just need to decide whether to use 6x6 post and make it a solid piece, or build it like a table with room underneath.  You used the C&C stuff from Target, right? Do your steps up have any siding for the pigs to use to grip, or is it more like a table style build?"
guineapigs,33mq6a,Abyssinius,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:59:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by table style build? The cube grids are just the support. The floor of the steps are actually fleece flippers (fleece sleeve over a coroplast square, with a layer of uhaul pad inside). So it's still fleece on flat surface, just like the rest of the cage. I think if your steps are made from wood, it'll be fine w/o any additional grippy material."
guineapigs,33mq6a,Abyssinius,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:16:38 2015 UTC,"Im worried more about the siding, not above the shelf, but below. A table style is a freefloating board with legs, where as a solid build is a fully filled cube of wood.  What is under your shelves?"

Then I got a 3rd pig. I thought the bigger cage would be enough, but turned out they're all very active piggies, they needed more room to run around or they'd get on each other's nerves. Renovations to the existing cage was getting too complicated, so I dismantled everything and remade it completely, with new bedding and everything. I know changing their living space too much too often will stress them out, but they really needed this. So I hope I won't have to change anything for a really really long time. But this did give me a chance to do some pretty fleece shopping. :D They do seem happier in the new cage and they fight much less. When one pig pisses off another, there's plenty of room for either of them to run away before a fight starts."

I would ask them to use the one finger rule - take pointer finger, pet him gently from nose to butt.  Ask them to keep their voices down so as not to startle him (even if he's an easy-going pig, a new environment could upset him).  Make sure they wash their hands before and after your visit, explain his likes/dislikes, share a funny story about him, talk about his needs and cage requirements.  Some kids aren't going to want to pet him, and make sure they all understand those feelings are okay.  Good luck.    Edit:  the teacher in me suggests you think about writing short book ""Luigi's Adventures as a Guinea Pig"" or something along those lines, include pictures of him doing the things that pigs do best (napping, eating, etc)."

Make sure you clean out the carrier with a vinegar solution or some other cleaner along those lines to eliminate the cat smell - they'll get anxious if they smell a predator! Also, if you can, attach a water bottle and throw some hay in the bottom."

He has acted no different whatsoever since Big Fudge died...I think he prefers to be alone. When we got him he was alone in his cage, and when we had Big Fudge he really had no interest in him.  Honestly it's probably better that Swarley was alone instead of Big Fudge...BF was definitely more needy of the two of them!"
guineapigs,33j0kc,Captain-Zebra-Tits,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:27:36 2015 UTC,You should try taking him with you to any shelters nearby to introduce him to other pigs.

Now she will go through phases of drinking from it and not drinking from it.  She is also blind.  She can see shadows and light, so we think her vision is just completely blurred to where she can't make anything out.  Not saying your piggy is blind, but this is the case for us.  I've read things like maybe they get enough water from their veggies.  Or, like people, your piggy is just not a drinker (I know I'm not!)    We set up a piggy cam for a while to keep an eye on her to see if she drank when we weren't home.  Well, she didn't.  She's fine in every other aspect."

If not then I do not think that it is legal (at least it isn't where I live) to have both units on the same meter.

When we travel we use the original pet store cage they had for them to live in whilst we are at our parents house and just give them extra floor time. I use fleece in both home and travel cages for familiarity.  For the actual journey they each have a small pet carrier with sawdust and hay in, most of the time they just lay down and sleep because they are used to it.

They still don't purr like I would want them to but they give me little kisses and licks of affection.  When my gran passed they would hug me under my chin.  I can't imagine going a day without seeing them now. Which is why I travel with them.  Brownie just tends to lay in the pet carrier and chill. Asher will wheel til you let him out to have a look at the scenery passing by.  Perhaps I have special pigs that tolerate travel well and seem to even enjoy a little look around :)"

I hope you don't mind me rambling in your thread because here it comes D: I have a sitter for them, our neighbors have two guinea pigs themselves and are leaving for a week right after we get back so we're doing a pigsitting swaperoo. So they're experienced with pigs and everything, which is great. And we're only going to be gone for three days, so that's not too bad... but my pigs just got off antibiotics for URIs, and I'm so afraid that I or my vet have missed something and the infection is still hanging around somewhere, and it'll come back in a terrible way while we're gone especially with the stress of us leaving. I'm so worried because one of them's been on two rounds of antibiotics already, and they're both fairly young still (~3 months), and every time they make a little sneeze my heart stops. Their noses aren't runny or anything, it's just the sneezing (and I just opened a new bag of hay which is quite dusty), but I am so worried I can't sleep and it's 3:30 AM. If I didn't have to go for school I would just stay home and watch them myself, and I'm so worried that my petsitters won't take it seriously if they do start developing symptoms again, and I'm worried they just won't notice until it's too late, and no one takes guinea pigs seriously as pets because they're rodents but I love them so much and I don't know what I'd do if something happened to them, and I've already spent so much on vet bills, and I even have backups for if my pet sitters are unable to take them to the vet, and I wrote down all the symptoms to watch for, and I wrote down my vet's number and the number for the pet ER in case of emergency, and I left behind money in an envelope just in case they need to take em to the vet, but I am just worried sick that all of this won't even matter.
