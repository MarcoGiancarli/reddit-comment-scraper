slashdiablo,3e5eex,coyote931,4,Wed Jul 22 02:21:12 2015 UTC,"I know if I solo BAAL I will be screwed at level 30 in Act 1 Nightmare without the ability to see active normal games (as it would populate nightmare games).   You're actually able to see games from all difficulties here. Once you progress to nightmare you will see all of the Normal and Nightmare games, and after you make it to Hell you will see the games from all three difficulties.  So to find Baal runs just check the game list. Also, make sure you are registered with the general Chat Bot (/w *chat register). You can find people to run normal baal through that.  The big reason to not do your baal quest immediatly is that if you get to level 40 without leaving normal, you would be able to ""bump"" (using your normal and nightmare baal quests) a rush for another player, who will then carry you straight to act V Hell in exchange. After that you can quickly level to 60 in Hell Chaos runs, and then hop straight into the Hell Baals."
slashdiablo,3e5eex,sicklyfish,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:27:18 2015 UTC,"Ok great to know about the normal/nightmare/hell listing of games after i complete normal ( which was a total headache on BNET unless I missed something).  I have been checkin the game list, seems to be few games but hey not complaining as I know its a small server.    I know I didn't register anything, I just followed the guide to join the server.  I will enter the (/w *chat register) and see what happens.  Is this in the guide to register other than the RAID chat thing?"

slashdiablo,3dyfks,TheCox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:40 2015 UTC,Your best bet is WW with something like a death colossus sword then eventually dual grief PB whirlwind. Barbs are not super suited to PvM. Also IK does alright although i'm not sure if anyone found an armor yet. Demon limb is not a very good weapon due to low dmg and most of the dmg coming from fire which many enemies are immune to. also it seems like you don't have any crushing blow from the rest of your gear so you're basically just dealing the phys dmg from those to fire immune enemies which is not much at all.
slashdiablo,3dyfks,scriptgod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:50 2015 UTC,"yeah I switched out to WW and am now using 4 piece IK w/IK Maul. Damage is a little better, AR still in the 83% range, but its not doing too bad, but I still cant kill cows effectively and I still feel very squishy. I will probably need to respec again once I get higher up. But I am almost 80 so I'm sure I can farm some essence and respec if need be.  I know big glaring issues would be ammy, rings, armor and gloves... imo"
slashdiablo,3dyfks,scriptgod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:57 2015 UTC,"People have essence they would give you. You will have higher AR % as you level higher because % chance to hit is also affected by level disparity. Barb will never be effective for cows. You should run travincal in act 3. With a dwarf star on they should do negligible damage.   https://www.reddit.com/r/slashdiablo/comments/wox09/trav_horker_barb_miniguide/  Out of that gear I can say that I have the eth balrog blades and probably runes to make oaths, we found an arreats in chaos so you should be able to get that I think Raesar had it last, you got the angelics stuff, lionheart is easy to make, I got some laying of hands and infernostriders and I also have a SoE I believe."

slashdiablo,3dyfks,scriptgod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:12:41 2015 UTC,"You could put pskulls into the IK weapon for the time being although I think using double shael hits the max fpa for WW so i guess that's better..hmm. Trav is generally the best since you can use find item on them for the double drops and they have real good rune drop chances, also barbs are better for single target stuff compared to giant packs of stuff."
slashdiablo,3dyfks,passport86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:31 2015 UTC,"you mean trav in hell right since im 79? Also, I put two amn runes in there so I could have at least some kind of life leech. Might do the pskull route if I get rid of the manald."

slashdiablo,3dyfks,cancegraf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:24:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm which IK piece are you missing aside from the armor? Gloves will give 10% dual leech, and you'll get 20% DR from the 5-piece set bonus which will make you a lot less squishy. Someone's gotta have the rest..  For WW, the only IAS that applies is what you have on your weapon, so you'll either have 6 frame WW and socket whatever in the maul or if you put 2 shaels/2 IAS jewels you'll go to 4 frame, which is the fastest achievable speed."

slashdiablo,3dvyaq,keifkeif,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:15:56 2015 UTC,The drama posts were so annoying. I was happy to see the Ko rune thing start because I thought everyone was taking the drama shit seriously.

slashdiablo,3dvyaq,Skarless,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:24:04 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it was really just there to distract from the subreddit drama. I'd take Ko posts over drama posts any day.

slashdiablo,3duojr,-evasian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:58:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even wait that long.  Posting about soj sales is usually discouraged because of the impact on the server performance from so many people 4-boxing to get annis. it only takes about 60 seconds to make 4 games.  DO EET NAO imo.

I've seen following pricing several times:  Key to Key     1 hkey : 1 tkey : 1,5-2 dkey      Rune to Keyset 1/1/1      Um : 1 Keyset (1/1/1) or Mal : 2 Keysets (2/2/2) or Mal : 8 Keys (any order)     Rune to Keyset 3/3/3     Ist : Keyset (3/3/3)     Rune to Organ      Mal : Organ   To make this clear: This is not a recommendation - It's just an observation over the past weeks. I prefer going with Ist for (3/3/3)."
slashdiablo,3dsgro,overthink_everything,6,Sun Jul 19 00:46:40 2015 UTC,"From Pul to Ohm each rune is worth two of the one below it. For example, Ist = Mal + Mal. I've listed to approximate values of the other HR's below. Some people may think differently but this is an approximation of what is the fair going rate.    Lo = 1.5 Ohm (Ohm Vex) Sur = 2.5 - 3 Ohm Ber = 5 - 6 Ohm Jah = 5 - 6 Ohm Cham = Vex Zod = Ohm (should be Ohm Vex though)"
slashdiablo,3dsgro,scompin,3,Sun Jul 19 01:03:12 2015 UTC,"Pul < Um < Mal < Ist < Gul < Vex < Ohm  For the above, it goes by multiples of two (i.e. 2 Pul = Mal). Once you start dealing with >Ohm in currency, things start operating as Ohm equivalents based on supply and demand.  Jah and Ber are typically valued against one another, usually with a variance of ~1 Ohm (with Ber being more expensive because its popularity in more runewords leads to higher demand), though sometimes significantly more when no one can find a rune for a while and there's high demand. A few ladders ago a Jah was worth Ber + a couple of Ohms.  Sur is valued directly against Ber as half a Ber, because 2 Surs cube to Ber. Lo varies between 1.5-2 Ohm, sometimes a little lower on the bottom end depending on demand. It's usually separated from just being 1/2 a Sur or 1/4th of a Ber because there's some demand for Lo in runewords.  Cham isn't that useful, so it often varies between Vex/Ohm, often based on whether someone needs to cube a Zod.  Finally, there's a little wiggle room at how each individual values a rune, usually based around how many Ohms they feel a Ber/Jah is worth. I arbitrarily value Sur as 2.5 Ohms, which makes Ber 5 and Jah 4-6 (closer to the low/mid side currently) depending on demand. I usually value a Cham around Vex or <Ohm, unless I need one or I have a 2nd one and someone else needs a Zod. I'll also pay more for speed if I can finish an item that day - it doesn't mean I think the rune is worth more, but it means I think finishing Infinity today is worth more than finishing it in 2-7 days."
slashdiablo,3dsgro,sorasonline,2,Sun Jul 19 01:08:17 2015 UTC,"Generally anything Pul+ is the value of whatever cubes into it.  So 2 Gul = Vex, 2 Mal = Ist kind of thing.  The values are a little weird past Ohm, and they don't follow anything close to this rule at after Ber."

slashdiablo,3dsgro,cantgetenoughsushi,2,Sun Jul 19 17:08:24 2015 UTC,I recommend to start by learning the order of runes from Pul to Zod. Always have it ready in a browser tab or on a piece of paper until you know it. It will make it so much easier.

Basically, all of the server regulars and people that are geared up to help with rushes, killing DClones, Baal runes(many of them are private, as are the Chaos runs and G-Rushes, so Raidcall is a must if you want in on the higher level runs).  You install it, join the Slash Diablo Raidcall channel and join the subchannel with the most people in it. You will most likely hear people talking. You can talk or type and introduce yourself, tell them you are new and ask for a rush.  One thing you will learn very very quickly is that this ain't Bnet. For the most part people here aren't dicks and almost always willing to help out. You can also register for the trade chat and the general chat, so while in game you can see what people are trading and the value, or offer items for trade, or check the value of items. And then general chat people will ask for help with Dclone, or just shoot the breeze.  Slash Diablo is a really awesome server and I am glad I found it."

slashdiablo,3dsiee,-evasian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:43:04 2015 UTC,I won't deny that pits is easy. Only thing is that with ancient tunnels is that usually there's no cold immunes so you don't need to rely on fireball.   Fireball in general is pretty strong and the same goes for blizz. A lot of people forget that orbs damage is sub-par when compared to blizz.   I do personally prefer orb for rushing normal and nightmare though.

The difference is pretty small between the two. Six average damage on the base claw.

slashdiablo,3drb9d,scompin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:50:15 2015 UTC,"GT = 28 avg dmg and Suwayyah = 45.5, with bonuses this is a massive difference. If you use a faster secondary weapon and hit the fastest WW breakpoint the Chaos weapon speed is irrelevant. Also, this is a hybrid PvM."

slashdiablo,3dmp8h,jesusphreke,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:47:40 2015 UTC,"Isn't the explanation more to do with how the mods are erroneously applied in damage calculations, or is that unique to smite and +dmg is always godly?"
slashdiablo,3dmp8h,Syradil,2,Fri Jul 17 17:09:38 2015 UTC,"The mods aren't erroneously applied in the damage calc, only on the LCS. The +damage adds directly onto your weapon (or shield for smite) before any %ED is applied.   For a perfect roll you essentially have a 431-435 damage, one-handed, 40 IAS, indestructible weapon with a base weapon speed of -30 (fastest available), not to mention the DS and other incredible mods.   For smite, you'd add 400 damage onto your shield damage (that's 4x the amount of a level 30 holy shield) which just turns the already overpowered skill into a game changer."
slashdiablo,3dmp8h,sicklyfish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"Ahh okay, thanks. I thought I had previously encountered a legit-only subculture that didn't allow grief weapons or ebugging, but maybe I was mistaken or perhaps it was just a preference on their part."
slashdiablo,3dmp8h,garbagemanz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:42:15 2015 UTC,The +dmg amount is just too damn high. The worst possible grief pb roll will have an average damage of 373.  The best possible eth botd zerker will have an average damage of 365.  This is mostly because the +dmg amount results in an amazing minimum damage.
slashdiablo,3dmp8h,-evasian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:26:35 2015 UTC,Almost strictly just for style.
slashdiablo,3dmp8h,TroutPhishman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:28:51 2015 UTC,"For smite, the ED will make no difference in damage.  For melee skills (zeal, concentrate, etc), it will make a small difference.  The more %ED you have from skills and non-weapon equipment (fort, ed jewels in hat etc), the bigger this difference will be.  For example, my zealot on NL has about 1300% total off-weapon ED when wearing Fortitude.  With syradil's math, the 15ed base will have 4.5 more average damage than the plain base.  This would translate to around 60 extra damage.  This is the kind of thing that could give you a very slight edge in pvp, but would be pretty hard to actually notice, especially considering the range of +dmg grief can vary by 10x the difference between a plain and perfect sup. base.  Personally, if I were using a lightsabre I'd probably have a hard time waiting around for a good base.  If I was using a higher-tier weapon like an Oath, I would have a little more patience.  If I was going to use the Grief on a smiter I would just roll the first 5os PB I came across.  Whatever you decide, I think you will be very satisfied at the increase in killing speed you get with even the lowest possible Grief compared to Lightsabre."

slashdiablo,3dm24l,jalshow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:56:42 2015 UTC,"Idk, the time I play must be different from the hardcore community that I read all about and got excited to join... The only people I really saw in game when I was trying to level up was meanski and Cox. (Meanski is amazingly helpful btw. Wicked cool dude). I love the idea of how helpful everyone sounded and being close and always willing to help and give items, etc etc. So I decided to join hc this ladder after making and gearing a sorc on sc (which I ended up giving her gear away when I started playing hc, stupid me), and it went well for starting, like I said meanski is awesome and literally kept his chanted in my game chanting me while I leveled up :) it was cool. Well some time passed and I end up getting rushed thru to end of Nm, and all night I was asking in chat and making ""help Nm Baal"" games, to no avail. No-one came and helped, so I was just lvling myself, no big deal honestly, but I ended up ripping in a cows game that I was helping a few other lowbies lvl up in. Anyone who knows my hc story knows me and cows don't go together :p then my next char ended up getting a grush, there was a whole group of us, again meanski helped :p and that was pretty sick honestly. For days I made games asking for hell chaos, asked in chat, asked in rc, and even made posts on reddit. Literally days. Ended up ripping while I was lvling up. arcane sanc I believe, was dumb... Lol. but yeah I've had several rips but after that last one that I got grushed and couldn't find any help lvling, I've decided to give up on hc. There's obviously a community on there but they must play at a dif time zone then me, which sucks because like I said I love the feel of it and always being willing to help each other out.. but whatever, shit happens :/ sorry this ended up being a Fucking essay, lol. Didn't expect it to be my goodbye letter when I started it, but I guess that's what it is. and to the few really cool guys I've met along the way, thank you for being so patient. You know who you are, you guys always had a laugh at my rips :p and being together and joking about it made it bearable when it happened, honestly. thanks for everything :)"

I dont think endgame of Diablo II is making an enigma,that is just a tool to help you find the more exotic stuff more efficiently. Many people who PVP here share this opinion.

slashdiablo,3di31t,Nixons_BACK,2,Thu Jul 16 13:23:39 2015 UTC,Whats an AT run?
slashdiablo,3di31t,dub_troll,5,Thu Jul 16 13:24:44 2015 UTC,"Ancient Tunnels, a level in Act 2 (in Lost City I believe) where the monsters are 85 and you can find almost any item in the game. You don't get as stead a supply of drops as you would farming Andariel or Mephisto or some such, but you have a chance at finding the rarest and most valuable items in the game."
slashdiablo,3di31t,Nixons_BACK,2,Thu Jul 16 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, awesome I never knew! Hey, do you also know what ""purple boxes are?"" I've seen some people talk about orange and purple boxes..."
slashdiablo,3di31t,dub_troll,5,Thu Jul 16 13:30:02 2015 UTC,"I think that refers to a feature of BH, the maphack this community generally uses. It's designed so that certain items of value show up as boxes of specific colors depending on the item on your minimap so you don't have to waste time holding down Alt and viewing drops on the ground. It also helps you track drops in areas like cows where there may be so many drops on screen you literally wouldn't be able to see that Ber drop. So the whole 'come on purple box' thing is hoping for the specific item that has a purple color assigned to it. But I could be totally wrong!"
slashdiablo,3di31t,Nixons_BACK,2,Thu Jul 16 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"High runes (I believe Vex and above) appear as a ""purple box"" on the maphack mini map when they drop, so as to alert you to it dropping. Likewise there are white, yellow, gold and red boxes (pul, um, etc)"
slashdiablo,3di31t,MKSJ,2,Thu Jul 16 13:34:56 2015 UTC,"Purple boxes refer to runes above Vex. Orange boxes refer to TC87 uniques (Death's Web, Death's Fathom, Death's Cleaver, Tyrael's Might, etc etc). These are shown using certain BH configs.

With that said, I would like to add that I have nothing but wonderful experience in Slash. I joined Raidcall and then started doing trist runs, within an hour someone joined and helped me with a rush. Another hour people were donating some great low level gear to get me started. I've joined baal runs and have had wonderful experience with the subreddit and community as a whole.  I'm an old timer and I try not to pay too much attention to the other things going on and just focus on what's important to me, and thats having fun.   TL;DR - Don't be so trusting. Good luck.

slashdiablo,3ddlrn,sVr90,5,Wed Jul 15 13:09:39 2015 UTC,"Let me go ahead and start.  Thank you to seeemmkay for carrying me through Ubers already four times solo. I died several times with my sorc, doing the little I could. Everytime he was very patient, especially at my first uber run, where I had no exact idea what to do. Every time he could have snacked the torch, id and swap or whatever - but he didn't. He left it unid on the ground waiting for my lazy ass to pick it up.  Thank you TheDutch for giving me a proper introduction to D2. Where to farm? What is arealvl? Which items are okay? How to evaluate prices? The whole basic stuff. Just thank you!   Thank you Mauritius for rushing my Pdin yesterday from normal level 20 to hell level 66 with chaos runs. I never got to say ty since the group disbanded abruptly. Thank you mate, really appreciate the bump.   Thank you galaxy123 for answering every question (no matter how stupid) and always helping out. Literally. Everytime someone needs help and I intend to join their game. You were already there several times.  Thank you GreenCarrot for some good advice a week ago regarding setup for AT farm (BO barb stuff). It really helped out a s***load in terms of survivability.  Thank you slayergod13 and underbent for your further work on BH Maphack. Maintaining and especially improving a piece of software that everyone takes for granted is such an unthankful job. I love BH and can't think of playing without it. It became a part of D2 for me at this point.  Thanks guys!"

Try and get spirit (tal thul ort amn) any 4 socketed sword, or shield, although you need 156 strenght for the shield so maybe you shouldn't aim for the beginning.   for you helper i would say that you should get an act 2 hireling, they can use polearms where you can make insight, (ral tir tal sol) that gives you great mana regeneration  Anything else or missing some runes for runewords just /w *hurtai ingame"

slashdiablo,3dezcx,dub_troll,2,Wed Jul 15 19:20:03 2015 UTC,One eth item that a character actually wears that deserves a zod is eth griffons.  There aren't many other items that call for it.  Eth weapons for characters are usually for BoTD or Exile rune words which have the inherent quality of being indestructible or dura repair.   There are eth throwing uniques that have replenish quantity also eth throwing rares that are good too.  Some eth rares with dura repair can also be good.  Like yellow zon gloves or tri rez boots.  Honestly id rather have a more useful stat than the extra def that comes with ethereal and repairs dura but it definitely has style points for sure
slashdiablo,3dezcx,lmille27,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:30:18 2015 UTC,People want ETH gear for the added armor to put a zod into or items that self repair or items for their merc.
slashdiablo,3dezcx,dmanb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"Also weapons that you'll never be swinging and thus never lose durability earn style points.   Eth occy, eth flail hoto, eth dweb, eth fathom, eth stormlash (on a kicksin) will all last forever."
slashdiablo,3dezcx,Syradil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"People will definitely put zod into eth items. For example, if a 30s high ED eth tomb reaver spawns on this server you can bet your ass I'll be bidding multiple ohm for it."
slashdiablo,3dezcx,EARTHWAKED,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:46:24 2015 UTC,Not sure if you knew this but items don't lose durability when a merc uses them. If you knew that then the other answers are more helpful.
slashdiablo,3dezcx,Manual8719,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:49:12 2015 UTC,also when using a blade fury sin the weapon doesnt lose durability even though the blade fury damage is based off weapon damage..   ive been looking for a good eth chaos base claw base just for that reason.. dont think i'll ever find one though Lol

I think that you can still play slash after the update but there is no maphack for 1.13d, so if you want to come back to slash then you need to downgrade your game file. Link to that in the side bar i believe."

This is all speculation though, but there's been a number of threads from other people also raising also their concern.  Pretty sure multiple griffs, fathoms, and Death webs were being epeened within the first 48 hours. And considering there's an even less active player base than the 2014 December one, it's a little odd."

slashdiablo,3d7mqe,MeowTheMixer,5,Tue Jul 14 08:07:26 2015 UTC,"If your crafting character is 93 and doing the amulet gambling I believe there's a 100% chance to get a useable amulet for crafting.  gambling: ilvl = clvl (-5 to +4) so at worst ilvl = 93-5=88  Crafted amulets are 0.5x input ammy ilvl (88, worst gamble) + 0.5x clvl (93/2 = 46 when rounded down) so worst ammy gives 44 + 46 = 90 and therefore all affixes should be possible."

slashdiablo,3d7mqe,bigtfatty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:16:05 2015 UTC,You can be a lower level and still craft the best amulets.  If you are level 88 you will gamble an ilvl 92 amulet 1/9th of the time which you could use to craft a alvl 90 amulet (44 + 46 again).  If you kill baal until he drops a blue amulet you could use that to craft an alvl 90 amulet on a character as low as 82!

My one friend stumbled upon this subReddit and told me the ladder just reset so give it a shot.  So far, it's fun but without a huge community, it'll feel like playing single player which sucks.  It's been fun today leveling up and what not and it reminds me how shitty fun the game is starting.  I do miss sharing an account full of Sigons and other leveling crap with my friends though.  Leveling the first time without full Sigons sucks major ass.  Someone gave me a tarn helm and a couple cath rings so that helped me massively at 11+."

slashdiablo,3d5385,Nixons_BACK,6,Mon Jul 13 16:20:34 2015 UTC,"There is no exact number. If you're going for just runes or a combination of runes+items then the ideal MF is as much as possible without effecting your clear speed. Cold Sorcs do massive amounts of damage due to Cold Mastery which means you have alot more room for MF in your build if you're doing Solo AT/Trav/Etc Runs.  Since Lightning Sorcs don't have a source of -RES like Cold Sorcs, they rely on getting their -LightRes from Facets/Infinity/Griffs/CrescentMoon. This is why you'll see high offers for Light Facets (Cowzons also factor in the price of facets).  The benefit of having a Light Sorc over a Cold Sorc is that Infinity can break most of the light immunes in the game allowing them to clear all of the game content fairly fast."
slashdiablo,3d5385,LivEisJeebus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"Since Lightning Sorcs don't have a source of -RES like Cold Sorcs, they rely on getting their -LightRes from Facets/Infinity/Griffs/CrescentMoon   Ooooh that makes sense! So lightning has the most flat damage in the game, it's just -res that the build is lacking and that gets fixed by infinity/griff's/facets. Gotcha."
slashdiablo,3d5385,mdbarney,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:53:39 2015 UTC,When does crescent moon actually get used?  I've been running 200fcr lightning this ladder and haven't even made one to use on switch.  The only mobs that don't die fast enough for my taste are the barely breakable skeleton mages in AT.
slashdiablo,3d5385,mdbarney,3,Mon Jul 13 18:26:30 2015 UTC,"It's used mainly on 117 FCR lightning sorcs. Light immunes broken with infinity will still have 88+ lightning res. In 1p games, you can typically kill monsters with 1-2 high roll lightning casts, but in 8p games it helps tremendously to have the -35 light res from cmoon (and the -20 from griffs). The differences in damage to broken light immunes (assuming 100 res) can be seen below:    Gear Enemy Light res % Damage    Infinity 88% 12%   Infinity + CMoon 53 47%   Infinity + CMoon + -20% griffs 33 67%    TL;DR it makes a huge difference in higher player games"

Even with grifs and facets it seems like a big deal to go from 40% damage > 75%.  Essentially double damage > a few skills and a fcr breakpoint I have to imagine.

Reasons a lot of people are going light, is because light sorcs are able to clear most areas via the conviction on infinity. With the conviction on infinity it breaks most light immunes in hell, so they can mf most ilvl 85 areas."

slashdiablo,3d5385,pitterpatterEU,2,Mon Jul 13 20:17:58 2015 UTC,"For Blizzard, and only Blizzard, because there are some weird caveats with Meteorb and Lightning:  As much MF as you can get without significantly sacrificing killing speed or survival. Let's say 100% MF to 300% MF is doubling your base twice (not really, there's diminishing returns, but run with me anyway). So, your odds to find something are now 4x. It's way easier from there to double your killing speed than it is to add 400% MF (to 700) to double the odds that way. That's apart from the actual diminishing returns built into the stat.  Don't significantly sacrifice safety for MF. It's okay to sacrifice some safety for killing speed, provided you turn that speed into safety. If you're doing 3 minute runs, and a death adds 30 seconds for you to recover the body, run back, or exit and start a new run, that's ~16.7% of a run you lose every time you die. Or, after every 6 deaths, you lose a run. That's ignoring any time you might lose due to playing overly-safe because you're afraid of dying.  Skillers are sort-of still important even if Blizzard is instantly popping things, because Blizzard has an internal CD while Glacial Spike does not. Glacial Spike is Cold's version of Fire Ball, and will probably 2-4 shot everything if you have synergies maxed. I keep Spike on left-click and tele/Blizz between mobs, using Spike to drop mobs between Blizzard CDs. It's also handy if there's something like a Vigor or Fanaticism pack. That said, the margin you gain from skillers is way smaller than as Lightning, so it's not that important if you're already running torch + anni. They get way more useful again in p8 chaos/baal, where the difference between a lvl 34 Blizzard and a lvl 38 Blizzard is ~1.0-1.1k damage before Cold Mastery. Fair warning, aggressively tele-Spiking mobs between Blizz CDs is rough on the hands.  TL;DR: FCR to 105. MF unless it costs you survivability or killing speed. Skills afterward when MF is convenient or you can add speed."
slashdiablo,3d5385,pitterpatterEU,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:10:43 2015 UTC,"Great post, thanks for your input. I noticed that Ice Blast (the second cold spell you get) has a way higher damage than Glacial Spike. Can you fill me in on why you prefer the latter?"
slashdiablo,3d5385,BoredOnAFarm,2,Mon Jul 13 20:13:43 2015 UTC,Spike is AoE and will pop lots of stuff at once. Blast I have to individually target things. Blast is better against lone targets or groups of two.  E: Blast is also better for popping Izual and making people wonder how you do damage.
slashdiablo,3d5385,Poops_McYolo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:15:28 2015 UTC,"It's really a matter of preference or even how much epeen you want to amass.  A fully geared light sorc can obliterate anything in 8p hell in milliseconds which is crazy fun and hence costs you a fortune. But you will never have more than like 200 mf or so.  A blizzard sorc is 'confined' to doing AT, Meph, Andy and a few other spots, but you can find all the same items while running a lot more mf, like you just said.With a good Infinity merc you can easily run Chaos with a blizzard sorc btw, but whatever.  Many people argue that kill speed > mf (myself included) and the sweet spot for mf being anywhere between 150-300 due to diminishing returns, so a lightning would win out in the end. This gets escalated by rune drops only being affected by kill speed as well.  So basically you ask yourself if you want to be a god or an underdog in the end."

Because Meph can't drop Tal Armor, but the armor rack in the same room can.  Either way, the mobs in Trav aren't high enough TC to drop a Griff's."

slashdiablo,3d3795,Skarless,2,Mon Jul 13 06:07:32 2015 UTC,yes they drop ilvl85 items but none of the trav monster nor the monsters in the area can drop a griffons eye.  http://diablo2.ingame.de/tips/calcs/dropcalc/dropcalc.php?lang=en&patch=113&mode=lod&interface=default&window=true
slashdiablo,3d3795,Nerxa419,2,Mon Jul 13 06:07:45 2015 UTC,It was definitely dropped from trav. I don't think it was from a high council member. I think it was a champion heirophant or champion ghoul lord. You guys have to trust me on this. But I have no way of absolutely proving it so believe whatever you want to. There's just no reason for me to lie. :p
slashdiablo,3d3795,NMS113,-2,Mon Jul 13 06:39:48 2015 UTC,We checked on a drop calc there are no ilvl85 monsters in trav that could drop it.
slashdiablo,3d3795,TroutPhishman,7,Mon Jul 13 06:50:54 2015 UTC,"Well, Trav has an area level of 82, and if it dropped from a pack boss they get +3 monster level which would make it drop from a level 85 monster hence the ilvl85. Its just like when a griff drops in the pits from a pack boss, pits has an area level of 85, so the monster gets +3 added on to there level which makes the item level 88.  Also here is a screenshot of a drop calc showing it could drop."

slashdiablo,3d0ie5,EstusFiend,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:19:39 2015 UTC,D3 is in a very good place right now. They've have done a ton of work with the patches.
slashdiablo,3d0ie5,sicklyfish,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:56:01 2015 UTC,"I hear you, but i'm just not interested in Diablo 3. I played all of it during it's early days and even tho the cinematics were top notch, the soundtrack was poor in comparison to Mat Uelman's masterpiece, and the atmosphere of the game and the graphical textures just didn't convey the same gritty, creepy feel that it's predecessors had.  If the recent patch could bring back that atmosphere somehow, i would be so impressed that i'd be speechless. Probably i'll never find out."

slashdiablo,3d2ljg,ryland05,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:57:57 2015 UTC,I believe this to be a false trade to drum up the perceived worth of rals.

slashdiablo,3d26vk,MKSJ,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:07:47 2015 UTC,well ber = 5-5.5 ohms. I'd value soj at ohm gul'ish. so you'd need to make up a fair bit
slashdiablo,3d26vk,MKSJ,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:11:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't make the leap currently. I will however sell SoJ @ Ohm Gul."
slashdiablo,3d26vk,lmille27,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:22:55 2015 UTC,luma. get 6 ohms. not 5.5 for your ber =)
