I'm keeping everything clean and using the thinnest coats of A&D I can, but I noticed yesterday that this happened on the first part of work.  This specific flower went under a lot of needlework, since the artist was trying to decide how to color in the flowers.  Now it has these weird, slightly green colored scab-like things on them. They sort of leak some cloudy green tinged stuff after a while of having A&D on it - I noticed the other day when I rinsed and sort of dabbed it off that they didn't start leaking again when I didn't apply A&D again.  I have no idea what to do about this -- Go see my artist and get his opinion, go straight to a doctor, or sit and see what happens to it over the healing process?"
tattoo,3dqpi4,LizzardFish,3,Sat Jul 18 15:13:52 2015 UTC,Try aquaphor or plain lotion instead. I have been told never to use A&D ointment on fresh tattoos. I think some people have weird reactions to it.

tattoo,3ddjll,boonbabysoup,5,Wed Jul 15 12:48:01 2015 UTC,As an outsider to arrow tattoos I would assume it means three or multiple paths or fates intertwined. But nfi tbh.  The better question is what does it mean to you?
tattoo,3ddjll,Vo0Do0972,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:11:36 2015 UTC,I couldn't find anything for three arrows just that crossed ones means friendship.
tattoo,3ddjll,RedRing14,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:24:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you, it has a special meaning for me. I just wanted to assure myself it hasn't some alternate unwanted meanings. Btw i found it long time ago by google search, cant remember the source. Did you already see something like this?"
tattoo,3ddjll,Cmass90,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:03:58 2015 UTC,Three interlocking arrows like that probably refers to Japanese folklore about Mori Motonari. He gave each of his three sons an arrow and told them to break it.  After they did he gave them each three arrows and none of the kids were able to break them. He did this as a demonstration that they are stronger together than they are individually.

tattoo,3d9zel,system_failure,2,Tue Jul 14 17:45:30 2015 UTC,It's called onion skin and it's completely normal. It can last 1-4 weeks. Then your skin will settle down and it will start to fade a little. Enjoy the bright colors for now.
tattoo,3dbxc8,Dee4Ness,2,Wed Jul 15 01:59:17 2015 UTC,"Sleeves look fine no matter what size your arms are, really is dependent on the design. If the design is crooked or contorted because of how small your arms or because it has been altered last minute to fit your arms that is an isssue. But if you have a design that is ""to your measurements"", if you are talking one big piece it will look fine regardless of the size of your arms providing you have it designed properly.  This is one of my favourite examples to give when people feel that sleeves only look okay on bigger arms but that is because I really like the design. Maybe this design isn't for you and you won't like it but if you look on google you will find plenty more examples.   Sorry for bad grammar is 5am."

I'm more prone to gaining weight around my stomach, so I don't think I'd ever get work done there.

tattoo,3d6t9g,mrredguy11,23,Mon Jul 13 23:45:00 2015 UTC,"Here's some advice: don't get a tattoo at 16. Its a big commitment and, although that tattoo may look cool, I think 16 is too young to make that kind of decision. (Re reading this, it makes me sound like I'm like 40 y o but I'm not, I'm only 17 a year older than you) I'm a huge tattoo fan and at an age like both of ours they look great and exciting to have but I think its best to wait just to make sure its something you really want to have. How long have you wanted that particular tattoo? I think its best if, now that you have decided on a design, try not to think about it for a while, idk 6 months maybe, and if you still like it after that and still want to make the commitment then it may not be a deciding factor but it can at least show you that you do actually want that tattoo (if that makes any sense!)"
tattoo,3d6t9g,MillieJA,7,Mon Jul 13 23:59:52 2015 UTC,"To add to this, that's a highly visible location and could give you trouble getting a job.  I'm glad I didn't get a tattoo at that age, too. I'm 26 and have over 40 hours of tattoo work now and I look back at what choices I wanted to make back then and I cringe. You are still in a huge growing stage as a person.  If anything, consider getting it in a less-visible location."

Are you sure you'd like to get black circles on your skin that just vary in size? I wanted all kinds of tattoos at your age as well, but finally got my first when I was 20. It was a totally different tattoo and I'd never get the tattoo I wanted as a teenager. Even if you'd be 18 and wanted to get your first, I'd say you're too young.

I put it off in my head until I could legally get it, and then at 18 I decided to sit on it a bit more JUST in case. A few months after I turned 20 I went out and got the same idea I had when it was 16, but with different placement (chest rather than forearm), and I am absolutely in love with it. Dont forget you'll live to be around 70 most likely, maybe even more. At 16 you're just getting started in life so make sure you dont make any hasty decisions... and if you do at least your tattoo will remind you next time to not make any hasty decisions lol"

If you still want the same tattoo in the same place after a year, go for it.

I was 25 when I finally got mine.  If you decide to go through with it, the pain isn't that bad at all. Mine is on my upper left arm near my shoulder. The only parts that hurt was the lettering (thinner needle) and near the bone.  Also realize that you have chosen a location that is easily viewable. Some jobs won't like that, even though the tattoo doesn't seem offensive at all."

tattoo,3d6t9g,jedcaum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:37:21 2015 UTC,"...And that's why you shouldn't get a tattoo yet.  It IS a big deal, in some ways, whether it should be or not, and you lack the maturity to know whether you want to deal with that yet.  It's better than it used to be, but tattoos (and tattooed people) still carry a stigma.  Tattoos can cost you jobs.  They can hurt family relationships.  They can keep you from hooking up with certain types of people.  They are commented on, touched, referenced, talked about when you aren't around.  For many people, still, they define who you are.  Yep.  It's all true.  I know you will probably think you know better, and that I don't know what I'm talking about - that's part of being 16.  So just mark my words, and when you do it anyway, make sure to give me credit when I'm right.  Okay?"
tattoo,3d6t9g,lawcorrection,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:38:48 2015 UTC,Tattoos don't hurt all that bad. You should probably wait to get a tattoo. Your interests will change with time. You probably shouldn't get your first tattoo on your wrist like that. It will be very visible whether you want it to or not. I would start with a tattoo in a place you can cover easily at all times and then see if you like it. You have your whole life to get as many tattoos as you want.

tattoo,3d6t9g,rakatjino,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"For the most part yes, tattoos hurt. It varies from person to person and different places on your body, but yeah, getting stabbed repeatedly causes pain. You don't have to watch the needle so that may not bother you as much as you think.  ""I've decided on"" kinda bothers me. I don't regret any of my tattoos but the ones that I've had to ""pick out"" so to speak, are my least favorite. I mean if it really speaks to you go for it, when you're 18. I (41 y/o) wait at least a year, most times longer, after I get an idea for a tat. They are removable, but at even more pain and cost than the original.   Don't try to numb the pain. I've questioned my guy about it before and he said that always ends badly. You get all the pain at once. (Like if you use a lidocain patch) Idk if that's true as I have never tried. Personally, I consider the pain part of the process. You have to earn that tat. Feel the pain, live in the moment, let everything else fade away and come out the other side with your badge. You could also put on your headphones to help distract if you think that would be more up your alley. Ask for a break so you can regroup if need be, but that design shouldn't take that long.   I, too, would suggest a less visible place for your first. A lot of places still have ""image standards"" that don't include visible tattoos. Especially a lot of places that hire kids.   Most importantly research your artist and don't bargain hunt. In tattoos, you get what you pay for. Good luck."

A lot of people experience the instant tattoo regret, but once they let it sink in and fully appreciate it, they end up fully loving it. Give it time and see how you feel before you decide to go in for removal or anything like that. Its a very expensive process, and if you start it this early you may fall in love with your tattoo half way through the removal process! Best of luck and dont stress."

It's just now that I have figured it out, I don't want the tattoo. To the point where I would gladly pay thousands of dollars to get it off my body. Every time I look at it, all the horrible memories of his death come flooding back. It feels inescapable. I just can't have a permanent reminder of the grief. Sorry for the word vomit. I just can't bring myself to talk about this with anyone in my life, so I don't have anyone to talk to about it."

Is it possible you hate the tattoo because of how recent the loss is? Maybe one day in the future when youve had time to grieve for your friend, you will look down at the tattoo not as a reminder of the incident, but as a good memory of someone who means so much to you. Someone that will never be forgotten."
tattoo,3d1s4i,IDrewTheDuckBlue,2,Sun Jul 12 22:23:58 2015 UTC,"I totally see your point, but I also feel completely unable to process the grief at all with it on my body. It truly weighs very heavily on me. I really want it off. I want to deal with my grief normally and put it behind me and move on. It's a lovely design. It was done well. But it's just not at home on my skin, as much as it kills me to admit it."
tattoo,3d1s4i,IDrewTheDuckBlue,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:32:20 2015 UTC,"I wish you the best in whichever route you decide to take. Look more into removal if you really want it off, I dont know much about it other than that it takes multiple sessions with about a month of healing time inbetween each session...pretty much like getting a tattoo. It sucks, but it isn't the end of the world. Try not to dwell on it too much. I have one right now that I am getting covered up within a month. When i first got it I let it get me super depressed for a while and that doesnt help the situation at all."
tattoo,3d1s4i,Imactuallyinsane,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you. It means a lot being able to talk about this with people. How did you process the depression with that tattoo? I'm literally sick over this. I can't eat, I can't sleep. The sister of the friend who I got the tattoo for is visiting me this week trying to help me process this, but I feel such anguish. It feels like the months of grieving over his death have been crystallized into a single image that I have to wear around with me constantly. I don't know how to process it. How did you move past that mind set?"
tattoo,3d1s4i,Craftman2012,3,Sun Jul 12 22:51:31 2015 UTC,"Like I said a lot of people experience tattoo regret on a fresh tattoo. Im not sure the psychology behind it, but maybe it just doesnt feel right, since youre not use to seeing it. Its not you yet. Notice that i said ""yet"". As time goes on it becomes a part of your body that you are use to. I thought about removal as well when I first got it. Sent in a picture and got quoted at 800 dollar sessions and approximately 8 sessions. That wasnt going to work. But now that some time has gone by, I cant imagine not having it. It would feel like I'm removing a part of myself. I still hate a part of my tattoo, but thats more because of how it turned out than the fact that I have something on my skin. And I am going in to get it fixed. If someone had told me back when i was super depressed about it, that one day I would love having it, i would have called them crazy and told them to shut up and stop making things up. But here I am... its weird but time really does heal all things. I now look back at all that time i wasted being sad and antisocial and I cant believe I wasted time dwelling on it to that extent. Trust me you will get over this,  whatever you decide to do."
tattoo,3d1s4i,jepyang,3,Sun Jul 12 23:05:37 2015 UTC,"Spend the removal money on counselling IMMEDIATELY.    Sounds like you are focusing your energy on this in a obsessive compulsive manner.  You should invest the time and money in bettering yourself and you may then appreciate the tattoo more as it was a catalyst to seek help for your mental state.  As people have said.... Could be months for full removal and never actually fully gone.  Seeing scarred skin will no doubt have the same effect.    The effort, time and expense of counselling vs removal is likely the same.   Removal will leave a scar as a reminder but counselling may leave you relieved and happy with the choice you made.  Good luck, sorry for your loss.   Seriously though. Start with counselling first because it's the smarter choice.  Try not to left the OCD win (which is almost impossible of course).    Or, get it removed....    You asked, I read and was inclined to try and help."
tattoo,3d1s4i,danny_fiasco,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:05:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, I 100% intend to get counseling. I just don't view it as an either-or. It's not so much that the anxiety/depression is caused by the tattoo so much as it's what caused me to get it in the first place. The decision came from grief and it's something I'm very unhappy with and reminds me of a lot of anguish I'm dealing with.  Removal itself shouldn't be impossible because the piece itself doesn't have coloring. It's not like I'm embarrassed of it or anything. The work was good, and it can be easily covered. The choice to get it came from the wrong place is all, and I just want to get myself back to feeling whole, mentally and physically."
tattoo,3d1s4i,danny_fiasco,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:09:39 2015 UTC,Have you thought about getting a cover-up tattoo? That would be quicker and cheaper than removal.
tattoo,3d1s4i,danny_fiasco,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:38:42 2015 UTC,"I did consider it, but I don't want the tattoo and getting a cover up wouldn't fix the awful feelings of grief, regret, and shame I have. Mostly I just want to get rid of the tattoo (by any means necessary) and find a good therapist to deal with my grief/emotional baggage properly."
tattoo,3d1s4i,brokenwords,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:42:59 2015 UTC,"Do you think the faded, smudged scars that laser removal would leave would really be better than a coverup tattoo?  You should work on processing your grief before you worry about what to do with the tattoo. It's pretty normal to constantly be confronted by your negative feelings when someone close to you passes. The tattoo didn't cause that.  It sounds like you're focusing on these external things you feel you can control rather than addressing your feelings head on. Just like the tattoo didn't bring closure, removing it won't do it either."
tattoo,3d1s4i,p-m-v,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"Man it sounds like you need to give it time. If you took their death hard in the first place, and then got a tattoo for them, of course it's going to bring it up. I had dreams nearly every night for over a year about the person mine is for. I woke up with tears in my eyes more often than not. It just took a while to get used to the whole thing."
tattoo,3d1s4i,deathsmaash,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:22:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for this perspective. It's comforting to know other people have felt this. I'm definitely going to give myself a month regardless, if only because I would never jump immediately into a removal procedure without giving my skin the time to heal. Regardless of the depression and regret surrounding everything, I've been taking care of the tattoo and my skin diligently, and I definitely wouldnt start taking a laser to my skin until it's healed.     I just think if anything the experience has forced me to realize I need to take care of myself better. I haven't been processing the grief or depression over the loss. I tried to force feeling acceptance with it through getting a tattoo. But it's just been a constant reminder of the trauma. I'm not rushing away to do anything before my skin is healed, and I will continue to think on it. I just think for me, it wasn't the right choice for how to respond to what's been happening in my life since his accident.     I know a lot of people on this sub probably don't/won't agree with how I view the situation. Which is totally understandable because it's a tattoo sub, and I was looking to get a range of opinions. But I think for me it just wasn't the right choice, and I need to work to getting to a place I'm at peace with myself and my body, even if that does mean looking into removal while pursuing therapy"
tattoo,3d1s4i,Fatdee7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:19:14 2015 UTC,To hell with what they think about how you feel about your tats.   It really does help if you give it time. I never got a day without thinking about my lost loved ones at least once. It's all in how you handle it.

Molecules of ink get trapped in a lower layer of your skin - an immune reaction keeps them in place, and anything that happens to the surface layers won't have any effect.  You will, though, not want to be rubbing it with a bra strap as it's healing. Think of it like you would any surface wound. That irritation and lack of air is going to increase healing time and the chance of infection. Keep it under a t-shirt only for, I dunno, a week? After that you should be good to bra up again."

But, I would recommend to wear high socks to cover the tattoo after you apply your healing product.  DO NOT touch it at work or expose it at all at the job.  Just take a pic and show your coworkers if you feel the need.  If it feels dry during your shift, try to run home to apply more product or if the bathroom is clean use that.  Just make sure your hands are always clean before touching and try not to scratch it."

tattoo,3czmcl,zakart,2,Mon Jul 13 10:59:53 2015 UTC,I always recommend using tegaderm burn covers. It's like a plastic sticker that allows the skin to breath but keeps it from the elements  You normally want to out it on at the shop as you want to lock in the plazma that is being pushed out to help healing.   I use to take 2-4 weeks to heal. When I cover a tat with tegaderm I don't scab. Take it off between 4-7 days and I'm fully healed within a week.   http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3MC3SD/Wound-Care/Brands/Tegaderm/?MDR=true  http://www.atombombtattoo.com/aftercare.php

Paying dues is something completely different. Performing the art of tattoo is something completely separate from designing one, I'm just weighing in on the opinion that there are cases where this design system would be more than acceptable, and achieving the same idea/design with less time spent is something that many people would find beneficial.

tattoo,3cvvjo,diggtrucks1025,4,Sat Jul 11 20:50:16 2015 UTC,What's it matter for geometric style tattoo's that are just gonna get stenciled and traced over when they're being done anyway? It's not like they're doing whole pieces or sleeves like this.

Your artist will be able to tell you what would work and what wouldnt. I've seen tattoo artists run shitty flowers into a Roman Gladiator.   Go to one of your better shops locally or travel if you have to. The best artists will make your coverup not look like a coverup. Trust me, there are some coverups i see out there that makes me think what was there before was probably better.   But if i had to guess i'd say you'll be able to get anything with a roundish type shape. The cover idea that pops into my head when i think ""ugly eye tattoo"" is like a scary black crow. Maybe use the eye as its shadowy head or maybe use the eye  s shape as a branch the bird is hanging onto. But your artist will be much more helpful."

tattoo,3ctzhd,Sammmdr56,2,Fri Jul 10 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"Tattoo artist here. I'm full of judgements about what makes a good tattoo and what doesn't. But at the end of the day I think the best advice is to get exactly what you want. It's on you forever! I have lots of goat tattoos. Why? Because goats rock! Skulls and flowers are a classic staple in most western tattooing styles used today. It's not unusual for people to have multiple tattoos including those subjects.  on another line of thought, I personally am a huge fan of both dot work and neotraditional styles. There is quite a lot of overlap between the two and a lot of artists do both. So if the thought of having two similar tattoos still bothers you after you've thought about it a little more, I don't think you'd have a hard time finding a great artist who would be willing to combine both styles into one tattoo."

tattoo,3ctzhd,mua2tang1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:49:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe if you placed them symmetrically on your body it would look okay. For example, one on the left and one on the right side of your chest. Maybe put the colored one on whichever side that the brain controls artistic stuff, and the lines and dot work on the more mathematical side (I think it's the left. Sorry, I know very little about how the brain works).   I think it might look strange if you had them on parts of your body where it's obvious that they are not meant to be together, such as one on your calf and one on your chest. I'd probably do a double take if I saw that."

He was really into it and was excited to do something that he had never done (he mainly does realistic and not many comic tattoos) But my advice would be look around your area and just go in ad talk to the artist. I imagine that if they didn't dig it, they would say so. Hopefully this in someway helped. It took me a long time to find exactly what I wanted and I knew I wanted it ""copy and paste"" on my arm."

Brainstorm ideas they have and if you like their style you will like their work! That will also create many more tattoos in the future, don't get to caught up on meaning for a first tattoo, I didn't and I'm very glad I didn't because I would not have gotten the pieces I have today because I would have been to worried to get them because they don't ""mean"" anything. Good luck OP!!!"

Get a general idea of what you want and then ask some artist in your area to draw something up...when you see something you like, you'll know and want it right away."

Things I think about when considering a tattoo: -placement. Is it going to be placed in an area that will change with time or pregnancy or what have you ? -Is there a meaning to this piece? If so, what? If not, then why? -content -visibility. How will this affect possible future jobs?  Things to consider with picking an artist: -look through their portfolio  What does it look like they specialize in? Think about what you need in an artist based on what you want to get. Do they work well with white? Do they do stippling well? How straight are their lines?  A big one for any artist. HOW CRISP/CLEAN ARE THEIR LINES?  Last but not least. Meet your finalist(s) and figure out if you click. They will be in your personal space and you will be stuck interacting with them for x hours depending on how big your piece is.  Also check to make sure the shop and your artist are clean, and don't be shy. Ask questions if you are uncomfortable. Even ask to see the needles taken out or ask to see them set up to make sure things are new and/or sanitary. They should do this in front of you anyways though. My artist does all his prepping in front of me.  Good luck! I hope this helps!"
tattoo,3cpdhk,morelamplz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:29:55 2015 UTC,"First one was my hardest...although i'm only on my second now.  With that being said, my first one was an entire sleeve - but it took me 2 years to figure out what i wanted.  I'm also in a very conservative business environment and was worried about it being career suicide (long sleeves for life now).    I started freaking out (in my head only) the instant the needle touched my arm the first time.  I had a very real ""oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, what the hell am I doing, oh shit, i just screwed up, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit"" moment.  Was screaming that in my head for the first couple of minutes - to the point where I almost felt like I was going to yak.....all while keeping a very calm demeanor on the outside.  After the first couple of minutes, I suddenly got a ""screw it"" attitude...damage is done now, and started to enjoy the process.  15-17 hours of chair time, and 11 months later, my first tattoo was finally complete.  A week later (last month), i started my second tattoo...another full sleeve.  4 hours of chair time so far, and another appointment next week.    Talking to a friend about her getting her first tattoo last night...if its anything like me, you'll freak out at first, then just try to accept it as fast as you can and try to enjoy it.  Odds are, you will.  I personally get very excited over upcoming appointments.  I can't freaking wait until next Thursday for my appointment.  Have been giddy ever since my artist said he could squeeze me in.  Never thought I'd enjoy paying for pain as much as I do."

tattoo,3cp004,sassy1024,7,Thu Jul 9 16:48:20 2015 UTC,"He is probably upping the price because the ribs are one of the most painful spots on the body, and he is therefore predicting that the number of rests you will need will be more, and therefore that he will have to spend more time tattooing you in total, and therefore that he should be paid more.   If you went to an artist that charged by the hour, the result would likely be the same, assuming you do indeed need more breaks. That being said, another non-by-the-hour artist might not perform this calculation, so you could always shop around if price means a lot to you.   If you like this artist, then pay the extra he is asking. This thing will be on you forever. That extra 100 bucks won't mean much to you in a couple of months."

I think that it's likely easier to think that this is okay over seas when your not living on stolen land yourself and get a consistent reminder of it when you pass by the poverty and crime stricken reservations.   We don't know the person that got this tattoo. We don't know if they have native blood or family or spiritual connection. ( though again the use of ""Indians"" implies not.) My argument is simply that the reaction of distaste due to cultural absurdities is warranted. If OP decides to argue for it then so be it they have that option, and hopefully open discussion will take place.   If my artist was black would it be okay to get a ""Jazz Bo"" (black face art) tattoo because I thought they were cute?  Does being white and non - native not give you the right to stand up for another culture that has been through extreme deprivation? Does being part of the ""privileged"" population of the world mean that the only acceptable manner is to keep lips sealed?? I think not!   Should we not stand for the rights of all people of color, all genders, all sexual orientations, because our skin or culture does not reflect the same?   Should American Christian soldiers not have fought for the lives of German Jews?   All lives and cultures matter and all who have good will to fight for them have the right to do so."

Nice assumption, though.   Should American Christian soldiers not have fought for the lives of German Jews?   Lol. Because the Holocaust was restricted to only German Jews, right? And only American Christians fought for America? Wow.  When are you going to give your land back to absolve yourself of this tremendous guilt you have?"
tattoo,3cj771,akolada,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:17:42 2015 UTC,Awesome - great art -   I doubt you care but you're now tattoo'd with a massively offensive piece of art.  Great job?   You might as well just have asked them to tattoo you with a 1920 blackface caricature because that's the equivalent.  That head dress which has become the generic goto would have belonged to one of the plains tribes.

tattoo,3cikgp,jenzthename,10,Wed Jul 8 04:42:24 2015 UTC,"Sounds totally normal to me. Any place with little to no muscle (elbow, ankle, knees, head etc) are always real painful for a while afterwards. Get that shit out of the plastic wrap though! I've never had an artist tell me to keep the wrap on for more than an hour or so. Shits gotta breath!"
tattoo,3cikgp,PaekCentaur,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:26:48 2015 UTC,"My artist told me to keep it under plastic wrap 24/7 until it starts to peel. I haven't been doing that, but thats what he told me."

tattoo,3cikgp,markidle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:57:05 2015 UTC,Is there anything I can do to lessen the pain?
tattoo,3cikgp,markidle,4,Wed Jul 8 05:03:06 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it will be worse tomorrow, then it will get better. Swelling is normal with heavy tattooing around the ankle. Try to stay off of it and keep it elevated. At least you never have to do it again. On that ankle."
tattoo,3cikgp,yetanotherpenguin,3,Wed Jul 8 05:14:55 2015 UTC,Paracetamol and/or ibubrofen will help will the pain. Give it 72 hours and it should be all gone.

tattoo,3cikgp,Bustatruggalo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:43:32 2015 UTC,"Remove the bandage once the tattoo stops bleeding. For some people that's 30min others 3hours. Plastic wrap can cause toxic shock syndrome on rare occasions but is just fine for most people. Red is one of the main color that people have reactions to, did you have any red ink on your tattoo? Some people take longer to heal and some lose the red pigment all together. Are you on any acne medicine or prone to cellulitis? Those can also cause painful reactions."
tattoo,3cikgp,R3aper35,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:02:28 2015 UTC,"I know how you are feeling, I got a tattoo on my right calf a few years. I know that this might sound odd but you can try hemroid cream for the swelling and ice pack for the burning sensation. I used the cream and it did help with the swelling, advil or an anti inflammatory."
tattoo,3cikgp,Tempereus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:02:56 2015 UTC,"That's pretty normal right after the tattoo session. The pain can be lasting up to about 48 hours. But you have to watch it pretty close. If it doesn't get better you might have an infection. Be careful! And yes, the plastic wrap should be removed within 2 to 3 hours after the tattoo session is over (hopefully you did that already)! How do I know? I'm part of the editorial team at InkDoneRight and we published recently a guide on how to care for your tattoo. Again; if your tattoo is still hurting after about 2 days and if its still swollen and might even get red, seek for professional medical advice (a doc - no tattoo artist)!"

tattoo,3chims,cassiethesassy,3,Wed Jul 8 00:15:57 2015 UTC,"Don't use Aquaphor if you can avoid it, or if you really can't stand the tightness, don't use it for more than 2 days. I have extremely sensitive skin and wash with a white Dove bar, I've never had problems. Use unscented lotion 2-3 times a day, lubriderm is best. Don't soak your tattoo or expose it to too much sun. You'll be fully healed in about 2-3 weeks. Peeling after a few days is normal,  DO NOT PICK! the nasty skin flakes will come off on their own."
tattoo,3chims,ihateureddit,2,Wed Jul 8 01:05:40 2015 UTC,I used Aquaphor and I had no peeling. My tattoo healed in 3-5 days. I've recommended it to others and they had the same result.
tattoo,3chims,hawaiianthunder,2,Wed Jul 8 00:45:51 2015 UTC,"I have a half-sleeve in progress. For just the outline, I was told fragrance-free hand lotion only, for shading it's been Aquaphor the first 2 days and fragrance-free lotion until it's healed. Also, I know picking off the flaky parts is going to be suuuuuuuuuper tempting, but don't do it. If it itches, slap it don't scratch it! Other than that, don't worry about it too much. If you've gone to a good artist who did good work, it will be able to heal on its own just fine. :)"

tattoo,3cip8t,dearsergio612,2,Wed Jul 8 05:33:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as an artist myself I'd advise against it. I'd be a bit offended if someone didn't take proper care of their tattoo which included the general aftercare and working out. I tattooed a girl once on the same placement you're speaking of and when it was in the scabbing process(tattoos get pretty 'tight' feeling during that time, as I'm sure you're aware) she said she had simply reached out to grab something from a shelf and it caused a small rip in the tattoo. Maybe she wasn't moisturized enough on the tattoo at the time but either way, caused a teeeeeeenny tiny mark on her tattoo which was a simple 5 second touchup but still."

tattoo,3cip8t,system_failure,2,Wed Jul 8 07:52:28 2015 UTC,"I've told people before that if you're intending on going to the gym (cause hey I can't tell people what to do if they're not gonna listen to me anyway) to at least work on an opposite part of your body....So do leg workouts over lifting, for instance. If you manage to tear it or irritate your tattoo by lifting, you'll likely need touchups and then you'll have to repeat the process anyway. It's just better to do it right the first time around - plus your artist would appreciate it im sure."

tattoo,3cigol,CanYouFeelMyHeart95,11,Wed Jul 8 04:04:56 2015 UTC,"Look up tattoos on google. I never understand why people ask these questions because A. We don't know your taste and B. There are so many different styles of tattoos. Just google ""rose tattoos"" ""geometry tattoos"" or ""letter tattoos"" etc... I'm not trying to be a dick by any means but you can't expect for us to give you any solid ideas if you haven't even given us a sliver of what you are interested in having on your body. My best advice is to do some research on styles, local artist's portfolios, the level of skill the said artist have, size vs. cost otherwise you may end up with a mediocre tattoo or at worst a tattoo you hate completely. This is especially important for pieces on big areas like your thigh. You can always cover up small tattoos with relative ease but big tattoos are harder and some may not be able to be covered at all. Also you need to try to have a consultation with an artist before you just show up to get tattooed. This isn't really necessary if you have been getting tattoos for awhile and are familiar with the artist, but I would definitely advise it for your first one. Furthermore, do not be afraid to tell the artist what you want exactly and once the artist has drawn it up don't hesitate to let them know what you may not like about it. There are certain things artist won't be able to do because it may not end up looking good or fitting well with the piece but not discussing these things can lead to a tattoo you don't really like,.  Tattoos are permanent after all so just make sure it is what you absolutely want after the artist has drawn up a sketch. Good luck."
