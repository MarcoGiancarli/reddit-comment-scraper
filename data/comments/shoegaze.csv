shoegaze,3cojpk,youtubefactsbot,3,Fri Jul 10 02:38:15 2015 UTC,I know that people here really like the Israeli band Vaadat Charigim. Not sure about individual songs but yeah check those guys out for shoegaze with that Yiddish throat hocking.
shoegaze,3cojpk,TurboShorts,3,Thu Jul 9 15:34:12 2015 UTC,I love Navarre from italian group Stella Diana
shoegaze,3cojpk,Rainal,3,Thu Jul 9 18:16:53 2015 UTC,like not from England or songs with lyrics that aren't in English?
shoegaze,3cojpk,shitting_frisbees,2,Thu Jul 9 19:45:17 2015 UTC,Lyrics not in English.
shoegaze,3cojpk,topopunct,3,Fri Jul 10 00:06:00 2015 UTC,Kinoko Teikoku - Flower Girl
shoegaze,3cojpk,alcianblue,3,Thu Jul 9 19:45:29 2015 UTC,Language or country?   Country wise the yanks obviously have good bands like Drop Nineteens and Bethany Curve.  Language wise? There was that yellow Loveless album of Japanese bands covering the whole of Loveless. The To Here Knows When cover is my personal favourite on it.

shoegaze,3clkf8,wexfun,3,Wed Jul 8 21:16:23 2015 UTC,"Not really shoegaze-y, I guess, but they just released this today. Thought some people might be interested."
shoegaze,3clkf8,justinnnn,3,Wed Jul 8 21:17:48 2015 UTC,"thanks for acknowledging that - however, i do appreciate you posting it anyway because i love this band"
shoegaze,3clkf8,durdyg,2,Thu Jul 9 13:55:51 2015 UTC,"From an intermediate fan, I'm not really impressed with this particular track. I will say their last album Glow and Behold is really good. It's not so shoegazy either."
shoegaze,3ckt7x,jones_maltsberger,2,Wed Jul 8 18:10:16 2015 UTC,Loving the new album.
shoegaze,3ckt7x,thirtynation,2,Thu Jul 9 05:13:03 2015 UTC,I thought it was ok. It's just kind of pleasant where her last album was a bit more engaging and less background music.  new Valet is basically the same thing but better.
shoegaze,3chko2,StrictlyStupid,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:33:33 2015 UTC,"Run For Cover is killing it this year. First the Elvis Depressedly record, the new Citizen album, and now this? They're really on top of the game right now."
shoegaze,3chko2,brndnkchrk,2,Wed Jul 8 07:56:16 2015 UTC,"Adventures and Turnover too.  Citizen was....well, pretty boring imo."
shoegaze,3chko2,LIBERTYxPRIME,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:04:06 2015 UTC,"That's how I felt about the Turnover record at first. The singles were catchy but the album as a whole was very subdued and kinda sleepy. It took me a long time to really ""get it."""
shoegaze,3cewga,jesusandhisbeard,5,Tue Jul 7 11:11:54 2015 UTC,I honestly hated this movie. It looks like it was put together in iMovie and there's an overall amateurish vibe to it. The interviews were great though.
shoegaze,3cewga,ali_baba56,2,Tue Jul 7 17:28:18 2015 UTC,completely agree.. the interviews are the best thing about this movie.. i kind of wished they focused more on image and what kind of people that shoegaze brings together
shoegaze,3cewga,CassieCage,3,Tue Jul 7 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks OP, I've been wanting to see this for a while. I hope it's as good as the Pitchfork Slowdive documentary."
shoegaze,3cewga,KimmoTargaryen,3,Tue Jul 7 18:04:49 2015 UTC,That's going to be really hard to top. The replayability on the Souvlaki doc is extremely high...
shoegaze,3cewga,durdyg,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:51:27 2015 UTC,No worries matey :)
shoegaze,3cewga,rilagin,2,Tue Jul 7 18:13:01 2015 UTC,"I want to see this, but I'm not signing up for some spam."
shoegaze,3cewga,durdyg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:13:12 2015 UTC,You don't have to sign up if you don't download it.
shoegaze,3cewga,feltsandwich,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:49:07 2015 UTC,ah mate you dont have to. I have ad blocker so that maybe why i can just play it without having to download anything :)
shoegaze,3cewga,swaminstar,2,Tue Jul 7 18:13:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, it finally loaded up. Quite good. I didn't mind the styling. Interviews were solid. Corgan and Robert Smith said a lot of really strong stuff.   side note: Wayne Coyne is a douche."
