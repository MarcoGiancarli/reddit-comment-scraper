They seem to have forgotten about fighting the Queen Bee though.   A note of Great Importance for /u/Ethoslab and /u/Zisteau: If your jungle butts up right next to the the Crimson, you will probably want to dig a three to five block wide hellavator separating the two biomes. In Hardmode, the jungle biome can be slowly overridden by the Crimson and Hallow biomes. This can make finding and fighting Plantera more difficult, at the very least. It can also make getting items in the Hardmode jungle more difficult."

mindcrack,3e0deg,nbtrainor,21,Tue Jul 21 00:35:06 2015 UTC,"Alrighty:   It takes a lot to get me drunk, and when people started getting me free drinks all night, I decided this was the one night I'd be able to get drunk for the whole week/weekend so why not. Probably had about 7 beers, 2 ciders, a long island iced tea, a few other cocktails and maybe 1 or 2 shots. I want to thank Kleetho's brother who I hung out with much of the night and he kept getting everyone's drinks. I still remember everything, wasn't that drunk. You can see me at the end of the night snapping some photos of Milbee and Dadbee in Pyro's vlog HERE. Not long after, I was chatting with Wes and Guude for a hot second before Wes jumped out and back in with the crazy news about the power about to go out. So I knew it was time to put on my game face and man up and help if possible due to the urgent timeline. Guude grabbed my cheeks and said ""pajam! I love ya, but yer drunk!"" Of course I was drunk... but I was still alert, aware, and functional. Although it's funny to hear about Sethbling getting drunk one night, because he was very wary about my intoxication and capabilities of helping as well, just like Guude :P But as Guude said, they had shit on lockdown and got it all out of the building surprisingly quickly and efficiently as a group so I wasn't even really needed anyway. They had to take it all back to their place via multiple ubers, so I wandered down the street to hail a cab. I ran into a few guys who I had had some drinks with that night. One of which was having trouble keeping his eyes open, walking, etc. So I took up the responsibility to get him home. I immediately hailed a cab and got him back to the Ibis hotel by the convention center before going back to my place. Once at home I finally threw up just to be safe. You know. I was fine, but knew I should throw up to avoid a hangover the next day :) 100% intentional just to be on the cautious side."

mindcrack,3e0deg,Hkmarkp,7,Tue Jul 21 04:03:14 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, how much you drink does determine how drunk you are in the sense that more drinks = more drunk. But different people react to alcohol because of many factors including weight, body fat, and how often they drink."
mindcrack,3e0deg,Eilstina,4,Tue Jul 21 04:06:22 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend gets drunk after about 1 bottle of wine (her parents do too, so I guess it has something to do with genetics :P). It takes me about 1.5 bottles of wine before I'm even feeling tipsy. 2-3 and I'm drunk. Same with beer. One six pack? Nothing much. 2-3 is when I finally get tipsy to drunk. So really unless I mix in  really hard drinks, it's practically impossible to get truly drunk, or at least nothing more than a slight buzz.  The only time I had a night I can't remember was a night of college partying where I probably had half a fifth of vodka mixed with some other beers/ciders/liquers throughout the night. That was a night my sister and friends feared for my health and well-being as I did end up passing out for about 30 minutes (after which I woke up and was fully alert and aware). There is a block of about 45 minutes or so I don't remember from that night which is just crazy. That night is when I learned my limit, as up to that point I could simply drink 5-10 shots as a prep before a night of drinking, and then drink steadily throughout the night without ever being hungover or messed up or ever even get sick."

mindcrack,3dzhke,taschneide,6,Mon Jul 20 21:35:44 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? When I played the map it was extremely useful as my secondary weapon.  Smite II, Sharp II, Fire Asp I does 0.5+1.25+1.5=3.25 hearts of damage to creepers and spiders and 0.5+1.25+2.5+1.5=5.75 hearts to undead.   That's comparable to an iron sword with smite. The cons are that you can't block, so you'd still want a sword as your primary weapon, however on the plus side it's infinite durability and would have lasted the whole map if they didn't lose it.  The looting III raises the chance of a rare drop (like iron ingots from zombies) from 2.5% to 5.5%. The knockback is also nice for crowd control if you're getting swarmed.  I thought it was a pretty damn good item for the early stages when the base gear is stone swords.  EDIT: Ballsed up a number. Corrected now thanks to /u/Zincamamia"
mindcrack,3dzhke,TheBruntForce,5,Tue Jul 21 00:04:43 2015 UTC,"Sharpness adds .625 hearts per level, not 1.25 I believe. The damage is .5 + .625 x2 = 1.75 hearts of damage to creepers and spiders, and .5 + .625 x2 + 1.25 x2 = 4.25 hearts of damage to undead. Fire aspect deals 1.5 hearts, but it's usually bad against zombies, since zombies will set you on fire if they get set on fire.  I put it away when the fire got on my nerves..."
mindcrack,3dzhke,Zincamania,2,Tue Jul 21 00:16:15 2015 UTC,"Right, 0.625/level; it's level 2, so 1.25 from the sharpness.   I then added the fire damage, and I see I did make a mistake on that, so the correct amount of total damage is:   undead: 5.75 (better than diamond) other: 3.25 (about equal to iron)   The fire aspect didn't backfire on me at all really because the knockback pushes them so far away."

Easier to record multiple episodes at once and only have to get together once a week to do it.

mindcrack,3e2ye7,WingmanOne,4,Tue Jul 21 15:53:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think there will be enough resources for around twenty people to get properly geared up. Plus, there are a lot of rare items that can give an advantage to players.  Ex. An early hook drop from a skeleton or piranha or a cloud in a bottle.  A magic mirror can also let players quickly escape battles and other dangerous situations. Also, In UHC, it's supposed to be difficult to regen your health. By just breaking pots, players can gather low level health potions which in the beginning, heal half of the base health. Also, if anyone wants the really fun gear, they would have to kill a boss, which sends out a server wide announcement that tells everyone that a boss has been summoned. In general, if there was a uhc fight in Terraria, there would have to be major changes to how it works. If they could pull it off, I would love to see it."
mindcrack,3e2ye7,9ballisthestrongest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"I would love to see it yes, but it really couldn't be done for the same reason that there isn't much Terraria PvP, or at least popular ones (aside from capture the gem). Terraria is a 2D game where you can easily see around you, meaning you can't really sneak up on a person. Another problem would be health regeneration, since even the only means are natural regenerations (which would be disabled for UHCs) and potions (which have a 61 second cooldown and are easily avaliable). Items for teleportation like wormhole potions and the magic mirror can create an unfair advantage as well. Progress would also be halted quite quickly since the Eye of Cthulhu needs to be beaten to progress much further in the game.  If one player beats the eye (or any other boss by some means) they would have access to much better gear (especially Skeletron). Overall, Terraria is not as geared towards PvP games like UHC as much as Minecraft is."

mindcrack,3dvl0h,orestesma,8,Mon Jul 20 07:41:05 2015 UTC,Isn't it 7 times faster or 8 times as fast? At least in Dutch there's a distinction between the 2.
mindcrack,3dvl0h,Espumma,6,Mon Jul 20 08:01:50 2015 UTC,"In English it's the same. You are multiplying it by 8, so its 8 times faster and 8 times as fast. (Although technically you are dividing the time, but shhhhh)"
mindcrack,3dvl0h,bookworm2692,6,Mon Jul 20 10:55:40 2015 UTC,"No what I mean is that there is a difference between the meaning of 'faster than' and 'as fast as'. Something that is 7 times faster, is 8 times as fast (700% more compared to 800% of the total)."
mindcrack,3dvl0h,Espumma,9,Mon Jul 20 11:01:50 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is that ""seven times faster"" means 100% + 700% totaling 800%? I think if you thought about it hard enough, you could see it that way, but it's generally not used that way to my knowledge. If you said ""700% faster"" that would mean 800% of the value, but to us ""7 times faster"" means 700% of the value. ""X times faster"" and ""X times as fast"" are interchangeable as far as I'm aware."
mindcrack,3dvl0h,NedryOS,3,Mon Jul 20 11:37:43 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I was wondering about. Just seems like Chad was wrong when English doesn't use these two phrasings that way:P
mindcrack,3dvl0h,Espumma,2,Mon Jul 20 12:22:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, whoops. Perhaps you're right. I would just say 8 times faster/as fast because... well...  You've stumped me"
mindcrack,3dvl0h,bookworm2692,2,Mon Jul 20 11:17:00 2015 UTC,"No, that's not actually the case. By saying 'faster', you're excluding the original amount.  The same as using 'x times more'. Three is two times more than one, but three times as much."

mindcrack,3dvl0h,11Slimeade11,5,Mon Jul 20 12:19:11 2015 UTC,"Challenge creativity? I feel like boring flat plains are much more challenging in terms of creativity! Hills and mountains and bays let you work your build into the terrain, it makes it much easier to create a 'story' for your build. Like a harbour, with a lighthouse overlooking the harbour on the high mountain behind it - or like Nebris strategically building walls between peaks, or like Shree being inspired to make a desert castle harbour in a nice natural inlet! There is so much possibility with interesting terrain :)"
mindcrack,3dvl0h,bright_2,2,Mon Jul 20 13:06:05 2015 UTC,Could just be my playstyle. I can't stand building on top of hills and mountains. I either have to build in them or flatten them.

(and all the tunnels, maps, spawn rooms, BTC's ""Praise the Feather"") would that help lag?   I'm no minecraft expert, but watching the guys is so frustrating for me, no iron farm in the spawn chunks, no dedicated sheep farm, (for automatic farms in general) I always feel like they spend half of their episodes running around like headless chickens looking for materials."
mindcrack,3dvl0h,QueenLouey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:21 2015 UTC,"I believe that was the part of the reason they moved it; Spawn was laggy and everyone wanted change, but didn't want to reset again. So they decided to move spawn so that the huge projects in progress wouldn't be lost."
mindcrack,3dvl0h,TinkerTech,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:27:17 2015 UTC,I was hoping as well that they would set up their new spawn town slightly outside of spawn chunks - so that they could build a massive iron farm in the spawn chunk for community use.  They might still have something like that in mind.
mindcrack,3dvl0h,K_nikk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:28:39 2015 UTC,But would moving the spawn point move the spawn chunks? is that possible?
mindcrack,3dvl0h,QueenLouey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:52 2015 UTC,"oh, yeah it would only be ""pseudo-spawn"" town (near spawn but not in).  Spawn point would be in the spawn chunks though.  It doesn't look like they're going in that direction though.  It would be nice to have a massive iron farm, but certainly not essential."
mindcrack,3dvl0h,K_nikk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:10:11 2015 UTC,"Just read the wiki-   A new spawn point can be set using /setworldspawn. If no coordinates are provided, the northwest corner of the block the player is currently standing on will become the spawn point. Note that this will not load the new spawn chunks; it merely prevents them from unloading. The chunks can be loaded by walking into range or restarting the server. They will then remain loaded until the spawn point is moved again.   Seems like as long as they actually set the world spawn new, they'll be fine.  Hopefully they are smart about it!"
mindcrack,3dvl0h,QueenLouey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:39:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think they did that.  Kurt mentioned it in his stream, and it's effectively in the new spawn town.

Arkas' Town Hall, Etho's Tree which canopy kinda looked like a top hat.   Having to bid farewell, as /u/Guardax mentioned, to great those great former Mindcrackers really hit hard on the fanbase. I hope the new spawn is successful breathing life again into the heart of the Mindcrack Server and this amazing group of friends [Along with the VIPs hopefully] start making funny, passionate, sometimes sad, life-changing, eye-opening episodic clips of their adventures!

From what I know, there wasn't anything tricky in this contract, it was just saying they are allowed to use Mindcrack copyrighted material. Just some of them didn't want to sign. There is no hard feelings between them, but it's just all legal stuff. The reason they had to make Mindcrack a company is to copyright the name and logo."

mindcrack,3dxbk2,wJake1,12,Mon Jul 20 08:39:28 2015 UTC,"Chad is probably the most consistant at uploading, he has somewhere around 163 episodes, and Jsano also uploads consistently.  Quite a few people from the advenure to find a new spawn will probably start uploading consistantly, but I dont know yet.  If you havent seen the dragon fight then thats an obvious big event, but Id also say the border PvP they did was very fun to watch (Seth has a good perspective), also the adventure to find a new spawn is a big event (its one of the stickied posts if you want to watch somebodies POV).  I would suggest re-watching Chad if you want consistancy, but Guude is being quite consistant now if you want to watch him.  The UHCs in the past year have been very...intense to say the least, with some of the best fights in UHC history!  Also Nice flair xD"
mindcrack,3dxbk2,xSebtho,5,Mon Jul 20 09:22:18 2015 UTC,"Guys that have remained consistently active on the server are Chad, Jsano, Beef, I think Ads was for a while. Others like Avidya and Coe have had spurts. Activity has picked up now thanks to moving the spawn and will hopefully remain high for a while. There weren't any big events really, there has been UHC S21, I can't remember if UHC S20 was before you would've left but it happened too. Shree (former Mindcracker up to early S4) has returned to the server as a VIP. There are also plenty of livestreams from guys like Sev, BTC, and Pak.  I don't know if you're interested but I think there are some big recording groups that have surfaced in the 6 months you've been gone. The Show, formerly the Space Engineers group but they've branched out into new games, consists of Millbee, Guude, and Coe. They play a game for a few weeks and then move on. The Speedrunners group is fairly consistent in uploading speedrunners footage and consists of Avidya, Kurt, Coe, and Millbee. I'm sure there are others that I've forgotten about but I don't watch all the content, but I'm sure others will help :)"

I really hope they do this...  As they planned, they should try fighting the Brain again, since it'll let them make more stuff. More importantly, they might get some good drops from the orbs; there's a very nice magic weapon in them.  One last thing: They can now get those blocks in the Underground Desert they couldn't get before. It makes some very nice stuff... But it might be a bit too powerful for where they are in the game."

mindcrack,3dxhq9,ClosetTroll100,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:39:12 2015 UTC,"German does have a tendency to sound quite harsh, Norwegian and Swedish have a more sing song quality to it. If you want to learn more about it wikipedia's got a pretty good article about it.  Here's a short paragraph that gives you the essentials: ""Norwegian is a pitch accent language with two distinct pitch patterns, just like Swedish. They are used to differentiate two-syllable words with otherwise identical pronunciation. For example, in many East Norwegian dialects, the word ""bønder"" (farmers) is pronounced using tone 1, while ""bønner"" (beans or prayers) uses tone 2. Though spelling differences occasionally differentiate written words, in most cases the minimal pairs are written alike, since written Norwegian has no explicit accent marks. In most eastern low-tone dialects, accent 1 uses a low flat pitch in the first syllable, while accent 2 uses a high, sharply falling pitch in the first syllable and a low pitch in the beginning of the second syllable. In both accents, these pitch movements are followed by a rise of intonational nature (phrase accent)—the size (and presence) of which signals emphasis or focus, and corresponds in function to the normal accent in languages that lack lexical tone, such as English. That rise culminates in the final syllable of an accentual phrase, while the utterance-final fall common in most languages is either very small or absent.  There are significant variations in pitch accent between dialects. Thus, in most of western and northern Norway (the so-called high-pitch dialects) accent 1 is falling, while accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable or somewhere around the syllable boundary. The pitch accents (as well as the peculiar phrase accent in the low-tone dialects) give the Norwegian language a ""singing"" quality that makes it easy to distinguish from other languages.

Edit: after watching Milbee's perspective after Guude's its clear to see that he only drives straight, so he probably rubberbanded the R2 button to only drive forwards and so he could get xp for not playing and unlock everything, which is a lame way of going about it cause it only takes 165 matches to unlock everything"

mindcrack,3dv6mz,IlI4n,3,Mon Jul 20 20:31:18 2015 UTC,"Anderz usually returns to the server when there is new stuff to toy around with after an update, or when they start over. So since they have found a new spawn, he might hop on again when the 1.9 snapshots start appearing.   Doc  already has enough vanilla content. He currently has Hermitcraft and the World Tour, so not very likely to come back soon.   MC & Millbee also not very likely. They both have little interest in Minecraft atm. If Orange Wool ever decides to get together again, they might hop on and do some random stuff together.   Mhykol tweeted about possibly rejoining a little while ago IIRC. Not sure what became of it, but there's definitely a possibility if he has the time.   Zisteau partly stopped because of the lag(?), and now that it has been resolved and a new spawn has been found, it all comes down to what series he has. His single player is taking up most of his Minecraft needs, and I personally think he'll pick another CTM map over rejoining the server."

He used a a texture pack (I think) to find all the signs in the contest for a spot on the Mindcrack server.

He started playing it mid-June, but then suddenly stopped after June 27.   So someone who usually catches Coe's streams, has he mentioned anything about it? I know he plays whatever he feels like, but I was just wondering if he's done with it or if he will continue whenever?"
mindcrack,3dv6mz,jaaski,2,Mon Jul 20 14:58:57 2015 UTC,"That's just Coe. He might pick it up again at some point, but if he's done with a game or wants to move on to another, he'll just leave that other game behind without worrying too much about it.  That said, Coe is often a stickler for completion of games (even when he doesn't like the game very much) so it wouldn't surprise me if he came back to it one day.  I've missed a lot of Coe streams lately thanks to timezones shifting a few months back, so I don't know if he's actually talked about it all though. Just keep an eye out and maybe he'll come back to it one day."

mindcrack,3dv1vo,_scootastic,4,Mon Jul 20 03:38:10 2015 UTC,"In the world of manufacturing, one of the things engineers look at is ""mean time between failure"".  Essentially, how long after a specific piece of equipment is started up would you expect it to fail.  I thought it would be interesting to apply this analysis to mindcrack(tm) deaths in UHC events.  The way I calculated mean time between failures was to sum each UHC participants total play time during all the UHC events divided by their number of deaths.  If a participant won a UHC event, then their ""lifespan"" count continued to go up during the next season that they played in.  Not participating in a season doesn't impact the math with how I set up the spreadsheets.  You can pick out when people win a UHC because they generally will have a large gap between their deaths (each dot on the graph) and an increase in their mean time between deaths.  For this initial graph, I only included those with the most play time because the graphs look better.  It typically takes about 10 data points for someone to line out at their average mean time between deaths.  I do have the data for everyone though, and if people like the chart, I will post more after the next UHC.  Someone else did most of the work for pulling together this data by marking the time of each UHC death here: http://mindcrack.altervista.org/wiki/MindCrack_Ultra_Hardcore/Season_20 .  It made it a lot easier to enter all the data and do the math.  PS: I'm doing this in Excel instead of JMP like I would at work... so I'm much more limited in the graphs I can make."

Yeah, the graph essentially is a prediction of how long people will stay alive in any given UHC.  It's useful if you want to select which perspectives to watch based on past history of generating lots of episodes.  It definitely doesn't take into account how exciting or ""productive"" a person's videos would be. :)"

I've got three sources that each indicate that ruby and diamonds are the best: The gem hooks, the gem staves, and the gem cloaks. I'll let you look them up if you care, but as an example: the Ruby Magic Staff requires Gold and Rubies, while the Diamond Staff requires Platinum and Diamonds. Since Gold and Platinum are equal tiers, with Platinum being slightly better, it can be assumed that Rubies are the second best gem.   While on the subject of the gem staves, I'd really like it if you made them. I've never seen someone use them, so I'm really curious as to how good they are. They might even beat the Space Gun! Now, you might think that you can't craft the Diamond staff since your world has Gold, but you'd be incorrect. You can get Platinum in your world. All you have to do is process Silt and Slush with the Extractinator. Eventually, you'll get enough of all the other ores to make Platinum stuff.  Speaking of the Extractinator, there's another use for it you should check out. Remember the Fossils in the Underground Desert? Now you can dig them up! With the Extractinator, they can be cleaned up, and made into an excellent set of armor. According to the wiki, when combined with the Javelin which can also be made from the materials, the armor can get you all the way to Hardmode. Not sure about Expert Hardmode, but it still sounds promising.

Some teleporters didn't unlock for me after activating either, the scoreboard commands used for the unlock didn't work. I just edited the blocks to teleport me without checking.  If a teleporter didn't unlock properly, break the bedrock and remove the score_zonename_min=1 from the command block that has the tp command.  There's another bug (probably 1.8 related), most quest items can't be turned in due to the way they were named.  Anyway, back to the episode : no deaths! The descent is pretty easy, unless you fall down. Oh, and it's too bad they can't get the singleplayer upgrades. The strength one is really good.  The things you get from emerald blocks are great.

mindcrack,3drmg1,ManInTheHat,8,Sat Jul 18 22:14:37 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna be a bit blunt here: Frankly, if you play in a version other than what the mapmaker specifies the map was made for, you pretty much lose all right to complain about things being broken. Maps are built entirely around a certain version, and with how many changes have happened between versions in the last few major patches (primarily 1.7->1.8), if a mapmaker specifically states the version it's made for, playing it in any other version comes with an acknowledgement that the challenge may vary wildly from what's intended and in some cases the map may be broken entirely, and this cannot fairly be blamed on the mapmaker.  The stuff you've pointed out is actually fair and not blame-ey at all, just a pet peeve that I have because I see it on /r/minecraft and the main minecraft forums all the time, how people will often complain about a map that was made for 1.5 being broken when they try to play it in 1.8 cough Pantheon cough."
mindcrack,3drmg1,0x00000000,2,Sat Jul 18 22:55:14 2015 UTC,"Looks like you got a few of these complaining posts :p.  I meant it more as an fyi. I was somewhere at the end of the intersection 1 zones when I noticed I had the wrong version. I think I could have downgraded without damage but wasn't sure. Blaming the mapmaker for the map breaking between versions is really dumb. Even blaming mojang. What are they supposed to do, never add anything that changes the game balance?"
mindcrack,3drmg1,ManInTheHat,6,Sun Jul 19 07:02:38 2015 UTC,"I know it was updated to 1.8, but GOB (and Zisteau, and many other players) used the 1.5 version and played it in 1.8, and there were many, many complaints about the map being broken, when it was being played in a version it was never intended to be played in. I'm not confused at the downvotes, nobody on this subreddit follows Reddiquette and opts to downvote something they disagree with, even when it adds to the discussion."
mindcrack,3drmg1,ManInTheHat,4,Sat Jul 18 23:54:57 2015 UTC,"The point still stands that they either didn't read or didn't care that the map was made for 1.5; they played it in 1.8 despite the version warning. As /u/taschneide said below, the update was put into overdrive so that it GOB/Zisteau could have it done properly, and there's no indication that any of them knew the map was even BEING updated to 1.8 until they were specifically contacted by Fangride with requests for their copies of the map in order to finish the update."

mindcrack,3drmg1,lzgr,5,Sun Jul 19 01:55:05 2015 UTC,"In their defense, I would also think that you can just go from area to area at will since it's not actually explained anywhere in the map. Soo, what do you actually need to do to gain access to the teleporters? Put redstone torches above them?"
mindcrack,3drmg1,airstorm747,3,Sun Jul 19 00:00:04 2015 UTC,"You have to activate a teleporter on the receiving end of an area.   Since these areas are large, there's usually a teleporter in the middle of the area that leads back to the nexus (to the teleporter hub room). Say they go to Area X. If they activate the teleporter in Area X they go back to that Hub Room in The Nexus, and in that Hub Room there should be a teleporter that leads to the same spot in Area X.  They weren't able to access the Int.I teleporter because they haven't stepped on the teleporter that resides in Int.I yet.  And yeah, it's not explained at all in this map, but it is in Ragecraft III (I'm Beta-Testing). Someone should notify heliceo to just add that in though I doubt he wants to update RCII anymore."
mindcrack,3drmg1,MrRivet,3,Sat Jul 18 21:01:09 2015 UTC,"Huh. That seems like an extremely counter intuitive interpretation to me. Like, it should just be naturally assumed that these are fast travel points that need to be activated. Like check points, basically (which is what many of them serve as). Otherwise you could do problematic things like sequence break right to intersection 4 and ninja some of the best loot.  But that's a number of people now who didn't get it, so i guess not!"

mindcrack,3drqgs,Ekketlol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:53:40 2015 UTC,It's time for a new city with much better terrain. I'm looking forward to season 2.
mindcrack,3drqgs,myselfalso,0,Mon Jul 20 16:05:01 2015 UTC,"So I registered to reddit to be able to tell you this.  I would strongly advocate against starting a new city. I really feel that's a bad idea, for many reasons.  1°) I feel like when you do a ""new round"" of videos, with this kind of game (KSP, factorio, hell, even terraria to some extent), it gets boring. Because part of the fun is seeing you discover the game, make mistakes, rectify them, learn, adapt, etc.  I do not like season 2 on these games, and I feel like the numbers (of viewers) are always much less than season 1.  2°) We viewers get used to the ""world"", or city in this case. At least I do, not sure why, I just do. I'd rather look at you try to reach 200k people, enrich your city to the maximum, redo districts, try to actually fix current traffic issues, etc. I feel this is much richer than watching you start from scratch again.  You potentially have 25 tiles to work with...  3°) To be honest, I don't feel like you've learned a lot. Not trying to be mean (really not), but I simply don't get this feeling. So it does sound weird, or wrong, to hear you say that you will make a new city with all the stuff that you learned.   You've not learned to fix traffic issues, to manage the lanes on highways, to keep an healthy industrial, to maximize services coverage, I mean... I mean, I'm not really eager to see you apply all your knowledge to a new map, I really think you're still in the process of acquiring said knowledge. It's too early.  That, or you know a lot more than you show - but I sort of doubt it.  4°) In my experience at least, the game begins to be actually challenging at around 100k people. This number could very well be related to my own city. But the point is, the more people, the more challenging it gets, mainly because of traffic and general maintenance cost. So it does feel a bit ""cheap"", maybe not cheap, but sad, to wipe the city so fast. It's like playing the tutorial again and again. You're missing the tedious challenging part.  Well, this last part I'm not too sure about, this is the impression I get from my game anyway.    Sorry if this all sounds bad, english is not my native language and I'm just trying to get the point accross. I think it's too early. I think season 2 on these games, on your channel, haven't been very successful, for a reason.   This is my feedback. I'll support you no matter what because you're awesome.  Thanks for the videos, cheers."
mindcrack,3drqgs,Yank31,7,Sun Jul 19 09:27:17 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have to learn everything in just his first big city. There are a lot of problems with this city, and it's probably easier to start from scratch than trying to rework his existing city. I want to see him make better plans for his next city, and then encounter new problems on the way. And surely, as much as he'll try to plan around them, he will find new problems.  Surely, there will be some 'nostalgia' for the first series when he starts the next one. In the first few episodes, we won't see a lot of crazy highways or starfish roundabouts... yet. However, for a YouTuber, it's good to start with something new from time to time: new viewers can pick up the series starting from episode 1 instead of having to catch up on a backlog of episodes. Z is aware of this, he even breaks up his Zisteau Plays Minecraft series with a montage after every 50 episodes to allow new viewers to quickly catch up."
mindcrack,3drqgs,BBQCalculator,-2,Sun Jul 19 09:45:12 2015 UTC,"I dont feel like starting from scratch is better than keeping the original serie going, for a youtuber. I feel like this is entirely up for discussion. Etho has the same world going for 300 episodes, and no montages either.  Also as you said - and we agree on that - it's probably easier to start from scratch than trying to rework the existing city. Is ""easier"" the Z way, though?"

Using them without subsonic ammo will lessen the detection distance but still be audible with the supersonic crack while using them with subsonic ammo will keep you from being detected while using a manual action/single shot firearm unless you're ridiculously close to an enemy with semi-auto/full-auto.

They could've kept the Season 3 map until the 1.7 terrain update before resetting to our present Season 5 map on Oct 25, 2013.  Many events that happened in Season 5 could only happen in Season 5.

mindcrack,3dnlsa,Kcrunch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"Will there be highlight videos from Zeldathon Deluxe on top of the full playlist, similar to the Every Zelda In April highlights? I know it's great being able to watch the whole thing in its entirety, but there were some great moments that could warrant their own snippets without having to go ""<URL to game>#timecode"" - at least, that's what I'm assuming the use behind folk spamming ""+ht"" in the chat at particular times was."
mindcrack,3dnlsa,neohylanmay,2,Fri Jul 17 20:18:45 2015 UTC,"I actually just looked into the highlights that CoeBot logs based on the +ht command and they are extremely limited :(  I feel as if CoeBot derped up during the marathon or we didn't promote the +ht thing enough...  I do have all the footage pretty much as it went up today and could  go through it and provide timestamps to put in each game's description to memorable moments (Relief's videos have this as well), but that'll take some time."
mindcrack,3dnlsa,stinusmeret,2,Fri Jul 17 20:31:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be a case of ""not promoting +ht"", because I remember the chat being nothing but ""+ht"" for a lot of moments - heck, I personally had no idea what it meant when I first saw it, but soon figured it out.  I don't know exactly how many moments the chat were wanting to highlight (with it being run all day, I was asleep half the time), but I would hazard a guess that ""multiple mentions of the same timecode (with about a minute either way)"" is a moment that people definitely wanted saving. That is of course, unless the number of ""+ht""s are in the very-few-hundreds (I would be surprised if it was <500 total), and/or CoeBot didn't pick them all up.."
mindcrack,3dnlsa,neohylanmay,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:42:15 2015 UTC,"Well I wrote the original code for the +ht command that is now fully integrated into Coebot.  Multiple hits in the same minute get grouped together to know how popular that 1 minute segment was.  In the total 130 hour span of the marathon that resulted into 64 segments being highlighted (most only have a count of 1 hit as well), which doesn't make sense to me :/  I'm pretty sure there are far more memorable moments than that...  Edit: for testing purposes I looked up the big 25k donation that I would expect to be highlighted and it's not.  I had to manually find it."

mindcrack,3dnm5k,JamiroFan2000,10,Fri Jul 17 19:04:05 2015 UTC,"Z, you really should check if you're not getting traffic jams with the trains and metro as well. I noticed at one point in the video in the Expansion at least 4 trains backed up. They can back up, just like regular traffic if you have too many of them, and metro too. If you have too many lines going through one metro stop, it'll jam up. I usually have to make two or three stops parallel to each other if it's a busy place."
mindcrack,3dnm5k,Neamow,6,Fri Jul 17 20:44:36 2015 UTC,"There are quite a few cargo trains backing up behind the passenger trains in the Expansion. Cargo trains from/to the outside of the city have to stop two times for those trains to pick up passengers.  To fix this, Z should probably route cargo trains around the Expansion, similar to how cargo and passenger trains are separated in the rest of his city. It's okay if they share the mountain connection between the city and the coast, as long as there are no stops there.  As for the metro, try to keep the amount of stops under control. The new loop stops at every stop in the Expansion, which are already covered by the existing loop in Expansion. A better solution would be to just make a line between a station in Expansion and a station in the city, and have passengers use the local loops to reach these 'connector' stations.  I'm really looking forward to what Z can come up with for his next city. It doesn't have to be perfectly optimized, but I'm hoping he tries to plan for all these things a bit better."
mindcrack,3dnm5k,BBQCalculator,4,Fri Jul 17 20:54:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know if he noticed it but top of the dams are actually roads, you can use existing dams as bridges and shortcuts if needed to be."

Got work over the holidays too, that just consists of sitting in my mums shop and advertising her crafted goods, but if she makes money then I get a cut for doing the work for her so that makes me want to do it even more. Going to pick up the EE battery pack thing tomorrow too that they were giving out for free for ages, I've never had the time to nip into town and pick it up from the EE store. That means I can have my phone for longer and that's always good.

I win most my matches based on catches alone.  Don't throw too flat, get a bit of a loop going.  Watch your fucking elbows.  If you play in pairs/two balls, aim for the same cup and throw them with little gap inbetween so you can catch them out on doublecup victories.  Don't predrink, it'll get you plenty fucked on it's own.  Use your one rearrange when there are 3 opponent cups left, get them in a straight line down the middle.  Don't forget you can blow our spinning balls.  Chuck in a bounceshot every now and again, it'll catch them out.  Mind your fucking elbows.  TL;DR: I like beer pong and watch your elbows."

Do one or two practice ""throws"" (mimicing a throw but not releasing it) with your eye directly behind the ball, assuring that the ball is moving in a straight line directly toward the desired cup.

I got into Mindcrack because my brother linked me to Zisteau's pranks from when he first started.  When he finished Pantheon, I started watching GOB play it...  That gave me a thought; is there an open server where everyone tries to work together to get through a challenge map, switching every month or two, once supplies become too plentiful, and the challenge is lost?  How often is there a thread of teams/collabs we wish would happen?  Is that a thing that should be regular, or a thing that should be discouraged?  I could imagine it'd be great for a MCer to find out a lot of Mindcrack fans would love to see them do a collab that's been on their mind, but I could see any of the more popular MCers getting annoyed with people trying to get a collab that's just a clash of personalities."

I forget the exact formula, but I think it might be moved three days in the week earlier, but still have ten days between occurences. I'm probably wrong on the exact numbers though, so you'll have to look it up. Mod sale days are also affected.  A few other things:   Party skills, such as Breeder, apply to the whole party. If two people have a party skill, the person with the higher level of the skill is used. You currently have someone with Breeder 10, which is the highest level of it available, so getting levels in Breeder is pointless for you. Also, a few skills cap out at ten levels. You might want to try to get those, so they don't appear when you level up.  Your inventory is starting to fill up occasionally. You might want to expand it, especially if a boss day is coming up.  If you get another Cup and Ragnorak sword before day 80, try it again with some good Grenades. That's one of your best chances to do it, as on day 80 they'll be buffed, since it is a new round.  Oh, and the game only seems to be on easy mode now since it is the start of a round. It'll start to get tough pretty soon."

Doesn't mean you need to go out and take it, but many of the benefits are well-known and researched.  If you are consuming kids multi-vitamins, and not just adult chewables, you really shouldn't bother.  One, Multi vitamins are balanced towards the demographic they are meant for and since you aren't a kid, you'll not be receiving the minerals that are more beneficial to an adult male than a kid(same as a multi for women have a different balance). Two, but studies have been coming in that supplements are essentially a placebo-level benefit(these have been more difficult for me to find again to link), and your money is better spent on focusing on specific minerals/vitamins you are missing in your diet, or adding the appropriate foods instead.(note these studies are more recent and likely more research is needed)  I recommend healthcare Triage as a good YouTube channel for this stuff."

Funny thing - recently I was comparing the labels of Coca-Cola Zero and Coca-Cola Light (Diet Coke in the US) and the nutritional labels as well as the ingredients were almost identical. The only difference was I think an acidity regulator (E310 vs E311 or something like that).

You don't have to take it, but if enough people, including medical professionals, find it to be more beneficial than not, who cares? Stop arguing.

mindcrack,3djsmf,K_nikk,2,Fri Jul 17 15:57:16 2015 UTC,"It is not bad to be skeptical about extreme health benefit claims.  Something that is healthy/recommended for one person may not do anything for others, and may actually be harmful to some.  Fish oil also has it's side effects and interactions, just like a lot of things we ingest.  For example, fish oil can interact with some medications (like high blood pressure medication), and in higher dosages can reduce blood clotting and prolong bleeding. .  Anyway point is, it is NOT a bad thing for people to be cautious about health claims presented in an anecdotal manner.   People should be encouraged to do research for themselves and learn how to separate biased vs. unbiased information and scientifically sound evidence vs. anecdotal evidence."

It just seemed like a smug attitude to have, like it's all in peoples' heads no matter what someone says. Seemed kind of passive-agressive. Again, you're not wrong about any of that, but his attitude just got to me at the time. For all of minute. But I'm still having ""back and forths"" on here still. :/  Also, sorry for any spelling mistakes if I made any. Phone's keyboard only bothers to correct when it feels like.

Women are a minority in the gaming community. They often feel threatened my male gamers, especially those associated with G-merG-te (like there is a specific reason I am spelling that out).  Articles like these are incredibly important because a lot of time these women gamers wouldn't be recognized because they have smaller subscriber bases. I can promise you that each one on that list has had to deal hateful comments about how they don't belong in the gaming community purely because of their gender. Representation is so important, it allows subscribers to to feel something in common with YouTubers.  Articles like these are so incredibly important for a variety of reasons. First it allows young women to have an example to look up to. Young girls who may want to get into YouTube but might be scared to do so. Representation is so important, especially in the gaming community. Secondly, this article shows the diversity in the gaming community, helping the perception that gaming is just filled with men. Lastly it highlights gamers who might not get much publicity. There is a stigma against women in gaming and articles like these need to continue.   -- emilythecool   If I had a 10 to 13-year-old niece that I was trying to get into gaming, this would be a perfect list to send her. Of course I would hope that eventually she would just be into gaming generally, and not care about the gender of the gamer she's watching. But if she thinks of gaming as a ""boy's thing"", this would be a great way to show her she's wrong and introduce her to the world in a way she can relate to.   -- annab3lla"

mindcrack,3dj8dr,RedCow01,7,Fri Jul 17 05:25:37 2015 UTC,From the person who posts on /r/MensRights.
mindcrack,3dj8dr,quwertie,-1,Fri Jul 17 05:36:13 2015 UTC,"Found the person who doesn't want to hear facts. Let me break it down for you. The 77 cent myth is often stated as '77 cents for the same work.' However, it was actually just the total amount of money earned in a lifetime of men vs. women. The phrasing of '77 cents' rather than '77%' makes it seem like it applies to people doing the exact same work, however this is untrue. Excluding unmarried, childless women (who make MORE than their male counterparts), women tend to make less money than men for a few reasons.   Job choice. Women are much more likely to choose humanitarian jobs. These jobs will pay less, but the women who work in these fields will be happier. Men are much more likely to choose dangerous and disgusting jobs- men die 9 times as much as women at work. Dangerous jobs pay better. Hours worked. Men work more hours than women across the board. Pregnancy leave. If you take a year off or more in the middle of your career, you're wallet's going to take a hit.   In addition, it is completely illegal to pay a women less than a man for the same work. So if you believe your male coworkers are getting more than you unfairly, please call a lawyer. You will get filthy rich suing your employer if there is sex discrimination. And, if it was so easy to get away with paying women 23% less than men, why wouldn't employers fire all the men, hire women and save 23% on paying employees? It would be a no-brainer."
mindcrack,3dj8dr,quwertie,3,Fri Jul 17 05:53:16 2015 UTC,That would be higher if the government got some sense knocked into their heads and passed paid pregnancy ones so that we and fucking Papua New Guinea wouldn't be the only ones without it.

mindcrack,3dj8dr,quwertie,-6,Fri Jul 17 11:06:21 2015 UTC,"Women, overall, choose happiness over money. Do you think this is somehow a bad thing? Do you think school psychologists should all be forced into science? Of course not, that would be fucking ludicrous. And if by 'something else' you're insinuating that there's a mystical patriarchy trying to keep women down at all times, you're essentially saying any choice a woman makes was predetermined for her by a man. Which denies women free will and agency and is therefore sexist as hell.   Not to mention, you missed the point. For the same job, working the same amount of hours, men and women make the same exact amount. Occasionally it drifts a few cents, but it goes both ways, at about equal rates. When compared like-to-like, there is no wage gap."

There are countless women-only STEM scholarships. Literally every poster I've seen trying to get people into STEM has a woman front and center. Women are adults. Women have free will.

If I remember correctly, the adjusted value is more along the lines of $0.95, which is obviously still a gap, but not nearly as drastic as the other value. I'm as well aware as anyone that /r/MensRights has a lot of bad eggs but just the fact that he's posted there doesn't make him incorrect."

Considering the pay gap used to be much larger, I think we're nearing the end of the road to an adjusted $1 to $1, rather than just getting started as some people seem to think. The process of changing a societal issue at its roots takes time, and it has been slowly rectifying itself."

This may be a real issue, sure, but bullshit paraders like her do not speak for feminists or anyone with half a brain. I'm all for equality, but I seethe at the notion that all males in gaming are sexist, misogynist, troglodytes. That may not be what you think (great!), but that is what many on the anti-gamergate side perpetuate. All feminists and all people who decide to do any research for themselves should never be in sarkeesian's fetid camp.

Super buff men aren't a sexual fantasy for most women, but the portrayal of women in video games is a sexual fantasy for most men.  The fact that men are 'supposed' to aim to be super buff is a symptom of toxic masculinity and is also caused by the patriarchy, which says guys should be ashamed for any 'feminine' traits."

Articles like these are incredibly important because a lot of time these women gamers wouldn't be recognized because they have smaller subscriber bases. I can promise you that each one on that list has had to deal hateful comments about how they don't belong in the gaming community purely because of their gender. Representation is so important, it allows subscribers to to feel something in common with YouTubers.   Articles like these are so incredibly important for a variety of reasons. First it allows young women to have an example to look up to. Young girls who may want to get into YouTube but might be scared to do so. Representation is so important, especially in the gaming community. Secondly, this article shows the diversity in the gaming community, helping the perception that gaming is just filled with men. Lastly it highlights gamers who might not get much publicity. There is a stigma against women in gaming and articles like these need to continue."

I'm guessing you spend a lot of time reading the non-sense put out by sites like Gawker or Sarkeesian, and fail to actually participate in the Gamergate community, such as KiA for example.  Gamergate exists because of shitty practices by shitty people. It has fuck all to do with Gender. The reason people push that line of nonsense is because it's easy to dismiss criticism of yourself if you can just say that everyone who disagrees hates you for being a woman, or minority, or whatever else they want to hide behind. That's when the Hashtag ""NotYourShield"" came up, because those groups of people got tired of being used as pawns by those trying to deflect criticism.  People like to pretend that there's this huge community of women hating men out to destroy all women in the gaming industry. And yet, when pushed for specifics, they still can't cite a single instance of a Gamergate supporter managing to kill the career of a woman in games or tech. In fact, I would challenge you to find a single organized effort by Gamergate supporters designed to eliminate women from gaming.. or anyone for that matter.  Of course, it's hard to see that when there are communities out there that ban you for having an opposing opinion, or use ""Guilt by Association"" to ignore you.  Unfortunately, these days, Gamergate seems to be one of the few groups willing to come out and support developers who make creative decisions in their games, while those groups who seem to oppose Gamergate are doing everything they can to censor anything they don't like.

mindcrack,3dj8dr,Xsythe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that of all the people, you try to use Leigh Alexander as someone who was unjustly targeted. The Goal of the consumer boycott campaigns is to inform Advertisers of the sort of things that they are indirectly sponsoring. One of which was Leigh Alexander and many of the terrible things she said.  In one instance, she tries to encourage sending poison to a guy already suffering from heart troubles. In another, she tried to threaten to use her followers to harass a woman who called out her friend for leaving false reviews on books. These aren't even the worst of the things.  As it turns out, in many cases, advertisers don't like to be associated with individuals like her where they can be tied to supporting comments like that through sponsoring the medium in which they are spread.  She is and was, just another toxic person with a platform to spew hateful things about gamers and others. One of the places she decided to do that was with Gamasutra.  I would put forth that, if the simple act of informing sponsors of the kind of content they are sponsoring is enough to convince them to pull out and ""silences"" the site in question, then can you really lay the blame at Gamergate?  That's a bit like laying the blame at the hands of a bystander who reports to the police that someone down the street is kicking dogs. Who is really at fault for what happens? The bystander? The dog kicker? The dog? The police?"
mindcrack,3dj8dr,Bur_Sangjun,-1,Sat Jul 18 17:45:18 2015 UTC,"So, she jokingly encourages sending poisoned candy to the notorious Jack Thompson, one of the most-hated anti-gamer activists of all time? Seriously? THAT UPSETS YOU?  And when you claim she threatens to leverage her followers, she actually says that she won't do it.  Additionally, threatening advertisers of a site is the ultimate form of censorship -- literally, attempting to get content removed because it's something you dislike.  Doesn't she have just as much right to write whatever she wants without the threat of censorship?  Isn't this comparable to people encouraging Target to pull GTA V in Australia? The vast majority of articles on Gamasutra are tech-focused educational pieces, just like the vast majority of GTA V isn't objectionable.  This hypocrisy has always amused me."

Seriously? THAT UPSETS YOU?   So no bad tactics, only bad targets then? Is that the argument you're going with? That because of who the individual is, it's ok to jokingly insinuate that they should just die? Ok, glad we got that cleared up.   And when you claim she threatens to leverage her followers, she actually says that she won't do it.    So the other times she's threatened the leverage of her followers it was... what? A joke too? This is called a pattern.    Additionally, threatening advertisers of a site is the ultimate form of censorship -- literally, attempting to get content removed because it's something you dislike.   How so? Freedom of speech is not freedom of consequences. If someone goes around making bigoted and ignorant comments, especially as a public figure, they shouldn't be surprised when people decide to call them out on it.  When sponsors begin pulling out of a website or company because said website/company is promoting a toxic viewpoint, that's not censorship. Thats the companies saying ""We agree, we don't want to be associated with that."".   Doesn't she have just as much right to write whatever she wants without the threat of censorship?   Sure, and consumers and advertisers also have the right to express their dissatisfaction with her threats and ignorant comments.    Isn't this comparable to people encouraging Target to pull GTA V in Australia? The vast majority of articles on Gamasutra are tech-focused educational pieces, just like the vast majority of GTA V isn't objectionable. This hypocrisy has always amused me.   The biggest difference is that GTA V was pulled due to complete lies and fabrication as to the goal of the game.   That's not at all comparable to people telling sponsors what they're sponsoring. There's a difference between lying to get something pulled, and showing factual discussions someone has had that are hateful and ignorant. To suggest that the two are even comparable is laughable at best.  It isn't hypocrisy to say ""We'd like you to stop sponsoring a website that defends a writer who calls people ""hoodrats"" and tries to use her position to intimidate people."", nor is it hypocrisy to say ""GTA V was pulled due to fabricated lies about the goal and objective of the game.""."

You can read more at http://www.deepfreeze.it which documents them.   Just Check Wikipedia   I'm just going to ignore that statement, considering wikipedia has had a smear campaign from WP:Feminism going on since this whole shit began, resulting in a number of the members of that wiki-project being banned for battleground behaviour, and the WP:Own and WP:Circus on the GG article are rediculous, I did a statistical analysis on it about 5 months ago, and over 70% of the discussion is controlled by 5 people, 3 of whom have publicly anounced a bias, and one of whom has received donations from the Anti-GG movement, so I'm not going to count anything WP says as credible when it comes to GG."

I don't hate articles like this exposing popular gaming women in the industry; that's all great. That's not at all what anybody is saying. What we hate, is that line that sexism is ""alive and well"" in the gaming industry. No it fucking isn't.   There are a few out there who are sexist, and who also play games. These people are despicable individuals, but they exist everywhere. They are not limited to a certain facet of this world. and they are a minority. I'm sorry that they exist, truly, I am. It sucks for women to have to deal with that shit from assholes like them. But lemme tell you something. I'm a guy. I have played a few mmos and games like counter strike and dota. I am occasionally afraid to continue playing some of the games because of the vitriol I was getting at being a new player. People were throwing malevolent insults at me like it was nothing. To claim that men are completely at home in the gaming industry is absolutely bullshit. These assholes who admonish women for being... women... are likely also assholes to everyone else. Or at least, their insults are not limited to a particular sex.

If it wasn't for their gender it would be for any other reason you could think of. People are dicks, especially on the internet. Both men and women get hateful messages.  Edit: If you are going to down vote this at least reply with why, I'm genuinely interested in why actual equality is a bad thing instead of promoting each gender independently."

mindcrack,3dj8dr,annab3lla,-1,Thu Jul 16 23:24:08 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't.  Example: the transgender episode, which was exclusively dedicated to degrading what is likely the most hated and misunderstood minority in the world.  South Park is like an edgy teenager who says they're not hateful, because they hate everyone equally, or who insists on insulting people and then goes ""hey I'm just being honest guys!!!!!"""
mindcrack,3dj8dr,nicbemused,2,Thu Jul 16 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"Nearly every time it appears to be being offensive to a group it is actually insulting the people who actually try to offend a group of people, not the group itself."
mindcrack,3dj8dr,Thejklay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:37:25 2015 UTC,"The episode is entitled 'The Cissy' and the takeaway from it is ""don't be a cissy"" and let people go to whichever bathroom they feel most comfortable in.  So they made a whole episode about an issue trans people struggle with, and you think they're doing it to hate on trans people?"
mindcrack,3dj8dr,SpetS15,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:57:38 2015 UTC,"This example is about racism and fictional characters, but it does a really good job of illustrating why representation is so important.  Just switch white/POC for men/women and main characters for publicity.  That's why articles like this are so important.  If a girl (or boy for that matter) wants a male role model they can look literally anywhere to find one.  I googled 'lets players' and the first article I found had 8/10 male lets players.  All the most popular lets players I can think of are male.  By contrast if they wanted a female role they have to look much harder to find a good amount of them (because they might not like the 1 or 2 included on the list with both genders).  That's why articles like this are so important."
mindcrack,3dj8dr,ValluZXC,-9,Fri Jul 17 13:13:36 2015 UTC,"See, but the problem with this article isn't that it promotes women, it's that it promotes only women. If this article was called ""Brilliant Gamers of Youtube"", and had a list of inspiring males and females, it would be fine. It could give smaller Youtubers publicity and recognize others for what they've accomplished. No problems with that  Don't get me wrong, I'm not against women in gaming. I'd love a 50/50 split. And I don't like the fact that some female gamers get hateful comments because of their gender. But these articles are not the solution, and aren't helping. You can give young girls someone to look up to without needing to make the list entirely about women."
mindcrack,3dj8dr,ArarielFett,13,Thu Jul 16 21:15:15 2015 UTC,"But these articles are not the solution, and aren't helping.   What makes you say that they aren't helping? I am an avid gamer, and I watch way more male gamers than female gamers (mainly because I mostly watch Mindcrackers, so proportions...). But as a woman, articles like this do make me feel more at home in the gaming world. They make me feel like there are people in common with me, like I'm not just in a guys-only world. They are a factor in making me want to stick around.   For girls who are even less comfortable in the gaming world than I am, I imagine the impact of articles like this would be even stronger."
mindcrack,3dj8dr,Rendamar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:12:57 2015 UTC,"They are a factor in making me want to stick around ....  I imagine the impact of articles like this would be even stronger.   Now imagine how much stronger the impact would be if the articles didn't carve out a special section just for women, and included them amongst their male counterparts.  It's the difference between being nominated for ""Best Action Game"" and ""Game of the Year"".  Sure, it's nice to be able to compete in a category designed specifically for you, but imagine how much greater an accomplishment it is to compete and be recognized in a category that includes everyone.  Personally, I'd be much happier for my accomplishments if they were compared to everyone, and not just one group of people. Then I could say that I really was equal and great, and not worry that the only reason I was recognized was because I had a special category.  Basically what I'm saying is:  This is great for Aurey. I said that in my original comment here. But imagine how much greater it would be if she were recognized as part of a ""Brilliant Gamers of Youtube"" group that included everyone.  I get the reason why articles like this exist, however, as The Chronox said, these types of articles aren't helping because they're basically telling people:  ""These women need a special category because they can't compare to the men."" instead of showing them right up there next to the men and saying ""These women are competing and doing great amongst everyone."".  It's one reason why I like Mindcrack. They aren't out there to promote someone because they're a woman, or gay, or older in age, or a borderline kid. They don't segregate the people into their own little communities. It's a ""These are great people, watch them."" that doesn't separate people out based upon those characteristics.  Articles like the one linked here should seek to the same if they wish to help promote and lift these women up to the standards they want."
mindcrack,3dj8dr,Sadsharks,5,Fri Jul 17 09:32:00 2015 UTC,Aurey is one of my favourite Mindcrackers and its cool that she is feratured but these articles confuse me. Why single woman youtubers out as opposed to men. What is the difference. There all gamers.
mindcrack,3dj8dr,MidnightDNinja,34,Thu Jul 16 20:40:02 2015 UTC,"For the same reason you might make a list of all ""child-friendly"" Youtube Minecrafters.   If I had a 10 to 13-year-old niece that I was trying to get into gaming, this would be a perfect list to send her. Of course I would hope that eventually she would just be into gaming generally, and not care about the gender of the gamer she's watching. But if she thinks of gaming as a ""boy's thing"", this would be a great way to show her she's wrong and introduce her to the world in a way she can relate to."
mindcrack,3dj8dr,Sadsharks,20,Thu Jul 16 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this comment. A young girl might not be interested in other gamers because they are not representative of her interests.

mindcrack,3djk95,Compieuter,16,Thu Jul 16 20:02:30 2015 UTC,I am curious why they didn't bother unlocking the teleporter back to the first area. If their spawn point gets obstructed and they die they'll be stuck ...
mindcrack,3djk95,jaka100,12,Thu Jul 16 20:32:55 2015 UTC,I'm getting the feeling that they don't think far enough ahead.
mindcrack,3djk95,TranceRealistic,5,Thu Jul 16 21:32:00 2015 UTC,"There's a button to set spawn in the Nexus, before the next dangerous area. Hopefully they use it, and DON'T use beds again. You really don't need them (there are unlockable teleporters all over the map), and if you use a bed and it breaks or becomes blocked, you're out of luck, even if you pressed the button earlier."
mindcrack,3djk95,taschneide,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:47:38 2015 UTC,Do beds not set spawn in this map?
mindcrack,3djk95,98rman,5,Thu Jul 16 23:28:20 2015 UTC,"They do. That's the problem. If you used a bed, and didn't use the command block to set your spawn afterwards, then your spawn point will be the bed. If the bed gets blown up, your spawn point doesn't revert to your previous spawn point - it reverts to the world's spawn point, i.e. the start of the map. Using a bed overwrites the action of pressing the button."
mindcrack,3djk95,taschneide,3,Thu Jul 16 23:56:24 2015 UTC,Isn't the map supposed to be perma-day making beds unusable?

mindcrack,3djk95,Eraxon,7,Fri Jul 17 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"The only difference was that Pantheon and Monstrosity didn't restrict you from moving forward by a lava pillar you had to swim up, and they also had many instances of accidentally breaking their beds then dying in both of those."
mindcrack,3djk95,ManInTheHat,3,Fri Jul 17 00:31:01 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, kind of forgot they still have to enable the teleporter from the first area to the nexus... that would really suck then"

mindcrack,3djboe,fbecker,11,Thu Jul 16 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"Z, you can just connect pedestrian paths to the back of the train station, you don't need bridges and complicated paths to the front :)  And that traffic is probably because you don't have any industrial or offices in the Expansion. People have to work somewhere else in the city, and since it's not connected to the rest of the city in any way, they take the highway, creating traffic jams in that outbound highway you're having problems with, and jams in the central highway as they're going where they need to. Connect Expansion to the rest of the city by metro, and create a passenger train line from it to the city proper, and the traffic will clear out."
mindcrack,3djboe,Neamow,4,Thu Jul 16 20:31:24 2015 UTC,"That, combined with the traffic going and coming from the space elevator, which is usually massive."
mindcrack,3djboe,cambiro,5,Thu Jul 16 23:29:12 2015 UTC,"I was a bit confused by the reasoning that changing the merge from the right into a merge from the right of the other branch would fix the problem. The original hypothesis was that merging a highway into another from the right caused as much trouble as bringing them in in a Y shape, but that merging from the left caused minimal interruption. If he had actually done that, would it have worked?"
mindcrack,3djboe,Tringard,4,Thu Jul 16 20:07:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. The problem is that the only lane used in the highway is the left one, even before the merge, so merging from the left would still stop the people trying to get out of Expansion 1. Since people work at the other end of the map the game will put them in the left lane.   If the highway at Even Utopia-er or the Airport continue through the mountains and connect with the original highway it could help since there would be a more direct route to the main industry areas. Or public transport. A passenger train to work will help."
mindcrack,3djboe,Astur01,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:46:58 2015 UTC,"There's less traffic on the main highway than there is coming from Expansion, so I'd make the main highway merge into Expansion's outbound traffic  rather than the other way around.  It doesn't really make sense from a naive infrastructure point of view, but Expansion's outbound lane is already effectively the main highway out that way. Might as well make it official."
mindcrack,3djboe,lagomoof,3,Thu Jul 16 22:09:01 2015 UTC,"I bet when Zisteau clicks on some of the new traffic heading towards the expansion, he'll see they're trying to get to the space elevator."
mindcrack,3djboe,cthomlan,6,Thu Jul 16 21:14:45 2015 UTC,"Fix your game, Colossal Order! The situation with cars merging to one lane instead of distributing to all lanes and changing later on is not only lazy design but also totally unrealistic.

BTW, Wikipedia says the only ""Dili"" is in East Timor, not far from Australia but definitely outside it.  However, the Terror Site icon was clearly within Australia.

I've been saying for years that the game engine needs to be rewritten in an actual programming language, but Microsoft has a history of poor support for alternative operating systems (if they support them at all).  I hate to be pessimistic, but if they move from cross-platform/openGL to Direct X/Windows only I'm going to be very disappointed. Or worse, they could treat it like they do Office. There will be a Mac edition, but it will lag behind the Windows version in development by 4 years."

The definitely have the resources for this.  Although, I think the new version will probably get a Mod/Plugin API while the Java version will probably continue to let Forge/Sponge/Spigot do their thing.   Again, speculation, don't take any of this as fact."
mindcrack,3df732,lemonszz,4,Wed Jul 15 22:23:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like what I was saying about Office. All of the good development will go into the Windows only version and the Java version will lack certain features and lag behind with others. Probably no cross platform multiplayer, especially not modded multiplayer.  Words cannot express how badly this would suck. I hope we're wrong and Microsoft really isn't the same company I came to hate around 10 years ago."
mindcrack,3df732,justinh_tx,7,Wed Jul 15 22:48:48 2015 UTC,"I've been confused by everybody's speculation myself, because all the sources I've seen have the Windows 10 version of Minecraft is just a mobile version that works on Surface Pro/Mobile/Windows 10 PC, and they aren't changing the actual desktop version to C++ for a few years until they can get feature parity in the mobile versions. The team working on the Windows 10 Minecraft is a completely different team (based at the Redmond offices) than the Java version (Mojang), just like the Console team (4J Studios, Scotland) is different and the Mobile team (Mojang, separate devs, except for Jens).   The Java version will still be the main Minecraft version for Desktop (Windows/Linux/Mac) and whenever the mobiles can catch up with full feature parity (mods API, multiplayer compatibility with desktop, etc) will they all be merged into one version, which is several years down the line."
mindcrack,3df732,Kranis,2,Thu Jul 16 01:27:27 2015 UTC,"The way Guude is talking in the video submitted by OP, the Windows 10 version will be the ""this is Minecraft"" game... not a ""this is a special version of Minecraft"" (Pocket Edition for now). Maybe Guude is just speculating... I'll admit that I tend to just listen to Guude's videos in the background while I play a game or something, so maybe I didn't understand exactly what he was trying to say... but the speculation here in this thread is based on what Guude said in the video. He is in a fairly unique position to have some inside information... but that doesn't mean he actually knows something.  That's why I originally asked if anyone knew anything.

mindcrack,3dewju,RBR-NS_21,14,Wed Jul 15 19:00:26 2015 UTC,"maybe this might help: - the difference between the shown range of fire- and police-department etc. between before and after placing is caused by the fact that they didn't had electricity so the range is reduced till they get elec./water - schools go up the oneway road cause the school isn't coming to the ppl, the ppl have to be able to get to the school so the range is reversed  to reduce the amount of services you need for your new city-part you could try and place them at the exit of the city.  this way they could use the highway to loop around and get back into the city and use all oneway roads.  or maybe make a loop directly after the inner services that loops arount to the highway so they can also get to the other direction this way  hope this helps a bit - thx for the great content Z keep it up PS: #sry for #badenglish"

mindcrack,3dewju,ninja9011,8,Wed Jul 15 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"You have the right idea of splitting the incoming and outgoing traffic into different places in the city, but! You went too far in trying to remove all traffic lights. You see that in that underground mess. Traffic lights aren't inherently bad; if you use them in the right place, they will help you out. There is this gif that circulates quite frequently on /r/citiesskylines, and is by far the best example on how to handle huge amounts of traffic. As you can see, traffic lights help. A lot. This is exactly what you need for going out of Experimentalexpansionburgh.  There is also a mod called Traffic Manager, and it's really useful if you want more control over intersections. You can simply remove them from an intersection and assign which roads are main and secondary on an intersection (so that cars on secondary roads must yield), you can edit timings on intersections, you can plop down pedestrian crossings anywhere you want (I love this feature, it's actually the main reason I use this mod, and it'd be quite helpful if you're planning on making a pedestrian-centred city), change lanes...  And like /u/Diftor pointed out, educational buildings work differently - while other service buildings send cars out, people go to educational buildings, so their traffic line auras go in the opposite direction."

Also, if Dinnerbone will be participating, I think he should have a similar role to Arkas in UHC 20 where he'd join the first team to find him. Since he does have the insight on the 1.9 features, he'd be a very powerful asset and an interesting mechanic for one team to get that knowledge advantage.  So basically I'm hoping for a UHC season 20 repeat, just with Dinnerbone taking Arkas's role this time around. Maybe a teams of 3 to not be too similar to season 20?"

In many circumstances, it's so much more effective to just spam torches and ignore the actual spawners.  In these types of maps i go the extra mile and almost never destroy spawners, except for ones that can't be turned off with light of course. I'm basically a spawner horder (i might need a mob grinder RIGHT HERE later! you never know!), and even that looks a lot easier than their approach."

mindcrack,3db3o9,NobodySpecial999,2,Tue Jul 14 23:59:34 2015 UTC,Because it seems to be that people who watch youtube videos dont have an attention span that can handle longer videos.  Part of how your videos are rated by YT is Audience Retention - how much of your video they watch. This is one reason why the really big channels throw out 8-10 min vids.

Stop to think about a few things. How many people does that person subscribe to? How many new videos do those people put out a day? If you only have 10 minutes here and there to watch a video are you more likely to watch the 30 minute video someone put up, or the 5-10 minute video?

mindcrack,3db3o9,Lordborgman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:46:39 2015 UTC,"I liked when it would increase to 30 minutes after a certain number of players had died, but another option would be that after a certain number of episodes it would increase to 30 minutes.  Like for this season, in the beginning I watched more perspectives but by the end I had chosen one and wanted a longer episode so there was a greater chance of seeing progress or action.  If it only gets longer after a number of episodes then that could settle the need for filling content space."

mindcrack,3db3o9,Newrad1990,-1,Wed Jul 15 12:09:16 2015 UTC,they should just do a shrinking border to encourage action
mindcrack,3db3o9,solidgoldhead,2,Wed Jul 15 00:50:29 2015 UTC,"they did it. and while the Season was enjoyable, too much and I would consider not Watching UHC. I prefer organic action and not forced action. its more fun for the Mindcrackers that way and more fun for me that. way. Meetups can stay in /r/ultrahardcore games where they belong."
mindcrack,3db3o9,readonlypdf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:40:56 2015 UTC,"They did it in season 16 which I thoroughly enjoyed after the strange combat in season 15 with many of the teams hesitating to fight towards the end. I think any amount of more action is positive. I also enjoyed the better dungeons and awesome loot people accumulated this season but some of the episodes this season were a little drab because of this excessive caving , to which I think a shrinking border would have helped to discourage."
mindcrack,3db3o9,solidgoldhead,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:27:42 2015 UTC,Eh. I loved this season. Caving included. I've always thought of UHC as more a PvE game than a PvP game.   I loved Season 10 because of the epic gear people got. I haven't enjoyed the meetups that have happened in MindCrack UHC. Season 12 I can excuse because of the SuperOP mobs. Season 21 it just worked out that way. I just don't want a forced meetup. Also Shrinking Border while encouraging PvP also fucks teams that start on the edge over.

mindcrack,3da5k2,JamiroFan2000,2,Tue Jul 14 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"Alright, Pakratt. I do enjoy watching you play FTL. Really. But the game is balanced around the pause feature. By electing not to use it, you are handicapping yourself. I understand how it feels overpowered, I really do. But you can see in this episode how it would help to at least pause as soon as combat starts to see what is happening.  For example, when you start a fight and are immediately boarded by Mantis, you should not be focusing on the enemy ship. That is how your crewmember died, he was ganged up on before you realized there was that much danger. I'm not going to tell you how to play, whether you should have him leave the room, or bring reinforcements, or vent that section of the ship. But not doing any of these things because you don't have ample time to think it through is the only reason why you aren't winning every game you play.  Please try and pause? Maybe just for one run, see how it goes?"

mindcrack,3d6ffp,randomsnark,14,Tue Jul 14 00:33:33 2015 UTC,"I think he's been working on finding a balance where he can put in an effort without getting obnoxiously competitive. I think he's found it recently, where he was still pretty chill (and mentioned at one point this game about how he was consciously telling himself that it's just a game), but is still playing well.  It's sort of interesting how he's managed to approach that point while continually erring on the side of being too chill, without ever being too competitive like he worries about."
mindcrack,3d6ffp,wandering_ones,10,Tue Jul 14 04:49:02 2015 UTC,"I also felt Vechs antics were not as traumatic as some made it out to be. But in this season he even mentioned how he's chosen to not make any decisions and to defer to Nebris. I feel like this is partly due to how people have been responding to his gameplay in the past, but I hope he will let himself be a little free-er in the coming seasons (as his decisions aren't necessarily poor and his fun is our fun)."

Dinner at 6 and UHC at 6 makes me a little behind on updating. Anyways, let's get into this  Vechs (Team Breadcrumbs)  Vechs tells Nebris that the Reddit is going to yell at him for not making arrows. Once they near 0,0 they spot a player out in the distance ""diamond chestplate""  They guess that it's Pakratt. ""Our strategy changes slightly,"" says Nebris while they both shift behind dirt. They ready their weapons and begin the rush. They see that it isn't Pak, but OMGCheat OMGChad. Chad, seemingly noticing them coming from behind, starts lighting the ground on fire. He attempts to flee, but it only takes two attempts for Vechs to hit him with an arrow and kill him. ""Nice shot,"" Nebris congratulates. Nebris sorts through Dyslexic and Red Shirts' loot in a double chest, while Vechs stands lookout. Nebris complains about lag while putting on Chad's diamond boots and chestplate. He places an anvil for Vechs to make a power iv bow, but he cannot since he doesn't have enough levels. Instead, he makes a sharpness I fire aspect I diamond sword. Arkas and Baj start shooting at Breadcrumbs and they run to avoid the incoming arrows and Vechs eats his golden apple. Nebris makes one and Vechs hands him one. They realize that they only see one member of Grylls and worry about the other. Vechs suggests enderpearling, but Nebris says no. Grylls attacks from both directions. They try to charge one of them, but lose sight of him. Vechs fights while Nebris hides, then they trade so Vechs can eat his golden apple. A creeper explodes and Nebris takes a little bit of damage. Grylls regroups and Breadcrumbs ends up separate. Grylls attacks Vechs. Breadcrumbs quickly find each other. They retreat to the high ground and lose sight of Grylls. They go in search and theorize that Grylls is waiting for Vechs' absorption hearts to wear off. They chase Grylls up and down a tall hill and get more hits on Grylls before they retreat slightly. Vechs gets hit and eats his final apple. Vechs finally manages to shoot Arkas dead. After following Baj up a hill, Vechs shoots Baj dead in the same way Baj shot Pyro dead: bowspam. Karma sucks. ""We have to deal with Pakratt now."" ""The final boss fight."" Vechs sorts through the loot and picks up PauseUnpause SUCKS. Nebris gives appleless Vechs two of his three apples. Vechs suggests finding two more gold, but Nebris insists on fighting Pakratt. ""0,0 gl"" he types in the chat. ""u2"" Pak replies. They joke about being the demon slayers and fighting the rat of unusual size. THE ROUS. Vechs stays in the background as Nebris runs up to engage. He's got wolves! Nebris runs and pearls after being ignited by Pak. Pak engages with a sword and Vechs dies of fire damage caused by Pak's sword. Nebris somehow manages to shoot Pak dead winning for Breadcrumbs and winning his 5th UHC in a row. GG Nebris is killed off by Pak's wolves, making them the true winners. They decide to do an after-match recap with Pak, but I will not be summarizing that.  THE INCIDENT  It truly was disappointing. Nebris ran out of hard drive space four minutes into the final episode and the recording stopped. GG Breadcrumbs. Nice trolling.  Pakratt  Pak and his wolves head towards spawn. ""There's only one problem. I don't know where they are."" He nearly gets ninja creepered, but successfully knocks back the creeper. Still salty about his complete isolation for the entire duration of the UHC, he wonders where Chad was killed. He digs into a hill to look for where the players might be, and is frustrated that his dogs won't follow him. He decides to go towards the ice spikes. He sits his dogs and spots Breadcrumbs in the distance. He makes a crafting table and more arrows. He leaves his tunnel, but leaves his dogs sitting there! Oblivious as usual. He enters a cave and checks the loot of two pre-looted spawners to find nothing. He dumps his extra unneeded supplies into a chest and mines towards a lava sound. He attempts to collect a lava bucket from below a lava source, but is frustrated when he is unable. He returns to his wolves at night and complains about not wanting to take on a team alone unless there are good conditions and there are not good conditions. He expertly takes out a Skeleton just before Vechs kills Arkas. Once Baj is dead, Pak breeds another puppy after some frustrating sitting mechanics. Pak agrees to Nebris' 0,0 proposition and goes straight there. Nebris severely injures Pak before he eats his Notch apple and is frustrated when Nebris pearls forward a few blocks. ""That's not fighting, that's running. Your way of fighting is very odd."" Pak, Vechs, and a zombie engage in melee. The zombie dies quickly, and Pak is left with 2.5 hearts after killing Vechs. Pak rushes in with his sword, but Nebris is too good with a bow. Pak is dead. Stackedratt0013 has fallen. Our hero is gone. GG.  Baj (Team Grylls)  Baj spots Castle Pyro and decides to investigate. They quickly change their minds as Arkas warns of potential traps. After chilling in the ice spikes get it? chill! They move in towards 0,0. Upon closing in, they spot Breadcrumbs. Baj and Arkas split, and Baj eats an apple when he thinks they've spotted him. The bowfight ensues. They witness a creeper explode next to Nebris and are happy. Arkas is down, so they retreat to heal and get apples. They bonemeal some saplings, but cannot chop them before Breadcrumbs finds them. Arkas is killed by Vechs. Karma catches up to Baj, and Vechs bowspams Baj, killing him. GG  Chad (Team Dyslexic)  Chad continues sorting through the remains of the epic Dyslexic vs Red Shirts battle. He ignites the ground next to the stuff for some odd reason and runs away. He didn't even notice Breadcrumbs sneaking up and is easily one-shot by Vechs. GG.  Wrap-up  What a spectacular finish to a spectacular season. I'd say that would be one of my favorite final battles. Chad had no chance after the battle with Red Shirts. Grylls went down a lot more easily than I would have thought though. They only did minimal damage to Breadcrumbs. As said by Vechs, Pak would have been the winner of the season if the battle with Grylls didn't go as well. Nebris wins again! Thats five in a row now. Vechs has three, but when partnered with Nebris for three seasons in a row, does it truly count? That's for you to decide. GG guys. See you in a few months with UHC 22.   Season Overview  see reply"
mindcrack,3d6ffp,qngff,13,Mon Jul 13 22:41:30 2015 UTC,"Season Overview  Does Guardax do these? I'm going to do one anyways.  Duude Guude and Doc were both relatively low on health when they met, and I think that attributed to their early death against Dyslexic. They fought well though. Better health and they may have overcome the other disadvantage of lesser gear.  Pyro  Not going to find a teammate early on proved to be deadly for Pyro in the end. Baj's bowspam skills were on point and Pyro could not overcome them. Still, Castle Pyro proved to be a major part of the season. Congrats Pyro! You made an impact.  Beef  Probably the most exciting perspective, Beef, unlike Pyro, actually tried to find a partner, but had terrible luck. That's really the only bad luck he had though. Beef was spared by Chill, and barely escaped death at the hands of Breadcrumbs. Even better was his slow descent into madness. His ending was hilarious in my opinion. He attacks the team that spared him earlier, killing Avidya, but karma catches up and he Beefs because of JSano.  Chill  Jeff and Avidya, two of the calmest Mindcrackers when it comes to UHC. They were extremely kind in letting Beef go free, but it bit them in the butt when Beef killed Avidya. JSano managed to avenge his death though, by killing Beef before being shot by BTC.  Girl Scouts  This was my favorite team of the season. Pause and Aurey's commentary was just amazing for me. I really want a Girl Scouts collab series. Sadly, their lack of diamonds for enchanting and Pause's impatience spelled certain doom for them. Aurey's death against Chad is somewhat her own fault with her not paying attention, but the three gapples from spawners and her improving skill are going to make her a fierce competitor next season. Pause, however was pretty much doomed after Aurey's death. It took a while, but Anderz eventually found and slayed him.  Red Shirts  Season 12 winners reunited. Seth was pretty careless in PvE this season much to BTC's frustration. They put up a good fight against Dyslexic. I can't decide if this or Breadcrumbs vs Stackedratt is my favorite of the season. Anderz did heavy damage to both of them with his lava bucket, and when they killed him, Chad came in for the clean-up.  Dyslexic  This was a karma filled season. Anderz said he didn't want to team with Chad, and he was. GG. Truth about Chad is, he still isn't a great fighter. Anderz did most of the work on Duude and Red Shirts. Chad cleaned up. Even Aurey isn't proof. She wasn't paying attention and she put up no fight. His cheating caught up to him and the Reddit can rest peacefully knowing OMGCheat's stripmine did not win UHC.  Grylls  I always preferred Guinness, but whatever. Our two intro makers paired up! Both of them provided laid back commentary, and some fun times with the farms. Dang people got enchanted this UHC. Congrats to Baj on his one kill against Pyro, but as karma would have it, the way he killed Pyro was the way he was slain. Honestly though, they could have put up more of a fight against Breadcrumbs.  Pakratt  Amazing turn around from being known as the first death every season guy. Also congrats on your first kill! Still, even though Stackedratt had a Notch apple, insane sword, bow, and armor, and wolves, Nebris was just too powerful. Amazing run.  Breadcrumbs  Another UHC another win for Nebris. 5 in a row what a feat! Despite not seeing Beef or Girl Scouts, they still got a collective four kills on Chad, Baj, Arkas, and Pak. Expertly played by our expert. I just can't wait until he pulls a Vechs and uses punches out a gravel platform in the nether. I'm calling that right now. Still, Vechs played excellently, redeeming himself and scoring a third win in a row.   I hope I've been a good recapper in Guardax's absence. He will be back very soon, and I shall be returning the Recap Torch to him. It's been fun guys. See you next UHC :)"

Anderz was fighting a god because he had no idea what he was getting himself into. He could easily have fled had he suspected it would have helped.  Furthermore, had Pak not gotten that achievement (by doing what seth and others do), he might have surprised Nebris and won.  The achievements also effect how players react to the nether, and often people misread them or ignore them, which in general creates an uneven playing field. In some cases the achievements are positive (e.g. helping find team members by going to the nether). Competitors shouldn't have to decide their strategy in the first few seconds, especially when unforeseen factors (such as meeting a team member or getting a portal early) are such a major element of the play."

To add on to that the city has a giant wall around it and 3 rings, the outer ring - horrible place where the poor people live, the middle ring where people live decently and the upper ring where the royalty's at."
mindcrack,3d6fub,O_xD,6,Tue Jul 14 14:14:53 2015 UTC,"I asked about the house too. I probably asked about it in a way no one else did though.  Gosh it was nice to see Oxeye again. I've missed it. Beef, you sounded a little congested, but it was the same Beefy voice we all know and love.   How about blocking off the smaller ring (or half of it) next to the center of Oxeye and have the villagers run around there? It would be less space to have to light up. It would be easier to round them up later too."

By the way, a short suggestion: Once you defeat the Heart of Cthulu, make another world with Corruption in it. You'll want it for another expert mode boss fight with gear you are expected to have at that level, things from floating islands like the Shiny Red Balloon (Of which you could use at least three for material per person), and for getting some items from the Hardmode Corruption."

mindcrack,3d5riw,fbecker,20,Mon Jul 13 19:11:33 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure all the tax relief policies were what was tanking the city, not Suck. You have to live off of something, and giving tax relief to half of your city will make you lose a ton of money. You not only stop getting the tax revenue, the policy itself has an upkeep as well, so you really lose a ton of money. Suck is empty, there are no service buildings creating upkeep, it is not responsible for your lowered profits.  The population loss might be your first encounter with a death wave. Those happen periodically for some reason, there's a lot of discussion on them, why they happen, and it's probably because cims age and die at similar intervals, so when a lot of people move in a newly zoned area, they will eventually die off at roughly the same time in a big wave.

The recap was sorely missing more pranks. Those were just classic. If you're interested in living season 3, watch Beef's Prank Wars playlist. I highly recommend it. You won't regret it. Even I go back to it now and again to relive everything.  My favorite pranks include: the vining, candyland, mushroom sky (birthed KoTL), spidercube, etho's potion prank on anderz (not in the playlist), putting paintings in Zisteau's starter base, guude's spawn town house, and so many more. Be sure to watch the pranker's perspective, as well, especially for spidercube."

It's a neat little trick to get to the ball first at the start or used like Pyro did to get across the field really quickly to set up blocks. You can also use it to jump sideways or backwards for a ""bicycle"" kick. Rocket League is pretty damn fun. Just picked it up today and can't recommend it enough. Totally worth 20 bucks."

He built his way up to the CEO from doing what a regular worker did: program and make the games. So many series here wouldn't exist without his help. He assisted in the Pokemon series (Pyro). He assisted in Super Mario (Seth). He helped out with the earlier Mario Karts which inevitably led to Mario Kart 8 (Guude, Beef, Chad, Pause, Coe, Millbee, and MC). He helped in Super Smash Bros. (Guude, Millbee, MC, Coe). He produced many of the Zelda series (MC * 9001). And these are only the games and associated Mindcrackers that I can name off the top of my head.    There are many Nintendo games that Iwata helped with early on before even being part of Nintendo. He was a main developer in the Kirby, Earthbound, and Zelda series. He was the one responsible for compressing the code for Pokemon Gold and Silver to the point where the Kanto Region could be added. He was the one who debugged Super Smash Bros. Melee so that it could be released on time, and that was while he was president.    This man is a very honourable man, cutting half of his paycheck so that no workers had to be laid off. Without him, a good amount of Mindcrack content would not have existed. So please understand, but I believe I can say that on behalf of the Mindcrack community, thank you Mr. Iwata."

Baj has a family history of heart problems and had the classic signs of a heart attack (Pain and tingling in arm, sweating, and tightness in the chest) and Jeff said to go to the doctor. Baj was hesitant. He took an aspirin and tracked down the Minecon Medic, who said that his blood pressure and heart rate were elevated and he should go to the hospital to be safe. Again, Baj was hesitant but decided to do it. They called an ambulance and he went to the hospital. The EKGs and blood tests came back negative. He did not have a cardiac episode. He had a follow up and everything came up clear again. Best they can figure he had a pinched nerve.  TL;DR: Baj is fine, he had a heart attack scare."

However I do have what might be a controversial opinion about episode summaries in this subreddit, understanding that you yourself didn't summarize the entire episode, rather a particularly interesting story that might be better understood from the badger's mouth. That's why folks like Chad do recaps and not summaries, so that it may incentivize people to go watch the videos. Highlights are cool, and even timestamps to those highlights. That's how I did Kurt's Far Lands or Bust recaps back in the day. Your TL;DR ""Baj is fine"" is certainly appreciated, but editing down a story that Baj himself worked hard to edit himself was a little unfortunate.  Also an FYI for those who may not know, now that Youtube uses the HTML5 player across most browsers, there's a setting that lets you watch videos at 1.25 speed.

With no means of healing up, Chad is a sitting duck. He’ll be shot at by Breadcrumbs from the back, causing him to run away, only to end up right in front of Grylls. Chad was one-shot by Baj, alerting Breadcrumbs of their presence. Meanwhile Pak closes in, ending up somewhere to the side in between the two teams near 0,0.   Breadcrumbs and Grylls exchange some arrow fire and take some damage, but spot Pakratt to the side and decide to prioritize him to try and get the Notch Apple. Nebris foolishly enderpeals to him, but is obstructed by the dogs getting in the way and is killed by a stacked Pak. Vechs is now alone and shot shortly after. Pak charges a wounded Grylls with his Notch Apple and sweeps the battlefield clean.   It is the only way."

I am trying to work in the ""worse fuck up"" that Nebris prophesized.  Pakratt sneaks up on baj and Arkas, uses his apple, and kills both of them. He is left without the thing that made him as much of a threat as he is, but with his gear plus barkajs he still stands a chance.  Chad decides to go caving, but on his way to find a cave he spots vechs and Nebris. He hides and they pass him, but he starts to dig too soon, and they hear him. They run around trying to find them and chad soon starts shooting. He hits them once but they kill him.   While they are sorting through the loot, Pakratt sneaks up on them and gets Nebris low. Vechs tries to save him and lavas Pakratt. He does a bad job and gets all three of them. Nebris ender pearls out, but dies of fire. Vechs and Pakratt stay in the lava hitting eachother. Pakratt kills vechs, and gets rid of the lava, ending the game with half a heart.     Alternatively, chad decides to hide in the tower. He shoots Arkas and baj a few times before they kill him. While they look through chads loot, Pakratt comes and shoots at them. He knocks Arkas off the cliff, and baj goes down to grab whatever he can before running. Pakratt thinks he is still up on the mountain waiting him out, and keeps shooting until he notices baj running. He then begins chasing baj.  Baj runs into vechs and Nebris, and automatically starts running to one of his sides because he is surrounded. Nebris sees him and tries to point him out to vechs, but vechs cannot figure out where he is. Nebris gives up and starts running after baj. Vechs thinks he sees baj, and convinces Nebris that he is going the wrong way. They start running at Pakratt instead.  Baj is hiding behind something hoping that Nebris doesn't see him, and is thrilled when he sees Nebris turn the other way. He then starts chasing Nebris.  Pakratt sees 3 people running at him. He assumes that baj has amazing gear because he thinks vechs and Nebris are running from him. He eats his apple and runs at them.   Vechs and Nebris realize that it is Pakratt in the distance, and they start retreating in hopes of baiting out the apples countdown.   While chasing them, baj notices that they have turned around. He digs down two blocks so that he can get the advantage of being behind them. Vechs sees this, and decides to lava him. He creeps up on him and right before he places the lava baj jumps up and hits him one time. Vechs is suprised and places the lava anyways, accidentally on himself.  He quickly picks the lava up, and Nebris waters him. Pakratt catches up, and hits Nebris, who baj quickly hits back. Vechs attacks Pakratt, and gets one hit on him, and enough accident hits on Nebris to kill him. He then tries to lava Pakratt, but it does no damage due to the fire resistance. Pak doesn't bother getting rid of it, not realizing that it is slowing him down. Baj gets out of his hole to ambush pak but is killed. Vechs starts shooting at Pakratt and the favor is returned. Vechs gets quite a few lucky shots on Pakratt, which makes Pakratt decide to sword rush him. Vechs gets a few more shots while Pakratt is on his way, and then kills him with a sword."

Going back down for health will not occur to him, and he will quickly be killed by the first people to see him (I would guess Breadcrumbs).    After that, I'm guessing it's gonna end up being a three-way battle between Breadcrumbs, Grylls and the WolfPak. They are all converging on 0,0 at about the same time. Grylls and Pak will likely see each other first. Pak, being a pretty good bow shot, will be able to keep Grylls at bay; but he knows that he needs to save his apple for the final battle, and there is another team.    After the players shuffle around a bit, Breadcrumbs and Grylls start exchanging bow fire. Breadcrumbs' apples keep them healthier longer than Grylls and when Grylls is finally low the two teams converge. Grylls' weapons do a lot of damage to Breadcrumbs, but they are overcome due to not having as much health.    Pak sees that Grylls is defeated, and charges in, eating his Notch Apple when he is close enough to start swinging at them. Nebris and Vechs eat their remaining apples and begin fleeing from the godly Pak. Unfortunately, they are forced to go uphill. Nebris uses his enderpearl to successfully escape from Pakratt, the absorption from the apple taking the hit for him. Vechs however, couldn't get away quickly enough. Pak catches him and kills him.    With the effects of his Notch apple now over, Pak is at full (possibly with one or two of his dogs dead) and Nebris is down a few hearts. The two exchange bow fire, neither making much headway on the other. It becomes a first screwup loses situation as neither are particularly healthy anymore and both lack apples to heal. Finally, after the two move more towards the snowy plains, they attempt to charge each other. Nebris stops halfway though and arrow spams Pak to death. Breadcrumbs wins.    To be honest, I don't really want them to win because they win all the time. I think that realistically however they stand the best chance. I would love for Pak to win solo, or for Chad to come back (maybe by finding Jsano's lost apple), but I think Pak is a longshot and Chad even more so.    Grylls actually stands a very good chance of winning. The only reason I think Breadcrumbs will beat them is because it will probably be a bow battle and Breadcrumbs has more apples (those power IV bows will hurt though). They are the most realistic option to dethrone Nebris and Vechs, and they could very well do it, but my money is on Breadcrumbs."

Nebris realizes what happens first and gets a hit or two on Arkas, but ultimately dies. Meanwhile, Vechs is being shot by Pak, but he is able to get away. A battle between Pak and Barkas ensues. Pak eats his notch apple, but it ends up being too early as Barkas is able to keep him away with their bows. Pak is able to finish Arkas, but Baj kills Pak.

Nebs and Vechs try to rush Pak to kill him before he can eat the apple (Nebs agreeing to this because he doesn't want to juts come in and clean up). Pak eats the apple and kills Vechs, whilst Nebs tries to pearl away - but gets very little distance on it. He manages to hold off Pak briefly with bow spam, but not long enough and gets slain whilst dealing with Pak's wolves.  Guinness see that it's now them against Pak, so they make their way towards 0,0 by which time the effects of the Notch Apple have worn off. Between the two of them, they successfully defeat Pakratt and are crowned champions... making Arkas a real UHC master."

Chad at near death will most likely die after one bow hit from Baj or Arkas. They wont take as much time sorting gear because Chad pretty much did it for them. Breadcrumbs arrive soon and after a few arrows from both sides, Arkas gets a jumpy and nervous as he was last episode and insists they find more cover. They move to the ice spikes and continue to exchange arrows with breadcrumbs. Pak arrives from behind Breadcrumbs and exchange a few hits, but Pak eats his apple just in time and manages to off Vechs. Nebris enderpearls away from Pak immediately but the pearl takes him straight to Grylls, and is finished off by ""Pauseunpause SUCKS"". Pak charges into the spikes as his regeneration runs out, and engages Grylls. Grylls battle with pyro is repeated as Pak chases and is distracted by one of them while the other shaves off bits of Pak's health with his bow, eventually finishing him off."

When people know you have a Notch Apple, it basically renders it useless because they will just run away as soon as you eat it and come back to kill you when the effects have run out. I've seen this happen to Nebris on PMC multiple times. The element of surprise is paramount, and Pak unfortunately lost it when the achievement popped."

Afterwards pakratt and baj and arkas converge on breadcrumbs position. I believe the ""big"" fuck up isn't actually detrimental but it does lead to the death of vechs or nebris .Nebris/vechs survives arkas/baj but pakratt is coming in full notch apple.  Twist: the last man standing from the battle picked up nebris' ender pearl (trumping the notch apple as I believe is shown in vechs' thumbnail as the notch apple is slowly being overtaken by an ender pearl) this allows that person to escape, regroup, and eventually win. I assume the last man standing to be vechs."

mindcrack,3d21pb,SabrielandOJ,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:49:13 2015 UTC,"Most likely encounters:  Pakratt vs Baj/Arkas.  They are moving perpendicular to each other (and the latter pair directly toward Chad) but equidistant to the '0,0' hill and both decent odds to divert in that direction.  I think that they will, and that will be the first encounter of the episode.  Don't ask me how it will end, but Pakratt will have to use his Notch apple here, or die.  Breadcrumbs are furthest from center and heading vaguely in the direction of Chad; it's somewhat likely they'll spot him along the way.  If they do, he dies.  So the most logical end battle is the winner of Pakratt/Arkas/Baj (very likely to be badly hurt if it's Arkas and Baj) vs a fullish-health Nebris/Vechs for all the marbles.  Which should favor Nebris and Vechs, just based on geometry.  However, everyone's so close that battles could overlap or people could head in directions other than those I expect and work out differently."
mindcrack,3d21pb,parryowd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:29:30 2015 UTC,"Breadcrumbs wins, due to a well executed enderpearl throw (hence Vechs' thumbnail).  Nebris has hinted at a big ""Fuck-up"" later in the season, yet he has said we are going to be disappointed, which I presume means that the ""Fuck-up"" is by Pakratt who fails to eat his notch apple before going into battle, causing him to die without getting any kills, disappointing most of us."
mindcrack,3d21pb,laurensho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:43:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think Chad's going to last long, maybe just long enough to get a couple bow hits on however attacks him.  He's not going to want to cave this late in the season (hopefully, that would be a bad choice) so the best he can really hope for is one kill if he sneak attack a team.  There's no way to know what order everyone else will meet up so I've got predictions for every scenario.  If it comes down to a three way battle I think Grylls will win because they'll back out (as they did against girl scouts and dyslexia).  Pak and breadcrumbs will basically eliminate each other leaving grylls to clean up.  If Grylls and Breadcrumbs fight I think breadcrumbs will win because they have the health advantage and skill advantage.  Their gear is pretty comparable.  The power 4 bow won't deal 4 hearts against projectile/prot 2 armour and everything else is mostly the same.  On the other hand, Breadcrumbs might not put in 100% because they've won so many times already.  A battle between Pak and breadcrumbs would come down to whether Breadcrumbs know he's there.  Pak can win if he sneaks up and eats his apple just before attacking, otherwise I think they'd know to wait out the regen and their numbers would overwhelm his gear.  It would be a very close battle though and they'd definitely want it to be after they fight Grylls to win.  I can't remember if Grylls know Pak has the notch apple/what exactly it does.  If they do I don't know if they would think to wait out the regen.  Pak would either win this battle or it would go the same was as the Breadcrumbs fight.  If a team fights Pak before the other team (and assuming Pak uses his apple properly) the other team is basically guaranteed to win.  Also I think we're very likely to see the overkill achievement this episode with how well geared the teams are."

He finds 3 enderman and gets 3 pearls, 2 apples, and enough gold for the 2 apples by episode's end.  Team Breadcrumbs and Team Barkas make their way to 0,0 toward the end of the episode. Breadcrumbs decides to camp in another cave close to 0,0. Baj picks up a golden apple on the ground that was left after the last fight. There is no action first 2/3 of episode.  Team Barkas come upon Chad and doesn't notice Pakratt hiding behind the hill.

This is a term the nazis used for propaganda, saying our soldiers are as tough as Krupp Steel. I was wondering, how people would react to this. And sadly, what I expected happenend. People quickly brought out extremly nationalist opinions ranging from: MY COUNTRY CAN MOVE WHOLE CITIES AROUND"" to ""WE DO THIS ON A DAILY BASIS HERE IN AMERICA, NOTHING SPECIAL"" or ""WE GERMANS ARE THE BEST"".  This is a art, the house is made from cardboard.   I strongly hope, when people actually understand, that this is completely fake, and my talk about the amazing german engineering is complete bogus, they will start to think a bit before they start going on nationalist rants praising the ""amazing achievements of their glorius countries"". Countries/nations are just lines in the sand. Everything cool in the worls is made by the people, not by nations. Maybe one day, we will overcome this, but it is a long way still. Especially considering that youtube is a media mainly used by young people, the results of this little experiment are quite shocking."
mindcrack,3d103p,docm77,4,Sun Jul 12 18:51:57 2015 UTC,It actually is possible.
mindcrack,3d103p,hugefieryshit,16,Sun Jul 12 18:56:59 2015 UTC,This is obviously something completely different. Also notice the massive steel beams bellow the house providing stability. You cannot lift a stone house like you see in my video with a mini crane and the hooks attached to the roof.

mindcrack,3d103p,WintersLocke,6,Sun Jul 12 19:02:45 2015 UTC,"House moving like that is pretty common in the US or for example Australia. How they do it, is digging out under the house and using support beams to hold the house in place. Then they roll in with the flatbed and slowly lower the house down and then drive out. You cannot hook such a massive house on a crane without any sort of support. Also the weight of a stone house by far surpasses the weight of a wood house like you see on this picture. So, my statement is 100% correct and it makes zero sense to try to be sarcastic. ""Dank meme"" ends here;-)"
mindcrack,3d103p,docm77,2,Sun Jul 12 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I stand corrected Doc excuse my sarcasm, no disrespect intended. I actually knew about this already as I've done it before with a log cabin, but once you get the house about a foot or so off the ground or even dug out underneath you simply crank it up one corner at a time or altogether depending on what method you're using, so you really dont need to constantly lift up the house as a whole using support beams generally, especially if its sort of a smaller house like shown in your video. I simply thought you may have been suggesting that it would be impossible to do it with a crane perhaps."
mindcrack,3d103p,WintersLocke,2,Sun Jul 12 19:16:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the point is I wondered how people would react to my nationalist rant in the video about something that obviously is complete bogus.

That's an incredible naive view. Countries are much more than lines in the sand, they are its people and culture, and people don't live in a void but in a given country that will influence what they can possible do/achieve. Germany is indeed one of the countries that helps advance mankind the most and one of the best for a person to realize its full potential, there's no issue in being moderately proud of it and to deny how great Germany is denounces a lack of understanding of how shit most of the world is.  That kind of cultural relativism is a disservice to all those who live in shitty countries and work to make them better. We can analyse a country based on many factors and come to a conclusion on how good it is, Germany is overall a pretty good one and should act as an example to many others, and I say this as a Portuguese which is still an overall fine country, but not as good as yours.   Especially considering that youtube is a media mainly used by young people, the results of this little experiment are quite shocking.   We've had decades of hippie one world utopian dreams, the pendulum is now swinging back towards a more realistic world view."
mindcrack,3d103p,tugasnake,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:37:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree here a bit: What gives people an identity is not being German or any other Nationality. It works on a way more local level. People for example identify themselves by their family or their village, maybe their region. For example I am proud to be born in Ulm, where Albert Einstein was born or where we have the biggest church tower in the World, the Ulmer Münster. Germany is huge, we have Bavarians, Prussians and many more cultural groups. They all differ a lot. So sure, people say I am German, but in reality the talk about their home, their birthplace or where they lived for a long time within Germany. It wouldn't matter to them, if Bavaria was part of Austria or Swiss today.  That is also a big problem with the European Union. Identity is always defined locally, not on a big scale like, I am German or even I am European.  National pride is a political idea, it is not natural for humans. Especially in Germany, we learned how stupid the idea of national pride is. Hitler and his system was proving to us first hand, what it means to believe in such an idea: We are such a great nation, let's show the rest of the world that we are superior to them.  In Germany, we don't like to brag about our ""great nation"", we feel hat we are just extremly lucky that we are located in the middle of europe, in perfect climate with almost no natural disasters. Germany`s economical success doesn't come  from national pride, it comes from the people who learned that it is best to work hard and be in peace.  If you look at the hiostory of Portugal, it was one of the most powerful nations in the past because of geographical reasons. Having a huge fleet and conquering/colonizing the world made it rich and powerful. But also you saw, that this idea didn't work. You couldn't just sail let's say to South America, conquer the natives there and tell them, ok, now you are all Portuguese. That applies to all nations who had many colonies.   National pride/nationalism is a very stupid idea. It led to nothing but war and death, in extreme cases like the holocaust, it lead to unbelieveable crimes like killing millions on an industrial level.   So yeah, you maybe can be proud of a nation, but I don't think a human being is made to think in such a grand scale. It leads to forgetting about the basics of humanity and morals."
mindcrack,3d103p,docm77,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:56:45 2015 UTC,"Yes there are different regions in Germany and you may feel more attached to yours than to the country as a whole, but in the end every region speaks the same language, cheers for the same country in international competitions and is led by the same federal government. There is a lot that unites you all into a greater entity.   Identity is always defined locally, not on a big scale like   It depends on the person, some people will identify themselves based on their region, some based on their country and a growing number now identify themselves as members of the EU. Either way being a Bavarian, a German and an European is not mutually exclusive.   National pride is a political idea, it is not natural for humans.   It depends, humans are tribal animals so national pride can be perfectly natural if that's what you identify as your group. In Portugal national pride is perfectly natural because we're an old country that has stayed virtually the same for centuries, Germany itself is a more recent phenomenon born out of a confederation of states, but even then I would say that there's more than enough history and culture uniting you all to allow for there to be national pride.   Especially in Germany, we learned how stupid the idea of national pride is. Hitler and his system was proving to us first hand, what it means to believe in such an idea: We are such a great nation, let's show the rest of the world that we are superior to them.   Every country involved in WWII was nationalist, the problem with Germany wasn't the fact that you were nationalist but that you put in power a man who thought going to war against most of Europe was a good idea amongst other terrible ideas.  Switzerland is probably one of the most nationalist countries in Europe today, they're made of cantons that are ethnically and linguistically distinct from each other but that share a common thread that unites them as a nation. Despite being a nationalist country they've done a great job at avoiding every war in Europe for the past 200 years.   In Germany, we don't like to brag about our ""great nation"", we feel hat we are just extremly lucky that we are located in the middle of europe, in perfect climate with almost no natural disasters. Germany`s economical success doesn't come from national pride, it comes from the people who learned that it is best to work hard and be in peace.   I never said anything about bragging, I mentioned that there was no issue in being moderately proud of your country since it is objectively a great nation. Nor did I say that the success of Germany comes from national pride. Your success does owe a good deal to German culture though.   If you look at the hiostory of Portugal, it was one of the most powerful nations in the past because of geographical reasons. Having a huge fleet and conquering/colonizing the world made it rich and powerful. But also you saw, that this idea didn't work. You couldn't just sail let's say to South America, conquer the natives there and tell them, ok, now you are all Portuguese. That applies to all nations who had many colonies.    Our geographic position certainly helped us become such a great power back then, but many other factors were more relevant such as having good leadership and a united country made of faithful and patriotic men with an enterprising mind.  Only faith and patriotism can explain why 140 men over a year away from their country and people can stay strong and fight against a force of tens of thousands.  In all great civilizations there's is a strong sense of duty and patriotism, lack of patriotism is more often than not a sign of decline.  Every empire eventually crumbles, we may be just a tiny rectangle now with a couple of archipelagos but what we did while we were a world power matters. We succeeded in uniting the world and spreading western civilization to many places that were devoid of it. Those South American natives may not be Portuguese but they do speak Portuguese and live in a western country founded by us.  Even in the end of our empire the only force that could bring us down was our own. We were fighting guerrillas supported by the USSR and some by the USA in Africa and winning, we only lost it because the Soviets realized that they wouldn't achieve a military victory so they decided to instead defeat us from within by instigating a coup in Portugal.   National pride/nationalism is a very stupid idea. It led to nothing but war and death, in extreme cases like the holocaust, it lead to unbelieveable crimes like killing millions on an industrial level.    Nationalism doesn't necessarily lead to war or genocides, neither is it a required condition for both of those things happening.   So yeah, you maybe can be proud of a nation, but I don't think a human being is made to think in such a grand scale. It leads to forgetting about the basics of humanity and morals.   I disagree, it's perfectly healthy for a human being to take pride in his country, I find the opposite to be far more unnatural. The world is a ruthless place and a people that does not love itself is just setting itself up to be conquered by one who does."

On the other hand JSano has both Spelunky and FTL series and his commentary is always entertaining. You'd have to browse the other mindcrackers to see if they have either or both.
mindcrack,3d1n2j,BluebellP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:34:42 2015 UTC,More Pak: I've watched Jeff's FTL/Spelunkey already. Streams are hard for me to catch. The problem is I'm not sure which series to try.
mindcrack,3d1n2j,NedryOS,2,Wed Jul 15 22:41:09 2015 UTC,"I think if you like Pak's Oblivious Gamer style, you will like most of his other series. As with most people I follow,  I can't watch every single video, but like I said, Pak is pretty consistent. If you like one video, odds are you will like the next. He is openly ""oblivious"", which basically means he does not have the time or energy to dive deep into the mechanics of various games. Thus makes him very... I guess approachable would be a good word, as an average gamer. He is not super obsessed with one fandom or one game and it's mechanics. He's not a speed runner like Seth or MC nor does he know in depth the mechanics like say Direwolf20 would. Honestly, any series at all would probably be alright to at least try."

mindcrack,3d1n2j,bright_2,2,Tue Jul 14 20:09:11 2015 UTC,They havent made any videos due to a lack of interest in Minecraft in Nebs' case and because Z wanted to do single player content and probably doesnt want two Minecraft LP's on the go at once - especially since when he was doing Mindcrack videos it was basically SSP anyway.

mindcrack,3d1n2j,NedryOS,10,Mon Jul 13 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"Psj is no longer a mindcracker, so while he's still whitelisted, he's been doing stuff away from minecraft for the last few months, though he did have a few minecraft episodes with some of the hermitcraft guys. The likelihood of seeing him on the Mindcrack Vanilla server is next to none.   Pak has a job outside of entertainment and doesn't spend a lot of time off camera on projects. Usually he is streaming, and has been on PlayMindCrack frequently, including UHCs. If there is a large group on when he is available, he will likely join, but it seems to me like he will prioritize streaming over the server content. I personally think that's great because it offers a way for us to directly interact with him.  MC has had a lot of irl stuff going on recently, especially zeldathon. He's a pretty busy guy. Most of his channel, at least that I recall, is Nintendo recently, but I haven't heard him say anything about quitting minecraft entirely, so you'd have to ask him directly.  Bdubs, Genny, thejims, and Etho also left with psj because (paraphrasing and in general) they felt continuing the business aspects of Mindcrack was not beneficial to them. As of last I knew, they are still friends of Mindcrack and the members, and are still whitelisted and allowed on the server.  Additionally, as a long time friend and former member, Shreeyam has recently started playing again on the vanilla server."

He obtained the status of a cheater in season 2 when he managed to harvest a large number of Music Discs and abused the piston duplication glitch to duplicate diamonds.[13][14] Guude has called him a cheater ever since. In the early days of season 3, when he was the town planner for the spawn village, he had set out strict building codes for the small plots people had. Nebris chose the largest plot of the village and built a large house on it.[15] Many of his actions confirm his status as the villain and a cheater, including harvesting vast amounts of accessible Glowstones near people's portals for his underground fortress.[16]"""

When team Pimp came through at 4 hearts each against a team with twice their health and won the game, it was the greatest ending to a mindcrack uhc ever. even though season 11 and 13 are good, people like season 13 for Rob, and people liked season 11 until the ending where the final battle lasted about 3 seconds.

mindcrack,3d0hlt,Dannflor,2,Sun Jul 12 23:09:17 2015 UTC,"Season 11. I mean, come on, it plays out like this awesome thriller story.  Bdubs, surviving with half a heart, stumbles upon potions in an incredibly lucky chance, and suddenly becomes the most powerful person in the game.  Etho finds the remains of the event, finding a potion that Bdubs forgot, which later allows him to kill Bdubs. He also deduces that Bdubs is the one with the potions.  Guude has 100 freaking dogs.  Zisteau has an amazing fort at spawn.  Everyone else is very well equipped.  Amazing battles go down at spawn. The legendary battle of Etho and Bdubs is my favourite fight in UHC history. Plus, the underdog wins in the end, which is always a plus."

mindcrack,3d0hlt,Dannflor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:12:58 2015 UTC,I thought was cool. Etho got too cocky/over confident. He thought the potions would carry him to victory but didn't think BTC could have some of his own. To each their own though.
mindcrack,3d0hlt,EonKayoh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:21:09 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with BTC winning - I was rooting for him in s19.  What I hated about the way he won was that he spent like an hour trying to get a skeleton farm working, and after 2+ hours into the game, he decided to go to the nether for potions, which he was doing while EVERYONE ELSE was having what should have been the final battle.  He even ended up outside the border, and had to get back in, and it all just dragged the game out and he had a massive advantage due to not having any kind of other prior pvp interactions while Etho had just been through at least 2 consecutive pvp battles."

The teams were extremely well suited to eachother despite being randomly generated.  Plus im not going to complain about a 5 hour UHC if its well paced. Plus 30 minute episodes help.

It was Poetry in Motion and was so satisfying. 12 - For some weird reason the glitchiness of the season made it even more tense and more enjoyable to watch. 14 - even though this season was a run-a-way, it was still entertaining to see Pause and Arkas trash-talk everyone else. I personally preferred this season over 13, which frankly had similar results :P"

My favorite is probably 13, for the same reasons as probably most everyone.    This current season is gonna be a contender though, I know there were a lot of actionless episodes for some people, but honestly you could go to any perspective during any part and find something entertaining. Pretty much every team is providing great commentary together (Arkas and Baj seem to butt heads sometimes, but not in a way that takes anything away from it), and the singles don't really lack too much for being alone either. Some great battles to boot.    The only thing that would disappoint me in this season would be (honestly, as much as I like them) if Nebris and Vechs won again.:p"

Auery like Seth & BTC got surprised, only thing she could have done is have been more observational or have quicker reactions times after the first hit.  Anderz died making sure his team won the fight, a very Anderz like way to go about it.  Avidya was complaining an awful lot as he died but I don't see what about, Beef was close enough to hit him & finished him off while he was eating.  Beef run out of food at the wrong moment, maybe that golden apple in his inventory could have helped him with that. He was too busy with Avidya to notice the Jsano flank.

If he has no luck caving, he should just keep caving instead of trying to hunt without enchants. Honestly, there are no scenarios in which hunting without enchants is a good idea. Unless you get really lucky, the only people you can kill are people who also don't have enchants, so what can you possibly gain?

mindcrack,3cycad,ceoadmiral,52,Sat Jul 11 22:43:09 2015 UTC,"UHC Episode 7 is upon us and that means another round of recaps, but wait! I'm not Guardax! Well, He's on vacation and has allowed me to take over recapping duties for the next two episodes until he returns. So let's dive straight in  Pause (Team Girl Scouts)  Pause and Aurey follow Team Chill, but they run away before any battle can ensue. They climb a hill near 0,0 to try to find them, but to no avail. Arkas then messages Pause ""Where are you Pause"" He reveals he is at 0,0 ""Fight me m8"" Arkas replies. Team Grylls emerges from the trees and a bow fight ensues. Aurey distracts them while Pause tries to sneak attack them. Suddenly, Chad appears behind Aurey out of nowhere and knocks her off a cliff. RIP. Pause, now without a teammate, runs from the combination of Dyslexia and Grylls with 4 hearts left. Pause attempts a flank through the Ice Spikes and spots ANOTHER team. Pyro was shot by Baj! Pause climbs atop an ice spike to get a better view. Pause tells Aurey that Chad had no honor in killing her from behind just before she leaves the call. Avidya was slain by Beef! Beef fell from a high place! Pause kills Beef again to show off DickButt. A skeleton hits him, but does no damage. He climbs a hill and spots someone below. JSano was shot by BTC! Anderz sneaks up behind Pause while he's looking through dirt and one-shots him with his flame sword RIP. GG.  JSano (Team Chill)  Avidya and Jeff decide to head out in search of players after staying overnight in Castle Pyro. They thank the owner and depart. They don't even see Team Girl Scouts! Early in their adventure, they encounter ""magic"" floating snow layers. Jeff breaks one to see if they all go away, and they do. Avidya remarks that he ""killed the magic."" They find a ravine soon after. AND ANOTHER! Avidya takes notice of Team Dyslexia's lower health. They see nobody. They climb a hill near the border in a biome that isn't covered in snow. Avidya debates whether or not to attempt a cliff dive into a river below, and decides against it. They turn back towards 0,0 in pursuit of players. Jeff thinks Aurey fell off of Castle Pyro. Upon nearing 0,0 Avidya sees a player and they both shift. It's Pause. NO ITS BEEF! Jeff misses arrow shots. He rushes and Beef shoots him while he leaves Beef to a creeper, but two follow him. Beef pours lava and sets Avidya ablaze. Beef slays Avidya, but Jeff knocks Beef off a cliff as mobs attack him leaving him with half health. As Avidya leaves the call, Jeff eats an apple to regen back to 7 hearts. Jeff digs into a wall to hide and sort the spoils. Team Red Shirts moves in for the kill, but Jeff notices. ""Hi Seth."" Jeff calmly accepts his death, blaming it on ""his own stupidity.""  Chad (Team Dyslexic)  Anderz retrieves the enchanting table and Chad says they should go for 0,0 to which Anderz agrees. Anderz actually suggests a sneak attack! No kidding. ""Get some good bow shots,"" he says as he demonstrates on a spider. With the string, Anderz quickly makes himself a Power II bow. Then a Power III. Chad tries to toss Anderz their anvil, but throws the furnaces instead. He corrects this as Anderz returns the furnaces and compares them to a married couple, sharing everything. Continuing on the way, they encounter Anderz's spawn location and he feels some nostalgia about it. More sharing as Chad gives Anderz some porkchops to keep him from starving. Their dyslexia comes into play with some confusion about ""left"" and they spot Castle Pyro. So far there's been Pyro himself, Team Chill, Team Girl Scouts, and now Team Dyslexia. Wow!. Anderz takes half a heart of fall damage carelessly jumping on a hillside. More smack talk from Anderz as they pursue Girl Scouts. ""No offense to Aureylian, but she isn't the best fighter."" They find Girl Scouts on their hill and go in thirsty for blood. Anderz actually does a flanking maneuver! Good call IlI4n, although it wasn't against Grylls. Before scaling the hill to kill Aurey, they eat their apples. Chad kills Aurey without taking any damage. Chad apologizes to Aurey for killing her. Anderz makes 4 bookcases to enchant, but they find nothing better. Anderz gets more levels and gets a fire aspect diamond sword and collect their enchanting. They go for the kill on Team Red Shirts. Anderz ender pearls behind BTC, taking two hearts. He goes into battle, but takes two more and retreats. Anderz was shot by Seth! BTC was burt to a crisp fighting Chad! Seth was shot by Chad leaving him with 1.5 hearts. That dirty stripmining cheater. Chad is now alone. Chad says he was glas to be partnered with Anderz as they celebrate their 6 combined kills. Anderz leaves the call and Chad is nervously shaking. He takes out a creeper while sorting through the loot and misses the epidsode marker.  Seth (Team Red Shirts)  Seth and BTC begin the episode enchanting and smelting gold for apples. Seth eats one apple to regen to 8. BTC makes a sharpness II sword before they surface. Seth tosses a sharpness I knockback I sword saying that knockback sucks. He begins a staircase, but hears what he believes to be a skeleton spawner, so he goes up in the other direction. They discuss the mechanics of diamond boots and swords while staircasing. They arise in the forest at the edge of the snow and Seth kills a sheep to get more food. They stop to cook their food after killing more sheep and pigs. While it's cooking, Seth cleans up his inventory as BTC protects them from creepers. BTC makes some more arrows for Seth. They spot a lone player in the distance after passing Team Dyslexia's left behind crafting table. They chase him and creepers chase them. They see the player's hidey-hole in the hillside easily given away by the cobblestone. Seth mines one of the blocks. It's JSano! They easily take him out with close range bow shots and take no damage themselves. Seth acts as lookout while BTC sorts through the items. Team Dyslexia approaches. They flee the oncoming storm. Anderz comes behind Seth and takes ignites him with his sword. Seth, with 2 hearts, gets the bow kill on a weakened Anderz. BTC burns to death since he cannot get to his water source as Seth goes in for the kill on Chad. After being hit by Seth's sword, Chad pulls out his bow and eliminates Seth with a close range bow shot.   Baj (Team Grylls)  Baj and Arkas head towards 0,0 hoping to kill someone. While trekking through the jungle on their long journey to the center, Baj collects some water just in case. Baj and Arkas are unsure whether they are allowed to kill unteamed players as they enter the Ice Spikes, and Seth and Beef both assure them of it's fairness. Arkas strides ahead of Baj and climbs a spike to get a better view. Baj then runs ahead of Arkas and waits for him to catch up. Baj sees what he thinks is a player appear from behind an ice spike, but it turns out to be nothing more than a harmless bunny. Arkas asks Pause where he is and they exchange smack talk. Arkas freaks out after spotting Aurey and runs. He fears her and her teammate Pause. Aurey starts shooting at them and Baj returns with a direct hit. They have a disadvantage at the bottom of the hill. Arkas gets another shot on Aurey. Pause sneaks up from the side and engages Team Grylls. Pause hits Baj twice, and he hits Pause once. Aurey hits Baj as well leaving him with 5.5 hearts. He eats an apple then shoots at Aurey who is killed by Chad. Pause flees as does Grylls. Arkas spots Pyro and Baj begins shooting. He gets multiple close range successive bow shots. Pyro circles an ice spike and Baj gets the final shot, killing him and taking no damage. Baj sorts through Pyro's stuff and takes PauseUnpause SUCKS. He and Arkas retreat to the jungle and dig out a hidey-hole. Baj places an anvil and wants to create a power IV bow called Pauses mum, but doesn't have enough levels. He now notices Pyro's sword's name. He then makes a projectile protection diamond chestplate and dons it, giving Arkas his protection II iron one. Another golden apple for Baj. Arkas and Baj emerge and kill some skeletons with .5 hearts taken by Baj. They reach the snow as the episode ends.  Vechs (Team Breadcrumbs)  Vechs worries about the darkness at the top of the ravine, but Nebris tells him not to worry. Vechs makes an iron shovel to mine gravel. Nebris is looking for gold and diamonds. He makes projectile protection II diamond pants. ""Wouldn't it be great to have a full suit of blast protection armor?"" ""Oh God."" Vechs continues to mine gravel for flint as Nebris spots gold. He hears skeletons, but they are nowhere to be found. Both of them are scared by an enderman as Vechs follows Nebris to the gold. ""Did you go into the waterfall?"" ""Of course, you always go into the waterfall have you ever played an RPG?"" ""I made an RPG."" Nebris decides to kill the enderman, so he surrounds it with cobblestone. He pours water so the pearl doesn't fall into lava and does a great deal of damage. The cobble prevents the enderman from escape, and Nebris gets the kill and the pearl. Nebris remarks that they can beat Pakratt now. Nebris makes a protection III chestplate. Vechs complains about the flint mechanics while mining MOAR. Nebris suggests that they surface. Vechs says to wait until he gets a full stack of arrows from the gravel. They finally head for the surface after the death of Beef. On the way up, they discuss Reddit banning people. Once surfaced they see the deaths of Anderz and Team Red Shirts and excitedly sprint towards 0,0. Nebris begins to lose his voice as Vechs questions why his voice is so different from old videos. ""My voice is weird."" Nebris complains about not being able to get lots of kills as the episode ends.  Beef  see reply"
mindcrack,3cycad,PureCharlie,24,Sat Jul 11 22:04:19 2015 UTC,"Beef  Beef opens the episode wondering if the map is too big as he continues the search for Pyro or Pakratt. He debates whether or not to follow Pakratt's lead and go underground in search of diamonds and gold. He really wants a teammate though, so he heads for 0,0. Beef constructs a small monument to himself at 0,0. ""Here lies the body of me who is about to get murdered by somebody."" He makes a hidey-hole and constructs a shovel and more arrows. He apologizes for boring gravel-digging content. He worries that if he goes underground, Pak and Pyro will team up and there is no way he'd be able to take out a team on his own. He gets extremely frustrated that he hasn't found a teammate yet. After seeing Pyro's death, he heads back towards 0,0 to try to find action. Beef says he doesn't care and goes in for the kill on Team Chill. He successfully ignites Avidya, and kills him, but JSano comes from behind and whacks him off a cliff to his death.  Pyro  Pyro staircases up right next to the border and freaks out and thinks it's inching in. (It's not). Upon surfacing, he makes some more arrows and kills a chicken. He cooks his food and runs. He thinks Baj's team kill message is referring to him, but sees nothing. He says he's going crazy after seeing more rabbits. Pyro runs central to see if he can find a teammate. and kills a spider spawner with no good loot. One gives him a good scare though. After Aurey's death, he wonders if he can partner with Pause, but is denied. Pyro expresses his sympathies for Aurey. He runs into Team Grylls and tries to flee, but Baj is too strong. He tries to hit Baj even once, but fails. Baj shoots Pyro dead.  Pakratt  Pak says he wants to try to get a normal golden apple before he heals and sharpness III on his sword. He sees that is takes 8 levels and he only has 4. He mines out some coal to get more XP, then takes out a spider dungeon. A redstone vein takes him to 8. Unable to find gold, he rises in search of Pyro or Beef and spots a witch hut in the swamp and cows on an extreme hill. He attacks the cows to get beef and leather and kills some chickens. Pyro dies, and Pak wonders what would happen if he and Beef were the last two left and if they are auto-teamed. He realizes they have to see each other. He sees some wolves chasing mobs and realizes he has 12 bones which he uses to get two dogs. Stackedratt0013 gets EVEN MORE stacked. His PI must be like 1000 by now. Beef dies and Pak worries about being the only solo player left other than Pause and considers entering the Nether. After shooting a skeleton, Pak places the Notch Apple on the 5 slot in his hotbar, calling himself a fool for not remembering. He breeds his dogs and gets a puppy. PI OVER 9000! Probably not, but the joke is there. He slays some creepers and one blows up, but Pak expertly blocks and neither him, nor his dogs are hurt. He decides to wait in a small tunnel-cave until daytime to go into battle at 0,0. One of the wolves attacks a skeleton as the 140 minute marker flashes.  Wrap-up  What the heck even happened? 9 deaths? 3 were Chad? Team Dyslexic OP. Or not seeing as how one's dead and the other has 1.5 hearts. Chad is no longer any sort of threat. Grylls is in a very good position at the moment, and so is Breadcrumbs. The wild card is Pak. In his current state, he could very well take out either of those teams. Maybe even both! Well this should be interesting.  I hope I've done well recapping the UHC in Guardax's place. He'll be back in episode 9, should there be one, but I'm on Episode 8 duty. See you all on Monday!"

Also, if you dezone some of your second industrial zone for residential or commercial, you may be able to increase industrial demand in Suck and above Trapezoidberg (You know... The bit you have ready for the forestry industry) while supplying more area for people to live.  It could be hilarious of you built some of the city in the dried riverbed.  One last thing: Out by Suck the beach looks like an excellent spot for an airport... But you'll want some services by it.  Edit: Prettying things. Also, just remembered that the oil processing industry will require some highly educated workers. They'll probably come in from other parts of town and possibly move into Suck... Which may cause traffic problems."

mindcrack,3cuhm6,Shaktar27,6,Fri Jul 10 22:00:14 2015 UTC,"Lot of votes come in for 2 at the minute, which seems a fairly wise choice  Theres bound to be a bunch of saboteurs hidden within there as well, so your probably correct!"
mindcrack,3cuhm6,Twiggy02,21,Fri Jul 10 22:01:16 2015 UTC,"The ""saboteurs"" are actually helping out! I'll try to explain why without using too many technical terms. I think it's easier to explain in terms of mario bros than mario kart, so I'll do that.  Imagine a genome that manages to get pretty far in a mario bros level by doing two things:   jumping whenever there is an object in the tile right in front of mario. Jumping when there's an air space one tile to the right and one tile down of mario.   It might be able to make it pretty far and get a good score. But eventually it'll get to one of those pipes with an enemy coming out of it, and following the first rule then will lead to death.  So what does that mean? The ""Jump when something is one tile in front of mario"" rule is actually bad, you want to replace that with a more complex set of rules that can both jump over obstacles but avoid jumping into enemies. But that doesn't mean the entire genome is garbage, the ""jump over holes"" rule might still be useful and something we want to keep around.  If we only keep the best genomes, then two things will happen. We will keep the genomes that has the flawed jump over obstacle rule in, since that one gets far into the level and thus a good score, even thought that rule is a dead end that can never get past the pipe enemy and beat the level. And we'll discard the ones that has that rule taken out since they get stuck early in the level, even thought they still have the good ""jumping over holes"" rule and might eventually mutate or be combined with another genome so it finds a better way to get over obstacles without dying to the pipe enemy. This means that if you only pick the best genomes the algorithm will get stuck trying the same flawed solution over and over again, never improving, since it needs to go trought an intermediate stage that actually has worse score before it can improve. This is called being stuck in a local maximum.  So to sum up the problem: When choosing which genomes to combine to create new ones we can't just pick the best ones since then we get stuck in local maximums, but as you probably realize that we do need to favor the ones with higher score somehow or there's no pressure for each new generation to improve.  So what you do is you give all genomes a chance to get picked for being combined/mutated, but you give the ones with higher score a higher probability to be picked. That way the worse scoring genomes that might still have good parts in them still has a chance to stick around, and aren't just thrown away, but since they have a lower probability there is still pressure on the population to improve with each generation.  When designing the genetic algorithm like the MarI/O there is a trade-off with the probabilities you assign. If you give the good scoring ones too high probability to get picked you get stuck in local maximums, but if you give them too low probability you don't make progress. You need to find a good balance between the two. This is one of the hardest parts of designing a genetic algorithm.  So the so-called saboteurs are in this case actually just doing their part with the probability numbers, adding some randomness to which ones get picked, giving the seemingly bad genomes that might be an intermediate stage to something better a chance to continue. As long as the number of saboteurs don't outnumber the people picking the best ones it'll still make progress, and in the long run it will be better for it."
mindcrack,3cuhm6,AndreasTPC,5,Fri Jul 10 23:37:34 2015 UTC,"I believe the generations are being proportionately generated from the votes being cast, so that if the top scorer gets 20% of the vote, they will interbreed with the top 20% of the genome. It cycles down through each consecutively top scorer until the next generation is big enough at which point the rest of the previous generation will have no offspring.  When there's a clear top performer, the genome will be populated primarily by its offspring, which will lead to inbreeding and homogenization of further generations. However, when performance in the same generation is similar there is no clear cut frontrunner and votes get distributed more evenly, leading to a period where progress stagnates. However, there is a factor of mutation in play as well; when a single genome has a benefitial mutation it will excel past its siblings and become the clear cut frontrunner, guaranteeing its genes pass into the next generation.   At this point, MarI/O Kart is about 20% dominated by a homogenized genome that follows the exact same path through the course getting trapped in the corner where the ramp is, because it's trying to drive towards a road behind a wall. It's also the top performer which means that genome keeps claiming the high percentage of the vote and breeding more offspring that will do the sane thing. Only a mutation that avoids this behavior will successfully advance the species, and will immediately guarantee that its genome will dominate its child generation."

I noticed in your videos that everything is sort of differenciated by black and white squares? I am guessing this is sort of like ""on and off"" inputs(I dont know much about neural networks)  so I assume its not possible to have different states?"
mindcrack,3cuhm6,Coolflip,2,Sat Jul 11 01:35:04 2015 UTC,"Well it depends on how interconnected the layers are, how many nodes are in each layer, etc. I took a bio-inspired computing class on campus last semester, and with ~25 nodes total, we were able to differentiate between hollow squares, circles, ellipses, rectangles, full squares, circles, etc. no problem after about 60 generations (~4 seconds) using nothing but black or white for the input pixel.  Long story short, yes. Even though it only sees white or black, a certain combination of neurons firing will lead to a specific reaction."

mindcrack,3cuhm6,msclrhd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:38:53 2015 UTC,"I have some thoughts on how to improve MarI/O...  When breeding the next generation, include the best 1-2 from the previous generation. This would have the effect of keeping good traits longer (e.g. if a genome completes the course/level).  Define negative fitness weights as well as positive ones.  For MarI/O Kart:    Distance is good -- the further it gets, the better.  Speed is good.  Hitting obstacles (walls, pipes, etc.) is bad.  Getting warnings (going off course, going the wrong direction, etc.) is bad.   You can then partition these into the genomes that completed the race with the ones that didn't. You can then breed between genomes that completed the race, and breed ones that completed the race with those that didn't, but not between the ones that didn't complete the race (or only breed a small number from that set).  Thus, in the Twitch Plays MarI/O, you had a genome that completed the race but pressed the break button, and one that got far (into lap 4) at a decent speed, but got stuck in a corner. This would keep both, allowing it to improve. The criteria could have also prevented the corner hitting genes from progressing in the first place (even though they may have travelled the furthest)."

Also one where my dad dropped me off for this camp and I started crying and trying to call him for some reason but then Guude showed up because he was dropping off his daughter there and for some reason Chad was with him and me and my friend took a picture with them.  I've had one where I was showing Kurt around my synagogue (Jewish version of church) and he was super amazed by everything.  One where Pause killed Phineas and Ferb by breaking a hang glider they were about use and it was all in the world of the Lego movie???

They escaped the island with Joseph, Mary and Baby Jesus on a ship to a place where the largest massacre of sharks happened;  there were bodies of floating sharks everywhere.   The Japanese had killed them for fin soup.  Then God got angry with them (the Mindcrackers), so he destroyed the ship and teleported the B team to an island and Joseph,  Mary and Baby Jesus to a alternate universe. On the island that the B Team was on, there were tall trees made of coal blocks with jungle tree leaves and large areas of wood blocks?, so the B Team decided to hide on the island and they made a house and lit the coal blocks on fire.     Meanwhile Mlllbe was on the old island hiding."

But instead on my death bed Zisteau came with flowers and started a skype call so they could all say goodbye to me. I was ready to die happy until I had to wake up for work.

I was just chillin' out in the top with BTC, Pakratt, BdoubleO, Pause, Vechs and Nebris. Having a conversation, occasionally getting a perfectly timed headshot on someone below. There was a ton of people from my school.  One of my closer friends got a kill on BTC, Vechs and Pause (I think. I had this dream ages ago- I wish you could remember dreams better. Maybe a pillow that records your dreams, and you can watch and delete as much as you wish?)  I was killed by someone hanging out in a vent, and I respawned down on the ground. I never did find the Mindcrack guys again, so I was quite sad, really.  Then it turned into some huge thing about a shopping centre instead of the tall, wooden building.

I also have another dream but it's waaay NSFW.  Several of the mindcrackers were playing Mario Kart, except it was in a level I had never seen before. The level itself was an underwater sea palace, and that was really cool, except the mindcrackers playing weren't the ""usual group"". I'm definitely sure Vechs and Blame were playing, and I think Z, Doc, and Pyro were playing too (possibly Arkas?). I only clearly remember Blame because I was ""watching his perspective"" or something like that (though I'm pretty sure I jumped to other people's perspectives too). The funny part about this dream was Vechs however, because in the first lap of the race he lagged behind and everyone thought he was stuck or just a really terrible driver. What he was doing though was staying behind collecting all the item boxes to place traps so that it'll be hell for the racers as they make their second go-around (and the traps in this Mario Kart game actually stayed in place too). It was all really crazy and funny, and Blame ended up in second place."

Two of my recent dreams involved large, ffa fighting events between most of the Mindcrackers and a few people, including me. In both of them alliances were allowed. In the first one, I ended up hiding in a shed with a few people, but in the second one, I was doing well and made my way upstairs, where the good stuff was. Pause, one of the strongest people there, turned into a wolf when I went upstairs and charged at me. I sidestepped, grabbed him, and threw him over the railing. Then I stared over the railing, hearing him whine as he hit the ground, turned around, and saw Aurey, who didn't have anything, so I spared her. Shortly after that I woke up.

The reason we haven't been seeing megabuilds like Season 3 is because people fear the reset coming along and erasing all their work. This will hopefully fix that. Hopefully. Please.
mindcrack,3ctnga,Stephenhf123,-5,Fri Jul 10 22:18:44 2015 UTC,"The reason we haven't been seeing megabuilds like Season 3 is because people fear the reset coming along and erasing all their work. This will hopefully fix that. Hopefully. Please.   The real reason is that Minecraft has been around for a million years now and is getting kinda boring.  Think about it, how many other games do you play for 5 years without getting bored and moving on to something else? Minecraft still has this effect, it just seems to have a bit more longevity than the average game.

mindcrack,3cukuc,BroskiBen,25,Fri Jul 10 22:12:26 2015 UTC,"So if this episode has no action, I don’t even know what to write here anymore;  Girl Scouts are sneaking up behind Chill on the tower. No point in not engaging each other at this point, since everyone is craving for blood. Interesting though is that Beef is heading for the tower as well. If he sees the battle, he will likely wait for the opportune moment to try and strike down the surviving team(member), as he’s given up hope in finding a teammate and wants to fight.   Prediction: Avidya survives, but is killed by Beef afterwards.   Grylls are heading straight for Dyslexic. Both teams are well equipped, but Grylls do have a health advantage.   Prediction: Grylls bite the dust because of a flanking maneuver by Anderz.  Red Shirts and Breadcrumbs have another rather uneventful episode, but end this one on a cliffhanger.   Pyro is caving in the same area as Pak is, but I’ve got a feeling they’ll somehow still miss each other since that seems to be the norm :P"
mindcrack,3cukuc,IlI4n,48,Fri Jul 10 22:17:47 2015 UTC,flanking maneuver  Anderz   Pick one. This guy rushes in like a train.
mindcrack,3cukuc,Slowly_,16,Fri Jul 10 23:28:13 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but he does have an ender pearl... So throwing it over the other team and attacking from the back/side is something I can see Anderz doing again."
mindcrack,3cukuc,IlI4n,7,Sat Jul 11 00:03:01 2015 UTC,Yeah. He pulled that one on Doc in S19

Anderz will try to charge (esp. knwoing his Fire Aspect) and get mowed down by their OP bows. Chad is saved yet again by his bling, but runs away dangerously low, feeling the power of their gear. Both Baj and Arkas survive with some damage sustained."
mindcrack,3cukuc,pm_me_for_happiness,13,Sat Jul 11 01:38:48 2015 UTC,"We will finally (hopefully) have our bloodbath that we are all asking for.  The only definite battle is between Team Chill and Team Girl Scouts, where I think that Team Chill have the advantage.  Team Breadcrumbs will continue searching for players.  Team Red Shirts will continue to cave and enchant and will most likely surface at the end of the episode.  Team Grylls will surface at the start and will possibly run into Team Dyslexic to create a battle, where Team Grylls have the advantage.  Pyro will head to 0, 0 to do as much damage as he can to any team that he finds.  VintageBeef  and Pakratt will also go close to the middle and will do whatever it takes to avoid each other."
mindcrack,3cukuc,kmatt17,9,Sat Jul 11 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"After Pyro's comment all teams will gravitate toward the centre of the map. There will be a blood bath at (0, 0) involving most of the teams. BTC and Seth (who are at this point arguably slightly behind other teams as far as going out hunting goes) will arrive last at the centre and clean up whoever remains to win the season. Conclusion Season 12 repeat :D (we know how much people enjoyed that season ;) )"
mindcrack,3cukuc,JamestheDouglas,9,Fri Jul 10 23:44:11 2015 UTC,"I suspect this episode Jsano goes down but so do Pause and Aurey. Pause gets the kill. Avidya gets both Kills but is down to 3 hearts.   Pak meets someone. Pyrao most likely.   PPeople continue to circle.  but those are the only people who die are Jsano, Pause, and Aurey."
mindcrack,3cukuc,readonlypdf,6,Fri Jul 10 22:20:34 2015 UTC,"Okay so we are hopefully getting a battle tomorrow as they all complained about lack of interactions, and seeing as Girls Scouts sees Chill, and I doubt it'll be long before they spot the scouts going for the flank, we should be opening with a bang.  Beef will most likely go in circles finding something undoubtedly interesting like the anvil yesterday.  Dyslexia continues acting as giants which means they'll probably flub up any future interaction because of their overconfidence high.  Grylls will hopefully align themselves onto a crash course with another team (a kill by Your_Mum would be fun).  EDIT: Upon reviewing Breadcrumbs video, both they and Redshirts continue leading fun lives in the mines. /EDIT  Which leaves Pak and Pyro to continue with the near misses, even though they are approximately 100 blocks away from each other they will never meet up as Pyro heads off to 0,0 to do whatever damage he can."

mindcrack,3cukuc,ImPuntastic,8,Sat Jul 11 02:28:45 2015 UTC,"Girl Scouts and Chill fight. Pause takes out Jsano, and deals a hefty amount of damage to Avidya before Avidya is able to shoot them both. Beef approaches to 0,0, and cleans up.  Pak gets enough gold to make another golden apple and surfaces up. By the end of the episode, he gets a sharp 3 sword.  Barkas engages Dyslexia in a bow fight near the end of the episode.  Pyro finds Beef, and they camp out in the cobblestone cube.  Both Red Shirt and Breadcrumbs have an uneventful episode getting better enchants, more diamonds, and more gold."
mindcrack,3cukuc,ShadowNinja002,4,Fri Jul 10 22:40:38 2015 UTC,"Chill definitely has the upper hand in a fight against the Girlscouts. I doubt Pause and Aurey will be able to land a shot on them without being spotted first; and then it's going to mostly be a bow fight. Chill will out range Girlscouts no question. They have the high ground, Jsano has a power bow, and both have a healthy supply of arrows (Avidya is infinity of course, and Jsano has about as many arrows as Pause and Aurey combined). If Girlscouts landed a lucky shot and knocked one off of the tower, that would be helpful, but Jsano and Avidya are both aware of that concern (they were joking about it) so I think they will be conscious of it and not let it happen.    The only problem would come if Pause got into the castle unnoticed. In that case, maybe he could decimate them. Even then, Chill does not have bad swords and they are working on enchanting their armor.    I think Chill will either kill both of them or cause them to retreat during the bow fight.    But, you can never count Pause out of PvP.    I see some people talking about a possible Grylls vs. Dyslexia fight. If that were to happen, I would bet money on Grylls every time.    They have more health, better swords, better bows (with more arrows) and more apples. Not only that, but Chad and Anderz are in gung ho mode and Grylls is probably as chill as Team Chill. If the two teams fight, I think Grylls wins no question."

mindcrack,3cukuc,Sadsharks,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:45:12 2015 UTC,"They took away the lava, so it's going away. And as I said, I don't think they will let themselves get knocked off, even if they do get hit (and I don't doubt they will). High ground is demonstratively better in a bow fight."

Pyro hits Beef accidentally at some point, just cause Beef's reaction would be hilarious after he finally finds a teammate he decides to beat him up.  Pakratt draws a face on his Natch apple after going crazy being the last one without a team.  Seth/BTC run into Jsano/Avidya with Avidya being the only survivor.  The episode ends with Nebris/Vechs and Pause/Aureylian spotting Beef/Pyro at 0,0.   Baj/Arkas and Anderz/Chad may have a run in as well.   I haven't watched everyone's perspective so I'm not sure if anyone is heading where I suspect though. I included everyone though in my predictions."

mindcrack,3cukuc,justheretogiveuthis,2,Sat Jul 11 14:30:35 2015 UTC,"There shall be some combat, but the skirmish at Castle Pyro is already almost guaranteed. Given this, my predictions:  Castle Pyro  Really, the outcome of the episode hinges on if Team Girl Scouts will hold off on engaging Team Chill long enough for Beef to get noticed. Naturally, I would be of the opinion that some bow fighting will ensue, and Beef will use the opportunity to flank Team Girl Scouts.   Team Chill has an unusual advantage here: namely, if they set it up correctly, that lava of theirs can ignite their arrows -- and thus their enemies. This, I predict, will play into Beef's favor, as the members of Team Girl Scouts will have to change strategies to engage the newcomer -- and thus be left more open to bow fire.  Between the odd alliance, Team Girl Scouts would be disadvantaged, and possibly fall. Also, there's lava, so watch out, Aurey!  Dyslexcis   The Dyslexics are heading toward Team Grylls. Unlike the single players, Team Dyslexics seem more keen on noticing the other players, so a fight is likely to ensue. Health advantage and bow advantage go to Team Grylls, but a Lepre-Viking teleporting into your face and stabbing you is not really the time and place for that. Team Grylls has disadvantage here, and both Dyslexics very well may walk away.  Breadcrumbs  Something derpy this way comes... and it's something to do with the TNT.  Red Shirts  Our reserved duo is likely to finish up their caving, and head toward the surface. Episode 8 might feature them more.  Not-a-Team and Not-Yet-Mentioned  Pak, our most formidable competitor, and Pyro, our other remaining competitor, are likely to continue missing each other... though I predict they'll at least figure out that they had a near miss with someone.  Conclusion  15 competitors remain, but blood will be shed soon, so stick around!  EDIT: Anchupom makes a good point, in that Pyro does have some enchanting done."

mindcrack,3cukuc,Melkovar,2,Sat Jul 11 22:44:02 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the popular opinion here and say that Pause rushes in and takes out JSano but dies to Avidya, and Aurey comes in to clean it up, being the only member to survive the encounter.  I think this is the only battle that will happen during the next episode, but by the end we will have every team except maybe Breadcrumbs moving in towards 0,0 while Breadcrumbs circles about 200 blocks outside looking for the scraps"
mindcrack,3cukuc,JaxThePillow,2,Sat Jul 11 04:01:19 2015 UTC,"Pause will shoot someone from Chill off the tower because they get SO CLOSE to the edge so often. Girl Scouts will win the battle. They'll gather loot but be interrupted by...  VintageBeef, tired of waiting, decides to battle Pause and Aurey. He does some damage but dies in the end.  Arkas and Baj reach Pause and Aureylian, rushing full speed after seeing action in the chat. No matter how hard Pause and Aurey try, Baj and Arkas still come out victorious.  OMGChad and AnderZEL take a bit longer to get going, so by the time they're moving, Arkas and Baj are halfway to 0,0. That doesn't stop them from coming up behind them and completely getting destroyed. Arkas and Baj can now chill for the night in Fort Pyro.  Seth and BTC keep caving when they notice that it's night by the time they're ready.  Nebris and Vechs keep caving until they realize the sun should be rising.  Pakratt keeps caving and comes up to see the sun setting but runs around some anyway.  Pyro keeps caving."
mindcrack,3cukuc,Rance_Mohammitz,2,Sat Jul 11 09:24:41 2015 UTC,I want Beef to sneak up on Pause or Aurey and drop the Anvil on them. Would be the best kill in UHC history.

The guy I was up against is a better shot than most of Mindcrack; a melee charge might actually work against some of them ... but still I think it's going to be interesting to see how he pulls it off in that kind of terrain, if he does.

Vechs blows up Nebris then dies himself to Pearl damage. This happens fighting a freshly surfaced Red Shirts. After healing up, Girl Scouts debates whether to search for apples or hide in the tower waiting to kill some more. They decide to wait, as people will most likely drop more apples upon death.

Pak easily wipes them out with his Notch Apple.  Episode 9 rolls around and Red Shirts stumbles upon the tower now owned by Girl Scouts.

mindcrack,3cu4xj,Davidellias,21,Fri Jul 10 20:12:24 2015 UTC,They should really start doing 30 minute episode if they dont want to have 100 episodes :D
mindcrack,3cu4xj,Gondlon,6,Fri Jul 10 20:38:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they seem to be underestimating the length of this map.  If they keep making 20 minute episodes, it's probably going to take them more than 100 episodes: 30 hours is how long an efficient and moderate approach to this map takes, and that's 1800 minutes. Knowing GOB, I'm predicting ~45 hours, which would be 130 20 minute episodes   Edit: After watching the episode, I'm starting to feel bad for them. They try so hard, but with so little equipment... hopefully they'll start putting extra gear in chests or making their own supplies (when resources become available)."
mindcrack,3cu4xj,The_Chronox,2,Fri Jul 10 21:01:01 2015 UTC,Again this has all been prerecorded meaning that they have not read any comments since the series started

mindcrack,3cu4xj,Hardy_Man,4,Fri Jul 10 20:39:33 2015 UTC,I can see some sense in not doing that since you'd either have to move everything to that building to have something to re-equip with when you die or run back to the farming base each time to re-equip. That building looks like it could be a great spot for their next base when they have enough iron to make a bucket to move the water they'd need for farming.

They really enjoyed RFW, but the concept behind it was supposed to be a blind playthrough of a map, where you didn't know what was in the map, and you didn't know what to do beforehand. The RFW community, however, instead turned to teams practicing the maps, getting to know all the ins and outs before the actual match. This made the game more of a speedrunning race then a blind playthrough, and thus it lost a lot of the original spirit. This, couple with a few personal disagreements, led to Mindcrack largely not participating in RFW."

Volunteering for Mindcrack, being a Minecon Agent and cycling through London to get everywhere from our Greenwich appartment (nobody told me our house was at the top of a mountain) had me so tired I was in bed as soon as I got home for most of the nights. I met a lot of awesome people and got a lot of satisfaction from helping out in making stuff happen! I think I might skip on the Minecon Agent bit next time though, apart from being a Steve during the Live Event my job mostly seemed to consist of telling people ""no"" (""you can not go on stage to get an autograph"", ""you can not sit in the reserved seats, even if nobody has claimed them yet"", ""no, you are not allowed to follow the cameraman around the room in hopes of getting your question answered"") and making little children cry in the process :P I get that it is needed, but I had more fun making people actually happy while working for Mindcrack at the Party and at the Booth!  Really glad that we had the day off on Monday before heading home. It gave us the opportunity to relax and play Monopoly at the house and have Manesh and Tara over for dinner at night. Watching UHC with a group of nine is so much fun!"
mindcrack,3ct9pj,BroskiBen,3,Fri Jul 10 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed volunteering for the Mindcrack party. Pretty much exactly what I expected. To anyone who was at the party: if you got handed a swag bag by some dude in a JSano Fan Server t-shirt - that was me :)  Cycling through london was, just like the decision to volunteer, exhausting but totally worth it. The apartment at the top of what seemed like a Himalayan mountain range might have been a bit much (also: infested with ants), but at the end of the day we still slept well and the apartment was cheap&fully featured.   Monday was pretty much the best day ever; getting the opportunity to really talk with the other fan server people, as well as pajam, Manesh and Tara was special.

mindcrack,3ct9pj,W92Baj,2,Fri Jul 10 21:01:04 2015 UTC,"I had the most amazing 2 weeks in the UK. I didn't get to do half the stuff I wanted to do, but there was only so much time.  I love the UK. I truly felt at home, especially in the North. It might be because I didn't stay in touristy areas, so they weren't tired of Americans. It also could be that it was just homey to me. The people are warm and friendly, the countryside is absolutely beautiful. Parts of it reminded me of Iowa. Rolling hills, lots of trees and fields and green, so green.  However...you folks need more veggies in your life. At least more than peas, carrots, turnips and potatoes. I was dying for a salad or just raw veggies. While in Skelmersdale, I did buy myself lots of fresh veggies as snacks.  As for driving - it was easy to drive on the other side of the road. The roundabouts and motorways were a bit more of a learning curve, but after a couple of days and many beeping horns, I got the hang of them. Personally, we should use them more here in the US.  I'm glad to be home now and can concentrate on getting married here in a couple of weeks.   There is also another culling at work to occur at the end of July. No one will tell us who the 2 head count will be, but I have decided to put out some feelers for other jobs. There is a job that I really would like to have, but it involves having an international boss. I'm not so sure how to handle that. Oh, did I mention that I was offered 3 jobs while in the UK? Yep."

I should clarify my statement. I read it again and realized it's way too generalized and kinda rude. The restaurants in the UK need more variety of veggies in their menus. The grocery stores had tons of veggies, so those at home probably do eat more."

All my friends are out of town, my house is under construction so I don't wanna practice guitar in front of strangers, and I'm leaving for a month-long sleep away camp Wednesday.  On an unrelated note, who wants to talk about music? Ratatat and Tame Impala finally released their new albums, which are both amazing. Ratatat's exceeded my expectations 10x, and the Tame Impala album was a bit disappointing but still good.

mindcrack,3cyfyp,xantys,0,Sat Jul 11 23:12:07 2015 UTC,Well he says he wants Baj face gone because he thinks it is not a spoiler tagg but come on the text is big enough and unless he has bad eyes I think he just wants Baj's face gone.
mindcrack,3cyfyp,Fudce,4,Sat Jul 11 23:23:52 2015 UTC,As much as Baj is beautiful I keep seeing the W92Spoiler and click the link expecting something to do with Baj.   I think that means that he clicks things expecting Baj content because he sees Baj's face. He is not hating on Baj.

mindcrack,3coqbr,yellowddit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:48:55 2015 UTC,"O'Hare was much nicer than Toronto. Stood in line for about 4-6 hours in Tornonto with a bunch of incompetent people not being able to help/communicate anything all day. But O'Hare I got through all lines/security in 7 minutes flat, and had plenty of time, however then United had a nationwide grounding of flights for about 20-30 minutes which was somewhat annoying, but really really stress free compared to the day before in Toronto."
mindcrack,3coqbr,pajam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:56:24 2015 UTC,What's wrong with Toronto? :( I thought our airport was pretty good
mindcrack,3coqbr,losinator501,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:21:19 2015 UTC,"Not one person was competent. Not one. Customs for a connecting flight was just an unorganized mess with turnstyle mazes where people just congregated even if they weren't in line. No one giving anyone instructions and people just confused as heck wandering around. Security checkpoint (even though I already did security and it was a connecting flight) required you to show 4 people your boarding pass without changing lines... 4 people... 4 different people all at different points in the same line... like how bad is their security where they worry people are sneaking through into the security line in multiple places where they must place agents mixed throughout? Then almost all flights were delayed/cancelled due to rain and they made us jump back and forth between 2 desks over 6 times (go to the gate agent, no we can't help you, go to customer service. Folks, we can't help you, go to the gate agent - repeat 2 more times) to line up for over 2 hours because they didn't know who was supposed to help us. Then they kept telling us very contradictory information that went against reality time and time again, made me stand in line for 2-4 hours when I was the very first person in line originally, didn't know the airport abbreviations, didn't know how long their own flight times were because they didn't understand how time zones worked, never properly announced my flights multiple delays, so anyone without text alerts never knew the flight was delayed, flight continued to say ""on time"" on all screens around the place when it had been hours since it was first delayed, etc. etc. etc."
mindcrack,3coqbr,pajam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:38:25 2015 UTC,"Hm. Never had a single issue in our airport, but I guess I only fly in and out and don't do any connections.  Sorry to hear about your bad time :("

That's a heck of a lot of bad luck to all happen at one time.  Maybe things are  a mess because of Pan Am Games.  Yeah, airports can be a mess when weather wreaks havocs - once you get a bunch of flights cancelled stuff gets SUPER bad very fast.  Especially a huge hub that also has US customs in Canada (so you have to go through Canadian customs and then US customs if travelling to the states via Canada).  Sorry about such a bad experience. :("

mindcrack,3coqbr,Chasmic_,18,Thu Jul 9 16:37:17 2015 UTC,"He's Alumni until he decides to sign up with the Mindcrack Networktm, I'd wager. Because of the new business direction (Synergy! Teamwork!) Mindcrack is taking (which is a great thing imo, in case my opinion on the matter should come into question), you can't be an ""official"" Mindcracker without actually being an official Mindcracker.

Before this, there would have been 30 separate contracts for each individual member. The main point of the contract was to make things like this easier. Etho, Genny, Paul, Bdubs, and Thejims simply did not wish to be a part of that, so they are no longer official members of Mindcrack, instead they are VIP guests. The difference is not in the departure, it's in the behind-the-scenes part of Mindcrack.

Now, Pakratt is awfully close to a Notch Apple. My theory is that Nebs and Vechs get into a fight with a God mode Pakratt and Nebris dies to Pak in a melee fight. Realising that Pak is god mode, Nebs tells Vechs to ender pearl away from him and just run until the Notch wears off... instead of ender pearling to safety, Vechs ender pearls right into Pakratt and dies to melee. And that's the story of Pakratt's first two (non-team) UHC kills."

mindcrack,3cq6ld,TJtheObscure,13,Thu Jul 9 22:34:34 2015 UTC,"I would emphasize the ""pretty much"" part of your statement. The only thing that guarantees victory is the regen v, which only lasts 30 seconds. The resistance and fire protection are nice, but they won't save you from death. It's really easy to beat someone with a notch apple if you're good with a bow and understand the situation. Even without a bow you can just run and wait out the regen. So I'd say people are overestimating the effectiveness of notch apples. It's almost always better to go with regular golden apples, especially this early in the game. But given that he's outnumbered in a fight, its probably his best chance."
mindcrack,3cq6ld,BlueCyann,9,Thu Jul 9 23:55:11 2015 UTC,"The secondary buffs stand a higher than average chance of being useful in this game.

BTC can't hold his bladder anymore and runs off. Seth says a pair of boots is better than a pair of swords. Uh...no. The decision is in BTC's hands and he goes with boots. He clearly agonizes over it. I get that Seth sees range combat in their future, but I'd also go with the attack advantage of the diamond sword.   Vechs (Team Breadcrumbs)  Nebris finds an experience orb, only confirmation someone was here...once. They briefly dip in a lit cave and a Protection I iron chestplate goes by the wayside. ""I like that Blame is hurt, makes me happy."" You're at lower health Vechs. Nebris refuses to go to the Nether with Vechs as they wander the wasteland. Nebris wants to get back in a cave, I don't know why you're tricked out already. They easily defeat a Spider Spawner and Vechs sings about Mr. Bucket putting his balls in his mouth. They are digging down, straight down, and Nebris hears water and finds a cave. Vechs finds one with lava, and Nebris gets levels for Projectile Protection II. I'm all for grinding and getting better stuff, but personally I'd stay hunting once I've reached nearly all Prot II gear. Just gets unnecessary. When Pakratt gets Overpowered, Nebris says 'that's really bad'. ""What if Beef finds Pakratt?"" ""Oh my God...and ultimately kills us?"" Nebris asks. It would be the perfect end to the Age of Justice. Now guys reading this, I'm well aware of what Pakratt is up to...Overpowered is the serious damage one right? ;). ""I've never been so afraid of Pakratt!"" Nebris says. ""Man it's getting hot in my room,"" Vechs says. ""Same here. Do we live in the same room?"" ""Pak just took damage...not that it matters.""  Pause (Team Girl Scouts)  The girl scouts are continuing to wander the earth, Pause's old school nature not keeping him grinding in caves. ""Team Never-ending,"" Aurey says. Oops. ""A thousand spoons when all you need is a knife."" Aurey says that she is older than Pause and that means she is smarter, and they agree they get dumber as they get older. ""10,000 hours of doing a game that makes you think, makes you think smarter."" Pause is very comfortable saying he's happy to have reached a 2nd grade reading level, and says he starts to space out when he's reading. I agree with Pause if I'm not really interested. Pause is starting to get the classic annoyance at not finding anyone to murder. They're running into a wall talking about fighting stuff. ""The Never-ending stooooorrrrry."" Turning back they find a Creeper that gets Pause to wonder if somebody is around, and Aurey thinks Creepers burn. They find a cave with torches, and Pause does Etho's dark name tag trick. ""I'm going to do a trick and I'm just going to walk in it,"" Aurey says. Inside they find zero souls. Pause finds two Creepers out in broad daylight that they didn't see earlier. ""There's no Creeper spawners in this, are there?"" ""I don't know, no one's found spawn eggs to mess with us right?"" Aurey suggests the morph mod UHC. AUREY MENTIONS MY RECAPS! WOW! Thanks! Never gotten an in-video mention before, and Aurey launches in to talking about her three-inch scar. Pyro's heading to 0,0, and Aurey suggests a strategy I've long though of: camp out near 0,0 and pick off the leftovers of a battle. Pause blocks themselves in a hill to wait for names, but it's too funny for them to keep up. ""This is not cheating, this is tactical hiding!"" Pause says it...Pakratt Notch Apple. ""He's BY HIMSELF! OH MY GOD! We need ways to incentivize people to leave!"" Like the UHC 18 enchanting table drops? That was meh. The team is at 0,0, and Pause wonders if everyone is invisible or if they are in an alternative dimension. Pause trolls us by starting to eat his Golden Apple. Pause sees someone pouring lava from the tower Pyro built, probably Pyro. Pause says his first cassette ever was the Mortal Kombat soundtrack. Aurey thinks the other person is in a hole, Pause thinks there's two people. Pause sees someone in enchanted armor, nay, two people. Last time they ended an episode seeing people nothing happened.  Arkas (Team Grylls)  ""Welcome back with Team Guinness."" Well fuck. They are grinding away that experience. ""I've got that feeling..."" This skeleton XP farm is well done, nice work team. Really just the enchantment grind for these two. ""I feel like skeletons give you more XP."" I wish there was more to say, but it's just mob farm grinding. This is the UHC of the grind. ""Power III + Power III then needs eleven, Power IV."" My god. This UHC is an arms race. Arkas isn't worried at all about Pakratt's gear. Baj thinks that Pakratt has 'Overkill', not a Notch Apple and is adamant he's right. ""Oh okay, that's easy,"" he says of the Notch Apple. Yeah, Notch Apple. A breeze. Easy. Peezy. Daytime is coming, and Arkas and Baj chow down apples.  Vintage Beef  Beef gets six reeds and still wants those diamonds. Doesn't even have leather. Beef finds cobble, bones, and an anvil just hanging out. I...I don't know who's that is. Beef looks around, casually picks up the anvil, and keeps walking. Beef finds a Zombie Spawner, and pouts lava into it. Why am I doing Beef's video before Avidya? I don't know. Beef wanders around until he finds a swamp with oak trees to give apples. And there are chickens for feathers. It's just the grind in a different form. Beef wonders how he has missed Girl Scouts. Spoiler: he hasn't. Beef eats an apple, should have waited but he's at full now. ""I feel like maybe things are coming up mill house."" Beef finally gets leather. During the night in the open Beef grinds gravel. ""Overpowered? Oh my gosh, what is that achievement? I don't even know what that achievement is."" Beef finds that it is a Notch Apple. ""Well...crap."" But Beef, if you find him you'll be buddies! Beef talks about his embarrassing PMC UHC where he threw his sword on the ground and never played PMC UHC again. His drop key is still Q, even Kurt changed it to O. ""I almost wish Vechs and Nebs had killed me back there."" Oh you won't. Beef has a Golden Apple in reserve as he wanders the earth.   Avidya (Team Chill)  Alright, we're going into the episode here. Avidya welcomes us back alone and is killing time until we see the return of Jsano. ""It's been like four minutes already!"" Avidya is really stressing out. Jsano returns and said he stopped recording right before his computer shut down which actually saved his recording. They are planning to enchant, and Avidya turns his reeds into sugar! Jsano bursts into laughter. They find reeds easily and get to enchanting, but darkness starts to fall. Avidya gets a Sharpness II diamond sword and gives it to Jsano before Jsano turns it back. As they advance to 0,0 Avidya finds Pyro's cobble fortress. ""Somebody's in it, it's probably Vechs,"" Jsano says. ""Let's go kill them."" ""Okay!"" Damn it I love you Jsano. Pakratt's achievement comes in, Avidya thinks it's Nether related as he stands guard over an exploring Jsano on Pyro's structure. The two chill out on top of the structure and Jsano compliments their 'wonderful, wonderful footage'. Jsano starts pouring lava.  Pyro  See comments"
mindcrack,3cq6ld,zacman17716,29,Thu Jul 9 22:00:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, a pair of Boots instead of 2 Swords is better. A Sharp 2 Iron is better than a Sharp 1 Diamond Sword, but to get Iron Boots better than Prot 1 Diamond Boots you would need Prot 4 Iron Boots. Basically, it is way easier to get 2 Sharp 2 Iron Swords than a pair of Prot 4 Iron Boots."
mindcrack,3cq6ld,Vawqer,13,Thu Jul 9 22:50:50 2015 UTC,"And boots affect everything, versus a sword which will only come into effect in melee. Note that Proj Prot is 4x that of normal Prot though, so Proj Prot 1 iron boots in ranged are better than Prot 1 Diamond Boots. But this is 1.8, so we can choose enchants, making this only really relevant if we are talking about the same exact enchant, only different levels.

mindcrack,3cq6ld,Guardax,19,Thu Jul 9 23:27:01 2015 UTC,"Pyro  With his trusty sword 'PauseUnpause SUCKS' Pyro wanders the wasteland. He puts a pumpkin on his head after slaying a Baby Zombie. ""It's interesting that Sun Tzu's idea of battle is bloodless,"" Pyro says. ""What's a man got to do to get a tree around here, just a nice normal tree."" ""Day 57 of my soul journey across the wasteland, I have yet to encounter any life. Will I? I don't know. I'm still searching."" Pyro is upset at being taunted by a cream-colored rabbit and kills another to stop it from going mad. Pyro feels he has been unlucky, which is largely true. Nighttime and that means Pyro is in a cave. Pyro sees that Pakratt has a Notch Apple and asks to be friends. ""I need to find Pak."" Aaaaaaand he keeps caving. UHC 21: Grind Edition. Even when people don't need to, or shouldn't be. Alright, now time for the grand finale...  Pakratt  Pak takes damage from a Creeper to be at eight hearts as he realizes that swamp trees...OAK TREES. He heads down into a little cave, and finds a tiny Spider Dungeon right under the swamp. ""Spider again."" Buckets and string for Pakratt. ""I forgot that we needed apples honestly."" Only need one. He is also murdering chickens for the feathers. Was Beef shadowing Pakratt? He thanks PMC UHC for keeping his mind set on vanilla Minecraft. Pakratt is tempted to go find more gold to make a Notch Apple, and realizes he only needs six more gold. Easy mode. ""It is worth it for a Notch Apple, it is SO freaking worth it for a Notch Apple!"" Pakratt starts digging some gravel but the going is slow. Talking about that you can duel-wield torches and picks in 1.9, that's all that Pak wants in his life as he staircases to find a cave for gold. He hears noises and locates a massive gravel pit and starts getting flint for his arrow supply. Pakratt finds gold digging the gravel and swiftly avoids taking suffocation damage. It is six gold, exactly enough. ""YES!"" Getting enough flint to get maximum arrows, Pak crafts all of them up. It happens so quickly. A Notch Apple. ""Eight blocks of gold...one Notch Apple."" PAKRATT HAS CRAFTED THE SECOND NOTCH APPLE IN UHC HISTORY! I am loving it, especially his ""...NOTHING..."" in the chat. ""I did not know that was in the game, that is awesome."" Pak speculates what happens if two solo people are left, and I think the answer if that they both win. Zak's thought is an FFA fight. He digs downwards a bit more, because why not? Pakratt sees for seven levels he can upgrade his sword, so continues staircasing. He hears a bat. ""Hold still, I'm coming to you!"" No matter the Notch Apple, Pakratt finds a ravine. A skeleton hits him to 7, but as Nebris says. ""Any damage he takes...doesn't matter now.""  Wrap-Up  Can't ask for much more intrigue than a NOTCH APPLE! Who knows if people will continue to survive or if the next two episodes will hold so much death that we will know the victor at the end. Reason I say that is I will not be recapping episodes 7 and 8. I know, it sucks, but I'm going on a trip and won't be able to do bring recaps. Since I started doing recaps in UHC 9, I have recapped 105 episodes...and only missed 5. I hate missing them but it is what it is. See you guys in Episode 9, if UHC 21 is still undecided!"

mindcrack,3cplor,Thejklay,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"From watching the stream, the audio for the panels on the Main Stage was horrible. It was derailing to watch panelists repeatedly go ""wha? huh, did you say x?"" when someone asked a question."
mindcrack,3cplor,pyrodogg,3,Thu Jul 9 21:22:50 2015 UTC,"The panels that I went to that weren't in the Main Stage had brilliant audio, which was a bit jarring. For example, the Platinum Suite where they had the Redstone and Command Block (with our very own SethBling) panels had great audio that allowed for a lot of back-and-forth and general banter from the group. The Main Stage could have taken some improvements, but the Mindcrack Panel was still great. It lost a bit of the back and forth, yeah, but overall, was a brilliant little panel to go to :D"
mindcrack,3cplor,EinsteinReplica,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:57:17 2015 UTC,"The main stage was a reaaally, really big room compared to the others, though. The Platinum Suite was really quiet and didn't have any echo or anything, so I can see why the main stage would have been more problematic :("
mindcrack,3cplor,outadoc,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:46:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit disappointed with the minecon streams. Bad camera work, they didn't track who was talking or at the center of attention very well. One moment comes to mind when Lydia was introducing someone to the stage and the camera was pointing at Lydia instead of the person walking up to the stage. Having a overview of the panel/stage is better than showing the wrong thing.  On the mindcrack panel it looked like there were a lack of microphones, you want every panelist to have easy access to a mic in case they have something to say.  The streams also went offline quite alot. I'm not sure what the reason for that was, but it shouldn't be an issue at this large of a convention."
mindcrack,3cplor,Ekketlol,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:19:01 2015 UTC,The lack of microphones wasnt really an issue. We are kinda used to that and they had more than we usually get but the lack of stage monitor speakers made chat impossible.

mindcrack,3co6iv,Thejklay,3,Thu Jul 9 13:58:22 2015 UTC,All four of these ideas sound great to me! Each of them would inspire creative builds albeit in very different ways. Looking forward to the future! :D
mindcrack,3co6iv,Melkovar,19,Thu Jul 9 14:13:57 2015 UTC,"Ice Spikes - I'm picturing some crazy hollow icespike towers with ice bridges going from tower to tower amidst them. It'd be a wonderful icy paradise until it snows and then you can't see anything!  Giant Mountain - Would be cool looking, maybe you could have tunnels through the mountain akin to what Beef was doing with his marketplace in Season 4 - but with that much running water and terrain, possibly laggy and harder to traverse? That said, this one looks pretty cool!  Mushroom Forest - Isn't that almost what they have at the moment. Most of current spawn is surrounded by the Roofed Forest - and it's a giant PITA as mobs can easily spawn and it's hard to traverse. Looks cool though.  Mooshroom Island - The practical choice. No mobs spawning makes it a great choice for spawn, and the wildlife is friendly if a bit... unique. Problem would be finding one close enough to the current players, or creating a long Nether trip to get anywhere. But with silk touch and time, grass could grown, and you'd have a monster free island meaning less lag!"
mindcrack,3co6iv,Fudce,9,Thu Jul 9 13:36:21 2015 UTC,"That mountain does look really cool, I really hope it eventually gets used because that terrain is too beautifull to be left untouched.

mindcrack,3co6iv,Axnalux,6,Thu Jul 9 13:05:31 2015 UTC,"i personally prefer either Giant Mountain or Mooshroom Island. Dark forests are too common and flooded with mobs, and Ice spikes are nice, but its not too colorful and the snowfall might possibly get annoying."

mindcrack,3clzsd,wisegal99,15,Thu Jul 9 00:22:57 2015 UTC,"Somebody casually mentioned this to me, I thought they were joking and didn't check it out  Guude talking about going back to being himself and just talking about everything under the sun has me so excited. That's what made me such a massive fan of Guude in the first place, just listening to the stories. With how excited he is for the future, it should be great. Also, seems the other guy was right about moving to a new location in the area."
mindcrack,3clzsd,Arkazia,6,Wed Jul 8 23:31:30 2015 UTC,It feels like a weird joke but I am incredibly happy to have Guude caving and rambling on in my hear as I try to find a control variable for my paper.
mindcrack,3clzsd,A_WASP_ATE_MY_DICK,4,Wed Jul 8 23:34:00 2015 UTC,I think the new update is really going to light the fire under the Mindcrackers. (at least for a little while).  I'm really excited for the future!
mindcrack,3clzsd,RBR-NS_21,3,Thu Jul 9 00:23:07 2015 UTC,Kind of hoping for Pyro to get into it too. I kind of lost interest about the time he did so maybe I can start playing while watching him start playing.

I will talk about anything."" I really want him to update us all on the relationship he currently has with Rob and the Buffalo Wizards (if it's changed), and whether he'd ever be willing to make a video or partnership in any way with Rob or BWs. I know it can be a touchy subject, but like he said, he's not going to hold back to avoid drama. He's going to be himself, which is great.  Also, does anyone know if Rob is attending POC?  Edit again: I've scoured his reddit and twitter and he hasn't mentioned POC at all. Like, not anything. I'm assuming he won't be going. /u/rurikar"

Not sure if Rob is attending POC, I doubt it but lets hope if he does that they can rekindle their friendship. Here's hoping...

You'd think that since Rob loves to work on big projects he would have some sort of sympathy towards Guude and his project that has been in production for like over two(?) years now. Especially since Guude and Mindcrack as a whole had a huge part in funding Unforgotten Quest, a huge personal project of Rob's.  Guess shit happens..."

That's what I mean, that Season 4 had the best builds like the Town Hall, EthosCorp and stuff while Season 3 had more overall good builds like Beef's Castle, Zisteau's Sky thing, and Bdubs Arena."

mindcrack,3cmiet,Dravarden,35,Thu Jul 9 13:21:07 2015 UTC,I'd say they should do whatever they want.
mindcrack,3cmiet,Bratlie,15,Thu Jul 9 02:10:19 2015 UTC,"It depends on what the goal is for moving it.  If it is to reduce the lagginess of the current town area (which Kurt has shown still occurs there, making it hard to use for videos) then it's a good idea.  New town/spawn area can be planned around what is really necessary to have always loaded.  An iron farm perhaps, to take advantage of loaded state and provide resources to the community, but not a lot of other ""stuff"".  A town near the new spawn area but not directly in it can then be better planned to prevent the laggines and allow it to be more user/youtube friendly.    If it is just to jump start activity I think old patterns will repeat, but still a WAY better option than an actual reset."
mindcrack,3cmiet,K_nikk,10,Thu Jul 9 02:40:32 2015 UTC,It'd be kinda cool if they had a huge group event where they went around and made it looked abandoned and overgrown. That way if they went back to that spawn it would actually feel like a ghost town.
mindcrack,3cmiet,etan01234,21,Thu Jul 9 02:56:34 2015 UTC,"I've always thought, instead of resetting server, how about just MC edit in all the builds from season 3/4 (2 if they really want to) so they can COMPLETE all those awesome(lens) builds(arcology) that noone (fermilab) ever got (ad's hotel/casino) a chance (guude's uhc statue area) to (mothership) complete (and so on)."
mindcrack,3cmiet,Lordborgman,3,Thu Jul 9 08:44:54 2015 UTC,that would actually be cool.

mindcrack,3cmiet,Lordborgman,10,Thu Jul 9 13:25:35 2015 UTC,New spawn is the way to go.  Wish they had thought of it way back at season 3 to compromise....  The world would have been huge but amazing.
mindcrack,3cmiet,Taleric,7,Thu Jul 9 05:01:34 2015 UTC,This was suggested back in season three but they eventualy chose to start a new map because of the new terain generation.

mindcrack,3cmiet,JT70900,3,Thu Jul 9 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"If you look at the map, then it is clear that there are many places they can move it that are not super far away that you have one group on one side of the world and another on the other side.   I think they should put a new spawn somewhat close to the old one so they can still interact with the people who choose to stay behind and for Guudeland. But at the same time be far enough away so they can have their ""Fresh start"" and have room to expand.  TBH I loved the idea of the farm town and shop town, but I think they should of kept it like season 4 where all of that was at spawn and not at the corners of the world (for some time it literally was the corners of the world.) We all love community builds, but we did not see much of the community in season 5."
mindcrack,3cmiet,Skypost4ever,6,Thu Jul 9 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"See it depends. If a lot of people are into it, then they should go for it, make a new spawn and reinvigorate the Mindcrackers to play some more with some new found inspiration and some new projects that may entice them to come back to the server...  However, if that's the case, why not just wait until 1.9 and reset the map? If people are wanting to do a new spawn, wouldn't it seem like a more fun idea to just wait for 1.9 and start fresh?  That's just my opinion. I do also think that it's too early for a reset but at the same time I think a new start might be what the guys need."
mindcrack,3cmiet,rainahkarim,24,Thu Jul 9 01:58:58 2015 UTC,"The whole point of it is to get a fresh start without a reset though. Those who have ongoing projects can still work on them, while those who want a new start can have that as well."
mindcrack,3cmiet,Axium723,5,Thu Jul 9 02:07:02 2015 UTC,Guude said that the only reason the will reset is if there is a new update to the terrain like in 1.7 and 1.8.
mindcrack,3cmiet,Skypost4ever,2,Thu Jul 9 02:43:08 2015 UTC,Because there's still stuff people might want to do. Reseting has proved to be ineffective

mindcrack,3cmiet,the_schmoka,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:26:30 2015 UTC,"Personally imo, I think the current spawn concept was bonkers. To have four cardinal roads but towns on the diagonal? How does that sense? This is why the Vech road system comes to an abrupt stop.  Now I love to good collab video, but forcing them into world border was weird. It was like greed haven. People complained about Neb's ""Big"" hose at spawn and Anders claiming the whole lake.    Other idea: What if they changed the vanilla server to creative?  Mabe it's my preference for creative mode/building but it seems the lack of interest might be time related (speculating here) I know the guys(and gal) are busy with other recordings and conventions. But I'd rather see beautiful useful builds than people running around gathering materials.  Then when they are ready to play the minigames, they switch to survival and beat each other. :)"
mindcrack,3cmiet,QueenLouey,-6,Thu Jul 9 13:16:56 2015 UTC,Not to sound like a pessimist but that will do almost nothing. A small player boost for 2 months top & maybe again when the update comes out.   People could have walked a few hundred blocks on their own anytime If they really wanted to play on ther server.

mindcrack,3cmiet,W92Baj,-5,Thu Jul 9 14:40:15 2015 UTC,"Well yes, that is where the server is headed eventually Baj. Just a matter of next year or the one after.  I mean, I genuinely hope I'm wrong & everyone suddenly develops a love for vanilla minecraft again but 'resets' have not held attention for long multiple times before.  & starting a new 'town' far away from spawn is basically like resetting the server without actually doing that & that turned out well last time didn't it  Spoiler, that chart didn't get any better with time.  Enjoying your UHC perspective with Arkas btw, surprisingly enjoyable commentary & caving."
mindcrack,3cmiet,Gecoma,9,Thu Jul 9 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"We have all been playing Minecraft for pretty much 4 years. Over that time I, we and everyone else goes through periods where we are burnt out, tired or just plain bored of it.  These are phases. Yes, one day it will end and we wont play again but we don't think that is now.  We are not resetting the server because there are some people who are still on there making big projects. The irony is nobody watches them while they are busy complaining no-one makes videos on the server.  Whining about the server being dead and then whining when we do something to reignite our interest is pretty pointless. Clearly nothing we can do will satisfy you so why bother posting?"

Also creepy to know you've met me. I sure don't remember that.  Guude was also not involved in this discussion in any way.

I'm saying what I feel is the obvious, this interest in doing something with the server will not last very long (again). Sure hope you guys prove me wrong.  You even said yourself there are phases, I believe this is one.   Where as you seem to believe that the phase ""lack of interest in playing"" is the minority of the time, I believe the ""interest in actually playing"" is the minority.  So In answer to the question ""why bother posting"" I suppose my  thought process was ""I think this...... lets say this!""  & don't lecture people about whining literally one sentence after you whine that no one watches your stuff.

There are plenty of discussions about that by now (it is sure not NOT allowed, but at some point doesn't bring anything new or interesting information). The guys who left are part of the mindcrack ""history"" or legacy. Their achievments and contributions should be by no means forgotten. 2. We normally record the UHC a week or so before we release the episodes. This gives all people enough time to upload and then schedule the videos so they can all come out at the same time.  I hope that answers your questions."
mindcrack,3coy2y,docm77,4,Thu Jul 9 22:33:49 2015 UTC,"1 So to get things straight you are talking about content that was made when they were still mindcrackers, for example UHCs or Mindcrack videos?   If yes than I think it is still allowed because the content is Mindcrack related as it was produced by Mindcrackers (at the time of production).  Also these kind of questions are better suited for the weekly small questions thread or by messaging the moderators."
mindcrack,3coy2y,Compieuter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:54:50 2015 UTC,"For question 2, videos must process before you can upload them. All the participants in a UHC usually process the video ahead of time and just wait until 6:00 p.m. EST to click the actual upload button.  Even with that, some of the participants' videos don't upload on time! It's a very hard job to upload videos at an exact time so some players may not get the video up exactly at 6."

Whenever Nebris fights someone who has a Notch Apple on he likes to ender pearl away because it nullifies the effects of the Notch Apple.  Now, Pakratt is awfully close to a Notch Apple. My theory is that Nebs and Vechs get into a fight with a God mode Pakratt and Nebris dies to Pak in a melee fight. Realising that Pak is god mode, Nebs tells Vechs to ender pearl away from him and just run until the Notch wears off... instead of ender pearling to safety, Vechs ender pearls right into Pakratt and dies to melee. And that's the story of Pakratt's first two (non-team) UHC kills."

But of the rest who have any kind of decent gear right now, I can't think of a single one I'd expect him to lose to.  He should outshoot them; and while melee is a crapshoot (and I haven't seen Pakratt show anything outstanding in streams), his armor and the fire aspect sword should give an edge.  His problem, simply, is being solo against teams.  That's going to be rough going for anyone, and Pakratt does not have a self-preservation gene in combat."

And if you don't really know what I mean watch Huahwi or ItsAustennn, they are gods at melee. Im just saying that while some Mindcrackers are slightly better skilled at melee (Baj, BTC, Guude but he's dead, Anderz, Pause, Avidya, and Pyr0),it isn't gonna be a hugely visible difference.

I think there is a pretty good chance of a fight next episode. It's about the time when people will want to start wetting their swords and the natural instinct when that time comes is head to the middle, if multiple people do this (like Pyro already has) then a fight is all but certain."

But between Beef's Great Escape, Pakratt's latent Notch Apple, and Pyro's Castle... I think the three single competitors will continue to be a joy to watch.  As for predictions? If Pyro sees Pause, he'll most likely engage given his sword name. My best guess on the outcome is that Pyro dies after slaying Aureylian -- Pyro will still get the satisfaction of Pause seeing the sword name in the chat.  Team Grylls seems content to cave, as makes sense for their situation.  Team Red Shirt? BTC continues to have stress over damage, enough said.  Team Breadcrumbs? The thing will happen either later on in this episode, or in the next, I am predicting. The thing likely has to do with TNT.  Regardless of where it happens... given Vechs' hint, my guess is that a Notch-Apple'd player is going to warp in w. Maybe the TNT will see play here?  Pakratt... I hope he goes for the Notch Apple, and I hope he gets to use it... and I will admit to having a corny hope that he names the pertinent episode Agnus Dei, to sort of go along with Nebris's naming scheme. Also, I really like the track.  Team Chill will continue to be chill, and bring us that relaxing commentary. I do not really have any pinpoint prediction on who they'll go after, though...  And I think that just leaves Beef. He's recovering really well after a fantastic escape, and he might just come back to make Team Breadcrumbs (or its remnants) regret not finishing him off.  No matter what happens though, I think this UHC is shaping up for a very nice climax.  P.S., I have no idea how Anderz should name his Notch Apple episode, if he has one. Sorry, Anderz, but I've got nothing ATM.   EDIT: Huh, I guess it's my cake day?  EDIT 2: I realize Anderz getting Notch Apple Gold is not exactly the most likely event, but it just feels right for the Lepre-Viking."

mindcrack,3cl0eu,AwesomeName7,39,Wed Jul 8 19:58:46 2015 UTC,*allowed
mindcrack,3cl0eu,gerfboy,8,Wed Jul 8 20:11:22 2015 UTC,Perhaps they're allowed and the reason they're not on isn't because they don't feel welcome but because they weren't (as well as nearly every other Mindcracker) on anyway.   Though it would be pretty awkward if the only person doing major consistent work on the Mindcrack server isn't even allowed to call themselves a Mindcracker.
mindcrack,3cl0eu,wandering_ones,4,Wed Jul 8 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"I believe that the members that left are still allowed on the server, but can't monetize (AKA Make videos) on it.  Even if it's not a set-in-stone rule, it's probably frowned upon (or just uncomfortable for the creators themselves) because Mindcrack is more of a company now. It would be like going in to an office building that you used to work at to jumpstart your new company, and run operations in the same cubicle that you used to work in, surrounded by your old company."

mindcrack,3cl0eu,Garizondyly,5,Thu Jul 9 06:38:54 2015 UTC,"No it isnt, although I am probably in a better place to than most of you.   /u/wandering_ones said 'perhaps... they dont feel welcome' which is speculative and a bit negative. I was merely responding that perhaps that isnt the reason. There is no reason why they should feel that way"
mindcrack,3cl0eu,W92Baj,3,Thu Jul 9 14:31:34 2015 UTC,"Though I understood your meaning, I think you misread their message. OP was speculating that they do feel welcome to play, but just aren't interested: ""Perhaps ...the reason...isn't because they don't feel welcome."" The syntax was a little strange and there's like four negatives in one sentence, but this is what OP meant. Your comment saying ""perhaps not"" then implies that they do have interest in playing but don't feel welcome."

I was hoping for the exact opposite of what was interpreted. Believe me, I don't want to encourage any more negativity to the groups inner workings than already exists.   Dem double negatives."
mindcrack,3cl0eu,wandering_ones,2,Thu Jul 9 23:12:10 2015 UTC,"Well it says ""the reason they're not on ISN'T because they feel unwelcome"" so I don't think I misread it. Confusing sentence, but the meaning is there."

mindcrack,3cl0eu,rockycraft,133,Wed Jul 8 19:01:09 2015 UTC,"Mindcrack became a bussiness is also one of the things I see circling around here quite often. That is also not correct.  We wanted a group fund so we can go to conventions together. Not all mindcrackers make enough money to be able to afford to go to conventions. Our main goal is to make it possible for the smaller channels in the group to be able to take part in our group activities.  To be able to get a group fund, we needed to be able to negotiate with sponsers as a UNITY, so we can use the pull and power of our bigger channels to cover the smaller ones. That is it. Nothing more, nothing less.  Now we can approach companies and say: Look ,we have 20+ channels and we operate as a group with so and so many views. This way, the smaller guys are always included. If everyone negotiates for themselves, the smaller channels have no chance of getting anything. That is it.  Now you can make up your own mind, what that means for the guys who left. For example in etho's case, it is nothing that is of any personal interest for him as he never goes to any conventions nor plans to go in the future."
mindcrack,3cl0eu,docm77,87,Wed Jul 8 21:22:24 2015 UTC,"Just to add: people talk about the contract like we were asking for Mindcrackers first-born or something. All it was is a contract to say a) We can use the trademarked identity in our videos and b) Our names and likenesses can be used by 'Mindcrack'  What this means in reality is that if an opportunity like the Superfight cards arises, we can discuss it and vote on it as to whether we want to be involved. If we do A contract is signed, not 25. Things like that only work if we are all in agreement and all involved. A set of Mindcrack Superfight cards, for example, with a few members missing would be ridiculous.   Mainly, as Doc said we are trying to get more of us to meet more of you."

And that is 100% fair. Genny is taking care of his mother in law, and that too is fair. Etho as you mentioned isn't going to any cons, and so there is no gain for him either. Paul and thejims i have no idea, but that is their thing, and they can tell you if they want.  Let's not forget that they can all still play on the Mindcrak server. And they can all join UHC, and all the other stuff.  All that has changed is that they no longer go under the name of a ""Mindcracker"". That's it!

mindcrack,3cl0eu,wandering_ones,2,Wed Jul 8 21:27:18 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, Doc and Baj commenting on it? That's awesome. I didn't mean to start a shitstorm though! I mean, I think it's just the overall community's view that they want to know why the individuals who left, to come out and say why they left, you know? I think everyone is behind the ""collaborative group to go to cons and meet viewers"" but it's more of the ""why do these other ex-mindcrackers not have the same view, which caused them to leave the brand"" which is what's urking the viewers."
mindcrack,3cl0eu,Absynthexx,5,Wed Jul 8 22:58:03 2015 UTC,Asking a question shouldn't cause a shitstorm. Truth is some people were interested in the contract and others were not with varying reasons (of varying intensity).
mindcrack,3cl0eu,Tatermen,19,Wed Jul 8 23:10:15 2015 UTC,"So from my understanding there was no drama correct? Just a different, collaborative approach to Mindcrack was suggested and certain members of Mindcrack didnt want to or could not keep up with those expectations.   I imagine Bdoubleo's excuse was most likely family preoccupations? Did PSJ, GennyB and the others give reasons or was that blogpost the one true explanation and that was it?"
mindcrack,3cl0eu,docm77,26,Wed Jul 8 19:08:35 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say precisely all the factors but if there was any drama, it has been the best kept secret in history. I suspect it was just people following their own paths as things mature. Genny for example was phasing out of minecraft entirely which would certainly be a cause for concern if signing onto the Mindcrack brand.  I miss them too."
mindcrack,3cl0eu,Tatermen,10,Wed Jul 8 19:15:35 2015 UTC,"Genny for example was phasing out of minecraft entirely    He mentioned in a recent video (one of his lego building ones) that he disagrees with the concept of Youtuber networks for a number of reasons, and in his view Mindcrack was changing from a community into a network."
mindcrack,3cl0eu,gabriel3374,37,Wed Jul 8 20:45:55 2015 UTC,Him leaving has noting to do with Mindcrack network. This really bothers me. Never ever was there the obligation to join any network at all. I want to point that out very clearly.
mindcrack,3cl0eu,WorldLinx,17,Wed Jul 8 21:13:53 2015 UTC,"I had to go back and rewatch the video, but his thoughts and reasons seem quite clear. vid   It got to a point where they asked us to sign a legal agreement. It was marked as a trademark agreement, but there was a lot of other stuff within it. Uh, that, y'know... I knew that this type of stuff was happening, I knew that they were to make a network, and you guys know how I feel about networks. But I was like, you know, they can do their thing, and I'll just kinda... I joined Mindcrack to hang out with people. Especially Bdubs. But, hang out with people that I know and that I respect and are friends with, and uh, I'm not really in it to be a corporation. And so, it got to the point where they said this is the official... you have to sign this trademark agreement or you can't be considered a member of Mindcrack.   EDIT: Obviously we don't know what goes on behind the scenes, and I'm not passing personal judgement on Mindcrack's changes. I'm just saying that Genny seems to be clearly saying that he left because Mindcrack was becoming a network, and he wasn't otherwise allowed to remain a member."
mindcrack,3cl0eu,Compieuter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:42:38 2015 UTC,I would love some more transparency...
mindcrack,3cl0eu,docm77,23,Thu Jul 9 11:07:48 2015 UTC,"From the official announcement:   It is important to note that not all Mindcrackers were interested in continuing with Mindcrack as a business. For reasons inherent with the new group strategy, these members agreed that continued membership was just not in their best interest.    Maybe this doesn't mean they had to join the youtube network, but they had to be part of something else that could put them under the Mindcrack trademark. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what Tatermen said wasn't false.  EDIT: Just read your other comment, and you said ""Mindcrack became a bussiness is also one of the things I see circling around here quite often. That is also not correct."" This is pretty much the opposite of what is said in the announcement."
mindcrack,3cl0eu,Absynthexx,6,Wed Jul 8 21:28:36 2015 UTC,"A trademark agreement does not equal a network, I think Doc himself knows best because iirc he is not a part of the mindcrack network but he did sign the trademark agreement."

mindcrack,3cl0eu,rock_buster,2,Thu Jul 9 06:57:41 2015 UTC,"Again there are surely many individual reasons, but I have not seen any evidence of drama or bad blood. Disagreements are obviously likely in some shape or form."
mindcrack,3cl0eu,wandering_ones,16,Thu Jul 9 08:46:34 2015 UTC,"BdoubleO discussed it briefly in a video on his channel; you can look it up.  Other than expressing his sadness about it more clearly than you'd get from anything on the Mindcrack side, it doesn't add any information.  Etho talked about it in slightly more detail in a stream back then; the stream is long gone from Twitch, but you should be able to find a transcript on /r/ethoslab if you look hard enough.  To my knowledge none of the others has said anything.  A couple of the Mindcrackers (Chad, Vechs) talked about it a little in server videos right after it was announced -- they personalize the basic information a bit more from their perspectives, but don't really add anything either.  Etho still has some visible ties to Mindcrack members -- several small collabs with Doc, a current series with Zisteau -- but the others haven't, to date.  No visible drama, but obviously not a happy situation either for at least a few."

mindcrack,3cl1es,O_xD,5,Thu Jul 9 13:11:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand how the whole Rules that Matter thing works, I'm just spitballing here and trying to shoehorn it into Cities: Skylines.  ¯\(ツ)/¯"
mindcrack,3cl1es,lorderunion,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:24:46 2015 UTC,"i think a rule per square is good, so old rules continue and new rules apply only to new squares."
mindcrack,3cl1es,O_xD,2,Wed Jul 8 23:54:16 2015 UTC,How can a single rule for each square not be enough(which is 9 by default) but 10 rules be fine?
mindcrack,3cl1es,Grantus89,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:05:40 2015 UTC,"Because 10 rules will be applied to the whole thing, but one rule for each square isn't enough restrictions. So you can't make a new freeway in a square, big whoop."
mindcrack,3cl1es,lorderunion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:29:19 2015 UTC,"I think the idea was that a new rule would be added every time a square is bought, but that every rule would still apply to everything. Not that each rule would only effect one square."
mindcrack,3cl1es,Grantus89,14,Thu Jul 9 18:49:10 2015 UTC,"All right, I like that! Solved the traffic and it looks pretty.  Maybe next time make the montage a bit slower? It was really fast.  Again I will mention the Extended Public Transit UI mod, it's in the same vein as that building upgrade UI mod, and I found it invaluable in making an effective and efficient public transportation system."
mindcrack,3cl1es,Neamow,5,Wed Jul 8 19:58:52 2015 UTC,Beautiful intersection! foliage really does make a difference!
mindcrack,3cl1es,byenseven,4,Wed Jul 8 19:53:23 2015 UTC,Montage was really cool! Feel free to do more of that if you think it's necessary. It works well with this series.

mindcrack,3ckef3,zarotte,26,Wed Jul 8 16:27:37 2015 UTC,SethBling's POV of Season 17 is pretty good. He explains what he's doing to fill the gap caused by a lack of a teammate.
mindcrack,3ckef3,rock_buster,16,Wed Jul 8 16:38:12 2015 UTC,"Season 17 definitely, you get to see what the most overpowered thing in the game does, also you get to see what a god apple does as well :D"
mindcrack,3ckef3,xSebtho,3,Wed Jul 8 17:06:26 2015 UTC,I'm just wondering when Da Bone is gonna nerf Nebris.
mindcrack,3ckef3,readonlypdf,10,Wed Jul 8 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"He did, but he's just cheated his way back to being overpowered..."
mindcrack,3ckef3,blazefort,3,Wed Jul 8 19:13:46 2015 UTC,He already nerfed Doc. The Zipkrowd put him back together though.
mindcrack,3ckef3,ercsredditaccount,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:31:03 2015 UTC,"I reckon he's already tried, but failed"
mindcrack,3ckef3,xSebtho,15,Wed Jul 8 19:20:18 2015 UTC,"Season 10, because it just told a good story."
mindcrack,3ckef3,algis31,6,Wed Jul 8 16:31:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you can't start with the best, then there's nowhere to go but down!  Personally I'd say 1 -- start at the very beginning (watch Beef I guess), 3 -- start at the pvp beginning (show the good parts from Pause, Beef and Kurt, finishing up with Kurt), or if you just want to whet your victim's appetite, pick a perspective that's unusually funny or intense from the beginning -- even or maybe especially if they die quick -- and go from there."
mindcrack,3ckef3,BlueCyann,5,Wed Jul 8 19:49:33 2015 UTC,Kurt's boating moves on team MAN is still up there along the best UHC moments. I was so cool.
mindcrack,3ckef3,vmachiel,3,Wed Jul 8 20:53:52 2015 UTC,"IKR, I've seen it from PiMP's perspective and I'm going to watch it from every other perspective because it is so damn good."

mindcrack,3ckef3,Asiracy,3,Thu Jul 9 16:13:57 2015 UTC,Definitely PauseUnpause.  I don't want to spoil anything.
mindcrack,3ckef3,random_person22,3,Wed Jul 8 16:49:47 2015 UTC,I'd say MC. There's one episode of his in particular that is really well done (can't say any more for fear of spoilers).
mindcrack,3ckef3,Dannflor,5,Wed Jul 8 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Season 11 tells an even better story. Especially if you watch Bdubs and Etho's perspectives. You get down to the final 5-6, each op in their own ways. Guude's dogs, Bdub's potions, Zisteau's fort, Anderz' enchants. Not to mention Bdubs witnessing the double kill, and then leaving behind a potion for Etho, which ends up killing him. And Etho deducing Bdubs has potions.  It tells a very exciting story. Plus, the underdog wins in the end."
mindcrack,3ckef3,le_wumbo,2,Wed Jul 8 19:18:25 2015 UTC,Etho's perspective of hunting down Bdubs with the bow and then having to act quick when Guude comes straight after is one of the most exciting bits in UHC in my opinion.
mindcrack,3ckef3,nbtrainor,14,Thu Jul 9 08:22:12 2015 UTC,"I think SethBling or OldmanWillakers' Season 13 POV is really good. Its comical, they use very good tactics, and its just a crazy season for them."
mindcrack,3ckef3,Emperor_PPP,13,Wed Jul 8 17:44:49 2015 UTC,"Might as well start from UHC 1, the very beginning. The first two seasons are very different but they're still a great watch."
mindcrack,3ckef3,bluscoutnoob,5,Wed Jul 8 16:43:23 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see a season like that again, minus the PvP."
mindcrack,3ckef3,bookworm2692,2,Wed Jul 8 17:59:53 2015 UTC,You would have to get a LOT less players though
mindcrack,3ckef3,bluscoutnoob,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:37:04 2015 UTC,It could be a collaborative effort amongst as many people as they could get together.
mindcrack,3ckef3,bookworm2692,2,Thu Jul 9 02:22:28 2015 UTC,Yeah. But the Skype call would be crazy
mindcrack,3ckef3,Marluck,5,Thu Jul 9 02:58:48 2015 UTC,Etho's POV of Season 8 was how I got started. Also BDoubleO's POV of season 11 is one of the best.
mindcrack,3ckef3,Countersync,5,Wed Jul 8 17:04:34 2015 UTC,"The other thing to remember is that Minecraft game mechanics have changed, sometimes by quite a bit, over the years.  Zisteau is doing a good job of documenting that in his single player series though cow-boats is a (simple) mod.  As far as UHCs go, my favorites tend to be the ones that include the dragon fight; the addition of that rule provides some pressure to actually face mobs and achieve the objective as a more sure way of winning."
mindcrack,3ckef3,cayen,5,Wed Jul 8 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"personally I loved UHC 3, the first combat UHC."
