This discussion has lead to confusion over what the Umbra excalibur, Nikana, etc etc. Therefore, we have had a discussion with DE in that effect.  As Rebecca has mentioned, we will be release a series of Umbra warframes (not skins), it is possible that there will be an umbra excalibur as the first of the umbra series however the ""Originator's"" (which means founder) umbra excalibur prime will not be commonly available. The Umbra Excalibur Prime is an exclusive warframe developed by DE for the Chinese version of warframe and is only available to ""Originators"". This warframe will not appear in game to purchase under the market nor will it drop in game. We (Changyou) and DE has finalized and agreed on this and will not be changing our position on this.  In other developments, the Prime (samurai blade or Nikana) and Prime (drill/screw Kunai) will not be on sale in the market and neither will it drop for China warframe players. These weapon are also exclusive to China warfame ""Originators"".On the international side however, these weapons will be released under an unknown format (might be event? market? Prime Access or anything that DE can think up of) after China warframe's Originator's pack sale have concluded."""
Warframe,3e3n0w,Crooodle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:23 2015 UTC,Do we know if it's going to be plat only or if it will be possible to get like any other warframe?
Warframe,3e3n0w,Socknic,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:37:16 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I don't know. Maybe on Friday during Devstream DE will give us more informations.
Warframe,3e3n0w,Crooodle,4,Tue Jul 21 20:04:09 2015 UTC,"The best case scenario which I would admittedly find highly unlikely would be if regular Excal Umbra was just like EUPrime but the gold bits coloured a different colour and recolourable.   Since DE (or just Rebecca, at least) seems to love abusing loopholes as of late."
Warframe,3e3n0w,KIREEKPSO,2,Tue Jul 21 19:19:50 2015 UTC,"I could be completely wrong, but it looks like DE and ChangYou have a conflict of interest. In Rebecca's post, she clearly states that we will eventually have access to everything we've seen in the pictures. This implies that we would be getting the same Excalibur Umbra as the Chinese audience. However, I could understand if ChangYou wants to start things off with a big Chinese exclusive, yet DE doesn't necessarily agree."
Warframe,3e3n0w,Magoo111,-13,Tue Jul 21 19:40:51 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression from reading both posts that we're getting Umbra Excal while China gets a Prime verson of it, since the chinese site listed it specifically as ""Umbra Prime Excalibur"" while Rebecca's post never included ""Prime"" in the name of the one we'll get. The ChangYou post further reinforces that China is getting an exclusive Prime version of the Umbra varient that we will get.  Only time will tell what's for sure, since it could very well be as you have stated, and Rebecca just accidentally neglected to include that the Umbra frames will all also have prime gold bits."

Warframe,3e17ws,brandonjohn5,4,Tue Jul 21 05:37:27 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of that being a thing. I believe at the moment MR 8 is the highest ranked required to have a weapon, the dragon nikana.

She's working hard but im playing Warframe :p I got my friend into the game too and we play for hours every night. I'll probably reach Mastery rank 4 in the next few days and prime stuff/plat would help me explore more with my friend. I'll check back to see how you do your raffle!

Warframe,3e17ws,vagabond_dilldo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:00:19 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I'm not really a new player, just someone who participated in the closed and open beta until my last gaming PC crapped out for good and only recently got back into it. Just hit MR4 this weekend, still looking to find a clan to run with and such. Haven't yet gotten any prime sets (or even parts), mostly because back when I left I was terrified of the Orokin Void and thought soloing would be impossible, and also the utter lack of keys.  I understand that you're probably not really looking for someone such as myself, but I'd appreciate anything you can give. If you'd like me to PM you, feel free to comment (or PM me yourself, I guess. That might actually be easier, on further consideration).   Best of luck on your PhD, and sorry to see you leave! Hardly my place to give advice (as I've never really done a PhD :P ) but I'd recommend not giving everything away just so you can come back to something if you regret leaving gaming. I once did something similar and deeply regretted it when I got back into TCGs two years ago."
Warframe,3e17ws,mwmorph,2,Tue Jul 21 06:11:58 2015 UTC,"Welcome back! I'll get in touch with people when I iron out my rules/details.   As for giving up gaming... I have several hobbies that I would love to spend more time on. I love the original stories and fun gameplay, but ultimately there's a voice in the back of my head telling me that I could be more productive...."
Warframe,3e17ws,Lilliannette,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:24:39 2015 UTC,"I hear that same voice all the time, and I totally understand. I just hated the regret I had when coming back and wanted to at least share my experience as a warning."

Just got MR5 after having a year and a half long hiatus from Warframe, then looked back and realised how much potential fun this game had. It really is a bit discouraging to new players when you can't seem to do enough for your team just because you don't have enough mods and such, for example I had only gotten serration 70 hours in ;_;  Anyway thanks again for doing this, and good luck on your PhD!"
Warframe,3e17ws,VengeanceReturns,2,Tue Jul 21 06:37:46 2015 UTC,Oh what a nice thing to do. Warframe has a nice community and I found that out on day 1 :).How can I participate?
Warframe,3e17ws,TheHoblit,2,Tue Jul 21 10:48:30 2015 UTC,"I wish you luck on your schooling, it is pretty responsible to give up games to focus your attention on your academics, definitely something i'd have trouble with, so I commend you. I think it's awesome that there are people like you in Warframe willing to share their wealth with newbies. Today marks the first of many, many weeks I'll be playing this game. I've almost reached MR4 and built my first Warframe (Valkyr) the other day. I am currently trying to craft more weapons and better mods so that I can get to my main goal.. Nekros. I was hoping to have Nekros be my first frame but Valkyr was pretty easy to get and I figured she would help my mastery as well considering I have to do OD missions for him. I have learned it is most likely not the best Idea to try and level a new frame and 3 new weapons at the same time, but I am getting by. As I advance farther in this game I hope to do as you do and spread my wealth and knowledge to those who need it, and create my own guild."
Warframe,3e17ws,Mistywing,2,Tue Jul 21 12:12:50 2015 UTC,"I just want to remind you that newbies can't trade until they are MR2, and they would need to pay for trade tax, so you might want to put MR2-5 in your raffle requirements."

Just telling you, you're more of a man than I. Couldn't possibly let my account go even though I really probably should take a break from gaming to focus on irl stuff... I just can't do it. D:"
Warframe,3e17ws,TheHoblit,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:09 2015 UTC,"You seem like a very reflective and practical sort of person - I respect your discipline.  The world is full of potential, which makes it both delightful and stressful for people like you.  I wish you good luck in your endeavours.  I picked this game up over a year ago, played obsessively because my friends told me it was cool, bought a xp boost and grinded it out because ""you get the good stuff at lv.6"", got to 6, got a Soma to 30, lost interest, put it down.  It probably didn't help that I only had a couple of people to team up with.  Picked it back up a week ago after being harassed by some gaming pals.  It seems to have gotten a lot better.  Probably going to stick with it for a while this time, think I burned out before."
Warframe,3e17ws,Mistywing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:02 2015 UTC,"Best of luck to you with pursuing that PhD! Life definitely comes before Warframe.  I am definitely interested in the raffle; I just recently hit MR5 and kinda feel like I hit a wall with my ability to up my damage, whether by upgrading mods or getting a new primary weapon, which is why I have been playing only on and off. I am back for now and definitely looking forward to what I missed since I stopped playing. Hopefully everything works out for the best!"

Warframe,3e17ws,beto5243,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:01:30 2015 UTC,"Most warframes drop from assassination missions, with some from completing quests in your codex.    Their blueprints are rather easy to acquire, with a 38/38/22% drop chance split for all the ones that drop except Nekros who has 33/33/33% for each part. The blueprints for the Warframe itself is on the market, purchased with credits. You will need to farm some resources to fully build a Warframe, but then you just have to wait for the build process to complete.    As a bonus, the more warframes you have the more revives per day you get! (4 per frame)"
Warframe,3e17ws,Milinky,3,Tue Jul 21 05:08:02 2015 UTC,i googled it and most warframes do drop from bosses... then how do you get those Golden prime frames? they look cool
Warframe,3e17ws,DisaccharideCubes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:21:31 2015 UTC,"Primestuff only drops in the void and is in fact significantly harder to acquire in general. If you are just starting out, see if you get lucky in this giveaway but otherwise try not to worry about it too much, or at least don't make it your main objective quite yet because it isn't supposed to be.  But you may look here and on related pages for more information."
Warframe,3e17ws,ComplainyGuy,2,Tue Jul 21 05:28:24 2015 UTC,"huh, thanks!"
Warframe,3e17ws,damo190,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:04:01 2015 UTC,Mistywing got it right. Buying warframe slots are the best use of platinum. That's assuming you're here for the long haul.
Warframe,3e17ws,buzzking00,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:25:46 2015 UTC,"You'll fill those slots. Having all the frames isn't necessary. It will make you more valuable to a clan and give you new play styles and strategies. However, you do not NEED to have all of the frames. Pay attention to how people request certain frames and load outs when building a team. Watch how different frames function best in certain roles and strive to be that part of a team.   My best advice is to join public games and learn from the other players. They will make you better."

Warframe,3e2793,Taseir,3,Tue Jul 21 15:55:37 2015 UTC,"For the most part, I'd have to agree. I'm currently taking a break from LoL (and Destiny, but that's another story), largely because I didn't care for the extremely toxic environment and community.  Most of the people I've interacted with so far have been fairly polite, and I even found a small, friendly clan to join. This sub seems great as well.  However, I have had a few lousy experiences in-game (most recently, some guy started verbally abusing our team's Frost in a defense mission for not using the 'right' energy color). The chatrooms are also concerning, from what I've seen so far; Region is full of trolls, Recruiting is pretty elitist (seems to be a very similar situation to the Destiny LFG sites; lots of people demanding things like Mastery 12+ only), and Trading is a literal shark tank.  I don't mean to rain on the parade at all, and I love that we're trying to have a positive attitude here, but please, we should try to both fix the bad, and celebrate the good."
Warframe,3e2793,TSP-FriendlyFire,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:26 2015 UTC,"I learnt first-hand about the chat today, that was agony.  I'm glad that the subreddit here is much more helpful through.  Are clan recruitments really that elitist? I haven't even started looking into it :/ I just want to find a group of friendly people who get pissy at me for sucking :p"
Warframe,3e2793,AmGeraffeAMA,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:43 2015 UTC,"The Recruit channel is generally used to form squads for some particular mission type, not so much clan recruitment.  You'll get people asking for Conclave rating or some other bullcrap, usually just so they avoid getting someone who doesn't know what they're doing in a hard mission. At least, that used to be the case; now people ask for end-tier loadouts for a T1S, nevermind how poor Conclave/MR is for rating a player's experience."
Warframe,3e2793,Vilmond,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:36 2015 UTC,"I think most of us will expect a certain level of player for higher tier endless missions, it's not really elitist. If you're grinding for a Rot C drop with random chat players you want a team that should be able to do at least 2 full rotations.  If you post up T3surv 40mins min, you will often get one or two MR3 with a Mk1 Paris giving the void a go for the first time. It's not a bad thing, they just don't know that they can't do it. So with your key, you spec the entry requirements to avoid wasting time. New players will often head to the exit early, and if someone else decides they've also had enough you're screwed.  When most people host T1/2's or any T non endless it's open for anyone. If you see requirements for a T1/2 listed it's not a bad thing either, they're just struggling at their limit so need someone that can pull their weight at that level.  Recruiting moves fast enough that there is something for everyone in there. If there's not, host it."
Warframe,3e2793,SgtPepperjack,4,Tue Jul 21 18:03:20 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you might be playing on console if you play Destiny, that could be an issue.    Region is basically just ""general"" chat renamed.  It has everything and anything.  Recruiting is a mixed bag in my experience, often times it will have that solid clan group looking for a +1-2 for a hard mission and want to make sure they don't pick up a scrublord, though at the same time there are loads of people just looking for void groups and don't really care too much unless you are actively terrible."

Warframe,3e2793,DrawingJacob,4,Tue Jul 21 16:06:41 2015 UTC,"I have to full-heartedly agree. A while back when Excal's rework was released, I was still only about MR 3. I was playing a defense mission on Mercury to test his new features. There was an MR 17 founder with excal prime testing him as well and noticed that I was using an un-skinned excal. After the game was over he added and bought me Excalibur Proto. I could not express the joy and happiness it brought me. 150 platinum is quite a bit to spend on a random noob too. Nowadays I try to help out wherever/whenever I can and provide new players with mods and other things that they might need or are having troubles with attaining.

There were a few ""lern2wiki"" etc etc replies, but there was this one elitist asshole acting indignant in the chat saying that my question annoyed him, and that Warframe isn't an MMO and you can't just make a new character like on a shitty fantasy game. He made a few other comments and just acted like a douche.   I eventually got a helpful response. After all that I decided to check the subreddit for Warframe, and thankfully the community here is amazing and restored my faith in the game. I am still a little dubious about playing with randoms, but I am eager to find a friendly clan to join and play with.   Sorry for the wall of text.

Warframe,3e2793,BuildMyPaperHeart,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:05 2015 UTC,"If I may: I think many people are worried that PvP content risks turning Warframe's community into another LoL cesspool. PvP games are notorious for having a significantly more toxic community than PvE games since the competitive nature of the game exacerbates the notion of winning or losing. PvP players also often have a ""high and mighty"" attitude with PvE players, considering them less skilled or plain scared of going to the ""real"" game (EVE calls PvE players carebears).  Warframe is still a place where PvE is the main focus of the game and where people who have zero interest in PvP can congregate without being called wimps."
Warframe,3e2793,Ecksplisit,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"PvP players also often have a ""high and mighty"" attitude with PvE players, considering them less skilled or plain scared of going to the ""real"" game (EVE calls PvE players carebears).   Except we don't here. The only victims of hate have been us PvPers. We have never said anything to downplay the PvE aspect of the game. Hell, it's the whole reason we started playing in the first place. It's because of this predisposition that we are repeatedly looked down upon, when in fact the real toxic players are the PvE'ers . (Of course I'm not talking about all PvE'ers, just the ones that have this strange hate towards PvP. Many of you actually don't care and leave us alone, which is great.)  For example, I saw someone here complain heavily that the Daikyu was possibly created just for PvP as a high risk high reward weapon. They said because it was designed for PvP, he hated it and felt it should have never been in the game. I reasoned with him saying that there are many ""mastery fodder"" weapons in the game, so why hate on the one that actually has use in PvP? He had no real rebuttal. He would rather have one that's useless in both PvE and PvP than one that's designed especially for PvP.   Warframe is still a place where PvE is the main focus of the game and where people who have zero interest in PvP can congregate without being called wimps.   I agree that PvE is the main focus of the game. However now that PvP has been added, it just can't be ignored. Why should a decent portion of the community be stifled just because of some kind of PvE elitism? Why can't PvE and PvP live in harmony? I don't understand why all of this hate is artificially created just as a defense mechanism against ""possible"" toxicity. It's just making the community more toxic as a whole.  Another example, World of Warcraft started as a heavily PvE focused game. Large open world with difficult dungeons and raids that required a lot of teamwork between guilds. PvP appeared as a casual system, not meant to be anything more than that (think Conclaves pre rework). Then they saw people who wanted a more sophisticated PvP system, so they created ranked arenas and ranked battlegrounds. At first people fought and said that the game should be more PvE focused, and PvP would ruin the game. Sound familiar? Look at WoW now. It's one of the biggest games of all time and both PvP and PvE live in harmony.   TL;DR PvE players that hate on PvP are the only toxic ones here. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean you should force your opinion on others."

Perhaps a weekly featured streamer thread as well as PvP discussion would be good. I always thought a monthly PvP tournament would do wonders for growing the community and provide great video content at the same time. Having a stickied thread gives awareness to content like PvP and streams. Normally they're downvoted and rarely seen on the front page."
Warframe,3e2793,Dialup1991,0,Tue Jul 21 18:42:03 2015 UTC,So like a weekly thread about Streams or PvP? That sounds interesting! We'll bounce that around and see if we can come up with something that's consistent in quality and would stand up to the test of time!

Warframe,3e29ol,monk1junk1,4,Tue Jul 21 13:56:53 2015 UTC,"I believe many of the artistic choices were made to appeal to the modern day asian market. The shapes, flow of the model and the way the scarf seems to fold around the neck and flow down the body all remind me of the aesthetics of those mysterious lone swordsman type characters that seem to be the asian equivalent of a cowboy. I found a drawing of the sort of character it gives me the vibe of. Much of the asian demographic that the game is shooting for seems infatuated with these kind of characters, so using them as artistic inspiration makes sense. I think they look ridiculous, but something along the lines of the surcoat you suggested wouldn't be as successful in the asian market as they would not find it as relatable, given the european/mediterranean style. I understand the design choices of the frame itself, play your market, but the production quality on the video is so... meh. Less than meh almost. Perhaps the chinese market diggs the tacky lighting and cheesy poses, but personally if this video was the first I'd seen of warframe, I wouldn't have a very high opinion of the game."

If i log on WF, chances are im trying to advance my account in some way, cores, keys, ducats, weapons. AW doesnt provide much to do but waste time. I find it fun, but it needs to tie into main game more."
Warframe,3e10wp,GameQb11,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:48:48 2015 UTC,I think it's good it doesn't. If they put core rewards on arcwing then people like me that absolutely hate it would be forced to play it.
Warframe,3e10wp,RectumExplorer--,5,Tue Jul 21 07:47:10 2015 UTC,"Why would you be forced to play it? Do you not know how Triton, interception, or excavation missions work?"
Warframe,3e10wp,tgdm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:56:50 2015 UTC,he means forced in the sense that if it's potentially more effective than ground missions then it would be inefficient to not play it
Warframe,3e10wp,JustAn0ther,3,Tue Jul 21 13:28:15 2015 UTC,"and? triton is already efficient as heck. 6 minutes easily gets you 2x Core rolls + a key. if you hate archwing so much, just stick to ground missions since it's highly unlikely the archwing version of excavation would be half of that (and if it was - it's 3 minutes of more fun for you vs not wanting to do something). and we already know archwing interception takes just about as long as standard interception as well."
Warframe,3e10wp,tgdm,-18,Tue Jul 21 13:37:33 2015 UTC,"I think he means that if they MOVED core rewards into archwing rather than put. Like, if the only way to get T4E keys were to do archwing I'd be beyond mad because I don't like the game mode at all."
Warframe,3e10wp,LikeABawsh,33,Tue Jul 21 19:47:50 2015 UTC,"It's unbalanced. The only viable frame is the Odonata, and that's because it doesn't go down in 2 hits and has actually useful powers. The UI is crap, everything is hard to see because it's too damn small, they still haven't found a better alternative to cheap-ass Hellion missiles, there are only 3 mission types (which were copy-pasted from on-foot missions), the collision detection suuuucks, and the Archwings mods are ridiculously expensive to level yet are underpowered as fuck.

Warframe,3e10wp,creepytacoman,2,Tue Jul 21 05:00:54 2015 UTC,"sense of awareness   Really, you're gonna pull that card? Archwing isn't like ground missions, where you only have to be aware of enemies on a flat plane. In archwing, enemies come at you in a 360 degree sphere. It's damn near impossible for the average human to track all of that shit, especially when the UI for archwing is still a bare-bones ineffective pile of crap."
Warframe,3e10wp,Kyotra,6,Tue Jul 21 10:20:59 2015 UTC,lol it's not that hard to track dude. the enemy fire is projectile based and not hitscan precisely so that you instantly know where it is coming from. just takes practice.

Warframe,3e10wp,Kraosdada,2,Tue Jul 21 04:47:51 2015 UTC,"Itzal is nice but only for survivability. I love my Itzal, but it is lacking. It can't push enemies off capture towers or disarm them like the Odonata. The invisibility only works when standing still, which counteracts the mobility you need to maintain during Intercepion missions (shit, standing still is a sin in any archwing mission). Itzal's ult it purely damage-based, thus it doesn't scale very well into late-game.  Overall it's powers are a little awkward (why the fuck would you want to draw enemies toward you when the damn thing is so fragile?). It's awkward nature is indicative of the fact that DE has yet to flesh out what they want archwing to truly be."

Warframe,3e10wp,tgdm,0,Tue Jul 21 12:01:01 2015 UTC,"All of the wings have their own ups and downs. The raw tankiness of the Elytron, combined with it's point defence capabilities, make it very useful for interception.  The Itzal is an amazing support wing. Fantastic at reviving, great for pulling in enemies and loot (extremely useful in AW), and is very mobile.  The Odonata is an offensive vanguard with plenty of utility to back it up, to avoid missiles and give your team space while disarming enemies.  I'd argue the Odonota is the best ArchWing, but it's certainly not the only viable one.  Likewise, I much prefer the mod system to the base game. Everything core is a cheap R5 mod. Things that are luxury, such as sprint speed and efficiency, are the rank 10 mods."

I have the efficiency mod at 25% lower, and a 7/10 Hyperion thrusters, both of which I'm happy with.  The thing is, there's very little additional grind with the mods, because all the important and meaningful mods are common and cheap to level, with a max rank of 5.  As for pointless? It's far from pointless. I enjoy Archwing, so there's a point."
Warframe,3e10wp,FrizzyThePastafarian,5,Tue Jul 21 11:06:10 2015 UTC,Do you mean the grind of finding them? Because it's definitely easier now than before. And fortunately none of the current content requires more than raw+element
Warframe,3e10wp,tgdm,-2,Tue Jul 21 12:11:53 2015 UTC,"maybe you just suck at archwing, man  odonata's definitely my favorite of the three but it is by no means the only viable option. elytron's stealth change to thumper being spammable made it the go-to mass killing wing for farming purposes (granted there's no real reason to farm outside of mastery rank and flat damage, such as thumper, has a cap on effectiveness vs enemy level but hey). itzal is ridiculously squishy but stealth is always neat and i'm willing to bet at least one will be necessary for raiding  the hellion missiles visuals are kind of bugged (gray warhead travels faster than fiery trail) but once you know how they work they're ridiculous easy to evade (hint: use melee).  also, which mods are expensive to level? there's a grand total of 3 R10s (commonx1, rarex2) and only one of which is a best in slot (Bleeding Edge), one of which is ok but manageable without (System Reroute), and the last is just for funsies (Hyperion Thrusters)"
Warframe,3e10wp,tgdm,2,Tue Jul 21 04:56:35 2015 UTC,"I don't suck at Archwing, I'm frustrated at it's shortcomings.  I used to play a lot of Armored Core and this shit just doesn't compare. I want Archwing to be faster, I want it to control tighter, I want to quit accidentally bumping into shit because the environmental geometry is out of whack, and I want a UI that is actually useful for identifying threats on the fly. The lack of variety makes it boring as shit, and there is fuckall incentive to even play it.  The Corpus still have Opticor jetpacks for fuck's sake, this shit is so underdone.  P.S. I love my Itzal but it feels more gimmicky than anything else. Odonata just gets shit done."
Warframe,3e10wp,Kyotra,9,Tue Jul 21 10:40:06 2015 UTC,"you really, really do suck at archwing if you think itzal doesn't get the job done. with infinite energy from the pull, it spams abilities way more often than the archwings and has a faster clear time than even the elytron because elytron can't maintain energy as well.  repulse also sucks because enemies are pushed out of range so a second ability cast won't hit them, forcing you to slow down your kill time to wait for them to come to you or to hunt them down individually, but crush can chain hits indefinitely.  Archwing is already faster than Armored Core if you play itzal and blink around, or in a forced spawn strat with some elytrons that gives you crazy high enemy spawn rates."
Warframe,3e10wp,zhandragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:31:32 2015 UTC,"Man... what? You have no idea what you're going on about.  The Elytron and Itzal are great Archwings.  I'll take my Elytron any day over that vanilla Odonata piece of junk.  ...Speaking of which, if your Elytron is dropping in 2 hits, you are doing something really, really, reeeeally wrong."
Warframe,3e10wp,NotEspeciallyClever,3,Tue Jul 21 04:43:13 2015 UTC,"I'll take my Elytron any day over that vanilla Odonata piece of junk.   you seem a bit misinformed here buddy  the elytron, while being the tankiest wing, has a definitive and hard cap on its usefulness. like any warframe with damage-only abilities, it will stop being useful the moment it can no longer reliably kill enemies. sure, you can get by spamming 4-5 thumpers in an area to deal thousands of damage to level 20-30 enemies, but once the scaling picks up a bit more then you're in for a whole lotta trouble. especially considering trials seem to be benchmarked at lvl90 enemies. not to mention the low damage on #4 relative to the energy cost. elytron is fun for stomping through all the low level stuff which is currently all which archwing has. if you want elytron to be useful be ready to spam energy restores + thumper at higher levels  the odonata on the other hand has a bullet shield + damage amplifier (which has a 290m max range for hitscan weapons), a projectile-catching ability which can also stun enemies, and an AoE CC + disarm. the only bad thing on odo's kit is Seeking Fire which never saw a damage increase despite the energy cost increase. but we don't judge nova off of null star, do we?  the only comparison between the two are core vents vs disarray, but the obvious winner is disarray because it benefits your team without them having to worry about repositioning"
Warframe,3e10wp,tgdm,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:15:29 2015 UTC,"elytron can stack with four other elytrons to farm as fast as mesa. the dropoff in effectiveness has not occurred in archwing yet as the balance is very good. for all intents and purposes despite the theoretical existence of falloff in archwing, nobody experiences this even in endgame play."
Warframe,3e10wp,zhandragon,2,Tue Jul 21 12:35:17 2015 UTC,"this is wrong in so many ways  most importantly, elytron cannot spawn camp farm. also noteworthy (because how could you miss this?): spawn locations are much more spread out than standard interception, there are no eximus in archwing, you can stack as many thumpers as you have energy solo which won't hit the theoretical falloff either (6-7 should clear out 20-30 enemies under 2s max, given rng hits).  elytron is more like ember than it will ever be like mesa."
Warframe,3e10wp,tgdm,0,Tue Jul 21 12:49:32 2015 UTC,"elytron can spawn camp because it has been and is being done.  it allowed me to fully forma all my gear in 3 days.  spawn location spread does not matter since enemies will tend to stay targeting one location for a long time and they actually arrive in a steady stream as well as their attention if you kill waves fast enough, which you do with 4 elytrons. this will net you 2-4 gallium per wave on uranus.  when enemies switch focus points, all 4 elytrons should move over and continue spamming. if a point falls, only one elytron should leave to recap while the other 3 keep killing. since there is a long duration on thumper, dps is also not sacrificed since the 4th elytron's thumper will still be casting.  you can keep the energy up because 1) you kill so many enemies that they keep dropping energy like they do in mesa farming and 2) you can bring energy restores, similar to how solo excalibur draco farm used to work. in addition the ability is fire and forget, allowing you to constantly fly around to gather energy, unlike the stationary mesa."
Warframe,3e10wp,zhandragon,0,Tue Jul 21 12:59:36 2015 UTC,"so basically you're spamming ring of fire where enemies spawn, running to loot the orbs, and then spamming it where they spawn next  don't get me wrong; i understand it's possible to clear out a bulk of a given spawn wave because they only come from a total of like 5-6 points (can't remember off the top of my head). but what you're describing is nowhere near as efficient as mesa (or RJ excal before her, or shield pol mag before nullifiers, or even banshee/saryn on live). and that's because elytron's kit does not have instant target tracking that automatically guts enemies the moment they are in range.  like i said elsewhere in this thread, elytron is the best option for farming. but she ain't no mesa"
Warframe,3e10wp,tgdm,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:39 2015 UTC,What this guy said. Elytron is pretty much the Ember of Archwings.
Warframe,3e10wp,Kyotra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:25:25 2015 UTC,"Elytron is the mesa of archwings. While there is theoretical dropoff, it has not been reached, and Elytron squads can all thumper to create a zone of instant death. Since enemies spawn like they do in Draco, this leads to insane xp as well as more resources than the base game since archwing has a 2.0 drop rate."

Sharkwing isn't just a new map, it's the basis for an entirely new system that allows to integrate archwing/sharking into existing mission types and create new ones as well.     Imagine a sabotage starts on the ship, you destroy the core. The room explodes and you get sucked into a vacuum. Archwing deploys and now you have to destroy the primary core of the ship (Like normal archwing sab) and fight your way to extraction.     Or vice versa, you start in archwing and have to fight your way onto the ship, formorian style. Once onboard the ship you can destroy the cores and bug out."

Warframe,3e2xp8,rcwheeler34,6,Tue Jul 21 15:33:22 2015 UTC,"As a player I would welcome any new event that means the potential for nice rewards.  From a story point of view, it is not likely that the Grineer and Corpus will fully work together. If I remember correctly, Grineer has worked/traded with Corpus from time to time, but never deployed their forces en mass against a common foe in a coordinated manner (tenno or infested).  The hate between the two factions runs really deep. Even the Tenno friendly syndicates Steel Meridian and Perrin Sequence are still enemies."
Warframe,3e2xp8,monkyseemonkydo,3,Tue Jul 21 15:42:01 2015 UTC,They previously had at the very least diplomacy based on the last mission of The Archwing.
Warframe,3e2xp8,dell_arness2,6,Tue Jul 21 18:16:49 2015 UTC,Isn't the formorian conflict like a good example as to why we are never attacked directly? because they spend more attacking us and the cost is just never really worth it?
Warframe,3e2xp8,Chaito,5,Tue Jul 21 20:21:37 2015 UTC,"That might be the under lying reason. It seems the Tenno are more of a guerilla force. Each Tenno has their own liset and Orbiter. The relays were the largest ""Tenno owned"" targets at this time so it makes sense that the Grineer target them.  And like you said, although we lost quite a few relays, they suffered financially and lost a large number of (extremely valuable)  fomorians and countless men.  Even if they were to join forces, where would they attack? We can just hop into our lisets and peace out."
Warframe,3e2xp8,monkyseemonkydo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:58 2015 UTC,The Corpus have been exploiting the Grineer for a long time before we were awake.  The Grineer have been exterminating the Corpus for a long time before we were awake.  It's the same reason Perrin Sequence and Steel Meridian hate one another: old grudges don't die. All coordination between the two died when Alad refused to the Grineer the Tenno he found (Gradivus Dilemma) and when Vay Hek openly declared war on the Corpus to take what he wanted from them (The Archwing quest).

Warframe,3e2xp8,Linkapedia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I also think it's likely that the sentients might be able to just make their own kind of corrupted and manipulate all sides of the conflict to their end.

Warframe,3e2xp8,fizio900,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:21:42 2015 UTC,It would be hard for the grineer and corpus to team against us not just because the hate they share for each other but how the Tenno operate. We act as sole operatives who sneakily board their ships and steal things or exterminate them. We don't really congregate together that would allow them to attack us. They have completely different agendas as well where the corpus are profit driven and the grineer want to exterminate everything.

Rifle Amp increased the damage on yellow bodyshot crit of my Dread on level 16 Arid Lancers from ~7600 to ~8600 (because the damage increase is additive, not multiplicative).  Then, in the Simulacrum. With no aura, my Dread does ~4900 to level 20 Heavy Gunners on yellow crit bodyshot. With Dead Eye, it deals ~4900 to them.   Now, for the Launchers. Unmodded Ogris does ~150 to level 20 Heavy Gunners with no aura. With Dead Eye, it does ~150. With Rifle Amp, it does ~180.   Dead Eye doesn't help Bows or Launchers. Rifle Amp does."

Warframe,3e268w,t-e-c-c,2,Tue Jul 21 12:04:21 2015 UTC,Caracol Saturn is a good dark sector defense for it. The map is close quarters so a pilfering swarm hydroid and nekros can get a lot of resources. Also you can usually get people to stay 15-20 waves unlike Ceres dark sector.

Warframe,3e268w,Slimy_Revenant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:23 2015 UTC,"Ceres, Seimeni, Dark Sector Defense is probably the easiest way assuming you are not overtly concerned about time.    You can almost always get a random group as people are constantly running it.  The credit income is very solid from it aswell.  Assuming you don't have a Nekros/Hydroid with you expect about 0-2 per 5 waves (which most people just go to 5 waves, leave, repeat).  With Nekros/Hydroid you might be able to get up to around 4-5 on a good run, but realistically probably more like 1-3. If you can run the Nerkos to make sure your team has one this gets all the easier as most people go there to farm credits not cells.    You can do better with dedicated group comps on other maps, but realistically if you are asking for help like this I'm assuming its not about a group grind situation.  If it was I'd suggest Saturn Dark Sector Survival with Nekros/Hydroid, Trinity for EV, and a random of choice.  Nekros, Hydroid, EV Trinity is basically the farming comp of choice no matter where you go, what you are doing, etc."

I approve, puncture is the best base damage type when going up against armored targets (without 4 corrosive projection)   How does it compare to other scythes?   It's like 2x better than reaper prime just damage wise, not counting in the massive speed bonus from berserker. Overall it's a high tier weapon.

It's best to put it up for free instead and let people have a choice if they're going to do that.

Warframe,3dyw10,Nine9breaker,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:37:50 2015 UTC,"Actually it would completely create gender favoritism, why can't Excalibur start off as female? Why do I have to pay money to make Excalibur female when all these other games allow me to have a choice between genders? Are you saying women aren't able to wield swords? Same goes for female characters. Why is Ember locked to female unless I pay? Why do I have to pay to make Ember a guy? Are you saying men aren't able to control fire? Stop oppressing meeeee yadda yadda yadda. This is only a small portion of the complaints DE would get. And before you say so people will completely ignore any lore points you would bring up. Hell people have complained and made all types of accusations on games they havn't even played. The only reason why paying for gender swap has worked in other games is because they give you a choice in the beginning on which gender you want to be. In order for there to be no gender favoritism each gender HAS to be equal right from the beginning on all playing fields. If DE implemented  that system, picking which gender when you build a Warframe, then that would eliminate any gender favoritism but it would piss off a lot of the player base for altering the lore. I wish people wouldn't complain but I've seen similar things happen before and this is what people get angry about. Really sucks because I would love to see female Excal or male Valkyr."
Warframe,3dyw10,Vindictive182,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:28:46 2015 UTC,They could be money but I feel that it is a lot more risky than Proto skins and would take quite a bit of time unless they did them one at a time. Protoskins and Prime models just seem a lot less controversial for profit.

The big issue with gunblades it that they can't differ TOO far from what we currently have while still being in the same stance class. Sure, we can put a hammer on it but they can't really become massive two-handed Nora hammers without requiring a new Heavy Gunblade stance of some kind to not look silly.

DE wants to either;   A) Never release anything additional on the lore so that it's all player driven or  B) Build the lore in their own time, and obviously right now is not the time they want to specify that the warframes have flesh etc.  It's similar to a movie studio denying a movie's existence that's in development, only to come out at a later date with that movie.

It's just not sensible. I'm glad they're pointing it out, though.  Art theft is especially tricky when its done with fanart, considering that fanart is a legally grey area in and of itself. Digital Extremes has always been great about allowing, showcasing, and motivating artists to create fanart, but when it comes to something like this it gets tricky. Especially when another country's laws are involved.  tl;dr: This is probably the best we're going to get because China's corporate culture is unlikely to change and DE has invested far too much into this project to revoke it now. The best they can do is to politely ask ChangYou not to do this."

Warframe,3dy87o,Lucai7,7,Mon Jul 20 15:31:47 2015 UTC,"Gonna start out by saying I have no stake in this, not been paying attention to warframe for a while. FFXIV and witcher 3 taking up all my time. I'm just analysing the text in this post from a neutral perspective, I don't actually know what's going on. Though I think after this I might go check it out.  But this makes no damn sense... And sounds like slimey PR excuses... From the top.   ChangYou respected that we have forever exclusive content in the global build, but needed something new to ensure Warframe's Beta Launch in China is a success.    ...But you just said...   In order for Warframe to officially be in China, it is required that a company must have a physical presence in China.   Meaning Warframe China is not going to be competiting with Warframe. So why exactly do they NEED exclusives to differ themselves from the official Warframe.   Yes - we trust ChangYou's experiences and agree that in order for Warframe to appeal to an entirely new audience, some content needs to be released in Mainland China first.   Why? Warframe China isn't going to be competing with Warframe, so why does it need its own timed exclusives?    We always let our friends at ChangYou know when they've used something player-made.   Because I bet that does a lot...   Typically the quality is so high they don't realize it isn't something we ourselves didn't officially release until we point it out.   You mean they just don't care to check because there is nothing to stop them doing so.  Sounds to me someone in their haste to publish in China didn't put anything in the contract demanding that the chinese company don't take the piss out of the player bases artists. Considering so many companies in china's track record with stealing content because they can. You would think this would be a given... A claus like ""only use official promotional material from us to advertise the game"".   Please note that we don't approve the use of this content, and continue to try and improve the approval process of Marketing materials. Apologies for it being used, we are working with our partners to prevent it in the future.   Translation: It's not in the contract and they can't be punished for it and we've already invested a lot of money in this so we won't do shit."
Warframe,3dy87o,GrimoireOfAlice,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:31 2015 UTC,"By that logic, why was there ever exclusive Prime content to begin with?  Warframe wasn't competing with a proto-Warframe.  The answer, of course, is it's appealing, and they can charge like, 200 bucks or the equivalent for it (as EXCLUSIVE ITEM WILL GO AWAY AND NEVER COME BACK).  It's also worth pointing out that DE hasn't invested any money in this - they were bought out."
Warframe,3dy87o,RedVisionaire,3,Mon Jul 20 20:10:29 2015 UTC,"By that logic, why was there ever exclusive Prime content to begin with?

If the chances are 99% of a placeholder comming to the pc then technically even if i end up being wrong, i will be wrong 1% of the time.    If players are betting that a specific placeholder of an excall will not be made into an item ingame (aka 1% chance), that's like wanting these issues to happen so they can complain, they bet on terrible odds just so they have the ""right"" to complain.

EDIT: As a raid leader, I've only bitched at new players (I've invited many newbies to the normal raid when the core raiders were present but we've had slots) under the following circumstances:  An ""EV Trinity"" had more then 100 duration on his build.  A Frost would not step onto the pad he was staying next to in Part 2, despite the rest of the team telling him to in chat, asking him over ingame VoIP, and flashing waypoints at him.

Warframe,3e0hyl,Fronteror,13,Tue Jul 21 03:00:05 2015 UTC,I like how all of Banshee's augments have been very useful.  I personally run Sonic Fracture on mine for the additional utility added onto the quick CC.
Warframe,3e0hyl,Crooodle,2,Tue Jul 21 01:12:27 2015 UTC,Sonic Fracture is one reason why I want to build a second Banshee. Three presets aren't enough.
Warframe,3e0hyl,Fronteror,2,Tue Jul 21 01:21:42 2015 UTC,Resonance and Sonic Fracture builds are completely compatible though.  ...unless you just don't want to have to swap the two mods between eachother.
Warframe,3e0hyl,NotEspeciallyClever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:39:10 2015 UTC,"That's what I mean, I'd rather not swap out individual mods and later forget what I intended the build to exactly be.  It has happened more than once, so I might as well pay the tiny amount of resources for another Banshee."
Warframe,3e0hyl,Fronteror,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:48:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Banshee has no farm attached either. To build my other novas and saryns it took so many runs T-T"

Warframe,3e0hyl,intensive_porpoises,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:36:41 2015 UTC,"To be fair, she's only as good as your loadout, plus she lacks mobility and defensive skills (Sonic Boom and Sound Quake can only do so much)."
Warframe,3e0hyl,Mrburgerdon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:26:49 2015 UTC,Silence is a good defensive skill for units close to ya if built correctly. You can run at them to cause a small stunned animation and unleash hell. Though her main ability to create weakpoints for insane damage is why i love her though.
Warframe,3e0hyl,intensive_porpoises,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:49:51 2015 UTC,"Banshee is one of my favorite frames, so it's not like I'm trying to trash her or anything. :p But I also can't deny that she's particularly vulnerable in certain scenarios.  Silence is pretty good, but it only applies the stun animation once.. unless they leave your Silence range and reenter it, in which case you can abuse it at a certain distance by running back and forth to expose those enemies multiple times."
Warframe,3e0hyl,Mrburgerdon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:18:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah big time, but heck her deficiencies make playing her fun since she isnt a nuke, more like a status effect frame then anything else,"

Warframe,3e0hyl,Systm9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:46 2015 UTC,people just don't like aiming   or maybe one of the most essential mods in the game has a negative effect on accuracy
Warframe,3e0hyl,Fubulicious,8,Tue Jul 21 08:33:12 2015 UTC,heavy caliber is not essential. just mitigate that with an element.
Warframe,3e0hyl,Trumbles,6,Tue Jul 21 10:03:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I avoid heavy caliber unless the weapon is barely affected by it. Sure your on-paper DPS goes up, but if you can't consistently land headshots/sonar points, then why does it matter?   I'm more of a secondary weapon fan anyways, and magnum force is rarely worth it."
Warframe,3e0hyl,NotEspeciallyClever,9,Tue Jul 21 10:04:27 2015 UTC,"i'm glad because most people seem to run her like she's a nuker.  never fails, 20+ minute/wave mark in a T4 endless, some derp keeps trying to dive into the middle of a group and sound quake (because we gotta pump up those damage numbers in the end of mission summary screen!) and gets put down every time."

Warframe,3e0hyl,DreadBert_IAm,5,Tue Jul 21 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"Personally don't care about the damage, it can lock down a huge area for quite a while by keeping everything knocked on there can.  With primed flow it's pretty much possible to lock down all points on Draco and some other interception maps for an entire round.  Really dull though."
Warframe,3e0hyl,NotEspeciallyClever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:05:20 2015 UTC,"Aside from using it for temporarily locking down a location to allow teammates to rez a fallen ally in a hot zone, it's a bit of a waste building her in that manner because you effectively take a player out of action (unlike Nova or Nyx). A player that could be better used doing actual damage.  EDIT: And when Nullifiers show up you're really just putting yourself in harm's way."
Warframe,3e0hyl,DreadBert_IAm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:15:02 2015 UTC,"I generally rate CC powers higher then damage powers and build accordingly.  She is mostly an interception frame for me due to her powers being situaltional.  Also, from my experience if nullifies are within range when they spawn then they can't stand long enough to get the bubble online."
Warframe,3e0hyl,Chaito,2,Tue Jul 21 11:50:51 2015 UTC,well i feel like resonance as it is now is very comparable with molecular prime in levels of utility. Now both of them together and HNNNGGGG

I did still find banshee kinda of bad.  I mean, look at Chroma and Mirage: They both have means to amplify their own damage by almost half as much as sonar (which is good enough enough for killling enemies up to lvl 100 with practically as many hits as with sonar) and unlike banshee they both even have reliable ways to keep themselves alive and it's not like they are broken powerful."
Warframe,3e0hyl,ScytheVX,2,Tue Jul 21 04:32:55 2015 UTC,well il take my 10x damage multiplier with me  and have fun with it xD
Warframe,3e0hyl,waddayakno,-6,Tue Jul 21 09:52:11 2015 UTC,"The fact that you reduce Banshee's potential to Resonance is shameful, almost as much as your need to reduce the entire gameplay down to spamming one button so you can  spray n pray.    And for your info - Resonance is bugged. Additional spots are supposed to only last for a fraction of the remaining sonar time, but right now they're lasting significantly longer than intended.   Time to fix that, I'd say."
Warframe,3e0hyl,Kuryaka,2,Tue Jul 21 03:37:28 2015 UTC,Do you have a source for your claim that Resonance is bugged? They last for 100% of the remaining sonar time at max rank. Says so on the mod card itself.
Warframe,3e0hyl,FalseCape,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:53:01 2015 UTC,Can confirm resonance spots will last past the initial duration.
Warframe,3e0hyl,Kuryaka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:11:42 2015 UTC,"Is this the case with 100% duration, or does it take more?"
Warframe,3e0hyl,MrBubbleSS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:20:51 2015 UTC,"They don't last more than a few seconds, but yes they do.  Any reasonable resonance banshee will, however, cast multiple times so you never run out of spots."
Warframe,3e0hyl,pure_bordem,2,Tue Jul 21 04:33:11 2015 UTC,"Duration mods effect the resonance spots as well. Theoretically you could have infinite resonance spots if you triggered them quick enough as the duration would begin to stack.   However, as I main Banshee I can tell you DE has a build in delay between when a resonance triggers. Try shooting a bunch of shield drones in the void, the first will pop easy but the others won't pop at all. Then a few seconds later shot another and it will pop.  This will let you squeak past the initial duration for a few seconds at best, but eventually you will run out."
Warframe,3e0hyl,cyberneticReverb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:46 2015 UTC,"The delay is 3 seconds, and is only for the player who triggered it, as multiple players can trigger different resonance procs from my experience playing Banshee. And from what I can tell, with 212% Duration, they last around 30-50% longer than what's left on the  duration counter."

I'd use daggers more often, but to me, the two things holding them back are:   Lack of Crit stats. Channeling with them will ruin your energy.   They need something to make up for their lack of range, besides mediocre speed that can be outdone by any beserker weapon."

All in all, though, a huge change isn't needed in terms of objectives but in actual gameplay. Enemies are very bland, more so than regular non-archwing ones. In particular, I hate how easy it is to melee everything in your way. I'd love it if it was the other way around, with players being forced to use every single pixel of their stamina bar to kite and dodge otherwise deadly enemy attacks."

Warframe,3dy9s1,zhandragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:49:38 2015 UTC,I had this bug before the last tactical alert. I was doing a 3 man arch intercept on that tile with randoms and the host guy left suddenly at around 50-65% of the first round. The tenno who stayed with me jokingly asked if I want to stay with him before proceeding to round 2 to core farm till round 50 because he was hoping the bug will happen again like what he had 2 days ago. And it did. Lots of cores and the best part is that I got that sweet elytron set. We could've stayed longer but he decided to leave after that 50th round.   I'll never forget you blue chroma stranger :)

Warframe,3dy9s1,shriji,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:20 2015 UTC,In my opinion there is a difference between exploiting a accidental bug and using an exploit...
Warframe,3e1ogr,xJVIayhem,2,Tue Jul 21 07:22:30 2015 UTC,"According to the wiki, charge rate is calculated like this:  Modded Charge Time (MCT) = Charge Time ÷ (1 + Mod Bonus)   So you should just be able to sub in the RoF calculation for charge weapons. I think it should be something like this:  Burst = Damage * (Charge Time / (1 + Mod Bonus)) Sustained = W * (1 - (K / (K + (O / MCT))))   One thing to note is that DPS should technically be lower than automatic weapons since bows are incapable of firing multiple rounds per second.   Hopefully this at least partially answered your question. I used your formula and compared it to the values on Warframe-Builder and it got really close (calc on my computer probably just rounded off a few values)."
Warframe,3e1ogr,slow_excellence,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:13:15 2015 UTC,"That makes me worry about Burst... I'm still unsure how accurate that will be.  Because if you take that into account, It'd have to act similar to Sustain DPS I think, to account for charging time, but not reload.  So maybe something like this:     Damage x (1- (MTC))     Damage x (1- (CT / 1 + MB))  Going to just replace ROF, but inversely.   By this I mean I'm going to take the 0.5 Charge time of the Paris in PvP for example, and it will be 2. Because not counting reload, it would be true that you can fire 2 rounds in a second.  Also.. facepalms for not going to wiki for MTC  Edit: I just realized how much of a pain the Angstrum is going to be when I get around to it. Because that charge is also affected by magazine."
Warframe,3e3kn9,cioxs,5,Tue Jul 21 18:11:52 2015 UTC,"The introduction of T4 tower keys already put a strain on the Key System and added to the farm. It wasn't really the best solution that people saw to increasing difficulty and rewards.  Perhaps maybe a scaling difficulty instead? Collect keys and combine them to create higher tier keys, rather than having them drop or be obtained directly. This way players who truly want to challenge themselves can mash together a ton of T4 keys for like a T12 key and go ham or whatever!"
Warframe,3e3kn9,BuildMyPaperHeart,2,Tue Jul 21 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"The only reason T4 added to the key system's strain is because DE couldn't resist shitting the place up with even more duplicates.

There is a clear demand for Excal Prime, they need to figure out a way to satisfy that demand while still making sure that the Founders don't get shafted. There are many ways they could go about it, one of which would be to release a regular Excal Prime version and upgrade the Founders version with more intricate visuals so that they still get something unique.

I wouldn't really talk about ""fairness"" here, it's more about founders wanting to be special snowflakes and thus refusing to see other people enjoy what they've kept for themselves for 2 years.

Our ability to give feedback is limited only to what DE is adding to the game, we cannot create threads of our own, we are only allowed to post in threads created by DE and vote in polls (ie. we had a poll on what theme the next frame should be. Ying-Yang frame won). If you believe that DE relies on founders for the direction and vision for the game, you are sadly mistaken (I was).   I believe you guys also got some merch as a result and the usual hefty amount of plats.    The only merch that I know of, is the Warframe bandana. I couldn't be bothered myself though to send my address to DE, to get a bandana with Warframe labeled on it. I mean, I am a nerd and all but I don't need to look like I am special.   You even had exclusive access to Excal Prime, something that a whole lot of people have wanted for a long time. I wouldn't really talk about ""fairness"" here, it's more about founders wanting to be special snowflakes and thus refusing to see other people enjoy what they've kept for themselves for 2 years.   You'd have a more sound argument if Excalibur Prime parts dropped in game, those that had the parts had built it and suddenly, it was taken off of the drop table just before the trading system was introduced.  Now, you frankly just sound butthurt.  Tell you what though, if you want Excalibur Prime that badly. Buy my account! :P"

And this is my point: even if some founders don't care about the Design Council, about the founders t-shirt or any of the other bonuses that they got, many don't want to acknowledge that what they got here was worth the money they paid. There's no need to hold gameplay-related content from the rest of the community just because you were there at the right time during the game's development.  Of course DE can do whatever they want with their game. I just don't agree with it. I've got money in my pocket and they don't even want it which I find really weird. And then they're trying to sell me more Excal skins despite the fact that I'm not allowed to use the Prime variant and benefit from the Prime bonuses (for instance, the free energy bursts in the Void.)  What they should've done is release a special edition of Excalibur Prime with an unique skin and helmet exclusively for the Founders, and THEN make Excal Prime available through Prime Access.

Thing is, we are not a part of the development of Warframe as we don't have a active role in it. If anything, we get a sneak peak on what is going out the pipe and that is all really. Because I wanted to take part in the development of Warframe, I really did but in retrospect - I regret becoming a founder.   And this is my point: even if some founders don't care about the Design Council, about the founders t-shirt or any of the other bonuses that they got, many don't want to acknowledge that what they got here was worth the money they paid. There's no need to hold gameplay-related content from the rest of the community just because you were there at the right time during the game's development.   I am absolutely certain that there are people that bought into the founders program for the bling factor only. But those that involved because we wanted to be a part of development process are either extremely disillusioned (along with a healthy dose of cynicism) with DE because of the choices they have made and direction they have taken Warframe or they simply do not care about the future of the game because of DE.   Of course DE can do whatever they want with their game. I just don't agree with it. I've got money in my pocket and they don't even want it which I find really weird.

Like I said previous, if DE were to make Excalibur Prime re-release again, it should only be available through Prime Access. Not off the drop table in game or through trading. :)   But I agree, it is a bit weird. Guess they do want to stay by their word.   What they should've done is release a special edition of Excalibur Prime with an unique skin and helmet exclusively for the Founders, and THEN make Excal Prime available through Prime Access. That would've been the smart choice.   We would face a similar situation as we have now with the Excalibur Umbra, which in itself is a mess on its own.  *minor edit"

No, sorry, aside from access to the Design Council forum and a big pile of plat, we didn't get any other benefits or goodies beyond the Excalibur Prime, Lato Prime and Skana Prime - all which have been superseded by other weapons and frames.

As I've posted elsewhere, though, it's not our decision to hold gameplay content from you.  It's DE's. Their wording on Founder's packs was explicit and absolute in marketing that EP would be available for a limited time only and then never again thereafter. This is a legally binding statement.  Excal Prime will never be held by non-Founders, as it is against the law for DE to even think about offering him up. Regardless of if the entire Founders population were okay with it."
Warframe,3dyqwx,Linebreaker13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:15 2015 UTC,"They could easily rebrand the current EP into a Founders-exclusive version, and still give the rest of the community their own version of EP. This is just one of many ways they could deal with the situation."
Warframe,3dyqwx,lerobotsexy,3,Tue Jul 21 14:55:47 2015 UTC,"I think exclusives are dumb, and always have. I've got the snipetron vandal, the strun wraith, and a few others which I would gladly see available to the population. Perhaps they should be exclusive to some sort of special event or quest, but not outright exclusive.  I've also said before and will say again that I think the founders should have gotten some other sort of stand alone frame cosmetic, which would have been cool to have but not have prevented non-founders from completing their primes. As we see new primes added, and they keep getting stat boosts and passive effects, primes are becoming more and more clearly a type of upgrade path. Excalibur though doesn't have and will never have a prime for people to upgrade to unless they got it several years ago.  My suggestion quite a while back was an ""Excalibur Origin"". Not just the original version of excalibur, but the first ever prototype warframes. Stand alone, since it makes sense that there is only one warframe which can be first, so there would never be Rhino Origin or Mag Origin frames which would be available to players. Excalibur Origin stays unique and limited, and that allows Excalibur Prime to join his Primed brothers and sisters in the void."
Warframe,3dyqwx,Toraxa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:59:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm okay with exclusives but only if they're cosmetic in nature or if players have access to them through other means. Prime Access is a success even though the parts drop in the Void, so they really shouldn't hide Excal Prime from their potential customers. Like you said, they should probably either give founders their own variant of Excal Prime, or give them a special skin and helmet that only they could have.  I'm assuming Excal Prime will get a buff eventually. Most Prime stuff are clear upgrades over the regular ones and Excal shouldn't be an exception IMO."
Warframe,3dyqwx,lerobotsexy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:57:26 2015 UTC,"You do realize the whole point of Excal, Lato, and Skana Prime being exclusive is because they were specifically given for supporting the game while still in very early beta, aka a point in time when no one knew if the game would take off or not?  Also, before anyone tries to pull this card on me, I am NOT a founder, I just understand the reasons why DE are doing what they are with those items."
Warframe,3dyqwx,NemoracStrebor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:28:57 2015 UTC,"I understand the reasons too, but the difference is that they didn't get exclusive, more intricate versions of the Primed Excal, Lato and Skana... they got the only available versions of these items. I don't agree with that.  Perhaps back then they didn't really plan to release that many Prime gear and to drop all of the parts in the Void, maybe they were supposed to be entirely exclusive to Prime Access buyers... but this isn't the case anymore. There's no need to hide that content."

What some Founders and the majority of the post-Founders playerbase don't recognize is that wording is, in fact, legally binding. No matter if 100% of the founders were fine, the content was marketed as 100% time-limited and utterly exclusive, with a selling point being the fact that it would never again appear in any form whatsoever. It's just the law. :L  I wouldn't be against EP being available as Prime Access. But a more expensive Prime Access, and something to differentiate him from Founders. Perhaps a different model, the likes of which is visually different from the Founders one (else the Founders one gets a proper mode, and the new EP inherits the old, 'bland' one), possible with some sort of marking, an asterisk, to denote it's a Founders one in menus. Just as long as Lato Prime was also available as a standalone, so I could get my hands on that to round out my collection.  But, sadly, legaleze will blot that out forever. I regret not dropping that last $50 or whatever, but I didn't have it, and I'm not really missing out on much, so it's okay. RP himself isn't all that impressive anyway, I think most people just want him as a collector's item. (But those are limited edition in the real world anyway, so...)"

I don't think many people here are that upset at the concept of timed exclusives, the issues are that    people thought they were going to have 0 chance at the items, (now proven to be mostly incorrect which has placated some of the rabble rabble, for these items at least, the original founder gear is still a sore spot and remains a bad idea) people are upset at the idea there are special versions that will be available to only one audience or another, (according to the post on the Chinese site) people are upset that they are loopholing around their promise to never re-release (an alternate  version) Excal Prime, using a method they themselves said would be ""sleazy"" in the past.    DE could easily avoid a lot of this by simply not having anymore regional etc. exclusives (points 1 and 2., timed is mostly fine I think) and if they absolutely had to release some sort of founder's exclusive for China, they could have picked any frame other than Excal (point 3.) to have avoided a lot of anger being thrown at them.  Putting aside the question of whether people are justified in feeling how they do or not, DE really should have seen a lot of this coming, and could have avoided it, especially since it's almost all things that have been discussed and caused a lot of anger in the past simply as concepts.  I love the game and generally like DE and like a lot of the devs as people from what I know/see of them, but my biggest frustration with the devs and the game has always been and continues to be, they often talk about doing things differently/their own way, but then continue right on enacting some of the worst behaviors/ideas the gaming industry has (exclusive content, content behind paywalls, excessive grind, forced stealth, escort missions, etc.). I mean, they know all the issues/anger surrounding the original founders' gear, they can't possibly be naive enough to think if they did the same/similar again everybody would just be happy with it.  I really wish they'd try and actually do things a bit differently than the rest of the f2p/mmo/gaming industry like they often say they do/want to. They get some things really, really right but then get some things so very wrong, and those things are often stuff they know is going to have this sort of reaction, which causes even more frustration from people.  TL;DR DE could have avoided a lot of this, and questions of the validity of the complaints/degree of the complaints against them aside, DE is definitely not blameless/damned if they do, damned if they don't.  *Just woke up, so apologies if this isn't phrased/thought out as well as my sleep-addled brain thinks it is."

I'm one of the founders who would like founders items to be released for everyone and I'm one of the PC players who finds not right that console players didn't have any chance to get our exclusives.  So, why should I be salty? I'm just disappointed if we don't get that Prime Umbra because it could have finally being a compensation to non founders players, ending or reducing the Excalibur Prime issue. I would like that all players could enjoy the same contents, no matter platform, money spent, time of playing and so on.  No salt here, just sincerely sorry for console and non founders players."

Warframe,3e13bc,Schadenfreude11,4,Tue Jul 21 05:05:04 2015 UTC,"Some Prime parts are very difficult to sell at all, particularly the ones that drop very commonly, like Ember Prime Helmets and Sicarus Prime Blueprints. The only ones that go for a decent amount of Plat are difficult or tediously obtained parts, such as Soma Prime Barrels and Ember Prime Blueprints.  A large amount of Prime parts are nearly impossible to sell, so you're better off collecting those ones to trade for Ducats, so you can buy something from the Void Trader. Maybe even buy duplicates from the Void Trader, because after he leaves, somebody will give you at least 50P for what he brought."
Warframe,3e13bc,Own_Wilson,2,Tue Jul 21 03:44:14 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to note that Soma Barrels are now pretty common and not quite as desirable as they were a couple weeks ago. After the Void drop reshuffle, they are now a common drop on T3MD, which also drops the new Vectis Stock, which is a very popular and in demand prime part, as well as a drop on T4I rotation C. So presently trade chat is somewhat flooded with Soma Barrels.  OP: another thing you need to do is watch chat and see what people are trying to sell. If you see that a lot of people are spamming trade with ads saying they want to sell a particular item, and it's the same people every time, then you can infer that it's not in terribly high demand."

He'll arrive next this Friday. He usually offers a unique weapon and mod, and sometimes a unique aesthetic item too. His items typically cost 200-600 Ducats and 100k-300k credits each, so save up (Prime parts can be redeemed for 10-50 Ducats each, depending on rarity)."
Warframe,3e13bc,bob6784558,3,Tue Jul 21 05:04:18 2015 UTC,"I'm quite an active trader usually, so here's some tips I can give you. Point Summaries in bold for the TL;DR peoples.   When selling a small quantity of items (~ 5 or so items) Always list the item and price similar to ""Item (#p). But try to limit the amount of items sold this way as it clutters trade chat. Generic, non-specific ads are better when you have a lot of stuff to sell. Something along the lines of "" Selling Primes Parts and Mods, PM me I may have something you're looking for."" will catch MUCH more people's attention that spamming a wall of 10-15 thing with prices. If buying something, always try to haggle if you think the price is too much for you. Some people will be rude and just tell you to go away, but some will be willing and long as you're not gouging their listed price.  Following with the previous, always be willing to haggle. Also, ALWAYS make sure if you've bought something to resell that you make SOME profit. Try to maintain a profit margin of some sort. Ex. Buying an item for 10, try to sell for 12-15 or equivalent Be willing to TRADE ITEMS. This one I CANNOT stress enough. If someone wants to buy something and they don't have the plat, or don't want to pay your price all in plat.. take items as well or instead of plat! I can't recall how many times I've traded for items in addition to plat and increased my profit. or traded people items they needed for items I needed/wanted and ended up with a profit. Most importantly, as people have said.. Be polite. While everyone out there may not be, this does have its benefits. I've have several people add me and become repeat customers and gotten more sales this way. Following up with the previous, Always follow a trade with ""Nice trading with you."" Even if you are a bit harsh when making a deal with someone, this will always come across as polite and respectful. Be wary of getting ""Lowballed"". There are people other there that are looking to profit off you, just as much as you are them.  In general, if someone offers you less than or around 50% of your item listed price, and are fixed on trying to get that price, kindly push them away or mute them. They are trying to gouge your price so they can profit even more. When selling new items, be patient. Never hastily drop your price to match/beat someone else's. With high value items especially, people WILL try to lie right to your face and say they got a better offer for their sale or purchase. If they say this, just reply along the lines of ""Okay, no problem"". If they come back, they were probably lying in the first place, if they weren't then you do miss a sale, but will likely get another chance as the high value items are the ones people look to buy the most, usually because of their rarity. Following up with the comment on the last one, NEVER become ""one of those people"". Do NOT lie to people and say you got a better offer if you didn't. This will make anything you say afterwards questionable to anyone that understands what you tried to do. If you don't know the price of something, just watch Trade chat. Depending on the item's popularity, you'll notice a suitable price range within minutes. Price Checks are almost unnecessary unless you want an idea of a price of an item that really low in sales. Not too many people will actually do price checks, but I usually do for random people when I'm out of trades for the day. most of the time it's, as simple as watching trade chat, or in my case, it's just knowing Your time IS worth money, but not always very much. While it doesn't make a worthless item that can drop on wave 5 more valuable if you got it on wave 25/45.. It does impact the high value items quite a bit. This tip is more or less how to make sense of prices vs. rarity really.   Those are the tips that come to mind from me. Hopefully they're able to help some newbie traders, or possibly even regular traders. If there's any questions I can answer for anyone looking to getting into trading or just get better at it, just drop em below this comment."

Vigor just makes you a little less squishy than base stats, and is more slot and capacity-efficient than Vitality and Redirection.  Rending Strike, though. Literally the only melee weapon with similar Slash and Puncture values is the Dual Razas."

Warframe,3e13bc,lightningleaf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:42:51 2015 UTC,"Vigor is less slot-efficient than Vitality or Redirection. It's also less capacity-efficient than Vitality (9 points for 240% increase while Vitality is 12 points for a 440% increase - Vitality is 36.7% per energy while Vigor is 26.7%). I wouldn't use any of those 3 on a frame like Loki though; Quick Thinking and Reflex Guard are the only worthwhile defensive mods to run on him, Mirage & co. His shields and health are too low for Redirection/Vitality (or god forbid, Vigor) to give any meaningful stats.     The only time I've ever used Vigor was in the Valkyr-build for the proto-Corpus Hijack event that was crawling with Nullifiers and you could only use thrown melee. There I simply wanted maxed defensive physical stats since there was little chance of using powers efficiently. Pure stats and a Lifestrike melee made for a reasonable setup."

Many things you get can be sold in Warframe, due to the presence of so much in it. People merch in Trading and get thousands and thousands of platinum but I've no idea why they would put in so much effort, waiting for so long for a guy to con.

Look your items up in the wiki and figure out how they can be most easily obtained. If it comes from an A rotation or a low-tier non-repeatable key, people will just earn it themselves rather than buy it. Realistically, if the item is worth < 25p, it probably isn't worth your time to sell it except as part of a full set.  When you have good product, post the price you want to sell it for. Nobody wants to try and figure out what an item is worth, guess how much you want for it, and haggle. Just state your price in trade chat and wait for someone to respond. If you don't want to play while trading, then watch for WTB's which fit your price.  Same goes for buying items. Have a price, ask for it up-front, and watch for appropriate WTS's."

Warframe,3e3gp6,MolganVK,2,Tue Jul 21 20:30:40 2015 UTC,"My opinion:  I don't think having a 'face' for the tenno would be a good idea, the tenno are inhabitants of warframes (DE hasn't put any lore into WHO we actually are and HOW we can switch warframes).   I and probably others would prefer the tenno to be always in a suit rather then see the face of the original tenno that inhabited it.   But I can see the appeal of being able to see a tenno's face and have them possibly display different emotions with their face. I can only really see that seeing their faces in the liset, orbiter and relays.    A possible way I can see having 'helmet-less/faces' of tenno working.  Following my previous comments here's what I think of it;   Helmet-less options for tennos appear as additional skin in the helmet menu. Helmet-less appearance only works in Social area's not while in missions. (Liset, Relays,..) Helmet-less default is whatever warframe's 'face' A platinum item in the store that allows for customization of each warframe's 'face' (done in appearance), applying a new look costs ~35k credits."

Has a dog like helmet, with heads at the ends of his arms(stopping around his wrists) that are similar to his head. Out of one head is fire(Heat), the other is lightning(Electric).  Abilties:  Firebrand: Cerberus marks an enemy with his flame arm which sets the target on fire. Any damage the target takes does additional Heat damage. If the target dies while under the effects of Firebrand, he erupts in flame doing Heat damage to nearby enemies.  Electrocute: A wire of pure electricity is shot at an enemy from Cerberus' lightning arm. The wire has a 100% Electric proc effectively stunning the target so long as the ability is channeled. The ability stops if Cerberus moves too far from the target, runs out of energy, the target dies, or the ability is canceled. If the target is still affected by Electrocute after a set amount of time(say a few seconds) it becomes a conduit, emitting electrical damage to nearby enemies so long as it is still the target of Electrocute and for a few seconds if the ability is canceled. Cerberus can still take part in normal combat(doesn't have to stand still) while channeling, but cannot use any other abilities other than Firebrand while Electrocute is being channeled.  Quake(name WIP): Cerberus punches the ground with his fire arm then punches the ground with his lightning arm right after. The first quake does Heat damage and has a chance to proc Heat. The second quake does Electric damage and has a chance to proc Electric. Both quakes always proc Knockback.  Pulse(name also WIP): Cerberus puts his arms together and sends out a Radioactive pulse(think Sonic Boom but all around).

You can roll to get damage reduction (and turn lethal bleed/fire/poison procs into wounding ones if you can time it right).    Do you see the problems now? Rolling should be an evasive maneuver. However, in Warframe, rolling only benefits you when shit is going to happen/already happened to you.

Just need to time each roll so that the damage ticks happen in the middle of rolling. On frames with low armor/health this might save you from a nasty bleed proc since there's a 7 seconds delay between each pulse from HP restore plates. With some low level bleed procs you can even roll to receive no bleed damage whatsoever if the damage is reduced below 0.5. Of course it is harder than it sounds, but it's really awesome if you can pull off one. In fact pre-nerfed Grineer Eviscerators force me to do this a lot."

Warframe,3dwzsu,dot1212,73,Mon Jul 20 05:57:36 2015 UTC,Honestly I just want DE to at least add more quests that aren't just to unlock new warframes. Those were the best part of a recent new player and only doing random missions can cause burnout.
Warframe,3dwzsu,GuerillaGorillas,22,Mon Jul 20 06:01:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with the idea of more quests. I really enjoyed the Mirage questline, but the Limbo questline's grinding on Excavation missions really turned me away from it. I'd rather put more time into a mission that gets me nothing, physically, but is enjoyable.  DE's putting in really good work with that starchart, from what we've seen on the Devstreams, so I'm hopeful that we'll see more lore, and some more quests to show it off too."
Warframe,3dwzsu,Over_Yonder_Hill,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:08:23 2015 UTC,"what I would have loved, is that in the new starchart, the number of mission you can see will be limited to how many planets do you have, and to unlock the planets you have to fill some requirements that will unlock a quest, but not a quest that tells you go to this map then to this one and next, but a map designed just for the quest like on many offline shooters, and make you do crazy stuff that get you understanding the reasons of why you fight, and what are you doing, it would really shut off many of the complains in the game"
Warframe,3dwzsu,ZatmanXD,6,Mon Jul 20 23:22:22 2015 UTC,"They should just give us access to all the events that they've made in the past. Even if they were re-released without the rewards that came with them, I'd still play the crap out of them. Had so much fun during the Eyes of Blight event, destroying these huge Fomorian ships."
Warframe,3dwzsu,lerobotsexy,4,Mon Jul 20 13:52:17 2015 UTC,Eyes of blight should be turned into a quest even if other events aren't. Eyes of blight was a major part of warframes story. New players like me played the archwing quest and loved that final level. I was pumped to go fight the fomorions and then I never got to do it. In addition to this the quest serves as a prelude for the law of retribution. Archwings biggest problem right now is a lack of purpose or endgame content. Turning eyes of blight into a quest should help that.
Warframe,3dwzsu,Bhizzle64,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:14 2015 UTC,"DE is kinda lacking in the manpower department when it comes to making quests. The idea for a player-created quest system has been tossed around, but who when the fuck that will happen...."

Warframe,3dwzsu,MekaTriK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:20:11 2015 UTC,"I think a way to sneak in more quests would be to make quests that award weapons. No weapon blueprints, just a straight up weapon for finishing it. Quests are pretty fun by definition, and they would also help alleviate the grind by not having you use resources you might otherwise need to grind later."
Warframe,3dwzsu,Chantoxxtreme,24,Tue Jul 21 03:08:43 2015 UTC,"Actually credit reward on higher rotations should scale up, you decided to stay over 20 waves/minutes in T4 which gives you 26K, but it should give over the amount currently being given."

Warframe,3dwzsu,OllyOllyOxycontin,2,Mon Jul 20 06:12:47 2015 UTC,"The goal you are working towards is to maintain balance across the solar system and to gain strength for the next challenge that awaits you.   That is literally all there is to it. Not to mention that all progress in WF individually is totally asynchronous with what is happening globally.   Unless you're talking about nodes being linked thematically to the boss of that planet, the whole point of the game narratively speaking is to just launch a series of pinprick strikes across both corpus and grineer uniformly so that no side gets the upper hand. You aren't trying to shove the balance of power one way or another or 'progress' to some final goal."
Warframe,3dwzsu,Skull_Tumpet,12,Mon Jul 20 06:52:52 2015 UTC,"That doesn't mean there can't be small stories here or there. Look at the Sentient questline. There's 2 quests on that so far, with a few more on the way."
Warframe,3dwzsu,Unimpressions,-7,Mon Jul 20 07:40:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does actually because writing those 'small stories' takes both time and money, same goes with developing code to put those stories together dynamically.   The reason they have been adding incremental tidbits about the sentients is because a major update about the sentients is releasing imminently"
Warframe,3dwzsu,Skull_Tumpet,7,Mon Jul 20 08:08:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's start with the Grind. Have you been playing when Xini on the old star chart was meta? When leveling any weapons taken longer, when you weren't able to unequip any weapon, so you had to wear all the three? Do you remember drop rate of Frost Prime Blueprint from T3 Exterminate? IT WAS 1% according to the wiki. 1%, Carl! I was playing with two friends and we did earned 6 T3 keys during three weeks of leveling and all of those keys were T3 Defences. There were NO TRADE, so you weren't able to even trade parts you needed. Have you heard about time, when Phobos was introduced? Miter Handle drop rate was 0,04% or 0,4%. Me and my friends killed Vor and his punny friend for about 100 times. Then i went to sleep, but my friends continued. They stayed for a whole night and achieved their goal. Btw I earned my handle many days later after the hotfix. Oh, and maybe you remember some cool grindy event, when we had to do 100 invasions to gain some cool weapon. Do you REALLY think grind is too much now?  The Story? Yeah, I really like to hear more. And the Devs are working on it, they mention it on almost each and every devstream and create those cool Simaris/Codex entries with fine speed.  Missions. Impact? No Bursa proxies! Only one Juggernaut per mission, not bunch of them. We did it, boys. Missions makes no sense? Yeah, but they were even worse with old Raid mission. Grab stuff -> copter to the target -> copter to the exit. Well done, Tenno."

Meta wasn't a problem becauce there were plenty of new things coming out and things to do because (me bieng the itty witty newb i was) the starchart had a flow, it had new missions, and plenty of people were doing all them.  nowadays i see meta,meta,meta. nobody does anything except the meta, and I hate that as much as the next guy, and this post is simply me saying that the meta is all too powerful and providing a way to counter that."
Warframe,3dwzsu,squidthesid,37,Mon Jul 20 19:34:59 2015 UTC,"First off, drop the confrontational attitude as it only hinders your argument.    In BL2, the best loot is dropped off of many, many sources, and isn't afraid to make the player powerful, because many, many other things can quickly turn the player's ego into a 3-part steak breakfast. The game isn't afraid to give you something good, even if it's overpowered, and it rewards you greatly for doing something incredibly difficult (if you need proof, search 'ancient dragons of destruction solo kill', you will be impressed)   Wasn't my experience with BL2. For the most part, the loot drops were awful, as most of the guns you found in the world were trash, meaning that most useful guns were quest rewards. However, given the exponential level scaling, they'd be useless in a few levels or so. The first game did loot much better than the second in my opinion.    Warframe has crap for loot. There. I said it. The amount of stuff you get from anything at all is pitiful.    Yep, no disagreements there. For such a loot-driven game, the actual loot we get is pretty dreadful. Oh boy, more alloy plates!    but if i'm killing an entire ship for loot, don't you think that we would have found something sweet that they would have an entire army of guards protecting?   Having rare loot containers (containing forma, BPs, rare resources, etc.) on every mission would help alleviate this issue, as well as having lockers that drop meaningful resources like neurodes, tellurium, or neural sensors (maybe making at least one a guaranteed drop on every non-endless mission).   The story of warframe is a mess, i'll put it out there.   That's implying that we even have one in the game. We have some scattered bits of narrative here and there. If you wanna call that a story, go for it, I certainly don't. But yeah, I agree with your general sentiment.   The game has so much potential to build upon the backstory of the enemy faction as well as to put doubt in our minds about the raison d'être (reason for purpose, essentially). Is the Lotus really all that benevolent? is our mass genocide and murder really justified?   DE has dipped into this with the Orokin/Stalker backstory, but there's hardly anything substantial there.  So yeah, in short, lots of potential for a fantastic lore base and story , but very little of that actually properly executed.     but aren't we at least influencing that in some way? dosn't killing a general, a captain, a councilor, a nomad, a lieutenant, and a scientist mean anything to the grineer? dosn't killing hundreds of archetypes benefit the corpus's research on how to combat us? have we never tracked down the infested's source?   On a bit of a tangent, I don't mind that we're using  guerrilla tactics (after all, the Tenno are grossly outnumbered and probably can't hold their own in a full-sized war between the Grineer/Corpus), but we have some of the most boring and standard mission types out there. With the possible exception of Spy 2.0, there is nothing new or creative about the mission types, as they're all variations of ""go here, kill enemies"" with minor variations/ gimmicks.  Anyway, onto your point, Warframe would really benefit from something like the Nemesis system in Shadow of Mordor. For example, if you've assassinated Alad V 20 times in a row, he's gonna be scared of the Tenno and highly cautious and have greater security (but be more cowardly). If you've died to him a lot, security will be lesser, as he'll be far more confident in his own abilities.   On the larger side of things, I would like to see a progress chart, maybe in a larger meta-game? That is, where the community fights back and we unlock new missions and story content as we defeat generals and bosses? This could also be set on a personal level as well, if the whole meta-game thing is too flaky. That'd definitely give us a greater sense of accomplishment as unified Tenno., that we're fighting back against the (known) major scourges of the universe."
Warframe,3dwzsu,Zhormungandr,11,Mon Jul 20 06:51:49 2015 UTC,"In regards to the nemesis system, I'm not sure just changing the way a boss reacts to you is enough.   I think that during missions, rarely, enemies will come at you that are uniquely named and more powerful (Not 'more stats, more damage' powerful, but better). Or alternatively, getting killed during a mission will do what it does in SoM and promote your killer (assuming it's not, like, a roller or osprey or something). Maybe very, very, very rarely enemies that are not blown up, cut in half, shattered, frozen or otherwise melted will come back later. Very rarely.  When promoted or encountered, they'll begin to show up during your missions and taunt you, calling you out on previous actions and events. It's rare that killing them will ever get rid of them for good, but it's possible to wipe them out entirely. If your antagonist begins to lose too many times, he/she may start to get more destructive and radical in their means, eventually going so far as to possibly start self-destruct sequences aboard ships or planetary bombardments against you.   Imagine the stories that could arise. A low-level Tenno has barely escaped Vor and moves to take the fight to him. As he drops in to the base Vor is rumored to be, a lancer spots him and opens fire. With a shot or two, the Tenno drops the lancer and moves forward into the mission without a second thought. Little did he know, the Grineer named Kreeg was not actually killed. After some time, he recovers and vows revenge against the Tenno. As reports of this same Tenno begin to spring up, he decides to take the fight to them after enhancing his robotics. Over the course of the Tenno's time in the Mercury sector, both he and Kreeg clash many times, and both grow stronger. Kreeg has forged and begins to wear armor that protects his head (because his nemesis shows such an affinity for headshots) and wields a Gorgon modified to fire cryogenic rounds. His Tenno opponent, on the other hand, has crafted a rifle capable of shredding armor and modded it to fire explosive rounds. In their final battle within the Mercury sector, however, Kreeg bests his rival and kills him after springing upon him an ambush comprised of several eximus units. This garners the attention of Vay Hek, who promotes Kreeg and offers to outfit him with enhanced robotics, much like himself. Knowing full well that Tenno never truly die, he agrees. Months later, that same Tenno finds himself purifying a ship of the infested within the Eris sector. Without warning, his comms crackle and a familiar (if not slightly electronically modified) face appears. With a laugh, Kreeg commands the Tenno to surrender or else the entire ship will be blown to shreds by the dozens of galleons that have moved into position around the wreckage. Before uttering a response, the Tenno is thrown from his feet as a barrage of heavy gauss-fire batters the hull and shatters much of the already-crippled ship.   etc. etc. etc.  I think that something like this would be awesome. Also, this would obviously be exclusive to a single Tenno: one Tenno's rival won't suddenly start taunting another Tenno, even if they're in the same mission. Also, they're not 100% going to show up in any given mission. Hell, it may not even be a 20% chance of happening, and it's even lower if your nemesis isn't of the same faction as the one you're currently fighting. Maybe once you and your nemesis are very far along in your conflict, unique alerts will become available to only you that will allow you to sabotage their plans or make another attempt on their life. These alerts would offer unique rewards based on the extent of your conflicts and would probably start giving out some pretty good stuff later on. Not prime parts, most likely. (Unless, of course, the nemesis has stumbled upon an Orokin vault/artifact and the alert is to keep them from taking everything in it. Hell, it'd be a fine way to reintroduce the raid mission type.) Obviously it'd be hella work, but it would probably pay off. It'd also be a shitton of dialogue. However, I'd absolutely adore DE if they did this."
Warframe,3dwzsu,IncredibleMeh,4,Mon Jul 20 08:57:55 2015 UTC,"A system like this for Warframe would be wondrous. Could you imagine playing a normal mission, and seeing a Tenno clash with one of his rivals?

Warframe,3dwzsu,Zhormungandr,2,Mon Jul 20 15:23:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, a system like this would be really sweet, but it would never fit into the lore of warframe.  (also, it's a little stereotypical, ever heard of The Incredibles?)  For this to work a defected, broken down clone that requires a full set of armor just to hold themselves together has to be promoted through the ranks incredibly fast. We never hear of any grineer that got a rank just by sitting around, not killing tenno or tenno sympathizers."
Warframe,3dwzsu,Herby20,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:30 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, we never really hear about much at all. Of the literal billions of Grineer, we only know about maybe 12, tops. Besides, what about skirmishes with the Corpus? Leading successful recovery efforts into the Void? Cleansing the Infestation? Helping develop new technologies (if the individual is capable, of course). Stuff goes on within the game that doesn't involve the Tenno. A lot of stuff.  Also, literally every Grineer is a broken-down clone. Vor is literally a head. So is Vay Hek. It's not a stretch to assume that Grineer can be promoted quickly either. And how doesn't it fit, if I may ask? It doesn't exactly conflict with any existing lore and doesn't really introduce any big revelations on it's own.   Also, yeah the Incredibles. It's a pretty typical nemesis story. Nothing special. It doesn't need to be, though, because of the depth it would add to gameplay."

The big thing with BL2 is that it isn't afraid to give players rare or legendary quality weapons. Although some of that legendary loot was garbage compared to end game stuff, it was often really useful for quite a few levels. And because the game wasnt afraid to drop good, worthwhile loot, you would find a new weapon to hold you over until you got to the end game or found your next legendary.   I agree that weapons tended to fall off really hard, but grenade mods, shields, and mods especially were great at having long term benefits. I used one of my mods from my first play through until I was 72 and gearing up for OP levels."

It's a straight upgrade in gameplay, but as a loot simulator it fell flat because 90% of the time every chest had nothing but shitty greens and whites. Replaying 1 and 2 i was greeted by blues and purps very early on in BL1 whereas BL2 barely gave you anything above blue with any frequency, and yellows literally took hours upon hours of grinding certain bosses to get. I was always excited to open chests in BL1, but after a while in BL2 i just didn't even care anymore.  Don't even get me started on vendors, in 1 i'd very often find yellows and purps all the time in vendors, whereas in 2 i just stopped checking altogether except to sell stuff since it was literally all whites and one item that may or may not be also not a white.   If we want to compare loot, BL1 was a lot better in terms of rewarding the player. As well as the fact the scaling in 1 allowed you to use powerful weapons for much, much longer."

We have archwing, raids, Cephalon Simaris, Syndicates, Social Hubs, revamped conclave all in VERY basic forms that aren't terribly exciting at this stage.

Discussing it, or taking in hypotheticals won't speed up time or flesh out the parts we would like to see fleshed out. That's all down to DE's internal roadmap and how they choose to prioritize the development of their game.   I for one wholeheartedly wish that they finally release a pump action shotgun alongside their Shotgun/Sniper Buff, but I am totally prepared for disappointment.   Now I certainly can't fault the OP for feeling the way he does. Everyone who gets to the mid-late game content starts to see the polish wearing thin and begins to question what exactly they are spending their time and in some cases, money on.   The fact of the matter is that bringing that posting this here doesn't really fix the game or make the OP feel any better. We all well know what's wrong with the game, and threads like this rarely convince the OP to give the game another shot.

They also don't have big budget teams that can work on all parts of the game at once. Right now we are still in the base level expansion phase of warframe where the ground floor is being laid for future projects. Hell, they are still revamping core systems like damage and parkour, so of course they aren't going to be doing anything too crazy with story or rewards.

But something to take the edge off late game grinding, perhaps a double down system, where you double down once, and you start at level 21(for defense) or level 5 for interception or with more hazards/enemies for non-endless missions. and to compensate you get to see 2 picks from the drop table each time and pick one of them, sort of in the same spirit as chasing down those caches in void sabotage. and you could double down a second time to see 3 and pick 2. something to actually challenge high level players without waiting till the end of an hour long endless void mission to actually need to use your full kit and enjoy yourself. As it is, you have to waste at least half an hour doing nothing more than video game paperwork before you finally have to start trying, and then you are finally at risk to enjoy yourself. So respect the high level players, give them some reward for the extra risk/missed pulls at the loot table in the easy rounds. Its like a super car(pick your favorite). If you never leave town with the stop signs and the tight corners, all that power goes to waste. You need to let it out in open country where you can floor the accelerator and let the horses under the hood run!     Here is the other thing. Shooters like this are fun because there is an unknown element. The most fun i have with this game anymore is when a new tile set comes out. You get to ogle at the pretty scenes, but more importantly you never know quite what is around that next corner, what tactical conundrum awaits? Even once you get used to the map, the enemies move about at least somewhat randomly, but when you have played that tile set 1000 times, you learn all the rooms, how the rooms look on the minimap, all the traps and triggers, all the spawn points, id be willing to be 95% of all the ""secret"" rooms (""proving a null hypothesis"" prevents a guarantee there), you even memorize all the spots the AI get stuck so you can go coup de grace them. also right now, there are multiple ways through the room, but there is only ever one right door, and dead ends are almost always prohibitively pointless to explore dead ends. my suggestion here is to make multiple ways through the map, with side objectives perhaps even hidden side objectives at the start. and so player decisions actually mean something. do i want to bee line for the exit? do i explore? does the team split up to clear all the rooms? the rooms themselves dont even need to change too much, you just need to string them together in a less linear fashion, and more like say, a building or a complex or a ship that we are supposedly in. That memorization of the room details goes from being a boring detriment to the palette for interesting choices. The player feels empowered, in control, like a ninja infiltrating a system or defensive network as opposed to a boxcar rolling down the railroad tracks."

Warframe,3dwzsu,koekjeszijnjammie,8,Tue Jul 21 09:34:55 2015 UTC,"You know... you had some good points. And you still do, really.   But halfway through the post, it started sounding really... standoff-ish, like you were already shielding your post from counter arguments before they even happened.   And that Borderlands 2 part. Dude, it sounded more like you'd love to turn Warframe into BL2 and... just... no. Warframe is a game about grinding, and so is Borderlands 2. That's true. But that doesn't automatically make whatever works for BL2 work in Warframe. You can't compare grinding Hyperius for a Norfleet or two, to grinding resources to build that gun you want, or farming cores / credits to max out that Heavy Caliber so you can try out that build you had in mind.  Just think how freaking tedious would be to have to kill bosses to get a few resources for whatever weapon / part you want to build. Nope. Not Happening.  Let's got just a little bit deeper.  In BL2 you have 6 characters with three skill trees each, and they're all really versatile, there's a lot of time to be spent building your guy to suit your playstyle, getting the weapons / coms / relics you need, etc. In Warframe you just switch to another frame. I need to farm some Oxium? Alright, i'll get my Pilfering Swarm Hydroid and ask some clanmates to help. Now i need to level up my sweet new Kohm, but i also want some cores for that stupid Heavy Caliber i want for my Soma Prime. Triton it is. Or perhaps i can leech Draco for a while and then do Triton.  So... there's grinding in both games. Yes. But why you grind and what you do it for is different. How you approach it is different. With a good build you can solo most things BL2, you'll need a good strategy and a lot of trial and error, but it's doable. You'll get what you seek eventually. In Warframe you can't do almost nothing by yourself, you'll need help eventually. Sometimes you're not even there for your own gain, you're just helping a friend, a clanmate, or i dunno...  perhaps you're just trying to have fun (remember fun?).  TL;DR: What i'm trying to say is, they are similar games on a surface level, but the deeper you get you realize they're not that similar, and just trying to replicate what works in one game on the other, is just a half-assed thought."
Warframe,3dwzsu,Ryjeon,2,Mon Jul 20 09:00:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this, really.  I defend my arguments pre-argument because that's who I am, and I learned that in this community that people will call you a stupid moron if you say something they disagree with, or they throw out a one-liner meme to call you a dickwad indirectly. I really appreciate people like you for this critisism.  I do have to back myself up though, i'm fully aware that BL2 is not Warframe and vice versa, I would hate for them to be the same game, but all i'm saying is that there are some elements of BL2 that warframe could benefit from.   Just think of how freaking tedious would be to have to kill bosses to get a few resources for whatever weapon / part you want to build. Nope. Not happening   I got a little lost here, if you were talking about warframe, than this is exactly what happens already, need orokin cells? go to Saturn, Ceres, or the derelict bosses. Need neural sensors? haul your ass to alad, he's got you covered, if you have a little gentle persuasion. If you were talking about BL2, then yes, it would be really annoying to build a weapon out of individual parts, but it dosn't. Sorry if I went moron here, i'm just not good at reading.  They are indeed similar games, yes, and i know they aren't that similar, i wasn't saying that i would like BL2 to be replicated into warframe, but some things just changed to be similar so that players wouldn't have a difficult time getting to the high ranks."
Warframe,3dwzsu,Ryjeon,8,Mon Jul 20 19:21:52 2015 UTC,"First, comparing Borderlands (any of them), which is FPS gun porn,  to a PvE game like Warframe is completely nonsensical. They are not even remotely the same game. Second, the reason most people get burnt out on grinding for stuff is because they focus specifically on that thing. They want a certain weapon or warframe so all they do is play a single level until they get the part they need. Then they build that thing, max it as fast as possible, and put it in their dusty arsenal of weapons and warframes where it will gather dust for eternity unless the developers give them a reason to use it. When you reach a certain level like myself and many other players, this is all there really is to do and so you get burnt out. There is also the other side of things where people see these players who have been in game for quite some time, they see their weapons and warframes and how powerful they are and say to themselves ""I want that now""; So they get it as fast as they can. The problem with this way of thinking is that you get these weapons and you don't experience what many of the older players have. You don't experience the struggle to get there.   What happens is that the new players get these OP weapons and stroll through content that they are supposed to have trouble with. Then they get to the part of the game all the veterans are at faster and become mindless grinding robots. Now, before you think I'm trying to point fingers and blame something, I'm not. These things happen and you can't really prevent them. That being said, I had to work my ass off to get where I am, I had to unlock planets, build up keys, build my own clan, fund my own research, and get my mods by myself. It was a hard ride but I enjoyed every single part of it because I did not have any kind of OP shit to act as my crutch and hide how unskilled I was in the beginning. And I'm not going to lie, I died a lot. I spent plat on things I shouldn't have. I wasted resources on things that I should have never touched. But I learned and had fun.  Now, while some players may think they are being helpful to newbies by helping them get Boltor Primes and Loki Primes, I can say without a doubt in my mind that they are not. The faster a new player gets the best gear in the game the faster they will reach the point where all there is to do is grind, and the faster they will get burnt out.   Again I'm not here to say the game is too grind heavy or that the RNG is bullshit, or that it is the players fault for not playing a certain way. That type of thing only causes dissent in the community and shuts down any conversation that needs to happen. I am simply sharing my experience and what I have observed over my years of playing this game."

And you're not the first person to write like this in this community. You don't need to make a caricature of your opposition to validate your points.   I'm not saying your points are otherwise invalid. You obviously have a lot to say. And of course your points are valid because it's a perspective piece. I just think your points would be better served without pre-sniping your potential audience. You want to call someone out after the fact that's different. I just think this particular approach is in bad faith.

Warframe,3dwzsu,Iguphobia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:46:01 2015 UTC,I didn't take it personally. I got exasperated because it's such a common tack on message boards to caricature opposition this way. As if all people who hold an opinion are exactly the same. It's ridiculous when done seriously. To open a discussion and not leave any room for opposing dialogue is repugnant. It basically says if you don't like what I'm saying you must be this thing. The only reason I re-evaluated this post is because the the author proved that wasn't what he set out to do by his response to my own opposition by answering me with further context.

It's just weird to me because you're caricaturing fanboys, but anyone who would bother to come to subreddit dedicated to one game is probably a fan of some sort or another.    It's a weird framing choice since your piece isn't even that disagreeable. It's a pretty succinct breakdown of the state of the game overall told from a veterans perspective. It really didn't need the strawman. That political debate must have worn on you hard. I'd love to read your Amazon reviews.

Warframe,3dwzsu,GrimoireOfAlice,3,Tue Jul 21 01:34:37 2015 UTC,"The grind can get boring and burn you out of you bring the exact same frames and strategies to every mission, and repeat them ad nauseam until you obtain X prime parts/loot. That's when mixing up your approach on those missions is essential to keep you sane. Sure, a frost, nova, mesa and trinity are very effective, but any well modded and coordinated team can do 20 waves/minutes of any mission. Get four embers and have watch everything burn, or a melee fest with volt and valkyr, or my favorite, a rave party with smite infusion Oberon! Yes, some missions and areas are lucrative than others, but if you're playing only for loot, you'll forget this a game meant to be played for fun and not a second job where you press buttons until you get what you want.  As for the story and our actions affecting the solar system, if they give us new story-related content, we'll gobble it up and ask for more. Not every individual mission will have an affect on the grand scheme of things. We have had some impact however. Didn't we cure Alad V of the infestation? aren't some of our relays destroyed?  We're making small steps, I guess.  I would really like to see a mission re-work though. Nobody ever plays starchart captures, exterminates, sabotages, or deceptions because it's just not worth their time. DE needs to add something to give them replay value.

Though those points come from the fact that Warframe is an ongoing game. It's not a final and released product like BL2 was.  It also uses a very different economy than BL2 so all your comparisons are flawed to a point. Compare what can be compared. Not only that but I'll do what you dared us to: BL2's loot sucked. Honestly it fell into the first pitfall on the path of action RPGs and loot: you keep a gun for 1 hour if you're lucky before getting something better.  Sure it's nice and dandy, you got something better, but you know what? The few guns that actually don't feel like crap (and I mean feeling-wise, not stat-wise) in BL2 I'd like to keep for more than 3 missions, but noo, a bigger boomstick appears and you obviously have to pick it up because it crushes yours in terms of stats. Then all it becomes is the age-old game of comparing stats every 5 minutes on every gun that has a blue, orange or purple name. Gets tiring. Didn't like it. Did like BL2 and 1 though, but their loot system wasn't great and most of their weapons, while they looked somewhat nice, felt like firing an empty water gun.  To get back to your Warframe problem, you should get your fix on story from other games and diminish your Warframe dedicated playtime imo. Or just stop playing for a little while :P"

Warframe,3dwzsu,NotEspeciallyClever,2,Mon Jul 20 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"Living story that unfolds with events is the right way to go.  Though they need to add more player agency to this, and make them actually matter/useful.  I think void trader for example is a wasted opportunity.  Player performance in events should directly affect what he has on sale for example.   Borderlands has plenty of static story content, but you easily burn through them.  Remember that it takes a lot of $$$ to make static story but it last very short amount of time and rarely replayable.  It is never cost efficient to use theme park story as a way to keep up with 30hr/week play style.  Live event is the way to keep players entertained.  They also need to hire better designer for enemy types, especially reward for shooter-mechanic.  Shooting gets really monotonous unless you reward focus on weak point or trick shots to keep players on their edge.  Right now most of the enemies do not have this at all.  Spray and pray or spam ability is why combat gets dull and loot is the only reason you do them.  Also, shooter mechanic doesn't mean difficulty btw.  Shooter mechanic is more like interesting weakpoint-based mechanics, or shoot a slow-moving grenade that arch toward you (so you have to aim up and actually shoot it).  Their current enemy design is purely about either ""how to slow player down and how to kill/annoy them"" or ""new cool things to look at while shooting.""  They need to focus on ""enemies that are fun to fight against.""   All these invincible, one-shot-kill, crazy auto-aim... lazy enemy design to create ""challenge"" by being OP.  More mission type is also always good to keep people interested.  Their designers also need to work harder at making tilesets that play different in fun (not dull/dreadful) ways.  Factory tileset for example is a lost opportunity in many ways.  Where's conveyor belt gameplay?  How about things you can shoot/topple/activate to crush or burn your enemies."

Instead the game seems to be design by gimmick or tangent.  I doubt DE, with its current leadership will stop with the tangents, as they are likely a symptom of the project leads and because of that Warframe will always be an incomplete partially polished game with many tangents of content that barely work or have been forgotten about in favour of new tangents.  The new solar map is a chance for everything to be combined into a single coherent vision. But whether DE are willing to burn down some of the old systems to make that happen remains to be seen."

Warframe,3dwzsu,EmpireXD,2,Mon Jul 20 14:43:54 2015 UTC,"The problem with Warframe isn't just on Warframe. It's on the players it attracts. Gamers have been encouraged to level and grind forever and despite what they say they like it. They like leveling things and optimizing.   Warframe's issue is that it has so much content to devour that when it finally runs out people don't know what to do so they keep grinding a little and drift.   I like Warframe for the gameplay and the variety of weapons and frames. I do frequently do the normal grinding for rep but I'm trying more to just explore weapons and frames and help out new players because that's fun.   All that said, DE could make missions a little more rewarding but we'd all be happier if we didn't worry about the rewards so much."
Warframe,3dwzsu,Fullmetal9780,2,Mon Jul 20 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"Well put! Especially with the Bl2 comparison. I had never actually put any time into Bl2 until about 1.5k hours into Warframe (fighting burnout). One of the biggest things that surprised me about it was how everything was so well balanced. Even in UVHM! I even had a blast farming for stuff! This was an entirely new experience for me and really made me realize how much of a downer Warframe can be. Yes, the game is super fun. But the grind...   I started a new account for the hell of it and trying to get started from scratch is a nightmare. Balancing resources, credits, and slots is a crappy experience for me (a 2k+ hour veteran with nearly every weapon and mod in the game). Imagine how that is for new players! For example, one of my biggest difficulties was choosing between leveling a mod or purchasing a new weapon. Not that it was that big of a deal since I could just go run Seimeni a few times and have the credits for what I want. But new players don't have that luxury. They have to run dozens of missions just to scrape up enough money to be able to upgrade their gear a couple levels at best. DE really nees to fix this shit.  and add actual lore, year of quality my ass.  Tl;dr - Warframe is as grindy as I am long winded, and the new player experience is shit."

Warframe,3dwzsu,Telogor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"What are Warframes? Who are we, who are the tenno in respect to the greater intergalactic landscape? Who is Lotus? Is she friend or foe to us, to the universe? Why do we fight? Is that cause valid? Why did we leave this galaxy originally, and why are we being summoned now?   You must understand, saving the world is much more complicated than simple violence and I feel that if Warframe wanted a deep innovative story exploring that would be the answer.  As a story teller these are the immediate questions that come up when playing warframe, that warframe officially still hasn't addressed. And could boost the content and integrity of the lore infinitely more. Even if DE didn't go out of their way to define these things, (Because shrouding integral facts in mysteriousness is a poor storyteller's ploy at disguising they are a poor storyteller) I feel just the pursuit of finding out what warframes are and why they were designed can easily make a compelling story just as well. Why not explore it? The potential of the story aspect behind warframe is so overwhelming it leaves me itchy.  They could make it episodic, or an entire saga following the lotus, they could separate the episodes into in-depth character analysis following each warframe, or even just base it on the historical and political events occurring on each planet. A story module could be called, Chapter IV: Jupiter, or Episode 7: Loki. The story line could easily be the end game, a very, very interesting endgame too with a chooseable ending.   I mean imagine this, after reaching MR20 Lotus sends you a message saying: ""Tenno everything you've experienced until now has been a simulation, you are no ready to face the real world. Wake up tenno"" And the Liset expands and unfolds outwards like inception and you're now fully engrossed in the warframe storyline."

With Warframe you can run missions that are guaranteed to give you something decent at the end. Things like corrupted mods are promised at the end of missions...which is muuuuuuch better than Borderlands .005% drops off enemies.   Also...I think with 2k hours played in any game the fun will start to dull."
Warframe,3dwzsu,lavantant-is-me,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:49:17 2015 UTC,"I agree almost with everything, comparing the loot to the one in borderlands is a bad thing, you have to think that warframe uses short quick missions (excluding endless) even if the enemies are hard you can end it in 5 to 10 minutes, giving a rewarding sistem for people who do chuck norris kind of stuff (AKA almost all the vet players) there wouldnt be enough items to reward, because all the weapons are unique and dont have many variations how games like borderlands and mass effect do, and it's already too late to change that kind of stuff, but I agree with the rest"
Warframe,3dwzsu,Telogor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:17:35 2015 UTC,If you want borderlands loot it would be like if instead of what we have no you get like 5-10 weapon drops per level but they all have a random amount of preset mods installed that have random levels and your gonna spend your life looking for that 1 gun that has the right combination of mods that also have levels in them.  Tbh im sick of that type of arpg loot system and much prefer warframe for a change of pace. If I want borderlands ill go play borderlands.

Warframe,3dwzsu,Inuma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:40:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points. Except quitting. Kinda weird how we look at the same info, feel the same way, but complete opposite choices at the end.  First off, the reason I kept playing in the beginning was the same as everyone else - because I saw the potential of the game. The foundation it's building can become a truly magnificent game if DE let's it. I don't think these ""I'm quitting"" posts should be ridiculed. Everyone has a different fuse and for some people the wait for the game's metamorphosis is just too long. People are running out of patience and honestly they shouldn't be blamed. Like someone else said DEs greatest trick was making us all believe in the potential of the game. Everyone has a different threshold for how long they will wait and it's getting to look more and more like DE tricked us all. It will really be unfortunate if the game is never complete.  I really do agree on so many points you made though. I've said for a long time that Warframe won't hit it's stride until there is more to the game than just going somewhere and killing. It won't appeal to a broader player base or achieve critical acclaim until there's people to talk to, reasons to play the game, story that actually engages you, reasons to actually explore the huge procedurally generated maps, and honestly even just the bare minimum of mindless MMO elements would help at this point. Kind of a sorry state when killing 10 boars or courier quests would drastically increase depth...  The sate that the game is in now you do actually have to find reasons to keep playing. For me personally? It's teaching. I've actually started accepting people to my previously solo clan and I'm showing them the ropes. I don't want or need anything in the game and it's more engaging to get in and teach someone where to go for specific mods, how to play certain missions, advise them on trades, and for the more advanced players teach them the meta game. You end up with excess loot anyway and now more people know how to play effectively. Also still a little bit of hope for that potential that DE promises. At this point I won't be surprised if this is just the game in its entirety and in a year or less I'll stop playing but for now DE keeps saying the right things to make me believe. I hope this game finally gets on track."

Warframe,3dwzsu,Flatline_hun,2,Tue Jul 21 20:33:00 2015 UTC,"TL:DR: this grind of warframe is a burnout wall, but can be fixed if the devs focus on the story, the rewards, and the difficulty, if you don't believe me, take a look at the borderlands franchise and say that they did it wrong, go ahead I dare you.   Comparing a single player game meant for 1-4 people vs an MMO game. wat.   I take it, you as an avid Borderlands advocate are aware of how many people were annoying that a random cheater could go in, drop legendary loot by the dozens in the first 2 games? (no idea about pre-sequel)   In BL2, the best loot is dropped off of many, many sources, and isn't afraid to make the player powerful   Again 1-4 players. Have a random OP guy coming to your story? Leave. There was a checkpoint 1.5 minutes back. Have a MR19 coptering Saryn come to your earth exterminate when you just started?

Warframe,3dwzsu,Skull_Tumpet,2,Mon Jul 20 14:14:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of what burns players out is the limit of potatoes (yes I know you can buy plat or trade prime parts for plat then buy them, but hear me out on this)  With the limit on the number of potatoes you get, it's hard to experiment with weapons or new frames without committing one of these hard to get resources to the item.  I feel like this leads to a lot of the burnout players are experiencing because it's much safer (and cheaper) to reuse tried and true frame / weapon combinations than it is to potato a Mitre and go try to see how long you can last in t4 survival with one.  Why figure out how to properly mod an oberon to be useful in a high tier environment when you'd have to commit one of your few reactors to him?  For veteran players or people who are willing to watch for alerts / play on a day where one of these alerts show up this problem is very mitigated, but think about it from a new player's perspective.  Unless they drop money on the game they're going to have to wait it out for an indefinite amount of time (god forbid they are unable to play on the day of the alerts with potatoes), so these players go google what the best weapons and frames are instead of exploring the weapons in game themselves, because they'd have to commit such a rare resource to even try them.   Thinking of it from a player's (in that situation) perspective, the game seems extremely off putting to play, let alone sink money into, if I'm feeling forced to have to buy potatoes to explore weapons and frames freely.  tl;dr potatoes are still a problem for newer players"
Warframe,3dwzsu,Tosick,2,Mon Jul 20 07:20:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, the problem with Warframe is not the grind, because it is essential to such a game like this, but it is not rewarding. I have around 180 hours of steam on it I think and I stopped playing it for now. The reason for that is, that the endcontent is not available or it is really bad designed. For example lets take Path of Exile. They both have the same game concept, it is about grinding items and trying out new characters / warframes. But the hunt in Path of Exile is way more fun with the lootplosions from the  mobs and the environment.       I guess the best way would be to copy cat a essential part of Path of Exile and Diablo and that would be maps. A quick run down: Maps are the endcontent of those games. After you finished the game by beating the end boss or such a like, you are able to run maps. The maps are randomly created tilesets from one theme of an area with a specific area boss. Something like that would make the endgame of Warframe a lot healthier."

Warframe,3dzq1b,Croopies,-7,Mon Jul 20 21:42:18 2015 UTC,AOE stun   Aoe stagger with the chance at a knockdown.   super damage amp   It's an okay ability. Weakspot can sometimes be in a hard to hit spot but the damage is nice.   moving stun   actually it's a really poor stealth.

Warframe,3dzq1b,Fronteror,2,Mon Jul 20 21:53:40 2015 UTC,"Actually sonic boom is guaranteed ragdoll, always (unless ancient healers, but those guys are stupid anyway). Bright orange sonar is easy to spot and kill. Silence is probably the worst ability but it stuns enemies who go into your range of silence for a good 4 seconds, which is very useful. Also sound quake guaranteed stunlocks even with ancient healers, though I admit standing in one place is not the best idea."
Warframe,3dzq1b,NotEspeciallyClever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:17:16 2015 UTC,I agree with you. But Sonar can sometimes come in tricky places. Like under all the fat rolls or whatever it is that the grineer have. Banshee is the best though. My favorite ability on her is actually Silence.

I havent played since the last event (Im pretty hype for parkour 2.0 though!) but I think what kept me in so long was just finding new ways to play the game. Having every frame is one thing, but knowing how to use them is totally different. I mained oberon way back when, before his rework and when he was still dropped by Vay Hek on earth. His usefulness dropped off pretty quick unfortunately and I had to move on to other frames. Last I played I picked him up again and my GOD is he a sweet ass frame to use. Im sure if I hopped back on to warframe now I could have hours of fun just swapping between frames and weapons and trying to kick ass with what I've got. Trying to collect all the weapons and maxing them can be fun too. I've got nearly all the melee weapons except primes maxed out in my codex. Pretty proud of that."

When there's no stuff to grind for anymore, I do PvP: warframe's got better in that department too, lately.  Ah yes, and you don't have to stand still for the hard stuff.

At the time I think I was waiting for something to tide me over until Borderlands PreSequel came out. Once I started playing however I was hooked and thank god BL Presequel took a back seat.  I remained an avid player for the first 5 months. Slowly but surely building up my arsenal and repertoire of warframes and weapons. The next 4 months were still fun, but my enjoyment of the game began to wane a bit. At that point I was a bit tired of the ""new"" content meant to invigorate the game, but ultimately ended up flat. Kubrows, Archwing, Syndicates,Relays, new mod UI, new game modes (excavation,SPy 2.0) that became rather dull in my opinion once you figure out the ins and outs of the vault rooms for example. All these things just failed to make the game more fun for me. They were like fireworks, super hyped up and fresh for the first few days, but failing to hold my attention in the long run.   Right now we are in the last few months (3 months as MR18-19) and I am sorry to say that playing warframe feels more a chore then fun. I miss that feeling of building a weapon that looks cool and finding it was complete and utter crap or the goddamn finger of god.  And you know what I think that is alright. I think taking a break from warframe is something that was a long time coming. Wait for the arsenal to replenish with some new weapons. And hope The Sentients do not end up like archwing.   For now Warframe is something to tide me over until Fallout 4 comes out, in the meanwhile I will just pop into random missions, help out lower level clan mates or random players.

Warframe,3dxj23,Inuma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:18:31 2015 UTC,"My own personal growth.  I don't really care for any of the Primes and if I get Prime parts, I just add them to the collection as I work towards my own personal goals.  I am working on the Spy missions as Loki to see how they're done and then I'll be using different frames to work through this with different mindsets in mind.  I don't use Rhino because he's too beastly for Spy missions in my mind but having Banshee or Mirage do the missions seems appealing just to have said challenge of going full stealth with a non stealth frame.  I just completed the starchart to have my own access to every mission that I want and to begin looking into stronger frames and mods.  I try to keep from singling out mods to attain because it's just not worth it to me.  I've gotten mostly what I needed and just continue to get the skills with other Frames as I level up.  Eventually, I hope that I'll have more.  But for now, it's just the little goals that keep the game diverse which keep me going."

Combine that with the art style, and I just can't get enough of the game."

Warframe,3dxj23,othilious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:40:38 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much in the same boat.  Been playing since closed beta, recently got to MR18 with enough of a levelling backlog to get well into MR19.  I was burning myself out going the ""optimal"" route, doing XP farms over and over or grinding the void for ducats.   The Raids don't really interest me, at all. Their implementation just isn't that fun to me and as a result, I've never been interested in completing one. I've made two attempts, both of which were foiled due to technical issues rather than gameplay problems.  So for me, what's left?  A few things pull me back in occasionally:   Helping out other players (both new and old). The arrival of new content / big updates(currently doing a Simaris scan once or twice a day for the Simulor). Events or other things that change the status Quo/advance the lore or otherwise bring something new to the table.   Other than these things, I occasionally boot up a Warframe just to grab a less-used weapon and do a random mission. I'm particularly fond of the Spy 2.0 missions. Building a themed load-out and taking it for a few spins is also a nice break from the usual top-tier gameplay you tend to be squeezed into at higher levels.  In most of these cases, I'm playing ""just for fun"", without any real reward. Maybe some XP for a weapon in my backlog.  And honestly, there is nothing wrong with taking a break once a while. No game can hold your attention permanently and Warframe is no exception. Delete your load-outs, remove all your mods from their slots and skip an update (or two). When you come back you'll feel like playing with a clean slate.  Whatever you do, don't burn yourself out trying to ""force"" yourself to play. That's not playing. That's work."

Warframe,3dxj23,Asilidae000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:56 2015 UTC,"I play it because once you get past the WarFrame Wiki and read about the game you learn how stupidly simple it is to play. It so nice to just log in, hop in clan chat and host a T4S for 30 or 40m and then get off the game and get back to life. Hell on my lunch i have time to host a t4s for 30m and STILL have time to eat.  The simplicity of this game is why i play it. Playing it obsessively will ruin the game, i would say in this instance Warframe is best played casually and not 16 hours at a time over and over."

That's not an insult to me that's a really good thing, games like League of legends, hearthstone and other online games require attention and sometimes I don't want to think . But other than that its fun to add more to your arsenal, the trick is to not realize that having every frame and weapon is really inconsequential. A good way to want to play the game more is to not play for like 3 months, you'll miss a lot of stuff and feel like you have something to do."

Maybe I'll try a fun and wonky build such as carpet bomb Mirage (Mirage + Attica w/ Thunderbolt), that's always fun.  Sometimes I set a goal to get a prime weapon together, so I just play a void mission here and there, but I never grind for too long cause then you get the burnout which will cause me to quit the game for a long time.  For me, I set goals but then slowly and steadily work towards them, it's a game that I love, and I want to enjoy it, so I never really want to turn it into a grind."

I have my reasons why I quit playing, but the major one is definitively getting disillusioned with Warframe and DE themselves.  Let me give you an analogy to how I feel about Warframe, imagine being a soldier in a war that has been going for so long that no one knows how or why it even started. You don't know whose war you are fighting or who you even fight.  Part of me, hopes for something to pull me back in. Time will tell if DE manages to do just that. :)"

Warframe,3dxj23,braindead5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:54 2015 UTC,"MR19 here. I've gotten just about everything I can in the game and seen just about everything there is to it.  When I don't know what to do and feel bored in the game, I help others. I run missions for new players and help them in their first steps into the game. There's something about helping and teaching others about the game that is enjoyable to me.  Another thing I do for fun is test out off-meta builds, weapons, combos and team comps.  Sometimes, I take on a challenge and try my best to complete it. Recently, I've been trying out raids with smaller and smaller groups of pubs to see how efficient a team I can forge.  It sounds like you're burnt out from doing the same thing over and over again. It's at this point of a progression game where you either make goals for yourself or take a break. I've done both, and there's no shame in taking a break. Perhaps there's something else that is more worth your attention, and that's okay."
Warframe,3dxj23,Jaawa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:32 2015 UTC,"I play to discover what's new and to experience it, so I return after a big update hits. Taking long breaks is a good thing with any game, people get used to things, things lose their magic - not because the magic is gone, but because our senses get dulled.  Everytime I return, Warframe always reminds me how I like the art style, the basic gameplay loops of the endless gamemodes, the thoroughly enjoyable act of killing a whole roomful of enemies with cool powers or weapons, the themes and the bits of lore.  Might not work for everyone, but it works for me, a couple months playing other games, then returning to Warframe for a week or however long the new content takes to experience and thoroughly enjoy, then back to other games.  DE is doing something right with Warframe, since I keep coming back and I still enjoy their new content. The only thing I ask for is more story and lore. Speaking of which, I have a very good feeling about the incoming Sentient stuff in the next big update."

Warframe,3dxj23,drew967,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:02 2015 UTC,"Mr8 here, when I first started playing I did because it looked interesting to me and the whole concept of the game to me was new since I used to play CS GO before this. Even though I still play CS GO a lot, I use this as a stress reliever. What I usually do is about 1-2 games of CS GO, then do whatever I want in Warframe. Especially if during those CS GO games, I have to deal with assholes on my team.   Also, trying to figure out new loadouts and new weapons/frames is pretty good. I remember when I first was starting to get burnt out, I built Ember p and that got me hooked again. Honestly, the best thing that keeps me going in this game isnt building new weapons, but building new frames does it for me."

Warframe,3dxj23,AmGeraffeAMA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:47 2015 UTC,"I also had a lull about MR7-8, when I was a bit bored and going to quit. I used the same weapons and frame all the time and there weren't enough players to make squads and work through the mission nodes that I wanted to do.  Then I changed to a different frame and weapons, realised the game could be played in completely different ways and set about collecting every weapon and frame out there.  I get bored grinding the same mission, so usually have a couple of targets for the day, then hop around helping clan members or randoms get stuff they need and using obscure combinations to do it while coming back to my goal every now and again.  Often I'll jump on for an hour at dinner, get into it and play until 5am. Sometimes I'll just play an hour, or a couple of missions. The thing that makes the difference for me usually is the people I'm playing with.  Right now I have 5/6 frames that I want to forma. To just grind them back to lvl30 wouldn't be fun at all, so I'll forma 1 and leave it waiting until a newb needs help with something and jump in there. I'm still looking for loki P, so if a T4d comes up I'll run one of them. If anyone wants to key farm I'll jump in for a run or two. That's a good couple of hours playing and doesn't at all feel grindy or boring."

Warframe,3dxj23,RyojinOrion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:11:27 2015 UTC,"I've got a few reasons. First is because I simply like the game. I find it fun, even after all this time playing and doing the same things over and over. Part of the reason it doesn't end up feeling super stale to me is that I like to play solo and make my own fun in missions. I set challenges for myself to complete, I create little stories about what's going on in the mission as I play, I search for bugs, exploits, and map holes, etc.  The second reason is because I feel the need to collect everything and master it all, which I am slowly working through. This is the one that seems to kill a lot of peoples enjoyment of the game. They end up just doing expfarming until they have nothing left to master and quit because they are bored after all that or they just get sick of it and quit.  The third reason is that it is the only non-mmorpg game my friends and I all play. I've never been a huge mmorpg fan, and even less so the fantasy-themed ones they like to play."
Warframe,3dxj23,KingWaluigi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:51 2015 UTC,"1298 hours, MR10(A lot of unranked weapons and a few frames lol).  I spend most of my time helping low level people, sitting in relays basking peoples prettiness.  For me, the game is about Adventure, mystery, and super ex2+ mega hypercannon coolness.  But to be honest(not trying to get sad) but I play the game as a means of keeping myself occupied. Long story short. Chronic pain in my back and leg. Not allowed to work.  It keeps me occupied and my mind off shit.  Other then that, I keep playing because I like the community. I'm not one to talk to people in games, or help others, or ask for help, every MMO, or games with MMO elements, I solo everything I can.  Not in Warframe.  For what ever reason, I feel like Warframe sucks in my soul and sadness, and replaces it with smiles and pretty color customization.  I've been playing for 17ish months, but have taken breaks, one was 4 months when I didn't have a PC. Another time was 2 weeks, and another was 9 days.  For me, Raids suck, I don't like them in any game, it's never ""fun"" it's people bitching cause someone doesn't know x, or isn't as quick, and I just never got into the mindset of ""Oh wow, Raids/Instances they rock""  For me, it's the lone journey down the Space Cowboy Highway! I also am a little odd, I have said it before on here but I  sometimes put ""limits"" on my playstyle.  No multiplayer until I do def alone 3 times to ""free"" my ""potential party""  or no using my 5 forma'd soma and other end game items, until I do T4Surv alone with a braton only for 30+ mins.  I don't know why, but I just feel connected to the game, community and like I have a place.  Maybe it's cause I never got picked for dodge ball haha.  I am sure my reasons won't help you in your quest for a reason why you lost your love."

Run a t4 survival and stay out of the sewer, maybe don't bring your best/favorite loadout. Make the game hard and don't be afraid to fail once in a while.  I try new things once in a while. I've got every frame so every now and then I dust off one I haven't played in a while and try a new tactic. Maybe run Banshee and only use her first ability.  I help out noobs. Run a couple missions with someone asking for help in recruiting. I offer the knowledge I have and often a couple essential mods if I have duplicates lying around."

I normally get my fix from Monster Hunter, but my copy of 4U was recently stolen, so not only can I not play that anymore, but I lost 100+ hours, which hurts and sucks.  So, while I wait for MHX, I've got Warframe to play with. I played a bit before, and I wasn't very good, but I started watching videos from DKDiamantes and QuietteShy and I started to pick up on some things. Now I'm going with builds and doing cool stuff while I wait for updates to make it all meaningless.   I live for big accomplishments, which for me is having any Forma at all ever. My Clan has two active players including me, and the Dojo ain't gonna build itself. My buddy and I just took on Lephantis without any other people. I'm excited to keep going with this kind of stuff.

Other than that that's the way you max her damage output if you're not working with a VERY close (I mean like everyone is working together on Skype/Teamspeak/Mumble etc) squad to make sure you can keep up with energy. If you have that, you can use a max Blind Rage but otherwise 27% is more than enough for most scenarios.   Also I'm too poor to max Primed Flow (Seriously I have no credits considering I have 2k hours) but obviously if you can max it, do it."
Warframe,3e07ef,fortris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:10:19 2015 UTC,I have a similar build except I switch out the Redirection for Narrow Minded. Since the -range doesn't affect Peacemaker all you get is longer duration which is amazing for the Shatter Shield(~25 seconds). It has saved me many times.
Warframe,3e07ef,Alorpax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:42:57 2015 UTC,"Actually fuck I should have thought of this, my main Mesa build is entirely Shatter Shield (seriously 95% damage reduction is RIDICULOUS and it lasts like 90 seconds).  Ty editing it now."
Warframe,3e07ef,fortris,2,Tue Jul 21 01:03:34 2015 UTC,"I'm currently at maxed efficiency with stream line and fleeting expertise.   Remember, that Efficiency caps at 75%   is it worth getting some power strength with transient fortitude   Transient Fortitude is -duration. Peacemaker is not effected by Duration. Go for it.  Blind Rage is also good, when you have Fleeting Expertise + Streamline. Max it just enough to still hit the efficiency cap.  Which weapons work with Mesa? Any and all. She even gets some bonuses for secondaries.  Oh, one thing worth noting is that she has health bonus for not equipping a melee weapon."

Warframe,3e07ef,SpookySkeletons,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:46:44 2015 UTC,Make sure you don't gimp your duration too much. Shatter shield is great and complements Peacemaker since you are stationary ->easy target.  If you want to kill stuff in non endless mission or up to 20min/wave/4rounds +30% strength is enough and also bums Shatter Shield to 95% damage reduction.
Warframe,3e07ef,AvenV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:02:12 2015 UTC,"This is my build.  It allows me to have a long duration Shatter Shield (40 seconds), while dealing enough damage with my peacemaker.  If you want more damage, just swap Primed Continuity for Blind Rage."
Warframe,3e07ef,goron24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:24 2015 UTC,Max power strength and efficiency. at higher tier missions you will NEED duration as well but that's not hard to build for since her ult doesn't need range mods  Edit: Her name is also Mesa not Messa

If Nyx's Mind Control would alter the behaviour of the controlled enemy to always stick close to Nyx, or even allow her to interact with it like a syndicate ally(Follow/Hold Position) I could see Ancient healers being somewhat useful for Defense missions.

Over time, they work their way away from where you left them, and to get them back you have to run the risk of telling them to follow again (with their crappy path-finding), and hope that they don't Leroy Jenkins off into a group of enemies.  What Specters need, is a defensive/offensive setting that you can use to make them protect you/the objective/where you tell them to stay, or so they can run around like idiots and die in 5 seconds like they do now.  I used an Ancient Healer specter the other day in a low level corpus defense to help protect my low-level squad mate (he had an unranked Mag and didn't have a decently modded Vitality/Redirection mod), and the healing aura for starters is pitiful (I know that they scale with level, but this was healing like 40-50 HP per 30s. Wasn't even enough to heal his Mag for half health), the fact that I told it to stay at the power core thingy and it didn't, and the fact that it died within 2 waves to simple crewmen makes me not see the point in using them for anything anymore."

Warframe,3dy68p,ArchMihalis,8,Mon Jul 20 14:27:02 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion :  Primed Reach is great, but only on weapons that already have a decent base range such as spears, staves and the Gallatine. The Drakana has an average range to being with so Primed Reach is a waste of a slot.  Spoiled strike is imho never worth it, I'd add another element instead.  Rending Strike doesn't give enough slash damage to warrant a slot.  Well anyway here's how I build it, I never feel like it's lacking damage. Switch elementals accordingly to your enemies.  I could further increase its damage by removing life strike and energy channel but I kinda like having them to avoid wasting large health restores."
Warframe,3dy68p,Nakkielz,3,Mon Jul 20 15:06:15 2015 UTC,Primed Reach is also great on stealth missions with Loki/Ash so you can whack bois without going into the long assassination animation.

Warframe,3dy68p,narcalepticinsomniac,2,Tue Jul 21 11:01:21 2015 UTC,"I run a couple of builds: one pure elemental (viral and radiation IIRC) damage with spoiled, pressure, fury and life strike. The other is a pure slash with buzz kill and jagged with just viral in combination with those other mods listed above. Tranquil cleave is my favorite stance followed by blind justice."
Warframe,3dy68p,lightningleaf,3,Mon Jul 20 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"You can Google all the builds you want, so here's some general tips:  Why jagged edge? Consider the following. Slash has +25% bonus at most (with the exception of some light Infested), so even if the dnikana were pure slash, that'd be 190% * 125% = 237.5% damage in the best case. Whereas if you added a 60 elemental/status mod which had a 75% bonus, that'd be 160% * 175% = 280% damage (it's a bit more complicated with the need for other other elementals but the core idea is there).   So that naturally leads to my second question - why is Rending Strike there? It's apparently less of a pure damage gain - I don't know if   you want more puncture, but puncture on the dnikana is negligible.  To wrap it up, I suggest you try out Berserker instead of Fury, as the dnikana has a fairly good crit chance. True Steel may be helpful in that regard."
Warframe,3dy68p,DeathOnion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:02:31 2015 UTC,"I use fury and berserker, it procs enough without true steel"
Warframe,3dy68p,lightningleaf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:40:34 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't go for so much speed, it's an either/or situation for me.  Fury for totally non-crit weapons, especially for non-crit slow weapons.  Berserker definitely for 25%+ crit weapons, and if you often equip melee.  Neither for pure damage. (edit)"
Warframe,3dy68p,DeathOnion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:44:50 2015 UTC,"I often equip melee, which explains that. Fury basically increases your dps by 30%, so after you add 3/4 elemental mods it's a better source of damage."

Warframe,3dy301,Sancticus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:03:48 2015 UTC,Second question - is there any means of getting carrier prime outside of one of the packs?
Warframe,3dy301,SpookySkeletons,16,Mon Jul 20 14:11:18 2015 UTC,Yes it drops in the Void just as Ash and Vectis Prime.  Or you can buy the parts from players for a much lower price.  Prime Access is more about supporting the game then getting stuff.
Warframe,3dy301,Trumbles,2,Mon Jul 20 14:12:59 2015 UTC,"Of course, any prime items in the access packs also have their parts added to the void drop tables.

Warframe,3dy301,Shwrecked,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:25 2015 UTC,I wonder why the prime access info doesn't say you get an extra extractor spot. I went a month without using the extra spot :S
Warframe,3dy301,whatevers_clever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:05 2015 UTC,"the main point of the prime access is for discounted platinum with the new items thrown in.  You can hunt down Carrier prime parts, buy them, or wait a couple weeks until they are more common and hunt em down."
Warframe,3dy301,Windoftime,5,Mon Jul 20 20:44:58 2015 UTC,"Tbh the only part of prime access i ever buy is the accessories, because it is the only part of the package that cannot be farmed.

Warframe,3dy301,SpookySkeletons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:21 2015 UTC,You get the package that you paid for. BUT you are also considered a prime supporter thus get the benefits (you can deploy an extra extractor and I think something else too not sure).
Warframe,3dy301,Foxboy93,4,Mon Jul 20 14:03:50 2015 UTC,Well there is all that discounted plat for starters!
Warframe,3dy301,SpookySkeletons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:04:21 2015 UTC,"Not really.  The Prime sutff is all farmable so you are paying for the convenience of getting the items (+slots+potatoes) but if you don't count that the plat isn't discounted. You are much better off if you wait for a 75% booster, with 50$ you can buy 4300 plat (about the same you get with highest rank prime access).   The only thing that really sweetens the deal are the prime accessories, but IMO 90 day boosters aren't worth it if you have a job since most of your playtime will be concentrated on your off days. 90 days -> 3 months -> 12 weekends  12 weekends with both boosters cost 80/we -> 960 plat.  (plus the prime bling you get)"
Warframe,3dy301,Foxboy93,6,Mon Jul 20 14:11:45 2015 UTC,In which case it's probably a better deal for the consoles as plat discounts are unabailable
Warframe,3dy301,Nearokins,2,Mon Jul 20 14:30:10 2015 UTC,"Well, it's as good as 50% deal is. And honestly, waiting on 75% is poop.   I've played warframe over 1700 hours so far, consistently logging in even on days I don't play. Still never seen a 75% discount. It's not horrible to wait for it, but it's honestly not something you should ever expect to actually get.   Might get lucky, might not."
Warframe,3dy301,PM_ME_SweetNothings,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:57 2015 UTC,"logging in everyday is exactly how you dont get it.

If this was an orokin drop table, which one would you farm?"
Warframe,3dy301,Nearokins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know about the drop tables. Though, that's under the assumption that percentages are even or at least the same between the two, which honestly isn't known.   Comparing to the void, where lots of parts have 5% drop rates, and others have 25% drop rates, honestly I'm not sure I would pick the thing less loaded with parts.  Still, I wouldn't doubt that the 75%s are more likely for no login streak, for the players who don't already regularly play and are less likely to put out cash otherwise. Honestly though, I doubt I'd have gotten one either way, going every other day, or having permanent 7+ streaks with a few resets."
Warframe,3dy301,PM_ME_SweetNothings,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:28:36 2015 UTC,"True, i regularly reset my streak and i've gotten about a dozen 50% off but no 75%"

There are definitely some Prime Accesses that aren't worth buying the full package for (Volt Prime comes to mind), but the accessories are up to the individual. For less than what a lot of people spend on fireworks on July 4th, you get a kick-a exclusive cosmetic that stays on your account forever.

They have Deal With It/dead-horse-beating gifs at the ready, and brigade threads to derail them with bad behaviour so as to get those threads closed ASAP.    Their tears are delicious."
Warframe,3dx2zr,Kiyanavasala,5,Mon Jul 20 11:33:02 2015 UTC,"Wait, Founders bitched about Excal prime?. Why?"
Warframe,3dx2zr,lerobotsexy,6,Mon Jul 20 13:35:03 2015 UTC,"The Chinese Warframe that doesn't connect to any other version is getting its own Founder pack, with its own Excalibur Prime.    And the children are screaming."

Warframe,3dx2zr,Crackseed,13,Mon Jul 20 13:42:10 2015 UTC,Noone forced them to pay for the Founders. It was their decision and it was a decision that they've made in the past. ~~I'd pay the Grandmaster founder money to DE instead of Disciple had i see this version but you dont see me crying about that.  Seriously though. DE needs to handle these situations without angering the masses. I can see how this goes. Im calling it. Their Frost and Ember will be 10 times better then ours. When that happens amount of Sodium will suffocate a lot of tenno's.~~  Edit: Aw yiss. Im already getting downvoted. That means someone is salty. Stay salty m8's
Warframe,3dx2zr,Kiyanavasala,8,Mon Jul 20 13:50:45 2015 UTC,I'm a founder and I agree with the sentiment. I bought the pack (Hunter that I upgraded to Master) to support DE. The goodies were nice and I'm very happy I have them but this in no way makes me better than any payer who came after.   Some of the attitudes are downright horrible and it's shameful to see grown adults act like this.
Warframe,3dx2zr,BowsOhNo,2,Mon Jul 20 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"See, I'd like to have the Mastery from unobtainable items removed.

Warframe,3dx2zr,Kiyanavasala,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"DE said something about the game only being considered complete once you can get rank 30 without any exclusive gear, so yeah. That'll come eventually, maybe in 5 years."

I mean, we're not even halfway there and we've had a ton of items not getting reused in a permanent form, and six others getting Primed Vaulted with no idea of how often that'll open up."
Warframe,3dx2zr,Kiyanavasala,3,Mon Jul 20 18:21:55 2015 UTC,exclusives are always a shit decision. tho the chinese version seems to be entirely out of DE's hands anyway. we'll see how the ways run apart even further soon.

Warframe,3dx2zr,LoadingGod,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:50:27 2015 UTC,"Not for not having Excalibur Prime, but for asking about it. If they read it as them asking for EP, the gifs come out to play.    Unfortunately, I can't provide proof at the moment, as the moderators lock those threads (and presumably either delete them or let/make them disappear) as soon as they see them these days, usually saying that it's invariably going to become toxic if left to continue (if it hasn't already).    I'd say you should make a topic on the forums (maybe on a throwaway account?) to see for yourself, but right now any discussion of EP would probably get moved into the China megathread.    I can't prove it, but I did once make a thread asking a hypothetical question about what Founders would consider fair trades (such as some kind of super-forma blueprint, etc) in exchange for their weapons and frame becoming available to everyone.    Some people said they wouldn't accept anything, or gave obviously-ludicrous answers like a billion Plat. That was fine. Others derailed the topic with those gifs I mentioned and screaming that they'd sue, which is where I got the impression of a brigade. It might just be confirmation bias, but I can't remember ever seeing anywhere near as many Master or above Founders in one topic."
Warframe,3dx2zr,incendiarypoop,-5,Mon Jul 20 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"That's because the same argument gets used every single time. ""We console players never had the chance"" Well tough luck you don't always get what you want. When a game gets released the players can't go and complain about alpha or beta rewards so why should they about the founder rewards."
Warframe,3dx2zr,LoadingGod,2,Mon Jul 20 12:40:27 2015 UTC,"As a very early founder myself, someone who hopes they never ever bring in a new way to get Excal Prime, and someone who thought the founding window was left open for so long as to severely damage its exclusivity, even I have to agree with the console players too on this matter, though.  Giving them founders benefits for the launch period of the console would have been fair and reasonable, and would not have damaged the value of our own founder investments, as they are an entirely different player pool."
Warframe,3dx2zr,Kiyanavasala,0,Mon Jul 20 14:09:53 2015 UTC,"But that would've upset the PC players since the game didn't have to be ""founded"" anymore, so they would want it as well since if they could do it for the console players why not for the pc players."
Warframe,3dx2zr,lerobotsexy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:23 2015 UTC,"Not every time. I asked for exclusives and removed items to be made into skins to balance out Mastery for if it gets made more meaningful in the future, but still that was apparently too much to ask.    ""I paid for that Mastery advantage!"" was used as a serious counter-argument."
Warframe,3dx2zr,xAznFox,0,Mon Jul 20 14:00:06 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between an exclusive weapon and an exclusive Warframe. That Lato Vandal I got for playing in the beta is barely worth using in PvE, but Excal Prime is pretty damn useful in the Void."

So if DE releases 'exclusive' items for the international release, China can just go ahead an release the same stuff.  That's kind of the point of the outrage for Excalibur Prime and the founders pack. DE legally cannot re-release Excalibur Prime in any form in the international release because they are prevented from doing so based on the purchases of the founders. If they were to ever release an Excalibur Prime, then they would be in breach of contract and any Founder could sue DE.  China isn't under the same contract because China's game isn't the international release. DE can't stop China from recreating anything DE releases for it's players.  China will be able to have exclusive content, and there's not much we can do about it."

Warframe,3duqur,Kyotra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:00:12 2015 UTC,"They aren't really Communist though, never have been, they were Maoist at the start (and wasn't that a freaking disaster) and changed over time, now they are mixed hybrid, like most nations, including America (mixed socialist/capitalist system).  Their system being biased has a lot more to do with Chinese culture than any economic ideology. I mean if you go back to the 19th century you hear about how the Chinese Emperor was told about 'receiving tribute from the Barbarian Queen Victoria', never mind she was the head of the largest empire ever seen on Earth.  It's just their culture, they are very insular and believe in their superiority, it's just they've got the weight to throw around now."

Warframe,3duqur,Throrface,-1,Mon Jul 20 10:34:34 2015 UTC,Yes you do. IANAL but to my understanding it's a sort of a Mexican Standoff. If they use fan art then the artist can sue for using it without the artist's permission. But the company can then go and counter sue for infringing on their IP.  There has been specific IPs with strong fan followings that do huge amounts of art for it using characters both established in the IP as well as just original characters that are being put in the world of the IP. The creators have shown to love their fans and like putting in nods to the fan works but has been specifically told by the lawyers not to use anything directly fan related for that reason.

Chinese ports of western MMO's have largely been very egregious with things like this.  So long as we get the Nikana Prime, that new Prime throwing weapon, and maybe see the Dark Prime Excal skin going onto the Excal Primes of Founders as an option, I see no problem.  the moment any of the above does not happen, pitchforks and torches are at the store down the street, cant miss it."
Warframe,3duqur,KazumaKat,2,Sun Jul 19 21:10:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if we get these things that are meant to be super exclusive stuff for the Chinese players, then they would probably be quite mad also.   That would totally depend on how they give these items to us, if we get them at all."

Warframe,3duqur,blolfighter,12,Sun Jul 19 23:50:34 2015 UTC,"Mirage laughed before she died.  Valkyr is constantly on edge, never feeling safe.  Ember is impatient, but relaxed.  Limbo is a showoff, and loves to hog the spotlight.  A lot of frames / Tenno have personality, and they're certainly not dispassionate. They may show no remorse for their killings and genocide, but they are not without feelings."
Warframe,3duqur,FrizzyThePastafarian,8,Mon Jul 20 01:09:25 2015 UTC,I dunno. The Idle animations point to a lot of personality than you'd first suspect. Loki is definitely fitting the 'playful trickster' type given how he handles throwing knives while Mirage and Limbo both definitely seem like those who enjoy the spotlight. Ember has some sass to her and Oberon is actually pretty chill given how his motions are much 'softer' and less aggressive than most other frames. Valkyr is always wary as you'll see her look around more sharply than other frames as well.   They're all very composed when doing their thing but I can't say they're emotionless.
Warframe,3duqur,Terumitsu,3,Mon Jul 20 01:09:38 2015 UTC,"Its amazing how easy it is to hide your emotions if nobody can see your face.

Warframe,3duqur,blolfighter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:12:58 2015 UTC,"Depends, there was explicit text in the game circa U8 where the lotus sent out a victory email saying precisely what I just said. It was never used in-game but then we got the Stalker codex which matches it.  Also we have word of God that the Tenno are the ""good guys"" so a power grab by the lotus is virtually impossible in the spirit of the setting."
Warframe,3duqur,SilentMobius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:32:03 2015 UTC,"If the Lotus actually betrayed the Orokin and seized power, then the Lotus is a betrayer and what she says isn't to be trusted. She could just be lying about it.  The Stalker entry does show (and perhaps prove - do we trust the Stalker?) that the Tenno performed the actual act, the decapitation strike. But I find it implausible that the Lotus didn't sanction the act. There is no schism between Tenno and Lotus.  The question, then, is whether the Lotus acted out of ambition or concern, and there is ample indication in lore entries that the Orokin leaders were not Nice People. Did the Lotus topple an oppressive regime, or tear mankind's greatest civilization from its pinnacle? I think it's the former, but we don't know for sure."
Warframe,3duqur,blolfighter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:59:13 2015 UTC,"For sure? No  But then we have a default assumption based on what is provided to us.

Word-of-god says that the Tenno are ""The good guys"" By association it would be difficult for the lotus to be a ""bad guy"" while directing the Tenno is a way that is objectively good DE have said that no syndicate will replace the lotus Lotus has been likened to the Tenno's ""Space Mom"" Unused game data details a believable reason for the lotus advocating the Orokin pogrom.

Warframe,3duqur,Enamex,41,Mon Jul 20 06:16:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as great as that Dark Excalibur Prime looks, I think I can do without it.    What irritates me more is that most, if not all, the artwork I've seen used to promote WF China is fanart ripped from the web, and in no way close to representing what the game looks like. The Rhino and Saryn pictures make the game look like some kind of open world MMO a la TERA, to which Warframe is clearly not.  The Crying Nova picture has absolutely nothing to do with WF seeing as Tenno don't even show any remorse in what they do.    The nearly-unmasked mag and exposed skin shot are big red flags to me, as the identity of what the Tenno are have always been a big part of player identity, as well as a lore mystery that DE devs aren't prepared to reveal yet, either because they want to hold the suspense, or because they themselves haven't decided what they want the Tenno to be.    ADDENDUM:    What's going to happen when all the artists in this community see that there's a possibility of their art being stolen? Is it possible that such an outcome might discourage artistic activity within the community? Would artists become more cautious about watermarking and releasing their artwork?    And what happens when Chinese players log into WF China and see that the game is nothing like the pictures shown here? Are they going to call for drastic changes to the game so that it might better represent the currently unrepresentative promotional art? How is that going to affect the international version, our version?"
Warframe,3duqur,Unimpressions,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:27:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, for me, I don't really care if they are misinforming their own players as much as I do about the new gear. And who says it's even misinforming to the extent we assume - Chinese WF is independent from International WF after all. I'm pretty sure they could have lore differences if they wanted.  What I do care about is if the International Development team (Mynki, Steve, those pictured in the photos) spent their time designing this new Excalibur Prime only for China to have it and nobody else.   I'm fine if a Chinese team designed it. I'm fine that the Chinese have their own founders packs. I'm not fine if our Dev team designed something this badass just for one country."

The concept of ""copyright"" means little in China, as over there, imitation means competition, which means a stronger market for them.   They are far more market-oriented vs copyright/IP protective over there, and since the source pictures come from some western art website on the internet and not someone else in China, they see little point in not taking what they can to market what they can as best they can."

You have the endgame rare stuff there. Unless you're a mastercard that wants to just blast throught the game, no challenge, no fun. Then I can probably understand you wanting these builds.   Leveling Items   Draco on Ceres is the best place.   getting Orokin Cells,   Sargas Ruk. Look him up on Wiki. Also low-tier endless Void missions have a chance to drop them.   getting Forma   Fucking everywhere in the Void. Want Loki Prime Systems? Nope, have some Forma. Need Vectis Prime Barrel? Nope, Forma it is.  Just go to the Void, you'll be swimming in this shit.   Orokin Catalysts, Orokin reactors,   You must be really new to not know how to farm those.  Short answer: you can't.  Long answer: they are a rare alert and invasion rewards, also every fortnight, after a devstream, there's a 24h alert for one of these.  Or you can buy it on the market, 20p per one.   and Neural sesnors   Alad V or ODD on Jupiter, with Pilfdroid and Nekros.   Last thing is which makes more money Vault Runs or doing high tier void missions   If you mean credits, Sechura on Ceres is your go-to place. Take Mesa, Speed Nova, and maybe Vauban or Trinity.   if im looking to make plat which should i focus on?   Farm rare stuff, sell it. Nightmare and Corrupted mods are probably the easiest to get, some of them sell good, some of them for like 3-5p, but they're easy to get.  Or go for rare Prime parts. You'll be ripping your hair out of your head from the frustration, but it may be worth it.   before people say use google I want to say I dont like using google   Usw Wiki then.

Warframe,3e0bn7,NirvashSFW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:57:33 2015 UTC,I always think a good place to start is capitalizing on a weapon/frames default strengths.   I was working on a soma build last night. I was going for major crit damage but I always enhance a weapons main damage type first. I can't remember right now but I think the soma deals puncture damage the most. So I put a puncture mod on there and then went for crit mods.  The best thing about Warframes mod system is you can make builds that suit your play style. If you like flying through missions as fast as possible while causing insane damage save mod space by not using vitality or redirection. On the other hand if you like diving into a pack of lancers build those two mods up and got to town.  I've been away from Warframes for six months or so but survival missions still seem to be the best for farming and leveling. I don't really know of any specific nodes but I came from a time when xini was all anybody played because it handed out credits and fusions cores like they were candy. I think that has since been dealt with by DE though.   As far as credits go I don't do many vault runs but higher tier tower missions give quite a lot of credits. Like in the 20000's.

Mesa, Trinity, Limbo, Frost), but it is fast exp if you want to grind multiple forma quickly  If you don't have any of the popular Draco frames, you can do void defenses like T1D/T2D instead   Orokin Catalysts, Orokin reactors   If you need 3x reactors for: Nova P, Valkyr, Ash P, plus 4x catalysts for: Boltor P, Latron P, Orthos P, Vaykor Marelok immediately, I suggest you acquire plat and purchase them from the marketplace.

Warframe,3dz4im,CleanRandal,2,Mon Jul 20 20:02:49 2015 UTC,"No worries, I was just making the connection lol, but I do agree that it is kind of frustrating to see people get better items just because they logged in at a certain time. There is something to be said for more time = better frames etc. But it shouldn't necessarily be unobtainable to others. The worst right now I think is the relatively few people who have Primed Chamber thinking things should be balanced around that mod haha."
Warframe,3dz4im,BraveDude8_1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:49:16 2015 UTC,"That's the thing - I really don't want to cheapen anyone's previous achievements or investments. That's not my goal.   It is, unfortunately, part of what would have to happen to some degree, but it's not what I want out of this, and it makes this whole discussion a little.. interesting.  Well, nothing worth doing is ever easy, or something."
Warframe,3dz4im,KingMe42,2,Mon Jul 20 21:46:38 2015 UTC,"With Primed Chamber as an example they said they'd rerelease it as an event mod of sorts, no luck yet. Cosmetics should be the only thing that never become unlocked. I disagree with having unobtainable stat upgrades, Excal would be an exception IMO as it seems fair that the deal was founders.  They should leave the bragging rights stuff and achievements as cosmetics - Make them even more amazing, upgraded prime skins or upgraded weapon skins etc. but I agree with you on permanently locked stat upgrades, frustrating."
Warframe,3dz4im,BraveDude8_1,5,Mon Jul 20 21:51:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going to throw in my old suggestion alongside this; when you give out special weapon versions in events, make it a seperate item but buff the normal version to the same stats as the intended special versions stats.  Special version keeps the unique appearance and name, normal version keeps the viability. No need for more MK1-like useless weapons superceded by direct ugprades. Problem solved."
Warframe,3dz4im,KingMe42,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"Umm please no? If I'm going to get a special item, it better be special and different in some way.

Warframe,3dz4im,BraveDude8_1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:40 2015 UTC,"It is different. It's got a unique appearance. As someone who owns literally every exclusive weapon bar the Lato Prime, having limited time weapons be drastically better than their counterparts is poor design."
Warframe,3dz4im,Colony_games_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:22:05 2015 UTC,"It's not poor design, it rewards players who keep up with the game with enjoyable weapons to use. You think anyone would use any of the Wraith or Vandal versions if all they were were just skins? No, since you can't even color them. I want increased stats, I want different versions of the same weapon so I can use which one I prefer."
Warframe,3dz4im,Kiyanavasala,0,Tue Jul 21 18:23:08 2015 UTC,"This really does seem like a cool solution, at least for some of the items. It's also a two-for-one, letting you retouch old weapons that are getting ""power creep'd"" out of viability.  You run into an issue with Prime versions though, I think, because there's always a group of people who really don't care about appearances and just want stats (So if they don't get better stats, they won't want to pay or play for it)"
Warframe,3dz4im,lightningleaf,2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, didn't mean to include Primes in that. Just Vandal/Wraith etc. Only applying to exclusives which would now become purely cosmetic."

Personally, I'd prefer to limit the power creep as much as possible.   This is conflating two issues, but I really don't think it's healthy to excuse power creep just because it's limited access. I think it is actually worse. Were these weapons accessible permanently, the alternate versions could more easily be involved in balance considerations.  To be clear, I'm not for power creep either. I'd like as many things to be viable as possible, but this isn't what this thread is about.   The difference between League and Warframe is the whole genre - (competitive) League is PVP, Warframe is PVE.    League is PvE like Warframe is PvP - there are sizable subsets of the playerbase that do each, even though the other group is the primary one. You can't just ignore Warframe PvP because the player count is low. That said, I'm not relying on PvP balance as an argument here, I truly believe in what I'm saying for PvE stuff, too.   Edit: Another post suggests that items may count as their base versions for conclave? If so, that's an elegant solution to PvP but doesn't change my opinion.   players in the later time can't access slightly gameplay changing equipment. [...] everyone having access to the same content is not necessary.   It comes down to me simply believing that everyone should be able to be on an even playing field.

Warframe,3dz4im,lightningleaf,2,Mon Jul 20 19:11:51 2015 UTC,"the alternate versions could more easily be involved in balance considerations.   as of how they are now, they are negligible in balance considerations. If a non-exclusive weapon should get rebalanced, then naturally its exclusive counterpart should as well.   League is PvE like Warframe is PvP - there are sizable subsets of the playerbase that do each, even though the other group is the primary one. You can't just ignore Warframe PvP because the player count is low.   Except PvE wasn't shoehorned into League with arbitrary balance decisions.   But whether or not PvP in Warframe is meaningful is beside my point. In PvE co-op there's no need for players to have an edge of <10% damage or some random utility. Whereas in PvP such would be considered apparently unbalanced. DE balances PvP separately, and this should not influence PvE at all.   It comes down to me simply believing that everyone should be able to be on an even playing field.   Seriously? This is a co-op game. You cooperate with other players in order to achieve the end goal. There is no reason to act like you're being shafted.   While I can't understand your opposite belief here   Exclusive items should stay exclusive for the people who were able to get the items at the time of release. By begging for an Excalibur Prime re-release - or anything else to a lesser extent - you spit in the face of the playerbase that made Warframe into what it is today - a great game with an overprivileged vocal minority. I don't know and I don't really care what Warframe China gets - it should not change how things have been operating on the western side of things. That is what I believe."

How is wanting to be able to experience all the gameplay Warframe has to offer ""aiming for a middle ground to benefit yourself""?  Personally, I don't care at all about Excalibur Prime, my argument there is entirely on principle. I also can appreciate there are nuances there regarding the exact wording used in advertising.   Primed mods (Some of them), primed weapons, and prisma/vandal versions of weapons are my main issue, and so my intent behind the OP and other responses in this thread are applying primarily to them.  Some of those things can have a major impact (Some don't) in builds, much like uniques in Path of Exile (Which are universally available, even though they are paid creations of players)   Edit: I should explain that.

Warframe,3dvmjd,Volcanicrage,3,Mon Jul 20 00:29:52 2015 UTC,"This isn't really too far is seeing as the Orokin scientists all had a different project to work on, as shown by the Crewman simaris entry."

Warframe,3dvmjd,Volcanicrage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:56:43 2015 UTC,Did not know that. That is actually really interesting because the only reason they exist is because of the insensitivity to pain. Maybe a genetic trait that developed in order for survival?
Warframe,3dvmjd,64Demon,10,Sun Jul 19 23:41:11 2015 UTC,"I thought they existed because the Orokin started experimenting on a bunch of kids that got sucked into the Void and came out with superpowers/mutations/something similar.  Then again, the lore on the Tenno is incredibly obfuscated."
Warframe,3dvmjd,Volcanicrage,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:46:04 2015 UTC,Thought in Excal's lore they discuss the origins of the Tenno being Hayden (Well what we assume to be Hayden) and that his insensitivity to pain caused the Technocyte virus not to drive him mad like everyone else.

Warframe,3dvmjd,BarlesCzarkley,3,Mon Jul 20 04:42:11 2015 UTC,"Well after reading the little lore that came with Rhino/Excal/Ember Prime to me it seems that there were test subjects that were sent to the void that were grafted/infused/injected with DNA from Hayden Tenno/descendant that under duress changed their nature, well the ones that survived(Why else are they called Tenno if they dont have his gene). Gifting them abilities but with residual mental scars. That Warframes were created around them to fully enhance them. But clones were created from them as I don't think a handful of Prime Tenno took out the bad guys in the Old War. And its the main reason I think the Grineer are interested in the Orikin as their cloning tech is way superior than theirs. As for different warframes we play with , we are just playing multiple characters/tenno with their own unique persona's otherwise they would have the same stance and idle animations. Well that's my take. I read through lore entries a couple of times now, check the wiki. Embers entry is quite interesting cause I think she stoway on test subject ship into the void."

Our switching between Warframes - and Vor's comment that ""each Warframe you control is a glass shaping your divine light"" - pretty much points out that it's the Warframes that alter the powers, so why go through the trouble of having a body in there?  I think we're what would basically amount to a Soul - calling us ""energy beings"" implies we have matter to our conciousness that could manifest itself on its own, which while we channel Void energy ourselves I don't believe to be the case - that simply inhabits the living suit that is the Warframe."
Warframe,3dvmjd,waddayakno,2,Mon Jul 20 00:33:02 2015 UTC,"Our Tenno could be descendants of the first from that ship, so we in a sense have all their powers but need to have a warframe to focus and magnify that energy into something more manageable than just being ok at most of what the original Tenno could do. So your player character is like a great-great-great grandchild of the originals. I'm saying that because I'm assuming the war against the Sentients and the development and refinement of the Tenno/Warframe creation technique required some time."
Warframe,3dvmjd,MrDar1o,2,Mon Jul 20 05:07:32 2015 UTC,"That's a possibility, but the way my mind's wired that's one of those things that needs something to suggest it happened before I'll be able to really see it happening. It doesn't help that, imo, Tenno can't reproduce, but I'm open to a whole slew of ideas as long as we can finally understand what's what."
Warframe,3dvmjd,Morec0,2,Mon Jul 20 12:06:56 2015 UTC,"There is no conclusive evidence either way, but Steve said at the beginning of this year that the mystery of what Tenno are will be revealed this year. Whether we'll get to know remains to be seen, but as long as the jury is still out there I tend to form my opinion based on Occam's Razor, which IMO simply says that the body inside the warframe including personality, and the ""spirit energy"" possessing/guiding/controlling them, are two different things. Whether the in-universe convention of addressing active Warframes as Tenno is defined by the assumption of others that only possessed frames are technically alive I wouldn't want to answer yet, tho."
Warframe,3dvmjd,CidImmacula,2,Mon Jul 20 07:00:18 2015 UTC,IMO changeing warframes of different gender isn't part of Lore. I think it's just game mechanics. The same with building frames. Not everything need explanation in Lore. But it's just my opinion.  I guess even DE don't know who Tenno are.

Warframe,3du3jh,Unimpressions,20,Sun Jul 19 14:28:19 2015 UTC,What would they fix it to? Polarized slots cut the cost by half. They can't let it round down because they you could get a stronger mod in at slightly less the cost.

When going up from an odd drain to an even, the drain value when polarized stays the same, which means the notification is wrong and the mod will fit. I'd like to see a fix that prevents the notification from popping up when that is the case.  It's just a little QoL update I'd like to see to make ranking up slotted mods a tiny bit less tedious.

What if Warframe's got 10 mod capacity per level instead of 1 (as per usual with reactors double this to 20 instead of 2) and mod costs were also multiplied by 10. Suddenly we can have 14 energy mods costing 140 still fitting into the game as per normal, being halved to 70, but 13 energy mods costing 130 could be halved to 65 energy.  This is probably a lot of work though just to allow players to equip odd numbered mods into polarities without being ""punished"" though, I think the Dev team has probably got higher priorities."
Warframe,3du3jh,Cadogan102,2,Sun Jul 19 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"Why 10x instead of just 2x though? Or just simply allowing matching polarities to include .5s, even if the numbers were bigger it's not like you'd stop having odd numbers. Doing .5s probably wouldn't be hard if DE wanted to.   Perhaps not worth the effort of implementing though, debatable. It would be nice if uneven numbers weren't such a pain, especially given all elementals are an uneven number."
Warframe,3du3jh,Nearokins,3,Sun Jul 19 19:27:17 2015 UTC,"Well if they've built that shit on INTs instead of floats, they'd have to screw around with their variables to be able to hold those .5s. As is it's just taking the INT, cutting it in half, rounding up, and saving it as an INT again. I mean at least that would be my assumption."
Warframe,3du3jh,Riaayo,0,Sun Jul 19 19:41:08 2015 UTC,I have to say I agree that u shouldn't have to have 8 polarized slots.  Even most maxed weapon or frames usually have 1 or 2 slots left that aren't polarized.

Warframe,3du3jh,zhandragon,3,Sun Jul 19 14:55:45 2015 UTC,The annoying thing for me is that you're locked into one particular build. The dash polarity on animal instinct makes it impossible to have a build that allows you to swap it out for another maxed mod if you choose. No warframe or sentinel limits your flexibility like this because they don't require every slot to be polarized for their 'standard' maxed builds.
Warframe,3du3jh,PillarOfIce,5,Sun Jul 19 20:02:56 2015 UTC,"Odd-ranked mods have their cost rounded up when slotted into a matching polarity slot. If you ranked them up they would in fact cost the same in the build, so you can max them all and fit them in."

Warframe,3du3jh,FalseCape,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"Not like this is any different from primaries/secondaries. I've been putting 7 formas on all of my secondaries since primed heated charge and I'd have to put 8 if magnum force wasn't a piece of shit or when I feel like using seeker (which is pretty often because seeker rocks). Even my Primaries usually require 7 forma. Melee just spoils us with plenty of mods 11 points and under and with the benefit of the stance slot giving them a free 10 points which is 20 with polarity slots, so at most for them you need 1 V 2 -. The problem isn't kubrow mods in general, it's that DE has been applying feature creep to the dated mod system. First it was forma which created the meta of almost always slotting the highest cost mods for maximum space efficiency, why slot a 7 point card when you can slot a 16 point one? Before the introduction of forma, even with a potato chances were you wouldn't be using all of your mod slots which gave you flexibility. You could chose to use 2 lower powered mods for the same point cost as a single more powerful mod. Back then the ratio of mod points to slots was 60 over 8 which is about 7.5 mod points per slot. Plenty of flexibility there. Compare that to the current situation. With how limited slots are these days that just isn't an option when you've only got 8 mod slots to work with over an effective 120 mod point capacity. That's 15 mod points per slot so you better get the best bang for your buck.  After that came Baro who started pumping out rank 10 mods to adjust underpowered mods by making you grind 64x as many cores to max them. Some of these definitely weren't even worthy of a fix, I mean, primed heated charge? Was that really necessary? Imagine how fucking grindy the game would be if every single 90% elemental mod would be if it had a primed variant. If  the meta for slotting the highest cost mod didn't exist initially, Baro definitely brought it to the forefront. There's no reason you'd use a regular mod over it's primed counterpart, even if that means you need to add another forma to your build.   TL;DR this isn't a problem unique to companions, they are just one of many victims of a mod slot system that's starting to show it's age in the face of feature creep in the form of forma and primed mods."

I build for crit because the base multiplier is 2.5x, and Vital Sense + Hammer Shot brings that up to 7x. The crit chance is 37.5% with Point Strike, and with Multishot that means you'll usually get at least one crit per trigger pull. I tend to just double-tap everything, and it almost always dies."

Warframe,3dwhpq,KazumaKat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:26:47 2015 UTC,Interesting use of Hammer Shot. I would have recommended another elemental damage mod as needed...
Warframe,3dwhpq,Schadenfreude11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:35:28 2015 UTC,"Well, one of the reasons I use Hammer Shot is because of the increased status chance. The two dual-stats I use most commonly are Malignant Force and Rime Rounds, resulting in Viral damage. Because actual shot damage is applied AFTER Viral procs, having a high status chance and crit multiplier increases the probability of a one-shot kill. Adding another element would reduce the chance of a Viral proc, potentially resulting in fewer one-shot kills.  Edit: Although Infected Clip or Cryo Rounds would just amp the Viral damage further without adding a new damage type, I still feel the proc is more important."

You have a hitscan rifle that is really accurate, has low recoil, hits pretty hard, fires fast, and each bullet has like an 80% chance to explode and/or slash damage their faces off.   Bonus points is the fact that since you have explosions and slash damage you get body parts and chunks of bodies just flying in every direction. It's a very visceral gun, and it's actually really quite powerful."

Cause I am running 4 dual stat mod+ serration+split chamber+shred+heavy caliber 7/10 but I find it lacks dammage despite amazing statuts chance although with all its advantages you can't expect a huge dps"
Warframe,3dwhpq,Namika,2,Mon Jul 20 06:11:50 2015 UTC,"I go between builds, but the one you mentioned is pretty solid for everything up to 40 minute T4. I've used that build in 40 waves of T4D and held my own. Sure it won't out dps a Bolter or Soma, but it is plenty capable.   While your build (with Corrosive Blast @ 87% proc chance) is a great staple for solo play, and also fantastic against the infested, if you're doing T4 missions you can use more effective builds. The T4 build I use is a little stronger than the usual Blast/Corrosive 4x duel status build you listed, as I only put on 3 dual status mods (for Viral/Fire) and put on max rank Hellfire in place of the last dual status mod. This does two things for you to help your dps. First off, you obviously get a small but noticeable boost in raw damage numbers since Hellfire is 90% bonus to the dual mods's 60% bonus. But more important than that, is the power behind the procs themselves. Even with just 3 dual status you will still have crazy high status chance (78% status vs 87% with 4 mods), but the combination of Viral with Fire and Slash is extremely effective late game with 4x CP auras. Viral cuts everyone to half health, and slash and fire drains them rapidly while fire also stuns them as they stand there burning to death. And with ~79% status chance on a gun that fire 12 bullets a second, you can just tap the trigger and hose down packs of enemies, tagging them all with multiple procs, and then watch them burn and bleed out.   Again, it's not as effective as the Soma/Boltor/Tonkor/Dread, but it's one hell of a fun weapon and it can honestly hold it's own through 99.9% of the game's content. Hell, I use it regularly going through 8 waves of Draco, while no one else even bothers staying past 4 waves even though they are carrying Boltor Primes and Mareloks. If you're going to be in the 0.01% that goes past wave 8 of Draco, then sure, the Braton is not for you. But for everyone else, it's more than capable."

Warframe,3dw4o8,Volfen,7,Mon Jul 20 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"With a competent group you should not be failing that much. In general I actually find nightmare raids easier than normal ones because:   you're more likely to have people that know what they're doing (assuming you adequately vet the group you form) and;  the groups tend to be smaller (ie less than 8), which generally makes things faster/easier.   If you keep getting to the tram part and consistently failing then someone is doing something wrong. It's not especially hard if you know what you're doing and communicate core position, whether you're pausing or clear etc.   If you're failing the tram part then it's either:   Someone getting off a button at the wrong time (knowledge and communication) Someone being pushed off/killed on a button (insufficient CC) The driver pushing it into electricity (knowledge/awareness) Someone dragging the core with them into electricity (knowledge/communication)   To be honest the tram bit is the only part of the raid that requires any thought for a team that knows what it's doing, the rest of it is more or less just going through the motions.

Warframe,3dw4o8,BoopysRevenge,3,Mon Jul 20 03:05:01 2015 UTC,Don't ever go into a recruiting chat NM Raid and expect to win. 90% of the time you've got at least 1 brand new guy and 1 guy who just got carried through his first one.  I only join them to mess around with roles I don't normally play and to scope out players who seem to know what they are doing so I can invite them to fill spots later on.

Warframe,3dw4o8,Tanker0921,8,Mon Jul 20 06:57:29 2015 UTC,"DE really should've taken more pointers from the way Destiny, or rather many more MMO's fashioned their Raids. I use Destiny as an example, because the Vault of Glass is literally the best test of team cooperation currently in the game, and its vanilla content.  1) Instill checkpoints   Seriously, me and my mates found the normal version of the raid to be somewhat difficult the first few times we played around on it, and eventually we had to retire due to real-life stuff getting in the way unexpectedly. By exiting without checkpoints, we have to start that whole ordeal all over again. No thanks.  2) Memorable rewards.   Honestly, the Arcane enchantments are pretty lackluster. There should have been either some unique/situational mods that could either be useful against the Grineer in general, or useful in the Raid (i.e. a mod that reduces the amount of energy the tritium bomb saps from you) for future runs/nightmare runs. The nightmare run could've given out a unique raid weapon BP to players who ran it.  The Arcane enchantments are a good step, but I fear there is only so much DE can do with them and Raids before they become repetitive rewards.   3) Less cheap mechanics that don't build on team coordination  See: The second phase with the button pads and CC-eccentric enemies and what OP mentioned in the post above. Personally, I think that while its ingenious that DE implemented units specialized in CC'ing the players off the pads in the second phase, it began to feel cheap VERY quickly, especially given the absurdly high leveled enemies and their effective HP limits. They're not frustrating, but very annoying rather than feeling like a challenge."
Warframe,3dw4o8,roors99,2,Mon Jul 20 04:16:23 2015 UTC,"1) I think Checkpoints would be pretty redundant imho, after you're used to how stuff works and have a consistent team, you can smash out the whole thing in 25 mins easy.  2) Rewards I sort of agree with, giving Neurode BP's for NM is a kick in the teeth, congrats you just got a 24 hour lockout (which is something else I'd like fixed, make this reset at the same time as everything else) for a worthless blueprint worth 40k credits. As far as Arcane enhancements go though, I'm reasonably happy with them, even if I would prefer a bit more depth and refinement to the system.  3) In regards to the ""cheap"" CC'ing units in phase 2, You do realize CC'ing the enemies is exactly what we do to trivialise the whole encounter right? If they made them super tanky they'd just get CC'd with everything else. If they made them hit super hard, they'd just oneshot someone before they get CC'd. The main reason the enemies don't feel like a challenge is precisely because of the meta we use to make sure they AREN'T a challenge."

Warframe,3dw4o8,roors99,4,Mon Jul 20 01:12:38 2015 UTC,"The concept of testing cooperation is fine. However with this specific mechanic there are other ways you can test a groups coordination and cooperation that actually adds to the experience. To me this feels like adding in the brick wall to those who are either coordinated or not coordinated enough with you either being on one side who isn't affected by this at all and the other to where that one slip up just made you waste 15 minutes of your life.  Something like the proximity mines were a much more commendable addition because it adds an extra element to look our for that can hinder, but not completely ruin the progress you've made.  I always raid with a group of people who know the raid and have never been affected by this problem and every time we go through this stage it plays out exactly the same as the normal raid. Really, it's just there to screw with anyone who isn't as coordinated as us and while there is some merit behind wanting to do that, adding nothing but stress to the experience shows it's not a very good mechanic in my eyes."

Warframe,3dw4o8,Asilidae000,2,Mon Jul 20 10:58:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I have to interject. The Nightmare raids (as only the nightmare raids have instafail implemented) are MEANT to be hell on Earth. They are meant to push the Tenno to their very limits, and to many players the Nightmare raid is the LAST challenge left in the game. Everything else is already easy for them to manage. Coordinating 4 people into a Nightmare raid is the only thing that can test their skills further (I say 4 because yes, many people already nightmare raid without a full team). There are skills and counter measures you can use that legitimately counter everything the enemies are throwing at you in that Nightmare raid. They aren't always easy to pull off but they are manageable and consistent in their effectiveness.   If you want to learn how, if you need help, feel free to PM me. My Clan has run the raids many a time and we've only had one insta-fail. I can show you some pointers, help you run one, teach players how to lead raids etc.  As to rewards and dedicated servers, I'm in agreement that the dedicated servers are long overdue, but new rewards require more code than we can actually realize. Every mod, every weapon, has to be completely scripted, bug tested, balance tested, and then the drop tables have to be modified. It's a rather lengthy process. Especially if it physically appears in game. The Arcanes are something that the community was pining for, and is now asking for more already. Here (and I'm usually the first guy pushing for new stuff to do) we need to take a step back and say ""Ok. We got what we wanted there.""  Don't just hate on the raid because it is hard. Some of the best memories, the best feelings of relief and reward come from overcoming something that feels unfair or insurmountable. Stay dedicated, change up your tactics, and you'll eventually find a way through."

The TTK difference with mag+toxin is incredible. Frankly even just going pure toxin is going to be better againt most corpus enemies.  However anything above lvl 20ish grineer should be done with radiation, as all the most dangerous enemies (bombards, incinerators) and even the common ones (lancers) all have alloy armor, which is vulnerable to radiation, not corrosive. You can get by with corrosive in some cases (heavy gunners remain vulnerable to it), but if you know bombards are going to be in the match, it's probably better to switch out."

Warframe,3dwmj4,nonfat,2,Mon Jul 20 04:03:59 2015 UTC,"Puncture is good against armor (grineer/void grineer) of all varieties. A primary puncture weapon will want a puncture mod, provided the mod is actually good (event mod/sundering strike).  Slashing is good against all infested, if you have a primary slashing weapon you want bonus slashing on it (provided the value is decent, as above).  For Void, you want either Corrosive (most effective against butchers + gunners) + Cold or Radiation (most effective against bombards + lancers) + Toxin/Viral. Toxin will do better against corpus (Toxin skips shields, which Radiation does poorly against) but Viral will do better on Grineer (including Void varieties). Cold is semi-effective against bombards/lancers, Toxin is semi-effective against Butchers/Gunners. I generally suggest Toxin, due to mod load (you'll probably run out of slots without being able to do viral).  For Grineer, you usually want Radiation + Viral as Viral outpaces armor piercing alternatives.  For Infested, Gas will kill the weak things and Corrosive will kill the big things. Heat does good universally.  For Corpus... it's really complicated. Toxin is, point-for-point, the best damage type. This is due to the fact that most Corpus enemies have significantly more shields than health. Toxin skips shields (if you do mixed damage that includes Toxin, you'll damage both health and shields at the same time) which means that it kills basically everything fast as hell. Most Corpus have about twice as much shields as they do HP, so even robots die faster to pure toxin than anything else.  Of course, the big caveat to this is that the toughest enemies (techs and oxium ospreys) have more HP than shields, so shield skipping is largely pointless on them. Puncture does well against robots but poorly against shields while slashing damage does well against flesh but poorly against robots. Impact does good against shields, but badly against flesh.  What this comes down to is that the best damage you'll get against Corpus fleshies is Toxin. The best you'll get against the robots is Toxin (most) or Electricity (oxium ospreys).  Probably the ideal thing to do is to take Viral + Electricity on a blunt weapon, as Viral performs identically to Toxin without the ability to skip shields. Of course, this all goes out the window if you have a Mag, since nothing has shields anymore or is even realistically alive.  The one thing I'll say strongly is that Magnetic + Toxin is a bad idea in spite of it being common wisdom. The enemies Magnetic is most effective on are the high-shield, low HP enemies. These are also the enemies which Toxin is most effective on. These two don't operate in a synergistic manner, since if the magnetic is strong enough to quickly down shields then the toxin's health skip becomes largely meaningless (since corpus have very little actual HP). If the Toxin is strong enough to kill the mark first, then the Magnetic did nothing. This leaves you up a really brown creek against Oxium Ospreys, which lack meaningful shields and take reduced damage from Toxin.  Corpus, unlike other enemy factions, don't have a clear solution for building damage."
Warframe,3dwmj4,Cysic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:13:51 2015 UTC,"I usually go with magnetic myself for the higher level corpus units and combine that with toxic. As I said, this is for higher levels because magnetic does not proc constantly on most weapons and only does significant damage to shields. So toxic helps with the part of the heavy units that are NOT shield based, and magnetic takes care of the shields themselves so all of your weapon damage can get through to the flesh. In lower levels it really doesn't matter too much what you bring, Corpus are going to die pretty damn fast, even up to mid-level. It's the higher levels you really have to worry about when they start sending out all of the heavy units with more health combined with these shields. In this case I would recommend toxic since your other types of damage DO NOT bypass shields these unit's shields with it. In other words, while toxic itself does bypass shields, impact, puncture, fire, electric, gas, blast, corrosive, etc. do NOT. That is a lot of wasted damage potential unless you bring a fully toxin modded Dual Ichor with you.  EDIT: Because I didn't know what I was talking about for the most part, and had to make some corrections."
Warframe,3dwmj4,HRDSalami654,2,Mon Jul 20 04:21:33 2015 UTC,Here's what I do:  Corpus: Magnetic + Toxin (priority on Toxin)  Everything else (but no 4x Corrosive Projection Aura): Corrosive + Heat  With 4x Corrosive Projection: Viral + Heat

Infested you can go corrosive, but that really is only for the Ancients, or MOA's.  Otherwise a lot of heat is good.  Puncture is good for grineer, slash I would only do against infested, as their are all pure flesh and no negative.  Heat + Slash is a good combo"

Warframe,3dwmj4,Klepto666,2,Mon Jul 20 04:03:57 2015 UTC,"Normally I don't rely on status procs as I can't guarantee that I get the one I want in that dire moment. I could get 6 Puncture procs in a row when I was really wishing for Fire or something.  If a weapon is being built for crits, then picking the full-damage elemental mods is probably better, as that damage will be giving a massive boost to your crits.  However if the weapon isn't being built for crits, you could still use those mods to simply boost the weapon's damage anyway.  But if you wanted some more procs, or the weapon already has a naturally high status chance and isn't being built around crits, then the status-boosting elemental mods may be better as you might be able to get the status chance up towards 75% or higher. (Adding Multishot mod might be required to hit this number)  But as always I hope others weigh in in case my opinion is misinformed."
Warframe,3dwmj4,_Bilas,2,Mon Jul 20 04:23:15 2015 UTC,"I have a general rule: if I can regularly achieve 3+ status procs per second then I build for status. Otherwise just focus on elemental damage.

Warframe,3dwmj4,GeckoOBac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:56:28 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, the ""canon"" elemental types to use are these:  Grineer and corrupted: Radiation + Viral (that's heat+ele and toxin+cold)  Corpus: Magnetic and toxin (cold + elect. Gas would work but toxin bypasses shields altogether, which is normally faster)  Infested: Corrosive (Elec + toxin) and either fire (for pure damage) or blast (slightly worse damage but provides a bit of CC with a high status gun). Slash works too but it's not worth modding for it unless you have a very high base slash damage AND the event mods for slash (the +120%, not the +90%).  Now, a different consideration must be made for the special case of very high endless Void, with 4x Corrosive Projections.  In that case there is no armor, as such Radiation and Corrosive are kinda pointless, although corrosive is good against ancients and radiation providing some measure of CC. IMHO however in that case the best setup would be Viral + Heat. Viral is good as a damage base and the proc is DEFINITELY great in endless content (remove half enemy hp? hell yeah). Heat is going to be better against most enemies there (all the grineer enemies are vulnerable, the ancients too and no corpus has resistance to it, except for the nullifier shield, which however is damage capped per hit anyway). Plus there's a dot and small CC effect attached to heat as well."

Warframe,3du5o4,endargomar,21,Sun Jul 19 15:16:57 2015 UTC,"they dont, afaik.  what i would like is for their buff to be more apparent on first glance, including where the ancient is.  more often than not, you empty half a mag into something that should die after a few rounds, and realize ""oh yeah, there was an ancient around the corner"".  a tether or a very visible aura, even just a translucent globe would be more than welcome. and no, this very faint shimmer that it currently does is not cutting it, with all the effects and clutter going on."
Warframe,3du5o4,Fubulicious,2,Sun Jul 19 15:36:30 2015 UTC,"Correct, they do not buff themselves. They also do have a visible aura on their allies. Additionally when you shoot enemies under the aura effect you should see numbers pop up above the ancient as they're shielding the damage and healing iirc."
Warframe,3du5o4,CleanRandal,5,Sun Jul 19 15:54:20 2015 UTC,This is true. Ancients cannot buff each other either.

Keep an eye on your numbers - if you're suddenly hitting too low, search for the ancient and mow him down.   And since they're infested, they fit just perfect with the corrosive Soma Prime setup (slash/corrosive), letting you quickly melt those guys no matter how far into the void you are."
Warframe,3du5o4,AlexOfSpades,3,Sun Jul 19 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"But that doesn't address anything.  1: Not everyone runs OP Prime so it's not a perfect fit without forcing you into it.  2: Ancients have no aura around them in a game where enemies clump up, get stuck behind scenery, or seemingly hide from you. That ancient buffing everything is not easy to find really."
Warframe,3du5o4,solaurus,5,Sun Jul 19 16:21:07 2015 UTC,"That ancient buffing everything is not easy to find really.   Well, its high-level void. It's not supposed to be easy.   Still, its not like the game doesn't give you a multitude of options to deal with them:   Soma OP Prime is not the only viable weapon to kill them. Dread, Braton P, Tonkor, Vectis, Amprex... The list goes on. Infested have always been squishy. Scan them and try them out at the Simulacrum. Bring a frame to counter them. Nova will make it a piece of cake (AMD oneshots them, molecular prime counters their defense buff and will make your non-meta guns kill them). CC Frames will make their buffed defense easier to deal with, and a skilled Nyx may even mind-control them to help the squad. Any damage buffer frame (Shock Trooper, Fireball Frenzy, Total Eclipse, etc) will significantly help. 4x CP weakens the tough, armored units, making them easier to deal with even if they're buffed by an Ancient. Use molecular prime then mow them down - you can always brute force your way through, as long as you have enough dakka. Mesa's Ballistic Battery, by the way, used to ignore their defense buff. Combined with a crit-weapon, a headshot will kill even the toughest Eximus despite ancients buffing them. Fight smart. If you can't find the Ancient and brute-forcing your way through isn't possible anymore, retreat. Copter away and force them to follow you - they'll disperse, and pick the units that are unbuffed. If they're still buffed, then the Ancient is following somewhere, probably out of his cover now.    I sincerely wish I could write a thing like this about Nullifiers, but they're so cheap there really aren't so many tactics against them."
Warframe,3du5o4,AlexOfSpades,2,Sun Jul 19 16:41:06 2015 UTC,"Well, its high-level void. It's not supposed to be easy.    There are different kinds of difficulty in gaming, ancients heavily verge on the artificial side.  Yea, Ancients are squishy as shit, I could probably kill them with a god damn Lato, but finding them can sometimes be an impossible task due to their Aura and Link having zero indication to where they are.   Bring a frame to counter them. Nova will make it a piece of cake (AMD oneshots them, molecular prime counters their defense buff and will make your non-meta guns kill them). CC Frames will make their buffed defense easier to deal with, and a skilled Nyx may even mind-control them to help the squad. Any damage buffer frame (Shock Trooper, Fireball Frenzy, Total Eclipse, etc) will significantly help.   1) You're gating the game into having a very small amount of frames to deal with them and  2) The frames you mentioned aren't even that useful against an Ancient. Any frame in the game can kill an Ancient if they can see it, almost all of the abilities you mentioned work the same way outside of Chaos, which is purged and blocked by Null Bubbles.   4x CP weakens the tough, armored units, making them easier to deal with even if they're buffed by an Ancient. Use molecular prime then mow them down - you can always brute force your way through, as long as you have enough dakka.   Ancients have a 90% damage reduction aura and a 50% damage reduction link, that's equivalent to adding around 8500 armour to every single unit around them. Generally you can brute force through the aura with an extremely powerful weapon, in low level void on light enemies, but anything higher than that just takes way too long to be worth your time, even with damage increases.   Mesa's Ballistic Battery, by the way, used to ignore their defense buff. Combined with a crit-weapon, a headshot will kill even the toughest Eximus despite ancients buffing them.   Just checked that, it doesn't ignore the damage reduction.   Fight smart. If you can't find the Ancient and brute-forcing your way through isn't possible anymore, retreat. Copter away and force them to follow you - they'll disperse, and pick the units that are unbuffed. If they're still buffed, then the Ancient is following somewhere, probably out of his cover now.    Ancients are only really a problem in Defense, which is where that tactic doesn't work. Ancients are only a slight annoyance in other mission types, but in Defense a single Ancient can lose you the mission."

Ideally every frame should be viable in endgame, and if they aren't its a balancing issue, not the Ancient's fault.    Ancients are only really a problem in Defense   You mean, the smallest Void map? They don't have lots of places to hide, and lasers oneshot whatever they're buffing (including Nullies). Either they're behind a wall (chase them) or on the second floor (copter up there).  It's not impossible. Its just an additional challenge. Its frustrating at first to have a ""so-easy-I-can-play-braindead"" mission turn into a ""okay I gotta pay attention now"" type, specially in a game with such a shitty RNG you gotta re-do the mission a trillion times, but at least it makes it more engaging. And it's an indirect Mesa nerf, which is kind of neat.   You know what I'd do to Ancients? I' make them bigger. I think that's the perfect balancing tool. Leave them as they are, just make them taller and shinier. This will make snipers more relevant, too."
Warframe,3du5o4,AlexOfSpades,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:41:40 2015 UTC,"Nah, I was just posting a few examples. Ideally every frame should be viable in endgame, and if they aren't its a balancing issue, not the Ancient's fault.    That would mean every frame would need an ability that disables the aura in some way, which homogenizes frames, which is bad balance.   You mean, the smallest Void map? They don't have lots of places to hide, and lasers oneshot whatever they're buffing (including Nullies). Either they're behind a wall (chase them) or on the second floor (copter up there).   Lasers have cooldowns and once the level becomes high enough you can't even actually go out to kill Ancients. They can also hide behind other enemies, and in a sea of swarming corrupted hellspawn, it's hard to pick them out from the pack.   You know what I'd do to Ancients? I' make them bigger. I think that's the perfect balancing tool. Leave them as they are, just make them taller and shinier. This will make snipers more relevant, too.    Completely agree 100%, Ancients need to be more noticeable, that would remove most of the bullshit from them. Being able to snipe them out of the pack instead of them huddling behind a single crewman would help so much."
Warframe,3du5o4,Davoness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:46:52 2015 UTC,"You make good points, and trust me, I definitely don't want the game to be any easier. Most ever is just a more noticeable aura on effected enemies so you can tell without straining that they are being buffed."
Warframe,3du5o4,solaurus,0,Sun Jul 19 19:52:31 2015 UTC,"In defenses past wave 40, the map is clogged with enemies while the ancients hide behind walls or in nullifiers. Having an entire sea of buffed near-invulnerable things that should be squishy is ridiculous."
Warframe,3du5o4,DeathOnion,-6,Sun Jul 19 18:30:38 2015 UTC,"Because it makes you vary up your gear. If you want to deal with Corrupted Ancients easily, proc them with radiation.  This is a step in the right direction for proc dependency, which up until now has been (and still mostly is) completely irrelevant because of weapons like the Soma and Boltor Prime, which feature basically no proccing (as opposed to the Braton Prime and Grakata) yet make up for it with power creep levels of pure DPS."
Warframe,3du5o4,Fronteror,15,Sun Jul 19 14:50:20 2015 UTC,"It doesn't vary up your gear, it shoe-horns you into getting radiation, that isn't variance, that's gating.  There's also the fact that switching weapons is slow as shit, which makes the task just annoying. So then you have to get Radiation on your primary weapon if you want to avoid that, which means your DPS takes a pretty significant hit."
Warframe,3du5o4,Davoness,3,Sun Jul 19 14:57:20 2015 UTC,"Rad? Ancients are weak to corrosive. Unless you play such high level content that you have to proc them instead to disable them. In which case such balance is not necessary.  Meaning yes, more than one element is viable."
Warframe,3du5o4,lightningleaf,4,Sun Jul 19 15:47:40 2015 UTC,Radiation disables the Ancient's buff.
Warframe,3du5o4,Fronteror,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:00:50 2015 UTC,I know. My point was corrosive is also viable.
Warframe,3du5o4,lightningleaf,3,Sun Jul 19 16:02:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if you need to get rid of the buff immediately instead of going out of your way to kill the Ancient outright, radiation really shines.  But I digress, your point is valid - in shorter missions or solo. However, corrosive is less useful if you're running 4xCP, since viral is the way to go then. That's pretty much why I always carry a secondary weapon with a different element build, like viral+heat PGrakata with corrosive LexP/Rakta Ballistica backing it up."
Warframe,3du5o4,Fronteror,3,Sun Jul 19 16:06:35 2015 UTC,I'm not trying to say Radiation isn't useful. My counterargument is not to hate on Radiation. It's supposed to act as reasoning that can be paralleled to any damage type. I didn't respond to you for a reason.

All you have to do is kill the ancient to stop its buff   Yes, kill the ancient that I can't see and is probably behind a corner somewhere or underneath the stairs or behind a wall running around in circles. Most of the time you don't even see an Ancient giving off it's aura because you can't tell where the fucker is.   And you wanna bring warframes into this? Fine. Nyx can completely disable ancients. Loki with Irradiating can as well.   Have to both be aware of the ancient existing for that to work, unless you're spamming the abilities constantly, which you can't even do with Chaos and Disarm is Loki's ultimate which costs a lot of energy since you generally don't run Fleeting Expertise on him. Null Bubbles also disable this plan. Even if any of this did reliably work, you're still being gated into having one of two frames to deal with a single unit, that's really bad game design. You can argue ""tactics"" and ""strategy"" and ""counters"" all you damn well want, but gating a silly third person action game into two of the 23 frames in the game is not good.   Let's move onto CC. Banshee, Mag, Nova, Hydroid, Frost - and oh yeah, pretty much all the frames with a 4th AoE.   Not really sure why you listed frames with CC... I mean having CC in high level void is already a standard, but it also doesn't help you deal with Ancients. I have no idea why you mentioned it, or even used it as a point in your argument."

Warframe,3dt32g,Savletto,7,Sun Jul 19 09:30:12 2015 UTC,"I semi-agree with this. I do think that some of the higher Grineer do show signs of breaking their brainwashing though. Take Tyl Regor, or the Steel Meridian girl (I really wish I knew here real name) for example. There is evidence that the Grineer do have SOME kind of thinking beyond ""must kill Tenno"" but it doesn't show up all that often."
Warframe,3dt32g,HRDSalami654,8,Sun Jul 19 11:07:37 2015 UTC,"Lorewise there are certain Grineer that get mutations that make it impossible to brainwash them - hence the Bailifs - as for them having thinking beyond 'must kill Tenno', oh yeah. The thing is they're just soldiers; they're conditioned to act the way they are in their training.

Warframe,3dt32g,T_mpest,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:19:20 2015 UTC,"No I don't think they will ""turn"", but these are just grunts we are fighting in the first place. We do know Grineer are a warrior race that constantly battle, among themselves and against others. They are conditioned to fight from the moment they are ""born"". That does not mean that I shouldn't feel bad for killing a lot of them, and it certainly doesn't justify the killing by itself. What does justify the killing is my own survival and accomplishing my mission as a Tenno in this game. The Grineer and the Corpus both have issues with the fact that they were designed as mob units first and actual living things second. The downside to this is that they are hard to empathize with outside of a few pages of lore and some conjecture.   That being said, I do believe there are a certain segment of them that, for whatever reason, do gain enough personality to make them dangerous to the Grineer empire. Vor could be an example of this, as could Tyl Regor and the Steel Meridian leader. Unfortunately these are but fractions of the the Grineer race as a whole."

Anyway if you want more stuff just play the game until you get 4 or 5 planets in, then you should have access to every resource.

I think you can buy the Paris bow straight off of the market. Most weapons require you to buy the blueprint, but the starting weapons (which are MK1 by the way, they're weaker versions of the real weapons you need to craft) should be in the shop for you to buy immediately.  Here's some very basic info on how to build a frame or weapon:   First, you need to find a blueprint. For all intents and purposes, you can find many blueprints in the shop. You buy the blueprint, and then the blueprint tells you what is required for the item, as well as how long it takes to make. Weapons are pretty simple. They usually involve a number of resources and credits. Some weapons use other weapons as an ingredient. Warframes are a bit more unique though. You need to build the Helmet, Chassis, and Systems. You also need to buy the warframe blueprint itself, which lists the above items as ingredients. You can buy the warframe blueprint in the shop, but the blueprints for the individual parts need to be found elsewhere. Normally they are dropped via bosses or a special quest.    Note that this is only if you want to make it for free. You can use Platinum to buy weapons and frames with no ingredients or wait time. You can also use platinum to bypass the wait time for building items. The catch? Platinum is only obtainable in two ways: you either spend cash to buy it straight from the developer, or you trade items to another player for platinum.   Right now you want to work your way through the planets and open as many nodes as possible. This is because of alerts. These are small mini-events that happen each hour or so. Alerts are basically the game telling you ""Hey, do this mission right now and you can get some immediate stuff"". Usually the reward is credits, but sometimes it also has mods. Additionally, you'll want to clear the boss of each planet at least once. This is because you will unlock a new planet when you defeat the boss of a planet for the first time. Look up one of the planet maps for more info.  The game is much easier if you make friends because they can taxi you to missions (allow you to do missions on nodes and planets that you haven't unlocked yet) and allow you to always have someone to do a mission with.  You can probably get Mag in a week or less. The paris should be available straight from the market. If you want, you can add me"

Warframe,3dxmvl,Nazek42,4,Tue Jul 21 14:05:16 2015 UTC,"Well, let's see about getting them.. holy hell that's a lot of weapons and a lot of credits or plat or resources or what or how do I even. Help? xP   Don't spend plat on weapons or frames, at least not the beginner stuff.  Weapons   Blueprints for most weapons can be acquired in the market for ~15-30k each (under primary/secondary/melee blueprints) and then require some time and resources Beginner weapons (like the MK-1 Paris) can be bought for 15k off the market, fully built (under primary/secondary/melee weapons) A good portion of weapons is also only available from the clan dojo, with another handful dropping from bosses around the solar system.   Frames   Most frame parts drop from planet bosses, e.g. Mag drops from ""The Sergeant"" on Mars, one of the early planets After you have all three parts buy the blueprint for the frame off the market (under warframes -> blueprints) for ~15-30k, with another ~15-30k cost upon production. Volt, Banshee and Zephyr do not drop, and the blueprints are not sold in the market, but all their stuff can be bought in a clan dojo in the tenno lab. Mirage, Limbo and Chroma have some special questlines and cannot be acquired otherwise.   As for     I just don't want to be stuck with generic assault rifle and the 'calibur longer than I have to be.   you don't have to. The few credits neccessary to get the starter gear your want are quite easy to acquire and Mag is available from one of the earliest planets, like right after you finish the initial tutorial questline.  However, I'd say try and level your stuff to 30 before switching. Leveling your gear is how you increase your mastery rank (think ""your account's global level""), and that's quite important early on. You probably want to level the Braton and Excal sooner or later anyway, and then you'll probably go ""Uuuuch, why did I get rid of that before maxing it :|"""
Warframe,3dxmvl,Zeichner,4,Mon Jul 20 11:50:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, simmer down.  You're focused too much on everything at once.  Breath in... Breathe out... Feel better?  Good...  So it's safe to say you started with Mag and want her back.  She's on Mars with The Sargeant.  So you have four planets to get through three other planets to get there.  You're on Mercury with Vor as of now and have to beat him to unlock the little limiter he put on you.  After that, it's the Jackal and his spiny legs.  If you beat him enough, you'll be able to find Rhino who can act like the Juggernaut and shrug off damage.  With Excalibur, you can act like a ninja and slash everything that stands in your way or just take on everything with your guns.  With Rhino, you can work to run in, kill everything that moves and still make it in time for supper.  Choice is yours.  From there, I don't think you have to fight Vey Hek to get the Mars Key, so just complete the missions with the mods that get dropped.  When you get on Mars, pop The Sarge a good one for me.  Beat him a few times and you can build a new Mag.  In regards to weapons, I picked up a Cronus and called it a day.  With the Paris, you're looking at a slower pace than with an Assault Rifle so keep that in mind.  Hope that helps."
Warframe,3dxmvl,Inuma,3,Mon Jul 20 12:11:01 2015 UTC,"Excalibur, post-rework, is a lot more versatile than Mag. Mag is AMAZING against Corpus and is halfway decent in the Void, but Excalibur's potency doesn't rely on the enemies having shields (half of the factions in the game don't have shields).  Honestly, the Mk1 Braton is the best starter weapon. The Mk1 Paris is slow as all heck, and don't really have the damage to back it up. It's only until you get things like the Dread/Paris Prime that you get a bow that actually is good.  TL;DR: Don't worry about it, you're probably better off with Excal and MK1 Braton as your starter gear. Make your way through the Star Chart, then start gathering resources."
Warframe,3dxmvl,InvaderMEEN,2,Mon Jul 20 11:49:09 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, the stuff you want is fairly easy to obtain. The starter weapons are all available in the Market for credits, while Mag's parts drop from what is probably the easiest boss in the game. You'll still need to farm up some resources to build her, but you can get help with that.  In the meantime, don't trash any of the stuff you've already got. At some point you'll want to come back and max it out for the Mastery points. You also won't be able to get another Excalibur for a while, since his parts drop from the boss on Pluto."
Warframe,3dxmvl,cephalopodAscendant,2,Mon Jul 20 12:03:53 2015 UTC,"holy hell that's a lot of weapons   Including Archwing guns:   76 primaries 64 secondaries 83 melee   Plus 37 frames and 12 companions   Being stuck with a frame/weapon I didn't choose is kind of annoying.   MK1 Paris might've been cool and all, but trust me when I say, that it's really bad when you are swarmed by enemies. Which is 90% of the time.  Mag herself is also rather squishy.  Excalibut after the rework, however... Exalted Blade FTW. He's easily one of the best frames now, when modded correctly that is. I see Excaliburs even in the endgame, and they do good.   What's the best/fastest way to get to stuff I do want?   Some of the weapons, mainly the MK1 ones (MK1 Paris included) you can buy for credits. No crafting, no nothing, you just buya ready weapon.   I just don't want to be stuck with generic assault rifle and the 'calibur longer than I have to be.   Then craft more weapons1 It doesn't matter what weapons, test them all! You like how Karak looks? Build it! You think Afuris may be cool? Build it! Level it up to 30, mod it, and if you don't like it - sell it.  Sooner or later you'll have to craft and level up every weapon, that's the only way to get Mastery towards Mastery Rank - your overall account level. Might as well start now, right?  Also:   I played in the beta years ago   Warframe is still in Open Beta."

Warframe,3dts60,domyno12345,35,Sun Jul 19 11:33:58 2015 UTC,"While this is true, the excess efficiency can still be used as a buffer for negative efficiency mods, like Blind Rage.  Though with what we have at the moment, that's only an extra 15% - enough to accommodate an R2 blind rage whilst keeping max efficiency.  Edit: I meant an extra 15% in power efficiency available as buffer - not a Pwr str increase of 15%"
Warframe,3dts60,Syzodia,8,Sun Jul 19 13:37:33 2015 UTC,With a R2 Blaind Rage you get +27% power damage while still retaining max power efficiency.
Warframe,3dts60,hyperblaster,5,Sun Jul 19 14:05:43 2015 UTC,"You can also crank up Blind Rage to rank 7 for +72% power strength at the cost of dropping down to +50% efficiency. Half cost abilities still aren't bad, especially with the ones that scale heavily with strength like Ember's entire set or Shield Polarize."
Warframe,3dts60,Kuryaka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"Which is where having extra Blind Rage at certain ranking breakpoints is a thing for tweaking builds. I know, it can get expensive, but the flexibility is just too good to ignore..."
Warframe,3dts60,KazumaKat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:26:24 2015 UTC,Wish we could downscale mod ranks but that would reduce grinding so that's bad for DE.
Warframe,3dts60,Palpetinus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:45:20 2015 UTC,"With Shield Polarize a rank 4 Blind Rage (+45% strength, -25% efficiency) is sufficient if you combine it with a rank 10 Transient Fortitude (+55% strength, -27.5% power duration). This'll leave you with 65% efficiency, which is pretty good."
Warframe,3dts60,blolfighter,2,Sun Jul 19 23:43:41 2015 UTC,"Mm. It's enough to drain all the shields and then you get diminishing returns after that for more strength.  I ranked up that Blind Rage before Transient was released, have another one at rank 2 for a little extra strength, but didn't think about getting another Blind Rage to save some efficiency. Thanks!"
Warframe,3dts60,Kuryaka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:54:38 2015 UTC,"I decided to do a little math to see how diminishing the returns actually are. For an enemy with 1000 shields, the explosion deals the following damages:  100% power strength: 1250 damage 200% power strength: 5000 damage 300% power strength: 7500 damage  The increase from 100% -> 200% is 4x as much damage, twice as much as you'd see from a normal damaging ability. Meanwhile the increase from 200% -> 300% is 1.5x as much damage, which is the same as you'd see from a normal damaging ability.  So, unsurprisingly, the ""diminishing returns"" is only compared to the greater payoff that Shield Polarize normally gets from power strength, and power strength beyond 200% will still increase the damage just as much as other damaging abilities.  However, since Shield Polarize scales with enemy levels (higher level = more shields = more damage), 200% is still enough in my opinion."
Warframe,3dts60,blolfighter,2,Mon Jul 20 00:10:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Diminishing in the sense that you lose one of the multipliers.   Interpreting it another way for a group of enemies with 1000 shields, 100% power strength does 750 health damage (500 mitigated by the remaining 500 shields) while 200% does 5000 health damage. That's an even bigger power spike, so it's way more than enough in most cases. Unfortunately, Nullifiers as well as Corrupted Ancients make Mag sad.  Ember though... Ember is what I use on short missions when I want to level weapons. Amplifying heat damage to make weak weapons hit harder, clearing hard-to-find enemies with WoF, and being able to Accelerant -> Fireball and oneshot a heavy in T3E. Aw yiss."
Warframe,3dts60,Kuryaka,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:23:51 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'd put it a different way. At 100% power strength, the ability actually does 1750 damage against groups (assuming they're all shielded with 1000 shields). Because first it drains half their shields for 500 damage, then it deals 1250 damage in an explosion. With that in mind, here are the adjusted numbers:  100% power strength: 1750 damage 200% power strength: 6000 damage 300% power strength: 8500 damage  Calculated this way, the increase from 100% -> 200% is ~3.4x as much, while the increase from 200% -> 300% is ~1.4x as much. So the diminishment in returns is actually slightly lower than before."
Warframe,3dts60,blolfighter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:55:57 2015 UTC,"But then there's the fact that the explosion damage decreases with distance. 20 crewmen = big crowd dies, 2 crewmen spread out = mild damage.  So the flat drain is a given, while the explosion damage can only go down from there.   Eh. Either way, 200% power strength is good for removing all the shields, I like numbers but not too many theoreticals beyond that."

We didn't know you could buy coordinates for plat until afterwards, so for us, every failed missions was actually 10 missions (3 infested runs per coordinate, 3 coordinates per key). So that means a total of 270 missions were run until we got the helmet. Granted, many of those missions we ran together, cutting down the total time, but the point stands.  With Vauban, I simply had to wait until the pieces I needed showed up in Alerts. I only ever ran 2 missions for him (got the 3rd piece in a login reward). Sure, the time it took to get Vauban may have been longer, but the amount of effort and disappointment? Infinitesimal compared to Mesa.  Hydroid wasn't as bad as Mesa, but it was frustrating. 32 completions to get Hydroid, and it wasn't even for myself.

I wouldn't be surprised if Dark Excalibur Prime is exclusive to Chinaframe.

Warframe,3duq12,RegnumIrae,3,Sun Jul 19 17:42:18 2015 UTC,This is my Bladestorm Build:  Max Transient Fortitude  Intesify  Fleeting expertise R4  Streamline  Stretch  Primed Flow  Redirection  Then any mod you would like.  This leaves you with like 22% Duration but you could add a primed continuity for reviving team mates or activating lifesupport.  The best thing you could have on this build would be Arcane trickery and here's why:  Trickery triggers off finishers.  Bladestorm is all finisher damage and with a Maxed arcane trickery on your Syandana or Helmet (Both is just OP and preferred) you get a 10% chance to trigger Invisibility like Loki's for 20 seconds.  each Arcane helmet / Syandana triggers independently and it honestly seems more like 30-50% of the time it will trigger (the more enemies the better).  Here's the thing about trickery though.  It's pretty over powered and not sure if many people knew this already but it's literally god mode on ash.  It IGNORES Nullifier Bubbles and doesn't deactivate. So you can literally walk in a nullifier bubble and kill with ease.   Well That's my Bladestorm Ash/ Go To Ash to take me far into late game.    Edit: Spelling corrections

Warframe,3duq12,Kaleon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:50:28 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with Primed Flow, Ash doesn't use energy very often and with max efficiency you really don't need such a large energy pool."
Warframe,3duq12,Davoness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:53:27 2015 UTC,Read my response to /u/Kaleon  Also in my suggestion above I have 7/8 Mod slots leaving room to one mod for utility/survivability in which I do sometimes slot in a Vitality
Warframe,3duq12,Irascibleness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:18:45 2015 UTC,"Enery leech eximi.   You aren't effected by energy leech during Bladestorm, the leech isn't enough to justify the mod slot and they aren't common enough to justify a wasted slot either.   Damage fall off    Bladestorm only falls off after level ~150, when enemies actually have enough Health to survive one slash. Bladestorm ignores armour.   having to spam it more and more and wasting that time to drop an energy restore can get you killed. Especially since it takes like a second or two when you could be using bladestorm.   Maybe you have extremely slow fingers or something, but pressing the gear hotkey and hitting 4 is not a task that takes multiple seconds, using energy gear would slow down your ability usage by like 0.5 seconds at most and are you really going to have a bad mod slot to save 0.5 seconds in the extremely unlikely occurrence that you don't have energy? And don't even try to act like that would save you, Ash is tanky as hell."
Warframe,3duq12,Davoness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:31:51 2015 UTC,I'm on Console.  The whole pressing the inventory then moving the joystick and sometimes missing but I'll try without Prime flow if you so insist its better  Edit: Also just tested. Energy does get leeched while in bladestorm. Toxin doesn't affect you though.
Warframe,3duq12,Irascibleness,2,Mon Jul 20 03:50:25 2015 UTC,"Drop Redirection and pop Vitality in. Ash has a large health pool and Vitality synergizes much better with Rage. To regen health, just bring a weapon with Life Strike and do a finisher attack on enemies to regen health. You will be invulnerable for the duration of the finisher and come out with full hp! One last thing you should try to get is Arcane Trickery. His Bladestorm finisher kills will trigger it so you should be invisible for as long as you're able to kill enemies!  Ps: I might be wrong, as I very rarely play ash, but I believe you are untargetable/invulnerable during the duration of Bladestorm."
Warframe,3duq12,slow_excellence,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:26:29 2015 UTC,"Yes. You are invincible during bladestorm animation.  This is why I'd recommend redirection due to the extra shields saving the hit to your direct health and then regenerating during bladestorm. This is also why I dont use Rage on ash because with max efficiency and strength you're targetting a killing groups of enemies.  You'll generally have more energy than needed. I honestly think quick thinking + Lifestrike would save you quicker than rage.   High level enemies tend to knock your health out before you being able to react and target your bladestorm.  And as I've stated, you generally have a lot more energy than needed so quick thinking gives you that extra second or two for you to pull that bladestorm off in hopes that it will save you.  Edt: I still wouldn't recommend either. Heck I'd probably slap a handspring before since knockdowns are technically what kills Ash the most for me."
Warframe,3duq12,Irascibleness,2,Sun Jul 19 22:17:58 2015 UTC,Thanks! I didn't think about being able to regen shields during Bladestorm!
Warframe,3duq12,slow_excellence,2,Sun Jul 19 23:03:38 2015 UTC,I'd recommend Transient Fortitude over Blind Rage. You want to be able to spam 4 as much as possible.

Warframe,3duq12,Davoness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:18:44 2015 UTC,"You can have max efficiency while still having a R3/4 (can't remember which rank it needs to be) Blind Rage, pretty useful for some damage but not needed at all. Bladestorm one-shots anything anyway, adding 25% more damage doesn't help that much, except for Shuriken, I guess."
Warframe,3duq12,chozenone54,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:55:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you wouldn't want to max it. Transient Fortitude is safe to max since with Fleeting Expertise you're already building for low duration. If you want to go invisible as Ash, spend a ludicrous amount of platinum in trade to get a maxed Arcane Trickery on your helmet and syndana to get a 20% chance to go invisible for 20 seconds whenever you deal finisher damage, that is to say, get a hit with Bladestorm."

Warframe,3du32j,Schadenfreude11,3,Sun Jul 19 14:50:57 2015 UTC,"Earth Dark sector gives you 3-4 over a 30 min run. Unfortunately, you need a lot of Neurodes in Warframe. I honestly think out of all the ""rare"" material in the game, you end up needing the most Neurodes if you want to build everything. You need like seriously close to 200. Sure you can get 2-3 Neurodes from Lephantis, but when you need dozens of Neurodes every week, that's not a fun grind to have to do every single day...  What I highly recommend is waiting until you have a good weekend where you know you can play a lot. Then buy a 3 day Resource Booster to double all your pickups (it's only like 35plat, a bargain if you make use of your time with it active). Once you have the booster, go to the Dark Sector Earth Evacuation with a Nekros, an EV Trinity, and a Piltering Hydroid or two.   I'm not even exaggerating here, I did the above and I was leaving after 30 minutes with around 35 or so Neurodes. From one run! Over the course of the weekend I ran it a dozen times and by Monday morning I had over 300 Neurodes.   Also use this time to farm the other rare resources you need. Neural Sensors, Orkin Cells, Gallium, even Poly Bundles and Plastids. If you play your cards right, you will spend 35 plat on that Resource Booster, and finish after 3 days never having to ever worry about any resources ever again."

Most people are found haunting the Recruiting chat, mainly looking for Void Maps and Raids, with the occasional Vault Runs. Some popular nodes that people usually visit are the boss nodes, Mercury - Apollodorus for early leveling, and the Dark Sector missions of planets (Sechura - Pluto, for credit farming).  My advice is to drop a comment in recruiting, saying you're clearing x planet and you are looking for a group.  Also, not sure why but the community is generally really nice - they may just have chat minimized or in Clan chat.

Warframe,3dwjlp,Trumbles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:15:15 2015 UTC,"Well I had the same issue two weeks ago.  The short answer is: no one is playing regular missions, because there is no point.  The reason is that regular missions don't give you anything interesting after you've played them once. So from a certain point onward you only play one of the following:   Dark Sector Defenses: for credits and affinity Alad V: for Neural sensors G Sargas Ruk: for Orokin Cells (although he seems to be less likely to drop them lately - if someone knows a better method please tell me) Augustus (Mars): for Void Keys   Most players spent most their time in the Void as there you get the best rewards: prime parts which you can use to build prime weapons/warframes or trade with Baro Ki'Teer.  I personally also like playing high level Spy missions as they are not as dull as the above and you get some pretty good rewards as well.  Basically unless you have friends or a clan with players that are roughly at your progression level you will solo most missions, which gets easier as soon as you have some good mods.  I solo'd most missions with this setup:   Excalibur (+ near maxed vitality, redirection and steel fiber) Boltor (+ near maxed seration + elemental combo) Tipedo (+ maxed crit dmg/chance and maxed point strike + elemental combo) Hikou (+ near maxed hornet strike + elemental combo)   I potato'd all of them but didn't use any forma. Any open slots I filled with some additional random mods I had lying around. With this setup you should be able to solo all missions.

Warframe,3dwjlp,simkhovich,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:54:20 2015 UTC,"Nobody ever plays the planets past Jupiter or Saturn cause nobody wants to put in the same amount of effort and time that something on Jupiter when Void gives better rewards for the exact amount of effort and time. Why would I waste 20 minutes of my time in Jupiter or Saturn Survival when I can just go to Void Survival and get better rewards for the same 20 minutes? And people don't want to communicate cause that forces them to stop moving and type back, and if they stop moving, then the mission won't be cleared fast enough.

Warframe,3dx5kh,TheMagicGlue,4,Mon Jul 20 07:12:00 2015 UTC,"Given your current gear I suggest staying away from Saturn. Try leveling in Mercury first (Apollodorus is rather nice) and get most of your equipment up to rank 30. That way you can slot some more mods in and increase survivability. If you had unlocked Saturn I'm assuming you have a rather large amount of credits at your disposal. The market offers a wide selection of weaponry that are relatively cheap to craft. Early on bows are complicated to use as your probably do not have the mods to make them shine, I can't recommend a good market primary that is easy to craft but I can help you with the other two. For a secondary I would see boltos good for you aswell as vipers, both of which can be made into the akboltos and twin vipers. A melee weapon I often recommend is the Dual Zorens as they are relatively cheap and deal high damage."

Warframe,3dx5kh,RaveCougar,2,Mon Jul 20 07:24:12 2015 UTC,The gear you have is fine tbh (change your melee weapon though). The level suggestions are something that pertains to the level of enemies that spawn on the planet higher level enemies tend to have higher armor and accuracy.

Warframe,3dx5kh,RaveCougar,2,Mon Jul 20 07:38:11 2015 UTC,"Most of the materials that you need to craft are available in most of the starting planets.

Thanks once again."
Warframe,3dx5kh,Trumbles,2,Mon Jul 20 07:46:40 2015 UTC,"Loki himself is a very powerful frame in terms of utility rather than damage. Unfortunately he also requires some high end/corrupted mods to truly work, many of which I doubt you have. You can still learn him though as he is quite fun. But inevitably please switch to another frame such as Mag, Rhino, and possibly Ember. Ember is a high damage frame with useful abilities but her parts drop from the boss tile on Saturn. Both Mag and Rhino are good starter frames, Mag (Mars) being a corpus killer and Rhino (Venus) having nigh invincibility with his ability Iron Skin up until the high level planets."

Warframe,3dx9ic,ajdeemo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:31:01 2015 UTC,"Because players who pay are naturally put at an advantage. This is especially true when you consider items that have very rare components. Buying platinum when you have a 75% discount can give you a lot of progress.  Yes, you can get pretty much everything for free, but the grind is still absolutely staggering. It's a huge time investment.  But like I said, it isn't really a problem when the game is centered around its PvE missions."
Warframe,3dx9ic,LoadingGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:31:04 2015 UTC,Allowing paying customers to get things faster doesn't make it pay to win. Having a platinum only weapon that does twice the damage without any drawbacks that would make it pay to win.
Warframe,3dx9ic,ajdeemo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:30:09 2015 UTC,"Allowing paying customers to get things faster doesn't make it pay to win.    When the grind is large enough, it does.   Suppose there was a game where if you paid you would get a well-rounded choice of items, spells, characters, what have you. Now imagine in that game that it would take 10 years for a semi-active player to reach that same capacity without paying, maybe 3 or 4 years at the fastest if that user played every day.  Would that game be pay to win? Of course it would. Although you can techinically earn it free, most people woulnd't be willing to spend such a large time sink on the game.  Now, that was an extreme example, and of course this game isn't as grindy. But I do think that Warframe does have such a large grind that it is pay to win.    Having a platinum only weapon that does twice the damage without any drawbacks that would make it pay to win.   By your own admission that wouldn't be pay to win, since you can still achieve platinum without paying."

What you said in your post, is how it makes money. But that doesn't make it pay to win. It would be pay to win, if say a non paying player could not get something a paying player does. But that is not the case, except for aesthetics but aesthetics don't give you an actual advantage over anyone else. Not to mention that Baro ki teer included some aesthetics as well.    Buying platinum when you have a 75% discount can give you a lot of progress.   I have recruited 13 friends so far and I have watched them progress through the game. What you are saying here, is indeed very true, once you get a few platinum, your progress rate is increased. But that doesn't meant that paying is mandatory to progress. One of the said friends I 've recruited has never paid a dime and he is Mastery Rank 18, has all the weapons that are available to the game, some with multiple formas ect. Btw he is not MR 19, because he doesn't like Archwing and has not progressed there at all.   TL;DR: My point here is that this model of free to play, is actually a healthy one. It doesn't give direct advantages to players who pay, but does actually help you progress faster."
Warframe,3dx9ic,ajdeemo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:21:54 2015 UTC,"WF is a free to play game, that needs to make money somehow.    You're correct, but there are free games out there which don't lock content behind enormous grinds. That being said, it doesn't particularly affect the game this much, as I explain in the bottom of this post.   I suppose our definitions of ""Pay-to-win"" are different.   Yes, they are. I consider it pay to win if a game gains a large enough grind so as to promote spending money as much as possible. By my definition, games can be free to play at some point and become pay to win later in their lives, depending on how much grind the developer adds with each patch.   Imagine a ""free to play"" game where if a player paid an amount of money equal to a typical new game release, that they would get a nice, well-rounded inventory of characters, weapons, spells, or what have you.  What if I told you that it would take an average player 10,000 hours of playtime to achieve the same amount of items? Even the most avid players would be hard-pressed to gain this content in 5 years. It would be extremely difficult to convince people that these items are worth grinding for. And if they have barely any improvement, then players won't want to buy them either. But if they're too good, then players might have trouble progressing without them at some point. The end of the line is that there is a point where a game becomes too grindy, even if it is free. If you can't see my point here, then you'll never understand my view.   Obviously this is an extreme example. Warframe does not have nearly this much grind. That being said, hopefully you see what I'm saying, although we might disagree on how much grind is too much.   But that doesn't meant that paying is mandatory to progress.    Of course. I never said otherwise.   TL;DR: My point here is that this model of free to play, is actually a healthy one. It doesn't give direct advantages to players who pay, but does actually help you progress faster.   Although I think the grind could be reduced, I don't think this is an especially bad model or anything. Like I said, the game is PvE, so pay to win is much less of an issue than it is in most other free to play games which are PvP focused. Sure, there's the conclave, but it isn't (and will probably never be) the main focus of the game."
Warframe,3dx9ic,AvenV,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:48:54 2015 UTC,"That being said, hopefully you see what I'm sayin.   Yes, I definitely see your point and I do agree the grind could be reduced, or if not reduced made so that it doesn't feel too repetitive.    although we might disagree on how much grind is too much   Perhaps this is why we our definitions are different. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that WF is perfect and that there is not too much grind or whatever. I just enjoy grinding and I do love the gameplay on WF. I assume that, this gives me an above the average tolerance on how much I can grind. Eventually, I too get bored, so I quit and only come back a few months later when I don't feel burnt out any more. This is the nature of this game and many other games out there. The point is to enjoy them and have as much fun as possible. Once you reach the point where enough is enough, you simply quit and find something else to do in your free time.   Although I have been through that circle many times and on many games, I always come back on WF and I can always enjoy it as much as the last time, no matter whether I pay or not. That is why I don't consider WF a pay to win game."

Warframe,3dqzea,Inuma,9,Sat Jul 18 18:17:04 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem...  This one doesn't do the Saryn motif well.  The hair would have done well in a cross braid which would have done well with her snake theme.  The dress should be black to instantly get people to think of the snakes that are some of the most dangerous such as the Black Mamba.  The nails should be longer to go with the cat/snake motif.  If the hair is to be perked up like cat ears, that may have been done better by hiding the ears into the hair and not having us see both and taking away the effect.  Further, we think of skin with Saryn because she molts.  This is why the original model gives her a sort of fur skin.  The setting here is very classy and having Saryn have a higher status symbol would have enhanced the picture greatly.  Hell, give her an actual snake in the picture which freaks out Mesa.  Unless that's her thing...  Can't complain about that.  It could have been better in a number of ways."

When I play as her, I find I do best with Infested so as to kill a number of them in one shot with a Miasma or two.  I don't find her to be good with ranged attacks, particularly when you have a poison skill that doesn't really one shot enemies.  That said, Trinity (just for comparison) is a beast with ranged and close enemies.  However if you're doing a lot of infested defense, Saryn will do better with her skill set than Trinity.  IMO."

Last but not least, she gets the Regenerative Molt augment that heals her when she casts Molt (which already draws some enemy fire away from her).  All in all, pretty tanky, great for melee and solo. Also, if you get her power strenght high, and power duration low, her Miasma absolutely deletes everything around you."

Or blue and gold, or some other vibrant colour that wouldn't look out of place on a high-ranking knight or nobleman.  Black and red is... kinda overused. It can work but people tend to throw on red highlights on a black base with no other colours or details which looks rather boring. Like at least throw some white in to contrast with the black, god damn."

Offered him food, a campfire to warm himself, and some basic survival supplies. I asked him, in the little Russian I knew, why Russians usually slaughter other players indiscriminately, but never seem to kill each other when they can avoid it. I tell him that unless they're unarmed, I've never met a friendly Russian.  He says to me, ""vse slavs robotaem vmeste; mj net robotaem Amerikanjets."" ""All slavs work together; we never work with Americans."" He then told me in broken English that I'm the first one who's ever been openly kind to him, and that the reason they're assholes to Americans is because that's usually what they get from Americans in return.

Warframe,3dssc3,-PM-ME-YOU-SMILING-,6,Mon Jul 20 02:24:57 2015 UTC,"I'm using the most possible duration, I put Continuity and Narrow Minded in, but I wouldn't really miss my Natural Talent mod either, it's kinda needed since he casts his abilities preeeety slowly.  He's awesome for solo and great for a semi-supportive role.  The problem is that a really minor part of the community likes Limbo actually, most of them find him useless and if you use him wrong (which is kind of easy until you get used to it) you will annoy the entire team and sabotage your own mission and that's bad.  However, if you make sure your team knows how his abilities work and so do you, he's really great in nearly any situations.  If you're playing defensively, casting Cataclysm on the cryopod will save it forever. Build for max duration (using the Cataclysm augment is also handy) and LOSE that range, which will actually help in defense missions (the lowest range is actually pretty large compared to other frames). Keep in mind that this is harder than just Frost casting a snow globe and protecting everyone inside. Paired with a Nyx, though can increase your teams potential and you won't have to be afraid of leaving the rift plane.  I don't really play him purely offensively, but his Banish/Cataclysm damage can be increased to a really high level and Rift Surge will be essential."
Warframe,3dssc3,at35z,9,Sun Jul 19 08:36:12 2015 UTC,"He's good at everything, granted you know how to use him.  He can solo even the hardest defense missions solo if you're up for it (i.e. Chroma's last quest mission)"

Warframe,3dssc3,_Eltanin_,7,Sun Jul 19 02:51:17 2015 UTC,"I have him set up like this:  Requires 2 Forma:     Energy Siphon      Transient Fortitude Streamline Constitution/Continuity Narrow Minded   Intensify Fleeting Expertise Natural Talent Quick Thinking    which puts him at:    Power Percentage    Duration 150-152%   Efficiency 175%   Range 34%   Strength 185%      Limbo is a caster frame who'll be using his skills a lot more often than most other frames because of how he works (or at least how I use him) so maximizing his efficiency (rank 4 Fleeting Expertise coupled with rank 4 Streamline) also maximizes his effectiveness in the battlefield. Increasing his Power Strength makes it so that any enemy that gets transported into the rift either dies immediately or gets low enough that a single strike or shot will finish them off. As for taking care of the much tankier enemies in higher levels such as bombards, the increased damage boost taken from Rift Torrent will take care of them easily.  Limbo's cast times especially for Cataclysm and Rift Walk are pretty long and so Natural Talent is there to help that.  Constitution and Continuity are interchangeable in that slot but I prefer Constitution for its knockdown recovery effect.  Narrow Minded decreases the range of Cataclysm and the cast range of Banish but that's perfectly fine for me since it actually helps in the way I play him. By decreasing the range of Cataclysm, you are decreasing the amount of enemies that can get into it meaning, it's a lot easier to isolate certain targets that you either want to kill or protect.  Because of the way the rift mechanics work, Quick Thinking is Limbo's best option for survivability as opposed to Vigor, Redirection or Vitality because of how easy he can recover his energy.  As for actually playing him, I play him more like a duelist, taking on enemies one by one, while always staying in the rift. The only time I exit out of the rift is to temporarily pick up items or hack certain terminals after making sure it's safe to do so. Because of the maximized efficiency, it's very possible to use banish over and over again per enemy in order to take them out without ever losing too much energy. Since Banish knocks enemies down when used on them, it's very easy to use a finisher attack while channeling with Life Strike to immediately get your life back in the case you need to.  I've tried using range builds with Limbo (i.e. Rift Arena builds) but because of the way I'm used to playing him and the fact that I don't use AOE weapons all that much, I've found it to be not as effective but it might be something that you'll want to look into."
Warframe,3dssc3,Rhynocobear,4,Sun Jul 19 03:54:15 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, i tried [really, really tried] the arena rift build, expecting rift surge to help alot. More often than not, it was a suicide sphere. best use i have found for it so far is to just target a group of enemies with cataclysm and send a torid shot in amongst them, but even then the extended range was unnecessary."

Limbo banishes excal and excal looses no energy but can still hit like a truck while both being completely invulnerable.

Warframe,3dssc3,SmileyyFML,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:37:01 2015 UTC,We usually run mesa on defence farms since you're not going anywhere anyways and peacemakers basically let you sleep since they autoaim for you.
Warframe,3dssc3,intensive_porpoises,2,Sun Jul 19 21:09:21 2015 UTC,"For solo runs, I can Riftwalk through the entire map without taking any damage or CC (although exceptions include things like Eximus abilities and Stalker). I can even do Spy missions and walk through laser detections without triggering an alarm.  For group play, the most basic, passive thing you can do is provide Rift to allies that rely solely on offensive abilities. You can also Riftwalk to safely revive a fallen ally, no matter how many enemies surround you.  For group support that is more mindful and aggressive, I usually bring a weapon that can do heavy damage in an instant (in my case, the Opticor), roam the map through Riftwalk, and single out high-priority targets (Heavy Gunners, Bombards, MOAs, Ancients, etc.) with Banish to take them out. This is especially effective because Limbo gets a damage buff specifically for killing anything in the Rift.  Cataclysm can be used in different ways since it affects a significant area. The most popular use is to provide a safe space for allies to gain energy and to avoid damage from outside (though they need to be mindful of any enemy that enters the bubble). You can also use it on a group of enemies so your allies won't take damage from whatever's inside (unless they are Banished, of course). Using it on enemies in this way isn't very helpful to your allies if the objective is to kill things, but if you believe your Limbo can handle it, he can kill things inside the bubble no matter where he is because of Riftwalk.  As for what he's bad at, Limbo can't handle large groups very well. Limbo's greatest strength is the fact that he's simply invulnerable to the vast majority of enemies pretty much all the time.. but if Limbo finds a big group of enemies, it becomes an awkward situation because he only really has 3 options:    Phase out of the Rift Banish the group (either with Cataclysm or individually with Banish) Let his allies deal with them   Limbo is vulnerable in the material plane, so phasing out to deal with a group of enemies will occur up until he's in danger, at which point you'll either Riftwalk again or get beaten down before you get the chance to.  Banishing a group is even more dangerous, because so long as you and all of those enemies are in the Rift, you'll be vulnerable to damage from all of those enemies. An added danger is the fact that your allies won't be able to attack those Banished enemies unless they themselves are also Banished.   Letting your friends do the work.. well.. It's the simplest thing to do, but you and your team have to be okay with you not contributing to DPS in this way (since your primary focus should be seeking out and focusing down high-priority enemies instead).   With that in mind, you should let your team know that you are playing Limbo ahead of time. It'll make everyone's mission easier if you take the time to clarify who needs Rift, when they need it, and more importantly, who does NOT need Rift (though you should also remind them that they can phase out of Rift by rolling). A Limbo that is poorly played or poorly understood is undeniably useless, annoying at the very least, and has the most potent risk of failing the mission.  That said, if you play him right, he's basically a best friend: he won't ever get hurt, he's obviously handsome, he's close by whenever a friend needs to get picked up, and he's always looking to push down a bully."
Warframe,3dssc3,RaptorPatrolCore,3,Sun Jul 19 04:21:48 2015 UTC,"Limbo is very combo and team oriented.  If you can, try using the Tonkor or any aoe weapon with Limbo. The burst damage with Tonkor is great and you can pop out of the rift instead of bringing enemies in the rift during low levels for kills. During higher levels, you can start bringing enemies into the rift instead to start dealing damage. I've found that Tonkor + rift torrent augment + Cataclysm means that you deal massive amounts of aoe damage and can basically lock down your own cataclysm area.  Also use mutation mods so you don't have to look for ammo while out of rift walk if using ammo inefficient weapons.  Penta grenades detonated will destroy enemies in the same plane they were launched from. So you can stack grenades in an area while in rift walk, use your rift surge, cataclysm and detonate both Penta and then Cataclysm. Problem is it takes a while to pull off the full combo if you haven't casted rift surge or rift walk already. Also, you might kill yourself with the Penta if you lose track of a grenade.  His high skill floor comes from requiring you to know rift mechanics and what your teammates are doing (aka need rift energy/not wanting to be trolled/bringing datamass or power cell). It's almost jarring to constantly think ""Hey, is this crewman in the rift? Am I in the rift too?"" in general gameplay but it's almost essential to master him. High power efficiency is almost required as you need to constantly cast your abilities and you should not be worried about running out of energy. Also use Carrier if you want resource pickups when you leave the rift.  Limbo is good at picking his own engagements in these missions:       Survival (reviving and damage at later levels) Defense (can protect the pod and team) Spy (Limbo walks through lasers) Assassination  Interception (just single target kill the guy at the console)   Limbo is kinda bad at:       Survival (can't pick up life support, but can active the life support pod in the rift) Defense If you're not using warframe powers to kill enemies Cataclysm can only protect the pod and not your teammates as they have to leave the rift to do damage. Enemies can also enter Cataclysm to do damage to teammates. Your Cataclysm has to run out before you can recast, and at high levels of T4D one/two bombard rockets and randoms firing is enough to destroy the defense objective within the two seconds it takes to recast Cataclysm without Natural Talent. Also, no pickups again :( any mission that requires a datamass. Mobile defense and excavation almost require you to leave the rift periodically and take potentially take damage. He's very squishy without the safety of the rift so you might want a different loadout for these missions.   For casual/PUG play: Pros:       You're an invincible magician with amazing damage potential At low levels instantly casting and detonating Limbo's Cataclysm is an ok nuke       Cons:       Limbo hate, people think you are trolling more often than not Randoms most likely don't know how to use the rift No pickups (aka no resource farm) in the rift Harder to play with others since you play on your own terms in the rift. You need to ask consent for everything if you don't want annoyed comments in chat   For focused team play: Pros: * free energy and invulnerability   safe reviving if there's no nullifiers, but sadly usually sentinels will die when reviving That's it, you pretty much can't offer more.   I really wish rift surge was an innate team bonus since Mirage now has Total Eclipse.      Cons:       Team comps have to be built around limbo Other players aren't used to the rift, don't know roll to get out of rift Requires slightly more coordination to pull off Cataclysm is a two way street You need to ask consent for everything if you don't want annoyed comments in chat   Special Notes:       Nyx Nyx using Absorb won't take damage (and won't increase Absorb damage), but enemy projectiles still hit Absorb. With enough range an Absorb Nyx in rift can protect a pod or excavator almost indefinitely. I don't know if she gains energy with max efficiency though. Almost every other warframe ability works normally in the rift but Nyx is different. There are probably others I don't know of as well. Lighting During infested missions, low lighting + rift walk means it's very, very hard to see. Haven augment You can crouch and look up to banish your sentinel to the rift and heal them. I use it during solo to make my carrier last longer. Also quickly banishing and unbanishing people to heal them might get you an annoyed comment in chat. You can cast rift walk in the air It's good for escaping damage with the enemy accuracy decrease and entering the rift is always nice. You can instantly leave rift walk to shoot at things, but can't rift walk back in to avoid being shot at. The animation is very flamboyant and takes a while.   Unknowns:   Rift walk and hive missions. I don't know if he's completely invulnerable to magnetic procs and toxin clouds but I'm pretty sure he's invulnerable to hive lasers. It would be nice if there was a list of channeled abilities and required stats for frames in the rift to start gaining energy."

This no loot mechanic that de likes throwing at absolutely everything is tiresome. Specifically states that while I'm in limbo my sentinel isn't affected, but my carrier can't pick up anything in the rift? Brutal.  This is the most loot based game I've ever played.    For me he's either very solo based or highly composition based.  Works fantastic with high ability use nuke or damage dealers.  Mitigates the effectiveness of all others while under his effects.  Got a saryn? Great.  Loki, he's screwed.  In solo, he's great with efficiency, and duration, just balance so you gain more than you spend in rift walk and you are golden.  Survivability to the end, just don't hope you'll take anything home with you."

So far I've only seen one limbo that did both a small area cat and used dark energy color as well.  Had another fun one where heavy hitters get banished and limbo would ignore them.

Warframe,3dsi8d,P34nU7,5,Sun Jul 19 04:45:36 2015 UTC,"So, like: Rank 3 Overload: Overloads Volt's systems, increasing the warframe's performance. 50 Energy & 5 Energy/sec (no damn duration limitation)      Removes Volt's Shield Recharge Delay and increases Volt's Shield Recharge Rate by Power Strength or Power Duration. Ex) Max Rank Redirection on Volt gives him 1110 shields for a Shield Recharge Rate if 70.5/sec. Ignoring Arcane Helmets, MAX power would be 200.22/sec, MAX duration would be 198.81/sec. Intensify+MaxTransFort (85%) would be 130.425/sec. Max Narrow Minded, Primed Continuity, and Fleeting Expertise (94%) would be 136.77/sec.  Acts as an additive bonus to Fast Deflection and Fortitude's effect.  Shock- Chains up to .6*Power Strength% additional enemies, increases chain length by 50%. - No change to PS, +3 Enemies hit. +100%PS, +6 Enemies hit. Speed- Passive bonus, Volt passively receives half of Speed's bonus while Overload is in effect. Active bonus, Teammates affected by Speed now receive a bonus towards Reload Speeds and no longer have Shield Recharge Delay or have their Recharge Delay decreased in the same matter as how Renewal's Duration is changed by Power Duration. Possibly also have it give a bonus equal to a max Rank Natural Talent, but that's a bonus that is now given by Accelerant, so possibly not. E: Also ideally give a bonus to recovery animation speed. Electric Shield- Increases Electric Damage Bonus by .5*Power Strength and allows for two Electric Shields to provide critical damage bonus to shots passing through them. - With no change to PS, +50%*(1+1*.5)=75% Electric Damage. +100% Power Strength, +50%*(1+2*.5)=+100% Electric Damage.  Overload's Augment would be to allow Volt's Shields to naturally gain Overshields at either the same rate he regens Shields or at half the rate he regens shields, not modifiable by stats (as his regen is already being modified)."

I'd prefer to change it from nuke to duration based ability with few passive atributes and buffs to other abilities.     Volt overchages his shields, gaining overshield based on power strength with doubled efficiency. All incoming damage to shields will be accumulated and converted into electric AoE pulse with stun. Frequency of pulses and damage depends on damage taken, while stun duration can be increased with duration mods. Shock now pulls affected enemies to initial target, stun duration is also increased. Speed now also increases reload speed and weapon swap speed. While sprinting, Volt will leave behind trail of ionized air, which will stunlock any enemy who passes through for all duration of Speed. Electric Shield becomes Electric Wall (a bit curve, higher, much wider) and now reflects projectiles back at the enemy with chance of electric proc, stuns enemies who passing through it.   Stuns, stuns, stuns."

I was thinking make him not even have to jump just cross his arms extend them BZZZZZZZ dead people.   Now as it extends every second or so have it pulsate the damage that it does now. So its both growing and doing damage at the same time. Would probably have to rename it to Static Storm or something. Finally have people inside have their damage increased the same way the electric shield does it.   making it like this would allow volt to be both a caster frame and still be able to use his shields and buffs constantly."

Just like how Rhinos Stomp has some CC with making the enemies float in air, but make volts be affected by duration making it more useful and not just a one time ability only using it once in a room.

Warframe,3dsi8d,Atulin,3,Sun Jul 19 02:34:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Overload needs much of a rework, but hell, why not give it a shot?  Overload creates a sphere, like Limbo's rift, but much shorter duration. Inside the sphere, every ally has increased speed (melee speed and reload speed included), and their weapons deal additional Electricity damage. Also their shields regenerate faster and with shorter delay.  Enemies get stunned upon entering or leaving the sphere, also their weapons have a chance to get overloaded and jammed for a while.  And here's the big thing: Inside the Overload Sphere, Volt can use any of his abilities for absolutely no energy cost. The Sphere itself, however, is expensive to cast, and has really high energy drain.  It would basically create a battlefield in which Volt and his allies have an edge over the enemies."

Make it tons of damage for burst, or have it do mini stuns every jump for utility. Would be like overloading the electrical parts of enemy bodies/armor/weaponry."
Warframe,3dsi8d,Draciusen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:20:09 2015 UTC,"Volt releases a burst of electricity around him like he does now, dealing damage with a guaranteed electric proc. Every [x] seconds (duration, high duration means higher delay) bolts of electricity (aka Shock casts) will bounce from enemy to enemy outwards from the initial cast location, inflicting damage and an electricity proc on all enemies. It prioritizes enemies further away from Volt and unaffected by electricity procs. This continues until it has bounced [x] amount of times, per bolt (power strength, more strength = more bounces/chaining). Each enemy hit during the initial burst creates a single bolt. Each electronic device overloaded within the initial cast will increase the number of bounces per bolt by 2 and increases damage by 100% for each device (so 3 devices = 300% damage increase and 6 extra bounces)   tl;dr - Volt's Overload shoots out Shock casts that chain to multiple enemies like dominoes. Cast it near a bunch of electronics and you have a tile stun/nuke."
Warframe,3dsi8d,BullenLearth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:34:44 2015 UTC,"Convert it to a buff where Volt releases an AoE Electric attack whenever they cast another ability and increases the Power Strength, Range, and Duration of those abilities. At max and without mods the range of the blasts could be about 10-15 Meters and deal 200 Electricity damage, duration could be about 12 seconds, and the boosts could be about +20% to Strength, Duration, and Range. Subject to Power Strength, Duration, and Range mods for the respective effects."

Warframe,3dsi8d,3lectronite,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:55:37 2015 UTC,"Yes the current Overload is stupid. My Idea is to change in to an energy drain ability (Like absorb on nyx). This gives Volt an AOE of 15m where he will periodically shock enemies inside(say 1 shock per 1.5s), this shock will chain to 5 enemies. However if he is close to an electronic device, this device will now also have this AOE ability with it's own radius of 15m as well. Volt will now tether to the device instead of destroying it(let's be honest destroying the lamps for a single usage was stupid) granting him increased power efficiency. So if you're in a room with lots of electronic devices you're in for a treat. Which was what was initially intended for Volt in the first place."
Warframe,3dsi8d,squidthesid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:52:27 2015 UTC,"How about making it a toggle and severely reducing the cast time?  For example,  Volt emits a wave every few seconds or so and gains passive buffs  while it is active?"

So as visual point, Volt drains power from lights around him until his ult's done, and after that those lights gain power and they'll be bright again.

Warframe,3dsi8d,UnrelatedComa,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:10:47 2015 UTC,"Controversial opinion incoming. Downvote now before it's too late!  I hate when people fantasize about changing abilities on the warframe forums. It's generally just to satisfy their own wants and an excuse to throw out outlandish ideas, as DE removed downvotes a long time ago. (What do you think that says about our community?) A total overload rework is not necessary, and here's why:   It deals minimal damage   True, the numbers are nothing amazing to look at - in the worse case it will do only 775 damage. However, have you taken the electricity proc in consideration? In case you're one of those who equip a maxed Narrow Minded outside of warframe, it deals half damage to all enemies in a small (5m?) radius. Two enemies next to each other will take 1162.5 damage each. Three enemies all next to each other (assuming they're all in range of each other) will take 1550 damage each... Do you see what I'm getting at here? With how Warframe creates difficulty through the use of mass spawning this ability can do massive damage. And I didn't even consider the initial burst / electronics.   Fire and Toxin does do more damage over time - but generally ""over time"" is not the way warframe players play. Frankly speaking, Electricity has the highest instantaneous damage potential of all damaging procs - and Overload takes advantage of that by locking enemies in place, so enemies clumped together will stay clumped together.   The stun is negligible   Are we talking about the same Overload here? It stuns enemies for the whole duration. Admittedly, being locked down when you have electronics is not the best of situations - but so will the enemies around you be perma-stunned. Still get shot at? Add stretch. Still get shot at? Why the hell are you getting casting it in a middle of a giant room when you know its cast time?  This is not all to say I'm averse to any and all Overload changes. Cast time ought to be reduced and electronics should regenerate. But saying it's useless as an excuse to spew random ideas is painfully wrong."

Warframe,3dsi8d,lightningleaf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:28:57 2015 UTC,"1) Even then we are talking IF the enemies are close enough to each other, those damage values are nothing! I mean 1000 electric damage is seriously nothing when we consider resistances. I tried going for overload volt and its way too weak.  2) the stun is negligible. They are not always stun for the whole duration ,I find it quite common for some to get hit but not get stunned and the stun is not very long to be considered.  I do agree with somethings you say though. Its just that I don't find overload complimenting his kit. Do you?"
Warframe,3dsi8d,lightningleaf,2,Sun Jul 19 03:17:49 2015 UTC,"Response to 1:  Resistances is not a legitimate argument. If you think Electricity is weak, ask DE to buff Electricity.  And IF the enemies are close to each other? As I said, Warframe relies on mass spawning to artificially increase difficulty. Ults are not always able to be used absolutely anywhere for 100% effect, and that's fine given how useful it can get.  And 2:  Yes, some animations break or ignore stuns/KDs. That undoubtedly should be fixed. Again, like the weakness of Electricity, that is not Overload's fault.    Does it compliment his kit... a high damage AoE is a pretty standard 4th. Excalibur's Jump was removed for good reason -  its lack of use in Parkour 2.0, and lack of use in Parkour 1.0, but Overload doesn't need such an overhaul.    I realize none of what I said is a fix for Overload, just why it doesn't need to be remade. Things I'd like to see:   Faster cast, both with electronics and in general, as well as electronics regenerating after a time, as I said before. Also stop banshee and other such Warframes from rendering those fixtures useless. Some kind of Electricity buff. A fleeting idea: Electricity arcs randomly during the duration of an Electricity debuff which stun and damage nearby enemies. Possibly increased range from what it is now. A more instantaneous effect. WTH is with the tiny AoE at the beginning?   e:typo"
Warframe,3dsi8d,Savletto,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:00:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late response. Just read your post. Anyways, yes I agree with what you said. Don't hate me though for posting this post but I don't think I am a dev but the reason why so many suggestions are put out is because warframe is said to be in beta (well last I heard) and is still quite early in its production. Its no where near a finished game if you think about it.  Resistances is quite a legitimate argument. If my skill is too low due to resistances why would I use it. Yes Electricity is weak but this is not the major reason why Volt's ultimate is weak. I played the game over 2 years and volt is my main frame. The issue is how much damage is really being dealt. 1000 damage is nothing compared to a gun who deals 10k damage. Volt is said to be an alternative to gunplay which he definitely isn't. Other warframes that deal the same amount of damage atleast has a good utility tool attached to it. The innate effect of electricity is simply not enough. An example is Ember or Frost. Ember has a knockdown attached to World on Fire and Frost's rework will even reduce armor (and if he kills the enemy deals even more damage).   It is overloads fault cause it had ONLY electricity and nothing else unlike other warframes skill making this skill subpar.  Although thank you for smacking me back into reality. I loved this game as I played it during my depressed times in High school, now going to my last year I just wanna see somethings improved that are still not fixed.  Thanks for the discussion.

That's why I added ideas for buffs on multiple fronts. I don't see why we're disagreeing on this point.   1000 damage is nothing compared to a gun who deals 10k damage.   Weapons will always do more damage than abilities at the end of the day.   Other warframes that deal the same amount of damage atleast has a good utility tool attached to it...  Ember has a knockdown attached to World on Fire and Frost's rework will even reduce armor...   ... and Volt has electronics. Now if only they could be more useful...

I agree with these two the most. I don't really find the area growing from volt to be much of a problem cause it grows fast enough. If anything maybe make the range larger or make it like Nova's ultimate that its a growing area. This would also be better for Duration based volts which is the most used setup there is.  Other two suggestions:   Overload affects robotics too.   I mean they are electronics and I don't get why they don't 'overload'. I mean think about it. This change would make Volt much more useful for the one reason that every faction has a robotic unit even the infested. Electronics are not found everywhere.   Increase the amount of pulses and tie it to either power strength or duration. Maybe each electronic device increases the pulse by 1.   More utility. This way a) the stun lasts longer and b) MORE DAMAGE xD This would make the skill a life saving skill. With enough electronics (especially in a corpus ship) it is possible to revive an ally."

It sounds very augment-y though (corpus robotics, at least already take additional damage) - I would focus more on buffing electronics.   Increase the amount of pulses and tie it to either power strength or duration. Maybe each electronic device increases the pulse by 1. More utility.   A long-lasting area-of-stun ult would be amazingly unique, and does indeed suit Volt. For a longer duration, however, the damage ought to be curbed somewhat."

The download servers for DE don't have as much bandwidth and/or likely under a bit of load so your download speeds will be much slower than steam which has a lot of bandwidth.
Warframe,3dw3yk,thatdovahkiinyouknow,2,Mon Jul 20 00:57:50 2015 UTC,"This is correct the updates are hosted on the DE Servers, vs the game itself which is hosted on steams servers.  They probably limit the updates to a small portion of the pipe or QOS(quality of service), since once the update is done you do not need that link as much as the connection to game server.  It is the same on X1, the large title updates come from MS and are done 1/4 of the time the very small update takes at the loading screen."

Warframe,3dtubw,Nik-kik,10,Sun Jul 19 12:08:30 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a Regenerative Miasma build for Saryn. Even with minimum duration she can regenerate just under 300 HP with her Regenerative Molt, and Rage will get back the energy. Here's the build  Note that this build would require two forma, but it leaves her default aura-polarity the same. With this setup, you can actually slot in Corrosive Projection or Energy Siphon when playing with a group, and still fit everything in. I have added a D polarity to accommodate a second defensive mod (in this case, my personal choice Steel Fiber) and a V polarity to accommodate Transient Fortitude. The last slow is your choice of Intensify for a stronger Miasma and more health back from Regenerative Molt, or Streamline for casting those abilities more often. It'll come down to personal preference, and I don't think you lose out too significantly with one choice or the other. [NOTE: This build can work with just one forma (adding the V polarity) if you use Rejuvenation as your aura, but this will preclude you from using Energy Siphon/Corrosive projection in a team setting.]  Alternatively, you can use a build that forgoes the second defensive mod to run both Intensify and a rank 2 Streamline. Said build requires only one forma (again, a V) to accommodate both Intensify and a rank 2 (do not go above this rank) Streamline. As the build shows, you can still run your choice of aura: Rejuvenation, Energy Siphon, or Corrosive Projection (the latter two for teamplay, but even a single Corrosive Projection will be helpful though pretty much unneeded with Miasma's massive corrosive damage, but you may still want in T3/T4 solo). [NOTE: This second build can be done without any forma, provided you use Streamline and Intensify instead of Steel Fiber and you use the matching-polarity Rejuvenation aura)"
Warframe,3dtubw,TheDarkstarChimaera,2,Sun Jul 19 12:18:37 2015 UTC,saryn's nuke build is pretty viable but that requires you to have corrupted mods.  Rhino would probably be a much easier frame to start some higher level missions.
Warframe,3dtubw,Irascibleness,2,Sun Jul 19 12:13:41 2015 UTC,"I seriously advice against using unranked mods, especially defensive mods like your steel fibre and vitality as they do nothing for your Saryn. You should prioritize acquiring Streamline and fleeting expertise."
Warframe,3dtubw,StickmanAdmin,2,Sun Jul 19 12:18:47 2015 UTC,"Saryn is very viable for high level solo missions because she has an above average armor rating in comparison to most warframes and she has innate skills that encourages meleeing.  As such, the Rage+Vitality+Steel Fiber along with a maxed Life Strike on the melee weapon is highly adviseable.  As for her skills itself, I've only had her for mastery and I've never bothered discovering what she can truly do so I'm afraid you'll have to ask other people"
Warframe,3dtubw,_Eltanin_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:24:42 2015 UTC,"So I guess from what everyone's saying I need to go hunting for some mods? I'm missing Rage, Streamline and Miasma, I believe I have a Stretch I could work on. I think I'm also missing Rage as well.   One of my biggest reasons for going with the Saryn was originally because I wanted a tanky Warframe, and she was up there. So I ended up going tanky with the mods. So I'm guessing that's taking away from her potential damage as well?"
Warframe,3dtubw,Namika,2,Sun Jul 19 17:02:54 2015 UTC,"Saryn is tanky because she has very high health and her Molt ability lets her regen her health if you have the Regenerative Molt mod for it.  What Saryn doesn't have is high shields. And since mods like Redirection boost your shields proportional to how strong they are at base, a mod like Redirection doesn't benefit Saryn as much. (Basically if you are on a frame with high base shields, like Mag, then Redirection will give you +600 shields at max rank. But on Saryn a max rank Redirection will only give you like +200 shields, which isn't worth the mod cost usually.)  So long story short. Take off the shield mods, focus on trying to rank up Vitality a fair bit, and look to buy or trade someone for the ""Regenerative Molt"" mod. Once you do those two things you will be walking around with >1000 hp, and by using Molt you'll heal like 800 health. It makes you very hard to kill."
Warframe,3dtubw,Sancticus,2,Sun Jul 19 18:21:19 2015 UTC,"I main Saryn and she is quite capable of dealing with most content in this game. She might not be the very best solo choice but don't let that deter you.  First off your Vitality is way too low. She has the highest base health of all warframes so you really need to take advantage of that and fit a max vitality if you can.  Continuity, Rush, Fast deflection and Steel fiber I would also get rid off.   Continuity because you will actually benefit more from less duration on Saryn.  Rush because you can copter and jump slide all over the place without the need for a mod slot for it.  Fast deflection because you can use Rage instead of both redirection and fast deflection to keep getting energy to spam your abilities. Also if you have to high shields it works against Rage as well.  Steel fiber is ok, but with the addition of Armored Agility you can actually get both speed and armor in one mod if you want to boost her armor.  Other mods I would use are:  Streamline to keep casting costs down  Fleeting expertice to keep casting cost down and duration low  Transient fortitude to get more strength for her Miasma and keep duration low  Intensify for more power strength   Stretch to reach further with your Miasma  So that would be a start and you could also look at this build:  http://warframe-builder.com/Warframes/Builder/Saryn/t_30_030004004_2-5-10-4-6-5-5-2-2-6-0-5-37-8-5-46-3-5-55-1-5-59-7-3-411-4-10_6-11-55-6-5-6-46-11-411-16-2-6-4-9-59-9-37-14_48/en/1-0-17/39432/0  As for most recommended warframe for high level solo missions.

I made a bit over 200p just on augments today (I think it may have been more because I think I sold a justice blades for 25p), just from selling them for 20p each, or 15p each if they buy 2 or more.  There is a lot of demand for augment mods if you pay attention to trade chat, put some time into advertising/offering, and try swapping regions every now and then.

If you know you are prone to disconnects and have no intention to stay and share your key if you get your desired part in the first run. Well then you simply do not join a keyshare group.
Warframe,3dqw78,Sancticus,2,Sat Jul 18 17:19:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  I think that your squad has a set item to look for, and if it is successful, then there's no reason to waste any more keys or time.  If you're looking for Mesa parts, for example, and you get all three parts in three runs, then the fourth one serves functionally no purpose other than credits.  At least in the past, if we found what we've been looking for then we are all content on disbanding the squad."
Warframe,3dqw78,3DPipes,2,Sat Jul 18 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"We need some kind of system that prevents people just leaving in a keyshare,    This was the OP's concern.   your squad has a set item to look for   The squad has a set system to keep their end of the bargin to host a key whether or not they obtain any desirable drops. That is the whole idea of keyshare."
Warframe,3dqw78,Sancticus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:34:22 2015 UTC,"No, I interpreted it as people leaving as soon as it comes to their turn without getting every drop.  OP says that he does not have Mesa yet, meaning that he has not gotten every single part.  It's just being wasteful to use more keys than parts you need.  There's no real reason to use that last key while it could be sold or given away to someone else.  Keyshare isn't about using four keys ALL the time.  It's about increasing your chances by up to four fold to get a part you want.  Once you have that part you want, then there's no reason to play the mission any longer.  If two people are looking for part A, and two for part B, and part A is found on the first playthrough, then there's no real incentive, other than common courtesy, for those two people to stay in the party.  You've got what you wanted, and if you leave, you lose a key, but that was given in the first place.  But now the squad has shrunk, so what is going to happen with the leftover keys/missions?  I would think establishing a given part to look for would make things smoother."
Warframe,3dqw78,3DPipes,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:20:05 2015 UTC,"key lost. will make oyu think twice to be on a stable connection.  sucks if the account servers or ISP fuck up, though, but eh.  rejoining a keyshare lobby has to be a thing, tho."
Warframe,3dqw78,Fubulicious,4,Sat Jul 18 16:50:15 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad idea, but I think they should put Mutated Salad V somewhere on the star chart instead. You can't trust random strangers to hold their part of the deal nor can you know for sure whether if someone left because they don't have a key or because their internet/game fucked up. I mean, sometimes after going back to my Liset I get kicked out of my party for no reason. I wouldn't be too happy if I lost a key because of that."
Warframe,3dqw78,lerobotsexy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"Hopefully DE will eventually get their collective head out of their ass and fix this like Vay Hek. There's no reason he should be key-gated, IMO. He literally BROADCASTED AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE ENTIRE ORIGIN SYSTEM about his new Mutalists. There's no way that large of a message can't be backtraced. The messages for invasions are different - they're to individuals, perhaps a proxy given to the faction being worked for (that is simple enough to be hijacked by the enemy faction in the event of sending a notification of death mark). That and the natural stealth functions of the Liset also would make it harder to trace. Whereas Alad V has no such functions and would more or less have a giant bullseye on his back.  As for Vay Hek, we probably heard him yelling all the way from Pluto and were able to locate him that way."

Warframe,3dqw78,TSP-FriendlyFire,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:42:30 2015 UTC,"But using 4 fragments is 4x less efficient then keysharing, which means you only use 1 fragment for the same amount of loot."

Ya know, Warframe issues.  Usually what you can do is just ignore the ones who have left, and just try again, just so you don't get matched up with them again.."
Warframe,3dqw78,Ricky301,2,Sat Jul 18 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"Have you tried doing a keycheck before the misssion? One at a time, each player selects the mission and the other 3 decline the vote on it so at least you have visual proof that everybody has the desired key. Players can still leave before using their key later on, but from what I've seen, players are much less likely to do so when they have a key to offer.  I don't think a system that forces players to do all 4 missions before getting rewards would be beneficial overall. This would unfairly penalize players who don't have very good internet connections. Between that and random game crashes/bugs, I can't think of a more fair option than players running a keycheck before missions. Sometimes you'll get burned in the current system, but I think it's better than implementing something that could screw over players who have the best of intentions."

That being said, I wouldn't give two fucks if they re-released Excal/Skana/(don't own Lato) prime, so long as the founder badges/logos were still exclusive. I DESPISE time-locked items in games, regardless of circumstance. It's by far my biggest pet-peeve around Warframe. All items should be obtainable as far as I'm concerned, PVE game or not.

I didn't know what I was doing most of the time and the game was really simple and the content was small. The game was still in its infancy and DE wanted to take it to new heights. In order to do that they needed money. Of course, with the playerbase it had at the time, I doubt their income from olat sales would have been enough.    So they opened up the founder's program. The money paid within thay program didn't just go towards getting the exclusives. It went toward insuring the future of the game. Excalibur, lato, and skana prime are just rewards for supporting the game in its infancy.  Now look at this game. over a dozen weapons of each type and 20 warframes from the starting, what, 8? Now we have how many different enemy types spread across 3 factions (4 if you count corrupted) we have sentinels and kubrows and archwings and 8 player raids.  The game might have never reached this state if it were not for the early funding."
Warframe,3dsz9h,Unimpressions,6,Sun Jul 19 04:42:09 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. The founders program wasn't cheap either, it ranged from $50 all the way too $100's if I remember correctly. I'm a founder and I still play. The game was very bareboned and didn't have much going for it yet we put faith and money and time into it. Excalibur Prime is a gift to show our faith. And in all honesty, he's not that much better then base Excalibur, so people shouldn't complain that he's exclusive."

Warframe,3dsz9h,roors99,9,Sun Jul 19 04:31:05 2015 UTC,"Ps4 and xbone have exclusive versions of Excalibur as well, I agree that it looks like a prime frame and that we were told we would get China exclusive items. I wouldn't be surprised of we didn't get this version of excal prime, and will wait till they confirm or deny it first."
Warframe,3dsz9h,Redan,4,Sun Jul 19 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"PS4 and Xbone have Excal SKINS, while China!Excal Prime is a remodel.  Even if just as a skin for normal Excalibur, we'll be getting it."

Warframe,3dsz9h,ScarletMomiji,10,Sun Jul 19 04:55:23 2015 UTC,"Letter13, the official forum mod?   All forum mods are volunteers, and aren't affilieated with DE in any way. As such, they don't get any more information than the normal playerbase.  Continue to listen to Rebecca."
Warframe,3dsz9h,roors99,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:01:29 2015 UTC,I just assumed that DE sold their publishing rights for China. That means the publisher can do whatever.  Still waiting for an official statement from DE though.
Warframe,3dsz9h,YattyYatta,5,Sun Jul 19 06:56:15 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind if Excalibur prime was available again. More money for DE to make/speed up new content isn't so bad.
Warframe,3dsz9h,hoonani,4,Sun Jul 19 09:01:30 2015 UTC,The founders program is a loyalty reward in advance for investing in a barely-alpha product and nothing more. Chinese warframe is of shaky quality from those trailers and that's mostly a separate development team anyways a la TERA  Can we stop talking about this now?
Warframe,3dsz9h,The_M4G,11,Sun Jul 19 15:50:41 2015 UTC,"I like this (probably unpopular) way of thinking, and i fully agree.   I have met quite a few MR 19 players who are stuck-up dumbasses, and i have met quite a few founders who feel entitled because they found a game that they had interest in before anyone else had a chance to know of warframes' existence."
Warframe,3dsz9h,crashingtingler,4,Sun Jul 19 04:15:49 2015 UTC,"It's more than that. We as founders paid anywhere from 50$ to 250$ for a game that was less than 1/4 what it is now. we spent a lot of money to see this game come up to where it is now, with nothing more than a promise. It's NOT just that we knew about it (that's where Braton Vandal and Lato Vandal come in), it's that we were willing to take a leap of faith for an untested idea for a brand new IP in a market that either recycles everything or makes a new IP ever few seconds. It was a show of faith and this is our reward, to be rewarded with exclusives.   To give out Excal Prime in any way without also giving us the Founders something substantial as promised, would be a massively bad move, for PR if nothing else."
Warframe,3dsz9h,theammostore,2,Sun Jul 19 05:58:07 2015 UTC,"I've always felt that they should make or have made Excalibur prime Kati and slabs prime all recruiting rewards. I've played the game since the closed beta but didn't have the spare cash to spend at the time on the founders pack, but I did and still do get every gamer I know to try out warframe. So how bout instead of another shred mod at 30 recruits I get the Excalibur prime I've been longing for since the beginning."

Warframe,3dsz9h,wo1verin3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:16:22 2015 UTC,"My gripe about the whole thing is that the Founder items are, essentially, PC exclusive since the program ended before the PS4 and XB ONE were even out. Why isn't there a console exclusive Prime frame?"
Warframe,3dsz9h,Yuuryko,4,Sun Jul 19 08:46:01 2015 UTC,Dont the consoles have exclusive skins or something? I think the jade excal skin is pretty cool.
Warframe,3dsz9h,die9991,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:24:37 2015 UTC,"Skins, yes. I'm talking about whole weapons and frames though, mastery points that console players can never get."
Warframe,3dsz9h,Yuuryko,2,Sun Jul 19 21:37:26 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of players have to deal with mastery points that we can't get. Don't see why console players are so special that they should get primed equipment that no one else does.  This community would riot if, for example, Trinity Prime was exclusive to either console or to both.  Not trying to rag on you, I just hate the exclusive content crap that is so pervasive in gaming. Taking away the primed version of someone's favorite frame is not only something I see as unfair, but honestly it's just bad business to lose part of your playerbase over something so outrageously petty as platform exclusive content."

I understand that they have exclusive skins, but skins are purely cosmetic, Excal Prime and Lato Prime are functional."
Warframe,3dsz9h,Yuuryko,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:29:16 2015 UTC,"It's not ""pure luck"" that people get in on early things like beta and Founder's packs.

Warframe,3dsz9h,cephalopodAscendant,2,Sun Jul 19 05:14:30 2015 UTC,"Let's make it clear:  •Founders paid real money to support an idea. You did not. •Founders contributed to the development of the game via closed beta. You did not. •Founders were promised these unique rewards, which they paid MORE than what you pay for now, if you even buy the platinum to begin with.  If you want those items, find a founder and buy their account. Otherwise if these are ever released, DE goes back on their guarantee and will have to reimburse their investment, or more.  It is irrelevant what the few people like you feel about this. Better spend your time looking for new gems and funding them, hoping it turns out like WarFrame.  Oh yeah, how many times were these Founders burned by other game promises? Yeah you want it free and easy, don't ya?  BTW I'm not a Founder. I wish I was.

Warframe,3dsz9h,MagosSloth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:30:15 2015 UTC,"Tough luck. Excalibur Prime is an exclusive to those who were founders. It was advertised to be never released again outside of the founders. If they release it in anyway, they're gonna be open to false advertising suits."

Warframe,3dsz9h,UnrelatedComa,0,Sun Jul 19 05:21:57 2015 UTC,I assumed people had read the initial comment and was pointing out the hypocritical reasoning in what I felt was a rather mild way (to all but the most jaded of personalities I suppose). Thanks for the unnecessarily aggressive comment though.
Warframe,3dsz9h,PillarOfIce,0,Sun Jul 19 05:50:56 2015 UTC,"There's no hypocrisy in his question. The entire point of the post, within context, is asking why doesn't he deserve the chance to acquire something that he never had the opportunity to get. He's not being entitled by wanting equal chance to participate."
Warframe,3dsz9h,UnrelatedComa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:58:26 2015 UTC,"But it's not equal. It would be equal if it was a new, relatively unknown product with very minimal development work on the upgrade system and a risk that, if it doesn't become popular enough to be profitable, development will cease. This is essentially why 'founders', kickstarters etc are rewarded, because they take on a portion of risk that is less apparent in the developed product.   One of the major points of contention here (in my opinion) is the weight applied to the time dependency of these opportunities. There are plenty of people who would be in better circumstances if they had made (or known about) a decision they could have made at a certain point in time. However, hindsight is 20/20 and calling something 'unfair' because they were unaware or unwilling to take on a risk in the past that they now know would have worked out in their favour while judging people as purely lucky for choosing to spend a relatively significant amount (given the product) with an inherent risk at an opportune point in the past, is entitled."
Warframe,3dsz9h,PillarOfIce,3,Sun Jul 19 06:27:44 2015 UTC,"All a moot point because it's not hindsight, it's not entitled, it's not opportunity - there were no founders packs on console. The opportunity was never there. Console players never had the chance to get Excalibur Prime."
Warframe,3dsz9h,UnrelatedComa,2,Sun Jul 19 06:35:28 2015 UTC,"The opportunity wasn't there because the risk wasn't there. The people who were in a position to undertake the risk got the opportunity. I don't own any of the founders stuff but I don't see why I should receive something that was given out to the people who took the risk, nor do I begrudge them as 'lucky', I'm just pleased they were able to support the game in its formative stages so that I can enjoy it now."
Warframe,3dsz9h,PillarOfIce,0,Sun Jul 19 07:06:09 2015 UTC,"The ""risk"" or any extenuating circumstances are irrelevant. The entire point is the chance to participate. Console didn't have the chance to participate and the OP is expressing discontent at the lack of choice. He's not debating the gravity of undoing any promises that were made at the time the original founders packs were purchased. He wants equal opportunity to spend real money to acquire something.  I personally don't care but the console players that take issue with the whole founders pack thing have reasonable grounds for their concerns. They aren't crazy people because they want at bare minimum equal access to in game content. An entire Warframe has been restricted and a segment of the user base doesn't feel that platform exclusive skin packs are viable recompense."
Warframe,3dsz9h,UnrelatedComa,3,Sun Jul 19 07:22:06 2015 UTC,"The ""risk"" or any extenuating circumstances are irrelevant.   I strongly disagree, and so do many of the founders, people who have taken part in any form of kickstarter or startup venture, and DE.  'Chance to participate', new players also didn't have the chance to participate, by this reasoning they should also have the opportunity (and screw the people who bought the pack). Where is the line drawn? I didn't win the 1955 state lottery because I wasn't alive, why shouldn't I have a chance to participate, where's my ticket? I was never given the opportunity to buy stocks in Microsoft when it started up, where's my share?  It's not equal access, they're asking for something without the expenditure that the original founders had in terms of risk and opportunity.   An entire warframe has been restricted   I can't disagree with you there, if only DE introduced a frame with the same powers and name that was also free to acquire... oh well."
Warframe,3dsz9h,PillarOfIce,-1,Sun Jul 19 07:32:11 2015 UTC,Seriously? You're going to be deliberately pedantic to drive your facile argument home instead of simply accepting that the other side of the coin has merit? What a waste of time.

Warframe,3dsz9h,Tosick,0,Sun Jul 19 04:30:18 2015 UTC,"While I'm fine with the founder stuff staying locked up, I'm somewhat nitpicking with disliking that Lato and Braton Vandals are still locked up. They weren't even special, it was just for sale for 1 credit during a specific part of the beta. I'm actually more fond of Wraith than Vandal but would definitely like a shot at the Braton and Lato Vandals as I do enjoy Braton Prime a lot. I understand the founder exclusive stuff but I don't see a reason the two Vandals can't be rotated back in at some point."
Warframe,3dsz9h,UnrelatedComa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:18:23 2015 UTC,"Lato Vandal is the thank you note to the closed beta players. Even if these players didn't pay to support the game at that time, they were still quite instrumental in ensuring the success of it later on. A game without sufficient players doesn't really go anywhere.   Braton Vandal is a celebration item for the launch of open beta, and sold for that occasion only. It is commemorative of the early days, and I suppose it is not being released again due to this reason.    But both are really nothing special gameplay wise. And it's only 6000 mastery total, barely a dent in how much can be obtained in total now."
Warframe,3dsz9h,Mistywing,0,Sun Jul 19 08:27:29 2015 UTC,"That's even more flimsy than a lot of people feel about the founders pack primes. At least there's a monetary obligation they can point to with the founder primes, even though it's subject to the luck and timing that OP brought up. With the Vandals for the beta there's nothing but coincidence of time played. And again it falls under the closed/open beta time prior to consoles which denies two out of three platforms the opportunity to have the weapons.  The love note to beta players isn't really a driving reason to keep those weapons vaulted. They were essentially free, the MR players lose by not having them isn't for someone else to conclude how bothered by it that person is, nor is it someone else's place to decide whether or not the game play they provide is superfluous. There's no good reason to keep the Vandals in the vault and it wouldn't be the least bit detrimental to cycle them through availability at some point."

Warframe,3dtaj8,Acheron-X,6,Sun Jul 19 06:23:29 2015 UTC,The boltor will get you through alot  The bolto and ak bolto will help as a secondary   Melee wise... Whatever you want   Regarding really good weapons   Strive for the   Marelock  Dread Soma prime Syndicate weapons  Any prisma or mara weapons you can get from baro ki teer  Bare in mind these won't be easy to get but they will be endgame material in most cases
Warframe,3dtaj8,HollowExistence,4,Sun Jul 19 08:04:51 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the game! The karak is an amazing choice for clearing the star map, it has good all around stats for a quickly available weapon and is the rifle I used consistently when I started playing. If you're down to start running void missions, the Boltor prime is one of the best rifles in the game and is fairly easy to obtain. If you don't want to start just yet, the normal boltor is a good option. As for your secondary, you can't go wrong with the Marelok, one of the strongest sidearms in the game with a sweet gunslinger/revolver feel to it. It's important to note that there is a better version: the Vaykor Marelok, a syndicate weapon(kinda like a prime version) so you might not want to dump forma into the normal marelok too early. Other options include the atomos(a top-tier weapon for endless missions/clearing huge mobs), lex, akmagnus, aksomati among others. IIRC, the atomos also benefits from volt's electric shield. For melee, the Dragon nikana is an amazing weapon but is not available until you are Mastery Rank 8, and Dakra Prime is currently removed from the game but you might be able to get it through trading plat. Galatine might be your best bet at the moment. As a closing note, I wouldn't worry too much about what is 'best' in terms of weaponry. When I first started, I took my time learning about the game, trying out a ton of different weapons and figuring out what I liked. There will be plenty of opportunity for min maxing in the future, I guarantee it!"
Warframe,3dtaj8,kangster0297,5,Sun Jul 19 07:11:17 2015 UTC,"I don't use the sybaris personally, but I hear it's a fantastic weapon, with oodles of crit, but it does have a small-ish clip size. If you really love volt, start saving up materials for the amprex, it goes so well with him.  I DO use the marelok personally, and I can say it's fantastic. I actually rarely whip it out nowadays because I find it to be too good. The hikou prime are pretty easy to farm up, fun to use, and a breeze to mod with the two V polarities.  I have slaughtered tens of thousands with the galatine, and I can attest to it being one of the best melee weapons in the game. With the removal of coptering, this weapon will see even more use. Despite its 10% critical chance, a true steel-beserker build is viable on it and with cleaving whirlwind, you WILL feel like a freaking hurricane. With tempo royale, you are a frenzied ballerina of death.  Other great melees to consider are The Bo prime, which is now pretty easy to get and will hit hard. There's also the ever-so-popular OP tipedo, and The dual ichors/Dual cleavers will also blend everything. I wouldn't go for the dakra prime first, as it isn't in the drop tables, will cost a sizeable amount of platinum to buy, and needs 15 orokin cells, which may be tedious to cough up."
Warframe,3dtaj8,Hamster5,3,Sun Jul 19 07:12:09 2015 UTC,"For primary one: I would say you should get a Braton, That gun is doing well in mid-game.  Secondary: If you had chosen Lato, Build something else like Boltor, Vasto, and anything else is going to be fine.  Melee: Dragon Nikana and Dakra Prime is a very great choice, but: * Dragon Nikana requires Nikana and MR8 rank which you aren't going to get it soon. * Dakra Prime had recently moved out from the drop table, Unless you are willing to spend a lot of money to trading with someone else, You aren't going to get it by any chance unless DE open its ""Vault"" again.  Just try something you find it interesting, It gonna be fun.  More general tip:   Mod is more important than weapon, When properly modded, Even MK1-Braton are going to kickass in late-game. Melee aren't that great in late-game because level scaling in this game make enemy very tanky and high damage.   And lastly, Read the wiki about Damage 2.0, And Modding, This is very important thing in Warframe, Also find a clan to join, Many awesome weapon (Jat Kittag and Nikana) and 3 Warframe require Clan research to get it."

Warframe,3dtaj8,Chaito,2,Sun Jul 19 13:46:28 2015 UTC,"For primary, Boltor or if you're accurate enough the Latron. Once you've built up a good mod collection then I'd also suggest the Paris, but before using a bow you'll want a decent speed trigger and damage mods to be able to 1 shot most of what you're fighting. All of those will take down any faction, but the play style is very different.  For the secondary, With Boltor or Paris, a Lato; or with Latron or Paris, a gammacor.  If you like to play in close and melee a lot, then Boltor/Gammacor is a good combo. Lato is not great when mixing it up in close quarters, neither is the latron. Bows are actually great close up once you've got the hang of them. However, you should have at least something with good range, with volts' shield and projectile buff through it he's pretty effective at range.  For Melee, slow and heavy, then the Galantine, personally it's too slow for my taste, but maybe I'll revisit it with volt. So I prefer the Orthos for a good balance of speed, range and power. I don't get on with the daggers so can't comment there."
Warframe,3dtaj8,AmGeraffeAMA,2,Sun Jul 19 19:28:18 2015 UTC,"The karak and marelok are very good choices for guns, particularly the marelok.  You won't be able to use the dragon nikana for a while - some weapons have a mastery rank requirement, and this one requires mastery rank 8, dakra prime requires mastery rank 6. Check mastery rank requirements before you get something. I bought the blueprints for the dual ichors but couldn't actually use them for weeks. I believe you should have access to the dual zorens - they're pretty good."

EVERY weapon can be modded and fiddled to the point where it will hold up for 40 minutes in T4S(Well, with 4 corrosive projections). A well-modded Oberon and Attica will have little problems doing anything. That being said, try out all the new stuff first, you may find a new favorite item. Before I fell in love with my awesome anthropomorphic deer, I thought nothing could come between me and my frost. Oberon love aside, it's also good idea to get some frames used in the raid first, like mirage and loki."
Warframe,3dt7ci,Hamster5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:09:52 2015 UTC,"What are the frames that hold up in raids?

Warframe,3dt7ci,Hamster5,2,Sun Jul 19 06:17:58 2015 UTC,"Mirage, EV trin and loki are the most important. Vauban and Nova are also valuable.

Also, for Oberon: Get rage. Get it as fast as you freaking can."
Warframe,3dt7ci,Redan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:20:29 2015 UTC,"I think that as a new player, a solid but not top tier warframe is fine. You never ""need"" to go beyond the reset point of endless mission rewards, and saying that, Oberon has a decent 4th skill for quick map completion and his mod set if you chose to build around using him synergizes well with a saryn 4 skill build if you choose to go that direction.  I would venture to say that in groups vs high level enemies, using a max efficiency Oberon ult would even be beneficial as a form of crowd control. The warframes used in high level, high duration void missions aren't used because they're all around superior, but because they synergize well with the stationary, loot focused playstyle they use.  So I would say stick with Oberon and feel free to work towards making 2-3 skillbuilds on it if you like it. But if you decide you want to do missions he can't (efficiently) do, then build the warframe you want for those missions before you actually need it so you're not waiting.  As for weapons, I recommend finding a good weapon with the firing and damage type, and using that when you need to, but otherwise focus on leveling and crafting what weapons you can, while still making sure you have the stats and damage to complete levels."
Warframe,3dt7ci,Redan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:14:09 2015 UTC,"As far as frames that I really like, it's Oberon and Hydroid, but I'm not super sure which frames are more efficient. I've been interested in Nekros, Rhino P, and possibly Trinity, but I don't have much for any of those frames apart from Rhino P parts.  Also, any weapon recommendations? I think my better weapons atm are probably Paris Prime, Lex Prime, and a few other standard weapons at 30"
Warframe,3dt7ci,Redan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:24:59 2015 UTC,"Bows are nice when you're starting because they can one shot enemies without too many mods. But later they can easily become overkill.  From that list I would recommend rhino p for normal map completion and difficult missions done solo.  His shields regen even while ironskin takes damage. Trinity due to the fact that mags build where she pulls loot onto everyone has been rendered obsolete, leaving Trinity to give energy, and lastly nekros if you want a warframe who while not necessarily desired for his damage, is desired in groups for the additional loot he provides in groups. Hydroids most popular purpose at the moment is similar, with pilfering swarm he gives more loot, but to my knowledge he isn't as popular.  Really, the benefits of long lasting farming missions done this way just barely outweighs how boring it is, Oberon really isn't bad, and if you're going to get him a transient fortitude, stretch, and fleeting expertise for an aoe spamming build, those mods will be useful on other warframes too.  Edit, primary prime weapons are really good, the latron, burston, and boltor, and I believe they lack level requirements."
Warframe,3dt7ci,Kinzuko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:34:04 2015 UTC,"I haven't run into too many troubles with Oberon, and I've got a lower level version of that build going at the moment with a maxed Efficiency and Flow for the CC that spamming Reckoning offers.  I'm working on collecting stuff to be able to afford the higher tier mods, maybe primed stuff if I end up with another endless font of Paris Prime Lower Limbs for ducats.   As far as other frames, I'm open to suggestions, I just really enjoy the supportive/tanky roles. Someone suggested Mirage, and above all, she at least seems easy to build.  When it comes to weapons, I could start saving/building a boltor prime or something, I just find those weapons sort of boring. I like the ones that have a bit of a caveat to it, things like the Vectis, Attica, bows, etc."
Warframe,3dt7ci,Kinzuko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:44:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with a few exceptions, using the right mods on a efficiency damage range build, you'll never really have trouble doing things as Oberon.   Amprex is a really solid primary that is somewhat unique. Requires a lot of mods and forma to make it good and idk what its level requirement is.  Phage was one of my favorites for the longest time. It does viral damage and shoots a beam that you can hold aim to make more precise. I find it works very well at just channeling straight into high health enemies who won't die to Oberon's 4th skill. It uses shotgun mods so you don't need to get a rank 10 heavy caliber and serration, the the shotgun spread mod and the damage and speed mods are all 5 ranks or less, so its easy to level.  Beyond that I'm not sure, Paris prime as I said is fine, a bit overkill but if you're going to kill weak enemies with reckoning then you're fine."

Warframe,3dunok,justsomeS1,3,Sun Jul 19 17:30:28 2015 UTC,"Punch-through can be useful on chain beams (eg. amprex & atomos) b/c the main beam will chain off the first target and, if there are more targets bh the first, also initiate chains off of any targets hit by the main beam. This can lead to a significant output increase if you hit multiple enemies in a line.  The reason why I don't really recommend that on general builds is b/c it requires you to sacrifice mod space that could be used for a more general flat dmg increase. The amprex especially has very limited mod space since it has so many required base mods.  The range extension, however, is useful enough to justify slotting on both the amprex and atomos."
Warframe,3dunok,Tels315,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:43:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion! It seems like punch through build is only ideal for infested I guess?
Warframe,3dunok,Trrex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:50:51 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, punch through is recommended for any game type that has enemies coming at you in lines or waves. So, most Defense, Survival and Mobile Defense (depending on the map). It also depends, a lot, on the level range you're playing to. For most of T1 and T2, you can easily get away with out using punch through (unless you're going for 60 min/wave missions), and in T3, you can do it as long as you've got some good damage boosts (Nova, Rhino, Total Eclipse Mirage etc); T4, however, you should really consider getting punch through. Especially because it not only increases mob damage as a whole (dealing damage to more targets) but it also increases your proc chance.  For example, if you were to build a pure CC Amprex, you might consider leaving it on electricity only, and building for as much punch through as possible to affect huge crowds of enemies. Or build for Radiation and cause lots of chaos in the enemy ranks (especially against the Healers).  Your best bet is to try for 2 separate load outs, one for damage, one for CC. Some load outs are better for certain kinds of frames. For example, you don't really need lots of CC on a Loki or Vauban, so you should bring as much damage as possible for them, but at the same time, you want to bring lots of utility on a Trinity as she doesn't have any sort of AoE CC."
Warframe,3du8tw,EenEchteCorpsbal,5,Sun Jul 19 15:05:05 2015 UTC,"compared to other games, Warframe has actually not all that much in terms of skins Considering how any 'class' can wield any weapon, any class can do the 'most dps' A lot of the fun obtained in warframe is in the crafting and trying out all the different frames and weapons the game has to offer. As for the actual end-game, there's high level missions and raids but they're not really all that different from the normal missions that you do, just with higher level enemies. The raids has some unique mechanics that requires a lot of cooperation so that's at the moment, the only true end-game content that can be considered.   Lastly, stop looking at this game expecting an MMO experience because you are looking the wrong way.   The fun is in the journey, not the destination. You will obtain no fun if all you're looking forward to is power leveling your way into the end game and missing out on what the game has to offer. As mentioned previously, a lot of the fun of the game is in trying out all the different weapons and frames (because a lot of them have different and unique mechanics) that you can craft, finding the ones you like the most and mastering them."

Warframe,3dsby9,InqusitiveLemming,14,Sat Jul 18 23:59:57 2015 UTC,"My advice, forget about formas for frames. At this point you should have enough point with a potato and matching polarity auras. Forma them when you're richer.  So that means forma primaries. Which primaries? As you didn't mention what primaries you use or like I can only give generic advice.   If the weapon has a prime variant, forma only the prime.  You don't want to waste forma on sub-par weapons when you're not literally rolling in a pool of formas. Subpar weapons take 6-8 formas to even compare with good endgme weapons.   Always forma polarities that match mods you WILL ALWAYS use no matter what, I.e Serration, Split Chamber. If crit builds then point strick and vital sense. So a lot of V polarities. If elemental builds 2 dash polarities will suffice. Too many dash will mean you can't swap builds."
Warframe,3dsby9,3lectronite,0,Sun Jul 19 00:36:44 2015 UTC,"And once you're actually rich enough to Forma Warframes (AFTER you've Forma-ed your chosen weapon armory, never during or before), Forma the Aura slot first with a polarity that you'd like, then add two more of the other polarities of auras you may think you'll need in the slots.  Why? You can move Forma-ed slots, including the Aura slot if Forma-ed.   Think about it, this allows you to switch out the aura polarity to suit the aura you may need on a certain mission at any time."

For weapons you do not have to have a wide variety (mods account for most of the damage, better to focus on getting those mods up in rank).  You can have a solid primary rifle (like the Soma), a solid secondary (one of the syndicate secondaries for example), and a melee weapon that feels right to you.  Some frames that I feel help prepare a player for a wide variety of tasks are:  1) Nova: Her ult is useful in a wide variety of situations. Defense/Mobile Defense/Interceptions  2) Loki: With his invis he makes Deceptions,Captures, and Sabotages a breeze. And we know max range Loki is very useful in late game missions  3) Nyx: Chaos can help hold enemies off at bay. Absorb can be a good defensive tool as well.  4) Nekros: Your easiest frame for farming.  5) Trinity: Healer,energy replenisher and great solo frame too. A key component of many high end missions.

The ignis is probably the lowest damage primary in the game after damage 2.0, even though it's a flamethrower.  The supra just has too many problems to count. Slow projectile speed, ungodly reload times(because it needs 4 seconds when the soma prime is only 3 seconds with twice the magazine size, right?), and insane spread with heavy caliber. Not to mention the syndicate mod is literally broken as it states it adds base status chance which the event status mods do not factor in.

Warframe,3ds2hu,Kaliphear,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:07:03 2015 UTC,"Embolist   I think it is ok with the Ruinous Extension mod, a bit of a different beast from you usual secondaries. The only thing I'd improve on it would be ammo economy, which is terrible (also the augment mod isn't that great). Stat to buildcost ratio is out of balance though.   Ignis   Yeah, more damage   Supra   Give the bolts punchthrough, reduce the reload time, narrow the spread a tiny bit and it is an ok weapon, not worth its buildcost, but ok.   Dera   Give the bolts punchthrough, make them not be effected by heavy caliber and it is an ok weapon, still not worth the buildcosts though.   Tetra   Has a place as a beginners weapon.   Daikyu   Is fine in my opinion.   Simulor   Make it Firestorm compatible and it is an ok weapon. (EDIT: I think it is ok already, but that mod would make it more wieldy.)   Whips   Yeah... not a fan of the stances / animations of them. They are fine when one is static in a crowd of enemies but that simply is not how Warframe works.  EDIT: Appart from the Tetra and the Daikyu I have max formaed all of those weapons (the Atterax represents the whips), just as a disclaimer. I'll max forma Daikyu as well in due time."
Warframe,3ds2hu,ThePlanckEpoch,3,Sun Jul 19 07:16:15 2015 UTC,"I really could not find a reason to keep the Daikyu.  What's the point of a status weapon that has such an obnoxiously slow fire rate, unless you waste all your slots on modding for fire-rate (which the damage isn't good enough to do that IMO). The fact that you are committed to fire an arrow every time you click shoot is another massive down-side for me, and you can't hold your shots for more than a few seconds makes it frustrating for stealth if you can't go invisible.  I just don't see the point in it. I honestly think I had more fun using the Mk-1 Paris than I did the Daikyu."

Warframe,3ds2hu,Faceluck,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:05:36 2015 UTC,"Before damage 2.0, the choice between ichors and fang prime was a pretty legit debate. IIRC fang prime innately pierced armor, allowing them to do a ton of damage as well as not being required to use an armor piercing mod. This allowed them to be far superior at destroying grineer. Hitting multiple times per swing was also a huge boon as well.  Sadly damage 2.0 has left a lot of previously great weapons in the dust, and most still haven't had a once-over since then."

Make it so they have a bit more puncture then they already do to make it more viable as a lategame weapon. Also buff their base damage from 35 to 40. Adding that new loka aug will really make it good.   Buff their attack speed from .8333 to 1.0 at least.   Kunai/Hikou P. 1. Again buff their base damage respectively from hikou p: 32-35. . How is this a space ninja game, when most of the ""ninja"" weapons arent actually that good towards the end game. Its not really a ninja game when most people go in with their soma p/boltor p guns blazing.   Since the hikou p have very good status chance if modded correctly at least boost the kunai's crit chance from 2.5% to 20%. Ik its a lot but it gives you bonus for actually trying to sneak around the enemy and rewards you for landing those shots with a thrown weapon that has a very limited magazine size. Yes, these two weapons are both some of my favorite weapons in game. I tend to use kunai more than hikou p because ammo efficiency of the kunai>ammo efficiency of the hikou p"
Warframe,3ds2hu,drew967,5,Sat Jul 18 22:47:20 2015 UTC,Prisma Skana is already quite OP with the Loka aug - I use it quite happily in T4 with a beserker build (so the attack speed isn't an issue). I tend to go melee only in most non-def missions and it works very nicely.  Hikou: agree totally - how many ninja used automatic weapons?

I'd like to see the Magistar and the Attica buffed up to a reasonably competitive level. Like, give Magistar it's attack speed back instead of making it a worse version of the Fragor. For Attica, I really don't know what they could do to buff it without making it's numbers absurd, so a new version (Prisma or Prime or some new event version) would be nice.  Like really, if they made an Attica Prime I'd probably only switch weapons if I absolutely had to."
Warframe,3ds2hu,Faceluck,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:28:55 2015 UTC,"For Attica, either reduce its recoil or make the bolts fly straight, no drop-off. As it is right now it's too frustrating to use despite having good damage."
Warframe,3ds2hu,Count_Badger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:40:02 2015 UTC,"I suppose those might work, it has great accuracy if you stick to one or two shots, but once you get into the later levels where one or two shots won't do the trick, its weakness starts to show.  I think at least making the drop off occur way further out would be nice, too. Having to arc a shot from a crossbow in the big room on T2 survival seems a bit silly."
Warframe,3ds2hu,Faceluck,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:42:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, shooting from the Attica is like peeing with a limp dick, how the hell does a high-powered energy crossbow shoot in a weak-ass arc like that? It just feels so damn unsatisfying to use."

Warframe,3drmth,roors99,3,Sat Jul 18 20:20:43 2015 UTC,"Useful early mods that are easy to get:  These mods are particularly useful because two of them are received early on as quest rewards, and the rest of them drop frequently in the early game (with the exception of Convulsion), especially if you stay in Apollodorus to level up your frame and weapons. Fusing mods with copies of themselves is the most cost-effective way to rank up mods. Invest in these mods early to get your damage and survivability up.  (1) Pressure Point: Increases melee damage. This mod drops very frequently and is mandatory in every melee build. Max it.  (2) Redirection: Increases max shields. Shields are kind of like health with regen and no armor. According to the wiki, you automatically receive Redirection during the Vor's Prize questline.  (3) Vitality: Increases max health. This mod drops very frequently, but usefulness depends on the frame and build.   Redirection vs Vitality: In general, use Redirection on frames with high max shields, and use Vitality on frames with high max health. If both shields and health are pretty high (such as Excalibur, who also has high armor), then use both. Otherwise, use whichever gives you a good return for the capacity points it costs. If you're just starting out, then you may want to put both on your frame anyway, just to give you extra survivability while you learn the game. Early on, more shields is typically the better option due to regen, so while you should rank up both Redirection and Vitality, I would put more focus on ranking up Redirection. You will be getting tons of Vitality mods, so use some of those to rank up Redirection. (You can also use Diamond Skin to rank up Redirection and Vitality, as Diamond Skin is not particularly useful and you'll be getting a lot of them.) Any mod that has a max rank of 10 will take lots of resources to max, so don't worry about maxing them, just get them as high as you can.   (4) Molten Impact: Adds Heat damage to melee weapon. According to the wiki, you automatically receive this upon completion of the Once Awake questline, which is immediately after Vor's Prize. Use against Grineer and Infested, but NOT Corpus.  (5) North Wind: Adds Cold damage to melee weapon. I think these drop a lot (not completely sure), so max it. Use against Grineer and Corpus, but NOT Infested.   Heat and Cold can be combined to create Blast damage. Blast can be useful against Infested if you don't have Corrosive. Avoid using Blast against Grineer.   (6) Heated Charge: Adds Heat damage to secondary weapon. These drop a lot, so max it. Use against Grineer and Infested, but NOT Corpus.  (7) Convulsion: Adds Electricity damage to secondary weapon. Can be used against Corpus, but Magnetic (see next paragraph) would be better. Can be used against Infested, but Heat would be better. Do not use against Grineer. This drops somewhat easily in Infested missions due to the large numbers of Infested units that run at you. The only hard part is that Infested missions are rare in the early game except for Dark Sector missions, which tend to be more difficult than normal missions on the same planet.   Heat and Electricity can be combined to create Magnetic damage. Magnetic is most useful against Corpus shields. Avoid using Magnetic against Grineer.   (8) Point Strike: Increases critical chance on primary weapon. A maxed Point Strike is very useful if you chose the Mk1-Paris as your starter primary, although the Mk1-Braton can get some use out of it, too. Point Strike doesn't drop as often as some of the above-mentioned mods, but it drops often enough.  Useful early mods that are highly RNG-dependent:  While most of the useful mods are RNG-dependent, the following mods are the ones you should try to get in the early game and start ranking them up as soon as you can.  (1) Serration: Increases primary damage. Mandatory in all primary builds. You can get it as early as Apollodorus, if you're lucky enough at the 20-minute mark to receive it.  (2) Hornet Strike: Increases secondary damage. Mandatory in all secondary builds. You can get it as early as Apollodorus, if you're lucky enough at the 20-minute mark to receive it.  (3) as many elemental damage mods as you can find: A huge chunk of your total damage comes from elemental damage, so getting elemental mods is a big priority. In particular, the Electricity mods are used in three of the most effective elemental combinations (Corrosive, Magnetic, Radiation).  (4) Streamline: Increases Power Efficiency, which decreases the cost of using Warframe abilities. Your frame's abilities are usually your main method of CC (crowd control), so being able to use them more often is very important. Streamline is a random rare drop from Lancers, which you'll see a lot of in Grineer missions.  (5) Intensify: Increases Power Strength, which increases the damage and/or potency of Warframe abilities. Your frame's abilities are usually your main method of CC (crowd control), so more damage is almost always a good thing, though it depends on your frame. You can get it as early as Apollodorus, if you're lucky enough at the 20-minute mark to receive it.  EDIT: Added Intensify. Clarified some details."
Warframe,3drmth,Mint-Vanilla,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:13:59 2015 UTC,"I won't give a list because the suggestions here i agree with but as a semi-new(ish) player, I'd just suggest playing the game as normal.  The reason being, you will more than likely get the cards you need as you complete the star chart and find your way.    When I was new, I was stuck for a long time around Mars and the Jackal because I didn't realize that you needed some damage mods to help out.  So going back to pick up things from Scorpions (the women that treat you like an Mortal Kombat victim) or any other earlier enemy helped me finally build up a stable of cards to fight stronger enemies.  Choice is still yours but it helps to see where you're faulting and how to learn skills to improve."

Warframe,3ds11u,Atulin,5,Sat Jul 18 22:43:51 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer to the thread. One star rewards have much less rewards in their pool, thus the chance of getting a discount is significantly higher.

Warframe,3ds11u,callanrocks,5,Sun Jul 19 02:38:51 2015 UTC,"Probably because low-tier = less rewards.  Nobody thought about the fact, that less rewards = more chances of getting what you want.

Warframe,3dqn4h,Umbran0x,11,Sat Jul 18 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"To expand on some of the other posts, your affinity is split between equipped weapons and Warframe depending on what or who kills the enemy. If you bring a level 30 main weapon and try to level a secondary or melee you will be splitting most of your experience between both and wasting the XP that goes to the max level weapon.   Dark Sectors have special bonuses that increase XP and resource drops making them great places to level weapons, the infested are also going to need to run up to the pod in order to attack (a few exceptions) making things a bit easier.   Some missions you might consider:    Coba - Earth (DSD)[Low level and tend to be people farming neurodes here] Apollodorus - Mercury (Survival)[Low level, generally active mission with people farming] Sechura - Pluto (DSD)[Almost always active with people credit farming] Draco - Ceres (Interception)[One of the main locations but almost always need to find a squad in recruiting] T1D - Void (Void Defense)[Lowest level of Tower Defense available in the void that will reward you with some prime parts you can use or sell for platinum, and other useful things. This can be a bit more difficult but don't let the key requirement scare you away if you want to try, especially if you host with your own key]   In general I'd recommend trying to have multiple goals for yourself, say farming for a certain resource while also leveling your weapons. There are plenty of missions that are active and overlap while making the grind much more bearable.  Edit: Companion XP is separate from your weapon and warframe XP with the exception of kills made by the companion. This means you can still bring a companion, minus the weapon, and not have any negative impact on your own XP gains."
Warframe,3dqn4h,CleanRandal,5,Sat Jul 18 15:16:11 2015 UTC,"Additional:  Affinity article on the Warframe Wikia   If a Warframe ability kills an enemy, all the Affinity gained goes to the Warframe, and not shared to whatever else is on you. The Affinity distribution is always 25% Warframe, 75% rest of carried weapons unless special case like above. If you wish to level a single weapon and are very sure you can handle the enemies faced, bring only that single weapon. Otherwise, a more reasonable and safer setup would be to bring one solid, leveled weapon and the weapon you wish to level."

Warframe,3dqn4h,LittlePyro1377,3,Sun Jul 19 00:58:04 2015 UTC,"Spy 2.0's re-introduced a lot of the event mods. These are rare V-polarity mods that offer, at max rank, 60% increase to an elemental damage, and 60% increase to status chance of a particular type of weapon.  Imagine you've been using Heated Charge this whole time, with a 90% Heat Damage boost. Its equivalent, for pistols, would be Scorch, a dual stat mod which offers 60% Heat Damage and 60% Status Chance. Meaning, for a weapon which has 100 base damage and 20% status chance, with Heated Charge you'll have 190 damage total and 20% status chance, while with Scorch you'll have 160 damage and 20*1.6 = 32% status chance.  Since there are 4 of these mods (1 for each element) per weapon type, you can have 240% increase in status chance. This makes it really good for weapons that have high status chance; for example, on Latron Prime, with its 25% base status, with all 4 dual stat mods placed in you'll have 0.25*3.4 = 85% status chance.  Take note that only some are offered by Spy Vaults; some of them are offered by Baro Ki'teer at this time instead.  Right now the 4 Rifle Dual mods are: High Voltage (Electric), Rime Rounds (Cold), Malignant Force (Toxin), and Thermite Round (Heat). The 4 Pistol/Secondary Dual mods are: Jolt (Electric), Frostbite (Cold), Pistol Pestilence (Toxin), and Scorch (Heat). The 4 Shotgun mods are: Shell Shock, Frigid Blast, Toxin Barrage, and Scattering Inferno. The Melee mods are: Voltaic Strike, Vicious Frost, Virulent Scourge, and Volcanic Edge."

And people farmed Draco for exp because in an interception where you can control how long the round lasts, you can drag it out so enemies keep spawning. More enemies (i.e. double the enemies you'd see in that amount of time in a dark sector) is much better than a 20% dark sector xp boost.  Dark sector is terrible if you are going to level things.

Warframe,3dqn4h,Esethenial,4,Sat Jul 18 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"Play endless (Defense, Survival, Interception, Excavation) or Spy missions. Unequip the weapons you aren't levelling, and unqeuip your Sentinel's weapon so it doesn't steal your kills.  Each mission type also has certain perks, in addition to netting you some good XP. Defense and Survival offer rewards every 5 waves/minutes, and Excavation offers a reward for each drill you finish (Lua, Earth deserves special mention, as Rotation B drills, which are 3, 7, 11, 15, etc, drop T2 and T3 Void keys). Interception missions guarantee you a T4 Void key at Rotation C, which is every four rounds (endless T4 keys are not included unless the starting enemy level is 20+). Spy missions offer rewards for each completed vault, with a huge XP bonus for completing a room without triggering the alarm. Some of these rewards are unique to Spy, such as the Heat/Cold dual-stat mods."

Warframe,3dqn4h,StickmanAdmin,2,Sat Jul 18 20:56:53 2015 UTC,"In general, endless missions are always going to be your best option simply because of how many enemies you have to deal with. Dark Sectors in particular give bonus experience, which gives them an edge over most other missions. There's also the Interception mission Draco on Ceres, which is where many people go to power-level, but it's fairly boring and doesn't really help you improve along with your weapons. If you want a little more variety, Spy missions are a decent choice, as long as you get each vault without setting off the alarm."

Warframe,3ds4bc,thatdovahkiinyouknow,2,Sat Jul 18 23:27:38 2015 UTC,"Only two, but it only takes two forma to fit all 4 dual stat mods, 2 multi shot mods, punch through, and projectile speed. This gives you 100% proc, of at least 2 of viral, radiation, and corrosive. Corrosive is least ideal IMO because it takes so many procs to reduce armour to 0, see the wikia article on corrosive damage for more info.   Then go to the simulacrum, spawn a group of max level heavy gunners, and see how effective it is at ccing.   Spoiler: it's surprisingly good, but still inferior to most decent cc abilities. That's the Tysis's inherent problem. It would be very useful, but it's just not as good as chaos, irradiating disarm, or m prime."
