Plenty of trails and sites - the ranger office has maps posted outside if you get there after hours.  We found an equestrian trail and hiked in for about 7 miles, and found several camp sites along the way.    Ranger station: 35.284476, -82.726649  I can't find the camp site right now, but it was along the South Mills River trail and the Pink Beds trail.  Best of luck!"

The entire area seemed very nice to backpack through with convenient and cheap camps. Just call the rangers ahead of time and pay 2$ I think.   North Georgia has a lot of foresty foothills and river crossing. I don't remember the specific name of any areas though sorry.

Bring bug spray and river-crossing sandals  Edit:  -also there's lots of poison ivy out there so wear light pants and a light long sleeve to keep your skin covered; bring cortizone in case.  It was an awesome trip and there are lots of places to swim near the south end of the loop.

It basically goes up and down without a lot of mercy, so any weight you can cut from your load will make things easier. Don't worry about carrying too much water, there should be plenty of it everywhere. A good filter and enough to hike half a day should be plenty if you camp close enough to a water source."

backpacking,3e3897,scotty5112,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:20:49 2015 UTC,"I did it last May. I loved it. It was one of those trips that constantly feels like you're being rewarded with views or a nice river to swim in. A few pictures (disposable camera quality because we forgot a good camera...)  It's going to be hot. But there is probably a good amount of tree cover this time of year so that will help.  There is a good amount of water all along the loop so you will be able to cut some water weight. I only carried about 2.5 liters at a time and would use the last liter as an emergency reserve if I ran the CamelBak dry. I only had to tap into it once or twice the entire loop.  Since there is plenty of water available along the trail, also be prepared for water crossings. Lots of them, most are shallow creek crossings, but some took us as deep as 3 feet of water. Bring some kind of strap on sandals for the river crossings - NOT FLIP FLOPS. You will lose them like I did the very first day....  Most of the water is in the valley floors. Remember that valleys are prime real estate for flash flooding. Keep an eye on the weather, if there is any forecast for rain, be prepared to stay on high ground. We got a good amount of rain over 2 days, causing the Little Missouri River to swell up considerably, which ended up cutting off on the north east end of the loop on the north side of the river and had to hike some forestry roads to get to an established bridge crossing the river at Albert Pike Recreation Area.  Order or print the good map set for the trail. I don't know where my buddy got it from, but it saved our bacon once or twice when we lost the trail and then making detours for flooding.   The west leg of the trail is pretty tough. It goes up and down 4 or 5 ridges over a fairly short distance. Some of the uphill pushes are pretty tough. With the heat, I would highly suggest stocking up on water before pushing up any hills, but once you head downhill there should almost always be more water at the bottom.  There are a lot (like every 1/4 to 1/2 mile) of pre-established campsites with fire rings, which is really nice because you'll always be close to one when you get tired and decide to call it a day. Check for burn bans."

backpacking,3dymkj,arthurthe,2,Mon Jul 20 16:27:49 2015 UTC,"I spent a year in Australia and it is absolutely amazing!!! It is expensive though. You can often get free accomodation and sometimes food if you work in a hostel. Also, you can get some stupid tasks at most travel agencies. I also did some door to door sales, but this is definitely best if you already know that you are a decent sales person and have some experience. The best thing you can do is to do work in rural areas. I was lucky to get a job for three weeks at a cattle station, but most people go fruit picking. I didn't and heard it was horrible. But the good thing is that you hang out with other backpackers far away from anything you can spend money on, and just have a good time.  I would definitely recommend you to go to Western Australia. Karijini National Park is still one of the highlights of my trip!! But the trips there can be fairly pricy and you can't really go without a booked tour (Bargain like a motherfucker at the travel stores, and go around to different ones and find the same tour.. Be a greedy dick. I got around 20% discount on most tours and stuff!) Darwin to Perth in like 3 or 4 weeks.. Costs a fortune but is so amazing! Otherwise, spend all your time in Byron Bay.... :-D"

Those lucky few that do go all say it was their favourite part.  You DO need a car though. Best to get a ford falcon or holden commodoore station wagon so you can sleep in it. most places in tassie you can sleep in the car without a fine (unlike the mainland).  For the mainland, get a book on free campsite. It'll pay itself off within days! I know some people that have traveled Oz for rediculously low price, mainly because of that. Sleep in the car at free camping places and go to the supermarket to cook your own food. Can do it super cheap. Good luck to you. You'll have a great time!!"
backpacking,3dzh5z,not_yet_a_dalek,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:04 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm planning on doing Vietnam and Thailand during February too. Maybe we will bump into each other.   I was born in Vietnam so i can give you some insight into Vietnam. You'll be in Vietnam during their Lunar new year celebration ( also known as Tet ). Tet last about a week or so ( Started a day or two before Feb 8 and last about 3-5 days after that ). Be prepare for some weird experiences as the big city like Saigon(also known as Ho Chi Minh city) or Hanoi to be almost deserted as most workers travel to their hometown, most stores will be close for a few days. I have never personally been to Hanoi but i can tell you that finding bus ticket to leave Saigon will be hard before Tet and finding ticket back toward Saigon will be fairly hard after Tet as workers are making their way back toward the city. It shouldn't last long but keep that in mind.   Accommodations on the other hand should be easy to find as most locals don't travel during Tet, they all go back home and visit family.   I'm not going to tell you whether or not you should visit Vietnam during Tet. My experience will be entirely different from your because i was born there. Saigon is extremely busy with the constant noises from motobikes and people but during Tet it will be quiet and peaceful, you'll feel like you sorta own the city.   You'll needs to get a visa to visit Vietnam, it shouldn't be too expensive and keep in mind that there are two type of visa, single entry and multiple entries. You should be able to find cheap plane ticket through discount airline around Asia ( think RyanAir. )  If you have any more questions, just ask away and i'll answer it to the best of my knowledge. Look up Kyleledotnet on youtube, he have a lot of videos on Vietnam foods and places."

backpacking,3dzh5z,aac86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:58:31 2015 UTC,"I've spent a lot of time in backpacking around this region and my initial reaction when looking over your rough itinerary is that it seems a little rushed (at least in my opinion).  There are a lot of other cities/ towns in Vietnam that you really should consider visiting (you may already be planning this and just didn't list it).  Also traveling within Vietnam can take more time than people realize.  Hanoi to HCMC is a long trip, you might want to consider taking some domestic flights to save time.    Are you planning on visiting Siem Reap in Cambodia?  If not, you should really consider it.  3-4 days in Bangkok seems like more time there than you really need.  I think 2 days in Bangkok is enough to see everything.  I don't think you'd have time to go to KL.  It kind of depends on what kind of backpacking you like to do.  If you just want to see as much as possible, without getting too in depth or off the beaten path, your plan could work.  If you spent 2 weeks in Vietnam, 1 week in Cambodia, and 1 week in Thailand you could see most of the major sites but wouldn't have much time to just relax.  There is some great hiking in Vietnam and other types of trips into more rural areas that would be hard to do on your time frame.  It all really depends on what kind of trip you're looking for.  If you have more questions I'd be happy to answer them.  Hope you enjoy your trip, it's a beautiful part of the world!"
backpacking,3dz8j2,timo_dk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:05 2015 UTC,"A week in Mexico. That should be enough time to see tulum, Isla Mujeres, and a cenote or two  A week in Belize. Caye Caulker and some of the Inland jungle.  2 weeks in Guatemala. A day in Tikal and a day in Semuc Champey (with travel that's 4 days). Spend the rest of your time relaxing in either Antigua or better yet Lake Atitlan.  Skip over El Salvador and Honduras. There is stuff to do there but your on a time budget and what's there can easily be found just as good else where. Honduras does have some great scuba and El Salvador has some great surfing.  2 weeks in Nicaragua. A day in Leon for Volcano Surfing. Granada is another good colonial town. Spend most of your time on the jungle island Ometepe or party beach town San Juan Del Sur.   (Both Guatemala and Nicaragua are great for just doing nothing and relaxing.)  A week in Costa Rica. There is so much to do here, but it's hard to get around. It's easier just to limit yourself a week to see Arenal, Monteverde and Manuel Antonio.  A week in Panama. Relax for a few days on Bocas Del Toro and spend the last 2 days of your trip in panama city seeing the canal and the mall (biggest in the western hemisphere). San Blas are great but they require a few days and a few hundred dollars.  That's how I would budget 8 weeks. I did a similar trip but had a little more time. I really want to go back, especially nicaragua. As for a motorbike. It's possible to buy a motorbike in mexico and ride it through, but it's not very common. It's just as easy to take chicken buses everywhere."

backpacking,3dx7ku,smilingperls007,8,Mon Jul 20 07:40:10 2015 UTC,"I realize this article is kind of tongue in cheek, but there is actually a lot of truth to it.   Visiting this far away land like Europe or Asia exists in your mind as this long term goal.  You look forward to it and you build up to it.  But once you have been there, it kind of takes the luster off of things.   I can relate it to sex.  Imagine you find that special significant other... You don't know each other, but you gradually get to know each other.  There all of these crazy sexual things that you aspire to do and gradually, you check them off the list, each one making you feel more complete, experienced and fulfilled.  The sex gets better and better and each encounter builds upon the lessons you've learned along the way.   Now imagine you have a one night stand, and your first night together you do it all...  Oral, vaginal, anal, role playing, bandage.... It's mind blowing.  It's the best sex you will ever have in your life.  Which means the rest of your life you will have decent, but mediocre sex with the person you love forever.  ... Constantly comparing it to that one night and feeling like your life is a huge let down.   I would recommend traveling young, but get to know what's around you before you go for that one huge trip.  See all that your country has to offer, once you are in tune with what your culture is all about, then branch out to other cultures.   When you are in your early 20's, you don't have enough experience yet to really appreciate international travel.  You are still learning about your environment.  Once you have some experience in life, then when you travel, you take a closer interest in the nuts and bolts of how other cultures work.  You see the positives, the negatives, and everything in between.   But if you go on that huge trip too soon, it gives you a false impression of the way things are.  The grass seems so much greener everywhere else.   I have traveled a lot.  I love to travel.  But I work hard to enable that.  I have also been plugged in to paying taxes, balancing a business, managing projects, etc.  So when I go elsewhere I know a little bit about what it takes to make that culture work.  I understand a little about what the negative side effects are.  And with that information, I am able to make educated opinions on what things could be adopted by my community back home, what things wouldn't work, and which things are better back home.   By comparison, my nephew graduated from college and his parents paid for him to backpack across Europe.  He came back as a little dickhead.  He shits on everything that is American and constantly talks about how much better it is everywhere else.   I want to explain to him that life is awesome when you don't know what work is, when your parents just pay for you do do whatever the hell you want for 2 months, and you eat out and visit all of the tourist atractions nonstop without seeing how the local people live. He took his entire trip never considering what it's like to work a full time job in London, Belgium, France, etc.  He acts like America is just oppressive corporations making you slave away 8 hours a day and everyone else in the world is just on a permanent vacation.   He doesn't realize that people work hard all over the world... That he was fortunate enough to see more in some countries than many of the locals have.  He doesn't realize that a lot of people from other places have the same feeling about coming to America.  Because they come here and spend 2 months seeing only the best sites.   The thing is that the world is a beautiful place.  And the secret to happiness is not finding the one place where the cool shit is.  It's about finding cool shit wherever you are.  He made almost no effort to understand American culture (or European culture for that matter) and he just thinks the world is his oyster and at his beckon call.  He has no idea how much work it takes to pay for that sort of trip, and he doesn't truly appreciate the value of it.   He is the most arrogant, condescending little prick now.  He talks down to everyone and acts like no one understands what it's like elsewhere.  But the truth is that a lot of us do... But we also know what it's like here.  He doesn't know that yet.   Like they say... If you never experience bad, you can't truly appreciate the good.  I highly recommend getting a little experience in real life before trying to ""climb the everest"" of travel.  Learn everywhere you go.  Get to know what life is like in Kentucky, Washington, California, Texas, Florida, NY, etc.  It's very different everywhere.  And every state has a ton to offer.  Explore Canada, Mexico, Alaska...   then venture further abroad.   I love Europe.  But I don't have any naive impressions that life is all daisys for people there.  They work hard, deal with asshole bosses, have to maintain their homes, pay taxes for communities, struggle with marriage problems, raise children as good as they can, respect culture....   All things that my nephew has no experience with.   At this point is only a consumer.  He has nothing to offer the world experience wise.  He just leeches off of others."

You still dont have that much responsibility. And when you have dementia when you grow old you'll still remember your travel since it is in your long term memory...
backpacking,3du6lj,mooncoyote,12,Sun Jul 19 14:40:52 2015 UTC,"There's always Outward Bound and NOLS courses being offered, but you might have to travel for them.  If you don't find a course, you can definitely ease into it and self-educate.    Start by going car camping once or twice. Find a campground, figure out what the amenities are, and bring the rest. It's hard to screw up with this, and it's a good way to get a feel for the basics of making camp. Once you are comfy with car camping, do a google search for ""backpacking checklist"" or ""backpacking gear list."" Those lists will actually end up talking about all the things that go into a backpacking trip. After you read 4 or 5 of them, you'll see that they all say the same things over and over. That's because basic backpacking competence is pretty straightforward. Go to your REI and get some gear. While you are there, make sure to chat with a staff member to get gear guidance, but also to talk about tips and whatnot. And don't forget to browse the local trail books. Then just get out and do a small, conservative trip on a well-trod trail. It might feel alien at first, but you'll quickly see that it's just walking, pitching a tent, eating simple stuff, pooping in a hole, sleeping out, packing up, and walking more. The only slightly technical bits that could come into play are filtering your water (if the trip is such that you can't carry all the water you need), or bear-proofing your food (if the trip is in bear country). Both of these technical bits are easily learned in a couple of minutes on google. After your first trip, you will see that backpacking isn't particularly technical. It's just different than urban living. (Of course, it can get technical if you want to, say, get into alpinism or bushcraft, but a basic level of competence is easy to achieve.)"

It's kind of an intro into ultralight packs.   I LOVE mine. Now I don't need a lot of pockets for organization so if you do, it isn't for you. If you don't and want to save on weight then check it out. It doesn't come with a hood, only drawback - but you can buy one from them that goes with it. I think the leopard version does which is very similar so you could check that too.  Hip belt is super comfy and the suspension system is great."

The Sawyer Mini is a popular option. I personally prefer the Sawyer Squeeze option, for $10 more. The tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping pad I've never used.

I consider myself fairly fast and comfortable, but others go about it differently and also have good results.   I'm still tweaking my setup all the time, but most of my choices represent 25 years or so of backpacking, dealing with different conditions and needing to make choices about what works best for me.   It can seem daunting (and expensive as hell), but just slowly chisel away at it, and go after the things that are causing you the biggest problems. If you stay warm and dry at night, and they're not crushingly heavy or bulky, don't worry about your tent and bag."

I have two eVent waterproof stuff sacks, one for my down bag (which I consider rather mandatory) and another for my clothes. With those two items dry I can basically submerge my pack and not worry about anything else getting hurt (maps and my kindle are in ziplocks). So I don't carry a bag liner or pack cover of any type. I have my umbrella and the important things are in dry bags.  So really it's just keeping my clothes and bag dry, and helping to crush them down to size a bit. The down bag you can really crank on over and over again without hurting it.  I spend most of my time in the Sierra Nevada. Alpine forests, granite mountains, etc."

backpacking,3dpekp,ThoseWhoDoVoodoo,7,Sat Jul 18 04:19:04 2015 UTC,Let it dry out when you get home  Pack the rain fly in the outside of your pack separate from the body of the tent  It's not going to mold from just being in your bag while you finish your hike.
backpacking,3dpekp,DrPoopingPooperson,4,Sat Jul 18 04:55:27 2015 UTC,"My own rules when it gets wet out.  If you have time and cooperative weather to dry it out, that's great. Often I find (being in the northwest) that isn't the case.  The key I find is packing the tent so the inside stays dry and wet portions stay contained. Fold rainfly and footprint so that the wettest portions are contained inside. Fold dryest part of the tent body to the inside and in a manner that exposes the edges. Wet or dry I always pack my tent in the order of accessibility. Rain fly on first, tent body, then footprint. This helps speed up setup and tairdown and minimize exposure when the fly isn't on.  If you anticipate rain may fall kts important to setup your tent with as much protection from trees/canopy within reason. Also id you can antixipate the direction, orient your tent/rainfly accordingly, make sure the rainfly is fastened correctly and tight especially in high wind scenarios.  Soon as you get home air dry your tent. After it's dry I tend to set it up and let it air out in its natural form."
backpacking,3dpekp,usaytomatoisaytomato,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:23:32 2015 UTC,"DrPoopingPooperson :) is correct, after all he/she/it is a doctor.    If it is wet from either a night rain or morning dew, I will take the rain fly off first thing in the morning and put in somewhere in direct sunlight when I am doing my morning ritual, this helps out.  If/when your tent is empty, turn it upside down in the sun to dry out the bottom.  If it is raining while you are packing, just pack the tent and set it up to dry when you get to your location.  You should have no problem with a wet tent as long as you dry it within a few days of it being wet.  I typically give my tent a hose down when I get home to get rid of dirt/mud/ hitchhiking ants and mosquitoes and make sure it is dry before putting it away before my next walkabout."
backpacking,3dpekp,awion89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:31:32 2015 UTC,Yes it will mold if stored wet.  Solutions include pitching the tent in your house/garage/back yard until dry or putting it in a dryer on low or air dry settings.
backpacking,3dpekp,Teardownstrongholds,0,Sat Jul 18 19:03:29 2015 UTC,"Not really. If you pack it wet, it's a mess. The best way is simply to wait for the rain to stop and the sun to come out. Then drape your stuff over some bushes until it dries out. If the rain stops by the morning, this is reasonable. Even if you pack it wet and the sun comes out later, stop and let it all air out and get dry.  Some tents (MSR Hubba Hubba NX 2, example) lets you ""dry pitch"" it. Where you can put up the rainfly and ground sheet first, then put the tent in underneath the now pitched fly. So when you pack up you do it the same, and tent body does remain somewhat dry. Groundcloth and fly is still drenched.   If the weather calls for nonstop rain for more than a day and I don't want to hang in the tent and wait, I stay home. Happened a lot when I lived in New England."
backpacking,3dqeo8,ReedSays,2,Sat Jul 18 13:06:09 2015 UTC,"Why solo?  It's a lot easier to learn from someone who has done this in the real world because you are going to need to see how gear works,  not just know what to pack.  If you're determined to solo it, we need a region and a route and such.   You could also go to the local shop with your bag fully loaded and find a person there who backpacks (don't get the guy who just wants a job and never goes out. )  They should be able to explain how gear works and correct anything you are missing.  Honestly,  you probably have everything and are actually going to carry too much."
backpacking,3dqeo8,Joker1337,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:39:53 2015 UTC,"Solo simply because I don't know anyone who has this kind of hobby, and I wouldn't really know how to find anyone who would like to join me.

I'm sure I could find things like first aid and multitool but I haven't grabbed them quite yet. (I like to have a game plan with everything I need on a list before grabbing anything.

backpacking,3dqeo8,Joker1337,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:48:51 2015 UTC,"If you have a shop near you they may have trips set up for first timers.  They probably will loan or rent certain gear out too.    If you're seriously starting from scratch, the best way to reduce cost is to find someone who backpacks and borrow gear or go on a trip with them.  Go to the local store and ask around.  A fully outfitted (budget) pack can run upwards of 400, easily.  If you're buying good gear you can break 1000 without even trying (down sleeping bags start at ~200).  That sucks when you buy gear you later find you don't like or don't need.  http://m.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpacking-checklist.html has a list.     You need everything from 1 to 10.    Everything else depends on the style of the trip and how much you are able to improvise / how many uses you can get out of each piece of gear / how dirty you are willing to be (you don't use an ice axe in Iowa and a sock works fine as a pot grabber and probably as a towel and a dish rag.)

backpacking,3dqeo8,slow6i,2,Sat Jul 18 14:25:52 2015 UTC,"Backpack  Yes.  Sleeping bag  Yes.  A blanket will do in a pinch for a first run.  Sleeping pad  Yes.  You're going to want this.  Tent? (should I use a tarp, sticks, and a ground cloth instead?)  Tent or...   Just a ground cloth and roll yourself like a burrito if it rains.  Put a second layer between the bag and your outer cloth and leave your head out of the inner roll so all the condensation from your breath doesn't soak your bag.  I don't try this in more severe weather, but I've done lots of summer and spring trips this way.  Saves a ton of weight in poles.  If you're good with knots and are going to get trekking poles (recommended), learn to use those plus a few stakes to set up a tarp.   Stove?  Highly recommended unless you know exactly how to build a fire in the rain.  I've never gone without.  Heat is a very valuable thing.  Water Purification (Thinking the squeeze one?)  Sawyer Squeeze is my favorite right now, tablets are cheap and light and will work too.  Hiking shoes  Yes  Wool socks  Yes.  Plus liners.  Permit to hike/camp?  If needed.  Get a paper map of the site.  Bandana and Hat  Yup.  Wool/Synthetic tshirt  Yup.  Just the one you're wearing plus one more.  Wool/synthetic undies? (Maybe athletic compression shorts? idk)  Compression shorts should work.  Stay away from cotton.  Quick drying shorts? (What kind of material would that be?)  Not cotton.  Basketball shorts or nylon shorts.  Long sleeve shirt? (Also wool/synthetic or what?)  If you need it.  Otherwise skip it and just carry the second T-shirt.  Your rain gear will be the last ditch cold layer.  Head lamp  Yes.  Extra batteries  Probably not needed for a 2-day trip as long as you're careful and put new ones in the lamp at the beginning.  Map/Trail brochure  Must have.  Make sure you can orient it too.  Toilet Paper  Yes.  Ditch the tube, take like 50 squares in a zip-loc.  Sanitation wipes? (Non-alcoholic or what?)  I just use the sanitizer.  Wipes are extra weight.  Hand sanitizer? (Same question.)  Purell in the little squeeze bottle.  Super useful if you have contacts.  Insect repellent  Must have this time of year.  Don't cheap out on it.  Tooth brush  Yes.  Cut the back 2""-4"" of the brush handle off.  Save the weight.  FLOSS too.  Floss is both floss and a really strong thread if something breaks.  Pack a needle in your repair kit.  Tooth paste  Yes.  Get a travel tube and squeeze half of the tube out.  Don't carry extra toothpaste.  Biodegradable soap? (So like the camp suds stuff?)  Camp suds.  Multitool  Yes.  Get a light one.  Lighter  Yes.  Make sure it has liquid and a safety feature.  Sun Screen  Yes.  Higher SPF's are lighter, recommend you go with 50.  SPF 100 (if you can find it) is really light, but hurts to apply.  Lip balm  Yes / no.  If you need it normally, take it.  It's more needed when you jump to altitudes you're not used to.  Sunglasses  Yup.  Durable ones.  Compass  Yup.  First aid kit? Yes.  You'll find this has the most little pieces in it.  Your personal kit for a 2-day trip should fit snugly into a sandwich bag.  Don't forget you're bringing the bandana and the multi-tool, so you have a triangular bandage and a pair of scissors already.  Pack moleskin.   Also:  Rain gear.  Emergency food (a day's worth might be overkill, but at least 1000 calories.)  50' of 1/8"" nylon rope.  If you snag a stove: one aluminum pot with lid, one plate (give-away frisbees work great), one spoon, one plastic cup (insulated with a lid if you do this in the winter.)  Two people who know where you are going when you are getting back.  Two or three 1 quart Aquafina bottles.  Don't take Nalgene stuff unless you want to be able to pour hot water into the bottles (useful when it's cold.)  Nalgene adds like 8oz each bottle.  Repair kit.  6' of duct tape, a needle the floss will fit into, and a spare boot lace.  If you have an external frame pack, stick an extra clevis pin and ring in there too.  Three or four extra 1 gallon zip locs, five or six rubber bands.  I don't know the critter situation in your neck of the woods, but you need a way to keep animals out of your smellables.  Bear canister or bag.  Ask your local shop what to do.  Running through my bag now, I don't think I'm missing anything.  Edit: I should reiterate, you're going to be safer and learn with less frustration if you find a buddy."

I feel much more prepared now and have a gameplan! (Which is what I wanted.) Thanks a lot, hopefully I'll get most of what I need and will have a story to share about next weekend! Thanks again!"
backpacking,3dqeo8,kid775,2,Sat Jul 18 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"No reason to apologize for being thorough. :)   I recently did a 2 day - 1 night hike (should have been 3 but my pace was way faster than I thought the second day.) And can tell you what I learned on my first solo trip.   Keep in mind: I dont mind being dirty. If I need to go a day without brushing my teeth, that doesnt bother me.   The main thing I was concerned about on my trip was water. So I carried both a chemical treatment (iodine and nutralizer) and a Sawyer mini filter. I carried 2 1L smartwater bottles cause I can fit them in my side pouch easily. And also carried a 100oz CamelBack bladder. I ended up running the sawyer filter inline in my bladder, and using the 1L bottles for treating water. It worked well for me, but my pack is a bit too big for a 1 night trip so i had plenty of room for the CamelBak.  I overdid it on the food, as in I carried way too much. I had no idea how much I was gonna eat and soon realized that I overpacked. Think about this alot.  Biodegradable soap is probably not necessary unless you are going to be on a trip for longer than 2 days. You can wash your stuff when you get back, wipe it down with sanitizer, or just use warm water. Besides, biodegradable soap is still bad. Source  Definitely bring a first aid kit. That should not have a question mark by it. No, it doesnt need to be a 9000 piece monstrosity that will prepare you for the end of the world. But enough to do basic first aid should you or someone you come across need it.   For shelter, I just used the rainfly from my tent and 1 pole and staked it out. But I knew the weather was going to be good, so i wasnt worried about the ground / me being wet when I woke up in the morning.   Lastly, I used this guide as a rough estimation on gear that I wanted for my trip.  Just go out and have fun hiking and seeing the sights. Dont overthink your trip too much but do prepare for it. Map it out for someone, when and where you expect to camp, etc. (If possible. I was hiking on the PCT so there was a google earth track that I used to map my route.)"
backpacking,3dqeo8,buttholiness,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:32:04 2015 UTC,What did you bring for food? I've been thinking about this a lot and I just keep coming back to granola bars and dehydrated food like milk/beans. Ramen and crakers as well?
backpacking,3dqeo8,kid775,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:25:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't want anything really salty, because I was worried about water, so I stayed away from the ramen. Sunkist makes freeze dried fruit now that is pretty good. I got two mountain meals for dinners, poptarts and Idahoan instant potatoes. I was expecting to eat 2 - 2 packs of poptarts, 1 bag of freeze dried fruit, 1 pack of instant potatoes, and a mtn meal per day ( i was carrying 3 of these packs.) What I really ate was 4 or 5 bites of potatoes, 1 mtn meal that i cooked for breakfast, ate half of, then finished later, maybe 2 or 3 poptarts, and 2 packs of the dried fruit. For both days. I just basically looked for anything dried or easy to cook/store and had a high calorie count."
backpacking,3dnf4x,staycruzin,11,Fri Jul 17 18:11:52 2015 UTC,"We really should have this in a wiki... (or you could search /r/CampingandHiking which is more outdoor focused, while this sub is designed for world travel)...     There are 3 primary types of water purification:     1) Chemicals       Examples: bleach, iodine, and AquaMira Positive:  kill everything, zero physical effort, cheap (bleach/iodine) Negative: time (10-20 minutes to take effect), expensive (aquamira), smell (bleach), taste (iodine)   Nothing is cheaper or effective than bleach, you just have to deal with the time/smell. AquaMira solves the smell/taste part, but you still have the wait and price to deal with.       2) Filter      Examples: pumps, squeezes, gravity Positive: cheap, light, long lasting, fast, and easy to use, no waiting - instantly ready to drink as it comes out of the filter Negative: requires regular maintenance (after each trip typically), requires physical effort (squeeze less so than pumps)   Pumps were the defacto standard (other than iodine) for many years. Until 2012 when Sawyer came out with the Squeeze. The Sawyer Squeeze, and the new Mini, are the most popular solution today.   3) UV       Example: SteriPen Positive: kills everything, requires no physical effort, works in minutes per liter Negative: reliance on batteries and electronic components, must pre-filter the water   Ignoring the huge negatives - UV lights really are awesome. Personally the concern for carrying electronics into the wilderness is too big to make this a real option (carried one for a while, it broke mid-trip and I never went back).         In general - I suggest the Sawyer Squeeze (with an 1.5L Evernew dirty bag) and AquaMira as top 2 options. I actually carry both, to have a backup solution on long trips. The Sawyer Mini is fine if you plan to put it in-line with a bladder - although you are likely to notice the additional effort required to suck clean water (you can't deny the convenience of simply scooping dirty water directly into your bladder and going. Just have to have an answer of what to use for cooking)."
backpacking,3dnf4x,cwcoleman,2,Fri Jul 17 23:29:49 2015 UTC,"Awesome post, really appreciate you taking the time to write that out. I think you just sold me on the Squeeze! Seems like the most convenient method for sure. So basically I just fill up the bag and squeeze the water out through the filter and into my hydration bladder?"
backpacking,3dnf4x,cwcoleman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yup. Fill up the dirty bag, attach the filter, squeeze. Out comes clean water. You can pour it directly into your mouth, a pot, or your clean bladder/bottle.         I suggest replacing the dirty bags the filter comes with because I like bigger bags. The Evernew comes in 1.5 liter and that big makes life even better. I think the Squeeze comes with a 1liter bag, so that really is fine (the mini ones are even smaller so you have to scoop like 4 times to fill a nalgene and that's a pain).      There is also the in-line option I mentioned. Where you splice the filter into the tube of your bladder. Then your bladder becomes your dirty bag. Just scoop dirty water into it and then drink, zero effort. The problem becomes with cooking - how do you get water to cook with (you could just boil it, have a second filter for kitchen, or use a secondary option like chemicals). The Mini makes in-line mode even easier, but again - has a slower flow rate. There are always tradeoffs...."
backpacking,3dnf4x,The_High_Life,2,Sat Jul 18 00:02:51 2015 UTC,"I am definitely intrigued by the in-line set up but the majority of my hiking is day hikes where additional water (other than my filled bladder) isn't necessary so I think the squeeze is my best bet. As for the bigger bladder, I don't think it will be necessary for such a shorter trip. Especially since I have a ton of stuff to buy and I'm trying to spend as little as possible. So the 1 L it comes with will have to suffice for now. Thanks again !!"
backpacking,3dnf4x,cwcoleman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:15:15 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand how you broke a steripen, they are incredibly durable.  We carry it with an extra set of batteries, 1st set is still going after 4 trips in 6 months, and about 50 liters.  You don't need a prefilter, we never use one."
backpacking,3dnf4x,pombe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"Just broke one trip. I used it for about a year (maybe 15 trips). The light wouldn't come on as expected when plunged into the water. We would restart it, it would blink, and then not purify. Really frustrating way to break - because we could tell it was on and batteries were working - just wouldn't do the job.        I do still think they are great devices. Like I said - couldn't be easier. I just personally lost my trust after that trip.       Prefilter is necessary if there are floaties in the water. The light isn't as effective if there is stuff in the water that blocks it. Definitely not necessary always, but gotta have one on hand in case there is no other option. A bandana or even your tshirt does the job."
backpacking,3dnf4x,stylesgt,4,Sat Jul 18 16:43:50 2015 UTC,Sawyer minis are awesome.  But cut the top off a cheap plastic bottle to use as a scoop for filling the squeeze bag.   You can also use them as an inline filter for a hydration bladder.  What we do for larger groups is hang a designated dirty water  bladder (a platypus big zip) from a tree and use the sawyer as a gravity filter.
backpacking,3dnf4x,pombe,3,Fri Jul 17 18:17:40 2015 UTC,I would greatly recommend the Sawyer Squeeze over the Mini. Most people I know that bought a Mini ended up quickly opting to change to the Squeeze.
backpacking,3dnf4x,stylesgt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:31:47 2015 UTC,Why is that?
backpacking,3dnf4x,thelyfeaquatic,5,Fri Jul 17 20:47:40 2015 UTC,"Here is a thread on the PCT subreddit discussing the Mini vs. Squeeze. The general consensus I've seen is that the Mini has a flow rate that is frustrating to use for filtering a lot of water, while the Squeeze is easier to use and has a better flow rate. I have not used the Mini, so take my advice with a grain of salt. I personally have a ton of patience, so the flow rate probably wouldn't bother me, but I still opted for the Squeeze.    I have also seen a lot of comments on the lack of quality in the gasket and bags for the Squeeze. It seems that Sawyer has improved the quality of both over the past year, but I carry a spare bag.    I also carry either iodine or Aqua Mira as a backup treatment system, should my filter fail. I like my redundancies, especially when it comes to water."
backpacking,3dnf4x,pombe,2,Fri Jul 17 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"I just got the mini and used it in the Sierras two weeks ago... I had a two L squeeze bag and it was SOOO slow.

backpacking,3dnf4x,thelyfeaquatic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:14:33 2015 UTC,"Ah.  I can see that.   I dont much like the bag squeezing either.  I mostly use it as a gravity filter and have an attachment for my clean water bladder and bottles, so i just hook it up and go do something else for a while."
backpacking,3dnf4x,stylesgt,2,Fri Jul 17 21:11:17 2015 UTC,"yea, the squeeze bag is hard to fill because it has such a small opening... even in running water I could not get my bag to fill without having to drag it through the water multiple (15+?) times..."
backpacking,3dnf4x,fraterursus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:15:29 2015 UTC,"That's a good solution. Plenty of people love the Mini, and it seems to be a pretty excellent product.    As one redditor on the post I linked to pointed out, the main issue she had with the time it took to filter water was the length of time it took compared to the systems of any companion hikers. That would be the most frustrating part to me, having other people wait on me. Of course, most folks you meet on the trail and end up hiking with are not going to mind waiting. But the flow rate is a limitation worth considering when thinking of using the Mini."
backpacking,3dnf4x,buttholiness,6,Fri Jul 17 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"A Platypus Gravityworks filter like this is totally worth the cost and slight weight. Fill up the ""dirty"" bag, hang it up for 1-2 min, and you have 4 liters of clean water. I love this thing."

backpacking,3dnf4x,Almostcomatose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:02:32 2015 UTC,That is completely overstated. The taste left behind by tabs is really not that bad at all. The biggest negative of tabs is the wait time. Aquamira you can have filtered water in under an hour iirc but other options ive used can take up to 4 hours.

If I was worried about sediment and algae in the water I would choose the pump.    Tabs are fine, you dont really need that in addition to a filter or UV as long as you arent pulling water from a sewage system or camping in the 3rd world.  Tabs take 30-60 minutes before the water is potable, kind of a long time, and iodine tastes gross.

Basically you fill up a bag (which is supplied with the filter) with dirty water, attach the filter, and squeeze. Out comes clean water. Dummy proof.        The Mini has a slower flow rate than the Squeeze, which some people care about more than others. The Mini also comes with ridiculously small dirty bags, I really suggest upgrading to at least a 1 liter bag if you get the Mini. Evernew makes great water bags for this."

backpacking,3dnf4x,cwcoleman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:04:26 2015 UTC,"Just to provide another perspective about the mini. There were a few issues that are making me consider getting something else for my next trip.   1) the bag, being flexible/collapsible can actually be really difficult to fill in water.  Like other plastic bags, when you put it in water the external water pressure keeps the bag closed. I've read that other people use a pop bottle, since it's not collapsible.  2) the bag is also pretty small. We needed to fill the bag at least two and a half times to replenish our water bottles each time.  3) Both 1 and 2 make the rate of flow issue more annoying. The rate of flow is low, but I wasn't prepared for just how low. It was usually fine for the first two bagfulls but then you would have to backwash to filter to refresh it and renew the rate of flow. This can be annoying and add to the time it takes to fill your water bottles.  I was hiking in temps above 30C and the bugs were vicious. I needed to hydrate so often and the Sawyer mini was not as dummy proof and quick as some reviews on Reddit led me to believe. It made it difficult to hydrate properly because of the time it took each time. Add swarms bugs biting as you are taking the time to carefully fill the collapsible bag or as the flow rate begins to slow and you'll wish that you had chosen a different method.  I would still use the mini, but it might not be the best for all trips and conditions. The reviews on amazon and reddit were glowing, but there are some definite downsides to the Sawyer mini system."

backpacking,3dk97c,HersheyHWY,8,Thu Jul 16 23:10:16 2015 UTC,"This past weekend I went out to do Passage 30 and then some of the 800+ mile Arizona Trail. This section left from Gooseberry Springs Trailhead south of Mormon Lake and ended at Canyon Vista Campground near Flagstaff. The weather was perfect this past weekend and despite it being monsoon season, it didnât rain once.  Three of us left on Friday morning at about 10:30AM. We set out through the ponderosas at a fair pace and any sound of Lake Mary Road in the background soon faded. We followed along an old logging railroad bed. There were a few rotting ties and rusty remnants of the enterprise long past. It wasnât very long until I came across some deer running across the trail. This didnât get past my Siberian Husky, Shasta. She loves nothing more than to try to chase and catch things and murder them. She thinks sheâs a wolf sometimes, but she totally isnât.  One of us was going much slower than the others, so we took frequent breaks to allow her to catch up. She was extremely novice and I couldnât help but think that despite all of her big talk and constant, donât-worry-about-meâs that she had bitten off a bit more than she could chew. She had loaded a 40+ lb pack on this outing. This wouldnât be a problem for me, but a small inexperienced hiker shouldnât load themselves down like that.  We got into a pattern of going ahead, and waiting. We saw some elk, saw some deer, and simply enjoyed the forest and gently rolling ridges. Each time we waited, she would insist that we âgo aheadâ and that we âdidnât have to wait for her, sheâd catch up.â Yeah right! Like I trust that. How am I supposed to make sure newbies havenât killed themselves or gotten lost if I donât keep an eye on them! Eventually we came to Double Springs Campground and I took a 30 minute break to wait for her. After this time, we moved ahead about Â¾ mile to set up an early camp for the night and hold out for our slower comrade to catch up.   Worried about the other hiker, I was about to go run back down the trail to find her when we got a message from her that she was staying the Â¾ miles down the trail at Double Springs Campground. She also informed us that she was exiting the trail (uh oh she was the shuttle) and told us that we would be coming down off the trail to get her stuff out of the third hikerâs van.   We set up a campfire and hunkered down for the night. I had my dinner, had some drink, and crawled into my bag at about 10:30PM. We woke up the next morning, packed up, and hit the trail at about 8:00AM. We had to drop off the trail to meet the newbie at the Double Springs Campground Host site.   Right as weâre almost there, we see her from across the way hopping into a car and leaving! So much for patience. Talking to the camp host we confirm our suspicions. This lady is a bit of a nutto! She had been frantically talking nonsense to the camp host for about an hour, and had even threatened to smash the other hikerâs van window to get her stuff out.   We ended up calling her (first time meeting and hiking with her) and get everything worked out but by god do we have one hell of a delay. It takes two hours for Princess Newbie to get herself all sorted out and we ended up having to set out in a massive time crunch! We had scheduled to meet with 3 other hikers  at the Horse Lake Trailhead at noon some 9 miles away.   We set out and marched through the woods. Without the newbie we made a 3 mph pace through the woods, past the railroad bed once more, past some meadows, and across Lake Mary Rd. to arrive only 1 and a half hours late at our meeting point. Shasta was being a lazy pack animal so I had to take her pack and clip it to mine to get her to move her ass!   After some introductions and a little first aid for my trailing hiker who busted her lip tripping on a rock right at the end, we set off! We made some decent time passing by Horse Tank and Horse Lake Tank (confusing), stopping at one for a nice break/almost nap. We made about 7 miles and then made camp just outside of Lost Tank right before a big herd of deer ran off. We lounged and got water and had dinner and had our campfire. I drank the rest of my Ole Smoke Blackberry Moonshine I had packed along and passed out in my tent at about 9:15.  The next morning we got our shit together and loaded up on water. I let one of the other hikers use my filter to filter some water. BIG MISTAKE! She got a bunch of silt and junk in my filter making it a whole lot of work for me to get any water the entire day.  We set out over the pinyon-juniper grasslands and soon took a pass near the rim of Anderson Mesa, just before the observatory. We got some great views above Lake Mary and out over the forested hills beyond. Skirting around the observatory, we soon came across Prime Lake. It was in poor condition like many of the lakes in the area despite the exceptionally wet winter and spring. It really highlights the effects of long term drought for me when I get out into the backcountry and get a chance to feel the straining pulse of the water on the landscape. I canât help but think how much strain is added to the lakes and stream by our alterations to the natural state of the watershed. Passing by the now completely dry Marshall Lake drives the point home.   We cross up and down drainage after drainage as we make our way across Marshall Mesa. Eventually we finally make it to the Walnut Canyon Rim and begin our roundabout descent into the canyon. We descend the basalt cap of the mesa, past the Kaibab Limestone, then past the cross bedded sandstone that makes up much of the canyon walls. Finally almost to that beer and burgers Iâve been thinking about all day!   I call my wife to come pick me up at the trailâs end. We make a climb out of the canyon and take the now irritatingly meandering trail and finally arrive at the end! My wife is there waiting for me and we shuttle back and forth until all of the people and vehicles are accounted for. Itâs time for The Lumberyard for a brew, a burger, and some deep fried macânâcheese balls."

I expected high desert and was pleasantly surprised by the thickly wooded landscape that I was greeted by.  Hey, not to be ""that guy,"" but it needs to be said about your canine companion: please be respectful of wildlife, and that includes not adding unnecessary stress to them by letting Shasta chase them around. I get that some dogs have strong prey drive, so it's really up to you to make sure that she is as respectful to wildlife as you would be. It is, after all, their home and we are all just visitors there, dog and human alike.  https://lnt.org/blog/8-tips-leave-no-trace-your-dog  Thanks for sharing your photos and trip report!

My dog is on leash at all times. Mostly because she cant be trusted and also because you're not permitted to have dogs off leash in the forest. This is possibly the most widely ignored forest rule.   She mostly just tugs on the leash when we see things like deer and elk, but there's nothing I can do about her trying to chase trailside lizards and rodents. She's awful fast with her little bit of leash room."

backpacking,3dk97c,Hanneyh1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:09 2015 UTC,"This was our first year going, and we had haphazardly planned the trip; that is, I left it all up to my buddy, since we were going to Phoenix to pick up his daughter from her freshman year of college, and I was just sort of there to keep him company and take turns at the wheel. After we'd bailed on camping booked the hotel room, I was poking around the IG feed for Expo West and saw that some people were camping in the NF around the Expo and immediately saw the error of our ways. Would have been way cheaper, and we were already totally prepared for it.   So maybe you experience the same thing that I do when you're overlanding.   I love being outdoors. Sleeping outside is so doggone awesome, it feels natural for me. I've got my backpacking gear pared down to just the minimum and have a really good system that I can actually be comfy with when I'm in the woods and getting around on my own two feet.   Then, when it's time to do some bouncing around on four wheels in my rig I feel like I'm just bringing waaay too much kit. And then to top off this feeling of being overburdened and overpacked, there's the issue of feeling like I'm not ""earning"" the miles since I'm driving it and not walking it. Do you have this feeling at all? Have you had it? If so, how did you reconcile it?"
backpacking,3dk97c,JTD0G,2,Fri Jul 17 16:28:09 2015 UTC,"I don't have this feeling at all.  For me it's two totally different things. Backpacking is for areas a vehicle can't get and off roading is for going places a vehicle can get.   You're covering distances that feet can't get you quickly, not to mention technical challenges, pushing vehicles to their limits and beyond, and the joy of working on your own vehicle.  I see covering the miles in my rig and hitting trail's and obstacles as the fruits of my hard work on the vehicle and practice in offroad driving techniques. I spend a lot of time and effort keeping it running in top shape and modifying it, so there's no reason I should feel as if the miles aren't earned fruits of my labor."

If that's correct and the aluminum strips are bent flat, just bend them back into shape.  My packs with this type of arrangement have the strips in pockets/channels that will allow you to pull them out, get them flat and start over - it may be that you have a double-bend or twist causing it to curve badly or something.

It's worth staying at the hostel just to experience the place and chat with Oliver.  The hostel itself was a working Dude Ranch that was on GNP property before it became a park. Lots of history there! I got to stay at the hostel when the adult children of one of the men who worked the Dude Ranch were visiting. Had some great times and learned a lot about their family and their history with GNP. Apparently Oliver got to see them all grow up; it was one big family and everyone had a great time.

And that includes almost everything, all the way down to a decent flashlight for the trail and a shirt I'll be comfortable in southern summer heat. Fortunately a large amount of that was covered by presents from my recent birthday, and I already own maybe $50-$75 worth of gear from camping. I also found some amazing deals by luck, a friends employee discount at sports academy, and the amazing Sierra Trading Post / Amazon. There are still things on my wishlist, but once I get my shoes I'll be more than ready for a multi day hike"

backpacking,3di3ij,zarzak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:13:29 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you, but there really isn't too much though involved.  If you have a backpack get that out, otherwise invest in one (buy something cheap, light, and with good hip support to start).  Get a light 1-2 person tent, a sleeping bag, and a pad.  You'll need water (nalgenes or a hydration bladder), food, a change of clothes or two (dependent on how long you want to be out), a flashlight, and something to make a fire.  Go out to your nearest trail/park that allows camping, grab a map, and just start walking.  You'll probably want to start with just a weekend: go out saturday morning, camp saturday night, walk back sunday.  See how that goes, and go from there. :)"
backpacking,3dihz5,Sandysham,2,Thu Jul 16 15:24:41 2015 UTC,"Go get fitted by someone who knows what they're doing, simple as that. We could recommend a dozen different packs but none may fit you properly. Packs are always something that should be tried on and fitted in store while under load to make sure you get the correct fit even more so if you're starting from nothing, no way around it unfortunately. I work in an outdoor retailer and the number of people I see coming into store having brought badly fitting packs and wanting out expertise to get something that does fit is astounding."
backpacking,3dho9f,texel23,4,Thu Jul 16 10:29:17 2015 UTC,"Im not against big packs but ill give you some counterpoints: It weighs more. It may be more prone to snagging on trees as you walk by. It may have a poor vertical weight distribution due to everything sitting at the bottom (compression straps may fix this) More expensive. Can psychologically influence you to pack things you dont need.  Harder to access stuff at the bottom when needed quickly. May restrict your ability to look up With more fabric against you it may be hotter in warm weather. It could affect your ability to run or jog to a larger degree than a small bag. Doesnt look as normal as a small bag if you want to use it around the city or for a day pack. Depending on what you like to do and how light you go it may be used almost solely in conditions a smaller bag would be fine in.  In my personal opinion, my max pack size for anything besides expedition mountaineering would be 45L. I would use 45L for through hikes or trips over 3 days and my 30L pack for any trip up to 3 days. I really cant see a reason to use anything Over 45/50 unless your going unsupported for multiple days and have climbing/Cold weather gear."
backpacking,3dho9f,d1ly,2,Thu Jul 16 11:28:49 2015 UTC,"this is on point. I hiked with a 55 liter for about 5-6 years, and than I got a new 55 liter and its great. I recently bought the 85 liter in the exact same model as my new pack. I went so large, not to carry more but to internally pack everything. I can pack 60 lbs of gear (I guide so I carry more than most) inside my pack and nothing is exposed. This just a personal thing, i would recommend it to most. 50 Ltr is a good max to stand by. Also to your point on cold weather, my pack is generally a lot smaller because i am wearing everything, the only change of clothing I use is my base layer and socks.     Good luck out there."

backpacking,3dho9f,Eve91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:17:31 2015 UTC,"Yes. I fit my tent, sleeping bag, and everything else in my bag with lots of room to spare, but i pack fairly minimal and have an ultralight shelter. Im using the MLD duomid as my shelter, and the western mountaineering summerlight sleeping bag. Besides those big items i have, lightweight rain jacket and pants, down jacket, first aid/emergency kit, toiletries, head lamp, and bear spray. With my sleeping pad and trekking poles on the outside. I pack small and have less comfort but i find a small pack more appealing. So if you want more comfort such as a fleece jacket/bigger sleeping bag/more robust tent, just scale to 40L. And even more then that maybe to 50L. But in my opinion if you need more than 50L, then you are simply taking too much with you and should focus more on cutting back. It will be more comfortable and it will help your knees for the future."
backpacking,3dho9f,d1ly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:42:45 2015 UTC,"I think I'm using a 45 L now. It's not big anyway, but I don't know the actual size because it was my mom's and it doesn't say on there. (I also can't find if it's still made.) So you don't take cooking gear or food?  My tent is pretty big and heave (3.8 kg! it was a price / carrying comfort consideration...), my sleeping bag is in the middle (haglÃ¶fs tarius -5) and my sleeping mat is super small. Rest of the space is taken up by toiletries, towel, stove and a pan, food and water, and some small things like a knife, firesteel/lighter, sunglasses, hat, headlamp if the season/place calls for it, pack of playing cards, mug, stuff like that adds up."
backpacking,3dho9f,Eve91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:20:36 2015 UTC,"I dont take cooking gear because i find it takes up too much room, so i just bring cold food. Nuts, Trailmix, Dried fruit, energy bars, maybe some sandwiches for day 1, beef jerky, among other things. My tent weight only 1.5lbs and my sleeping bag 1.2 lbs. If it is colder i can just bring a heavier sleeping bag and some toque/gloves/down parka. But i will still keep my base pack weight under 12 lbs. But its really true that most weight and space savings come from a smaller tent, 3.8kg sounds really heavy."

backpacking,3dcekl,ToriBearJones,2,Wed Jul 15 04:22:32 2015 UTC,"I think of a flashlight/headlamp as a nessesity, it allows me to be functional for 24 hours a day and it provides a safety net in case i need to bail. Also its just nice to be able to see at night. Lime if you need to go to the bathroom or check out that scary noise. Plus my headlamp is only 4oz, has over 100 hour run time, and is relatively small(black diamond reVolt). My pack is ultralight (9lbs) but i still include the flashlight, if that says anything about how i value it. And for the poncho, ive honestly never used one but i see people use them all the time, and they seem to do well. even through hikers."
backpacking,3dcekl,d1ly,2,Wed Jul 15 11:27:18 2015 UTC,"I just have a small keychain light that I use, I stopped carrying a headlamp. I keep thinking ""I should bring my headlamp"", but I haven't needed it in over a year. Trail walking at night, headlamp or no, is a good way to trip.    Most people love them though, and I have some myself, I just never bring them. Get one of the cheap energizer versions for $10. See if you can find one that takes AAA's to keep it lighter.   Good idea on the poncho. Even for serious stuff, I use an umbrella, goretex rain pants, and a wind-jacket (not waterproof). If I'm stopped I can stay dry in the tent, and if I'm moving I can stay dry under the umbrella, and I'll sweat too much in a real rain jacket.  If it's raining, it's not that cold."
backpacking,3dcekl,buttholiness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:01:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely a headlamp over a conventional flashlight, I'm quite happy with my Black Diamond Spot, the Storm and ReVolt models are quite popular too. Poncho should be fine for summer especially if it doesn't rain much, you can always hang out for end of summer clear out sales which should start in a month or two before Autumn/Winter, that should allow you to snag a pretty good bargain compared."

I don't ever plan to be on the trail at night, but things don't always go according to plan. I carry a cheap emergency poncho for summer hikes in the PNW and a proper rain shell all other times of the year. Check geartrade.com for great prices on used gear and returns from backcountry.com.

Made it to the peak at dawn, was an amazing sunrise.  Bring lots of cash for stuff along the way. Each station charges to stamp your souvenir walking stick.  You'll want to buy hot coffee from the vending machines and O2 canisters near the peak.  I got altitude sickness pretty badly near the top and didn't stay that long because I didn't bring enough money for oxygen.

Basically, it's a device (albeit a pricey one) that allows you to be located in the backcountry if needed.  It sends out a signal to the company which then sends a signal to police/SAR/rescue.  The spot device is useful in that you can send ""hey, I'm good!"" messages without getting the police involved.  But yeah - I've never had a problem and I started backpacking at about your age, and then started going solo.  My mom still is never thrilled when I go out alone (she actually really appreciates now that I have a dog - despite the dog being all of 30lbs - who growls at things outside the tent at night) even just for day hikes.  But honestly, for a first trip - certainly go with a buddy, make sure you tell your parents/other people where you're going, maybe take something like a wilderness first aid course if your parents are really freaked.

Speaking purely in facts:    The odds of sexual violence happening to you is much higher from someone you know (https://www.rainn.org/statistics). So purely from a math prospective, the farther you get from people you know, the safer you become, in that regard. Most backpackers are decent people. You've eliminated a lot of shitty elements of society ~10 miles into the backcountry. It's not to say that everyone in the woods is some decent fellow, but to date I've never seen anyone bad more than a couple of miles from a trailhead.  ""The woods"" is a little bit of a misnomer. We're not talking about people's backyards and illegal hunters on quads slamming six packs. I'm usually in designated wilderness areas that really only allow foot traffic, and they are a long way off from people's residences.    Worry about hypothermia, busted ankles, rats chewing through your pack, lightning, bear safety (don't obsess, just do it) and car accidents on the way there and back.

backpacking,3dc65j,fatalexe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:04:34 2015 UTC,"Same advice as anyone.  Make sure to store your food away from your camp site, up in a tree or a bear proof container.  Go with a friend and make sure you stick to your itinerary that you have filed with a family member or friend.  Always carry a map of the area your in and a compass, know how to use them.    Bear spray is probably the best form of self defense you can carry. If you do decide to carry it learn how to use it with a dummy canister as being downwind of it is not very fun.

The Ice Age Trail is well maintained, highly traveled and nearby. If your father's concern is that you will get lost or hurt, the Ice Age is a good beginner trail with lots of veteran hikers (in my experience, hikers are a very kind and friendly group) to offer help. If your father's concern is some creep taking advantage of young women, I second the bear mace, for bears and creeps.  Above all else, prepare yourself, train.

backpacking,3daoz2,AKA_Squanchy,5,Tue Jul 14 20:48:01 2015 UTC,You're safer in almost all of western Europe than just about anywhere else in the world.    The hostels there are safe.
backpacking,3daoz2,Haz606,2,Tue Jul 14 21:32:58 2015 UTC,"Carry your valuables at all times. Use a money belt for cash and cards to avoid pickpockets. Use a daily-dummy wallet that you wouldn't mind losing if you were to be pickpocketed. I left my backpack on my bed, unzipped, full of dirtyish clothes and no one ever touched it, because why would they want anything in it? Valuables in daypack, then you know they're safe. I have never had any problems in a hostel other than a filthy one in Paris and another filthy one in San Jose, Costa Rica (although the staff was very friendly there)."
backpacking,3daaya,alertalerta,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:52:38 2015 UTC,I'm in India and the only legit option we have here for gear is Decathlon. I can swear by their products. Pretty much all the gear I own is from them.
backpacking,3daaya,s18m,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:58:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the rest of the world but decathlon is BIG in France. Except for the high end products, they offer a great bang for buck and almost everybody buys from them here.  I have the former version of this one: http://www.decathlon.fr/sac-a-dos-forclaz-40-air-id_8243262.html and I'm 100 % satisfied with it (I bought it second hand for 20 euros), however my brother bought this one : http://www.decathlon.fr/sac-a-dos-forclaz-50-id_8300838.html and I find it highly impractical and not comfortable so I wouldn't advise you to go for the cheaper."
backpacking,3dalc6,ray12515,2,Tue Jul 14 20:02:23 2015 UTC,Laurel Highlands area is nice. A little out of the way. Just look up Laurel Ridge Trail
backpacking,3dalc6,fluffyangel88,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:17:03 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll check it out
backpacking,3d9nw8,Sinkacy,2,Tue Jul 14 16:15:14 2015 UTC,Ryanair will stand their ground. Do not think for a second that they will look the other way. You have to find another bag.  Have you considered travelling by train through Europe and then check your luggage only for the few times you need to fly?
backpacking,3d9nw8,emilvikstrom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"I've never had problems with Ryanair even with a loaded 50L pack, but maybe its more about the airport staff."
backpacking,3d9nw8,Kolle12,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:23:26 2015 UTC,"Flew with ryan air recently and people were carrying large bags, even 2 per person. I was carrying a suit bag and an oversized bag and they didn't say anything.   I think it also matters where are you flying from. If people abuse it, they might apply stricter rules there  I think you will be fine tbh."
backpacking,3d9nw8,AMAIamaHuman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:59:59 2015 UTC,Do you think you can squish the bag 1cm? Should be okay if it's not the frame that is that long.
backpacking,3d9nw8,breakinbread,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:52:08 2015 UTC,7cm too deep means you're probably out of luck unless it reliably compresses below 20cm.   How often will you fly?  I have a dedicated budget airline backpack that was Â£20 and is the size permitted.
backpacking,3d765p,throwwayasdfg1,19,Tue Jul 14 01:27:48 2015 UTC,It says very clearly that it's a loud type of place. You retard.   I couldn't help but laugh at this one. The amount of unproffessionalism was just so abrupt and blunt.
backpacking,3d765p,TheFrozenEmpire,0,Tue Jul 14 02:18:25 2015 UTC,"Well the amount of ignorance to complain that people party until 2am (so not even that late) in a Hostel is surprising. For a French, this reply was adequately polite ;)"
backpacking,3d765p,quassy,6,Tue Jul 14 13:58:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe the review writer was ignorant. But callimg someone a retard, middle school level name calling, on a public review site everyone considering becoming a customer can see, just shows this guy gives no fucks"
backpacking,3d765p,TheFrozenEmpire,12,Tue Jul 14 16:55:05 2015 UTC,"""You were given the bed you booked and you had a ball.""  If nothing else, this is entertaining."
backpacking,3d765p,tmfxl,8,Tue Jul 14 04:11:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, that says a lot about them. I would never stay there - but it's ok, I'm apparently too old for them anyway.  I think we both know that at your mid thirties age, you were too old to stay here."
backpacking,3d765p,Nymphetamean,3,Tue Jul 14 03:15:31 2015 UTC,Their age said 25-30 anyway it was weird.
backpacking,3d765p,Shagglet,6,Tue Jul 14 17:52:57 2015 UTC,This also reminds me of the Blue Sky Hostel debacle.
backpacking,3d765p,MryddinWilt,2,Tue Jul 14 08:47:11 2015 UTC,"Haha,  I was thinking about this article too.  I actually stayed there in September and that place was one fun shit hole"
backpacking,3d765p,dannsd,3,Tue Jul 14 16:05:10 2015 UTC,"Haha, holy shit. I'd never go there."
backpacking,3d765p,Nebuchadnezzar-II,3,Tue Jul 14 12:41:35 2015 UTC,"Wow - thanks for the post, I know where NOT to stay in France."
backpacking,3d765p,GetLostAndBeFound,3,Tue Jul 14 13:09:52 2015 UTC,It all depends on how they reply to comments. I'd love to see people complaining about fat hairy men in the dorms get called out. I saw a LOT of reviews like this when I was backpacking around SEA to the point I'd just sort by negative first to see how many were complaining about other guests.   Fat hairy men need a place to sleep too! I've ran into a bunch in hostels and they were always super nice so I don't have anything against them.
backpacking,3d765p,chacochaco,2,Tue Jul 14 06:15:59 2015 UTC,"This took a turn! I thought it was going to be about the type of people leaving negative reviews! In my experience certain nationalities don't seem to understand what a hostel is and will leave reviews like ""I had to share a bathroom!"". I always sort by negative review first because they are the most telling."
backpacking,3d765p,MryddinWilt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:40:31 2015 UTC,"Americans get ""hostel"" and ""hotel"" mixed up some times. No joke people here really don't know what a hostel is because they aren't popular over here."
backpacking,3d765p,Sloppy_Twat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:36:14 2015 UTC,Hostels are practically non-existent in America. It's a tragedy really. (But I wasn't actually thinking of Americans)
backpacking,3d765p,MryddinWilt,2,Tue Jul 14 22:19:45 2015 UTC,Well guess you cant stay there if you are 30.   fucking twats.
backpacking,3d765p,Im_not_lonely,2,Tue Jul 14 13:46:55 2015 UTC,I think it's the hostels 'schtick'.
backpacking,3d765p,MMABouncer,2,Tue Jul 14 14:14:36 2015 UTC,"These are pretty funny! In all seriousness though, I always search by lowest ratings. Once you get past the ones that clearly are the fault of the customer, they can really shed light on the possible experience you may have. I took a look at one when going to Miami and a recurrent theme in the lowest reviews were your dorm would either be way too humid, or way too cold. I ended up staying there for a tight and could definitely tell what they meant. If the AC was on, the room was frigid and the sheets weren't thick enough to be warm. If the AC was off it was really wet."
backpacking,3d765p,ziplock1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"lol, well I guess they know their target market.  If it annoys you, maybe you aren't in their target ;)  Are you in Lyon for awhile?  There is a meetup group that you can join if so: http://www.meetup.com/Lyon-Digital-Nomads-Meetup/"
