By all means, disconnect the battery just in-case and give it a good clean but that's all you really need to do. My dad has a pristine Honda Repsol sat in his garage and doesn't ride it until its summer time as he's a 'fair weather biker'. Not to mention the 1957 Norton 500cc that's sat for 10's of years and only needs an oil change every now and then :)"
ft86,3e5ybo,Gnarlos86,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:21:10 2015 UTC,"Oft will be a great option for what you have.   If you go with an ecutek tune and get a good custom tune on a dyno you will probably get a couple more hp, but not a lot.   If you buy an aftermarket intake you will want to adjust your tune for it. The benefit of oft is you can do this yourself with a bit or research and work. Yes it is terrifying flashing your car with maf scaling you made yourself, but personally I loved it when I have been able to take my car to the track a couple times and run a tune I adjusted and everything worked out fine.   As for e85, no other stuff needed unless you want to go flex fuel. Make sure you read a good bit about that sort of thing in the forums before you dive into it."

ft86,3e0hr9,Treanimal,5,Tue Jul 21 00:37:33 2015 UTC,"FT86Club Forums have an exhaust compilation thread. If you're new to the BRZ, check out the ""Basic Bolt on mods intake, exhaust tuning guide"" and you'll discover that there's more than just a catback to consider. If you're looking for a quiet system, start looking at the Invidia Q300 and the Nameless Performance axle back.   You'll find that the build quality of the Nameless exhaust is outstanding, but be prepared to wait. I ordered mine in May and haven't received it yet. :("
ft86,3e0hr9,subtly_irritated,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:24:34 2015 UTC,I'm new to the Brz and I'm also new to modding in general. Thanks for the tips.
ft86,3e0hr9,tofufa20,3,Tue Jul 21 03:14:40 2015 UTC,"I have the Perrin 2.5"" non resonated exhaust on my stock BRZ and it sounds amazing in my opinion. I was looking for the same thing, something to give the car a little more oomph, yet not be a fart can or obnoxious. Perrin also has a resonated version that may be a little less raspy and a little more tame which I think would still be great on the car.   Here's a clip on YouTube of what it sounds like. It's a little bassy at startup but quiets down quite a bit at idle. http://youtu.be/_pHhoUwmXAs  This video is an unboxing, install and review: http://youtu.be/0r9ytUxCQqM (video is a little outdated as they don't sell the stealth black version anymore and I think they stopped producing the front pipe as well, but double check on that if you plan on going header back in the future)  My only gripe is that after installing the exhaust and it being positioned correctly, the left tip sticks out a couple centimeters more than the right. I guess driving it shifted it a little and I've been too lazy to go back under to adjust. Hope this helps your search :)"
ft86,3e0hr9,gALLARDO262,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:39:42 2015 UTC,The Perrin system is one that I've heard about. It seems to be what I'm looking for. I'm not quite sure what resonated and non-resonated means. It would be great if you (or anyone) could give me a short explanation.
ft86,3e0hr9,gMit,3,Tue Jul 21 03:17:20 2015 UTC,"I have the 3 inch perrin catback on my frs with the resonator, the resonator is a part of the mid pipe that has baffles,  it reduces rasp and quiets the exhaust down a little, if you like rasp don't get the resonator or vice versa :)"
ft86,3e0hr9,Itsinthefrakkinship,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:20:33 2015 UTC,"If you're after something deeper, the 3"" resonated Perrin cat back is the way to go. Its deep and mature. Not obnoxious at normal driving conditions but when WOT, man it sounds amazing.  Installed one on my BRZ three weeks ago  EDIT: I haven't noticed any drone"
ft86,3e0hr9,tofufa20,2,Tue Jul 21 07:07:13 2015 UTC,"I second this. This is what I have and honestly I would go 3"" resonated over 2.5"" resonated if you went with Perrin. To add on to resonators, I read that it helps muffle the exhaust. So if you added headers to a 3"" upresonated exhaust, it would be way louder. After driving with the 3"" resonated, I think it's perfect, with that being said I think the 2.5"" resonated would be too quiet. With stock radio up to about 75% you can hear the 3"" reso hum. Turn down the radio to about 25% and you get the full enjoyment of the exhaust singing. I had got a good deal on my exhaust too so I couldn't pass it up. (Bought my exhaust the day I got home from the dealership)"
ft86,3e0hr9,Itsinthefrakkinship,2,Tue Jul 21 13:15:01 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about the 3"" but since I don't plan on going forced  induction I went with the 2.5"".

ft86,3e0hr9,Magzter,3,Tue Jul 21 05:10:12 2015 UTC,"Also something to point out, anything will sound better than the stock exhaust. Just look at the videos on ft86 club website. I had been listening to them before I got the car and listened to like 4 different exhaust videos a day.  Picked my favorite ones out the group. Rinse and repeat until I finished all the videos. I did this just so I can have a clear hearing because after a while the exhaust could start sounding similar. Just take your time."

ft86,3dycla,Teku18,5,Mon Jul 20 19:09:33 2015 UTC,"There are no touch screens that work by detecting heat, from an engineering perspective, it would make little sense to make such a device because as you correctly stated, it would be too easily affected by outside factors (i.e. weather). The touch screen technology available on your phone is probably capacitive (because resistive touch screens do not offer multi-touch technology), and if I'm not mistaken I think the touch screen for the FR-S and BRZ are resistive. As to OP's problem, it seems like the dealer is your best bet."

ft86,3duuhp,canned_soup,23,Sun Jul 19 18:20:08 2015 UTC,You should really move a front tire to the back and move the spare to the front.
ft86,3duuhp,DocterH,14,Sun Jul 19 18:39:08 2015 UTC,Came here to make sure someone said this.
ft86,3duuhp,ChrisW41182,8,Sun Jul 19 19:19:57 2015 UTC,I was just thinking that too. I'm going to do that right now.
ft86,3duuhp,PublicSealedClass,7,Sun Jul 19 18:41:29 2015 UTC,"I know that sounds like the most sensible thing to do, but for those of us who are unaware, what is the reason for this?  For example a sound reasoning (to me anyway) would be to ensure you have maximum traction and control available on the front wheels at all times (since they steer and stop you), rather than the drive wheels. And although you might not accelerate as harsh as you normally would with all 4 corners on the right wheels, there's a chance you may need to stop very quickly and in a controlled manner.  EDIT:thanks for the responses. Risk of differential damage is the main reasoning it seems. I guess even if you don't have a need to stamp on the brakes on your trip to the tire shop, then there's a higher certainty that you'll cause undue continuous stress on the diff (especially if you have an uphill journey I'd imagine)."
ft86,3duuhp,3365CDQ,10,Sun Jul 19 20:00:15 2015 UTC,"Toy tech here.  You are not wrong, the front wheel do have more breaking power then the rear and they also steer you. But scion (owner manual) say that you should put the spare on the front and take the regular wheel to put it on the rear if needed. (flat on the rear for exemple).  The reason behind this is your spare wheel is smaller then your regular wheel so if you put in on your drive wheels it will be harsh for your differential. This is why you put your spare on the rear for a FWD and on the front for a RWD.  sorry for my english it's not my mother tongue."
ft86,3duuhp,18-24-61-B-17-17-4,5,Sun Jul 19 20:09:25 2015 UTC,The diameter of the spare and the regular are the same though.  Held my spare up against the stocks and it's dead on the same.      I agree that the manual does say to put the spare in the front though.
ft86,3duuhp,ChrisW41182,6,Mon Jul 20 00:03:29 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, it's the difference between the size of each wheel. Because the car is rear wheel drive, having equal sized wheels on both sides makes sure that no damage is done to the differential.   Like I said, that's my understanding.  Edit: source"
ft86,3duuhp,18-24-61-B-17-17-4,5,Sun Jul 19 20:05:41 2015 UTC,Same diameter overall of wheel/tire between the spare and the stocks though.  Held my spare up against the stocks and it was dead on.
ft86,3duuhp,Xanzent,3,Mon Jul 20 00:04:33 2015 UTC,"While you lose braking power, and you may lose steering power, what you gain is predictability.   When the front goes on a car you can let off the gas or give a tap of the brakes to regain traction. It's much more predictable and easy to control. When the rear goes you can end up swapping ends or otherwise completely losing control.   Granted, the nannies do a good job of keeping the car straight assuming you have them on, but it still makes sense to ensure full traction on the rear for stability purposes."

ft86,3dwf22,Sivart99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:12:44 2015 UTC,sounds like you might just need the GPS module/antenna to attach to the head unit.  do you know what model the head unit is?  EDIT: this means you would also need the maps installed on your head unit.

ft86,3dwf22,dphizz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:56 2015 UTC,Oh what do you mean a new bracket o.o would this be cheaper to do at a dealer or perhaps a shop ? I'm kinda too retarded to trust myself to do it
ft86,3dwf22,dphizz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:52 2015 UTC,"i know how you feel. Honestly, it is was a real easy install. I have done it myself with no prior DIY experience. You just need to take the dashboard trim pieces off. You can use a flathead or just your hands as they are plastic and will pry off fairly easily  Then you just need a philips screwdriver and a 10mm ratchet to unscrew the brackets from both the car and the head unit. If your head unit is setup like mine, it will just require 4 screws. However, the current brackets are not ""big enough"" for the head unit and the NAV unit. Typically, I have seen most people sell the nav unit with the bigger brackets. You might need the GPS antennae as well. I am trying to find the thread I found where it gave a step-by-step on how to do this. In the meantime, here is an older thread of when people did exactly what you wanted to do: ft86 forums DIY Navigation Unit  All of the wiring is pretty plug and play. It would be a lot cheaper to just find the parts yourself and do the install. With the right set of tools, it is less than 10 minutes. If you are in SoCal, i'd do it for you; it is so easy."

Most track-day organizers (that I've used) have self-inspection.  Essentially no one double checks your work but you sign a document indicating that you have inspected your car and everything is up to snuff.  The form usually has very specific requirements on it: 3/32""+ left on tires, 3mm or more left on brake pads, fluids changed within the typical periods."
ft86,3dt8dr,YouShallKnow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:09:18 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly new to this stuff but here's something's I've learned so far!  Usually they'll have a form you take with you to a shop that inspects it and they'll tell you anything that needs to be done. You'll definitely need a helmet. If you're buying one try to get the newest model, they become obsolete after 5 years. You'll have to have your brake fluid changed and put in synthetic. Brakes checked and make sure your tires have enough tread left. I'd bring some extra oil and brake fluid with me as well to the track just in case. Have everything out of your car, or at least as much as you can, before you get to the track. Have a smartphone or pen/paper at the track to write down what you need to know and what times you need to be where.   And you do not need a special license.   That's all I can think of, have fun!"

I stopped so I wouldn't hit the dog, but the truck behind me was not far enough from me and rear-ended my car. Haven't heard from the estimators but it looks like a write-off.  Make sure to buy replacement insurance, kids! You never know what might happen. Luckily I did but it still hurts to lose your baby :("
ft86,3dpneh,QuickStopRandal,7,Sat Jul 18 06:00:48 2015 UTC,"I know Reddit hates ""blame the victim"" stuff, but this is more cautionary advice to others:  This is why you should do whatever you can to shake tailgaters and inattentive (texting) drivers. Change lanes, drive slower so they go around you, etc. Most people have no concept of how to handle a vehicle in a situation requiring maximum tire grip, so don't be around them when they learn that lesson.  The best approach to driving is to assume everyone around you will do the dumbest shit possible at any moment.  edit: why the fuck was this downvoted?  OK, shitheads, let someone total your car and then cry victim about it, that'll buy you a new one.  Morons."

I used to struggle with the same thing in my 93 RX-7."
ft86,3doqul,Sivart99,3,Sat Jul 18 00:33:27 2015 UTC,"I am running the same setup! Stage 1, 93oct. It's DEFINITELY worth the $500, just don't get your hopes too too high. It helps a bit with the torque dip, but I mainly noticed gains in the 4-5k rpm range. Also helped my MPG by about 2, and the idle is much smoother. I plan to go UEL headers soon with stage 2. Enjoy!"
ft86,3doqul,patrickswayzelives,3,Sat Jul 18 01:18:54 2015 UTC,"With Openflash's OTS 93 tunes, the torque dip is significantly lessened. You need to combine it with a header to completely get rid of it.  The speed gains aren't otherwise really enough to feel. That's basically the case with any tune that isn't customized for your specific car -- it's made to be safe, not to push limits. It is a very nice base to custom tune for yourself, though, if you're brave and have some time to research how to do so.  VVT changes create a very specific ""roar"" around the torque dip area, some people hate it others love it.  Add on a header and E85, and you'll be up around 200whp peak for a very noticeable change."
ft86,3doqul,scalablecory,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:31:29 2015 UTC,Can you tell me the cons to running e85 ?
ft86,3doqul,scalablecory,5,Sat Jul 18 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"Without a proper flex fuel kit, cold starts are a bit problematic. If it's cold where you are (think 50 degrees) you might need to crank the engine twice before it'll start. Once it's going or if the engine is already warm, you're fine.  There's also a thought that you should change your oil after 3,000 miles rather than 7,500, because you're pushing about 30% more fuel on E85 and it breaks oil down differently than 93. Jury is out if this is actually needed, I don't think anyone has sent their oil in for analysis yet.  One person has had catastrophic failure of their fuel filter while running E85, though we've got a number of people running it permanently, year-round, and doing HPDE with it without any problems. Probably wasn't caused by E85.  Some people also think it'll melt all your o-rings and other rubber pieces but afaik that hasn't happened to anyone, even the long-term users."

ft86,3doqul,ckim78,3,Tue Jul 21 04:28:01 2015 UTC,I had the OFT and a UEL header when I had a BRZ.  Header made a huge difference with regard to getting rid of the torque dip.  I think the biggest difference I noticed with the OFT was the throttle mapping.
ft86,3doqul,Chrisporterhp,3,Sat Jul 18 03:23:09 2015 UTC,"Have had the tablet about 2 months and love the difference it brings to the car. Stage one flash with TRD exhaust and K&N air filter. Noticed a good bit of MPG on highway for the 2 months  I had it.  Much lower idle, and made exhaust note better. Installed OFH. Only one tank of gas in, and stage 2 tune. Sounds like a beast!  Fantastic rumble, more than I could have asked for. MPG went down about 4 MPG.  I  think I might have a heavier foot to hear that sweet rumble, but it's only been 5 days. Have NO regrets on the purchase."
ft86,3doqul,dphizz,2,Sun Jul 19 05:25:28 2015 UTC,thanks for your comment. I have the exact same setup (TRD exhaust and air filter) and was hoping to get feedback on if the OFT was worth it since I am currently running the stock headers.
ft86,3doqul,CVR12,2,Tue Jul 21 22:14:52 2015 UTC,"Running it with 93 and muffler-less. Pickup is better with foot to floor, nice burbles when downshifting. Not a life changer, but I ordered the OF Headers and am just waiting for them to get in. OFH + OFT + muffler delete seems to get a noticeable improvement to acceleration, or at least feel and sound, from what I read. YMMV."

Here's a few things to keep in mind.    halve your oil change period, e85 is hard on oil it will take 3-4 tanks to get close to e85, you'll see incremental performance increases every fill up until true e85. Your MPG is reduced by about a 1/4.  With the reduced price, e85 tends to be slightly cheaper than premium, or about the same as premium at worst."

I don't know if there are any head unit updates for the new model- I don't believe there are. The biggest downside to it is that there's no individual level control for the sub, so it's always pretty loud. I typically have the lows turned all the way down (i'll bump it up a couple ticks from the bottom occasionally, but will find myself turning it back down when something with a lot more bass comes on). Overall, I'm satisfied with it, since I didn't have to run wires anywhere and it's very easy to take out if I need to. If you're a fan of some decent audio, but not willing to replace all the speakers and everything, it's probably worth it- otherwise, save some money and get one of the 3rd party kits that will replace the door speakers and everything as well."

The doors are pretty good at rattling and the speakers will distort at medium to high volumes pretty badly... so in that sense, sound quality overall does improve with it. I bought new, but didn't custom order, so they found one and I negotiated to get the sub added and that was it. I had it for a few days prior to getting the sub installed, and would have absolutely wanted to do something to improve audio without it... So i'd say the sub (for me) is good enough to fill that gap. Just depends how picky you are about the sound."

ft86,3dnab8,ckim78,2,Sat Jul 18 07:05:32 2015 UTC,"CAI.  The engine is not starved for cold air with the stock airbox -- so it's great in the sense that you really won't get any benefit from a CAI even though the CAI is capable of flowing more air.  No intake maker to date has compared a tuned stock car, to that same car with their intake and a rescaled MAF -- and there's a reason for that. Without slightly off MAF readings or a tune, their intake would look much less impressive."

ft86,3djhsq,ckim78,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:02:01 2015 UTC,really? Would you really tell someone to get a catless header without a tune? That's terrible. The headers aren't gonna do you a whole lot of good without the tune to set the power straight. Air filter is next to pointless in comparison to the gains of the other two. The OFT and OFH are $1000 so that's where the money should go
ft86,3djhsq,XMaximaniaX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:39:25 2015 UTC,"I've had the OFH and I'd probably go with the Tomei if I were going to do it all again. There's a significant difference in quality.   You're eventually going to want a tune, but between the OFT and the header, I'd get the header first.   Granted, this is not what I actually did. I got the OFT first. Then the OFH. Had to run the stage 1 tune with the OFH for a while because my OFT ended up bricked. And then flashed the stage 2 UEL header tune later. There was a bit of a gain up top with the stage 2 tune, but the low end was pretty much all there already with the OFH on stage 1."
ft86,3djhsq,ckim78,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:49:04 2015 UTC,"I understand, but my point was that if you're spending $1k cash on mods, it would be pointless to get the headers without the tune, especially if you're substituting an air filter for the tune. I just used OFH as an example because it'll equal roughly 1k if you pair it with a OFT. Plus the OFT headers tune is optimized for the OFH. The tune is gonna unlock the potential of the headers. Otherwise without the Tablet, you'll get incremental gains with a nicer sound, and that's about it. The filter isn't gonna do much if anything."

ft86,3dj6sp,CrazyMike366,2,Sun Jul 19 22:56:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, $6,000 coilovers...is that even a thing?! These as much as your typical forced induction setups. Holy shit. I don't see how these are worth the price. Even if they're the best, I'll bet some other coilovers come at least close to these at less than half the price"
ft86,3dj6sp,XMaximaniaX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:00:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Most people don't actually need that level of adjustability and re-buildability (is that a word?), nor can they actually take advantage of it.   I'm sure a much more affordable coilover system with fewer adjustments that won't need to be rebuilt or re-tuned often is fine for most of us. Something like an AST 4150 or KW-V3's will be fine or even overkill.  But in a dedicated racing series with caps on power, weight, etc by class or time attack where squeezing another extra ounce of power out of the engine may not be possible or economical, the precious seconds gained from optimizing the rebound and damping exactly right for the surface is worth the steep cost.  I remember that Sport Compact Car (RIP) did a comparison test between off-the-shelf street coilovers and a set of custom Moton coilovers on their project Evo. The difference - both subjective feel and objective lap times - was non-negligible. Lap times were reduced by several whole seconds and the standard deviation in lap times shrunk with no other changes. I wish I could find the article, but it's buried in the archival Russian nesting dolls that have become Sport Compact Car, Modified Mag, Super Street, and whatever the hell it is now."
ft86,3dj6sp,CrazyMike366,2,Mon Jul 20 06:31:48 2015 UTC,"wow, I guess I never realized that there setting up a coilover system was that nuanced. I just assumed you bought whatever felt good, threw it on, and called it a day. Now that I look a bit more into it, it's quite complicated. I can see why things like custom valving and damping with adjustablity might fetch a higher price"
ft86,3dj6sp,XMaximaniaX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:36:52 2015 UTC,"Tein SRC.  You don't need to be a fast driver to take advantage of good coilovers; the difference (and improvement) is immediate.  Just how a Porsche will handle better than a FRS, putting on nice coilovers will have a immediate, discernible effect on ride quality and handling.  Another analogy would be saying that even a novice driver will be ""faster"" with more horsepower.  http://counterspacegarage.com/products/suspension/tein-src-brz-frs.html http://counterspacegarage.com/products/suspension/tein-src-csg-spec-brz-frs.html http://counterspacegarage.com/jrz-rs-brz-frs.html  http://counterspacegarage.com/jrz-rs-pro-brz-frs.html"

ft86,3dhz5q,NorcalHPDE,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:54:21 2015 UTC,"I have OEM shocks and an OEM rear sway on my 2015 FR-S.   I now have RE71R tires, but before that I had OEM tires, OEM front sway and OEM front endlinks.  During autocross, all stock, I noticed minimal corner entry understeer, I was dancing with the limits of grip and oversteer mid corner, and just a little too much oversteer on corner exit for my liking.  I upgraded the tires, front sway, and endlinks all at once, so I have yet to fully test this set up on an autocross track. I think I will like it there, but debating about the softer setting on the sway. Those Perrin Endlinks are super stiff, adding to the rigidity of the stiffest sway bar available for the FR-S, Hotchkis 25.4mm hollow.  So what you're saying is that to make my corner entry less understeer prone is to upgrade my shocks? Softer correct? I'm curious if that will knock me out of CS class in autocross. I'd have to look that up."
ft86,3dhz5q,NorcalHPDE,2,Fri Jul 17 12:37:27 2015 UTC,"The way you describe the car stock is how I felt my car handled stock so you'd probably like my settings.  I also have the Hotchkis front bar, and you're gonna want to put the bar on soft. You have stock camber in the front which is going to be the main cause of your understeer so having the bar on stiff might give you feel on the street but on low speed auto x corners you're gonna be hurting.   Because the front suspension has so much camber loss you're gonna want at least 37psi cold to compensate. It's good you have a sway bar/end links because they don't allow as much camber loss but it's still a problem.  If you're autocrossing in c stock you can add oem crash bolts and Koni shocks which I suggest if you want to be competitive. Both require an alignment so you should do them at the same time.  Edit:  If you do Koni shocks you're going to want to do 1/4-1/2 turn from full soft. Front shocks control corner entry and rear shocks control corner exit."

Ive dipped the rims and the rear of my car so I know it holds up well to a beating.  I couldnt source vinyl locally, and doing that center around the shifter would have sucked.   Plastidip was 6 bucks and 45 minutes of my time, mainly spent waiting for things to dry.   I hope to get a red reverse lockout to finish that spot off."

ft86,3dfgyq,markherrington5,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:34:33 2015 UTC,"Your hand doesnt slide on it like the normal plastic. It feels like rubber. The look/grittyness of it depends on how well you apply it. Mine came out relativly smooth. Then again these are on parts your hands dont touch to often.   The inside handle doesnt see too much pull as you grip the backside of that part most of the time.   edit: I started this reply to say that putting glossifier ontop may also help to smooth out the feel and remove the rubber feel, if you wished. I thought about doing it but ive never used the glossifier on any of my sprays so I chose not to."

ft86,3dfsck,CSG_Mike,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:34:44 2015 UTC,"I considered that option but I am frankly done with the FA20, due in no small part to experiences like yours and those of others, not to mention my own.  I love this car overall, but as a guy, not a race team, who wants a track car I can reasonably rely on to drive to and from the track without buying a truck and trailer, and who wants to eventually add power without bringing out even more issues with the engine, I just can't trust the FA20 at this point. Even the money for a nasty letter isn't worth it for the simple reason that a replaced engine is still too risky. That money is better spent making the car reliable.  The car is in the garage for now until the entire powertrain comes out to be replaced with something more suitable for my needs in a track day car."
ft86,3dfsck,gray_with_an_a,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:14:03 2015 UTC,"Well my reasoning behind this is not to get you a replacement engine for you to run, but a replacement for the one that may die on you.  Once that dies, you can always sell your fresh replacement; there's always demand for complete longblocks.  That being said, I think at this point, I can safely say that most of the weaknesses are known and somewhat addressed, depending on what exactly your goals  are.    If you're AutoX'ing competitively, then an engine swap is gonna throw you into an ugly class..."
ft86,3dfsck,CSG_Mike,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:34:04 2015 UTC,"The engine is dead, the warranty manager for the region has visited the car in person and made the company's official call, and I'm done with the powertrain. I hear you, though, I do.  Purely as a side rant, I'm no longer worried about classing as it relates to auto-x because I've exited auto-x due to its extreme time inefficiency. An eight-plus hour day for six or so minutes on course is extremely expensive. The course variety from event to event is great, certainly, but I'm not one to only pay attention to the cheap entry fee. Time matters. Weather exposure matters. Rhythm and flow matter. So much more than just money. So except for the odd fun day event, where I don't care about classing or placement or anything, I'm entirely over to lapping days. For those, I'm in a weird space where my skill level and overall times put me into a run group where I can outcorner but not outrun, and it is harder to develop more skill, and frankly less fun, when I'm constantly trading passes, giving up every passing zone and then being constantly held up everywhere else. I know, I know, first world problems, but at the end of the day the next step is to add at least mild power (as much as I'm not looking to buy lap times) so I can hold better ground within the group and do more work on my times, and I'm not pouring money into an FA20 solution for that. Good money after bad, buying cheap is buying twice, etc. etc. ;)"
ft86,3dfsck,gray_with_an_a,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:10:59 2015 UTC,"It is up to you, as the driver, to make yourself the space.  if you're constantly trading passes, then back off for 10 seconds, let the guy get far enough ahead, that you don't catch up again.  If you do, then you need to let the guy know during the post-session download meeting, that he needs to just back off for one straight, and he'll never see you again.  This is not a run group problem, but rather a driver awareness issue.  You are, unfortunately correct, in that it's a frustrating position to be, since many drivers lean on horsepower for lap times."
ft86,3dfsck,CSG_Mike,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:25:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't get me wrong, I'm definitely backing off, talking with other drivers, etc. I'm just looking for a combination of more reliability and a better match with the run group so I need not spend quite so much time doing said backing off and talking.  To be clear, there are other practical concerns all weighing in on the issue that I haven't mentioned, including things like local support. It has been a very tough decision-making process, balancing lots of factors, so I hope I haven't come across as some kind of FA20 rage quitter."

ft86,3dfsck,colmusstard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:30:48 2015 UTC,"Plenty of things that they can easily see without slicks or numbers or anything like that. First there are the hints of potential usage, like coilovers, wheels and tires, strut bar, etc. Then there are more direct things like rubber on the rims and chassis, brake wear atypical for mileage, etc. Then there's why you are in for service, like a failed injector or a dead engine with three low-compression cylinders. You know, small stuff. ;)"
ft86,3dfsck,gray_with_an_a,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:46:00 2015 UTC,"So if I have a stock car and want to autox say once a month, there really is no way for them to tell, correct?"
ft86,3dfsck,colmusstard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:16:21 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be blunt and say something most others won't. They will tell you that everything will be fine but they haven't had their car in pieces at the dealership with their warranty being voided. I will tell you this: If you can't afford major repairs (say, 10 or 15k) out of pocket, don't autocross or track your car. If you cannot additionally afford all of the various upgrades necessary to make the car survive these activities, don't autocross or track your car. These cars are simply not prepared for or covered by warranty for those uses. Pretend you have no warranty and then decide. Because you don't have a warranty. Not for this."
ft86,3dfsck,gray_with_an_a,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:47:47 2015 UTC,Isn't the whole point of autox to be low cost? Nobody would do it if they had to pay 15k
ft86,3dfsck,colmusstard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:07:04 2015 UTC,"Everyone also thinks it is fifty bucks (or less) but forgets that it takes up your whole day and nets you an average of five or six minutes of time on course, only three for open pax. Auto-x is only cheap if your time is worth little and you don't go mechanical.  I don't want to come across as some kind of asshole, but someone needs to play devils advocate against all of the warranty cheerleaders, and they are strangely everywhere. In fact, they come out with such frequency and force that I really should start assuming either sheer naivety or paid shilling.  I don't want to rain on your parade. I really don't. Auto-x can be super fun. But it's only a cheap sport (as motorsports go) until something breaks, and if your hobby budgeting is not inclusive of failures then you are gonna have a bad time.  To step back from the scary stuff for just a second, you need to remember the general maintenance aspect too. My first year of autocross on this car burned through a set of pads and mostly cooked the rotors, for example. You'll eat tires, though if you drive well you will eat less. You'll want to change oil more frequently. And you will pull far more of that oil through the intake than in general driving, and can (for example) foul plugs faster as a result. At my first service interval, Toyota literally freaked out. With a 10th of the mileage of their other customers I had burned through parts they had not yet ever ordered in. How's that for them being able to guess what you've been doing with the car. ;)  And then you'll start wanting tools and mods. :)  It's great fun. Just go in with your eyes open and your wallet (and heart!) prepared in case things go wrong."
ft86,3dfsck,gray_with_an_a,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:01:52 2015 UTC,When I got my 15 I was told any mod that can cause a problem will void the warranty. So if you put new rims on and your axle snaps for whatever reason then they'll probably try and blame your aftermarket parts before actually fixing the car under warranty.

I often get a feeling that it's somehow blocking airflow to the engine. I'm not sure If I'm right but I'm sometimes scared of my engine not getting enough air. Do you know if the placement can cause serious issues with the engine?  EDIT: Do you have a pic of the custom logo upfront?

ft86,3d46ql,XMaximaniaX,2,Mon Jul 13 15:45:46 2015 UTC,I was always curious on where to get my dash done. I realize we probably don't live in the same area but what kind of shop would do something like that?

There is a handful of shops around me in Cincinnati that do Vinyl work. If you dont have any Vinyl shops nearby.. try tuner garages in the area.. they will usually have one or two guys that can do it. We have Spade Kreations and SourceOne Auto. around me.. but try to find shops like those if you are unable/unwilling to do it yourself.

ft86,3d3zzm,postitpad,-12,Mon Jul 13 17:51:04 2015 UTC,Fold your mirrors in and see how much space it actually saves you.  It doesn't suddenly fold flat.  See for yourself.  My bad you don't understand geometry.
ft86,3d3zzm,My_usrname_of_choice,3,Mon Jul 13 17:54:33 2015 UTC,"Here in Europe, there are a lot of really narrow streets with cars parked on either side. If both cars fold their mirrors and save about 3 inches each, that's an extra 6 inches of space for a car to drive through. Which is definitely helpful. I drive down one of these streets everyday for work and there's barely any room at all"
ft86,3d3zzm,korbor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:27:10 2015 UTC,I thought so too until I took a trip to Frankfurt for work. Fold in mirrors were a nice addition to any rental car I got there.
ft86,3d3zzm,topazsparrow,-2,Mon Jul 13 17:57:49 2015 UTC,"It's all in the geometry.  If the mirrors are big and fold almost flat, well OK, but in the FT86 they barely get any smaller when folded due to the pivot point and the shape of the mirrors."

ft86,3d3zzm,OldSchool9690,3,Mon Jul 13 16:11:53 2015 UTC,I dont think it's about missing features as much as American cars generally don't tend to have headlight washers. It's more of a euro/asian/australian thing
ft86,3d79zs,ASIMAUVE,3,Tue Jul 14 01:58:17 2015 UTC,Straight off the bat you will notice that acceleration is more linear and the engine sounds smoother. There is more power through the rev range but you will probably not notice it. You'll pretty much forget how it used to sound after a few drives.
ft86,3d79zs,Sh1FTy,3,Tue Jul 14 05:00:36 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much it. I've got an OFT on my stock BRZ. I put my stock tune back on last night after reading this and hated the difference in throttle response. With the OFT a dab of throttle is sufficient to keep the car balanced in a corner, but with the stock tune it felt like I had to dig 2/3rds of the way in to have the same effect. It made transitioning from the brake to the gas a bit unsettling, I was used to being able to do that almost seamlessly before.   If you're just cruising around town I wouldn't say it's worth it, if you're doing a lot of back roads, auto crosses, and track days, you'll certainly appreciate it. It's an expensive proposition just for improved throttle response, but there's no going back for me."
ft86,3d79zs,chrono675,2,Wed Jul 15 21:08:34 2015 UTC,"I have only a catback and OFT with stage 1 and it doesn't feel different than before the tune. From what I've read, you won't notice a change unless you switch to Ethanol or new headers. I'll have new headers, front pipe, and overpipe installed in a couple days and I'll try to remember to report back the difference in feel."

Car idled much lower RPM. Felt a much stronger pull at lower RPM. I ordered the headers with it also, but the tablet came a couple weeks before.

ft86,3d79zs,Exolent,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:42:32 2015 UTC,"Well everyone has their own everyone I guess. I didn't notice much in terms of pull so it felt the same. After installing my headers, over pipe and front pipe Thursday with stage 2 tune, it feels so much better."

ft86,3d3mz9,sweetpineapple,2,Mon Jul 13 13:47:06 2015 UTC,Yup. Same hole that the TRD sound changer connects to from the engine bay.   The amount of sound is regulated by the amount of foam in the tubes. Taking out the foam from the pedal side equates to the Red sound changer tube.

ft86,3d3mz9,sweetpineapple,2,Mon Jul 13 19:01:47 2015 UTC,Our FRS/86/BRZ already has the sound pipe into the cabin.   These TRD sound changers are for the tail end of the sound pipe and just modifies the how much noise flows through the existing stock pipe.
ft86,3d3mz9,korbor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:43:26 2015 UTC,"Thats what I thought about the sound already being piped in the cabin, I vaguely remember the dealer mentioning that. So these pipes go in your exhaust to make it more TRD sounding?"

No.   The sound pipe starts from the airbox in the engine bay, going into the car cabin either behind the pedals (RHD) or in the passenger footwell (LHD).  These plastic pipes are installed just before the sound pipe goes into the cabin."

ft86,3d4k8y,markherrington5,2,Mon Jul 13 13:51:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can remove the plate bracket, but there will be holes left in the plastic bumper.  Depending on how badly the dealer mangled the drilling, you may or may not be able to get some paint matched bumper plugs.    If you're really concerned, I would have the dealer remove the plate bracket so you can see the holes before purchase.  If it's bad, you may be able to negotiate and get the dealer to fill and repaint the bumper before you take delivery.  If that's the case, be sure to bring the tow hook plate mount when you pick the car up as some states require the plates to be on the car before the dealers can release it to you.  When I bought my FR-S, the dealer had already installed the plate bracket, and upon removal I found they'd initially mis-drilled the holes using a huge bit, and then drilled the correct ones.  It would have been impossible to plug. When I bought my BRZ I instructed the dealer not to drill the bumper, and thankfully they complied."
ft86,3d4k8y,Kinickie,3,Mon Jul 13 14:31:52 2015 UTC,"Neither the state where I am buying nor the state where I live require front license plates.  The previous owner must have had a decorative plate of some kind.  I would want to take a look at it before I settle on the car, but that seems like a silly thing to not buy a car over.  Hopefully the dealer will be able to fill in the holes before I pick it up."
ft86,3d4k8y,hitthemafia,2,Mon Jul 13 14:40:59 2015 UTC,"You may luck out. When I bought mine only two of the four holes were drilled out, the two in the black plastic grill and not the two on the painted bumper."
ft86,3d4k8y,hitthemafia,2,Tue Jul 14 01:03:09 2015 UTC,I just got it home and took the plate off.  There were only two holes and they were in the black grille.  That will be a a whole hell of a lot easier to cover up than if it was in the paint.
ft86,3d4k8y,khungkhinh,3,Tue Jul 14 05:23:14 2015 UTC,"If it's that big of a deal to you, the black plastic grill is very easy to remove and probably very cheap. You could probably find something cooler looking too."

When we arrived at the dealership after receiving the ""it's here!"" phone call, our hearts sank when we saw a plate bracket attached to the front bumper. They offered to cover the cost of repairing it. The dealership did the calling around to body shops and then found out that it would cost less to buy a new front bumper, paint it, and install it. Needless to say, they took that off of the cost of the car ($500 off)."

Way too many people think they know what they are talking about but only parrot what they have heard. The suspension is great, the only thing you need to worry about is driving the car with traction control on and learn the cars quirks. Invest in some good tires and you'll go far. Its a bit different and might be your first rwd car so pay attention to rain and snow and don't goose it in the corners. Other than that enjoy the car for what it is."

ft86,3d32xb,post_break,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:36:55 2015 UTC,"Looking out for? Corners. Brake before the turn, not during the turn, gas after the turn, not during the turn. As for headlights if you change to say the winjets, you should bake them open and change the projectors to some true HID ones from the retrofit source. Or if you meant you were putting in HIDs in the stock, well again, get the mini quick retrofit lenses and swap them out. There are guides on ft86club. Stock headlights suck, but if you spend money on good projectors you will have some of the best night vision ever. I did mine twice. Once stock, once winjet. Best money I've ever spent on the car."

You can fold the seat and move it forward by pulling the lever close the the floor on the passenger seat. Same thing on drivers side but it doesn't slide (need to use metal bar under seat to slide drivers side)  5) sound tube in both cars.

ft86,3d32xb,khungkhinh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:32:10 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your ownership! I'd like to try to answer some puzzling things for you  2.) Most vehicles will have scheduled maintenance schedules that come along their manuals (in the days when people read). Cars today will have fancy gadgets to remind you but this is a Toyota built for fun and there's no such gadget. Instead you will have to research. Toyota have a schedule for most of their cars but they're lazy and didn't update the FR-5(?) on that page so this will give you an idea. If you are driving in the city halve that amount due to stop and go traffic.  3.) Most coupes (and this one as well) will have something in the back of the seat for passengers to pull on so they can get out and not be stuck in the car. The straps are for such eventualities.  4.) Some FRS comes from the factory with the sound system set for the tC. You can play around with the settings to change it to FRS  5.) The soundtube is for all models, not just exclusive to the BRZ. The engine vocalize after 4k and loves to be in that rev range but unless you change your exhaust system to aftermarket and opens up the pipes diameters it won't be much of a screamer.  6.) This car's blindspots are ridiculous, you'll just have to be more aware when you drive. Like you said it's a driver's car and the only thing you should be concerned about is driving (I'm surprised they even gave us cupholders, looking at you 80s and 90s germans)  8.) the sensor detects electricity as someone here have said before.  9.) I actually didn't even realize alarms are a feature people would want. I suppose if you live in NYC it'd come in handy  Enjoy the car, may your revs ever be high"

ft86,3d31vw,zer0zz0,2,Tue Jul 14 04:44:58 2015 UTC,If you go on amazon they have some ones you can get for about 10$. However if you do the fogs make sure you remove the entire front bumper. It makes the entire process allot easier.

You don't seem to have the dreaded bumper sag that most people get after removing and replacing their front bumper (see here).  I can see why you'd want to remove the bumper though. I've taken mine apart and found that the foglight lamps come out, so you could squeegee the vinyl on much easier that way."
ft86,3d31vw,zer0zz0,2,Tue Jul 14 22:26:29 2015 UTC,Wow I never had that issue. Looks like I got lucky. I just wanted to have good fitment of the yellow fog light covers. Looks like you'll have to replace the hardware once you remove the bumper?
ft86,3d31vw,3dscott,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:02:53 2015 UTC,"I bought mine off premiumautostyling.com. To install them I would highly recommend taking the fog lights off and I did not remove the bumper to do so. It's actually quite simple to do. You just turn the wheel as far as it can go to expose the wheel well, remove some clips and pull the cover back to get to the fog light housing. From there you take off two screws and unclip the fog light and it should pop right out. Also use a hair dryer when installing to keep the vinyl warm and water to help lubricate. There are DIY videos for how to attach vinyl overlays."
ft86,3d31vw,zer0zz0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:51:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, you're the real OP. Embarassing, lol.  I've watched a lot of vinyl/tint videos before. Those professionals make it look easy, but I know it will be very difficult for a beginner. Otherwise, that's great to know that you can access the fog lights without removing the bumper, I don't want to make my bumper sag any worse."

ft86,3d2fl8,iPhantasy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:27:41 2015 UTC,"Obviously it's debatable, but definitely if you run or plan to run forced-induction, you will get blow-by from the increased pressure and that puts oil in places you don't want.  Even without FI there's still some blow-by that puts oil on top of the piston, on the valves, etc where it gets cooked and builds up over time.  If you do decide to pull the trigger, can I suggest a better setup than regular catch can?  I went with the Crawford Air-Oil Separator kit in anticipation of boosting my car soon, and I just really think it's so much better than a can.  It is zero maintenance and puts the separated oil back into the engine instead of collecting it outside where it does no good and has to be drained regularly.  http://www.forgedperformance.com/store/product.php?productid=21449&cat=4067&page=1"

My brz sits fine, I do believe your car has an issue worth investigating. Do you have an autocross club or even circle track shop locally that can get your car on a set of scales and check some cross weights?   My mustang only ever say that bad when it had a broken spring, can you check for that?  Ultimately a set of coil overs will fix the issue and bonus if you get to set it up on a set of scales.

ft86,3cz20c,Timmymartin,4,Sun Jul 12 02:07:00 2015 UTC,I use manual mode and there is a slight pull to slow you down. Around 2k RPM it tends to coast more. Engine breaking occurs better higher than that; around 3-4k.
ft86,3cz20c,PhillipHarass,5,Sun Jul 12 04:11:11 2015 UTC,"I have an automatic too, yes it's engine breaking. If you're used to other automatics, you don't feel this because they don't engage lock up clutch until overdrive. Our transmissions engage the lock up clutch on every gear after 1st, which gives us better response but also engine braking. At least that's what I've read, it definitely feels that way."
ft86,3cz20c,hemegonia,3,Sun Jul 12 07:08:45 2015 UTC,"It rev matches when it downshifts, maybe that's what you're noticing?  I guess you'll need to describe the problem better."

ft86,3cz20c,AccountSave,2,Sun Jul 12 06:48:45 2015 UTC,I have an auto and yeah i feel the engine braking but i tend to take my foot off the accelerator when i paddle shift.
ft86,3cz20c,reggaeradar,2,Sun Jul 12 12:00:58 2015 UTC,"Your engine idles just below 2k rpms. The car will naturally slow down if your foot is off the gas and your revs are above 2k. You're not feeding it gas to run the engine, so it will slow itself down. Its the same with all cars."

ft86,3cv55y,CSG_Mike,3,Sat Jul 11 01:31:25 2015 UTC,"Shiv had this to say about the matter:  ""Increasing the logging rate is easy. But it's a trade off between logging rate and datalog file size. People tend to get caught up with logging rates when there is little or no benifit of logging engine channels once you go beyond a certain rate. It's not like we are datalogging formula one cars here. But to be fair, once you start logging things like G sensors, faster rates may be useful. And if that turns out to be the case, we will adjust the logging rate accordingly."""

OFT records 14 channels at 10hz for a total rate of 140hz; the Solo DL settings I use when I coach polls at ~1700hz in the FRS.  When I'm in a Ferrari or GTR, I'm polling at ~4200hz.  I'm saying it's perfectly useable for monitoring an engine, but not enough for driving analysis.  No butthurt here; I'm just stating facts.  CSG is not an EcuTek dealer/tuner/whatever."
ft86,3cv55y,CSG_Mike,-2,Sat Jul 11 02:33:32 2015 UTC,"the Solo is another $400 for a dedicated unit, we're talking about functionality rolled out to a product that was already purchased for a stacked list of other functions  the comparison is nonsense and you know it  also  http://counterspacegarage.com/products/intake-exhaust/ecutek-pro-kit-license-cable.html"
ft86,3cv55y,BRZ4ME,2,Sat Jul 11 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"Actually, you need a Solo DL, not a Solo for those functions, which is $700.  CSG resells licenses for those that need it; they're selling licenses from DT or JR, depending on what it's for.  The licenses aren't CSG's."
ft86,3cv55y,CSG_Mike,6,Sat Jul 11 03:35:09 2015 UTC,Mike makes a valid point that pertains to those of us that prefer real live numbers and you make a crack about Ecutek vendors being butt hurt.  Grow up.  Just because someone points out a products shortcoming doesn't mean they are doing it out of personal agenda.  OFT is not really that useful for those of us that track the cars or push them to the point to where accurate real time numbers for later or live analysis are preferred.

I have two buckets. 1st one is filled with about 12 microfiber cloths folded in quarters pre soaked in the water with carwash soap. 2nd bucket is for the dirty towels. You basically wipe down each quarter of a towel until it gets dirty(usually 3-4 wipes for me) then switch to a new quarter until all quarters are dirty, then toss it int he 2nd bucket. continue with new towels until done.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws59CEYUpC0"

ft86,3cmxj0,spicyricecake,2,Thu Jul 9 04:21:43 2015 UTC,How's the new display screen?
ft86,3cmxj0,spicyricecake,2,Thu Jul 9 06:14:13 2015 UTC,I haven't played with the older ones. This one seems good. It's very responsive. The camera quality is just OK... But it's better than nothing.
ft86,3cmxj0,roninsascha,2,Thu Jul 9 06:21:37 2015 UTC,"Does the blue tooth work better. Mine used to work and now it doesn't work at all. Never seemed to connect right, would always display gibberish for song names and if you tried to skip songs it would lock up and you would have to reconnect."

ft86,3cm5cd,Treanimal,9,Wed Jul 8 23:57:45 2015 UTC,I didn't think parents buying brand new cars for their kids actually happened outside of movies. You lucked out!
ft86,3cm5cd,scalablecory,8,Thu Jul 9 00:20:26 2015 UTC,I feel extremely blessed to be in this situation. I am the only child of 4 to get a brand new car.
ft86,3cm5cd,3agl33y3,3,Thu Jul 9 00:58:25 2015 UTC,"I was on the other end if this.  My brother and I split buying our mother a brand new GTS86 and surprising her with it when she flew into town, we picker her up, and surprised her with it sitting in the garage.  It was a couple days before mothers day, but I don't think she minded."
ft86,3cm5cd,3agl33y3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:09:09 2015 UTC,"That's a great surprise! Me and my brother plan to one day buy my dad an old school lowrider with hydraulics, gaudy oversized rims, and a candy paint job. Growing up as a poor kid in Compton it was always his dream to have one but now that he can afford one he claims it's too impractical and that he doesn't need one. I see where he's coming from but one day he's gonna be at the beach and I'm gonna pull up in his new (to him) car."
ft86,3cm5cd,urbanAdmin,2,Thu Jul 9 15:39:36 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much how it worked with my brother and I, he (being the older brother), as a child, asked our mother 'when I am rich, what can I buy for you?' to which she answered an old Jaguar XJS.  He has always kept that in mind, but as my mum lived near a Toyota dealership, we used to walk by, and when the 86 was released, they had the pearl white demo model sitting there, she mentioned how much she liked the color and look of the car.  When it was looking like my brother and I were going to be in a situation where we could afford something like that, I started looking at them, then had a crazy idea that we get one for her as well.  I floated it by him, and he loved it, as a Jag would be nice, but at this point in life, they are kinda pricey, but even after the initial outlay, maintenance etc would no doubt cripple her.  So with the reasonable price of the 86, and capped price servicing for the 1st 3 years, my brother and I figured that not only is it a brand new car for her, but it shouldn't be too much to keep.  And I mean, its Toyota, so parts aren't hard to come by, and usually not too pricey."
ft86,3cm5cd,vancesmi,7,Fri Jul 10 02:15:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, stay stock for at least a year. It sucks to hear, and im sure youre raring to go, but do your research find out whats out there. Also once you start tweaking things it never ends, itll suck you in and if you start tweaking with the engine it just goes up from there. But once you really know what you want go crazy, they are fun cars and ive heard with a supercharger they are absolutely beastly"
ft86,3cm5cd,Pho_DacBiet,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:35:01 2015 UTC,That's some good advice and I never looked at it that way. Mods are definitely a while off for me and won't come until after I can drive on the road proficiently then get some experience at auto-x and maybe a track day or two.
ft86,3cm5cd,Pho_DacBiet,2,Thu Jul 9 03:53:19 2015 UTC,"To follow up on what the previous poster said, I got mine and immediately started swapping trim pieces. After that was lights. Quite suddenly I've put nearly two grand into the car without realizing it."
ft86,3cm5cd,jinyang1590,4,Sun Jul 12 17:00:47 2015 UTC,That's awesome. Make sure you take good care of the car! And also make sure you let your parents know that you appreciate them!
ft86,3cm5cd,Oscrin21,4,Thu Jul 9 00:13:32 2015 UTC,Absolutely! The first thing I ordered was seat covers and car washing supplies. This is the first time I've been excited to wash a car in my life.

ft86,3cm5cd,midarete,3,Thu Jul 9 13:51:06 2015 UTC,Congrats! I just bought a 2015 fr-s that has a manual transmission but I've never driven stick either. I got bored of driving automatic for three years but now I'm determined to learn manual. I'm 3 days in and it's already so much better.
ft86,3cm5cd,Alex-Cross,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:42:53 2015 UTC,"Idk if it's just me, but driving a manual feels so much more engaging and satisfying. Props to you for taking on the challenge of learning manual."
ft86,3cm5cd,jinyang1590,2,Thu Jul 9 01:03:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly why I like it already more than stick. Same to you, hopefully by this time next week we'll be out and about with our new cars and zero stalls."
ft86,3cm5cd,KestrelT,3,Thu Jul 9 01:23:27 2015 UTC,So...When does the modding begin?
ft86,3cm5cd,WWShehan,3,Thu Jul 9 01:02:27 2015 UTC,"Hahah you sound like every single one of my friends. The mods will start as soon as I get comfortable and feel more confident driving a stick, then I'll assess what improvements I want to make. Although, I will probably do some searching on ft86 forums for some simple and cheap DIY mods in the mean time."
ft86,3cm5cd,spicyricecake,3,Thu Jul 9 01:10:07 2015 UTC,"Yea man, I started slow on my car. Simple mods like Clear Sidemarkers and led reverse lights and such. You'll get there soon enough :)"
ft86,3cm5cd,kataxist,2,Thu Jul 9 04:56:28 2015 UTC,Get the Rexpeed convex mirrors! They are a MUST! And totally worth it! Plus they looks badass and make your driving safer/easier!
ft86,3cm5cd,NorcalHPDE,2,Thu Jul 9 05:51:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know if your Kia Optima had ""tap to turn"" where if you tap the signal stalk it blinked three times automatically for a lane change. But my previous car was a MKV Jetta and when I got my BRZ I missed that feature so much so that the first mod I ended up getting was the ""taptoturn"" signal module. Also you can fully integrate a backup cam for your limited trim headunit. Lastly...armrest haha"
ft86,3cm5cd,kataxist,3,Thu Jul 9 13:56:33 2015 UTC,"FT-86 SpeedFactory is a good place to start.  CounterSpace Garage also has a good list of stuff, too.  Also, still be very careful. I know it's fun to drift around everything but you've gotta know your limits."
ft86,3cm5cd,spicyricecake,2,Thu Jul 9 02:38:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for the websites and yeah I know my limit and it's very low lol. I'll be taking it very easy for a while before I try pushing any limits.
ft86,3cm5cd,taco_bellis,3,Thu Jul 9 03:54:27 2015 UTC,http://www.fteightysix.com/ another good website. I will go ahead and tell you (because everyone wants to do this first) buying an intake is almost useless for this car. The stock airbox is great as it is. I bought a grimspeed intake and its makes a nice sound but really it hasn't done much else xD. Better to spend the money on a good quality exhaust for the car!

ft86,3cmoao,scratchy_mcballsy,4,Thu Jul 9 02:30:52 2015 UTC,the flat panel is where the heated seating controls would go if you have that option.

ft86,3cmoao,_md,2,Thu Jul 9 12:44:21 2015 UTC,"It's a 5 minute fix to turn the beeping off completely. Either go to your dealer or buy a Techstream cable for about $15.   You can also change settings for a bunch of other things too: DRLs, auto re-lock, interior lights, etc. Useful stuff."
ft86,3cmoao,fourvalleys,2,Thu Jul 9 05:07:05 2015 UTC,"I just bought the cable. Where do I plug this into the car? I'm going to try to use this guide, but it only tells me what to do on the software side.  Also, do you know if I can modify the car remote to unlock both doors with one click?  Thank you."
ft86,3cmoao,realone550,2,Thu Jul 9 11:52:14 2015 UTC,Its an OBDII cable so it plugs into the port under the steering wheel ignition area. I could only get that software to work with one of my super old XP laptops so best of luck.
ft86,3cmoao,Shinobus_Smile_Work,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:27:21 2015 UTC,"The other person who responded basically got it - you plug it into the OBD port under the steering wheel. I'm not sure how well the software works, but that guide was the best I found as well.   You can change the door locking behavior like you want. Just be aware the setting might be called something that isn't obvious."
ft86,3cmoao,fourvalleys,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:24:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm, the phone must be setting off the sensor through radio wave interference. It shouldn't set it off due its size."
ft86,3cmoao,warrtyme,2,Thu Jul 9 05:25:55 2015 UTC,"Mess around with all the sound settings in FR-S mode before passing judgement. tC mode probably only sounds better because there's more bass by default.  The seat sensor is capacitive. It literally detects the electrical capacitance of whatever is placed on the seat. Weight and size are not the main factors. Phones on the seat tend to set it off, especially when they're plugged into the AUX or USB jack, because the extra electrical activity and connections interfere with the sensor."
ft86,3cmoao,Atomic235,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:46:08 2015 UTC,I had placed my new plates and aux cable plugged in on the seat. Not sure if that is enough to trigger it but the passenger airbag went on and started beeping at me.
ft86,3cmoao,alvin545,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:35:16 2015 UTC,"3 That's the settings for tuning the radio to suit whichever car it's installed in, since many Scion models share the same radio. I think, by default, it is set to tC. If the dealer doesn't change it, it will be delivered under the tC setting (as my car was). Play around to see which sound profile sounds best to you. Edit: formatting"
ft86,3cmoao,WWShehan,3,Thu Jul 9 04:18:08 2015 UTC,The tc has different speaker setup to the frs so i would suggest just putting it on frs since thats what it was made to work with. Not sure why the tc setting sounds better to the op lol who knows!

ft86,3cmoao,warrtyme,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:43:12 2015 UTC,Could you be more specific as to why it sucks? I was under the impression that you could basically use voice through the car to do the navigation and it would who up on the cars screen. Does it just use the phones screen?
ft86,3cmoao,post_break,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:05:07 2015 UTC,It's terrible. I put in the Entune version of the navigation and it's so much better. It actually works and the app is updated for one thing.

That being said I love driving the frs (brz is the same only nicer) its insanely fun and the amount of speed you can carry through corners with only some better tires is insane.

ft86,3cj2qz,hitthemafia,2,Wed Jul 8 13:19:28 2015 UTC,"It's not a hit or miss thing, I think. It's definitely a fuel problem. Thing is, most gas stations have really vague indicators for what's actually in their gas. What does ""premium"" even mean, exactly?  Anyway, I can tell you only one thing for sure, which is the FA20 engine was designed to comply with Japanese fuel standards. That is; no detergents, no additives, no octane boosters. Just 100% refined gasoline. In fact octane rating doesn't seem to be a major factor at all. I've been running 87 and 91 off/on for almost a year now with no issues, as long as it's explicitly labeled as pure or ethanol-free on the pump. It may not be the ethanol causing it, but I strongly suspect that ethanol content coincides with the additive that does.  Anyway, anyway, if you can't find a station with pure gas I hear that a small amount (~1oz) of two-cycle engine oil in every tank of gas should help alleviate the problem."
ft86,3cj2qz,Atomic235,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:10:30 2015 UTC,I found a tsb for the problem though it doesn't say what causes it. Just that it's covered under warranty and other then replacing the pump nothing else.

ft86,3ciide,chrizbreck,3,Wed Jul 8 04:21:05 2015 UTC,CV joints click when they're going bad. You would have to replace the whole axle but warranty would cover it.
ft86,3ciide,NorcalHPDE,2,Wed Jul 8 06:31:50 2015 UTC,"pretty much this, can happen quicker if you're running a low setup which puts pressure on the CV joints. however if you don't have any modifications then it's covered under warranty."

ft86,3ciide,NorcalHPDE,2,Wed Jul 8 07:12:55 2015 UTC,They can ruined through physical contact with rocks and stuff. My buddy ruined his front cv joints on his wrx doing donuts on the Bonneville salt flats. If this were the case they would be leaking though.  Try to see if there's any leaks on the boots.

I was going to do an air bag suspension, but after driving my buddies one i didn't like the feel while sliding. My goal for the motor is doing some sort of boost set up, but I am running into problems finding tuning options on Island in Hawaii."
ft86,3ccd2j,roninsascha,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:59:44 2015 UTC,"Random thought: a set of clear side markers would make a pretty big difference in the look. Maybe it's just me, but in not a very big fan of the stock."
ft86,3cazjo,CapoAlpinist555,10,Mon Jul 6 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"Wheel size depends on what you are racing and what class you are in. For SCCA auto cross the popular classes are c stock and stx. For c-stock the wheels and tires must be the same size as stock. For stx they can be 9 inches wide (any diameter, but most run 17) and up to 255 width tire.   At 17x9 with stock suspension you will need a [+38] +35 offset. +45 rubs. Ft86speedfactory is the only place to get 17x9 +38 rpf1 wheels.   Also. DO NOT stagger your wheels. Get the same size all around. Stagger is great for looks but horrible for balance and handling.   In both cases enkei rpf1 are the most popular as they are incredibly light."
ft86,3cazjo,jericon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:01:30 2015 UTC,The only 17x9 rpf1s on ft86speedfactory are 35+. Is that what you meant?

I think the ""Most lightweight"" option are going to be some fancy forged stuff that are 3k+ a set though tw-66 are pretty and 14ish lbs.  As for size AutoX uses 17x9 with as big a tire they can fit because the courses dont get to high enough speed that tire size starts to be a problem and classing doesnt allow for a wider wheel.  I think more hardcore track guys use 16 or 17x8 wheel with a 225/45 or sometimes 245/40.  Its all about compromises and what you want/need the car to do."
ft86,3cazjo,G-Man33,3,Mon Jul 6 15:04:55 2015 UTC,THanks man this is super helpful.   I am looking to track the car and money is not a big issue here so most lightweight option is what I am looking for. Probably a 17 x 8.   What size and wheel do the 86 cup cars run ?

I am sure they would go for the TWS since they sell them, but if money isn't an issue all the Rays Volk forged stuff is nice too.

Clutch slipped... he was still spraying nitrous when he hit his rev limiter. That will pretty much fuck ANY engine up.  For all of the professional performance shops I've asked, they said it's almost exactly the same stress on the engine as an equal amount of Forced induction from a trubo or SC.   I.E. 270whp from a 100shot of nitrous is the same as 270whp from a 10psi turbo setup.  That being said... I haven't tried it, nor do I know anyone personally who has. I'm also not a mechanic so this could have all been a sales pitch or just plain bullshit."

I'd never make my own car matte black, but sometimes when the whole package comes together you can high-five the owner and tell him it looks sick (because it does).

ft86,3c54cc,notrelevantname,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:11:46 2015 UTC,"It's always possible to take it somewhere and have it tuned regardless.   The OFT is a hot commodity because it erases that need. From what I understand the OFT also gets mated to a particular car, so I don't think you can pass it around between multiple FT86s (and if you're thinking of using it on multiple makes, again, go check out their website to see the list of cars they're compatible with. Which, with glancing right now, is the FT86s, a couple Porsches, and the Miata)  And then to be clear, the OpenFlash Header is just the component on the engine that they make themselves.  Google em, check out their website, I'm speaking only from what I've read and researched, I don't own any of it."
ft86,3c54cc,Zugunfall,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:12:14 2015 UTC,"OFT plugs directly into your car.  It does offer maps and tuning ability.  I don't recomend it if you are thinking maybe one day you will upgrade to a turbo or supercharger.  They are compatible only with a Greddy turbo and a Visconti supercharger.  Most tuners use the ECUtek to tune your car.    Additionally, OFT requires you to do the uploading of maps and tuning.  Not really as simple as it sounds and theres a potential for you to screw something up."
ft86,3c54cc,itburnzwhenipee,3,Thu Jul 9 17:11:38 2015 UTC,A catless header will increase the volume for sure. Do yourself a favor and just get a tune with it. I'm running a Tomei UEL with an E85 tune and it's amazing.
ft86,3c54cc,kl95210,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:59:58 2015 UTC,"If you only do one performance mod, go with the tune instead.  A good 93 octane or E-85 tune will eliminate some (most?) of the torque dip on its own.    The OFT is a very simple and reliable choice in my experience, and you can switch from a stock/stage 1 tune to a stage 2 header tune for free once the header is attached."
ft86,3c54cc,nkofferman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:04:41 2015 UTC,The header will not flatten the torque dip alone. I've got a header mainly for sound hoping to get a tune soon however not never tuned anything so being hesitant on the OFT.
ft86,3c54cc,LukesWill,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:10:30 2015 UTC,"I am running a header and OP that is aftermarket. You will feel a difference but not enough without a tune like others are saying. Go for a tune and maybe flex fuel kit for the e85/93 power gains. This build will make around 200whp. As far as sound, keeping the stock exhaust or a Q300 will give you a little more without adding a drone."
ft86,3c54cc,ctt713,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:57:52 2015 UTC,"I had a header with no tune.  The CEL comes and goes.  No affect on engine performance.  Only thing is cruise control doesnt work when the CEL is on.  It never stays on though, no big deal unless you are due for a SMOG check.    Header and exhaust was my first mod because I wanted the UEL boxer rumble.  You'll feel a slight improvement and really enjoy the sound.  If you remove the cat with any header you will get more noise.  If you have stock exhaust you probably wont notice much.   I've heard perrin exhausts are quiet, albeit, expensive.  But in terms of real performance it is really just a stepping block to a turbo.  For best performance for your buck and you have access to E85, get an E85 kit.  It's something like a 20hp increase for a pretty simple bolt on kit.  You do have to buy a tune with it though so add like $300 to the cost.  Comes about to the same price as you would pay for a cat-back exhaust or header."
ft86,3c5jii,workthatupdoo,3,Sun Jul 5 00:27:58 2015 UTC,I have it on mine and love the sound. It's nice and deep with a mean growl. Just keep in mind that it does drone at highway speeds.
ft86,3c5jii,Adair21,2,Sun Jul 5 00:30:45 2015 UTC,"Too loud and too much drone (at first it won't seem so bad but it gets louder over time) but still all right especially for the price. If you only plan to upgrade the cat-back then it's probably ok for the long run but if you start doing a catless front pipe or header, it's going to be obnoxiously loud."
ft86,3c5jii,Distortion88,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:27:27 2015 UTC,"I would have expected it to get quieter over time with carbon buildup.  I don't plan on upgrading the exhaust further than a catback, but all of the complaints about the drone are beginning to make me reconsider. The invidia q300 is on sale too, but everything I've read for it says it sounds too much like stock."
ft86,3c5jii,diquehead,2,Sun Jul 5 01:55:21 2015 UTC,Mine quieted down some after a few hundred miles of driving.  It's really not too bad around town but on the highway the drone is loud.  The Q300 is probably not going to be a dramatic difference from the stock setup but if you plan on getting headers down the line then I think that it is a good choice.
ft86,3c5jii,WWShehan,3,Sun Jul 5 17:23:06 2015 UTC,I would say if you aren't ever gonna get headers or a catless front pipe then N1 is loud enough but otherwise its gonna be super loud. q300 sounds good with headers and a front pipe though
ft86,3c5jii,Distortion88,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:38:09 2015 UTC,Maybe it's just the perception. At first it sounds awesome and the loudness is a non-issue but it wears on you over time. I know there are people who love it so it's going to be a personal preference thing but just know that it is one of the louder cat backs out there.
ft86,3c5jii,H1ruk4,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:56:22 2015 UTC,I own it as well.... yes it does drone quite loud but after driving with it for years i hardly even notice it :) in fact... people say my car is very quiet lol (I only rock the catback that's why)

ft86,3c5jii,Arcade_West,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:59:26 2015 UTC,I've found that it drones at approx. 75mph.  If I let off the gas it'll go down.  Really dependent on how much throttle you're pushing.  It really is loud though.  It's hard to hear anyone in the car when I first turn on the car.  I actually don't care for the volume as much as I thought I would.

ft86,3c5o9o,mygreatdevastator,2,Sun Jul 5 01:23:21 2015 UTC,"Man, that sucks. I haven't heard of anything like this on the twins. I've seen it in some older car doors where the latch has a hook that grabs the bar on the door to hold it closed. The hook would sometimes be in the closed position, preventing the door from closing. Maybe that is what happened? It can be closed by manually moving the hook to the open position. At least then your trunk would be closed until you can have it looked at. Good luck."

I will buying my car probably in a year and some months from now, I could use all the money saved until that moment on it and take a loan or buy something cheaper, and save some for an apartment. I don't ""need"" to move to an apartment and im not paying rent. But the question itself, if I buy a car like this I will probably have it for a good amount of years (like 15 minimun) is it a good invesment on a car, do they last that long on good terms?

ft86,3bxctk,DeadLeftovers,5,Fri Jul 3 01:44:20 2015 UTC,"Unless you know for sure that it does, it doesn't.  Make sure that whatever shop you take it to you talk to them.  Let them know it was modded before and you want to continue modding it.  Unless the place sucks dick they will you how much insurance covers for each part and can instead offer to cut you a check in place.  So lets say a stock exhaust costs 600 to replace, they will instead give you 600 for the exhaust to do what you want.  You can use an accident where stock parts are being replace to upgrade for very cheap, just make sure you talk to your shop before they order stuff.  Edit:  Just saw that you are hoping its totalled.  Better hope for significant frame damage or engine damage from the exhaust being pushing in if that's what you want."

ft86,3bxctk,legocatseyeguy,5,Fri Jul 3 01:17:16 2015 UTC,"Accident happened yesterday, I have spent all day on the phone. As of right now it sounds like the guy who hit me has accepted fault.

I don't know the system in the US, but shouldn't your insurance just be handling this all for you?  For your reference, this is a pic of the damage to my car last week.   So as I mentioned, I had a call this morning telling me they've had to replace the beaver bar behind the panel. The rear panel (as seen) will be completely replaced, and the boot will be panel beaten & repainted.   When I had it assessed I asked about the chassis (i.e. structural part of the car). He told me that the actual chassis only wraps down to the lower left and lower right hand side of the car (i.e. behind the tow hook spots that pop out). There is apparently nothing behind the middle of the panel. From the looks of yours it looks like these should have been damaged, therefore writing off the car."

ft86,3bxa1z,Davesnotheree,6,Fri Jul 3 00:51:33 2015 UTC,My first mod was clear sidemarkers. However if I were to do it all over again Wheels + coils is what I would do before anything else. All the things I did to the car from headlights to lip kits was just negated by the wheel gap and stock wheels.
ft86,3bxa1z,midarete,8,Thu Jul 2 23:55:28 2015 UTC,"When I first got my 86, I spent a bunch of money on intake/pulleys, shift knobs and all kinds of other, neat, but ultimately not that noticeable mods. The thing I have done so far that has made the most difference, in terms of performance has been the wheel/tire combo.   Get a lighter, slightly wider wheel, and combine it with some better tires. After that, you'll probably notice a slight increase in body roll, so if that bothers you, look in to sway bars. Wheel/tire/suspension mods go a lot further on this car than power mods do (at least before you're willing to drop like $4-6k), and make the car a lot more fun to drive during the twisty-turny bits."
ft86,3bxa1z,Dangy_D,4,Thu Jul 2 23:23:12 2015 UTC,I second this. Getting some actual performance tires made it so much more fun to drive. It's very noticeable.

Also, I quite enjoy the 'red' TRD soundchanger, however you can achieve similar results by removing the foamy stuff from the stock tube. This makes the induction noise piped into the cabin louder; some don't care for it, I like the sound. So, personal preference."
ft86,3bxa1z,_md,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:32:22 2015 UTC,Remove the clutch spring and adjust the clutch pedal height. - $free  Add some front camber with some factor crash bolts. - $10ish  After that drive the car and see if there's anything that isn't perfect.
ft86,3bxa1z,totally_rocks,2,Fri Jul 3 00:15:44 2015 UTC,"First thing I did with my car was adjust the clutch height down and it has made such a difference. It was super annoying to drive in traffic before. I haven't seen anyone mention crash bolts for camber, what does this do to the drive feel and how easy is it to do? Possible with 2 jacks?"
ft86,3bxa1z,Dawgpdr07,2,Fri Jul 3 05:55:42 2015 UTC,"You should never work on a car that is only held up on a jack.  Crash bolts allow you add negative camber to the front.  (the top of the wheel goes in). As a car goes through a turn it rolls away from the apex of the corner.  Having some negative camber allows the tire to have better contact with the road during a corner, when that contact is needed most.  If you go too far it can make the car wonder over uneven pavement, but this suspension is very stable.  Anything under 3 degrees should be fine.  With crash bolts maxed out I would only expect about 1.5 degrees.  The part that's hard for many to wrap their heads around is that 3 degrees of camber will likely make the tires wear more evenly than 0 degrees.  Meaning tire life won't be negatively affected at all."
ft86,3bxa1z,totally_rocks,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:20:47 2015 UTC,"Good to know, I do have access to an auto shop that I can use for cheap. I'll probably look into this soon. If not, at least when I replace my tires with something better than stock."
ft86,3bxa1z,Dawgpdr07,2,Fri Jul 3 18:24:51 2015 UTC,"Im probably in the minority here, but I say keep the tires and learn to drive until the tires, not your skill, level is the limiting factor.  Yeah, the car can do much more with better tires, but the factory tires are still enough that most people can't drive at their limits.  The other thing though, is that I found the stock spings weren't enough for the stick tires.  Once you move up to better tires and you start using them, you'll want stiffer springs as well.  Which means better dampers, and more adjustability in the suspension..."

ft86,3brkvz,NorcalHPDE,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:52:10 2015 UTC,"ECStuning is the go to source for Porsche/Audi/VW. It's one of those places where you go to research parts since their catalog and descriptions are superb, but you never buy because the shipping is so expensive.   Their nickname is ""extremely costly shipping"" for a reason."
ft86,3brkvz,post_break,0,Thu Jul 2 21:55:24 2015 UTC,Gotcha. I hate companies like that. $10 part? $13 shipping. Get bent.

ft86,3bpue3,jaym0s,2,Wed Jul 1 06:48:30 2015 UTC,ive got a 2012 and im fine. ECU reflash does help and it can take a bit of arguing with dealerships to get it done. but you can save yourself the time and use the OFT (open flash tablet) and flash the latest roms on yourself with a good performance increase.
ft86,3bpue3,YouShallKnow,2,Wed Jul 1 06:48:08 2015 UTC,"It's pretty important to have the updated ROM file, there are claims that the old flash caused engine failure that over a long enough timeline was 100%.    Get a dealership to update ECU file or use OFT (which as the updated transient ignition retard tables incorporated).   When I brought mine in to flash, I described the rev-hunting issue that was also corrected with the flash.  The service manager tried giving me shit about ""not being able to reproduce it.""  I just told him to hook up the computer and check if there is an updated ECU file.  He got quiet, walked away and my ECU was updated.

The point of all this sound trickery is to meet ever stricter sound regulations.  Making the car louder isn't an option.  Yet sportscar buyers want to hear the car they're driving.  So the solution was to provide an engine noise that only those inside the car can hear.  The only other thing they could do is make a louder car and just not be able to sell it in those countries."

The BRZ is not as fun when you are not pushing its limits and you should never push any kind of limits on a public road.  Looking for an awesome blank slate to build on top of?

ft86,3bkdsc,teek0001,3,Mon Jun 29 23:01:37 2015 UTC,No he bought the cap for the steering wheel. A few guys in my group have the same one. Also looks like he bought the interior trim set you can get from ft86 speedfactory http://www.ft86speedfactory.com/anodized-aluminum-climate-control-trim-various-colors-1629.html see?

ft86,3bkec3,tacomafrs,4,Mon Jun 29 23:37:45 2015 UTC,Sadly an auto :(. But I love it the same if it were a manual.
ft86,3bkec3,caustiq,5,Tue Jun 30 00:37:45 2015 UTC,"Don't be sad, the Auto let's you switch to manual+sport mode. Instant control."
ft86,3bkec3,caustiq,7,Tue Jun 30 00:50:32 2015 UTC,That's why I love this car. I know some people gonna hate about automatic. But think about just cruising and not worrying about shifting. And like you said manual mode is there and I like that. For someone who doesn't really know how to drive manual I couldn't ask for more
ft86,3bkec3,tacomafrs,2,Tue Jun 30 01:21:02 2015 UTC,"Then your new car will help you learn manual without doing any damage to your transmission. Put the car into D as usual, (and of course sports mode because racecar), then experiment with the paddle shifters and get the feel for when you might want more power from the higher RPMs. After a few seconds, if the car thinks you should be in a different gear, it will switch back to D and resume Auto.  Eventually you'll get to the point where you know exactly when to be shifting, and you can try out the Manual mode.  Having both options is rad, I don't care. Or a hybrid of the two, which is how I usually drive."
ft86,3bkec3,BBFL,5,Tue Jun 30 01:27:09 2015 UTC,"After having the manual, i wouldn't mind having the auto either. Easier to drive smoothly, better MPG, still handles amazingly. Its not like the manual will win you any drag races in this car. Maybe i should test drive the auto..."

ft86,3bkec3,BBFL,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:38:28 2015 UTC,Don't worry there are other at fans out there.  I have put 27k on in about a year and a half.  I drive in LA/OC/SD traffic a lot.  Then I put her in manual and go carve canyons.  The paddles are wonderful for shifting in and out of turns. The first time you downshift an auto into a drift and maintain through throttle alone is fun. I have drifted manuals but never thought it would be this east to break loose with an AT

I run them with slightly larger wheels so scraping is similar to stock, but when I run my winter wheels (stock size) there is a bit more scraping than usual, but I live in places with mostly shite infrastructure so that's to be expected."

ft86,3bejic,iJeff,3,Mon Jun 29 14:09:45 2015 UTC,Have you looked in to getting drums from a local distributor? I've been researching it a lot lately and might be able to recommend a few outfits to you depending on where your location.  The problem with pump e-85 is the variability in ethanol content. If you go with something like C-85 from VP or Sunoco's much more affordable e-85 variant then you're guaranteed close to if not exactly 85% ethanol content with the remaining 15% being 100+ octane.
ft86,3bejic,Dasbeerboots,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:16:07 2015 UTC,"I did actually, and can get them locally.  It's just the added pain in the butt factor that keeps me from doing that.

I've been fortunate enough to have owned and driven many performance vehicles in my lifetime. I can't think of many options around this price point that give you such a huge bang for your buck.

ft86,3bg93m,cywinr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:13:30 2015 UTC,"According to Car & Driver, the folks in Toyota City are smitten with the new Mazda MX-5 Miata. So much so they’re considering using the platform for the next Toyota GT86, sold as the Scion FR-S in North America.  The rumor states what goes for Toyota goes for Subaru’s sports car – the BRZ – as well. I’m not so sure about that.  “If Toyota were to employ the MX-5’s chassis, it would be on the next-generation FT86,” Car & Driver was told by a source.  The source says nothing specifically about the BRZ, though the magazine infers the Miata platform will also be used on the next sporty Subaru. However, Subaru may be smart to forego a second generation BRZ altogether.  Currently, the Toyobaru triplets are produced by Subaru in Ōta, Japan. The company is currently capacity constrained. Subaru will stop producing Camrys for Toyota at their Indiana facility in 2016 in order to claw back some of its own capacity to build the Legacy and Outback, the most popular model at Subaru. This shift to the Mazda platform could be a way for Subaru to get out of the RWD platform business and focus more on core models or variations thereof.  Mazda is building the MX-5 at their own facility in Japan and will build the forthcoming Fiat 124 Spider upon its debut. Considering Mazda and Toyota have been getting cozier as of late with a new facility in Mexico building the new Mazda2 along with the Scion iA/Toyota Yaris Sedan, Toyota could also move RWD sports car production to Mazda’s facility in Japan alongside the new Miata.  This would free up capacity for Subaru at their Ōta plant to build other models currently in demand.  So, if Toyota does see the MX-5 Miata platform as a solution for the next generation GT86 and Scion FR-S, don’t expect Subaru to follow suit."
ft86,3bg93m,Gman777,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:24:23 2015 UTC,Why would this be a good thing? The 86 is a custom platform with an ultra low centre of gravity. The mazda is likely too damn small unless you're a Japanese school girl.

I added the OEM autodimming mirror to my FR-S. Totally worth it as low as these cars sit, IMO. I'm in the south where there are a ton of jacked up trucks running around so constantly flipping the mirror dim got irritating.  I have a Passport Max2 mounted just below the rear view with the factory suction mount. I draw power for it from the connector for the autodim mirror up with the dome light. You can buy a MirrorTap to do this, but since the connector is fused anyway on our cars, I just homebrewed it by cutting a ~12"" length of phone cord and crimping some pins to the end. Free vs $25 is always good in my mind.  This was actually a lot of my initial motivation for installing the autodim - the autodim mirror includes a little wire conduit that I can also hide the power connector for the radar detector in.  I also have a Panavise suction mount that was originally for my old Contour ROAM that I leave mounted along the passenger side A pillar. Gives the camera a good angle while leaving my sight lines clear. I recently upgraded to a Garmin VIRB and use the same mount with a tripod adapter.  Only other thing on my list of intended add-ons for the interior at the moment is the OEM arm rest.  EDIT:  Snapped some photos since I was hopping in be car anyway.   http://imgur.com/a/aMSEs  I usually only have the VIRB in the car when I am. I leave the mount since it doesn't really block any visibility as you can see."

ft86,3b79wg,The_Quaker,6,Fri Jun 26 20:23:44 2015 UTC,"A few things that come to mind:  -A BRZ is literally the exact opposite of the vehicle you're driving now; small, low, and highly impractical. Definitely do a thorough test drive, because it would suck to drop over $25k on a car that you end up hating to drive.  -Gas mileage isn't terrible, but not exactly amazing either. I get around 24-25 MPG in a mix of ~30% highway 70% city driving. It also requires premium fuel, so all together you're only looking at around a 40-50% cut in your gas costs; unless you're going to be living far away, you probably won't be saving more than 30-50 bucks a month.  I don't mean to be a buzz killer, but buying a new or late model used car strictly to save on gas is almost never a good idea. Personally, if you really like your Jeep, I would stick with that, and look into alternate means of transportation. Living close to campus and getting a bicycle would be both way cheaper and would also get/keep you in shape (bikes are also awesome for getting around campus quicker). Most colleges will also offer free/discounted bus passes if you're going to be living further away. If the weather where you live is nice, a motorcycle would be cheap and a legitimate gas saver (even a relatively large bike can put a Prius to shame), plus there is a huge motorcycle community."

Learning to shift early and not floor it everywhere I went was all the difference. If I drive it hard, then my mileage suffers.  My previous car was a tuned 2006 Charger R/T and my other ride is a motorcycle. I've realized that with the BRZ I'm not ever going to have that launch-your-butt-into-the-seat acceleration that I'm used to elsewhere, so I take it around corners hard and ease up on the usual acceleration from stop.

It's in the display and it shows a little nondescript arrow telling you to shift. Depending on how hard you accelerate, the arrow will appear ~2-2.5k. If you follow the indicator you'll find yourself in 6th gear by 36 mph. This is how I achieve the fuel economy that I do. Drive a tank the way you normally do and then again following the arrow as strictly as possible you should find an improvement on your fuel economy."
ft86,3b79wg,the87boy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:39:41 2015 UTC,"I discovered that it is turned off by default, so I never knew it was there. BRZ owners can check p.189 of your manual for instructions!"

ft86,3b79wg,The_Quaker,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:14:06 2015 UTC,Feed it less throttle and it will shift sooner. I average 30mpg in my BRZ. I regularly shift at 2.5k.

ft86,3b79wg,JudoQuip,5,Fri Jun 26 21:43:15 2015 UTC,"I was In a very similar situation. I had a 2001 Wrangler TJ, and man did I love taking that thing out and about, mudding, and not have to worry whether or not I'm on the road or not. The FRS is a totally different experience, and I love it. You are low to the ground compared to high, you can go through plenty of turns without worry of flipping, and you feel like you are going fast.   With my TJ, it just became too much of a toy, to where I personally didn't take it camping or off-roasting enough anymore to justify against the noise, leaks, and terrible gas mileage. I love my FRS, and could absolutely not be happier with my decision."
ft86,3b79wg,GrammarBeImportant,3,Fri Jun 26 18:34:46 2015 UTC,"Be more clear about what you mean when you say ""can't afford it"".  How many miles are you driving now and/or will you when you get to college?  What are the other costs associated with it like: insurance, maintenance, etc.?  BRZ/FR-S is fuel efficient for the type of car it is, but if you don't have a 25 mile one-way commute like I do, it doesn't really matter.  Regardless, wouldn't a cheaper route be to take off the mud tires and put more reasonable tires on the Jeep, at least when you're just commuting?  I'm just going to state for the record that changing vehicles or buying additional vehicles (motorcycle, for example) never ends up saving you money in the end as you always spend more on depreciation, extra insurance, lost money in the sale of one to buy the other, etc.  Also, in the case of a motorcycle or bicycle (as one person suggested), the inevitable medical bills from when you get assfucked by a dumbass not paying attention will far offset any monetary savings.  If you're really just over the Jeep and sincerely want a BRZ/FR-S, I wouldn't recommend against it, but if this is purely a financially derived decision, make sure you really crunch the numbers and look at all of the potential downsides (no tow rating, limited storage space, realistically only seats 1 passenger, etc.) before making a decision almost as important as your college major since your car will be the most expensive thing you own until you buy a house."
ft86,3b79wg,slyphen,3,Fri Jun 26 18:10:37 2015 UTC,"You seem pretty wise financially (you and your dad paid down the jeep quickly). You are going to take a hit on depreciation for the Jeep. If you don't plan on keeping the BRZ for 10 years, you will take a hit on that as well.  Buying two new cars and eating their depreciation at a young age is not wise. There are probably many well maintained used cars that will suit your needs and leave you in better financial position.  That being said....  I passionately love my BRZ. There are days that I get STI lust but not seriously. My BRZ is the one for me. I get 29.5 mpg (90% freeway on cruise control / 10% ""spirited city driving"".  I love the BRZ because it handles beautifully, is very fun from 0-60 and still gets great gas mileage. Driving a slow car fast at 10/10 is way more fun than getting speeding tickets and being forced to hold back with a faster car.  Once you are out of warranty you can also get new headers, full exhaust and a tune to increase the WHP to about 200 without putting much additional strain on the engine. 25% increase in power is very noticeable in this car."

ft86,3b2b9j,Moudy90,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:46:25 2015 UTC,"Thats definitely the plan. He said he would do the back glass ""Illegally"" to have it cover the third brake light for free, and asked that I please give him a good review on google. Im hoping this will be the leverage I need to get the part replaced. I only paid $250 for the tint, and the light housing will cost him $150 from the dealer. If he pulls through like he should Id happily leave him a positive review for doing the right thing even if that means not making money on the deal."
ft86,3b2b9j,johnnybags,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"I live in ohio, no limits on our rear window tint (I did 35% all around). They didn't leave a cut out for my brake light.   To be honest I'm not really sure how it would play out given how common tint is and with it being an oem option. I know taillights are required to meet certain dot brightness minimums and that's why most people get a ticket for them."
ft86,3b2b9j,blizzsource,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:26:49 2015 UTC,Is it still really bright with the 35%? I was under the assumption that the leds they use are already brighter than most brake lights

It was obnoxiously loud on an otherwise stock exhaust and it droned really bad at highway speeds, to a point of aggravation and (literal) headaches.  If you like loud exhaust, or say... waking up your neighbors in the morning with the cold idle- then I say go for it. But, if you're like most people, and your car is about 70% daily driver and 30% recreation machine, I would advise just getting a full cat back system with no drone."

ft86,3ayrbw,Dangy_D,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"I guess you could just get a muffled axleback and keep the factory midpipe. The amount of drone (or lack thereof) would probably depend on any given axelback, so it's sort of hard to say.  I only suggested cat backs because (to my knowledge, anyway) there seems to be quite a few more options, both brand and style-wise to choose from. I think in terms of actual performance, you probably won't find much of a difference."

The fun part of the antenna is whenever you close the trunk or walk behind the car and don't expect it to hit you in the face. Still gets me, even two years later."

EDIT: One thing I'm wondering is if anyone has gotten into any trouble for deleting the reverse lights from the tail lights. I think having a reverse light only at the lower bumper bar may be kind of dangerous. Wouldn't it be possible someone might not see that you are trying to back up?"

ft86,3al32x,Vtakkin,13,Sun Jun 21 06:38:56 2015 UTC,"Looks like most replies so far are speculation. I'll try to confirm / elaborate on some information.  Regardless of the high compression, the FA20 handles boost very well. Most FI kits, supercharger and turbo alike, will put you somewhere around 8 to 10lbs. With a proper tune in mind, this is around the limitation of the stock fuel system on pump gas and will put you around 250 to 300whp/200 to 220wtq. This is a great power point for a daily driver and will get the car where you're wanting it. For simplicity sake, I would recommend one of the many supercharger kits if around 250hp is suitable for you. This is wheel HP, not crank HP. Stock wheel HP is around 150 and varies by dyno and conditions. Tire upgrade is needed or you'll spin even at the top of 3rd.  If you go beyond 300hp, you need to upgrade the fuel pump, port injectors, and clutch. The clutch will start slipping as you start getting over 200 to 220tq (ballpark 300hp). Its recommended to use a proprietary clutch and flywheel combination rather than just a stock clutch replacement.  From there, the motor is no longer the problem. 350whp and beyond (250 to 300wtq) brings you to transmission issues. This all depends on how hard you beat on the car, how hard you shift coming off boost (drivetrain shock), etc... 4th gear is the weaker gear in these transmissions (6 speed manual). You're basically playing your luck. Some cars have transmission issues stock, where others are running 450, 500hp, and even beyond still with no problems. You need to be very conservative with shifting when you start reaching these power levels or you will very quickly start blowing up transmissions. My advice for anyone running over 300hp is to limit powershifting. The gears in your transmission will wear faster over time of course, but the huge drivetrain shock from power shifting with over double the HP the transmission was intended for definitely does not help. There is a company developing a replacement gear set solution which should release later this year.  As far as stock motor limitations, no one really knows the true limitation yet. With supporting fuel system, Fullblown has taken the completely stock motor over 600hp, blowing multiple transmissions and exceeding over 500 dyno pulls around that power level still with the stock motor. The motors can definitely handle that level of power for a decent amount of time, but no one really knows when it comes to daily driving conditions. Most shops will recommend a built motor beyond 450hp due to the rods. Lowering compression with a built motor also helps considerably with reliability. High compression + boost usually equals bad things. Direct injection helps a lot when using e85 as a direct cooling shot on to the piston. Oil coolers also help a lot when the car is under regular abuse (track conditions).  When you go over 300hp, it all comes down to your tune. With high compression, your tune is incredibly important. There isn't as much room for error as other cars due to the high compression. If you blow your motor anywhere under 400 to 450hp, your tune was the likely cause. Don't go cheap here. Pay for a tune from a reliable tuner (Delicious, Vinshu, etc). If you don't, you'll pay for it later with a motor rebuild.  If you have any other questions just let me know.

ft86,3al32x,brzoomtx,3,Mon Jun 22 17:38:41 2015 UTC,The engine internals are not the same as the WRX FA20.  I believe the WRX FA20DIT runs a 10.6:1 compression ratio whereas the ft86 runs 12.5:1
ft86,3al32x,blizzzbrz,2,Mon Jun 22 00:21:29 2015 UTC,The engine easily handles up to 8PSI of boost without any issues. Though you start running into to fueling issues around 300whp.   There's a guy on the forums with 60k miles with no issues supercharged.
ft86,3al32x,GrammarBeImportant,2,Sun Jun 21 14:13:02 2015 UTC,"People have been running jackson racing superchargers without any issues for a while now. I must say however that most of my turbo friends are constantly fixing oil leaks :D (they run way higher boost though).  If you're already disappointed by the car's lack of power though and are already planning for SC upgrade, I'm sure there are better cars around :)"
ft86,3al32x,Tuxer,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:19:38 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't driven the car yet, I'm just trying to do as much research as possible. My current car is an auto base model civic, so I'm sure the ft86 is still gonna be a significant step up in performance."
ft86,3al32x,Tuxer,2,Sun Jun 21 23:58:35 2015 UTC,"Makes sense.   My point is just that, if you're looking for super cool driving dynamics, that's your car. Enjoy that, and if in one year you wish for more power , go look into FI.   If you're more into power (no problems with that, plenty of people are), I'd honestly look into other cars."

ft86,3al32x,CSG_Mike,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:49:17 2015 UTC,"If you have a good tune, and are looking for something reasonable, it'll have near-stock reliability."
ft86,3al32x,kaluce,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:37:31 2015 UTC,"/u/brzoomtx nailed it completely. Don't skimp on your turbo kit and your tune and you'll be fine on stock everything up to 250WHP.   After 250WHP, you'll have to work on your driveline, in particular your rear axles, which seem to snap under big boost. Since /u/brzoomtx  went over the M/T, I'll go over the A/T.  If you're using the A/T you need to worry about heat and would do you best to install a transmission cooler ASAP. The A/T is actually good with no modifications aside from the cooler up to about 300WHP. It's the same transmission off a Lexus IS250 that has significantly more torque stock. SSP also has a few mods for the A/T out if you get above 300 wtq, like a performance torque converter, and valve body replacements, which will make shifts significantly faster and more aggressive. This will also let the BRZ pull pretty big numbers (400+ lb/tq)."

It advertises 299 hp and is about as far as you can go without  upgrading more parts.  Since the fun of a supercharger is feeling it kick in, I'm not sure if a 250 hp version wouldn't be almost as exciting.    Boosting is an expensive game, but the BRZ is a good car to do it on.  In retrospect I might have gotten a used BRZ to offset the cost of the supercharger"

ft86,3akw2l,cerealcable,3,Sun Jun 21 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"I'd strongly point out that the rear seats are functional but not practical. You'll probably drive people around a once or twice before everyone tries to find another way every time.  Let's face it, you're buying a two door car and of all the two door cars (at least quite a few of them) it has pretty much the least space possible. My friends Mustang has significantly more space for rear passenger feet than the twins do. Head room is also a problem so it'll never truly be a practical option to transport people with.  Trunk space is decent but as others have mentioned height is an issue. You're definitely downgrading in storage space so be aware. I don't regret it myself but there are times it is inconvenient.  As far as fun...oh man. When I see other vehicles, Mustang's, Vettes, WRX, etc I'm not even remotely envious. I look at the twins as a practical race car because of its low weight, damn good weight balance and fantastic handling. I was keeping up with Mustang GTs and Vettes with a stock BRZ at the last track day. They're awfully slow in the corners!  If you want fun and you view fun as RWD, small and nimble cornering car this is it. If your fun is all about horsepower look into other options. You'll never be happy enough if you truly want a huge V8."
ft86,3akw2l,LadyStPetsoisJuJu,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:22:51 2015 UTC,"You'll have enough room in the back to fit 4 wheels with tires on them to get to the track/autocross. Otherwise, no one EVER, EVER wants to sit in the back, it's cramped and tight, no leg room. I'm 5' 4"" and feel claustrophobic in the back of my car. The back seat really should be reserved for those under 8 years old. The trunk is fine for road trips, groceries, and the like, but it's lacking in vertical space, so be aware some stuff just plain won't fit.  The mods out there for the FR-S are widely available, from what I've seen so far, so you won't be disappointed there.  The first thing I'd do, if it doesn't have decent ones already on, is get nice tires, like the Michelin Pilot Super Sports or similar, it really will make a difference in your driving experience."
ft86,3akw2l,LadyStPetsoisJuJu,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:11:04 2015 UTC,"As far as the trunk and rear seats go - I play guitar and my minimum is that it needs to be able to fit my guitar, amp, and pedalboard.  It looks like the FR-S could fit that.  And the back seat - the Altima is 2+3 but the FR-S is 2+2.  That might make a difference.  I really just need to see one.  The big issue in my current car is that there is no headroom, but the seats in the FR-S are lower, so it might be a bit better in that department.  If I go with an FR-S, I was thinking about going with wider/better tires, then eventually a supercharger."
ft86,3akw2l,FreeK200,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:18:00 2015 UTC,"You'll be able to fit those items, probably with the seats down.  Headroom is pretty non-existent in the back, depending on the height of the person you've stuffed/forced/blackmailed back there.  Definitely taking a look in person and sitting in the back of one yourself is the best idea."
ft86,3akw2l,bsarocker,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:23:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely taking a look in person and sitting in the back of one yourself is the best idea.   Couldn't agree with this more. I thought people were slightly exaggerating just how bad it is. They're not. I haven't gotten my BRZ yet, but I've been in one and let me tell you, it really is an extremely tight fit. You can possibly semi uncomfortably fit a third person in your BRZ/FR-S/FT86 by making your passenger scoot up a bit more than they'd like, but that just makes two people unhappy."
ft86,3akw2l,canned_soup,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:23:35 2015 UTC,"Driver and front passenger headroom are fine. as I said previously and LadyStPetsoisJuJu said the space behind the front seats is not really a rear seat and more for storage or insurance purposes, it's ok for small children. think 2+.5 instead of 2+2.  Folding the rear seat back flat will give you the space for a guitar or bass (not upright) in a bag or very small case. I regularly transport my sons SG in a bag and a small peavey (13""x15"") practice amp. As also mentioned the vertical  space, and entrance to the trunk are a issue and would prevent some amps from fitting."
ft86,3akw2l,Portinski,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:34:11 2015 UTC,My amp is a Vox AC15.  I'd definitely need to bring it along and see if it would fit.
ft86,3akw2l,LostSalad,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:22:55 2015 UTC,"If your Vox is a single 12"" it will fit, but you may have to lay the back seat down and load it behind the passenger seat to get it in due to what others are saying about the trunk clearance."
ft86,3akw2l,KrispV9,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:28:12 2015 UTC,"I'll speak up to say that although the trunk is pretty spacious, it isn't very tall. So items that can't collapse in any way or be rotated to fit will have to go on the passenger seat. Had it happen to me the other day :(  Still though, it was the first time in the year I've owned it that something like that happened. I don't haul things very often, hence my choice of vehicle."
ft86,3akw2l,iJeff,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:13:00 2015 UTC,The best thing about the back seat is that you realise that the car came with a sunroof! It also has the dual functionality of letting you see out the back. I just wish that it could slide open because I find my head bumping into the glass...
ft86,3akw2l,KrispV9,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:41:08 2015 UTC,"Arguably the FT86 has the best after market support of any vehicle currently in production. Back seats are pretty disappointing and a tight fit for most people, but you can store stuff on them decently. When it comes to mods, specifically forced induction about 8-10 PSI of boost on stock internals should be your max, after that you want to get some tougher internals. I recommend going with a supercharger because its just instant power. Another recommendation would be unequal length headers which really help get more torque all around. E85 is pretty good too, even to run on a NA FT86.   Check out FT86SpeedFactory for all of your mods, they have by far the best service and reputation. Shopping with them, you know that you are getting authentic products and not knock offs. Pretty much any part/component on your car that you can think of, they have on the website, and the layout is really user friendly."
ft86,3akw2l,ctt713,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:23:59 2015 UTC,How bad do modest superchargers harm fuel economy? Does forced induction work for us in areas where 91 octane is sort of the best we'll get?
ft86,3akw2l,KrispV9,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:19:12 2015 UTC,"Fuel economy is only slightly harmed, unless you are going choo choo all the time. Some WRX STi owners I know complain that there is a huge difference between 91 and 93 in performance, but I thinks its all just noise. Of course forced induction works on 91 Octane! Just make sure the tune is set for 91. I probably wont do forced induction on my BRZ until I get another car to replace it as a daily.   If you are looking to get any more power by any chance, then look into an E85 Kit, and unequal length headers. Thats about +45 HP and it gets rid of the massive torque dip around 4,000 rpm. That's probably what I am going to do to my car performance wise, aside from Injen intake and Cusco oil catch can. It's a good place to start, a lot of boosted subaru motors have ringland failure, so I would build a Stage 2 motor before ever putting boost in."

ft86,3agy4v,Portinski,3,Sat Jun 20 02:35:13 2015 UTC,I can chime in here. I have had my BRZ since 7/28/2012. The day I picked it up I purchased a Graco Argos 70 for my three year old. It fit well with the back attached. Around four is when I converted it to a booster.  The only difficulties I had were on the beginning to harness him in. To strap him in I found it worked best to push the passenger seat all the way forward and step into the back passenger footwell facing the car seat/back of the car. Same trick worked well for getting the kid out when he was asleep in the back.  The only other difficulty I had was my son trying to buckle the over the shoulder strap in with the booster in place. The latch (is that what it's called) is really recessed into the seat so its hard to get the buckle into it with the added mass of the car seat. If you can find an extender it might be helpful.  I've been carting him around for the last three years in the BRZ and its been otherwise good.  Let me know if I can help further.
ft86,3agy4v,staring_at_keyboard,2,Sat Jun 20 05:06:43 2015 UTC,"I have no experience with child seats, but the back seats in an frs are very deep, bucket style seats, that have quite the backwards tilt to them.   I guess my point is that the child seat should have a fairly small bottom space-wise in order to fit. Again though, no experience with child seats, no idea how large/small they are."
ft86,3agy4v,antoni908,2,Sat Jun 20 02:27:41 2015 UTC,It's easy. My four year old fits fine and he loves riding in the back.

ft86,3aigwp,post_break,0,Sat Jun 20 19:14:04 2015 UTC,I still feel like the chirping is from cavitation as it reminds me of an incorrectly installed inline fuel pump on my 240z before I changed it out.  Basically there is a small amount of air that is collecting in the pump. Throttle application increases pump speed and the space is then filled with fuel and it goes away.   Also Cavitation can be bad as the fuel pump needs full submersion of fluid to keep cool. If any air is trapped that is a spot on the pump that is not getting cooled and could cause the pump to overheat and fail.

This was in March/April of 2015 so its the current situation."

ft86,3adfkv,CSG_Mike,2,Fri Jun 19 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"Seems the Auto was doing a fairly good job keeping you in the proper gear.  Remember that the AT has much taller gearing than the MT, 3rd and 4th will particularly be noticeable.  If you stick to tracking long term, getting a final drive may be useful, at the detriment of your day to day MPG.  Also, brake pads and fluids from here on out, if you haven't upgraded already!"
ft86,3adfkv,CSG_Mike,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:44:32 2015 UTC,"I was pretty happy with the auto in sport mode.  Was a little annoyed it was inconsistent at dropping to ... I think 3rd (maybe 2nd) going through T5.  Worse is when it didn't it would ignore the paddles.  Yeah, I was smelling the brakes pretty good by the end of each ~20min session. I'll be getting race pads before my next track day, but that's not likely for several months.  Was just under 2k miles when I arrived at the track so I figured the stock stuff would probably be OK for that session.  I'm considering doing a oil change this weekend to make things a little less suspiciously messy (but at the same time not overly clean) at the 6k service.  I'll check the forums and see what pads/fluids are recommended for track use before I take it back."
ft86,3adfkv,purepwnage85,2,Sat Jun 20 00:07:03 2015 UTC,"If you want to do it right, get some race pads of your choice, good brake fluid, a quality full synthetic oil for the engine, an engine oil cooler, and some camber bolts for the front."
ft86,3adfkv,purepwnage85,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:21:20 2015 UTC,"thing with auto is you will end up downshifting at the exact wrong moment, like in the middle/end of a corner where you're supposed to be accelerating out (most cars will read the pedal press too late), you're supposed to be in the lowest gear possible for a corner going in, so you can come out with the highest amount of engine power going into the wheels (eg. good example would be to look at all the celebrity segments of top gear, and notice how the fastest ones/slowest ones change)"
ft86,3adfkv,purepwnage85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:19:17 2015 UTC,"Sure an automatic transmission under automatic control is far from optimal for racing. Were I using the paddles I probably could've gotten an extra half second off my lap time with no other changes, mostly coming out of turns 5 and 11.   Occasionally the automatic would downshift to 3rd or 2nd (I'm not sure which) going through five and I could feel how much faster the exit was on those laps ."
ft86,3adfkv,CSG_Mike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:24:57 2015 UTC,"ah yeah didn't realize the FT86 had paddles as well, I wonder if it's a torque converter type system or a double clutch type, but either way even the paddle shifters will save you more than half a second on that, the difference between paddle shifters and a full manual would probably be half second, but either way that's faster than I would have gone even in a manual on my first proper lap so well done!"
ft86,3adfkv,CSG_Mike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:31:55 2015 UTC,"It's a traditional slushbox with paddles as well as tiptronic style controls on the shifter.  When in manual mode it can additionally be put into ""sport"" manual mode which allegedly speeds up the shifts a bit and lets you exceed redline briefly.  One more fun bit: if you downshift while threshold braking it will overshoot the rev match to not disrupt traction when the torque converter locks up."
ft86,3adfkv,eecsasdf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:43:05 2015 UTC,"nice! yeah that last bit was the bit I was trying to talk about in my first post, the main idea is that the car is more balanced if you're in the lowest possible gear going in, rather than if you change in the middle (which the fully automatic transmission will do, because it doesn't know where you're going, only how much pressure there is on the accelerator), I wonder how CVT automatics would do on a track, in theory, they'd have a better balance than even manuals (sort of like sequential gearboxes like in rallying)"
ft86,3adfkv,eecsasdf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:05:57 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly CVTs handle the load of track use even worse than automatics.  If that weren't an issue though, yeah, a CVT would kick the pants off an MT or conventional AT by letting the engine stay at peak power regardless of what speed you're at."
ft86,3adfkv,bertio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:59:09 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in critique.  I'm already aware that:   A single apex turn 2 works much better for lower power cars like the twins My apex of 3 could have been tighter Apex of 5 was way early (before the marker even) Could have carried a little more speed through 4, 9 and 10   Car is completely stock.  Tip: The GoPro Sportsman mount can clamp onto the review mirror shaft very well.  In this setup it's rock solid even when hitting the curbs.  If you're careful you can tuck the entire camera behind the mirror to the point where it's invisible from the drivers' seat.  It's also easy to route a USB cord through the edge of the headliner and down the right A pillar to the glove box power port.  If anyone is interested I can post a pic of how I mounted it."

I put the mount towards the back end but use a shoe string to tie up the pedal and hold it in place.   And having a bike on a BRZ definitely draws more attention.
ft86,3acg1v,montysgambit,6,Thu Jun 18 23:47:50 2015 UTC,You should let any car idle for at least 30-45 seconds. And then when you start driving flooring it while it's still cool is a bad idea
ft86,3acg1v,seifer666,6,Fri Jun 19 00:33:56 2015 UTC,"Oil is circulating after about 5 seconds, so you can drive it pretty much right away, especially with the stock 0w-20 oil. It's more important to let the oil warm up a little before going balls to the wall though. Idling the car for two hours allows this to be bypassed."
ft86,3acg1v,archaeauto,2,Fri Jun 19 04:07:23 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing this video of an engine with clear valve covers, shows how long it takes for oil to reach the rockers.

ft86,3acg1v,SupermansOlderBro,2,Fri Jun 19 04:44:14 2015 UTC,"Indeed, but that looks to be a custom built small block Chevy, which also looks like it's running some heavy oil. Those rocker arms are quite a ways from the oil pump. Quite different from our horizontal 2-liter boxers, which are known to have stout oil pumps. In either case, the main and rod bearings are oiled immediately, and once you rev it a little the valve train is completely oiled. The video is also good evidence of a need to let a large older engine design warm up for a bit (to take up tolerances and thin the oil)."

ft86,3ac7fc,KailyD_gt86,2,Fri Jun 19 23:17:56 2015 UTC,"while you're doing your build, drive the car and break it in before doing mods. Then do the upgrades in stages. Get the master brake cyl. brace installed, drive it around for awhile, and then do the steel lines. Do the tires and brake fluid last, because the OEM tires might suck for performance, they're fine for spirited driving. Each of these mods are quick and easy to do and it will feel so much better.   The brake fluid is of lesser importance until you're ready to start tracking your car, since under street conditions you'll never boil your fluid unless you do 100mph pulls back to back between stop lights. Plus high performance brake fluid is kind of expensive if you don't really need it."

ft86,3ac7fc,hickmatt,2,Fri Jun 19 02:20:02 2015 UTC,Oiled filters can sometimes cause problems on cars with MAF sensors.  The oil from the filter makes it's way to the MAF.   Some cars either have the MAF positioned in such a way that it does not deposit or have a cleaning process where the MAF wire is heated up to burn off any residues.  I prefer a dry filter such as the one HKS makes.

ft86,3a4so8,Shiftgood,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:21:56 2015 UTC,BRZ/FRS is a car. S2000 is more like a go-kart. The gas mileage wan't great and you found yourself at the gas station a lot because of the small tank. My S2K also had lots and lots of problems.   On the track the S2K feels twitchy and unsettled where the BRZ is fluid and composed. The power difference is negligible. (BRZ on stock tires is basically just as fast as S2K around a track.)  I do miss revving to 9K. and I do miss the spartan interior... definitely do not miss the convertible top and needing to spend $$ into safety equipment for the track.

In fact, the WRX is exactly what made me falter so long about making a decision.   I could walk across the same lot and for about the same money get a turbo, an extra 65 BHP, a center differential, and a usable back seat. The 86 is definitely better at what it's meant for, but it was always tough for me to shake the feeling that Subaru is giving you a lot more car in general for the money with the WRX.  I ended up stumbling across my FR-S used at a good price for my area, but the value-per-dollar thing was a lot harder when I was considering new."
ft86,3a4so8,fingerthief,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:11:40 2015 UTC,"The 86 has better handling than a WRX (except in the wet, but that's when the fun begins).

ft86,3a4so8,fingerthief,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:21:36 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, that's why I said ""the 86 is definitely better at what it's meant for.""  I'm talking more along the lines of the fact that you're getting the same block with forced induction strapped on and a markedly more complex drivetrain. When you consider the fact that you're going to spend $5-6k just to add FI to the 86, the WRX just plain seems to give you more for what you're paying. Especially when you consider that the base price of the WRX is $100 less than the BRZ.  The better in terms of the 86 is more about subjective quality, which is both harder to define and harder to sell. Like I said, I love my 86 dearly, but when you're sitting looking at ""where is the $25k+ I'm spending going?"" the WRX just gives you more to show for it."

After that I could never take then seriously even though I drove like, 4?  Focus ST was nice but didn't feel as fun as the Fiesta.   Sat in a FRS and it felt more like what I wanted out of a car. Drove it and knew I wanted it.   I would have gone with a S2000 or NC Miata (I bought about 14 months ago) but I need to carry my photo stuff. I can carry a TON in the FRS."

ft86,3a4so8,brzoomtx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:44:48 2015 UTC,It doesn't feel like a sports car. I went to the Ecoboost challenge to test drive one and it just felt tall. I felt like it was going tip over if I took a corner too fast. My problem might have been owning a miata though. Also the petals were really small.

Also, love it as my DD, I still have my old civic that I told myself I'd use for the daily grind, but it's fallen into disrepairish and I'm more than happy continuing to drive the BRZ"
ft86,3a0eky,Zugunfall,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:58:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would be going through a credit union as well. Have you had any problems compromising with the size?

ft86,3a0eky,Zugunfall,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:09:22 2015 UTC,"I do pretty well personally as a 6'4"" gentleman who often makes 2-4 hour trips on the weekend. Speaking from experience you can fit a whole set of wheels in the car, but then can't do simple stuff like fit a hard cooler in the trunk due to the shape of the opening.   Also due to my size I can never have more than 2 passengers. But my civic  was a coupe as well so it's not really changed much for me.   Only thing I've missed is not being able to just pop off the front wheel of my bike and fit it in the trunk."

ft86,3a0eky,commandar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:16:35 2015 UTC,"Re: Bike racks - your only real options are:   If you have quick releases on your bike, I've seen lots of reports that most bike frames should fit in the trunk with the back seat folded if you pull the front wheel off. I've been avoiding that because the trails in my area tend to be pretty messy and I don't want to get that inside the car. U-Haul makes a bolt-on tow hitch for around $180. I'm not a huge fan of having that semi-permanently hanging off the back of the car, personally. As /u/Zugunfall mentions, some people have fabricated towhook adapters that are basically rods that screw into the towhook mounts in the rear bumper that you can then attach a traditional roof rack bike carrier to. Seems to be the most ideal solution to me with the downside being that last I looked nobody was actively selling them.  There's lots of info ft86club with people discussing specs if you have a local machine shop that could fabricate them for you, though.   I've seen SeaSuckers used on this car, but given the thin glass on this car I'm not sure I'd trust it. The more traditional strap on racks are going to be a no-go due to both fit and the fact that the rear decklid is made of aluminum.  Needless to say, I haven't really gotten any riding in this season. haha"
ft86,3a0eky,kataxist,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:28:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figure if I really want to, I'll have to go the fabrication route. Honestly I haven't even tried to fit my bike in yet, just kinda assumed it wouldn't fit the frame cause it's a 58"" road bike."
ft86,3a0eky,Zugunfall,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:52:41 2015 UTC,I've seen guys saying they've fit similar sized bikes in. I haven't bothered trying just because I don't want to trash up the inside of the car.

ft86,3a0eky,Zugunfall,2,Sat Jun 20 23:48:15 2015 UTC,"you can get a better picture of the payments using a autoloan calculator. It really depends on your loan length and interest rate.   I drive the car daily in michigan with shit roads and snow. It gets the job done. I can fit one large suitcase and one bag in the trunk with some room for smaller things. You wont be fitting anything tall however. The backseats are for the most part, useless. You can put stuff there but they wont hold people unless you're shorter <5'8"" and sit where you're supposed to.  Other than that, the car is a great daily driver."

Even in 2-3"" you can safely drive 55mph, just remember to give yourself 10-12 seconds of following distance.  I would suggest not lowering the car.

ft86,39wp7l,frozensaliva,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:27:08 2015 UTC,"Too big and heavy for my tastes. But if I had to I'd get thicker sidewall tires even if it threw the speedo off a bit, and then color match the side marker with the car so it doesn't look like a chunk is missing from the fender."
ft86,39yjog,jinyang1590,9,Mon Jun 15 20:56:45 2015 UTC,"Boost pressure doesn't matter so much as the actual mass of air being moved. That's why typically engine limits are expressed in torque numbers. Usually the head gaskets are the first to go, and rods are the second, the power causes the head/rod bolts to stretch more than normal."
ft86,39yjog,SprungMS,3,Tue Jun 16 00:38:35 2015 UTC,This post should be up top.  The rods are the weakest point on this engine.
ft86,39yjog,CSG_Mike,2,Tue Jun 16 04:21:54 2015 UTC,"This is going to be a case by case basis, but ~325 rwhp and below people have been having good luck with.  Mine blew at 380 (just for reference) and was professionally installed / tuned.  Some of course have gone higher, just depends on how much you want to push your luck :)"
ft86,39yjog,blizzzbrz,3,Mon Jun 15 21:36:52 2015 UTC,"was this turbo or SC? also did you have all the necessary supporting mods? I have a feeling that due to the high compression ratio and thin cylinder walls, anything over 275 might be pushing luck as you say. How much did you engine rebuild cost?"
ft86,39yjog,blizzzbrz,3,Mon Jun 15 22:15:40 2015 UTC,"The rebuild was about $6k, dropped it to 10:1 compression and retuned.  In my case, the car blew up at the shop, so I never drove it with the stock engine while turbo-ed.  If I were doing it for the first time, I would still get the kit installed on the stock motor unless you want to really push the hp.  The issue you'll run into first is probably your octane requirement.  We've only got 2 liters to work with, so unless e85 is available in your area, you will be rather limited to what you can push out anyway.  To compensate for this (i don't have e85 in my area) I added water methanol injection on all my maps so I'm actually able to run about 440 rwhp on 93 octane gas on high boost.  When running on stock compression, with the same water meth setup I maxed out at about 384 rwhp on the same GT3076R turbo (although I was also running a slighty less efficient header which may have affected numbers a just a bit).  The kit was developed by PTuning in Manassas, VA   Edit: Since you were curious for boost levels, my high boost is about 21 psi"
ft86,39yjog,nico_o,3,Mon Jun 15 23:33:01 2015 UTC,"It might interest you that I'm going for a longer term lower power build shooting for longevity. Currently putting down around 250-260whp on E85 (pass a station every day to work, I'm lucky) at only 7psi. Using the SBD kit (same as Greddy but with a 20G). Tune is my own, and I believe tunes to have the most to do with keeping this engine alive. I'll build the motor and drop compression before going over 350whp."
ft86,39yjog,itburnzwhenipee,3,Tue Jun 16 04:20:42 2015 UTC,"on E85 with P&L turbo kit i'm running 10psi.  No problems yet. This has put me around 400hp.  I did switch to Act 6 puck clutch replacement before pushing it though.  Also, new brake lines and pads."
ft86,39yjog,Suck_A_Fat_One_,2,Wed Jun 17 02:40:23 2015 UTC,All you have is a turbo kit and got 200 hp? That's crazy.
ft86,39yjog,itburnzwhenipee,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:39:36 2015 UTC,E85 and fuel pump/injectors.  Didnt think those counted towards the discussion of breakable parts.
ft86,39yjog,pblack09,4,Mon Jun 22 22:14:17 2015 UTC,Good question and I look forward to some good answers.  I just want to piggyback this thread and ask about what is the peak HP/torque the engine can get going NA and what would that take?
ft86,39yjog,JimmyD101,3,Mon Jun 15 23:11:58 2015 UTC,I think you could probably add 15-20 Kws with new exhaust and custom Ecu?
ft86,39yjog,brzoomtx,2,Tue Jun 16 01:16:27 2015 UTC,N/A you're not going to go much beyond 200whp/150-155wtq. Will you go above that? Depends on the day and the dyno. This is definitely the ballpark maximum for now until better intake manifold and cam options are available.
ft86,39yjog,brzoomtx,3,Tue Jun 16 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"with the ACE 4-2-1 header, tune, and e70 you can add just shy of 40 HP according to This review done by Counterspace Garage i'd imagine with e85 and a full exhaust and intake you'd be able to eek out a little more."
ft86,39y12b,DC_East,4,Mon Jun 15 18:46:58 2015 UTC,"Probably legit. But, they might be the 1st gen versions which I've heard had some problems with the LEDs dying early."
ft86,39y12b,teek0001,3,Mon Jun 15 22:04:11 2015 UTC,"You could be right, any way to check this?"
ft86,39y12b,AJ7861,2,Tue Jun 16 03:07:49 2015 UTC,"IIRC it was the turn signal LEDs that were dying prematurely and singularly, so only way to check I guess is once a week throw your turn signals on and have a look, though I got mine a while ago and I was told about the issue they had with the gen 1 valentis so they were pretty quick to fix the issue I doubt you will have any trouble man, ebay is pretty legit and if those pictures are truly what you bought you can see the valenti on the bottom of the light, hope that makes you feel somewhat at ease"

I wrapped my header and overpipe and it seems to have kept temps down.  I also got an extra sheet of the sticky reflective stuff and went to town on my oilpan and water pump outlet.  I have pretty much the same setup except a 60s exhaust.  I agree about the quality of everything and glad I spent the coin on it.  If nothing else the weight savings were well worth it.

ft86,39rkfp,Davesnotheree,5,Sun Jun 14 06:06:42 2015 UTC,You should consider getting the front end wrapped in the .3mm clear wrap. As the paint is really weak.
ft86,39rkfp,0xBEEFBEEF,2,Sun Jun 14 04:04:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up! I've  actually been looking into doing something like that the past few days. I had a Scion tC before this, and the paint was the same way. I'm thinking I might do the wrap + Ammonyc's Defense Coat. One of my friend's is really big on detailing cars (he has a pristine 2007 335i on bags), and he swears by the stuff."
ft86,39rkfp,randillio,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:03:27 2015 UTC,"I did the wrap, it's worth the money imo. FYI, XPEL seems to be better than 3M and has a 10 year warranty.  In my opinion AMMO products are overpriced. You can find suitable equivalents that are just as good at detailer's domain online. For example I use the Sonax Polymer Net Shield for protection. Really easy application."
ft86,39rkfp,GeekPlaya,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:52:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendation. Something a bit cheaper would be great haha. $65 for the defense coat is a bit painful.

ft86,39rkfp,elthomas21,4,Sun Jun 14 06:32:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure myself. I guess a few things contributed. One big reason is because other family members who can't drive a standard will probably use it from time to time. Primarily my mom. She really wants to drive it since she hasn't driven a sports car since her 1977 Z28 Camaro was run over by a garbage truck in the early 90s, and when I told her about the FR-S, she was so excited to drive it. She's terrified of driving a manual though.  And to be completely honest, I've just always wanted a car with paddle shifters. I know the manual is the golden standard, but I thought the FR-S's auto trans would be perfect. I can be lazy and drive through stop-and-go bumper-to-bumper traffic in auto mode, then when  I want to have some fun, use the paddles."

ft86,39pg3l,applesauce516,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:53:25 2015 UTC,One reason why people do is this way is because they don't have to drill through the bumper in order to mount the license plate.  This kit screws into the tow hook spot so no drilling necessary.

I had some on my car for a while, and found that they didn't do much for actual rain/mud from driving on the highway. Plus, I felt they looked kinda dorky and disingenuous (not a rally car) so I took them off. Personal preference, though.  They were well made and fairly easy to install, so there's that."
ft86,39ojjn,cywinr,2,Sat Jun 13 17:53:36 2015 UTC,They are on my list of things to get eventually. I find I get quite a bit of kickup on the side panels that I could avoid with flaps. Right now I drive through so many road construction zones that I might as well be off-roading....

ft86,39lgac,pblack09,2,Fri Jun 12 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"My 17x9s are +45. +40 would help a 9.5 distribute the extra width between inside and outside but would still add a couple millimeters on the inside and a bit more than a half-centimeter on the outside.  It's not likely to cause much trouble, but you'll definitely need to be aware of rub and minimize it. You'll also be running out nearer the fenders at that point so ride height is also going to come into the mix, particularly up front.  Have you seen photos of that fitment done square? I haven't looked in a while but one of the big ft86 forum sites had a pretty good catalogue of fitments with various sizes and offsets, and photos for many of them."
ft86,39lgac,throbbingpickle,2,Fri Jun 12 21:08:24 2015 UTC,I have 255/40/R17 on 17x9 w/ +28 offset on all 4 corners. It doesn't rub even at full lock. However it is slightly wider than the stock fenders

This is almost definitely engine oil, your bushings don't have grease that can leak like that. I think the TSB said something about one of the cam actuators on the right side.

According to posters in that thread and others scattered around, the regular gasoline found at most American gas stations these days has additives that are causing a lubrication problem. The most common solution is to add a small amount of 2-cycle engine oil (<1oz per 5 gallons) to each tank of gas, which may sound risky but is really pretty safe. 2-cycle oil is designed to disperse evenly in the tank, to burn very cleanly and not to foul spark plugs or injectors even at high concentrations.

I wanted to see the size of the back seats, the shape/feel of the seats, the visibility, the general size of the car, the quality of the interior -- non driving stuff.  I suggest you do the same.  The one thing I will say though, is after a half hour in the car, my back (just under my shoulders) was killing me where it felt like the seats were pinching my sides (I'm maybe 6'0"" ~165lbs so, not a huge man).  I'm not sure if it was just that specific seat or what, but I've had no such problems with my BRZ's seats.  So I wouldn't let something like that (if it happens) entirely push you off it."

ft86,39bvu3,YouShallKnow,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:15:21 2015 UTC,"If you read my comment I just posted, it's actually not supposed to be covered. They probably handed you the line about warranty because regardless of whether it should be covered, it would definitely not be covered for you."
ft86,39bvu3,SprungMS,2,Wed Jun 10 20:25:12 2015 UTC,Toyota corporate specifically told me it would be covered if I was under 36k.  Maybe Subaru is more stingy.
ft86,39bvu3,YouShallKnow,2,Wed Jun 10 23:16:21 2015 UTC,This is covered under warranty. I got mine replaced at ~15K no fuss.
ft86,39bvu3,scalablecory,2,Thu Jun 11 00:34:31 2015 UTC,"Had the same issue, with a FRS. Took it to the dealer and they replaced both tail lights with no charge."
ft86,39bvu3,Zamekesil,2,Thu Jun 11 01:25:17 2015 UTC,If you search this subreddit I posted the appropriate TSB numbers for each car on another thread. At the airport and can't sift through posts atm. They're covered on both cars up to 36k
ft86,39bvu3,Zugunfall,2,Thu Jun 11 20:08:16 2015 UTC,My BRZ had this issue too. Got the car in summer 2012 and actually had to have it replaced twice. The first time didn't change anything. Subaru told me the second time that the actually redesigned it. No issue.  Warranty covered it. I didn't pay a cent for either replacement
ft86,39bvu3,_scottyb,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:07:19 2015 UTC,"I believe there is actually a special coverage bulletin for this. EDIT: According to Subaru... This is normal on days where the high and low temperatures are extreme. ""Replacement of headlamp and/or rear combination lamp assemblies for this condition is not a matter for warranty."" But I would still talk to your dealer. If you have standing water they might make an exception. There is also a TSB for insects getting into the tail lights, it looks like the fix is a redesigned gasket.   Hope you don't mind pictures of computer screens.  http://imgur.com/u8kZVrJ http://imgur.com/l5ObyHJ"
ft86,39bvu3,SprungMS,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:12:33 2015 UTC,"This doesn't account for the standing water in the taillights, though. Maybe it's a matter of recall, not warranty."
ft86,39bvu3,KariganWayne,2,Mon Jun 15 13:00:45 2015 UTC,"Well after I posted it I was thinking about it. They probably have the TSB to try to turn people away for smaller condensation issues. If you have standing water the TSB wouldn't apply and you could express your disappointment with the concern, likely leading to a warranty replacement. It basically leaves it open for the service manager to decide how they want to deal with the customer."

ft86,3997yf,VFPolite,2,Wed Jun 10 04:31:26 2015 UTC,I can see what you mean. I did my front grill and actually really like it. I had some extra tape left over and decided seeing what I could do with the back and this was the result.

ft86,3998d5,YouShallKnow,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:02:07 2015 UTC,"It's kind of hard to say their exact effectiveness, since you can't (in a reasonable or simple way) track your brake temperature. One could theoretically do a couple laps and use thermal imagery or something to actually test that, I suppose...   On a track where you're doing a lot of heavy braking, anything you can do to help your brakes in the short and long term is a good thing, especially for such a small investment."

As a one-box design without B-pillars, styled by Patrick Le Quément, the Avantime combined the space of an MPV with the style of a 2+2 coupé.  The name is a portmanteau of the French word ""Avant"" (meaning ""ahead"") and the English word ""time"" — with the latter using the English /taɪm/ rather than French pronunciation /tiːm/.

ft86,398h7p,GrammarBeImportant,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:27:44 2015 UTC,If anything it helps keep carbon build up down. It does hurt oil however so oil changes should be done sooner.
ft86,398h7p,CSG_Mike,2,Wed Jun 10 01:42:31 2015 UTC,"The exact opposite of this.  E85 has no detergents, so it doesn't prevent the build up.  YOu want to still run quality 91/92/93 here and there, to help prevent that."
ft86,398h7p,Draco-REX,2,Wed Jun 10 02:22:55 2015 UTC,This guy is right. And he probably has more experience with the fa20 than everybody else on this subreddit combined.
ft86,398h7p,KrispV9,2,Thu Jun 11 17:53:07 2015 UTC,"It's just general E85 knowledge, nothing FA20 specific.  The problem is somewhat similar to the DI only engines that VW produces; they have had issues with carbon build up on the valves because the gasoline isn't keeping the valves clean, since it's only injected directly inside the cylinder.  The newer DI-only cars mitigate this by using pseudo-Atkinson cycles to force some fuel (intake charge) out the intake valves to keep them clean..."
ft86,398h7p,Draco-REX,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:10:46 2015 UTC,"It will eventually break down the fuel filter.  Luckily, you're going flex fuel.  Going back to gas in the colder months (if it gets cold where you are) will help with starts and reduce the effects of using ethanol.  If you live in a warm climate year round, run a tank of gas once or twice a year to clean the system."

ft86,398h7p,hype-armor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:25:02 2015 UTC,"The stock fuel system is VERY robust.  Because there are both Port and Direct injectors, each set capable of running the engine on their own, the pump has to be able to feed all of them.  The end result is that you only need a tune to go E85 in these cars."
ft86,398h7p,scalablecory,3,Wed Jun 10 01:28:22 2015 UTC,"It scales from 50% DI/PI to 100% DI. It never runs both at full volume. There's clearly some amount of wiggle room (I'm running an E85 tune, myself), but it's not like they designed it to run double the amount of fuel."
ft86,398h7p,hype-armor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:32:38 2015 UTC,Can you provide a source for that? I looked for a bit and couldn't find anything about the conditions DI and PI would be in use.

ft86,398h7p,GrammarBeImportant,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:03:53 2015 UTC,It's darn close.  I'm running E85 and a Sprintex 210 blower with a 70mm pulley.  That's about 300rwhp.  So nearly doubling the engine's output plus the added 30% for ethanol has got to be really close to double the stock fuel flow.
ft86,397cd9,Itsinthefrakkinship,3,Tue Jun 9 19:55:07 2015 UTC,"You're not going to be getting much of a discount by getting a 2015 due to the fact that the 2015 and 2016 is essentially the same car, probably around $1k off at the most. Also subaru does not inflate their MSRP just so they can give you what seems like a ""huge discount"" at the dealer. So as long as you're around $30,000.00 for the car out the door you're doing fine. Subaru does offer an extended warranty, but its up to you to decide if its worth it for you or not. If you're planning to keep it stock and own it for a while, might be worth it for you to get the extended warranty."
ft86,397cd9,jinyang1590,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:17:18 2015 UTC,Ah that's a good point. Think I should just get a 16 or take that 1k off and get a 15?

ft86,397cd9,jinyang1590,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:33:15 2015 UTC,"The 1K now might seem like a good deal, but you also have to consider re-sale value and depreciation. Couple years down the line if you ever decide to sell the car, the 2015 will bag you less coin than the 2016. Although the older the car the smaller that gap will be. Its up to you and what your plans are with the car."

Got the finance rate down to 1.5  It was 0.0 for the 2015 but I wanted the 2016 :P.  1000 off for new grad etc. Base manual model in asphalt grey. Came to 31775 after all taxes and fees.  I hear everywhere that if Toyota discounts scion they can loose the ability to sell scion, who knows if that's true but I've seen some dealers discount up to 1500 for scion but there are heavy admin fees that they tack on anyway.   In this case the vehicle price, with added tax and  i think there are environment and license plate fees or something.. was the cost I paid,   Let me know if you got some sort of deal"

ft86,393xx0,Anonymous_Cog,7,Tue Jun 9 02:15:18 2015 UTC,"Ouch. I had the same experience.  Advice #1: if you need a starting point, contact your local detailers and ask who they recommend. They work on paint all day, and they'll usually have a favorite shop.  Advice #2: look at the cars in the shop's lot. The best shops will have some high-end sports cars and some tuner cars waiting for repairs.  Advice #3: and finally, it sounds like you know this already but repeating it doesn't hurt: a good shop will have an honest reputation with the insurance people servicing their area and will be able to do all repairs 100% in budget. There is no good reason to go with an insurance company's recommended body shop."

Whenever I have the urge to redline the car or put it through the gears, I just pop it into manual and either use the paddle shifters or use the knob. I like having that option. Sometimes I just want to drive it like a normal automatic and not worry about shifting.   It's been 6 months and no regrets so far. I'm still learning what this thing can do in the different modes. :-)"
ft86,391n14,jaxspider,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:59:52 2015 UTC,OH! I thought it was a fully automatic! My older car also can go from auto to manual and I loved that fact! Thanks so much man!

It would suck to learn that after waiting all that time, and finally getting your brand spanking new car, its already outdated (granted, not much will be different 2015 vs 2016). Chances are, your dealer already has a few ordered, and if they don't or all the ordered ones are accounted for, they can source one that is available domestically. I would wait for the 2016 to be in stock at least for the sake of re-sale value."

But he did say if the 2016 was out then I would get that one instead and the price differnece wouldnt be that big.

Also, welcome to the family.  Also I don't believe the windows come tinted but your dealership will more than likely be able to do it on the same morning it arrives, I got lucky and walked in the day they put a new manual model on display, I was driving it that afternoon and had windows tinted and interior/exterior protection done in the few hours I was gone to the bank."

They did the interior with the same brand of stuff and there's no markings on the seats, just a couple small marks from shoes on the foot rest or whatever you wanna call it, but even with that i'm sure detailing would bring it out. I know this much, it cost around 2k just for the protection shit, and they threw in window tint on top."

No down payment. Do keep in mind the informational APR that takes into account the cash rebates you are forgoing. My informational APR was around 2%.
ft86,391ktu,LuisFMart,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:48:07 2015 UTC,"For everyone saying 0.9%, that was/is a special financing offer. Your credit score has nothing to do with it to qualify for the promo. Without the promo, you're looking at ~3% with a 750+ credit score.  Edit: bought a new FR-S a month ago"

Blue has been used in the heraldry of the French monarchy since at least the 12th century, with the golden fleurs-de-lis of the kings always set on a blue (heraldic ""azure"") background. A brighter version, based on the blue of the French Tricolour, is used in modern times, particularly in a sporting context. French national teams in all sports will normally use blue as their main colour.  Blue is France's national racing colour, therefore several French motorsport teams have used it, including Alpine, Amilcar, Ballot, Bugatti, Delage, Delahaye, Gordini, Ligier, Mathis, Matra, Panhard, Pescarolo Sport, Prost Grand Prix, Rondeau, Salmson, Talbot-Lago, Voisin. The two notable exceptions are Citroën and Renault: the former has used red and white, whereas the latter has used yellow and black.

ft86,38vy6e,bsarocker,4,Sun Jun 7 07:47:39 2015 UTC,"Then start reading and learning? All the info you need is there and on the internet. You do need to do actual research into SAI roll center, caster,  camber etc. randomly buying the wrong parts will for sure get you into trouble. Suspension just like most aspects of vehicle tuning are cause and effect. Why the rant?  For instance if you want to autox you need to figure out the class you are enthused to drive in then learn the rules. The rules will dictate your modification limitations etc."
ft86,38vy6e,bsarocker,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:12:38 2015 UTC,"I suppose the rant is because it's far more complicated than I believed it would be, my goal is more track oriented than autox, I am doing research and will continue until I figure out what may be the best setup for me.

ft86,38vy6e,Draco-REX,2,Sun Jun 7 10:06:07 2015 UTC,"If you want to learn about suspension, there are two books I highly recommend.    Tune to Win by Carroll Smith    How to Make Your Car Handle by Fred Puhn    Both are excellent at explaining how suspensions work.  The first deals mostly with ideal racecar suspensions, but it does a great job explaining the hows and whys. (You can ignore the aerodynamics section).  The second deals with more conventional suspensions you find in street cars.  While both cover similar topics, seeing the same concepts explained from two different directions really make them clear.    As for where to start with your car, you want to start simple.     Track pads.  The stock brake system uses components from cars with more power and much more weight (WRX front calipers, Legacy rear calipers).  But the stock pads cannot handle the heat from track use.  So get some good track pads (I used Carbotech XP-10s at Mid Ohio and was very happy with them).   Tires.  Sticky tires are what you want.  The stockers are great for hooning, but poor for performance.  Pick up some good tires that handle heat well (Hankook RS3, Yokohama Advan AD08)  They'll work for AutoX and Track use.   Crash bolts for the front and rear camber bushings/adjustable LCAs for the rear.  The stock alignment has essentially 0 camber all around.  Again, good for hooning, bad for performance.  Getting crash bolts and some way to adjust rear camber will let you get a real alignment on the car to make the most of the stock suspension.  I tried sticky tires on a fully stock suspension and while handling was improved at 8/10ths, beyond that the car would go into understeer like a lightswitch.     The only other advice I would offer would be to put the stability control in sport mode.  You won't know where the car's limits are at the speeds you will be reaching.  The VCS Sport mode will give you a bit of a safety net.  Ignore the people who tell you to shut everything off or go into ""Pedal Dance"" mode your first time on the track.  Learn the car, learn its limits, and most importantly, learn YOUR limits before you decide to do everything yourself.    Have fun and be safe!"

ft86,38vy6e,cywinr,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"The stock suspension is amazing.  Get used to it a bit, then build your suspension modifications based on what you want (less body roll, stiffer springs, lower ride height, more/less oversteer).   With track suspension questions, there's a thread on the forums with a RCE and CSG dudes giving advice (including /u/csg_mike who gives amazing advice).   Once you start to have specific wants and questions, it's much easier to learn."

ft86,38ebpi,SprungMS,2,Wed Jun 3 23:49:46 2015 UTC,It idles faster for the exact reason you're supposed to drive immediately. Warms up all the emissions stuff so the car can run better.
ft86,38ebpi,TheHapaOne,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:55:40 2015 UTC,I don't think an extra 7-800 Rpms for 20-30 sec is going to warm any emissions stuff up.   I believe it is more for proper lubrication and oil flow when the motor is cold.

There were a couple other maps I had to edit to get all of the startup correction for emissions gone. I have no cats, and a stock catback, and Jesus was this car loud on startup until I cleaned all that shit up. Now it starts and the first hit seems like it'll be loud and then it idles quietly just like I want. Still a slight high idle with corrections for coolant and ambient temps, and I'm pretty sure I left about 4-6 other maps alone because they didn't help with the noise. If anyone else needs help with what I just described, I'm tuned on brzedit, and I can tell you exactly which maps I had to tweak."

ft86,38ahj2,ibumpbeats,29,Tue Jun 2 23:10:03 2015 UTC,"Story time: Someone was parked in my assigned parking spot, so I had their car towed (I know you guys might think this is dick. Our apartment complex gives us assigned parking spaces and a tow card to provide to the tow company since in my area people are not the most respectful of others. In the past I have left a note on the person's car and parked at a distance, but today I was not in the mood to inconvenience myself). Anyways, I moved my car to the space in this video, and set up my camera to record in case the person who's car was towed wanted to vandalize my car. This guy walks by a few minutes later (he is not the owner of the towed car) and clearly purposely hits my car with what he is holding in his hand. I thought it was keys and I was furious, so I ran out and checked my car. There were no scratches. I double checked the video since I did not want to approach him without being sure of what I saw. As you guys can see, it was clear as day that he purposely smacked and dragged something along my car with whatever was in his right hand.  I sprinted over and found the guy, and nicely asked him why he felt the need to hit my car with his keys. He explained he was holding a bag of dog poo, and that he would never hit my car on purpose.

The FR-S has always been the cheaper of the two (Excluding the alleged better stereo sound quality). The seats being one of the most obvious comparisons.

Skipped first brake fluid flush, I'm doing it at 60K when I do spark plugs which I don't expect to be cheap. TBH, the only thing this car needs is oil changes, tires, and an occasional air filter. one or 2 cabin filters and intake filters with 4 oil changes would have me thinking awfully hard about not paying $300 up front for maintenance."

ft86,389ci6,Sufficial,2,Wed Jun 3 02:41:39 2015 UTC,"I just zip tied mine to the ""grill"" area.. im sure as hell not drilling the bumper on my brand new car.. thats just crazy talk."
ft86,389ci6,LordTaikun,2,Tue Jun 2 22:24:42 2015 UTC,"I got a third party plate mount and put it on just below the bumper on the grill itself. The upper part of the FRS where it is ""solid"". There are actually two tiny indentations where I put in self tapping screws. Yes, it is technically drilling into the car, but it is not in the bumper itself. If I hit it hard, it would probably rip off. But over a year in and it has stayed on fine. It does hang down a bit into the ""open"" grill part, but I haven't had any overheating issues with airflow. And with the plate angled parallel with the face of the grill (angled inward from vertical), I think it is a good compromise of having it at all. In TX where I've heard the fine has gone way up and it is being enforced if stopped for other reasons (i.e. speeding)."
ft86,389ci6,EnjoyingMyCoffee,2,Wed Jun 3 02:17:38 2015 UTC,Get a tow hook license plate mount. Saves you from drilling into the bumper.

ft86,38bi2l,The_Quaker,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"^ this exactly.  To be honest, looking at the trap speed at the 1/4 mile mark is a better indicate of how ""fast"" a car is.  ""Quickness"" is really determined by the E.T.  Some cars can run some really good ETs because they're better set up for launching the car (better tires, suspension etc), but it's the MPH trap speed that tells the true story since trap will stay relatively consistent regardless of the launch because that is based solely on power."

ft86,37z0i8,elthomas21,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:50:53 2015 UTC,"No. Thanks to the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act, aftermarket parts don't void your warranty and it's up to the dealer to prove that a specific part caused a problem.  Some people buy TRD parts in the belief that they won't void their warranty, but the only difference from the rest of the aftermarket is that Toyota will include them in the car's existing warranty if they are installed by a Toyota dealer.  As for an axleback or catback, on this car those are just good for looks and sound and won't give any significant performance change so there's no risk of harm anyway."

ft86,3812ob,abdgloria,3,Mon Jun 1 02:00:05 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue years ago; a woman backed into me in a parking lot and dented the front fender of my RX7. After not hearing anything for a few weeks I called my insurance agent, who contacted her company, and I called her directly.   She said she thought I was at fault... Because, you know, it's entirely possible to drive into someone with the side of your car."

She later claimed that I was at fault and her admitting on paper meant nothing here in California. My insurance ended up saying we were both at fault.  Fuck triple aaa"

ft86,37z5ev,aemsk,1 point,Sun May 31 20:59:59 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I had wanted something different than the usual flat black.  The one hint I can offer is that the metallizer is like a must of metal particles - it can't really be sprayed in the same manner as normal dip.  I did three very quick swipes per wheel.  It also gets everywhere so if it's windy...Be prepared for your car to look like a faerie exploded nearby.
ft86,37z5ev,phobos512,1 point,Sun May 31 23:38:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah the metallizer comes out REALLY fast. I wanted to have a gold flake on black and one pass of the same 8"" away spray i used for the black coats gave me shiny gold"
ft86,37z5ev,Botmaniac,2,Mon Jun 1 01:31:47 2015 UTC,It's always a good idea to try things like paint/dip on something you don't care about before using them on something you do.  I tested the metallizer on one of the flat black dip caps I had lying around.  Really glad I did too.

ft86,37zrha,seifer666,1 point,Sun May 31 20:07:08 2015 UTC,So you think it would be okay to use the oft even while I'm fully stock? I'd use 93 octane. I figured it would help smoothen out the torque dip and I could re flash as I added more aftermarket parts!
ft86,37zrha,phobos512,5,Sun May 31 20:31:15 2015 UTC,Absolutely OFT is worth it even if totally stock.  Tuning is ALWAYS worth it.
ft86,37zrha,DanBRZ,3,Sun May 31 20:54:32 2015 UTC,I'm fully stock (Drop in filter) with OFT and it's a huge difference.
ft86,37zrha,kd-bar,1 point,Sun May 31 23:17:59 2015 UTC,Heya. Can you specify what kind of difference? Maybe numbers or a dyno? I only ask because I'm considering getting the oft 91 with everything else stock. I'm hoping it helps a lot with the torque dip around 3k. What kind of improvement have you noticed??
ft86,37zrha,DanBRZ,2,Mon Jun 1 01:20:11 2015 UTC,It helps with the torque dip a lot. There's plenty of Dyno numbers over on ft86 club. Your looking at ~10hp gain on 91

The cars are Japanese in design and they don't use ethanol over there so it seems to be a design oversight.  It doesn't affect performance at all just makes our cars sound ten years old. You'll hear them more in the warmer months too usually in the lower RPM ranges. There's a TSB out for them to replace the pump but it doesn't actually fix the problem since it'll come back after a short while.   TLDR. It's the high pressure fuel pump dissagreeing with the ethanol, not a big deal."

They've put out 4+ versions of this HPFP and I've swapped in 3 of them, none of which did anything. I'd hoped they'd added muffling insulation around the pump body like other OEMs but no such luck.

ft86,37ujxm,MethBear,2,Sat May 30 22:07:55 2015 UTC,Ahh right i get it. I haven't heard them at all on my gt86. Possibly something to do with different quality of fuel here in the UK?
ft86,37ujxm,nkofferman,9,Sat May 30 17:03:40 2015 UTC,"Probably different additives in UK fuel (and no 10% ethanol added?).     In America we like to put corn in everything (soda, gas, children...).   We'd have no reason to keep the state of Iowa otherwise."
ft86,37ujxm,MethBear,1 point,Sat May 30 19:13:31 2015 UTC,I think the deal with US gas is that we're trying to save the planet so we use a certain % of corn to reduce out consumption of petroleum. The problem with ethanol is that it burns at a different temperature than regular petroleum that is where I believe the chirps come from.  I think most other countries don't even bother mixing ethanol into their which is why you've probably never heard of the issue.
ft86,37ujxm,RudigerSimpson,2,Sat May 30 22:06:24 2015 UTC,Save the environment is how it's marketed but really it's because farmers get subsidies for growing corn. So too much corn? Let's put some in the fuel! Thanks Monsanto :/

They told him that some motors tend to have this valve drive / valve train which is within the tolerance limit and nothing to be concerned about.
ft86,37ujxm,Draco-REX,1 point,Sat May 30 15:05:22 2015 UTC,"I can't find it right now, but there was a thread on FT86Club where someone disassembled a HPFP, calipered/mic'd all the parts, and put them in an engineering software and determined exactly which seal was making the noise.  His conclusion was the same.  It's a tolerance thing and has no effect on performance.    That's the big reason why I havne't taken mine in for that recall.  No need for the fuel smell/leakage from the repair if there's no real problem to fix in the first place.  Another reason is that I've heard crickets/typewriter noises from Audis.  If Audi owners don't flip out over the noise, I don't think it's a big deal."
ft86,37ujxm,DevanteWeary,2,Sat May 30 21:28:26 2015 UTC,]     So is it a seal or is it the use of ethanol in America's fuel? I hear both reasons.
ft86,37ujxm,Draco-REX,1 point,Sun May 31 03:53:42 2015 UTC,"Likely both.  The tighter tolerances mean the ethanol matters.    That said, I run E85 in my car and I don't notice the crickets any more..."

ft86,37ujxm,Draco-REX,1 point,Sun May 31 17:07:47 2015 UTC,"Ethanol is alcohol, whereas gas is petroleum.  Ethanol isn't going to be able to lubricate as well as gas (which isn't all that great a lubricant anyways).

The base EB ""stang"" is 28k here - which is actually cheaper than the currency conversion would be at 25k USD.  Anyway, the entire point of adding the comment in the first place was that the driving experience of the premium V6 was similar to the FRS. More power, a little less nimble, but other perks to make up for it.  If shopping around for a 2 door sports coupe for sub 30k, there wasn't a lot of options.

ft86,37qd8b,LostSalad,4,Sat May 30 09:08:12 2015 UTC,It is a very common theme for new or overconfident drivers of rear wheel drive vehicles to turn of traction and/or stability control and immediately wreck.
ft86,37qd8b,phobos512,7,Sat May 30 14:38:12 2015 UTC,And this sub is chock full of people that wrecked after turning traction control off for the first time.
ft86,37qd8b,QuickStopRandal,3,Sat May 30 17:37:48 2015 UTC,"Ahem.. yup, was on a night ride, turned everything off to play in an empty parking lot and had forgotten about that fact on my way home.. put too much power down coming off a roundabout (UK) expecting VSC to kick in and the car whipped on exit, spun out into a lamp post. Luckily only damaged the driver side door.. more embarrassing than anything!  Needless to say, on public roads, VSC Sport is the only button I'll be pressing on that panel from now on."
ft86,37qd8b,adam144,5,Mon Jun 1 14:49:20 2015 UTC,"Yup, I was guilty once.  I freaked out over the crickets.  Eventually got the fuel pump replaced, now the crickets are not so loud but still there.  So what?  I drove the car though a winding hilly road at dusk in a very wooded area yesterday, and what a ride that was.  Come to think of it, I should have been worried about hitting a dear..."
ft86,37qd8b,JohnnyBeagle,4,Fri May 29 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my crickets came back. It has something to do with the twins being choosy with fuel I think. Wish I could try out > 91 octane over here"
ft86,37qd8b,aceangel3k,3,Fri May 29 17:47:59 2015 UTC,I just learned to accept it and play the radio a wee bit louder!
ft86,37qd8b,JohnnyBeagle,3,Fri May 29 17:54:32 2015 UTC,Another alternative is exhaust work.  I pretty much can't hear my crickets unless I'm alone in a parking lot which is pretty rare.
ft86,37qd8b,phobos512,2,Sat May 30 14:40:06 2015 UTC,"I wonder if I truly have crickets or if it's just quiet enough that I don't notice or care. Someone pointed it out at an autocross as a joke but I didn't hear it really. I mean, it was very faint for me. Not sure but I think I'm either lucky or tone deaf."
ft86,37qd8b,cerealcable,2,Sat May 30 05:22:15 2015 UTC,"Tone deaf means an inability to carry a tune, not an inability to hear ;) The chirp is pretty high in frequency though so it's certainly possible a person might not be able to hear it due to hearing loss."
ft86,37qd8b,phobos512,2,Sat May 30 14:41:27 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think I'm not going deaf yet...I'm not that old yet! I think the crickets are exaggerated, but maybe I'm wrong and going deaf."

ft86,37qd8b,Draco-REX,4,Sat May 30 01:46:21 2015 UTC,He probably also loves the much lower maintenance costs.
ft86,37qd8b,AMW1011,2,Sat May 30 22:49:01 2015 UTC,I don't think maintenance costs matter to him.

The most memorable one was I went to pass a mini van on the highway, he decided to accelerate to 90mph, which was 25mph over, then slow down to 55mph, 10mph below when I gave up and got behind him. He did this for 4-5 attempts I made to pass, I wasn't in the mood for getting a ticket. I noticed on the 3rd attempt he had his entire family in the car, so I called the police to notify them.

ft86,37rvjj,pblack09,3,Sat May 30 01:35:13 2015 UTC,"Short term with no mods, you could argue you'd just get the placebo effect. You can maybe hear and feel some difference, but to me it didn't feel like anything special.  Long term, very valuable. If you get a header, want to go flex fuel, need to reflash to stock for whatever reason, it's definitely worth your money. It's so easy to use, no need for a tuner with training, premade maps for the car, and it saves your stock tune before rewritting anything in case you need to go back.  Although if you want to sell your OFT, you need to reflash back to stock in order to wipe the tablet for a new car."
ft86,37rvjj,iJeff,2,Sat May 30 02:30:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.  Do they usually charge extra for updated tunes down the line?   Only upgrade I'd be considering down the line is a header to get rid of the infamous torque dip. I don't actually have my FRS yet though.
ft86,37rvjj,pblack09,2,Sat May 30 03:02:51 2015 UTC,"There are premade tunes for the car that you won't need to change unless you want to get crazy. They're all free also.  There's pretty much 2 different tunes to select from:   Stage 1 = No mods, just a tune Stage 2 = Aftermarket catless header installed   There are other tunes available from download on their site, but those are pretty much betas and it's more reliable to go with what Shiv at OFT has made."
ft86,37rvjj,Sufficial,0,Sat May 30 06:38:25 2015 UTC,"To put it simply, it feels like what the 200 hp should have felt like in the first place. You hear everyone say its a ""placebo effect"" which may be true but to an extent really. I think it depends on which tune you use also.  I downloaded and tried two tunes. The first one i was very underwhelmed, i couldnt really tell if there was a difference at all, just a more responsive throttle. The second one i punched it on the street and i felt the difference. It pushed me back more, my rpms rose faster compared to stock. Not sure if its much more of a difference in speed, but it feels a lot more fun than before. This is where i cancel the placebo effect because i tried both back and forth, and that second tune does feel A LOT better.  Also, launch control is pretty cool too."

ft86,37r3rz,richardmartin,3,Fri May 29 21:38:35 2015 UTC,"but it came with OEM sti parts.. the wheels, the lip kit, rear spats, they all have STI on them. So everyone who bought the series blue trim is lame? even though it's the limited run highest trim of BRZ?  your logic makes no sense... subaru also announced that the BRZ STI will not feature a turbo so the no turbo thing is not even an argument.

ft86,37r3rz,BRZ4ME,2,Fri May 29 21:53:15 2015 UTC,"Not a high school kid but I kind of agree with seifer. A trunk badge isn't an upgraded oem part like wheels, front lip or side skirts.

ft86,37r3rz,richardmartin,-1,Sat May 30 03:08:40 2015 UTC,"having sti wheels is, sort of a point in your favor  however,  if an STI version does come out thats even more reason you should NOT have the badge since you do not have that car. I never said the word turbo."
ft86,37r3rz,KrispV9,5,Fri May 29 22:21:16 2015 UTC,When the Sti Brz comes out in two years I'll take the badges off. The amount of hate for no reason about this is getting on my nerves

ft86,37r3rz,KrispV9,1 point,Sat May 30 13:11:45 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah I know right. The series blue is basically the NA version of tS. I just hate getting shit for the badges when the car came with Sti branding all over from factory. Even if I didn't have the badges it still has Sti product all over. What am I supposed to do, sell the stock stuff the factory charged extra for on the car?   Keep in mind the wheels and the lip kit were not options. They are STOCK on this trim."

Maybe Tein coils but I kinda doubt their basic damping matches the ST.  Bilstein PSS B14 is $1000 and I'd get that before getting fortune auto. But are the bilsteins $400 better than the ST? I'm not so sure."

ft86,37nupr,hype-armor,1 point,Fri May 29 01:01:18 2015 UTC,"I've read a ton of stuff on various forums about flex fuel, yada yada yada, but from my understanding, ethanol is the problem with the high pressure fuel pumps for the direct injection side of the engine, which causes the crickets.  They don't have ethanol added to gas overseas, hence the reason there wasn't a problem with the pumps till they came over here, so adding more ethanol would cause more problems to the fuel pump, would it not? Or is it a different grade of ethanol when you're purposely putting it in, rather than when they're just watering down real gas?"
ft86,37nupr,The_Quaker,2,Fri May 29 01:18:43 2015 UTC,"Don't believe what you read about ethanol causing the crickets.  I had them on 93 octane (with ~10% ethanol) from every station in the area but have zero crickets on E85.  Last time I looked into it, the theory was crickets depended on the extra additives used by different brands of gas.  I switched to E85 specifically to get rid of crickets, after doing the recall failed to fix it.  I have heard of E85 motors having them though, again it may depend on the additives.  To your original question, an Openflash tablet with an E85 map will give you a serious boost to driveability for $500 and about 10 minutes of work."
ft86,37nupr,The_Quaker,3,Fri May 29 02:53:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I've had my pump replaced already and they came back almost immediately, there isn't ethanol free premium in my area so I haven't been able to try that out. I'll have to read up on the flex fuel."
ft86,37nupr,The_Quaker,1 point,Fri May 29 03:00:13 2015 UTC,"my understanding from people who know more than me is running e85 actually clears crickets completely. Why, i'm not sure.

ft86,37nupr,NorcalHPDE,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:29:27 2015 UTC,"I've read some more and it may be the additives that each company uses, not necessarily the ethanol. E85 doesn't have those other additives in it, so that would make sense."

Plus, there are parts of main roads here that flood when it rains, and I'm already nervous about when there are a couple inches of water in the road.  I'm not one to do just lowering springs, so I'd have to do fully adjustable coil overs, then hog the alignment rack and make everything perfect.  Which is fine, but Savannah roads are horrible."
ft86,37nupr,The_Quaker,2,Fri May 29 00:53:26 2015 UTC,"Stick with the stock springs, since I totally agree lowering & bad roads makes for a bad times. I would go with adjuatble dampers.

It's fine, it's bouncy with one bike on it.  I don't think I'd try two.  My bike is a Vassago Jabberwocky that weighs 19 lbs.  The main issue is the overall length (or depth) of the rack.  The further you project out from the tow bar, the more leverage the bike has on the mounting points.  I think I am at the limit, nowhere near the 100lb tongue weight limit for the slambert bar but when you factor in lever arm, its' close.  If I had a smaller and lighter rack, it would be fine and towing a small 4x8 trailer with my shifter kart is no issue."

A lot of people with the engine problems have boosted there cars and the resulting engine failure is due to bad tunes. Additionally reading online is only a small fraction of FRS's on the road

ft86,37d8sn,totally_rocks,2,Wed May 27 00:25:11 2015 UTC,Alot of information on the ft86club forums.  And the stock tune is fine of anything you can run into the same problem with am after market tune of the person tuning it doesn't know what they're doing. Additionally you void your warranty if you flash your car and would have to reflash it to stock If you need to take it in for repairs. But honestly don't worry about the tune unless it's a 2013 in which case it may or may not have the bad tune problem

ft86,37d8sn,randillio,5,Wed May 27 00:43:06 2015 UTC,"The engine failures were due to the direct injection seals failing.  That was caused by (IIRC) transient ignition timing during shifts, which was fixed by a revision of the base tune.  Mainly it was only track guys that were getting their combustion chambers hot enough to melt the Teflon seals on the injectors.  CSG Mike was able to nurse an engine through several track days, before the revised tune, by granny shifting, but I'm not sure if he's still doing it.  To the best of my knowledge the problem of bad seals is all but gone now.  Some of the engines were warrantied, a few though weren't as they were deemed to have been abused on track.  Aside from that the only engine issues I'm aware of are the cricket sounds from the high pressure fuel pump when used with an ethanol blend such as E10, and a few melted cats from track time.  There have been other failures, but most were due to bad tunes for the fuel.    Every cars has growing pains but I'd say you're safe at this point."

The real problem is that apparently by the time the CEL comes on showing a code P0017/P0018 it's too late and the damage is already done..   Obviously putting anything less than 91 octane is going to cause problems but it sounds like it's a little more serious than just the type of fuel being run through it.

It runs like you want it to, it behaves how you want it to, and if you can drive a stick, you kick the crap out of the estimated MPG by the EPA. Says 30 Highway? Pfft. I get almost 40.   But I drive my car differently. I get up to almost 60 in second, shift to sixth, cruise to speed. I rarely use first gear, unless I'm at the front of a stop light. Starting in second is your friend. It's easier for city driving, and you don't ram into the ass-end of a tow-hitch, that way.   It's all in how the car is driven, if you ask me. My wife and I adore this car, can't get enough of it, and use it as an excuse just to go places. We make road-trips all the time with it.   That being said, I don't buy first-generations of any model of any car. I wait for bugs to get worked out, which they seemingly have.

ft86,37cjwh,cerealcable,2,Wed May 27 03:02:24 2015 UTC,No different in the BRZ sadly.
ft86,37cjwh,LittleRadagast,2,Tue May 26 23:59:45 2015 UTC,Are you wearing your watch while the problems are happening?  I have some slight issues with my phone reconnecting with bluetooth speakers if it is already connected to my watch
ft86,37cjwh,CCSubaru,3,Tue May 26 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"You know, I hadn't thought of that, but like I said, my roomy's Ford has no problems, and I'm always wearing my watch.  I may try it today without the watch though, see if that makes a difference."
ft86,37cjwh,jsweeney9349,2,Tue May 26 21:09:41 2015 UTC,This a problem with more than just the twins.. It happened to me in my WRX too and what you have to do is delete the phone and pair it using the voice commands instead of doing it on the head unit.  Worked like a charm in my WRX and in my moms Crosstrek
ft86,37cjwh,KW10,1 point,Wed May 27 19:23:44 2015 UTC,I had the same issue so I reset the BT settings and when i set it back up I didn't allow it to read text messages. It fixed the problem for me but I have a BRZ. I think it's a different unit but worth a shot.
ft86,37cjwh,lookamoose64,1 point,Tue May 26 17:37:42 2015 UTC,"Mine always pairs right away with no problem,  but then is guaranteed to disconnect and reconnect within the first few minutes for no reason at all. After that it is good to go.  Using a nexus 4."
ft86,37cjwh,sumrexnox,1 point,Tue May 26 17:46:53 2015 UTC,"I have a 2015 BRZ and an HTC One M8 using Spotify. Initial pairing is usually fine. If I stall the car, it fails to reconnect. Spotify has to be open and active for autoplay to work (which makes some sense I guess.) My text message readout has only (half) worked once. Phone calls I've never had a problem with though."
ft86,37cjwh,DiabeetusMan,1 point,Tue May 26 18:07:39 2015 UTC,"I have a FRS and a nexus 5.  Initial pairing is always ok, but if i have to turn the car off and on again is when i have a problem.  Sometimes it works fine, sometimes it doesnt. I can usually get it to pair by power cycling the car.  Not enough of a problem to warrant replacing the headunit imho."
ft86,37cjwh,threeeball,1 point,Tue May 26 18:41:50 2015 UTC,"Bluetooth fails for me more often than it works.  Sometimes after starting the car, it'll pair instantly.  Sometimes, it'll pair after like 10 minutes.  Most of the time, nothing happens.  If I turn on my car and then Bluetooth on my phone, it almost never works.  I have a Nexus 5 and a BRZ, for what it's worth."
ft86,37cjwh,Zeighesh,3,Tue May 26 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had the 10 minute delay yesterday as well.  Driving along in silence, and suddenly it connects and blares music at me.  Scared the crap out of me."
ft86,37cjwh,glamfairy,1 point,Tue May 26 19:48:11 2015 UTC,"same with my nexus 4, exactly. My wife's phone (HTC One) works fine, 100% of the time."
ft86,37cjwh,QuickStopRandal,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"I've got a 2014 BRZ and haven't had issues with pairing, but after it worked great for a month or two, it started reading ALL of my text messages for me instead of just the ones that were new.  Happened every time I turned the car on and I'd have an endless stream of message notifications that it had already played for me. Finally found the option to turn off that feature."
ft86,37cjwh,vtbeavens,1 point,Tue May 26 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"I had a huge issue with my FRS stock unit pairing with my Note 3. Same thing - not staying connected & having to unpair to fix it. I was going to replace the unit, but that issue kind of forced me into it quicker than I would have otherwise.   Edit: I've been driving a 2015 Escape (rental) for a couple weeks and Ford Sync is exponentially worse than the stock FRS unit. I have no idea how you can successfully pair with a Focus all the time. I'm constantly yelling at Sync... I miss my car..."
ft86,37cjwh,carma143,1 point,Tue May 26 22:07:08 2015 UTC,"You guys should probably list the phones you have.  I've used it with an iPhone 4S and 6 and it works fine 99% of the time.  The only time I have issues is if I walk out of the car with the engine running and my phone in my pocket and I get out of range.  IIRC, I have to restart the car to get it to connect again.  Lucky for me, though, I rarely get out of my car with it running, so it's a very infrequent problem."
ft86,37cjwh,ibumpbeats,1 point,Tue May 26 22:15:28 2015 UTC,2015 FRS here with Galaxy S6 - only issue I've had is with Pandora not displaying the current track correctly.  But I think that's something with Pandora.
ft86,37cjwh,sideout2,1 point,Wed May 27 01:00:54 2015 UTC,For my Galaxy S4 it turned out that SHAZAM was causing all the trouble I had.  Installed SoundHound instead and connects like a charm :)

ft86,37dx53,eecsasdf,4,Tue May 26 22:37:02 2015 UTC,Add more pressure in the front or you are overdriving and scrubbing out.
ft86,37dx53,The_Quaker,1 point,Tue May 26 22:48:32 2015 UTC,"From my experience autocrossing you want that small overlap, shows you're getting the max rubber contact with the right pressures for the day.

ft86,37bm8o,TheStraightPipes,2,Tue May 26 12:51:15 2015 UTC,"This is fucking harmonious. Also i'm guessing ""open""/""closed"" is referring to a physical change in the exhaust system to account for the different acoustics? I had no idea this was a thing, can you explain it more?"

ft86,379qxm,The_Quaker,3,Tue May 26 16:32:21 2015 UTC,I can't believe that's not totaled. Did you get an estimate on repairs yet? It's going to be a lot.
ft86,379qxm,metarugia,5,Wed May 27 04:36:51 2015 UTC,man... did it get totaled out??
ft86,379qxm,zorro1589,3,Tue May 26 02:43:05 2015 UTC,"Even though there is frame damage, they decided not to total it out because it's too new.  I just hope that it's not one of those cars that gets fixed that's ""never the same"" especially since I'll be driving it hard at the track and also at the dragstrip."
ft86,379qxm,spicyricecake,6,Tue May 26 13:12:44 2015 UTC,Go back and argue with the insurance company to total it. Frame damage means never the same.
ft86,379qxm,mackdaddytran,4,Wed May 27 00:09:47 2015 UTC,"They didn't total it out because it is too new? I thought insurance providers had a policy where if the car is in fact this new they do total it.   If they don't take care of you be sure to ask for a loss of value check (not sure what the actual term is). Basically, this car will NEVER be the same and has lost a great ton of value because of this incident. Repaired or not the value is gone (sorry OP, I'm just pouring salt onto your wounds)."
ft86,379qxm,lovsicfrs,4,Tue May 26 13:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah you should tell them Fuck that, it's got frame damage and greatly diminished value I would not want that thing after repairs it's probably gunna have some sort of problem down the road"

ft86,379qxm,MrdrBrgr,3,Tue Jun 2 23:44:00 2015 UTC,"sucks man, sorry to hear and hope that you are okay. btw, which cam were you using for the rear? and was it hardwired or?"
ft86,379qxm,KrispV9,3,Tue May 26 16:58:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it was the WickedHD G1W 1080p dash cam.  It runs off a normal 12v car outlet, so if it is plugged in and the ignition is on, it will be recording.  They're pretty cheap, you can get one on amazon for about $70 and the quality is actually really good.  This particular vid I had a lot of pollen on the back window which made it a bit hazy."
ft86,379qxm,KrispV9,2,Tue May 26 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"How is the wiring for that?  I have 0 electrical skill but think I want to get cams for front and rear after the nightmares I have been seeing thanks to the internet.  I like the idea of a no fuss, dont touch it unless you need to footage type setup with no visible wiring but am nervous I'd have to pay a bit to have someone do it for me."
ft86,379qxm,Kirillb85,2,Tue May 26 17:29:27 2015 UTC,"The cords that come with the dash cam are pretty long, I would say close to 10 ft.  It's super easy to hide the wires, you just go along the trim in your car or under the carpet and it plugs into your cigarette lighter / 12v outlet."
ft86,379qxm,tacomafrs,2,Tue May 26 17:51:17 2015 UTC,What is your setup? Do you have two of these in your car? One for front and one for back?
ft86,379qxm,korbor,2,Tue Jun 2 19:16:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, I have one in the front, one in the rear.  Some dashcams can do both front and rear from the same unit.  I opted for two cams instead."

ft86,378411,Jigamanjoe,2,Mon May 25 17:32:15 2015 UTC,"Full blown motorsports has a stage 1 cam but like /u/Larry_Guy said, the cost to performance ratio on cams for our engine is pretty high. The money is better spent on other power adders."
ft86,378411,sevs753,2,Mon May 25 22:53:08 2015 UTC,With being able to adjust the cam timing so much on this car via a tune I think a lot of power can be made without aftermarket cams.  Now if you want to build a high rpm motor you may need them.
ft86,378411,93sr20det,1 point,Tue May 26 16:35:06 2015 UTC,"Because of the flat motor and valve lash adjustment, from a cost benefit standpoint it makes sense to do something else to add power before doing the cams.  I'd say intake and exhaust would be a lot better from a cost standpoint.  If you need more power, you should just get a turbo or a SC.    Also, the demand isn't there, at least at the moment."
ft86,378411,Larry_Guy,1 point,Mon May 25 21:24:54 2015 UTC,Yeah they are pretty pricy I was just seeing if anyone had any experience with them cause I love the sound of a cammed engine

I was generally attempting to stay below double the 25 MPH posted speed limit. That's why you'll hear me short shift into 3 and then back off; my radar detector had gone off with legit Ka band warnings a few times before I got into the gap at the start of the video. OMG this is the most fun I've ever had with a car below 60 MPH. I can see why this is a popular biker route, but I also feel you'd need to be a pretty competent biker to ride itTough road for a motorcycle.   EDIT:  My favorite thing in this video is probably the set of skid marks going straight off the road at around 1:56."

With the OFT you can buy it, set it up. Upload a off the shelf tune and you will see some performance gain over stock. How you go from there is up to what you buy or your goals for the car."

I blew a motor years ago because I didn't listen to others and didn't do my thorough research. I don't want others to make the same mistake (like the guy from a few days ago that installed a Stage 2 tune on his stock car and didn't know what naturally aspirated meant). Many of these owners are first-time buyers and/or modders; they need to have a clear understanding of the consequences of not doing their due diligence when starting to mod their car. From what I've seen, many can't afford repairs of thousands of dollars due to stupidity/ignorance (like me years ago...)."

They run them from the factory already.  The one caveat would be that it might be good to go easy on the drive train until the clutch and transmission break in a bit.
ft86,3704np,topazsparrow,1 point,Sun May 24 02:24:30 2015 UTC,"I treated the rev limit more like a guide line.

I recently went to a HPDE and I find that the way my brain translated what's on screen to a ""map"" of the track is just soooo different to what I experienced for real. In the real world there's just so much detail thrown at you all the time, and the physical feedback is different to a sim wheel setup.  I found the sim prepared me for the theory (I instinctively recovered correctly from understeer at high speeds without panicking) but the reality of the situation really takes some getting used to.  Were your experiences the same when going to the track?"

ft86,36wgep,blizzzbrz,1 point,Sat May 23 01:10:15 2015 UTC,I would imagine on a stock car it would probably be a bit more sluggish for sure.  The wheels I put on with the tires were considerably heavier than the stock ones.  I'm turbo though so I needed all the traction I could get.

ft86,36up5a,93sr20det,2,Fri May 22 19:28:02 2015 UTC,HKS or Greddy stroker kit will get you the bottom end.  Or you can get a already built short block from someone like Crawford performance.   For supercharging you will want to lower the compression some but until you install the SC the cars performance will suffer with lower compression.

And with extra stuff now stock like rearview camera and touch screen head unit stock.  Not trying to make you feel bad, just wondering if you had a reason.  I've been trying to be strong and hold out for over a month now.  P.S. I've spent the last literally 3 weeks researching these cars and the aftermarket stuff I'm going to get. I even have an Excel sheet on what I'm going to get. That said, I can tell you anyone with an FRS/BRZ/86 is in the club."
ft86,36rgm8,scorpionMaster,1 point,Fri May 22 01:09:13 2015 UTC,"Combination of impatience and necessity, honestly.  I thought about waiting.  My WRX wasn't gonna pass smog, and tags expire at the end of this month.  I could have paid the fees and driven it around for a while longer with an extension, but it had been running questionably for a while anyway so I just said fuck it and pulled the trigger.  Rather get the new car now and not have to worry than risk my WRX stranding me somewhere.  BTW, mine came with the touchscreen head unit and I didn't pay anything extra, no option was even presented to me.  I think it's stock for 2015 as well.  Backup camera, meh, I've been backing up cars for 15 years or so now, never had a camera before.  If you can wait though, it's the smart move, I don't disagree."
ft86,36rgm8,SpicyCurryJaja,1 point,Fri May 22 02:29:26 2015 UTC,I'm not sure about OP but I just signed for mine the other day. 0.79% interest likely won't apply to the 2016 model until the same time next year. The touchscreen is standard on 2015 models. It sounds like they're only adding the backup camera but I'm likely going to try doing that myself.

ft86,36rm48,Jjny88,2,Thu May 21 15:56:35 2015 UTC,Yes the FRS and rear Scion logo are just held on with 3m adhesive.  I took some goo gone and a old credit card to peel it away.  The front is similar but there is two holder pins on the badge.  Same thing here.. dab with the goo gone and then wedge your card or scraper behind and kind of cut away the adhesive. The two holder pins are at the 3 o' clock position and the 9 o clock position. Once you have the adhesive loose around just geta grip and pull straight out towards your chest. May require a bit of force.  It helps alot if you have a heat gun to loosen the adhesive.

It's actually easier than the front and rear ovals, since there are no connector pins to worry about, only adhesive. Just have scratch remover, goo-gone and some wax ready afterward.  Edit: Re-read your post, if you are in fact talking about removing the front and rear ovals, ft86SF has a video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4Q0C6j3gxQ"

ft86,36scbh,sirtonedef,3,Thu May 21 18:58:57 2015 UTC,I've got a 65lb Malinois that loves poking her head between my seat and the b-pillar so that she can get to the window. Get a nice dog blanket for the back seat and it works quite well. Constantly adjusting the seats back to a comfortable position is a little annoying but a small sacrifice for a furry buddy.
ft86,36scbh,Spartikus11,3,Thu May 21 19:41:07 2015 UTC,"We carry 3 Jack Russells around in ours (FRS and BRZ) and it works perfect for us...we just spread their 3 beds out, they are cozy and don't fly around when we're slinging turns. ;)  I would think a big dog would be well off since it won't slide around much, just put a couple of pillows down in the bucket seats to level out the space back there, then a big doggie bed on top of that."

ft86,36scbh,The_Quaker,2,Fri May 22 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"When I first looked at the BRZ on the lot the first thing I did was fold down the back seat to see if there was enough space for my German Shepherd.   She's smaller (65 lbs) and it was a bit awkward getting here in and out but it worked. The biggest issue is with the seat down there's nothing for her to brace against in front or back.   I have a CrossTrek now for the dogs (added one!) but the BRZ managed with the one.   But the hair.... Oh, so much time spent with a lint roller removing dog hair from the seats, carpet, trim, ceiling...."
ft86,36scbh,SOB-17,2,Thu May 21 22:16:35 2015 UTC,"I have a 63 lb boxer and a 30lb whippet.  Bought  the rear seat delete kit from shrader,  added a nice squishy blanket on top,  and they are good to go.  Way better than the back seat folded down, or a cover over the seats.  Highly recommend this method if you anticipate having the dogs in the car frequently.  The guy from shrader will tell you that the plastic isn't really made to hold weight, and he is correct.  But I decided to risk it and haven't had any issues in several months.  If I wasn't lazy I would have built my own out of 3/8 plywood,  or reinforced my current kit with some wood.  Just haven't had the need to do it."

Even if you replace a catted part with another catted part, it's going to fail the visual inspection and they won't even put it on the sniffer.  Now, as /u/bsarocker mentions, you have 6 years after purchasing a new car before you need to smog it. And if it's not completely catless making it smelly and loud, you're not going to get bothered about it unless your car is modded to the point where it's attracting the wrong kind of attention."

In other areas of paddock I explored, the Texas guys have ""BigWheel ProSolo"" going on, which is exactly what it sounds like.... drunk people riding bigwheels around cones they've set up.

The Canada tent has a HUGE beer swap.... just coolers and coolers and coolers full of beer.  Take something you want, leave something in return.  And someone brought ""big beer pong"".... giant Rubbermaid trash cans painted red with a while lip like Solo Cups and then played beer pong with a volleyball. Oh and I think it's ETR that fills up a kiddie pool and tows it around paddock throughout the week.

I use K&N for oil filter too.   For oil I tried a few different brands but now I use Eneos.  Engine seems to perform the best and mostly quiet on this oil.

ft86,36klm3,hotboxpizza,5,Wed May 20 01:55:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think you did anything ""wrong"", if that's any consolation.  From my understanding, there are just some cars with engines that fail, and although most don't, there's no real way of knowing if you have one.  It doesn't seem to matter if you mod it or not, and in fact an alarming number of untouched stock engines seem to be failing.  I'm also of the understanding that the stock tune is actually pretty dangerous for the longevity of the engine, and you're better off getting it tuned for both performance and reliability reasons.  The stock tune apparently has very aggressive timing and lean conditions to maximize fuel economy numbers during testing."
ft86,36klm3,killboydotcom,3,Wed May 20 03:47:33 2015 UTC,"NO engine should have such a catastrophic failure after not even 40k miles! I don't know what year your car is, but the oldest it can be is three years old, if it's a 2012 model. That kind of failure in such a new car is worrying, and not a very good sign..    I have not bought one yet, but I am in this sub because I am seriously thinking of getting one. But reading about this, makes me think twice. This should not happen, as often as it is happening."
ft86,36klm3,sqd,4,Wed May 20 07:18:56 2015 UTC,It's happening often?

Googling engine failures, it has happened more than just a couple of times. And considering it's not the most sold car around, I feel uneasy about it.   Also, take this list as an example:  http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15577 As you can see, there are a few on that list that have had catastrophic engine failures. And that is just people who are a member of the forum, have found that thread and added themselves to it, so not exactly every owner out there.."
ft86,36klm3,sqd,2,Wed May 20 08:53:08 2015 UTC,"From my understanding,  there's two major unpinnings on this engine.  The first is an oiling issue involving the crank shaft.  The journals for cylinders 2&3 have inadequate oiling at times and lead to bearing failure and a dead bottom end.  The other, and what I think happened to OP, is that there's a serious QC issue with the rocker arms on the valve train that leads to catastrophic failure.  I've seen this happen in both stock and modified cars.  From what I've been told the retaining pin on the rocker arm backs out and the rocker arm does a nice dance on the inside of the head."
ft86,36klm3,Scudzey,3,Wed May 20 11:45:27 2015 UTC,"You might very well be completely correct, I haven't dug deeper to find out what's wrong, but those things you mention are major issues in my eyes. Where I live, a used 2012/13 model with 15 to 20k miles on it, is the equivalent to 24k USD. If i'm shelling out 24k on an almost new car, I wouldn't in my wildest dream expect a catastrophic engine failure.. I'm just saying this shouldn't happen, on a tried and tested engine design, in the 2010's.    I still want one, but now over-worrying I might get a lemon."

ft86,36ddgk,pembeh,2,Mon May 18 14:19:59 2015 UTC,Thanks man appreciate the insight.
ft86,36ddgk,Zugunfall,2,Mon May 18 14:39:00 2015 UTC,"Cats are expensive, so to have one custom made would probably be ridiculously expensive.   Any exhaust option that is catback is not going to have much effect on performance, just the sounds it makes, and the look of the exhaust tips.   Performance upgrades are going to come with different headers, downpipes, and a proper tune to match them.   And, as mentioned above, cat deletes will give some better flow, there's 2 in this car (headers and midpipe). So then also depending on the emissions standards where you live watch out for that."

ft86,36c0tn,93sr20det,1 point,Mon May 18 04:08:38 2015 UTC,Don't know for certain if it's true but a friend of mine told me to never pull the brake up all the way because you can wear it pretty quickly . I've always done this and put my car into first or reverse depending on the landscape when I park.
ft86,36c0tn,ejay3d,1 point,Mon May 18 07:21:32 2015 UTC,I've been yanking them for 20 years and never had a problem with accelerated wear.
ft86,36c0tn,LordTaikun,1 point,Mon May 18 12:32:54 2015 UTC,I think what your friend was probably talking about is those people who pull the ebrake up excessively far.. all this could do is stretch your ebrake cable causing it to be less effective.. its not really a huge deal either way :)
ft86,36c0tn,Sufficial,1 point,Mon May 18 17:46:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah i used to do that until my gf pointed out that im stretching the fabric on it. Now i just go like 2 or 3 clicks lower than its max, or just a little above half if its on a flat landscape. No need to yank the ebrake so high really."

I'm not really at the point where I want to daily drive a heavily modded car, so even getting my BRZ up to 300hp is essentially out of the question for me. Just too much money and maintenance on a two-year-old car. Hell, I have a warranty for another 50k miles.  With a wife and a dog, plus friends/coworkers that typically ride with me, the WRX is just more practical, while happening to also be faster (stock)."
ft86,36asmn,PANDAmonium515,2,Mon May 18 14:44:22 2015 UTC,Not sure what other guy said since he deleted it but basically I didn't utilize the WRX power and was tired of dealing with mechnical issues on a ~2 year old car

Also we know the base models there are two more colors for Scion for instance, some leather/alacantara options which can be seen on the Japanese site.    However there is no mention about anything similar to the Scion Release Series 1.0 or Blue.Series from Subaru (made only ~1000 of them and truly a limited version)."

ft86,3678sp,HotCrockets,10,Sat May 16 21:45:13 2015 UTC,Any car should have the parking brake on while parked.
ft86,3678sp,aemsk,0,Sat May 16 23:39:09 2015 UTC,I was always told to leave the car in gear. Leaving the handbrake on (especially after a hard drive) can cause the pads to warp the disks.

ft86,3678sp,johnnybags,2,Sat May 16 21:18:45 2015 UTC,Nope not stock. I ordered the parts from ft86 speed factory. They are actual Toyota/Subaru parts from overseas. I guess it's how they come in Australia.

ft86,3678sp,noviceastronomer,1 point,Sat May 16 21:41:53 2015 UTC,Nope just solid black plastic. no branding at all.

ft86,3678sp,NorcalHPDE,1 point,Sun May 17 18:38:18 2015 UTC,No. All of the parts are OEM Toyota parts. The only thing I painted was the shift knob. It was a Perrin knob.

ft86,369hte,EnjoyingMyCoffee,2,Sun May 17 14:14:23 2015 UTC,"Might sound silly, but have you checked your air filters? The cabin air filter is located (I think) under/behind the glovebox. It's part of the 30K maintenance, so I bought one but have yet to replace it and I'm nearing 40K.  Otherwise, maybe look into the A/C compressor? I'm not certain where it's located on this car, or the design. But one design I'm familiar with on Hondas has the compressor belt/wheel spinning at all times, regardless of if the A/C is on or off. Turning on the A/C only engaged a magnet which then drove the compressor.  Hopefully this spurs some useful research, the buzzing nature sounds more like something loose rather than spinning"

ft86,362qc7,Accerbus,7,Fri May 15 16:31:49 2015 UTC,I had to purchase extra coverage from the dealership for rims when I bought mine.
ft86,362qc7,tgagz,5,Fri May 15 17:53:16 2015 UTC,How are your rims defective?
ft86,362qc7,ftlofsm,4,Fri May 15 17:28:02 2015 UTC,you do indeed have to buy the wheel and tire protection plan. depends on if you have a brz or a frs. the wheel and tire protection plan is usually written on the back of the packet that the financial office gave you when you paid for the car. its on the page that has the insurance stuff. for the brz's it actually protects aftermarket wheel and tires too as long as they're the exact same size i believe! not too bad imo.

ft86,3600lx,IAmAtomato,2,Fri May 15 18:02:27 2015 UTC,"I only had a tune when I was NA and first switched to e85. I redid my tune with larger port injectors when I installed my JRSC. The direct injection is completely stock, which is where the crickets come from. It could be completely coincidental that my crickets started after I switched to e85, as the car only had 6,000 miles at the time."

ft86,3600lx,Longwaytofall,3,Fri May 15 11:35:21 2015 UTC,"Mine's never gone away :(  91 octane is the highest level fuel here so I'm guessing that has something to do with it. We're at nearly 6000' so 93 is definitely not necessary for knock, but it sure would be nice to shut up the crickets."
ft86,3600lx,SmokinBuffalo,3,Thu May 14 23:47:11 2015 UTC,"I have crickets with 92 octane. The only thing that has shut them up is ethanol free gas, but it is hard to find."

ft86,3600lx,brybot9000,4,Thu May 14 23:59:20 2015 UTC,You sweet summer child.
ft86,3600lx,gtslow,4,Fri May 15 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"The ethanol in American has causes them.  Will probably go away with Ethanol free gas, but the ethanol is more knock resistant so you could tune more aggressively with it.   That being said you should also get better gas mileage on pure gas."
ft86,3600lx,RayBrower,5,Fri May 15 01:48:11 2015 UTC,Ahh. I see. I only buy ethanol-free gas. Usually 93 octane. I drive like an asshat and get about 34 mpg.
ft86,3600lx,LittleRadagast,6,Fri May 15 01:53:50 2015 UTC,34?? I get 24 best
ft86,3600lx,QuickStopRandal,4,Fri May 15 05:33:31 2015 UTC,"You must do nothing but drive in hardcore downtown.  I rarely get below ~28 mpg in mixed driving and usually more like 31-32.  Also, could be an automatic as they get better MPG for some reason."
ft86,3600lx,tgagz,2,Fri May 15 15:40:40 2015 UTC,I average around 28-35 with my automatic. My commuting is usually 50/50 highway and city.

ft86,3600lx,Kev69420,3,Fri May 15 10:38:58 2015 UTC,Mine went away with that vpower stuff at Shell. Costs a bit more than other gas stations' premium but I don't mind as long as the crickets stay away.
ft86,3600lx,Kev69420,2,Fri May 15 21:27:12 2015 UTC,Is this available at all or just some? I can't find anything other than 91 in socal
ft86,3600lx,Kirillb85,2,Fri May 15 23:53:29 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's only at some Shells. The one a few minutes away from my house has 93 vpower which is pretty nice
ft86,3600lx,Brobafett93,2,Fri May 15 23:55:50 2015 UTC,I live in Jersey. 93 is everywhere and that is what I get. Still get chirping all the time.   I'm skeptical about the claims in here.
ft86,3600lx,smg1138,2,Sat May 16 00:50:10 2015 UTC,Same with me but from Houston. Not the first time I've heard claims of switching brands makes the crickets go away. Going to try shell.

ft86,35zxrl,marguello94,17,Thu May 14 22:39:56 2015 UTC,"Shift based on power, not rpm. If you are putting around town at slow speeds, shift sooner. If you are accelerating quickly, shift later. Most of the power comes between 4k and 7k, so you'll learn to keep the motor in that range when driving spiritedly. Only reason to shift earlier is to keep the noise and fuel consumption down."

ft86,35zxrl,cywinr,8,Fri May 15 10:40:22 2015 UTC,The RPM you shift at is relative to your speed and which gear you are going into. There is no proper range. Tbh it doesn't really matter. Drive it more and you will learn to shift smoothly.
ft86,35zxrl,MexicanBro,2,Thu May 14 23:09:40 2015 UTC,First to second I stay right around the range you mentioned. Other than that I usually shift at 3500. Would like to know how others do it ad well.
ft86,35zxrl,leeban,2,Thu May 14 22:57:50 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat, just got the car, first manual transmission. I set my dash display to show what gear I'm in and when to shift, once you do this this little up arrow shows you when to shift based on how to get the most mpg, I also set my shift light at 6500 rpm's... I've never revved that high so I've not seen it, cause I'm still learning/ driving like a grandma. It's more fun with higher revves, I'm sure I'll get more comfortable as I drive it more.   TL;DR set the dash to show you when to shift for the best mpg, add revves for more fun."

ft86,35zxrl,lovsicfrs,2,Fri May 15 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for fuel economy, use the gear shift indicator. You'll be in 6th gear by like 65 km/h, upshifting each gear around 2k rpm. The exception is first gear where I usually upshift around 3k rpm. If you want to accelerate quickly rev the gears out a little (or a lot!) more."
ft86,35zxrl,abductee92,2,Fri May 15 00:31:01 2015 UTC,"While you are learning a good feature to use is the shift indicator. You can set that red light to pop up and beep when you hit a certain RPM.  I agree 100% with /u/5thfreedom on shifting based on power, but if you want some extra assurance use the shift indicator and set it at 3k-4k RPM range. That way you know you've shifted proper for cruising around town at low speeds or you are getting into that power range for sprinted driving."
ft86,35zxrl,LordTaikun,1 point,Fri May 15 14:50:53 2015 UTC,Usually around 3k but obviously higher when accelerating/passing/etc.
ft86,35zxrl,seifer666,1 point,Thu May 14 23:19:31 2015 UTC,"Like others have said.. usually around 3K RPM I guess.. I dont really look at the tach a whole lot.. after driving a manual for so long you kinda just feel it rather than look for a number to shift at.   Just dont red line it every time you shift and youll be fine.. There is no ""Right"" answer when it comes to this."

ft86,35zxrl,Shiftgood,0,Sat May 16 03:10:52 2015 UTC,Casual driving in commuting traffic I shift 2 and upwards at 3k. Lower than 3k bogs the engine.
ft86,35yk6y,idiotbox1,18,Thu May 14 16:16:54 2015 UTC,"its from hard water, you can use a clay bar and take them off. autozone has clay bar with spray detailer for like 18 bucks. its because the water dried while on the car instead of being wiped/blown off. but if you use a clay bar, put some wax on afterwards"

ft86,35wq3h,QuickStopRandal,9,Thu May 14 14:22:21 2015 UTC,"C's also make degrees. If you fail yo break in the engine properly you get burnt piston rings which lead to premature oil burning. I turned down buying my BRZ from a dealer when he told me to ""beat the snot out of it"" and that ""it burns oil like a rotary"".   Follow the break in process so you don't damage your engine. Some cars do come from the factory ready to go, I've seen too many BRZs burning oil before 5,000 miles to believe its ready from day 1 to drive hard."
ft86,35wq3h,The_Quaker,2,Thu May 14 19:43:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not suggesting you go drag racing up and down the highway, but an occasional blip over 4k when you really need to is not going to hurt it.  The key is not doing 100+mph pulls and shit like that where you're sustaining those revvs for a long period of time.  Revving up to 5 or 6k in 1st and 2nd when you have to accelerate quickly into traffic is not going to hurt it if done sparingly."
ft86,35wq3h,QuickStopRandal,2,Thu May 14 22:07:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on this. If you have to floor it to save your life, the oops I hit 4k isn't going to cause problems. Even during my break in, I hit ice and my rpms hit 5k for a moment. Not the end of the world.  More the issue is with you get the car and every red to green light you do a 0 to 60 test, run an autocross, go find the top speed on a highway, or even seen someone show up to a track day at Watkins with less then 500 miles and they put their car into a barrier."
ft86,35wq3h,The_Quaker,2,Fri May 15 02:22:28 2015 UTC,You guys actually drive in VCS Sport around town? Anyone want to explain to me what it actually does?  I assume it's form of traction control.
ft86,35wq3h,Kirillb85,3,Sat May 16 03:25:59 2015 UTC,"Traction control eliminates wheel spin by reducing throttle input and applying the brakes the the wheel(s) that are spinning. Sport mode removes the throttle cut out, still applies the brakes to a spinning wheel. This lets you have a little more fun, but keeps you in check.  Holding the 'off' button will turn off both of these assists. This allows for wheel spin. The important thing to remember is that these cars come with a Torsion LSD. A LSD works by transferring an exponential amount of power to whichever wheel has more traction.  Quick bonus: If you have a car with an open differential, power goes to whichever wheel has less traction (the wheel that is easiest to move). Think of it like running water looking for the path of least resistance.   I always drive in full 'off' mode so that I don't have brakes slowing me down/ telling me how to drive. I also don't like losing throttle response when gunning it around a corner, these cars steer very well with the rear wheels."

ft86,35w1ng,smartedpanda,5,Thu May 14 06:31:29 2015 UTC,Making the dash shine creates glare off the windshield.  That's why it has that finish like you've never seen...it's intentionally low sheen for better performance. (polarized sunglasses help a ton here as well)  Look for products that are specifically low-shine.  I use some stuff called BugSlide for detailing the whole car that have a UV protectant but doesn't leave a shine...hard to find though.  It's more of a motorcycle/bike shop product.

ft86,35vnuc,scalablecory,3,Thu May 14 01:22:59 2015 UTC,Its the warm up cycle. When the engine is at operating temperature its quiet. Not much you can do unfortunately. Most enthusiast cars all do this. Its really not that bad for most of the population.   The inside of the car can be helped. Removing or plugging the sound tube helps a lot. Its a barebones car (not touring) so itll be loud like a cheap econobox. You can install 200lbs of dampening stuff that makes it go down 10 db or 90%.

ft86,35rkfc,CrazyMike366,8,Wed May 13 00:28:21 2015 UTC,This.  ammunition for the next car talk with the homies!
ft86,35rkfc,QuickStopRandal,10,Wed May 13 00:34:06 2015 UTC,"That's great it does so well on a tight, technical course like Tsukuba, but it really shows its lack of power on big American tracks with long straights. Its no surprise that the North American market seems to be where most of the belly-aching about power is coming from.  By comparison, here's how poorly it stacks up against the other entry level sports cars at Virginia International.    Rank Car Time km/h Year hp/kg    88 Mustang V6 3:12.50 126 '11 309 / 15714   95 Genesis 3.8 3:13.80 126 '09 310 / 1575   114 BRZ 3:18:60 123 '12 200 / 1220    http://fastestlaps.com/tracks/virginia_international_raceway.html  Note that the BMW X5-M SUV also beats the twins quite handily, and the Camaro SS 1LE so proudly bested at Tsukuba is an absolutely shocking 20.3 seconds faster at VIR."
ft86,35rkfc,CrazyMike366,-1,Wed May 13 02:29:24 2015 UTC,"But, frankly, who gives a shit?  Tracks with long straights and simple ""turn around"" corners are boring and don't require significant skill to drive.  I'd much prefer to win in a twisting track that always has you balancing gas, brake, steering, and shift points.  Also, to be fair, who was driving?  Even at an indoor karting track with laps only 25-35 seconds long, you can see a variance of 5 or more seconds from a modestly competent driver (i.e. someone with some interest in racing and years of driving for commuting) to a pro-level driver.  Multiply that by the lap times of these circuits, and that's a lot of seconds!  Bottom line, it's not fair to use times that might be pulled by some high school kid that's only been driving for 6 months with zero race experience and then other numbers from a race instructor at the school in his prepped car with DOT slicks.  This is why, and I've pitched this before, that some tire company needs to start a website where they put all of the cars on the exact same tire model and either the stock tire size or the largest that will fit without rubbing and run them head to head.  Some cars come from the factory with hot glue on a rim while others, like the BRZ/FR-S, come with a sheet of delrin wrapped around the rim.  Then, have the same driver drive all of them on the same track that he knows well enough that he's not going to ""learn the track"" as he goes on.  All of these magazine tests with mediocre drivers prove nothing other than a hack driver was able to drive faster in certain cars than others, usually because the driving is done for them.  A BRZ/FR-S requires a skilled driver to maintain momentum and balance it through the corners, it's just just a brute force approach like a Camaro where you get it straight as fast as you can and just wail on the throttle."
ft86,35rkfc,QuickStopRandal,2,Wed May 13 21:35:01 2015 UTC,"It's just how point/counter-point works. Don't take it so personally. OP asked why people bitch about this car being underpowered yet we put the Miata on a pedestal, I saw an answer I felt was misleading, and I provided context to illustrate such.  Why the Miata/86 disparity? The simple answer is that the Miata doesn't have much competition and Mazda does well to meet the needs of the consumers that buy it; the GT86 has quite a lot of competition that beats it badly in some categories important to the segment and Toyota/Subaru hasn't done much to address the complaints of would-be buyers in the segment, chief among them being not enough power for the cost as is and a lack of a trim level with more power at a higher cost."
ft86,35rkfc,CrazyMike366,2,Wed May 13 22:05:59 2015 UTC,I think it simply comes down to the fact that people were expecting a Supra and got a [Nissan] Silvia.
ft86,35rkfc,QuickStopRandal,2,Wed May 13 22:11:26 2015 UTC,"I think that's fair. But I also think a much more apt comparison is that we expected this car to be heir apparent to what the Integra did for sport compacts in the 90's, but we're still waiting for our GSR and Type-R.   Or the Impreza and the WRX/STi for the Subaru version. Or the Celica and Celica GT-S with the 2ZZ or AE86/Corolla and the Corolla GT-S with a 4AG if you want to keep it to Toyotas. Etc."
ft86,35rkfc,CrazyMike366,-1,Wed May 13 22:46:34 2015 UTC,"Except the BRS/FR-S is already better than all of those cars you listed. Subaru Silvia or Toyota RWD Type R, it's all the same basic stuff."
ft86,35rkfc,QuickStopRandal,2,Wed May 13 23:50:59 2015 UTC,"It's not a direct performance comparison I'm trying to make. It's about the relative step up from the base model to a higher performance trim that doesn't exist for the 86 right now.  I think just about everyone who wants the base model 86 has bought one. Now it's time to step up to reach out to the next set of would be consumers. Offer a track package and call it the GTS86:  GTS86: Michelin Pilot Supersports, Blistein dampers, more camber/caster, bigger brakes, BBS wheels, stiffer rear subframe, bigger oil cooler, +15% power from revised intake/exhaust tuning. Optional Aero kit: Series.blue air dam, new rear wing, diffuser. Optional seating package: Recaro buckets. Optional weight reduction: rear seat delete, HVAC delete, crank windows.  Every major complaint addressed. Journos rant and rave. A second wave of buyers comes forward. The GTS86 becomes a performance icon of the decade."
ft86,35rkfc,ARMORED_TAINT,2,Thu May 14 01:33:19 2015 UTC,"They already made something with most of those things: http://en.responsejp.com/article/img/2012/10/26/183836/395419.html  It's Japan-only, though.  Still, though, the general public would not go for much of that.  No HVAC? Are you high?  These are all mods that would be easy (and probably cheaper) to just do yourself after the fact than pay for a pricey factory version.  Even if you could buy all of this, it would cost something stupid like $35,000 and everyone would whine about the price.  That's why there's no turbo version, because they'd have to charge like $40,000 for it due to low sales volume and everyone would say ""I'm not paying $40k for a $25k car!"".  The only problem with the FR-S is that most of the people on car forums are drag ricers that have no clue what driving on a real track is like and what makes a car good at a track."
ft86,35rkfc,Guyon,3,Thu May 14 14:00:04 2015 UTC,2010 Mustang GT is 318hp while 2011+ mustang GT is 412hp. It'd be more appropriate to compare those numbers. And then 2015+ mustangs have IRS making handling a bit better as well.

ft86,35rkfc,CrazyMike366,8,Wed May 13 00:58:40 2015 UTC,It's also just an /r/cars circle jerk.
ft86,35rkfc,totally_rocks,2,Wed May 13 02:39:19 2015 UTC,"In base form the Miata is a fun car that fills the entry-level roadster niche adored by both budget-enthusiasts and hairdressers alike. The FRS fits this mold with its tail-happy antics, good looks, and relatively low price point.  But where they differ is in the options. If you want to, you can option up the Miata with a great looking interior to make it a budget grand tourer. Or stickier tires, bigger brakes, and a stiffer Blistein-sourced suspension on the clubsport. In the past they've even turbo'd it and slapped a Mazdaspeed badge on it to chase down sports cars that cost twice as much.  They even offered a special order stripped down, lighter version of the base model built just to dominate showroom stock club racing.  With the FRS you don't get the option to be something more just yet. And it might never come. Theyve teased the BRZ TS, the track-ready Type-RA, a facelift that recalls iconic 60's GT styling, and countless STi and Gazoo one-offs. But never for public consumption in their biggest market.  And that's why the FRS is a joke in some circles but the Miata has cred. And that's from someone who fully intends to own an FRS sooner or later. I keep putting it off because they tease all this awesome shit they never follow through on. At least Mazda follows through."

Edit: so google has different numbers from what Wikipedia lists as the curb weight for the 2015 Miata. So now I'm not sure. . . And Car and Driver reports 2,332 for the new Miata.

ft86,35rkfc,randillio,6,Thu May 14 01:37:38 2015 UTC,"Part of it is miatas have a history of track credit of beating much more expensive and powerful, or at least giving them a challenge.

ft86,35rkfc,fingerthief,-1,Thu May 14 01:39:15 2015 UTC,"Might wanna recheck that bud. Last years model was 5.7, this year's model is 6.3, with the FRS at 6.2. You can quibble a half a second here and there, but we're pretty well in line these days. Doesn't help that the Focus tends to fight some pretty huge wheel hop."
ft86,35rkfc,QuickStopRandal,2,Wed May 13 00:46:16 2015 UTC,This is the problem with 0-60 numbers.  Sure if you are a professional driver dropping the clutch at 5500rpm you might pull off a 6.5 if you are lucky.  Look at the 5-60 number and you are looking at 7.9s on the FRS.
ft86,35rkfc,fingerthief,0,Wed May 13 02:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but who does that?  At a racetrack, you're always going to be rolling already.  Even the tightest of circuits will rarely drop you below 30 mph.  The ST sucks once you factor in the weight of that fatass and the fact that it's pathetic front wheel drive.  The only reason it ever beats the FR-S/BRZ is because of tires.  I really wish Scion/Toyota/Subaru would offer a ""performance tire package"" just so they would test the car fairly."
ft86,35rkfc,fingerthief,2,Wed May 13 03:55:35 2015 UTC,"I hate to say this, but holy shit do you sound like an FR-S fanboy.   Saying another car sucks especially the ST, a car that has gotten praised on how balanced and awesome it is on the track just makes it sound like you have no idea what you're talking about.   Will the FRS corner better? absolutely. That being said from reading what you say about the ST I'd take a guess and say you've never actually driven one."
ft86,35rkfc,QuickStopRandal,1 point,Wed May 13 16:51:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not really into minivans, so no.  I won't support anything front wheel driving claiming to be a sports vehicle, I'm sick of that cop out.  The FR-S is what I was waiting for for 15 years after they discontinued the 240sx, then they finally made it, then I bought it.  If the Focus ST was a RWD sports coupe, I might take a look, but that plasticy front wheel drive alienware computer case on wheels can go die for all I care."
ft86,35rkfc,fingerthief,2,Wed May 13 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"I guess everyone's entitled to their own opinions.   I'll continue to drive my ST and have a hoot, I've owned both cars now and no longer look at FWD as something that makes a car inherently shitty.   They're both great cars widely praised by automotive enthusiasts."
ft86,35rkfc,phaedrus1,2,Thu May 14 13:26:21 2015 UTC,"As someone who owned an FR-S and now owns an Focus ST I can honestly say the FR-S feels MUCH slower than the ST.   My roommate currently owns an FR-S and he also can attest to how big the difference is. Torque, is what makes people say a car is fast.   I absolutely love the FR-S still to this day but you know as well as I do that 0-60 times mean jack squat. Especially when the car is FWD.   In the end though I actually like both cars about equal, they're both different monsters in their own way.  Edit - and to be accurate the FR-S and ST 0-60 times are the same according to Motortrend."

But when I look,  i think what an amazing design,  that they demanded Subaru to create a boxer engine to lower the CG.  Only a handful of cars use a certain engine layout strictly to benefit the handling."

ft86,35nnsz,brztroubles,3,Tue May 12 00:02:55 2015 UTC,"The stock transmission and differential fluids in these cars are about as thin as water for maximum fuel economy and power numbers.  Unfortunately they are also not the most lubricating or protective of the meshing parts.  The Motul 300 fluids are much thicker and safer in the long run, but you will lose some efficiency getting things back to ""normal"" viscosity.  In fact, we even bumped up to 5w40 Motul motor oil for the same reasons.  A good tune and headers will really transform the power delivery on these cars, and you'll end up with noticeable bump in power and improved economy. (if you can keep your foot out of it. ;)  We ended up making +20hp across the board and +30tq at 4k dip over stock, and that was after upgrading the fluids to the thicker Motul stuff."

ft86,35lf8j,CrazyMike366,4,Mon May 11 21:23:18 2015 UTC,"I prefer splitters, air dams, chin spoilers etc rather than full body kits. The ""function over form"" racecar look is a bit goofy, but it provides the most aero effect at the least weight penalty and costs far less than a full body kit that completely replaces the bumpers and quarter panels and requires fitting, paint, etc.  My favorite FRS is MotoIQ's project car. It has quite a bit of work done to it, and a good portion of it (esp. the details) is not off-the-shelf pre-packaged solutions, so you'd need to go to a race fabrication shop to emulate it unless you're really handy."

ft86,35lf8j,randillio,1 point,Mon May 11 21:49:30 2015 UTC,"APR is probably the best known off-the-shelf racing aero provider. They have a pretty extensive range of racing options for the FRS and have established themselves as a proven option on countless track cars.  Custom fabrication might get you better results more tailored to your needs, like what MotoIQ asked for from Afterhours Automotive. They were focusing much more on track performance than street livability though.  Note that you might want to add front/rear aero at the same time so the car doesn't have unbalanced forces acting on it at speed."

Maybe I'll just upgrade my head unit and speakers!  I'll post results when I do it.  Probably within the month.  Edit:  The most complete sound proofing system I've seen, requires you to disassemble the cabin to put three kinds of liners down.  One is clay and designed to make panels produce less vibration and therefore noise.  One liner is a foam rubber gasket to stop rattling between layers of materials (like the rattle between my headliner and roof).  The last liner is sound dampening.

Lower volume than wrx means the costs will be even higher. If its 35k, its encroaching on a lot of other car's territories at which people wont even look at the car.

The road noise on less-than-new pavement is just loud enough and the stereo is just weak enough that it can get a little annoying at points.

So I live in a little college town apartment complex.  Yesterday I'm out talking to my neighbor (Francis) about cars. Well as we're talking another one of our neighbors pulls up in a mustang. Parks right next to us and revs nice and loud. I figure he's trying to impress the girls walking buy or something.  I figured wrong. This bro comes up talking loudly at us about how crappy my car is. Um... okay, he tells me his mom's focus is faster. No... it's not. Francis, proposes that we take his  2010 Civic Si, my (stock) BRZ, and new guy's (James) 2002 Mustang GT out to this venue parking lot and have a little drag race.  I know my BRZ is not a dragster. I know at stock it's a little under powered. Still doesn't make her ""slow as fuck"" or a ""grandma car""... Can't really hold my tongue when someone is saying their Automatic Ford. So... racetime.  So Francis grabs his girlfriend and we all drive off. We find a strip that is between 1/4 and 1/2 mile. No real way to measure. First up BRZ vs GT... Not even a chance. Off the line I dumped the clutch and made the most of it. Had just under a car length ahead for the whole go! So smooth for a first run.  GT pisses and moans about throttle response. Wants to re-race. Tell him he has to beat the Civic first. Civic. Races me again. Less perfect. Win anyways.  GT leaves. Francis and do donuts, screw around, & race a couple times. Wish I had video.  Friend shows up with his Modded-WRX and makes us both look bad. Doesn't matter. Can't stop smiling.  Edit: spelling/grammar."

I feel that people who buy the PSS do it for tire life in conjunction with a great increase in grip. But the lower the psi the more you are wearing the tire so if your goal is maximize grip it's almost worth checking out 200 tread wear tires that are almost the same price and you'll be much happier grip wise."

For tire pressures 37psi square is good for DD. When you autocross you have to see how you like it. Is the rear tail happy? Drop rear pressure. Is the rear too planted? Increase rear pressure."

ft86,35959a,The_Quaker,3,Fri May 8 22:25:59 2015 UTC,I think max camber would mean positive camber  https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.carthrottle.com/workspace/uploads/memes/2104_13-544bd6434b724.jpg

For instance I have a invidia N1 cat less exhaust system and the injen cai. Not sure if I need to do anything else with the oft to take advantage of the mods I currently have?

ft86,355bgj,blizzsource,3,Thu May 7 20:31:57 2015 UTC,Off-The-Shelf (OTS) Maps for naturally aspirated configurations. I'm guessing I download that one then ? Last link on the page u linked.
ft86,355bgj,blizzsource,3,Thu May 7 20:42:12 2015 UTC,"That's the one. You click the first link for the OpenFlash Manager, upload the OTS maps into the program, and then upload those into your OFT.   Make sure you choose the correct files based on your car.  US 6AT: US Automatic  US 6MT: US Manual  Then choose based on your fuel grade. You can pick up to 5 to keep on the tablet in addition to your stock tune (it keeps a backup of that on the tablet in case you need to go back ever).   Stage 1: Ready for stock car or any mods (catback exhaust)  Stage 2: Aftermarket catless header installed.   I'm not sure if it has to be catless or not.   So for instance, I have no exhaust or engine mods and am running Stage 1 93 (since I use 93 octane). Here in a week I'll install my JDL UEL headers and will then switch to tune Stage 2 UEL 93.  EDIT: So many acronyms that I feel like I'm back in the military..."
ft86,355bgj,pblack09,3,Thu May 7 21:20:17 2015 UTC,"IIRC from the forum posts, the stg.2 maps have to be catless headers.   You'll love the JDL UEL though, put mine on recently(along with the overfrontpipe) and it is incredible."
ft86,355bgj,TheNakedGod,2,Fri May 8 13:03:04 2015 UTC,Haha its all good man but its really informative and I appreciate you typing it all out. I'm using stock headers atm and I am still wondering if whether or not I should pull the trigger on some tomei's UEL
ft86,355bgj,blizzsource,3,Thu May 7 21:56:58 2015 UTC,"I can't wait to get my JDL UEL headers on. They should be getting in Monday or Tuesday. I sure hope they're worth the hype. I'm surprised how easy it is to install our headers compared to other cars, and it seems more effective, performance and sound-wise, than just getting a catback exhaust."
ft86,355bgj,pblack09,2,Thu May 7 22:16:37 2015 UTC,Im curious if I should go back to having a cat if i get a tomei header lol. Its probably going to be stupid loud
ft86,355bgj,blizzsource,3,Thu May 7 23:38:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard much about the Tomei headers. Tomei is definitely one of the loudest catbacks, but that's what people complain about most. Just saw a thread where someone had a Tomei catback, later installed a header, then sold the Tomei catback because it was too much.   What is your exhaust setup so far? I've got everything stock except the upcoming UEL catless header."
ft86,355bgj,pblack09,2,Fri May 8 03:05:36 2015 UTC,I'm running the invidia N1 with the catless setup atm. So far it's the right kind of sound for me at least. It's really deep
ft86,355bgj,blizzsource,2,Fri May 8 04:08:30 2015 UTC,Oh dang. A catless header added on would definitely make some boom! Haha
ft86,355bgj,pblack09,3,Fri May 8 04:16:05 2015 UTC,There are no maps on it when you receive it. You have to plug it in and read your stock map first. You'll install the Open Flash Manager from their website and that's how you load maps. It's pretty easy. I have some issues reading my stock map and I call Open Flash and they had the best customer service I've ever experienced.

ft86,352j7i,ImGenie4UGirl,6,Wed May 6 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"Nope, trade in. My M5 is about to hit 140,000 miles and is overdue for about $5,500 of scheduled maintenance and that's doing it myself. Needs timing chains, vanos, complete coolant system over haul, clutch, all fluids and new suspension. The whole cost of ownership is deadly on BMWs let alone an M5. I've replaced all of the above before and it's an absolute nightmare.   In the end I'm only paying like $12,000 for the top of the line FRS after trade in and that leaves plenty of money in my budget for a mild turbo or supercharger."

ft86,355h5x,HotCrockets,2,Thu May 7 13:17:56 2015 UTC,"Consumer reports has a very open term for ""reliability"".  The engine chirping (which has no fix) and them taking it in for that as a  recall would be one.  For my car, if I were to sell it today, I'd say it was the massive amounts of paint dings, rock chips, and windshield chips that I have, being a low car that gets driven hard means it gets abused by the road more.  The lightweight body panels, soft paint, soft glass make it easy to be dinged up.  There also might be problems with small oil leaks, exhaust leaks.  Smells bad if you get on the throttle the wrong way.  The frameless windows during the winter can freeze, and can frozen while stuck open without you realizing it.    I've had the engine make some bad, tired noises a couple times after getting off the highway for 200 miles.  VVT noise most likely.  It just didn't sound right, but went back to normal the next day.  The VVT sound on this car can be really loud and can sound bad sometimes.  Ticking, clicking, tapping, squeaking.  Maintenance is (going to be) fucking expensive.  My upcoming clutch job is billed for like 10 hours, but it probably won't take that long.  A spark plug job costs $400 because they have to lift the engine from it's mounts using a jack.  Dealership shook me down for $700 for my 30k maintenance which was just fluid swaps (oil, coolant, diff oil) and tire rotation, and didn't even include MT fluid swap, another $80/hr job from my local shop."

ft86,3512il,eecsasdf,3,Wed May 6 05:36:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, you'll be fine.  So long as you have more than 3mm of brake pad left (and you probably have more than double that).    Stock pads are amazing and as a novice you won't have the balls/skill to push your brakes to the point where stock pads may fail.   I've gone to 5 track days now, and recently I've begun really pushing it (so far as going off a few times) and I still can't manage to brake like the big boys.    I would replace the brake fluid AFTER the track day.  It's unlikely your stock fluid is bad and RBF600 is expensive.    Is your pedal firm when you brake hard?  If so, don't worry about it until after."
ft86,3512il,YouShallKnow,1 point,Wed May 6 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"One of the groups near me (not this event) requires that the brake fluid has been replaced in the last 6 months to pass tech. My car was manufactured in June 2014. The brake pedal felt firm going from 60-10 in autocross a couple weeks back... or at least it was responsive.  Am I looking at the correct RBF600? It's only 18 bucks on Amazon, but I didn't check how much I need."
ft86,3512il,YouShallKnow,1 point,Wed May 6 22:52:33 2015 UTC,"That's the right stuff.    If you want to be in compliance go ahead, it's only $20, but I think it's $20 wasted if your pedal feels fine.    You should only need 1 or 2 bottles depending on if you're just bleeding or doing a complete flush.  If you plan on tracking your car a lot going forward, buy at least one more bottle than you think you'll need, so you'll have one to bleed them if you happen to boil them during the track event."
ft86,3512il,redditisbadforme,1 point,Wed May 6 23:22:31 2015 UTC,"I was at Thunderhill a couple of weekends ago for my first track day with the stock pads as well (with 4000miles on them). I did 8 or 9 sessions in total of 20 minutes each on the track, and by the end of it, I didn't have any pad left to drive home. On the 5th or 6th session, they started degrading, and weren't performing as well as they did in the beginning. I pushed pretty hard though. No problems with fluid, but I'll be replacing them prior to my next event. I heard Sonoma is much scarier than Thunderhill (walls!) so I don't think you'd be pushing as hard as I did. The other (completely stock) FRS that was there that day had no issues, but...he was slow ;)"

I'm at 37k on the factory rubber, so I'm kind of going back and forth between either finding someone ditching the factory tires or doing like you did and going with a set of new SSs.   How are you liking them? They hold up okay during the winter months?

ft86,34oe7b,Cirrix,9,Sun May 3 01:05:14 2015 UTC,"Well if you aren't really a car person yet, you should try to bring one with you. If that's not possible...It should feel smooth, listen for any werid sounds like creaks, whines and clicking.  Look under the car for signs of scuffing and bottoming out. Check the interior for stains and wear. You can get a general feeling on how anal previous owners were based on those things."
ft86,34oe7b,92mnstanger,3,Sun May 3 02:12:04 2015 UTC,"It's nearly 3 years old (probably pre-ordered). It'll probably have some minor dings.  One of the big things to check on this car is how damaged the front lip is front parking against curbs. Most of us have scraped it a bit (I did backing it out of a driveway where I didn't know where the drop was). I wouldn't worry about that unless it has visible cracks or is visibly scraped where you can see without getting under it.  17500 is probably reasonable up to 50,000 miles for a premium. Does it have the push button start, making it the limited? That was about 2,300 difference for the original car (making less of a difference used).  Watch for pooled up fresh oil. If the dealer didn't put 92+ fuel in it, the fuel pump will probably make a obnoxious chirping sound for the 2013s. It should clear up when you put fresh fuel in it.  In the BRZ, if the front seats have had a lot of water spilled on them, it could ruin the electronics for some of the side airbags. Make sure it complains at you for not having your seat belt on in both seats."

ft86,34m0ij,Killianti,5,Sat May 2 10:31:43 2015 UTC,"(MAJOR UPDATE - If you have read this comment before, you might want to give it one more read. While originally dictating this comment I made a repeated brain fart which is corrected and detailed at the bottom. Ugh. Embarrassing.)  Sounds off to me.  During my auto-x season I tuned pressures using a probe pyro taking three temps across each tire after each run instead of using chalk (aka my results are better but a heck of a lot more tedious to achieve :) and never saw a discrepancy that high. Each tire was tuned to provide the best distribution of temperature across the tire in order to maximize its grip. Since tire temperatures are changing all day, the specific pressure numbers measured during the day are useless unless you spring major $$$ for a probe-temperature-adjusted pressure gauge. As such, the tire pressure numbers measured during the day are only used in the moment to help control how much air I let out during any adjustment. At the end of the day after the car has cooled I measured the pressures in a reasonably controlled environment just to have some numbers logged in order to help set starting pressures for the next event. I always ran with the tools and spare tire removed.  My pressure difference front to rear was much closer to your initial numbers: no more than a couple PSI. Sometimes only one. Maybe closer to three PSI one one day where I was trying some other setup options in addition to pressure. But usually around two PSI, plus or minus some side to side variation to account for driver weight distribution, course layout, etc.  My cold starting pressures were also close to your first set of numbers in absolute terms. You should never ever see 24 PSI on a hot tire, and certainly shouldn't want such a tire going lower still. You will almost surely not ever see 24 PSI on a cold tire, either. Not unless it was an extremely hot day on the pad, and likely not with this car, at the very least. And definitely not with a cold 34 up front.  What else changed between those tests? Time of day? Weather? Air temperature? Pavement temperatures? Course familiarity? Damping/rebound settings? Etc.  EDIT - Lots of ninja editing above to add clarifying information. I'm done now. :)  EDIT 2 - I realized a while later that I had a major repeated brain fart in this comment where I wrote temperature when I meant to write pressure. Holy crap I did it over and over. :( Should be fixed now. Such is life when dictating ramblings into my phone while chasing down things to get the day going, I suppose. I probably did it over and over because I always work with temperatures to adjust the car, and the resulting pressures are essentially a side effect."
ft86,34m0ij,gray_with_an_a,1 point,Sat May 2 13:26:09 2015 UTC,"First test was an hour before noon with clear and slightly breazy, low-70°F weather, and the second test was four hours later with clear and slightly breazy, mid-70°F weather.  Surface temperatures and tires temperatures increased slightly.  I followed the course loosely because it was a test'n'tune event, but I consistently pushed the car slightly past its limits on each run.  Dampers were set to maximum (stiff) on the first run.  Before the last run, I opened the rear compression valves one notch and the rear rebound valves two notches."
ft86,34m0ij,gray_with_an_a,1 point,Sat May 2 14:45:51 2015 UTC,"That's a reasonably cool day on the pad. Regarding pushing the car slightly past its limits on each run, I am assuming that you softened up the rear to cut down on oversteer? Were you actually getting any spins or just breaking the rear end a bit?  Oh, and what tires were you running? (EDIT - I spotted your tire and other mod and setup details on another comment. I'll comment further over there.)  On a sidenote, if you keep breaking the rear end, or pushing out the front, you'll be forever hunting more grip and no pressure change will suffice, and no suspension settings will suffice, because you will have simply been over driving the car. If I'm preaching to the choir, please forgive me, but you want to be hearing the tires at most, not ever actually breaking them loose.  Preferably, you will only ever be just short of even hearing them."
ft86,34m0ij,warman31337,1 point,Sat May 2 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I softened the rear to cut down on oversteer.  I noticed oversteer mostly under power.  It seemed to take less power than usual to break loose.  That alone could easily be a result in the change of weight distribution, though.  I'm still getting used to these dampers and how much a notch of change is, but all dampers are adjustable from closed to 12 notches open on compression and closed to 16 notches open on rebound according to the manual.  Next time I experiment, I'll try used the well-tuned pyro that is my bare hand on the tire.  It did seem like the adjustments I made didn't have much effect good or bad.  I'll just drive more conservatively when I tune."
ft86,34m0ij,gray_with_an_a,1 point,Sat May 2 18:25:56 2015 UTC,Is the car stock? What tires are you using?  How did the car feel with the rear pressures so low?
ft86,34m0ij,The_Quaker,1 point,Sat May 2 12:36:02 2015 UTC,"KW V3 coilovers, camber plates, strut tower brace, and rear lower control arms.  I also have a few mods that shouldn't have anything to do with tire pressures: header-back exhaust, flex fuel, engine tune, and carbon fiber driveshaft.  Camber is -1° front and rear; toe is neutral in the front and .8° in the rear.  I'm not sure how to measure rake, but the frame rails are almost perfectly level.  Tires are 215/45/17 Bridgestone Potenza RE-11A sitting on 17x7 rims.    The dampers were set to maximum (stiff) at first; I'm on a really smooth surface this weekend, and that felt great.  After I removed the spare and tools, I opened the rear compression valves one notch and the rear rebound two notches.  It was really loose on the first spareless run when pressures were set to 34/30, and it felt mutch closer to neutral once I got down to 24, but it was kinda squishy.  It's starting to sound like i need to open the rear valves another notch each.  Edit: Actually, I need to double-check my rear toe.  .8 doesn't sound right, but the tech at the alignment shop said he had to max out the adjustment to get whatever it was, so .8 might be right."
ft86,34m0ij,robotm,2,Sat May 2 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"Your setup definitely differs plenty from mine, but while talking with other drivers of the twins with various setups I haven't heard any of them mentioning using such differences between front and rear in terms of pressure.  I don't know the KWv3s in terms of common adjustment settings, but I do suspect that my car is running softer both front and rear than yours, and as you mentioned you may need to hunt for an even softer rear, though start by first keeping your driving in check. ;)  I'm running more negative camber than you are, though not by much, maybe a half degree, (and I'm frankly going to be reducing it) and I'm definitely running wider tires at 9"". That said, the other folks I've talked to were often enough running narrower ones and less negative camber and still didn't have that much difference. I'm also running a full zero toe setup on recommendation from a much more experienced driver of the twins, though that was more recommended from the perspective of a track driver which is something I've been doing a lot more instead of autocross.  Puzzling. At this point I'm leaning towards suspension stiffness and driving style. If you're too stiff in the rear or overall and/or really chucking the car around, you'll be lowering pressures all day and it won't be helping.  Do try to borrow a probe pyro from someone. If you were in my region I'd come over and lend you mine. There's nothing like pulling outer, middle, and inner temperatures from under the surface of each tire to tell you exactly what pressure changes to make and to shed light on what other changes to make next (camber, most obviously, but also caster, roll stiffness, suspension settings, etc)"
ft86,34lfud,vonwarewolf,2,Sat May 2 04:59:43 2015 UTC,"yeah the 'extra' warranties are usually not worth it, hence why they try to sell it to you.  lost keys, really?  there is a reasonable expectation of some wear and tare when you bring the car back, if it has a couple paint chips from rocks they arent going to charge you an extra 20 grand.  but ALSO, I found out other dealers are free to sell the warranty for whatever they want so like MD said you can get a better deal on it. also you do not need to buy the warranty at the time of purchase, you can still buy it a year from now"

The chance that you'll actually use it are probably slim to none.  Also, most car companies have a damage limit(expected wear and tear) already included for leases. Like for my old Mazda, I couldn't exceed damages of $1,000 when I brought the car back. I believe Toyota's limit is $750. Keep the car in perfect condition and you shouldn't have an issue!  Actually when I brought my Mazda back it had a ton of scratches and some minor dents on it. I was worried I would go over the $1000 limit. But I didn't. You will be charged a disposition fee if you leave to another car company when the lease is done, though. Usually something like $300."

The platform can support supercar levels of performance if you have the cash and access to a quality race shop.  The small and inexpensive sporty new car segment is pretty barren these days...just the Genesis Coupe, BMW 2-series, Miata, Boxster, 370Z, Mustang and Camaro as competition unless you're willing to look at other drive train configurations, and even then those cars aren't all really like-for-like with the twins...they're kind of a unique package at their price point.  If you take a broader view of the sports car segment that includes used cars (which can be had CPO with a warranty if you look hard and are patient for the right deal) I think it would be very hard to beat a used Cayman, C6 Corvette, or Elise if you're after pure performance at around $40k."
ft86,34kxr4,CrazyMike366,3,Sun May 3 02:03:32 2015 UTC,"The Mustang and Camaro as competitors to this car?  I don't see it.  Maybe the new Camaro once it gets the Alpha platform, as it is the Camaro is on Chevy's full-size Zeta platform."

While I agree the 86 Twins (and Miata) are in a class of their own when it comes to focus and feedback, the superior power-to-weight ratios of the pony cars will make them noticeably faster as weekend fun cars or track toys on all but the tightest of courses. They're worth considering if that's what you're after, but they're not everyone's cup of tea."

Hyundai's will depreciate faster because literally every person likes to talk about things they know little about, even me sometimes! But because of this, Hyundai does use very nice materials and have put out fantastic quality cars in the past at least 7 years to try and improve their reputation.  Miata is not what you're looking for if you love BRZ but worry about power in a few years.  WRX doesn't handle anywhere near BRZ. Power was also underwhelming when I testdrove it. People over-hype the hell out of it. Although to be fair I braced for liftoff.  Mustangs, Camaros, etc. will feel large and heavy, but a Porsche Cayman?  I'm not sure what any of the above mentioned cars can do better.  Other than seating and storage area, which should ALWAYS be considered at least a little.  Read up on it, watch some reviews. I've seen the Cayman make an appearance on a few videos comparing the BRZ with other cars in my research on the BRZ. Cayman always #1 but that's a given with its price."
ft86,34kxr4,Surefire,1 point,Sat May 2 14:01:00 2015 UTC,"I'd second the suggestion of a used Cayman, and to add to that, I think it's hard to beat a new M235i for just a few thousand more since you get the best compromise of looks, utility, power, and rarity."
ft86,34kxr4,thoailong87,2,Sun May 3 23:06:05 2015 UTC,"they just dropped the price on 370z quite a bit (although they also dropped price on the twins)  many options, you can buy it now and then if you dont want it in 4 years, trade it in, duh  (or supercharger)"

I'm probably just going to be sticking with the brz. I really wanted a car with a warranty and so adding a FI/SC would break the warranty. As suggested, I'll probably just wait for the warranty to be over and then add those parts. In a couple months you guys will have another brother among the ranks."

ft86,34jko3,selshan,7,Fri May 1 20:16:36 2015 UTC,One trick that'll help immensely and doesn't even cost you anything... Don't tailgate!  A friend and I both have BRZs... He has a habit of tailgating and has the chips to prove it. Just a thought.
ft86,34jko3,subtly_irritated,5,Fri May 1 19:17:07 2015 UTC,I don't even tailgate. It's mostly an issue of living in an area where trucks and SUVs are more prevalent. And the post-winter rock salt floating around.

ft86,34hghk,radroachbrz,2,Fri May 1 05:43:13 2015 UTC,Thanks! Your post really encouraged me to practice and practice and some more practice!   I was just starting to get discouraged... had stalled my car in an intersection and oh gosh that was just awful.   I've pretty much been doing exactly what you said in the post and it's working out great. I believe over time after extended period of ownership I will get this down and start enjoying the car more.   My work is only 5 minutes away... riding bicycle. So I'm riding a lot at night time to get a lot of practice in.
ft86,34eroo,post_break,3,Thu Apr 30 15:28:48 2015 UTC,Is that a back up camera hanging from the bumper? How do you like it? I was thinking of getting one because the visibility backing up blows.
ft86,34eroo,Dogkickerr,2,Thu Apr 30 15:48:31 2015 UTC,Yep. It worked great for about a year but died. I need to get it replaced. Cost me $15.

ft86,34eja1,DevanteWeary,6,Thu Apr 30 14:26:04 2015 UTC,The navigation/stereo system in my BRZ is terrible. I'd definitely go with your own.
ft86,34eja1,SupermansOlderBro,2,Thu Apr 30 15:48:09 2015 UTC,Amen to that. I got the dealer installed sub and was super disappointed by the lack of control. No gain or freq. adjustments that I can find. TONS of low end thump and rumble and a good amount of highs but absolutely no mids. I've played with the EQ for a good month now and I can't find a good balance. I'm thinking I'll just get a new set of dash and door speakers to help balance it out.
ft86,34eja1,lookamoose64,1 point,Fri May 1 12:26:03 2015 UTC,Hearing this more and more. Ever think about selling yours and getting an aftermarket?
ft86,34eja1,SupermansOlderBro,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:58:58 2015 UTC,"Selling the stereo system? No, I just bluetooth my phone to the stereo and use Spotify and I can use the screen to control what's playing so it's not a huge deal. Not a big enough hassle to swap the stereo for me."
ft86,34eja1,Officer_Ricki,5,Thu Apr 30 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"It really depends. I like modding my cars and know that I'm not leaving it alone no matter how much I try to convince myself that I will. That being said, if the differences are small - like options I would change anyway, then yes a base model/lower tier makes sense. But if things like the engine, major suspension components, brakes, etc. are different - then it's harder to justify.  Make a rough list as to what you want - from the dealer it will always be more expensive but certain items you won't be able to buy/find in the aftermarket. Example, a factory lip kit can be way nicer than any aftermarket piece you can buy and will hold its value too - same goes with fog lights in some cases. HID and Nav, aftermarket is cheaper and better in almost every way."
ft86,34eja1,richardmartin,3,Thu Apr 30 14:33:04 2015 UTC,In these cars the HIDs are great and the navigation is god awful. I agree it would be best to add it all up and see where it comes in at. Then you have to factor in things like factory warranty piece of mind and OEM part quality/longevity.  There's not going to be any one answer.
ft86,34eja1,teckademics,2,Thu Apr 30 14:39:42 2015 UTC,"Yes! There I'd tons of savings to be had. Dealers are notorious for over charging for little aftermarket options. If it was the simple stuff like headlights, taillights, interior stuff, wheels I would go for a base and build it up the way I want. If it was suspension, engine etc I would start with the premium model."

You may have to have one 3/4 Turn towards hard and another 1/4 towards hard for them both to be the same.  Then the endless stories of hitting a hard bump and they begin to leak.

ft86,34d17e,ShadowyNinja,2,Thu Apr 30 04:06:45 2015 UTC,As far as what type of fluids to use you can never go wrong with whatever it says in your manual. And if something iffy happens and they determine it was caused by their recommended fluid they will be liable for it. As far as changing trans oil more often - its a good practice not necessarily to restore quality of fluid but at least to allow you to have a chance to look at your trans fluid twice as often to see if it's contaminated in any way.
ft86,34d17e,KRONie,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:03:22 2015 UTC,"It was a part of my BRZ's 30k maintenance package, so I did it myself with oem fluid.

If you have a stiffer sidewall tire like the Dunlop Z2SS, you can get away with a 235.  With something like a Bridgestone RE71R, I'd go with 225.  Last year I ran 215 Hankook RS3s and loved them.  Sometimes the pinched sidewalls just aren't worth the extra section width."

I have seen people run 245/40R17 without any issues on the factory rims. Just make sure your pressure never drops below 25psi, ideally be 35 cold for DD."
ft86,348nnf,The_Quaker,2,Wed Apr 29 17:47:17 2015 UTC,I've seen 245s on a 17x7 but the offset of that wheel was +42 so like 6mm spacers. You might have stock wheel rubbing issues if you don't have a thinner coil over system.
ft86,348nnf,NorcalHPDE,2,Wed Apr 29 10:32:06 2015 UTC,You can fit 235 but your sidewalls will not be stiff enough. Highly do not  recommend tracking these if you go that route. 225/45 widest you can put on stock wheels

ft86,3455m3,nwpan,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:09:37 2015 UTC,"right now, 2014's are 3k cheaper if you buy cash. The biggest part of the rebate comes from the manufacturer directly, which will depend on things like their entire inventory, their new pricing (especially given the changes in exchange rate), etc. Dealers are usually not that desperate for liquidating their stock, unless it's like 3 years old."

ft86,3455m3,LewisKiniski,2,Tue Apr 28 15:36:22 2015 UTC,Contact your local Scion authorized dealership. See if the manufacturer has given them any info yet. The dealers will let you reserve for sure.
ft86,3455m3,revivethecolour,3,Tue Apr 28 14:15:36 2015 UTC,"Called/visited a 5-10 dealers, mainly for inquiring about used ones, but I also asked about 2016's.

They're made from the previous generation camry manufacturing equipment so the chassis wasn't designed to be a sport compact.   The BRZ is just the opposite. It felt kinda crappy to be honest (on the test drive). Half a year late and its like holy crap this chassis is amazing.

ft86,33x076,inositle,3,Sun Apr 26 15:18:13 2015 UTC,I would still look into the OFT + OFH combo even if you can't find E85. There are many threads on here and ft86 forums about the performance gains from the combo... around $1100 total or $500 if you just want the tune.

ft86,33x076,SAVEMTS,2,Sun Apr 26 15:41:44 2015 UTC,If you're using the OFT tune then you can reflash it to 93 yourself after switching back. Not as simple as a flex fuel kit but it only takes a few minutes to flash.
ft86,33x076,LimeNinjaLP,2,Sun Apr 26 16:01:06 2015 UTC,"We (wife and I) were actually on a little road trip a couple days ago in an unfamiliar area. Around here in the Midwest (US) E85 is pretty prevalent, but it was still a little stressful trying to find a station using an alternative fuel app when my fuel light came on.   As mentioned, you can just flash to a normal petrol tune, but it's a little bit of a pain if you want to be careful about it. Basically run the tank as empty as possible, fill up, drive slowly for a few miles using the OFT to keep an eye on your fuel trim levels. Depending on whether you're going to or from E85 you'll either see a huge rise in fuel trims or a huge cut once the new fuel makes it through the lines. Then stop the car, flash to new tune (3-4 minutes), and drive away. So it's not like you want to be switching tunes every tank, but you're not going to get stranded somewhere if you can't find corn juice.  I bought a 1' right-angle OBDII extension cable and a suction cup mount and found a pretty good spot for it just behind the a-pillar.  http://imgur.com/eUnA110  Edit: OFT is also really nice if you want to monitor oil temp or just about anything on the car that the stock gauges won't tell you. And yes, running an E85 tune on normal petrol wouldn't be a great idea - you'd end up running really rich and with too much ignition advance and probably get some knocking."

I'm not close to any stations that have it. Header back exhaust and time gave me +30 whp. About 80% of that is from the headers and not the rest of the exhaust.   As for exhaust, it's easy to do an axle back. If you have a decent set of tools and jacks you can do anything on your own. I have done my full exhaust, brakes and suspension in my own garage."

If that's all you want to do, I'd go with OFT as long as e85 is readily and consistently available in your location.  In terms of installing mods, most are doable by yourself if you have tools and a suitable place. If you're not very experienced I wouldn't go installing a turbo kit by yourself, but if you are accustomed to wrenching then I'd say everything but motor internals is doable by a weekend wrencher."

I bet you could do one in the trunk, and maybe another two in the passenger seat and one on the stack in the backseat, but I think it's possible."
ft86,33vpi1,Atomic235,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:51:33 2015 UTC,My friends have steel rims and they bend and all that all the time (not sure how). I got a cheapo aluminum + general altimax set last winter for $600 (mounted and balanced and shipped).   Every year I swap my tires twice. change to winter roughly when 40F is the highest temperature. (nov) and back to summer when 35F is the lowest temperature. (mar-apr). Its not hard to do yourself. I live on the third floor of an apt complex. A car jack ($60 from harbor freight) does the trick. Their torque wrenches ($10) are also a great value for this purpose.
ft86,33vpi1,kataxist,2,Sun Apr 26 22:22:15 2015 UTC,"If you think you'll drive it in stock form for awhile then as far as I'm concerned there are only two essentials:   Firstly you need to get the manual gearbox version, because the clutch will set you free. You'll also probably want to remove the return spring from the clutch pedal, which is pretty safe and easy to do.  Second, if you can help it, only put pure ethanol-free gas in the tank. It's literally the only fuel type that the stock system was designed for. Get it and you'll never worry about squeaking noises from the fuel pump. It's roughly 50¢ more expensive per gallon here, and I go out of my way to get it, but after suffering the crickets myself I think it's worth the trouble. In fact I'm sure the engine also sounds healthier, idles more smoothly, and gives a crisper throttle response. I mostly use 91 octane, but when I can't get that the 87 seems to work fine.  Everything else boils down to preference in my view. Just keep up on the regular maintenance and hose it down once in awhile; she'll treat you right."
ft86,33vpi1,kataxist,2,Sun Apr 26 18:33:45 2015 UTC,"When I purchase one I plan to keep it mostly stock for a while I think. I would of course get the manual and there are many places around me with 91 octane, but I'm not so sure if they are ethanol free. I just test drove one and I loved everything about the car. If I were to mod it, it would be a while down the road I think after I purchase it and get used to the feel of it I imagine.   Thanks for the advice though! I appreciate it."
ft86,33vpi1,kataxist,2,Sun Apr 26 19:05:21 2015 UTC,The 87 works in a pinch. 91 is really a cali problem. In ohio you should have 93. I live in michigan and ethanol free is impossible to find. :(  I haven't heard of anyone having any major issues with it though.

You will have problems with steep slopes. The ground clearance is fine at 5"" (1"" lower than normal passenger cars). Its the fact the front overhang is so long (its just magnified with the lower ground clearance"" that it can get annoying. I've driven on the highway during snow/ice. Its incredibly balanced but the FR behaviors come out if you step too hard on the gas. I could go a max of 40mph reliably on the highway that day. the safety features kick in fairly quickly when it detects slippage. Because winter tires are mandatory, you'll find yourself outdriving awd vehicles with all seasons. I've driven in fairly deep snow behavior >4"" The roads weren't plowed that day and it goes."

ft86,33uti0,lespaulbro,6,Sat Apr 25 20:59:54 2015 UTC,"These cars, particularly those manufactured in 2012, have a host of issues.   The fuel pump chirp is not something you should worry about; it's not a reliability issue, just an annoyance issue.  And if you find gas that doesn't chirp you can completely eliminate it.   The problems from 2012 are with two things that are related.  The old tune files for the ECU have an issue that can lead to engine failure, and there are weak DI seals that can erode and also cause engine failure.    If you're going to get one manufactured in 2012 or 2013, I would get it from a dealership with some kind of certified warranty so that if you engine fails you can get a replacement under warranty.    But if you get the updated tune from Toyota, or use any of the aftermarket tuners, you shouldn't have a problem.   The DI seal thing is always going to be a problem on old engines and I think they will ALL eventually fail; the trick is if you ever hear continuous popping, like fireworks or crackling in the engine bay, IMMEDIATELY stop driving, tow it to a mechanic and get the DI seals replaced (or do it yourself if you're skilled and have 3 days).   There are also significant failure rates for the transmission; I've abused the hell out of mine and had no issues, but there have been lots of warranty replacements on the tranny.  Listen for grinding (difficulty shifting into gears before it's warmed up is normal).    Let me know if you have anymore questions; I have one that was manufactured in late 2012 and I've had nearly every problem you can have.   All that being said, still love the car and think it's worth it."
ft86,33uti0,YouShallKnow,3,Sat Apr 25 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! This is exactly what I was looking to hear.  So if the car I end up with has 15K or 38K miles on it, wouldn't you think I should be able to notice chirping or trans problems during a test drive? I plan on going to look at two of them tomorrow, and want to know what to look for and be wary of and be cautious of.  Thanks again!"
ft86,33uti0,YouShallKnow,3,Sun Apr 26 00:38:28 2015 UTC,"Chirping seems to be related to ethanol content in gas, which can vary from station to station.  For me, some gas chirps some doesn't and it comes and goes.   So no, it's possible to hear no chirps during test drive and then hear chirps later when you get a different kind of gas.   I haven't looked into the tranny issue in depth because mine has always been rock solid, but from what I remember, it seems like it fails pretty quick.  I would assume if the tranny is working well at 38k, it's probably fine."

ft86,33svj6,cywinr,1 point,Sat Apr 25 08:04:11 2015 UTC,I wish it was that cheap in Australia ):
ft86,33svj6,HeatConvection,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:19:31 2015 UTC,"I think these commercials are dumb, but I so wish they were played in the US too... Why don't the twins get any advertising in the US?  I can think of 2 commercials in the past 3 years that had one of the twins, both commercials were for the FRS and only one had the FRS as the focus.  Subaru doesn't advertise the BRZ in America and I want that to change..."
ft86,33svj6,takaides,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:44:45 2015 UTC,Subaru doesn't really care that much about the brz. The wrx is their baby and that's where they make their money. The only reason they even sell a subaru one is because they wanted a little bit more money than they would get if they just let Toyota and scion do the selling of the car.
ft86,33svj6,Cpotter2996,1 point,Mon Apr 27 10:44:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree, though not entirely.  The WRX doesn't get much love  from Subaru's advertising branch either (at least for commercials), but it has quite the legacy behind it.  The BRZ doesn't have the same long lived legacy or fanbase that the WRX has, but is advertised similarly.  The WRX does get quite a bit of publicity from rally racing though.    As far as getting their money, that comes more from the outback, forester and legacy lines (totalling nearly 350k of the 500k Subarus sold in 2014) more so than the WRX or Impreza. Sure they get sales from the gear heads out there, but more people buy ""practical"" Subarus."
ft86,33sflb,iconformed,3,Sat Apr 25 04:21:29 2015 UTC,This one took me ages to figure out. If I remember correctly there's a place you can press with a flathead and the binding will loosen up.
ft86,33sflb,kl95210,2,Sat Apr 25 04:26:01 2015 UTC,"Ahhhhhh, thanks man I was getting super frustrated!"
ft86,33sflb,scorpionMaster,2,Sat Apr 25 04:58:30 2015 UTC,"The tube that goes into the firewall just needs to be pulled, I think. It may have a similar thing, though. Now something rattles down there, though. I have to check that out."
ft86,33sflb,Monte0704,2,Sat Apr 25 07:21:55 2015 UTC,"Trace the tube to the passenger firewall, and pull it off. Cap it with a rubber cap or plug and a hose clamp.   Take out the bolts and remove the whole stupid thing."
ft86,33sflb,Plasm800,2,Sat Apr 25 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard of a noise generator, does this take exhaust noise and funnel it into the passenger compartment or am i way off?"
ft86,33sflb,scorpionMaster,2,Sat Apr 25 19:01:18 2015 UTC,"Close.  It's connected to the intake tube, and makes you hear that."
ft86,33sflb,Zugunfall,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:01:31 2015 UTC,"You are more or less right, it's not exhaust noise as the tube is attached to the intake. But yeah there's a tube that runs into the footwell of the passenger side for noise."
ft86,33sflb,GrammarBeImportant,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:03:12 2015 UTC,"You don't need to that that off, just yank out the whole tube."
ft86,33sv4t,SixEightPee,3,Sat Apr 25 07:58:22 2015 UTC,"Are you setting the phone on the passenger seat? I have this happen whenever my phone is just sitting in the seat, it might be heavy enough / there's something triggering the sensor.. but if that's not the case you might want to take it into a dealer."
ft86,33sv4t,oxygenburn,5,Sat Apr 25 09:27:54 2015 UTC,"the phone is definitely not heavy enough to trigger the airbag, and if it is, thats also a problem"
ft86,33sv4t,seifer666,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:02:40 2015 UTC,"I believe the metal trips the sensor not the weight, as my ipod would do the same."
ft86,33sv4t,AT-JeffT,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:49:10 2015 UTC,"While the weight is not likely the culprit, I agree with the other posts. My nexus 4 is enough to make the seatbelt alarm go off. My gym bag with a bottle of water, gloves , etc, won't do it."
ft86,33sv4t,KW10,2,Mon Apr 27 00:55:00 2015 UTC,Happens to me too when the phone is in the seat. I think it is just EMI noise tricking the sensor. Design flaw if anything.
ft86,33sv4t,jared_number_two,2,Sat Apr 25 15:38:15 2015 UTC,"I tested it out just now, it only happens when the phone is on seat. I can put anything else on the seat, just not the phone. Weird."
ft86,33sv4t,Landanbananaman,2,Sat Apr 25 23:24:37 2015 UTC,The passenger seat sensor for the airbag is incredibly sensitive. Probably my only complaint about the car.
ft86,33sv4t,Landanbananaman,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:34:07 2015 UTC,"But the thing is, I'm a delivery guy, so I have stuff on the seat constantly, and it never goes off. But only with the phone."
ft86,33sv4t,Killianti,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:45:17 2015 UTC,Buckle the seat belt.
ft86,33sv4t,Necric,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:31:02 2015 UTC,"It's an electrical capacitance sensor, so a big piece of wood wouldn't trigger it, but a phone or a cheap USB cord might.  Move the phone to the center console and back as you watch the airbag light.  If you go to the dealership and explain your problem, they can disable the passenger seatbelt alarm.  They may charge for that, though."
