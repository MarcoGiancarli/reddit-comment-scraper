findapath,3e5xxb,kyniver,2,Wed Jul 22 10:09:09 2015 UTC,"I think a good start is to remove the label 'failure' on yourself. This is an important mental game that will have huge ramifications on the rest of your life. I'm an entrepreneur and we know this story too well. Many successful entrepreneurs don't succeed the first, second, third, etc. round. Do they life the rest of their life being a 'failure'? Of course not, they tried their hardest to make things happen and had huge leaps in personal development during the process. A process that will help them succeed in another area in their life.   'Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid.'. I don't think you're a failure. I think you're on one step right now about to decide on the next one, yet always moving forward. When people want to figure out the next step I usually tell them to 'imagine a happy life'. Literally envision it, draw it, or write it out. What are you doing in this happy life, who are you with, where are you, etc. That's a great method on figuring out your next step to get to that place."
findapath,3e5xxb,piconet-2,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:36:53 2015 UTC,"Biotech or healthcare startups? It's a rising field and you don't have to be a doctor to work in it. Head over to /r/startups.   Also, health imaging tech is a thing. As is healthcare management (billing, coding, insurance etc).    The question you have to ask is, can you see yourself being a doctor or working in healthcare without feeling like a failure for not having become a doctor one year from now, 5 years? 10 years?   If you never want to see the inside of a hospital, walk away quick. Because 1 month of feeling like a failure can turn into a decade of berating yourself and being lost. Sorry to be quite so dramatic but you are the guy or gal doing the job, not your family and grandparents. Be absolutely ruthless in culling the noise."
findapath,3e3v9u,razielty,5,Tue Jul 21 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"Woah, woah woah. Hold on a second here.   Let's get something out of the way early; School does not equal employment. It's enlightenment, resources, tools, inspiration connections and much more. It might have been sold to you as the way to a job, but it's just one part.   So to answer your question in a very direct way: YOU HAVE ALL THE OPTIONS.   My guess is that's probably where the problem lies. Too many options, no way to focus, nothing seems exciting and defiantly not easy.   So your goal really should be to decide what you really want to do next. Not forever, but next. You also might want to figure out what you're really good at.   If you can move into experiences that advance your understanding of those two things, you'll be on a great path.   Can you answer me this question: What do you want to do? What are you excited or interested in?"

I'm thinking I should get a job first and build up my experience but I'm not sure what kind of jobs to look for and most of the business related jobs require experience that I don't have. So I'm like in a catch-22 situation.   I'm not sure what I'm good at either. I've always found economics interesting and even though it wasn't my major, I did take around four econ classes and got good grades in all. And I read a lot about the economy, etc. But I don't think there's any economist job available for me. I've been recommended accounting, but I'm not sure if I'll succeed since it wasn't my strong point in college.  Basically, from what it seems I have two choices: either get a job or continue with my education. I'm not sure which one would be the best bet."

So I'm not sure if accounting is one of my strong points and whether I should really go into it.   Let's say I do want to go with accounting, what do I do next? Should I try to get a certification (ACCA, CMA, or CPA) or do my masters in accounting? Where I live, ACCA is very popular, and I've been told that CMA/CPA is a daunting endeavor, specially since I'm a management major student.  Edit: I forgot to answer your question about my bachelor's program. Here's a list of all the courses I enrolled in."

A Master's degree is probably the fastest way to do interesting work on interesting projects; a PhD is probably the fastest way to lead an interesting project.  Do you have any particular interests within this field?  It's very large.  Are you interested in pure single-threaded performance, or making multi-core chips faster?  Low-power systems like phones or high-power systems like supercomputers?  Do you want to design ISAs or ALUs or RTL?  Many of these areas will use the same skills, but it's usually helpful to have a goal in mind that you can structure your efforts around."
findapath,3e5cpv,Easily_influencedtbh,3,Wed Jul 22 02:07:22 2015 UTC,"Some schools offer undergrad degrees in nursing or social work. Obviously there's also the pre-med route. There's occupational therapy and physical therapy, which I think you'll need grad school for, and I'm not sure how common it is for PTs or OTs to work exclusively with HIV/AIDS patients. There's also public health, though that might be more behind-the-scenes research- or policy-type work and not so much working directly with individual patients on a daily basis (though I could be wrong, I don't know all that much about the public health field).  I'm a little confused that you say you want to be a doctor or nurse but what you really want is to work with patients with AIDS. Do you mean you want to work with patients in a way that is somehow different from how doctors and nurses work with patients? Or do you just mean you want to work primarily or exclusively with patients with AIDS and not any other kind of patient? It's definitely possible to specialize as a doctor. I know there can be specializations within nursing as well such as geriatric nursing or pediatric nursing or, even more specifically, pediatric intensive-care nursing. I'm not sure if there's disease-specific nursing, though -- you might want to ask a nursing-specific forum about that.  I hear the health care field generally has a strong job market, so I don't think these are impractical career goals if that's what you're worried about. (Why were your parents so unhappy about this path? In any case, they're not the ones who will be working your job 40+ hours a week for forty years, so don't do something you hate just to make them happy.)"

Or do you just mean you want to work primarily or exclusively with patients with AIDS and not any other kind of patient?   I guess I could've made this clearer, sorry. I guess what I meant was that I want to make an impact on someones life / a community rather than just being a regular diagnostic doctor, I want to be able to look back and say that I've actually helped people. I think I was using AIDS as a reference since I volunteered at a AIDS testing clinic in the past and I absolutely loved it, it really opened up my eyes in a lot of ways and I guess I just wanted to help with these peoples lives even further.  Generally speaking, if I had to choose between the professions I was listing above I would probably choose a doctor, I just threw nurse / paramedic in there to broaden the spectrum.   I guess I just don't know what to do or what job I would enjoy, I just feel stuck and every day that passes but I feel like I'm just sinking further into something that I don't like while I can't get a grasp on what I want to do, it really sucks.   (Why were your parents so unhappy about this path? In any case, they're not the ones who will be working your job 40+ hours a week for forty years, so don't do something you hate just to make them happy.)   They don't think I could ever pull it off, like I would be too sensitive or that I was just doing it because of all the books I read or something (at least that's what they told me).   TL;DR: Narrowing it down to being a doctor that wants to make a change in peoples lives"
findapath,3e5cpv,hbaetku,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:20:37 2015 UTC,"Are you still in touch with anyone you worked with at the AIDS clinic? Or could you get in touch with them? People generally like to talk about themselves and to give advice / feel helpful, so you could try asking them about their jobs and any other careers in that field that they might know about. A lot of times people who work in a particular field will know about careers that most people don't even know exist."

Ask the receptionist if you can spend time (over the phone or in-person) with one of the nurses sometime so you can learn about their career paths and other jobs in the industry.  Depending on how progressive your school is, you should also volunteer for various activism clubs in your school and start doing projects with them. e.g. LGBT clubs, HIV/AIDS outreach clubs, etc.  I wouldn't recommend just dropping in because they probably get swamped with appointments anyway."
findapath,3e300r,crumbdogbillionare,6,Tue Jul 21 15:50:12 2015 UTC,"It's time to get focused my friend.   Have you ever been that guy in the bar that walks up to every single girl, desperate to get laid? (ya you have, we all have) Well you're that guy in the world of career hunting.   If you're looking for anything you can remotely get your hands on, you come off as desperate, unfocused and uninterested.   Getting hired is all about convincing someone that you can can provide demonstrable value to them. To do so you'll need to know:   1) What you're good at and how to communicate that  2) What you want to do and why (so you can find the ideal companies to work for and convince them that you really want to work there) and  3) A few ways to provide immediate value.  1) What you're good at..  Knowing this allows you to focus on opportunities that you'll be better positioned to succeed at and will allow you to communicate why you're the best person for a role. It's about showing that you're awesome and you know why.   What are your strengths? I strongly suggest you take the Strengths Finder test. I found it immediately valuable.  What experience do you have and why is that awesome (you have it, you just need to sell it better)  2) What you want to do and why   You don't need to be following your ""passion"" but you do need to be interested in what you're doing. So what do you want to do? Liberal arts are great degrees for critical thinking, communication and much more. Don't discount those skills.   Make a list of the jobs / roles / industries that you're interested in. Make it big to start, make the list a few times over a few days, then start to see which ones keep appearing on it. Shrink it down based on what you really like, what you have skills in and what you have connections in (friends, family etc)  My suggestion would be to look for smaller companies. Startups, growing companies are much easier to connect with than larger established bureaucracies.   3) A few ways to provide immediate value.  There's a big difference between being one of a billion resumes and a real person with real value to add. The way people hire for jobs is 1) Look for people they know 2) Look for referrals from people they know ..... 3) Post the job for applicants.   Your goal is to be a person they know or someone that's getting referred by someone they know.   You do this by doing some focused work for free for respected people in the industry or company you're trying to get hired at. Find the person, figure out what they're working on or find a place where you can provide immediate value (copy writing? Market research? Help organize and event? Do some marketing tasks etc) reach out to them and offer your services.   This post is getting too long and I need to get back to work. If more details would be valuable, PM me and I'll be happy to help.   You can do this homie. Go get it."

You're still young (I know, you probably hear that a lot but it's true) so your focus should be on 1) Learning more about what you like, don't like and are good at and 2) Building marketable skills.   You don't have to choose the perfect career, you do have to take some action to start learning / building as noted above.  Go look into getting a car sales job, explore what it takes to be in real estate, find an opportunity to try on a sales role of some sort. Go and learn. If you don't like it, then try something else.   If you want to do yourself a huge favour, start documenting your learnings, write a blog or keep notes so you can update your personal portfolio/ resume in the future.   Showing that you're a life long learner, focused on developing skills and emotional intelligence and valuable skills, is something that will always distinguish you from competitors.    Go try things, you'll never know if it fits right or wrong unless you get in there and try. No over thinking here, take action."

Gaps on your resume are only ""bad"" if you can't explain why they exist. Teaching English, learning another culture / language, spending time to learn about yourself and your motivations are all really great reasons for a gap in your resume. It shows you're an emotionally intelligent, sophisticated human being.   2) Start planning to get into flight school. 1) You can be a pilot at 35, no biggie 2) Knowing what you want to do is something people dream of and/or pay lots of money to figure out.

I enjoy the challenge of breaking down a topic and making it more easily palatable.  I write about abstract art a lot, so the artist statements I get are pretty technical and sometimes too conceptual to work as a effective press releases. Quiet a few of the artists I've worked with also come from a scientific background so their art is often inspired by some heady scientific concepts, from cellular biology to psychology.  Working through the artists' own words I find the hooks and key points and find a way to communicate them that makes an impact when it hits the news-desk, and perhaps most importantly keeps the artists and gallerists happy.

findapath,3e0blp,Budke,0,Tue Jul 21 02:21:10 2015 UTC,I'd say look into supply chain management. If your college offers a program look into it. The field is ridiculously varied and offers the opportunity to learn everything it pertains to. It can be high stress depending on where you work since it is a 24/7 time sensitive field  but knowing you will always have a job is a good feeling.   If you couple a supply chain major with a management infomation systems minor you'll have recruiters basically kicking down your door to offer you jobs. An in demand specialized degree will open so many doors.

Things like molecular chemistry or protein biophysics are essentially quantum physics mixed with chemistry, and they can point you to a more specific and less ""populated"" field. Your research job can be made less in the lab and more on a computer, trying to calculate the shape of orbitals, or the way a protein folds, or the crystal structure of countless compounds, but you could also deal with spectroscopy and microscopy techniques.

Therefore be straightforward with them tell them what you want.  If they send you on a crap interview to try and make a quick buck just tell them that isn't the type of job you want.  Bad recruiters will try and convince you you have flaws so you should settle for whatever is convenient for them.  Good recruiters try to place you where you will thrive long term.  It builds them a good relationship so they can place more people.
findapath,3e08yh,Guy5145,2,Tue Jul 21 01:29:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there really shouldn't be any bad recruiters because they can't stay in business long if that is the case. Long-term employment agencies tend to be a bit picky, because if you are going to flake, they won't make money.   From what I understand, there are several kinds of agencies as well. I have used a temp agency before, and they can be hit or miss. Often they hire people with little experience and little education. The few times I have gone to one, I noticed I was overqualified by education, but not experience.   There are also headhunters which are paid different and they try to find permanent careers for people, but often those are for executive positions. But they charge you directly to find jobs, whereas a temp agency takes money directly from the pay from the company and pays the rest to you."

Also, speaking as someone who absolutely loved (and still loves) the liberal arts field I majored in and for a while strongly considered applying to PhD programs, my advice is to try to get a job at your alma mater or some other university, something admin assistant-y. Not as a research assistant and not as a teaching assistant, because those will make faculty see you as ""one of them"" or potentially one of them, but rather something where they'll see you as the help. Something where you'll have to deal with them when they don't get their way. I loved my university and my professors to pieces, and I do still like being in an academic environment, but it's been very eye-opening and more than a little heartbreaking to see academia at its ugliest, and all desire to get a PhD has been squashed. Also, have you ever attended an academic job talk? You should try that sometime if you ever get the opportunity. If it makes you feel like ""yes, I could do this, bring it on!"" then maybe academia is the right path for you. If it makes you feel like ""thank god I never have to be subjected to that,"" then, you know, maybe not."

My major required a Masters or PhD to make any real sense (Biology) and that didn't look like the smart time/money investment for me.  I also thought programming would be good way to pay the bills, even though it wasn't my passion.   Was able to learn it alright, but still pretty much a novice.    What I found the most success in was going to gigs/wanted section on Craigslist, finding out what people were wanting done (in the computer section), learning just how to do that, and then going an charging for those service (they were pretty simple stuff, and pay was as good as a low wage job).    Thats how I made my rent while I worked on making a business out of things I was actually enjoyed doing.   Don't have to do those gigs anymore and I am happy about that :)  I am still getting mostly paid for an area I enjoy but is not my passion.   Recently I have taken up doing one thing a day that will make me profit and one thing that I am passionate about.  I call the day a loss if I don't get one of each (full disclosure, most days are losses but the good days are GREAT).

Start small -- maybe work as a receptionist in a real estate firm or some administrative role, and learn how others' got their real estate license."
findapath,3dzdk6,sunnyandtony,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:18:43 2015 UTC,"I know this sounds dumb, but if you like sales and you don't have time to learn real estate or the money to go through the classes, I would say an insurance underwriter. The potential is actually really high.  You might want to finish your degree. Well, I would suggest going all the way for a 4-year degree, whether online or in person. One school to consider is American Public University if you want cheap education online.  As for your statement that you are more of a ""chief"" than an ""Indian,"" I cannot imagine what the heck that means nor do I advocate saying oddly borderline racist things. You probably should not use that kind of language when searching for a job.   To be completely blunt and honest, what you need to do is go back to school. But before you jump into any program, make sure that you have a clear goal in mind, and that whatever you do for education is career-focused. No matter how fun it is, don't go to school and study history or art. Just go to get what you need to succeed. I would look at programs in your area, not just degree programs, but license and certificate programs that would play up your sales experience, if that is where you want to go.   As for what the other poster has said, you don't need to get a job at a real estate agency to learn how to get a license. I assume you are in the US, and if you are, there should be local programs you can join to become an agent. My aunt did it in Washington state a few years ago. The job wasn't too bad, but she just wasn't a people person. When it comes to real estate, you need three things: 1. be willing to get your clients who are selling to clean their house, and you have to clean what they don't, 2. talk with people and make sure that they are interested in the house because you don't want to waste time in closing when they are not sure, and 3. negotiate. If you can do that, you should be ok.  Selling cars these days kinda sucks because new cars have a strong fixed price and people can easily research the cost of a used car. When I bought my car two months ago, the first dealer had a used car I wanted, but the second dealer had the same model, better color, and it was half the mileage and about 35% less, and the first dealership couldn't match it. And the internet guy sucks the worst as they spam and call all day long. It is good that you are looking to get out of it.  If you want a job in a completely different field, I would suggest getting educated first. Too many people are educated these days, and while your experience sounds solid, if someone is educated and has the same amount of work experience, they will probably get the interview first."

You do that with math. Computer science is similar. Most university comp sci programs relate more to the math and mechanisms behind coding rather than the coding itself. That's why they call them computer science degrees and not computer programing degrees. That said, if you learn to like math, a whole new world will open up to you which I find much more fascinating than the basic ideas you learn early on.

Germany: I have no idea but the Hasso Plattner Institute might be of interest to you.  UK: You don't have to pay tuition fees in Scotland as an EU citizen. Edinburgh is a very liveable city and Scotland in general is fun. Otherwise you need to pay up to 9000 GPB in tuition fee in England, which I find a bit much. Your grades might get you into Oxbridge. Try applying. It will be super competitive. It will also be super hard but definitely worse it. Getting into a master and subsequently PhD program will be easier at either Oxford or Cambridge (if you have the grades).   USA:  Ivy League schools are super expensive, especially for internationals. There are hardly any internships for international students either. Again getting into their grad-programs is a bit easier. If you get accepted into a PhD program you'll get a studentship (funding, yeah!).

A graduate degree in mathematics and statistics is in very high demand since many people don't pursue it / can't handle it.  Coupled with your financial work experience, I think you would be a very strong candidate after a graduate degree in something highly quantiative.  I can't counsel you on grad admissions and coursework, but I would like to help brainstorm some more ideas for you.  Consider a Masters in Management in Analytics, or a Masters in Data Science.   I would not pursue a masters in applied math (I speculate that you don't really know what that is). A masters in statistics on the other hand would also be very powerful.  Statistics / data science / analytics / operations research are all very quantitative and application-oriented degrees that complement financial services very well. They are in very high demand and can be related to many different industries. They are very quantiative and draw upon different disciplines in mathematics (i.e. some programming, some statistics, some pure mathematics, etc.) So you won't become a ""programmer"" but you have a foundation in programming to at least communicate to other programmers / do some basic programming yourself -- this is the sentiment I am sensing from you.  A Masters in Management is also a business-y graduate degree, like an MBA, but unlike an MBA, an MM focuses more on the quantiative as opposed to the general project management and people-y stuff in the MBA.  Go to /r/datascience to talk some more, but IMO they can be a little tough to talk to lol.  tl;dr Investigate more into graduate degrees in statistics / data science / analytics / management / operations research as they are very application oriented, in high demand and seem to fit you better.

It's like buying a book on 'how to fish' when you don't have a rod or any plans to go fishing. From the sounds of your post, I definitely recommend you take a break (you can always resume your studies later) to figure out what it is that you want. Having a degree that you don't need/use is a common scenario - seems like you're smart enough to figure that out before the end. There's an economic term called 'sunk costs' that you should check out, I think it's applicable here.   No matter what you chose, don't make life decisions based on fear.

I'm wondering if you made any headway with looking into the EA/Activision/Riot Games route (appears you play league, just like me!) positions because those are the very realistic positions you would have to look at to break into it. The top comment from your last post is great advice for a good starting point.   Any positions there that caught your eye?  Also, I'm wondering why not having a job impacts your streaming? All you need is a computer. You can even torrent streaming software if that's what's stopping you.   Honestly, it's not enough for you to just love games. Everybody loves games. Everybody in the industry loves games. But you have to find/have some kind of skill to break into it. The games industry really isn't all that different from any other industry (job wise at least. Sales wise, it's very different).   So take a look at some positions at game companies, there's a lot you can do. Artwork, designer, project manager, coder, network engineer, even accountants, HR, finance etc. Find what position you want. Then find the education/experience needed to get there, and start a road map of where the bottom is, and start there.   Depending on what position you want, you may need to go back to school. It might not have to be a Bachelors depending on the position. The reality is though, you will most likely have to go back to school for something.  The only exception I can think of is coders who make their own games. But in place of school, they have a ton of projects.   So at least pick a job in the industry that interests you"

First, I'd say define ""living a meaningful life"".  Some people say leaving the world a better place than you left it, and in that case, this can be accomplished any number of ways.  Being good to family and friends brings happiness to them and therefore makes the world a bit happier.  Entertaining people makes the world better.  Being charitable isn't something restricted to people working within charity organizations.  You don't have to choose a job that dictates your impact on the world.  Second, you have time.  I know, hitting that early twenties spot, it's like a bunch of friends are graduating college, getting good jobs, starting families, etc. etc.  But there's no reason to base your happiness off their accomplishments.  There are so many things to be grateful for, and no one worth-a-darn is gonna judge you for taking your time and figuring out what you want to do.  I know medical students who start into their 30's.  That means they won't be making a meaningful income until they're at least 36, and even then they're coming out of it with 300k debt or so.  A sad fact, but also liberating, is that the people you interact with will continue to shrink and you will lose accountability to many people you would normally feel bad about being judged by.  The good people in your life will congratulate you when you're doing well and help you when you're having a hard time, no need to worry about the people who are giving you a hard time because you don't want to rush into things, you don't have to listen to them, and I wouldn't.

You ought to pick a program that will check all the boxes that will enable you to pursue your goals of being a liver streamer (which other people have gone into more detail about how to achieve).

findapath,3dt8ki,fotbmyalt,2,Sun Jul 19 05:55:29 2015 UTC,"Well, with the combination of a BA(BPA?) and law enforcement experience, I'd imagine that would be sufficient to get you involved working in the justice sector in some capacity.  Have you applied for any jobs that get you ""behind the scenes"" in law enforcement?  I mean, it's one thing if you've got your sights set on a specific career path which requires additional training to get into, but with what you're already have I really do think that would qualify you for a number of administrative jobs, especially in civil service or criminal justice (and even related fields, if you're able to spin your skills right on your resume.)  Are you willing to move in order to look for these jobs?  Jobs that may be saturated with applicants in Vancouver may be in demand in Prince George."
findapath,3dt8ki,Magicksmith,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:25:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! I have indeed applied for a number of ""behind the scenes"" civilian administrative roles in law enforcement. I have received very little response from those applications. However, I have not tried applying for such roles since completing my BPA (not sure if that will make a difference), which I was taking while working full-time and only recently wrapped up.  In particular I have applied for criminal intelligence analyst jobs on multiple occasions. I have never received a call back for any of them, in spite of having journalism/editorial experience, law enforcement experience, and completed coursework specifically in criminal intelligence analysis. I was actually applying to be an intelligence operator in the military with the hopes that this might help me in a career transition into criminal intelligence (obviously I need a new plan).  I am definitely willing to move, as I'm single and I rent so nothing is tying me down.  Honestly I was getting a bit discouraged about that specific path, both because of the lack of response I've received and the competition with people who have policing experience (which, as stated, I am ineligible for). However I do appreciate your feedback and if nothing else it does give me some encouragement that my experience/education is, in fact, decent.  EDIT - I also at one point had an interview for a position involving maintaining a database, running various searches and assisting in investigations for a law enforcement agency. Seemed like a dream job at the time but I ended up being the number two candidate due to another having extensive experience with the software they used. So I guess that route is still an option for me."

Peronally, without knowing you, I would do option two and then option one, and see if you can get into some kind of programming market that is involved in energy or related to EE.  Why not go to school for electrical engineering? Sounds like that would be more up your skill set."

That tells me you're probably smart.  On a side note, I also want to say that when I was in high school deciding on my career, I thought I'd never want a 9-5 office job. Wrong. I work a 9-5 office job and absolutely love it.  I'll give you a few suggestions:  1) Psychologist. This actually seems to be the most fitting choice. It requires quite an extensive education (probably PH.D) but you can make good money and help people at the same time.  2) Audiologist. I say this because it was recently ranked the second best job. It does require a specific education and is known for being low stress and paying a decent income.  3) Occupational Therapist. Similar in stress and income to audiologist.  4) Speech Pathologist, similar to the above two.  All of these help people for a living.  I'd recommend psychologist because you seem to be a great writer. There's a lot of potential in that field if you go all the way with the education.  Here's a place I looked to try and help you: http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/jobs-rated-report-2015-ranking-top-200-jobs"

findapath,3dq2eg,sunnyandtony,6,Sat Jul 18 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"Physical therapist.   I have the same mindset as you, and this is what I found to be more fulfilling out of all the other options. You can help all age groups, you get to have 1 on 1 conversations with them, and also help them when they feel helpless. You also have to keep up to date with research, so that you can give them better treatments, and also to understand the underlying principles of how the body works. It is also relatively new as a field, and so there is a lot of room for research and innovation. You can also finish it in as little as 5 years (undergrad + grad), and still be called a Doctor.   Psychologist would probably be the best, but that field is getting over-saturated."

It depends on if you are looking to help people directly or indirectly. I think Speech Pathology is a great career choice if you want to help people directly. I know a few people who picked this career and I hear nothing but good things from them about their jobs. But also think about jobs where you help people but don't necessarily interact directly with the people you help.   For example, the woman in charge of managing the MacArthur Foundation's endowment fund makes $500,000 a year. She also helps a ton of people because she is able to manage the money really well so that it can be given out and make the world a better place. Most people don't think of investment banking as a career that does good for people, but it can be used for good because it's a highly valuable skill!  Also consider something like programming or engineering. Technology can help people's lives tremendously. Again, not all jobs in the field will be fulfilling for you, but there are many technology and engineering companies that have the goal of helping other people. For example, biomedical engineering. Or a technology company that programs software that helps kids learn in school. You could even learn how to program your own apps and exercise your own creativity and ownership of how you want to help people through technology.   There are so many options!"

The best opinion I can give you is that if returning to poverty scares you that much, shoot for a job that pays (and pays well). You can always have extracurricular activities or if you do end up hating your job, it's easier to 'move down' than it is to 'move up' in life. Stress will follow you regardless; learn to manage it.  I've gone through a lot (and continue to) to get to where I am in an industry I love, but one thing I can tell you was that it's not easy in every way - my situation is probably an extreme case, but it's never easy is no matter what you're doing.

The difference is that while you have more ambitious aspirations, they want you to consider taking a much safer route to get there.  I'm not here to tell you not to aim high, but I will say that getting to work for the best of the best is a process and it won't happen quickly.  It will take years of hard work, making the right networking connections, innate talent, practice and refinement, and even after all that you need to count on the stars lining up and providing you with the opportunity to even attempt to be noticed.  But again, it's really not that I'm trying to dissuade you from pursuing this path!  What I want you to take away from this is that success is a process and you need to make your peace with living through this process, every single step of it.  You need to accept that you might not make the salary you'd like immediately, or you need to suffer through uninspiring jobs, or that a future partner's needs might conflict with your aspirations, or any number of complications.

I think you are a great writer, and clearly have a conscientious mind on your shoulders that is able to your thoughts to paper (or in this case, Reddit).

I quite often feel discouraged, as I see the way the world works and not all stories have a fairy tale ending. A lot of really unfortunate things have happened in my life so the idea of actually publishing a book almost sounds hilarious to my inner psyche. I try not to give up on publishing my book, but between working 60 hours a week, trying to get debt paid off, bills paid and get my life in correct working order it feels like I never have time for it. I sit down some times, thinking about E-mailing a publisher or literary agent and I just shake my head and smile. When I do lay down to sleep at night, I think about it, I dream a little. The main thing I focus on isn't fame or fortune, it's simply being able to do something with my life that deep down inside I feel I was meant for and being able to inspire others in the process. Not just in a ""See what I did!"" kind of way, but actually meeting with people, talking to them, helping them in whichever way I could and being able to live my life on my terms while realizing my dreams.

Though I can't tell you what I would do in this situation as I'm in a similar one and try to figure things out.  First, pursuing psychology as a career will take you several years. At least in Austria it is important to complete postgraduate courses which are quite expensive and take time in addition to the master's degree.  I'm sure there are good niches for social science people like anthropologists. For example, there is career counseling or user interface development (i.e., thinking about how people like to interact with machines/computers). But studying it without a clear aim and knowledge of the job market is, in my opinion, not a good idea. At least when one tries to make money with this degree.  The only advice I dare to give you is to seek proper career counseling. Introspection and thinking about your future is a good start. With a proper career counselor or psychologist you can start analysing your personality, interestes, skills and competencies. Depending on the outcomes the counselor might be able to suggest  suitable jobs and careers for you. If it turns out that you like hands-on stuff, then it's ok to pursue an apprenticeship or a vocational training! Though you'll likely face the fact that you have to study with younger people again.  I wish you all the best for your future!  P.S.: Please give your posts more structure by using paragraphs and try to use shorter sentences. Your post was difficult to read."

When you look around you'll see that a lot of people do mundane work, don't really have a plan for their career and tend to follow their hobbies in their spare time. I think today's youth wants to have the ""perfect"" job which combines their interests and keeps them happy ever after. But that rarely happens. (Google ""quarter-life crisis"".) Fears about the future and possible failure is not uncommon. My parents talked to me about their past fears when I had troubles and opened up. You are not alone! Figuring out what to do seldomly happens as a single, great revelation. It is more of a gradual process. I give you the same advice as people have given me: Think about your aims, work and try something, get feedback (from others and yourself) and progress steadily towards a satisfactory goal!

I know two different master electricians who found a loophole here in Colorado, the state will approve you for your masters if you have an electrical engineering degree and get a master electrician to sign off on one year of in field work.   They got bored behind a desk and now make more than they used to as self employed contractors. Get the degree, gives you more options later in life.

If you do everything perfectly you could be a Master Electrician in 5.5 years or 11,000 hours. Combine the wrong type of hours with a little procrastination and you end up with someone like me pulling it off in around 8-9 years.

Look up requirements there, I'm sure a little digging will get you answers. Each state is different.

Before you make any decisions, can I recommend you pop on over to /r/personalfinance and read some of the stories from people who have spent time paying down their student loans?  I'm not going to pretend that the college experience wasn't generally great, but you'll still get to experience it once you've spent your 2 years at the local school.  (I'm assuming you'll spend 2 years there getting your general electives, then move on to a different school for your major?)  I would especially recommend this route if you don't have a clear idea of what it is you're going to school for.  Two years of schooling free of charge means two years where there's less pressure to maintain a job, and two years worth of the money that you do make which can be put towards the final two years' tuition, easing your burden even more.  That's a two-year head start towards being debt free, giving you the luxury of worrying less if you can't get a decent job right out of school.  That's two years worth of tuition which, instead of going towards classes, can be put towards going on an amazing trip around the world, or a car, or a radical apartment of your own.  That's two years that you can completely fail, and be no worse off for it.  You'll have the freedom to make mistakes and discover what it is you don't want to do.  That's much easier to swallow when it doesn't come with a $20,000 price tag.

There are a lot of interesting jobs in media where you can potentially get in on the ground floor and work your way up. A few options (with examples of types of jobs are below)   Try a a digital media startup. Your media background will come in handy and as the space explodes, you have a chance to get your foot in the door and grow alongside the company.    Jobs like these: http://tapwage.com/channel/diving-into-digital-media  An events coordinator, or social media associate might not be the most glamorous or high paying out of the gate but can get you in the door, and be a platform to build a career.   Consider a career related to the media but in sales. Something like ad sales. Hugely coveted and getting more an more important. Something like these: http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs   An account exec job if you feel you have the people skills and sales demeanor or a yield analyst job if you are more quantitative  oriented   Maybe a junior marketing job at an entertainment company. Like these: http://tapwage.com/channel/the-audience-chase   You may need to start as an intern or a planning assistant. But you will likely get paid and again have a chance at building a career in the space.  If you are a good video producer or video editor, there are interesting jobs out there too but those tend to be freelance so unless you have the hustle and really want that career, it can be hard to eke a career out of that.   Good luck and feel free to pm me with further qs."

Some of the potential areas:   If you are knowledgeable about something, you can try creating and selling online training. Checkout sites like udemy, fedora etc. The good thing about this is, that it doesn't have to be IT related. Check out the courses on offer on the above (and other similar sites) to get a feel of what is in demand and how that fits in with your abilities/skills/experience.  In the same vein, you can do freelance work (freeagent, elance etc are some websites that come to mind for scouting work)   I am sure there are many other avenues for earning online, but these are two things that come to mind.  I like the fact that you are doing this to (presumably) lead a lifestyle that you want to, rather than being money driven and that you have set your expectations low (to begin with). However, I think, once you find a niche and start exploring, you will earn much more than your current goal. All the best with your adventures. :-)"

findapath,3djhb0,clysm52,2,Fri Jul 17 01:26:30 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who just started doing freelance social media expertise (or whatever else it is called). As long as you are good with social media and copy writing basics you could try your luck at getting a few regular customers to support your income.  She set up packages customers can purchase and is willing to negotiate based on their needs. The package is really a starting point to get an idea about the time dedication she has to each customer so someone who just wants to keep their stuff relevant with a few tweets a week can get something cheap or someone who wants a Facebook babysitter can pay a ton.  She got started by doing it for a local Etsy business. She started writing their blog and finding relative links to share on their facebook/pintrist, advertizing sales or new items, and also networking with helpful businesses. Now some band manager just really needs her to do basic little interesting tweets that involve very little research & time but they want dedicated hours to answering fans questions across their social media.  Between the small jobs that only take a few minutes netting her $10 bucks here and there, the larger accounts rake in a fair bit. I can't recall numbers but she says it's paying her bills and she doesn't have to go anywhere but open her laptop in bed.  So the work can vary a lot and it can be easy to get in over your head (she gets customers asking if she can just do a bit of photoshop or other extras) but that can benefit you too since you can just charge more for specialties like this! That what she started doing since she knows a bit more than the basics of Photoshop.  I'd say the biggest downside is perhaps little job security (a client could no longer need you suddenly) and starting up will probably take a while.  If you want to try this I'd make a very professional website that really exemplifies what your customers wants and needs, and target small businesses that need up with all the stress of doing everything themselves. That seems to be my friends niche and is working well."

You're just facing some adversity right now and I strongly believe that if you quit now, you're going to regret this decision for the rest of your life. I'm not sure of your financial situation or whatnot, but if there is any chance that you can take the class again and not be on the streets or starving yourself, you should do it.  Honestly, GET SOME HELP! Get a tutor, make friends with your other classmates, so you can exchange some contact information and maybe get a weekly study group going on. Hit up EVERY one of your teachers office hours. To be honest with you, I have yet to see a student fail by going to the office hour every week and asking questions and tutoring. I think teachers actually like that and shows you're eager to learn and try to improve your grades.  Don't give up. When I was young, I always wished I was out of college so I can work and make money and do whatever I wanted, but now that I'm out of college and working and handling my responsibilities, I wish I was back in school.

I read in your other comment that you failed twice; you wrote your two options left are: drop out (cut losses) or stay on (and potentially lose more). I don't want to be presumptuous but it sounds like you have a mentality grounded in failure and negativity (or a scarcity mentality), where you don't believe there can be any positive outcome. E.g. why are you so sure you won't succeed the next time? If your mentality wired that way, it doesn't matter what you do because you'll just keep failing. I deeply believe that the human 'self-fulfilling prophecy' bias is at play here.   It sounds cliche and definitely not the answer you're looking for, but I think you need to work on your outlook and mentality. You don't always need a plan, but you do always need to have a mentality that serves you well.   But if I was to just answer you question: there's a tonne that you can do now. Get a part-time job, work on a side-project that you're excited about, try to scale that side-project to become larger, and ultimately make that side-project your own business.

Some people do blogging, some people review products or movies, some people carve wood, some people learn coding to make their own games. I'd like to say, all of those things I mentioned can become full-on businesses that earn a ot of money. Generally speaking, your side project is the thing that you would do in life if money was not an object.   If you work hard at something, consistently, over a decent period of time - you'll get good enough at it to make a living.

The hardest part about transitioning was getting the company to put me in a sales role. They were pretty set on wanting me in there as a technical account consultant or software developer. But I landed an interview after pestering them enough and now I'm doing this. Sold my first 100k customer a few months back and I've just kept going. Some new startups, (like this one) will give you a percentage of earnings from accounts rather than the one time commission. It works out better for me in the long run since the more accounts I keep happy with our company, the more money I make.

I have had no luck finding a good paying, full-time job with benefits in my 1.5 years since graduating. If you're really interested in math, I think that's great because I like it too! However, I suggest you do one of the following if you're set on math:   Major in Statistics/Applied Statistic & Minor in Math of some kind Double major in Stats & Math Major in Statistics - it might be enough by itself to satisfy you   A career as a ""mathematician"" is very hard to come by, if not archaic. Also ""high level"" math involves A TON of theoretical math - not number crunching. There are certainly applied math courses that more practical and technique-focused, but you also have to do a lot of theoretical math. And that may not be your thing. Or it could be. Or it might be something you can get through for the sake of the degree, but you don't enjoy it. (The latter example was me!)  Of course, you're only a senior right now. Once you get into uni and start taking courses, you might find that your interests change. Expect that, or at least be prepared for that to happen. I formally changed my major 3 times. Take a stats course, take a math course, take something you might have a slight interest in and see where it takes you.  As /u/bluefuzzyoctopus said, maybe try finance. Perhaps a more number-focused business degree might fit you well.   Also, since you said you don't want to be programming for your main career, don't major in computer science. That might be obvious, but I wanted to include it just in case. Statistical jobs/career will require scripting but not full-blown algorithm/program building.  I know college is supposed to be a time to find yourself and explore, but jobs, these days, are so dependent on having a degree that you need to consider your choice carefully. This is especially so with technical jobs/careers - your degree probably will really matter (unless you are super lucky or have a fantastic job network). But don't stress too much your year or so of college! I didn't make my final major decision until my junior year and that was fine.   Let me know if you have any more questions about a degree in mathematics!  Best of luck!"

It's good to think about what you want to study, but there are very few differences between programs at an undergrad level, unless you're getting VERY specific (like engineering at MIT). Industrial engineering actually might not be a terrible idea...  I would suggest looking into finance as a career; it's not quite ""high level"" math, as I think you mean it, but it is numbers focused. You could skew towards the investment side and look at career there (I know almost nothing about that), or go more toward corporate finance (I know slightly more about that thanks to my best friend).   Do a lot of research into possible careers (hopefully, here is a good start), and then dig in as much as possible. Find people who do that job (never too early for LinkedIn...), ask them about it, what they like and dislike. How they got where they are.   My brother has a math degree, but got programming jobs out of school, shifted to focus on project management and now he runs a start-up/incubator.

I grew up in the south, but spent the last 10 years living in NYC and Chicago. I moved back to the south because I'm done with dirty cold urban living, and I've come to really appreciate the south, finally. But I could not find a decent job at a livable wage to save my life. In NYC, I was making over $33/hr. For the same type of job, requiring the same amount of experience, in the south I was repeatedly offered $13/hr. Yes, the cost of living was cheaper, but it wasn't 2/3rds cheaper. I ended up having to move back to a major city, and am planning on getting a second degree that will get me career pay in the south, i.e. engineering."

My husband had been going through something very similar, and has been struggling to adjust to civilian life.  My best advice would be to go to school.  Pick something that interests you, and along the way try everything you can until you find something that you would be content/happy with as a career.  There are tons of careers that will give you a predictable and comfortable life like you want, but one of the biggest things that will aid you with that is having the education. Especially since you said you don't like IT.  Even if you just declare that you're going for an associate of arts or science, and take a few classes that interest you but aren't related you'll be on the right path.  Just don't let yourself stop moving forward. :)"

You said you want to push yourself more (and we all know student life has wiggle room for more), then I encourage you to immediately start working on side projects. Get together with some friends, work on something. Build a website. Discover the world of direct response marketing. Learn about lean startup methodology. Apply traction thinking to any small business idea. The trick is to start with using (close to) no money, and try to make shit happen.   No matter what happens in your future life, the entrepreneurial ability to make stuff happen with close to no resources will be beneficial to you. Pharmacist or not. Employee or not.

With that income fuel your dreams and passion. You can learn animation online, take classes in your off time. Just think about it for a second. You got into education and you made it this far. Can you do both? If anything animation is less stable than a teaching job. Maybe you can start making like mini series on you tube or something and probly get paid if its good. Just don't be afraid, if it sucks it sucks, you will get better. Just put in the time and make a real commitment to learn and express your ideas.

I wouldn't give up on forestry just yet.  After all, you're still fairly new to this university thing and it's damn tough!  A consultation with your program advisor is in order, but for now I think it best that you scale back your efforts for a bit.  The foundation for the forestry program requires many prerequisite classes in the basic sciences, and for the next little while I would suggest you chip away at them - no more than one or two courses per semester.  These courses are foundational, and you don't want to be up the creek when you're in FRST 4000 and that C- in BIOL 1100 is holding you back.  How is Langara for online courses?  You may find that if taken online, some courses can be taken over a longer period of time than the typical semester.  In this case, it could give you some much needed time to delve into the material and get a good handle on it.  Is Langara your only option?  I ask because TRU also offers a foundational forestry program on campus (2 years), but also because their online offerings are on point.  For instance, their online equivalent of their Principles of Biology course runs for 30 weeks - that's more than 6 months to spend on a single class.  It requires some discipline (don't slack!), but you may find this is just what you need to understand the required concepts.  However, I do realize that Kamloops isn't exactly in the greater Vancouver area.  Man, I love BC universities.

I've yet to take an online course at Langara. D2L is basically a content dropbox for profs to use so they don't have to deal with students asking for a copy of notes since it'll be downloadable. The lack of prerequisites is my main concern and the BC govt cut off funding on adult education for upgrading high school courses. Chemmistry, physics and pre-calculus are the only ones that gave me huge pain in the ass. Basically the only option for me is to shell out a few hundred bucks on an equivalent course at Langara or VCC. Langara is closest to where I live and TRU might be a good alternative to UBC; I don't mind living in Kamloops.   Yeah, I whole heartily agree that the C- in BIOL 1115 held me back and that's actually my 2nd attempt on the course itself. Not sure if a 3rd try is feasible since my GPA is in the low 2's atm.

Edited to add: when meeting face-to-face, we introduce ourselves by our names but usually not by our genders or ages, because those characteristics are usually things we can more or less discern by looking at someone, whereas we don't know their name unless they're wearing a name tag. On reddit, everyone is effectively wearing a name tag of sorts (their username), but each user's physical appearance, and therefore age and gender signifiers, are completely unknown to other users unless stated explicitly.

All the users here, we of course give answers based upon our personal experiences.  And of course, all of our experiences are different!  The college advocates had a generally positive experience and most likely got a job in their preferred fields right out from graduating.  The college detractors probably wasted a lot of time and money for very little payoff.  And in between these two experiences, are examples of every other result that can come from pursuing any path.  There are no sure things in life, and this is true as much of your career as it is anything.  That's adulthood.  Heck, that's life in general.  You'll learn to alter your metric for success away from finding a ""sure thing"", and to turn it more towards finding happiness no matter which path you pursue.  Sure, solicit as many different opinions as you want in the meantime, but the fact is that for all the suggestions you get, it's not about what was successful for that person, but it's about which suggestions resonate with you.  Resonance is that little tug you feel in your chest when someone says something that piques your interest.  It may be a small sensation, but it's always worth investigating.  Do you have a job right now?  Once you graduate high school, you'll probably want to pick one up anyway.  Quite possibly, the best cure for analysis paralysis is working a menial job for a few years.

findapath,3dbxws,_____SHADOWBAN_____,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:12:53 2015 UTC,"I've spent time in both Denver and Austin (I currently live in Houston and go to Austin biweekly). I'm actually considering the same two cities. So here's my take:   First, I have no idea what the job market is for physics in either place, that would be my first research. Second, definitely save money before you move. I would say enough to live on for 3 months minimum. If you find a job with good pay first, that's a viable alternative plan.    As for Denver vs. Austin: it totally depends on what you want out of a place, they are very different. They've both gotten quite expensive in the last few years and are still climbing, especially for housing.   Austin:  killer music scene. super active party/nightlife scene. some say too active.  SOOO MANY HIPSTERS. tattoos and colored hair are the rule, not the exception. Even on your average 40 yr old.  IMO, the best mexican food in the US.  Housing is getting very hard to find, and prices are climbing like crazy. 200 people a day move to Austin and locals have replaced their ""Keep Austin Weird"" shirts with ""DONT MOVE HERE"" shirts.  The non-stop festival schedule apparently gets really annoying and takes the city over several times a year. Many folks that live there leave Austin during City Limits and SXSW.  Austin itself feels very hip, small town. It never really feels like a major city. Immediately outside Austin, it turns into farm country. and it's HOT. so hot.  If you're not from Texas, it's hard to understand just how hot it gets. 80 days over 100 degrees.  really great neighborhoods. so many amazing food trucks. not sure if you're a guy or not, but the women are so hot.  Jobs are hard to come by for recent college grads. This might be better with a physics degree than with your typical hipster liberal arts degree.  used to be a video game industry town, is now a digital tech town. UT is a top notch school, there may be some options there for you as a physics grad. basically think of it as SF/Oakland or Portland crossed with Texas.  Denver: 300 days of sun a year, but dry and never really gets that hot or that cold.  unbelievably beautiful. RMNP is 45 mins away. Red Rocks is closer.  Rent is expensive and getting worse. Food is expensive.  Sportsbros. so many outdoor sports bros. In fact, pretty much everyone in denver is obsessed with some outdoor sport, and almost every single person is wearing something Patagonia. very few hipsters, though, if you're a hipster hater.  Music/arts scene decent but not amazing.  Also a tech hub, a bigger one than Austin.  so. much. weed. culture. everywhere. It can get really annoying if you aren't a weed person.  food is pretty good, not amazing. Although there is a terrific ice cream spot in Baker.  University is ok, not great.  Basically, it comes down to if you prefer a really active local arts and music culture, or mindblowingly beautiful outdoors. Denver probably has more job options overall. Keep in mind that outside of Austin, Texas is SUPER conservative and religious, and outside of Denver, Co is either conservative or super liberal, depending on where you're standing.  Good luck!"

findapath,3dabpe,gob_franklyn_bluth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:59:16 2015 UTC,"Most schools highly discourage working during your 1L year. It's the most important year for on campus interviews with the larger firms near your school. The first semester in particular because that will be the only grades you will have to show employers before the summer. The most important thing to do while in law school is to meet professionals in the area you want to practice and to gain experience regardless of the pay. It sounds terrible from a financial perspective, I know. But that first year is so important to get good grades for future employers. After the first year, you can normally fit in work part time. Most professors ease up on the Socratic method and you get more used to reading cases and identifying issues.   The Stafford and Graduate plus loans are just the federal student loans. You can always get a private student loan from a credit union, bank or other lender. The best thing about these loans is that you can consolidate after graduation and pay as a percentage of your income rather than as fixed dollar amount. Some schools will have public interest loan forgiveness and some agencies will pay your loans after working with them for a certain number of years.   As far as existing debts, I would calculate out how much they would total to in a given year and try to account for that as part of the amount you pay in student loans.   Look into grants. Several schools will have links on their financial aid pages.   Don't be afraid to look at private schools because of their tuition costs. Those are the schools that have the most scholarship money. Also apply to multiple schools, if you get into more than one you can sort of play them against each other in a way. If there two similarly ranked schools that you feel would fit you equally well you can ask for more scholarship at one to choose them.

Think about where you'd want to land immediately after law school, and figure out which schools can you get you there, and where you have to rank in the class to get that position.  If you've done all that homework, what to do should be clearer. You can take significant loans out for law school, so that should help.

So: major in biotech stuff, pick up an appropriate minor if you can find one. Take advantage of your university's language services to find opportunities to use/improve your ASL.

I'd assume there are countries there that allow for transferrable licenses - so I'd research into that.   And the question you posed is casting a huge net, there are countless jobs that allow you to work overseas and pay well.

findapath,3d8s9w,kyniver,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who always wanted to be a dentist, became a dentist, but after years and years of doing dentistry she now finds life boring. She looks at teeth everyday and practically does the same thing all the time; the scary part for her is that she knows she will be doing this exact same thing for another 50 years before she retires. She loves dentistry, but does she want to do the same thing for her entire life? The answer is obviously no. People usually have multiple careers in their life so you really shouldn't think of any one decision as being 'forever'. Honestly, you've never been a dentist so it's unlikely that you know for sure that's what you want to do either.   What we're doing here is 'guessing' obviously. I would focus a whole lot less on the money and task you do with your occupation (because that can always get boring after decades, and it's rare in this generation to stick with one career) and focus more on the type of lifestyle you want. Again, your question is rather vague so it's hard to not respond with a vague answer. The 'why' is often way more important than the 'what' which seems to be what you're looking for.   This might make matters worse, but also don't forget that you'll change, Eastern Europe will change, jobs will change, etc. After spending your 20th summer vacation in Eastern Europe, will you still feel the same way you do now about it? I think it's important to understand what kind of life do you want to have and why.  The answer will rarely be 'have lots of money' or 'have lots of holidays'. I can attest to the fact that if you genuinely enjoy what you do, you're always on holiday and don't need to spend money/go on a plane to have one."

Staying idealistic as we get older is one of the toughest but most beautiful things.   I don't seem to follow where your problem is - it seems to me you've got it all sorted out. Pick any occupation that allows you to use your hands and study business, entrepreneurship, and direct response marketing on the side. Graduate with your degree, work in a company for a bit to save some money while building a side-project that will eventually lead you to Eastern Europe or allow you to work freely anywhere (internet business). Once your side project becomes large enough to sustain your finances, dedicate yourself to it full-time, and build the business (entrepreneurial aspect) to the point where you can use the money to buy your freedom or create jobs in Eastern Europe.   That's not necessarily not dentistry, at this point I almost feel the occupation matters little. What's most important is that irregardless of your day job you are building the skills on the side needed to be an entrepreneur. Only as a entrepreneur do you have freedom as close as freedom can be (you still have a boss, your customers)."

Your life will be much easier if you are working for a nice doctor.  Daily basis: Get into work, check all the equipment, check insurance eligibility, start seeing patients (get them in the room, get histories and take vitals, prep them for any procedures), complete all paperwork and referrals for patients, inform patients of lab or imaging results, prep schedule and charts for the next day, answer all the phone calls, faxes, walk-ins, etc.  You will have more responsibilities as a nurse but you will also get paid big bucks.

findapath,3d4lt3,TheAngryBrigade,2,Mon Jul 13 14:05:28 2015 UTC,"I'd start by thinking about what specifically is making you unhappy in your work.    Is it because your role hasn't changed and your learning has plateaued? Is it an industry you don't believe in?   If the former, Maybe try asking for more, or something different. The worst they can say is no, and if they do, it says something about your perceived worth. If the latter, maybe find someone in your Geo that is doing something similar but in a different industry. Working for, and learning through the mistakes of others is a very quick, and risk averse approach to personal development.  I think the feeling of anxiety you're getting is most likely due to a lack of randomness in your life. It's like you've reached a ceiling and you want to punch through it but maybe don't know the best way to take that jump. Most of the choices you have in front of you are risks, pick the risk with the highest reward at a risk level you can bounce back from if things go wrong.  If you're feeling anxious about things while working for someone else, going out on your own is that exact feeling, 10x. Your faith in yourself will constantly be tested, and there isn't anyone to lean on for a pep talk. Don't do this unless you can mitigate the financial strain. ie. get an investor"

He is a smart individual but very arrogant.  He wants to put the burden on everyone else, and he feels he is too good to be behind a counter, or handling customers, or being in the store.  This leads to things not getting done, being pushed back, and no direct clear path on certain issues. The owners often fight between eachother because one handles the operations and works at least 10 hours a day.  And the other one does not want to march to the beat of anybody elses drum.  It comes down to me hoping he would change, but its been an on going dilemma.  Basically one of the owners is ruining how I feel about moving forward in the business, because I cannot rely on him, nor do I respect him.  And now its starting to get to me, because I;m feeling the stress as the business is growing with no help in establishing procedures and creating a model that future stores could run by.

findapath,3d33fs,qiezidaifuer,0,Mon Jul 13 03:26:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can be issued a degree from a different country.   However, the requirements will vary country to country. Since you're in Australia, there are many things you have to look at. Since Australia and Canada were both part of the British Empire, a lot of things are transferable, HOWEVER not everything.   A lot of things will change, so you'll have to research the following:  1) Visa options - your visa will have to change unless you have dual citizenship. Some student visas do not allow you to work. Some work visas do not allow you to be a student. You must check your visa/residency options. Do student visas require you to have been a resident for X amount of years? Does your current visa cover both student and work? Is there a visa option that covers both? Can you work with a student visa? Do you have to renew it every year? Prove your a student every year?   2) Course transferring/testing - you may have to register as an international student, but this again depends on your visa and post secondary qualifications. Typically international students will end up having to pay double the tuition a domestic student does. How will your high school courses transfer? Since you've been out of school for 6 years, do they even qualify to be used to apply? Do you have to take separate testing instead? Do you have to attend a separate institution before doing so?   3) financials - Do you qualify for student loans if you cannot afford it as you are considered a mature student? Do you qualify for loans as an international student/with your specific type of visa? Some countries do not allow international/foreigners to receive loans out of fear they won't be paid back. Make sure your visa/residency status does not conflict. Do you have enough money for books, tuition, living if you don't qualify for student loans?   Those are the 3 most important things to look at before you consider which degree stream to look at. It you're not a citizen of Australia yet, it will be very difficult/complex when it comes to residency. Make sure everything is documented and save whatever utility bills you have as far as you can, as many as you can."
findapath,3d33fs,RossumEcho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:40:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the response, it's really appreciated.  I am not an Australian citizen and as far as I can see will not be at any time in the future. After my year and a half here (I am on a simple working holiday visa) I will likely leave Australia, possibly never to return, and as such will likely be the case with the next country I visit.   I had hoped that I could do something completely or as much as possible online, because if it is done at an Australian institution, what happens if I leave the country and can't go back?   I suppose what I am saying is, how can I complete any kind of education without being tied to a particular country in that time? Is it possible?"
findapath,3d33fs,RossumEcho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:58:11 2015 UTC,"Well you'd have to look for a school that is exclusively online if you are looking for a Bachelors, or a very specific degree. Most accredited home based Unis will only have a few courses available online, some have one or two degrees available though.  So am exclusive online University would be your only choice outside of those. They can be costly though or sketchy, or not that reputable (University of Phoenix).  You could go for diploma or certification though through technical schools and some community colleges, however they may not translate well country to country."

Much easier than changing majors and potentially having to do many more classes to get there.  Are you set on pursuing a job in healthcare?  It's a diverse field and not every job requires as much schooling as does, say, pharmacy (although most will require some supplemental training either with, or regardless of your undergrad).

Accounting or finance might be worth it only if you can do well in those courses and/or get an internship. The work experience will be very very important. Have you considered anything within statistics or math? Those are great undergraduate fields that lead to jobs.    There might also be post bacc programs that can help your chances in pharmacy. I know several post bacc programs for medical schools that helped my friends get in after they were rejected the first time.

When you decide to step outside your comfort zone and see what the rest of the world is like, something magical and innate happens to you.   I would say figure out what you want to study by breaking down your talents, likes and dislikes because it's never too late to travel someplace. If you're interested in going to Japan, maybe you can look into a teaching program and also take a side job as a English tutor or translator while you're out there.

I suppose I should have included in my original post that I've been into Japan and it's culture from a very, very young age - I had my first Japanese lessons when I was 10 years old, hosted a Japanese exchange student in high school, worked at a Japanese marketplace right out of high school, etc. It's more that I'm basing my career around Japan, as opposed to involving Japan within my career, if that makes sense.

If so, from my experience applying to quite a few Japanese companies, it seems like most 新卒 positions don't look at your major unless it's in the sciences.  If you're looking outside of Japan, though, you might want to consider something aside or alongside International Business.  I wasn't a business major in university, but our business school didn't recommend just majoring in int'l since it's pretty broad, and suggested you double up or choose another major that will give you more specific skills.  As for JLPT: Again, just from my experience, most Japanese interviewers (both in the U.S. and Japan) didn't know anything about the test and most times I had to explain my abilities and inabilities in the language.  However, it'll probably be for your own benefit to at least pass N2, and also N1 especially if you want to go into translation. Since you have an AA, you'll have about 2 more years in school to get your bachelors, right?  Unless you'll be able to put in a lot of time to improve your Japanese while finishing up school, I don't think it'd be a bad idea to take intensive language courses now.  You could also take these classes after you complete your BA.  Good luck!!"
findapath,3d1htu,kintsukuroisparrow,2,Sun Jul 12 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"I have an art degree, worked in the arts for many years as a teacher, artist, and fabricator. I did a lot of scenic work for money though the years. Have many friends that do fibers, art, various other crafts as a job/career. here's my initial off the cuff advice:  It's excellent that you've figured out your passion. Most people never do. Now...  A: You're going to have to work a lot harder than it sounds like you currently are. Starting your own business is no joke. Get the highest paying job you can, and every moment you aren't at work, work on your new business. The highest paying job you can get is probably not arts related, especially in Augusta (I grew up in upstate SC). A liberal arts degree isn't going to help you make more money, most likely. a technical degree will help a lot more, especially in the south. You could finish that in a year and a half.   B) keep your new higher paying full time job until your business is supporting itself  C) create a product with your fibers skills and start marketing the hell out of it. It sounds like you've started, but ramp it up. Make an etsy store, sell it locally everywhere you can, get it in front of the eyes of other craft networks online, other towns nearby, etc.   good luck!"
findapath,3d1htu,trianguloid,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:37:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the advice!   I've thought often about starting a business or an etsy shop, but can never seem to settle on what that will focus on. I'll be honest, I know I need to work harder on independent ventures, & that all of the hang ups with it are strictly internal, not the least of which are indecisiveness & over-analyzing things.   In your personal experiences & observations with friends in the field, do you have any good insight on how to make that choice of what medium, service, or product to pursue? I always seem to get caught up in an internal circle of profit margins, marketability, & saturation of the market that almost always end up with me trying to discover something else. Couple that with my compulsive need for variety (another personal problem, I know), it never ends in a tangible, sellable thing or service.  So far as the highest paying job, I am sadly well aware that I probably won't find anything with a significant income in the arts field here. I was very excited for the shearing because the demand is very high in the Southeast (I'm learning from one of only three notable shearers in the region), but being at a point to make that a business will take quite a bit more practice. And though I know it really comes down to keeping myself disciplined outside of work hours, regardless of discipline, I've found that my creativity suffers when I work an office type job, so I am holding out hope for something that either fosters a creative environment (an example, I applied for a project manager position at a local design house that would have surrounded me with creatives) or offers more freedoms (like the real estate idea). Coming from the same general area of the South, did you have any technical degrees in mind in your suggestion that you think I might want to look into?"
findapath,3d1htu,trianguloid,3,Sun Jul 12 21:19:58 2015 UTC,"It's a toss-up. Jobs in the creative industry often have a tendency to kill a person's desire to make work after work. But they can have the opposite effect. That part is up to you, in your personality. I can't answer that. I will say that working for 20k a year watching TV is going to get you nowhere. For some people what works is to have a job teaching, which gives you access to equipment and puts you in a creative environment. for some people, a job that gives you a lot of money/freedom and job flex so you have time and resources to make your own work outside of work is better.   For both what job to do, and what to do with craft skills, the answer is the same: pick something and go with it. I also have struggled with indecision, and it's a killer. As someone older than you that flip-flopped for too long, just pick something and do it. Do it all the time and to the best of your ability. You won't find out what kind of things you want to make by thinking about it, You'll figure it out by doing it. start making things. keep making the things you like. quit making the things you dont. When you find something you like making, make a version of it that sells and start an etsy store. Educate yourself on current trends, pay attention to what sells, and make your own thing. don't copy, but be aware of what sells and what doesnt.   Go to a community college and meet with a career advisor, they will be able to give you a better idea what degree will suit you and help you find a job than I can.   good luck"

How do you make money with no degree, and not have a ton of skills(idk who you are, you could be Da Vinci!)? You get a part time job, go back to your parents, and go to trade school. Learn a trade:plumbing, electrician, locksmith. Make more money once you get a full time job. While you're doing that, YOURE IN SAVE MODE. Don't buy bullshit you don't need. Don't do drugs, not because they are bad(talking recreational shit), but because they're expensive. Go to target clearance section. Then once you pay your debt, GO BACK TO COLLEGE. Work part time to keep the flow of money in. If college doesn't work out, or you fail again, GO BACK TO YOUR TRADE. If it does, great go on and get a job and live well. This life is about enjoying what you do, but if you don't make money, you really can't do shit. All those people who have liberal arts degrees who don't make a lot of money might say they're happy, but what happens when they get sick of the arts? Nothing, because they don't have the green.

findapath,3cysnc,femtobarn-1,7,Sun Jul 12 00:32:21 2015 UTC,From what I've read a physics degree is pretty diverse career wise. From the looks of it judging by your extra curriculars you could easily get into some sort of finance or managing. With your degree you're basically over qualified from a tech standpoint and you'll still make a great living if you apply yourself. You could even go into law or medical. Lots of options outside of research.
findapath,3cysnc,deadhead6391,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:57:07 2015 UTC,"I've heard that a physics degree can lead to a lot of careers too, but the more I research, the more it looks like I need grad school to do many things. (Although I certainly hope I'm wrong.)  Finance doesn't interest me, although I've heard Wall Street hires physicists for modeling purposes and pays them tons. I just don't have any interest in that. I don't know anything about managing, but I'll look into it. I've considered law school and becoming a lawyer for the ACLU or something similar. But I think I'd be miserable in law school, so it's not something I want to spend money on unless I have a huge change of heart.  A career in the medical field DOES interest me, but I'm not sure what's out there that I could do with a Physics BS. I looked into medical physics, but you need at least a Masters and there's a bottleneck in the field right now that makes it hard to get a job without a PhD.

If you find satisfaction in the challenge of managing interpersonal logistics, juggling a lot of balls, meeting deadlines, etc., you might actually really enjoy being a lawyer.  It would definitely be a good idea though, especially with the tough job market for lawyers nowadays, to get some exposure to the legal field and see whether you like it before committing to the enormous expense of law school.

findapath,3cysnc,duuuh,2,Mon Jul 13 16:53:39 2015 UTC,"First, congratulations on the physics degree. It's not easy and you should be proud of yourself.  I wouldn't worry about the 'stress' of grad school if it's otherwise what you want to do. Trust me here; the stress of a 'real' job is way higher than grad school or a B.Sc. This is something you're going to have to learn to deal with. (From what you say it sounds like in your case a lot of that pressure is self-imposed, which doesn't necessarily help much, but it may help you to manage it somewhat.)  There's a difference between 'physcis just isn't something I'm naturally good at' and 'I have met people who are better at physics than I am'. You don't need to be the best at the world in something to pursue it. (Whatever else you choose: you won't be the best in the world at that either.) You need to be good enough to be able to do the work and (very importantly) enjoy doing the work. If you don't enjoy the work because you see people around who are better than you are that's a problem you need to deal with regardless of your field.   If you like the modelling, but don't like 'finance', there's a bunch of data science (/r/datascience) stuff that's hot right now that models other stuff. Much of it is probably more boring that finance (which ad to show on a web page) but some of it (self-driving cars) is way cool. However, there's some programming involved (usually) so it might not be a great fit. Just throwing it out there.  I'd strongly consider applying for this: http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21637341-richard-casement-internship  Pick a book by Mary Roach and read it. They're good, so it will be worthwhile in it's own right. Could you see yourself writing something like that? (It's a hard path to get to, but it sounds like something you might be interested in.)  On to what may be more important advice.   Figuring out what to do after a B.Sc. in Physics (or Math, or anything without a clear career path) is stressful. But it's a great degree and you can do all sorts of things. But the lack of clarity into what the future holds is totally normal.  Life is not a controlled experiment. You will never know what the other path held. It might have been great; it might have been awful. You'll never know. Make informed decisions and be happy with your choice. It's not the like alternative helps with anything.  It's a rare mistake that isn't fixable. You'll mess up some things and regret that, but it's OK. You can almost always fix things. Take the time to make good decisions, but if they're wrong, change your course. It's totally doable.   Best of luck and congratulations again on the degree."
findapath,3cysnc,duuuh,2,Sun Jul 12 14:58:00 2015 UTC,"This was exactly what I needed to hear. Thank you so, so much.  A lot of my stress is definitely self-imposed. I feel like I was much more successful at age 18 (when I was doing more meaningful research, getting into good colleges, and presented at a national conference) and 3 years later I feel like I'm just floundering. Another huge mental hurdle I'm trying to deal with is Imposter Syndrome-- I'm afraid I'm really not good enough at physics and that people are going to realize that when I'm either applying to grad school or looking for jobs. I'm trying to work through these things, but the closer I get to graduating and needing to figure out what's next, the more stressed they make me.  That internship looks fantastic and I will definitely apply for it next year. I think another part of my problem is I've had the same physics-related job for five years now. I haven't looked elsewhere because it pays decently and looks great on a resume. But I feel like I should try something new to see if it helps me figure out what I want to do.  I had never heard of Mary Roach, but her books look great! I could definitely see myself writing something like that. But writing books seems like something I'd have to start as a side project while I'm working somewhere-- I doubt you make enough to live off right off the bat. I actually really like teaching people about science-- especially explaining difficult concepts so that the average person can understand them. I'll look into this more.  Thank you again, your comment was very helpful and reassuring."
findapath,3cysnc,duuuh,2,Sun Jul 12 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words. I'm glad you found my post helpful.  You feel like you were more successful at 18 because you were more successful at 18, at least in relative terms. At 18 your immediate peers were mostly much less smart than you are and much less hard working than you are. At 21 - not so much. Selection pressure has changed who your peers are and they're a smarter and more hard working bunch than they used to be.   That is a great thing. You want to hang out with smart people who get things done. If you don't feel like you're out of your depth from time to time you need to start looking for a better group to hang out with. Every time you're hanging with 'X' and thinking, 'that person is way better at something than I am' you're thinking that because - in part - you're learning something from 'X'. Do more of it, not less. (Other people - from time to time - also look  at you as 'X'. They don't say so, because it's not the type of thing people typically say to each other, but it happens.)"

I think my plan for now is to see how my physics classes go this fall and continue exploring potential careers outside of physics. I don't want to take grad school off the table quite yet, but I want to make sure I have ideas for what I can do if I decide not to go right away."

Physics degrees typically focus on abstract thoughts and problem solving, which is desired in almost any job! The bad news is your cover letters, resume, etc. will have to really sell these qualities, since you may not have direct knowledge in other things. A friend of mine got his BS in physics, started at a great grad school (not sure if he is still there), and within two years he was a senior Financial Analyst. If you like finance you should be able to find work somewhere, but again you will have to sell the qualities and skills (non-physics) you learned. I mention finance, because you mentioned managing budgets, meetings, and people. If finance is a route you might want to pursue, then that experience is extremely valuable and pertinent.

Unfortunately, only you really know your skills and interests. There isn't really a typical not 9-to-5 where you can be free and move around a lot and still make a living. Or everyone would be doing it. You'll have to examine what you can do, what you like to do, and what of those things someone will pay you to do.   Striking out on your own is going to be difficult though, because marketing is key, and that doesn't sound like something you want to do."

People behave a certain way, and she's supposed to behave a certain way. It's not as taxing for her. Maybe you could use your Cog Sci to go into therapy of some sort (with an advanced degree).   If you went into practice for yourself, you would still have to do some self-marketing, but at some point you'd build up a client base and a steady stream of referrals to deal with attrition.   Anything but a typical 9-5 is going to be hard. If you really really want to go into research, then I would encourage you to really look into it. But yes, it is hard. Anything that makes you successful is going to be hard; that effort you put above and beyond is what makes you successful."

After graduating was in the same boat, but when I lost my job had to find work in general. Ended up interviewing with a temp agency in the midst of the job search, wound up with others in a temp-to-hire situation in group life insurance. Started last October, got fully hired on in February. With this in mind;  1) If you're having a hard time finding legitimate entry level positions in general, not just within Public History, I'd look into temp agencies. Plenty of pro's; it's essentially another job search in the background as you pound pavement, there are legitimate opportunities, and some have training resources as well. Main con is pay; at least in my scenario, it was low and non-negotiable. When I got hired on, it was higher paid and benefits but still non-negotiable and still lower than the average salary for a college grad.  2) The private sector in general can actually provide plenty of great professional development. Sometimes you have to think skills vs field. Thanks to this job I have professional research, analysis, communication, and software skills prior I either did not have or did not have a way to prove.   Now I'm looking for other opportunities, but that is not to say I have not benefited from the professional development I have gained so far.  TL;DR: Graduated liberal arts, stuck around sub-shop job, job closed, became a temp, worked out well. Consider temping or other opportunities in the private sector in general."

I tried to apply to museums, archives, or anything history related but most are volunteer opportunities or non-history related positions (accounting, management, etc).   From my experience, if you do want to find a job in archives and collections, you need to have a background in library science. History won't cut it.   It's a difficult world for history majors. If you wish to stay in the field, try joining an association and participate in committees. Maybe write a book review or start a history related side project like writing historical fiction (see Dead Lands by Benjamin Percy). That's what I did (still working on the historical fiction) but I'm still stuck with a single part time job. When I put my published reviews and volunteer experience, however, I had a significant increase of interviews. From one or two interviews a year to eight.   I would recommend looking at https://www.aimusa.com/articles/where_to_find_library_jobs.php. Lots of federal, academic, and history related listings that will help pay for your MA. Or indeed.com.

You'll have to attend months of classes to earn your red card (in the US). Getting in is easier with a degree, and even if you don't have one, you'll get more classroom time than a 4 year degree in a career, and going through any fire academy and your basic classes is almost a year (Firefighter 1&2, EMT-B, Hazmat awareness and ops, more depending on which organization you work for) before most big departments (like the BLM, or CalFire) will let you respond to an emergency.  On top of that there's a dress code. Granted it usually isn't much in station (department shirt, black pants, black belt, black footwear, department jacket, department hats, department approved gloves, glasses, etc.). BUT you will constantly be checking and cleaning your wildland gear to ensure its good to go, because it could be what helps save your ass in a tough spot.   Also making 50K a year without a college degree is going to be really hard in the current economy. I know a firefighter in another county who has a masters in engineering and had to get a job in retail until he can get back into fire or engineering. A lot of guys with 4 year degrees get rejected from the department they apply for and work at some retail joint, scraping together enough to live and sustain themselves until the next round of hiring, possibly years away. I know you want something financially secure and steady, but it's hard to accomplish in the fire service with no college education and no experience.

I make myself save by having a set amount of my paycheck direct deposited into a separate account at a completely different bank.

That way I'm not tempted to spend it and even if I am I would actually have to go to the bank to get the funds out.

findapath,3cvf42,Sete_Sois,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:50:51 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting idea about the hospital work. My university has some similar positions in the sense that they seem to be very different from typical corporate IT work. For example, there was recently a programming job available working closely with ecology research scientists in order to help make sense of the data they generate. They pay less than corporate IT jobs, but I suspect that they are also potentially more rewarding (helping people, helping push science forward, etc).  Have you done any work so far that might be related to getting into IT? Would you consider going to school to get a Computer Science degree?  How about a programming boot camp?  Check out this article.  I'm not sure if all of this will relate to your current position, but here is how I started my career in IT without a degree and without too much previous formal work experience. First, I completely immersed myself in programming and things like Unix and Linux as a hobby all throughout high school (I've been a computer nerd since I was in elementary school). Then, after high school I leveraged that knowledge to pick up about two years worth of mostly ""under the table"" jobs, writing code and configuring Linux servers for small, local companies. Then, I advertised that experience on my resume as being much more formal than it actually was in order to get into bigger, more formal corporations (first Verizon ($50k at age 19), then PricewaterhouseCoopers ($110k at age 25), and finally JP Morgan Chase ($100k at age 27)). It also helped getting really good references from those first small, local companies that I worked for and using that experience to litter my resume with lots of the hot ""keywords"" that the technical recruiters were, and still are, always scanning for. I never had any shortage of technical recruiters calling me up after they found my resume on job boards like Monster, Dice, CareerBuilder, etc.  Hope this helps."

I really don't have the drive (nor the money) for a four year degree at this point. i think a two year degree or certicates would be more feasible in terms of time and money. I'm not looking to go crazy high up, just something stable.   That bootcamp stuff sounds really good. Almost TOO good to be true to be honest. I went to trade school and it was really worth it. I had no problem landing a job right out of school. In fact I'm the most successful pharmacy tech student they've had because I have incredible drive and superb work ethic.  Let me get this straight; if I attend the coding bootcamp (in as little as 12 weeks), i can potentially land an ENTRY level job that makes 50k, with no college degree."

findapath,3cukbs,lurkersayshello,2,Fri Jul 10 22:08:25 2015 UTC,"Sociology? Psychology? You will (hopefully) have a class on SPSS or Python, but that is really the extent that I have seen of Social Science programming.   What do you want to do? Yes, you have interests in understanding life, however to apply this to practice is a much different thing. Philosophy is a practical major in that it does teach you argumentative skills and logic as well as teaching you how to write well. Considering those skills impractical is a gross misrepresentation of what skillsets you will learn from a philosophy degree. You have a distinct interest in something that is absolutely fucking useful for the professional world."
findapath,3cukbs,sirziggy,2,Fri Jul 10 23:50:00 2015 UTC,"It may look like that on the surface, but the major itself is very versatile because of the skills it provides you. You could go start your own business or go be an actress. Academia is a choice, though it isn't the only choice. Just keep that in mind.  Studying these questions is a great start! Think about how you would apply these questions to something more specific. You could go to graduate school and study these questions- PhDs are research degrees after all.   Something that is similar to cognitive science is probably Psychology. Though an undergraduate degree alone isn't enough to become a therapist (if that is within the realm of possibility for you), you will be learning about all of those questions. Sociology might be the next closest thing, followed by Anthropology.   Getting down to the specifics is really important for finding out what you can potentially do in your professional life. One of my supervisors has no degree, but here talent is being bilingual in Spanish and English, which landed her many jobs in university settings including the position she has now as director of special programs. Apply this kind of thinking towards your writing and critical thinking, since you did mention they were your strong suits. Writing is a wonderful skill to have as a person on the job market."
findapath,3cukbs,sirziggy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:32:49 2015 UTC,"A philosophy degree will only directly qualify you for further education and academia, but a philosophy degree combined with good extracurriculars, high grades, and perhaps a second major can open all sorts of doors. Wall St. trading firms, large tech companies, consulting firms, and the like often hire high-performing humanities majors.  I think if you love philosophy you should study it, but if you don't plan to be an academic you should also study other things. You have already discovered the joy and power of rigorous logical argumentation. That type of thinking is what drew me to philosophy as much as the subject matter, and that type of thinking will be useful in all sorts of fields. Studying philosophy will improve your critical reading, analytical thinking, writing, and debating skills. These are life skills, far from useless anywhere you go.   Some ideas: double philosophy with business, go into management. Plenty of jobs, probably not totally fascinating but a manager with a solid conception of justice would be nice to work for. Does you school let you design your own major? One of my friends designed a cog-sci major for himself, made of classes from philosophy, psychology, linguistics, and computer science.   The upshot of all this is that philosophy is great for self-starters and people who are good at learning other things. Philosophy shortens the learning curve on most other thinking-related skills. You're only 19, you have a lot of time to figure out what you actually want to do. If you're a good student and put up some volunteer work as well, philosophy won't stop you from getting a job doing whatever you want. For context: I graduated with philosophy in 2013 and the only thing it's qualified me to do is be a mod of /r/Existentialism (come check it out!) I currently sell high-end alcohol and my goal is to become a wine and/or whisk(e)y distributor. I still read philosophical articles almost every day."

findapath,3cr4fk,reeLAX,3,Fri Jul 10 02:39:57 2015 UTC,"The thing that a lot of people won't  understand from the transition from college to workforce is that it isn't all perfect from A to Z how college programs are. Some jobs you might be doing every single day what you learned from 9 semesters of your major. Some jobs might be more or less. Talk to people who are working in accounting, talk to a lot of people in the industry and see what they say. It might not be as difficult as it seems. Accounting is a very flexible major. You can work for big corporation or work for small booming businesses. There's probably more to it than just the shitty coursework. Edit: have you interned at all? The internships could make it clear what you are getting into  EDITEDIT: I'm like your opposite, I'm leaving chemistry/biochemistry for IT/Accounting hahah"
findapath,3cr4fk,Stosstruppe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:50:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Haha that's quite a coincidence. If you don't mind me asking, why are you leaving chem/biochem?  Yeah, I know that a lot of times that what you do in your daily work at a job may not necessarily reflect a lot of what you've learned in college. Which is what keeps me thinking that it may be worth sticking it out the last year and just giving it a chance in the real world.  I love the flexibility that Accounting allows, because like you said you really can go across all different industries. You don't necessarily have to stick to a CPA firm or somewhere that strictly business related. I feel though that if I say were involved in a science or engineering firm, that I'd be much more interested being the one doing the research, testing, and such, than doing the financial work.  I unfortunately haven't done an internship yet, which is completely my fault. I've let my disinterest in classes deter me from really putting in the effort to see what it's like outside of class."
findapath,3cr4fk,Stosstruppe,2,Fri Jul 10 03:22:36 2015 UTC,"For the amount of hard work, and studying you have to do to keep up in chemistry, it doesn't really payoff much after the undergrad, you have to jump into a masters or even look to get a Ph.D before you get actual decent paying jobs. Until you get the masters you basically are just working in a lab for around $15 dollars an hour, more times than not no benefits, no full time status, etc. There just simply is no money in chemistry, however, Chemical Engineer is another whole beast. You get paid well and get amazing job security in chemE. Another reason is that, I just simply couldn't talk about my major at all with other people because there simply isn't much to talk about. I hear cool stuff from social workers, engineers, computer programmers, etc, but it's difficult to have a discussion about chemistry/biology. Also I don't know if you find accounting tedious work or not but boy, stoichiometry and calorimetry is complete ass to work on."
findapath,3cr4fk,Stosstruppe,2,Fri Jul 10 15:57:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true. Having a PhD is pretty much essential in order to hopefully eventually do any research that you may be interested in. Unless of course you are lucky enough to get involved with someone that is already researching it while you're working towards the PhD, but that's a crap shoot."
findapath,3cr4fk,projectfarman,2,Fri Jul 10 17:05:04 2015 UTC,"If you still have a strong interest in the sciences, I'd probably recommend either ChemE or Medical Technology (basically working in a medical lab but get paid and have better benefits of working in one). But honestly, I'm 22 years old as well. I spend the last 3 years figuring out what I want to do. I'd rather do that than spend 4 years getting a major that doesn't suit me. I went from culinary, to linguistics, to computer science, to nutrition, to biochem, and now I'm sticking to a BA in Computer Information Systems. Why? It interests me and I know there's money and flexibility in it."

You are planning on leaving this job to work in a smaller company, a less stressful job... But it's not something you love is it? It doesnt seem it will bring you more happiness, just some more down time and less money.  If I were you, I would start planning for a new career path while taking advantage of the money you are making right now. Since you cant rely on your family, start saving for your future and plan for something else. Something better.  And think of your current job as a step towards what will come next. It might help you see the light at the end of the tunnel and stress less.  Still, if you are really really stressed, quit. High stress is horrible, you dont have to go through that, specially when you have an alternative.  And dont worry so much about what your parents, or anyone else, thinks. It is your life and your happiness. Take care of yourself!"

While you're planning your next move, however, I would suggest you save every spare cent you earn.  Be ruthless and aggressive in slashing your costs.  It shouldn't take terribly long for you to earn a nice amount of ""fuck-you money"" - money that can buy your freedom that, when you're ready, you can quit your job.  From there, you have the chance to go back to school with no debt, or you can travel and gain some perspective, or you can even move into a sort of semi-retirement while working a low-salary (and low stress) job elsewhere.  I feel naive asking, but are you sure that this promotion will lead to even more stress?  Have you gotten the chance to observe any colleagues working that role already?"

Take all the experience and money you can get, buy a nice car, maybe a house, and maybe start a family. THEN think about quitting to a less profitable job. Or maybe, just maybe, you can get so much experience that you can get a better job, with less hours and more pay.  Be honest with yourself, if you weren't working, what would you be doing? Drinking? Video games? Formulating plans for world domination? If it's not something you would love to do for the rest of your life, just go to work."

findapath,3cr0dh,Thats_Enterchangment,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:04:47 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I read your post last week and I came across it today and noticed no one replied. Your story sounds similar to mine. In the past 15 years or so, I have literally picked up and moved to a new spot. Have a college, but never any real idea on what to do for work. The difference between you and I is that I have no real obligations like you to support a family and a kid.  First, I want to tell you that I think your mentality on family first is admirable. It takes a lot of guts to put your family and your loved ones before your needs. Especially with the kind of lifestyle you had before having a family.   My advice to you is to figure out what your talents are, what you're interested in, and see if you can find a career that will align with your interests, so you don't drive yourself bat crazy working for a company or job that you hate. I think trying to find one job full-time with benefits will be better for you because it'll be a set of guaranteed hours, plus benefits for your family, and you'll have time after work to spend time with your family, which I consider the most important thing. Pretty much, you're going to have to settle down. Take baby steps toward finding a job that makes you somewhat happy and excited, get paid on the regular, allows you to save, and provide health benefits for you and the family. After you get your foot in the door and gain experience , I think you'll be able to see that it'll open more opportunities for you.  At the end of the day, as long as you put in the effort and be open minded, you'll eventually work your way up or find an opportunity elsewhere.   Best of luck to you and the family. Stay positive and keep your head up if things are slow. Always take advantage of the opportunities you find."
findapath,3cr0dh,jvslater,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:39:09 2015 UTC,"Hey, thank you for responding! I was really wondering if I posted this in the wrong thread for some advice.   I am really doing my best to live the family life best I can, I've spent enough time in that other lifestyle, it got kinda old after a decade or so.   I've been doing my best to figure out what my career options are that fit the criteria you talked about (they are really important to me as well).  Part of my problem is that I've always been a jack of all trades, master of none sort of person. I'm good at pretty much everything I put my mind to, but I'm not great at anything.  As for what I'm passionate about, the only thing I've ever been really passionate about is travel, and there is not much of a career in that. Everything else I've ever done has just been a job to me. With all the different work I've done, nothing has ever really lit a spark in me, and I'm starting to wonder if there's a problem with my mental outlook on the subject. Right now, I wouldn't care just working any job that I didn't dread going into every day and that satisfied my financial needs.   Now I realize I'm just whining instead of actively searching for an answer. I guess what it boils down to is that I've been lost for a really long time and just enjoyed wandering around the woods. Now that I'm sick of being lost, I'm finding that I have no idea where I want to go at all, but every direction sign I see is pointing to the wrong place."
findapath,3cr0dh,jvslater,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:31:45 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're trying to say. If it's any consolation, a lot of people don't necessarily figure out what they want to do in life in terms of a career. Some people just grow into one or was able to get their foot in the door somehow. All jobs, whether big or small, corporate or whatever, is going to suck, because it's always going to be work. At the end, I think if you find a job where a boss looks out for you and you get along with your coworkers, you'll be alright. At the same time, you should ALWAYS be looking for something. As long as you're working now, it wouldn't hurt to keep applying for jobs that interests you or the ones that you feel would be a great fit. Never pass up opportunities that'll not only pay you more, but also if it'll be beneficial for you in your career path.  You don't have to choose just one thing and that is going to be it. Now that you have a family support, I would say something stable with some job security may be more important now since it's now not only about you, but also your family. Plus, a few years experiences with one company can really open up a lot of doors for you in terms of a career path.  I wish you and your family the best. I don't think you should worry so much because you a few jobs that pay you $40K a year. And at the end of the day, if you can go to sleep knowing that you did the best you could to provide for you and your family, then you done all that you can and no one can take that away from you."

The hours are fairly light, the pay is pretty good, and if you're good at teaching, it might help to gain a fresh perspective on the industry by working with inexperienced people and showing them things you've learned.  I think it's good to use the knowledge you have until you can find something that really inspires you, but instead of day-to-day coding, you'd be in an instructive role.

Most LLBs end up competing for the valued corporat law jobs: unless you're interested in that kind of grind, I'd be cautious.

I majored in Geography with a similar feeling towards GIS.  One thing that I think uses relatively simply GIS (more appealing to me than the intense data management) is urban planning.  I would really look into those internships.  It's very human geography centered.  I am looking into them, but my education was VERY focused away from any human geography classes, so I think you'd be more competitive in that realm than many others.  It deals with economics and local politics.  They are very often paid, and having any GIS experience or talent is a huge plus (school experience counts), and they are government internships which can lead to pretty decent jobs.  So an avenue like that is both political science and geography.  I think that currently, a focus in GIS is going to make things easier to get decent pay grades right out of college, but that shouldn't be your only goal.  Keep poking around both subjects and try and find what some jobs in those fields are looking like, and what sounds fun.    Take all of what I said with a grain of salt though, as I just graduated college and am looking for positions and am having a lot of trouble here in Southern California.  Best of luck to you friend"

Good on you for having that figured out. It's also important to try things out and see what you like.  It doesn't always feel like you'd expect  I did get some decent experience during/after college, but I am trying to change fields now, and that leaves me with not a lot of relevant experience with what I'm trying now.

They met more than a few young adults who were working there for the summer, and who go back to their home state for college the rest of the year.  They were able to work outdoorsy adventure type jobs, with lots of interaction with travellers and tourists.  It's just, once you said ""like to be outdoors"" and ""live in Canada"", that experience popped into my head.  No, it's not a career per se, but it can get you experience in the field of adventure tourism, which may lead to a full-time job down the line.

While you're in school look into jobs at local gyms or your schools gym. You can usually get certified to teach a course with about a week long training course. This way you can see if teaching and leading people is something you would want to do.     I would also suggest volunteering at your local outdoor events to get a feel of what those would be like.

findapath,3cmt0x,osomabinsemen,2,Thu Jul 9 03:09:18 2015 UTC,"If you're unsure about your major or whether you want to pursue it as a career, I recommend anything that will let you get experience outside of stuff you do for class. If you major in something where you have to study 24/7 and then decide you don't want to pursue that field as a career, then you have an irrelevant degree and no experience. If you major in something where you have enough time to volunteer or lead a student organization or work a part-time job, then when you eventually pick a career to pursue, your degree may or may not be irrelevant, but at least you'll have done something outside of class. For a lot of jobs, employers care more about your work experience than about what you studied. Sure, if you want to be an engineer, you should major in engineering, but not everyone can be an engineer, and many fields are not nearly as rigidly major-to-job as engineering is. When I was recently on a hiring committee (hiring for a full-time white-collar job with health insurance and a pension), the candidate we were most impressed with majored in musical theater (the job has nothing to do with musical theater). I'm not saying do whatever and don't worry about it, I'm saying you're worrying too much about which classes to take and not enough about doing something, like literally anything, job-like outside of class. Even if it's in an obscure field, chances are there will be something of transferable value in it. In undergrad I worked with dead languages, and that helped me get a job because it demonstrated my ability to learn new software (I used speech analysis software, which I got asked about in job interviews), and because the guy I worked for gave me a good reference, and because it gave me something to talk about in job interviews other than ""well one time I did this class project...""  Anyway, I realize this doesn't help you pick a major or career, but my point is it's fine to not know yet. Just do stuff, and when you apply for jobs you want, figure out the elements of those activities that can be spun as relevant to the job you want."

Coding in this language is easy and it makes you feel like you're talking. Rails, Sinatra, all really easy to learn but hard to master. Its a fun journey so far and believe me RoR Developers make some $$$. the thing with ruby though is you need to know a lot of other languages along with it especially for rails.

You'll have time in college to get more depth, but start out with breadth.   Build a simple blog tutorial to start (there are tons), get familiar with mysql or sqlite and get your hands wet with a linux dev environment.   That should take you a month tops. Then you can start tinkering with specific areas. Maybe customize a wordpress blog yourself. Or maybe plug into some APIs like Twitter and see if you can make something interesting.   And then head over to odesk / upwork and do a little bit freelance work.

No matter your final area of study, each faculty will require that you have a general foundation of classes in a variety of subjects - distribution requirements.  So, if I were you, I would seek out a community college where you can take those distribution classes for a year or two.  University-level classes can be quite different from what you're used to in high school, so this would be a good-low risk way to try many things out before committing to a path.  However, that's the assumption that you're set on going to university for an undergrad.  Do you find the idea of a 1-2 year career college experience more appealing?  In that case, you have to be a bit more committed at the outset to what you'll be doing, because there's no variety beyond the training you'll receive.  However, the small time commitment and the prospect of a ready-made career in such a short amount of time is wonderfully appealing.  You'll probably have many programs to choose from, so try not to overthink it.  You're not likely to find your calling if you go this route, but you are likely to find a decent job which will give you career security and the financial freedom to seek out further education if you so choose.  Me?  I did the 2-year career diploma and then laddered those credits into an undergrad, which I completed part-time while working full-time.  Best of both worlds - for me anyway."

I suggested you look into a community college and for the your first year of college is to take a variety of courses. Maybe you will learn you prefer your interests more as a hobby. For example art, you may love it but you may not love 3 hours classes on the weekends. Maybe college level Stem classes are too hard.  Lastly, you can always major in two subjects, or minor in something you like. I know plenty of people who did STEM degrees for their career but also minors in spanish or history because the they enjoyed the subject."

I changed my mind a lot in the first few weeks of college. I opted for a general arts course (3 subjects equally in first year, drop one for the remainder), I'm in Ireland though so I'm not sure what your equivalent would be. Anyway, I ended up taking Geography and Anthropology, and falling in love with them. Social sciences are fascinating and not too difficult to start straight out of high school. With these subjects I got to follow my love of physical sciences (climate, ecology, geology, human biology) along with social sciences (culture, society, psychology, philosophy) and without any real maths emphasis and zero pure maths classes. Just something to think about, I think it might suit you :)"
findapath,3clg4e,ourblackenedsun,3,Wed Jul 8 20:46:11 2015 UTC,"Yooooo! This is me. Japanese major, went to Japan, taught for a bit, got into web dev, left. I'm currently a QA Analyst (tester) in NYC.  If you still want to go to Japan, do this, and it's not too late to begin teaching in the fall on this path:  Find a dispatch/eikaiwa school you want to work at. I had a decent experience with The Heart School, but I had friends who worked for Interac as well. Check out this site, or search around the Japan subreddit for more company options.  Eikaiwa is a shitty experience with shitty hours, but it's more 1 on 1 teaching. It's not for all, but you might find some luck down that path. Dispatch companies like Heart and Interac, meanwhile, are the same as JET, pretty much, just less official, more regional. They can also suck, but mileage often varies.  So, back to me!  Basically, I started searching for a job in Japan in June/July after graduating, got the job with Heart, started that September. I was stationed 2 hours north of Tokyo by train, had a bunch of really positive and life changing experiences, made good friends learned more and more Japanese, and learned I don't want to be a teacher, and I don't want to live in Japan. In my free time (there was a lot of it), I played some D&D with friends, and I started making websites. I teamed up with a friend, put together a big project from scratch over the course of about 5 months. In that experience, I gained experience as a designer, as a product manager, a writer, and most importantly, as a software tester.  I came back and landed a job as a Jr. QA Analyst at a marketing agency (with some help from my friend). I've been doing this now for over 3 years, and am trying to leverage myself towards a more managerial role in my current job.  And back to you!  So here's what you do, if you do go to Japan, or if you don't, either way: Hop on Codecademy, or another similar site. Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AngularJS (Angular could be replaced by Ruby or react or ember, probably some others, but Angular seems like a big deal). And I don't mean just complete the courses and hope for the best - you have to go make stuff. Create your resume site (populated with examples of your work), create a blog for a friend. Edit some wordpress templates. By the time you get to Angular, you will have everything you need to create a full front end experience from scratch. Leverage that graphic design work toward making some neat, eye catching stuff.  At that point, resume in hand, examples of your work, make some friends in the tech industry, go to meetups, find college friends, and keep your eyes open. Jobs are out there, and you may not be qualified for all of them on paper, but you'll probably get the interviews anyway.  PM me any time if you have more specific advice down the road, or reply here for now!"
findapath,3clg4e,joshuran,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:46:56 2015 UTC,"Hey, man. Thank you so much for the detailed response! It's a real relief to get some perspective on this stuff.   I didn't mention it above, but I still totally do want to live in Japan, if only for a little while. So I'm really glad you spoke to that! I was a bit discouraged about not getting into JET (pretty much all of my friends who applied have gotten in), but I'll definitely look into Heart, Interac, and Ohayo Sensei!  Another thing I was wondering was what you think the prospects of getting a non-teaching position in Japan might be, or if that's even advisable (given everything one hears about Japanese work culture). That's where I've run into a bit of a road block in my job search, given that I don't have many other marketable skills, at least of the technical variety.   (Apart from the management and leadership skills I've developed in my program coordinator and previous housing coordinator positions, I also have some background in live sound production, but that's a pretty specific skill set...)  I'd also love to hear your perspective on living in Japan. I've heard a few people, even friends who've demonstrably had amazing times in Japan, say that they wouldn't want to live there. I studied abroad in Kyoto for a semester, but I didn't quite reach that conclusion by the time my five months were up.  As far as the web side of things is concerned, I've been following plugging along with the HTML & CSS tracks on Codecademy and supplementing my lessons with readings from ""Learning Web Design, 4th Edition"". I'll keep working at it and start planning projects!  Thanks again!"
findapath,3clg4e,joshuran,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:05:02 2015 UTC,"Teaching English is probably the easiest way to get your foot in the door with Japan. Most of my friends over there who went on to other jobs started with a teaching position, stuck with it for a year, and eventually found work.  Here's a fun story: Michael-Christopher ""Koji"" Fox is currently the director of localization on Final Fantasy XIV. He started out in Japan some 10 years ago as a teacher who played Final Fantasy XI in his free time. A friend of a friend mentioned a job at SE to him, some grunt work translation and testing. He took it, and now he's got quite a resume. This guy was in the right place at the right time, and even though it's not exactly the most likely scenario for you to experience, it is something that was enabled in that scenario by living in Japan.  I can't answer your question about work culture. It's something that's changing rapidly in the country, and your mileage may vary. I know, anecdotally, that there are still a lot of problems. Women are criminally undervalued. Employees rarely allow themselves to leave the office for the day before their direct superiors. Work-life balance is hardly a consideration. These are attributes that are true of the schools as well. I also know there are some companies actively trying to subvert those inclinations.  As an ALT, it's likely that nobody really will expect much of you. If you show up for your job, make some work sheets, alleviate some work from the English teachers, nobody will give a crap what you do. This lets you devote more of your ""mental energy"" to other pursuits... maybe you can make a website for your school's computer club, and show students how to make their own.  I loved living in Japan for the food, the transportation, the people, and the sense of self-sustainment I achieved by living out there on my own. I had a good life, though a bit tight, money-wise. I'd love to go back to visit for 2-3 weeks as many of my American friends are still there.  What got me to leave:   Endless roadblocks to implementing process changes at my school Frustration with the way my co-workers openly acknowledged problems and then did nothing about them A feeling that my future felt stalled, that what I really wanted to be doing lay beyond Japan. Missed my friends and family at home. Perhaps superficial, but I didn't find anyone to date there. American or otherwise.   Check out /r/japanlife and /r/japan for more info on the day to day stuff of Japan. I really believe everyone should live in another country for some time, and Japan is a doozy of a choice. I ended up with a list of reasons to go home, but that doesn't invalidate the list of reasons that brought me there. No, I don't use my Japanese skill or my teaching experience in my current career. But... it's a great thing to have on my resume, it connects me to a lot of people with similar experiences, and it really did teach me a hell of a lot of stuff. If I was 22 again, faced with the same options, I would absolutely go again."

There are a lot of behind-the-scenes jobs, at least at my school which, I grant, is a lot bigger (student body-wise) than your school. You could try the registrar's office -- I know a lot of people there who have little to no interaction with students (processing transcripts, enrollment, etc.). When they answer phone calls it's usually from other staff members, who are generally a lot calmer than the students. Alternatively, I don't know if your school is big enough for this, but at my school the bigger academic departments (e.g. bio or psych as opposed to, like, demography or rhetoric) have staff who do little to no work with students: payroll and other HR stuff, curriculum planning (which courses should the department offer, during which semesters/years, based on enrollment history and other factors?), facilities management, event planning... The faculty can be just as brutal as the students, though (two of ours got in a fistfight right outside a classroom once, I swear to god). However, I work at a prestigious research university and I hear that the culture and personalities are kinder at small liberal arts colleges and community colleges (though I suppose they also have fewer jobs given their smaller size).  Edited to add: for most of these jobs I don't think they care much what you majored in, we've got people who studied psych, anthro, wildlife biology, musical theater, and creative writing."

I'm thinking of going for a Communications degree because it's the closest we have to an ""English"" major and, if not, I have friends in the business of technical writing who could probably help me out. :) I'm not a fan of some of our faculty, to be sure.

But whatever you do, do not just ""pass by"" high school doing the bare minimum to pass (I'm guessing 50%). it will sorely fuck up your chances of going to any type of post secondary (even some community college won't accept you).   If you feel right now that you wouldn't even want a post secondary education, I know many many people who sorely regret that decision when they get to the real world.   Of course it's up to you, but if you just do the minimum, and then realize you DO want/need to go to post secondary, guess what classes you have to pay more money to redo? All the graduating classes you had the ""bare minimum"" in. More time spent, more money wasted, all because you wanted to do the minimum.   Doing the minimum might as well be almost equivalent to failing. It closes more doors than it opens.

Probably any major you choose will have a few required classes that you are not interested in, and probably any job you pick will have both positives and negatives.

I just keep it as a personal hobby, but you might want to look into puzzle game companies like MindSnacks who make word game apps.  Lastly, the NLP job market is BOOMING but generally you are right-- the 'preferred' candidate is a computer programmer with an interest in linguistics, not a linguist with an interest in computer programming. That being said, I wouldn't discount how easy it is to get a working knowledge with Python. It might not make you a CS major, but six weeks of fun self-study with a focus on linguistic projects could help you understand if it's something you really want to pursue or not. Check out NLTK if you haven't already! SAS, Mitre, and Nuance are all companies that I know of that hire people with BAs in Linguistics.  It sounds like you aren't super into discourse analysis, which is my particular field, so unfortunately a lot of my knowledge isn't as helpful to you. :( I have a collection of about 100 companies that hire linguists though, so don't despair!

(The job is not overtly linguistics-related but it has things in common with linguistics such as qualitative problem-solving and learning complex systems of intricate rules.) Thirdly, I've served on hiring committees and no one really cared what people majored in -- our recent favorite candidate majored in musical theater with an emphasis in dance.  Regarding academic jobs, it does often take a long time (multiple post-docs/lecturer positions/visiting assistant professorships) to find a permanent job, and you should indeed have a backup plan.

findapath,3cckul,the_lay,6,Mon Jul 6 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"As someone trying to find their place in the music industry, the best advice I can give is this:  Network.  Network, network, and then go network some more.  That skill will be one of your best assets.  I've found that getting jobs in this field (as in most fields) is a matter of getting to know the right people.  Putting yourself out there is crucial.  Go talk to the sound guy at shows (though be sure to pick the right moment, won't win you any points to bother him while he's frantically checking which channel is feeding back).  Contact local production companies and explain your goals, and see if they'd be able to let you shadow or work as an assistant.  Another piece of advice is to attend gear shows and chat with company employees.  Inquire about internships or employment opportunities.  This comes from experience, as I did this and ended up interning at a well-known microphone company during my last semester of college.  It's tough (but not impossible) to find a paid internship in this field, but honestly it's all about getting your foot in the door.  That internship resulted in an offer for part time.  As far as software, Pro Tools is the ""industry standard"".  It's a good investment, especially since you may still be able to grab it for the student discount price of $300.  Other DAW's like Logic are pretty rampant too, but a majority of studios use PT.  Makes it easy to send whole sessions around to other studios.  If you have the funds and a Mac however, I'd invest in Logic as well."
findapath,3cckul,Hellion102792,2,Mon Jul 6 23:36:40 2015 UTC,"I am very close to an audio engineer who does front end web development for his day job. The audio stuff has a high barrier to entry (requires really expensive equipment and software not to mention countless hours) but has very little ROI, that's why he keeps his day job. He is well connected, all the industry pros like his work, it's just no artist/band client is ever serious enough to go through with a full project so he is stuck doing noncommittal singles and EPs. Then those same band clients break up soon after; what a waste. Even if he was a rather successful audio engineer, he'd only be making what he currently does as a web dev or perhaps just above. You have to love it A LOT and go into it knowing your clients are going to be immature (and often poor) artists. Successful people in the music industry are as common as albino dolphins. Many of them diversify their music/audio income by selling samples, plugins, being endorsed/sponsored and monetizing Youtube reviews, selling e-courses, etc. After seeing the incredibly low ROI for it, I wouldn't advise it. Obviously, if everyone followed my advice, there would be no Max Martins and Joey Sturgises, but if immediate-short term ROI is important to you, don't do it."

You seem very disciplined, organized and experienced so there are multiple jobs that you could potentially try for that might be easier / pay you more.  Question - does ""some college"" mean that you went to college but didn't graduate? Unfortunately you won't get a lot of credit for that.  So here are a few choices of jobs you could consider:   Office manager jobs - basically looking for highly organized people. Many are open to people without college degrees but adequate work experience. Jobs are like these: http://tapwage.com/channel/the-office-linchpin There are culinary director jobs at startups and companies that will allow you to leverage your skill, but these are at companies that tend to have better benefit packages and leave plans and more of a career path: http://tapwage.com/searchresult?SearchForm%5Bwhat%5D=culinary+director&SearchForm%5Bwhere%5D= You could also consider becoming a bank teller / personal banker. That may be a stretch since it forces you to start somewhat at a more entry-level position. If you can get a job directly as a personal banker accounting for your experience, you could potentially make a similar pay as you are making now, and have a career path that is more sustainable and more enjoyable. You probably have the people skills to be great at it. But being a bank teller at entry level won't work since it will take you back to the $30k mark that will be hard. if you like tech / startups / video games, you could try and get a job in customer experience / customer adoption. These are interesting jobs where you aren't doing sales but walking large customers through early adoption of a new technology. It's kinda fun. Only catch is that most of these are in big cities so you could make the same pay but end up spending more on living expenses.   What about something like a restaurant operations consultant? Large food companies like US foods have these jobs and they seem perfect for you.  https://usfood.taleo.net/careersection/usf_external/jobdetail.ftl?job=15002747&lang=en  The link is just an example.

To answer your question, some college meant I fell just short of an associates. Nothing serious. I got out because I realized how worthless a journalism degree is nowadays. A dying field for what I wanted to specifically achieve.  I'll see if I can't find some similar jobs near me and go from there. Wouldn't mind any other ideas you/anyone can think of just to keep my eyes peeled for other potential jobs.  Thanks again amiglobe."

I ask myself these kinds of questions when something shitty is happening to me. Perhaps I'm coming off in a certain way that makes it difficult for people to interact with me.  As unfortunate as it might seem we have to be able to make ourselves ""marketable"". Its a gross work to use to describe yourself, but in order to get ahead in the working world you need to try and add that to the list of words to describe you.  Getting past a lot of the shit that bothers us often takes more energy than we're willing to give at times and in those instances you need to take care of yourself (mentally and physically) in order the maintain the veneer that you are ""fine"", ""properly dealing with your bullshit"" and making yourself marketable.   Make it a priority to vanquish mental/emotional demons. THEN go forth and welcome the age of Finaldragoon"
findapath,3c988v,AgnosticJihad,3,Mon Jul 6 03:40:00 2015 UTC,"After skimming through your post, my candid recommendations are:   Take responsibility for your future. No doubt other people/life-in-general negatively impacted you, but they don't determine the course of your life - you do. When describing your life, don't say ""they made this happen to me, they did such and such to me""...Reframe those thoughts in terms of your own actions - ""I became depressed because I felt XXXXXX about myself, which may have partially been a result of so-and-so's bullying"".   Many people have had ""better"" lives than you, of course, but many successful people have also started off in much worse places. Don't ignore your issues, but don't let them define you either (You are Finaldragoon, not Finaldragoon who has depression/PTSD/social anxiety). Find a way to cope (probably some combo of therapy/medication/exercise) and move forward as quickly as possible. There may not have been a high demand for computer programmers, in your area, 10 years ago, but there certainly is, at least in many places, today. You're probably rusty, but there's no better time than now to get back out there and pursue that career. If you can't find a job in your area, figure out a way to save up money for a move. You may not get a $150k job in the Silicon Valley, but that's probably not even what you want. There are plenty of ""boring"" $50-60k jobs in ""normal"" towns across the country that are accessible to a programmer of your level, although you may need to brush up on your skills first.   There are so many resources available today, for those looking to learn programming, that you should have no problem (if you are truly committed) to bringing your programming skills up to par. Take community college classes if you need to, but you could also use a myriad of online options to refine your abilities. Alternatively, if you can afford it, finishing a 4-year degree will make you that much more marketable as a job candidate. In addition, working with a university career services department can help you troubleshoot your employment difficulties. Any reasonably local state school should be fine for your needs.  it feels like I've been stuck in neutral ever since finishing college and coasting along letting things happen around me...    I get that impression as well, and I think it has to do with your perspective...  *Your town is too small to find work.  *Your employer fired you for ""garbage reasons"".  *Your therapist doesn't care about you.  *Applying for financial aid is too difficult to make returning to school worthwhile...  You are living life passively. You are just letting things happen to you, but not doing anything about them is a choice you are making. It seems to me that you have an external locus of control. If you want your life to change, you need accept that you are responsible for you future and that only you can change your life.    So let's briefly revisit the above issues:   Your town is too small for you to find a job (at least in your field).   This could very possibly be true. If it is, the only real solution is to move. Programming is extremely marketable right now and there's no reason a committed job-seeker should be long-term unemployed if they are willing to relocate.   Your employer fired you for ""garbage reasons"".    I suppose it's possible that this could be true, but, as an impartial third-party, that is not my assumption. Have you considered the possibility that there is a legitimate reason you were let go? Did you talk to your employer about how you were performing at your job? How you could improve? Etc? Try (sincerely) to view the situation from your employer's perspective. Were they better off with you working there than someone else? If not, how could you change to make that so?   Your therapist doesn't care about you (paraphrased).   I'm not sure where you are but, at least in the US, therapists aren't paid very well - they do their jobs because they do care. Is it possible that, instead of not caring about you, your therapist is frustrated because she hasn't seen you make a sincere effort to change your perspective? If nothing has changed over the past 2 years, is it possible she thinks that there's nothing more she can do for you? That forcing some change (your seeking out a new therapist, or not) is better than no change at all?   Applying for financial aid is too difficult to make taking classes worthwhile.    This is a very weak excuse (although I can empathize with how you feel, as I've been there). This statement directly contradicts the following:   I know what I have to do, I just don't know how to go about doing it.   You know that you want to take classes to further your education, and you do know how to...start by completing the financial aid application. If you can write computer programs, you can complete a financial aid application. The school will help you if you are actually having trouble with it (I suspect that you won't, but it is a possibility). Fill out the app, take the classes, profit.   I'm sorry this is so disorganized, and I wish that I could devote more time to writing a better response, but this is all I've got. I'll leave you with a brief plan of what I would do if I were you. Keep in mind that we are completely different, and have different priorities.   Fill out the damn financial aid application. Do it today. If you don't have the motivation to do it online, drive to your school's office and complete it in person.  Choose classes that fit with your schedule and will strengthen your resume.  Look for work in your town. Any work. It can be for minimum wage. Your goal is not to make money, but to develop into a good employee, and to work on your social anxiety through daily human interaction. So show up early, never ever complain, and always try to improve.  Work on your mental health.  Find a new therapist. Tell them to be hard on you.  Start exercising. Every day. It can be just a few push-ups a day - do what you can. Don't cheat yourself by taking days off or taking it too easy. Read books. Some recent ones I've read that you may find useful are The End of Stress (Bernstein), Getting Things Done (Allen), How to Win Friends and Influence People (Carnegie), Quiet (Cain), and The Alchemist (Coehlo). Think about where you want to be in 1, 2, 5 years time and write out explicit goals to pursue. If I were you, my 5 year goal would be to be making $60-70k (+ benefits), living in my own apartment in a medium-cost city that I enjoyed, and to have saved up a down payment for a reasonably-priced home. Your goals may be different, that's fine. Figure out how to achieve the goals you just wrote down. For the goals I wrote down: Find and compare affordable 4-year computer science programs at affordable state schools locally, regionally, or in cities you might one day enjoy living in. Figure out what you need to do financially and academically to get into and graduate from the programs that most appeal to you. Do those things, whatever they are. Write those things down and display them prominently, along with your 5 year goal, in your room/house/wherever you'll see them daily.  Do. Just do. In the six steps above, you've laid down all the groundwork for success. All that's left is the execution. You don't even have to think anymore. Just do. Every day, look at your goals and keep doing what you need to do to achieve them. That might mean doing hard, uncomfortable things. That's fine. You'll feel better doing hard, uncomfortable things than you do now. I guarantee it.    In closing, you are the only one who can make yourself successful. Unfortunately, you can also make yourself fail. Make a habit of being brutally honest with yourself (a daily journal can help, and/or meditation). Most people lie to themselves to make unpleasant emotions go away. Don't let that be you. That's like trading a winning lottery ticket for a cookie, in a moment of hunger. You have control over yourself, your thoughts, and your actions, but only if you're willing to acknowledge reality. If something seems too hard, carefully consider whether it's your mind manipulating you on behalf of your insecurities. In your position, it's probably better to take a chance and try to do something impossible than to not try something achievable. Keep that in mind, and you'll be shifting through life's metaphorical gears before you know it."
findapath,3c988v,clawedjird,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"I really do appreciate the small essay you put together to try and help me, and I really do wish it was as simple as you typed out. But, if I may, I would like to go over each of your points.    Take responsibility for your future... For the most part, depression doesn't consume every thought of every second. After dealing with it for more or less 20 years, I have learned to live with it. I know depression can't be simply cured, only managed. Mentally, I'm fine for the most part, but I do still have my off days where I wish things were better. Programming advice... I'll just say this right now: Taking all those courses in college for my degree killed all interest I have in computer programming. That's what happens when the college constantly cancels required courses on you and, when push came to shove, I was forced to take 5 computer classes in the same semester. It gave me burnout that I never really recovered from. So, while you put a lot of effort into that advice, I'm afraid it has fallen on deaf ears. Problems with my perspective... I'll just go over them as I see them.    1) I'm too afraid to uproot my life in the pursuit of a job that may or may not be there waiting for me. I've lived in the same area for my entire life, and I don't want to take the risk of losing what little I have in my savings account on the what ifs or maybes.  2) I was literally fired because I somehow improperly shutdown a computer at my cubicle and IT had to take the weekend to repair it even though it was fine at the end of my shift. Honestly, I think it was because they were looking for a reason to not renew my contract for another year. But that's just conspiracy thinking on my part.  3) We're talking about a therapist group where my case manager doesn't contact me for months at a time, letting any medical prescriptions I'm on expire for no reason, and Psychiatrist checkups get delayed with no sign of a reschedule. I don't know why I keep going to them, probably laziness, probably some form of battered wife syndrome(they'll start caring about me this week I swear). Honestly, these days I just see my therapist weekly because it's one of the few times I get out of the house each month.  4) You're right. I do know what I have to do and how to go about it, but I'm just scared. The fear of failure has crippled me for too long and I'm sick of it. Nothing happens because I allow nothing to happen.  5) As for your steps on improving my situation. I have no idea what classes I would want to take, so why should I file for financial aid and get frustrated all over again? I just looked through the classifieds and saw nothing...again. I think I will ask my therapist tomorrow who she would recommend locally. I did take a Yoga class from college last year, but because I had to pay out of pocket due to said financial aid issues, I didn't want to go back. As for gyms, given my current financial situation, I don't think that's a possibility. And lastly, the only thing I know for sure about my future self, I simply want to be in a better situation than I am right now.  I'm sorry if I'm sounding painfully stubborn. I probably should have gone into more detail in my initial post. I understand that you want to help me out and the onus is on my part to apply the advice given to me. It does sound like I'm just making excuses to get out of changing my life, but honestly...I'm scared...scared of life."

Let's back up and start small. The steps I listed were pretty generic and, because of that, probably seem unrealistic. Specificity is your friend when making goals. The smaller and more detailed a task is, the easier it will be to attempt and complete it.    I'm scared...scared of life.   Let's start here, because this is probably the root of a lot of your struggles. What are you afraid of? Financial insecurity? Loneliness? Death?

You need to forgive yourself for being someone you don't like and work on becoming someone that you do. If you apply to 10 jobs today, and are rejected by all of them, what have you lost? If you don't like the way things are now, you're going to have to change something. At this point, there's no shame in starting small. Try starting a productive new habit, such as beginning each day with a half-hour run (or walk). Commit to doing it (whatever it is) for a month. You'll be surprised at the impact of one small change on your life. Getting a job (any job) will provide one huge benefit, in that it will distract you from yourself for at least a few hours a day. If you can't find a ""real"" job, don't be afraid to find a temporary job on craigslist.

findapath,3c988v,basementcat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:58:57 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you just need to take a step and do something.  When I graduated from college there were no job prospects in 2008/2009.    I worked doing deliveries for the family until I decided to leave.  I applied to every job twice, three times, or more.  I was rejected so many times.  Did it matter?  Absolutely not.  I kept applying anyways.  Read job forums, interview questions, followup emails, resume building, and learn about the industry.  Apply similar positions at the same company.  Do anything to get noticed.  I called my university to use their job search.  This is how I got my first actual post college job.  Since then I've built my linkedin profile over and over again.  I ended up taking a mid level IT job in consulting, worked my ass off, asked a lot of stupid and smart questions, and moved onto something better.  IT isn't my background but I gave it shot and it's paid off.  Rejection is nothing to be scared off.  If you're lucky to get an interview and a rejection letter or email, be courteous and ask why you were rejected in a followup email or phone call.  Learn from it and move on.  TLDR: Be persistent, apply to every job that seems interesting, build up a resume/linkedin profile, keep an open mind, and ask lots of questions.
