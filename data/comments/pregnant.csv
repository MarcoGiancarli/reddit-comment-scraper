pregnant,3dy7ax,CachHa,4,Mon Jul 20 14:35:20 2015 UTC,"You look awesome! I'm 18 weeks and don't look much smaller than my friend at 26 weeks.... Its all based on fluid and how you carry. Don't feel self conscious just flaunt that cute bump and think of how awesome it is that you're carrying a little one! Not everyone gets the chance, pregnancy is a beautiful thing even if we feel like cows half the time!"
pregnant,3dy7ax,TheOnlyOpester,2,Mon Jul 20 18:37:00 2015 UTC,I'm right there with ya. I'm 11+3 and I feel like I'm big for this stage. It looks and feels like my uterus isn't behind my pelvic bone anymore.
pregnant,3dy7ax,bangarang_bananagram,2,Mon Jul 20 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a little jealous, I just found out I have an anterior placenta -- I'm showing less than you are and I'm 21+6."
pregnant,3dy7ax,bitterred,2,Mon Jul 20 16:50:23 2015 UTC,Uhh. I have an anterior placenta and I'm as big as a house. :(
pregnant,3dy7ax,-MyUsername-,2,Mon Jul 20 23:18:32 2015 UTC,Me too. Wah.
pregnant,3dy7ax,MarieCakeAntoinette,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:09 2015 UTC,"You look great! Don't compare to others, you have a different body type and routine then everyone else. I'm 17w and finally starting to show a little, but everyone tells me when they were at my stage they were way bigger. So what's worse?! ha"
pregnant,3dy7ax,Grkgdss00,3,Mon Jul 20 17:51:31 2015 UTC,My sister was HUGE her entire pregnancy. She already had a bump like yours at about 12 weeks!
pregnant,3dy7ax,nfmadprops04,2,Mon Jul 20 18:58:58 2015 UTC,Unrelated but I love your dress :)
pregnant,3dy7ax,smiley199xx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:56 2015 UTC,"Nice! I also got big rather early in the pregnancy. Took so much convincing to get my husband to understand that, despite how early it was, it really was just a baby bump and not a bunch of fat I'd suddenly gained."
pregnant,3dy7ax,rigabamboo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:06:15 2015 UTC,"I am 21 weeks, and I look just as big as my friend at 39. I also feel self conscious about it. But, I think you look cute!"
pregnant,3dhuox,belle1107,2,Thu Jul 16 11:57:21 2015 UTC,"First off congratulations!! If you can hold it together til after your first obgyn visit which would be when you are about 7 to 8 weeks, would be the best thing. I'm 6 weeks now and my first visit will be end of the this month. My physician told me to hold off announcements until end of first trimester which is 13 weeks. Just in case if something were to happen. If you need someone to talk to, there are plenty of great mommy forums online... and if you have a best friend whom you trust, you can confide to him/her while your partner is away. If you have any questions lmk. I'd gladly help as much as I'm learning now. Good luck!!"
pregnant,3dhuox,missmuffin86,2,Thu Jul 16 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! Why are you nervous and scared, anything specific?  I didn't tell anybody until after 12 weeks, when I had my first scan and the higest risk had passed. My SO wanted to tell everybody right away - but I wouldn't want people to get excited ahead of time. Besides, my brother-in-law just had his, so I wanted them to have the attention."
pregnant,3dhuox,potatofreudster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:10:53 2015 UTC,I think if you explain it exactly like that your partner should understand.   Heck my. Boyfriend didn't even tell me until after he told his dad.
pregnant,3dhuox,whatgoesup56,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:11:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Congratulations to you both!! I guess i'm scared that because its so early i feel that if i tell anyone i'm jixing my self. i know that no matter how far alone you are that there are always risks. I have confided in a very close friend at work as we do the same job and she knew that me and my partner were trying. I know i can trust her and she wont say anything but we dont see each other as much outside work as she has a young family, we txt and msg frequently so i know that i have her confidence. But i really want to be able to tell a family member, i thought about my sister, shes the loviest person and i know shed be able to keep it secret but I'm just so hestitant that something could go wrong and it would be devastating to have to tell them that. I want to be confident in this pregnancy that it will be ok, but as my partner would vouch for me i'm such a worrier i cant relax and enjoy it until he's back and we can get a scan done.  Can i ask another questin, if i'm quite early on as the results indicator said when should i go to the doctor, should i wait a few weeks and then go so i'm hopefully further along or asap.  Any help is amazing, i appreciate that talking to people who dont know you but understand what your going through can really help. xax"
pregnant,3dhuox,potatofreudster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:55:26 2015 UTC,"Just call your doctor, she'll tell you when and where to get an appointment (you'll eventually have appointments with her, aswell as midwife and scans).  Just try to figure out when your last period was, so she can calculate how long into the pregnancy you are.  Sounds like a good idea to tell your work friend or sister (whoever you feel most comfortable with). Your work friend has been pregnant herself and knows what you're going through.  Try not to worry, it's bad for your health and there isn't much you can do besides eating healthy and taking pregnancy-vitamins anyway (there's extra folic acid in pregnancy multivitamins)."
pregnant,3dhuox,missmuffin86,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:33:32 2015 UTC,"What I did when I found out was I made an appointment with my family doctor, they did a urine test and blood test (which takes a few days and really it's up to you if you want to do the blood test) from there you gotta start shopping for an obgyn to book your first prenatal visit. You can ask obgyns if they will allow you to do a meet and greet (it's an opportunity to meet the doctors and staff) and some office will and others won't. Word of advice: don't settle with your doctor, this doctor or doctors will be with you throughout your journey and you should feel secure and comfortable with them. If you don't connect with them, move on to the next.  As far as when you should see a doctor, most offices will want to see you at 7 to 8 weeks and they will help you figure out by your last first day menstruation. Don't be nervous, stress is not good for you!  Make sure you're taking you're prenatal vitamins and LISTEN TO YOUR BODY, if you're tired take a nap! And if you're able to go for walks, do it! Your body is producing more blood so you'll feel exhuasted and walking helps out alot."
pregnant,3dhuox,gardenhippy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:09:19 2015 UTC,"I told my sister straight away. She is my best friend and I've been so glad to have her support - she's my wingman when we're out, getting me G&T without the G etc, very subtly! I'm so relieved to have her support. I'd say if you're close and you trust her, talk to your sister. If things did go wrong you'd need her love and care even more, esp if your partner is away at the moment. Good luck lovely xx"
pregnant,3dhuox,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:42 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll have to go speak to my doctor and get checked out. I recently moved into my partner's house about which is 7 miles from my usual doctor so I don't know if I'll still come under them so that's something I'll have to query. I am starting to feel tired alot more than I usually do so I will make sure and take more naps when needed and make sure that I take more care of myself than I would normally. I hate needles, have a complete irrational fear of them but for this reason I would get one if I have to.  I have also confided in my sister who is completely over the moon for me and my partner, she has 3 children so she's knows exactly what to expect and is there for any advice and help I need. It really feels good to be able to have someone so close to me to talk to and share my feelings with, its like a real weight lifted and I can relax a little more. xax ☺"
pregnant,3dgy72,Ravenmalik,4,Thu Jul 16 04:43:35 2015 UTC,"Obviously talk to your doctor if you're this concerned, but that sounds well within the range of ""pregnancy business as usual"" to me and not a cause for alarm."
pregnant,3dgy72,amphetaminelogic,5,Thu Jul 16 05:09:38 2015 UTC,This happened to me from around week 16 and it lasted right up until the end of my pregnancy and beyond (obviously!). It's best to consult your doctor if you're worried but as far as I'm aware it's fairly normal to have a bit of leakage - when I mentioned it to my midwife she said that it probably just meant I'd end up with a lot of milk which is exactly what happened. My son is constantly hungry so it's nice to have an almost oversupply for him!   Your wife should get some breast pads if she hasn't already as there is nothing more annoying than waking up covered in milk after leaking all over your sheets all night or leaking through your bra and onto your shirt.   Good luck with the doctor and the rest of the pregnancy!
pregnant,3dgy72,cocaineandcigarettes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:34:21 2015 UTC,Thank you!
pregnant,3dgy72,Grkgdss00,2,Thu Jul 16 18:03:28 2015 UTC,Yes this is totally normal.
pregnant,3dgy72,potatofreudster,2,Thu Jul 16 16:36:57 2015 UTC,"Some ""leak"" early and some does a few days after birth (according to a pregnancy book I got from my doctor), so I believe everything inbetween that range is considered normal."
pregnant,3ddzv8,dropdeadhalxx,5,Wed Jul 15 15:08:08 2015 UTC,"Keep both in mind.. and when you have your baby look and him see which name seems to fit. I like Kyle Christopher,  and you have an easy last name that will fit nicely with any name you choose. You could also nickname him K.C. if you wanted :)"
pregnant,3ddzv8,-r0se-quartz-,-1,Wed Jul 15 17:58:31 2015 UTC,Kyle
pregnant,3ddzv8,Babywhale,3,Wed Jul 15 19:15:44 2015 UTC,"I personally like Wyatt more, but only because I've had a few bad experiences with Kyles. In the end you don't have to decide right away. You can even wait until you actually look into your baby boy's eyes to see what name you feel suits him more :)"
pregnant,3ddzv8,tyrarae,3,Wed Jul 15 15:27:42 2015 UTC,Thank you guys! It's so hard. He favors Wyatt more and I like that it's unique so we will probably choose that one 😀

pregnant,3ddzv8,ksperry,2,Wed Jul 15 15:13:55 2015 UTC,"Oh man, they're both really solid. Either one is a winner! I like Wyatt better personally though. :)"
pregnant,3ddzv8,ZisforZombie,2,Wed Jul 15 15:25:30 2015 UTC,"Awe, Wyatt is the name of my baby due end of August! :) great pick!!   My husband sent me a link today that apparently the name jumped to #4 on the popular list. It was definitely not that far up when we picked it a few months ago :/"
pregnant,3ddzv8,ZisforZombie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:48:09 2015 UTC,"Most likely because of Mila kunis. My husband likes Wyatt Earp, so that's why he picked the name 😁"
pregnant,3ddzv8,themildones,2,Thu Jul 16 04:34:28 2015 UTC,"Oh Gosh. I didn't even know it was Mila Kunis's kids name. I'm definitely not up on my celeb news. It's still a great name, and we are still keeping it! Lol"

pregnant,3dcwrn,leela_is_me,4,Wed Jul 15 07:49:42 2015 UTC,"Unisom is perfectly safe to take while pregnant and it helps with morning sickness too. I have a script for promethazine for morning sickness and it also makes me drowsy and helps with sleep if I take it before bed.  I'm 12 weeks too and even with a bit of help from promethazine I'm still not getting that great of sleep. I'd just say nap if/when you can, let yourself catch up by sleeping in on the weekends, keep your bedroom cool, and don't use your computer in bed or late at night if you're trying to sleep (I have the rule that the laptop does not come into the bedroom with me - only a book is allowed)"
