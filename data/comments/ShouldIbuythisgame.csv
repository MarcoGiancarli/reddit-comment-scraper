ShouldIbuythisgame,3e4rwy,Marmaduk,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:50:39 2015 UTC,"No problem! Just a quick note, the game is definitely not for everyone. The graphics are like early Xbox 360 era at best, and the combat was thrown in very last second, so its bad.  However, the story is amazing and full of crazy twists and turns, the voice acting is very good, and every single NPC feels like a different person. Like I said, you'll either really love it, or REALLY hate it."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3e3y0c,JackRosier,9,Tue Jul 21 19:42:09 2015 UTC,If you rush right now GreenManGaming has ESO for $15 and Imperial for about $30. Use the code ENCORE-ENCORE-ENCORE to grab an extra 20% off.  I really do recommend GTA V but it's really hard for me to compare when you can get ESO so much cheaper. I will say though that ESO is nothing like Skyrim. It's an mmo all the way and not really an Elder Scrolls game. It may be easier to get into than other mmos but it's really lacking the solo feel of a huge world of the Elder Scrolls games. If you enjoy questing in Skyrim and you like moral choice though ESO will probably make you fit right in.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3e3y0c,HWXLjosalfareix,0,Tue Jul 21 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"ESO feels really empty. Sure, there are quests and areas to explore, but content-wise and gameplay-wise, there really isn't much substance. As far as MMOs go, you can do a lot better. There's certainly an attempt made to make it feel like an Elder Scrolls game from a lore and world design perspective, but it all comes off as an imitation of the real thing. If you're looking for an Elder Scrolls game, you may want to give it a miss unless you're really invested in the lore."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3e3y0c,Hellknightx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:49:51 2015 UTC,"The fully voiced quests really make the world feel alive, most if not all are really well written. Once you finish all the zones jam packed with quests you have the huge zone of cyrodiil to explore. Cyrodiil is full of dungeons, pvp, towns and quests not to mention forts to take/defend.  Gameplay wise the game is extremely rich, there are tons of combos to try out and experiment with and you can switch up your build to anything you want with relative ease. Any playstyle can be viable for any class.  Pvp in cyrodiil is very fun and rewarding; you can hop on for a few minutes or sink hours into attacking and defending in the constant battle. You get mailed rewards for participating.  Not sure where you got your information from; when was the last time you played ESO?  edit: Forgot to mention crafting in ESO is the best in any mmo i've ever seen. Simple and still effective and most of all the gear you can make is often times better for your level than quest rewards. Lots of styles (motifs) to collect and researching stat increases gives a good long term goal to crafting as well."

Vanhelsing II is a fun game if you like Diablo-Esque games and is the continuation of the popular series. (Way better then the first and third one from what I hear)  Endless Space is a great game if you like RTS's and 4X games and you are like me and have a soft spot for the Final Frontier (Space in case it wasn't clear.)  The Stanley Parable is a fun little game (that honestly if you see it on Youtube kills the enjoyment of the game) It's a nice little adventure game that's easily worth the price of the BTA by itself.  As for the PWYW tier I believe it's worth it as Mercenary Kings, Outland, and Fallen Enchantress are all good looking games with positive reviews."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3e49pi,D9sinc,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:08:37 2015 UTC,Personally for me It was worth it to pay 5$ for just Endless space.  Mid tier is great. Maybe not got for space engineers just yet even though it's a bunch of fun.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3e3si9,EnderESXC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:23 2015 UTC,"I also suggest you get a Total War game, but wait for a sale, most of them drop to like 7,49€ if not even lower.  Just like Civ it's a turn based strategy, however, TW is just like the name suggests more about combat with a bit of empire management tossed in.  The biggest difference however is that battles are in real-time, they can be paused, but you still have to manage several units at once and come up with good strategies. IIRC battles can be skipped, but you usually get a worse result that way than if you had used a good strategy.  On the subject of which one to get, get the one which you think has the best setting, the newer games have more features I think, but setting is almost even more important IMO, if you don't like the units you will not like the game as much since you will stare at them all the time.  /u/EnderESXC suggested Shogun 2, I haven't played the base game, but the standalone expansion, Fall of the Samurai is amazing IMO. You get Ninjas, Gatlings and ironclads all fighting against/togheter with eachother all over Japan. You said you weren't interested in shooters, but one fun thing about this game atleast is that you can control atleast the ships like it was a third person shooter, which IMO was a nice feature, but I don't know about you."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3e1vww,Vestorri,4,Tue Jul 21 09:04:43 2015 UTC,"I got mine recently, and I'd say the investment is worth it. So far, the only games exclusive to it are XenoBlade Chronicles 3D and the Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth (releases Thursday in NA), but the features it brings to existing games are refreshing  First, Monster Hunter 4 becomes playable. It's an incredibly fun game that you don't really replay as much as you continue doing the same stuff in better ways. The C stick is good as a camera controller, something the old model needed a specific add on (circle pad pro) that made the system clunky (you can play without it, but it becomes far better with it).  New Leaf and 3D Land are incredibly fun, but they're about what you expect with no real changes. Loading times are much better thanks to the better CPU, and the framerate is solid thanks Tobit as well. Luigi's Mansion is a fantastic game and is worth buying a 3DS of any kind for, but there's no real difference when buying it for a 3DS or New 3DS.  I'd also recommend Majora's Mask 3D, as the camera is dynamic for that game as well, as well as being the best Zelda made. Kid Icarus: Uprising and Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater also utilize the dynamic camera and are pretty good in their own Rights  Besides those, I can recommend Fire Emblem: Awakening and the aforementioned Xenoblade Chronicles 3D. The first is a strategy RPG and the latter is a remake/port of a Wii JRPG that has been regarded as one of the best in the past decade.  The system itself is great, coming with a much better storage system (Micro SD cards), NFC compatibility (for amiibo), and various control adjustments. My favorite part, though, is the labeling on each button. On my old 3DS, it was a cheap paint, whereas the buttons are created as plastic with the colored labels. It sounds minor, but that means no chipping the paint and making the buttons uncomfortable to use. There are two extra triggers on the back, ZR and ZL, but nothing has been done with them so far in the system's lifespan."

But I think most people would recommend upgrading.  I would definitly recommend it if you don't have the circle pad pro. The only thing really keeping me from upgrading is the circle pad pro, because it makes the 3DS finally fit into my hands (I don't have huge hands, but they're pretty large) and I don't like the small c-stick on the new one as much.  But the graphics are downgraded: The N3DS Version has a higher texture resolution and a more stable framerate, which is even more noticeable when you're playing online. The 3DS version tends to stutter in multiplayer, but it's still playable.   Here is a comparison video of both versions."

If you get animal crossing, I highly recommend getting the digital version. Its so much more convenient.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3e2bh7,dccr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"Get it!  It's very short (but with decent replay value), worth going through at least twice. It can be completed without rushing in maybe 2-3 hours.  That being said, it was one of the most memorable gaming experiences I've had in the last ~5 years. Beautiful art style/aesthetic, fun to play/good controls, and an engaging ""plot"" (it's not very clear at first and it starts to make more sense by the end, but it is very minimalist).  It also has some of most organically integrated and well-used multiplayer of any game I've ever played. If you aren't aware already, as you explore the world, you cross paths with other players in the same area as you. You can work together to progress, but if one of you wanders off, the connection is dropped and it finds you another buddy. There's no communication except for little beeps you can do, and players are only distinguished by a small rune they get (generated for each playthrough). Once you finish the game, you'll see the screen names for everyone you played with over the course of your playthrough. You might be surprised at how many different people you met."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3e3mag,BbqRaisins,6,Tue Jul 21 18:22:49 2015 UTC,"Despite the first in the series being called ""Demon's Souls"", and despite the fact that you fight large and small ""demons"" (they are really just fantasy looking creatures), I wouldn't say that any of these games have a demonic feel to them. As in, I never had the sense of overwhelming evil in these games.   However, there are portions of Dark Souls 1 and 2 that are unquestionably gloomy and kind of just miserable in the sense that the environments are dark and dank and not places you'd want to hang out. The cool thing about these environments is that they make the bright, colorful areas that much more appreciated and joyful. Hence, ""Praise the Sun!"".   From what you say about the combat system looking up your alley, I'd suggest you definitely give Dark Souls 1 a try and see if it grabs you. If it does, it may well become one of your favorite games of all time, as it has for me and many others. There really is something special about the game.  If you end up liking it and want more, then maybe move on to DSII. I recently finished DSII and just didn't like it much, but I definitely don't want to get into a DS vs. DSII fight here.     tl;dr  Dark Souls is inexpensive wherever you want to play it (360, ps3 or PC) and it's an amazing game. It's gloomy quite often but doesn't feel demonic. The combat is fantastic and has a sense of physicality that most games are missing. Give it a shot, the risk is worth the reward."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3e3mag,wonder_cheese,3,Tue Jul 21 18:37:18 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls' aesthetic is less demony, and more, 'tattered remains of a dying world.' It's hostile, because what lives in it is hostile, but there isn't an oppressive sense of the world being out to kill you.  I can tell you when I picked up Monster Hunter 4, I felt it was a weaker version of Dark Souls' combat. Your mileage may vary, but they are somewhat similar, and if you enjoy the one, you should enjoy the other.  If you're really concerned that the atmosphere might put you off, you could jump straight to DS2; it's a much better PC port, and is a lot brighter and more... I'd say, human, in general. It's also the weaker game, but it's still good.  Ultimately, though, Dark Souls is one of the best games I've ever played, and everyone should at least try it, so yes, play it."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3e3ez8,Silvernocte,3,Tue Jul 21 17:33:09 2015 UTC,"I have played both and prefer Pillars of Eternity. It will definitely depend on personal taste as they're very different games. I'll give a brief critique of sorts for both though -    I think the Witcher III was less focused and tight this time. They spent a lot of time creating side content and a big open world. It looks great and there's lots to do but I got burnt out multiple times as it became tedium. Part of this is probably because it's still a linear game with pre-made character, so you don't get that feeling of freedom to dink around as there's a main objective looming over your head. It never quite felt like a real open world experience to me. The structure of quests also left a lot to be desired, as it was very ""hand-holdy"" and there's not much room for creative approaches to completing objectives. It's typical follow the arrow to the objective point stuff(most of the time).  They still did a nice job allowing for some choices that lead to different and interesting outcomes, sometimes even a way down the road a decision you make will have ramifications. So that's still there which is a good thing.   The combat is definitely an improvement and they recently made a patch/DLC that allows a style of movement more comfortable for many people. However I still have several issues with their combat system and controls. Also, even on the hardest difficulty much of combat ends up trivial once your character is level 10+ I'd say, since you become dramatically more powerful as you level up for various reasons.    Pillars OTOH I finished without any burnout, even though I spent over a hundred hours in the beta. It wasn't as replayable as I was hoping for me, but the first couple playthroughs were great.   I would say Pillars is > Witcher III when it comes to dialogue and story stuff. That said I'm probably missing some things as someone who hasn't read any of the Witcher books. In PoE it also probably helps having a party of colorful characters that weigh in on your actions. I do wish there were more writing though, and particularly for companions. But they were pretty clear that they chose quality over quantity and rather than lots of banter, they went for relevant banter.   The game world is pretty awesome, if you liked the hand-painted feel of the old IE games you should love this. The setting is fairly interesting and deviates enough from stereotypical fantasy settings to feel like something new.  Combat wise, it's not quite as good as old school DnD, but given their limited time frame and budget they did pretty damned well. It's more ""organic"" feeling in some ways than the old IE games, but it also has a little less tactical variety IMO, and certain tactics are too powerful/reliable for too many encounters so combat can get stale. They're improving it still though and an expansion is planned which I'm excited about.     So my vote goes toward Pillars of Eternity. Take it with a grain of salt, YMMV, etc."

Some of the unlockable buildings require negative things to happen. Worst choice in gaming history. Make negative things achievements, not something to unlock.   Don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic game. Just be prepared for it all to go to shit because of bugs and poor design choices."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dz7pd,thescarwar,4,Mon Jul 20 19:05:46 2015 UTC,"Just to point out, the train bug was fixed in the most recent patch. The negative achievements are designed for people who plan on having a few cities. It's easier to toy around with negative decisions when you have a lot of other cities you're working on. I have gotten so much joy out of this game; it's incredible. The first time you start playing with the basics you'll fall in love. It's incredibly intuitive and easy to pick up. It's very satisfying to build your city up, and there are a nice set of goals along the way based on population to keep your city growing. The devs are incredibly active as well, and their community manager, /u/TotalyMoo is a great guy keeping us all connected with the development process. Check out /r/CitiesSkylines for more info!"

The problem is the trains get stuck in maps that don't belong to you. You have a choice of purchasing land and if you don't buy that specific block you can't do anything to fix the train problem.   ""You need to fuck your city up so badly that you have to start over"" negative?   One of them is ""Lower taxes to 4% for 5 or 6 weeks"". When I did this I lost pretty much all of my money. The money goes very quick when you don't have taxes coming in.  Another one is making the unemployment rate really high and another is to have lots of abandoned buildings.  The way to do this is to raise taxes considerably. However, doing this causes exactly what is required above. Tons of abandoned buildings. It takes FOREVER for them to be built back up again. During this time you're losing money because there are no buildings generating taxes.  You can try using the function where it increases the game speed but if you have a large city it doesn't even work. To me that's a bug. At a certain point a function of the game no longer works because you've played it too much."

I have also loved and played CoH1 for countless of hours (mostly on multiplayer). The main difference I can say between them is that CoH2 focus more on vehicles that are now the backbone of all the armies instead of the infantry, units die much faster and endgame in multiplayer kicks in after ~12 minutes.  Although, I haven't played CoH2 in a while but I think relic released a patch quite recently which makes all the non-tank units not useless during endgame and they prelonged the time it takes to arrive at endgame, making the dance with infantry and light vehicles longer before the tanks starts to roll in."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3e1e8v,Meat_grinder,0,Tue Jul 21 18:01:29 2015 UTC,"What game modes are you most interested in?  The single player in CoH2 is quite good.  Beyond the campaign modes, you also get a bunch of standalone missions for single player and co-op (the co-op maps can be played single-player with a CPU partner).  These maps can be quite challenging and a lot of fun.  If you're more into competitive multiplayer, I can't really recommend it.  It has a lot of micro transactions to unlock the various commanders.  You can technically grind for them, but the drop rate is appallingly low."

Heck, the game was originally based on Middle Earth (ToME -> Tales of Middle Earth -> then Tales of Maj Eyal) before it got its own lore.  ToME is very popular with the roguelike community and is known for it's more accessible UI.  Hunger is not a feature in the game however."

The Western part of the world is always the same, but once you get far enough from your home waters things become procedurally generated.

Cockatrice has no rules engine built in: you have to manually do everything. If you know the rules well, it can work fine. If not there might be some confusion between you and your opponent.   Xmage has a rules engine, so that issue isn't there.   Both are free. I've only used cockatrice before, and if you know the rules it works fine. You might want to research them."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3e0f5t,CMvan46,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:17:44 2015 UTC,"I mean unless you are really serious about the game I haven't found that to be an issue at all. It seemlessly puts in an AI player until another player is found. I really don't think that's a reason not to buy it really and I don't see how you will ever fix that problem. Games last 5 minutes, it's not potentially hour long games where people leave like Dota or League."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3e0f5t,nirate,4,Tue Jul 21 03:51:48 2015 UTC,"They could fix it by giving a cooldown for leaving the game, similar to CSGO or DotA. And you'd think people would actually stay more because the game is only 5 minutes, but that doesn't seem to be the case, haha."

Although its more of a Mystery Dungeon game than an Etrian Odyssey game, it is definitely a (real) roguelike dungeon crawler while the Zelda titles are much less demanding. Between the two Zelda games, I would recommend Majora's Mask if you have a new 3DS (or perhaps a circle pad pro) and haven't played the original, otherwise ALBW is a pretty fresh take on the Zelda mechanics."

Now to add my own:   Clusterpuck 99 is pretty much soccer but simplified, allows controller support up to 8. It's insane how competitive my friends and I got last time we played; 30 minutes in and everyone was yelling out every time a goal was made. Duck Game is a 2D deathmatch game that divides play into quick rounds where all guns are one hit kills. Very frantic and competitive. Also includes quacking. Lethal League is a fighting game where instead of attacking your opponent, you have to hit them with a baseball instead. Very unique and entertaining, as you hit the ball back and forth the speed increases drastically, making the screen flash and lets you feel like you just broke the sound barrier. Like Smash with dodge-balls. Rocket League is like soccer with cars. Don't actually own it but have seen gameplay and it looks fantastic. Includes four player offline and online splitscreen; so if you want you and your friends could compete online against another team of 4. 0space is like the battle room in Ender's game. Basically a 2d zero gravity shooter, and has no right being as fun as it is for the dollar you can get it for."

Here's the short version of the policy:   You can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steam—for any reason. Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.  It doesn't matter. Valve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within fourteen days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours. There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we’ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we’ll take a look.  You will be issued a full refund of your purchase within a week of approval. You will receive the refund in Steam Wallet funds or through the same payment method you used to make the purchase. If, for any reason, Steam is unable to issue a refund via your initial payment method, your Steam Wallet will be credited the full amount. (Some payment methods available through Steam in your country may not support refunding a purchase back to the original payment method.)   Source: http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/"

To someone in 2015 who is already a JRPG fan the graphics/sound/cinimatic/cutscenes aren't going to look good so all you'll be left with is the gameplay/story/characters which are completely average for the FF series.

Retribution has the flexibility to allow you to play any race, which can be fun, but the campaign is copy+pasted over to each race. So the replay value is somewhat diminished.  I do agree that Retribution has the best multiplayer, as Last Stand is very very fun."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dxpap,Hellknightx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:50:35 2015 UTC,Does anyone still play the multiplayer?
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dxpap,Kalcoholic,3,Mon Jul 20 19:37:48 2015 UTC,"Each of the three Dawn of War 2 games are standalone and do not require the others to play.  However, where multiplayer is concerned, Dawn of War 2 and Chaos Rising share the same multiplayer pool, while Retribution is off by itself; note that due to being the most recent and having more factions and units, Retribution is the best choice if all you want is multiplayer.  For the best campaign experience: Go for Dawn of War 2 + Chaos Rising. They use the same set of characters and as such stuff that happens in Chaos Rising will mean more because you already lived through the original Dawn of War 2.  If choosing between the two, I would still recommend just Dawn of War 2 for the campaign and picking up Chaos Rising at a later date.  if all you want is multiplayer or skirmish battles, or want a campaign where you can play as any faction (however shallow), Retribution is your best bet.  DLC  The vast majority of the DLC is going to be for The Last Stand, a horde mode where you control a single commander, ally with a team, and fight waves and waves of enemies. It is starkly different from the base games and can even be purchased separately.   You can differentiate between the DLCs in the following fashion:  ""Race Packs"" give you equipable wargear (armor, weapons, items) for Campaign Only. These items are absolutely not necessary to play or enjoy the campaign.  DLC with ""Wargear"" in the name is for Last Stand. I don't play Last Stand, but better wargear will probably give you a better experience. That said, you would need to play Last Stand before deciding which commander to buy wargear for...  Other stuff is skin packs. Skin packs are very neat and, contrary to the name actually change the models of what you're looking at (Deathcorps of Krieg give Imperial Guard facemasks!), but ultimately doesn't change gameplay at all.  tl;dr unless you're doing last stand, you need 0 DLC to enjoy or play Dawn of War."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dwtff,ShadoShane,9,Mon Jul 20 04:44:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you liked out of DA:O and DA2. DA2 was my favorite title for a few reasons. Story wise I loved the time skips throughout and seeing the party grow and how the party grew as a group of friends. Gameplay I think DA2 was by far the most challenging of the games and I enjoyed my nightmare runs greatly. DA:O I enjoyed for the massive map and tons of of stuff to explore. DA:I I think tried to do both but fell a little short. I still enjoyed DA:I but I haven't done a second playthrough yet when the previous titles I did immediately after beating my first run.  DA:I tries to have the massive world but at the same time keeping the same style I guess? of how they've done their modern games. Fully voiced NPCs with everything being an interactive conversation. Unfortunately this leads to giant maps with very few people to speak to after the first couple zones and pointless fetch quests galore. Even the few quests they have with voice that isn't the main quest feel like they were added very last minute when they realized they had this massive zone and nothing happening except picking up collectables.   Combat wise it was definitely dumbed down a bit from DA:O/DA2. Cross class combos seem improved from DA2 but they became rather pointless hit with X ability then Y for a bonus damage of whatever flavor your secondary finisher was. Not super far from DA2 although what constitutes as a finisher or a setup wasn't immediately obvious (though this might have changed there's been a few patches since I played last). Few other things but the combat, even on nightmare, was kinda a joke.   I dunno if I picked OP class or what but after fighting dragons in DA2 I was excited for them in DAI but they were super easy. The highest level dragon in the game I killed before he even got to stand up through one of the new super moves Haste. Wasn't even prepared, fell down a hole saw a dragon popped haste and killed him and got an achievement for killing all the dragons in the game. Was supremely disappointed after the high dragon battle at the mines in DA2.  Main story I think is really where DA:I shines. It does the ""you are the special snowflake that has to save the world"" bit but it does it pretty well. Not my favorite story but there's plenty of twists and turns to keep you hooked. The characters I don't think are as great as DA2 but they still really grow on you. I think the fact Hawke was just your companions bud in DA2 made their dynamic much more interesting compared to DA:I where you are more the glorified leader (without giving too much away) but all of the characters are great (more or less) with some extremely hilarious ones along the way.  If you aren't a super completionist like I was and can just skip the majority of zones past the first two or three and focus on the main story I think the game is worth it. If you are a super completionist I'd be a bit wary as it does get extremely dull running around these massive (and I mean massive) zones on a horse so you don't even get any party banter to pick up the 8 glowing shard or find a crystal skull or do a 2 line of dialogue fetch quest. Difficulty wise it's definitely a few steps back from DA2 or DA:O. Even in nightmare you have to purposely gimp yourself to make the game challenging. All this though the main story does carry the game and make it rather enjoyable."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dwtff,kimarimonku,3,Mon Jul 20 06:37:19 2015 UTC,You get to go to Orlais so that's a plus.  If you really enjoyed the first two I don't think you can go wrong with Inquisition.  I loved all three personally.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dwtff,whobang3r,2,Mon Jul 20 05:56:58 2015 UTC,"Your mileage may vary. If you're hoping that Inquisition on PC preserves the tactical gameplay, you won't find it here.  I personally didn't like the previous games for a number of reasons. Then I got into DAI and it ended up being an enjoyable game for me. I'm not sure what that says about how you might feel about the game, so maybe you could get into more detail about why you love the series?"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dwtff,gianttabby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:07:02 2015 UTC,I updated the post with more things I loved about the series. I've heard mostly the bad things about Inquisition and have only heard praise about the face customization for the good things.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dwtff,gianttabby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:35:09 2015 UTC,"I've only recently done one playthrough so far, so I'm not sure how much my choices matter. It it felt like they did at some points in the main quest, but that's as far as I know.  You do get a sense of progression. Alot of which from completing quests, raising power, commanding the Inquisition, crafting from the world's materials, and so on. All of this relates to how you grow your own characters' strength and the resources available.  Oh and you get to explore Orlais. Not just the capital and an imperial party, but also the open world sections there too."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dwtff,rainynight65,2,Mon Jul 20 07:18:23 2015 UTC,"Looking back, I probably enjoyed DA:O the most out of the three games, although I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as, say, any of the Mass Effect games. DA2 is probably my least favourite, with DA:I somewhere in the middle.  That being said, DA:I failed to make me care about any of the characters. They were all bland, fairly unsympathetic and unlikeable, with few exceptions to the contrary (Varric). The story was unspectacular and not well-presented, the side content completely uninteresting. Gameplay and world design were heaps better than DA2 though.  In DA2 my main issues were with the repetitive dungeons and buildings, and how almost every single decision had essentially the same outcome whichever way you went. But unlike DA:I, I actually cared about some of the characters (Hawke's sister comes to mind) and enjoyed the story up to a point."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dwtff,NoButthole,2,Mon Jul 20 07:00:36 2015 UTC,"What I want to know are if these accusations are accurate representations of the game or are they just exaggerations of the Dragon Age fanbase as consequence of the game not living up to their expectations?   A bit of both. There are a ton of (entirely optional and not in any way story-driven) fetch quests. They're there solely as a way of building up power, the resource for opening new maps. You really only need do them if you use all your power on a map that you can't beat because you opened it too early. They're also a good way to offload low level crafting materials when you outclass them. They're also infinitely repeatable. I didn't realize this at first and started getting frustrated thinking it was one of those really long fetch-quest strings because as soon as you turn it in at a camp, the Inquisition quest giver pops up with a new fetch-quest.  On the other hand, every map has some kind of minor, unique questline. Not necessarily a cutscene story, but it has a minor plot to follow that drives you to experience the map.   Making choices. Not just in the main quest, things like there were people there and I talked to them and they were robbed. Do I walk away or do I give them money?   There are a lot of small and large choices in this game. On of the early choices will determine what type of enemy you fight in the next mission and how two of the companions are introduced (hint: you get both of them regardless of choice so don't worry about that). I won't go into any details but I will tell you this as it was one of my favorite things about the game: when you become Inquisitor you get to pass judgement on your captives. You get a few choices, some of which can be pretty funny. I genuinely enjoyed figuring out the choice that would be the worst punishment for each unique individual. And it's not random NPCs, these are story characters that you can choose to take captive instead of killing and then pass judgement.   Progression. At first I died a lot because I'm not that great at games and my character is pretty weak. Eventually he gets strong enough on his own. (Enemy variety is good too.)   They added crafting, refined skill tress, and added a lot of synergy. No more filling out one tree and calling it a day. The best builds incorporate a few skills from each tree. That being said, focusing on one tree is perfectly viable. Crafting includes helmets, every type of weapon, and heavy, medium, and light armors. Most of the armors also have arm and leg upgrade slots that alter the appearance further, in addition to the color affects from the materials you use. Schematics come in 3 tiers, and materials have 4 tiers, the 4th being exclusively dragon mats. Progression is here in oodles.   The Orlesians. Did I spell that right? Either way, I liked them and would very much enjoy meeting them again.   A lot of the game takes place in Orlais. In fact, most of the story takes place in Orlais and you actually get to visit a small portion of Val Royeaux, the Orlesian capital city.  Edit: Sera is wonderful. Bring her with you. Everywhere."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dwtff,Elaine_Benes_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:51:40 2015 UTC,"DAI is trying pretty hard to be Skyrim and can sometimes feel fetch questy. However, the story and characters are fantastic. The decision-making is 10x more fraught, the world 10x darker. It's like Origins all grown up and come into its own (sadly they couldn't bring back DAO's perfect tactical gameplay, but whatever). So, I finally finished DA2 for the first time last week, pretty disillusioned with it, and I've been playing DAI non. Stop. I am in love with Solas, the Iron Bull, Sera, Cole, Cassandra, Vivienne, all the characters in their own ways. The mid-game climax scene--you'll know it when you see it--brought me to tears.   Just to add, one of my favorite things about the game (not giving too much away) is that it goes much deeper into the lore and backstory of the world and the different interpretations of it. Instead of just hearing ""oh, some people believe X about the Fade, some believe Y about magic, some think Z about Andraste,"" you have to divide yourself along those lines and also try to appeal to those who feel differently than you. And your opinions on a lot of things that felt ""solid"" in the DA world will probably change...  EDIT because I can't shut up about this game:  So I would say tl;dr, if your favorite things about Dragon Age are the stories and decision making, you will be more than happy with DAI; if it's important for you to have challenging combat and a very detailed open world, as others have said here, you will be more disappointed. I honestly have found the combat so dull that I've been playing it on normal and just rushing through each battle, but now that I just got access to specialized skill trainers, I'm going to reroll my skills (easy to do btw, you just buy an item) and try to be more thoughtful about synergy. I do really dislike the new tactical combat system, wish they had just left things like they were in DAO. I wish they had brought the displays and functionality of the tactical camera into the normal combat view instead of making you suddenly switch to a weird XCOM-like mode.  And yes, this game has so many damn Orlesians. I kind of love to hate them ;)"

I'm not sure about controller support though.  Dead Space series are pretty cool. The atmosphere in 2 and 3 is kinda patchy, but it works. Mostly jumspcare variety things, but there is some tension and panic moments.  Call of Cthulu: Dark Corners of the Earth is one of my favourites. Drawing directly from Lovecraft's tales, there are some awesome, chilling moments. I need to play it again actually.  If you haven't played the Penumbra games (also by Frictional Games) they are worth playing. Very similar in style to Amnesia, but different thematically. Highly enjoyable."

I'm an agreement with he above recommendations as well and would also recommend Miasmata. It's a bit different from other horror games but it's one of my favorites from being able to instil fear without being too over the top.  F.E.A.R the original is also a decent horror FPS.  Betrayer is a decent horror game as well, reminds me of Splinter Cell with horror elements. And the art style is interesting.  The Last Door is quite spooky for a 2D pixel horror game as well. Has a Lovecraftian vibe to it.  Afterfall Insanity is in the same vein as Dead Space but with more melee focus and a bit stranger plot.  Alan Wake is a  good horror game with a good story.  Condemned Crimial Origins is another FPS horror game. TBH the story is a bit... over the top and it's probably a bit better production than Cry of Fear, but with a bit looser story."

It's only $13 (USD) on Steam where it's normally $50 and the sale ends tomorrow at 10AM so you better get it fast.  Someone named The_Cpt_FROGGY on steam reviewed it where 250 of 273 people (92%) found the review helpful:   Alien fans, you will be in heaven... Well, actually stuck in a space station with humans (how boring), synthetic androids (bloody hard to kill) and your one and unique little black pet with his/her double extendable set of teeth and a very sharp and pointy tail.  This game is seriously creepy from the start and really true to the Alien movie franchise, especially the first one. I personally like the 1980 monitors on the space station.   You play Amanda Ripley and your quest is to find out what happened to your mother. You will end up on a station call Sevastopol, where your trouble will begin.  Essentially, this is more a stealth type of game rather than action (shooting) and make sure you know where you can hide. You will eventually find a gun but the ammunitions do not come in abundance, so really look after them. During your journey, you will be able to collect items like scraps, ethanol, sensors etc. With it you will be able to craft well needed objects like Molotov, Pipe bomb, Noise maker, Medipack and others.   Great graphics, splendid audio which empower the fabulous and scary atmosphere. The hairs on my back stood up more than once.   Positives: ~~~~~~~~    Great Graphics Great Audio True to the Alien movie franchise Runs Smoothly Achievements Story and Survival Mode   Negative: ~~~~~~~~    Where is Sigourney Weaver?

Injustice: Gods among us is a solid fighting game from the guys who make Mortal Kombat.  Killer Instinct is pretty lively on the Xbox one.  Skull girls, which someone already mentioned.   Street Fighter 4 Arcade edition is available on Steam, but you'll need some beefy specs to run it efficiently.   Mortal Kombat X is fun. But avoid it on PC if you can. It has living towers, single player challenges that change hourly, daily, etc and really extend the life of the game."

There are infinite skill resets free of charge so no need for a skill build. Play your own way. I have a guild of 3 people myself included we all just talk and rarely party. As for offline I couldn't tell you sorry.  Edit offline dark souls ultimate satisfaction

There's a buttload of stuff to do, challenges, hexes for added difficulty, a PvP and PvE arena, etc.    It's still in Early Access but the official release is in a couple of days.  I played it and reviewed it (spoiler: I gave it a 4/5) and also streamed it (spoiler: EB goes on a long Destiny tangent, as he is wont to do)."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dwah6,gianttabby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:59 2015 UTC,Grim Dawn is a good game that's somewhere between TL2 and PoE in terms of leveling/build complexity.    It's in Early Access at the moment but it feels like a full game and it should be released this year.  The devs have done a great job of adding content in the past.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dwcka,DexterJameson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:53:49 2015 UTC,Definitely this.  You'll get weeks worth of gameplay out of it without it feeling repetitive and plenty of free DLC/Updates constantly coming out for it too. It's one game you're guaranteed to get your moneys worth out of it.   Also have a look at Arkham Knight if you've played the previous Arkham games.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dwcka,Quinn155,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:30:34 2015 UTC,"I was kind of hesitant to get witcher 3 for a couple of reasons. One being I haven't played the other witcher so I felt like I might be lost.  2 - being a huge fan of the souls series I have grown really attached to how tight and natural they feel, I heard witcher is a bit clunky comparitavely? Could be wrong And my last concern is when TW3 launched the text was rediculously small, the way my TV is set up small text is definitely a problem (it's maybe 30 inches'ish and wall mounted above my dresser. Lost the TV stand a while ago) but if they patched this it would definitely sway me more towards getting it."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dwcka,DexterJameson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:24:31 2015 UTC,"I haven't played the first 2 games, but that didn't take anything away from my experience. In fact, I was so impressed with Witcher 3's story that I bought and am currently working my way through the original books, which are great so far.   While the combat is certainly not as tight as the souls games, it doesn't matter because that's not the appeal. The story, writing, characters, voice acting, and shear amount of content are what drew me in. The game is beautiful, has more dialogue than any game or movie that I know of, and the quests are genuinely fun and always interesting.   As a whole, Witcher 3 sets a new bar for RPG's in my mind. You can tell the developers poured everything they had into it, which is why I'm taking the time to tell you about it on the internet."

If you want a good review I recommend looking up Caddicarus' review of it."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dv8cj,Vicot17,8,Sun Jul 19 20:16:53 2015 UTC,Going off of your list I think The Witcher 3 is the obvious choice.   If you liked the first two...or even if you didn't.   Game of the year so far.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dv8cj,whobang3r,2,Sun Jul 19 21:03:43 2015 UTC,Witcher 3 is great game and based on your list would probably be your best choice
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dv8cj,bofrak,2,Sun Jul 19 22:10:31 2015 UTC,Play the mass effects and kotor.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dv8cj,naliao,2,Sun Jul 19 23:15:45 2015 UTC,Pillars and Origonal Sin are great RPGs

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dv8cj,Kalcoholic,5,Mon Jul 20 19:40:28 2015 UTC,"Play The Witcher 3, or you can wait for Fallout 4 if you want something new.  Don't buy FFXIII, just trust me on that one. It ain't good.  Fallout NV is probably better than Fallout 3 gameplay and story wise, and personally I preffer the atmosphere in NV. It's more of a Noir-Western mix, if that makes any sense, and it's really cool. Seriously, if you liked 3, play this one.  Witcher 3 is also really cool, I liked it alot. The story is good, but it can get slow at parts, but that doesn't matter when there is a ton of side content. It also has an open world, unlike it's predecesors, and has really good combat. If you liked 2, then you will love The Witcher 3.  Other RPG's I would recomend:  Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3  Dragon Age 1 and 3  Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2  Final Fantasy VI (Only if you want to try a JRPG)  Fire Emblem, if you got a 3DS  Deus Ex: Human Revolution (forgot this one, thanks /u/Vicot17)  If you want something atmospheric, try the Metro games. Super cool post apocaliptica in Russian metro tunnels, it's pretty rad.  Have fun with whatever you choose man!"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dv8cj,InvalidArgument56,5,Sun Jul 19 21:35:54 2015 UTC,"I was interested in Dragon Age 3 so I might look that one up.  Also, have you played Deus Ex Human Revolution? Is it any good?"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dv8cj,InvalidArgument56,3,Sun Jul 19 21:53:05 2015 UTC,"DE:HR is a fantastic RPG that I should have included on that list. I love it to bits, and I would highly recomend it. If you do get it, get the directors cut so you don't have to deal with tfhe terrible boss fights. It's my favorite FPSRPG by far.  BTW, if you haven't played The Witcher 3, pick that up instead of Inquisition. It's a much better game in almost all respects.   Edit: What's below is false. Read the comment by /u/Merodach.  However, if you are on a budget I think Inquisition is on sale at Origin, I could be wrong though. Or you could just play Deus Ex, it's cheap now."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dv8cj,Merodach,2,Sun Jul 19 22:05:22 2015 UTC,"DA:I isn't on sale at the moment (and has only reached a minimum of $30 in the past). However, Witcher 3 is on sale for $29.99 (gog redeemable) at green man gaming, in the VIP tab (I believe you need an account with GMG to view it). Deus Ex is the least expensive, at $20 on Steam, with no discount."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dv8cj,Grug16,2,Sun Jul 19 21:59:29 2015 UTC,"If you liked the first game, then definitely play them all in order and try to carry your save file through.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dv8cj,RoarYo,3,Sun Jul 19 22:03:30 2015 UTC,"I've played a few classes, and Vanguard was always my favorite.

It gets even better in ME3 when you can add Nova into the mix."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dv8cj,frayuk,2,Mon Jul 20 02:53:07 2015 UTC,Definitely play 1 and 2 before 3.

Definately don't play 3 without the others, though, since you won't have the context to understand what's happening."

The story isn't overly complicated but still engaging, the music and art style is great, and the battle mechanics don't get boring because of the combo system which lets you combine abilities between 2-3 characters for a coordinated attack. You could just play with the same 3 characters for most the game but it's more fun trying out every possible party combination to see all the different combo attacks.

The training modules barely scratch the surface of the game, which in turn makes the game a bit tricky to figure out. However, it can get repetitive at after a while. Not to say that takes anything away from the game, it's still amazing.   Another issue is freezing, although I don't as much any more after I turned orbit lines off in the settings.  The game is only $30 dollars right now because it's in preview, but it's expected to raise to $60 when it officially launches(don't worry, if you buy it in preview you will still have the game and won't have to pay full price). Also, xbox one is getting a PVP matchmaking mode for the game really soon.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dw0tf,Mikegrann,3,Mon Jul 20 01:49:56 2015 UTC,"Crawl is a fun dungeon crawling game made for multi-player. Basically, one person is your hero, and the other people play as ghosts, who posses mobs and traps. The ghost who kills the hero gets to be the next hero, while the previous hero turns into a ghost. This goes on until you get to the boss fight, then whoever kills the boss wins. It's super fun, and I highly recomend it. It is only supports up to 4 players, so you might not consider it.  TorchLight 2 is also cool. Its diablo, but better.  If you like quiz games, fibbage is fun for parties and stuff."

It is undisputedly the best game to come out of that franchise.   The Metro series is more combat-based than A:I. There's still an aspect of survival but far less than Isolation. You are usually the hunter and not the hunted."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dtsos,umiumi8,4,Sun Jul 19 14:30:27 2015 UTC,"My vote is for Metro. While Alien Isolation provides an interesting cinematic experience, I thought the pacing was very slow and there's not enough to do to keep me motivated in playing.  On the other hand, Metro is more action-oriented with a degree of challenge at times, and the world is lush with story. The diagetic interface of Metro is done really well, too. With the redux package, bundle and save. Likely to be more play-time, as well."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dtsos,Kojaks,3,Sun Jul 19 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"Metro Redux.  Literally some of the best games I've ever played.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dtsos,zim1985,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:25:19 2015 UTC,"Both are good. Alien is more of a stealth game. The one caveat I would give for Metro Redux is that the game is not all that different than the original. The improvements are in AI, lighting, and a newer game engine. It is a definite improvement, but if you have played the original Metro 2033 you aren't going to get any new maps or anything like that."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dtsos,Zoraji,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"I own both and I would always recommend the Metro series.

Pretty much all of the other ones are just side stories that take place before or roughly during the events of both games.  KH: Chain of Memories may be the only one that would be worth a play through between KH I and KH II now that I think about it.

It's a free to play MMOFPS that has 1000 players per continent.  Combined arms aspect (infantry, armor, transports, air vehicles).  Its got a fairly steep learning curve so read up on it a little bit in terms of what to unlock and when. /r/planetside  Battlefield 4 is pretty good now thats its mostly fixed and has received an extension on its dev life from DICE, not nearly as large of a scale as Planetside but still a solid 32v32.  Also combined arms on most maps and game modes. /r/battlefield_4  War Thunder is another free to play thats focused exclusively on vehicles, ranging from early WW2 era to Korean War Era.  Again a fairly steep learning curve here, but you can just play ""arcade"" modes for a very casual experience to learn the ropes. I will say theres some issues with balance once you get into the higher tiers, but thats a long way off from the beginning and I find the most fun is in the earlier tiers anyway.  /r/warthunder"

After you finish the semi cheesy tutorial the story REALLY takes off.  Theres also multiple endings so it has great replayability.  Some RPG elements here and there and really solid shooting mechanics with a great variety of weapons and play styles.  Also the CoD:AW campaign was a pretty good story with beautiful cut scenes.  Would recommend that as well, might be a little pricey for just the campaign as Call of Duty titles prices stay high."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dtnog,Gokuadl1508,2,Sun Jul 19 10:11:49 2015 UTC,"DoW2 is somewhat divisive because of how different it is from DoW1 and most other RTSs. Almost all basebuilding is gone, you control very few units, the scale of the engagements is greatly reduced, and there's an RPG system with loot and unit XP. It plays more like an action RPG than a traditional RTS.  In between missions you manage the loot, level up your guys, and pick where to go next. It has the same physics as CoH, so you can break things with explosives and vehicles.  I had lots of fun with DoW2, but many people don't like the changes.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dsm1a,cyberslifer,11,Sun Jul 19 01:41:06 2015 UTC,"Haven't played Hand Of Fate, have played almost 1500h of CS:GO.  CS:GO has ""endless"" content as it offers you a chance to develop a real skill that is measured against other people, so if the amount of content is important to you, don't worry about CS:GO having too little.     The games are very different as well, so I feel like you should try to think about what kind of game you're looking for at the moment. In your post you said that you're looking for a shooter, which gives me a feeling you're kinda leaning towards CS:GO already. CS:GO is the most popular shooter for PC atm as well, both esports-wise and for casual play.     As for your point about spending money on packs and skins; it's completely unnecessary from a gameplay point of view. The skins add nothing to your capabilities ingame and you will find that you'll do just find without spending a dime else than the original purchase.        However I'm just worried that from what I know, there is only one gamemode of the bomb plant/disarm. It's fun and all but I fear I will get bored of it fast so that's why I'm hesitant.     While it is true that the ""bomb plant/disarm"" gamemode is the overwhelmingly most popular one and the only one being played competitively, there are other modes. The game itself supports a gungame mode, and the community-run servers host a wide spectrum of custom gamemmodes such as skillsurfing (sooo fun!) and bhopping.     TLDR: CS:GO will surely satisfy you, as there is a lot of potential content for a good price.     edit: fixing dat grammar post-sleep."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dsm1a,bigum,5,Sun Jul 19 11:24:35 2015 UTC,"The two games are completely different. I have both. It just depends on which sounds best to you.   Csgo is multi-player and a highly competitive fps. It is a ton of fun but I couldn't handle the pressure to be good nor did I want to put in the time. So if you can get past that then you will have a lot of fun.   Hand of fate is a rogue lite with the skill being batman arkham combat and your choice in cards for your deck. There is a lot of luck in the game, like most rogue likes, so you will lose for no reason,but when you lose you still usually get new cards if you managed to earn ""tokens""  during your playthrough. You will usually get tokens on every playthrough,so you will usually get new cards each playthrough. The combat is easy compared to other games, but I play on the hardest difficulty, and you can lose the game quickly if you lose focus for  just a few seconds. I like rogue likes, so I prefer hand of fate. But like I said, it comes down to preference."

Then the casual game modes you have death match, arms race (gun game), demolition (kinda shitty but meh) and casual version of standard game type (half rounds, no FF/unit collision etc.).  If it gets its hooks into your competetive side, csgo will give you hundreds of hours playtime. So long as you dont mind Russians.   Also, weapons from crates etc. Are purely cosmetic."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dt5pt,SatiricalAussieAsian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:09:37 2015 UTC,"GTA V on PC has additional missions/content inserted at different points in the story mode. I haven't replayed story mode on PC yet so I'm not exactly sure how much extra content there is, but my partner finished it and said it was worth replaying (we both finished it on 360 first). Then you've also got online mode which is a lot of fun, especially if you have a couple of friends to do heists with, etc. Plus online mode is still being updated with extra content every few weeks, so there's that.  I haven't heard anyone raving about Dying Light. The general consensus amongst my friends is that it's...okay. I haven't played it myself but I watched my partner play it a lot and it seems to me like a lot of the same thing, from what I saw a lot of the missions involve just going from point A to B. The parkour system isn't perfect but it does the job. I won't say you'll dislike it, but I probably wouldn't pay full price for it.  Honestly I just see a lot more value for money with GTA, but if you've already finished the story on 360 and have no interest in playing online I'm not sure it's worth the re-buy."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3druwn,RexRevolver,9,Sat Jul 18 21:19:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Thief games offer a lot of the same kind of depth. In fact a lot of the same folks worked on both games. Whether you'd like Thief, though, really depends on what you liked about Deus Ex. If you liked the variety of weapons, or the customization of your character through various upgrades, or running-and-gunning your way through levels, then probably no. If you liked complex level design with multiple paths to reach an objective, and you found yourself sneaking around and either attacking through stealth or not at all, then probably yes.  Early in Deus Ex, on Liberty Island, Paul offers you a choice of three weapons. The weapon you chose here might be a good indicator of whether or not you'd like the Thief games.  Did you choose the GEP gun? Maybe Thief isn't right for you. Think about Bioshock instead.  Did you choose the sniper rifle? Okay, now you're thinking a little more like Thief. Reconnaissance and engaging targets at range is kind of Thiefy. Still, sniper rifles are deadly, which is not very Thiefy, and worse, they're loud, which is definitely not Thiefy.  Did you choose the mini-crossbow? If so, please proceed directly to Thief. The mini-crossbow lets you attack at range, it's completely silent, and you can choose lethal, non-lethal, or even utility rounds (with the flare darts). Avoiding confrontation, killing only when necessary, using a variety of specialized tools to make your job easier, and above all staying undetected -- that's what Thief is all about."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dsyms,gazoom44,2,Sun Jul 19 03:55:33 2015 UTC,"I finished Witcher 2 two weeks ago and I have just started Witcher 3 so I can give you some fresh impressions.  There is a continuity of timeline and you are the same witcher in the same world. Like the previous game there are strong story lines with well developed characters.   The world feels much bigger and more open to me and is full of mini side objectives such as monster nests and hidden treasures to plunder. If you have played Far Cry 3 or Batman Arkham this will feel familiar in that you can ignore the main quest for quite a while as you just wander about completing side objectives.  The graphics are much better, stunning in fact.  One nice thing that struck me is the attention to detail in the characters. Even minor characters are well fleshed out and well acted (I'm playing in English). It all feels very believable.  The interface is streamlined compared to the first game and feels more polished.   You have a horse for transport and even a bit of combat. This is a fun addition even if it isn't all that essential. There are fast travel signposts all around the game world.  Sword combat is quite similar to Witcher 2 with blocking, fast and strong attacks and counter attacks. Signs have changed quite a bit though and feel weaker. The all powerful yrden which saw me through Witcher 2 is now just a slowdown instead of a stun. I am only level 4 however so perhaps signs get better later.  The levelling up process is very different. There are the same four disciplines (combat, signs, alchemy and Witcher skills) but instead of getting permanent upgrades to your character you get equippable upgrades with a very limited number of slots. This allows great flexibility, you can change your slotted upgrades more or less at will but the low number of slots can be frustrating because you have to chose which upgrades to leave out.  I still haven't fully figured out alchemy but it appears that you only have to make any item once. All items you have made appear to be replenished using a generic resource (strong alcohol) when you meditate. You can now swig potions in combat but they have much shorter time spans (often only a few seconds) and there is a very limited number you can carry.  Tldr: my first impressions are that Witcher 3 feels like a bigger more polished game that builds on the earlier games but also borrows from other excellent games (such as Far Cry and Batman Arkham)."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dqut2,knaefraktur,2,Sat Jul 18 17:45:05 2015 UTC,"Payday 2 is an amazing game whith new content being released quite regularly. It's pure coop and you won't be playing single player until you know a heist pretty well (some enjoy going back to heists to try and solo them which can be a lot of fun).  There are quite a few DLCs, but don't let that scare you. They go on sale often and you don't really need all of them either. The maps that are connected to DLCs can be played by anyone, it's just the host that needs it.  I would recommend playing with friends, or atleast a premade. If you don't have any RL friends who wants to play you can check /r/paydaytheheistonline for others to play with. I found so many people right there that I have played with.  There isn't really a tutorial, but there are people who like to help if you just ask beforehand. The in-game VoIP works fine for this. There are also many guides on steam (some really suck but others are good) and here on reddit there are many helpful players. Check out /r/paydaytheheist (for example there is a noob question thread sticky up) and /r/paydaymeta for more in-depth guides.  Overall I really like this game, I've spent many hours in it. Even though once you play all the heists you might consider the game done, in my opinion you aren't. There are 333 achievements that gives players a chance to do heists in different ways and with weird loadouts. Compared with release there are also soooo many heists now to complete and the highest difficulty is quite difficult."

The missions range from super easy to super hard, depending on how you approach them (stealth or ""loud""). However playing by yourself isn't enjoyable, and neither is playing with randoms for the most part.  If you can get the game on sale (it frequently goes on sale on Steam) then feel free to pick it up, but again I recommend playing with friends - especially if you don't take it seriously.

It's not an endless horde of enemies coming at you and it's actually difficult if you ramp it up to Overkill or Death Wish setting. Some heists are even difficult on Very Hard.  Also there are so many ways to do each heist! Random elements in each map keep things refreshing and that's on top of the fact that there are already a ridiculous number of heists and variations.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dqut2,dirtyLizard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:44:29 2015 UTC,"I say yes. It's really fun.

If you feel the same about the game, then go for it. The fact that BL2 currently has more DLCs, and the GOTY edition is generally cheaper than The Pre-Sequel, also work in favor of picking BL2 over TPS.  On the other hand, if you pick The Pre-Sequel, it's going to be a new experience for both of you (though TPS is not too different from Borderlands 2). And also, do you think there would be a big difference of paces between you replaying BL2 and your girlfriend playing it for the first time?

It might be because I'm borderlands fatigued, but alot of reviewers didn't like it either and the general consensus is that it's the lame duck of the series, but if you want a new experience with the same general mechanics as Borderlands 2 then you'd probably enjoy it.  If you want a completely new experience in the Borderlands Universe, go play the first one. It's still quite fun, and there's co-op in it. I really like the characters in the first one much better than the ones in 2 and 3, although the story isn't as good and the ending was terrible. The enviroments are super samey, always a desert wasteland. Also, Borderlands 2 improved some things, so if you want the better gameplay experience go with 2.  Also, some other good co-op games you can get:  Castle Crashers  Minecraft (consoles have local co-op)  Little Big Planet if you got a ps3 or 4  Halo, if you got a 360 or X-Bone  Magica 1 & 2  Rocket Legue has Split-Screen and is super fun, been a real hit at my place.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dq3dc,Exxec71,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:03:49 2015 UTC,FYI both on sale at green man gaming today.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dq3dc,Ajeh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:34:04 2015 UTC,Thus my question ;)
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dq3dc,Mithridates12,2,Sat Jul 18 13:42:15 2015 UTC,Ah well I've heard BL2 is best of series while more hardcore fans seem to like TPS for the difference in mechanics.   IMHO I'd start from One and play all three they're all good with company.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dq3dc,slpngsun,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:09:56 2015 UTC,"Fundamentally, 2 is better than TPS. I liked TPS and it added new guns and mechanics as well as a good story (arguably) but 2 is longer and has the Tiny Tina DLC. TPS has more dialogue though as your characters add to the story so if you want to be engaged in a story with your GF than go for TPS and if you want to talk and stuff go for 2."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dq3dc,stapless,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:28:42 2015 UTC,I was in the same situation as you and I decided to go with the BL2 GOTY edition. Many people are saying that it's the best and given the price it was an easy decision. If I like it I might get TPS later on.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dq3dc,Nebbymod,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:39:08 2015 UTC,"Borderlands 2 is WAY better than Pre-Sequel, i enjoy it much more than Sequel."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dq3dc,chetoflep,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:11:25 2015 UTC,BL2 is way better in my opinion
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dq3dc,ENM173,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:38:15 2015 UTC,"Get The Handsome Collection, comes with BL2 and TPS for a great price with all of the DLC."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dq3dc,chetoflep,0,Mon Jul 20 15:19:44 2015 UTC,"BL2, hands down, no question.  TPS was a huge disappointment as a fan of the series."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3drwbn,CourierThree,6,Sat Jul 18 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"I have had this on my wishlist since release. I watched some streams of the game when it first came out, and it looked great. Couldn't wait to get it. Then a friend gifted me a copy. That was over a week ago and I have put about 5 hours into it. Most of that time was because I felt obligated. Don't buy this game yet."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3drwbn,likeswhatido,3,Sun Jul 19 00:01:30 2015 UTC,"Not in its current state, I couldn't recommend it."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3drwbn,boonie125,2,Sat Jul 18 21:39:09 2015 UTC,"Some people find this game playable, but in its current state, I can only maintain 60 FPS by reducing the settings to low and a lower resolution than 1080p. I wouldn't mind, but the game is absolutely hideous. Furthermore - and I can confirm this - if you are running a Crossfire setup (two or more AMD cards), the game won't support it.  The game is getting frequent updates, but I would wait until next year to get it. It's basically unplayable to many people, and it seems optimization is not high on the dev's priority list. Decent amount of content, I guess, but I still don't think anyone should run in and support it during early access.  Simple as: if the devs aren't going to make the game playable, you shouldn't buy it until it is. That's the same principle anyone would apply to any game outside of EA, and I think you should do the same for this."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3drwbn,Dragonzeanse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:07:43 2015 UTC,"I've got a 970 4gb, but you make a great point. I won't be buying it"

ShouldIbuythisgame,3drwbn,dadillsta,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:02:07 2015 UTC,"To counter that, I can run it on Medium at 1080p between 40 - 60 FPS with an i5-750 and a GTX 960 so performance isn't that bad for me. They are also releasing an update to improve performance even more on Nvidia's end so I'd imagine it would run fine."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3drwbn,JAVI-BOT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:20:29 2015 UTC,But is it worth actually playing?
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dqa4w,harrys11,2,Sat Jul 18 12:04:34 2015 UTC,"EVOL is happening now, so there are still many people playing the game (some pros are from the EU). One thing to be aware of is SF5 will be out Mar 2016. When the new game release, quite a lot of players will switch, while some core players will remain, just like every other fighting game.    Gameplay wise, it depends if you prefer to have each hit/counter matters (street fighter), or if you like combo chains (Guilty Gear and Blazblue).    Watch some gameplay videos with commentary and see if you like the style."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dqa4w,A_Light_Spark,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:41:51 2015 UTC,Did they readd the gallery in this one?
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dqa4w,seriphin86,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:24:30 2015 UTC,Amazing game. Tough at first but gets easier as you go. A long learning curve but it is well worth it.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dqa4w,AceninjaNZ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:32:39 2015 UTC,"I would say go for it, it's incredibly fun albeit fairly challenging in the beginning (although it's arguably the easiest fighter to get into). The community is interesting checkout r/kappa or r/streetfighter. It's not that difficult to find games online, but you might find yourself spend a few extra minutes picking your opponent based on Internet speed. Definitely get it if you have a friend irl who plays or a local club, the game is infinitely more fun when playing in person. My experience with it, I spend my time online or in training mode practicing, and play weekly in person with friends where it's the most fun."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dqa4w,Fluggerbutter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:27:49 2015 UTC,"It's the best fighter out there period. It has a huge 44 roster of characters, constant balance tweaks and a huge amount of depth for you to learn. Keep in mind though that the game only really pays off when you invest time to learn it and learning requires losing many, many times."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dq8u0,darkfuji,3,Sat Jul 18 11:43:26 2015 UTC,"Try Hearthstone maybe, i don't exactly know how it's servers work, but since it is turn based I don't think server lag would matter that much."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dq8u0,Emobannana,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:26:51 2015 UTC,"I used to play hearthstone, but I ended up feeling like too much of a time commitment was required to keep up."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dq8u0,PrydeRage,2,Sat Jul 18 13:47:58 2015 UTC,Any of the TrackMania games maybe? They're really awesome racing games and since the multiplayer is basically just getting the fastest time this game should be quite playable. You can't collide with other people so if they lag on your screen it doesn't matter a bit. I'd recommend getting one of the TrackMania 2 games (there are 3 of them and they differ mostly in setting and car handling so definitely check out some YT gameplay before making up your mind)
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpkjw,newslooter,10,Sat Jul 18 05:23:55 2015 UTC,"I regret spending money on this one folks. It's an endless currency farming treadmill that has you repeating the same content over and over again. Grouping is difficult, as you level up you can only play with others at your current power level, so anyone significantly above or below your Prestige (gear score) will be unable to play with you due to the game's very linear progression system.   By the way, that currency system is capped every week, so there is a linear growth in progression week to week that really doesn't do anything to motivate and keep players playing. Once you hit that cap, you're done for the week. You can then farm for visual skins/costumes (your guessed it, more currencies) but that's even more laborious farming of the same content.   The only positives from my perspective is the game has a unique world with some beautiful zones and interesting and varied classes. That's about it.   It's also still in BETA, so the game still has its fair share of bugs, including one that allowed some players to get all 7 days of login rewards all in one go by switching zones.  It's free, so try it. But don't let them fool you into spending money on it."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpkjw,ndimoro,-5,Sat Jul 18 06:44:31 2015 UTC,"Eh. I've heard that you can really only cap your gems if you play a SHIT ton. I know a friend who constantly used EXP boosts and still didn't reach the cap. Doesn't seem to be a problem IMO. In every MMORPG there are weekly caps in some ways, but at least this game doesn't push that because of subscription costs.   Also, I'm sure the game will take some type to balance these types of things perfectly like you said. I would never spend money in a beta stage--and it's not like the game is really asking you to spend money. Sounds like you just were impatient with your money, like you bought in early. So it doesn't really sound fair accusing them of fooling you, when you voluntarily invested anyway."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpkjw,ndimoro,3,Sat Jul 18 15:15:11 2015 UTC,"You can cap all currencies as a free to play player in a few days of casual play. As a premium member this happens 50% faster. Also, I played the game in alpha and early release for many weeks and I gave a very unbiased opinion of my experience with the game. There are no exp boosts, there is no exp in this game. You seem to have not even played the game, so I don't know why you believe you can recommend it.   Regardless, you can only choose from three basic classes at the beginning, and in order to unlock the other classes you need to gain sparks (capped currency) to progress through the ascension atlas, a massive grindey talents and combat stats web. This takes at least 2 weeks (very few have gotten a new class in one week) for your first class unlock then a few more weeks for your second depending on what classes you choose and how far from your current location in the Atlas.   Some people might be put off by this, and think it's worth buying the collectors edition to gain immediate access to a couple additional classes. Don't. Just don't spend the money. That's what I mean by don't let them fool you into spending money."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpkjw,ckhawks,-3,Sat Jul 18 17:06:25 2015 UTC,"Eh. I still don't see your general point being that valid. They didn't fool people into buying things. It's FTP. You have a choice. If your point is for people not to be stupid like you and not waste money, then sure. But don't blame the game.   I don't know why people are always so quick to bash games like this and stomp them into the ground. Let's all play WoW and keep it going for another 30 boring years. At least this game tries something different."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpkjw,logicaldreamer,2,Sat Jul 18 19:54:35 2015 UTC,You said StarForge in the post...?
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpkjw,dragontology,2,Sat Jul 18 06:15:32 2015 UTC,Sometimes people get excited?
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpkjw,Ajeh,2,Sat Jul 18 06:17:11 2015 UTC,"""Skyforge"" is to get the Skyrim fans in the door? Worked for me.  What I don't get is why Bethesda sued Mojang for calling a game Scrolls, but their lawyers were silent when a game came out called ""The Talos Principle,"" invoking the name of the god whose existence in question caused the civil war in Skyrim... My guess is, and I could be completely full of shit, is that the Scrolls suit was so frivolous that, it being tossed led to an open season on other, more legitimate Elder Scrolls terms."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpkjw,ckhawks,2,Sat Jul 18 11:48:00 2015 UTC,"Mojang has more money, and Scrolls in part of the name. On the otherhand Talos is just a piece of lore, and Skyforge was just a location in a city. I doubt they could sue for names that they don't own."

The combat is vastly improved, I also had to stop playing DA:O because of it. It is action combat this time around which is much more fun than turn based for me. It also has a semi open world where you can use a map to travel to smaller open world areas for quests and there is a lot of variety and detail in each environment. Some of the quests are a bit grindy but there is a lot of content to be explored."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpqu3,Xeran,2,Sun Jul 19 03:55:19 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls 1 and 2 are playable with controllers (better than keyboard and mouse). A real struggle to get into because of the somewhat difficult controls and mechanics. But it's a really nice game once you get going, very rewarding."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpqu3,Kojaks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:22:09 2015 UTC,"Second for Dark Souls series. Dark Souls 1 takes a little software (easy google) to get the gamepad working (also needs DSFix mod), but it is worth it."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpqu3,Poison_Fooding,2,Sat Jul 18 21:14:09 2015 UTC,Technically you can make any game controller compatible using a program called Xpadder. I use it on nearly all my PC games.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dp85s,iffy360,4,Sat Jul 18 15:36:45 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend Stalker Series. It's like an alternative to the fallout series. Great story and great environment and I believe that a couple of programmers from the Metro Series had previously worked on the stalker series. Great dark Russian feel.   If you decide on the Stalker series, I also recommend Singularity if you want the dark Russian gritty feeling.   I also recommend the Splinter Cell series. It was an awesome challenge when it first came out. However, the gameplay style started changing after Double Agent. When Conviction came out, I was completely thrown off. It was fun though but it felt different mainly because of two mechanics, you can't pick up bodies and you can't pick up sticky cameras. I haven't played Blacklist yet."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dp85s,TextbookLearning,2,Sat Jul 18 08:02:19 2015 UTC,"Stalker seems awesome, but I'm kindof intimidated by it. Is there any mods I should download with the game?"

The screen got all shaky and and it kept zooming onto the creature. I had no clue what to do and died trying to kill it. Freaked me out."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dp85s,TextbookLearning,2,Sat Jul 18 11:34:38 2015 UTC,"It's not that the game is scary, in fact I love this type of horror. The thing that intimidates me is the difficulty, that's really it.  Also I worry it's going to feel dated."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dp85s,knighmare,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:35:51 2015 UTC,Ah. The difficulty wasn't that bad that I recall.    Also I worry it's going to feel dated.   Then I guess I should warn you. Stalker has a special place in my heart and I am going by nostalgia alone. I believe Stalker has graphics mods if you feel that it's dated but the combat gameplay is your typical first person shooter and the exploration part feels like your standard Fallout game.

And if you liked it then:   Thief is a great stealth game Styx master of shadows is also awesome The Hitman series, blood money is the best, but Absolution is the latest and has much better graphical fidelity The original deus ex is great, don't play invisible war or the fall though. They are both pretty bad You may like Payday 2, but it can be a very different game because of multiplayer If you like any FPS then Wolfenstein the New Order is just great   Hope this helps"

They basically took one cool segment from bioshock 1 and then stretched it out, and a lot of mechanics werent very polished.  Like the little and big sisters for example.  For little sisters you have to basically protect her from waves of enemies several times, exhausting much of your ammo and then regardless of if you eat her or not youre usually attacked by a big sister (for me it was every time when I played but I heard somewhere it was largely random.)  Honestly to my mind it just lost a lot of the impact and overall fun the first bioshock had for me."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpa3i,Amrior,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:29:13 2015 UTC,No. It's a bad game. They pretty much just slapped the Elder Scroll name on a generic MMO to sell copies. I pretty much asked for my money back for still being a broken mess. It's probably fixed now but I still wouldn't because support was pretty rude to me.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpce6,Regilppo,-2,Sat Jul 18 04:30:23 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. The game is mostly the same with nice updates, but the character sprites are awful reinditions of someone else.

The superior version imho is the snes one as it has the best quality music, no load times, and that wonderful jumpscare effect when you get an encounter.   The gba version graphically is the same game with extra content but the gba has a noticably worse sound card. But if you never heard the original music and sfx,  you probably won't be bothered.  The mobile version comes off as an untested  and blatant cash grab seeing how everyone's progress got softlocked halfway in the game. I'm sure that was fixed but i mean it's super obvious they didn't test it, they just changed the sprites and added mobile controls. I also dislike the look of those hd sprites. Everyone looks so angry.  If you have to pick between the two then I suggest the gba version.  FFVI is a great game and one of square's best rpgs imho. It's not perfect but it doesn't feel dated. I hope you enjoy it regardless of which version you get."

I feel like any shortcomings that it had on release and for a long time after have been fixed by the very active dev team (Similar amount of updates as WoW I'd say).  The main problem I had with it for a long time (loot, basically why most people play the game) got completely overhauled, and they're always looking at which class needs work to be viable/better/not roken. Another big change is coming in the next patch (on PTR right now) which is overhauling legendaries (again) to make endgame more flexible and also extending the endgame, as people got way overgeared for the current levels of difficulty.  In terms of what you asked about: enjoyment is of course subjective, so I don't think anyone can help you find something that you specifically will enjoy, unless you say what you've enjoyed in the past or whatever. I've also never played PoE, so I can't compare the two. D3 has a starter edition, I say check it out, PoE is also F2P so you should try that as well, I should get around to it one of these days."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpbny,FluffyNights,20,Sat Jul 18 03:50:18 2015 UTC,"I stopped reading after you called the witcher 3 a skyrim ripoff. Do you call every open world rpg with quests a skyrim ripoff? The only thing skyrim did was make every triple a rpg from the past four years a massive map with absolutely nothing interesting to do because developers today think that boasting the ""size"" and ""amount of content"" sells their games even if the majority of that content is absolutely meaningless. The witcher 3 is the exact opposite of this and takes the bland formula that's been plaguing the gaming community for so long and turns it into an incredibly detailed and immersive experience. There are literally no filler or fetch quests to be found. Every experience has it's own intricate backstory and most manage to tie in to the main storyline and make your time spent on that side quest feel worthwhile. The amount of effort put into every single encounter astonishes me and makes me actually care about what's going on. Of course, I recommend playing the first two games to get some context, but that's not entirely necessary as the game does a good job at giving exposition. So yes, I absolutely reccomend the witcher 3 as it far outclasses the other games in that list and you'll see why.   (Sorry if I come out as pretentious or hostile, but I'm just so sick and tired of people calling every open world game a skyrim ripoff as if bethesda revolutionized the genre. I hope you have fun with whatever game you choose :D)"

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpbny,benshark69,0,Sat Jul 18 05:24:37 2015 UTC,"""Seems"" was the key word there.  This is obviously all coming from someone that haven't played the game and that doesn't know much about it. If I hated it for being similar to Skyrim, I wouldn't put it on a list of games I might want to buy. From my understanding (and the reviews I read), though, the gameplay changed radically between Witcher 2 and Witcher 3 - and became drastically more similar to Skyrim that it previously was. Again, this isn't a bad thing: it's actually what I'm looking for.  As for /u/benshark69 : I don't really see the problem in me mentioning Sims-like activities... That's something I like - crucify me. Skyrim offers some of these things: buying/building/furnishing houses, marriage, adoption, ""relationship"" (making quests boosts people's opinion of you), etc. It's not ridiculously irrealistic to ask for a game with similar aspects. I have no idea what your gaming tastes include, but I highly doubt you have any right to make fun of anyone for liking simulation options in a video game. If you don't want to answer my question, you can be an adult about it and just ignore the post."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dpbny,GothamRoyalty,3,Sat Jul 18 13:23:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wasn't trying to make fun of you, but the term ""ripoff"" just makes it sound like you're putting off the game before even trying it."

That would explain the price.  I didn't like Witcher 2. It pissed me off to the point where, I'll allow, I might be making a mistake, I'm not even interested in 3.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dnhve,viktorlogi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:47:41 2015 UTC,"If you haven't bought any yet, I have some light to shed on two of those:   Age of Wonders 3 is a great 4x, but if you're looking for diplomacy heavy playstyles it will fall short. The game is much more focused on the tactical combat and the spells you can wield to do all sorts of fun things. Great game, but not really diplomatic. Endless Legend is a really good 4x, there's a lot to it and diplomacy is more robust... but they cost you techs to unlock the actions, and the actions cost a new resource, influence. What this means is that if you want to play heavy diplomacy, you'll have to plan for it and build your infrastructure around it.   I have not played any might and magic games, so based on my experience, and given your explicit statement of wanting diplomacy options, I recommend Endless Legend. However, if you're willing to consider options other than what you listed you might look into Crusader Kings II, it's not strictly 4x and certainly not fantasy, but it is arguably all diplomacy and the sheer amounts of shenanigans you can pull in it are remarkable though. This recommendation comes with a few severe caveats though, first it has a rather steep learning curve, and the graphics are.... minimal?"

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dlszv,elemeo12,5,Fri Jul 17 08:42:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's one of my biggest regrets last year. I bought it so I could play it with my brother, but the game (when I played it, back in late 2014) was horrible in my opinion. The only redeeming factor was, perhaps, the huge world, but even so I hardly played enough to explore more than a tiny bit of it.  However, the car handling felt atrocious to me. I spent a few hours to find some proper settings for both controller and wheel (G27) and nothing felt right (I can't precisely remember what aspects of it bothered me though, as it's been more than six months). But keep in mind that they've added atributes to each car, including how well it handles, which (according to comments I read at the time) was suspected to be the reason behind the poor handling/controls.  Regarding the AI, it was crap for one single reason that made me put the game down: It fucking cheats. They implemented a catch-up mechanic that is mind-blowingly stupid, causing cars behind you to gain unnatural speed/acceleration boosts which made police chases a pain in the ass. I would cut a corner and they would be too late to respond to this, but as soon as they'd turn around they'd catch up in no time. I'm telling you, it was so fucking obvious when you looked behind you and saw these cars going so fast until they reached you. (Reading the comment by Farscape29, this might have been fixed)  A final thing to consider is the way cars are unlocked - some of them are really expensive and supposed to be a real grind to get. However, Ubisoft has Premium Credit that you can purchase (oh joy!) for their $60 retail game, allowing you to unlock cars faster by spending real money!  I don't know if they've patched the game since then or made improvements, but I honestly doubt it. If they haven't, then I advice you to stay away."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dlszv,suppr0,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:25:52 2015 UTC,"For that price, yes. I got it a couple of months ago severely reduced and it's been fun. Many of the launch problems with the AI rubberbanding and catching up have been fixed. Some of the races later on like the ice roads are horribly frustrating, but by the time you get to those, you'll have the skills to eventually win. It takes multiple tries (again, just the ice road races) but you will win.  PVP is a bit of a mess for my tastes, but it's ok in order to just get the points for competing.  It is a BEAUTIFUL open world to explore. I've hit max level 50, so now I spend my time driving around to get all the landmarks.  It is a fun game. The cars are cool. People are pretty friendly from what I've found. Although I did have a run in with an idiot, but it was the only time.   Bottom Line: Get it, you'll have fun."

The gunplay is pretty good, but you have to do so much boring shit it's just not worth it.  Not to mention that for a persistent online world it is incredibly lifeless. You can't really communicate with anyone else easily and it just adds to the barren lifelessness of the world.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dn1zv,CZtheDude,2,Fri Jul 17 16:34:04 2015 UTC,"There's not really much to loot at all. In the main story you unlock new weapons as the story progresses, and in multiplayer as you level up.  That being said, the story is pretty damn good. Gameplay is fun, graphics are fantastic and there's tons of other activities to take part in outside of the main storyline. Hunting, tennis, golf, various kinds of racing etc.  On the multiplayer side things are good too. Lots of custom races or deathmatch levels added by the community.  However, it's not very similar to the games you mentioned you liked loot-wise. I think you'll definitely enjoy messing around in multiplayer with friends though!  You do level up some skills though, for example the more you shoot the more stable your aim gets, stuff like that, but not in terms of unlocking or upgrading abilities.  Based on your interests I wouldn't recommend it for you, unless you want to cause mayhem with friends."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dn1zv,SingleServingFriend-,2,Fri Jul 17 17:54:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah doesn't really sound like my kind of game, especially when I don't have any friends to play with online. Thanks for your input! I might just get it if it goes on sale some time in the future."

I was actually considering naming this thread ""SIB GTA V or The Witcher 3 if I like..."" but decided GTA V was the game I needed more info about.  TW3 does look nice, but since I own both TW and TW2 and played them for maybe an hour altogether, I decided to some day play through those first before splurging out 60 bucks on TW3. I looked into getting TW3 last night but I think it's still a little expensive (I very rarely buy a full priced AAA game). Found it cheapest on GreenManGaming for 30 bucks, but I always try to get games when they're super cheap, like Daily Deals and so on.  I ended up getting Mount & Blade: Warband and DLC, if anyone is curious.  Thanks again!"

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dkite,jirving93,39,Fri Jul 17 00:32:08 2015 UTC,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a great contender. The game has a touching story but mainly proves that game mechanics alone can make you emotional. Short but well worth the price (plus it goes under $10 during sales)

And this is from someone that loooves emotionally challenging games. I went into it expecting feels, but didn't really get them. I think part of it may be the form of gameplay, wherein you control the characters' every action, such that they never actually feel real and developed in their own right. YMMV and all that, though!"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dkite,ezio45,23,Sat Jul 18 15:38:55 2015 UTC,"Since you've played Transistor you should try out Bastion. It's made by the same developers.   To the Moon has an amazing and sad story as well. The soundtrack helps as well.  Papers, Please is pretty good as well. While it isn't as emotional as the others,  the overall tone is just depressing. There are events that challenge your morality.  Valiant Hearts is also really good. It tells the story of four people in World War 1. Very sad and depressing."

If it were a bit cheaper I'd be recommending it left and right, it's very much what you're looking for though.

You can find some in a sewer of one guy saying he will invite  some people in the nearby town to live with him, in a sealed area with I think two clickers, then in the next town you can find a note from those people saying they decided to take his offer.  That being said with rumours of a Last of Us 2 im not so excited. Part of why I liked the story was how unique the characters were and how one of a kind it was.

And honestly, I think the best course of action is just to take a break. You've gotten burned out, and there's nothing wrong with that. But take a month or two, and only play a game if you're actually excited about playing it. Don't just play something if you're bored and feel like you have nothing better to do. It definitely helped for me.  But maybe our situations are different and you've just gotten burned out on open world games. In which case I would recommend Bastion if you haven't already played it. It's fairly short (I beat it in about 4 hours) and does have some collectibles that you can largely ignore, but it's (in my opinion) a master class in game design. It also gave me one of my favorite moments ever in a game (which I can't tell you about because spoilers)."

It's not all open world games that make me feel burned out - just the ones that have map overload and too much stuff for no reason... making the game feel kinda pointless (Batman and the Riddler Trophies, ACIV and the stupid chests and stuff). I loved Far Cry 3/4 cause the map had stuff, but all of it felt kind of progressive/good for the story and the story actually mattered - 4 started leaning towards the unnecessary additions end but I finished it before it felt too much."

The Last of Us or Uncharted fill those requirements exceptionally well. Likewise would be the Tomb Raider reboot. Not entirely sure what genres of games you like best though.  If you still wanna shoot for open world, The Witcher 3 has an incredibly alive feeling one. While sometimes it falls into the vicious cycle of repetitive fetch quests, I feel like there is enough variety to keep things feeling at least moderately fresh. One of the best open world games of all time."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dkeqd,tardmancer,19,Thu Jul 16 23:56:58 2015 UTC,I would suggest Binding of Isaac. I play on a macbook in my lap on the couch. Uses WASD and arrow keys. There's probably some other good dungeon crawlers if you're not into the top down run and gun style.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dkeqd,blovetopia,8,Fri Jul 17 00:57:49 2015 UTC,"Basically anything turn based should work.  If you don't mind low graphics Knight of the old Republic 1 and 2 should be nice.  Guild of Dungeoneering just hit steam and seems to be gathering lots of interest.  Original Fallout games are classics.  Final Fantasy 7 has pretty much a direct port of the PS1 version, but it's Final Fantasy 7 so...  Invisible Inc is a cool rogue likeish Xcom inspired stealth game.  Democracy 3 is actually a pretty fun game where you experiment around and try to make your own country/government. You don't build buildings more edit your goals. It's pretty interesting.  Wasteland 2 might be where you want to look if you want a Fallout styled game with modern graphics.  Pillars of Eternity is fairly similar to Wasteland 2 in the sense that it's pretty much the modern version of Baldur's Gate. (Which FYI would also work well with only a touchpad)  You could always boot up the good old Roller Coaster Tycoon or the sequels.  Audiosurf doesn't need a mouse to play (although if you want to top charts you should use it). You pretty much ride your music to try and get as many points as possible. It's not exactly like Rockband/Guitar Hero where you're playing the song, more that you want to get as many points possible. Best thing is the OST is your own music! Check out the sequel too for custom maps/gamemodes.  Guacamelee! is a fun Metroid-vania game with a really bold art style, I'd recommend it.  Steamworld Dig is a Motherload clone but it's done really, really well. Would recommend over the original flash game for sure.  Tell Tale Games, there might be parts where a mouse is needed but they should work well enough with just a touchpad. Newer ones aren't really point and click as much as an interactive story.  Awesomenauts, pretty much 2D Dota/LoL, but the bot match work pretty well, the devs update it, and there's still people playing it online.  Cave Story, can't really go wrong here, one of the best indie games out there.  SpaceChem is a fantastic puzzle game, would work great with a touch pad. Give it a chance I think you'll be surprised.  Burnout Paradise, I know it's hard to think but racing games don't really have to use a mouse at all. The camera is always usually behind. This one just happens to be one of my favourites.  Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed, seems like a Mario Kart ripoff at first, but it'll surprise you how good it is.  Papers Please, only a slight recommend on this one as it's only mouse/touchpad and you might need to make fast movements.  Risk of Rain may be the best rogue like I've ever played and it doesn't need a single thing with mouse (well unless you need to check item stats, works with touchpad).  OlliOlli is pretty much the Skate/Tony Hawk Pro Skater games in 2D.  Don't need a mouse really for anything except maybe menus.  I think that's all I have for now, but if you want I can help narrow it down more if you're looking for a specific style."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dkeqd,CZtheDude,4,Fri Jul 17 16:07:25 2015 UTC,FTL would be a good idea. If you use the hotkeys you really only need to use your mouse sometimes to move crew members and aim weapons. There's a ton of replay value since each map is procedurally generated. It's a roguelike where you have to take your space ship and save the federation from the rebel fleet. It's very lightweight and should work on most systems.

On top of that, they captured it at something like 300fps, so even during slow motion your reload anim is still smooth.  Not sure if it matches all your requirements, it's a tacticool zombie shooter with bullet time. It's still hella fun though."

It's still playable, but I highly recommend you look up the mod DSfix before you play it.  Dark Souls 2 had a better port, but while it made great improvements to the gameplay and and UI design, it's dropped the ball in terms of lore, level design, and enemy design. I suggest you pick up Scholar of the First Sin (essentially the remastered edition of DS2 that comes with all the DLC) as it polishes up a lot of this issues."

You will likely want a controller as well.  DS2 is only vaguely worth it if it's the sins of the first scholar edition, otherwise not no but hell no.  DS2 is not only a far weaker game, but it comes with the lovely need to buy DLC to experience the full story.  Sins comes with the DLC, but it doesn't do much to improve the changes to game design I find most frustrating.  EDIT: I forgot to address your question.  It is my personal opinion that both Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 live up to your description beautifully, while DS2 falls flat on its face regarding rewarding gameplay abd especially on having a deep, interesting world."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3djinb,VaccusMonastica,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:22:55 2015 UTC,"Yes yes and yes.  DS1 is a delightful kick in the face, in a good way of course. DS2 on the other hand is one of my most favorite RPGs. I don't quite know where all the hate comes from but from my PoV it seems to be from bad game balance in the PvP meta. Personally the only gripes I have with it are enemies that don't respawn after a certain point when you need them too when farming for a piece of gear and other things that existed in the first game which also has its issues and game balance problems, but it doesn't change the fact that it's really fucking good.   That said, be ready to persevere if you're new to the series. Especially if you don't like difficult games. Beating this for the first time will feel so satisfying, especially if you give up easy. A lot of people say the second game is easier. I actually don't know how difficult this game is in comparison since a lot of people including myself who say this have played the first game and already have experience from playing the first game to push us forward. In spite of the second game being easier, I don't think you'll go back to the first after playing it so play DS1 first. That's just my own personal opinion and by no way means that you won't go back to the first game.  I'm holding off on First Sin since I already own DS2, but since you don't already have it, I would definitely get it. I don't think you'll see it at this price again for a while.  Disclaimer: I don't PvP much except for fun duels every now and then. I have at most 40-50 duels which isn't a whole lot. I mostly focus on PvE.  Also, I don't know if I'm allowed to mention this so forgive me if I'm breaking the rules, but there's this really nice program called gedosato. You should check it out."

I don't own Rocket League, but it does look really fun; just not quite as cheap as Duck Game. Overall I would say get Duck Game, or to get whichever game more of your friends own. I haven't had a chance to play Duck Game with friends yet, but both Duck Game and Rocket League look to be even more fun with friends."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3djmlv,throwawaymyoldstuff,2,Fri Jul 17 02:11:57 2015 UTC,"I have both, and they both are fun. Depends what you're looking for. Side-scrolling shooter or super fast car soccer. Either way, you'll get intense multiplayer action. Side note: Rocket League likely has more players right now, so it's easier to find a game."

Subnautica is an underwater Minecraft, where you just tool around in a beautiful ocean world.   You might try The Long Dark, where you're lost in a frozen woodland trying to survive the cold and wolves (the wolves can be disabled for a more relaxing experience).   Or nab Skyrim. I mod the shit out of it to make it immersive, removing the HUD, adding weather effects, better sounds and landscape detail... then usually get stoned and just pick flowers or watch animals hunt in the distance.   ...actually, give Mount and Blade a try. You really don't need sound at all (and it gets really repetitive anyway), so throw on some music and try to conquer the world like an upstart Alexander the Great. It's an amazing game.   The shooter part is tough. If you want something you can just throw any music over, zone out and shoot things check out Painkiller: Black Edition, Ziggurat or Far Cry 3/4."

I played it far after release, so whatever problems it had immediately were sorted out by the time I got to it. But it's still not very good. The story is awful nonsense. It spends too much time as COD-lite. The aliens aren't a scary threat, they're just annoying. I recall liking the single player DLC, but overall, not a good game.  Alien vs Predator is mildly better but still not as good as Monolith's AVP2, which we'll probably never see on Steam. Again, the story is dumb but the variety in the action is better. Aliens are actually a threat to marines. It's okay.  The best of them is Alien: Isolation. It's fantastic. Stealthy, first-person, loads of detail in the environments. Extremely faithful to the source materials. It's great. I'd ditch Colonial Marines and AVP for Alien: Isolation."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3djbev,Eyo27,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:58:46 2015 UTC,The single player portion for the most part is more like a real time party based rpg than an rts. There's no base building and juggling abilities is important.  That said it's a lot of fun and a good amount of content for 20 bucks. I suppose you could wait for a sale and just get the base game cheaper to check it out.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3djbev,TerranFirma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:48:52 2015 UTC,It's pretty good and 40k is a really badass setting.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3djkku,Nitrokila,2,Thu Jul 16 20:04:51 2015 UTC,"It depends. I played Dai when it came out and loved it (not as much as I loved origins, but still). I have 120 hours across 2 characters. That said, the witcher series has held its place with Dragon age and far surpassed it with 3. Going from Dai to witcher 3? Fine. Going from witcher 3 to Dai? I can't help but feel the flaws would be glaringly obvious in comparison. It's still a good game, and worth a playthrough, but I would wait for at least a good sale if not the free ea access thing (is there a trial? Maybe you can grab it with that?).   ESO is an entirely different beast. I haven't played it as much as DAI, but from what I've seen is that, if you have friends to play with its pretty fun even with the standard mmo formula. Alone, not so much, unless you're good at making friends or join a guild. It's a good casual ""hey guys let's go play for a few hours"" game, imo, but to be fair I also burn out of mmos fairly fast without friends to keep me coming back."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3djkku,paragon819,2,Thu Jul 16 22:25:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say DA:I if you're looking for a game similar to the witcher 3. It has combat that isn't as hack and slash, but more tactical. You'll actually need to be thinking about what your doing. Although, I strongly recommend playing through the first game and the second before playing inquisition. Without playing them you will get confused (you can probably skip 2 actually) You can actually pick up origins for pretty cheap and it hold up pretty well, if you need a time sink.  Elder scrolls online is definitely more jump in and play friendly. It's fun, but a little bit more shallow than a lot of single player games. I'd recommend it if you just want to play another rpg and not spend hours getting into the lore.  Tl;dr: Dragon Age will take you longer but is more deep, and ESO you can hop right in but is more shallow."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3djkku,doodle_groon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:16:04 2015 UTC,"I would say DA:I. ESO felt like a boring slog through the same-old-same-old MMO environments with an Elder Scrolls aesthetic. Dragon Age: Inquisition on the other hand greatly improved on Origins and fixed the damage 2 did, which makes it noteworthy for any fan of Dragon Age to at least try out. That and it has countless hours of gameplay if just mucking around for a while is your thing."

No 3D spotting No health regen, both infantry and vehicle You lose the content of your magazine when reloading You can only spawn to your squad leaders No deathcam No 3rd person on vehicles   For me at least this changed the whole deal and made the game actually enjoyable. That and the constant pushes to fix the game and the addition of free content (which is still being developed). I recommend the game at its current state."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dh2iu,marcsa,2,Thu Jul 16 07:09:49 2015 UTC,"I could talk about it for an entire day and still not touch on every point. The short and sweet of it is I, along with other die hard PS1 vets, waited 10 years for that game and it didn't deliver on any of its promises other than it allowed for a lot of players on one map (poorly). They removed every good feature that was in the original and decided it would be better to make a battlefield clone instead. I'm not kidding when I say that if they had simply updated the gunplay from the original then I wouldn't even look at another game for the rest of my life. I followed that game from the moment it released and was in the second Alpha wave and played it until ~4-5 months after launch. They never delivered on anything but a broken lattice system.  IMHO the game was a cash grab to keep the company afloat long enough to be bought it, which it was."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dh2iu,CMvan46,2,Thu Jul 16 07:17:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, valid reasoning. I've played PS1 as well, and am still disappointed in how many lessons they learned from that and just stupidly threw those away. They have been developing on it though, it's not like it was at release anymore, it still has annoying stuff, but we still don't have any game that comes close to it."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dhg70,greenflame239,2,Thu Jul 16 08:29:39 2015 UTC,"If you're deciding mostly just between City and Origins, go with City, as it's a more polished game.  Just FYI, while City on the Wii U is the complete edition, Origins is definitely not, and actually lacks some features like the entire multiplayer mode and a large story DLC."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dhg70,azknight,5,Thu Jul 16 12:23:00 2015 UTC,PC: Arkham City > Arkham Asylum >Arkham Origins > Arkham Knight PC Console: Arkham City > Arkham Origins >Arkham Asylum > Arkham Knight   AAsylum is the best of the series but ACity expanded the game so much that if you buy only one it has to be AC. AKnight is a great game but lack of Boss battles and Challenges Modes weakens it terribly. Looks Great on Console though. AAsylum is a masterpiece and if you get a chance to play it DO IT!! Its has the tightest story by far my ratings are based on what I think a typical non-batman fan would look for in a game that just want to have some fun with Bats.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dhg70,BlackOpz,3,Thu Jul 16 08:50:57 2015 UTC,I can confirm the PC ordering. Arkham City was the best one by far for me.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dhg70,Quantization,3,Thu Jul 16 11:41:11 2015 UTC,"I think what we can all take away from this is don't buy origins. It was definitely playable but it's uninspired. If you finish all the other games and you're jonesing for a new story then I guess play it, but a better game would be shadow of Mordor. It's obviously not a batman game but it uses the same fight mechanics and the nemesis system makes for a good time."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3di9ng,DreamLandMF,10,Thu Jul 16 14:18:27 2015 UTC,This game is probably not for you then. All upgrades (and there are a lot) are achieved by hunting several animals. You also have to deal with the enemy using animals to attack you. And the game sometimes relies on you utilizing animals to take out the enemy.

It's very reminiscent of older action movies and any animals you do hunt are cyber animals or just crazy sci-fi contraptions. Fun all the way through and there are laser T-rexes do definitely worth a shot.

Elephants will never trample you, and I definitely shed a tear when my mounts die, but those wolves and other such things just end up being like any other enemy after a while  I liked the game, was able to beat it, but it did get a little repetitive. It's a gorgeous game and not overly difficult. I enjoyed it for what it was, you probably will too, even with the animal killing."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3di9ng,UwasaWaya,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:45:59 2015 UTC,"Pixels are not animals. Animals are not pixels. You cannot kill any animals in FC4, even if you nuked the island. In FC3, the hunting (and it is hunting) is used to acquire optional (but useful) upgrades that allow carrying more healthkits/ammo/loot/etc. I'm guessing this is similar in FC4, in which case it will not be required, but will be valuable, much as leather and meat have been valuable to hunters since the dawn of time. Few of the animal types in FC3 are ""harmless"", and those that are non-aggressive are likely depictions of ""pest"" animals. Wild pigs (non-aggressive in FC3) can eat crops bare if not hunted, for example - see below. Even most of the 'herbivores' (cassowary, cape buffalo) are dangerous if ignored and aggressive towards the player if allowed to approach too closely! If you find even the depiction of hunting offensive (are you a vegan too?) then this is either not the game for you, or you will be making the game harder on yourself by setting that restriction.   Source on wild pig information from the US."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3di9ng,UwasaWaya,4,Thu Jul 16 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"Pixels are not animals, I am well aware of it, but just like some people dislike violent games, the thought of hurting animals makes me feel uneasy, especially in a realistic 3D game. I am not offended, I just don't want to do it in a game where I'm supposed to have fun.  ""Pixels are not animals. Animals are not pixels."" ""you find even the depiction of hunting offensive (are you a vegan too?)"" I really don't get your point. If something you hated the thought of, let's say necrophilia or child molestation or whatever, was at the core of a realistic game and you had to watch it happening a lot of the time, wouldn't you be hesitant to buy it?"

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dgt0x,Quantization,2,Thu Jul 16 19:49:45 2015 UTC,"ARK: Survival Evolved.  ARK: Survival Evolved is the most complete Early Access title I've purchased, and that says a lot coming from me. Looking at my games library you'll notice I own quite a lot of them. I understand why a lot of developers put out 'unfinished' games, a lot of the time they would otherwise be unable to afford to make their game, ARK however isn't one of those cases. ARK is a largely complete, open world survival game set in a land still ruled by dinosaurs. Well, that was the case before we arrived.  The game doesn't have any actual 'lore' just yet but developers have said they will be adding some type of it in the future. From what I can gather so far, we are some type of entertainment for aliens. We appear on the beach with some type of artifact in our arm that our character seems confused about. There are 3 massive, floating, alien towers hovering around the map that would suggest we are being spectated. These three towers are also used as navigational landmarks by players, making it quite easy to find your friends.  The graphics for this game, whilst at maximum potential are extremely breathtaking, are completely unusable. At maximum graphics even the beefiest of graphics cards will crap themselves. For example I have GTX780 and I get around 11 FPS at maximum settings. On lowest however, I get an unsteady 30-50 frames. Ugly, but completely playable. That said, the developers are putting out updates almost every single day and a lot of them contain optimisation fixes, so fear not, change is coming!  The character creation in this game is solid. You can be a male or female, then you can pick your skin colour, height, muscle size, etc. The only thing that is really 'missing' from this screen would be hair styles. Everyone has the same hair. I believe this will be added in the future. (Fingers crossed for cave man beards!) One issue I have with the customisation of your character is that if you make your character too tall his head will clip through the ceiling of 1 story high buildings. This doesn't affect the camera but if you like to play in third person get used to looking at half a head.  Which leads me to the actual game. This is a really, really fun game to put it bluntly. You start in what you could call the stone age and slowly progress until you're eventually placing automatic turrets in your metallic, air conditioned base. The RPG-styled progression in this game really adds another element to this game that not many survival games can claim to have, and although some of the stats are useless right now, I have no doubt the wonderful developers will update them to be more balanced. Oh and how could I forget to mention; you can capture and tame dinosaurs that will help you do numerous activities like gathering wood, carrying items, transport you quickly around the map, swim and many other things. I wont get too much into this detail because I don't want to spoil the experience for any newcomers.   Of course, after you level up and pick a stat to increase, you will be given a sum of what are known as engram points. An engram is essentially a blueprint. There is one for each item in the game. As you level up you must pick the blueprints that you think will be most useful to you. These range from building pieces, tools, weapons, and a number of other useful items. The thing is, once you hit the maximum level, (65 as of right now,) you will not have nearly enough engram points to create every item in the game. That sucks, right? Wrong. This is a clever, intentional move by the developers to encourage players to work together in is called a tribe.  Tribes are essentially a clan, guild, group, party or whatever other name for it you can think of. Joining a tribe allows you to share your dinosaurs, buildings, items and experience with other tribe members which really adds another fun dynamic to the game. I've spent a large amount of my time in-game playing with real life friends, but when I first started, (probably my first 30 hours played,) I played with total strangers, and you know what? It was a lot of fun. There is a tribe chat system in game, a global chat system and also a location based voice chat system which allows you to communicate with all players in a certain radius around you.  Speaking of community, that is probably the best thing about this game. The community for this game really is excellent with 'most' players preferring to be friendly. In my experience on PVP servers, most players that see you are more likely to say, ""Hey man, do you need anything?"" as opposed to killing you. Also, no hackers at all so far! Unreal Engine 4 is as of right now considered, 'unhackable' but I am not sure whether that will last. Fingers crossed! On top of that, the developers of the game have created their own Reddit sub called /r/PlayArk that they refer to for suggestions as well as their own forums. More than once have I seen a [Suggestion] post hit the front page only to see the exact suggested change in patch notes the very next day. It is extremely impressive to see developers that care enough about their players satisfaction that they are willing to forgo their current work just to make us happy.   In conclusion, this is a surprisingly polished survival game with many RPG and sandbox elements that contains enough replayable content to entertain a player for potentially infinite amount of time. The developers seem to really care about their players and understand that to have a successful game, you need to make the people who play it happy. Although the game need a lot of optimisation, the game is still playable and optimisation is coming.  I truly, highly recommend this game and all survival game lovers will enjoy it immensely.

I loved the dark souls games, in fact Dark Souls is one of Mr favorite games ever.  That said, Bloodborne was amazing on a completely different level. The combat, while it is rooted in the same ""punishing but completely fair"" style, is so different that it's hard to compare out with dark souls. The game itself is much faster paced and rewards you for taking risks instead of hiding behind a shield.  It's fast paced, relatively easy to get the hang of, and so much fun when you finally master it.  I've never played the Witcher, but from what I've gathered, Bloodborne is more akin to a JRPG from a game design standpoint, while the Witcher is a western RPG.  If you enjoy that kind of thing, you should definitely at least try bloodborne."

Also instead of incentivizing war (the single biggest mechanic of the game), every patch makes it more and more punishing. The Art of War almost fixed the issue but it still doesn't fix that the combat is essentially rolling dice.  The issues from EU4, to me, mostly come from the developers not quite understanding what direction EU4 should go in."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3ddo8r,The_Slime,4,Wed Jul 15 15:14:59 2015 UTC,"You didn't underestimate anything. The FX 6300 has single-core performance on par with Nehalem processors from 7 years ago, and is even bested on occasion by its older Phenom II cousins. AMD hasn't made a lot of IPC strides forward in recent times, and they can't wait for DX12 to help alleviate some of that pressure."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3ddo8r,Robert_Skywalker,3,Wed Jul 15 18:59:32 2015 UTC,"That doesn't matter really. The amount of cores you have isn't all that determines performance. Especially in games, lots of cores doesn't mean great performance. Since games only use 1-2 cores typically, then the rest go unused. Because (generally) AMD CPUs have weaker cores and Intel CPUs have fewer, but stronger cores, Intel is recommended for gaming because when the game only uses the few cores, the Intel CPU will outperform. However, when an application uses all the cores, at any budget level below a Xeon/i5 usually the AMD CPU does better because it can use all the cores."

One core is maxed and all the others are at about 50% usage. Regardless of you system you'll always end up getting 20-30 FPS in cities and outside of them fluctuates depending on your CPU. About 50- 60 FPS outside of cities with an average CPU and over 100 FPS, in some cases, with an overclocked CPU. Arma is just random, good luck."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3ddo8r,brainphat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:32:08 2015 UTC,"Low FPS is something that you have to deal with in almost all Arma games. However, there is a bit of a boost from Arma 2 to Arma 3. You certainly can run the game. I can't promise you great settings, but with the right tweaking you'll be able to get 60fps in SP. MP is another story. Due to the way MP works, no one is guranteed 60fps. Often is 30-40, depending on the server. This is because of the server's performance, so you'll get different FPS from server to server. I have played on servers where I get 80fps on Ultra. I have played on servers where it hovers from 30-40. I have played on servers where I stuttrered at 30, and leaped up and back. So, you absolutely can. Arma 3 is a great game that is held back by its performance. You can certainly still enjoy it with your rig. I have logged plenty of hour on my laptop when my main rig was down, I played at 15-20fps in MP (when I was lucky) still 60fps in SP (open editor) in 720p all lowest settings.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dejrx,kris342,2,Wed Jul 15 22:10:28 2015 UTC,"Then it's a clear yes from me. I really liked the game, and I think you will too if you liked the two first. From what I've heard it doesn't have many issues on PS4, only on PC (which is the platform I played it on).  EDIT: One thing though, they may have focused a little too much on the batmobile, and the batmobile combat is pretty repetitive. However, I hardly think that will be a dealbreaker. It's quite a good sequel IMO, so again, if you liked the first two, you'll probably like this one too."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dbij2,ASsimilate88,8,Wed Jul 15 00:03:27 2015 UTC,"All of Paradox's grand strategy games have a significant learning curve. CKII isn't as difficult to pick up as, say, Victoria or Hearts of Iron, but it can still be a bit overwhelming to newcomers to the genre. I heard they improved the tutorial awhile back, but I haven't gone back and replayed it since they updated it so I can't say how helpful it actually is. There are many other resources for learning, though. Best way is to look up fan made tutorials on youtube and continue to watch more experienced player's let's plays.   how fun do you think combat is?   CK isn'the really about the combat. It's about managing your dynasty, forming alliances, and covertly plotting to get what you want. There will be wars, of course... but those wars will usually come down to who has the bigger army and who's allies will actually come to their aid. Really though, a smartly arranged marriage is often a far better way to expand your kingdom rather than conquering by force.  It's a fantastic game. One of my favorites. You can easily sink hundreds of hours into it once you learn the ropes."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dbij2,remyspam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:09:05 2015 UTC,"I think where some grand strategy vets get hung up is in the big picture aspect rather than the micro-management. CKII is a game that can task you with some serious long term planning. Plans that play out not just in years or decades, but over generations. Your current character may not see any real consequences from a particular action, but his children's children might stand to gain (or lose) big from it. When you get used to playing a game like Victoria, which is far more focused on the micro-management, switching over to the macro heavy CK can be jarring."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dbij2,BitchpuddingBLAM,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:32:30 2015 UTC,"I bought CKII a couple of years ago and tried but could never get into it.  I was desperately looking for a new game to play recently so I started playing CKII to see if I could figure it out this time around.  As I started playing it less than a month ago I can probably give you some insight.  The learning curve is massive.  You will feel like you have absolutely no control of anything when you start.  I still feel like that most of the time.  The tutorials are extremely basic to the scope of the game, and getting detailed answers on specific questions can be a challenge.  I originally bought the game to play as Ghengis Khan and there was a massive issue with managing demense that I still haven't fully figured out (mongol gameplay is likely updated with this new DLC, I haven't played any of it yet).    I would associate the game more with something like Out of the Park Baseball than a Total War game, though there are quite a lot of similarities between CK and TW.  If you have ever played a long campaign of TW and simulated all the battles then I would say that is more like Europa Universalis Jr. than CKII.    CKII is a very complex simulation game.  You are trying to build a strong family lineage more than conquer the world, though you can obviously make that a goal.  If you have a weak family and poor management of your court you will fail in this goal though.  I would say its a bit like gambling in that you try to make the best decisions and hope that you win but sometimes you will just get unlucky and spend a very long time trying to fight back from that.    All that said I would highly recommend it if you enjoy intense simulation games.  To me the game was insanely frustrating but that has made it more rewarding to learn in a way.  I will also say I enjoy EU4 more than CKII and if you enjoy TW games you might look into an EU game more than CKII, but that is just my opinion.  Like I said I would still recommend CKII.  Edit:  and as others have said, there is not a lot of ""fun"" in combat, but there is a fair amount of control.  You can manage a lot of things about your army that will affect how combat plays out.  Leaders, unit composition, moral, terrain, and unit path all affect how combat will simulate, but you don't directly control combat."

That's the thing about the game, there are lots of different ways to play. You can build alliances with marriage instead of war. You can get really into Church politics or totally ignore them. Start in Ireland with some Youtube tutorials and you will be fine :)  As someone said below it is like an RPG in a lot of ways. It's a lot of fun to play each character as their personality and position would dictate and see what happens, instead of trying to ""game"" everything from the beginning. Give your kids and vassals nicknames. Imagine how various characters would get along in person. It's really fun!"

If you could handle the (imo) horrendous combat in the first 2 witcher games, then the combat here isn't bad at all in comparison.   The story isn't hard to follow either and is really excellent."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dcd8y,zzzDavid,5,Wed Jul 15 04:14:14 2015 UTC,"As far as DLC goes:  The DLC for ME1 is free. Bring Down the Sky is fun but not at all necessary.  For ME2 I would order the DLC this way:   Shadow Broker. If you only get one, get this one. It is far and away the best. Arrival. Leads into the story of ME3. Not necessary to enjoy the third game but fills out the story nicely. Overlord. I enjoyed it but it really doesn't have any impact on the overall story. Kasumi. A fun mission that allows you to do something different. But it has even less of an impact on the story than Overlord does. Overlord at least fleshes out one of the factions in the galaxy.   For ME3:   Leviathon. This contains quite a bit of important backstory. From Ashes. If you like the lore, you really need to get this one as well. Citadel. Absolutely fantastic but a pure fan service that adds nothing to the story. I highly recommend it but BW games have expensive DLC so it is possible to skip it. Omega. Another DLC that doesn't add much to the story but is decent. Lets you tie up one loose end in the game and you can decide if that is really important to you when you come across it in ME3."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dcd8y,TheWinslow,3,Wed Jul 15 04:55:17 2015 UTC,"1) The story is great imo, it really immerses you in this big universe and you really start caring about the characters and the choices you make and how it affects everything. You should not have any trouble following along, and there is a lot of extra lore if you get curious to find out more about the galaxy  2) The combat is a bit clunky in the first game, but it really improves in the 2nd and third games. It's pretty much a 3rd person shooter w/ cover use and roleplay element like powers"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3dcd8y,Zorogami,2,Wed Jul 15 13:54:08 2015 UTC,"The answer is a qualified yes. The story carries over all three games, with character continuity, and it is easy to follow, with very few loose ends.

As for graphics, people are pretty split on recommendations.  I say play it vanilla for a bit then gradually add graphical mods.  I'm sure you want to get some use out of your new card.  Check out /r/skyrimmods, the people there are really cool.  Modding skyrim takes a lot of time and patience but imo it is worth it.  Heres some screens I've taken if you care.

It's an all-timer and has a lot of systems and pieces you see in games today.  I'd recommend playing on a harder setting (type ""/players X"", without quotes, any number up to 8) since solo will be a bit boring.  You could also look into mods like Kingdom of Tenai.  Path of Exile is a great (and free) isometric RPG with hour/day/week/month long leagues and a huge passive skill tree.  You should look into that, too."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3dbij9,Grizzled--Kinda,3,Wed Jul 15 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty fun ARPG dungeon-crawler.  The graphics are dated, it's 15 years old, so there are prettier games out there. And newer games have learned from D2 and refined the ARPG mechanics, so parts of it may feel rough/clunky in comparison. I think a lot of the die-hard fans are people who enjoyed the game's loot grind, where you keep replaying levels in higher difficulty modes for better drops, that help you get better drops, that help you get better drops... You may not be interested in doing that, so you may just play through the campaign once. IIRC there's probably about 25-30 hours of content in the base campaign.  There are 7 classes (5 from base game, 2 from LoD expansion). Each class has 3 skill trees, and multiple viable options within each tree, giving each character 5+ different ways they can be built. Which is cool and adds replayability. But I found these builds a bit unintuitive because there was no real way to know whether you would enjoy the playstyle of the type of build you were working towards, or whether it would be effective, so there was a lot of consulting external wikis for build guides and advice.  If you can find it on sale, sure, grab it. It's $20 for base + LoD expansion from Battle.net, which to me seems like a little too much for a 15 year old game you may not enjoy."

The dungons are mazes that have to be mapped like the old Bards Tale games, or more recently the Etrian Odyssey series. I'm a huge fan of both, so enjoy the mapping, if you were hoping for more of persona 3/4's relatively map lite dungeons, this might be annoying.  Also I think the theme is a lot different, at least not having played persona 4 yet (a crime, i know, i'll get around to it soon) its very different from 3. There's still something sinister going on in the background but alot of the scenes are humor based even if whats going on at the time is tense. I'm also only about halfway through the game though, so that could change later on.  Difficulty wise, it seems pretty easy, especially by persona/SMT standards, though that could just be me having played Etrian 1 and 4 already and being used to the combat system.

Etrian Odyssey IV has this level of polish and cohesion I wasn't really anticipating; I personally loved it.

Upon release, the game was actually pretty good, but it lacked an endgame content system. The expansion largely fixed this with the introduction of leaderboards and nephalem rifts.  In August/early September, a major content patch is coming out that basically addresses every major gripe the community has had with the game since its inception. They're introducing some amazing new features to the game that increase build diversity, add flavor to the endgame, improve quality of life, and make the experience just overall better.  The game right now is really fun to pick up for a few weeks at the beginning of a season, dump tons of hours into, then stop for a while and come back when a new season happens. I've put well over 1k hours into the game since launch, so I don't feel like I've  been ripped off a bit.   That said, it's different from Diablo 2 on a mechanical level. They're introducing some stuff that's a throwback to the game in the new patch though (like an overhauled version of the horadric cube). Honestly, if you like ARPGs, there is really no reason not to play diablo 3, especially at half price."

Bad reviews generally fall into 1 of 3 categories:   (the largest one) People butthurt that the game isn't exactly like Diablo 2 with shinier graphics. People who don't like ARPGs/just plain didn't like the game because it didn't suit their tastes People who didn't give the expansion a chance   If you were looking to play for the story, I think the story is pretty good. Diablo has some great lore behind it and you don't need friends to enjoy it.  The endgame, however, is much better with friends and in a group. You'll likely want to find a clan or spend some time in public games once you get to the point where you're going to be farming up gear and trying to get on the leaderboards.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3d93sc,Darkersun,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"If you do get it, I recommend doing so on PC. Although they seem to be trying to get away from it, PC gets major content patches earlier than console. It also generally has less cheaters because the PC version has more protection/is forced to be online (which may be unattractive that the game doesn't have an offline mode, but it makes the leaderboards more valid since they aren't filled with hackers)."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3d93sc,Boese,2,Tue Jul 14 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"Diablo 3 is a pretty good game, that continues to improve, but I would say its quite a bit different than Diablo 2.  Diablo 3 plays kind of like a MOBA, with keyboard spells mapped to 1,2,3,4 or QWER, and mouse clicks to move you around (you can also map skills to the mouseclicks as well). It requires some good use of these skills to take down certain enemies or bosses, and to escape from death.  Diablo 2 didn't really even require the keyboard (assuming you had sufficient buttons on your mouse for potions and the like). It was much more of a clickfest than Diablo 3 plays as.   Its why you can play Diablo 3 on a controller, because you aren't mashing the fuck out of one or two buttons.  So because the genre is literally so different, its hard to say you will like D3 if you liked D2...I would say Path of Exile falls somewhere in the middle, using the MOBA style keys, but having way more ""click everything!"" that Diablo 2 had. But Path of Exile has a bit of a learning curve in its giant skill web.   So I'd shop around a bit. There's also Torchlight, Sacred, and the like, which have similar traits to Diablo but have different spins on the genre."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3d93sc,Not_Like_The_Movie,2,Tue Jul 14 19:58:25 2015 UTC,"Despite what a lot of people said at launch, and continue to say, Diablo 3 is a very solid ARPG.  The campaign is entertaining, though the story itself does have some glaring flaws.  There were certainly issues with the game at launch, most notably the itemization, and the real money auction house.  The auction house has been removed, and to coincide with it, better items drop much more often, and they are far more interesting than they used to be, with or without the expansion.    What sets the game apart from other ARPGs, and what made me really have faith that the game was good at launch and had potential to be great, is the fluidity of the combat.  I love Titan Quest, and thoroughly enjoyed Torchlight 1 + 2, Path of Exile and Grim Dawn, but what keeps me going back to Diablo 3 is that I find it the most fun to actually play.  What the expansion really adds, besides a new act and class, is the post-story adventure mode.  In adventure mode, it adds a much more satisfying game loop than just killing bosses or running high monster density areas over and over.    I would definitely recommend the game at this price, but especially if you're going to get the expansion too."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3d93sc,Lingo56,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:37:36 2015 UTC,"Going to add on a bit here. I wouldn't recommend it without the expansion, to be honest. Despite adding seemingly less content than the base game (4 acts vs. 1 act), the expansion is what has 99% of the replayability of the game."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3d93sc,Murdersaurus13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:26:06 2015 UTC,"I own the game and have about 70 hours in.  The story is forgettable and honestly pretty bad. It's just there to take you to new set pieces and so you have badass cutscenes once in a while.  What you really play the game for is the loot.  Forget getting Diablo 3 just on its own, the expansion is what adds all the gameplay. It changes the game from an annoyingly story focused action rpg and makes it a loot focused fun time. You'll be spending almost all your time in Diablo 3 doing runs and hoping to find as many legendaries as possible, then hoping to finish sets for even more bonuses.  The main end game challenge is to see how far you can get completing greater rifts, which are fairly hard dungeons that have 'endless difficulty' (it ends but nobody has beat it yet).  Take from this what you will but the main reason you should buy Diablo 3 is for the high production, polish, and the promise of loot. If that doesn't interest you I would look elsewhere."

The narration in both games is really good and the gameplay is fun as well. Transistor's gameplay is definitely interesting since it's a hybrid of turn based and real time combat.

For last-gen games you have Uncharted, Killzone, more Ratchet and Clank, Disgaea, Journey (and Flower and f.low available with it), Demon's Souls, inFAMOUS, I believe all the Metal Gear Solid games (outside of Ground Zeroes), Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls, and LittleBigPlanet.

But if you'd prefer a console, I would recommend the PS3 solely because of its free multiplayer. If you want party chat and more reliable multiplayer, however, Xbox 360 (its Gold subscriptions apply to Xbox One, as well). The PS3 definitely has more variety in its exclusives, but the Xbox 360 had a few gems at the beginning of its lifespan (such as the JRPG Lost Odyssey), as well as an emphasis on competitive shooters (Halo and Gears of War)."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3d8wix,Dragonzeanse,-1,Tue Jul 14 15:59:03 2015 UTC,"Probably PS3. It's got a way bigger library of exclusives, particularly The Last of Us.

I'd suggest the Borderlands series, great to play with friends and it has many hours of gameplay, especially with the DLC."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3d9bz7,Rbeattie98,3,Tue Jul 14 14:48:34 2015 UTC,"Such a huge list to choose from, given your lack of criteria (not that that is bad).   Something more linear Hmm.   Try Dishonoured perhaps? Good story, style and gameplay. Intriguing and refreshing to play.   If you like that (while the reviews state that it is nothing like it's namesake) try Thief? Wait for a sale as you may not like it, but if you run out of other ideas perhaps check it.   Hitman games are great if you are into that stealth (Dishonoured is also stealth in nature). Absolution is frequently cheap and has amazing graphics. Haven't finished the game do can't vouch for the story, but it is enjoyable so far (if a little frustrating at times!).  If you like Indie, or more like Bastion (in graphics), how about Don't Starve, Terraria etc. Stealth Bastard is fun and creative. This War Of Mine is a heavy game, and will make you think, yet stands as a good craft/survival/2d game on a shallower level.  For more RPG orientated, check out Fallout 3 and New Vegas (I'd suggest Fallout 3 for its story, but NV is amazing in it's own right, and newer). Dragon Age, Witcher 2+3, Skyrim/Oblivion and Mount and Blade are all fantastic too. However many listed here are not linear in the slightest, and more creative gameplay, yet it is interesting and you will probably be able to sink many hours into them.  Point and Click games? I'd recommend The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us. Life Is Strange is worth considering too.  Bit of mystery? LA Noire is fantastic (ever seen LA Confidential? It's like that) and I've heard good things about Alan Wake.  Portal 1 and 2, along with Half Life 1/2 are very engaging and entertaining, while still having a wonderful story.  For FPS, if you want story try Spec Ops The Line, which stands apart from all other FPS you may play. Medal of Honor is entertaining for a short while, and personally the story engaged me. Battlefield 2 Bad Company is the best BF for story IMO, and the multiplayer is active and fun. Stay away from MW2/3 if you want a fun MP experience, but the story is good.  For horrors I would recommend Amnesia, but also Penumbre Overture, which is older and cheap, but a nice journey to sink a few hours into. Silent Hill and Resident Evil are masterful too.  BioShock 1 and Infinite are great games all round, and will stick with you. Sleeping Dogs is fun, rather like GTA set in Hong Kong, and the former has a pretty linear story, while the world and setting will impress you. If you are on PlayStation, Red Dead Redemption is a must-try for me.  Which is you favourite genre? Or one that interests you the most for your next game? I can give some more focused suggestions then. Check out Steam reviews and YouTube videos if you are unsure or want to look deeper into some of the games - although avoid playthroughs of some of the intense story games, wouldn't want to ruin the experience when you play it yourself!"

The world is pretty but not very interesting. The setting and lore are pretty generic fantasy.   Don't be fooled by gameplay videos that this is anything close to an action RPG. The animations don't carry weight and player skill isn't rally a big part of the combat.  Like other DA games, the loot system is pretty lame and it's not all that exciting to find new gear. The crafting system is tedious.   Voice acting is good, but kinda ruined by the wooden animations.

I personally enjoyed the first Dragon Age, but then again I do enjoy CRPGs. For anyone who enjoys action games this will be a sever disappointment, and on the same end of that those who enjoy CRPGs will find the combat in this game to be a sin. They tried to balance the line between Origins and 2 but failed as it resembles the worst of both worlds, slow combat without much weight and zero skill base, and the wonky tactical viewer which is 10x less effective than the tried and true iso-viewers we've had for two decades.

But the games have a lot to them, both in terms of charm and game play. The campaigns are very fun, some of my favorite of all games I've ever played. They do tell the stories before WoW so you should be able to find many places, events and characters in those games that you're already familiar with. All in all, great games that have a few years on them but very much worth the price!"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3d6id4,Vrenni,2,Mon Jul 13 22:32:11 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind that WC3 is a strategy game, as opposed to WoW. That being said, the game runs really well on modern systems and has received a lot of support over the years."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3d59hz,lokilullaby,2,Mon Jul 13 21:43:27 2015 UTC,I recommend playing Persona 3 (FES or Portable) before you play Golden. It will feel like a step backwards if you try 4 first since it improved alot of features and I regretted it.   If you kinda like 3 but want something harder then try SMT:IV or Digital Devil Saga. If you really liked 3 then go to Golden.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3d59hz,RandomDude1801,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:21:01 2015 UTC,"I think this would really depend on what type of JRPGs you're getting into. Are they modern games or old school? Do you like playing NES/SNES games? Do you like cut-scenes advancing the story? How about side-quests?  P4 and Earthbound are radically different games, and appeal to certain types of gamers. I'm going to guess that if you're only starting to get into JRPGs, you're probably not an old school gamer, and probably wouldn't appreciate Earthbound's quirks and charms right away (or ever). The game plays like Dragon Quest I on an acid trip and isn't for everyone.  Either way, I'd suggest looking on YouTube to see what the gameplay for both games looks like and use that to influence your decision."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3d59hz,obnoxious_mitten,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:04:20 2015 UTC,"They're both wonderfully unconventional in totally different ways.

Both games are absolutely amazing and rank in the genre's Top 10, so it's otherwise difficult to choose between them."

I know some other common complaints involve the puzzles, bosses, and coin collection, but honestly, I didn't torture myself to get far enough into the game to remember much of it at all. In fact, I'm pretty sure that memories I did form of the game have most likely been repressed.  It is a disgrace to the Paper Mario franchise."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3d3ua7,InsaneHerald,8,Mon Jul 13 08:30:53 2015 UTC,I bought back when it first showed up at early access and it has gotten fairly frequent (about once a month) larger updates with a few smaller (depending on the month) updates making some changes.  A lot of those changes have been based around community feedback on the game too so the devs have been active in and paying attention to the community.  All in all it's a real solid game that has only steadily gotten better with an increase in content and gameplay tweaks that I've gotten several hours of fun out of and don't regret my purchase one bit.  It should also be noted full release is slated for October and they've been keeping with their timeline so far as far as I can tell.

It's depth and story are fantastic even with two of the five zones(including the 'final' zone) being closed off. It is by far one of my favourite games and as others have said the Devs do frequently update based on community feedback. Definitely worth your money as it doesn't feel like its missing much while still having a lot of potential.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3d4p3x,Nuclearbananas,2,Mon Jul 13 20:22:12 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that ArmA is primarily a MilSim, meaning that the same  strategies, tactics, and situations found in modern warfare also apply to ArmA. If you intend on enjoying all the game has to offer through multiplayer (co-op, TDM, Koth), you can expect to find yourself working with a group of anywhere from 10-50+ people, where proper communication and teamwork is essential.  If you're not interested in the military aspect of it, then I'd definitely recommend GTA V if you want to get the most out of your money, otherwise don't bother much ArmA. In my opinion, the game isn't worth it for the mods, seeing as how I've only gotten around 30ish hours of entertainment from DayZ and Breaking Point, but have easily accumulated well over 200 hours on GTA."

Arma is pretty much multiplayer only. That said there are quite a few clans and groups up there you can sign up with. It really excels with Teamspeak and a good group of guys.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3d515t,noplzstop,2,Mon Jul 13 16:12:51 2015 UTC,"There's a short campaign and story, it's nothing too detailed or complex, mainly it's just an excuse to roll up stuff into a ball, but it's still pretty amusing. If you're looking for a meaty story, this isn't the game for you, but it does give you enough of a background to at least explain why you're rolling up stuff into a ball and it's quite silly throughout. The campaign basically is just timed levels where you have to reach a certain size in the time limit, starting out small (coins, matches, etc.) and by the last levels, people, cars, buildings, islands, giant monsters, everything. There are a few side missions where you remake constellations where you have to meet more specific goals, e.g. to remake cancer you have to roll up as many crabs as you can, but mainly it's just about having an excuse to roll up things into balls.  It's short and there's not much of a story but the gameplay is fun, the whole aesthetic of the game is really silly and unique, and the soundtrack is one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time (and one I still pretty regularly listen to). For $10, I'd say it's worth it although it was only $20 when it came out on PS2 so I'm a bit surprised it hasn't come down more. Still, I'd say it's worth playing, it's a pretty unique experience and there's not much out there like it."

Psychonauts (Extremely healthy dose of humor here, takes place at a psychic kid's summer camp, which is a fantastic atmosphere) Rayman Legends (Absolutely gorgeous animation, top of the line 2D work. Bright, colorful, a total treat) Saints Row 3/4/Gat (Adult kinda silly. Amplifies all the ridiculous of GTA) Scribblenauts Unlimited (Your imagination is the limit here. Solve puzzles by conjuring... damn near anything. Sure, you could get across the river by using a boat, but why not ride a pterodactyl? It's precisely as lighthearted as you want it to be.) South Park (but you've already played about 7 hours so I hesitate to include it)"

ShouldIbuythisgame,3d3svy,ayy_lmao_420,5,Mon Jul 13 08:11:19 2015 UTC,"I'd preface that I like fairly challenging games with high rewards.   Monster Hunter 4:Ultimate: Game about Monster Hunting, fairly steep learning curve initially. Some people recommend having a the CCP or an N3DS but I have managed (reached endgame) without either. Try demo before purchase. Has extensive online multiplayer Check this game out if you like: killing big things, equipment/skill customization, playing with randoms/friends online, progression. Fire Emblem:Awakening: Grid Turn Based SRPG. Widely regarded as one of the best games on 3DS. I personally like earlier games in the series more, but this is definitely the game to get into series. Option for more casual players are available. You essentially control a band of characters through a fantasy setting. Check this game out if you like: fairly large cast of characters, customizing skillsets of each character, matchmaking your units, replayability, easy to pickup and put down if you are a busy person. Etrian Odssey IV: A retro ""make your own party"" labyrinth dungeon crawl RPG. Personal favorite game series. Etrian Odyssey IV is definitely the game to start to get a feel for the series. Fairly difficult for newer players starting out, but incredibly rewarding. Some people find it tedious mapping dungeons out on the touch screen (you can set mapping options ingame to alleviate some of the issues) . Check out the demo on eShop. There also Etrian Odyssey:Untold (a remake of the first game in the series) check that out if you prefer having some story and personable cast, I still recommend IV over Untold just for general better user friendliness and a better sub-skill system. Pretty sure 4 has an easier mode if so desired, I still recommend playing on the normal?(someone correct me here I can't remember) just because its significantly more rewarding. Check out the demo for sure its a bit of an acquired taste. Check this game out if you like: party skill management, incredibly rewarding but difficult games, drawing maps on your touch screen. Shin Megami Tensei IV JRPG with demons summoning, fusion and overall dark/heavy plot. Fairly difficult in the start of the game, you will die, often probably. Some people find that they don't really like the setting/map. Navigating can be a bit annoying later on in the game. However, the demon summoning and fusion system really shines in this game. At its core, its designed for you and your party of demons to take advantage of enemy weaknesses and the enemies would do the same to you. This creates an incentive to accomodate your teams weaknesses and having other demons in reserve to fight certain demons.  Check this game out if you like: Party and skill management accommodating weaknesses, fairly interesting(comparatively) story/setting, dont mind some frustrations in navigating/getting chain attacked to death, spending hours theorycrafting demon fusions.   Since this is getting too long I'll just list a few that I also would recommend:   Rune Factory 4: farming(like plants and animals farming)/dungeon crawling RPG Phoenix wright games: Essentially a Visual Novel game featuring a quirky lawyer, also has a crossover game with Professor Layton   Feel free to ask for clarifications"

Does this one guide you in the beginning?   Fire Emblem:Awakening   I haven't played any Fire Emblem yet, but i played Advance Wars 1+2 and loved the strategy aspect. Combined with a good story i think this would be a good choice?   Etrian Odssey IV   Nah, not my type.   Shin Megami Tensei IV   Not a fan of SMT, but of Persona. I am weird.  Thanks man, i hadn't considered MH4U & Fire Emblem."

I generally have an outside source to help like kiranico for that sort of stuff though. I do have to mention though that I only started getting into MH from this game specifically (couldn't stand PSP controls and the terrible tutorial), I don't really visit the subreddit but /r/monsterhunter has some pretty decent resources.  Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with Fire Emblem, A lot of people seems to like it, and it garnered a lot of new fans. It does, however, play differently than AW so don't expect it being AW going in and I'm sure you would have a good time."

I would say that if you haven't tried Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate yet, that's one you can sink a lot of time into.   Another favourite of mine is fire emblem awakening. Really fun if you like turn based strategy.  Starfox 64 3D is a good one if you don't mind how short it is.   OoT 3D is my favourite version of OoT. It just looks so much nicer, and having the touch screen rather than the c buttons is awesome.  If you haven't played OoT before, I would hold off on MM until you finish OoT. MM has a lot of similarities to OoT, but as it has a time limit, it adds a whole different level of challenge."

In a zone named 'Auridon', you'll notice the world textures are reused and spread oddly, forests don't have real clusters of trees. Even for the loading screen art - they took tropical trees for the background. Disgustingly unimmersive for me. Combat is quite fast, no tab targeting, spells don't look very distinct/flashy/beautiful Crafting is easy but not very interesting. Find a trait you like for whatever weapon? Find that weapon with that trait, consume it for your crafting book to craft more of it.  Exploration has a bit of Skyrim nostalgia but the world is quite bland. Even TERA looks better in terms of world design.   For $12, yeah you can dive in it and check it out since you liked Skyrim that much. However, this isn't very Trinity-ish."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3d2xi0,simsoy,2,Mon Jul 13 17:06:40 2015 UTC,"The Deus Ex games. If you don't mind the extremely dated graphics, the first game is still heralded as one of the greatest PC games of all time. Otherwise, Human Revolution is a good place to start. It's not super open world, but it's a great stealth/shooter RPG. If you do like the first Deus Ex, System Shock 2 is also at the top of its game in terms of RPG shooters. It would later serve as the spiritual predecessor to Bioshock.  On that note, Bioware/Black Isle games. Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire, Mass Effect, Neverwinter Nights, etc. all have incredibly deep choice-consequence systems, world effecting decisions, and incredible writing. If you're willing to go back a bit further, Baldur's Gate 2, Planescape Torment, Arcanum.  Divinity Original Sin is a modern classic, inspired by the aforementioned isometric games. If you're looking for a more Elder  Scrolls type experience, Divinity 2 is more similar although it's older and less polished. I'm told Sacred 2 is also an incredibly deep open-world game, but I found it hard to get into. It's worth looking at, however.  Here's a weird one: If you liked M&B Warband, I'm going to recommend The Guild II: Renaissance. It has very little combat, and instead serves as more of an RPG medieval life simulator, where you control a dynasty with ownership of buildings, shops, political systems, trials, dynastic feuds, etc. It's hard to explain because there really aren't any games like it, but it's incredibly deep and fun.  I'm sure there are tons of others I'm forgetting, so I may update this post if I remember any. I'm only including PC games or games that have a PC port available. For RPGs, a lot of my favorites were actually on consoles, but they may not meet the criteria or availability you're asking for."

At the point where I stopped (about 20 hours in) it was open world in the sense that I was free to explore, but obviously not everything was in my level range. I also chose a more challenging early game spec (dual fae blades) so that made it more fun.

The Forza series focuses on realism - you can tune your car any which way you can imagine, and the cars handle as close as they can get to the real thing. That said, it might not be to your liking. I'm awful at Forza and I admit I'm more into arcadey-style racers. It's all about personal preference.  For what it's worth, I also have a friend who returned Rivals on the day he bought it, he said it was awful. But that's just one guy's opinion, so take that how you want. Personally, I'd go with Horizon 2 since it really is a game made for car lovers and it gets a lot of good reviews."

So far I really like the gameplay and the intro to the story so I can't wait to get further, it's too bad I can probably only play this for a few minutes at a time.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3d2s46,MajorAdmin,6,Mon Jul 13 01:47:03 2015 UTC,"Plenty of people has played ME2 before ME1, but Mass Effect is ridiculously low for $5. It's probably never going to go further down than that.  I will say this: to get the full experience of ME2 or ME3, the DLCs are paramount. Lair of the Shadow Broker, imo, is one of the best DLCs that Bioware has ever put out, as well as being pretty integral to the development of a major character and Arrival is very important for leading to the story of ME3. Also Overlord's pretty good too. And then there's two companions that are DLC only (who aren't that significant). The thing is, each of these DLCs cost somewhere around 10-15 dollars, in form of Bioware points that never ever go on sale. So, buying ME2 is an investment.  ME1, on the other hand, can be fully enjoyed with zero DLCs. There are two, none of which are narratively significant or interesting. Not to mention, most editions at this point just include them outright.   My advice is to buy the first one if you want to play a story-rich space RPG that is fully self-contained. If you want a more action-oriented RPG, go with ME2. Just be warned that if you do get hooked into the story, ME2 ends somewhat on a cliffhanger and you will have to pay more to get some more fill of the world/characters."

Raiding is good. plenty of side stuff like pets, archeology, etc. but I don't like them so I had nothing else but to raid, pvp, or lvl alts speaking of pvp it's nothing to be excited about, really.   Overall I plowed through WoD for about a month when it started to get really boring. I could make enough money from garrison a few minutes a day to not need to pay for gametime (you can buy game token with gold now) and there was nothing for me to work toward besides raids.

The dungeons and boss fights are fairly interesting. I did find it hard to locate guilds that ran with guild members only, the raid finder and oqueue system kind of killed the sense of community the game once had (you just list your raid and people fill it).  If you are returning for pvp I would suggest not returning at all. The faction population for 2k+ players is now over 90% in favor of alliance due to poor class balance and the dwarven racial being required for healers.  Good luck in your choice but personally I would avoid the game. Blizzard is continuously shrinking the game down and making it more casual. Garrisons outright killed what was left of the community because people can be safe hiding in their own instanced facebook game."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cxuao,murphs33,10,Sat Jul 11 20:45:26 2015 UTC,"For a contrasting opinion, I would lean towards no, especially right now. The server stability and matchmaking is really bad right now, so I can't imagine how the cross-play is working.  As far as gameplay is concerned, I've been disappointed in the experience, especially considering the way people have been acting about this game. The underlying game is enjoyable, but it's the kind of game that gets old, fast. When you pull off a move that gets you a goal, it is genuinely exciting, but I find that those moments come far too infrequently. Granted, I know I'm not very skilled, but it's not a game that makes me want to improve. I'm usually driving after the ball, hitting it infrequently, and when I try to play a position, I'm constantly getting pushed around, half the time by my own team. Playing with the AI is pointless, as they have the tendancy to score on our own goal. Frankly, it seems like the kind of game that is very rewarding if you put a lot of time into mastering it, but personally, I have no desire to do so.  TL;DR: Not recommended (right now at least). Might be worth it when they iron out the technical issues and you're willing to devote some time to improve."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cxuao,DEVILneverCRIES,2,Sat Jul 11 20:53:57 2015 UTC,"I think Rocket League and Cities: Skylines are basically tied for my Game of the Year nod for 2015. (This is just an expression, I'm well aware that no one cares about winning my GOTY nod.) It's the best ""sports"" game I've played in a long time, and the basic controls are very simple to grasp. The depth comes in figuring out how to work the physics and consistently hit the ball whenever you want to. (I think most everyone is still trying to figure that out.)  Now, if you don't go too crazy over losing games, it's lots of fun. The only major drawback is that the server situation still seems to be a little unstable, but I expect it to be better when the initial enthusiasm wears off and people start going off to play whatever the next flavor of the month is. I think it'll continue to be popular enough that you'll at least not have trouble finding a game whenever you want to.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cxuao,BitchpuddingBLAM,2,Sat Jul 11 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"If you've played city-building games (especially SimCity) the learning curve will be relatively simple. You won't automatically make aesthetically elegant masterpieces of urban planning, but it at least won't take long to get your city to function and running in the black.  If you're not a city-building veteran at all, the game does start you off slowly. It gives you a tutorial and a level-up system that introduces more buildings and city policies as you progress. So, it doesn't throw you in the proverbial deep end of city planning right away.  As for replayability, it has tons of community-made mods, ranging from additional buildings to different utilities and game mechanics. So, if the base game isn't enough for you, there are lots of mods to try out. And as for the base game, the devs are still actively patching and adding content to the game. So, that's what there is beyond the normal level of replayability you'd expect from a city-building game."

I've dabbled in flight sims through the years, never seriously, but I LOVE me some sci fi and this game seems to scratch an itch I've had for a long time. I've been waiting patiently for No Man's Sky but I couldn't help myself with Elite: Dangerous.   I can say I've REALLY enjoyed the feeling of actually flying through space and exploring systems all over the Milky Way. I put on some music, launch from the space station, and go wherever I want. Sometimes take jobs to earn money. Sometimes wreck my ship. I do see what people mean when they talk about the game getting grindy and repetitive, but if you're like me and just want to float among the stars while you unwind after work to some Brian Eno and Vangelis, it doesn't get better than this.  The flight mechanics and controls can be as easy or as tricky as you want but you'll get the hang of basic flight, travel and docking pretty quick. Combat is fun but can happen at frustratingly inconvenient moments (like when you're about to drop off some cargo for a fat payment).  If you like the idea of the known Galaxy as your sandbox and immersing yourself as much as possible in what amounts to a space flight sim, I say give it a shot. If you need clear goals and variety of gameplay to sustain your interest past 15 hours or so, you may want to wait for something with more content like No Man's Sky or Star Citizen. But I bought it basically expecting an interactive screen-saver, and for this fan of space and sci fi it's a great way to relax and let my imagination breathe."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cz6g3,GreatWhiteToyShark,2,Sun Jul 12 05:33:10 2015 UTC,"I would suggest you not.  I picked it up during the steam sale and honestly just could not get into it.    The game is absolutely stunning, haven't seen a game quite as beautiful in a long time and the fact that I love space sims/games just adds to that effect.  Unfortunately that's about the only thing I found truly interesting and enjoyable about it.    First and foremost I haven't played much multiplayer as that's not what I bought it for, I like a single player experience for the most part so perhaps that's the problem I have.  Regardless, I've found that the design of the game suffers some serious flaws.  There's essentially (from what I've found) three genres of activities in the game:  Combat, Exploration, and Trade.   Combat is imo boring as all hell.  I was looking for something akin to freelancer and ended up with a dogfighting sim (for the most part) which I do not find particularly exhilarating.  Now admittedly this is largely due to the yaw restriction and the mechanics of the game and I would have realized this had I done some research early but there you have it.  This coupled with the fact that one of the primary routes for combat is bounty hunting, which involves going to a sector then literally flying around aimlessly until you stumble upon your target, makes for a terrible design choice.    Trade is simple and incredibly boring when stacked against games like EvE or any game with a strong focus on economic dominance.    Exploration I've tried a little and it was fun, but not enough to justify the price point.    There's a lot more to it that I could add but it's getting too long.  TLDR: I would suggest not picking it up or at least doing your research first.  Freelancer 2 this is not, though for some people it seems to work."

Daily rewards in the game are given every day you log on in succession, so you can play on and off whenever you feel like it and you still maintain your progress in the daily challenges. Not a P2W, as the majority of premium currency is used for cosmetic stuff. Traditional PvE and PvP are included, but the unique feature is something called World vs World, which is a war that is waged between three servers of hundreds or thousands of people, resulting in huge battles. It also takes a step away from the whole ""Holy Trinity"" thing of tank, dps, and mage, and instead replaces it with nine different classes, each specializing in a certain skill set.

It's a very unique and interesting game, definitely worth upgrading to the next tier.  Haven't played Risk of Rain yet, but I've heard good things about it.

It's combat is much closer to any of the recent batman game (almost a clone in basic mechanics) except you can kill orcs faster than batman can take out opponents.  There's only a couple scripted fights in the game, it's very much an open world game, and what really makes it shine is the nemesis system that makes it so anytime you are killed, the orc that killed you becomes more powerful.    The game picks up very quickly and the story could be completed in probably 10 hours for an average gamer.

Now, if you're looking for multiplayer, Chivalry: Medieval Warfare (and the expansion if you want katanas) is a fuck-ton of fun to play. I can't believe it took civilization this long to make a first-person melee-based medieval multiplayer shooter, but I'm sure glad someone finally did.

We were never on any given map for very long and although I was okay with the shooting aspect I felt very hamstrung compared to others who had better map knowledge.  One day I decided I should practice for an upcoming LAN and booted it up to play with my future friends.  Shortly after joining a group, I was 'picked' to be the tank and had no idea where to go.  It was one of the hallways maps on fire with lots of smoke.  My team proceeded to besmirch the good name of my mother and my vast array of various creeds and ethnicities before kicking me out of the game.  I uninstalled it after that.  Also, this is why I won't play League of Legends."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cun46,lstant,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:30:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I had a blast playing through it with my friend. We picked it up under the Steam sale and we really like the series. I would say 20$ is pretty decent if you like the franchise :) (we certainly got our values worth)  First things first, if you decide to buy it: UNCAP THE 30 FPS LOCK. We both did this, and the game ran really smoothly without any major problems.  Also, if you play online keep your Steam name short and without any special characters. If you don't, the game freezes for both players when trying to join a game.  You could ask my questions I guess, overall I say it's worth it if you're a fan of fun zombie-killing gameplay. The characters are good, the story is kinda what you expect. Hope this helps!"

ShouldIbuythisgame,3ctog6,Fuser55,4,Fri Jul 10 18:11:30 2015 UTC,"I've played Empire and Shogun 2: FotS  Even if these two games are similiar, the differances were definately there, in Empire almost all units had guns, while in FotS, there were also plenty of melee units, the Gatling also felt far better than the Puckle, so it's different in many ways IMO atleast."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3ctog6,grey_lollipop,3,Fri Jul 10 18:26:22 2015 UTC,"How dare you mock the mighty puckle???  Seriously, Shogun 2 w/ FOTS is my favorite of the TW series."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3ctog6,grey_lollipop,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, I found it really enjoyable, but I prefered Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai, it's set in the time period when Japan began to get westernized, so you got a better mix of units IMO.  In Empire the only units without muskets or other types of ranged weapons are some of the cavalry units, everything else just shoots occassionaly. The ships are also all made of wood, most of them have sails and they're covered in cannons.  In FotS, you have people with bows, swords and guns, you have Samurais, Ninjas and Gatling gun operators. The ships are also more varied IMO and contain different kinds of ironclads."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3ctog6,youvebeengreggd,2,Sat Jul 11 10:42:50 2015 UTC,"I love Rome and Empire, played Attila and I don't have as much of an issue with it as some.  You'll hear mixed things about each of the games, but when you play through and combine it with mods and all kinds of stuff that is out there to enhance your experience it is worth every penny.  Whoever told you that ""when you play one you play them all"" probably just doesn't enjoy this style of game. I've given hundreds of hours of my life to several of these installments and I don't regret it. I find it quite satisfying.  It's like Risk. Some people hate that game. Some people love it."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3ctog6,tenorplayer09,2,Fri Jul 10 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"Here are my personal recommendations (played pretty avidly since Rome 1)  Attila: Most recent game. Ton of fun to watch the world burn   Napoleon: If you want gunplay, start here. Darthmod is awesome too  Shogun: Probably the most refined of the bunch. Really great place to start as a TW newcomer but also just a blast to play. Do yourself a favor and buy The Fall of the Samurai DLC (standalone btw)  Also, Rome 2 launched in a TERRIBLE state but is actually quite a bit of fun to play now"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3ctog6,frayuk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:35:33 2015 UTC,"Have you played Empire? I'm assuming (since it is in the 18th century) that it has gunplay and since it's on a larger scale, it might be more fun."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3ctog6,tenorplayer09,2,Fri Jul 10 18:54:01 2015 UTC,"The community is basically split between Empire and Napoleon. Being gunpowder era games, they're both distinct from all the other total war titles. Personally, I prefer Empire.  Empire is older and rough around the edges. But the scale is huge - India, Middle East, North Africa, Europe, North America, Central America and Caribbean, plus the oceans in between (empire was the first tw to introduce naval warfare).  Napoleon is a much smaller scale. Only Europe, plus there are a few campaigns that concentrate on certain areas, like Italy or Egypt. However its much more polished - everything from the graphics to mechanics to how the guns feel when a volley is shot.  So basically, if you're choosing between Napolean and Empire, you're choosing between larger scale or smoother gameplay."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3ctog6,Kaninen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:54:07 2015 UTC,"Full disclosure, I'm a little jaded against Empire. At launch, it was such a frustrating mess but I have been assured by people who still play it that as long as you use the Darthmod it is a very good game. Definitely give it a try at the right price. The scale of Napoleon is pretty good too so don't let that push you away. If scale is specifically what you are looking for, avoid Shogun. I love it but the one big ding against it by most TW fans is that geographically it is pretty limited."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3ctog6,SoulTaker32,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:14:19 2015 UTC,"My favourites are Rome and Medieval 2. I personally don't like Shogun 2, but people say that it's the best Total War game. Empire is also worth looking into. So is Napoleon"

ShouldIbuythisgame,3crwjs,anoxy,2,Fri Jul 10 14:40:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, sounds pretty enthralling. I'm not one that could easily skip titles in a series so I would definitely start with 1 despite its flaws."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3crwjs,Hellknightx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:51:16 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go with this suggestion. I personally could not stand the Witcher 1 or 2, but I do think the Witcher 3 is one of the best RPGs of all time. Mass Effect, as a whole, was great, and only got better with each installment.  The first game is very RPG heavy to the point that it bogs down the gunplay, but the 2nd and 3rd games iterate well on the first game's faults. If you really find that you can't get into the first game, the 2nd game has a sort of catch-up conversation in the beginning that lets you pick which major events played out in the first game, although you'll still be gimping yourself.  The Witcher 3 has a similar catch-up mechanic if you decide to skip the previous games as well."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3crwjs,phallicsteel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:56:45 2015 UTC,"I played the Witcher 1 when it was first out, and was surprised that so many liked it, or rather seemingly had no problem with it. I just remember the controls bugged me and the story dragged at points. I got sick of talking about Salamanca all the time. Still finished it though. Otherwise I love the style and the atmosphere of it, and collecting cards was fun.. >.> Hearing 2 was better, liking the controls more (started it before), and fueled by the hype of 3 makes me want to go back and finally play through it."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3crwjs,JayWatermalone,0,Fri Jul 10 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"If I wanted to catch up on what happened in the first mass effect without having to replay it, is there a YouTube video or something I can read that will catch me up?"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3crwjs,phallicsteel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:33:31 2015 UTC,"Well I can't think of a perfect solution but I can give you 2 recommendations:  1) I don't know of/can't find any proper videos that does a detailed summary, HOWEVER IGN has done a 5 min summary of the whole game.  2) Despite not wanting to replay it, you could play on the easiest difficulty (so combat will be quicker, therefore you'll finish quicker) and choose a different class to make things less boring for you.  EDIT: basic grammar."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3crwjs,Vierge99,2,Fri Jul 10 10:38:50 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of back and forth about that. I feel like anyone who's a fan of Fallout though either has played or wants to play both 3 and NV. The next fallout game I play will be NV, since I've heard it's great and I've already played 3. Eventually I want to revisit 3 with DLC, but not sure if it will be before or after 4 releases."

The souls games may be hard and frustrating, but they are satisfying and extremely engaging so they will definitely take his mind off everything.

If not, I still recommend the witcher 2 and 3. Mass Effect is a solid choice, but I would go Fallout NV just because you haven't played it and it is worth it.   You could also do Final fantasy (VII, VIII, or X would be my suggestions) depending on weekday systems you have.  Lastly, if you're looking for coop, you can do Diablo 3 or Borderlands. Both are solid multilayer choices"

If you want a story centered game with fair amounts of violence, go with DA:O, it's one of my favorite fantasy RPGs.  Mass Effect is a phenomenal sci-fi action adventure. If you're gonna play ME, you have to play all three of the games.  For the witcher, I'm haven't played the series, but from listening to my friends' justifications, it's a gripping tale with a complex system of combat and has a fair amount of choices."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3crwjs,GunstarBlue,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:27:46 2015 UTC,"Ultraviolence sounds good at times. For instance sometimes I'm in a mood to go back to Postal 2, even though it's such a terrible game, it can be pretty satisfying. DA to me seems just as viable as ME and Witcher right now, it's only slightly lower down the list I think because I have played through half of it before, whereas the other two would be a fresh experience."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3crwjs,Invisible-Gorilla,2,Fri Jul 10 19:28:53 2015 UTC,"DA is awesome, but it's long. My first full playthrough took me around 60 hours.

I strongly suggest powering through ME1 and take in the story and try not to focus on the gameplay. After I've gone through it a few times, it hurts me to play to be honest."

If you wanna try something new, I'd say give Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. The premium edition is on Steam for around $20 right now, and it's a mix of platforming, action, and breathtaking scenery.  If you're looking for some horror, I'd say to check out Dead Space. The trilogy is pretty good. The first is the best because it's actually scary with plenty of jumps and plenty of gore. The second focuses more on the gore, and by then, you'll have gotten used to the fear. The third isn't the highlight by any means because it's focus is shooting. It isn't narrow corridors, running from zombie aliens, it's more open and not really scary. Also, co-op.  RAGE is a good wasteland style violent spree, with a strong vehicular combat element. It might get some hate for being ""too colorful"" or ""not inventive"", but it has a beautiful landscape, especially with a good graphics card. The story is lackluster, but it is made up for with the style of combat, add on collectibles and mini-games galore, and you've got a pretty good wasteland shooter."

I'm about to finish Dark Souls 2 and it has been a huge let down for me overall. There are some nice aspects to it but it's just missing so much of the ""magic"" that is often lost when the auteur behind the series isn't at the helm.    Destiny can be fun with friends, but it's a soul suck eventually and even with the dlc, still a massive grind with a major lack of content."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cssxa,cmichael00,2,Fri Jul 10 15:36:38 2015 UTC,"So I have played all 4 games, I enjoyed Dark Souls the most. Destiny is a bad game with really good core mechanics (the shooting feels so good). I would stay away from Destiny. DS2 was good, but not as good as Dark Souls. It had to many boss fights, felt empty, and added difficulties that made the game less fun, instead of making it more challenging. I hear the expansion fixed A LOT so it might be worth playing with the expansion (I have not played). So DS2 would be an ok choice. But I would have to say Bloodborne is the game to get. Its exactly like Dark Souls, but at the same time is something very different. Its a faster Dark Souls and requires movement rather than using a shield.    Edit: Since you haven't played any of them I would get Dark Souls. Bloodborne is good, but Dark Souls is the way to go."

Destiny on the other hand, is tons of fun with friends though the story content in the game is a little lacking (If you go over to r/destinythegame and or read things about the lore online it can get pretty deep).

OoT was an amazing experience the first time, but it was given to us during a time where console games were largely linear.  The 3D version is amazing, yes, but it doesn't change it's general linear style.    It's this opinion that generally leads me to suggest Wind Waker HD for Wii U owners.  It is an absolutely gorgeous game. It has immensely fun side quests and stuff to occupy time.  It is linear in a way, yes, but you can hop in your boat and just start exploring.  You can't do that in OoT or MM.  I absolutely think it is as equally emotionally enthralling as OoT, given it's almost direct connection, historically.  It is an awesome play on the Wii U.  Don't get me wrong.  This is just how I feel we should be suggesting Zelda to newcomers.  I think anybody who plays any Zelda game, and becomes a Zelda fan, should put OoT second on their list if it wasn't already the first, simply because it was the game that gave way for all other Zelda games after it.  So to sum this up with a tl;dr, I say get Wind Waker HD for the Wii U, and then play OoT 3D.  Beyond that, you could play any of them and love it as much as the last one.....well, maybe not spirit trax..."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3crc0o,tdi07,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:12:05 2015 UTC,Shadow of Mordor is probably the best.  Depending on what you like you could also consider Titanfall or Lego Batman
ShouldIbuythisgame,3crc0o,Gammby5874,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:27:36 2015 UTC,i have titan fall and no to lego batman. I am also considering Far Cry 4 and DA:I. I have heard FC4 is too similar to FC3 but i did enjoy 3. DA:I looks fun and i played the demo for a bit but I feel like i would get bored with it.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3crc0o,Gammby5874,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:08:16 2015 UTC,"If you're able to go up to the $30's, both are good games. I would say go for Far Cry if you liked 3. I got DA:I after playing no DA games nor caring much for the system and it's alright to me. In hindsight I would never pay full price, but it was worth the sale I got it on some Deals with Gold a while back. There is tons to do, but I have yet to sit playing it for hours. I think personally, I just like reading everything that it feels like ages before anything fun happens."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3crc0o,Rbeattie98,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:36:18 2015 UTC,I am split between shadow of mordor or DA:I. I wish The Witcher or ESO was apart of this deal. I think I may go with shadow because its cheaper. Do you think its better than assassins creed?
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cqpsf,TouphiLTouphi,7,Fri Jul 10 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"I would wait for it to go on sale before you make a decision.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cqpsf,Openworldgamer47,2,Fri Jul 10 04:40:07 2015 UTC,"I would say no honestly. The atmosphere is a lot more lively in New Vegas and the graphics are better. But in general from what you're telling us you disliked about Fallout 3 you aren't going to find Fallout: New Vegas much of an improvement.  The world in Fallout: New Vegas is much more developed, locations feel more alive, although they are still sparse. Fallout: New Vegas still contains the VATS system you mentioned you disliked in the exact same way, the locations can be interesting at times though and very interesting if you read into the lore and RobCo terminals scattered around the wastes.  If you see it on sale for $5-$10 I still think it's worth a shot, it's a very different atmosphere, and I think that some would find the change good."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cqpsf,Flgibson97,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:15:06 2015 UTC,"I guess I should add that deep immersion can usually trump bad gameplay, for me. Stuff like the Gothic series or arguably Morrowind. So I can put up with VATS and whatnot so long as I feel, like... in my character. Plus, I've heard things about no-VATS builds and something about a super-immersive challenge mode of some sort. That kind of set up, limiting myself, sounds a bit appealing.  I think my interest kind of rests on one question which I think FO3 really failed on. Does the world stand on its own as believable and alive, or does it rely on ""by the way, post-apocalyptic!!"" as its only defining setting?"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cqpsf,Zeroboy27,2,Fri Jul 10 01:24:49 2015 UTC,"There's a mode called hardcore where you have to maintain your food/thirst/sleep reserves. The game isn't that immersive really, the only time in Fallout: New Vegas where I genuinally felt like I was part of the world around me was in the games amazing DLCs.   Fallout is a game that I love and have played my entire life, and immersion just isn't one of the games defining factors to me. This may just be because I've replayed Fallout: New Vegas 20 times I dont know.   I've always just felt like Fallout: New Vegas improves as you play the game, the factions fighting begin to make sense, the quests become more engaging, and the companions you can recruit become more interesting.  It's so weird saying so many bad things about this game after never criticizing it before. If you really are into lore and interesting characters as well as awesome loot Fallout: New Vegas does a find job at that.  Oh and also you'll never find a game that gives you more freedom then Fallout does, of course besides Oblivion and Skyrim which are equals imo"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cqpsf,Zeroboy27,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:35:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the great explanations. I think it's worth picking up just to see for myself :) Not that much of a loss even if it's mediocre... I'd still probably finish the story and stuff.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cqpsf,Zeroboy27,2,Sat Jul 18 04:27:45 2015 UTC,"Fallout 3 had a pretty bland color palette, not gonna lie. Now New Vegas isn't MUCH better, but I find it more open slightly more colorful. I played NV first and I fell in love with it, I'm on my thirteenth playthrough now. But Fallout 3 mde me feel kinda claustrophobic.  The story of the main game is pretty dull, but the DLC makes it so much better. NV's DLC has a connecting arc, even if it isn't blatantly stated.  IMHO: Get it, replayability is huge, DLCs are glorious, flat out amazing mechanics. If you go straight to FO 4, you will probably feel pretty behind."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cqpsf,Zeroboy27,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:18:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, Fallout 4 was certainly my main motivation here. I'm not very familiar with the 'verse, and I figured if I'm going into 4 it might help to at least know some terms/etc. It's been years since I played 3.  I plan on getting all the DLC, absolutely. Plus, with these kind of games I usually just outright assume the sidequests/add-on content are going to be better than the main quest."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cqpsf,Dardoleon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:26:42 2015 UTC,"I've put well over 200 hours into New Vegas alone. It provides plenty of challenge for you by giving you a large world to do with what you want. You can sneak around, or go in guns blazing. You can stick to the path you're supposed to, or you can go get lost in the desert. Don't even get me started on Hardcore mode..."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cqpsf,limination,0,Fri Jul 10 01:36:07 2015 UTC,Hardcore mode felt really gimmicky to me personally.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cqpsf,Rbeattie98,2,Fri Jul 10 01:39:55 2015 UTC,"Well it's actually a very strong point if you like to micro manage all of your stuff. You have to eat, drink water, and watch your health slowly regenerate instead of immediately gaining it back with stimpacks.  If you do get New Vegas though, watch out. While caps are more abundant, stimpacks skyrocketed in price. I think in Fallout 3, the base price was like 40 or 50 caps per stim, but in New Vegas, the base price goes up to around 110 caps per stim. It's ridiculous."

I also like it a lot less than Fallout 3, so I think you should stay away from it.  However, if you catch it on a sale, for under $10, which happens quite often on Steam, I'd say at least try it. For under $10, and you still don't like it, well at least you tried. The game is still great, and a lot of people like it more than 3, so maybe you will as well."

Similar to Terraria but instead of the building aspect of it, it's just harvesting, crafting and fighting.   How the game works is that you harvest during the level and craft during the level but at the same time have to fight off monsters and such and you try and fight to the end of the level and that will take you to a safe zone where you can purchase items and make items, once you are done you leave the safe zone and head to another level and fight through that.  It's very enjoyable with a mate or two and another aspect that is quite appealing and fun is the unlocking aspect, where you try and play and unlock more characters and items!  Enjoy mate!"

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cp8y4,DarkAutumn,17,Thu Jul 9 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"I'm going to do this without spoilers, since you're obviously new to the game.  There are 4 pieces of DLC, and -- in my mind -- they're intended to be played in the order in which they were released.  But keep in mind that the one you'll probably enjoy the most is actually #3, Old World Blues.  The first one, ""Dead Money"" is good and creepy -- it receives its share of criticism because you end up temporarily losing your inventory, and having to scrabble together your arms and armor from the things that are available isn't always easy, but it's definitely worth playing first.  It sets the table for the events that occur in ""Honest Hearts,"" ""Old World Blues,"" and ""Lonesome Road.""  I highly recommend you play these DLC modules in that order, in fact.  And I do recommend you play them all.  It's a much richer experience if you do.  Good luck!  I wish I could go back and play these for the very first time again, in much the way that I wish I could see Star Wars for the first time again."

Old World Blues has a very strange and constant sense of humor that makes it a very welcome and well executed change in tone. It adds a large and open section of world for you to explore, full of secrets and challenges and side quests.  Overall, I'd personally consider it not just the best New Vegas DLC,  but my favorite DLC from any game ever."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cp8y4,RamboManfist,3,Thu Jul 9 19:57:07 2015 UTC,The only reason I recommended playing them in the order of release is that there's quite a bit of foreshadowing in Dead Money that alludes to the events of the other 3.  So you'll miss some of that if you play it out of order.

Honestly, just skip 'em and never play 'em, your experience will be so much better, and you'll have the envy of those of us who suffered through them.  Dead Money is, in fact, so hated that there exists a mod that, when you go to start it, it kicks you back out, pops all the achievements, and gives you all the DLC's loot in a chest and adds whatever perks. All the benefits with none of the suckage.  Honest Hearts is just boring.  Old World Blues is fun as shit but it's not for everybody. Do you like corny 1950s sci-fi? If so, you'll love it. If not, well, it's still fun and worth the price of admission.  Lonesome Road is cool as shit, but super linear. It reminded me of like a cross between Borderlands and Fallout. All the environments are super fun. I seem to remember there being some kind of collectibles you don't want to miss, regarding ED-E, so maybe grab a guide.  None of them really add to the main story. They're all 100% modular. The four together form their own story, but if you don't care about it (it's based on the Burned Man you hear about from Caesar's camp) the latter two are just as fun."

If you want an MMO experience or even a decent multiplayer experience, then no, ED is lacking.  I will warn about the grind though. People love to say that ""you write your own story"" but the lack of in depth detail in ED's world prevents you from doing this well unless you have a superbly vivid imagination. Once you're past the learning stages and have earned enough money to be in a decent ship (takes a few weeks at most), then there aren't many new things left to experience."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cph1i,ComJak,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:29:09 2015 UTC,"Can you comment on the trading aspect? Pirating other ships? Factions? How's the combat? Can you start an enterprise? I'm interested in this game for the single player, and every time it goes on sale I think, ""this looks exactly like something I want"", but I never follow through because I'm worried that I'm going to get bored after flying in the same direction for 15 minutes while nothing happens. I love grinding, as long as I get something in the end... is it worth it?"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cph1i,_Ganon,3,Fri Jul 10 02:51:34 2015 UTC,"Trading is purely that. Trading. The problem is with both a solo mode (online but no players will be spotted) and an online mode, trading in open will be hell from pirates. Thus most people trade in solo mode. This lends itself to a lack of decent pay from pirating. No one wants to face a pirate so they trade in solo. Pirating is really un profitable. You cant start an enterprise like in the X series. You can literally do these 5 things: bounty hunt, pirate, mine, explore, trade. That's about it and the problem the game has is that doing each of these things is really a one and done deal. Once you've mined a little or done a few RES sites for bounties, you've done them all. There's no VARIETY to the game's environment.  Trading is simply: find a station that exports XXX. Find station that desires XXX. Ship between the 2 and hope you don't get interdicted. Obviously some trade routes are way more profitable and that's where the fun is I guess. Some online tools help you deal with trading as the ingame systems for travel/trade are shit/non-existant. Thing is, afaik, while you trading DOES influence the global economy, it's really not significant enough to do anything with or have ANY meaning. The only purpose to trading is to make money.  In terms of factions, the whole powerplay things is pretty fucked. Read the /r/elitedangerous subreddit to get a glimpse. It was supposed to be a way to put context behind your grind but really, all it did was add 2 new ways to grind and one of them is simply trading and the other is simply more combat. On top of that, it is currently in a pretty bad state where nothing really makes sense. Other than that, there are player made factions which is really the only saving grace for a multiplayer experience. Player groups bicker and fight and stuff you'd expect and really makes the game dynamic.  HOWEVER. and i mean HOWEVER. The combat is the biggest letdown for me. It had so much potential. All the underlying structure is perfect. BUT if you google or search ""shield cell meta"" you'll see the problem with it. Essentially, all combat ships should just stack up on shield cells (essentially health potions) to be viable. This is due to the fact that if your shields are down, the enemy only needs to target your power plant (done automatically essentially) and you can die with >50% hull left. Even the most powerful ships succumb to a few rail guns to the powerplant. In addition, armour slots are USELESS as they don't actually protect submodules (aka the powerplant!). This leads to people going all out on shields because they are forced to. What does this lead to? an excessive use of laser weapons. In pvp, you have basically 2 options; a full SCB (shield cell bank) with lasers, or a full SCB with multicannons. The whole SCB also causes encounters to last WAY longer than they need to, up to 15 minutes per encounter between large ships. And at the end of it, all the loser needs to do is run away (high wake out) which can't be stopped short of shooting out their FTL drives. So in a perfect world, combat would last 15 minutes until one ship is out of shield cells, then it would high wake out and bugger off never to be seen again.  Combat vs AI is much more variable and enjoyable because they don't cheese the shit out of broken mechanics.  As for grinding, if you love grinding, I say go for it. Grinding your way to a full A-rated anaconda (largest ship as of now) can take months but like I said before, the grinding is contextless and repetitive (which I guess is the definition of grind). If you plan to simply grind, do it in solo. You will gain nothing from playing open.  Sorry for the wall of text. As you can tell, I really wanted to enjoy the game and with nothing currently out to match this experience, it's as good as it gets for most people."

I have 6 of those (bought in a bundle perhaps, don't remember) and tried playing them a few times. I was put off by the poor tutorial, steep learning curve, terrible voice acting/writing, and that the main villains were called the cock (spelled differently).  That said, I've wanted to give them another shot. Should I keep trying with those, or is E:D going to offer something more fulfilling? If I should stick with X, which is the recommended title? I'm not wild about the whole building a manufacturing empire or whatever that aspect of X. Mostly want to have the space trucker experience.   The ones I own are X-Tension, X: Beyond the Frontier, X2: The Threat, X3: Reunion, Terran Conflict, and Albion Prelude."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cph1i,bluebogle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:19:37 2015 UTC,"I've only played a few minutes of X so I can't compare but I did watch a couple of videos. The tutorials in ED are pretty sparse and focus on combat. Not the best tutorials tbh. Learning curve is not really steep besides the actual flying. Once you can fly, it's a pretty easy game to figure out. Voice acting and sound is great and there are no main villains. From whjat i've read and seen of X (excluding rebirth), ED is way less immersive and detailed. But if you want the space trucker experience just making money, then ED has an okay trade system I guess. Find some route loops and just make money for upgrades/new ships.  I haven't played it yet but have watched videos as well but give evochron mercenary a shot maybe. Looks pretty intriguing."

It had the perfect balance between realism/difficulty/fun - for me anyway."

Elite has much prettier graphics, and everything is at a realistic scale (no toy planets).  Elite is first and foremost a sim, whereas Freelancer was first and foremost an action game. In Elite, the focus is on mastering how to fly your ship.  Elite's space combat actually works really well.  Freelancer's universe was packed with stuff to discover... new wormholes, secret bases, obscure prototype weapons. Elite doesn't really have any of that.  Elite has the best and most immersive audio that I've ever experienced in any game.    I also loved Freelancer, and I'm digging Elite too. But largely for different reasons.   Not a game for everyone, but what it does well it does very well."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cph1i,sushi_cw,2,Fri Jul 10 07:57:03 2015 UTC,"I bought E:D because I wanted to play a new X-Wing vs Tie-Fighter and SC is not coming out for a long while (never considered NMS but it's on the same boat). Wasn't disappointed and I've put more hours in it than I'd like to admit.  Elite is a game about flying ships. It does not hold your hand and the learning curve is steep but rewarding. You have easy progress in the beginning and it's fun to get new ships and experiment with different modules and builds, for PvE bounty hunting, trading, mining, smuggling, exploration or PvP.   There is somewhat of a grind when you want to get bigger ships. There is no end-game goal so you do have to make your own. Either be it getting a name on a system on the other side of the galaxy, reaching some rank, getting some ship, or just playing to relax (it does that very well also).   There is lore and a story line being developed. You can pledge to a Power and it makes you enemy of other powers and fight to expand to other systems, so it opens up interesting PvP opportunities (if you play in Open, in Solo it's just you and NPCs in the same Galaxy).  Combat is satisfying. There are some issues with the current combat meta that are being reworked (module damage) and it can be challenging. There are player driven events like races and operations  to flip allegiances of systems that Frontier also encourages. Exploration is not for everyone, especially for long trips but the views are stunning. Trading can be thrilling if you play in open, since the NPCs are not much of a challenge (if you have a ship able to run away).  You can also get great moments of thrill like being ambushed, running away with damaged canopy and trying to reach a station with only a few minutes left of oxygen. Or accidentally hitting a security guard and everyone turns against you.  It's a great game if you like to pilot your ship and the immersion is amazing. If you ever turn the game into a grind for the biggest ship or whatever, you will burn out."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cph1i,rubenmfl,3,Fri Jul 10 13:15:15 2015 UTC,"No, absolutely not, and I'll explain why in my opinion.  The game is absolutely stunningly beautiful, I won't even begin to contest that, but that's about the sum of what I found of worth.  The actual depth of gameplay is sorely lacking.    The economics portion of the game seems very simplistic.  Find a good trade route, run goods y from station x to station z.  Repeat with alternative trade route.    The combat I found tedious and boring.  I know there are people who love it but I cannot stand it.  This one is my own fault for not doing further research on the game before purchase but the lack of yaw drives me insane regardless of the fact that I grew accustomed to it and the combat itself seems just rather unfulfilling.    On top of this the actual data about what your ship can do or be equipped with seems to be needlessly obfuscated or just straight out not there.  I want full range of information about what I'm putting on my ship and the capacity to have real depth of customization and I found ED's system to seem rather shallow compared to EvE, X3 (any of them) or hell just about any other space sim out there.    Lastly, content.  There is fuck all to do in the game it seems.  You could try bounty hunting but you know what that entails?  You aimlessly wander around a system without doing any research to track down your target save finding out what system he's in and then hoping to stumble across an Unknown Signal Source and pray the RNG provides you with your mission target.    It's those types of things that turned me off of the game more than anything else.  That kind of mission design is poor by design.  Who the hell designs a task to build immersion and provide entertainment that is entirely dependent on fucking chance to even ENCOUNTER your target?  How is that good game design?    Regardless there are a couple things I should note.  I only made about 10mil credits as it seemed like a pointless grind then I gave up.  I did not try exploring (though it seemed rather tedious even if you did get to enjoy gorgeous sights) so I may be missing something great there.  I did not engage particularly much in multiplayer so perhaps that's where all the fun is.  But from what I experienced of the game I'd stay the hell away till the price drops or they decide to put some content/direction in the game.  TLDR: No, do not.  Game lacks direction and fun, it's like owning a beautifully painted pet rock.  Neat to look at but that's all there is to fucking do till you throw it at something.  Edit:  Also to be clear the game is designed to play nothing like Freelancer combat wise, so keep that in mind.  Freelancer is one of my favorite games of all time and this is basically nothing like it imo."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cph1i,aniaran,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:10:15 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of very good criticism in the comments, but I want to make a short point.  The game is a grind only if you make it one. In other words, you have to use your imagination and do what you want from the get-go. I've been playing almost every day since release and look forward to getting on when I get home tonight. There's no denying this game is FUN to people who like sandbox space games, of which this is the best for now. That said, it doesn't always ""click"" for a lot of people. ""Mile wide, inch deep"" is a complaint I hear a lot.  The game has a tight-knit and mostly-amazing community that's very helpful and fun to play with. Sure there are assholes and a couple hackers but they're in every game and FD has been shadow banning hackers lately. PVP is incredibly fun when you get 16 spaceships together in a massive battle, like I did with my group last night against another group.  Speaking of which, if you decide on taking the plunge, join a player group with a TeamSpeak channel! It made the game 100% more enjoyable for me.  In the end, all I can recommend is watching YouTube vids of people who enjoy the game, playing the game. If you get it, add me: Capn Murica. Maybe see you in the black?"

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cotzo,Rbeattie98,0,Fri Jul 10 04:34:45 2015 UTC,MCC is horribly optimized and many would say stay away even if you've never played a Halo game (plus if you've played them all then what's the point of rebuying) 2. HALO 5 isn't released yet and all we really know is that there's no split screen 3. FIFA is on PC too. I'd personally just stick with PC. It has a lot that the consoles can't offer.

Surviving is hard. Even after you get the hang of it, it's very challenging. It can get very repetitive tho. I'd advice watching a video of it before getting it.  Don't Starve - 2.5d survival in a creepy world where 98% of everything living in it, is out to kill you or will be. Quite hard, especially when you first start playing. Again, another one that gets repetitive fast. But it's a good game. It also has multiplayer if you get Don't Starve Together.

I can play the game adequately without needing a well organized guild/party, but I am certainly rewarded for being in one. The fact that there are no subscriptions is great too. It's nice to know that content will continue to be released, and you don't have to pay an arm and a leg to get it. The game looks great, and it's a lot of fun. Also, top tier armor is more for looks and extremely high level mini dungeons. The vast majority 95% of the game is not gated by top tier armor and weapons.   As for it being complicated? That's what I mean by being rewarded. It's not overwhelmingly hard to get through most stuff, but being in an organized group makes it a lot easier, and you will die less.

If you're still unsure, you should watch the Angry Joe Show review of GW2, it's what sold me. http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ax-_06Acj8Y"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cmns1,madeinitaly1519,3,Thu Jul 9 10:10:56 2015 UTC,"I loved GW2 and played a lot of it for the first two years but fell out of it because my friends had long since stopped playing. I always recommend it because pretty much no matter who you are you'll probably enjoy it if you're interested enough to ask.  Why it's different from other MMOs:  No Holy Trinity: This is a big one for me, I always hated that when you picked your class you were pretty much locking into your combat method. GW2 actually does break this meta. A Mesmer (a deceitful mage class) can run amok amongst a crowd of a dozen people and take little damage in WvW if they're skilled enough and the dozen are not. There are no healing classes (there's mostly only self healing) or tank classes (though some classes have more trouble tanking than others), rather instead the trinity that GW2 supports is support-control-damage:  Support: proactive attempts at improving your allies (and yourself really).  This includes buffs like protection (reduces damage) or might (increase damage) and positioning yourself in front of ranged projectiles to take them for your ally.  This rarely includes healing, and when it does it's normally in the form of healing over time, so you still need to be proactive in applying it.  Control: Influencing what your opponent will/can do, this mostly involves debuffs like blind (miss next attack) or interrupts like stuns.  Control is important to stop/diminish powerful blows (applying blind during a wind up animation spares you the strong attack while it still goes on CD) and plays a huge role in PvP  (you want to make sure you wont waste a strong attack if you might get blinded/interrupted/etc, and instead might wait until right after you disable them or they use up their disables)  Damage: pretty straight forward   The nice part of GW2 is any of the classes can fill these roles, a warrior running banners and shouts could support allies by applying buffs, or a thief running deceptions can support allies by cloaking and healing them at opportune times, or a necromancer can support allies by curing debuffs or converting them into buffs with their wells.  Combat is actually real-time VS real-time strategy: Most MMO's feel just like a strategy game where you can only make one type of unit and rely on other teammates to make the others. You stand there, run through your clicks in a typical order, often times unable to both move and attack, but not in GW2. Dodge rolling is a very large part of combat, because it's the best defense you have, while it can do a lot of things depending on your build ultimately it's a moment of invulnerability that you will need to survive. You can also almost always attack while moving (there are a handful of skills that you have to be stationary for, but they make sense, like laying a trap) and your attacks miss if they don't actually collide with their target (if say the target has moved out of melee range your melee attacks will miss). There also isn't autopathing, you need to move yourself to your enemy, the game wont do it for you.  Very Little Grind is involved: The leveling system is very kind, as long as you continue to fight enemies of the same level as you all levels after 15 will take about the same amount of time, rather than the exponential XP system normally found in MMOs. After that gear isn't too much grinding to get, but the biggest thing that comes down to is that because each class can be played a ton of different ways you might want a handful of different gear sets, so depending on how may play-styles you want to engage in you might have a fair amount of grinding, but I'd say that's pretty reasonable.  WvWvW: Easily my favorite gameplay mode, three servers in an all out war with one another involving sieges and supply lines (supply is used to make siege weapons and repair things like gates and keep walls). In large groups you try to lay siege to keeps, and in small groups you interrupt supply to keeps by attacking supply caravans and capturing supply camps. There are four maps, one each as a home map for each server (where they spawn in the middle of the map, making movement easier), and a shared map (where everyone spawns at an edge of the map). Normally the shared map will have something like a thousand people on it at a time and the home maps have a few hundred. And sometimes most people on a map clash and it's insane. WvW is great for playing with others because there is safety in numbers and you can do a lot with a handful of people (it's very difficult to take even a small unguarded keep on your own, but with 3-5 people it's pretty straightforward) though even on your own you can pick off stragglers and block off supply.  No huge questlog: there's technically only one quest in the game, your story quest, but aside from that there are pockets all over the map where people need help, maybe a village keeps getting attacked by centaurs and they want help shoring up defenses/killing them off. These area quests aren't overly exciting, but I find it more interesting than the cycle of -> go to town -> get all the quests possible -> kill/grab anything with a quest marker over it -> return to town -> cache in all quest -> get all the quests possible -> etc. I didn't find the additional stories they put out all that interesting, but I had already started to fade in and out of GW2 at that point, so I only got the story in patches (I dislike that each week they would swap out the old part of the story for the new one, which means if you didn't play between updates you would miss that chunk of the story)  Exploration is fun: You actually want to see each corner of the map, finding all the lookouts and points of interest. Finding all elements of an area yields a nice reward, normally in the form of a bulk of crafting materials found in the area and one or two uncommon pieces of gear, but the reward is hardly the reason to to do it, the environments themselves are pretty interesting (except near the endgame a lot of areas are very similar, which is too bad).  TL;DR yes"

I did and gw1 was incredible I probably logged over 1500 hours in it over a few years with several friends.  You can imagine how excited we were then for gw2. We really really WANTED to love it. But we couldn't. Guild wars 1 had gear and level limits that were easy to hit, which meant the game was actually about talent, tactics, and creating interesting character builds.   Guild wars 2 is not that. It's wow, in the guild wars universe. The quests, the exploration, the raids, even the pvp.  all of it felt like wow, which is fine if you want to play wow, but was a huge disappointment for me and my friends.  We expected a new and improved guild wars 1, where tactics and skill and clever character building reigned supreme, and instead got a grind fest version of the universe we loved.  I've heard lots of people love gw2, but I just can't, for me it was like watching the matrix 2 directly after the first one."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cmns1,flash_freakin_gordon,2,Thu Jul 9 02:39:17 2015 UTC,"Nope, we're fresh of the proverbial MMO boat more or less. A few of us have played a little Secret World and a little Marvel Heroes 2015. I even played Archeage for about five hours before I started feeling like the cash shop was pushed a little too much. I probably should have mentioned that in the main post. But yeah, I've heard that fans of the first game are not always fans of the second."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cmns1,flash_freakin_gordon,2,Thu Jul 9 02:57:38 2015 UTC,"I actually loved secret world, except for the adhd writing anyway.   If you think your group would like wow, (I did for a while btw) then you might like gw2. One thing they really did well I think is the social exploration events.   Sometimes you'll just be wandering through a zone and baddies will rain from the sky (usually not literally) and the people in the zone just jump in and take things out even though there is no plan or group or raid actually happening. Sometimes you get crazy big things like fire elementals and whatnot and your fighting it with like 30 other strangers.   That was probably my favorite part of the game, again though nearly complete lack of tactics required compared to the first game.   Overall I just found they'd replaced tactics and character builds with grinding and I couldn't get past it. If it would have come out from some other developer and not been named guild wars I probably would have liked it as much as secret world."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cn8bg,The_Slime,2,Thu Jul 9 05:38:26 2015 UTC,Thanks man!
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cn8bg,wipeout4wh,4,Thu Jul 9 05:51:14 2015 UTC,"I have played both and would take Terraria first any day. RoR is VERY difficult, confusing, generally has a high skill requirement while Terraria is accessible and highly replayable."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cn8bg,Chinesedave,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:03:52 2015 UTC,"If Terraria is not on sale for at least 75% off, buy Risk of Rain. Terraria is constantly going on sale for just a few dollars, so you'll want to wait for that. You can always buy Terraria anyway since it will be so cheap."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cn8bg,Cyberuz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:39:55 2015 UTC,"Two very different games. I LOVE Terraria though, the depth to the game is pretty huge, opens up alot after unlocking hardmode - Alot of RPG elements to it, with crafting, gathering resources, exploring caves, building houses for npcs.   RoR is very fun, very roguelike with perma death to characters, completely action platformer."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cn8bg,Brad2154,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:38:50 2015 UTC,"Both of them you should be playing with your friends. Terraria isnt a rpg, its a dress up/flex simulator.  The story is hard to follow and your first time through without a guild will be endless, without a doubt you will hafto look up what to do.  RoR is an extremely punishing game, you might not have alot to unlock at first but then that I HAFTO HAVE IT ALL attitude you get while playing binding kicks in. They could have made a cool RPG out of the game (dont buy this game unless friends are playing with you)  ROR>Terraria buy terraria."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cn8bg,TrinidadianBitch,-1,Sun Jul 12 17:30:07 2015 UTC,Both amazing games but im gonna have to go with Risk of Rain because its alot easier to grasp and is a very fun game to pick up and play!
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cn8bg,Suff0c8r,3,Thu Jul 9 05:53:12 2015 UTC,I have a little bit more experience with Terraria so my pick would Terraria in this instance. I have seen some videos on Risk of Rain but I know I have a lot of fun with my friends with Terraria. Hope you have found your deciding post. :)
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cmwnq,dadaduf,7,Thu Jul 9 03:41:27 2015 UTC,"Terraria is an RPG mainly with sandbox-like elements, which is very different from Minecraft and is also 2D. From personal experience, I love the game. There's quite a lot of crafting going on and you may need the wiki to help you in certain areas, but for the most part the game is about fighting bosses and exploring.   If you're into those kind of games about exploring, finding new stuff, opening chests in dungeons and so on, then Terraria is jam-packed with content. It's so much better if you have friends on Steam to play with now that there is Steam multiplayer integration.   Not sure if my information is going to help but hopefully you may find something that you like!"

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cmwnq,BrainOnLoan,5,Thu Jul 9 04:19:43 2015 UTC,"Don't starve and Terraria are the best of the bunch, IMHO. Both are shockingly full of content and fun, made by great devs."

It had different levels of difficulty with simulator battles being VERY realistic. It's all planes from WWI to the end of the Korean War so if that's not what you're looking for then just ignore this game.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cl4ql,pompadours,2,Wed Jul 8 23:57:27 2015 UTC,Ah if you like RTS there is Homeworld remastered on Steam which is quite often mentioned as the best of all time for the genre.   Based on your other likes Civ V complete is an absolute must if you don't have it. A ton of replay ability there and the expansions are absolutely worth it.   Sins of Solar Empire could also be up your alley. It's a 4x/RTS game set in space and would fit in line with your other likes.   All of those are great single player so Internet shouldn't be an issue.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cmjvh,Brandan182,2,Thu Jul 9 02:09:51 2015 UTC,It's fun but personally I like mario kart as a splitscreen party game. That's my preference
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cmjvh,azknight,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:26:37 2015 UTC,"It's a tough call since they're very different games. I'd say that Mario Kart 8 is the ""better"" game in terms of polish and quality, but Hyrule Warriors has a lot more content (and it's a great game in its own right), even before the massive DLC. For single-player only, I'd give the edge to Hyrule, but you can't really go wrong with either."

I really enjoy both of these games (two of the 6 games I own on the Wii U), and Mario Kart has definitely seen more play time by me, but that's because my wife loves to play it.  I personally think you can go wrong with any of them, but for solo play Hyrule Warriors wins hands down."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cmurs,johnson4253,2,Thu Jul 9 03:24:27 2015 UTC,"New releases in the PCM series are usually full of bugs and not a huge improvement over the previous installment. My advice would be to always go for the 1 year old version (in this case PCM 2014), because by now it's fully patched and half price.  http://pcmdaily.com has an excellent 2015 database for the 2014 game."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cmurs,Procerius,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:54:43 2015 UTC,"ELI5 what this database includes. Is this something I can create myself? What would one need to be able to create said database? Is it free?   Sorry, I'm on mobile. I tried to look myself, but I was struggling."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cmurs,Procerius,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"It's basically a free fan-made mod for PCM 2014 that updates stuff like races, riders and teams to the current season. This takes away the biggest incentive to buy the expensive PCM 2015 that just got released. Like many mods it's not super easy to install, but it's no rocket science either. PM me if you decide to buy the game; I'll send you instructions on how to get the mod up and running.  I have to warn you though. Don't expect the management part of the PCM series to even come close to OOTP in terms of quality and depth. OOTP is like Football Manager. It's a great simulation of the management aspect of the sport and you don't get to directly control the players. PCM is more like FIFA (or Madden/NHL if you're American); the best part of the game is the real-time 3d simulation of the sport, in which you fully control your players/cyclists yourself. The long-term career part in FIFA and PCM is rather bland and often makes little sense."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cmurs,fastfriz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:19:34 2015 UTC,"1) First you need to install this one: http://pcmdaily.com/infusions/pro_download_panel/download.php?did=995  2) Then you patch it with this one: http://pcmdaily.com/infusions/pro_download_panel/download.php?did=999  Both are installers. After those two steps you have a much improved game, but it's still 2014.  3) This one will take you to 2015: http://pcmdaily.com/infusions/pro_download_panel/download.php?did=1003  4) This one is optional and improves upon number 3: http://pcmdaily.com/infusions/pro_download_panel/download.php?did=1023  Number 3 and 4 don't have installers and have to be unzipped with a program like http://www.7-zip.org/ Do you know how unzipping works?

Handhelds are great for short sittings, but unfortunately many games on these platforms are targeted towards kids.   Majoras Mask creeped me out as a kid, and I was never able to finish it.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3ckk5e,thetony2313,3,Thu Jul 9 15:30:36 2015 UTC,"Have you tried any of the Metal Gear games? If not I suggest you do that, because this might be your final chance before MGSV releases, I don't know what other platforms you have, but it seems to be one of the best games to be released this year, so it might be of your interest?  If you don't own a PC or console however, the Vita lets you play almost every Metal Gear, so it shouldn't be a that big problem.  Here are the three games I own for the VITA:   MGS HD Collection, contains MGS2 and 3. 2 is a bit awkward, if you haven't played the first one, it will be very confusing, trust me. 3 on the other hand is fantastic and can definately be played as your first MGS since it takes place first chronologically. It's a survival stealth game with a nice deep story and is certainly a game aimed at adults. MGS3 is also avaible on the 3DS. MGS1 (Might not be avaible on PSN where you live) is a great start if you plan to play the entire series, it's very stealth focused so if you don't like the genre, you might want to get one of the other games in the series, the newer games focus less on stealth and much more on being tactical. Peace Walker Is the only game I think you need to play to understand MGSV, it's similiar to MGS3, but instead of a bigger mission, it's split up into levels. Before each level you get to chose your gear. It does however feature quite alot of RPG elements, grinding and is made for Co-op. It can still be played alone, but the boss fights can get quite boring after a while due to their huge amount of health.   I suggest you play 3, ask yourself if you want more, and from then continue onto either MGS1 or Peace Walker depending on if you plan to get MGSV anytime soon.  There's a demo for 3DS, but IMO it doesn't give MGS3 a fair representation, it felt like big parts of the game were missing the last time I played it.  I hope I helped you!"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3ckk5e,BreakingBreakfast_,3,Wed Jul 8 20:36:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Just picked up MGS 1 and MGS 2-3 HD on the PSN ""Big in Japan - sale"".

Besides being entirely free, they are trying to keep doing expansions and such.   Everyone has to start somewhere, and the game is pretty easy to learn.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3clqmd,Echo1883,2,Wed Jul 8 22:07:56 2015 UTC,"No, you get everything in the game for free, IF you want to grind for it. Basically you get a ""basic"" playable deck for every ""class"" in the game. Then, by playing a bunch of games with each class unlocks some more basic cards for them. You can then spend in game currency on more card packs. Or you can just spend real money on them, like any real life card game.   I think they did a good job making it truly free. You do not NEED to spend money (that I know of) but it certainly gets you built up faster and takes away the grind. If you have the money and want to support Blizzard than I would drop some money on unlocking the expansions and such. Otherwise you are in for a lot of grinding to get the currency to unlock them."

It should check all the boxes (authenticity, atmosphere, economics) and replayability is high. The diversity of factions and units is also nice (as opposed to Medieval II, Shogun or Empire which have relatively similar units/factions)  Medieval II is a arguably a better game overall, but can feel a bit dated as a 9 year old game.

Very good game from a technical and visual standpoint, and there were some good moments - mostly organically created, like stumbling upon your nemesis someplace while on your way elsewhere - but I felt the same way."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cke74,Jomeaga,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:05:15 2015 UTC,"Yea I agree, the fun parts were when you first unlock something. And when you stumbled upon nemesis like in the middle of a mission unexpectedly and everything goes to shit."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cke74,Manuel15456,3,Thu Jul 9 03:19:03 2015 UTC,"The Pre Sequel was overall a fun game but not as good as BL2. It adds low gravity, butt slams, laser guns, and the ability to freeze enemies. While at first oxygen may seem like a problem but you'll rarely ever run out. Very fun to play with friends. Assassin's Creed Rogue I felt was better than Unity and is more like a sequel to Black Flag. If you liked the ability to use the ship in Black Flag you'll be using it again which I loved but not sure if you did. It also allows you to play as a assassin turned Templar which I found cool. Dying Light I had a good experience with as the parkour and zombie killing was fun, but after finishing the main story and some side missions I got bored as there wasn't much left to do. Can't say much on Shadow of Mordor (as I haven't played but my friends say they liked it)  other than it's a completely unique story in the LOTR universe and that it provides this cool thing called the nemesis system where if you hurt someone in combat and don't kill them they can come back with the scars where you wounded and rise in the ranking of bad guy's seeking revenge. (I suggest Googling the nemesis system as I don't do the greatest job explaining.)"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cke74,EnderESXC,3,Wed Jul 8 19:54:05 2015 UTC,"Personally, I enjoyed the land segments a lot more than the ship segments in Black Flag. But in ACIII, I enjoyed the ship segments more than the land segments. Maybe I'm a hypocrite, idk lol."

Didn't play Rogue but Black Flag was great and Rogue is apparently a BF clone.  Dying Light and SoM are easily the strongest of the listed games. I've played the crap out of SoM. Waiting for Dying Light to go on sale since I've played it at a friend's house and it seems like it wouldn't be fun solo."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cjf16,TimothyVH,4,Wed Jul 8 11:19:56 2015 UTC,"I'd say decide based on whether or not you enjoyed the base game enough to justify the cost. Alien Isolation was one of that games that I think started off really strong, but by the end I was sick of it.  As for the content, there's a lot of it, I suppose. You get extra maps for survivor mode and extra missions for scavenger mode, I believe. I never got around to playing the newer scavenger mode simply because I lost interest in the game before then.  Ultimately, I think that unless you're a hardcore Alien fan, you'll probably be satisfied with just the base game. The DLC is more of the same, and I don't think it really adds a lot that the base game doesn't already offer."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cjf16,Hellknightx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:57:06 2015 UTC,Yes. It adds replayability to an already perfect game.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cjxhz,myfriendian,7,Wed Jul 8 14:21:16 2015 UTC,"Both games are amazing experience and absolutely gorgeous. Seems like what is most important to you right now is graphics and replayability. I would give W3 the edge on graphics, and as far as replayability it kind of depends what you want.   GTA has the classic sense of replayability where even though you finish the main mission line there is still plenty of shenanigans to be had. Taking my time, I finished the game in 35 hours. For me personally though, once the main mission line ended I had no desire to do side quests, and the game kind of began feeling pointless. The side quests aren't all that interesting, and from what I experienced they're pretty much ""drive me here while people are shooting at us, then arrive somewhere and defend against people shooting at us."" That being said, there is still plenty to explore and what have you. Multiplayer is absolute garbage.   Witcher 3 I have put 71 hours into and have not finished the main quest line. The side stories are incredibly fleshed out and interesting, and it includes things like tracking down/hunting legendary monsters that terrorize villages and armies. Each monster has its strengths and weaknesses and you have to research before confronting them, it is awesome. The devs are releasing free DLC every week, so there is going to be lots to do.   Graphically, W3 has the edge. I'm running a 970 and I have lost count how many times I call my girlfriend over to my screen to show her new gorgeous scenery. The world is alive, wind blows through wheat fields (and makes decapitated heads roll around), and your characters fucking beard grows in real time. Best graphics I have ever seen in a game.  Hope that helps"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cjxhz,DooDooSwift,2,Wed Jul 8 18:29:20 2015 UTC,It looks like it's no contest! The Witcher 3 it is! Thank you so much for the detailed comment. Have you played the other two Witchers? Would I be missing much by not playing them or at least the first one? How does your frame rate fare at 1080? Would you suggest buying the season pass upfront with the game?
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cjxhz,DooDooSwift,3,Wed Jul 8 19:10:49 2015 UTC,"Never played them, never even youtubed the backstory like others recommend. Yet I still would say it's one of, if not the, best story I've ever experienced in a video game. Every character has a rich story and is someone you want to know more about.  One thing though before you make your decision, you are comparing an RPG to pretty much an action game, so where GTA is excitement right off the bat (with the exception of cooler cars/guns being unlocked down the road) Witcher you have to invest a bit of time into. It's still really fun but as with most RPGs your character doesn't really start off as a complete badass.  Glad I could help!"

I like to play more competitive multiplayer games and no matter what you can do in GTA V online there is another game that does it better.   Better golf games, racing games, heist game, shooter games... I just don't see the point honestly and the frustrating parts of it just make it that much less worth it to me.

It's the reason I upgraded from a 660 to a 970, since I couldn't stand playing it at 30 FPS. It's an absolutely incredible game. GTA V gets more and more broken with every patch, unfortunately, and while I want to love it, the witcher 3 is far and away a more well made game.   It's one of those games that you simply have to experience. If you don't play TW3 you're missing out, end of story."

The platforming is addicting. One of the few games I've ever replayed immediately after beating it.   I got Axiom Verge and lost interest after an hour or so. I enjoy retro graphics but these did nothing for me. The world felt bland and the controls felt clunky. I was very disappointed.

You're restricted to a lot of things based on what time of day it is, and there's no real goals or objectives. You'll spend most of your money on paying off your house payment and then immediately going back into debt because you wanted an even BIGGERer house.  But fuck I... I love this game. The stupid little characters aren't interesting to me but they kind of are? ""Oh Purrl the Cat is carrying a fishing rod she must be fishing"". They have stupid little catchphrases and personality quirks that come up, and weirdly enough even if you seem to start off hating them you start to like them JUST because they're familiar.  It's a simple game where you'll do nothing productive but it's not really meant for that. It's just meant to be peaceful and stress-free. It's charming, the graphics are smooth and pretty, the music is lovely and honestly there's a jaw-dropping amount of variety in items, clothing and just generally things to discover and collect.  So,  Pros: -No stress while playing -Charming as fuck -Great for time wasting -A LOT of stuff to do -Lots and lots of variety and fun surprises (if you play for years you very may still find great, new things  Cons: -No straightforward ""goal"" -Not a game you can binge-play -Requires a lot of patience  I'd buy it again.

Cons:   You cannot edit your town's geographical layout or settings. This is done via RNG. There are some things restricted due to time and date. For example, you cannot catch a tarantula in the Winter, but you can catch a dung beetle. Vice versa. There are also certain events that are restricted due to weather. For example, a colecanth can only be caught when it is raining between a certain set period of hours year round.

I guess the real question is, do you want something you can unwind with for an hour or two every night, and are you okay with not seeing a lot of substantially progress in the game world?"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cftvc,davidi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:10:03 2015 UTC,"This may seem obvious, but if you aren't into casual games you will not enjoy this. I picked this up when I got a 3ds and I have never gotten less value out of a game. I didn't get enough time in the game to give a detailed pros/cons list, but if you are a fighter/moba player like myself then don't be surprised if you find it unable to grab your attention."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3chtha,Zeroboy27,2,Wed Jul 8 00:45:31 2015 UTC,"The Forest - Amazing survival game that has dozens of hours of playtime. Legitimately the only non-horror game that stressed me the fuck out.  Viking: Battle for Asgard: 30 FPS cap and always-on motion blur. If that's an immediate turn off like it was for me, don't get it.  Metro 2033 A great FPS with a strong story and amazing atmosphere. I recommend playing on Ranger Hardcore, as on that difficulty 1 bullet is 1 kill, for you and for them. It really embraces the resource management aspect of the game.  Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning Another strong RPG with a very in-depth combat and progression system. However, the storylines (main and side) are very linear, and once you complete it all there isn't much incentive to return to the game.  Bulletstorm An absurd FPS with an emphasis on being absurd. Do not play this game if extremely bloody kills mixed with massive amounts of innuendo aren't your thing.  Risen A game with a lot of missed potential. If it were made a few years later, and given a few months more development time, it would stand out as a great RPG. That being said, it falls into the pitfalls of many par/sub-par RPGs of being filled with pointless bullshit quests that are only meant to pad gametime."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3chtha,UnholyTeemo,2,Wed Jul 8 07:36:10 2015 UTC,I would recommend checking out /r/steamgameswap at least some of those games regularly go on sale much cheaper often. You could find some good deals there and get a few of them.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3chtha,CMvan46,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:18:53 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for crude humour and surprisingly unique mechanics for a FPS, I definitely recommend Bulletstorm. Loved that game.  If you're in the mood for something underrated, go with Condemned. It's a horror game that I think doesn't get the attention it deserves.  If you just want a classic game, then Final Fantasy VII is that option."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3chtha,verify_deez_nuts,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:32:28 2015 UTC,"I was thinking if you want to get a great game with a fantastic story and plenty to do, look into the Mass Effect Trilogy. The game at the moment, on Origin, is slightly more than your budget but this game is definitely worth it.  Everything about it is awesome, fun game, with a nice game mechanics and lastly, a fantastic and overall, great story!  As for the games that you listed, I would say go for The Witcher or Bully. In terms of content, and plenty to do, they both have a lot of things to do here and there. From side quest to main objectives. If you are after just some rowdy fun and action, go with Bulletstorm or Metro 2033.  Hope this helped!"
ShouldIbuythisgame,3chtha,okaythenmate,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:03:58 2015 UTC,"I can comment on the ones I've played:   Bully: Enhanced Edition - Great game. Its a rockstar sandbox game, but in a school instead of a city. So no guns or horrible violence, but lots of fist fighting and slingshots and stuff like that. It's good if you like that high school setting but in a game. That said, it's pretty old so I'm sure you can get it at a much better price if you wait for a sale. Metro 2033 - Another amazing game. This one has a spooky atmosphere and a very rich, dark, post-apocalyptic world. It's based on a novel of the same name. The stealth is a little clunky, and the shooting is okay, but what really makes the game is the atmosphere. Depressing and hopeless in that Eastern-European kind of way. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning - This one wasn't for me. It's a high fantasy RPG. Its apparently quite lengthy but rather generic and didn't hold my attention. It might be worth checking out though if you really like fantasy. The Witcher Enhanced Edition - Really good game. The strongest part is the story. The combat mechanics are poor, but you get used to them eventually. The fantasy world is rich with lore and colourful characters. Again I emphasize the strong storytelling of this game. If your looking for good story and a rich world, this game has it."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3chtha,frayuk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:58:50 2015 UTC,"IMO of all the games you listed, Metro 2033 is the best. The Redux version has graphics that blow out most of recent shooters while the gameplay is still rock solid (shooting is a little sluggish at first but you get it real fast)."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cg0xd,phoofboy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:29:05 2015 UTC,The first game is a little bit of a slow burner starting out but it ramps up towards the middle of the game and blossums into an amazing story throughout the end of the first through the end of the third game.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cg0xd,pulp_hero,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:20:12 2015 UTC,"I was a little underwhelmed by Spec Ops: The Line.  I feel like initially people were really impressed because it blew past their low expectations.  I came to it later specifically because people had heaped so much praise on the story, so I had really high expectations for it that it honestly fell a little short of.    It's still totally worth playing, but go into it with reasonable expectations."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cg0xd,SecondTalon,3,Tue Jul 7 20:43:07 2015 UTC,If all you want is a great story I suggest Thomas Was Alone.
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cg0xd,SecondTalon,4,Tue Jul 7 22:43:30 2015 UTC,"What sort of stories draw you in?  System Shock 2 and Planescape:Torment both have good stories, but one is about an omnicidal maniac AI, an omnicidal maniac hive mind and you in a three way fight, the other is about an immortal amnesiac coming to terms with everything he's done in his existence.  However, SS2 is a RPG/FPS horror game, and PS:T is an isometric Bioware RPG with a metric fuckton of reading.  There's a little over a million words in the thing, and you'll be doing good if you see over half of them.  Vampire The Masquerade:Bloodlines has a neat story, but you really play that game for the world and setting more than you do the actual story being told.  On the other hand, you've got stuff like Braid which is fairly minimalist in it's story, yet still has an interesting multiple interpretations effect going on - it's about what literally happens, about alcoholism ruining a relationship, about nuclear weapons, and so on.  Then there's something like To The Moon which is more like an interactive storybook than anything else - there's more dialog reading and clicking ""next"" than there is actual gameplay, there aren't too many choices and you pretty much follow a linear A>B>C path, but the story it tells is pretty good, as far as video game stories go.  So if you could be more specific about what you're wanting (examples - A ""good"" hero saving the world but not being completely awful in it's story (Baldur's Gate series) / a morally ambiguous protagonist in a world of crap (Witcher) / an arthouse funfest where you'll find yourself on a messageboard arguing with people over what exactly it was all about (Home) ) then we can aim you at something more specific."

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cg0xd,ezio45,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:38:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I never played 7 beyond the first disc, so I'm not entirely certain how it plays out.  Baldur's Gate starts small with the ""Figure out who killed your stepdad"" generic quest #19854 and goes cosmic scale, so if that's your cup of tea, go for it.  Some of the NPCs are pretty neat.  Never did play much of II for various reasons, but I understand it's better.  I have no idea how Bioshock Infinite compares to System Shock, but I know the Bioshock line descends from System Shock.  If you're fine with not-so-fantastic graphics, evil psychic monkeys and the possibility of leveling up wrong and not really being able to proceed in the game, I'd say give System Shock 2 a go.  If you want to revisit the early days of the FPS when control schemes weren't universal, System Shock 1 is pretty good."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cg0xd,afiresword,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:11:55 2015 UTC,"If you did really like Bioshock, System Shock 2 is considered to be the inspiration and framework for the whole Bioshock series. Some of the game developers are the same between the two game as well, I believe."

The Wolf Among Us is also great, and their Borderlands game looks really good even though there are only three episodes so far.  To the Moon tells a fantastic story. Its the first time I've ever played a game over twice in a row.  Bastion and Transistor have great story telling, great music, great art and decent game play.  Limbo is short and simple, and most of all subtle, but leaves you thinking.  Mass Effect is really good, plus your save transfers across games which is cool. Dishonored and Spec Ops the Line. LA Noire tells a good detective story. Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is great. Amnesia: Dark Descent is scary as shit but tells an interesting story. I never did get to the end though."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cg0xd,Rbeattie98,2,Wed Jul 8 05:10:02 2015 UTC,"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a great game, with a great story. The gameplay isn't the best, but it's certainly not bad. It aged pretty well. You might experience a crash at a certain point, if you do, mess around with the graphic options. There's also KoToR 2, but I found it a bit lacking story wise. Still, worth a playthrough if you want more closure.  Morrowind or, well, most Bethesda games like Fallouts 1, 2, 3, NV. Granted, the Fallout games are more about several stories forming a world. Morrowind has an amazing journey of a story by the main quest itself, then there's even more spread around the world.  Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a turn based, cyberpunk, isometric RPG. Great game, great story with depth to characters.  Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines has a good story if you don't mind a lot of back and forth. It hasn't aged too well tho.  The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a good JRPG, the story is good, but the game is slow, as is the case for most JRPGs.  Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Human Revolution have great stories too. DE is in the middle gameplay wise compared with more recent games, it takes some getting used to. But the story is magnificent. DE:HR is way better in gameplay, not as great as DE in story. Still pretty good tho."

Great humour; referential mexicanizes internet memes, witty dialogue. Great gameplay; cool combomoves, special attacks and somewhat challenging puzzle elements.  Decent Coop that will make the puzzles less challenging and the fights easier, but still lots of fun.  Only downside I can think of right now is that it is kind of short and a quick playthrough.

It's more for fans of the Persona series, but you can definitely play it without having played them before. Worst case just go to the wiki's and skim over the story if you want.  Other than that my recommendation would be the AA trilogy. Fantastic games, and at the current $22 price, it's a steal. Its worth it full price. Its a visual novel style gameplay with mystery and logic based puzzles. It's not too hard and IMO one of the best games out there. It was also the first time in a while (played through them recently myself) that I've been fully engrossed in a story and found it challenging and not just frustrating.

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cfxz2,DubSackDave,2,Tue Jul 7 16:39:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the xbox version as I own the PC version. IMO, the game at the current state is how it should have been on release, it's a pity that they took so long to polish it. With that said, yes. I'd definitely recommend getting it now as it is ridiculously cheap with premium(I know, but it's worth it for all the extra content. There's even a few community chosen map being developed atm!)"

ShouldIbuythisgame,3cfxz2,slamminsalmon24,-6,Tue Jul 7 22:41:34 2015 UTC,No. The community is pretty dead
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cfxz2,stealer0517,3,Tue Jul 7 17:46:09 2015 UTC,What exactly is dead about this?  http://bf4stats.com/
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cfxz2,CMvan46,-2,Wed Jul 8 00:07:00 2015 UTC,its pretty hard to find a good server that isn't absolute ass rape and doesn't have 10 people qued for it
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cfxz2,stealer0517,3,Wed Jul 8 00:45:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's highly incorrect but alright."
ShouldIbuythisgame,3cfxz2,CMvan46,-1,Wed Jul 8 01:19:50 2015 UTC,where the hell do you live? because I'm right in the middle of the us and most servers are either full or complete rape
