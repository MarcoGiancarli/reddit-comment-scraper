Yogscast,3e3en5,thalandor46,3,Tue Jul 21 18:10:50 2015 UTC,"For going after the enchant upgrades, Bibliocraft offers a way to get multiples of a specific enchanted book. You'll need a Typesetting Table and a Printing Press, as well as one copy of the book you want to clone. You'll also need to wear a set of Reading Glasses (or equivalent)to be able to see certain UI elements of those blocks. It'll certainly give you a use for your stockpile of ink, as ink is a vital ingredient in cloning books.  By default, the process described in the Typesetting Table or Printing Press articles can make three copies of an enchanted book. However, that number can be changed in the server configs. The original book you're copying is destroyed in the process, giving you a net gain of two enchanted books normally. It's not uncommon for players familiar with bibliocraft to keep a bookshelf (or a TE Strongbox if security is an issue) filled with enchanted books as a backup.    Considering the size of the quarry, it may have been more effective to dig down a couple of blocks and set up the quarry just below the surface around level 60 (considering the water level is 63). That way you could harvest all the materials without leaving the massive hole on the surface. More importantly, it would have preserved the dirt layers - filling in two layers of a 64x64 hole will take 128 stacks of dirt - a bit over 8k blocks. Granted you'll get that amount back from the quarry, but this series doesn't have a Builder's Wand yet - nor do I think it has a division sigil.    ""Take non-matching"" can be considered an empty blacklist if the wording is confusing - nothing is forbidden.    When it comes to discarding items, particularly in bulk, the Trashcan is an effective and very cheap alternative to a void chest, and isn't a fire hazard like lava. All items that go into its inventory are instantly deleted, and it works with pipes. In comparison, the void chest deletes at a rate of one per second and so are capable of overflowing."

I don't know why, but when series reach a point like this you stop seeing a show about making progress and reaching the goal in minecraft, and you start to see a show about 3 old friends hanging out while they play a game. Its the bin chute episode of tekkit, the potato resteraunt episode of hole diggers, it's the ""what the fuck are we doing!?"" moment that comes in every series and results in tears of laughter, Only Blast Off is a whole series of that moment.

Yogscast,3dyvmn,TheHatRemover,25,Mon Jul 20 20:56:07 2015 UTC,I love Sjin but found this video quite bad
Yogscast,3dyvmn,JamieAubrey,19,Mon Jul 20 21:09:51 2015 UTC,Is....is that what Sjin think black Americans sound like? Haha
Yogscast,3dyvmn,yeeerrrp,10,Mon Jul 20 18:08:46 2015 UTC,"Sjin, Franklin is not an NPC, NPC means non playable character, and you are clearly playing him at the moment you say he is non playable."
Yogscast,3dyvmn,Northern-Pyro,9,Mon Jul 20 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"Franklin as a black australian redneck, im losing my sides here"
Yogscast,3dyvmn,Aldotomberry,9,Mon Jul 20 22:52:16 2015 UTC,I thought the voice was hilarious
Yogscast,3dyvmn,snailer88,11,Tue Jul 21 01:43:08 2015 UTC,"Why aren't people offended over the Australian accent at the start of the episode? It was no different to the Franklin voice, just because it was a ""Black guy voice"" it was racist."
Yogscast,3dyvmn,TJDouglas13,0,Mon Jul 20 21:27:32 2015 UTC,The difference is that his Franklin accent it's not far off from the accent white Americans used in the past as a comedic stereotype of black people where white people would dress up in black face and make fun of black people.
Yogscast,3dyvmn,tjwibblywobbly,0,Tue Jul 21 14:57:57 2015 UTC,I think the concept of context and intention might be lost on most of you.
Yogscast,3dyvmn,Shorgan14,-13,Tue Jul 21 15:05:52 2015 UTC,"As an Australian, I can tell you that we are not an oppressed people. Australians are mostly white and thus do not experience racism. There is a difference between Sjin parodying Australians and Sjin parodying black people. That is why people are reacting differently. Hope this helps with some perspective :)"
Yogscast,3dyvmn,ashphthalo,14,Mon Jul 20 23:37:01 2015 UTC,"So let's just put aside a second the fact that Australians are not a homogenous mass and some will of course experience racism, how is doing an accent racist? The Irish are historically an oppressed people, would an Irish accent be offensive for the same reason? Can you give a list of accents we can and can't do please?"
Yogscast,3dyvmn,Shorgan14,4,Tue Jul 21 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"The impersonation of African Americans is a really touchy subject; it's been used in a mocking way, for hundreds of years. If Sjin was trying to impersonate Franklin, he was doing a really terrible job; I really don't think he was. If he was trying to impersonate an African American, well... that's a whole other level of depth, and he did that poorly. He did it in a way that subscribes to a lot of stereotypes that may or may not be accurate. I totally understand impersonating another country's accent, as long as you're not being a jerk about it, but impersonating a historically oppressed minority can be pretty hard to respect."
Yogscast,3dyvmn,thatismyorange,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:57:52 2015 UTC,"So I ask again, would an Irish accent be offensive? A Polish accent? A Scottish accent? All historically oppressed people."
Yogscast,3dyvmn,Shorgan14,3,Tue Jul 21 09:19:02 2015 UTC,"Are they actively undergoing discrimination as a group right now? I think that would be debatable for a Pole, a Scot, or an Irishman; maybe so, maybe not. Not so much for African Americans. Consider also that I know a lot of black people, and generally it's not considered kind to imitate them to begin with. Regardless of all of this, we shouldn't imitate accents of people that don't want to be imitated, because it's mean."
Yogscast,3dyvmn,thatismyorange,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:21:48 2015 UTC,"You know a lot of black people, and so now feel you have the authority to decide what is and isn't offensive to black people? It is incredibly patronising to black peoples for you to attempt to censor the world for them, as if they do not have autonomy of their own."
Yogscast,3dyvmn,Shorgan14,2,Tue Jul 21 09:27:34 2015 UTC,oh man you got me I sure am racist for trying to consider the viewpoints of the black people that have expressed their views to me
Yogscast,3dyvmn,thatismyorange,0,Tue Jul 21 09:31:08 2015 UTC,"I never said racist, I said patronising   Oh by the way, that means 'to talk down to'"

Yogscast,3dyvmn,thatismyorange,9,Tue Jul 21 09:52:50 2015 UTC,Are you suggesting white people cannot experience racism ?
Yogscast,3dyvmn,Tomb2707,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:33 2015 UTC,"Textbook definitions of racism specify that it involves discrimination against an oppressed people. That's in academic theory; most people won't subscribe to that in the every day, but considering how much discrimination white people actually encounter, I'd say it's a good theory to subscribe to."

Edit: Now I will admit, that voice did not suit Franklin at all, but it had me laughing the entire episode, so that's a win to me."
Yogscast,3dyvmn,TheRealGuy01,3,Mon Jul 20 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with pointing out something you find troubling. If Sjin did mess up (and while I wish he hadn't terribly impersonated an AAVE speaker), he should be confronted with it. That said: video was funny."
Yogscast,3dyvmn,thatismyorange,4,Tue Jul 21 08:52:23 2015 UTC,The Franklin voice/character kinda made this unwatchable for me :/

Yogscast,3dyvmn,tonybateman,6,Mon Jul 20 18:55:33 2015 UTC,It seems like people only see it as racism when it's certain accents being imitated. It also seems like people are way too quick to call things racist these days.
Yogscast,3dyvmn,Brownwing,7,Mon Jul 20 20:52:01 2015 UTC,"Seriously? You must be looking for it to see it in this. That voice is just a generic redneck/south American voice with motherfucker thrown in.  It's just Sjin being unable to do any serious accent, he managed to go scouse earlier in the video, only to then make him a cockney later on."
Yogscast,3dyvmn,TigerHall,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:23 2015 UTC,"I think it was intended as the generic 'black American gangster' accent, and it worked didn't it? Everyone seems to know what it is."

Yogscast,3dvq37,kogasapls,6,Mon Jul 20 04:55:35 2015 UTC,"I didn't say he was a household name. But he's an easy figure to accept because he does mainstream things. He's a comedian you've never heard of. He does things comedians do. Plenty of other people have heard of him. He fits in nicely. They don't typically bring on relatively unknown non-comedians. The non-comedians are usually well known. Introducing someone who doesn't fit the schema and nobody else knows would not be good for ratings. This is mostly because the ""watches-QI-on-cable"" crowd is very different from the Yogscast crowd."
Yogscast,3dvq37,magmafrost,2,Mon Jul 20 05:33:49 2015 UTC,"the ""watches-QI-on-cable"" crowd wouldn't really have any reason to believe that Lewis wasn't just another comedian that they haven't heard of, unless they do a little research, which is fairly unlikely."

Yogscast,3dula1,tbeowulf,0,Mon Jul 20 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"Well, they shouldn't.  Nike is the Greek goddess of Victory and, what with not being an English lass, her name does not follow the usual English pronunciation rules of not sounding the final ""e"".  So it ought to be ""n-eye-key"" regardless of whether you're British or American.  (The essential problem is that Nike never actually say their name in their UK advertising - in order to be ""cool"" (and probably also to just make the ad usable across all of Europe because all of the different languages), they just show the logo without any narration at all - and people just read it as if it's an English word because, unless they know Greek mythology, why would they realise it's the name of a Greek goddess and how to say it?)."
Yogscast,3dula1,KlaxonCow,2,Mon Jul 20 03:28:10 2015 UTC,"If we're being pedantic about how to pronounce untranslated words from other languages, I thought the last ""e"" of Nike in greek was the greek ""n"" (with the right bit being longer) and is pronounced ""eh""? Don't have greek letters on mobile but isn't it like  v'ikn nikehhh  So pronounced neekehhh?  So then pronouncing it ""neyekey"" doesn't make any sense either.  EDIT: I googled it and Nike says it should indeed be pronounced n-eye-key.   Then again the anglicized versions of most Latin/Greek names are just FUBAR, and often just alter the entire word."

Yogscast,3dula1,Gnarlstone,16,Sun Jul 19 22:06:08 2015 UTC,"A couple of potentially useful tips for the map admins in regards that prison: If the pack has OpenPeripherals, the PIM (Player Inventory Manipulator) can be used to remove selective items from a player. When a player is stood on the PIM, that player's inventory can be accessed through the bottom face of the block. With that in place, it's just a matter of putting an AE2 storage bus on the bottom of the PIM, connect it to a Terminal and some power, and you get absolute control over the inventory of the prisoner. No more toggling keepInventory necessary to recover tubas.  To prevent the player from breaking the PIM and escaping, a 0-tick clock with a short range mining fatigue effect would be sufficient. Taking the jail coordinates from the first episode, the command block would need ""effect @a[681,74,611,2] 4 1 128"". That gives 1 second of Mining Fatigue level 128 to everyone within a radius of 2 blocks around the centre of the prison. By upping the radius to about 4-8, you could in theory have a glass prison instead of bedrock as no players outside of creative should be able to break it.  Unfortunately to avoid the ""chat"" spam all the ops would see from that going off, you'd need ""*gamerule commandBlockOutput false"""
Yogscast,3dula1,PolyGanon,24,Mon Jul 20 08:05:28 2015 UTC,Pretty sure this is the series they filmed in two days so your tips aren't of much use for this particular series. But maybe for future ones.

Yogscast,3dula1,PolyGanon,12,Sun Jul 19 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"No it was mentioned by several of them (Hat Film's latest vlog, for one, mentioned by sips on stream, etc) that they were all taking part in a main channel series that was filmed all in one long block where they cleared their schedules, so that it wasn't stretched out for several months of filming one series in spurts and dragging on too long (hence why Sips, who is completely burned out on Minecraft, is involved)."
Yogscast,3dula1,fluffbox,2,Sun Jul 19 18:55:50 2015 UTC,Yeah but what about this then.
Yogscast,3dula1,cannotfoolowls,5,Sun Jul 19 19:44:25 2015 UTC,"That has no indication that it's the only time they'll be doing recording for it. Two days of recording would give them a healthy buffer of content so they can gauge viewer interest over the first couple of episodes. That way they don't need to invest more into that series in case it proves a flop. Towards the end of that buffer, they can then film more episodes.  The video link of the Hats vlog is also no indication of the series being limited to those two days of recordings. Some may misconstrue the second mention of ""two days"" as being the limit of the series time, where they're referring to the remaining days that week for other projects like Stunt Lads- Filming Derpulies on the Tuesday and Wednesday (14th and 15), and Thursday and Friday are the remaining workdays.  And lastly the most obvious thing... how much modded minecraft can you actually do in two days? Even with a relatively small modpack such as the original Tekkit series, two days is not enough to get much video-worthy progress done at all. Surely the end goal of the series isn't so lacklustre as to simply fill a double chest with wheat."
Yogscast,3dula1,PolyGanon,4,Sun Jul 19 19:06:32 2015 UTC,"I can only say the stuff I heard from Sips' stream, twitter ad pre-stream chat: they did record things on a Tuesday and a Thursday, so it was a two day recording. It seemed like they wanted to get this done within that time, one of the reasons he shared the info about recording is because his streaming was affected and as of now there are no news of anything like this happening again. You are saying that this might not be the ONLY time they record - keep in mind the amount of people involved and that this is a ""quest""-series of sorts (Minecraft modded challenge to be precise). Stuff like that really restricts recordings, so I guess they have tailored it and then ""powered through it"" (the Yogscast way). I'm pretty sure much more of footage is there for further episodes, but my guess is that they are finished with recording."
Yogscast,3dula1,noob_senpai,8,Sun Jul 19 19:53:31 2015 UTC,"That could be useful in the future, but this entire series is prerecorded."

Yogscast,3dula1,Br1ckFuckingMaster,15,Sun Jul 19 17:45:01 2015 UTC,"Clearly something about these videos is genuinely bugging people. I don't think it's as much the number of perspectives but the large number of cuts from one team's viewpoint to another's; I counted 30 switches between teams. For an 18-minute video that's quite a lot, on average we're going from one team to another every 36 seconds. It'd be easier to concentrate on what's happening if we had five minutes straight for every team or something similar.  Here are the viewpoints in order of appearance if anyone's intersted:  Team Hat, 2girls1flux, Sjipos, 2girls1flux, Sjipos, Team Hat, Sjipos, Team Hat, Sjipos, Team Hat, Sjipos, Team Hat, 2girls1flux, Team Hat, Sjipos, Team Hat, Sjipos, Team Hat, 2girls1flux, Team Hat, Sjipos, Team Hat, 2girls1flux, Team Hat, Sjipos, Team Hat, 2girls1flux, Sjipos, 2girls1flux, Team Hat"
Yogscast,3dula1,MoonlightSandwich,10,Sun Jul 19 20:53:11 2015 UTC,That's fine I think. It's like a movie or a TV show. There are going to be cuts to other B and C storylines on a TV show. I don't think it needs to be 5 minutes straight. I like diversity (and the map #diversity3). It held my attention better. I sometimes drift when it's just long stretches of content. Very much like a movie. Movies have quick cuts because movie goers don't want to see long stretches of dialog while the camera focuses on one person face (unless it's an oscar movie or something.)
Yogscast,3dula1,MoleMcHenry,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:37:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know what sort of movies you see but I've not seen a single one that consistently goes from one storyline or location to another in one minute or less. I don't watch TV anymore so I can't comment on any modern TV shows but I'd wager that Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, or Doctor Who don't consistently switch between different sets of characters or locations once or twice a minute (on average).  I'm not talking about cuts in general but cuts between different teams. When the characters of a movie are engaged in dialogue they're very likely doing something or at least something's happening around them and the camera will take advantage of that. The speakers remain the same during the scene, we generally don't jump from a dialogue between A and B to one between C and D with a very short notice. Maybe A and B are driving a car and at the end of their dialogue they laugh and the viewpoint changes to one outside the car to show how they speed off into the distance, and then we go to another dialogue in another place. Very rarely do we quickly jump between places without any kind of cue for the viewer.   I rarely have problems with long scenes in Yogscast videos but I understand that some people have. However, the way I see it they're taking this to the extreme by trying to cram as much usable content into one episode as possible and trying to show everything in chronological order. For me watching the video wasn't enjoyable, the amount of concentration needed to watch the video actually drained energy from me overall. In the end I was exhausted and left wondering wtf did I just watch, what did the teams achieve, what are their goals again, why are they doing this, why are they building their bases in these places, where are they located in relation to each other, why is that scoreboard there?   Now that I think of it it felt like a ""previously in Derpcraft"" thing that was shown in the beginning of some TV series to clue new viewers in, just that it was almost 20 minutes long. Technically I know what happened, but I'm oblivious to the actual reasons."
Yogscast,3dula1,MoonlightSandwich,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:58:42 2015 UTC,quick question: have you seen Inception? were you able to follow it? (genuinely interested)
Yogscast,3dula1,Lynchpin_Cube,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:42:09 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking of Inception as a good way of using quick cuts when writing the post but decided to leave it out (enough of a wall of text). Watching Inception did take a lot of concentration (especially towards the end) but it only really uses quick cuts (from one set of characters to another) during action sequences and when things start getting more hectic (when Arthur is on the hotel level and the rest of the crew go down to the snowy level) and when they start getting out. Most of the film is paced ""normally"" and doesn't jump between different levels every half a minute. The quick cuts are also pretty exclusively in action sequences where they add additinal tension. The locations are introduced slowly during normal scenes so that the viewers don't need to completely re-orientate themselves when the film moves back into them quickly. There also isn't important dialogue during these fast and short scenes so there's no additional information to take in, the viewer knows what's happening and why.  It's a great film and really one of a kind. Not the sort of film I'd watch every week though; when the credits started rolling my heart was still beating fast.  If Inception (or any other 2-hour film) jumped from one dialogue between a set of characters in one location to another dialogue between other characters in another place as fast as Trials of Derpulies ep 2 there would be about 200 jumps in the whole film.  A better comparison would be watching three short comedy films with different casts at the same time in short 30-second clips. Following three different films at the same time can get tiring really fast. It can also be annoying if you don't like some of the characters (not true in my case, I like everyone in Derpulies but I understand if someone doesn't)."
Yogscast,3dula1,MoonlightSandwich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:35:59 2015 UTC,In the end it's like this: You're going to have people complain that there needs to be videos on the individual channels. You're going to have people complain there needs to be a compiled video. You're going to have people complain that Sips and Sjin are trolling too much. You're going to have people complain they're not trolling enough. People are always going to complain about something with these videos. The Yogscast just isn't going to be able to satisfy everyone. So they often set out to find a healthy balance (like Tom coming in that one time telling Sjin to stop trolling).
Yogscast,3dula1,MoleMcHenry,2,Tue Jul 21 09:18:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, The changes happen way too often."
Yogscast,3dula1,Fanglove,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:34 2015 UTC,I watch this stuff in the background and all these viewpoints swaps are making it almost impossible for me to follow.   I agree that it is dumb to keep commenting it because it's obviously not going to change. However the reason they did this is because of people wanting this in cornerstone.   People are giving feedback so that they might do something different next time. (Maybe one big collage on the main channel and individual teams on the respective channels)   Whatever they decide I don't think people will ever not have something to complain about. Got to get their free content specifically formatted for them.

Yogscast,3dula1,MoleMcHenry,38,Sun Jul 19 21:14:33 2015 UTC,"This was a comment in the first episode too, but for cornerstone the problem was that there were 4 viewpoints and it really hurt the views because people couldn't be bothered to watch all four viewpoints."
Yogscast,3dula1,cannotfoolowls,2,Mon Jul 20 07:59:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I don't know about anyone else but I wouldn't mind watching it over three series.  Plus if is split over the main channel, Hat Films and Duncan's channel, then it'd appeal to fans of all three of those channels."
Yogscast,3dula1,damage3245,30,Sun Jul 19 18:50:16 2015 UTC,"I would mind.

Yogscast,3durvg,TheLoneEnderman,24,Sun Jul 19 17:58:01 2015 UTC,"Some people like multiple perspectives, some like it all in one. We all have our own opinions on what is better or worse, but that doesn't mean that one side is actually worse ... If you know what I mean.  I don't think the Yogs can change the style it's put out now anyways, and you also have to remember that if there was separate viewpoints going out on every member's channel, would they be able to fit it in their uploading schedules? Some people already have multiple series on their channels, amongst other games etc. The main channel however, has been lacking a proper series for a long time even before Simon fell ill. The main channel needed this, imo and with each teams viewpoints put into the one video on the one channel, it should (in theory) bring in more views.  Now sure, the downside is that some people don't like having to watch a certain team, which is why they prefer split viewpoints, however as you said that often means we miss out on a lot of things that are under other peoples viewpoints that may be ''neccesary'' to see to understand something, but some people might not like having to watch through an entire extra video of footage just to see what it is they missed.  Which is why, yes, I personally prefer having it all mixed together in one video. Again, personally, I'm not that much of a fan of Hatfilms content but I will still watch them and enjoy their banter if they are featured in some else's videos (like they are in Derpulies).  That's just my take on this. :)  TLDR: Whichever way it's done, some will like it and some will hate it. Just be happy they are making the effort for such a big series and watch what you can."
Yogscast,3durvg,TheRealGuy01,16,Sun Jul 19 19:17:15 2015 UTC,"I have to admit I like it better this way.   A lot of the complaints I've seen were specifically about not seeing enough Hat Films but, and I'm saying this as someone who enjoys their content, there are loads of other videos of theirs that I can watch if I want to enjoy their banter unrestricted.   Having one series where it's a bit different is fine for me :)"
Yogscast,3durvg,noodelese,-4,Sun Jul 19 18:24:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think that it actually detracts from the video, and it could benefit so much more from us being able to see it. I know there's plenty more HAT Films, however they don't work with this style of editing well, so we probably won't see a lot of them, as dropping in, in the middle of them doing something like Wine or Cheese wouldn't work. And, who'd complain about being able to see even more of their favourite content creators?"
Yogscast,3durvg,noodelese,7,Sun Jul 19 18:28:35 2015 UTC,I think I just like the variety of seeing them in a different setting :)
Yogscast,3durvg,Spivsy,22,Sun Jul 19 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"I prefer the one video approach, because for me it was too much content. I just didn't have the time to watch 4 half hour long videos in cornerstone, but felt like I was missing more content when the content is actually available to be watched, as opposed to missing content that just isn't available. If that makes any sense. When it hasn't been put on to a video and I can't watch it it's like, oh well it just doesn't exist. But when I CAN go and see it somewhere I think ""oh great, another 3 hours of videos to watch, let me just clear my schedule"""
Yogscast,3durvg,lupinesence,-3,Sun Jul 19 18:12:05 2015 UTC,"Them thing is, you don't have to do it on one day. Most people will have the time for a few videos per day. Cornerstone was only released on a Friday and Sunday, so there was time over the week to watch the other perspectives. Also, I think it better for there to be an abundance of content, rather than a lack, as you can always go back and watch it later, whereas with a lack of content, you finish it, and then you're just waiting for the next bit."
Yogscast,3durvg,TheBearPanda,8,Sun Jul 19 18:17:40 2015 UTC,"Personally, I admit that after a few weeks of Cornerstone I was flagging and, despite planning to catch up, I ended up only watching one, maybe two groups a week.

Yogscast,3durvg,WolfySpice,3,Sun Jul 19 19:13:57 2015 UTC,"Cornerstone was recorded in 1h+ chunks and ended up as 2x20+ min. Derpules was probably recorded in one day over the course of a few hours. That's why it's edited this way, there's probably a ton of footage unusuable due to the fact that nothing of matter happens.  They could still upload the full lenght footage of each team if the demand is high enough."
Yogscast,3durvg,WolfySpice,7,Sun Jul 19 18:29:11 2015 UTC,"I think people are comparing Derpulies too much to Cornerstone, to be honest.  Cornerstone was a cooperative series, and it would’ve been fine as condensed videos, since nobody had a clear objective anyway. The editor(s) could’ve picked the most interesting bits from each recording and there would’ve been no overlap when people interacted. The only time when it was really interesting to watch multiple viewpoints of a single event is when two teams were involved in something, but weren’t on voice chat.  Trials of Derpulies is more of a competitive series. Think Race For The Wool or The Walls: everyone’s in the same place, at the same time, working towards a set objective and seeing who does it best/fastest. It’s worth seeing what every team is up to. There’s also little to no overlap.  In short: I think they’ve got it a bit backwards.  However there is still the problem that people have been pointing out: Content overload.  Cornerstone videos came out twice a week, 4 teams, and were about 25-30 minutes long. If you wanted to keep up, you had better be ready to spend a good 3-4 hours every week. Let’s say that for Derpulies, they would keep the same length of videos as they’re doing now and same recording schedule but release them on multiple channels: assuming it’ll come out every other day, that’s 3-4 times a week, 3 teams, 20 minutes long each. That’s an hour every time it is released and thus we’re back at spending 3-4 hours every week to keep up with a single series.  Doing both - releasing the full pov’s and the condensed version requires a lot more editing, and is not that good for the Yogscast themselves.  TL;DR – Neither way of releasing the videos is ideal. Personally, I’m also partial to multiple viewpoints, but I can see why it isn’t being done. I had more issue with it when I’d only seen the first episode because it was primarily focused on Sjipos, but I didn’t want to say anything yet because it was the first episode and I sort of assumed the screentime was going to even out in the upcoming episodes. Which I think turned out to be more or less the case."
Yogscast,3durvg,aaranprasher,9,Mon Jul 20 08:35:04 2015 UTC,"As someone who didn't watch Cornerstone for that very reason, I love this format. Had no time for Cornerstone, so effectively, what, quadruple the work maybe, resulted in no view (from me at least)."

Yogscast,3durvg,The_Reapeer,14,Mon Jul 20 09:51:23 2015 UTC,I'm starting uni in Septemeber. The though of having to watch 4 hours of footage just to see the highlights of what could be in a 30min video bothers me. This new edit style will suit me much much more. It's all about opinions and perspective. Little kids doing GCSEs will have time to watch all the perspectives. Adults don't. Simple.
Yogscast,3durvg,MahoganyBean,0,Sun Jul 19 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"Gonna have to disagree with you. I work a 28 hour week and I'm in uni for 16 hours a week. I still found the time to watch 3/4 videos (wasn't fussed about fluxbuddies). Not saying your opinion is wrong, but saying ""adults don't have time"" is not true."
Yogscast,3durvg,VeXedZenith,-6,Mon Jul 20 23:29:47 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though, there should at least be the option of seeing the footage for those who do have time, they don't have to stop doing these highlight style videos, but it really doesn't work well for me. The great thing with the individual perspectives being uploaded is that people get options to watch what they like, not be forced to sit through 19 minutes of drivel to see what they enjoy (not saying that anyone there is bad, I luckily enjoy them all (but not in this style)). People should at least have the option to see the individual team perspectives if they like."
Yogscast,3durvg,Netyr,6,Sun Jul 19 18:41:44 2015 UTC,"The only honest issue I see with Cornerstone and people not having time to watch it was that they made primarily 30 minute episodes in contrast to 20 minute episodes that most other Yog series tend to go for. Pretending Railbros got their videos out on time, that's four hours per weekend to catch all the viewpoints. With 20 minute episodes, it's 2:40 to catch all of them, or 2 hours if you skip Railbros (which I'd imagine a lot of people did).  If Cornerstone was revived with 2x20 minute episodes per week, I reckon it'd be a huge success."
Yogscast,3durvg,The-Magical-Moose,-4,Sun Jul 19 18:38:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't disagree with you there, that's essentially the point of this. I think fans of Cornerstone would want this series to be like a reset, to show the model can and does work. This is the usual 20 min videos, and so it'd be a good way to test this theory."
Yogscast,3durvg,SunniixLoo,3,Sun Jul 19 18:45:20 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I agree entirely.  I'd rather watch 20 slow minutes of the one team I like, than three ""best bits"" minutes of that team in between 17 minutes of the two teams I can't stand."

I'm guessing there won't be any changes in the way the series is being aired now (it was rushed out anyway, the editors probably don't have time to fix it even if they wanted to), but hopefully all this debate will be taken into consideration next time there's a large multi team series.   This time we'll just be happy for those of you who are enjoying the videos."
Yogscast,3durvg,Netyr,3,Sun Jul 19 19:00:00 2015 UTC,"I think that this is definitely the best solution, provided it isn't too taxing on the creators/editors to edit an extra set of videos.  I don't think that it would necessarily effect the traffic to the current participants in Derpulies as they are mostly quite well involved anyway. But, say if Zoey, Rythian, Panda and the rest of the smaller Yogscast channels were to take part in something like this, it would definitely be worth having a ""highlight"" video on the main channel, with links to everyone else's videos. So if someone thinks while watching ""Oh hey, that particular scenario/person was really interesting/funny"" then they might want to watch the entire video from that person's/team's perspective, and therefore help the smaller channels out."

Yogscast,3dqiee,KirinDave,5,Sat Jul 18 19:32:06 2015 UTC,"Yogs who haven't appeared on the main channel hardly, or at all, may have a valid reason. Valid meaning they were scheduled, or offered, to appear but for some reason they chose not to. That's perfectly fine and understandable. Also, we as viewers, shouldn't feel entitled to know the reasoning behind those private decisions or conversations. I 100% agree with you there.  I think where this issue becomes a problem is when other Yogs mention they want to be a part of the main channel, livestream, and other collaborations, but continue to be excluded. Strife is a perfect example. He has mentioned quite a few times of wanting to do more with the rest of the Yogs, but for whatever reason he is left out. Leaving the impression that the decision makers at the YogsCasts are deliberately keeping him from participating in these events. That is the impression these statements give, whatever truths, or non-truths, they may have to them.  Now, what you say can very well be true, but that doesn't explain someone like Strife who has in numerous occasions mentioned he would like to do something with the main channel and/or the livestream just to be ""told"" it wouldn't work out. The perception to the viewers is that someone like Strife, for whatever reason, is being left out. Whether or not that is true is besides the point.  I am just using Strife as one example. Not trying to point him out, and hopefully I won't get him into trouble. It does appear that certain ""Yogs"" have privileges (access to the main channel, livestream, and other events) that a few others do not. Why that may be is the question. IMHO, I know scheduling conflicts, time zones difference, logistics, and available projects make it very difficult to coordinate these things. I see your POV and respect it. I am just addressing the perception that is out there and the need to confront it.  TL;DR There is a perception that certain Yogs are being left out deliberately. Valid reasons why certain Yogs are not included do not need to be made public, but when certain Yogs make statements that they are wanting to be included but are left out then that should be addressed in some manner - officially."

Yogscast,3dqiee,iKaka,2,Sun Jul 19 11:28:01 2015 UTC,You should watch the Derpules video from a couple days ago. Really funny and fresh content.
Yogscast,3dqiee,timfromsweden,5,Sun Jul 19 10:43:02 2015 UTC,"This is probably an unpopular opinion and thus will be downvoted, but I don't think introducing all the other members is a good thing. With all due respect, I'm only subscribed to a few Yogscast channels. I'm not subbed to all the other channels simply because I don't feel like their videos entertain me. If a new series on the main channel includes 9 people, only four of which I'm actually subbed to, that kinda spoils the series for me and I don't feel like watching it.  Edit: like I said, I know this will be downvoted. But eventhough I don't care about internet points, I want to remind you in general that the downvote button is not for when you simply don't agree. Just because you have your opinion doesn't make a different opinion bad or wrong :)"
Yogscast,3dqiee,Platfoot,19,Sat Jul 18 22:35:15 2015 UTC,I gotta disagree with this one. If there hadn't been a main channel crossover with Sips and Sjin during the tekkit days of have never given them a chance  Likewise going even further back I'd have never heard of Yogs in general if they'd not collabed with Totalbiscuit on Magicka. Collabs are super useful to find new content and should be encouraged!
Yogscast,3dqiee,corobo,5,Sun Jul 19 01:28:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying colabs are bad! I think they are a good thing. But the main channel, even before Simon was gone, barely had any videos without anyone else."
Yogscast,3dqiee,Platfoot,4,Sun Jul 19 01:36:29 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth I upvoted you as you're on topic and contributing to discussion. Such is reddit.  I guess I see where you're coming from, though there was a huge block of time where they didn't collab with anyone aside from Duncan, Sips and Sjin content. I remember people were always on about it here ""give strife a chance"" and all that  At least with the GTA/Garry's Mod stuff it's way easier for them to do that, though it probably won't do anything for me as I'm not a fan of screeching YouTubers and those games has a side effect of portraying everyone as yelling a lot.  For people like me who aren't a fan of the constant yelling they/we probably won't check out other yogs through the screecher content. It'd be useful to see collabs with people on their home turf, the style of game their channel usually has.  Let's just say for an easy example Sjin was a brand new yog, you'd not want to collab him in with a horror game as its not representative of his content. The Sjin's farm stuff with Lewis would be absolutely ideal for showing off his channel though if you alternately posted videos on main chan and Sjin's chan  Jumping back to your point having thought about it - too many chefs can definitely be off-putting too, in fact there was that Minecraft series I still need to get round to watching (Cornerstone?). I've not got round to it yet as I noticed there were loads of yogs involved and I watch vids at night. Loads of yogs usually means someone's yelling their face off every few minutes, not really a bedtime story haha  Please forgive the waffling, went off on one there. Probably still under the effect of morphine, ruddy hip."
Yogscast,3dqiee,corobo,72,Sun Jul 19 07:32:35 2015 UTC,I think if he has decided to retire from youtube it wouldnt be so bad as to announce it now than it would have been when he first became ill. Dont get me wrong i think people would be upset but we've had plenty of time to get used to the Simonless yoggies.  Still.... I miss Simon!
Yogscast,3dqiee,talkingdonkeys,22,Sat Jul 18 14:33:41 2015 UTC,"If he isn't coming back, that would be his own decision and I'd be fine with it, but then they should announce it already. I miss him on the channel, and I think it's common curtesy to at least let us know if he decided to not return. Or at least to give an update. Full detail isn't even needed. Just an update."

That said, if he doesn't want to return to a full time position because of health/any other reason, I wouldn't exactly be angry because I'm not entitled to any content from him or anyone else in the Yogscast.   And yeah the main channel has done great over the last few months, but that's because they were responding to a challenge, which they've done really well. Their goal was to create great content even without Simon there, and they've been successful. So yeah this means they can create great content without Simon. We can all agree this is the case. Doesn't mean Simon isn't a hugely valuable and fantastic entertainer though whose contribution should be valued and appreciated (and has definitely been missed)."
Yogscast,3dqiee,sausageball,214,Sat Jul 18 15:42:48 2015 UTC,"For me it really hinges on whether his time off has given him new energy to be the old Simon I used to find absolutely hilarious. I find a lot of more recent Simon content too over the top. It almost seems like he's playing a caricature of himself to appeal to the part of the audience that loves his screaming mental breakdowns and such. If he is only going to continue being like that.. I'd prefer the main channel stay as is, with Lewis leading the content. I prefer Lewis as a host figure doing cross-channel content over Lewis and Simon together nowadays."
Yogscast,3dqiee,zeu5,68,Sat Jul 18 14:50:42 2015 UTC,"I think this time away has made me realize, lewis with simon isn't lewis. The lewis we see with simon is put into this stupid role restriction because of the fact that simons "" GOOGOOOOO"" personality has made the channel so large(Let's face it, on youtube the louder you scream the higher your sub count). With Simon gone we're finally seeing the real lewis, and we really only ever got that before when he did spinoffs without simon. At this point I'm almost kind of wishing for simon to do more-so geust apperances then fully comeback.  On top of that, what content do we really want simon/simon+lewis to do anymore? I mean adventure maps were feeling stale, the modpacks don't do well with simon because he doesn't bother to research and delve into them, and really on Gmod he's more of a guest appearance then a main host."

Simon shitted around with mods that lewis had worked hard to understand and then throw in some screams and watch the view count rise. While it was one of their better content pieces, the amount of sheer effort to put together both the sets and stories for each episode makes it impracticle to consider in the long term."
Yogscast,3dqiee,IceWindWolf,36,Sat Jul 18 16:19:34 2015 UTC,"They put more effort into it and it was higher quality. It has a running story, and an interesting one at that. I'm not sure why it taking more effort to create than GTA Funny Moments #23 means that it is impractical."
Yogscast,3dqiee,Beta_Ace_X,24,Sat Jul 18 16:31:34 2015 UTC,"Remember when they did that whole stargate speacil in yoglabs? Remember how pissed lewis got because the view count/ad revune simply didn't justify how much time/effort was put into it? Now imagine haveing to make 3-4 of those a week. GTA gets 4-5 eps, requires about 20 minutes of downloading and only requires basic jump cut editing, its way less time drain and atm GTA is very popular."
Yogscast,3dqiee,IceWindWolf,15,Sat Jul 18 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"That's fair , but honestly I don't watch the GTA vids because they're all very samey. If I wanted to watch a bunch of people fuck around I'd just do it with my friends. I'd rather watch more structured stuff on YouTube. I honestly don't know about view counts, but that's what I personally watch."
Yogscast,3dqiee,Beta_Ace_X,14,Sat Jul 18 17:24:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I think while alot of us redditors might prefer structured content, we need to remember that 99% of the yogsfans are kids who enjoy giggleing like maniacs as sjin rockets lewis for the 50th time. As such when looking at the channels future we need to keep them in mind, not just us. That said you're right, honestly yogsquest-yogslabs-SOI-Hole Diggers and such are some of their best content."
Yogscast,3dqiee,IceWindWolf,8,Sat Jul 18 17:33:05 2015 UTC,"I do really enjoy their structured content, but I also really enjoy on the spot stuff like GTA where the humor does come from improv and them doing stupid shit."

Yogscast,3dqiee,MouthlessMutters,24,Sat Jul 18 14:25:23 2015 UTC,I'm not really bothered if Simon comes back or decides to call it a day as long as they announce it in the right manner and don't beat around the bush about it.  When Jontron left Game Grumps a year or 2 ago it caused such a shit storm! It just came out of nowhere and the conspiracy theories and people just being nosy bastards turned the Grumps subreddit and comment section on Youtube into a bloody mess for months over Arin avoiding any mention of Jon. It just turned the whole thing toxic and I don't really want to see that happen with the Yogscast as well.
Yogscast,3dqiee,Dr_Kung,12,Sat Jul 18 19:07:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. Do it like when Ray left Roosterteeth. They prevented speculating and outrage by announcing his retirement in a timely manner and quoted reasons why things are the way they are. In a result there wasn't that much speculating and most people wished him the best of luck. Both parties are still on good terms and people were sad, but glad they were told the truth."
Yogscast,3dqiee,maileme,48,Sat Jul 18 21:14:01 2015 UTC,"On a purely selfish level, I want him to come back asap because I miss his wit and joyous nature.  On a realist level, I can certainly see how he might find making game videos primarily for children a bit unrewarding and he might aspire to do something else.    Above all I just want him to be healthy and happy.  We've got years worth of content to revisit and rediscover should Simon move on to other opportunities."
Yogscast,3dqiee,Gnarlstone,16,Sat Jul 18 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed, TTT and Murder from last year were spectacular. I think that three part series with Sips, Simon, Lewis and Hat Films was honestly my favourite mini series they've ever done."

Yogscast,3dqiee,spectrosoldier,19,Sun Jul 19 00:52:52 2015 UTC,"I think that they should just stop forcing themselves to be more PG as more kids watch their content, and should just go back to classic Yogs: rude, crude, and talking about things in the nude."
Yogscast,3dqiee,TheLoneEnderman,19,Sat Jul 18 18:29:40 2015 UTC,Have you watched the GTA videos? There's no way that's meant to be PG.

Yogscast,3dqiee,TheLoneEnderman,18,Sat Jul 18 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's really true. If you look back at their videos from for example 2012, Lewis literally doesn't swear at all and Simon doesn't all that much either. For example in this video Lewis kind of urges Simon to not even say fuck in their videos, which seems pretty trivial compared to the GTA videos now. They genuinely seem to be less bothered about being PG nowadays to me."
Yogscast,3dqiee,Scaeduria,2,Sat Jul 18 20:00:43 2015 UTC,Was there a hint of him being sick of making videos? I thought he became ill and was recovering.
Yogscast,3dqiee,Rykleos,2,Sun Jul 19 00:03:23 2015 UTC,He has apparently recovered and is enjoying some time off. At least that is what Lewis said in the last vlog they did.
Yogscast,3dqiee,Happy_Gaming,20,Sun Jul 19 03:37:07 2015 UTC,"The main channel is still good, just.. differently good.  The GTA stuff has been really funny.  Would it have been better with the dwarf?  Perhaps.  I'm unlikely to stop watching if Simon was officially retired, but I would rue the loss of the Lewis/Simon pair videos.  While Simon's antics sometimes wasted time (I skip over Pig Island segments), he added a level of chaos that felt genuine and less scripted.  I'd miss that."

Everytime Lewis or Turps answer to the ""when is Simon coming back"" question the answer is: ""Very soontm"". But this isn't the case. It has been months since the first ""very soon"".  Now, time isn't the problem, Simon should recover for as long as he likes and needs, no question.

It's not about privacy anymore, privacy is fine to have, but constantly saying that he's coming back when he isn't is starting to make the fans go crazy. I'm sure they're planning something, but they could also just be dragging it out for his undecided retirement. They need to do something formal. They need to tell us a real answer. It's not about Simons privacy, it's respecting the fans and giving formal statements like a company needs to do :/ the ""not knowing"" is killing me.  Edit: you guys are right.

Yogscast,3dqiee,SnowCone4673,24,Sat Jul 18 15:40:06 2015 UTC,"You also have to think that they, themselves, might not know when is Simon coming back. So they just say ""soontm"" to calm down people and because they don't know for sure when he's coming back."

Yogscast,3dqiee,KirinDave,11,Sat Jul 18 18:51:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's a legitimate question all he's asking is how do dividends work and the proper answer, as I understand it, is that simon has a 45% stake in the yogscast so he gets a 45% share of the dividends paid out quarterly to the shareholders (simon and lewis). Also I believe with a limited company in the UK you can't pay out of your revenue you can only pay out of your profits so he gets a 45% share of the profits."
Yogscast,3dqiee,rln23,2,Sat Jul 18 19:59:50 2015 UTC,"Personally, I have limited marketing and business knowledge and so I'm not sure how much business information corporations are required to release, but as my opinion I don't feel like the Yogscast are obligated to release that information and I feel like it's quite a personal thing to ask for.  If I called into a business's corporate office and expressed interest in buying a piece of the company or giving monetary support to the company- perhaps a large donation, then I feel like I could request the financial information about the company so that I could make an informed decision.  If I just walked in from the street and requested their financial information, I definitely don't feel like that's a legitimate request. I feel like it's the difference between being curious about the information and asking for it. It's okay to be curious but I feel like it kind of crosses a boundary to ask for their financial information if it doesn't directly pertain to you.  If the question is simply how do the dividends work then it doesn't have to be specifically directed at the Yogscast (I'm sure google has a variety of resources for learning about small business founding and dividends), but the question was more about how much Simon is directly taking away from the Yogscast channel currently and I don't feel like that information is relevant.  I feel like, as a consumer, if I were to be given any information about the Yogscast situation I would rather know if it's better to donate directly to a preferred content producer or to buy their merchandise. I'd like to know where my money goes if I buy a tee shirt (for example, if I buy a $60 and the Yogscast only gets $25 I might seek out other avenues of financial support, unless they prefer the Merchandise route because wearing it gets their content around and because selling a large amount of merchandise is something that a financial backer may look positively on) but even that doesn't have anything to do with the numbers of people's salaries.  I'm quite pleased with the transparency the Yogscast has shown in the past regarding certain finance-related decisions and I feel like it's a bit much to be wanting to know the percentage of someone's paystub."

(the definition of a dividend)  And I agree you don't necessarily need all that information as a consumer but you can still be a consumer and enter a contract with a business in which case that kind of information could be useful/important."
Yogscast,3dqiee,rln23,3,Sun Jul 19 02:48:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'm reading too much into this. The reply was that it was a legitimate question to ask, and I personally don't think it was.  On the broad side of the issue, I feel like a lot of ""fans"" feel like they're owed information about Yogscast member personal life, including health and finances. I can't conceive of a situation where someone would need to know if Simon is still getting revenue from the main channel. If someone's only motivation for watching the main channel is to give revenue to Simon then I feel like while their motivation is good their actions are misplaced. There are a lot of ways to support a content producer as a consumer (a couple of the Yogscast members have donation links on their twitches) that don't involve watching the main channel if the content isn't of interest to them. I mentioned in a different comment that following Simon on twitter is probably a good idea. It's something I do to show support for him and his content while he's not actively producing.  If having that specific information is truly important to an interaction with the Yogscast then I feel the person inquiring should message the appropriate person specifically rather than asking on a public forum."
Yogscast,3dqiee,cotyart,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:13:46 2015 UTC,I agree it's not legitimate to ask about someone's personal financials but all he really asked is whether simon is paid a share of the revenue of the main channel while he isn't working. The answer is yes he is probably still paid a share of the profits of the entire business as a shareholder.  I think a lot of fans feel that way because the medium of youtube makes it seem like there's a much more intimate relationship between the viewer and creator than other mediums. All these companies and youtubers profit from that relationship. As part of the risk you have to deal with the effects of that false relationship. The yogscast are aware of that and do a fine job of treading that line.
Yogscast,3dqiee,rln23,25,Sun Jul 19 03:29:35 2015 UTC,"They owe us nothing in that sense. Since when did we obtain the divine right to demand information for them? Think bigger than your sub box, these are real people with real reasons for doing what they're doing. In time I have no doubt something will come to light but ultimately he nor anyyog owes you nor I nor anyone an excuse or an apology or an answer"
Yogscast,3dqiee,ARMThomson,13,Sat Jul 18 17:18:41 2015 UTC,"This bothers me too. It's not about privacy anymore, privacy is fine to have, but constantly saying that he's coming back when he isn't is starting to make the fans go crazy.   I mean... maybe... ""the fans"" could decide not to do this?   They need to do something formal.   They do not ""need"" it. They'd like it. But then we'd also like a lot of things. I'm not sure why we should qualify that as ""needing""."
Yogscast,3dqiee,KirinDave,8,Sat Jul 18 18:49:48 2015 UTC,"Well maybe if he didn't come back, the Yogpods could continue. Think about it. The Yogpod was so great because they didnt see each other irl, and had more to talk about. If he isnt in the office, then they wont see each other as much. Then they could do more Yogpod!"
Yogscast,3dqiee,Mahoganychicken,9,Sat Jul 18 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"I would rather have the yogpod than the youtube content, to be honest!"
Yogscast,3dqiee,rusins,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:45:57 2015 UTC,It would only work if Simon had a shitty mic XD I can't listen to the newer ones because it doesnt sound right! XD
Yogscast,3dqiee,Mahoganychicken,17,Sun Jul 19 13:32:28 2015 UTC,"I have missed Simon, and for even longer I've missed 'Original Simon' - a quieter, more refined and calmer Simon who screams much less - that Simon became more distant the bigger the Yogscast became. I hope this break has given him time to reset so if he does return he doesn't feel like he needs to be outrageous in every video. If he decides to retire then I'll certainly be sad about it, but ultimately it's his choice. I'm starting to think perhaps his hiatus was more than just illness, and perhaps something inside Yogs happened which is delaying his return. Perhaps somehow linked to all the TotalBiscuit drama that occurred a while back. But that's my crazy conspiracy voice talking. In the end I don't care which 'version' of Simon comes back, as long as he's there I'll be happy."
Yogscast,3dqiee,GuiltyCynic,22,Sat Jul 18 17:44:58 2015 UTC,"So I think modern Lewis is acting a lot like classic Simon.  The original pair was the bumbling, not stupid, but ignorant Dwarf and the straight man star captain. Or in WoW it was the hunter and the paladin. One was derping off in the corner while the other had to carry the raid.  Simon originally was not about screaming, it was about his ignorance of the environments Lewis intentionally stuck him in to generate wild antics for the both of them, principally because Lewis was secretly (or not so much) just as incompetent. He played a false straight man to Simon's silliness.  Simon got wilder, Lewis had to likewise play more managerial to reel in the antics, but the audience was focused on Simon, not Lewis, despite the pair being the secret sauce.  Then we got Lewis solo content, or content with others, like Sjins Farm or Farming Simulator. You realize Lewis is probably just as bumbly as Simon, even moreso because we don't have /r/shitsimonsays, we have /r/shitlewissays. In reality neither of them are one dimensional caricatures that you can play off each other ad nauseum, but the natural growth of the channel got both of them stuck in roles. Go watch Simon's older solo content of him trying out games, he was a legitimate critic half the time and having fun the other half without having to act stupid to do it.  Point is, a lot of us Yogs from back in the day of shenanigans like the first Yogpod DnD game were attracted to the parody of the classic straight / comedian duo the Yogs were handing us. Then they stopped parodying it, because their audience thought it wasn't a ruse. So Lewis got flat, Simon got ridiculous, and now we have had months of Lewis demonstrating his range of personality and being fantastic about it, and if Simon comes back I want him to do it on his own so he can do the same. Forcing them together, especially to act as flat one dimensional facsimiles of their original personas, is probably the kind of brain drain that burned Simon out in the first place.  Modern Lewis is free to be stupid, free to say the dumbest things, but still show sparks of ingenuity in between fits of incompetence. Hes not screaming or wailing like the kids want Simon to act, but that is just annoying to the older audience, whereas Lewis being legitimately helpless literally keeps me coming back for more every week."
Yogscast,3dqiee,Xanny,7,Sat Jul 18 18:27:31 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. I've been listening to the yogpods from the start again, and I gotta say, I miss those times and that Simon. sheds tear, just the single tear"
Yogscast,3dqiee,rusins,5,Sat Jul 18 20:44:36 2015 UTC,"I remember subbing to BlueXephos after watching this video after being linked to it.  I would occasionally watch their videos when they came out but mostly I would bulk watch during a boring night shift.  It was a niche thing, but this main duo on the channel had a chemistry that made it a lot of fun to watch.  When they started doing Cata videos and Lewis and Simon would just ramble on about WoW and any old thing, that's when I really fell in love with the channel.  For me, this was the golden age of the main channel.  Lewis was a great catalyst for Simon.  He could send him off on one of his tangents and the whole thing was like sitting and listening to two of my friends shooting the shit.  It was the perfect background noise.  After watching some content featuring Lewis on other channels or with other Yogs, I started to realize that Lewis was the real gem.  He was the perfect straight man.  He could feed into Sips, Sjin, Turps, and Duncan and make them funnier.  The best of times come however, when Lewis starts to rage out.  If Simon never appears in another video, that would be sad.  He has a unique charm about him and I would miss him if he were gone.  As long as Lewis is making videos however, I will be a loyal subscriber."
Yogscast,3dqiee,dirt-merchant,4,Sun Jul 19 02:50:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly I feel like the channel has gone through so much that it's changed quite a bit. Unless Simon is able to change accordingly he's going to probably not really ""catch up""  so to speak. Kind of like how a group of friends works great together at the time and then when one leaves for a few years and then comes back, it doesn't really work out all that well. It's just how things work, if he can work it out well then it'd be great having him back, otherwise (and I hate to say this) it might be better without him..."
Yogscast,3dqiee,Metalgreek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:26:39 2015 UTC,"Hey man, can you update me on this whole Simon thing? Haven't watched in awhile and I'm confused."
Yogscast,3dqiee,Skippy7,0,Sun Jul 19 03:34:40 2015 UTC,Basically he's been gone for ages due to some sort of surgery. Like months and months gone. They say he needs time to recover and since it's been so long we can kinda get that it was major one although they won't say what kind.
Yogscast,3dqiee,Metalgreek,12,Sun Jul 19 03:46:36 2015 UTC,My biggest concern with him not returning is the logo. Will they still keep the honeydew logo that all of us know and love? Or will they change it to something that is more generic?
Yogscast,3dqiee,Samoht_Tloh,7,Sat Jul 18 15:01:07 2015 UTC,Could just change it to Xeph's face
Yogscast,3dqiee,ericd7,11,Sat Jul 18 15:49:09 2015 UTC,I'd put that face on a billboard any day.  I kind of like how modern Xephos is a Riker + Lewis hybrid.
Yogscast,3dqiee,Xanny,2,Sat Jul 18 18:16:20 2015 UTC,I can't even remember when Lewis changed his outfit.
Yogscast,3dqiee,spectrosoldier,14,Sun Jul 19 09:39:57 2015 UTC,"While Simon's been ill and recovering I've found the content to be a lot more exciting, I especially like the Lewis and Sips videos, simply because the two of them work really well with each other. I'm not saying Lewis and Simon aren't still the best team, but while he's been gone Lewis has found really good ways to make the main channel content more varied and include lesser known Yogs (Zoey, Zylus and Tom from the GTA vids spring to mind). Obviously him deciding not to come back would be sad and some people would find it difficult to get used to a Yogscast without Simon, but I think Lewis has the ideas to keep people interested."
Yogscast,3dqiee,Riggzon7,6,Sat Jul 18 15:04:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Lewis has done such a great job managing the channel while Simon's been away, in fact the content recently has been hilarious! I really hope Simon makes a return, if not it'll be really sad to see him go."
Yogscast,3dqiee,jaffas_on_toast,6,Sat Jul 18 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"Personally I wouldn't have too much of a problem if Simon decided to retire officially, but I believe that the Yogscast themself would have one little problem:  Look at the favicon of the website, look at the avatar of the main channel, the Facebook profile, Twitter, Twitch... even the Yogscast DLC for Sonic and Allstars Racing Transformed!  You will see Simon, or his character Honeydew.  The Yogscast without him worked out so far, but if Simon officially retires they'd have to work hard to find a new ""mascot"" that replaces the ginger Jaffa-gobbling dwarf we are all familiar with, something you look at and immediately think ""Yogscast"", otherwise there will be a disconnect between the brand and the general populus because people will eventually think ""What does this dwarf have to do with the Yogscast?"""
Yogscast,3dqiee,Bright-Spark,6,Sat Jul 18 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"I'd be devastated, but I'd respect that he has to do what's best for him."

Lewis and Simon together got me out of my depression and helped me get out of bed each morning to go to my computer and see what they uploaded that day. If he retried then they wouldn't have dragged us on this long; they would have told us by now formally. He'll be back. And when he is I'll throw a dinner in his honor with my friends."
Yogscast,3dqiee,SnowCone4673,3,Sat Jul 18 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"i'd definatly be sad for a while beacuse without simon and his humour the yogscast would lose someone who you could very well call the heart and soul,or at least,the jester who cheers everyone up and motivates them with his infectuous happiness.  it'd take a while,but eventually,i'd learn to live with it,though it would be weird seeing the main channel just be lewis,though he has proven that he can cope without simon,so if simon did decide that he didnt want to come back,well it's his life and i'll still love him,after all,we'll allways have all of the videos he was in to remember him,and there's twitter,and,diggy diggy hole !"
Yogscast,3dqiee,KingOfElysium,2,Sat Jul 18 16:35:48 2015 UTC,I'm a bit behind the times so forgive me but what exactly is the Simon situation? Is he just burnt out?
Yogscast,3dqiee,SpongeBazSquirtPants,3,Sat Jul 18 17:54:11 2015 UTC,He went into the hospital for surgery. It supposedly went well and he is recovering now.

Yogscast,3dqiee,GoldHusky,3,Sat Jul 18 18:15:13 2015 UTC,"I doubt Simon would leave, Lewis did say on a V-Log that Simon would be returning. I really hope he does come back though, even though the majority of the content that I watch with him in is older videos and the YoGPoD. Yogscast doesnt really work with just Lewis (even though he is my 2nd favourite member, 1st being Simon), remember, the original reason for Lewis making the channel was to get people to hear Simon. If it turns out Simon is leaving however it isnt a completally bad thing, he will get more time with Simone and with managing Simon's Baby Sitting Company."
Yogscast,3dqiee,TheJackFroster,3,Sat Jul 18 21:54:25 2015 UTC,"Simon was the reason I started watching the channel. So I miss him a lot already. I will be disappointed if he does not return.   That being said, I would not want him to compromise his health or his happiness to return to making videos.   I will still be grateful for the joy he's given me either way."
Yogscast,3dqiee,hateboresme,3,Sun Jul 19 04:02:38 2015 UTC,"My concern is less that he won't return and more that he can't return.  We don't know what surgery he had done and he was a smoker for many years, cancer of the mouth or throat would make recording difficult to impossible."
Yogscast,3dqiee,Happy_Gaming,3,Sun Jul 19 04:08:08 2015 UTC,I miss Simon.  Thats all I really have to say.
Yogscast,3dqiee,deckofkeys,3,Sun Jul 19 06:38:23 2015 UTC,"I would like to see Simon come back, but if he feels like he can't then that's fine. The main channel for me has been great, really enjoyed all the content, Especially with Lewis being able to spread out a bit to different channels and seeing the real Lewis. Seeing more turps is always fantastic, zylus,rythian and zoey in the TTT and gta has been great especially the competitiveness between Lewis and zylus.   Don't get me wrong Lewis Simon dynamic produced some fantastic moments, but the 24/7 adventure maps leading up to Simons break kinda put me off Simon especially the whole twitter drama as well. That being said I hope he does come back fresh and ready to go, but I would also say bring him back as a guest at first so he  doesn't burnout again."
Yogscast,3dqiee,Jbear125,12,Sun Jul 19 11:42:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Lewis and co have done really well(better?) since Simon has taken leave. Honestly, I know Lewis talked about Simon coming back but I can't help think he's been 'forced' into doing so by fans (YouTube comments in particular). As some others have said, if he wanted to come back, he would of by now. He stopped recovering from the surgery at least a month ago by now.  I want Him back, but I want to keep some of the cross channel fun there is at the moment. Arggghhhhh"
Yogscast,3dqiee,aaranprasher,7,Sat Jul 18 14:34:29 2015 UTC,"If Simon did decide to just stop altogether it would far from be the end of the Yogscast. They will endure, just like they always have. I personally would be very upset though because it was the original Lewis & Simon videos, way back in the old days of Minecraft, that brought their videos to our eyes. Many of us actually found them from back in that time, so I know I'm not alone in that aspect.  However, eventhough the Yogs seem to skirt around the ''when is he coming back?'' question with a ten-foot barge pole, I'm fairly certain he will return.. eventually. They changed some of the Youtube Channel icons recently, and just ask yourselves this - If the Yogs (ie Lewis etc) knew that Simon didn't want to do Youtube anymore, would they really make a brand-new piece of artwork around Simon's dwarven persona? That, to me, seems like a big giveaway that he will return. Because surely, many of the Yogs have said that they've been out to see him, have lunch with him, and things like that. Ofcourse, they are friends, but they are also co-workers and still have a 'business' to run - I'm sure they would have talked to him, and amongst themselves about such things,  I'm fairly sure Simon isn't done just yet.  Never fear, the Digger of Holes shall continue, raise your Picks and pray for our Dwarf's return. :)"
Yogscast,3dqiee,TheRealGuy01,6,Sat Jul 18 16:11:25 2015 UTC,"If the Yogs (ie Lewis etc) knew that Simon didn't want to do Youtube anymore, would they really make a brand-new piece of artwork around Simon's dwarven persona?   EXACTLY this. This, plus the fact that they (probably) would have said something if he had called it quits (or been ejected for the TotalBiscuit blow-up, then they would have been more likely to say something, considering the statement we got for the GameChap ejection), make me shake my head at the tinfoil-hatters spouting off that 'Simon's quit the Yogscast' or 'Simon died'."
Yogscast,3dqiee,OmegaX123,3,Sat Jul 18 18:00:40 2015 UTC,"Well, he's certainly not dead. If he is, someone is tweeting on his behalf."
Yogscast,3dqiee,eddiekins,11,Sat Jul 18 18:35:09 2015 UTC,"That's actually a common theory, at least in the YouTube comments, apparently. People think Lewis is keeping Simon's Twitter active to hide the fact that he's dead, or possibly that Simon died and Lewis snapped and now has a split personality one of whom is Simon (that's my own addition to the bullcrap theory, as far as I know, but YouTube commenters are often stupid enough that they'd probably believe it if it ever occurred to them)."

It's hard to put it into words, but... say the content before he left was dropping down to a 6/10, and the stuff on the channel now is an 8/10. Simon was still the only one who would occasionally turn it up to 11.  While I love watching and hanging out with many of the yogscast channels, Simon's moments of brilliance just outshine anything else."
Yogscast,3dqiee,SpaceShipRat,3,Sat Jul 18 18:15:05 2015 UTC,"I think that's pretty well said. For me it's like the videos with simon and more specifically with simon and lewis were it's own breed of video; like the yoglabs vids or the adventure maps.   They had a heart and a personality too them I can't see replicated anywhere else in a much more conspicuous way than other youtubers peronality. A lot of people are saying that the content on the main channel is very good now, and while agree for the most part it seems to me like it's videogame humor and content just like it is everywhere else. While it's good and the personalities and chemistries of the yogscast still is entertaining it is in the same way tons of other youtube groups seem to be which is why I treat it as somewhat temporary even now.   But without simon there will be a uniqueness that his absences would make me miss dreadfully although I only want his health and happiness."

Lewis, Duncan, Sips, and Sjin can be great together in the right circumstances even without Simon.  But their Minecraft content largely is suffering, and it's that content which has generally generated the majority of Yogscasts' lore.  Without that, they're just another Let's Play group.  They keep resorting to minimal-effort content like HQM modpacks to avoid coming up with their own concepts/themes.  These are dreadfully boring to watch the large majority of the time, centered around a lot of grinding, which results in a whole lot of nothing happening.  An exception is in some of the hijinks they've gotten up to in Blast Off, which has had nothing to do with the pack itself but rather the mechanics of the Minecraft Comes Alive mod and the rapport between Lewis, Duncan, and Sjin.  Simon was around for Deep Space Mine, and he did add to the banter which made it slightly more tolerable (when not just mindlessly yelling diggy diggy hole quotes), but even he couldn't rescue that series from its inevitable cancellation.    If not HQM, then they're using massive modpacks that none of them know how to use even a fraction of the mods out of, and that run absolutely terrible on their average fan's PCs.  People can't really play along, which I think is important for fans, enough so that people were playing an unofficial Moonquest pack on ATLauncher before when there wasn't an official one.  But with packs this big, the gang seems to lack any kind of focus because they don't ever delve too deep into any one mod; there's always something else to distract them, which they'll go scratch the surface of until they come across something that confuses them, then they decide they'll figure it out off camera (which usually means cheating something in).    The only thing that's going to save their Minecraft content is some genuine effort put into making a lightweight pack centered around a goal, a Yogscast-inspired side plot(s), editing out of boring bits, and an entertaining cast.  Tekkit had it.  Voltz had it.  Moonquest had it.  And it took them a while, but the end of Hole Diggers had it.  I think they can do it again, they just can't be complacent in expecting views and think we'll just keep watching this stuff forever."
Yogscast,3dqiee,_FyberOptic_,7,Sun Jul 19 15:58:07 2015 UTC,"I think the main channel content is much better without him, as is the TTT, prop hunt etc  Seems like an unpopular opinion here, but I'd like it if he never came back, unless he grows up and stops acting like a man child"
Yogscast,3dqiee,RekdAnalCavity,3,Sat Jul 18 16:31:01 2015 UTC,"All this talk about wanting the old Simon and Lewis back and nobody even mentions the YogPod. It was and always will be the best for me and I would love to see something akin to that come back. I know it's not nearly as profitable and everything else, but it was the real Simon and Lewis personality and that is what made it great."

Yogscast,3dqiee,PacoTaco321,6,Sun Jul 19 00:24:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I wouldn't be against it. I'd hope that without Simon being a screaming manchild, the channel could move back to its roots and be good content instead of just churning out the same old Minecraft videos to appeal to 12 year olds. I just honestly think Simon is a weak link in the yogscast, he can do a few games on the main channel and thats it. Lewis on the other hand is doing a load of videos with people and doing a lot of behind the scenes work and has shown that the yogscast can work just fine without Simon"

Yogscast,3dqiee,MisterManatee,5,Sat Jul 18 15:55:41 2015 UTC,"I for one would probably stop watching the Yogscast. I know this isn't a popular opinion but I started out watching when it was just Lewis and Simon rambling and that was just always going to be perfect for me. In all fairness, Lewis did a fantastic job growing his little Youtube channel into a reputable network, therefore giving other people a chance to shine, but to me it just wasn't ever as good as the chemistry Lewis and Simon had; be it them doing Trucking Tuesday, or Minecraft, or the Yogpod, or even fucking Yogtrailers. There were some low points when the pair got exhausted, some videos I kinda chose to forget but they were few and far between and the highs always kept me coming back.  If Simon chose to retire from making regular videos, it'll be sad news. But I'll move on, happily remembering all the laughter he and Lewis have given me."

Yogscast,3dqiee,Archany,2,Sat Jul 18 21:52:26 2015 UTC,he had a surgery
Yogscast,3dqiee,standbyforskyfall,2,Sat Jul 18 23:19:30 2015 UTC,"I'd be quite sad. As likely many of us did, I found Yogscast through the old Simon and Lewis videos and quickly became a fan. From there I got to see connections and became a fan of Sjin, Duncan, and Kim.  Simon has always been the 'face' of the Yogscast though. It's his avatar that's always been their 'logo'. He's the main vocalist for the big Yogscast song, Diggy Diggy Hole.  It was HIM randomly singing those words several years ago in the highly revered Shadow of Israphel webseries that led to a FREAKING FULL LENGTH SONG being created. A funny moment that lasted about a minute, became an iconic phrase to millions of fans and spawned a song that gained 16M views on YouTube.  Simon leaving would be a huge, massive change. I already miss his crazy antics, like the old Yoglabs series and stuff. He's been gone for MONTHS now, and like many fans I just hope he finishes recovering and decides to return. If he doesn't, then that sucks but ultimately it's his life and I hope he has a good one.  In conclusion, I agree with what you're saying that the Yogscast is 'bigger than any one person', but also that out of all the people involved in the Yogscast, it's undeniable that he is one of the biggest people. Like I said earlier, he's so involved in the Yogscast that it's his avatar that's always been the main channel's logo. In that example, he is LITERALLY the FACE of the Yogscast."

Yogscast,3dqiee,superleam99,2,Sun Jul 19 13:20:35 2015 UTC,I don't really see why he wouldn't come back. He seemed to genuinely love his job and was one of the most popular yogs. Unless he seriously needs to focus on his health I really don't see him leaving.

Yogscast,3dr7ts,SpaceShipRat,24,Sat Jul 18 21:58:08 2015 UTC,"Certain times call for a message similar to ""no offence"" to avoid people taking your opinion the wrong way.   If I were to have said ""Zoey doesn't say much during recordings so I can't see her sense of humour .. but say more stuff Zoey!"" people would assume I'm insulting her. Starting a message off with intentions not to offend makes it clear to readers that it's not a critical message. It puts it straight into their mind that it's not going to be followed by ""but.."" and then a negative view on Zoey.   I see your meaning because often it's used in a ""no offence but this episode was shit"" and it offers absolutely nothing and is only there to use later if they're attacked for having a negative opinion (""but I said no offence!!"") but I can appreciate your thoughts on the matter. Thank you."
Yogscast,3dr7ts,sevsnapey,-11,Sat Jul 18 22:06:17 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm just telling you the phrase ""no offence but"" paradoxically makes a comment sound more hostile than it actually is."

So you can hopper something into the cube, and within the cube have it piped to a place within the cube (e.g. to a machine). You can then export the finished products to another face of the cube. An example of that is if you wanted to make a Mekanism ore quintupling plant which normally takes up a lot of space. You can pipe the input materials in (to the plant you set up within the cube) and pipe the export materials (e.g. quintupled ores) outside of the cube. It allows for more compact bases.  Another thing you can do is put down 2 compact machines and quantum link them so that those 2 compact machines in different places share the same interior. You can then use the linked machines to send items, power, fluids, and even your AE2 connection between far away places in the world. You can access your base's resources from a completely remote location -- even one located in a different dimension.  You will need nether stars to do that though. One for each machine you want to link together, and one for the device which establishes the link."

Yogscast,3dnb65,TakafumiSakagami,111,Fri Jul 17 18:21:40 2015 UTC,I think that they have decided to not segment the series across various channels. Cornerstone lessons.
Yogscast,3dnb65,sean-duffy,69,Fri Jul 17 18:30:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I gave up on Cornerstone after a couple of episodes because with the sheer amount of content it was just impossible to keep up with it. I much prefer this way.
Yogscast,3dnb65,06johansenad,12,Fri Jul 17 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"I probably won't watch more of this, if it's in this format. As soon as the video started, I checked Duncan and Kim's pages to see if their version of the video was online, thinking it was like Cornerstone.  I personally don't like Hatfilms (it's just personal preference, please don't downvote me to oblivion), so I didn't watch their POV during that. I am a huge fan of Duncan and Kim, so I did watch their POV throughout Cornerstone.  In this format, it seems to be focusing on Sjipos with glances to the Flux team and the Hatfilms team. For someone whose favourite people to watch are Duncan and Kim, followed by Simon and Lewis, this kind of doesn't appeal to me."
Yogscast,3dnb65,NiteLite,36,Fri Jul 17 21:43:51 2015 UTC,I would assume that they will be focusing on what ever team has the most entertaining content for each section (based on their own taste).

Yogscast,3dnb65,Deyerli,18,Sat Jul 18 11:50:41 2015 UTC,"But Cornerstone had many more participants. Here the are less people and even less teams. Also, which are the lessons?"
Yogscast,3dnb65,Scaeduria,47,Fri Jul 17 18:48:16 2015 UTC,"I think the lessons were that not all viewers had the time (or were willing) to watch all perspectives of a long running modded minecraft series, so the view count on all channels suffered compared to other series."
Yogscast,3dnb65,The-Magical-Moose,14,Fri Jul 17 19:06:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it'd work, but how about if they had a video like this one on the main channel, which acts as a ""highlights"". Then each team uploads their full perspective to their channel.  I think that it's harder to become engaged in something when the flow of conversation is lost slightly when the camera switches. I also imagine that it may be harder for the editors to try and decide which parts of each perspective to include; especially when I imagine Hat Films rarely talked about anything on-topic :D"
Yogscast,3dnb65,Scaeduria,17,Fri Jul 17 20:59:43 2015 UTC,"But the full perspective also needs editing of the three different viewpoints and if not enough people are interested in watching the entire perspective then it might not be worth the time editing it.   Also, the old Tekkit series already had something similar in a lot of episodes with the guys often splitting up in 2 teams and those videos worked pretty well I thought."
Yogscast,3dnb65,AwfulWaffleWalker,11,Fri Jul 17 21:16:46 2015 UTC,The old Tekkit series is incredibly different than this.. They were working on the same thing and were only 5 people not 9 split three ways doing incredibly different things.
Yogscast,3dnb65,Scaeduria,0,Fri Jul 17 23:39:54 2015 UTC,"They ended up working together, yes, but the early Tekkit episodes were quite different with for example Duncan and Lewis working on a sorting system, while Simon, Sjin and Sips were doing stuff over at Pig Island, with the latter receiving more screen time, so the former must have been edited more extensively (obviously based on what was more interesting to watch). Then there were also the times when Sjin and Sips were building a fence around Jaffa Factory and they don't even show their viewpoint in the video. I mean, I get that people want more content from certain people, but I'm just trying to explain why after Cornerstone they might have chosen to try this approach instead."
Yogscast,3dnb65,AwfulWaffleWalker,4,Sat Jul 18 09:23:15 2015 UTC,"I never said they weren't split.. I said they were different because there was only 5 people and the split and perspective was based on ""story"". For example one team would do a lot of the technical stuff and building while the other did the more amusing or weird stuff. For example Simon and the whole Pig Island stuff. I mean that was a loosely scripted series with everyone working on the same thing which this and cornerstone aren't anywhere close to. Tekkit also frequently would go back and show the other perspective instead of you just not seeing it at all (not always but frequently)."
Yogscast,3dnb65,RMcD94,2,Sat Jul 18 10:50:56 2015 UTC,Why not have both
Yogscast,3dnb65,AwfulWaffleWalker,5,Fri Jul 17 21:49:37 2015 UTC,"I don't see how combining them is the solution though. I'm not interested in most perspectives so I probably won't keep up with this because I don't see the point in only watching a few minutes of those I'm actually interested in and 18 mins of those I'm not.   I mean the cornerstone videos got the normal views for each channel, so it's not like it failed or anything. Guess they just expected people to watch them all instead of watching only those we're interesting."
Yogscast,3dnb65,MoleMcHenry,0,Fri Jul 17 23:31:36 2015 UTC,I sure as hell didn't because I have a grown up job. I ended up watching the compilations at the end.
Yogscast,3dnb65,Synonym_Rolls,18,Sat Jul 18 05:40:08 2015 UTC,"When discussing cornerstone, they said somewhere that they should've done it on one channel."
Yogscast,3dnb65,Gyvon,3,Fri Jul 17 19:02:17 2015 UTC,It's only one less team.
Yogscast,3dnb65,Deyerli,23,Sat Jul 18 01:21:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think it's better the other way because editing wise, editing 9 perspectives is probably a pain in the arse and it also leaves the choice to the viewer who to watch and when. If I want to see what happens with say Hatfilms, I can go watch them and get more Hatfilms content in the same series where everyone is in instead of hoping the editor finds their perspective relevant enough."
Yogscast,3dnb65,Br1ckFuckingMaster,7,Fri Jul 17 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"I love this method. I don't like the idea of ""here, watch these twenty minutes of gameplay and then do it all again but from a different perspective"". Because of that, I know I'd probably only end up watching this series from Sjipos' perspective and never see the other side."
Yogscast,3dnb65,akaispirit,8,Sat Jul 18 09:56:39 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd prefer being able to watch the main channels perspective and then going and watching Hatfilms, instead of just a clip now and then to remind us that their there as well. To me it's not watching it all over again because the teams aren't working together, their in different spaces competing against one another so it's not like it's going to be the exact same footage other than getting context for things like a death message popping up in the corner."
Yogscast,3dnb65,Farockz,5,Sat Jul 18 13:36:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed, with Cornerstone I only literally watched one perspective because I just didnt have the time/patience to watch the same video from somebody else's viewpoint. I much prefer this way because I get  to view all of the ""best"" of the participants in one video and therefore don't miss out on anything :)"
Yogscast,3dnb65,Fanglove,8,Sat Jul 18 11:07:48 2015 UTC,i would prefer that also. If not maybe an equal amount of viewing time. I would prefer more hat films point of view instead of 30 second clips.
Yogscast,3dnb65,NiteLite,4,Fri Jul 17 19:19:23 2015 UTC,I am guessing that was because they didn't have that much fun stuff going on with HatFilms for this episode (based on their own taste). I would assume that the editor tries to pick out the most interesting parts of each episode (and possibly the parts that need to be in for the rest of the episodes to make sense).
Yogscast,3dnb65,AwfulWaffleWalker,6,Fri Jul 17 23:15:49 2015 UTC,Think it's more this is a main channel video so they're going to focus on Lewis' perspective instead of other people.
Yogscast,3dnb65,NiteLite,3,Fri Jul 17 23:35:47 2015 UTC,"Might be part of it. Since it's only a main channel series, it would also make sense to edit it so it aligns with the viewers and humor of the rest of the main channel (and not the type of humor mainly featured by HatFilms :P)"
Yogscast,3dnb65,AwfulWaffleWalker,5,Sat Jul 18 00:07:49 2015 UTC,"Well, we can already tell Hat Films aren't being featured much since they probably got about a minutes worth of perspective in the entire 20mins."
Yogscast,3dnb65,miniflip,2,Sat Jul 18 00:12:53 2015 UTC,"No, I you can't know that. Hat films did pretty much nothing in this episode."
Yogscast,3dnb65,Fanglove,0,Sat Jul 18 10:51:21 2015 UTC,"o, I you can't know that. Hat films did pretty much nothin   How do you know they did nothing. We didn't see them."
Yogscast,3dnb65,miniflip,0,Mon Jul 20 13:18:22 2015 UTC,Yes you did? You saw exactly what they were doing....
Yogscast,3dnb65,Fanglove,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:40:28 2015 UTC,"xactly what they were doi   No u saw about 3, 30 seconds clips?"
Yogscast,3dnb65,Scaeduria,9,Tue Jul 21 13:03:51 2015 UTC,I don't think that's necessarily true. Looking back at the GMod Races both Hat Films' and especially Sjips' perspectives were featured more. It's just that in this first episode they have to explain the set-up of the series (which is always something Lewis does so it makes sense the first part focuses on his viewpoint) and the second part had the whole tuba thing which was probably the funniest footage so that got featured over other stuff. I'm sure that other episodes will have a different focus depending on who has the funniest stuff going on.
Yogscast,3dnb65,AwfulWaffleWalker,6,Sat Jul 18 09:29:44 2015 UTC,"Hat Films were barely shown in the gmod race until the very end.. It was mostly Sips and Sjin with the occasional Lewis and Duncan. I expect this to be the same especially since the main team is Lewis, Sips, and Sjin.  Also I said elsewhere, but this style really hurts Hat Films because their humor comes from their long rambles which doesn't go with a series that wants to constantly jump around. They tried to fit in snippets but that really doesn't work."
Yogscast,3dnb65,GoldHusky,2,Sat Jul 18 11:01:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I kind of like it this way, you get to see all the good bits in less time, rather than spending much longer between interesting stuff. Plus, there seems to be a bit more interaction so far than they had in cornerstone, where a big issue was seeing the intro / ending on every channel and suchlike.  Either way, I think it's good to have some variation to how these sort of series are presented."
Yogscast,3dnb65,TheLoneEnderman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"The problem is, it removes impact from the humor, I didn't find the whole Berlin wall speech funny, as it came out of nowhere."
Yogscast,3dnb65,_FyberOptic_,40,Sun Jul 19 18:06:51 2015 UTC,"This actually held my interest, which a lot of the more recent Minecraft series have had a hard time doing, to be honest.  It's not a massive pile of mods, there's a goal, there's a bit of plot it seems, and it's competitive.  I got a few laughs as well.  So it has a lot of things going for it.    Minecraft modding is as strong as ever, I've always felt that there's really no reason that Yogscast can't pull off another successful series in the right circumstances.  So we'll see how this goes.  It's just a shame that Simon isn't there."
Yogscast,3dnb65,juhache,12,Fri Jul 17 18:54:45 2015 UTC,Feels like if Simon didn't come back for this.. are we EVER going to see him again? :(

Yogscast,3dnb65,serjonsnow,12,Sat Jul 18 00:42:04 2015 UTC,The only problem I have with the series so far is not enough Hat Films. I'd personally have no problem with watching full videos of their perspectives.

I don't mind watching short snippets of the others, when they're doing something entertaining, but Hat Films constantly talk about some shit totally off-topic, it's almost like a podcast! Even when they're being boring in-game (like crafting), they're chatting about hilarious stuff. :)"

Yogscast,3dnb65,Ubiqus,3,Fri Jul 17 18:56:10 2015 UTC,"Especially that they recorded this in 2 days, it's just few episodes. Cornerstone was too long for seperate videos of each team, this would be perfect in that format."
Yogscast,3dnb65,NiteLite,7,Fri Jul 17 19:52:25 2015 UTC,"If they take 2x 8 hour recording sessions and split it up into 20 minute episodes, that turns out to 48 episodes. And that is if they don't use any footage that happens at the same time when recording. If they show 2 episodes per week that means they will finish some time in January :P   ""Just a few episodes"" might not be applicable."
Yogscast,3dnb65,AwfulWaffleWalker,4,Fri Jul 17 23:23:47 2015 UTC,Don't know where you're getting 8 hours of recording. Doubt they recorded anywhere near that much. Also a large majority will probably be cut out no matter how long they recorded.
Yogscast,3dnb65,NiteLite,7,Fri Jul 17 23:42:30 2015 UTC,"I was expecting the sections with little action to be covered by the section where stuff worth covering happens on more than one ""team"" at the same time.  Everyone has been talking about the recording ""taking all day"" and sips even said he had to cancel his livestream because the record went on long into the evening hours.  If you get a bunch of people together, record for ""two full days"" and only end up with 4x 20 minutes, I would be surprised."
Yogscast,3dnb65,AwfulWaffleWalker,0,Sat Jul 18 00:05:35 2015 UTC,"Often times there's bits where no one is doing anything interesting (at least in normal minecraft series), breaks, all that sort. Also how long all day is to them we don't know, but I'd be surprised if it was 8 hours simply because all the people involved do have to spend some of their day editing for their own channel.  I also though Sips only streamed early in the mornings. At least, I've never seen him do an evening stream."
Yogscast,3dnb65,NiteLite,3,Sat Jul 18 00:11:01 2015 UTC,"I guess you are in a different timezone? I am referring to them as evening streams since he usually starts them some time between 2pm and 3pm in his timezone, and keeps going until 6pm for the longer ones.  Based on all the tweets and stuff going on it sounded like Lewis had managed to get everything to allocate to entire days, which is why I assumed a full working day. Even with only 5 hours of actually recording time, that would give us about 30 episodes :)"
Yogscast,3dnb65,AwfulWaffleWalker,0,Sat Jul 18 00:29:36 2015 UTC,"I was slightly earlier since a lot of the streams I've watched he's had to stop to do recordings.   I still doubt it'll be that many though, but we'll see."

It takes a lot of concentration to keep up with what's going on and personally I find it a little exhausting. I can't quite enjoy the video, and I have to watch it twice to keep up.  My ideal scenario would be: 3 different videos of each teams viewpoint with small cuts to show the other teams here and there. So you would know more or less what what going on with the other teams even if you only had time for one perspective, and also, you could choose the perspective you're the most interested in.  The way it is now, all teams in 1 video, sure saves a lot of time for the viewers and there is no need to choose a perspective, but it takes away a lot of the enjoyment. At least for me."
Yogscast,3dnb65,MoonlightSandwich,3,Sun Jul 19 14:03:13 2015 UTC,"I can't but agree, though I don't think the number of perspectives is the problem as much as the number of cuts form one team to another.

I think we deserve a bit more info than we have gotten so far, and until we get that people are going to come up with weird conspiracies.

Yogscast,3dn2vp,corobo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:52:44 2015 UTC,"As a random nobody recovering from hip surgery it's not as easy as just hopping on a computer and doing stuff.  There's constant dressing changes, an uncountable amount of pills to be taken, orders for both bed rest and exercise that feel like they should just cancel each other out. Orders to not use the (in my case) leg but also orders to keep using it in certain ways to aid the healing process. All of these need to be scheduled in and often done at home. At home. Not in an office.  During all this it's hard, extremely hard, to have a positive outlook all the time. I can't even imagine how hard it would be if my job was entertainer, I'm only just managing working from home as an IT guy that doesn't need to be cheerful for the job. Even that's starting to take its toll. I mean damn I'm up at 4am for no reason right now. Woohoo.  Then at random you get an odd pain where the incision was. Did I just pull a stitch? Nope. Random pain is the name of the game when you're recovering from surgery. Sure they might have given you some oral morphine for this sort of situation but it's not instant. By the time it kicks in you aren't even in pain anymore  Which leads to the side effect of opiate painkillers. They can bung you up, like seriously lock it all down in the colon department. Yet another thing to take away the cheer of the world and yet another reason to be at home and not in an office for the inevitable release (no, it's not a relief. You gotta force it out at this point. Force. Hello, haemorrhoids. Please take a ticket and I'll worry about you after the rest of the medical stuff that needs taking care of.)  So yeah recovering from surgery isn't just a thing you get up and recover from. I definitely don't speak for Simon but hopefully I've given a few examples as to why it may not be easy to just do things after having surgery.  Side note, you don't deserve anything from Simon or the Yogscast. Whether he's still recovering or just enjoying some time off leave him be, the crew has been been entertaining for years without much in the sense of breaks. They can have a few months off, you'll survive."
Yogscast,3dn2vp,Platfoot,2,Tue Jul 21 04:01:04 2015 UTC,"Wow man, first of all I hope things soon get better for you! How long ago did you have this surgery?  I don't think we deserve anything from the Yogs either. What they do is free for us to enjoy, and I don't they ever promised one or two vids a day on paper. The fact that they still do that because they can is amazing. However, I do think frequent updates are not too much asked. The thing pretty much all Yogsnau(gh)ts have in common is the love for Simon.  And your daily routine sounds very tough, I can understand how you can not do this at an office. I do think though that the beauty of Simon's jobs is that it can be done from home. But then going back to my previous, we still don't deserve anything so it's not like I'm pushing him."
Yogscast,3dn2vp,corobo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:56:24 2015 UTC,"Surgery was on the 27th June, almost a month later still on the same routine I was in hospital. But anyway I was only going through my routine to show how much of a pain in the arse recovering from surgery is, don't worry about me I'm recovering haha :)  I do see where you're coming from wanting to know everything's fine and hoping to see Simon in your YT feed again but it's a pretty private matter in most cases no matter where the surgery was.  It's one of those things that goes beyond medical into technological though when you start working from home. Me personally I just need access to a single server via a secured VPN. The VPN I have set up drops out every 5 minutes or so and absolutely suuucks. Sure it could be fixed and will be, but my usage is purely text. Imagine playing and recording a game where your net kept dropping out or you suddenly got massive lag during a funny bit of recording and had to scrap it. I know Sips is able to do it however he does but that's a more permanent situation that's worth solving. If Simon's not recovered yet or is due to recover soon it may just not be worth setting it all up.  Thinking about it Sips even goes into Castle to record the bigger projects on occasion, hinting it may not be super feasible to do them remotely.  Of course, I don't claim any of this to be the situation they're in. I have no idea whatsoever and am just thinking aloud."

Yogscast,3dn2vp,DementedPanda69,15,Fri Jul 17 16:57:51 2015 UTC,They did a 2 day long recording session. Doesn't mean they recorded it all? Maybe they just wanted a big backlog as it'd be hard to arrange everyone to be around at the same time weekly.
Yogscast,3dn2vp,sevsnapey,7,Fri Jul 17 17:02:12 2015 UTC,Hat Films returning from America and recording for two days with everyone could simply be a scheduling issue. Similar to Cornerstone this series will apparently have muliple people involved which means they're disrupted from their regular recording schedule to appear in content that's not going on their own channel.   This means that while they have everyone together for the recording it's probably better everyone clears two days and they'll have backlog to edit and release opposed to recording three episodes here and there which would further disrupt everyone's unique schedule.  I don't recall seeing anyone say that the two days of recording was the entire series wrapped (correct me if I'm wrong as I don't use Twitter.)  edit: I think I replied to the wrong comment.

Yogscast,3dnfjw,pittpenguin123,6,Fri Jul 17 20:25:43 2015 UTC,"Mountain Dew actually surfaced in Virginia in the early ‘40s as a lithiated-lemon mixer used with hard liquor in bars; similar to 7-Up. The concoction was originally created by two brothers, Ally and Barney Hartman, who jokingly named the drink “Mountain Dew” after “Tennessee Mountain Moonshine”, a popular product in the hills of Virginia at the time- the mixer was at one time even billed as “zero proof hillbilly moonshine”. The moonshine theme didn’t stick, but the hillbilly did, and when Mountain Dew was trademarked and labeled, it included a cartoon hillbilly taken from the creators’ original label design, who would eventually grow to become the drink’s official mascot for years to come. Later named ‘Gran’Pappy’, he soon became a popular icon in bars, and appeared on several Mountain Dew products and merchandise, lasting for several more decades."

I much prefer this way because I get  to view all of the ""best"" of the participants in one video and therefore don't miss out on anything :)"
Yogscast,3dq6m9,Farockz,5,Sat Jul 18 11:10:33 2015 UTC,Cornerstone was an excellent test of a large series with multiple views spread over channels. I think people are too critical of the lack of Flux/Hat Films in the editing of the first episode. If this continues in further episodes I can understand but perhaps the best moments were captured by Sjipos.   I think the best way to sate the hunger of multiple views is to extend the video length to around 25 minutes.
Yogscast,3dq6m9,sevsnapey,6,Sat Jul 18 11:59:22 2015 UTC,"I think extending the video would be a better option for them, I agree that this video seemed to focus very much so on the Sjipos team (but perhaps that's what content was most entertaining this episode) and I think that in later episodes the focus will change, depending on who's content better serves the purpose (ie: when they actually get around to building I assume they will move focus to Hat films/ Flux buddies due to them probs being more focused on building haha)."
Yogscast,3dq6m9,Farockz,4,Sat Jul 18 12:51:20 2015 UTC,"the thing is though,we dont really know if team sjipos' content was the most entertaining,beacuse we only got to see small pieces of the other teams' content,honestly,when they do stuff like this with the other channels,i really think that those channels should be allowed to use the stuff they record on their own channels as their own pov.  after all,as a huge fan of the sirs,considering i find their stuff the most entertaining,i would have loved to seen their pov,seen them getting their gear and jetpacks before going back to the middle and seeing everyone having started without them,they spent their time filming stuff for a series which may not last long,so why should they not be able to use content of their own ? the same goes for the flux buddies and hannah,at least with cornerstone we had multiple POVs,which meant i could just watch the sirs pov and enjoy the series."
Yogscast,3dq6m9,KingOfElysium,2,Sat Jul 18 14:02:01 2015 UTC,"But that's kind of the case for any Youtube video ever. There is always footage that doesn't make the cut and we (usually) never know if it was funny or not. So, this video is not some kind of exception to that and I don't see a lot of people complaining about this practice generally.   Also, I doubt there was some kind of rule that stated the other participants weren't allowed to upload their own viewpoint. I mean, I doubt Hat Films would have participated if that had been what they wanted and this request was denied. This is just speculation of course, but after Cornerstone it was probably discussed if it was worth the time and effort of editing up separate videos for the other channels and they might've just decided against it."
Yogscast,3dq6m9,Scaeduria,2,Sat Jul 18 14:25:13 2015 UTC,"I just didn't have the time/patience to watch the same video from somebody else's viewpoint.   But with cornerstone you were NOT getting the same content from different POV's, Flux Buddies doing flux buddy stuff is vastly different to Strippin and Benji getting rail craft sorted and talking about whatever they were talking about.  TTT GTA V etc those benefit from an edited approach, you have the same 4-6 voices synced up to to the 6 or so videos (sans Zylus in GTA V) so no matter what view point you watched as a solid whole, you would be repeating nigh on everything watching the same from another video.  Take Sips' Gmod with Hat Films content for example, most if not all were purely his POV and you hear someone else say ""OMG That's a great hiding spot."" when viewing as a spectator, yet Sips' cant show the viewers that as he has no eyes on the scene.  I wanted to see what Smiffy's hiding place was, or that excellent show down, but all we get is the audio.  But had that match been on the main channel, we would have seen that hiding place or that chase.  So back to the quoted part, that's like saying ""I don't need to watch Cat Island cos I watched Flux Buddies and that's on the same server.""  I'm not saying you have to go back and watch all the other videos, some purely chose Hat Films and missed out on X Y or Z, but they were happy, but as someone who did watch all of the POV's, I know that outside of the intro and outro you got 4 different experiences."
Yogscast,3dq6m9,Ginger_Tea,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"Alot of cornerstone was them working on the same projects together or upon the same theme, there was alot more overlap between them and therefore I don't think the comparison you made between Cat Island and Flux buddies is a fair one to make, considering they never had any overlap at any point (correct me if i'm wrong).   I think the edited videos they are producing here are alot better then how Cornerstone handled it because it has my attention more. Its fast, its efficient, they take all of the best bits of what they produced and make it condensed into a fun and engaging video, rather then me having to spend an hour watching all of the same content, but with gaps in between which may not be so interesting/entertaining. However, I would like these videos extended perhaps a bit (10 more minutes?) to add a little bit more spice into them ,ie: more focus upon the other teams.   Its just what I prefer to watch, for instance with Sip's livestreams, I watch the highlight reels he produces rather then the actual livestreams because they are, in my opinion, more entertaining."
Yogscast,3dq6m9,Farockz,2,Sat Jul 18 18:37:42 2015 UTC,"Oh that devolved so early on I tend to forget it ever happened, but even if they were working on a common goal the team interaction via voice chat was separate from the rest.  Hat Films and Flux Buddies was all about the bants, we as viewers would miss out on so much had it been a single video even if it was longer.  It's a fine balance and the first episode didn't pull it off, I don't recall anything from the Hats aside from killing Sips and Sjin and building a Nether brick wall, 2 Girls 1 Flux, just the desktop with his choice of task bars.  As I said in another thread about this (not the video thread) it felt like someone was watching Corrie and then changed over to Enders and Brookside and back again, they might have been OK missing most of the other shows, but the person who watches all 3 is miffed to find that instead of getting 3 shows they got one with a strong bias to one show.  Cat Island has not had any interaction with Flux Buddies that I know of1, just Time Police.  But the point I was making was although Cornerstone started out to be one thing, it ended up basically as Hat Pack 2, Flux Buddies 1.5 and Sjins Farm / botania hybrid which just happened to be recorded at the same time as the others in the same location.  Hat Pack is not Flux Buddies, nor is it Cat Island, so saying ""I don't need to watch Hat Film's Cornerstone videos cos I watched Rail Bros."" is the same as ""I don't need to watch Cat Island as I watched Flux Buddies"".  Yes you can see what Hat Films have built as you go around the compound, but you wouldn't know about the tree house of Rail Bros far away.  Say you only watched the Flux POV, you would not know about the mile high club for many episodes (although they did by watching footage as it was recorded in short weekly sessions instead of say 4 hours to give a months worth of content).   1 Well there was that portal punching scene but that's not really the same as it was just a plot device to transition from Yogscast Complete to RR3/Project Flux."
Yogscast,3dq6m9,Ginger_Tea,4,Sat Jul 18 19:12:02 2015 UTC,I only watched one view point in cornerstone because I only cared about one perspective. Really don't care for a best bits cut especially since it's being decided for us before we even get to see any of the original videos.
Yogscast,3dq6m9,AwfulWaffleWalker,7,Sat Jul 18 11:31:19 2015 UTC,"i would love this to happen,even if the series winds up being smaller in length then cornerstone,the reason i liked and watched cornerstone in the first place was beacuse of the sirs pov,thats the only reason i knew it existed,we had far too little of the other povs,it just mainly felt like the team sjipos show,tbh."
Yogscast,3dq6m9,KingOfElysium,4,Sat Jul 18 11:59:00 2015 UTC,"Seconded, Cornerstone's format was much nicer and we could focus on the people we wanted to watch and get a more complete picture of what they were doing every week."
Yogscast,3dq6m9,128hoodmario,4,Sat Jul 18 11:46:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I liked cornerstone because when it came out I could watch the perspective I wanted. Then if I had extra time or something interesting happened in another perspective, I could go watch those."
Yogscast,3dq6m9,AwfulWaffleWalker,2,Sat Jul 18 12:00:21 2015 UTC,I agree with both of you. I think cornerstone just had too many perspectives. what about 10+? I think it would be nice to have team perspectives that would mean only 3 which is far more manageable and as they are in competition there would be less content crossover.
Yogscast,3dq6m9,zenaex,2,Sat Jul 18 11:29:55 2015 UTC,Cornerstone had 8 videos a week with four teams. It was roughly 2 hours of content a week which I think is a little unreasonable if you're looking to watch each perspective.  In hindsight I think a collective team view would have been beneficial. Taking the best parts and cutting between teams similar to Derpulies and keeping the team-only videos for the experience.
Yogscast,3dq6m9,sevsnapey,3,Sat Jul 18 12:04:57 2015 UTC,I think having a collective view for cornerstone would have been nice only if each channel had their own viewpoint as well. Those that actually care about what's going on in other perspectives can keep up easily and those that just want the pov from a specific channel and don't care about the rest have that.   But if it had just been a single best bits and nothing else that would have been shit imo because so many of the parts I enjoyed about cornerstone weren't things that could be cut up.
Yogscast,3dq6m9,AwfulWaffleWalker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:08:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, I meant ""and keeping the team-only videos for the experience."" as keeping the regular 30-minute videos too. I probably should have said keeping the team videos for those who want to watch the full session. It wasn't very clear sorry about that.  I think the collective view would have been an excellent way to have people watch the series but not require them to miss out on perspectives or the entire series because of time restrictions."
Yogscast,3dq6m9,sevsnapey,2,Sat Jul 18 14:13:19 2015 UTC,Maybe have all the individual perspectives then one chop up of the best bits like they did for the first part. I think that would work.
Yogscast,3dq6m9,RicketyZubat,2,Sat Jul 18 12:13:28 2015 UTC,I agree. I couldn't help but feel like I must have been missing out on something when only seeing 30 second clips of the other perspectives.
Yogscast,3dq6m9,Pasplin,3,Sat Jul 18 17:55:46 2015 UTC,agreed. It barely felt like hatfilms were even there.
Yogscast,3dq6m9,Timeline15,-3,Sat Jul 18 11:51:50 2015 UTC,"Cornerstone = initially a group project; all on different channels; people complain they cannot/don't want to watch all of the videos  TOD = separate groups; all on one channel   They didn't learn anything from cornerstone, cornerstone should of been all on one channel from the start and this should of been all on different channels from the start, I love yogscast but they listened to the fans complaining that they couldn't watch it all and said hey next time we'll put it all on one channel, I'd understand if the views where bad for cornerstone but they weren't, I feel like they where maybe around the average view counts   I myself watched 3/4 POVs for cornerstone and the people complaining that it was the same thing are wrong, the start and ends where all the same I give them that but everything in between wasn't, more people watched majority of the POVs then didn't   I very much enjoyed the first episode and will be watching it but feel it should be separated into its own channels or extended"
Yogscast,3dq6m9,SirRockNRolla,4,Sat Jul 18 13:10:33 2015 UTC,"gotta disagree with you on the cornerstone having been on just the one channel thing,we would have missed so much amazing stuff and so many funny moments had that been the case,including a ton of stuff the sirs did like the hand of truth being made and pretty much anything else related to hat films which was hilarious,which was anything they did,basically."
Yogscast,3dq6m9,KingOfElysium,2,Sat Jul 18 14:06:07 2015 UTC,"My argument is that with it being initially a whole group series and teamwork being the main factor for it that it should of been all on one and with TOD being group vs group vs group that it should be on different channels then just the one, I'm saying if anything should of been on one channel it should be the everyone working together series but yeah we would of missed out a lot of it was which is why a lot want this to be separated so we don't miss things or conversations or whatever makes us enjoy which ever group we do"
Yogscast,3dq6m9,SirRockNRolla,2,Sat Jul 18 14:13:14 2015 UTC,"you do have a point though, a cooperative series where they're supposed to make one common base, would make more sense all in one channel.  A competitive series with everyone in different corners making different bases would make more sense as separate series."
Yogscast,3dq6m9,SpaceShipRat,2,Sat Jul 18 22:25:38 2015 UTC,"The Walls could probably benefit from a hybrid approach, first episode team views as they build and banter.  Second episode, the walls come down and it's edited to include all POV's as in some cases the whole team is wiped out early on so they have nothing to show for their footage, but keep the run length around the same time so you don't see a 3 minute video and skip it as they obviously lost."

Yogscast,3dn9jk,Saiklin,2,Fri Jul 17 23:26:43 2015 UTC,"The meanings of the crop stats? I've covered that in episode 6's thread, albeit rather late in the thread's lifetime. All the information I give though is from Industrialcraft's iteration of the system, upon which that mod was based. Most of the information on that thread has been copied here, barring a part about environmental factors:     Growth is the rate at which crops will mature and negatively affects how much produce you get per harvest. Very high Growth plants can act like weeds and will spread to any adjacent crops - even if they're occupied by other valuable crops. Gain is how much produce you get per harvest, and negatively affects the growth rate. It is normally worth going for high Growth and Gain, one level in growth won't negate on level of Gain and vice versa, though the ability to use bonemeal on them (and in other modpacks the watering can) makes the Growth stat a bit more of a luxury. Strength's original name was Resist, and made your crops more resistant to being overtaken by adjacent weeds (or high Growth crops) or being trampled. It negatively affects how many seeds you get when you break the crop.     Since making that post though, I have a few other notes. Growth's ability to overtake nearby crops may not have been modelled or just be turned off by virtue of actual weeds being disabled. However high Growth may still increase the rate at which crops will spread to nearby unoccupied crops. In addition, Growth and Gain's negative effects upon each other may also not be modelled in the new mod.  Each stat in the original mod could be taken up to 31 (crops with over 24 Growth would exhibit the weed behaviour mentioned above), however the current mod apparently caps each stat at 10 instead, making achieving the ""perfect"" crop considerably easier."

For the emotional response it invokes or because it's equals counting a 10'000 piece puzzle pack out loud? You have never been angry when you failed a task several times in a row? Yeah, so I'm aloud to experience these emotions playing a game.  2) Your house, your house-rules. Your car, your car-rules. Your game, your game-rules. <- This is a very simple rule to many such problems.  3) Inverted? Sure, if that has your preference. Make sure to reset them to my likings once you're done playing on my account.  4) FF? Never played any. I've never seen the 'use' of forcing a personal preference onto someone as a 'universal fact' though.  5) I don't go outside because it's raining or there's nobody to play with. If a friend called and asked to go get a drink I'd save the game and went out. RL > Games every time.  6) Loot? My enjoyment lies in playing with my friends. If they want it they can take it. If I really want it I ask to have it and get it. If we both really want it, this one is his, the next one is mine. You loot steal? I'll talk to you about it. You loot steal and keep doing so to such an extend that I can't play the game with any enjoyment anymore and I won't play games with you anymore. I don't need people in my life who can't share or give.  7) Er. Sometimes I keep awake a little to late but I always function the next day. Does that make me boring?"

Yogscast,3diz43,PolyGanon,4,Thu Jul 16 17:30:28 2015 UTC,"Glad to see the series back. I suppose the kingdom would currently be best described as a settlement without a castle, or a village. Technically it's still within Blackwood's Kingdom overall if I remember the lore correctly.  The quarry can mine all the blocks, it just needs a Tool Quality Upgrade - the research for which I believe was done whilst getting the auto-crafting bench. There's three tiers which mimic pickaxe levels of Iron, Diamond, and Max respectively. A Buildcraft quarry is essentially Max tier for comparison, as ores like Adamantine and Sanguinite are beyond a Diamond Pickaxe's ability to mine but are harvestable anyway. The pickaxe held by Honeydew does not affect what the quarry can mine.  Mycellium can be produced through Witchery with either Mutandis or Super Mutandis (the latter works, the former I can't remember). Right clicking a grass block (not tall grass) will transform it (though podzol may have been added to the list of possible transformations as it's randomised). To get it to spread, replace the nearby grass with dirt as I don't think Mycellium can replace grass, and vice versa.  That mushroom cave might need to be a bit bigger, as the farm might only be able to harvest giant mushrooms - after all, it'd be troublesome to track which mushrooms are your 'seed' mushrooms and which are for collection. If the area does need to be bigger, it may be viable to convert the hidden chasm into a mushroom cave."

Yogscast,3dfyxh,igsey,7,Wed Jul 15 23:38:20 2015 UTC,"Amazing, thank you!  This is perfect!  Looks like the first couple of Tekkits have been done, I'll see if my girlfriend likes them and then I'll work on doing some more if she wants.  Thanks so much!"
Yogscast,3dfyxh,OatmealDome,5,Thu Jul 16 00:34:11 2015 UTC,"excellent! I'll sub some videos too :p (also I get to rewatch tekkit, bonus!)  EDIT: We need some coordination here so we know what videos each of us are doing so we don't start overlapping. I'm going to try doing Bin Chute (76)"
Yogscast,3dfyxh,OwlinAutumn,2,Thu Jul 16 01:47:41 2015 UTC,"I'm finding it's pretty easy just to look at a video, see if it's been finished or not, and move on. The one thing I would say, Amara's search isn't very good from what I'm finding. Some of the vids are titled ""Tekkit"" and some are titled ""Jaffa Factory"" so they don't all come up at once, and hardly any come up if you search ""Yogscast"". Unless I'm using it wrong. Which is a possibility ... Can't seem to pinpoint if the search only looks at titles or descriptions, too, but either way, it's not doing a great job for me. If I am right, I might make a suggestion to at least put Yogscast in the title? And perhaps ""Yogscast Tekkit Jaffa Factory"" somewhere in each description? It might help the search engine."
Yogscast,3dfyxh,OwlinAutumn,4,Thu Jul 16 20:43:21 2015 UTC,This is awesome. Thanks for sharing about this - I'm gonna go do some captioning ...
Yogscast,3dfyxh,pittpenguin123,0,Sat Jul 18 08:53:41 2015 UTC,"i was gana post that, u beat me to it"
Yogscast,3dfyxh,OwlinAutumn,7,Thu Jul 16 03:58:53 2015 UTC,"I did want to add - not that it really helps you right now, and I'm not sure if this is something the Yogs would be interested in, or if they have to request it, or turn it on themselves, or what ... But I know several months back, YouTube started letting some channels have user-created captions on their channels. They'd supposedly be input by fans and then screened by YouTube to make sure it's not spam/nonsense. It's not a solution like Amara, but if someone from the Yogs sees this, if captioning is too time consuming for them, I know there are willing fans (like myself) who would gladly take a few hours every few weeks to help caption things for others. Not sure how it works to get it enabled for one's channel, but thought that would be a good thing to put out there."
Yogscast,3dfyxh,_Darren,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:00:07 2015 UTC,"I asked ages ago about fan created subtitles and a few yogs replied saying it was a no go due to potential trolling.  EDIT: Found it, was just Martyn, his reply was 'Community based subtitling are three words that should never be together in regards to YouTube lol'"
Yogscast,3dfyxh,OwlinAutumn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:26:18 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about that when I saw it, and I would agree - if there was no moderation of it. But supposedly YouTube 'screens' the submissions before they're actually allowed onto the video. Who knows how intense the scrutiny is, but if it was any good, it would be better than the choices available now. I would hope that volunteer captioning with a group of probably paid moderators looking at a lot of subs would be cheap enough for YT than choosing to go with the horrid 'auto' subtitles or nothing.       That's all speculation, though. The number of channels in the 'FAQ' listed as having the User Submitted CC at the moment is very short - who knows if that list is updated at all, but if it is, it may not even be possible for the Yogs to have it, much less want it. Could be an interesting thing to look into, though.       I always think of the Livestream from a couple Christmases ago, when Lewis and Simon watched the intro to the first day Livestream with the auto-captions turned on and just laughed hilariously the whole time.       It was so funny. But so sad, too, because that's what anyone who is partially or fully deaf has to put up with if they even want to try watching YT without casting their net wide for third-party sites and maybe lucking out or just giving up altogether. Which I think sucks. I hate thinking anyone's missed out on the Yogs for any reason."
Yogscast,3dfyxh,madafaku,2,Thu Jul 16 15:26:35 2015 UTC,"The CC button on youtube, but They're put in automatically by google, so they aren't very reliable.  Doing it manually is extremely tedious and time consuming even on like a 2 minute video.  Can't imagine anyone taking the time to do it for 100+ 20-30 minute long videos. So if the subtitles are messed up there isn't too much you can do. Maybe (if you REALLY want to put the time in, and share with her.)  transcribe the video in notepad, then rip and reupload privately to your own account and add the subtitles yourself.  but I'm 99.9% sure that google content ID still flags private videos, so that's probably out.    Sorry, try out the CC button, maybe the text will be close enough for your girlfriend to understand and enjoy."
Yogscast,3dfyxh,Ceylan_CLC,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:47:21 2015 UTC,"There is no CC button on the Tekkit videos sadly, I believe they have to be enabled by the uploader."
Yogscast,3dfyxh,Ceylan_CLC,6,Thu Jul 16 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"plus it won't be that accurate when there is 5 people speaking at the same time  I was at a subtitle group translating the SOI series into Chinese, I was in charge of the subtitles, and it took like 3 hours per 20 minutes long video to make the subtitles. So I don't think there is anyone out there willing to do it for free."
Yogscast,3dfyxh,madafaku,5,Thu Jul 16 00:31:50 2015 UTC,I'll do them if she's interested in watching more.  I've finished university now so have a lot of free time at the moment :)
Yogscast,3dh538,Captain-Action,3,Thu Jul 16 05:59:49 2015 UTC,"More like not that great. It's not easy to start off in, no book, guide, or anything despite even the early recipes being a bit on the complicated side, and it doesn't have anything later on that's really that great. Last time I played with it it basically felt like a whole lot of work (especially since to get any of the higher up stuff you basically have to have an automated kill farm) for very little pay off."
Yogscast,3dh538,AwfulWaffleWalker,3,Thu Jul 16 06:18:24 2015 UTC,"it doesn't have anything later on that's really that great   True, but it does have those handy base-self-destruct toys that Parv used to great effect! Unintentionally, of course."
Yogscast,3dh538,MrPookers,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:34:58 2015 UTC,Oh! I forgot about those.
Yogscast,3dh538,ladymulti,5,Thu Jul 16 14:17:06 2015 UTC,"Ridgedog and Parv both basically completed it.  Really, though, there isn't much to do in it and its really tedious at the start."
Yogscast,3dh538,SOSDarkPhoenix,4,Thu Jul 16 06:28:47 2015 UTC,"Blood Magic just wasn't appealing to the Yogs in their serieses. It's tedious, and doesnt do much that other mods can't cover. Also, EE has been remade as ""Project E"" It's an awesome mod :) Check it out!"
Yogscast,3dh538,shoury,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:08:08 2015 UTC,"Equivalent Exchange has gone through a redesign and is currently out, in beta I believe, for 1.7.10, so Project E is more of a competitor rather than a successor now :P"
Yogscast,3dh538,Kucan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:38:16 2015 UTC,"It's a fairly powerful mod given the time to build stuff up for it, but other mods are more powerful than it for what you're looking for, such as EE2/ProjectE if you just want infinite bonemeal(along with infinite everything).   There's the Watering Can from Extra Utilities for cheap infinite bonemeal, which can strengthened so you can automate it.  Torcherino can simply accelerate time for everything. (Tip:Torcherino plus EE2/ProjectE makes for a very fast end game)  However, most of the ongoing series aren't those that lend themselves to Blood Magic. They're either using tech mods or other magical mods that usually have some method of super bonemeal.  Finally, the people running those series are either not the type to spend time researching and building up Blood Magic or are spending their efforts towards other mods, such as Botania."
Yogscast,3dg4v4,Rowena_Lee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:26:48 2015 UTC,This covers a couple of the most annoying things :D But those tools... the time and flint they waste by remaking them all the time is unnerving:S
Yogscast,3dgvfr,SeckzyPanda,5,Thu Jul 16 04:16:21 2015 UTC,Hat Films. I can count them as one person right? Really they just work so well together it's hard to choose one over the other.
Yogscast,3dgvfr,AwfulWaffleWalker,4,Thu Jul 16 06:22:12 2015 UTC,Their minds are linked so they technically are one person
Yogscast,3dgvfr,Diabetix1,4,Thu Jul 16 11:29:59 2015 UTC,"Depends what for.  I love Zoey's playthroughs of Indie-style games, like the Cave and gone home, for instance  Kim's playthroughs of Valiant hearts: the great war and her story were awesome  Hannah is my go to for Tell Tale games  Stripping and Benji were the only cornerstone POV I really got into  I also really like both Panda and Will because their videos seem a lot more ""raw footage like"" which is generally really nice to watch/ listen to when doing something else."
Yogscast,3dgvfr,Butterflykey,9,Thu Jul 16 07:07:17 2015 UTC,"Simon.  You may all have your own reasons, but I liked how he just knew what he did, and what he was good at, and how to make that funny no matter what mod they used or map they played."
Yogscast,3dgvfr,Felidae0,3,Thu Jul 16 05:08:35 2015 UTC,"Dearly love 'em all, and they all bring me joy."
Yogscast,3dgvfr,Gnarlstone,3,Thu Jul 16 11:33:10 2015 UTC,Sjin. Especially in blast off. It's crazy how much he adds to the dynamics between Lewis and Duncan.
Yogscast,3dgvfr,xMikelx,7,Thu Jul 16 15:10:58 2015 UTC,"Personally, Sips will always be my favorite. We share Canadian blood eh? :)"
Yogscast,3dgvfr,SOSDarkPhoenix,3,Thu Jul 16 04:42:00 2015 UTC,I really like Sips too. I guess he and Tom are competing for #1 atm
Yogscast,3dgvfr,Titanic95594,2,Thu Jul 16 05:03:37 2015 UTC,"Panda is probably the most distinguishing to me because he gives the nostalgic feel of the Yogscast from past years with his lengthy videos such as Dayz. The raw, dynamic action he experiences is truly something I enjoy."
Yogscast,3dgvfr,FirelordAlex,3,Thu Jul 16 05:40:07 2015 UTC,"I love Turps. His banter, quick wit, and humor suit my likings perfectly. That being said, Sips, Simon, and Lewis rival him. Everyone else is just as good, I'm never unhappy when any Yogscast member shows up in a video. Turps showing up, though... That's something special. Anytime I see him, I hear ""HWAAAAH, GOLDEN LEGENDARY!"" ;)"
Yogscast,3dgvfr,MedicInDisquise,2,Thu Jul 16 05:32:41 2015 UTC,Sjips all the way.
Yogscast,3dgvfr,MushirMickeyJoe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:11:58 2015 UTC,Hat Films 'n' Sips (not necessarily together but it does make for a good team).
Yogscast,3dgvfr,Cockwombles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:44:34 2015 UTC,Probably Turps.   It does change and everyone ( apart from one who annoys me) brings something special.
Yogscast,3dent6,PolyGanon,3,Wed Jul 15 18:00:40 2015 UTC,"I was quite a bit behind on Time Cop episodes and only just caught up, I've been wondering are they doing an adventure map now (thus the title change) or is this something they built themselves? If it's the latter I'm really impressed by the Yogscast's building skills! Though either way kudos to the map creators."
Yogscast,3dent6,128hoodmario,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:11:19 2015 UTC,"That ending was so confusing. Still waiting for them to explain why they even suddenly jumped into doing that whole rogue AI thing, hopefully that'll happen next episode."

Yogscast,3dalwf,The_Alchemist25,47,Wed Jul 15 03:36:18 2015 UTC,I have a pretty strong feeling that he doesn't want to come back. Buuuttt I may be being a presumptuous twit.
Yogscast,3dalwf,FrazahLion,23,Wed Jul 15 10:15:47 2015 UTC,To be honest I think that has gone through all our minds at some point.
Yogscast,3dalwf,atomicpenguintrooper,15,Wed Jul 15 10:25:43 2015 UTC,I think that's a valid thought at this point. Ain't nothing wrong with not wanting to come back of course.
Yogscast,3dalwf,Vinesma,5,Wed Jul 15 13:56:49 2015 UTC,"That's my suspicion as well. I feel like he would be back by now if he wanted to be, and it also makes sense that Lewis, et al wouldn't be eager to announce that he's definitely not coming back unless they were totally sure.  It feels pretty silly thinking so hard about some person I don't know and who has no bearing on anything important in my life, but it's just what happens when he's my favorite yogs-person to watch. I just like his energy and sense of humor.  In any case: Happiness and health to him!"
Yogscast,3dalwf,analogWeapon,2,Wed Jul 15 21:11:23 2015 UTC,"It kinda feels like that, and I'd get it. It kinda breaks my heart, but I'd get it, it's a stressful sort of job."
Yogscast,3dalwf,SpaceShipRat,2,Wed Jul 15 23:58:29 2015 UTC,Lewis did say it would likely be a couple of months a while ago; time's not up yet.
Yogscast,3dalwf,AluminiumSandworm,3,Thu Jul 16 07:48:35 2015 UTC,I believe he does want to come back however doesn't have the energy or the time currently. What if hes found a date? ;)))

Yogscast,3dalwf,corobo,7,Wed Jul 15 18:33:48 2015 UTC,This seems like a good place to bring up something I thought of a while ago.

Yogscast,3dalwf,Grizzly931,29,Tue Jul 14 21:02:41 2015 UTC,I think it basically got associated with the Jaffa Factory/MoonQuest continuity.

Yogscast,3dewwh,ryanisablond,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:48:38 2015 UTC,Egg cartons aren't as acoustically absorbent as foam and fluffy textiles.
Yogscast,3dewwh,analogWeapon,2,Thu Jul 16 18:05:07 2015 UTC,"Seems like you found your product. Just wanted to mention that acoustic paneling won't help much with low frequencies. If the neighbors are upset with your subwoofer, you're SOL. They're much better suited to absorb frequencies in the vocal ranges and higher.   If you have hardwood floors, throwing in some rugs will help too.  Even bookshelves with books will help absorb/diffuse the sound.    Good luck."
Yogscast,3dewwh,ryanisablond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:22:08 2015 UTC,Good point on the rugs. The floor and ceiling are oft forgotten in the acoustic treatment process.
Yogscast,3dfrur,Teremol,8,Wed Jul 15 22:43:15 2015 UTC,"I can't answer everything, but I'll fill in what I do know.  In regards to Simon, he was ill and needed surgery, he's recovering and should be back in videos once he's up for it.  There was a break between Simon and TB on Twitter that spilled over onto Reddit. I don't have all the details about that as I was trying to avoid digging too deep into that drama.  As for lack of uploads from some people, the only ones I know of are Nilesy and Zoey. Both I think are dealing with some personal stuff, but are currently occasionally streaming and in Zoey's case also jumping into videos on both the Main and Kim's channels.  Hopefully this helps clears a few things up."
Yogscast,3dfrur,KoLycaon,7,Wed Jul 15 22:51:07 2015 UTC,"The other posters have pretty much covered everything. But just in case the OP wants to read Zoey's Tumblr post about her absence: http://zoeyp.tumblr.com/post/122940276267/where-in-the-world-is-zoey-proasheck   Ignore any gossip/drama you hear about on Tumblr. Speaking as a Tumblr-er, that place is filled with the skidmarks of humanity who will make mountains out of molehills and believe that they, and only they, know the truth.   As for 'Yogs distancing themselves from the main channel', if you watch the videos on the main channel for yourself you'll see that particular rumour is rubbish; Sjin, Duncan, Sips, Rythian, Zylus, Martyn, Kim, Hannah, Turps and Zoey have all been on the main channel recently."

Yogscast,3dfrur,Netyr,14,Fri Jul 17 10:24:06 2015 UTC,"The TB business was due to him disagreeing with the way the Yogscast disclosed sponsored content (although it was meeting official standards at the time). Now he could have contacted the Yogs to discuss it but in typical TB fashion he created numerous posts, videos and podcasts flaming them instead. Maybe TB had a point but the way he dealt with it doesn't exactly do much for his credibility."
Yogscast,3dfrur,Netyr,2,Wed Jul 15 23:16:18 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but TB mentioned them amongst other channels where Simon took to Twitter to complain about him (which is against the contract they signed with Polaris) and then complained about the fans.  That whole issue was because of the way Simon very poorly handled the situation.
Yogscast,3dfrur,Seddaz,0,Mon Jul 20 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"Didn't TB sign that contract too? Don't forget who made the first move. The Yogscasts response to the attack was nothing compared to TB and his supporters constant harassment.  ""And then complained about the fans"", not even going there, we all know how TB treats his own fans."
Yogscast,3dfrur,Netyr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:37:59 2015 UTC,"Hang on, TB mentioned that he didn't like the way the Yogs disclosed sponsorship. That's a fair point since the t+c changed and the Yogs hadn't changed the way they did things. He also brought up other people. Also TB has no say in what his fans do, you can't hold him responsible for stupid people doing stupid things.   Simon made a personal attached first, followed by Lewis. TB did not reply back and tweeted without mentioning names.   You don't have to go there, Simon called the fans on reddit babies. TB doesn't treat his fans badly, the man gets pissed off at people who support the ""Cynical Fleet"" as it promotes the bad side of the fan base, something he doesn't want to be brought back to him. He doesn't accept requests for things on his channel and when he tells people apparently that's bad. The guy keeps it professional, he sees subs as his customers and treats hus business as a business.   Honestly most problems come from the fans, in any famous persons life. I refuse to say I'm a fan of the Yogs due to the way the fanbase acts, childish and entitled, which changed the duo to acting like idiots and having Simon scream like a child. The man was a physics student, I looked up to him as a model as he managed to move on from his failures and still have a good life.   Same for other things I enjoy, one on topic would be TB himself. I love the man's work and enthusiasm for his job but I can't say I'm a fan, I don't watch his stuff unless I'm going to purchase a game or want the news.   Got very preachy in the end but I can't stand it when people can't see the facts and blame others. Simon started it, he was at fault and TB could have easily retorted and escalated the whole thing but didn't (as I'm sure you're aware TB does get easily pissed off, and I fully expected shit to hit the fan) Simon then had a go at the fan base because they didn't like how he was acting."
Yogscast,3dfrur,Seddaz,0,Mon Jul 20 17:32:03 2015 UTC,"I've tried to write a response to this twice now, but you know I really don't care about this shit, it was put to bed months ago and there's nothing more to discuss.   My final thoughts: TB had a point, he also has terrible people skils and a sensitive (and quite substantial) ego. A lot of people spat their dummies out over petty things."
Yogscast,3dfrur,Netyr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:24:11 2015 UTC,Why does it feel like TB has stopped being himself and now just starts pointless drama or reaching at low hanging fruit for attention?   Thank god we still have Jim Sterling

I think most of them are just meant to give each other a hard time over something for the fun of it. The livestreams are probably a little closer to how they interact more casually.

Turps made an official statement   It's inconceivable that anyone could possibly believe that these unfortunate and ill timed deaths were the work of a crazed murderer.   Personally I believe these are works of finesse and the person responsible is clearly a highly intelligent individual who will continue to evade prosecution and possibly play a horrific amount of Hearthstone while they wait for the heat to reduce.

Also it is nice to see small behind the scenes bits. Like when Hannah randomly flexes or just general banter between the guys and gals.
Yogscast,3d5j6r,tucker277,10,Mon Jul 13 18:13:44 2015 UTC,"Well, firstly I should clarify that the Yogscast business really only applies to the main channel, as none of the other channels or content creators are employees of Yogs. Most of us have our own businesses around our own channels, and as a result expense ourselves for games and not Yogs.   To add to what others have said, sometimes we get free copies of games - IF the publisher is Youtuber-friendly. But there's no guarantee and sometimes they make you jump through hoops first! An example of this is that Shadow of Mordor deal that went so totally wrong in the US - Youtubers that agreed got the game two days early, but couldn't show certain scenes, and couldn't use characters/places/events that are mentioned in the Hobbit or LOTR - which is impressive when the opening monologue is Galadriel, and Gollum is everywhere in it."
Yogscast,3d5j6r,yogslomadia,5,Tue Jul 14 15:00:24 2015 UTC,"Do you mean games they play in their free time, and/or games played by background-staff?  As far as my knowledge of expenses/VAT goes, they should be able to at least claim the VAT back off the games, and/or buy the games on the business (which basically translates into buying them with people's pre-tax income, thereby making them cheaper by one's effective tax %).  (That would be referring to the games they play and make videos out of, and assuming my knowledge of expenses is at all correct)"

Yogscast,3d0zyy,fluffbox,16,Mon Jul 13 13:09:14 2015 UTC,"I think people need to remember that as much as youtubers are personalities, they are real people with FEELINGS, not fictional characters, and it's rude and hurtful to speculate about their feelings, motives and behaviour in a forum where there's a good chance they will read it. Their relationship and the ins and outs of why it ended and what happens now are none of our business, apart from what they choose to disclose - we do not know them! Even though they documented their lives and their relationship publicly in their vlog series, they're still entitled to privacy, and to speculate about this stuff in a forum that you KNOW they frequent is cruel, it's kicking people who you already know are down! How would you feel if people you never met were talking shit about you online because you just split up with your partner because of their own presumptions about you and making deductions like some kind of armchair Sherlock Holmes? If people you did not know were taking sides, placing blame? It would hurt, wouldn't it? So why are people doing that to people of whom they are a fan? You are not speculating about the plot of a series, you are speculating about real peoples' real lives, and the unfortunate ending of a real long-term relationship full of a lot of painful emotions for both of the people involved - this kind of ""discussion"" helps no-one. It's not for anyone to take sides in a relationship that none of us are involved in, even if it feels that you know them because of their vlogging. They asked us not to speculate about it but people are doing it anyway, and it's very thoughtless and insensitive to be doing it here, of all places, where people know they frequently read and comment on posts. If you wouldn't say it to their face, don't post it in a place where they're likely to read it - be respectful."
Yogscast,3d0zyy,Addyizoth,2,Mon Jul 13 02:19:57 2015 UTC,She literally said that she doesn't mind in the video.
Yogscast,3d0zyy,fluffbox,12,Mon Jul 13 06:37:07 2015 UTC,"She said that it's ok to vent, not speculate and attack - placing blame, taking sides, insulting Martyn, attacking him for ""stringing her along"", ""Martyn doesn't seem upset in his videos so obviously he doesn't care about the break-up"", talking about who is worse off as if they aren't both hurt, etc etc. Talking about personal feelings is one thing - it's expected because they were very public in their vlogging and so people were very passionate about their relationship, it was a fandom in itself and so people are going to be upset about it and need to vent - but some of the comments in both this thread, previous threads, youtube and twitter since they announced their split have been really unnecessary. This is an amiable split, they are remaining friends, they have their reasons, they are both heartbroken but still care about one another. Nobody set out to hurt the other and the change of living circumstances now is unfortunate but not deliberate and so using it to side with one or the other achieves nothing. They are dealing with it in a very adult way considering how public they have been and how difficult this must be for both of them in the position they are.  But then you read shit like this: http://i.imgur.com/oxR0uRz.png  It's cruel and awful and achieves absolutely nothing. That's not the venting Kaeyi said was ok, that's talking shit about a person and a situation you know 1% about, and an attempt at White Knighting that's really unnecessary when you can see how close they still are and that they clearly both still care about each other. The whys and wherefores and what happens next are none of our business - they've laid out all the information they're open to sharing. Having a public vlog doesn't mean they don't deserve the same privacy and respect you would give someone without that vlog - the same respect Hannah and Lewis were (99%) given when that came out. They aren't fictional soap opera characters, this isn't a dramatic plot line, this is two peoples very real lives being turned upside down and it's not as black and white as there being a winner and a loser."

Yogscast,3d0zyy,benman19,40,Sun Jul 12 18:06:09 2015 UTC,"Why feel bad for Martyn? He'll be living in a big house, he'll be in a good position. The worst thing that could happen is that it might get a bit lonely but otherwise, he has more than many people even dare dreaming of.  Kaeyi is far worse off in this whole affair. She's left with a small flat, probably less money as I suppose Martyn supported her financially while they were a couple, and she can't even take the cats with her. Plus, her illness might make it harder for her to get a good start in a new job. On top of that, she'll be missing the income from the ITLD channel, which probably wasn't a ton, but not insignificant, either.  On top of it all, the breakup was Martyn's idea. Emotionally, he's probably much more ok with everything.  Don't not feel bad for Martyn, but I think he's ended up with a far better deal than Kaeyi."
Yogscast,3d0zyy,Falgo,8,Sun Jul 12 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry for a dumb question, but what is her illness? I tried to find out some time ago but there are too many videos to sieve through."
Yogscast,3d0zyy,FenrisValda,14,Sun Jul 12 20:29:53 2015 UTC,It's called fibromyalgia. Martyn has been a great support for her while she was working through most of the issues with it. She's doing amazing with it now. I'm personally glad that they're still going to be friends. Sometimes people are just better to have as friends and that's just the way it works.
Yogscast,3d0zyy,mundabit,2,Sun Jul 12 20:45:43 2015 UTC,"This hits so close to home, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia around the same time as Kaeyi  was becoming more open in talking about hers, at the time I was married to a man with depression and Martin and Kaeyi's relationship had been through and was going through a lot of what my husband and I were experiancing and it was a great help to us to have ITLD to almost make us feel supported and guided through.  My husband and I separated, in a way very similar to Kaeyi, My husband didn't want me there indefinitaly but  as welcome to stay untill I had a house lined up. I moved out of our house, into a place that was not healthy for me physically (Too cold and cut off) or emotionally (The housemates there abused me) and I struggled to work as my condition deteriorated and then I struggled to pay my bills in regards to physio and therapy.   But My ex-husband stuck by me as a friend, he still offers to pick me up and drive me to work to save me the long bike ride in, and in return I let him drive my car. Most of my furniture is at his house, which is why I'm welcome to go to his house after work because he has a bathtub for me to have an epsom soak in."
Yogscast,3d0zyy,vanish1234,2,Mon Jul 13 15:16:16 2015 UTC,"It's not really our place to discuss this but martin was clearly supporting her a lot.

Yogscast,3d0zyy,NiteLite,13,Sun Jul 12 18:43:17 2015 UTC,"Well, as far as I understand, Martyn was taking care of all the house related bills already, since Kaeyi was working on getting better so I don't really think he will be much worse off financially."
Yogscast,3d0zyy,benman19,-11,Sun Jul 12 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"How does a larger house come with more cost in general? He won't use that more electricity or water than in a flat simply because he has more space. The only cost I could imagine being significantly affected by size of house would be heating.   Kaeyi used to live in her student house with flatmates and moved in with Martyn, thinking they'd be together not necessarily forever but at least for more than One and a half years. She moved a great distance to be with him while he had to simply move from one part of Bristol to another. When they moved in, Kaeyi had a job. Now she doesn't, she might get the one she applied for, but that isn't certain at all. She isn't where she was before, she's back at zero, while Martyn has a home, a job and quite honestly, I don't think it pays badly. I mean, you've seen the videos, their lifestyle wasn't what I'd call simplistic - And I'm not saying all YouTubers are millionaires, but come on, don't kid yourself, I don't have the money for all the stuff they got, do you? - , and since Kaeyi didn't have a job, most of the money for all their things probably came from Martyn.  And God damn, is it so hard to spell his name correctly?"

I found it so odd how Martyn was able to move on with his life so quickly and upload videos on schedual and continue to livestream as it nothing was going on. And then Kaeyi is heartbroken probably crying and trying to sort out her entire life that was just taken from her. I really respect how martyn is allowing her to still see the cats as they are hers and is allowing her to stay in the house for as long as she needs but she is the one who has to rekindle her life and get a job just to have a stable income all the while Martyn is sitting happy in his home and have a reasonably stable income through YouTube
Yogscast,3d0zyy,sevsnapey,39,Sun Jul 12 19:39:53 2015 UTC,Moving on in life is necessary if you wish to keep your head above the ever rising water of bills. Working through the curve balls life throws at you is something you have no say in and just have to deal with.  While Martyn is continuing his work it doesn't mean that he's not feeling upset while doing so. Putting on a brave face for the world while you're breaking underneath is what people deal with every day. This is a fact for many Youtube personalities - being happy and fun for the camera is in the job description. Similar to customer service.  To blame him for ending a relationship is petty and not a position you have a right to stand in. While this decision did put Kaeyi in a difficult position to remove yourself from a relationship you're no longer content in is better than to continue it out of fear of hurting your partner.  Pull your head out of your arse.
Yogscast,3d0zyy,spectrosoldier,12,Sun Jul 12 20:24:20 2015 UTC,"Martyn admitted last year that he basically had been putting a brave face on for most of his life, which led to his breakdown (for lack of a better word) last December."
Yogscast,3d0zyy,Fonjask,27,Sun Jul 12 21:31:06 2015 UTC,while Martyn is sitting happy in his home   I don't think you can make these claims.
Yogscast,3d0zyy,cannotfoolowls,12,Sun Jul 12 20:11:12 2015 UTC,People can be really distraught and still hide it so well no one ever notices. There are thousands of depressed people who can keep up a facade at work and then crumble as soon as they leave.  And some people don't seem to react to trauma at all and then suddenly do months later.  People deal with grief etc in a lot different ways that aren't always visible.
Yogscast,3d0zyy,benman19,3,Sun Jul 12 20:37:53 2015 UTC,"No, that's not what I said. Don't agree with things I never claimed.   If you feel that a relationship isn't leading where it should be leading, if you don't feel you love your partner as you used to, if you feel that what you want from a relationship isn't the same as what your partner wants, then why should you go on? Anyway, just because his private life may be a rollercoaster doesn't mean his job has to suffer from it. Christ, I wouldn't be in Universtiy now if I had let my depression take over much longer. Put on a brave face and get through the day; such is life.   It's not like Martyn broke up with malicious intent; I'm sure he and Kaeyi are actually still friends. All I stated were undeniable facts about their respective financial and housing situations. But if I broke up with my partner I wouldn't let him or her stay at my place indefinitely because they're worse off than me. And I'm sure Martyn would help Kaeyi if she was struggling to find a new place in some way."
Yogscast,3d0zyy,TheTurnipKnight,6,Sun Jul 12 21:00:56 2015 UTC,"I did the same, and I just couldn't wrap my head around their idea of buying the house. It was so ridiculously irresponsible and I just knew it wouldn't end well."
Yogscast,3d0zyy,Inthelittlesophie,-6,Mon Jul 13 06:26:17 2015 UTC,I read the comments for this heartbreaking video and restraining my tears was hard but I feel appauled that people were saying that Martyn was stringing her along which I will admit and put my hand up and say that Yes I did have these thoughts and even when he said that he had kept it going far to long than what he should of which in a way is him stringing him along but I just found it appauling that they were bashing him for something that obviously he was confused about and wanted to make it work in some way. But anyway I know this comment was a bit of a rant and I was contridicting myself but I wanted to know how other people thought about it.
Yogscast,3d0zyy,JammyMan,46,Sun Jul 12 19:26:31 2015 UTC,"To be honest I suspect most of the idiots suggesting he was deliberately stringing her along have probably never had a proper long term relationship. No one goes into a relationship thinking that but people change, things come up, life gets in the way. At the end of the day at least it isn't a messy breakup and they can remain friends not many people can say that about their exes haha."
Yogscast,3d0zyy,hurricanerach,17,Sun Jul 12 19:42:28 2015 UTC,"They were together for two years. It can take a while to really know what you want out of these things, and I honestly don't believe this was him stringing her along. I think it's pretty rare that people know immediately that they want to marry and have children especially at this age. I agree that it's cruel to bash him and I'd love everyone to give him a damn break!"
Yogscast,3d0zyy,TrueHamoodE,-9,Sun Jul 12 19:34:58 2015 UTC,"So sad bye inthelittlewood we all loved you, just saying."
Yogscast,3d0zyy,CookieWarrior,-5,Sun Jul 12 20:18:43 2015 UTC,Lol I didn't even know Martyn had a girlfriend
Yogscast,3d0zyy,RicketyZubat,6,Mon Jul 13 13:50:36 2015 UTC,She looks exactly the same as in that video when she gets dressed up for something.
Yogscast,3d0zyy,PartyPoison98,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:49:08 2015 UTC,What did the comment say?
Yogscast,3d0zyy,Fonjask,8,Sun Jul 12 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"Kaeyi looks like a completely different person to how she looked a few years ago. Wow.  This is what she looked like before: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA_-rKhhoUI   Last line I'm not quoting was downright mean, uncalled for, and breaking rule 8 which is why the comment was removed."
Yogscast,3d0zyy,PartyPoison98,5,Sun Jul 12 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"So I imagine the last line was quite an insult on her appearance if anything. If anything it just looks to me like shes not wearing much, if any makeup in the video compared to other videos"

Yogscast,3d4jqj,jeremymule,2,Mon Jul 13 13:46:19 2015 UTC,"Beep boop, bot.  Dear human, could you set up your bot to link to the stream directly instead of making a text post?  Also, if this isn't in yet, please create a flood filter so it doesn't post the same stream within 12 hours of the last post (since that's just the stream dropping and reconnecting), to prevent spam.  Posts linking directly to Twitch will be autoflaired."
Yogscast,3d4jqj,Fonjask,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"Human here.  As far as I am aware the sub-reddit only allows an exact URL to be posted once. So if I set this up as a link-post, it would only allow it once?  I have also taken anti-spam into account, and I'll be keeping an eye on it to ensure it is working correctly. It's not 12 hours however, just in case someone were to go out to dinner and then come back a few hours later, or something. Then it would be legitimate to post again. But of course posting within a short period of time would be spam, yes."
Yogscast,3d4jqj,Fonjask,2,Mon Jul 13 20:13:28 2015 UTC,"So if I set this up as a link-post, it would only allow it once?   The way to get around that is to put ""&resubmit=true"" after the URL, if that's possible for your bot to do when submitting.  For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitch.tv%2Ffonjask&resubmit=true   It's not 12 hours however, just in case someone were to go out to dinner and then come back a few hours later, or something.    I don't think that happens with the non-fulltime streamers, but 6 hours would be fine as well.  What's it set at currently?"
Yogscast,3d4jqj,Fonjask,2,Mon Jul 13 20:23:38 2015 UTC,"Ah excellent, I was not aware of that extra command. I will switch it over to link-posts and see if it all works still.  The anti-spam is based on how long it takes them to go online again from when they go offline. So it doesn't have a set time per-se, but will ignore small to medium times between offline-online.  So if it works as intended, someone could do a 24 hour stream and drop a bunch of times within that, but come back within a few minutes, and it would only post about it once at the beginning.  So I will be keeping tabs on if it works as intended, but the idea is to strike a balance between being 100% sure there will be no spam and making sure no legitimate stream notifications are missed."
Yogscast,3d4jqj,JJB-125,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:35:04 2015 UTC,"Even better! Let us know if you need some help from our side! If it gets too spammy or people start to hate it we'll let you know to tune it down a little, or to only highlight the not-too-often streaming Yogscasters (i.e. not Pyrion/Strippin).  For now, it's a good idea! If you run into any other issues let me know!"
Yogscast,3d1bye,Diddy_Dan1,35,Sun Jul 12 18:32:15 2015 UTC,Maybe they thought it said Hot tubes?
Yogscast,3d1bye,JJB-125,19,Sun Jul 12 19:16:32 2015 UTC,yeah the dude who said tuveria caliente. I dunno tuveria but tuberia is like pipes or tubes. So yeah they made a hot tube.
Yogscast,3d1bye,Wick_Slilly,6,Sun Jul 12 22:59:28 2015 UTC,I guess spelling it tuveria's probably a dialect thing - it's pronounced the same.
Yogscast,3d1bye,Reecer6,4,Mon Jul 13 04:20:36 2015 UTC,"Would make sense that they wouldn't know what a hot tub is. From what I've heard, Spanish climate is not exactly cold. So they would probably have never had the necessity for hot tubs historically.  I mean, I come from a temperate country and had never even heard of hot tubs until I encountered the term being used by the Yogs. Maybe Jacuzzi would be recognized more internationally."

Yogscast,3cxt7u,shaql,2,Sun Jul 12 06:31:23 2015 UTC,"I really didn't want to make it feel ""over the top"" or ""overwhelming"". It started as our test build map to build a village based after /u/sjin inspired/instructed buildings on an awesome island seed we found. I was told to build on it in exchange for hosting the server. I remade most things and created a story. I also did a METRIC TON of redstone work but tried to hide it so it wouldn't take away from the story. Even the story is based on Minecraft and I think gives the game a better ending story than the one in the game already. I wanted to do justice by both the Minecraft and Yogscast ways. I learned a lot in creating this and I hope you have fun playing it!"

I once got the subject ""Hype Train"", which is a bit of an abstract concept to begin with. After all but four players quit immediately, I built a steam train pulling two open carriages. Inside the carriages were an E and a 3, since E3 was just starting around that time. Two of the others built normal trains, and the fourth did nothing with their plot at all, but I somehow still came last.  The Ghost (movie) reference was really good considering the time allowed. Unfortunately, the other players would have needed to have been playing with their parents to be able to appreciate it.

Because I doubt they managed to get into there in the first place through the Portal that the FB made, since the clone didn't know where the exit was, and was very far away from it when found.

A very small, but quite vocal group believe some awful rumors about him from years ago and therefore attack even the slightest thing he does.   There are plenty who love Sjin, but if you go in his tags or the main tag you're likely to find hate against him there. Better to find specific blogs that are fans of Sjin so you can avoid all that bizarre craziness."

Yogscast,3cyylg,AwfulWaffleWalker,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:36:48 2015 UTC,They must've been really bad then :/ that sucks.
Yogscast,3cyylg,SnowCone4673,35,Sun Jul 12 05:39:07 2015 UTC,"I've seen all the 'evidence' and it's nonesence. Honestly, it's 100% made up and I'm sure of this. I mean you do know Sjin, even though it's just YouTube, you can see hundreds of hours of him and he doesn't have a bad bone in his body.  Even if what they claimed was true, it's not even that bad once you have perspective. Unfortunately tumblr doesn't have that.   I don't know if not saying what it is that they believe helps or not, because you assume he's Jimmy Saville or something. (They say he messaged fans and flirted) I'll do a quick summary of highlights just so you get a brief perspective.  Recently many Yogs and side-Yogs have deleted their tumblrs because of these people. They have attacked all of them, even Zoey who is golden in their eyes because she's LGBT.  Do you recall when Simon read out  a fan story? Even though it was sweet, non-sexual, and he said he loved it? Apparently that was some massive violation and shaming and guess what, now Simon is gone indefinitely, obviously he's ill, but in no great hurry to come back.   My favourite one was when Hannah was attacked for pretty much nothing, called out for being straight and white and not trans, and then the main protagonist (problematic yogscast) called her 'mayonaise' (a slur against white people). Hannah has been nothing but an ally to all. Same with Kim.  Kim recently got called out in her very supportive and sweet video for saying gay marriage, not marriage. Even though she was talking about gay marriage specifically.  Once Ridge said he didn't understand trans people and now he gets it and said in a statement he appreciates the discussion, tumblr attacked him and he's the devil now apparently.  If you can see that they have reacted irrationally to all those things that occurred in the public eye of the Internet, how can we possibly believe that there is some secret evidence (that we aren't allowed to see) that Sjin did anything?   There is some sort of cult developing, where if you say it's bollocks with dubious proof of anything, then you are calling victims liars. Problematic Yogscast who may or not be the same people as why-sjin-why made up several lies and promises that I've seen already, that they would give proof. All the images Ive seen looks nothing like how sjin writes and are just crappy jokes anyway.  As someone who has been a victim of abuse, I just find what they do disgusting and damaging to real victims.  tL:dR the people who are claiming this are idiots, maybe well intentioned, but pure idiots nonetheless."
Yogscast,3cyylg,Cockwombles,10,Sun Jul 12 06:44:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and they harassed Zoey into crying because of a Trine video from ages ago where she supposedly made jokes about the fat knight guy.  Then when she posted a tearful apology, instead of apologyzing for bullying her, they go ""ooh see, that's how you do it, every yog should take example from her, she's such a nice person to acknowledge her mistakes"".  It's a power fantasy, they go after ""famous"" people, and keep bullying them until they can get them to bow down to them personally, then cheer and congratulate themeselves ""for making the world a better place""."
Yogscast,3cyylg,SpaceShipRat,8,Sun Jul 12 18:57:27 2015 UTC,"I just spent the past hour or so reading through the Problematic Yogscast blog, and literally every single post is just overanalytical, hypersensetive people pulling things out of thin air to be offended about.

You would think that since there are real bigots out there its more reasonable to focus on them instead of someone who supports the same idea as you, but happens to use a different word for it that can maybe be seen trough a twisted microscope as something that could possibly be very mildly unsuitable (in my opinion not even that)."

I understand not wanting to keep it hidden because people might think it is something worse than it actually is but you're really just fueling these rumors and issues by doing so. Let's please just leave this alone out of respect for the Yogs."
Yogscast,3cyylg,FenrisValda,2,Sun Jul 12 13:09:16 2015 UTC,"I personally have a very mixed view of PY. They strike me as well meaning, cover triggers for anyone that does suffer from them and do raise good points from time to time. However, that post they made describing Kim's LGBTQ video as problematic pissed me off no end. At worst there was a minor issue with wording.  There's also that time when Hannah called out the GTA online community for being fairly abusive and quoted something that's a slur against the LGBTQ community, and PY started a witch hunt against her (in their defence, I wrote a post about their actions and they did somewhat rectify their wording and tags for that one).  As for the Sjin issue I genuinely have no idea."
Yogscast,3cyylg,spectrosoldier,5,Sun Jul 12 20:22:12 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything except Ridge was more than him saying he didn't understand trans. He was purposefully disrespectful towards trans fans/friends of his (they were mods and did a lot of art for him iirc). Purposefully misgendering them and refusing to use their preferred name ect. Ridge is the one case where I understood why people were upset because it was incredibly ignorant and disrespectful of him though those that continued after his apology were out of line.   Also saying that the fanfic reading has anything to do with Simon being out it ridiculous. One they were attacking Turps much more than Simon. Two that was six months before Simon had to be hospitalized.  As far as the evidence, that's why I prefer not to even mention what the rumors are since the evidence is so weak and all can be easily faked. Seems more harmful to even say what the rumor is since there's nothing to support it."

Yogscast,3cyylg,KingWithoutBurgers,23,Sun Jul 12 01:36:38 2015 UTC,"tumblr   You've answered your own question. :P  In all honesty, there is a part of tumblr that is largely toxic and full of people insulting and degrading others in this fashion. They are what you might call 'professionally insulted', and spend a lot of time trying to find the 'secret racist/sexist/transgender-ist agenda that all white cis males have deep in their hearts that prevents them from doing or saying anything without insulting and oppressing minority cultures'. sarcasm btw  I wouldn't worry about it. It's unlikely to go any further than their small circle in the tumblr community, and, if it does, it's not likely to hold any gravitas with anyone who actually watches Sjin's content. If it's any reassurance to you, I'm sure they're more disturbed by the tumblr slash-fic community than by this. :P"

And finally, we have Sjin - The guy who keeps all of us calm, makes the food, and is good at being trigger happy, as we've seen in every GTA video ever. Usually he's the nicest and quiet guy most annoying little fucker, bombing his friends in the main channel's videos but I think we all know Sjin has very good common sense, sometimes, and would use the rocket launcher better on the zombies.   Now that I think about it, Turps could be also been in the team, perhaps replacing Sjin? I mean, let's be real, The T has the same description as Sjin... trigger happy, hilarious to watch, calming.

Hannah: She's a badass and pretty good at combat, and though I wouldn't call her the quickest thinker, she can work out pretty cool ways to do things. I don't think she'd betray the group either, leading us to a swift victory depending on where the victory lies (I would never trust her with my Sims though). Panda: Panda would be awesome for sniffing out supplies and shelters. He's also got quite good speed and out of the four I think he'd end up finding the most hidden passageways/secrets for one reason or another, granting us - possibly - with extra food and loot (I'd totally trust Panda with my Sims, too). Strife: He's a thinker, and works things out quick with interesting ideas and solutions to match. I don't think, with Hannah and Strife both on the team, we'd be in much trouble for long. I think he'd come up with some clever weapons too. Toby: for the laughs--not just that but his playing style is swift and, though he might be quite loud and draw more zombies to us, he's got the advantage of youth on his side. He's (most of the time) also a thinker.   But there are advantages to every Yog being on your side/team - Lewis, Sips, Nilesy, Parv, Zoey, Dave and Smith are thinkers. Simon and Zylus go with the flow and have some rather interesting ideas. Duncan comes up with awesome weapons (and, again, is a thinker/doer type). Sjin and Kim are crafty.  Bebop and Ridge find interesting ways of dealing with and avoiding death. Rythian's, again, a type of thinker and seems like one who'd end up finding the correct way outta zombie-infected places, Martyn's adventurous and pretty quick, Strippin's strong, Trott and Ross (and Smith) work well as a team and get things done when putting their minds to it.

I mean if you want to call her GigaEchos, that's fine - quite a few people have been calling her EchoSounds in full, but I think that's a bit redundant, since an echo is a sound in and of itself.

Technically you need both a mechanical license (which gives you the right to record it) and a synchronisation license (which gives you the right to make a derivative product; in this case a video).  An unsigned artist can say ""Yep, do what you want"" though it's best to get this in writing in case they decide to be a dick.  A signed artist can say ""Yep"" but the publisher can say ""Noep"" And the publisher gets their way because they're the ones who are paying the artist, and the studios, and the marketers...   However most people who post covers on Youtube do not have the require licenses and are then infringing on the owners copyright. But! Having the licenses does not prevent the publisher or the artist from being a dick and taking you to court but! You can say that ""I have these licenses, I'm good"". And then you should be good."

All the tinkers tools can be repaired by combining them with their head material in a tool forge in the same way that modifiers are applied. It should use less flint to repair a tool than to remake it.  You can get the vote-sleep functionality by adding the Morpheus mod to the server, provided you're running a forge based pack (which I believe regrowth is).  All Witchery trees can spawn an Ent when chopped down, it's not just a Don't Strave thing. As such, you should be wary when cutting down many Rowan, Alder, or Hawthorn trees in quick succession. That said, the Ent drops a special twig that can be used to convert dirt into clay when upgraded, which is useful to keep you stocked up on Clay Jars for the Witches Oven and Distillery.  The only limit for normal sugar canes is that they're planted on a block adjacent to water. Being on sand doesn't affect their growth, and the myth stems from worldgen sugar cane often being on beaches."

But when it's just them standing there with rocket launchers or throwing  non-stop proxy mines, it starts to get a little repetitive/annoying.  Other than that, the GTA content is awesome.

Yogscast,3cg5xt,TheRealGuy01,-3,Tue Jul 7 21:21:59 2015 UTC,"I guess that flux thing in the deep dark was built by them and it's the next part of this crazy story? It looks like some kind of clone lab, but wtf is it in the deep dark for? (Silly Theory Incoming) Unless.. the death message for being killed by the darkness is something like ''___ Was consumed by the Shadows.'' (I cant remember it exactly.) And what 'big baddie' do we know of that has anything to do with shadows and darkness? (Shadow of) Israphel. Now, granted I made this connection way back in Hole Diggers when I first saw that death message but for the purpose of this story, it could fit in and explain who ''The Master'' actually is. Maybe I'm just thinking too deep into it, but I guess we'll find out next episode. Time to get hype!  And yes, guys, go ahead and downvote cos' I know you don't like these things, just trying to put things together so they make sense. :P"
Yogscast,3cg5xt,OmegaX123,6,Tue Jul 7 18:52:58 2015 UTC,"You need to learn to listen to what people say. You get downvoted for talking about SoI because it's literally almost all you ever talk about, and used to be literally all you ever talked about, even to the point of bringing it up in completely irrelevant contexts. Judging from the number of upvotes I got last time I pointed that out (when I also noted that a lot of other people still want SoI back, or at least want a proper ending, we just don't shoehorn it into every post), I would say that your theory that we 'hate SoI' is not the case.  That said, this time your theory (about Flux Buddies) kind of makes sense, and apparently other people see it too, but I highly doubt that's what's happening."

Just a suggestion, most people will watch whatever you put out; if you put different games out besides Gmod, GTA, and Minecraft, you might get some more revenue from it. Granted, those 3 are the main money makers for the main channel, and it's not a given that other games will give you money. But if you had other games that were successful, it would be possible for YQ3 to theoretically take a small monetary hit, while other things can cover the backend of it.  That or more paid content.

Something big is coming, I feels it in my feels (just watched the Simon getting cryo-frozen episode of Yogslabs last night).  My guess, some new bad guy behind Lalnanable Hector's escape interrupts Simon's return party, opens a flux portal that sucks in the Buddies, Ross gets set on fire, Smiffy falls in a hole, Trott gets tossed into the clouds, Sips and Sjin are being led around in chains by Testificets and Creepers, and everyone gets rounded up and locked in Yogslabs which has been occupied by the aforementioned baddie. Simon and Lewis must then save the day (with 'Minecraft').   Either that or something less plotty involving jaffa cakes."

I'm just hoping we haven't seen the end of semi-scripted Minecraft series coming out of the Yogscast. I recognize that Flux Buddies could go on for quite a while longer, and if Simon does come back I'm hoping for something big to recognize the occasion. Some crazy plot twist just seems like the best thing to do for said occasion."

(Those two are pretty friendly, chill guys, not screamy performers who call for donations every 3 seconds, like some streamers.)  I think they wouldn't mind giving some strategy tips to gear up and maybe get to killing some bosses.  Edit: guys, I'm suggesting this because they were really frustrated and lost at times, not because i want to plug some random streamers I've seen two or three times.

It was supposed to be a multi-view modded Minecraft series where everyone worked together under a weekly mayor, and they built a sort of communal civilization or similar. But, being Yogs, it wasn't that easy, nor that nice. There was plotting, trolling, grouping up and secret bases. It got ... complicated. But I thought it was a ton of fun, and very funny to watch.

It may be worth getting one of the latter set up to boost your mana production, as getting that flugel tiara mentioned last episode will take a truckload of mana - it's a close-to-endgame item in the mod.    A conversion to an inn would suit the old house: if you hollow out the area under the ground floor you'll have a well themed place to keep the old GrowthCraft barrels. It'd also be an idea to move any GrowthCraft crops down next to the botania area where the fenced basement area opens up, to keep the industry together.  If a separate inn is still desired, turning the initial house into a trading post/post office to communicate with other kingdoms would be viable. Giving it it's own storehouse in the fenced area at the bottom of the stairs would assist in handling departing/arriving items and serve as a buffer so that any other prankster kingdoms can't overload your primary storage by sending stacks upon stacks of cobblestone. Having a post office would allow you to call for aid from other sympathetic kingdoms on the servers too, though that may also lead to future developments such as embassies. I reckon embassies would be a good place to put portals between series/kingdoms, somewhat similar to how DWP had a portal hub (and theme park) in the YCP world that was slightly trashed towards the end of Magic Police.    I'd advise emptying out that smeltery in the near future. Whilst they don't technically have a limit to their liquid capacity (though one is intended), it's quite common for the liquids of to make a pillar higher than the smeltery itself. You can automate the extraction with a thermal expansion fluiduct or ender IO fluid conduit from the drain, and a hopper underneath an ingot casting table will automatically pull cooled ingots out. Since fluiducts don't exactly match the theme, it's better suited to a temporary setup between episodes.    Since each block in minecraft is supposedly one cubic metre, one block of gold should weigh about 19 metric tonnes."

Niche because there was a popular desire amongst Kim's fanbase to play games together, which was all well and good, but required people to host skype calls and add people. Teamspeak tied all the loose ends up. We kept it for the Kimmunity mostly because it was a smaller group, and maintaining and moderating small groups is far easier."

I just get too angry about the additude to continue watching."
Yogscast,3c6vd5,Madnessinmind,15,Sun Jul 5 14:31:03 2015 UTC,TotalBiscuit's like marmite.  Every so often I see a video of his and find it thoroughly interesting but most of the time I just find them frustrating as he's centred on one opinion and won't even consider the merits of another.
Yogscast,3c6vd5,Br1ckFuckingMaster,10,Sun Jul 5 18:16:42 2015 UTC,And I said I understand that but there is a way you defend your position. I completely agree it's more in his streams and personal videos the stuff he calls them out for are really small and unessiaary sometimes. Which I totally understand personal preference but he harps on them like they are top priority sometimes and honestly sometime I feel like he gets bogged down In the little things too much. Also I love the Co optional podcast and I don't mind him on that cause it's a debate. I'm more referring to his solo stuff. When he has debates with people I enjoy him.
Yogscast,3c6vd5,Madnessinmind,-6,Sun Jul 5 15:53:58 2015 UTC,"Although It's your opinion and I can't really change that, he often states that this videos are not proper reviews and that it's his opinion on the first few hours of a game. I do hate, though, him getting stupidly angry at fans for no reason and proceeding to insult them for petty things. I really hate that he does that, but he recognizes that problem and I think he's trying to be better."
Yogscast,3c6vd5,Deyerli,19,Sun Jul 5 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"He often states that this videos are not proper reviews and that it's his opinion on the first few hours of a game.    His opinions are half hour video editorials that he will vigorous defend tooth and nail, which have the weight to fracture a game's sales. For as good a mind in gaming that TB has, he's very reckless with wielding his words."
Yogscast,3c6vd5,Chronis67,12,Sun Jul 5 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Despite of what he says about his videos, they have the same or more power as ""proper"" reviews. It's also really hard for him to accept criticisms unless it's spoken by a majority."
Yogscast,3c6vd5,Deyerli,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:49:30 2015 UTC,"Oh I understand that and like I said in another comment I get more angry about how much he gets bogged down In his solo stuff about little things and kind of writes things off based on some little stuff and I just feel like he misses the bigger picture, but that's just my opinion. I don't hate him I just more disagree and while I'm receptive to his viewpoints and agree with some things. I just prefer when he discusses bigger picture and delves into that and the amount of time he spends on he tiny subjects is aggrivating to me. So I really don't watch much anymore. I don't even get mad at his reactions to fans cause some people are really horrible to him."
