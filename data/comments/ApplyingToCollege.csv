Your grades are your grades. They are not devalued because of where you come from.   Everyone is correct. They will look at your application holistically according to you. For instance, if your school does not offer AP, the admissions process will not use that against you because you didn't have the same opportunity. Usually a school counselor will send a school profile so they will understand your background.   When I did mock applications with the UChicago admissions staff, they usually denied a student if it seemed like they didn't challenge themselves or succeed academically within THEIR OWN environment.

ApplyingToCollege,3e4jir,IntheSarlaccsbelly,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:05:28 2015 UTC,"""Asian"" isn't a cultural monolith. There's a difference, when you're discussing underrepresented groups or the cultural background a student brings to a campus, between Chinese Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Cambodian Americans, and so forth.   Nearly everyone who practices holistic admissions (including the schools that are legally prohibited from formally considering race) is deliberately trying to put together a multi-cultural community, and if you are applying to a school where your particular perspective isn't well represented, be it racial or first-gen or the state you live in, then you'll be at a disadvantage because the potential voice you bring to their campus is one they'd like to see more of.  I'll speak in generalizations here, which I know aren't 100% accurate, but they do reflect actual realities in highly selection admissions pools. For applicants who fall into demographics that are over-represented on particular (within the Asia American group, this is primarily Indian, Chinese, and Korean Americans), the challenge is less that being 'Asian' is a strike against you and more that the cultural background tends to lead to a clustering of applicants into familiar tropes.  Indian American applicants, as an example, disproportionately apply looking to study premed or biology. If you're a typical college, you've got dozens of majors you need to fill and cannot admit a class that disproportionately wants to study just one thing. It creates a ton of problems, not just because you've got majors that have no students now, but because there won't be enough spots in biology labs to accommodate the massive influx of students who want to study biology. This is, obviously, a deliberate simplification, but it's an instructive one. For better or worse, the cultural pressures that many students are under, most especially when parents are immigrants to the US, lead to students making choices that ultimately look and feel very similar to many other students from that same cultural background. That makes it harder to distinguish between those students, which in turn disadvantages them at the most selective and most 'holistic' admissions processes. This isn't fair. Or, at least, I think it isn't fair. But, for the AOs reading and selecting applicants, it doesn't feel like there's really another choice.    Being Asian doesn't hurt you. Being Asian and having an application that is reminiscent of the Asian stereotypes that admissions officers have... that does hurt you."

What matters is that you fulfill the premed requirements, you keep your GPA up, do well on the MCATs, and write a good personal statement.

Most of my out-of-class studying for the SAT's (since two were similar to AP courses and the third was stuff I was learning that year and previous years) was mostly in the days leading up to the test, when I did some practice questions, then some studying in crash course books on chemistry and more math practice questions.  Don't worry too much about Math (which I assume you'll be taking, but correct me if I'm wrong) because the Math II test has an extremely generous curve that makes a high score a foregone conclusion.

If you're taking an honors course in multivariable calculus or advanced computer programming, that says more than AP Environmental Science or AP Art History - but if you take AP Physics and AP Spanish Literature and get good grades in the class, that probably outweighs most honors classes. Anyways, a lot of the top schools do their own ranking system that replaces the AP/Honors/Regular labels with their own native system, so it's a matter of what you learn instead.  Since a large portion of the AP class' meaning comes from the AP Test, you might want to consider taking the classes in order to get credit at whatever college you get into, although the test scores themselves rarely make a substantial difference in your application."

While I regret not having joined earlier, I have it on my resume for junior and senior year, which should be good.  Even if you don't join any big (or small) clubs next year, or if you don't sign up for sports or academic teams, you still have the summer after junior year to do some sort of summer job.

ApplyingToCollege,3e0fo9,AznKwokBoi,2,Tue Jul 21 02:46:41 2015 UTC,"You are not screwed,  you still have two years to join clubs, but you will be screwed out of a UC if you don't join any this year and next.  I graduated High School a couple months with above average grades, but not amazing. (2010 on SAT, 3.6 GPA, 4 on AP English Lit/English Lang/US Hist/Bio/Macroecon, and 5 on Microecon). The only UC I got into was UCR, which is where I am going. (IMO that's not a bad thing, I'm happy with UCR despite the reputation it has). Not waitlisted to any other UCs. I applied to Irvine, SD, LA, and Berkeley.  A very close friend of mine had very similar grades, just slightly better (2030 SAT, 3.6 or 3.7 GPA not entirely sure, same AP scores as me except he took AP gov instead of both econs and got a 4, he also got a 5 on US History). He got waitlisted and got through the waitlist for UCSD, he ended up going to Cal Poly Pomona because money, but that's a different issue. So admittedly those better grades definitely helped, but what was a bigger factor was the fact he was in Key Club Cabinet and in Leadership for our schools Future Healthcare Professionals club. I was only in Key Club and just as a member, not leadership.   Also, for what it's worth sports/athletics have a big impact, especially if your Varsity. I watched several people who did worse than me academically but were involved in ASB and varsity sports get straight up accepted into LA and Berkeley, not even just waitlisted. I mean, at my school the top jocks and the people in ASB were not dumb, they were all in several APs, but not as much as me and they did not do as well in them as I did.  I am not trying to scare you out of applying, I am just telling you the reality of what I experienced. I will throw in that I attended one of the top schools in CA. Honestly colleges know that and weigh it against you if it's the case. When you're at a top school they want you to have all the grades and extracurriculars. If you're at some inner-city school you don't need as good grades or have as much extracurriculars to get accepted.   All that being said, to answer your question more directly, I don't think you are screwed if you really try the next two years. And then when you do apply, embellish whatever role you did have to make is sound more important. Honestly if you are really clever you can make a regular membership position sound like leadership on college apps without technically lying.  (last paragraph, I swear) Most importantly though, don't stress too much about college. I know a lot of people say what college you go to isn't as important as a lot of high schoolers think it is, and hardly any high schooler believes it. But honestly, it's true. Yes a ""better"" school can help you get a ""better"" job. But ""can help you"" is not a guarantee. And even if going to a ""worse"" school actually ended up giving you a ""worse"" job/position in a company, doesn't mean you can't be just as happy in life. At my school no one seemed to believe this as the truth when applying to schools, and sacrificed their social life and high school experience just because they wanted the top schools. But now that it's all over, a lot of them are realizing that college is not as huge a deal as they thought, even the ones that got into some of the top schools. Anyways, this last paragraph has been mostly just my two cents, but the rest of it is just facts of what I witnessed. Sorry for rambling, hope this helps in some way."

I think if you take the advanced computer science class and do well in it, the college will appreciate it way more.

ApplyingToCollege,3dvc2c,a-real-class-act,2,Mon Jul 20 00:12:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you.   OK, so these are my first impressions from reading your essay:   You have a lovely writing style overall; I have no complaints about your grammar, spelling, or sentence structure. Your essay is strongest when you are describing, but begins to falter when you attempt to relate the descriptions to your message (and yourself), and completely fizzles by the end. As /u/Creepthan_Frome said, you have a tendency to tell rather than show, and I think this leads to a lot of missed opportunities as far as the narrative is concerned.   It's great that you have such evocative descriptions of the flowers, but you need to be able to integrate yourself into the entire essay, rather than compressing your dandelion-love into two sentences at the end. You are the only expert on yourself, so it's up to you how you want to go about this.  The Common App prompts are meant to draw out the individual in the essay. Two prompts stuck out to me that could be applied to your topic:    The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?   This could relate to you attempting to be an ""iris"" and failing, leading you to reflect and then become a ""dandelion.""    Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family.   In this case, the ""iris vs. dandelion"" dichotomy could take on other meanings of self-realization and rebelling against your community's expectations.   While your budding essay may be unpolished at the moment, I know it will bloom beautifully in the end! Good luck!"

India is a slightly different story than the UK because the population of India combined with the larger percentage of students who would like to go to the US means there's often a broader assortment of students for schools to pick from. Also, Indian students, traditionally, cluster into a much more narrow set of academic interests than students coming from the UK.

Unfortunately, the arts are not my area of expertise, but I do have some general advice.   Since you want to go into graphic design, I should forewarn you that there are a number of (mostly for-profit) colleges out there that will basically scam you. They entice low-performing students with easy admissions requirements, and then fail to educate them in how to function in the modern industry. In a field such as graphic design, which is rapidly evolving, it is especially dangerous to go to a school with an outdated and insufficient curriculum. Do thorough research on job preparation and outcomes before applying.   To be quite honest, with a GPA that low, you should strongly consider going to community college (to save money, get your grades up, and get prereqs out of the way) and then transferring. You also need time to build your portfolio, which is required for pretty much any arts program at any school, college, or university.   Also, you should have a realistic idea of how much money you expect to be able to make once you get out of college. If you go to an expensive private out-of-state school for a graphic design degree, you'll be paying off an enormous debt for at least 10 years. State schools are more accustomed to accepting community college students, and if you're in-state then you will get cheaper tuition and the possibility of financial aid. (While in school, I would also look into minoring in business just to ""cover your bases"" - part of being a successful graphic artist is knowing how to market yourself.)"

ApplyingToCollege,3dowm9,nobuyer,2,Sat Jul 18 01:27:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what your question is? Are you asking us how many high school students do research (at a lab) before applying to college?  The answer - enough that doing research makes no one special in and of itself. Anyone can get a gig cleaning beakers and fetching coffee at a family friend's lab. However, doing research (especially if you contribute novel ideas and skillful work) can give you an edge in, say, prestigious science fairs such as Intel or Siemens - which, to answer your question, does look good on college apps.  In addition, some research internships, such as RSI and SIMR, are selective enough that most people have a higher chance being admitted to the program's host institution than to the actual program itself (though from what I hear, there's still a fair amount of nepotism that goes on - but I digress.)  Overall though, I wouldn't recommend considering research or college applications as a numbers game where the more people who do X, the less meaningful X is. Plenty of people can do research, but not everyone does it well enough that it attracts attention from adcoms."

I learned all of the additional material on my own using a review book about a month before the test, and I managed to get an 800. If you're willing to put the time in, and you feel comfortable with what you learned from physics 1, you might as well study now while you're on summer break. There isn't a whole lot of material from physics 2 on the test, and what is on there is fairly fundamental. You might consider getting a review book (Princeton review is pretty good) going through what you haven't learned and taking a practice exam. If you're pretty close to your goal, I would say keep studying and take the exam. If you're a ways off, you might wait until you've been in physics 2 for a while and then try again. Hopefully that helps! Good luck!"

But then again, if they did divide physics into two separate tests, it would probably be similar to the math tests, where the first test would not count for much to college. Then you would have to take the second physics test which would be all physics 2 for scores to mean anything.

I do agree that to have concepts from physics 2 in the subject tests is a little unfair, especially for students who don't have the opportunity or time to learn the material. While I don't think making two separate tests would make anything better, as colleges would probably only take the second test like math, I do think there should be changes. There definitely should be less physics 2 material (if any at all). On the bright side though, the majority of the test is physics 1. Plus the materials from physics 2 that they do put in test are not too difficult. They don't go too deep into those subjects, rather they ask very fundamental questions about the subjects. I had to do very little if any math on the subject test for the physics 2 problems. If you have a decent grasp on physics and the concepts from physics 1, with a little bit of studying and some practice, you should do fine.

That being said, I rarely get answers on the ""chance me"" thread, so here goes:   Six years of chess looks pretty good. I know someone who played chess competitively, and he's going to a top-ranked school now. Depending on how long you've done it, your volunteering at the physical therapy office could be seen as holding a steady job with a valuable learning experience attached. Your class rank is pretty good, but you have time to improve just in case.  Your AP scores leave a bit to be desired, although a 3 on Chem isn't bad (speaking from experience, it takes months of drudgery and hard work and sleep deprivation to get a safe 5 there). The scores themselves don't really matter until you get into college, at which point they're used for placement, but your class grades matter. Since you got a B in AP Chem, I'd say you're good there. If your ""helping the homeless"" club actually does stuff as a group that someone can't do on their own, then it could be something you can write about. I don't mean to sound suspicious, but at my school a lot of people have clubs like this that don't do anything of substance (i.e. a ""send water wells to africa"" club that meets three times a year, a Model UN knockoff that didn't make it fifteen minutes before getting shot down, etc) Since you're taking several AP classes next year (including AB Calc) it implies that you'll be taking either BC calculus or some form of Multivariable calculus in senior year (or AP Stat if it's offered). The same applies to Physics, since if you like it there's a possibility you'd be taking more AP Physics classes/tests next year.

If you rush into choosing a major just because you want to have one at the time you enroll, I can all but guarantee you it will change at least once before you graduate (again, that's a good thing).   Since you're really undecided on a major, it may actually be best for you to enter college as an ""exploratory"" student (that's the term many of us schools now use instead of undecided/undeclared). Look for schools that offer a wide variety of majors, that way you will have plenty to choose from. Check our their advising programs as well, as that will be a huge asset to take advantage of.

As per what someone pointed out elsewhere in this thread, she fills up all her slots way before senior year begins. So if you're planning on getting a counselor, you should do it this year, not after your senior year has begun. The better a counselor is, the more likely she is to be have a full slate by then.  That said, you don't necessarily need a counselor... there are a lot of things juniors should be doing and thinking about, but many of them don't require a counselor's help. As a junior, you should focus on kicking ass on all your standardized testing (and making sure you're taking the tests you need to take, e.g. SAT Subject Tests), building a strong, realistic list of colleges, visiting those colleges if you can (if you can't, it's not the end of the world), and challenging yourself academically (remember: a B in an AP class is better than an A in a non-AP class).  Your high school counselors might be a good resource, but take everything they say with a grain of salt. Their job description is much broader than just helping kids get into college, so many of them don't know as much as they should about admissions. It's so complicated and so competitive that it takes a lot of time and energy to stay on top of all the information and trends, which is why private counselors exist in the first place. Also, their workload is usually MUCH higher than a private counselor's (take the number of kids in your school and divide it by the number of counselors employed at your school, and you'll see what I mean). I can't stress that enough: verify any important information your school counselor gives you. I've seen kids get completely screwed over by a well-meaning school counselor who, for instance, confused UC requirements with the requirements of a private college. We had one counselor advise an entire student body that a single semester of foreign language was enough, simply because their Spanish 101 class somehow fulfilled the two-year UC language requirement. Guess what? All of the kids who heeded this counselor's advice were excluded from the non-UC schools on their list. They needed at least two ""real"" years of foreign language, and many colleges want to see three or four.  One more thing: don't forget to have fun this year! You're going to be an upperclassman, dammit! You'll never be this age again, and you'll often look back on it and wish you could revisit it.

They upload information to Naviance, write letters of recommendation to colleges on a student's behalf, all the while helping with course selection. We don't get a choice in who they are, and we have them for all four years. What is your definition of a college counselor? A private ""tutor""?  Anyways, junior year is a good time to start worrying about colleges, so depending on the duties of your counselor it could be really helpful. If he/she is just there to work on improving your college applications, then wait until the summer after junior year because you really won't be working on them before then.

Honestly, the difference between the two SATs are almost like the difference between the SAT and ACT, and it's always beneficial to take both and see which you do better on. Granted, if you take the new SAT and do worse, you won't be able to retake the old SAT, but at least you'll have that old SAT score if you do happen to do well."

The new PSAT is similar to the current ACT. So study for the ACT, take the October PSAT, the December ACT, and another ACT if you aren't happy with the December ACT score.  EDIT: Here's one source that has a similar study plan: https://www.higherscorestestprep.com/the-new-psat-what-the-class-of-2017-needs-to-know-episode-54/ (although she recommends September and October ACT).

Obviously, if you're aiming to get into what's considered one of the top schools in the world for math and science, you're gonna have to improve in more areas than just school work and GPA and test scores. Things like essays, volunteer work, leadership, etc. are (I assume) probably gonna be some important things for them to consider, so maybe try to work on those? Make your application one that they'll remember, because that's the way you get into these big schools.  I'm not saying you're not on the right track, you've got scores that definitely are competitive for some real nice schools. You just have to be really all-around to impress some schools.  That being said, if you ever find yourself deciding on other schools like NC state or VT, you'd probably have a decent chance for those. You probably wouldn't have to do as much, especially since it's your senior year. From what I know, senior year obviously matters to some degree, but it's not as important as junior year, as junior year was the last full year that the colleges will see when they decide admissions. You're only gonna send in half of what you did for senior year to them for them to decide.  I see you've taken Calc AB. Have you considered taking BC? I took a similar path as you there, I took calc AB junior year, got a 5, then took BC senior year and also got a 5. Also, see if it's possible for you to get into some leadership position, like for the clubs you're in or something. That'll definitely help by showing you have experience being a leader.  I'll end by saying that if you have any specific questions about Virginia Tech I'd be more than happy to answer, as I'm a current student there.

Taking it this year. Third level of programming for people who already completed APCS and want to take more for giggles. My school offers three levels - I skipped the first, and took the second level (which taught the APCS curriculum) and am going to take the third this year.   Extracurriculars:   Possible member of the school's Zero Robotics team (uncertain because there are other kids who are as good/are better at physics than I) which will program the software for a robot in a contest hosted in Lower Earth Orbit, sponsored by MIT and the ESA/ISS. Secretary of the Asian-American Club. Nothing big here, folks, just food and movies once or twice a month. Member of the Science, English, and History Honors Societies.

But here is the rundown of my current application ranks so you guys could help me see if I have an honest chance of getting in.  My Stats:   GPA: 3.38 (Advisor said 3.0 minimum to get in but avg of candidates is 3.4-3.5) All A's and B's for my four years in undergrad. Only 1 C in a low level Chemistry class (Heard they dont look at that anyway) Deans list 3 semesters 2 of which were my last two semesters of my senior year   And an overall rundown of the program requirements:   50 students admitted each Fall. (2013-2014 school year 129 applied, 53 got in) Also needed is a personal essay, GRE (no minimum score), 3 letters of recommendation, and optional volunteer hours They look at overall science GPA more than overall undergrad GPA (which i guess is a good thing for me as my high grades came my last two years) They also look at your upper division GPA (your 3000-4000 level classes all of which are A's and B's for me)   The full requirements etc. can be seen here: https://portal.otcas.org/otcasHelpPages/participating-programs/florida-international-university/index.html  So with everything said, despite a low GPA from my freshman/sophmore year, I feel that my upper division science courses all of which I had A's and B's saved my butt.  WHAT IM WORRIED ABOUT: is that the actual prerequisite classes for OT (11 classes including labs) are mostly B's. Most of my A's from my upper division undergrad courses are from my undergrad major (Psychology). Of the 11 OT pre-req courses 7 are B's and 4 are A's and of THOSE four, 2 are labs.  Then theres the GRE. Im planning on taking it in October. FIU requires no minimum score. So I just have to take it but obviously a higher score the better so factor that into my chances.  And volunteering IS NOT mandatory but also can very well help. I am volunteering at a hospital in the therapy department which I think looks good so I am planning to rack up the hours.  If you guys could help it would be much appreciated. What are my honest chances and what can I do to make my application stand out?  (This post formatting is all over the place so ask any questions and ill be free to clarify)"

I'm currently in the process of drafting my personal statements to apply early to some schools in the fall. I'm really having difficulties with figuring out what to write though. I have pretty generic extra curriculars, come from an overrepresented area, and haven't really had to go through many legitimate  struggles. How do I set myself apart from the other applicants, all while keeping a genuine tone?  Also, what is your opinion on hiring a private college counselor? Are the big consultants who charge hundreds or thousands of dollars worth it, or is it better to save the money and ask an English teacher to look over grammatical mistakes?  Thanks again!"
ApplyingToCollege,3d2dji,WorldsMania,3,Mon Jul 13 01:27:10 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the extracurriculars being ""generic,"" or lack of hardships you may have faced.  The goal of your essay should simply be to engage the reader, to make yourself stand out, and to make him or her want to meet you. The best way to do this is by telling a story. The story does not have to be an earth-shattering tale of pulling a child from a burning building or climbing Mount Everest.  Some of the best essays cover seemingly boring events that were important to the applicant. Make sure your story is detail-rich. Include colorful anecdotes, talk about your thoughts, and connect your essay to your dreams and who you are as a person.  tl;dr Show, don't tell.  Hiring a private college counselor - some of the big expensive consultants are worth it, some aren't. Do your research and make sure to ""interview"" anyone you consider hiring. If money's an issue, don't feel bad about not being able to hire someone. Just be sure to have mentors (like teachers) review your essay so they can give you feedback (not just on grammar, but also on choice of words, flow, tone, content, etc.)  Hope this helps!"

ApplyingToCollege,3d2dji,LegendaryGinger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:27:13 2015 UTC,"Hi Steve thanks for everything you've done here!  I'm considering two topics to right about for my Essay and I can't really decide which I think is better.  My first option is an essay centered around my hair. Wow, I'm realizing just now that with this username I look very strange, but to be fair my hair has created a big part of who I am and that's why I'm thinking about writing about it! So as you've assumed it is red, but not your typical carrot top orange more like a deep auburn to give you some idea. I would talk about some minor harassment in middle school I went through, and would mention the South Park episode ""Gingers have no souls"", but would say that I haven't exactly been subjected to the nadir of societal oppression to look self aware. Instead I would say that is has simply made me more open minded and that I try to support people who get picked on for being/doing something different. I've learned to be comfortable with my own body and be accepting of others.  My other essay topic would be about yoyoing. Yes that is not a typo. I'm a semi-professional yoyoer of sorts and you can obviously see why I am considering writing about this; it's unique and sets me apart. I don't know exactly how this essay would be structured, but I would probably go with similar themes as my other topic such as being yourself, not caring what other people think, pursuing your interests, all while being sociable. The hook here is that while going through applications, the council or whatever might remember me as ""the yoyo kid"". The downside to this essay is that I lack any real substantial evidence as to the importance of this in my life. I just recently started a youtube channel and I will be going to my first contest in August (I'm super excited for that).  The feeling I'm getting is that Essay 1: Possibly vain, doesn't make me stand out with any accomplishments or skills everybody has hair, but it will give a better insight as to who I am as a person.  Essay 2: Makes me stand out, but seems kind of gimmicky. I don't know the exact way to go about writing this. Is yoyoing that impressive really? (I'll submit a video in the application if there is space) Here is the only one I've made as of yet if you are curious.   My top school choices are Duke and Vandy, on paper I'm an iffy candidate low GPA: about 3.70, unweighted, but decent test scores 2290 SAT.

It seems like more of a unique ""hook,"" something that will be more memorable, i.e., ""the yoyo kid.""  Yes, it is impressive, given that most people can't do anything more than get the yoyo up and down. Creates the ""how does he/she do that?"" superstar effect.  The video and contest are enough to indicate importance/uniqueness. I suspect you have the potential to write a killer essay and am excited about it!"

ApplyingToCollege,3d2dji,Impluere,2,Mon Jul 13 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree with Steve about the hair essay. I used to read that topic more than you'd guess, and it was very rarely executed in a way that actually landed well. It could work, but it almost never actually does.   I'd say you're reversing the order of what you ought to be looking for to find a good essay. As it stands, you're trying to find topics (Hair, Yoyo) and then trying to figure out what message you need to give those topics to make them work. It's the approach lots of students use, but it's usually the wrong way to go about this. What you want to do, first, is to figure out what you want someone to know about you. What's the message you want to convey, then, once you have that, you look for the topic that allows you to communicate that idea.  My guess is that whatever your message is, whatever that really important part of you that you want to share is, yoyoing somehow connects back to it, and so it would still be a great choice. But figuring out what you want to say about yourself first will give you a better framework for how to write the yoyo essay (if that's the topic you want to go with).  Vandy in ED, and assuming you don't have red flags, you'll have a good shot.   Also, that video is fucking ace, man. Amazing."

I was thinking about writing about this one time I remotely guided my non-techie brother through restoring my computer from a backup drive using unix dd after he foobar'd it with a virus. I'd want to get technical here, with the commands I used for troubleshooting and ultimately solving the problem, to show how I can actually use my skills in practice.  But I also have a neat story about learning how to make awesome focaccia from a roommate I met on a research internship. It's a heartrending tale of culinary mastery, multiculturalism, and everlasting friendship (or at least I like to think it is).

To me, this sounds like a much better topic that would allow you to include colorful anecdotes, talk about your thoughts and emotions, and connect your essay to your dreams and who you are as a person. It's a better opportunity to make them like you.  I'd save the technical stuff for other parts of the application. I'm not a techie myself and don't know if you use github, but if you're able, maybe put together some kind of ""portfolio"" / github account that can showcase your talents. (Github actually has something called Showcase, btw.)  I'd just save the code for somewhere else besides the essay.

ApplyingToCollege,3d3gm0,sweetcharge,3,Mon Jul 13 05:33:11 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, Software Engineering is mainly about developing and maintaining software, whereas Computer Science is more theoretical and talks about algorithms and computation (which then goes on to data analysis, information theory, etc.) Both require classes in maths and the sciences.  What I'm confused is why you would prefer to take Software Engineering over Computer Science. Software Engineering is usually considered a branch / application of Computer Science and a major on its own is less common. Also, if you're more familiar with maths than developing software, Computer Science would be a easier topic to transition. (Don't think you need to learn too much physics, unless you're going to take game design, which in that case you will need to invest your life into physics.)"
ApplyingToCollege,3d3gm0,potato_from_latvia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:36:39 2015 UTC,"CS is more theoretical, but isn't applied that way.  ~90% of people in software have degrees in CS.  From a company's perspective the two degrees are almost identical, but the education software engineers get is more oriented towards engineering, as in applying existing methods to create reliable solutions.  Computer science degrees are more focused on creating new and innovative solutions.  Although it almost never works out like this (99% of your worth for a position in software is what you've done, not your education), a company might want a software engineer to ensure that their servers are up all the time and grow as necessary to accommodate demand while wanting someone with a degree in CS to develop the applications for their specific use-case that would run on the servers.  SE is more oriented towards software development and distribution methods, whereas CS focuses more on algorithms, networks, and artificial intelligence inside the software.  Both have some actual software engineering (the design and implementation of software) and require calculus and probability courses.  I believe SE's can take any of biology, chemistry, or physics, while physics is a requirement for CS.  But, in the real world the degrees are practically identical, you'll almost never see a job that requires one over the other.  CS graduates are just as capable of developing reliable applications as SE's, and SE's are just as capable of OOP as CS's are.  Regardless, what types of software development have you tried?  If you haven't tried any, you really should.  Software engineers (with both types of degrees) almost as a rule love what they do, they tend to write code in their free time after their day jobs.  You pretty much either love it or hate it, so you have to try it before making a decision.  I suggest you start with JavaScript (which is not Java), and then if you like coding the web continue from there and definitely go with CS.  If you don't, you can try something like Node.js (JavaScript that runs outside of the browser) or Python.  If of those you like the lower-level stuff such as streams, file I/O, etc. buy an Arduino or Raspberry Pi and try programming physical devices.  If you like the structure of software over the data and experimentation, then SE could be the way to go.  If you like controlling the actual device, then you might want to consider a degree in computer engineering which dips into electrical engineering."

No. But you can still go to a 4-year college. I would mainly look at in-state schools that have higher acceptance rates (and maybe OOS schools that have high acceptance rates).   Don't solely rely on your background to get you into school; it'll help but it won't magically get you into a top school. Also, that's a lot to write about for a short essay (most schools have a max cutoff of 800 words or less...common app is 650).   Your SAT score is good, so that will help. Your main issue is your GPA. Do explain your depression in your applications because colleges like to know of extenuating circumstances.  What are you wanting to major in? What schools are you considering right now? Just because you won't be able to get into a top-ranking school doesn't mean you can't go to a good school.  Also consider community college as a fallback. There's nothing wrong with going to a CC for the first two years, doing well, and then applying to more competitive schools than what you could probably currently get into.

Definitely be sure to consider the financial aspects of college too, as going out of state can be expensive and you aren't too competitive for many merit scholarships that most schools offer. If you'll need need-based aid, apply to schools that will meet 100% of your need. I know Boulder is a very expensive school (for OOS) that doesn't give a ton of aid. And since you're wanting to go to med school, definitely go to wherever will be cheapest (because the ranking of your undergrad school really doesn't matter to med schools).   You need to add some more safeties to your list.

The geographic location is kind of open, I do live on the east coast so I will probably end up somewhat close. As for major I am certainly not set in stone but I am interested in psychology, education, and maybe philosophy. One of the main things I am looking for is an environment in which people are passionate about learning and discussion, not really sure how to find that or if that is realistic."
ApplyingToCollege,3cxc8g,a-real-class-act,2,Sat Jul 11 17:00:31 2015 UTC,"FYI, if you are looking to major in education, then Clark University is an excellent choice, and not as difficult to get into as some other top liberal arts schools.   One unique East-coast I heard about was Juniata College - it's in the middle of Nowhere, PA, but all students there craft their own ""programs of emphasis"" instead of majors. Hampshire College has a similar concept (in addition to having narrative evaluations instead of grades), and is closer to town.   If you are willing to travel, you may want to consider Reed College in Portland, OR. It's set in a great location and the students are very devoted to learning."

ApplyingToCollege,3cxc8g,c-maz,2,Sat Jul 11 23:59:27 2015 UTC,"I'm also looking mostly at liberal arts colleges, here's a quick list of the ones I've visited so far.   Oberlin University (OH) - I really liked Oberlin. Very pretty campus, although it is in the middle-of-nowhere, Ohio, and it was pretty much a frozen waste when I went in January. Seemed very academically rigorous and like the students had great relationships with professors. They also have an amazing conservatory and a pretty big music scene on campus, which appealed to me.  Beloit College (WI) - Not my favorite. The academics didn't seem very challenging, although I liked that they place a lot of emphasis on one-on-one mentorship. Something like 60% of students are in a fraternity or sorority, and there seemed to be some tension between the college and the surrounding community, so I the campus environment didn't really appeal to me. Also, the buildings seems kind of old/run down.  That said, I know people who visited/go to Beloit who really like it there, and they apparently have an excellent anthropology program. Lawrence University (WI) - I liked the academics at Lawrence; they seemed generally challenging and heavily discussion-based. Like Oberlin they have a well-respected conservatory. The city of Appleton where Lawrence is located has about 72,000 people, so it's a lot less rural than many other colleges. Although I liked Lawrence, the students there seemed kind of lukewarm about the school and not overly enthusiastic about going there (but maybe I was expecting too much). Ripon College (WI) - This was the smallest college I've looked at so far, only about 900 students. The campus was soooo pretty and everyone I met was really nice. I didn't like that because it is so small the majors are somewhat limited, and the classes I looked in on seemed very akin to high school classes- a lot of sitting in rows looking at power points.   Like others have said, there are an overwhelming number of liberal arts colleges, so definitely try to narrow it down by major, size, location, etc. This website has pretty informative articles about many colleges, and this is a great tool for narrowing down your options."

ApplyingToCollege,3cvm9w,AznPandaEatsRice,2,Sat Jul 11 03:43:07 2015 UTC,"From their website:   If a high school student takes a UC-transferable course at a college/university and lists it on their UC application, will the grade earned in the course be included in their GPA, even if it is not listed on their high school transcript?  Students must report all enrollment and academic coursework. If the course the student took is in an ""a-g"" subject area, the grade will be calculated in the GPA, and if the course is transferable, it will earn an extra grade point and college credit. Upon admission to UC, the student will be required to submit an official transcript from the college/university in addition to their high school transcript.   So I assume the B will be calculated the same way as any other grade."
ApplyingToCollege,3cvm9w,a-real-class-act,2,Sat Jul 11 05:42:39 2015 UTC,"I was in the exact same boat as you and got a B in a CC course my senior year.

However, you should look at what fields are connected to finance. What skills will I need to develop to succeed in a finance-related field? Many students like you look for ECs like DECA, math tutoring, and school leadership (like class cabinet), the latter of which is especially good because it has that ""leadership"" quality your schools of choice claim to like so much.   However, volunteering doesn't have to be as specifically finance-related. Diverse interests look good on an application and tell officers that you aren't a number-crunching drone. For instance, you could find ways to work on fundraisers, organizations to help the underprivileged, etc. If you have a particular passion that you like pursuing outside of school, you can do some volunteering related to that.   Schools are used to incoming students changing their minds, so they don't expect you to have your entire career trajectory plotted by the time you're 18. What's really important about ECs and volunteering isn't showing them how excited you are about finance, but demonstrating the skills and personal qualities that make you a qualified applicant."

ApplyingToCollege,3cubty,Sgopal2,4,Fri Jul 10 23:09:23 2015 UTC,If you retake does it erase the previous grade? Or does the new grade get averaged in with the old?
ApplyingToCollege,3cubty,IntheSarlaccsbelly,3,Sat Jul 11 01:39:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure. My parents and college counselor and friends are all convinced that it would erase my previous grade. But then I'm not sure how it would show up on my transcript, would the calc class just be taken off my junior year? Would the A replace the D+? Do they even organize it by which year you took classes?"
ApplyingToCollege,3cubty,Sgopal2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:45:31 2015 UTC,"This would be very unusual. More unusual, still, would be to have the grade replaced before you finish retaking the class.  You really should double-check this.   My best guess, after having reviewed thousands of transcripts, is that this D+ will sit on your transcript at least for this year. Depending on what your aspirations are, and how important it is to go to particular schools, you may want to sit this year out and apply after you graduate with your full record in order to balance out the D+ as much as possible. There are lots of schools where you'll be an insta-deny when they see a D in junior year. If there's a way to remove or improve (through grade averaging) that D+, I'd prioritize that over taking BC Calc. It sounds like your dad doesn't want to face the reality that your grade will change your college options. It will. That doesn't mean there aren't good schools that will be happy to have you, but it does mean that you need to create a list very differently than you would have otherwise.  There's a lot of stuff you don't mention which might have bearing - like, what were your other grades? What kinds of schools are you thinking of applying you? Are you planning to study STEM disciplines in college?   BC Calc is also a LOT harder than AB. It's worth considering the potential that the B you were on track for in AP Calc might translate to a B- or C+ in BC. Then you'd have a D+ in AB and a C+ in BC... It's not a promising combination."

ApplyingToCollege,3cubty,Dragonethan,2,Sun Jul 12 01:51:24 2015 UTC,"I'm no authority, but I'd take the BC class. You seem really confident that you would do well, you got a 4 on the exam, and would retaking it really completely replace the D+? Wouldn't the transcript just show both years? As for early action, I believe colleges encourage you not to reapply unless there's really a difference that you think is enough to push your application past the hump, so to speak.  Btw, fuck what your friends think and how weird you will feel, tbh. Scheduling always gets mixed up and classes are never 100% normal. My school teaches APUSH in two full years. I took the first half but for the second would have had to drop either Latin or French and I absolutely refused. So I switched it for World History AP and that became my favorite class this past year. It was full of really laidback and nice seniors, unlike my stressful APUSH class full of all the egoist geniuses in my grade. Now I'm taking APUSH 2 as a senior in a class full of juniors I don't know. Shit happens, but think beyond this year when you think about your schedule. Long term, you know? If you retake it, you will feel weird and you won't like it. But if you decide it's what's best for you, then you should do that."
ApplyingToCollege,3cteko,stateschooltransfer,3,Fri Jul 10 16:59:50 2015 UTC,Is there a huge difference in the quality of education from a state school to a nationally recognized school? Is it worth the additional $$$ ?
ApplyingToCollege,3cteko,atlanticdreamer,4,Fri Jul 10 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's the golden question, isn't it?  Is the quality of my education better? Yes, absolutely.  Should YOU spend a heckuva lot of your (or your parents' or the government's or whoever's) hard earned money to go there? Well, that depends.  The most obvious improvements are in:  a) the quality of professors and faculty, and their devotion to to ALL students including undergrads  b) access to resources including financial aid, better facilities, career planning/counseling, and other students  c) quality of student life, which includes living facilities, food, campus events, university support of student groups. WUSTL has a stir-fry bar where they will cook it in front of you Benihana-style. I'm pretty sure KU had roaches in their kitchens  d) networking. I know plenty of people who have gone on to work for big name companies like Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, heck i even know a girl who is now personal assistant to an A-list actor. Not that KU doesn't also have people that do these things, but you'd be way more hard-pressed to find 'em, and recruiters from those places aren't going to focus their attention as much on the flagships.  e) brand name.  Things state school had over selective school:  a) parties  b) sports  and that's pretty much it. This is, of course just my humble opinion, and none of this means that large public universities don't have top quality students who are driven, some solid networking, and some great professors. I'm talking about broader trends here.  But then there's that pesky issue of money. Well, not pesky, but more a gaping hole in most peoples' sides. I was incredibly fortunate in that I am going to be able to graduate debt-free from my university, but believe me when I tell you that I'm aware taking on a lot of debt is not an option for many people. I'd suggest that if you wanted to take on the debt to study something with high future job prospects, and you make excellent use of the networking and resources offered by a top-tier school, then it can prove to be an outstanding long-term investment in your future. But that is of course unique to your situation, interests, and career goals (and if you can get into the program in the first place.)"
ApplyingToCollege,3cteko,MrGoldenFedora,3,Sat Jul 11 00:36:56 2015 UTC,From what you have observed what are some of the most prominent similarities between students of St. Louis that students of State don't commonly posses.
ApplyingToCollege,3cteko,ThePiNinja,3,Fri Jul 10 22:46:14 2015 UTC,"Great question. The difference between students is night and day.  An important factor in your college decision should be the kind of social environment you want to immerse yourself in. This is one of the largest differences I found between the two universities.  KU often came across as something out of a college movie from the 80's. Greek Life is DOMINANT and there are many, many, many more people who are more interested in the social aspect of college than in their education. While part of this undoubtedly arises from the fact that KU is an extremely large school compared to Wash U, the proportion of students who consistently skip class and throw themselves into the party scene is way out of whack.  WUSTL, on the other hand, is filled with students who are driven to achieve academic success. You simply can't be admitted to a school that selective without that drive.  It shows itself in all kinds of ways. At my state school, even during finals week the libraries would have entire floors that were completely empty. At the private school, if you want a seat in the library during finals week, you'd better bring a sleeping bag.  Think about it this way: if a university accepts, let's say, 20% of its applicants in a given year, that means that for every student who received a 'yes' letter, four received a 'no' or 'waitlist' letter. If you want one of those 'yes' letters then you'd damn well better have shown a penchant for learning (through standardized materials like GPA and scores), a unique set of talents and world view (through non-standardized materials like interviews, essays etc.), and a desire to attend their school more than anything.  WUSTL hovers around a 16-17% average. Last time I checked Kansas was at about 96%. It's gotta make you think, 'who ISN'T being accepted?' I always feel like a bit of a dick comparing university acceptance rates (like, what is the major difference between someone who got a 32 and a 35 on their ACT?) but with gaps that large there is simply no comparison. Students at selective schools, by the very fact of their being at the selective school, must have been pretty impressive to someone, somewhere, somehow.  This is not to say that there are not people at selective schools who have little or no common sense. These people exist everywhere you go, be it Harvard or U of Phoenix. But you simply cannot attend an elite school without somehow demonstrating your uniqueness and commitment to excellence.  So that disparity is very much reflected in the people you meet. Greek Life is waaaaay less of a factor in the private school (though I imagine at Ivies it's a bit more prominent) and our sports teams are a bit of a running joke (though they are quite competitive, it's just that no one really follows them or cares.) It's all about the kind of environment you desire, and the kind of person you are willing to work to become.  Edit: I don't mean to say that Greek life is filled with idiots or something. I'm not in GL myself but there are plenty of students who are more interested in the brother/sisterhood and networking aspects than in the social aspects. But these are, in my experience, not quite so common as those into partying all night and skipping class (mainly at the State school, private school students are much more tame.)"
ApplyingToCollege,3cteko,hlng09,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:02:10 2015 UTC,"Would you recommend attending a state school and then transferring to a more selective university after one or two years, or just straight going to the better school? Does transferring have a huge impact on grades, and is applying to the better school harder with transferring or (do you think) easier? Also, this one's pretty general, but how did you pick your major?"
ApplyingToCollege,3cteko,hlng09,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:14:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry! Posted with my regular reddit account by mistake :)  So I think to answer this question I should explain a bit about why my college career ended up like it did. I initially went to a state school for a few reasons:  -to save money  -to get away from home (see some of my other comments why I decided to get away from the 'less intellectual' environment at state school)  -I didn't feel like my grades and scores were up to par with the kind of students who get accepted to top schools (I think I was sitting on about a 3.4? With a 30 ACT)  So I went out of state, at a considerably lower price thanks to the healthy, merit based scholarships I automatically qualified for. I (meaning my parents) ended up paying about 40% in that freshman year of what I pay now, which came in handy later in convincing my parents to pony up for the more expensive private school. Something to keep in mind about transferring is that it can be considerably more difficult to get an acceptance as a transfer than as a normal freshman. I was able to do it by busting my ass to get a 4.0 while at KU plus excellent recommendations and good essays (being a partial legacy didn't hurt either.)  So, if saving money is your game, it could be a feasible option to take the path I did. Transfer acceptance can be very tricky, though, so I'd recommend working your ASS off to get a stellar transfer application. I'd also recommend applying to your target schools as a freshman and just seeing what kind of financial aid/scholarships they can offer you.  As for my major: I bounced around a bit because my interests shifted as I took different courses. I'd highly recommend using your first year to explore your own interests, even if you're pretty sure you want to do one particular thing. You never know what class might really resonate with you or might have some relevance with your chosen field. I've never bought into the theory that college is just a place to get a job...you're spending too much money on a wholesome education to just ignore everything except the 'money-making' skills. I picked English in the end because I loved it, I was good at it, and because I felt like I knew how to make it marketable for me.  Edit: as for credits, do some reasearch about transferring credits to your target school before hand so you're not caught off guard by their policies when it's too late."

ApplyingToCollege,3ct3nl,jozef_telefonmast,3,Fri Jul 10 15:36:59 2015 UTC,"It can definitely affect your admission, but whenever I talk to other counselors about international admission I don't really hear the scandals come into conversation.   There are two big factors that come into play, one is what you mentioned in that there are thousands of other international students like yourself applying for these same colleges and universities. Because of this, you'll be sort of ""competing"" for those non-domestic spots for each entering class. If every strong applicant at your high school has a 4.0, and you have a 3.7, that shows on the Common App under the counselor report. The most difficult part is going to be diversifying yourself from that pool and showing how you are unique from the masses.  The second additional factor for an international student is your income, this is because unless you are a US citizen you will not be able to qualify for federal-based financial aid. You didn't give any specifics for your reach schools, but if they are private colleges and they are well-ranked, there is a chance that they meet demonstrated need for financial aid. That's a good thing for a lot of students because it means they don't have to actually pay the sticker price of the college, but for international students it's different since the school won't be getting help from the government to pay for you. This means that if you need aid, they'll be paying out of pocket to bring you to campus. This can affect your admission decision. If your family is well-off enough to afford most of tuition and other fees, then you should be fine, but it is something to keep in mind.  The other recommendation I can give to you is that it mind be worth considering applying early decision to your top choice. International students are incredibly tricky when it comes to admissions because it's difficult to predict the yield rate for those accepted. If you apply early decision, the college has the assurance that you will be attending if accepted.   Additionally, I'm not sure what type of high school you are coming from. I would reach out to the admission offices of the colleges you are looking at and ask them if they can provide you with the contact information of other students from your school that were successfully admitted.  Feel free to let me know if you have any other questions."
ApplyingToCollege,3csx0v,iamthabyrdman,2,Fri Jul 10 14:44:51 2015 UTC,"You will probably have to apply as a transfer student, since you already have credits but no degree. That means they want to see your entire academic record, including those failed classes. If you don't include them, and they find out, you will definitely not be offered admission. Your best bet is to explain the ""special circumstances,"" if any, that led to your GPA slipping.   While it's true that acceptance rates are lower for transfer students, if you apply to a school that is a match or a safety, you still have a decent chance of getting in. This depends on the type of school, too, of course - large state schools are accustomed to accepting many transfer students from community colleges and private colleges."

ApplyingToCollege,3cqxwr,SurpriseElephant,2,Fri Jul 10 03:09:26 2015 UTC,You have a shot. Engineering is a lot tougher to get into than their LSA program but it's worth a try. I'd try to get your SAT up as you mentioned. UMich REALLY cares about rankings so they put scores and GPA first.

ApplyingToCollege,3cqxwr,SurpriseElephant,2,Fri Jul 10 03:06:12 2015 UTC,What about JHU? They have excellent programs for chemical and materials engineering as well as the #1 rated biomedical program in the world. I'd argue they overlap strongly with CMU. Cheers.
ApplyingToCollege,3cqvuu,livinginthewood,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:25:30 2015 UTC,"My advice for people looking for ECs related to specific majors is to think about what field-related skills they want to develop and demonstrate. The standard ones are DECA (standard for any student planning to enter a business-related field) or a job (which demonstrates teamwork and organizational ability).   The truth about ECs is that it's more important that the ones you pick convey something about your individual skills and personal qualities. If you're passionate about sports, go for it. If you decide to work for nonprofits for causes you care about, it will not hurt your application. Colleges do not expect you to have your entire career trajectory figured out by the age of 18, they expect you to live a little."

ApplyingToCollege,3cmxia,Fitzelli,2,Thu Jul 9 03:49:11 2015 UTC,"Heya! The general advice on rec letters is to have one math/science person and one humanities person. If you add a third letter, it should speak to an aspect of you that won't come through in the class. The most common third letters come from coaches, bosses, and other people who aren't your classroom teachers. I think you should simply choose the two teachers that know you best (Anatomy and history, probably), unless you think that your Spanish teacher and your history teacher see really different sides of you.   Submitting 2 rec letters that say the same thing isn't really going to help you - it's really just an extra burden on one of your teachers. However, if you truly think an admissions officer would get to see something valuable about you from seeing one more perspective, go ahead and ask!"
ApplyingToCollege,3cmxia,iamportal,2,Thu Jul 9 04:12:06 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, you should pick the best two (In this instance, #1 and #3) and save your quizbowl sponsor for any school that wants a non-teacher letter of recommendation.  That's what I'm doing at any rate - I'm getting two letters of recommendation from academic teachers, and I'm getting a third from my quizbowl sponsor in case some schools offer the option for a non-academic letter.  On a more general note, the best trend is to have one social science/humanities (including foreign language) teacher along with one math/tech/science teacher. Whatever you do, be sure to include your bio teacher."

I went to talk to my English teacher and he told me to focus on one specific story and expand on that with a lot of detail. A lot of peer essays I read tried too hard to focus on everything rather than one important part of their life. As for finishing your essay, here's what I recommend for the intro, add detail. Talk about the weather, the world around you, set the scene so the person reading feels like they were actually there. In my first paragraph, I set the scene and the mood for the rest of the essay. In the second paragraph, I got into the actual story and explained the personal experience I had, the third paragraph was one of my shortest, I expanded a bit on the personal experience while also going into a little bit of what the experience taught me, the final paragraph is where I talked about the consequence of the experience, what ultimately happened and how it effected me, answering the last part of the question.

It's certainly a lot closer than California, at any rate. However, it's a good bit more expensive (in the mid-$60,000's for tuition before you start cancelling stuff out).  Also, consider the University of Michigan as a general match school. Your scores are great for it,  and its EECS (Engineering/CS) school is pretty good, as is its education in all that other stuff. My brother went there and is working for a major tech company on the West Coast now. Plus, just about everyone's heard of the Michigan Wolverines.  Hope that helps!"

You have quite good stats, and you at least have a shot at just about any school, though some are still tough to get into. Here are a few thoughts:  Reaches:   You might want to think a little more about these. Stanford's department does tend to have a little bit of a reputation for not caring about its undergrads, and I'm also not sure how strong UPenn's aerospace program is. You should definitely look at MIT, CalTech is also very good, and Princeton might be somewhere to consider if you want a little bit broader of a school.  Mids:  Michigan and Purdue are fantastic schools, definitely great choices. Georgia tech is another good one that comes to mind.   Safeties:  The University of Maryland is a great safety to have -it's got a strong program and is in-state. Another to consider is Case Western, which has a good Aerospace program and tends to award pretty big merit scholarships."

If you can get your testing scores up a little more, you would have abetter chance at getting into a top tier UC.  As for tuition however, since you are out of state, it's going to be expensive. Around 35k. But if you become a resident of CA, it's about 12k.

Your ECs and courses seem to indicate that you're good at math, but your SAT score doesn't so much.  Assuming you didn't prep much or at all, a little bit can go a long way, a good percentage of your score improvement from prep is from just getting used to the format.  There's a formula to the essay and a review of grammar (Erica Meltzer has an excellent book) can make a big difference in writing.

As it shows both your interest in the subject and your willingness to seek it out.   Lastly, when you submit your resume it appears that CS will be a dominating factor.

ApplyingToCollege,3cdqdu,CollegeNooblord,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:03:21 2015 UTC,"It may seem odd to have three highly fluctuating SAT scores. If what you're suggesting is this:  SAT 1: 800 Math/600 Reading/600 Writing  SAT 2: 600 Math/800 Reading/600 Writing  SAT 3: 600 Math/600 Reading/800 Writing  ...then that would be strange (although not necessarily detrimental) in the eyes of an admissions officer. It may harm your overall outlook a little, but your superscore would still be high. I don't think it would be a guaranteed detriment unless you end up taking the SAT nine times or something. And then there would be the case of some kids taking the SAT or ACT once and nailing a 2300 or a 35, compared to the shotgun approach of multiple subsection-focused SATs.  However, it would certainly be a waste of your time (saturday mornings!) and money, and there is no guarantee of it working. Instead of risking a possible detriment by taking an SAT three times with wildly varying scores, you're better off studying to try and get your high scores done all at once. Learning grammar rules won't make you forget algebra, and so forth.  Regarding your ACT question, they don't have to see crappy composite scores if you don't want to send them - unless they're important to your superscoring (but please don't bother taking it four times by focusing on each section once). If you get a 28 on your first try, 30 on your second, and 32 on your third (with increasing section scores each time), you just have to send that last one in, and the schools won't know/care about the rest."
ApplyingToCollege,3cdqdu,Detrinex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:24:23 2015 UTC,Thanks. I didn't know about only sending in the highest score for ACT. I heard from students that you have to send all SAT scores i.e take it 2 times send both scores. Is it correct that I only send in the highest SAT even if I take it 2-3 times?
ApplyingToCollege,3cdqdu,Detrinex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:48:34 2015 UTC,"I always thought that if I got a low SAT score (where all subsection scores were lower than previous/future SATs) then I didn't have to send that one. You may want to double-check with someone else, of course.  If you have one test that goes 600/600/600 and another that goes 700/700/700, you can ignore the one with the 600's and only send the highest - but that may not always be the best option since score improvements are rarely so clear-cut like that.  tl;dr: You can only send in the highest SAT instead of all of them, to my knowledge, but you'll likely end up sending multiple."

I'm not exactly interested in what you like, but I did take APCS for some reason. I think an advantage of sitting around with your computer (which I am also guilty of) is what you can learn. I don't know if you already do this, but you could try learning new programming languages in your free time. Maybe try looking for an internship or volunteering position related to computers. If you aren't already in math/science clubs like math team or science olympiad, join them. I can assure you that there are equally socially incompetent people there.  We have time (but so, so little), so just work on building up ECs that will help you with your major.

However, I think with your high stats you'll have a good chance with some of the UCs on your list. Affirmative action won't help you with the UCs, but you might try your hand on some private schools in a similar tier.   Basically: you probably won't get into very selective schools, because many Berkeley applicants have the grades/scores AND the ECs. But you'll probably have a good shot at UCs and private schools that are less selective.   Edit: Also, junior year, the summer after, and the start of senior year is plenty of time to get your ECs in. The majority of my ECs were accomplished in that timeframe. I'm at Cal.

Your SAT II scores should be around a 700 and in science/math too.  You don't have to be perfect at math and science, remember they are still looking at you holistically.

Taking it this year. Programming III (Honors class) is for people who already completed APCS and want to take more for giggles. My school offers three levels - I skipped the first, and took the second level (which taught the APCS curriculum) and am going to take the third this year.   Extracurriculars:   Possible member of the school's Zero Robotics team (uncertain because there are other kids who are as good/are better at physics than I) which will program the software for a robot in a contest hosted in Lower Earth Orbit, sponsored by MIT and the ESA/ISS. Secretary of the Asian-American Club. Nothing big here, folks, just food and movies once or twice a month. Member of the Science, English, and History Honors Societies. Possibly officer in Science, but unlikely. This 'ere's the big one.

Ultimately, and some people might disagree with this advice, I think you should take whichever class you like more. If you want to take journalism more than orchestra (i.e. you genuinely like it more) then take journalism. And vice versa.

An essay like yours, or the essay you'll write, will be totally out of the ordinary (in the best possible way) and will catch their eye.   One thing you want to note, for the benefit of someone (like me) who is unfamiliar with e-sports, is the scale and level of involvement your role entails. Don't expect the reader to know much about e-sports (it seems like you already know this, but I just wanted to reinforce that for you).   For example, ""I played 1000 hours of Counterstrike"" sounds way different than something like: ""I am the captain of a semi-professional, 5-man counterstrike team. With members from 5 different countries and all over 21 years of age, my fluency in 4 languages, understanding of cultural differences, and maturity are as important as my competitive drive and ability to lead.""  TL;DR stick with your gut; this will be a strong essay that will complement your academic qualifications well  Bonus tip: Take the German SAT II and submit it with your application, independent of the other test(s) you submit. You will almost certainly get an 800. As a rule, international students applying to US schools should always take the SAT II in their native language and/or the one used in school (if those languages are offered), because they will do much better than the average English-speaker trying to learn it."

The best one I got into, Duke, I got in mainly because I mentioned I am a Democrat in a mostly Republican state, and apparently my admissions counselor was, too. So what gets you admitted versus getting put on the waitlist can be very random.   Also, to all those applying, be very aware that quotas are a huge part of what's going on and anyone who denies it doesn't know what they are talking about. For example, in my small state they take 2 kids for Harvard every year, and one of the girls who got in was not very bright (only top 10% at an academically weak high school) but got in because she was openly LGBTQ on her application. Am I saying you should lie and put things down on your app to add ""diversity?"" No. Just be yourself.

They don't care so much about the hardships, but they are trying to look into your philosophies and values, and the best way to do so is to see what you got out of your experiences. Being in a similar position as you with a fairly average, normal life, I would consider it fairly hard to write a meaningful essay if I hadn't experienced what I was writing about myself.

The government looks at your FAFSA application and either goes ""Wow, OP really needs some money for college!"" or ""Nah, his family's got it covered"" or some combination of the two. If they determine you are qualified for financial aid, then they offer you aid in the forms of either grants (money that does not need to be paid back, is basically a scholarship without the work), loans (self-explanatory for the most part), or work-study (let me know if you have questions on this, it's a bit more complicated).  The rest of this is how it works in Texas, I'm not 100% sure about how it works in other states. Even though the government offers you this money, they do not give it directly to you. They give the money to the school, who then rations it out to all of their students according to how much the government said you are to receive. At this stage, the school is able to offer you their own financial aid as well, in the forms of more grants, loans, work-study, and scholarships (free money usually requiring obligations or commitments such as joining a scholarship organization or having a high enough GPA). Specific departments for your major may also step in at this time and offer additional scholarships. After calculating all of the scholarship/grant money that you are entitled to receive, the school may lower the amount of your loan offerings so that it doesn't go above your estimated cost of attendance (not just tuition, but the cost of actually living in college, such as money for food and gas and housing). This stage usually happens over the summer. You usually need to formally accept all of your grants and scholarships, as well as agree to how much money you actually want to take out of your loan (you generally do not have to take out the full amount if you don't need to), although at this point you still do not have your money yet.  Then, usually right before the semester begins, your school will automatically pay for what you owe directly out of your scholarship/grant/loan money. They take out tuition, fees, room & board/housing, meal plans, and whatever else you may or may not owe the school. THEN, after they charge you for what you owe, you get the rest of your money as a refund for you to spend on whatever you need to, such as textbooks and other school supplies.  Again, this may or may not hold true for your state or school, but this is how it works at my state and at my school. If you have any questions or need clarification, let me know and I'll be happy to try my best at answering your questions."

ApplyingToCollege,3bypxf,devondashla,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:45:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't see your reply until now!  Work-study's first requirement is that you need to be employed and in school at the same time. If your employee allows work-study (most on-campus jobs do, and depending on your area some close by off-campus workplaces as well), some of the money will be paid by the government in the form of the Work-Study aid you were offered, instead of being paid by your employer. This is beneficial because you do not have to pay taxes on your income you received from this form of financial aid."

You can generally get a more-favorable admissions decision at your local UC because of a combination of factors.

However, I do remember that the UC app requires 2 essays and the Common App either had 2 or 3, and the topics were different enough that I had different essays for each.   As for essay tips, focus on what makes you as an individual unique. For example, I was/am obsessed with scientific research and spent tons of space in one essay devoted to that - this worked out to my advantage especially for the UCs since they are very research-focused. I didn't spend a whole lot of time talking about my more ""run of the mill"" type extracurriculars because I knew many other people were going to write about that. So spend a lot of time reflecting on what you're passionate about and what makes you different from other applicants!"

According to what you've said, you've taken four college classes - three of them successfully. You have good leadership, great grades, good course rigor, and I'm guessing you have good standardized test scores.  Given that information, your top choice school will be able to understand that there was an administrative issue with your psychology class by realizing that this isn't part of a larger trend.  My advice, as a fellow rising senior, is not to panic. Contact your community college and talk with the teacher or administrator involved. Explain the situation regarding testing, and continue with your plans to retake the class if this isn't resolved by your communication with them. If the F stays on the record, grin and bear it because your school will know it's a fluke.  If you get denied or deferred come November/December, it'll probably be due to your essays or your recommendations instead of that one grade."

Georgetown University, for example, has crucifixes hanging on the walls in the classrooms and lecture halls (one auditorium has a crucifix right next to the periodic table poster) and contraceptives are not offered in the student health center or in stores on campus.

For example, students at Loyola University Chicago will have to take some religion courses. Most of them focus on Christian philosophy, but there are some courses that are more about general philosophical debates or other world religions it would not hurt you to learn about.   Other colleges might be less strict about this - I know the University of Portland lets students fulfill their ""metaphysics"" requirements with any upper-level philosophy course (and most of them aren't even about Christianity)."

A perfect score would also help you if you were applying for competitive merit scholarships.  A 36 will definitely help out your application as far as admissions goes to.

Colleges care about potential that has been realized and is easily visible in your app. So honestly, what I'd say is this. In junior year, just unleash holy hell academically. Go all out and get the absolute best grades you can, both semesters. The tests matter a lot, but they matter less than your GPA.   I know I'm smart but my laziness/lack of motivation is really what's holding me back.   This should help you out (hopefully) on whichever standardized tests you take. I'd recommend the ACT.

Yes I reread them for grammar, but the ideas mostly stayed the same.  Many of the essay questions are similar. Now, I would never recommend reusing an essay unless the question was identical, reusing ideas made my time on some of my last few essays much easier.

MIT, for example, probably would not find a 720 on Math II particularly impressive. Less competitive schools might.   Does the percentile matter more than the actual score?   I'm not sure what you mean by this exactly. The percentile and score are inextricably linked, it would be impossible for one person to have a higher score but a lower percentile than someone else on the same test. Percentile and score are effectively two different ways of representing the same thing.  It's also worth pointing out that that 50th percentile is among the people who took the math 2 test. In general, only the more competitive students take subject tests because only the more competitive colleges require them, so 50th percentile among that group isn't as bad as it sounds. You're probably used to tests like the SAT I or ACT which everyone takes and it's a lot easier to score in the 90th+ percentile, so your perception of what you should get is skewed."

For me, in my personal statement I made clear the cause of my depression (family issues) and how I overcame that. I put heavy emphasis on my recovery and the fact that I managed to succeed in spite of everything else I was dealing with.

If you want to major in Finance, then you should choose mostly schools that demonstrate a strength is that area (US News rankings are a good STARTING place for this because quality of a graduate program is usually influential on that of the undergraduate's; however, rankings should be taken with a grain of salt and not be the end all in this endeavor. It also leaves out any LACs you may be interested in). If you are going to need substantial need-based aid, you can cut off a lot of universities that are lacking here. The best way to tell how good a school is with FA is by running the net price calculators, and also looking at statistics of %full need met/average % need met. I'd imagine with a 3.9+ gpa and 34 ACT you'd qualify for merit at a lot of schools. Also keep in mind that applying to so many colleges can get quite expensive, so it might not be a good idea to apply to EVERY college that meets loosely determined criteria. I'm having this issue now, and my list is only at ~10. It also helps to visit the website for each school individually and research what sort of opportunities they have that relate to your major such as co-op programs and ability to do research as an undergrad. I wish you good luck!"

Also, you should really consider looking at some safeties, like Drexel or University of Washington. (Also, the Seattle climate is pretty mild and gets a bad rap - it's rather gray but not nearly as harsh as places like Massachusetts in the wintertime.)   When it comes to eliminating colleges, sometimes it just comes down to gut feelings - such as whether you'd ""fit in"" to the college culture. It is a mistake to make your choices based on who you want to be, and not on who you are. Just because a school is more ""prestigious"" doesn't mean you should try to shoehorn yourself in there.   I started off with a very long list of colleges but eliminated them for various reasons - the dorms were grody, it didn't offer enough tutoring, no bureaucratic organization, dismal disability support, etc. When it comes to close matches like that you kind of have to go by instinct."

Cornell is in upstate New York, by the Finger Lakes. The average year-round high in Ithaca NY (where Cornell is) is 56.5 degrees, and in January the high is about 32 (low is about 16) and it gets about 5 feet of snow a year. If you're ruling out Michigan-Ann Arbor based on temperature, you might want to rule out Cornell too. They're basically the same in terms of climate. Also, Ithaca NY is closer to Canada than NYC, and it's not really in/near a major city.  As for Northeastern/BU/Boston College/MIT, note that Boston is smack in the middle of New England and gets to be about 35 degrees for January highs (plus 22+ days with snowy precipitation). Not as cold as Ann Arbor or Ithaca, but it's up there.  Anyways...  GWU and Georgetown are within spitting distance of each other - I'm saying this as a resident of a DC suburb. If you believe you can get into Georgetown, you may want to forgo GWU to save time on applications since you'll still be applying to a bunch.  UW-Seattle is a good school, in my opinion, but I have relatives in Seattle who will confirm that the Sun does not exist outside of the summer months.

However, unless you have a really good ""struggle"" story, it's rare for good subjective factors to make up for less-than-ideal objective factors.   Do not look at schools with much higher average test scores and GPA than you and think ""well, maybe if I just write a really good essay I can still get in"" because you probably won't.

Some schools force you to spend a year in the school/program you were admitted to so you may need to take 5 years to graduate if you want to cheat the system.  Some schools will make you re-apply or your app may be reviewed again if you were admitted and want to switch schools/programs before you start school.  Pretty much every admissions office knows what schools/programs are easier to get in to so they have become very good at spotting people trying to cheat the system.  Some schools, maybe most, you don't apply to the specific major or program.  You'd apply to a larger school or college and pick your major later.  You are not the first person to think they can cheat the system so most schools have figured out ways to stop it from happening.

ApplyingToCollege,3bgkps,RoleModelFailure,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:55:30 2015 UTC,"This is a good answer and I'll just add to it because OP specifically mentioned UCLA. If you apply to the college of Letters and Science then the major you pick doesn't really matter. For the college of engineering you have to apply by major, and engineering is more selective and harder to get into. You can transfer between colleges after being accepted into one, but you have to apply to transfer and the difficulty in transferring is pretty much proportional to being admitted normally. Transferring from Engineering to L&S is a lot easier than going the other way.   I'm in a similar spot as you with slightly better stats, and I plan on applying directly to engineering."

Kennesaw State, UGA, and Ga Tech    I just want to help temper expectations a bit here. It sounds like, based upon your post, you're hoping that your test scores will carry you.   Realize that, while those scores are above average nationwide, I think ""very good"" is a bit generous, especially if you're considering somewhere like UGA (I'm ignoring GaTech, because you already acknowledged what a stretch that one is). A quick Google turned up this page, which shows that your scores fall in the middle 50% of admitted students (and probably the lower half, so between 25th and 50th percentiles) at UGA. Even if you had a solid GPA – and that's not a small ""if"" – you'd still be shy of ""average"" for UGA.  If you're really interested in out-of-state schools that weigh SAT/ACT more heavily (or where they can compensate more for GPA), I would look at the CSU (California State University) system (it's public, not private, but hey, it fits your main criterion). When I was applying, I remember that they had a table for some campuses. On one axis was your GPA, on the other was SAT/ACT score, and you could see what you needed for one given the other.  And, finally, I'm sure you've heard it before – and if not, you will hear it in the future – but this:   So, if I'm honest, I'm pretty darn intelligent but a bit of a slacker.   isn't going to cut it in college. You have time to develop better study habits, and you've done pretty well for yourself, but please take my advice and don't learn the hard way during your freshman year that you need to work hard."

ApplyingToCollege,3bcyta,cr42,2,Sun Jun 28 04:24:23 2015 UTC,"California is quite far away though   Fair enough.  And all I'll say regarding people getting in with similar scores is that a lot will probably depend on on their extracurricular activities, essays, and letters and, even then, for every person you know who got in with those scores, there are bound to be others who didn't. You're right, though; it isn't out of the realm of possibility. I just wanted to make sure you didn't think UGA was going to be easy to get into, because it's more of a high-match or low-reach, as you just said.  And sorry, I didn't mean to imply that a 29 is anything to sneeze at. You just need to look at in context relative to your schools of interest; I saw ""UGA, GaTech"" and ""very good"" and alarm bells went off.   It might help if you can bump your score slightly (for example, a 32 is 98th percentile), especially if you're interested in out-of-state private schools (I can only assume you mean LAC's and/or lesser-known universities, because Notre Dame, Duke, Ivies, etc. are out of reach with your current numbers). As you said, if you just care about schools in Georgia, you're fine for KSU right now, but if you're looking elsewhere, improving your score will help."
ApplyingToCollege,3bcyta,MrIndianTeem,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:14:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks a ton! Yes, UGA has gotten quite a bit harder to get into in the past 15 years or so.

ApplyingToCollege,3bcqr3,hopeucanswim,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:56:33 2015 UTC,Missouri's the only state I know of off the top of my head where it's possible.
ApplyingToCollege,3bcqr3,runninger,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:33:09 2015 UTC,"Establishing residency in a state you don't live in is very different. For instance, in Washington State you have to be able to provide licenses or other official documents proving you have lived there for a certain amount of time.   That being said, it is totally possible to attend state school in a state you don't live in. You won't get in-state tuition rates, but it would still probably be less than full tuition or moderate financial aid at a private school. Private schools are very generous with financial aid if you can demonstrate enough need, but if you don't get that then state schools are the cheaper option."
ApplyingToCollege,3bcqr3,a-real-class-act,2,Sun Jun 28 03:29:37 2015 UTC,Are you saying state schools might be able to dock the price even if I can't demonstrate need? Because currently the out of state rates seem pretty close to the cost of private schools
ApplyingToCollege,3bcqr3,a-real-class-act,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:47:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the confusion, I guess I didn't explain myself clearly.   State schools might cost a little less than some of the higher-end private schools, but they are also stingier with aid, especially to out-of-state students. However, it's not unheard of for students to get scholarships if they are very academically strong or come from a very poor family.   Private schools, on the other hand, are a bit more expensive but are less likely to skimp on the aid. Also, if you apply to schools in a region that doesn't usually get a lot of applicants from your state, they have extra incentive to admit you for ""geographic diversity."""
ApplyingToCollege,3bboon,iSeeXenuInYou,6,Sat Jun 27 18:07:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, your ACT is a little low. The ACT is more of an achievement test, while the SAT is an aptitude test - have you taken the SAT?   Do you have any other ECs?"

It is absolutely possible for you to raise this score. I'm a tutor that specializes in helping students get above a 30 on the ACT. If you're interested in a few strategy sessions, pm me.

You being valedictorian or salutatorian is going to help a lot especially with your class size. Your other achievements are also very impressive, so if you get a 30 or 31 your chances of being accepted are around 65 percent I'd say, which is very good.

ApplyingToCollege,3bboon,ethood1999,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:14:46 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I would spend a serious amount of time over the summer studying. If you can afford it, get a tutor. If you can't, it's easy to study yourself at home as long as you're determined and willing to put in time. You have to keep doing practice exams and make sure you understand why you're getting questions wrong and how to get them right the next time - that is the best way to improve any test score, especially for a test like the ACT where there are a limited amount of types of questions they ask. I can give more advice on self-preparation if needed.  Also, it's important to realize that test scores aren't everything. Not saying this is true for you, but colleges recognize some people are simply bad test takers, which is why they also look at the rest of your application. To me, it looks pretty strong (three leadership positions, 1 B, and valedictorian or salutatorian), so I will tell you that is possible to get accepted with your ACT scores (people have been accepted with worse scores and worse GPAs), however, with a college as selective as Vanderbilt, it's honestly too difficult to predict who the adcoms will choose to accept, and why they chose those people. Make sure you're not putting too much hope into this one school. There are plenty of other great schools out there.   Good luck!"

Does it matter which subject tests you take, even if they don't relate to your field of interest?   Yes. Some schools require biology/chemistry subject tests for those applying into a medical field, or at the very least some sort of science for prospective engineers (examples: JHU and Northwestern) - and you should try to take a math subject test if at all possible...which is a segue to your next question.   Is Math 1 even worth taking?   No. If you have a math education that includes precalculus, take Math 2."
ApplyingToCollege,3b5dvm,Detrinex,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:08:26 2015 UTC,"Check the requirements of the colleges that you're applying to. For example, MIT only requires one math and one science (there's literally no space on the application to self-report any other SAT II scores).  My counselor told me to take one math, one humanities and one science Subject Test in order to demonstrate proficiency in different areas. As a result, I ended up taking the SAT II Chem test even though I only earned a 3 on the AP Chem test and I'm planning on majoring in economics. I feel like it's more important to choose subjects that you'll do well in.    Not a lot of people take Math 1 because the curve is harsher compared to Math 2, so the reasoning is that since most people have already completed precalculus by the time they're taking the exam, it would be more reasonable to take Math 2.

Going to community college isn't embarrassing...it's a very smart choice for some people. People go to community college for all sorts of reasons. Community college has the stereotype for being for kids who barely graduated high school, and while there are definitely some CC students who are lower tier students, there are also many bright kids who attend community college. Many attend a CC to save money before transferring to a 4-year college to finish their degree. Others choose to go to community college because they had a lower GPA in high school and didn't do as well as they would have liked (which is exactly your situation). So don't look down on it and think that you're above community college; it's a very smart choice for many people and something I think you should definitely look into given your GPA.   To be blunt, I can guarantee you won't get into UPenn. Penn State's a reach too, and Rutger's average SAT scores and GPA for admitted applicants are also higher than yours. So my advice to you is to 1) Find colleges that you'll have a much better chance to get into and 2) Do consider community college because it could be a very good option for you. Going to community college first and doing well there could give you a good shot at going to a more prestigious undergrad school than what's available to you currently, if that's what you want."
ApplyingToCollege,3b3peu,runninger,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:23:27 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for reading and for your help. This made me think differently on how I see community colleges and it's students. Definitely will think about going to one and try my very best there to get a school that I've dreamed to go to. Thank you so much!!!!! :)
ApplyingToCollege,3b3peu,a-real-class-act,4,Fri Jun 26 04:16:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/runninger that community college is a very good option for you. I know people have gone on to medical fields like nursing from community college, so it's not the worst thing you can put on your application. Another thing is that for undergrad, it doesn't really matter where you went to school as long as you did well; grad school is where it counts. So you could go to community college but then transfer to another school once your GPA is raised. I'm not sure where you live, but Washington State University is fairly easy to get into and has a good veterinary program."
ApplyingToCollege,3b3peu,a-real-class-act,0,Thu Jun 25 22:13:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for your opinion!!! :) Definitely will think about it. Also, is it fairly easy to go to Washington State University with the gpa and SAT score that I have right now?"
ApplyingToCollege,3b3peu,a-real-class-act,3,Fri Jun 26 04:17:18 2015 UTC,WSU is regarded as a pretty safe state school for most Washington students... you might have to buff up your ECs a bit more to make up for the GPA. But it's definitely worth a shot. (But keep in mind it is a massive party school and isn't for everybody.)
ApplyingToCollege,3b3peu,-Japan,0,Fri Jun 26 07:23:46 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks man for the information!!!

ApplyingToCollege,3b3peu,-Japan,3,Fri Jun 26 14:29:46 2015 UTC,"One more thing: Even if you don't get in the first time, you can transfer there from community college after 1 or 2 years. Many students transfer from community colleges to 4-year state schools. Good luck!"
ApplyingToCollege,3b3peu,Pareunomania,2,Fri Jun 26 23:31:16 2015 UTC,"People always say go to community college, and it's not like it's bad going there, but don't just settle on the thought of  ""meh, I'll go to a community college and transfer"".  Senior year be sure to take the SAT again and study more for it this time to ensure you get a higher score. For now, you don't need to worry about telling your parents about the score if asked. I also have Asian parents, I also had the same score as you, but I didn't want to go to a community college and I ended up getting admission into three good state schools.  Along with raising your SAT score I'll also recommend you follow the cliche advice of volunteering, joining a club, being involved and so on. I know this is a really overwhelming topic, especially when we have our parents who expect a lot from us, but you can do it.  As for the community college part and why I recommend you try to shoot higher than that is because in my opinion , it's not really the same experience. It's just a personal preference. Don't aim low when you have the potential to do better. There's may be benefits like lower prices, but in my case attending a state school is a much, much better alternative than a community college. Much more opportunities, more ammenities, and a better chance in connecting with more people."

I still log back in for like 5 minutes every month to see things. What a coincidence. What are the odds?  According to Reddit Metrics, there are currently around 700,00 subreddits. That is a 1/668,000 chance that you could have ended up on this subreddit.   A post on this subreddit stays on the front page for around 4.5 days, of its 1 year, 10 months, and 24 days in existence, or around 690 days. So that's a 4.5/690 chance that this post would have been on the front page.  I have made comments in only 1 post in this subreddit in the past month, so that is a 1/45 chance that one of my comments would be in the front page.  There are 7,100 subscribers on /r/civcraft, and it would be reasonable to assume that of those, around 4,000 are still active. So that is a 1/40002 chance that we would have both been members of civcraft.  In addition to this, the chance of one of us being alive on this planet is 1/400,000,000,000,000, according to this blog. So the both of us being alive is 1/400,000,000,000,0002.  Multiplying all of these chances together, we come out to this coincidence having a probability of 1 in 8.5x1047 chance of happening.

I don't know how the people down in Fairfax or Arlington or Loudoun or whatever do it, but I'm sure the county government would be willing to take (probably unpaid) interns for a few weeks/months. Admittedly, the Attorney's Office is probably one of the more relaxed work environments nearby, which is why the process was so easy, but there may be others.  If you live really close to DC like in Rosslyn, you may want to consider the possibility of a downtown internship, maybe at the Smithsonian or a local office that you may have heard of too. The details don't matter so much as your initiative, in my opinion, so just send out e-mails with a resume attached and hope for the best!  summary: county gov'ts are often a safe bet, maybe downtown museums or something. if you have good science teacher relationships, consider an application to some DoD-related internship.

I got about half B's and half A's. I didn't care much about school as I probably should have. When I took the PSAT (school required me to, plus I wanted to see how I would score back then), I scored 50R/70M/46W. To convert to SAT scores, just add a 0 to the end of those numbers. So yea I knew I had to get that reading and writing up.  After that I spent the next two years really trying to teach myself, focusing on reading and writing. The only resource I had was my big fat SAT book, so I would look at it a lot, read from it, and sometimes take one of those practice tests in the back. In my opinion this is the best way to prepare for these tests, just by doing practice problems. After that I took the SAT my junior year twice (December and June) and ended with a superscore of 2040, with 610R/750M/680W-8 essay. That was with no help, no tutoring, just me and my book. Maybe lower than many of the others who posted here, but nonetheless higher than average and a score that I was really proud of.  A bit of a similar story with the ACT. I actually didn't learn about the ACT's existence until sometime junior year, so I didn't have much time to prep for it. Again, all I had to study for the ACT was the ACT book (looks like the SAT book, but is red instead of blue). Same drill there, all I did was study straight out of the book, spending most of my time just doing problems. Took it when my senior year started (around september) and got a 33 composite, 31E/33M/32R/36S/9 essay. I was really proud of this, this was enough to be ivy league competitive.  In case you haven't gotten my point, study from books and DO PRACTICE TESTS! They help so much. Try and set up a mock test, where you actually take one of the full practice tests and do all the time restrictions and all that. Trust me that'll help you so much, more than anything else.  One last thing, some may disagree with this, but I thought the ACT was immensely easier than the SAT. I'd take the ACT over the SAT if you get a chance to."
ApplyingToCollege,3ayqyt,AznKwokBoi,2,Thu Jun 25 18:14:06 2015 UTC,I studied over the summer junior year at Princeton review for a month. Took my first sat in October and got 2090. Was very meh about it. My dad told me I was signed up for an act in may(?) along with the sat. I studied for a week for the sat and yolod the act mainly. I did take one practice test. I scored a 35 on the ACT and a 2170 on the second SAT so I'm pretty set lol.
ApplyingToCollege,3ayqyt,SikhSoldiers,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"I prepped a little bit for taking the SAT in December, I went to a tutor for 60-90 minute sessions once a week. (Maybe for three weeks total?) Ended up getting a 2180 (780 English, 740 Math, 660 Writing).    I took the ACT in June with virtually no studying for it--I think the bit of SAT tutoring might have helped, even though it was from six months prior. I ended up getting a 36!"
ApplyingToCollege,3ayqyt,_God____,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:23:11 2015 UTC,"I am a rising senior at a well-to-do public high school, taking all advanced classes and so forth. I got pretty good SATs (720CR/780M/750W) and a really good ACT (35R/35M/35E/34S, unknown essay score still).  I took the SAT twice (March/May) and the ACT once (June 13), plus subject tests on June 6. I might take the SAT again in October to see if I can raise my SAT reading, but personally I don't think I need it. Just like a lot of sophomores/juniors in the US, I took two PSATs offered by my school - one in October 2013, one in October 2014. In the summer between sophomore and junior year, I took three more PSATs, proctored by myself or my parents. Between the October '14 PSAT and the March SAT, I didn't do shit (except some last-minute minor studying). My scores went from 205 to 215 on the PSAT, and my first SAT score was 2170.  I decided to take the SAT a second time for superscoring's sake (again with limited last-minute prep), and ended up with a 2250 super - however the only improvement was an 80 (!) point skyrocketing in my writing section (now a 750, then a 670). I didn't do any test prep classes, because I figured they were a waste of time. Frankly, they probably would have boosted my reading score - although I still firmly believe that they are extraordinarily low considering how well I did on reading in practices.  As for the ACT, I took the ""ACT Explore"" (which didn't help with test prep at all) in 9th grade as offered by my school, which was confusing as hell since it didn't even use the same grading scale. I took a more accurate mock in October '13 (sophomore year) and got a 31. Past that, I basically just yolo'd and took the ACT a few weeks ago with little to no extra preparation. I didn't feel it was necessary to do particularly well in the lead-up to the ACT, since my SAT scores were already in the middle ranges for my top choice (Univ. of Chicago). Turned out alright, though.  As for subject tests, I took the Math 2, Chem, and World tests on June 6. The night before, I did some prep using the ACT's online practices in World, Chem, and Math 2, plus part of a practice test in a book for Math 2. I also took AP World History that year, which influenced my decision to take the World subject test, and I noticed that AP prep/actual test questions pretty much matched the world multiple choice. The same applies to Chem (having taken AP Chem + a shit-ton of AP Chem practice tests during the year). Coursework for math was relatively sparse - I was almost finished taking Honors Precalculus.  Overall, I didn't do any test-specific studying until the night before for any of the tests, and relied on relevant coursework + my own capacity to be a grammar nazi to do well. Even the night before, I only did 0-2 hours of total prep.  tl;dr: Did a few practices here and there. Coulda done a little better in SAT reading but eh.  NOTE: I still don't know my ACT essay score or my SAT subject test scores (although I think I did well throughout) so this advice isn't necessarily the best."

If your school has a math club (better yet, if it has a chapter of Mu Alpha Theta) then consider joining it. It offers a great way to tutor other students who aren't doing so well in math.  Of course, you shouldn't focus on only math, even though you said it's what you plan on doing for the rest of your life - opinions may change, or you might want to broaden your horizons a little (going into physics instead of just applied math, for instance). Branch out a little bit, at least for your college/university's sake, so that you don't look like you're just doing math. If you want to maintain a solely academic path, join some more honors societies or subject-related clubs (science-related stuff especially).

They take your core classes and create a new internal GPA. So if you have A's in elective classes but B's in your core classes, you will have a B GPA.   A 3.55 is low for all the schools that you mentioned.  At UCSD, only 6% of admits had a GPA between 3.5 and 3.75. At UCLA it's only 3.2% who have a GPA between 3.5 and 3.75. GT admits around 11% between 3.5 and 3.75.  It's a safe bet that most of the kids in those ranges are in state students. You should consider applying to some private schools and not so many state schools.  At the end of the day, a weighted GPA will not mitigate a low UW. The schools won't even look at your weighted. As I said, they will create their own scale which puts you on a level playing field with other applicants.  You should consider applying to RPI, WPI, Purdue and CWRU.

Your SAT score is definitely on the low side, the most cost-effective way to improve your chances would probably be to just work on that. Honestly, an Asian Male from California who wants to study CS will have an incredibly hard time getting into MIT or Stanford, and you don't have anything impressive that tells me you will, so I wouldn't get my hopes up.

All of that being said, your course rigor is only one component of your evaluation. Your ACT is good and that will help with your position.

Either way, Stats is not a super academic math class, but will fit into your intended majors. For most students, I'd say Calc and Spanish, because Stats you can always take in college and AP Spanish will really give weight to however much Spanish you've taken so for. However, since Stats is fairly relevant to your majors, if you'd rather take both maths, that would be fine too."

ApplyingToCollege,3ahkud,maroonrice,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:21:34 2015 UTC,"AP Calculus is a much more impressive math course than AP Statistics. But Spanish is also a good idea because it makes your application more well-rounded, and some schools have foreign language requirements.   Quite frankly though, colleges don't care that much whether the courses you take are relevant to what you want to study in college. They care that your courses are rigorous and that you do reasonably well in them. Don't take more than you can handle.   Also, you may want to check with the schools you want to attend to determine which AP classes (and what AP test scores) will let you skip some annoying intro courses. IMO, AP Calculus is more useful than AP Statistics in this regard, and many schools that offer language will have their own way for students to ""test out"" without the AP course."

Much safer to apply during your last year of service. Also... you might find the idea of entering freshman year as a 22 year old surrounded by 17 and 18 year olds to be really unappealing at that time, so waiting gives you an opportunity to change your mind and apply within Israel or to the UK if you or your interests have changed.  Things you should do now: get recommendations from your teachers, take the SAT/ACT, practice writing a few college essays and then throw them out and do not use them.

Talking about your intended major is great and all, and there are plenty of places to do that. However, you should keep it away from your personal statement.  That being said, the common app has a section for additional information. Utilize that area and discuss how you've explored your interest in finance and how it has shaped you as a person. Do you think differently about problems? Do you see opportunities in ordinary life that you didn't before? If those questions mean anything to you, you should include it in your application.

IMO this is better than the weekly AMA idea because this only obligates users to provide some data, not spending time on questions they don't have the time to answer. Also, not every experience is ""unique"" enough to warrant an AMA. If someone has special circumstances (i.e., is a nontraditional student, came from a particularly disprivileged background, or is at a very STRANGE college like Deep Springs) then it would be cool to hear that perspective, but I don't think everyone needs another stereotypical overachiever every week telling other people what to do.  A filter system so that people can tag posts in the title and look for threads relevant to them (Undergrad Apps, Transfer Apps, High School Advice, etc.)  More resources for transfer students and nontraditional students. I am transferring in the fall and had trouble finding information on transferring outside of ""it is inhumanly hard unless you have done ECs from Day One."""

Not ""I learned how to analyze The Scarlet Letter"", for instance, but that it was absolutely worth your time to learn that multiple drafts and a decent outline made for a better critical understanding of the novel. Or maybe that the class debate you had over whether Othello was a hero or a villain helped you discover something about the role of language choice in determining a character's morality (is it obvious that I'm also an English teacher?)  Basically, don't expect them to bend over backwards for you - give them some material to work with.

At the international level, everyone's project is truly exceptional.  It's really 80% your presentation speaking, 10% poster, and 10% project.

Your math is excellent for both of them obviously, and I think that a 740 in reading and writing beats a 33 and 31.  There is one other thing to consider.

I didn't submit either, because, well, my ACT was tons better. I took the Math 2 and Physics subject tests, and while I know I missed a few, I got 800s on both. My AP Scores for APES, Calc AB, and Physics B were all 5's, and I'm waiting on Calc BC, Psych, and AP English 12. Many people also find it interesting that I never took APUSH or AP English 11.

Can you expand on how much research you did for the multinational project? Was it ever published? Were you first author?
ApplyingToCollege,3992no,grantant,2,Thu Jun 11 15:44:13 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy to. The experiment is called the Neutron Electric Dipole Moment experiment (nEDM). In the simplest sense, It has to do with finding the distance between the positive and negative parts of the neutron. 22 insitutions across the nation/Canada are working on the Oak Ridge experiment to try to prove/disprove supersymmetry.   My job was to figure out how to get the most neutrons from where they were created, the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL to the experiment chamber. I used a neutron ray tracing program called McStas to figure out the best way to transport these neutrons down neutron tubes. I ended up increasing neutron yields by 40%, which is absolutely huge.  In the time when simulations were running, I helped leak test non magnetic seals using liquid nitrogen and liquid helium. Overall, it was a great time; I learned a lot, and I had a lot of fun.  Alas, I never got anything published, but I don't really care."

ApplyingToCollege,3992no,cleridae,3,Thu Jun 11 03:59:07 2015 UTC,"That is another thing I am worried about, extra ccurricular's, I am part of one organization called ""Big brothers, Big sisters"" which is supposed to look really good on app's but I only started that beginning of this year(junior) and will continue to do so senior year. Besides that all I can put down is some clubs that were kinda bs and only had a couple of meetings, not sure if they would find that out lol.

ApplyingToCollege,3992no,cleridae,2,Thu Jun 11 04:57:23 2015 UTC,"I have a question for you, assuming you are applying to Ivys etc.  1) Why do you want to go to these colleges?   I wanted to go to Cornell/MIT/Stanford because they spend a lot of dollars in their physics departments, and they can afford greater opportunities for their students. I can actually think of no other real good reason to go. Why do you want to attend one of these schools?  Here's my philosophy: it's better to be happy than to get into a great college. Obviously, you are doing the ""Big brothers, Big sisters"" thing purely for college applications, rather than because you find it enjoyable. Regardless, you are going to get into college, assuming your GPA isn't shit. A 23 ACT is fine for nearly any state school. I say make a band called the Flailing Photographers and make some cool music and actually enjoy your life. When colleges see that you are truly passionate about some thing, they will take note of that."

ApplyingToCollege,3944mp,UsernameNotFound7,3,Tue Jun 9 03:26:41 2015 UTC,I moved from California to Boston for college. No regrets. I like being able to adjust to two pretty different environments!

But Northeastern offers numerous opportunities to go around the world for a semester including international co-ops and co-ops in other cities such as San Diego, study abroad, and research in other countries. Most schools have similar programs. If you stay in Boston, I promise you, there will be opportunities for adventure. If you go to Cali, it will be an adventure on its own but there will still be opportunities for more adventure. You said you're applying to schools, apply to both, if both accept you, look at the financials and go with the better choice, if their both similar...than go with your gut.    TL;DR College is an adventure and brand new experience on its own."
ApplyingToCollege,3944mp,mistermonr0e,2,Wed Jun 10 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"Much of it is determined by personality and interests.  I stayed close to home, so close to home that I've been a commuter for all of my education. I love it this way and have no regrets. I'm close to my family and always have been. Also, I just have a thing for the familiar. While my friends were out exploring for the cool spots in town, I already knew them. At the same time, getting older and being able to do more has opened up more opportunities and experiences. The city I get to enjoy at 21 is a lot different than the one I knew at 10. That makes a difference too.   It sounds like you want a new experience and want to travel, so this could be a great opportunity for you. But, your priority in this decision needs to be your education. When the four years are up, you need to have had academic-based experiences to make that degree worth something. So, I would caution not to put your life experiences in front of the academic/work ones when it comes to priorities. You don't have to cross the country to have good experiences."
ApplyingToCollege,3944mp,ayybubz,2,Wed Jun 10 21:31:59 2015 UTC,"I chose to apply to schools far away from home because 1) the schools in my state weren't very suitable for me and 2) I had a turbulent home life and did not want it to affect my education. I don't regret getting away from home, but it did present some challenges that wouldn't have hindered me if I had gone to school closer to home.   1) Traveling will be much more expensive. When flying from Boston to California, you will probably need to make at least one changeover, either in Philadelphia, Chicago, or Denver. Affordable, direct flights are pretty much impossible to find.   2) Depending on where you are from, and what kind of family you are from, you may experience a bit of ""culture shock."" I am from the West Coast but went to school in the Northeast. There were very few people from my state, and I was also in a very low income bracket compared to the students around me, so I felt a bit like an outsider and had trouble making friends.   On the plus side, being from Boston means that you have a geographic advantage when applying to California schools. Colleges pride themselves on ""geographic diversity"" and attracting students from all over the country, especially from places where students normally don't apply.   Also, college is a great opportunity to travel no matter where you go. If you choose to stay in Boston, then you will still probably be able to go on a study abroad or student exchange program."

ApplyingToCollege,391uzh,Seeda_Boo,4,Tue Jun 9 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"This question centers on a circumstance fraught with irony in U.S. college admissions. (I am a former admissions director with experience at multiple extremely competitive public and private universities and numerous friends among current chief admissions officials.)  Many admissions officers face the simple reality that they want to identify black applicants but don't directly offer that choice among standard options when asking about ethnicity. (An ingrained legacy of the nascence of PC on campus.) I've heard a few admissions colleagues suggest that whites of African lineage are committing fraud by indicating African-American on their applications, while black colleagues who were born in Africa argue that such attitudes serve to deny said applicant's legitimate heritage. The latter is my belief.  My advice is to embrace your own sense of identity and answer in a manner that satisfies this regardless of how you choose to respond. As someone else mentioned, the current Common App offers a convoluted but at least minimally adequate set of options addressing ethnicity that do not require you to deny your heritage or risk being regarded as perpetuating a sham.  In instances wherein you file an institution's own application, their imprecision is not your problem. Be true to yourself. They'll figure out eventually that this question needs to change and that any mistake lies within, not with applicants who answer earnestly and truthfully. But understand that you'll possibly encounter circumstances (communications and other contacts) in which it has been assumed that you're black. I trust you know what happens when you assume..."
ApplyingToCollege,391uzh,blue_surfboard,8,Tue Jun 9 06:19:39 2015 UTC,"Absolutely this. Basically, just be yourself. If you've grown up identifying as African in some way, if that is indeed a part of your own identity as you know it, then you have the freedom to use it on applications.

ApplyingToCollege,391uzh,gregthegeek1,3,Fri Jun 12 20:23:31 2015 UTC,"The common app asks you to ""please indicate how you identify yourself"", one of the options is ""Black or African American"". Selecting it allows you to answer ""Which best describes your Black or African American background?"", the options of which are ""U.S. / African American"", ""Africa"", ""Caribbean"", and ""Other"".  Here's a screenshot if it helps  I would definitely check off ""Black or African American"" for the first question (you can select multiple options). I'm not entirely sure about the second question, but I'd probably go with ""Africa"" since your mom is from Africa. For colleges not on the common app you could probably indicate that you're African-American as well, people with looser connections do all the time.

That's great, if you are comfortable with attending your safety school.  Your 28 shouldn't hurt you because most schools just look at your best score. Most schools just want all of your testing history to see where you improved and how many times you took a certain test.   I would say you have a good Chance at Purdue, UIUC, UMich, Georgia Tech, and the UC's. This is also dependent on what you want to study, as certain areas in STEM can get particularly competitive.   I would say the Ivies, Stanford, and JHU are toss-ups, as admissions there is hard to define or predict for. An important question to ask is why do you want to attend these schools, as some are great for some programs while lacking in other areas."

ApplyingToCollege,38xzng,scarceliving,3,Sun Jun 7 21:28:42 2015 UTC,Don't take this the wrong way but it's going to be really hard getting into college with that GPA. Consider going to community college and then transferring to your state's flagship public university. You'll save a lot of money that way too. A lot of people do it. Don't worry about falling behind. Everyone studies the same things during the first couple of years.
ApplyingToCollege,38xzng,engineeringhearts,3,Mon Jun 8 04:26:38 2015 UTC,"As I'm sure you've heard, with your GPA, you may encounter some difficulty in finding a college that will admit you. If you manage to research and find colleges that would be a good match, I would highly advise you do on campus interviews for said colleges. And note that I'm being very specific when I say on campus- sure some colleges do alumni interviews, but they are not often used in the same way in the admissions process as if you were to interview with an actual admissions officer.  Now, community college- not always your worst option. At risk of sounding harsh, you really need to get over the generalizations that you're making about who attends community college, because many do offer fantastic opportunities, and have students that are focused on doing what they need to do to get to the next step, much like yourself, ideally. If you want other options, consider junior colleges. There are many 2-year institutions out there that are a bit more flexible with admission, and some even have residence halls as well, so you still get a bit of the real college experience. I'm thinking of at least a couple in New York that wouldn't be too hard for you to get to.   With any option you consider, remember that with at least 4,000 colleges in this country, there truly is a college for everyone."

ApplyingToCollege,38xzng,PamTenUSA,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"Good SATs - although I would recommend studying and taking them or the ACT (an easier, though still challenging test) at least once more. If you can bump up your score past 1900 or 28, that opens you up to more options, and potentially merit based scholarships.   Your GPA is not as bad as it seems. College admissions offices weigh Junior and first semester Senior year GPA more heavily than Freshman and Sophomore years. Your improvement is good and your poor grades from the first two years can be explained in either you essay, interviews with alumni, on-campus interviews, or outside correspondence with the administration of admissions officers.   For next semester, you need to take a challenging course load. If you are in all regular classes, bump up to all honors classes. If you are in honors, take an AP or two. But most of all, get A's in everything. Take the SAT or ACT again, bump up your score. Write a great college essay. Visit the campuses you are interested in more than once, and set up meetings with admissions officers, professors, and maybe even deans. Show you are committed to change and they will love you for it.   As far as schools go - Rowan and Stockton are your best bets to be admitted right off the bat - you are easily in the 75th percentile for test scores, and probably right around the median for GPA. However, they are not very good schools, and it shows in the facilities and many of the students who attend.   Rutgers is your best bet for admittance combined with balance in terms of education, student life, and student body. It's also the cheapest school you have listed, and gives out scholarships regularly as well. There are negatives to attending such a large school, but the quality of education and research here is notable.   TCNJ is another option for in-state tuition. It's your reach school at this point, but is highly regarded and well known for its math, business and science programs, with some exceptions.   Basically, you are an interesting candidate for admissions, potentially on academic probation, to a good in-state University. Visit the schools you are interested in and show consistent interest to their admissions departments and you have a chance at getting in."

It may not be top 20 but it's really about what you make of it.  Everyone I knew told me I had great chances at top schools. The truth is no one will know until you get your decision. Your GPA is a big deal. There is no avoiding it and no way around it. My GPA is what held me down when I was applying.  You can have perfect scores, a 4.0 and great EC's and there is still a very good chance you won't get in to top schools. When you start to lower those factors, the chances of getting in decrease.

Conversely, when I visited Stanford, I fell in love. If you know what you want in terms of size and location, AND if you have visited some schools previously to confirm/deny your opinions then I would say visiting each school before applying isn't necessary.

Campus visits are exclusively for the benefit of the perspective students, and colleges have better things to do than spend time and money keeping records of everyone who has been on a tour.   However, if you have any inkling at all of wanting to go Berkley, make the time to go and visit. The benefits of doing so make the time investment worth it."
ApplyingToCollege,38phhh,ayybubz,6,Fri Jun 5 21:01:48 2015 UTC,"I work for admissions. We do keep track of who has visited. The fact that students sign up electronically makes it super quick and easy to link up with their application. We do not use this as decision criteria. We do consider students who have visited or been to events to be ""high interest"" though, meaning we will give more priority to helping them if they contact us, give info about scholarship opportunities, etc."
ApplyingToCollege,38phhh,ayybubz,5,Fri Jun 5 23:52:20 2015 UTC,"It should not affect your admissions chances.  As a former campus tour guide, I can say that visits are important exclusively for the student. Its like putting an offer in for a house based off the pictures, once you are there in person, you're going to find something you don't like or can't live with. I suggest that any student who can visit do so simply to avoid wasting time and energy applying to a school that may be a bad fit. In person, you get a better idea of the location, size, housing, dining, amenities, and design. Like house hunting (lets just go with this metaphor), you get to understand the trade-offs and compromises you will make during this decision. A school with great academic buildings may have crappy dorms, etc. Before you've been to college or at least visited one, these nuances are hard to grasp and make sense of. Students make more enlightened and balanced decisions about college after seeing what its like in person.   When schools are far away or you don't have the time/resources to visit, the next best thing is the internet. Scour their website, other websites, and even social media (great resource) to get information. Rule out as many schools as possible before applying. Some big factors are going to be number of students, having your major/minor, location, and housing. If something still seems unclear, call up admissions and ask as many questions as you want! Thats what the counselors are there for."
ApplyingToCollege,38phhh,kalefornia,3,Sat Jun 6 00:04:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think there's really any absolute need to visit beforehand, especially if travel costs are a concern. The only time I would strongly recommend visiting beforehand is if you're on the fence about deciding which safety schools you should apply to.  What's necessary is visiting after you've been accepted and are deciding which college you want to go to, just to make sure you'll be spending your next few years at a school/area that gives you good vibes."
ApplyingToCollege,38phhh,AllisonNelson,2,Sat Jun 6 00:53:32 2015 UTC,"I think it does matter in terms of deciding whether you like it or not. You might think you like the school based on what's on paper only to find you dislike something about the campus. Or you might find a school underwhelming but fall in love with it when you visit - that exact thing happened to me.   Also, for very competitive schools, visiting shows your interest. Schools keep track of who visits. A student who worked at the admissions office in an Ivy League school admitted to me they immediately deny students who don't visit (unless they're low income and/or live far away or there are some other extenuating circumstances). This likely isn't a universal standard, but you should keep it in mind.  Visiting can't hurt, and it can only help your chances."
ApplyingToCollege,38phhh,PamTenUSA,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, I found visiting to be a good idea, it helped narrow down my choices since I found some schools to not have an environment that I want to be around. Whether it was cause a sketchy part of the city was near by or the school was too remote, all played a factor. What really helped me was the one service I took advantage of. Ivy Educational Services helped by giving me a list of school that reflected the environment I wanted to be in and it listed them by distance from home. Check them out if you want any further help, http://ivyed.net/. But when it comes to affecting your admission chances, it doesnt. As in they wont count you out if you didnt visit but if you do visit, you can try an meet a professor or office staff an that can help.

What are you most worried about? Pick a few things that are important to you about a college, surely there are some. Extracurriculars, school spirit, nice dorms, class size, dining hall food, the list goes on...  Ask your student tour guide. Obviously they're being paid to give positive answers, but the more tours you take, the more you learn how to decipher what they say in a meaningful way.  And above all, hang toward the head of any tour group and sit at the front of any information session. It makes you look willing to learn, and most importantly, you'll hear the answers to other people's questions that you haven't thought of!  Hope this all helps!"

Also, since you'll have the time, make some practice programs for fun throughout the year. This will give you good experience writing code for the Free-Response section. However, when doing the actual practices write the code by hand on a blank(not lined) sheet of paper as that's how you'll be expected to do the FR on the test.

The best move for you would be to ask your psychology teacher for the letter of recommendation. Psychology is a science subject, so it's a part of the core subjects. It's more important to have strong letters of recommendation than to have letters of recommendation from the ""right"" teachers.  Besides, even if it did matter which subjects the teachers taught, psychology would be important to a pre-med program, as doctors need to have a good understanding of psychology so that they can determine if their patient's issues are medical or mental, so that they can get their patient the appropriate care."

ApplyingToCollege,38ejsf,AznKwokBoi,3,Wed Jun 3 19:49:42 2015 UTC,"""Ive never met anyone with stats this high"" uh huh. This is really the highest you've seen? Not to demean this but if you look in the chance thread or on college confidential, there are profiles that make this look like a joke.  11 APs isnt impressive. If he had access to them, most top colleges expect 10+. Although it is not neccesarily normal, the top students (10 or so out of a class of 250)at my high school had 20+ before graduating.  As I said before, no real programmer claims to know 10 languages. It simply isnt reasonable to actually know more than three or four. Knowing one or two fluently is way better than knowing 10 somewhat.  UCB and the higher up schools on the list expect much higher than a 3.5 from students unless they have big excuses which he hasnt mentioned so I doubt he has.  Tl;dr His profile isnt bad but to say he has a chance at any school he wants is just a fatuous thing, and you shouldn't be lying to him."

First off, I am fluent in ten languages, as soon as you learn the algorithms, knowing multiple languages is not that hard. I am fluent in HTML, CSS, Java, C, C++, C#, Ruby, Perl, CoffeeScript, Javascript, and a bit more I believe... It's just the algorithms that a person needs to know... The only reason the people at your internship know 3-4 is most likely because they only need to know those languages for their work, and have simply forgotten the rest.  I completely agree with you that I am below average compared to those going against me in EECS. However, my school does not offer  as many AP's and I can only do with what I get. I still am doing the important AP classes; I don't think AP Art will get me anywhere than a waste of a time period.  As for the GPA, I think we are on the wrong level, I can raise my WEIGHTED GPA to a 4.0 quite easily as I will be taking a ton more honors/AP classes rather than what I took in sophomore year.  I don't have any excuses for my behavior; I am learning from my mistakes from sophomore year, and I still have a year to prove myself ""worthy"".

No one knows the ins and outs of a languages syntax without lots of experience with the exact language(not just similar stuff) and I doubt youve been using 10 languages consistantly for that long especially conaidering how similar some in terms of uses. You may know how to do basic or even advanced OOP but that doesnt mean you know every object oriented language. Go check out the channels on freenode and if you cant do just about anything the people ask for support with you dont know the language. Also, If you cant list the langauges there is no way you are fluent in them. ""I believe a bit more"" come on, man.   Edit: For me, I wrote scripts in perl that scanned password hashes and then setup tunnels to specific servers and sent based upon the hashes(also released a few libs that included optimized tunneling methods and a new optimized auth testing method), and I still dont consider myself fluent in it since I had to look up specific socket syntax parts as I wrote it.   If you really do know even 3 languages, list the projects youve done with them rather than the fact you ""know"" them. That proves you know something and means tons more on an application.  FWIW, HTML and CSS are markup languages. Both arent technically programming languages.  Being fluent is much different than having knowledge of them tho. You may have knowledge of them."

ApplyingToCollege,38bfac,poopidydoopidy,4,Wed Jun 3 03:13:25 2015 UTC,"Basically, your major or college may be full therefore you are being transferred into the the college of general studies/arts & sciences, etc. This also usually means you are an undeclared major, and can transfer into any other college including the one you meant to be in later on throughout your years of college; an academic advisor would help you in fixing this situation."
ApplyingToCollege,38bfac,mistermonr0e,2,Wed Jun 3 12:22:54 2015 UTC,"This depends on each individual University, but I can explain how it operates here at Florida State.   All freshmen declare a major on their application, but for almost all of them the major they pick has no affect on their application for admission*. We know that there is a very high chance that incoming freshmen are going to change their major at least once before they graduate, so there's no point in using that information when reviewing their applications.   For your first two years, you're mostly working on liberal studies (general education) requirements. That whole time, your advisers will be keeping track of your intended major to make sure that you stack on-track to enter that major upon reaching your junior year. This process is called Academic Mapping. Each major has a ""map"" that you follow which will make sure that you complete your liberal arts requirements as well as any pre-requisite courses for your intended major.  Towards the end of your sophomore year, depending on your major, you may also need to submit a supplementary application for admission into the specific College that houses the major. Those Colleges (Communication and Nursing come to mind) do that because they often have far too many students interested in their majors than they can handle, and as such they need to have a competitive admission process. However, most of our Colleges don't do that, and instead they limit their enrollment simply by setting higher GPA requirements or with other similar requirements. There's no supplemental application for those, so if you meet their requirements, you're in.   *There are a few majors that do have some affect on Freshman admission, all of which are for talent-based programs such as Music, Dance, and Film for example. For those majors, you would also need to apply to the specific College alongside your application to the University. You'll go through an audition or interview process, and the College will make their decisions soon after our office releases your decision for general admission. If for some reason you get admitted to FSU but not into your specific major, you can still attend here, but you would need to come in with a different major.  And if you don't know what you want to major in, you would apply as an Exploratory (undeclared) major. Those students have special advisers that are experts in helping you figure out what to major in."
ApplyingToCollege,38bfac,FSUAdmissions,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:30:40 2015 UTC,General Studies is what mistermonr0e said. Basically if you work hard enough (maintain As and Bs) in your first semester of college you'll be able to join your chosen major immediately.

Aside from academics, the extracurricular scene at Harvard is huge, compared to those of peer institutions in my opinion; there's always some discussion on campus going on about how Harvard students are pressured to balance academics and extracurriculars. But anyway, it does provide plenty of experience outside the classroom, which is invaluable during the job/internship search. Edit: Meant to mention that I don't think Harvard is all that different from Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Stanford, etc., in terms of opportunities gained from attending.

So I avoided using those mechanisms in both my Common App and supplement essay and kept them concise and straightforward. By concise, I mean that every word and sentence counted; my essay was actually ~850 words, which I believe was 350 words beyond the limit.  I had great hooks (first sentences/paragraphs) for both essays and I incorporated my dry humor (lol) into both; in many ways, writing the essays was effortless since I didn't try to write in a style that wasn't my own. I just did a Google search and found this resource for essays (it's a paid service, but you can still view a couple essays); I think it shows well the fact that there are many different styles of writing that work, and they all successfully show the applicants' voices! Sorry that I can't offer a better answer; in short, I don't think there's really any cliche topic, as long as you can make whatever story you're telling your own.  Several teachers looked over my essays but I also had a professional college admissions consultant critique them since my high school had basically zero experience working with students who wanted to go to extremely competitive universities. I'd definitely start brainstorming essay topics soon. as for myself, I started my essay in late August, IIRC, and worked on them until like two days before the Harvard SCEA deadline. Aside from the writing, including the short writing section in the activities portion, the rest of the application won't take long. Best of luck :)"

I'm in the Boy Scouts of America, well on my way to the rank of Eagle.  That's about it.  Would being an Eagle Scout be sufficient for a college like Harvard? Also, would personal projects be significantly beneficial on my applications?

ApplyingToCollege,386wyz,thestationarystones,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:53:51 2015 UTC,"Would being an Eagle Scout be sufficient for a college like Harvard?    I can't answer with certainty—there's really no suggested number of extracurricular activities or anything like that—but I think having more on your application would be a good idea. Both commitment and leadership are important. Luckily, you still have a lot of time to build your resume; are you interested in any organizations at school? You don't have to feel extremely passionate about them, but you should definitely explore around! Some common ECs include debate, MUN, journalism, research at a local uni, etc. Of course, I do believe that the admissions game is tougher if you don't stand out as much, but I'm proof (I had mundane ECs) that it's not impossible. Also, it's not just me; I have plenty of friends at Harvard who didn't have crazy ECs, either.   Assuming the project succeeds, will Ivy League colleges be impressed?   I don't know if personal projects would be significantly beneficial (again, hard to say), but they definitely add character and make you a more interesting applicant. I think it'd be pretty cool to write your Common App essay about this, but maybe I'm thinking too far ahead.   Is there something more I should be doing at this point (other than studying for the SAT)?       Like you said, study for the SAT and also plan out which subject tests you plan on taking so that you don't end up having a large period of time between an AP test and its corresponding subject test, for example. Also, I say this as someone who's close to graduating college: it is so much more important to do well at wherever you are! The top Ivies are never guaranteed so realize that it's not the end of the world if you get into a great school that may not have been your first choice. :) Maybe not the type of advice you were looking for, but as someone who had a lot of pressure put on me to go to HYP, I wish someone had told me that when I was in high school."

I'm interested in hearing how your recruitment process went (assuming you've pursued / participated in internships), if you're comfortable discussing it."
ApplyingToCollege,386wyz,Impluere,3,Tue Jun 2 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"Long answer ahead. Also, I'm definitely not an expert on this stuff, so forgive me if I'm incorrect about some things! There are three main areas of recruiting: tech, finance, and consulting. Before I delve into things, I'm fairly knowledgeable about consulting recruiting and somewhat knowledgeable about finance recruiting; I'm not familiar with tech recruiting. Though, recruiting is a very popular topic of conversation at Harvard, especially when you're in your junior and senior years, so I don't think I'm too off!  The timeline for tech recruiting is earlier than those of consulting and finance; engineering and life sciences career fairs also happen in between, but Harvard is not really a target school for engineering firms. The structure of finance and consulting (and I'm assuming tech) recruiting is the same: career fair > ""networking""/informational sessions > resume and cover letter drops > interviews (two or three rounds) > offer. That's a broad overview, and not everyone sees the value of networking sessions or career fairs. Most of this happens through the On-Campus Interview (OCI) program, though there are many reputable firms that'll simply post on Crimson Careers (job listings). There are all sorts of job listings on CC; I don't remember the statistics off the top of my head, but 40% of Harvard seniors go through OCI (~20% get offers), but the OCI job listings only comprise about 10% (???) of the total job listings on CC. Personally, I've done research the past two summers, and will be doing a data analytics-oriented internship this summer. It was a job on CC.  TECH: The best of the best start working at the most desirable companies (Google, Facebook, Dropbox, etc.) the summer after their freshman year. From what I understand, CS majors who intend to pursue the tech field should really start building their experience beginning that summer, though there are many who don't start until their sophomore or even junior summers. Interestingly, I have a friend who interned at Google her freshman year, and she said she wouldn't go back because working at a big company like that limited her intellectual growth and there's no room to grow or move up.  FINANCE: Similarly (and perhaps more rigorously), freshman who intend to succeed in finance should begin interning their freshman summer. I do see several people, including a good friend of mine, who consistently go back to the same firm for their summer internships. It is very, very difficult to land a full-time job without doing summer internships as finance firms heavily emphasize summer recruiting; most full-time offers are return offers. I always thought that Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley (you get the deal :P) were the ultimate goals for students who are interested in finance, but I have a friend who's jumping into a private equity summer internship and his opinion is that those big-name internships are for people who don't know much about the different specialties. Take that as you may! Also, GPA is very important for finance internships.  and... CONSULTING: I did go through consulting summer recruiting but did not come out with an offer—disappointing, but fairly common. Unlike finance, consulting firms recruit heavily for full-time, not summer. Again, GPA is very important, though the threshold may be lower on average. In general, it's said to be 3.7+ for MBB and 3.4/3.5+ for lower-tier. Your resume will get you interviews, but how well you do on case interviews determines whether you get a second round interview and, ultimately, an offer. Students who land consulting internships do have a leg up for full-time, but it's definitely not a huge problem if you don't get one. I can speak a lot more about consulting recruiting if you're interested!  Sorry if this wasn't the answer you were looking for, lol, but I can definitely talk more about whatever you'd like."

ApplyingToCollege,386wyz,Impluere,3,Wed Jun 3 00:30:36 2015 UTC,"Dean Fitzsimmons, our Dean of Admissions, once did a sort of an AMA with The NY Times that I think is worth reading: here it is.  While it sounds vague and just something he's saying to keep Harvard's admissions criteria kind of mysterious (""So what really gets you into Harvard?""), it's 100% true. Harvard really wants students who have excelled academically and have excelled in the realm of extracurriculars. Personally, I believe GPA is more important for the average applicant (average as in having no remarkable, crazy ECs... like me). What good is being super involved if your GPA sucks, right? But on the other hand, why admit a kid with just a 4.0 UW GPA when you can admit a kid with a 3.9 UW GPA who's won national awards or something like that? Thus, ECs round a person out, if that makes sense. Your grades set the groundwork (""oh, we can tell this kid is smart and can handle our schoolwork..."") and your ECs and essays tell them all about you (""this student is smart, likable, and has passion..."").  That is my personal opinion and, of course, there are many caveats, such as a GPA that shows upward trajectory."

ApplyingToCollege,386wyz,DefenestratedRonik,2,Sat Jun 6 06:53:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry but I really can't give a good answer to this because I've never attended another college! In terms of rankings, the Harvard engineering program is well below those of Cal and Stanford. To be fair, Harvard's engineering department is pretty new but it has grown extremely quickly (and will continue to do so, now that Paulson made a record-breaking $400 million gift to SEAS, haha...).  I actually applied as an undecided major (only 0.8% of accepted students indicated ""undecided""!) so I didn't really realize that I'd be a part of SEAS. My particular major isn't really why Harvard students choose Harvard, and I'm still not sure I would've chosen Harvard if I knew that I would choose my major. That being said, there are many engineering students who choose Harvard over MIT (or other schools) simply because there are so many other opportunities at Harvard.  As for difficulty, again, hard to say. Without any sort of evidence besides my own experience (incl. classes) at Harvard, I'm inclined to say that Cal's or Stanford's engineering classes are probably harder. It's important to keep in mind, however, that many Harvard engineering students' end goals are not to actually do hardcore, real engineering, but to enter another field that involves strong quantitative skills and creative but structured, logical thinking!  Hope that answer helps a bit. :)"

Hm, very good but tough question. Personally, I learned early on that I'd had to try a hell of a lot harder than some people to catch up at Harvard since I went to such an easy high school, and that it's okay in the grand scheme of things to do poorly on a couple of tests. I think others have realized the same thing – that it's okay to just relax – so I almost never see SEAS people that show genuinely concerning levels of stress.  Most importantly, those who realize that SEAS isn't really for them have switched to other majors by now; for whatever reason, even when problem sets take like 20+ hours, plenty of SEAS majors choose to stick with it. I think there are only a few people who do it with such ease – you know, those people you secretly hate that get like eight hours of sleep every night, seem to always have their p-sets done when they come to office hours, etc. But everyone else... we're all struggling at least a little bit along the way, but not unreasonably so. Basically, the classes are doable (though it seems like our CS classes have a very steep learning curve; again, the people who don't want to struggle over it just choose other majors) and everyone comes out with decent, if not great, grades – it's really hard to fail at Harvard, for various reasons, lol.  Also, a huge plus that Harvard has over Cal, for example, is that our teaching staff is very accessible. So if someone is really struggling, there's no reason not to get help!

Basically will my essays wreck my application?   I'm not an admissions officer so I encourage you to ask school counselors and/or private admissions consultants your questions as well. That being said, I really do believe that essays are very important at a school with admissions that are in the single digits. The way I see it, if a ""normal"" applicant (like not a recruited athlete, etc.) has really bad stats to begin with, I doubt that an incredibly written essay – even if it is written so well that it could be published – could save him/her. But a large majority of applicants to Harvard are all very strong stats-wise and probably similar to each other, without considering essays – so why choose the 4.0 UW cellist who wrote a crappy essay over the 4.0 UW cellist who wrote a very good essay?  Basically, I do think that writing a poorly written essay can really diminish your chances. Are there counselors or teachers at your school that have experience working with students who want to go to top private schools? Any private admissions consultants (definitely pricier) in the area? For me, working with a strong private admissions consultant was incredibly important since the amount I paid him was nothing compared to what I'm saving by going to a school with good financial aid. I'm not an expert on essays by any means, but if you want, I'd be willing to give your essay a quick read and offer some general comments over PM.   And will admissions officers think that its really weird that I have crazy good standardized test scores but really bad essays with poor vocabulary? I know a lot of big words but I hate using them in my writing since they sure unnecessary. Also, will it look really weird that my essays are terrible but I got really good grades in AP English?   I doubt it. The style of writing necessary to get good grades/scores in AP Eng Lit/Lang is completely different than the style(s) of writing that make an application essay well-written.  Hope that helps!"

Our school has many students who go to top schools each year(we had like Harvard, Stanford, 2 UChicago, 2 Dartmouth, Duke, etc last year). I asked one of the Dartmouth kids to read my essay and give suggestions, but I think he was being too nice and didn't want to hurt my feelings. Thank you for the offer to read my essay; I think I'll pass for right now since I'm not sure if my parents would be too happy that I sent my essay to someone on reddit, but I really do appreciate all the information that you've conveyed and the time you've spent responding to my post."

ApplyingToCollege,386wyz,superdvader,2,Mon Jun 8 01:20:38 2015 UTC,"So I spent a ton of time on my Common App essay (again, I think finding some sort of private admissions consultant or bugging any faculty that has experience with that sort of stuff would be incredibly helpful to you!), but was done with it by the SCEA deadline. So... about 2-3 months on that. I didn't work on it everyday, of course, but it just took a while for it to come together. My Harvard supplemental essay took a shorter time but it was carefully crafted as well.  I wrote, in total, about five (maybe six?) essays. Not including the Common App essay, I recycled one essay heavily (the Harvard supplement) and another one a few times as well (it was regarding intellectual curiosity). The Common App + Harvard supplement essays took the most time; the others were easier as they were shorter.  Aside from the essays, it wasn't that much else! 17 schools sounds like a lot but it didn't take too much extra work. Four of those schools were UCs so one application was sent to four campuses; a lot of those schools were Common App + open-ended supplement essay so it was like resubmitting my Harvard app over and over again; Dartmouth asked for a letter of rec from a friend as its supplement lol; very few of those schools asked for an essay about intellectual curiosity... I think 2-4 schools asked for an essay on ""Why ___?"" but those are not very difficult to write, either. Stanford's a handful, though.  Hope that helps!"

I've really enjoyed it because of all the knowledge I've learned for my own benefit and I've started to write about how I've benefited from it and contrasted it how my peers do everything because of college applications, but I was wondering if admissions officers would not like my somewhat negative perspective of others? Somewhat similarly, I was thinking of writing an essay about me actually spending the time to learn in my class instead of cheating like all of my other classmates. Would that be too risky considering that our schools sends so many kids to prestigious institutions like I mentioned earlier? Thanks!"

You can definitely talk about how your particular EC positively impacted you and how you grew and learned from it, but I really, really wouldn't even hint that it was a ""better"" EC because it wasn't stereotypically Asian. Likewise, I think it's an even bigger red flag to admissions officers if you suggest that all your other classmates cheated, since you will probably come across as whining or complaining. I get it, though; I had many classmates who cheated as well, but college admissions essays are just not an appropriate place to mention that. Essays should be about yourself and your personal growth and voice; they should never be about comparing yourself to others or convincing schools that you were better than everyone else for X reason.  In short, as you mentioned, admissions officers will not appreciate an essay with a negative tone. Of course, these are all my opinions, but I doubt they're unfounded... I just have trouble seeing how essays written from such angles could leave a good impression on the reader. I hope that helps!"

Also, would it be reasonable to write about why I took a particular class even though it wasn't AP/honors by explaining my interest in the subject, how there wasn't an AP/honors alternative, how it connected to my other classes, how it affected me, and how it connected to my extracurriculars?

There's no guarantee that I would have gotten into Harvard in 2013 just because I got into Harvard in 2012. Likewise, maybe if there weren't other very competitive students from my area applying to Yale c/o 2016, I would've had a better chance. However, honestly, I think that if I had stronger extracurriculars, I would've maybe had a better chance at c/o 2016 for Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, and Stanford.  Well, Stanford's a weird one. I think they love very creative writers, which makes sense since they require three supplemental essays. There was a girl from a neighboring high school that had like a 2000-2100 SAT and swam competitively who was very good at writing (she blogged frequently) – she got into Stanford. She sticks out in my mind because no one else, even with better stats, got into Stanford from my area!  I don't know others' stats too well, but I'll try to name some other instances (all friends at Harvard):   URM (Hispanic female), <2200 SAT (maybe <2100?), rank 1, did a lot of science in HS (not published or anything like that), got into Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Stanford, MIT, UPenn Asian female from Midwest, 2130 SAT, very good public HS, leadership of high school newspaper, got into Harvard and Yale (only two she applied to, I think haha)   Can't think of more, but it goes to show that stats aren't everything!"

You should check with the registrar at your community college, as well as with the registrars at the places where you'd like to apply. Some places also require that transfer students must be able to complete their education and get a major within four years.   I know that a lot of schools are trying to attract people who have served in the military, and people who have had their education interrupted. You should be in contact with the admissions departments at these schools so that they can direct you to the individual(s) in charge of handling students like you (if they have any).   I think ASU (I assume you're talking about Arizona State here) is a match. You probably have OK chances of getting into UW and U of San Francisco too. Loyola Chicago and NYU seem like real reaches to me, especially when you consider transfer admissions are much stricter than regular admissions. I don't know much about UT Austin except that it is pretty competitive and likes recruiting in-state high school students. Good luck mate."

Even if you start classes in September, all of September/October can be used to get it written if you start right away.

But anyways... chances.  It's really hard to chance anyone for the crapshoots (top Ivies, Stanford) because that's just their crapshoot nature. As for the others, there are certain things some schools look for over others, and the GPA/SAT/pure stats sort of even out after a certain point. You'll probably need to get that 2300 if you want to get into any of the super tech-y schools (Cal, MIT). Carnegie, they really like passion for compsci stuff, so I think you have a pretty good edge on that. I think you probably have a good chance at Carnegie and UIUC as you are now, and maybe a better chance at Cal and MIT if you can raise your stats.  Anyways, holistically (you're gonna learn to hate that word once you see it enough on college websites), I think you ""match"" well with Carnegie in terms of their typical CS/math student profile. Match as in interests, accomplishments, etc. I've known undergrads at each of the institutions you listed, and I think your accomplishments seem to match the CMU kids I know best. That's just a personal thing, though.

In my opinion, the ACT is much harder than the SAT so your score of 35 is very impressive.   Do you have any other AP opportunities at your high school? Don't take more than you think you can handle, but it might make up for lackluster ECs.   The thing is, if colleges evaluated on just GPA and scores, you'd be pretty competitive, but in a lot of cases scores are more of a ""contributing factor"" than a ""deciding factor"" (unless they are either particularly stellar or particularly awful). You need to beef up your ECs to include more interesting activities. What interests you as a person? Are there ways to engage with your interests, perhaps in a volunteer or job setting?   Now for the schools:    Colgate, Hamilton, and Northwestern are all reachable, but only if you manage to beef up your ECs and write a killer essay. (The essay is particularly important for Hamilton, because it is a very writing-focused school.)  Tufts and NYU are especially competitive for you, because many Northeastern students with more competitive profiles are applying there as well. Unfortunately, your geographic location puts you at a disadvantage here.  University of Michigan seems like the most reachable school on the list (besides your safety).  Johns Hopkins and Dartmouth are reaches for everybody. To be honest, I would be extremely surprised if anyone I know got into those schools.

UW GPA: ~3.95 W GPA: ~4.88   Coursework:   Freshman: Honors Bio, Honors Alg 2/Precalc, Honors English, Gifted Critical Thinking (we had an extra test to determine the top 40 in the class, and those 40 took this class that was basically philosophy + projects + independent study stuff) Engineering and Design (I got college credit from this) and Chinese.

SAT: will probably take this fall, got a 220 on the PSAT without preparation as a benchmark this year to see how much I need to study for next year.

Definitely not going to be amazing but hopefully I'll get some decent results over the next two years) I know a lot of people at UChicago so I think I'll probably be doing lab research (biochemistry) over summer(s?) but definitely not this one because of China. NHS I write pretty often for our school's newspaper, mostly about political type things, could possibly be an editor senior year. Boy Scouts (tons of volunteer hours, leadership positions, going to be an Eagle Scout) I did marching band for a season but probably won't put it on an application. APUSH teacher is the debate coach and he really wanted me to join debate so I might do congress next year if I have time.  I'm interested mostly in biochem/chemical engineering/biomedical engineering, but I'm also pretty interested in economics/international relations and have thought about international law as something worth looking into. (Taking Econ next year and doing lab work will really help with this.)  Schools I'm looking at: UIUC (safety bc in state?) UC Berkeley (also in state, hopefully match) UT Austin (match? safetyish?) UMich (no idea) Stanford (reachy but hopefully I'm competitive-ish) Duke (less reachy than Stanford) Columbia and UPenn (crapshoot-but-hopefully-competitive) and I might apply to MIT or Caltech (ridiculous reaches) or other similar-tiered schools. If I decide to go Econ, I'll probably drop Caltech and UT Austin and apply to more northeast schools (probably another ivy/UChicago for the hell of it - those essays are fun! - and then maybe something like NYU or whatever.)  My problem is that UIUC is probably the worst school I'm applying to, and it's still in the top 10 for my biochem/engineering majors. Hell, it's number one for bioengineering right now. (I know the exact number doesn't say much about the school but it does say a bit about who else is going to apply next year -- all the neurotic kids who follow US News + World) But half our graduating class goes there, so it's pretty much a safety...right? Should I be looking at more safeties? Also, what are some other matches/ do I have too many reaches because I have no idea what ""tier"" or whatever I belong to?  I think my GPA is pretty low (considering my B+'s were both in math, of all classes) but hopefully I'll do better with that stuff over the coming years. (Junior year, having 6 AP Classes will boost the weighted a ton -- at our school, it's common to hear of kids with 5.3 or 5.5 weighted GPAs because of it) And my ECs aren't really too great in terms of numbers and stuff, but everything I do I'm very passionate about (except NHS lol) and can write about really well...hopefully that's redeeming?  Sorry for the massive wall, and thanks for all the help!"
ApplyingToCollege,3836up,Impluere,2,Mon Jun 1 17:07:24 2015 UTC,"Haha, that is a lot, but okay.  Scholastic Gold is really impressive. I think you will do fine. I know people with similar stats that have made it into the crapshoots (Stanford, Harvard, etc.) but they were like nationally-ranked fencers, and I don't know where you're at. If you're looking to go into biochem, etc. it'd be good to have some lab experience, so for you maybe junior year summer would be a good time. You seem like you're on the right track. Looking over your post, I'd also comment that weighted GPA is not that really important, especially for the schools you're applying to (with the exception of Berkeley).   Also about debate: pretty worth, although I'm not sure if you'll want to do Congress. As a three year LD/Congress vet myself, it can be very fun at regional levels (especially with graduating seniors who just want to wing it with a joke speech), but the competition gets quite cutthroat the higher up you go. Congress debaters pull off the most abusive crap I've ever seen, and sometimes you'll walk out of a round thinking, ""Damn, that was seriously bullshit."" There are a lot of things only experience can really prepare you for. Anyway, I think it does prepare you for real life far better than the other debate forms, but you might want to consider trying out another event first before doing Congress.  Now for chances. UIUC I wouldn't consider a safety, maybe just a lower tier match. Your current stats are great, but you don't want to make the mistake of overextending and not getting in anywhere. UC Berkeley's bioE is also pretty up there (CoE accept rate was 9.7% this year and highly self-selected), so don't flub your UC application just because it's a public. A lot of the others are very reachy, but they're also that way for everyone else. If you have the time, I'd say go for as many as you want to, but remember that in the end you only need to get into one of them. :) Don't forget to have a life, even when you're writing (no doubt amazing) essays. Good luck!"
ApplyingToCollege,3836up,TheNinjaTAc0,2,Mon Jun 1 20:33:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response man! I think our congress division is pretty small so we don't really go too far other than our state tournament. (Which we do pretty well in) I've heard debate gets ridiculous at higher levels. Also, our LD and PF teams are insanely time consuming -- they have practice 4 days a week, which would get in the way of a lot of other stuff.   As for the college stuff, would you suggest some more safeties? At UIUC I'd definitely apply to CoE, at Berkeley I think I'll apply to the College of Chemistry. (Where'd you find the acceptance rate for an individual major?) I'm technically in state for both of them, which is why I put UIUC as pretty-safe (if I go chemE, that isn't in CoE so it's safe) and Berkeley as match-reachy (in state but would be lumped in with the other ivies if I wasn't, ergo still difficult)  Thanks for all your help! Also one last thing: based on that list, where do you think I'm matched? Ignore the ivy stuff because crapshoot, but what about ut Austin or umich?"
ApplyingToCollege,3836up,Impluere,2,Mon Jun 1 18:51:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, LD and PF are more research-based (to say nothing of Policy), so those are best started earlier on when one actually has the time to balance debate and schoolwork. If you're good at delivery, though, then Congress will probably be the better fit for you.  I'd say just one safety-safety should be enough. In the end you only really need to get into one school. I don't know how it works in Illinois, but most of my friends in California consider UIUC (especially CoE) to be out of the safety-zone. Of course, you would have the in-state advantage, and you might not be applying to CoE, so the situation is probably different for you. Not being in your position, I don't want to end up accidentally pointing you in a direction that gets you rejected from everywhere. :P  I'm not very familiar with UT Austin or U Mich (typical Californian ""UC or HYPMS"" worldview c: ), but purely going off the online stats, I think you can safely make it in."
ApplyingToCollege,3836up,TheNinjaTAc0,2,Mon Jun 1 20:39:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you again! So in case UIUC isn't in the safety zone, you're saying UT Austin and UMich are also pretty safe? That sounds pretty good.  Also, if you know UCs, what UCs other than Berkeley are good for chem/biochem/bioE/chemE type things? I'm technically in state for UC as well but I don't really know too much about them in general, other than rankings. (Which I wouldn't trust as much as students in California that know the UC culture)"
ApplyingToCollege,3836up,Impluere,2,Tue Jun 2 03:05:48 2015 UTC,"Yup.  UC's: around here, the general consensus is that Cal and UCLA are best for engineering in general. However, UCSD is good for anything bio. San Diego's also got the supercomputer center (worked there for a summer, super cool), so if you want to do any computational research, definitely consider that. As for chem, it's not really my area of expertise, so I'm not too sure about that. But UCB, UCLA, and UCSD would be on my radar if I were you.  A lot of people around here are also convinced that the UC's collaborate on decisions (which wouldn't be too surprising), meaning they might accept a qualified applicant only to Berkeley or LA, not both (thus reducing the overall attending/admitted ratio.) I don't buy into that too much as I've known a good number of multi-UC admittees, but make of that what you will."

But you can experience the same achievements.    But you aren't going to accomplish much of anything wallowing around in ""on-woe-is-me, I have to attend a State University...""  Now, go beat up State Admissions and see if you can get into their Honors program, or a Scholar's program.  Get yourself some extra attention from faculty.    Inflict majestic devastation on some assignments, then ask the respective professors how they can help you discover greater challenges.    MOST professors like to help rock stars.

ApplyingToCollege,38133d,VA_Network_Nerd,3,Mon Jun 1 18:08:44 2015 UTC,"/u/VA_Network_Nerd gave a good description of what to do here on out . . . but you should know that lowering your sights for college was a terrible decision, because, if you're short on money, elite universities are by far the most inexpensive. Stanford, MIT, and Ivies are literally bursting with financial aid. At Stanford, a family that makes less than $120,000 a year is typically not expected to pay any of the tuition.  So my advice would be that if you really want to go to one of the above schools, you could always transfer there — and you would essentially have a full ride."
ApplyingToCollege,38133d,grizzgrazz1,2,Tue Jun 2 01:11:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats what doesn't add up.    OP says: ""I was a sophomore who was almost decided on going to top schools""    That language suggests acceptance & offer letters.    His profile, if true and accurate, is strong - though, no SAT score.    With all those community college credits, he will have to apply as a transfer student.    Transfer into elite universities is nearly impossible.    Less than 1% of transfer applicants into Harvard, for example are accepted.    The total number accepted is usually less than a bus-full.    In 2012, Harvard accepted 15 total Transfer applicants.    http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/6/21/transfer-admissions-one-percent/    MIT accepted 22 Transfer applications this year.    If one of these elite (private) institutions really wants you as a student, they have the endowments to make it rain in grant money.  I would have thought those acceptance letters would have contained financial aid packages that made things at least comparable to a state university.    Suffice to say, there is alot we dont know about this situation.    I stand by my original statement though.    Yes - graduation from an elite university is an advantage.    But graduating from State isn't a disadvantage either."

ApplyingToCollege,38133d,grizzgrazz1,2,Tue Jun 2 01:41:16 2015 UTC,"I may be reading this wrong but my college credits were concurrent, so I was considered a first time freshman rather than a transfer student.

ApplyingToCollege,3805mm,TheAmbitious1,7,Sun May 31 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think they look at citizenship or attendance, but you probably have a bigger issue.  You probably won't be able to get a good letter of recommendation, so apply somewhere that doesn't consider them. Your numbers look right around average for somewhere like SDSU, so you can probably get into a CSU (if memory serves they don't require letters).  The issue, however, is what your attendance – and, more troublingly your nonchalance at attributing it to laziness – says about your preparedness for college. You're probably a bright student (you've been able to do alright while putting in pretty minimal effort), but if you keep this up college will absolutely kick your ass."
ApplyingToCollege,3805mm,cr42,7,Sun May 31 22:59:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Your attitude of ""oh, it hasn't effected me"" is going to ruin you in college.

That's missing about a day a week. Come on! If you miss that many classes in college you wont have a friggin' chance."
ApplyingToCollege,3805mm,DockingFish,3,Sun May 31 23:38:26 2015 UTC,"Here's my rule of thumb- if it appears on your transcript, or anywhere else on your application, we're going to see it, even if it isn't necessarily a standard part of the application process. You don't think the absences may have affected your grades, but think about it from the perspective of an admissions counselor- I look at over 70 absences, and all I will probably think is, there might be a maturity issue here, which could lead to a retention issue.   After that happens, I may try and initiate contact with your school counselor, whether over the phone or email. And then at that point in the process, can you be sure that your counselor will have positive things to say on your behalf?  To get back to an actual answer, yes, you should assume that this is something colleges will see. At this point, you can't redo absences, so just be prepared to explain yourself if it were to ever come to that."

I would say, however, despite the lower price, you're more likely to receive more financial aid at Suffolk, but by sticker price, it's really not too bad.   Like jaredislove said, I'd recommend applying to both, usually around $50 per application. You're going to want to have multiple schools that you like in your application list; one might give more aid than the other, etc. If distance ends up being the only thing holding you back, I'd really recommend taking that leap of faith - I think you'd enjoy it! Just my opinion though.   Good luck!  Sources: https://newscenter.sdsu.edu/student_affairs/financialaid/tableundergradnonresident.aspx?"

ApplyingToCollege,37scr5,shadowvip3r,2,Tue Jun 2 01:03:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, so my mistake, I've got some better/newer information here now.  For the Boston Campus @ Suffolk, you're looking at around $51k a year, based on the source below. That's for new, incoming Freshman for the 2015-16 year (for a student living on campus).  Average award at SDSU is also $10,400, so assuming your need/merit is somewhere in the middle of the line, your actual cost will be down to $28,212. This might be moreso for instate students... but you might get some still, I've seen it before.   Average for Suffolk is $23,784, so despite the higher sticker price, you're going to paying $27,216, assuming you're again, average. 1k difference is pretty much nothing, so hopefully that brings up your hopes (and helps you realize college can be affordable, it's just how you approach it!)

ApplyingToCollege,37imj2,Iambikecurious,1 point,Wed May 27 22:30:24 2015 UTC,"some people go on service trips during breaks. I didnt. they tend to pump up their service, and if you are interested in that aspect there is plenty of opportunity, and if you are not interested in that then you will not be shamed. I worked over most breaks. The campus is dry during the summer (because of orientations), but is certainly not dry during the year. While some people consider the party scene at BC to be ""exclusive,"" i never had an issue, and its pretty common for incoming freshman to find a group of 8-10 kids and just roam around campus at the beginning. Most connections to parties come through joining clubs. The tailgating for football games also offers a fun atmosphere to the campus in the fall. The theology core is fulfilled by taking 2 semesters worth of classes. Some people find it better to do perspectives, which means that the theology and philosophy core are done at the same time, but if you cant dedicate 2 classes a semester to this program i would not reccomend it. There are plenty of options for classes. I took ""exploring catholicism"" which I found out was one of the harder core classes. If you talk to any upperclassmen they can inform you of classes to take. since there is really no way around this part of the core, everyone takes it I personally dont interact with students from those schools, but if you have friends who go to those schools it is easy enough to visit them, or go and party there. I had a friend who would go to MIT frat parties I actually spend most of my time on campus. But for fun there are plenty of intramural sports and club sports, and they offer various levels of competitiveness. I am also a huge sports fan, and you will find that once the hockey season starts up there is a game or two almost every weekend, which breaks up one of the weekend nights. BC does a good job offering various activities for freshman students in the first couple weeks, so i definetely recommend those, although it really isnt mandatory to go to the boring ones, even if they tell you to go. I remember skipping some internet safety course to watch a field hockey game. If you are on the newton campus there is also a couple of fields that you can play catch on, and you can borrow a frisbee/football/other things from the small recreation complex I personally didnt get financial aid (hence the RA position), but they say that they cover 100% of need (which they never actually define need.

Now, one thing I do not believe in, even as an admissions counselor, is to ""chance"" a student, even if they want to apply for the institution I work for. My rule in admissions is that unless you are with your admissions counselor at the time your application is being reviewed, you can never truly know if you are going to be admitted, and the reasoning behind the decision.   All that being said, I really do not know for certain how competitive you would be for some of your reach schools. However, I did see the response FSUAdmissions made in your last thread, and it looks like you are on the bubble of their average academic profile. They did make it clear that they do holistic review of their applicants, but then that just means that you're going to have to work hard to make yourself stand out in the admissions process. On the application itself, work hard on your essay and make sure it says something to your own unique character, and make sure to select recommenders who would speak well on your behalf. Other ways to demonstrate interest- visit the campuses. Request an interview, if you can, whether that is on campus or in your hometown. If your school/hometown has a college fair, go to that fair and meet the representative for those schools. If you don't know whether or not the school will be in town in the fall (we typically do not know that this far in advance), look up who your admissions counselor will be for some of the colleges, and send out a simple email- nothing complicated, just ""Hey, my name is JimmieLoftus, wanted to say I'm interested, let me know when you are in my area"" something along those lines. Demonstrated interest can play a factor in your admission to a college, especially if you are just on the cusp.  A lot of this is general advice that I give, but I think some of the smaller steps can go a long way for you, especially if you are worried about your profile as it looks now."

If you headed towards business I would recommend starting a little business for yourself in the summer if possible. I know that sounds a little crazy but showing that you have a real life knack for business is an awesome way to stand out to your reach schools. only do that if you are truly passionate about what you are starting though. If you are not fully invested not only will it not add the proper flair to your resume but your business will likely fail  If you are headed the econ route my advice is to seek out a professor or working economist and try to become friends. Again be genuine and perhaps a mentorship relationship could develop. If you are really into econ then I'm sure you have some burning questions that the professor probably would love to answer. Economists don't get to chat with a whole of people who actually want to hear about economics after all.  Good luck. You are doing great so far!

ApplyingToCollege,37g9za,BasedWalden,1 point,Wed May 27 16:33:51 2015 UTC,"Here's the good news! The UC system won't even look at your high school transcript as long as you're transferring with at least 60 semester units/90 quarter units. Your Community College GPA do matter a lot though.  As for figuring out which classes to take, I'd suggest looking at your school's IGETC Transfer Pattern. I'm pretty sure most community colleges have one and it outlines all the general ed classes you have to take to transfer into a UC.  Example of an IGETC Transfer Pattern  Generally in IGETC (as the one I've encountered) you would need:   2 English Classes (composition and critical thinking) 1 Math 3 in Arts and Humanities 3 in Social and Behavioral Sciences 1 Physical Science w/ Lab 1 Life Science w/ Lab   and a foreign language class if you haven't taken one yet.  Now this is only the general ed part of your major. UC schools would also want some major-specific classes as preparation for transfer. There is this wonderful website that basically shows you what major specific prep any UC would want AND compare it to your own community college's classes that are offered and see if it is equivalent.  http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html  This is a godsend, so use it well!"
ApplyingToCollege,37dqcc,YoungJasper,7,Tue May 26 21:51:19 2015 UTC,"I'd be hesisitant to call UVA a match school.

Everything else is solid."

ApplyingToCollege,37d82v,RockStarState,7,Tue May 26 19:47:00 2015 UTC,"You did graduate with a great GPA, but it's only from one year and means much less than 4 years worth of classes. Most students who end highschool with a 4.3+ had a 4.8+ for the last year or two.    What I would suggest is starting at a community college. It will give you a slow start back into school and you can easily go from there into a four year school. Community colleges generally require less information as many of the students are older, etc. Because of that, you probably will not run into issues register and such. After a little bit of time there it should be easy to go onto the four year institution of your choice and you'll already have a good chunk of your classes out of the way.    Good luck with your journey. I hope everything goes well!    Edit: Note, you may need to take the compass for community college, but it is rather easy. I don't think you'll have any issues with it."
ApplyingToCollege,37d82v,DockingFish,2,Tue May 26 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I'm pretty confused. I was homeschooled K-12. If you can answer the following, I'll be better able to give you advice.   You somehow have an HS diploma but no record of prior work was given to your HS? How did they place you? How did they ensure that you met the requirements?  Were you homeschooled through a program? If not, how were these grades lost? Many state colleges do require four years of grades as they use formulas to determine who to accept. I ran into this issue as well, but went to a private school. However, if you can't get a transcript from your dad (sounds like there are multiple reasons why you can't!), then there's not really a way to get one for your first 3 years unless you did it through a program.  To be legally homeschooled, there is often some form of notification to the state. Check your state and see if there are any records they have for that. This last might be harsh, but if you don't remember your HS years much due to the abuse, do you remember what you learned? Community College may be a good option for you in many ways...you can fill gaps, you can get a track record, and you can save money. Even more important if you're unsure what you want to major in or have as a career."
ApplyingToCollege,37d82v,TreehuggerMeow,3,Tue May 26 21:44:17 2015 UTC,"https://www.khanacademy.org/college-admissions    https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/applying    http://www.fastweb.com/college-scholarships    You can take the SAT again, if you want to.  Both KhanAcademy and CollegeBoard offer some test prep materials (Khan is free).    I would call College Admissions at the University you think you have the best shot at, and try to schedule a meeting with an admissions counsellor.    A Community College counsellor may be easier to access, and since the FAFSA process works basically the same at all colleges, the same answers will apply at a big school as they do at a small one.    One very important fact:  All of the student loans can be (and should be) in your name - not your abuser's.    If he signs paper that acknowledges what his income was when you were living in his house thats pretty much his entire involvement.  The loans, taxes and agony are all on you - not him.  Moving forward without any paperwork or signatures from him will complicate things, but you can't possibly be the first person to ever need to deal with this situation.  The Admissions counsellors know the tricks to move you along the process.  I don't blame you one bit if you choose to engage the process without any further involvement from him.    Your lack of a proper educational record is a challenge.  Challenges make us stronger.  You must be pretty strong by now with all these challenges.    Worst case, is you may need to start with a Community College before you can access a big University.  This is a minor challenge, and one that will probably save you money in the process.  So roll with it.    Spend some time listening to us theorize and recommend thigns.  But that the end of the day you need to Google up a phone number for an Admissions Counsellor and ask your questions from someone that can provide authoritative answers."

Enrolling for 2 years in a CC and then possibly transferring to maybe a bigger state or private school will not only save you lots of money, but also give you a better cushion to get into those types of schools.   Also, if you decide to transfer I'm sure you would find a good counselor at your school willing to help and usually most credits transfer over.   As for test scores (SAT/ACT), I don't think you need them to get into community colleges (someone correct me if I'm wrong here). Also, if you plan on transferring after 2 years typically schools do not require those scores from transfer students but you would have to look into what the specific school wants."

So it is fairly easy to google me. Once I was interviewing someone and he let it slip about a paper that I published. I thought this was kind of creepy actually that a high school student would spend that much time looking me up and trying to find a way to impress me. He ended up sounding quite stupid.

ApplyingToCollege,37bqr1,irishfragrenade,2,Tue May 26 16:53:26 2015 UTC,"Duke admissions rates each applicant on 6 dimensions: curriculum, academic achievement, letters of recommendation, extracurriculars/personal, essay, standardized testing. Each of these categories receives a 1-5 rating (5 being highest). Thus the highest score an applicant can receive is 30. The alumni interview accounts for a small portion of the ""recommendation"" category. I don't remember the exact percentage the alumni interview counts for, but I think it is probably less than 10% of this category. So on the 1-30 scale, the alumni interview counts for less than a half point. All of this information has been previously published, for futher details see this Duke Chronicle article: http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2010/03/29/application-increase-overwhelms-review-system#.VWSEDvldUj4  If you have a fantastic interview (score of 5), then it will stand out, as most alumni interviewers don't give out many 5's. I think I've given out about 5-10 over the course of my interviewing career, usually no more than 1 per interview season. But keep in mind that even if you get a 5 on an interview, a majority of whether you get in or not is based upon other factors (see Chronicle article).  To summarize: Even if you ace your alumni interview, it is not likely to count for a whole lot. But if you screw it up (like the example I gave above), it will create a lasting impression on the admissions committee."

The students we were able to offer admission to this year had the following academic profile mid-range. Keep in mind that 25% of our admitted students were slightly above this range and another 25% slightly below.   GPA: 3.9 - 4.4 SAT Total: 1780-1970 ACT Composite: 26-30  The GPA we use is the weighted academic core GPA. It includes all academic core grades (English, math, social science, natural science, world language) as well as any non-core courses earned at the AP/AICE/IB/Dual-Enrollment level. Weights are added to any grades of C- or above, with 0.5 points for Honors and Pre-AP/AICE/IB courses and 1.0 point for AP/AICE/IB/Dual-Enrollment courses.   We view in-state and out-of-state students equally, so don't worry about not being from Florida. We also don't differentiate between public/private schools.   I definitely recommend taking the SAT and/or the ACT multiple times, as we find that many students do better on one test compared to the other and also that scores tend to increase on the 2nd and 3rd attempts (after that, most students hit diminishing returns). We do super-score, so it's definitely to your benefit to have multiple attempts on the exam(s). If you do take the ACT, be sure to include the Writing section. Although it's an optional section, we still require it for our admission process.   If you have any more questions, feel free to reply or shoot me a direct message."

McGill has 40,000 students, many large schools in the U.S. Have 40,000 students.  Take University of Michigan, 43,000 students but had nearly 50,000+ applications this year.  So for about 6,000 spots they had 50,000 people apply.  McGill and Canadian schools won't get 50,000 apps because there are maybe only 1-2 million or so students in college.

If you really like math, you should try and teach yourself at a faster pace than you're being taught in school. If you can write on your app that you know math beyond Calculus and Linear Algebra, that's a big deal.   Everyone applying to MIT likes computers, and wants to work with computers. You can stand out if you actually did something with it. Start developing software. You could make apps. If they're successful, that's a big deal. You could contribute to open source projects online. You could mod video games. If you come up with a mod that tens of thousands of people use, that's a big deal. You could also start a business, you could do webdesign, build computers for people, or provide technical support. If you do all of that, on top of it being a business that you run on your own, that's a big deal.  These are just a few options.

ApplyingToCollege,37a3dk,VA_Network_Nerd,2,Tue May 26 21:32:12 2015 UTC,"All of this sounds good. AP Calculus BC is rather common, and while it will certainly suffice (especially if it is the hardest math course your school offers), many students getting accepted are studying far more advanced topics. If you're up for it, you should consider trying to study at a faster pace, either on your own or at a local community college.  If you're a sophomore, you're probably finishing up Algebra 2 / Trigonometry, and have Precalculus / Calculus I next year. If you're not particularly busy this summer, you could likely learn these topics on your own. Get some textbooks, either online for free or at your local library. Khan Academy, MIT OCW, and Paul's Notes are all excellent supplements. Ideally, you want to be able to say by the time of your application that you are versed in multi-variable Calculus, and you're studying Linear Algebra.  If you're interested in being a math major (or double majoring in it with Computer Science), you can and should go further. If not, ignore the next couple of paragraphs. Higher mathematics is rather different than high school mathematics. In high school, you're taught how to solve specific types of math problems. It's all meant to build up to Calculus and applications, like engineering or economics. Actual mathematics is different. It's concerned with knowing why things are the way they are, and most of all, it's concerned with how to prove these things. This might give you a good idea of what math is really about.   If any of this appeals to you, after you have completed standard ""cookbook"" Calculus, you should look at Calculus by Spivak. It's a great introduction to rigorous mathematical thinking, and it does so in the field of Calculus which you have just familiarized yourself with. From there, you'll want to look at some Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, and Set Theory. Whatever books you find, make sure they're rigorous approaches. You can find a lot more great resources for self-study here.  Best of luck. When you do apply to college, try not to get hung up on MIT. There's a strong chance you'll find then when you seriously research colleges when applying you're applying to them, that you'll find another school that is a much better match. I felt like you when I was in your position, and thought that MIT would be the best place for me. When I actually looked to apply, I found other schools were better for what I specifically wanted. If you do manage to put in all this work though, you will go somewhere fantastic, and it will pay off."

ApplyingToCollege,37a3dk,LegendaryGinger,4,Tue May 26 22:27:58 2015 UTC,"http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/its_more_than_a_job    That post is nearly 10 years old now.  I have no idea if admissions still works the same way.    The theme seems to be:      Make your grades and test scores high enough to prevent you from being cut.  Striving for a perfect score seems to be a diminishing return on time invested.  Try to display your interests outside of school through club or competitive activity.  Have something interesting to say in your Admissions interview and/or admissions essay.  Be sufficiently interesting that others would want to have you as a classmate, alum, or otherwise share in your success.  If you can't figure out how to be interesting, you might try solving cold-fusion or, curing cancer in your mom's kitchen.  That should do the trick too.   The MIT admissions blogs are a fantastic resource, you should poke around in there."

ApplyingToCollege,37aq89,SL0P3,3,Tue May 26 12:01:22 2015 UTC,"Nearly all of them. If you are well above the qualifications of a school, potentially expect a near full or full scholarship. Especially look at in-state schools, as tuition would already be lower, so it's easier for the school to give out the rest."

ApplyingToCollege,37aq89,SL0P3,2,Tue May 26 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"Yes they do  If you are low income, which may not be what you think it is, you are more likely to get aid via financial aid grants rather than scholarships. Keep this in mind when you are checking schools. What you are looking for are schools which offer more grant-based aid rather than loan-based aid.   Beyond this, I would recommend looking first for schools which are going to be a better personal fit, then filtering from there. What are your future career aspirations (if any) for instance?"
ApplyingToCollege,37aq89,BR0L0,3,Tue May 26 14:10:18 2015 UTC,"Right on. Basically, the lower end the school is the more likely to give out merit aid they are, and as already mentioned, that normally means low end privates or state schools.  Not to be rude but with a GPA like that, you're hardly competitive for the high end merit money. Many even require a 3.8+. The only thing you have going for you is the high test scores, so make sure you look at automatic instead of competitive ones, or you need to find ones that weigh scores heavily.  Here is a starting list: http://automaticfulltuition.yolasite.com/  Edit: just looked through your history and apperantly your income for 4 people is 55k. That is need aid level. You could get good money from them merely because your parents don't makr much."

I'd say you have a fighting chance at both schools, but don't rely on getting in and definitely apply to the U.Cs and other schools. I say this only because I've had many friends apply to Columbia and Hopkins, almost all of them with 4.0 GPA and spectacular extracurrics and heavy course load only to get waitlisted/rejected (A lot of them ended up going to other ivies though).

Ultimately, my goal is making Cornell, since that's certainly my favorite out of the whole list. I figure that I have a reasonable chance of making it, at the very least. I do realize that a large part of my list is a reach; especially Stanford/MIT/Princeton, none of which I actually expect to make (but hell, it's worth a shot if I don't make Cornell).

My cousin currently there had a comparatively very low GPA--just as many Bs as As in high school. He had a strong SAT score though, but obviously that is not usually enough. Even his extracurriculars weren't wow, he even was deferred and rejected from Wisconsin. What did distinguish him, however, were his essays. He wrote about coaching a little league team and the challenges that came with that--this distinguished him; he was deferred then accepted. So that would be my advice: write your essay on something unique no matter how small it may seem as long as it shaped you as a person. My sister who went to Princeton wrote her essay on why chewing gum makes you smarter--she loved chewing gum. I got into my first choice (pm me if your curious but I won't post it here) and I wrote about a very unique--but not world-saving or groundbreaking--extracurricular and how it made me closer with my dad. You don't have to change the world to get into top schools, but be sure to showcase your individuality and insightfulness in your essay! Good luck."

Oh and for the award at ISEF, I was a grand prize winner (one of the 20 'best in category' winners, which is the only award higher than first place in category other than the 3 best in fair awards).   So, for my school: Founder of programming club, run a local 'hour of code' program that has actually been fairly popular. We hit about 2 elementary and middle schools per month, and were ranked in our regional newspaper as one of the best student run orgs in the county.  Other club stuff:  World Vision (raises money to send to underpriveleged kids in impacted regions) - treasurer  NLYM (local volunteering org with about 200 members from around the county) - treasurer  Youth Leadership Collective (run programs to inspire kids to make a difference in their communities, I've given talks about science research and stuff) - treasurer  There is also a good chance that I will be a davidson fellow and a regional finalist in the Google science fair.

I'd say you're at around 8/10 which is ""great but not perfect"".    P.S. There is a good chance you won't be a Davidson fellow. I know people who talked with them for years and never became Davidson fellows. There are around 20 Davidson fellows each year and about 5 come from humanities projects(not ISEF/Intel Science Talent Search/Siemens people). You're competing with the people that you saw at ISEF that meet the ""collegeconfidential shitposter"" levels. And, it's not just them. It's the people like that from 3-4 other competitions as well. So you're competing with 100 or so of the best science projects in the world for 20 spots as fellows. You might have a chance but it is bad to be as confident as you seem to be.

To be honest, I'd try to cut down that list to things that represent you well rather than having a massive jumbled list.    Next, classes. What the fuck is APP? APP English 1? APP English 2? AP Prep?  Top five achievements: Academics(courseload is strong and your GPA is great) and uhhh nothing really else. Everything is is spread too thin. There aren't any items that make it obvious that they are a passion or that you've put more than a couple hours a week in, but if I had to list some, I'd say having art in an exhibit(this is assuming that it is a relatively high end exhibit) is awesome and maybe tutoring. Everything else seems like one or two day things or club/society positions that you've listed to buffer your application.    I'm going to list what I think would happen if you applied now: University of Colorado-Boulder:  Accepted University of Washington (Seattle Campus):  Accepted Colgate University:  Waitlisted Stanford University:  Rejected Cornell University:  Rejected MIT:  Rejected UC Berkeley: Rejected UCLA: Rejected    Keep in mind that that's just from what I've seen and that your essays can mean lots."

I never knew ECs played such a major factor in colleges so I did absolutely nothing during my freshman and sophomore year (save for ACE, which I'm genuinely interested in). Regarding ACE, I think that can be considered an accomplishment (since I've been in it for two years so far and work with them for 3 hours a week; I'll also be doing the presentation at the end of the year where all the Los Angeles schools come together). So by that, around two accomplishments can be inputted into applications, right? I don't have to fill up all the spaces provided. I'll definitely try to keep things to a minimum on applications to show a sort of consistency (such as Engineering Innovation, ACE (since it's engineering based), and the SWE Conference. Do you think that would be good? Or should I also include one bit of diversity (helping to establish and continue Film Club)?   I'm really happy you gave your prediction for admission outcomes.  Boulder, Washington, and Colgate were my tops (so I'm glad to have insight on if I have a chance of getting in).

For you, it should be engineering if that's your passion. Basically,  diverse but not scattered.

There is a lot available online to guide you through college matching/selection, financial aid applications, scholarship search.  Of course all of that takes time, so mostly what you are paying for is for someone else to do the research based on what they learn about you and then basically tell you what to do.  That can be worth it.  Also depends on where you are academically and where you want to end up in terms of colleges."

That being said, it's also important to find the right one, if you choose that route. If the counselor is professionally affiliated with groups like NACAC (the National Association for College Admission Counseling) or IECA (Independent Educational Consultants Association), then chances are they know what they are talking about."

If you're transferring into UA, you're going to want to do your degree there. Why? Because now you'll be getting into your 'major' requirements, and you can't usually transfer those.  You can do graduate school at another school, sure. But my advice would be to stick it out with UA for your bachelor's. Nothing wrong with that. I have a buddy in medical school that went to UA. It's certainly not going to handicap you, if that's what you're worried about.  Without more context about your end-goals, it's tough to give you better advice. What can you see yourself doing?

It's not that UofA is a bad school necessarily (far from it), but rather I just have nothing but bad memories here. I desperately want out of Arizona, but I know the smartest thing to do in this situation is to do in-state university, mostly for financial reasons. I had a dream to apply to UCLA, but with no ec stuff under my belt or summer programs/internships, I just don't think I'd get in. Thank you for letting me know I can't usually transfer the  major requirements, it helps.   So, applying for grad school at a ""better"" university would be okay? My reasons for wanting to attend something prestigious are admittedly shallow. I've never had anything nice to my name, nothing about me seems impressive on paper. I just want to be proud and make people proud.   Background is that I finished an associates in science in biology/medicine (basically, just got pre-med out of the way), and got an AA for psychology. I had dreams of med school but they're quite frankly not realistic for me, so I think I'm going to focus on psychology.   Is there a point in taking the ACT or SAT now?"

Is there a point in taking the ACT or SAT now?   Is it required for admittance into your desired undergraduate program? You can usually find that info on the program's website. If not, then there is absolutely no reason to take it. Grad school admittance usually requires a different test (GRE, GMAT, etc...).  Getting into UCLA-tier grad programs isn't impossible, but you need to start mobilizing your efforts as soon as you can. The aforementioned subs can help with that, but the most important part of the equation (after picking your field of study) is getting some research experience under your belt.

As for getting research experience under my belt: that can all be done in undergrad while pursuing my bachelor's at UA, right?

Glad that you're thinking long-term.  When you choose a major, think about what career you want. Don't study communications just because it's interesting; choose it because of the job it can help you get.

That, or start improving your relationship with them. To be quite honest with you, having a generic rec letter alongside all those great accomplishments gives a feeling that you're not as invested in your community even though you have a lot of potential. When high caliber schools accept you, they want you to be a part of them and bring them something that no other student can. Getting a convincing rec letter is important in showing that you will be a part of the school community.  Another thing to check with these schools is how they treat international applicants. For example, at Claremont McKenna (where I'm at), we are need-blind in our admission decision for all US citizens and permanent residents, but we are aware of the financial status of international applicants. This is important because we meet 100% of financial need. Most of the international students at my school pay full or almost full tuition, or they are absolutely amazing in some way that we are fine with giving them a lot of aid/scholarship/grant money. I'm just letting you know this because some of the more selective schools that are known for their aid may be less likely to accept you because of the cost of bringing you to campus (hence why a good rec letter can dissuade some of their concerns).  Finally even though you are a good applicant and may get in ED, you should definitely have a shortlist of backup schools to apply RD. THEN you need to check their application deadlines. Some of them have December 1 deadlines for merit-based scholarships (CMC and USC were among those when I applied). It sucks to find out on December 15 that you didn't get into a school, only to find out that the next best fit for you isn't able to consider you for extra aid because of a late application."
ApplyingToCollege,36pvhq,Awandyn,1 point,Thu May 21 09:55:41 2015 UTC,"International students, and even more so Indian students, are notoriously held to ultra high standards at the schools you're looking at. You meet most of those standards as do most applicants.  Your GPA is the concerning factor right now, and it could use serious work. Otherwise, your test scores are good and your EC is good. Consider doing more than the one big programming EC   and you'll be a slightly above average international applicant. The progrsmming is neat but either it takes up more time thsn I'm thinking or you just havent done much besides it in a while.  Remember that, even though you've done great, most people applying to those schools have done just as much. Expecting acceptance is bad as there is a good chance it won't happen.  Note: Please don't apply to tons of schools for RD without actually wanting to go. You'll just be wasting everyone's time including yours.  Note 2: There are many many ultra high qualified engineering/CS students from India that you'll be competing with so don't get your hopes up."

ApplyingToCollege,36p0op,evanb_,1 point,Thu May 21 00:06:58 2015 UTC,"Well, first thing, being a rising junior means that your high school accomplishments will be viewed after your undergrad ones. To be honest, at Claremont McKenna (where I'm at, also a great econ school btw, not sure if you're interested in Southern California but I can answer questions in a PM if you want), we focus a lot more on what you've done in college so far. Yes we will look at your application holistically and yes we will acknowledge that some shortcomings in your first two years will be from a school that you don't fit in as well. But, that also means we give every other applicant that same treatment. In addition, your financial status may play a large part of your application, especially in schools known for financial aid because they will be less likely to accept someone who will be on a lot of grant/scholarship money. Just things to keep in mind. You can be an amazing applicant, but not necessarily worth the 30-60k a year to a school.  Honestly, I think the 3.71 is fine. Think about it, it takes a 3.5-3.6 to be competitive for med school, having above that is good. Yes, it can be better, but that won't be the deal-breaker.   As you said, your college ECs are your biggest weakness. What you can do is find ECs within the community/city of your college, even if they aren't necessarily part of the college. Then, I would email Admission Officers at each school you are interested in and ask them about opportunities on campus for the types of clubs you wanted to be a part of. Then let them know about your struggle finding a place to belong within your current community, and use that to build up a relationship with that admission office. We actually remember these things, I'm not sure so much about bigger schools, but smaller colleges have a smaller volume of applicants and it makes it easier to stick out. Not only that, it gives you a way to talk about that in your application essays, so that you have some way of overcoming the lack of ECs. This won't work entirely, but if you're able to find ways to be involved beyond just your college community, it will make up for lost opportunities.

ApplyingToCollege,36k61u,SL0P3,2,Wed May 20 03:57:55 2015 UTC,It is not out of 9. I'm not too sure what it's out of really because IB classes are weighted so much. I have a 3.2(?) unweighted.

For the students we admitted this year, the minimum required ACT score for scholarship consideration was 29/30 depending on the scholarship. We will recalculate your GPA, and on our scale the minimum required GPA for a scholarship was 3.5 for some awards and 4.0 for others.  Our GPA only includes academic core courses (English, math, social sciences, natural sciences, and world language) as well as any non-core courses taken at the AP/IB/AICE/Dual-Enrollment level."

Right now, it seems like you have a lot of people confused as to how to interpret it, and all we know for sure is that it is not out of 9. Okay, we get that. So if that's the case and it is a normal 4.0 score, a 4.8 GPA is something you should be proud of, and saying that your grades ""aren't the best"" makes it seem like you're fishing for a pity party.  Same goes for your ACT. 32 is absolutely high, and you already have a verified admissions office telling you that you would be considered for scholarship at that score.

My school really blows as far as what it offers overall, Other than student government I'm in every academic club, including DECA.

Realistically, you should have some other schools in your mind that you want to attend.   Based on your GPA, that's a bit on the low side. According to this site the average UW GPA is around 3.8 and W GPA is above 4.2 for UChicago. Since you are a sophomore, you can still work on your GPA. Your ACT score is not bad and you still have time to improve. Plus, you still have a bit of time to look for other Uni that you'd want to attend."

Also I'm really, really awful at math and I study ~3 hours a day and manage to pull a C+ (currently honors advanced algebra) and taking honors pre-calc and ap physics next year is kind of freaking me out.

Here's an example: total course grade is 1000 points, 500 per semester. You get a D like you had in geometry. Ill use 65. Thst means you would have 325/500. Then, assume you get 93 in the next semester since you dropped. You'd have 465/500 and end with 790 out of 1000, a C."

If you're taking an honors class, before 2 months you're allowed to drop to the regulars class and basically start fresh. Since the honors class is working faster it's presumed you already have gotten past where the regular class is and you start as if you just started and you get graded from there."
ApplyingToCollege,36kx1r,Ultra_dc,1 point,Wed May 20 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"If retaking a class would really improve your GPA, I would get your parents involved and have them talk to the school administration if possible. Schools are more likely to decline a student's request, but with a parent there, there's a higher chance of getting what you want.   For math, I think a good resource you could use is khan academy. But I think some people's natural math ability just really tops off at some point, either earlier or later. I think you would know best if you can handle some of the material next year based on your performance this year. For physics, I don't really know what kind of material they'd cover in honors but I'd guess it's probably mechanics, newtonian, might have waves, possibly electricity and magnetism. I'd say that these concepts are easy to grasp if you have a good understanding of the concepts behind them, a good grasp at the math, and be willing to think critically. There might be a lot of formulas that you'd need to be familiar. As far as the math goes, they are algebra based so I think you are ok. Regular physics probably doesn't cover as many topics as honors so you are moving at a slower pace.  These are just some of the thoughts that I have right now.. It also seems like that you are in IL so there are some really great schools around you (Mid-West region) like UIUC or UIC that has a pretty good social works program based on this site."

ApplyingToCollege,36kx1r,fhekeg,2,Wed May 20 04:44:07 2015 UTC,"Stop being a whiny kid and take the grade you got. In college you won't be able to just retake classes(Well, you can but rarely will they overwrite the grade. They occasionally average the two or something).  Your transcript will most likely still show the D whether you retake it or not, so retaking does very little. A good grade in Pre calc is all you need."
ApplyingToCollege,36kx1r,fhekeg,1 point,Wed May 20 05:01:24 2015 UTC,"Why would using an advantage to my resource be a bad thing? Just because it isn't offered in college (if you fail a course you can retake it so that's not true) doesn't mean using the resource in high school is stupid. That'd like saying I shouldn't have wrote in print in elementary school and only cursive cause in fifth grade we wrote in cursive, even though it would've been illegible and my teachers wouldn't have been able to read it. Also, if I retake it the D will be on my transcript but my GPA will be 4.0 unweighted again, or very close due to the fact I have a C+ in Algebra. Probably a 3.8, which was mentioned earlier that my current unweighted of 3.2 is awful, so I want to improve that as well."
ApplyingToCollege,36kx1r,jkgao,2,Wed May 20 10:25:44 2015 UTC,That doesn't matter. Schools like UChicago care just as much abour your transcript as your GPA.  You're acting like a stupid kid.
ApplyingToCollege,36kx1r,Armpitfluff,0,Wed May 20 15:52:47 2015 UTC,"I understand that, so I'd rather have a bad transcript and a good GPA then both be bad.

I don't understand why what I'm saying is stupid, honestly, if you could explain I'm willing to listen. I just assumed that if they saw that I actually tried to learn the content instead of blowing it off, even if I took it again when I didn't have to, that it would look better. Perhaps I'm mistaken. Also to your earlier comment, I know and have been informed it'd be on my transcript either way but I want to learn the content and improve my GPA if possible as well."

I plan to apply to UChicago and DePaul, but I am really only worried about UChicago.   My high school GPA was around 2.8, as was my GPA for the year or so I spent in community college after that (along with way too many dropped classes). I've started taking some classes while active though, with which I have a 3.5 so far (just 2 classes but still counting). I've talked to a veteran representative at the university, and she said I could still apply as a first-year student if I don't want to transfer the credits, though they'd still be able to accept the transcripts to get an idea of what kind of student I am.   I have a 33 on the ACT.  I don't know if universities care about this sort of thing, but on my Navy advancement exams I have always scored in the top percentile, and in the case of my promotion to Second Class Petty Officer I got the highest score Navy-wide.   This may or may not count as well, but I am planning to become a Sexual Assault Victim Advocate at my current command. Given the current trends for sexual assault in American universities, I figure being trained in prevention and response might help my chances as well.

Anyways, I'm worried about my GPA, not standing out, and dropping from Physics AP 2 (which at my school was a combination of AP 1 and AP 2 in one year) down to AP 1. It and AP Comp Sci are the only two AP's I'm taking next year, but next year I think I'm taking three or four (AP Environmental Science, AP Microeconomics, AP Gov, and AP Psych).

Outside of that, I haven't done any other extracurricular activities and I don't have a large amount of community service hours.

(i.e. 10% Asian instead of 5%, 50% white instead of 63% white)  http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html  And I'm not sure if all first-generation Asians were born into families with lowly jobs... In fact, most of the first-generation Asians I know had parents that were all at least middle class. They all had college degrees. I live in like rural/suburban NC.  And I'm not following what you're trying to say here. Are you saying whites shouldn't be isolated from competition with Asians? Then why are you bringing up your conjecture that Asians are born in much lower income households on average than white people?"
ApplyingToCollege,36a6ys,youngmulahbaby36,3,Sun May 17 20:11:14 2015 UTC,You do realize that over 70% of the US is white so it's normal to have a college where the majority is white.
ApplyingToCollege,36a6ys,Ultra_dc,2,Sun May 17 23:45:52 2015 UTC,"White people get a gross advantage over Asians because of affirmative action.  I agree that blacks and Hispanics should be isolated from competition with Asians and whites because it’s true that they are on average born in low-income households and therefore will have less time for education. But why in the world do whites have to be isolated from competition with Asians?    I don't know how you think affirmative action works, but you're very wrong. No one is isolated from competition because of their race. Affirmative Action is based mostly on the ruling from Grutter v. Bollinger, which states that a college can take race into account when deciding college decisions, as long as many other factors are also considered.   For everyone, of every race, economic situation is considered. The Ad rep from brown personally told me (and other students) that they had a sliding scale on what they expected for the SAT based on income, not race. If you are poor, they account for it, not by not accepting you, but by not holding you to the exact standard of someone who has access to more resources. (Usually this is like, 4.2 v 4.3, or 2250 v 2300  as far as the difference given).  Also, your assumption that minority students are given help because they're poor is also flawed. Thats a stereotype and sounds like you're pitying them. In most cases, these are groups that are/were oppressed in many ways, and its a way to make sure their interests are overcome, and usually these kids are highly qualified anyways. They want kids who will succeed in their college, not ones who will fail out.  And schools that don't have very many Asians do seek them out to improve diversity. Just because Harvard doesn't the entire system isn't the same way. Its based on the schools needs.  I can understand feeling annoyed because someone of a different race got in when you didn't, but its usually about more than race. In the end, if you applied to a decent number of schools, its highly improbable that they all rejected you solely about race.  Seriously, understand what you're talk about it before ranting."

ApplyingToCollege,368cwb,owiseone23,6,Sun May 17 03:51:56 2015 UTC,I think you misunderstand how weighted GPA and unweighted GPA work. All of the GPAs are converted to unweighted during the admission process for the reason that some schools like the one you go to don't weight their honors courses or AP classes. Some kid might boast about having a 4.7 weighted GPA but the reality is that the school cares more about the unweighted one.
ApplyingToCollege,368cwb,Ultra_dc,2,Sun May 17 05:27:51 2015 UTC,"Adding on for OP: Any sort of comparisons will be done within the context of the school itself, in terms of ranking. Universities understand that a 3.6 student at one school could easily be a 3.1 or 3.9 student at two other schools, just depending on the level of competition.  If your (OP's) school is as good as you say, then I'm sure all of the top colleges know it very well – they have people whose job it is to know the ins and outs of these schools – and you have nothing to worry about."
ApplyingToCollege,368cwb,cr42,1 point,Sun May 17 05:39:15 2015 UTC,"Adding on to the OP add on: It also depends on your class rank.  Say you have two schools. At School A, the top 5 students have unweighted GPAs of 3.91, 3.92, 3.95, 3.97, and 3.98. At school B, the top 5 students have unweighted GPAs of 3.78, 3.81, 3.85, 3.87, and 3.88.  The difference between these schools is very palpable for colleges in that the high GPA mid/high rank means easier school and mid/high GPA high rank means hard school."
ApplyingToCollege,368cwb,SikhSoldiers,0,Sun May 17 05:54:18 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, I think you're dead-on in terms of the rank mattering a lot, and you brought up a really important point about school difficulty itself.   I think, though, that you might be oversimplifying it a bit in terms of what the GPA's mean in terms of the difficulty of the school, since we're talking only about GPA's and not about the (more) complete data set that is GPA, SAT's, AP pass rates, etc. Without these, it can be hard to tell a grade inflated school from a difficult, highly competitive school.   For example, if school A has an average SAT of 2200 and 80% AP pass rates compared to 1800 and 50% at school B, then it is clear that A is just an extremely competitive school with a lot of talented students.   If, on the other hand, school A has an average SAT of 1800 and AP pass rate of 50% compared to 2200 and 80% at school B, then it seems more likely that school A has a grade inflation problem (or at least that school B practices grade deflation, relative to A).   I know that even this, what I've laid out here, is still an oversimplification. But you brought up a really good point and I just wanted to try and give a more complete picture."
ApplyingToCollege,368cwb,cr42,0,Sun May 17 06:04:59 2015 UTC,"Of course you are right and someone would need all the statistics to make a good, albeit generalized, statement about a school.

If an admissions councilor was just given the stats of an applicant they could make the broad generalizations, or at least keep them in mind, while analyzing an applicant."

ApplyingToCollege,364kmm,AmericanSocialist,16,Sat May 16 02:05:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I think its bullshit. They have no real proof, and the numbers being thrown around aren't enough. SATs and GPA are just a small fraction of the puzzle - ECs, essays, interviews, recs all play a major role. You can't have ""with all other factors equal"" because there is no way to account for such variation and create a data set, something that the author in question admits. You aren't held to an unattainable standard - you are expected to stand out. Numbers aren't enough to standout. Its a crapshoot for everyone, and there are a ton of kids with that perfect 2400 SAT. Doesn't mean they have the potential that Harvard wants. Its very simple - elite institutions are basically making projections of what you'll offer them while in school, and as an alumni. The real world does not run on standardized testing. And if your dreams and ambitions and qualifications are the same as a dozen other kids, its not a smart bet to pick all of you.   Quite frankly, the thing that pisses me off about this type of stuff is that the people complaining are the ones that take prep classes and can have the resources to get what they need. I'm not saying thats a bad thing, but there are many asian groups that are disproportionately represented because they aren't part of the same socioeconomic class but are held to those standards. Its much harder for them.  I don't think this matters, but I'm Asian too. In my experience, the people qualified are getting into good schools - if you get rejected from everywhere you think you have a shot at, you need to readjust your perspective."
ApplyingToCollege,364kmm,poondi,8,Sat May 16 04:58:41 2015 UTC,"That's the argument given by Harvard.  However, since the process is so nebulous and essentially a black box, how can you be sure that "" ECs, essays, interviews, recs all play a major role""?  It has been my experience that many Asian parents take ""holistic"" to mean ""racist"".  When the stats are so skewed, it seems a bit dishonest to say, ""well you aren't counting other parts of the application.""  This situation seems reminiscent, wait....no...exactly like the 50's when Jews were excluded from top universities.  The same reasoning was given that they just didn't perform as well ""holistically"".  You argue that the people complaining have the resources to prep, get what they need; however, why do they still come out behind?  They should still have at least average essays, recs, and EC's.  How does a kid do extremely well in school, get good SAT scores, and not get a good rec?  Same with EC's and essays.  I can speak only anecdotally on this one, but Asian applicants seem to outperform their peers in those categories too with club leadership being dominated by them, doing interesting summer work, etc.  Harvard's argument seems to be a defense of an admissions policy that is purposely discriminatory.  When the institution receives hundreds of millions in public dollars and support, can we accept such a ""black box"" admissions policy?"
ApplyingToCollege,364kmm,poondi,4,Sat May 16 14:34:58 2015 UTC,"Your argument has no sound reasoning at all. Parents think its racist, therefore it is? And call me crazy, but I think Jewish people in the 50s faced a smidge more racism than we do today.   And yes, you are speaking anecdotally - the assumption that your Asian friends are far more qualified than everyone else is racist in its own way. Think anecdotally again - what do your oh so qualified Asian friends want to study in college? Most applicants are centered around science and engineering, especially premed, which has higher requirements in general. Also, read this article The problem is with the whole system, not just Asians. Asians tend to live in areas with other asians, and they tend to have very similar activities and interests. That means they would all fill a similar role on campus, and theres a limit to how many of them are needed. And you vastly underestimate how recs and essays works. You can do well in school and not be a dynamic or helpful person - teacher recs aren't just about work, but about personal qualities. And people tend to think that any good student can write a good essay, but most tend to think the same way and their essays come off as repetitive.   The college system is fucked up, but its fucked up for everyone, not just Asians. And playing the victim doesn't help anyone."
ApplyingToCollege,364kmm,Uneje,5,Sat May 16 17:06:47 2015 UTC,"So, what are you saying? That Asian Americans just don't have good ECs, essays, that holistic stuff? Really?

ApplyingToCollege,364kmm,poondi,6,Sat May 16 10:36:37 2015 UTC,"So tell me, how did the blind study work? They stuck a Harvard Admissions officer in a room and forced him to evaluate students? I've answered in depth above, but I'll add on.  People are not unique. I've found that the majority of high students think we're special snowflakes, and we're not. You think that there isn't some other kid who did the same thing as you, that every thing in your life is so revolutionary that the only reason they couldn't accept you is racism?   People are repetitive, and the problem that Asians face is a majority want to go into the same field, which not only have higher requirements but make it harder to get in. Not only that, but they tend to gravitate to the same ECs and interests. The number of essays I personally heard that are along the lines of ""the summer I went to China and learned about my heritage"" or ""Indian dancing is my passion"" or ""my parents are strict"" is ridiculous.   If you don't have a hook, a damn good hook, then you can't get mad that a highly selective school didn't want you.

As stated before, most Asian applicants seem to format as 4.0 GPA, 2200+ SAT/34+ ACT, music awards, essays about music awards or moving here from another country when they were young. The reason a Hispanic/black/etc has a better shot of getting in with these stats concerns the lack of applicants that look the same and just the lack of overall applicants from those groups. Colleges know the importance of diversity (which Asians seem to not care for with their belligerent fight on Aff Action) and admit on a rubric that follows that idelogy.

ApplyingToCollege,364kmm,rejgz34,5,Sat May 16 03:01:57 2015 UTC,"Harvard and other institutions aren't just saying that they don't want Asians in their schools. Asians are close to the highest race/ethnic group sending in applicants. Should colleges just admit student bodies filled with Asians? No. And the people on here complaining would say the same for whites, blacks, Hispanics, or any other group. Diversity and heterogenous student bodies are a critical factor in learning environments. If Affirmative Action still fell in favor of Asians (which it still does for smaller predominantly white schools), they would certainly not be complaining about this issue. It angers me to insane amounts in regards to the hypocrisy of Asians. If they truly believe that an education system solely ruled by one race is ideal, you are a moron. The cultural issue among Asians that causes parents to push their kids through insane amounts of pressure and high academic achievement (which dates back before Aff Action even existed) should not fall on the shoulders of other minorities who use Aff Action as a path to college that would otherwise not be accessible. Solve the issues culturally first, then come back to Aff Action. One can not doubt that Aff Action has it's issues, but to abolish it and then hope that a better program comes along to aid minorities is insane."
ApplyingToCollege,364kmm,LastWeekTonight,12,Sat May 16 02:19:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting point.  I don't doubt that diversity is valuable; however, it seems just a tad bit unfair to tell kids who worked hard throughout their careers that they can't get in somewhere because of their skin color.  It seems kind of backwards.  The intense pressure put on kids in certain asian families does motivate achievement; however, that in my opinion is not a problem.  Other minorities (and whites too) should be held up to those same standards.  We can't create a system that essentially pegs certain races as achieving less than others.  I remember the famous quote, ""Beware the soft bigotry of low expectations"".  Affirmative action as it now stands should be eliminated.  Universities should instead look at socioeconomic status rather than skin tone if they would like to create a diverse student body.  I think that's a system we can all get behind."

It drives kids to succeed academically and obtain amazing scores/GPA's/EC's/etc.  However, we shouldn't forget that all those things required a lot of effort.  Why should Harvard put less weight on that effort because of the tone of an applicant's skin?  If Harvard is allowed to continue discriminating against Asians, they should also discriminate against Jews as they consistently beat Asians in many statistical areas such as average SAT's, etc.  I don't understand why this form of institutional racism is still accepted considering this nation's history with discriminating against recent immigrants and ""foreign"" ethnic groups."

Asians have been in this country for over a hundred years, and those asians are significantly disadvantaged economically due to historical prejudice (Look to the Chinese Exclusion Acts, consistent discrimination against Asians in jobs, the Bamboo ceiling, etc.) ...and now academically as they must compete against those with more resources and drive.  Also, (regarding your cookie cutter example) if the race wasn't included on the application, do you think Harvard would take the student anyways?  That's the important question.  They already have a lot of those types of students.    I am totally fine with an application devoid of identification of race or ethnicity as that eliminates any prejudice.  What I am not fine with is a college admissions process that judges people differently because of factors out of their control.

I'm making a point against the guy being offensive towards both of us, but whatever floats your boat.   I'm reading through the actual suit filed. Its based off a study that the author of the study himself said wasn't reliable because he didn't have all the information at hand, which is necesarry. It proves nothing. Second, the problem here is that people say accepted Asian student scores are higher than the other groups. Yet, they want Harvard to accept students with high scores. They would be the first to complain if 2400 student got passed up for a 2200. More importantly, that doesn't account at all in any way for things like geography, socioeconomic status, or any other holistic component. The next study presented basically states that if students were randomly selected, more Asians would get in compared to now. Literally just straight numbers, not counting for the competency as far as deserving to get in. That doesn't prove anything, and quite frankly is easily accounted for by the fact that even less qualified Asians are likely to apply for these schools based on culture and the slim chance it works out. I know plenty of people like that, who throw in an application for Harvard because why not. Again, doesn't even come close to proving causation. This entire suit just hinges on academic qualifications being the most important thing, and everything else coming last.  Again, I repeat. The system is shitty, but its not racist."

If there are more qualified Asian applicants than the general population then it would make sense to have more Asian students ""If Affirmative Action still fell in favor they certainly would not be complaining"" I really don't see your point, are Asian Americans all one person? No. Therefore it's not hypocritical.  I'd bet 99% of the white, black, Hispanic, whatever students also had insane pressure, acting like this is an exclusively Asian problem is just relying on false stereotypes"

Congrats, first of all--you must be a pretty amazing kid, and you're going to have an amazing time! My year in Germany absolutely changed my life--I'm 31 now, and work in international TV :D. To give context to other posters--CBYX is a government sponsored scholarship that is not easy to get. (OP, I have to assume this is your program b/c AFAIK, there is precisely 1 scholarship program to Germany XD)  I'm going to give you good news and bad news. Good news: your essays will be great and they will stand out. There are many schools where having CBYX on your app will give you a distinct edge (more on that in a minute). Bad news: Some schools won't GAF, ie: you still have to bring it with your scores/the rest of your app for certain elite schools. And other than anecdata from alum like me, you won't really know which schools will give you an extra boost b/c of your exchange.  Now, Stanford is very into holistic admissions, so I bet it will help because you'll have great supplements. UC Berkeley could go either way. I could see it giving you an edge at Georgetown, especially if you plan on majoring on something having to do with IR/poly-sci.   My anec-data: being a CBYX kid screwed up my GPA (long story; my GA county sucked), and I took my SATs after returning which was a really dumb idea--my math AND English were rusty, so my SAT scores were acceptable but NOT as high as they should have been (basically, Ivies were out). Pro-tip: if you can still sign up for the June SAT, do it. If you're placed in a major German city with easy access to the train, you might be able to take the SATs in Germany, but I was in a tiny town in the middle of East Germany so that was not an option for me. Long story short: I added an addendum to my application to explain the issue with my GPA (ie: consider my 4.0 from 9, 10 & 12, not the pass/fail conversion fail from 11), and hoped the schools I applied to would read it. Welp, NYU, despite saying in their info meeting how much they value study abroad, did not GAF. Rejected. However, Boston University absolutely read my addendum, and absolutely read all my essays. I got in and got a full tuition scholarship... and, I mean, with my SATs? They were on the low end for BU. It was 100% the holistic whole of my app and not my stats that got me that. I'm sure CBYX gave me a boost. When I got on campus, another CBYX kid was in my German class--so BU, clearly, likes CBYX. (depending on your stats, I'd recommend it as a match school, perhaps)  A lot of other CBYX kids I knew went to their state flagships, but I think they would have no matter what (nothing wrong with a state flagship, mind!). My closest friend went to Barnard, but CBYX was her gap year and her stats were Ivy caliber. I'm positive there are more schools out there who will be inordinately impressed with your experience, and it will give you an edge against other applicants. You just have to apply and see.  Feel free to PM me with any questions! I love talking about Germany :)"

You could still reasonably get into a Cal State, do well and get a degree from there and apply to Law Schools. Law Schools are not going to look and are not going to care about what you did in High School, but they will look and care about how you did in Undergrad.

The only one I'd say might be worth ""throwing spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks"" might be Stanford: they don't consider Freshman year grades, so depending on how low your sophomore grades are + junior... you might have something over a 3.0. It would still be a longshot, but Stanford at least definitely considers essays.  But that said: you need to look at CSUs, and the least competitive UCs. Calculate your UC GPA and see what that is... don't try for UCB or UCLA (same as above: they reject 4.0s all the time; they are that competitive), but look at UC Merced, etc. That said: did you get ANY Ds in high school? If so, you'll have to ""cure"" those Ds before you can apply to any CA schools. Hopefully you didn't get any though.   What's your financial situation and your financial needs, re: college? Depending on those, it might actually be worth applying to some places out of state--sometimes OOS schools give more competitive offers than in-state. There's something called the Western Undergraduate Exchange that you should look into... basically schools in the Western states that need students for specific majors offer the equivalent of in-state tuition, even if you are out of state. There are some good schools on there, including state flagships: http://www.wiche.edu/wue. It might present an affordable college option for you at schools commensurate with your stats. There might also be less competitive privates that would be a fit for you.  As someone else said: law schools don't care where you go to undergraduate, but how well you do there (GPA matters a lot) and how you score on your LSATs. I'm confident you can get in somewhere, but it may not be where you are envisioning. Good luck!"

I would ask ""Would you be willing to write me a letter of recommendation for..."" Then be ready with a list of some of your notable achievements and activities, as well as a written record of who the letter is for and how to get it to them (do they return the letter to you or mail it? to what address?)

ApplyingToCollege,35ryeg,kittenclinger,2,Wed May 13 02:46:28 2015 UTC,"To be honest, you probably shouldn't need to worry until you come back to school in the fall. What you should focus on would be drafting a ""brag"" sheet of sorts where you list any and all of your accomplishments. This includes all the courses you've taken, any exams you have and their scores, anything you're involved with on or off campus, awards, that kind of stuff. You should also have a personal statement of some kind, in case your writer needs to call upon a specific moment of your life.  It took me quite a bit of time to write it, but if you have that ready in the beginning of your quarter/semester, your teachers will be a lot less stressed and will be able to write a quality letter for you.   Also, one really important thing. Don't just ask a teacher if they can or are willing to write you a rec letter. Ask them if they can write a convincing one. I've heard plenty of stories from teachers/professors that write stories for their students because they were asked to, without actually finding out if the writer knows them well enough to write one and if they actually can dedicate the time to do so."

ApplyingToCollege,35sbe1,FreeTheUniverse42,1 point,Wed May 13 02:37:40 2015 UTC,"What are your reaches firstly?  And your major? Mine were Syracuse, Fordham and Geneseo, got waitlisted at the first to and accepted to the latter.  Its also a big deal what your major is going to be to.  For instance Business (what i applied for) at Fordham is much harder to get into than their Liberal Arts program, and well at 'cuse the business program is one of the easiest (compared to the world renowned journalism and engineering schools/programs there).  Geneseo on the other hand is a smaller college and sort of all inclusive so the programs difficulty of entry were close to the same.  Let me tell you this to, dont make excuses and sputter out and die early senior year like I did.  I had my first grades ever below a 80 during this time (a 76, 71 and 65) im positive this is the reason im not enrolled in Syracuse right now.  i'll line it out if your school is like mine and uses a quarter system.  1st and 2nd matter as much as freshman-junior year as they are almost instantly sent woth your app.  3rd quarter grades will most likely be submitted before a decision is made, but may or may not be considered at all.  Final Quarter is pass/fail, once you're accepted to your choice with deposit down you can do literally whatever besides get arrested or suspended and the college WILL NOT rescind your admission at that time, o highly recommend focusing entirely on AP tests (if applicable) and thats it, this is the last time until retirement you will have this luxury. You can see I have it out for those who are still going at it 110% at this point.

ApplyingToCollege,35q3ks,steve_nyc,1 point,Tue May 12 16:25:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm really excited to do this.   I took the SAT in 2005, when competition was already pretty fierce and studying was the norm. I don't think that's changed much. What I have noticed is many students are switching to the ACT because they think it will improve their chances. Both tests have approximately the same difficulty, but play to different strengths. I took the current version of the SAT (3 sections of Reading, Math, and the newly added Writing) the first year it was offered in 2005. The addition of writing section didn't change the studying process dramatically, it just lengthened the list of things students had to study."

ApplyingToCollege,35q3ks,ZacharyHaggard,0,Tue May 12 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"Oh I see what you're saying. There haven't been any changes to the content of the test since 2005. The SAT is administered 7 times a year, and each administration is a new test. However, they often reuse questions from previous tests and definitely test the same subjects. It's definitely possible that they've made questions a little more difficult since then, but if so it's been a very minor difference."

The answer might be as obvious as ""take a diagnostic in each, duh.""  However, this seems to disregard the possibility that a student might have a lower starting SAT score than ACT score, yet have the potential to score much better on the SAT by studying.  How can a student tell which to pursue more seriously, assuming prepping fully for both and taking both isn't a viable option (or is simply plain inefficient)?   Are there any common characteristics you see in ACT-oriented students vs SAT-oriented students?"
ApplyingToCollege,35q3ks,SalmonBrah,1 point,Tue May 12 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"Good question! The SAT heavily emphasizes vocabulary, so a student with a large vocabulary should take it and a student with a smaller one should take the ACT instead.  Conversely, one area where the ACT is more difficult is the science section. A student should at least try a practice ACT science section to see if it makes sense to them. Knowledge of science is not necessary to do well on that section, but close attention to detail is necessary."
ApplyingToCollege,35q3ks,ksty1098,1 point,Tue May 12 18:24:48 2015 UTC,"Hello. Thank you for posting this. I am currenntly a sophomore in highschool and had some questions about the new SAT. As a bit of background, my school requires students to take the PSAT in Fall of Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior years and the SAT Spring of Junior Year. The first time I took the PSAT I scored a 166 (53CR+55M+58W) and the second time I scored a 189 (68CR+58M+63W). I really made a mistake answering every question on the writing section. I think I just got cocky and it hurt me. I am not really looking to go to a top school (I dont think I could get in anywhere really prestigious) and only have a 3.4 UW GPA. One of my goals is to beat my brother's 2090 and I think I am still a little far off from that. Enough rambling, I guess my questions for you are   On the path my school wants me to follow, I would be taking the revised SAT instead of the current SAT. Is this a good thing or should I take the current SAT at least once to try and get a decent score. My rationale behind this is that the current SAT is already a good way for colleges to weigh you against other students, so if a new exam were to come out they would have to figure out what a ""good"" score would be.  When should I take the ACT? I am currently in Algebra II if that makes any difference. I don't really know what level math the ACT tests. When would you advise taking SAT Subject Tests? The ones I think I will end up taking are Math I, Math II (if it covers what I will learn), World History (took AP Euro this year so I can probably just buy a review for world?), US History (taking it next year), and Literature (taking it senior year). Do you have experience with subject tests? I have the CollegeBoard SAT Review. What other books/study guides would you recommend I pick up for the SAT and ACT?   Some of these questions probably make no sense, but thanks for taking the time to do this."
ApplyingToCollege,35q3ks,JustATriangle,3,Tue May 12 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"You should definitely practice with the current SAT before the new one comes out. The changes to the math and reading section will be rather minor. The writing will become optional instead of mandatory for those taking the SAT, but some colleges will likely still require the writing section. The guessing penalty will be eliminated on the new test, so you should in fact try to answer every question. Take the ACT whenever works best for your schedule. Spring of junior year is the most popular time, but you could take it early in fall of junior year. The math on the test consists of arithmetic, algebra I, geometry, and a teeny bit of trig. You should take either Math 1 or Math 2, but taking both is redundant. Look up the colleges you want to apply to and see what they require. Usually it's best to take the subject tests at the spring of your junior year because that's when you will be finishing up with subjects such as U.S. History.

It is the same on wikipedia and on USNews. A school, like Dartmouth, that enrolls 6,000+ students doesn't fit the bill and is treated as such. Also, I don't know how you could possibly consider a 20,000+ person college like Cornell a liberal arts college. What is your criteria  Yield is a terrible indicator. BYU's yield is the second highest, and it isn't close to HYP. But with regards to people turning them down, they attract and accept different students. Most of the LAC applicants I know were completely qualified for ivies and yet chose not to apply or even rejected the offers.  Its not that they are less qualified, it is just that they are different. Every top 5 LAC could accept all 2300+/4.0/Science fair winner students, but they chose not to in the same way that most top schools do. They pick out the group the students that fit their school and goals.  Edit:  Since I was looking them up I figured Id link you to them.

ApplyingToCollege,35odea,LostInTheIvyLeague,1 point,Sun May 17 03:53:37 2015 UTC,"It clearly says that the 25th percentile of UofM in that link is well under 2000. Well, not well under, but to the point where it's not a ""good luck"" situation in getting in.   Also, I define an LAC as a college that teaches a Liberal Arts Curriculum. Check USNews again, and see that Dartmouth and the other 7 ivies are all Liberal Arts Colleges.   And even if we have to say that LAC's are less than X number of attending students, why would you think to use a school like UofM as an example, when they enroll over 40,000 students?   Now, assuming you didn't mean to call them LAC's, the fact still stands that the scores are lower at ""true LAC's"" because of the fact that those with higher academics on average are going to higher level schools.  Which means, OP is fine for great schools, and they'll probably succeed at some great LAC's too. But to say it's possible to hit the highest tier without the high scores is dubious."

Currently I'd give you this advice:   There is not a single school in the world you couldn't get into. Any school with a sub-10% acceptance rate is a total crapshoot but don't be surprised if you get into Stanford.   There are some schools here like UCLA, Cornell, GaTech, even Berkeley, that would surprise me if you didn't get in. However- I hesitate to call any of them ""target schools"". If you applied to every school you listed I'd guess you'd get into at least 4. Williams is a difference beast entirely. LAC's are the hardest to call because they're the most ""holistic"" but this would benefit you. Your class schedule and EC's are better than your ACT, which isn't as bad a thing for LAC's. You're also probably Asian and they don't suffer from diversity problems like some other schools so it wouldn't be a huge hindrance.   One word of advice is tone down your EC's a bit. Trim the fat, they're all good but you look a bit gratuitous. It makes you look fake and manufactured. Focus on the stuff you really care about and pertains to your interests, stuff like actually hours in a lab is better than some clubs you only kinda did because they look good."

ApplyingToCollege,35logg,SL0P3,5,Mon May 11 16:34:12 2015 UTC,"Ill recap the high and low points of your application.  First of all, high points: SAT score is stellar and ECs are good but some seem exaggerated. For example, the top 20 on one test may or may not be impressive depending on how many took the test and whether high end math students took it.  Low points: International student. That makes admissions much much harder. Lack of focus on mathematics/high level courses/international awards. From what you mention, lower grades. Also a low number of volunteer hours but tons if generic awards for them.  Other things: You don't list how much you worked or what you did. A two week internship means very little while a 8 month internship could mean lots. Also, I know nothing about some of those awards and assume many admissions offers would think the same.  Notes for you: You may not want to list everything you've done in highschool. The F1 thing that you did as a freshman may or may not be practical at all.  Also, make sure that you apply to safety schools and have a good way to finance school. I, for one, went to a very nice school and left with tons of debt and if I were to do it again id plan the debt out better.

Learning to recognize and then focus on this 20% is most impactful. If we apply this rule to college applications, think about it this way: Some efforts (like extracurriculars) are only nice to have, but it's not HUGELY important to the admissions decision.   Well, what's HUGELY important to the admission decision? Grades in college level courses, Overall GPA, SAT/ACT, and personal statement (check out top 5 factors to the admission decision here). Bottom line: All these AP courses are great, but make sure your GPA is VERY high for these courses. Also, it's great you're doing a lot of ECs, but don't let that affect the most important factors like your grades.  2: When it comes time to write your personal statement (5th most important admission factor), really make sure you give yourself a lot of time and find your x-factor story.

You could write a very good essay on culture shock and the depression that made you fall under, (EDIT: Specifically related to divorce and your parents) and segway it into how you've learned to acclimate and understand society, and how going to an awesome college will help even more.  Formal is like word choice - The one that stands out (due to the comment) is ""When I was at that age, I remarked""  Instead, why not ""When I was a kid, I thought that divorce was awful. All I saw was these ""broken families"", where the kids were split between their parents. It wasn't the way family should be, and I didn't understand it.

I'm also an Asian junior soon-to-be applying to NYU, Georgetown (dream), GW, and BU. I've also strongly considered applying to Oxford because in the UK you can earn your law degree as an undergrad.   Because you have to state your major from the very beginning when applying to UK schools, you also have to take an entrance exam of sorts when you apply, depending on which major you're applying for. For Law, you have to take the LNAT in September (this applies for both UK and international applicants). IIRC, for PPE it's the TSA (Thinking Skills Assessment). You HAVE to take this. Because we're international, there are testing centers scattered throughout that you can register to take the test. Your score on this will greatly impact your application.   And yes, I'm pretty sure extracurriculars and GPA are of less weight for US applicants because the admissions needs scores they can compare to UK applicants (as such, your SAT-which is amazing btw and AP, SAT II scores are much more important). The Oxford guide for US applicants states that the minimum requirement for US students is at least a 1400 on CR and M and preferably >700 on W; you're already more than qualified. Also 5's on at least 3 AP's OR SAT II's. Also, the UK uses a system called UCAS, much like the Common App in the U.S., where you upload all your info, grades, etc- you should probably make an account soon.   I greatly recommend reading Oxford's site for more information because that's where I got mine. The TSA exam has its own site where you can download practice exams.

It is obviously very very competitive, I'm not sure how well the track record is for American applicants but based on your stats, I'd say you'd stand a pretty good chance.  A lot of my friends applied to Oxford and Cambridge and a few of them got in. We study at Dulwich College Shangahi (which is an international school, you can google us. Apparently we're pretty good :P) and we take the International Baccalaureate , so my friends all applied through UCAS to Oxford and Cambridge with their IB predicted grades. Oxford may or may not request for you to come in for interviews in person or through skype. Obviously if you're interviewed your chances are probably higher than those who were not.   On other aspects of your question. I cannot stress how amazing Georgetown is. I went there for a summer college course this past summer and it was probably one of the most enriching experiences of my life. It sounds like bullshit a lot of people might write, but being from an international school with minimal exposure to how the American college system works, coming to Georgetown and taking classes was really an eye-opening experience. It helped that my professors for both classes (Intro to International Relations and Public Speaking) were amazing and friendly to students, as well as being extremely helpful during office hours. The surrounding area is great, Georgetown Cupcakes is somewhat overrated imo but when we moved in on the first day of our summer session we had free cupcakes delivered from them by our RA's :P and they do taste pretty good! M-Street isn't all that bad, no reason why you should avoid it :)  If you have any questions for the UCAS process feel free to PM me, I didn't apply to Oxford or Cambridge personally but I did apply for a bunch of UK universities before ultimately deciding to come to the US to William and Mary this fall :)  Source: Am a Senior, had a lot of friends apply to OxBridge because our school is over-achieving and very competitive.

Mentioning that you're a captain is good, it shows depth of involvement and leadership. If you think you want to join a club, great. But really what matters is time commitment. It's better to be deeply involved in a few things than be a member of 10 clubs you never even go to the meetings of.   And it also depends on what kind of school you want to apply to and their acceptance rates. Huge state schools generally care much more about GPA and test scores, whereas top tier are much more interested in you as a person (essays and activities.)

It's obvious you've taken strong courses but your grades in them also matter. Universities understand that you will not be able to take all 19, and you are being compared to other students at your school. Surely that must be above average, if not exceptional, for your high school (it would have been at mine). If you want to do science or mathematics, your AP courses look great. If you want to do humanities or history, you may have missed out. I'm not really sure exactly what you're asking... but taking 1/3 of your school's APs is exceptional, especially if you want to go into the fields that those AP topics cover."

ApplyingToCollege,35bkde,ChainsawCain,4,Fri May 8 19:10:50 2015 UTC,"Not exactly an answer, more like another question: Have you considered taking the ACT?  The reason I say this is that I know that I would have scored much lower on the SAT than the ACT when I was a high school student because of my score breakdown - I ended up scoring in the top 5% of the ACT (top 3% in my state) but my math scores were always significantly lower than my other scores.   Because the ACT technically has 4 scores combined to make the composite (reading, math, science, english + writing, if you take the writing) instead of 3 (like the SAT), if you have large margins between your scores, an exam like the ACT might give you a higher score yield overall.   I'm from the midwest, so the ACT was required by my public school, and most universities accept the ACT + writing for admission (Ivies usually require multiple test scores, but still, if you were to end up with a really high ACT score, that would definitely be in your favor)."

I'm really not so sure about the ACT/SAT comparisons, but according to a chart I found, your 2150 would be roughly a 31 on the ACT.   You have a really good score, especially if you're from a school where a score that high would really stand out. I graduated from one of the best public schools in my state and we consistently send a couple students every year to Ivies and even more to tons of prestigious universities, so my scores probably didn't hit outside the ballpark in comparison to some of my old classmates.

Never heard of Blueprints, most students do Kaplan or Blackstone The Bachelors degree will probably need to be verified by a credentials translation service who will say it is/is not comparable to US standards. You can get an idea by calling up law schools and asking their policy. When you're applying for grad study (anything post Bachelors degree), high school no longer counts. They only want a completed Bachelors degree.  Her college GPA is not good. Only unranked schools tend to accept students under a 3.0. Unranked schools tend to not have good resources for getting a job later and also tend to be very expensive. She may want to consider getting another Bachelors degree just to bring up the GPA. This is a very serious problem.  First thing she needs is to contact law schools and see their process for getting the foreign transcript and getting it verified in the US. Then follow those steps.

Every single one that I have seen so far has been similar to ""this is what I did and I got into the school"".

ApplyingToCollege,3537f6,CollegElf,1 point,Sun May 10 21:13:08 2015 UTC,"UChicago doesn't offer an undergrad program at Booth. I would look at UMich, UPenn, and WashU as possibilities."
ApplyingToCollege,3537f6,freshstart02,-2,Thu May 14 07:42:48 2015 UTC,I was considering UPenn but do you really think I could make it in? Isnt it Ivy
ApplyingToCollege,3537f6,SL0P3,2,Wed May 6 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"The same issue is there for all high end schools. Your GPA is very low for these schools. It's in the ""so low you'd need magic"" level. For example, only 4% of undergraduate students at UPenn have under a 3.5 unweighted GPA. Even for the lower end of the top schools(UMich) it is still only 5% that have under a 3.5.  More students at UMich scored between a 18-23 on the ACT's math section than had under a 3.5. That should make it pretty obvious that it'll be a struggle.  Obviously if you're trying to be in that really small part(5% or so of students) that gets in with a sub 3.5 you'll need something very very special e.g. Malala Yousafzai or something similar to get yourself in.    What I would recommend doing is working on small schools that provide scholarship money for NMF/30+ ACT. The only issue with that is that you generally have to have a 3.5+ get any of the scholarships.    Good luck!"

ApplyingToCollege,3537f6,That_Duck,1 point,Tue May 12 10:45:53 2015 UTC,"You almost guaranteed will not get into UChicago (your GPA is too low.) To be frank, your GPA is pretty low in general. I don't know what other EC's you've done, but if Eagle Scout is all, then I hate to be brutal, but it's very unlikely you will get into a top school.  But don't give up hope! There are plenty of other good schools. UIUC is a good school, but I don't know much about it's business. UNC Chapel Hill would be worth looking at, but you are an out of stater and with your GPA, it will be difficult, very difficult to get in.  Boston University is another worth looking at. NYU has a good business program.   I had a 35 ACT, 3.9 GPA with 6 leadership roles, varsity tennis, extremely, extremely high level of piano, 2 800 SAT subject tests, 300 volunteer hours, AP Scholar with Distinction, numerous leadership, science, and service awards, and I didn't get into a single Ivy (I'm going to Berkeley, which is still a great school. Go Bears!). Granted I am Asian, and I wrote my essay about a cliche topic even though it was well-written. Anyway, that's not the point. I don't mean to brag about myself, but I want you to realize to not get attached to the sexy Ivy League brand name or similar level schools (UChicago, MIT, Stanford). There are many other schools great for your undergraduate education, and there is always graduate school. Graduate school is more important when you look for a job anyway."

It truly means a lot!"
ApplyingToCollege,3522v3,ronter95,2,Wed May 6 14:34:36 2015 UTC,"No AP courses are going to be 'necessary' for their program. However, two things:  1) As a general rule of thumb take as many AP's as possible because it looks good.  2) There are three AP courses that you will ABSOLUTELY 100% WANT TO TAKE AND GET 5's on.  In order of importance these are:  a) AP Chemistry  b) AP Calculus BC  c) AP Physics C: Mechanics  Calculus and Physics are pretty self explanatory, but you may be wondering, why AP Chemistry? Well, sit down son and I'll tell you why. Every freshman STEM major (this includes biology, chemistry, physics, math, compsci, mechanical/electrical/computer/bio/civil/aero-engineering) has to take the first class in the chemistry sequence. YOU. DO. NOT. WANT. TO. TAKE. THIS. CLASS. It is easily the worst, most over-crowded, most depressing, most apathetic, and most poorly taught class in college because literally HALF your college takes it so it's like a factory line-they're just trying to get people in and out of it. Learning in that class is impossible because you're probably sitting in the back of the, enormous, lecture hall squeezed between a couple of chumps-since all the good seats in the first four rows were taken an hour before class started-and you can't hear because of the stupid biology-major sorority bitches yammering about all the cock they sucked last night.   Or at least that's what my friends tell me, I wouldn't know because I avoided that fate because I TOOK THE GODDAMN AP CHEM TEST.   Also, you might want to take AP Compsci just so you know a bit about what you are doing when you get to school. Honestly though, if you want to do compsci, don't do it at Iowa State. There's probably nothing wrong with the department, but, compsci is so saturated right now that if entering the market is incredibly tough. If you want to find work out of college I would recommend going to somewhere in california, specifically near silicon valley, texas, specifically near Austin, or the east coast. Do not go to a college in the Midwest.   *Edit: Also, don't take AB calc. It's a stupid move for future STEM majors because you have to take the equivalent of BC Calculus+ your freshman year anyways. Might as well just take BC, it's not really that much more difficult."
ApplyingToCollege,351ove,NoorThePoor,3,Wed May 6 11:11:17 2015 UTC,"Take it from someone who's been in your shoes:  Out of the exams you say you are doing there are two that matter:  AP Calculus AB, AP Physics C  Out of the exams you say are optional one matters:   AP Chemistry  If I had to list your exams in from greatest to least importance:  AP Chemistry  AP Calculus AB  AP Physics C  Everything else  If your school is worth its salt then every freshman STEM major has to take the first general chemistry class. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE IN THIS CLASS. It is enormous, the professors are apathetic, and it is just a shitshow in general because a full third of the class doesn't want to be there and is going to transfer into business next quarter. Every freshman STEM major also has to take the first Calculus class too. Trust me when I say you want to take this class even less than you want to take the first Chem course. I've talked to professors at my school who teach Math 11 (Calc I) and they treat it like daycare because half the class is going to spend the entire three quarters (California school so we are on a trimester schedule) repeatedly failing this class.   Also, and this is something high schools never tell you, but taking AB Calculus if you are interested in a STEM major is just a dumb move. Why? Because once you get to college will have to take the equivalent of BC calculus+ your first year so you might as well take it as a senior so you can get to the interesting stuff.   In regards to AP CompSci. It doesn't matter. Sure if you get a 5 you'll skip the freshman programming class that pretty much everyone takes but that is nowhere near as important as saving yourself from the horrors of Chem and Math 11.   The rest of your tests are just going to be resume padder and elective credit to determine when your enroll appointment date is. Granted, you definitely shouldn't underestimate the importance of your enrollment date, I'm a first year student who came in as a sophomore, is now a junior, and after fall quarter will be a senior, because I had so much credit. This means that I get to sign up for classes A LOT earlier than my peers, which is crucial when we are competing for the same lectures and best teachers."

After finishing up the first half of AP Spanish in my junior year, I decided I wanted to switch to French, just for fun. So during the summer, I took intro French at my local college. I am a serious language person, and it was great fun to be sitting next to adults who were learning the same thing as me. I didn't need to take French, but I wanted to, and a little proactivity based on interest is never a bad thing."

ApplyingToCollege,34w0xz,maroonrice,1 point,Tue May 5 21:55:54 2015 UTC,For sure. The thing with UF though is that admissions are unpredictable.

TBH though, if you really have the extracurrilars to get into a school like MIT, i cant imagine a bad calc score will hold you back, as long as you do well on the sat/act and subject tests."

A 3.75 is pretty low for Vandy and Cornell. And UChicago is one of the 5 hardest schools to get into in the country, so your shot there is low as well. I think you should apply to them all, but limit your reaches and have more safeties/targets. Depending on your major, I'd look at Emory, UC's, BC, NYU, etc. Plus your SAT is waaaay to low.

There is someone over at /r/Cornell who got in with a 1900 and 3.1 after doing the summer college. I'm applying to Chicago for shits and gigs, not because I think I can get in.

I applied to 25 schools myself and at least 10 of them could be considered high reaches. And the thing about summer colleges is that colleges might say that it will be considered in their application, there isn't even a spot to check off whether or not you attended such a program on the commonapp. It's just something colleges say for more money, so be careful about doing that. I'd recommend you pursue an internship or do some research (in a lab and then apply to Intel/Siemens) instead of doing the summer college.

ApplyingToCollege,34sfxf,minerny,2,Mon May 4 04:09:38 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to start off by saying keep up the good work! You're definitely putting forth a great amount of effort so keep it up!  That being said, Duke is obviously one of the most selective schools in the country. However, if you keep improving your GPA every semester and get an ACT of at least 32, you should be a very competitive candidate at Duke. Definitely keep up your involvement in school and extracurriculars too!   On a last note, if Duke is your top choice, applying ED will significantly increase your chances of getting in.   Hope this helps!"
ApplyingToCollege,34sfxf,big_ears21,1 point,Mon May 4 04:50:21 2015 UTC,"The majority of high school students go about college admissions all wrong. It's fine that Duke is your dream school, but think deeper into why that is. Intentionally reflect (whether that be through thinking or writing) about why Duke is the right college for you. With the rising number of international applicants trying to secure spots at american universities, and heated competition over our nation's collegiate elite, you're going to be facing tough odds no matter what. The only way to get away from this harrowing truth is to stay true to yourself and your own academic mission.   Since you're a sophomore, you have the chance to prepare heavily and ace your standardized testing. Aim to get at least a 30 ACT or 2100 SAT to be a safely competitive applicant to a school like Duke. You'll also want to be in the top 10% of your class...maybe even better depending on your school's demographics.  Remember this: the students that actually get into their dream schools are the ones who really understand what this whole process is about. It's about doing your absolute best, pushing yourself to grow, and doing what comes naturally (albeit with some necessary hard work). You can go onto CollegeConfidential and talk about stats all day, but nowadays, what counts in the eyes of admissions officers is who you are and what you can offer as a person. Yes, it's necessary to be within a competitive range of scores, GPA, what not.... but you have to look past that. It all comes down to the fact that you want to go to Duke for a reason, and you simply need to develop/demonstrate that/those reason(s). Hope this helps. All the best. Never give up on the dream."

Also, it's awesome that your GPA is pretty good. Make sure to continue improving that, because there's room for improvement. More importantly, universities like to see improvement over time. Look at the 2nd graphic in this link. It tells you cold, hard data about the factors that are critical in the admissions process. The top five critical decision factors will be determined around your junior year, when you'll start taking more challenging coursework and take the SAT or ACT. You should definitely beef up these top five admission factors as they will be the most impactful."

To be frank, getting a 32 on the ACT or getting a 2100 is not enough for Duke, and although it is considered ""competitive"", it is ""competitive"" in the loosest sense. There is really not much competitive about a 32, to be frank, even though this seems harsh. I highly encourage you to to get a 34, preferably 35+ to actually have a realistic, competitive chance. Those who get in with a 32 are the exception, and you shouldn't rely on being one of the lucky few. Your GPA looks good to go! Your EC's look good, but I'd recommend you to find some more activities that really correlate with what you want to do when you grow up.

As long as you're taking those courses, you can be any major you want to be; I doubt there's a real transfer process involved. For example, at Harvard, there are many humanities/social sciences majors that plan on attending medical school in the future and are thus taking all of the required pre-med courses. Of course, majoring in a science means your required courses for the major overlap with pre-med requirements, which is one of the reasons why tons of pre-meds are also science majors."

A 36 is the highest the ACT goes which makes it equivalent to the highest score on the SAT: a 2400. So a 31 is roughly equivalent to a 2070 on the SAT and a 1600 is roughly equivalent to a 24 on the ACT. I would definitely send out the ACT over the SAT.   But before you pay to do this, there can be a workaround to not have to pay to send scores. Ask your highschool guidance counsellor if your ACT and SAT scores are on your official transcript. If they aren't, then sorry, you're out of luck. But if they are included, then check if any of the colleges will take test scores from official high school transcripts. I know the colleges I applied to did, so at least some of the ones you will apply to take them this way. This will either totally eliminate the need to pay to send scores or at least reduce the cost.   Edit: Also, I noticed that you only included the verbal (reading) and math sections of the ACT.  Even if the colleges you apply to only look at those sections, in order to compare the ACT and SAT correctly you need to include your writing score.

The majority of the schools that I am looking at consider only the CR+M so I saw no need to include the writing(although it was a 780 FWIW).  Also, the reason I mentioned specific scores is because of schools that look at the score distribution. For example, Georgia Tech only looks at English, Writing and Math on the ACT, and some others emphasize specific sections e.g. MIT wants to see high math scores. I was wondering if it's better for me to send the scores that show my strengths or the ones that are considered ""higher"".  Also, here is a link to the chart I got my stuff from.

You're going to struggle to get passed a 3.2 but if you're just a sophomore you have time to raise that. I mean, the average GPA for incoming freshman at Harvard is over 3.9. So, even if they gave you some leeway you're outside of the ballpark.  Also, if you're trying to get into Harvard you're going to have to try more than if you're just looking at Illinois(well depending on the department). Also, some schools give more or less leeway to their athletes.  P.S. If they're just flyers/questionnaires, everyone gets them... that just means that you're a high school sophomore who has probably taken the PSAT once.

I can guarantee two things: you will find a good school that is a good fit for you and if you choose a school based upon it being a good fit for you, you will do well. How do you know if it is a good fit? Tour the campus, find schools that match your interests (academics, life style, location, student clubs, etc). There is too much stress on students these days. Take your time, find your path, and know that you will be a successful person if you put yourself in the right place. Also, research and find out about scholarships and programs for first generation students. They offer a lot of support to help you."

ApplyingToCollege,342c9i,trillic,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:27:08 2015 UTC,"Hi, newly admitted Michigan student. Since you're instate like I am I'm assuming you know of Wayne State University. I'll take you through my thought process and see if that helps. If what I'm doing isn't what this post/sub is about, my bad I'm new here.  So for me, I applied and got accepted into every school I thought would be a good fit for me. Wayne, Oakland, Michigan, and State. Having a relatively high ACT and GPA I was offered plenty of money from Wayne and Oakland and I was offered lots of money from State too.  I don't want to go into medicine anymore, but when I was applying that's what I was thinking about going into. The factors I took in were: eligibility after premed, cost, and to a lesser degree distance. Since you're between Michigan and Alabama and your situation is somewhat similar to how I was with Wayne, I'll substitute Wayne in for Alabama.  Wayne Pros: low cost, generally thought to be easier, and their premed is pretty good for what you pay (which is basically nothing due to scholarships and other stuff).  Michigan Pros: more costly, fun life on campus for sure, prestige all over the country and internationally, their med school is pretty bangin'.  Wayne Cons: Depending on where you live it may be a commute everyday you have classes, the campus wasn't all that great in my opinion, and transferring from Wayne elsewhere will mean wasting a few years of your life working hard at Wayne.  Michigan Cons: costly, their med school generally tends to not accept students from their own premed program.  If I was still going into med I'd choose to go to Wayne for a few years, save up, then go to a good med school. Keep your GPA up and you can get into most med schools if you do well on the MCAT.  Because I'm NOT going into med anymore, I went with Michigan because of it's prestige, job opportunities later on, and the research that goes on there. And because overall it's been my dream school for years.  I hope this kinda helped?"

If you are thinking of med-school in the end then Michigan's medical school would be a great choice but that isn't the decision you are making now.  It may be a good idea to pay the enrollment deposit at each school and spend some time on campus.  Alabama is down south meaning it's hot.  I was born in Michigan and could not imagine living in the heat like that so that would probably be a bad fit for me.  Gotta find out if you want to live in Alabama for 4ish years.  What are the pros and cons of each one?  Does the Pre-med program really mean a lot to you or do you want to study something else and be on the pre-med track at UofM?  Can you root for an SEC football team or go to a school with really only 1 major sport?  Do you hate the winters and want to get as far away from snow and cold as possible?  Both are fantastic schools so you need to figure out where you want to spend the next 4 years, where will you be happy and be your best."

ApplyingToCollege,33v4s4,STOPStoryTime,5,Sun Apr 26 01:28:53 2015 UTC,"Tips and generalizations  to help when you're looking at the surrounding area.   Big city? There is going to be lots to do in the city, not so much on campus. There will be crime. Some cities have more crime than others. Some areas of cities have more crimes than others. Moving off campus later in your college career will be expensive.  Small-ish/up and coming city? There will be a good amount of things to do off and on campus. You'll probably find a lot of things changing while you're there. Safety may vary and may also change during your time there. Moving off campus later in your college career is doable.  Suburbs/rural? Your life will be on campus. There is nothing off campus. Crime happens on campus because there is no city. College town? Your life is probably off campus. You can find an affordable place if you want to move into town. There is likely little crime. But, you probably won't want to stay here/put down roots after graduation.    General tip - something that happened often on my tours is families driving around (as they should) and wandering into a run down or bad area of town. For historical-political reasons, a lot of colleges, particularly state universities, tend to be built near/around/too close for comfort to bad areas. At this point, there's nothing we can do about it except deal with it. You should be concerned with how well the school deals with any threats and how they work with local police to reduce them not only on campus but in nearby areas that students may frequent/move to. If they look like they're trying (emergency lights, safety training, cameras, etc), thats good, you'll probably live safely through college. If they don't, then they probably don't have a handle on it. How this affects you depends on the type of school you're looking at. If life is centered on campus, be more concerned with on-campus safety because whatever happens five blocks down the street won't affect you. However, if life is more off-campus, you need to ask about crime stats to see how safe things really are where you're moving.   Its okay to ask these things if you phrase them correctly. Again, I've had families say ""we drove down the street and saw xyz"" or ""we heard about this bad neighborhood"" - please don't do that it makes you sound silly and pretentious. Every town/city has these places, of course theres run down and bad neighborhoods! Instead, say ""how is campus security"" or ""where can I find campus crime stats""."

What I can say for sure is that there are tons of ways to get involved here. We have over 500 student organizations, and I truly believe there is a niche for everybody here.   Almost all of the students I meet here at FSU are really nice, friendly people. It's common to see a student ask a lost visitor if they need help finding something on campus, which I think speaks to our attitude. I'd be lying if I said we were racism free (no campus is) but I honestly don't see very much of it around here. Florida has a very diverse population, and seeing as we are one of the major universities in the state our campus population reflects that.

ApplyingToCollege,33p6bp,sonitary,2,Fri Apr 24 10:59:20 2015 UTC,"I'm under the impression that the majority of American universities admit students to their undergraduate college overall, and allow students to switch majors - although your desired major on your application will be taken into account to try to ensure that every department will be filled.  However, I know that there are some colleges (mainly more competitive ones) that have a separate School of Engineering with a different admissions process.  I don't know if these programs are more difficult to get into than a Chemistry program but I do know that interest in engineering (biochemical, mechanical, nuclear) has been spiking recently, meaning that there are more people trying to gain admission to these schools.  So overall: it's possible, depending on the school.  Spend some time on their website and see what the deal is."
ApplyingToCollege,33p6bp,FSUAdmissions,2,Fri Apr 24 12:47:31 2015 UTC,"You're right that most of the major universities in America don't consider major for freshman admissions.

Here at FSU students aren't reviewed for admissibility into their major until the end of their sophomore year. The only exceptions to that rule are for some very high demand, talent-based majors like Music, Dance, and Film."
ApplyingToCollege,33p6bp,yaskween1,2,Fri Apr 24 20:54:53 2015 UTC,"In the United States what major you put on your application has no influence on whether or not you get in for 99% of universities. They only have that on the applications for statistical purposes or, if you put down a competitive major and you already got into the school, the department that offers that major will receive your application and decide if they want to accept directly into the major as a freshman (pretty rare). I applied as an Asian language major and ended up getting my degree in chemical engineering.  I want to warn you from experience though, chemistry and chemical engineering are not that similar. Almost all ChemE undergraduate courses you'd take involve little to NO chemistry at all. It's mostly physics. When I finally got into the major and took the intro class, I was sort of shell shocked for the first 2 weeks but grew to love it. So ChemE MIGHT be the engineering alternative you want, but if you're really into the chemistry part maybe material science engineering is better. Just do your research."

Beyond that U of C is a phenomenal school and is rated one of the best in the world.  If you can get into it you have a solid shot at some of the Ivy Leagues.

Despite what I said earlier, Chicago is a great college city.  The culture is fantastic, the food is even better, the architecture is phenomenal, and there's just so much to do downtown.  There are parties everywhere because of Loyola, Northwestern, and UIC.  Plus if you've never experienced 2 feet of snow in your life beyond skiing, it's definitely something.  Being accepted to U of C is nothing to brush off and I'd seriously consider it because the prestige itself is worth its weight in gold. If you have any questions about Chicago just let me know."

ApplyingToCollege,33n6r2,ksty1098,3,Tue Apr 28 01:04:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a student who got into UChicago and UCLA this year, and I will be attending Chicago. It is going to depend on who you are and what you want. Here's what I'd say about the two schools (mostly just Chicago).   Prestige-wise, Chicago wins by a large margin. More people have heard of UCLA, but those in the position to affect your career are more likely to have heard of Chicago and think highly of it. There is a new Institute for Molecular Engineering, so you'll be able to participate in that. At UChicago, you have a very large core requirement, so no matter what, you're going to have to take courses in the humanities, social science, and language. To my knowledge, UCLA does not have this. If you want to have a very well rounded education, and learn about a bit of everything, consider Chicago. If you have no desire to take these courses, consider UCLA. I know research at Chicago is very accessible to undergraduates. The fact of the matter is there are far more graduate students than undergraduate students, meaning there is a shortage of students to fill these positions. I'd imagine you could also get research at UCLA, but again, Chicago is more prestigious, and has more researchers who are at the top of their field. Having been on campus, and read a lot of material, I can say that the grade deflation and general difficultly of the school has decreased in an effort to remove their reputation as the school ""where fun goes to die"". Premed requirements are enormous, but doable. If you are considering medicine, medical research, or teaching, there is support for you. The neighborhood of Hyde Park is very nice. It's basically a little suburban bubble just outside of Chicago. The campus is beautiful, it's basically Hogwarts. Culturally, the bottom line is kids here want to learn. If you like school, and you care about learning stuff, you should come here. The student body is kind of nerdy and quirky. Go hangout on the admitted student facebook group, it'll give you a good idea. Chicago is the kind of school people choose because they got into Ivy Leagues but don't want to be associated with that, and they just want to learn.  There's a lot of other stuff to mention like scav and $1 milkshakes, but really you should be researching this stuff for yourself. The bottom line is this. If you want to breeze through college, go to UCLA. If you want to challenge yourself and learn as much as possible, go to Chicago. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. :)"

It is okay to have an interest in lots of things, but it may be better if she focuses on just one, or a couple of activities and build leadership experience. She should work hard at developing relationships with her guidance counselor and teachers so they get to know her and can write good letters of recommendation.

ApplyingToCollege,33ikuu,swegmaster1,6,Wed Apr 22 22:13:26 2015 UTC,"Varies by the school. At mine, things happen in pieces, there is no one point where they review the complete application student-by-student unless you appeal the decision. Basically, online applications, test scores, and grades are electronically databased as they come in. We database but do not make decisions based off of recommendation letters and stuff like that, it just goes in your file. Periodically, the database is checked for students for whom we have everything needed to make a decision, (app, scores, grades) and someone goes student by student comparing our criteria with the student's info. Based on the fit, they enter magical numbers and codes into the database which admit, deny, or waitlist the student. Probably less than a minute per student. Various employees handle the physical documents and database pre-decision but only one person per student reviews this information and makes the decision. On decision days, there are multiple deciders working the database and deciding. If someone is on VERY slim margins, not perfectly fitting criteria (which there is a criteria for), they do go to committee where a group of deciders, decide. (Sorry, I don't know much more about the committee thing). Very, very few apps go there though. After decisions are made, a report is generated about the admitted/denied students and supplied to higher level administrators which functions as an audit before the students receive their decisions."

ApplyingToCollege,33ikuu,jaredislove,2,Wed Apr 22 23:01:47 2015 UTC,"Ahh, great topic! My future plan is law school. That was not always my plan though. I interned with a political party Sophomore year (got a campaign manager's contact info from a professor) and met a bunch of people. Started thinking I wanted to be a consultant and generated a list of local firms to contact once summer hit. In that middle of that, I picked up the Legal Studies minor and really liked what I was learning. Realized most of the people I met on the campaigns were attorneys, contacted one and got an internship which I am having a great time at. Not saying this is what you'll do, but just making the point to be open.   What makes the major bad is simply the fact that it does not point you to one job. Biology majors are biologists. Education majors are teachers. PoliSci majors are...who knows what? It's up to you to decide what the major will mean by talking to professors/people in the field and taking on internships. Job prospects are bad because a lot of people don't do this or don't know how to do it. This way once you graduate, you'll know to either move on to grad school and take the path of becoming a political scientist/professor or have the job experience to get your start in the field. Politics is tricky to break into, but doable. Interning for local campaigns or officials is a great way to get into the circle so once you're done with the internship the recommendations are there for things like congressional jobs,  district aide positions, or assistant to a real consultant. You will start out bottom rung and have to work your way up, that's just how it works. It's not that there's no work directly in politics, its just a closed-off field. Regarding science/research based positions, you must get a graduate degree and you will most likely either work for the government or a university. It is the path less traveled because professorships are hard to get and research grants are sparse."

If you are thinking campaign manager, pick a small local campaign and contact them (not the political party) to see if they need interns. Managers work for themselves/the candidate, not the party. If you are thinking consulting, contact consulting/strategist firms. Campaigns are more open than firms, which tend to be skittish with the idea of taking on interns. Either way, be determined and you'll find something. Good luck!"

ApplyingToCollege,33ikuu,shagadelicbaby,2,Thu Apr 23 05:23:52 2015 UTC,"At most state schools it probably won't matter at all. We know that there's a very good chance that our incoming freshmen are going to change their major at least once before they graduate. Because of that, major generally isn't considered in the admissions process. There are exceptions of course. Here at FSU a few majors (Music, Film, Dance) affect admissions. But if a student doesn't get into the major, we can still offer admission to the University. They would just need to come in under a different major.  Don't worry at all about not knowing what you want to do in college. That's totally normal. When looking at schools, see if they have a good Exploratory program (that's what we call ""undecided"" these days), which will help you figure out what to major in.  You should check with each individual school you want to apply to, since some may consider major in the admissions process."
ApplyingToCollege,33ikuu,DataCruncher,2,Thu Apr 23 12:31:11 2015 UTC,"This is 100% true at my institution as well. Most freshmen have no clue what they want to study, and that's ok! You have time to decide once you're in school and taking some classes.   Some majors have a threshold GPA for admission, which is often just a ""rubber stamp"" kind of thing because its set much lower than our admissions criteria. Few students are affected by it. For those who are, we contact you and let you know to apply under a different program to be admitted."
ApplyingToCollege,33ikuu,FSUAdmissions,3,Thu Apr 23 16:40:26 2015 UTC,"1) Is an algorithm based on GPA/rank/SAT scores used as a first pass?

Basically Stanford has a secret 'list' of development cases, legacy, etc. AOs have a difficult time NOT admitting an applicant who is on the list. Do all schools have a similar 'list'??

ApplyingToCollege,33ikuu,rameez_s,3,Fri Apr 24 18:24:01 2015 UTC,"1 - I don't 100% get what you mean here. But basically, each merit component is first reviewed for state mandated minimum GPA and scores. If you don't meet those, you're automatically getting denied. Then, the merits are reviewed under our admissions criteria. We take a balanced approach, so it is somewhat holistic. For example, an excellent GPA makes up for a less than average test score. The university literally makes charts and graphs for this that are referenced to categorize students (admit, deny, waitlist) to make decisions. We (and lots of other state universities) don't care about your class rank.   2- Applications are reviewed in the order they came in. We don't care about extracurriculars, awards, or legacy. Our decisions are based exclusively on your GPA and test scores. Again, this is common in state universities.  3- Absolutely. We tighten the requirements further into the academic year. Students who apply as early as possible have the easiest merits test to pass. Also, if you happen to not meet our standards, but are close, the counselors will work with you on a plan to bring yourself up to par. That does not happen past February/March.  4- Another common thing in state universities is admissions offices having employees you never see. Admissions officers/counselors/recruiters only job is to interact with students and take in their documents. Deciders are separate individuals in a back room somewhere.   Anyway, we don't have anything like that. Admissions decisions, pretty much at all schools, are conditional. If a student does something to screw up, the decision can be rescinded. Examples include drastically dropped GPA, failing a course senior year, or getting into legal trouble. A target class size is set by higher level admin per year and admissions works based off of that, but its a loose requirement, they just don't want to admit too few or too many students. This is not divided by counselor or decider. If you meet criteria, you're in.  5- That is not common at all. We definitely don't have one. Most state schools don't have one. I guess its probably more of a private school thing. I have seen legacies and children of very influential/wealthy people get denied. The merits are all that matters for us.  6- We do not take race into account for admissions decisions. The affirmative action impact on admissions decisions at basically all schools is reducing every year."

Many of them were prestigious. When I looked around at the students, they generally fit a rather specific ""type"" which varied based on the school and the school's image I guess.   My question is.. How does the college admissions process manage to gather a type? Do they check out people's social media or what not? Yeah I understand colleges aim for diversity, but I can't help but wonder what is going on when one school is full of socially inept geniuses, or the work hard play hard athletic people, or the preppy charismatic upper middle class types.  It's just a trend I have noticed and have always wondered if type and personality were a criteria for schools. And also how they discerned this type of information."
ApplyingToCollege,33ikuu,makeupiguess,2,Sun Apr 26 01:33:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting question! We do not gather types or personalities or anything like that. The deciders make decisions based exclusively on test scores and GPA. They don't know what ""kind"" of student they're bringing in, race data is only generated for statistical info. Based on my experience, I would say that a college's culture develops due to programs offered and traditions. If there are big athletic programs, athletic minded students are drawn to that while people who are anti-athlete stay away. Colleges that focus on liberal arts don't attract nerdy engineers. I think once the school makes the image, which is usually based on their big programs of study, certain types of students are then attracted to them while others are not. From what I've seen, the colleges do not do this intentionally, it just happens."

A downward trend is one of the worst things that can happen to your GPA, especially in your most important year: junior year. No, they won't be upset that you didn't take AP Lit, as long as you took some other AP class to make up for it. If you got B's in math courses, it's going to look very poorly since you want to go into engineering. It'll also reflect poorly if you do poorly while taking a relatively less intense course load.

The location, firstly, is SO much better than Hempstead. The only nice things best Hofstra are the Coliseum (which now has no islanders team) and some museums. And a park. BU has a lot more namesake to it, better ranking, and honestly, more bang for your buck. A degree from BU would pay off a lot more than one from Hofstra.

ApplyingToCollege,32xzul,BobThePillager,5,Fri Apr 17 17:23:49 2015 UTC,"College student here, going to give some possibly unsolicited harsh advice.  College is not a career factory. A degree is not some kind of rubber stamp, checklist thing you try to get done with as soon as possible. Instead it is a learning experience. Looking at this from a purely academic/career lens, there is a sweet spot where you're in college long enough to take advantage of all the resources but short enough to look smart to future employers or grad schools. Yes, you can save money by being done faster, but at what expense? If you speed through your education without taking advantage of networking, internships, etc, you won't have a job when you're done...simple as that. You'll be like all these other kids, sitting around with a degree and not knowing what to do with it. I have found that the college courses they're excusing IB students from are often not equivalents. For example, in FL, English Literature gets you out of Comp 1, and those are two totally different classes. So, ironically, you could be missing out on important parts of your education by skipping. Further, you're cutting down on your academic exploration time. You need time to delve into your chosen field and learn about it. See if you even want that major or minor. College is the time to find out through experience before there are serious time and money trade-offs what you want to do in life and how. TBH, age discrimination is real so graduating early can be a negative. Typically because young=inexperienced. So again, if you rush through college without getting some experience (internship, job, involvement, whatever) then no one will want to hire you and it will become a big negative. If you want to save time+money, you will have to focus on packing the whole college experience into less time, which can be difficult.    Personal experience: I came into college without credits (silly high school didn't offer it) but I'm graduating in 3.5 years total and have had quite a few internships/job experiences in that time. You can pull it off quickly and efficiently, but it is a long hard road to do both at the same time."

When you're 29 and the bill could be half as much per month you'll think about how 'great' your experience was.  One of the greatest lessons of school and your looming adulthood is the ability to see beyond the next four or five years.
ApplyingToCollege,32rxol,JackMarston,4,Thu Apr 16 05:45:33 2015 UTC,"Ok so....  Most of your post was about bragging about yourself. Here's why I have a problem with that- your question was inquiring about what colleges might be a fit for you. But in that regard, all you gave us were potential majors (and you can't even major in ""law"" in undergrad). Even if you think you don't care about size or location, you need to give us a bit more information as to your preferences to help us help you.   From there, then we can possibly look at your credentials and make a guess as to whether or not you will have a chance at some of these schools (but for what it's worth, your academics seem fine)."

ApplyingToCollege,32p2uj,f_E_a_R_e_D,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:53:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly it depends on yourself. It sounds like your courses are pretty tough, but if you're confident that you can handle the work AND do well, go for it. I don't know how difficult those classes are in your individual school so it's hard for me to judge as an internet stranger.   There are potential benefits from an admissions standpoint by taking difficult senior year courses, but this only counts if you get good grades in them.  Applying for colleges is a pretty stressful process and take out a huge chunk of time that could otherwise be used on studying. It could be tough to balance applying and schoolwork and it's definitely an exercise in time management.  You mentioned in your previous post that you were concerned about your GPA. College admissions often take your first quarter senior year grades into account when making a decision, so also keep that in mind.   I personally chose to take it easy in my senior year and did not regret my decision one bit. I felt like I would rather do well in easier classes and have more time to focus on applications than POTENTIALLY gain some points with admissions by taking difficult courses.  You might not be looking this far right now, but I had a ton of fun in senior spring that otherwise would not have been possible if I loaded myself up with difficult courses. Your happiness matters too!  Best of luck in choosing classes and in the admissions process. Let me know if you have any questions!"

ApplyingToCollege,32n36k,Dreamberry,3,Wed Apr 15 02:42:46 2015 UTC,"I have worked in Admissions, Fin Aid, and Academic Advising.  Make sure you are going to a non-profit college. All state colleges are non-profit.   Go ahead and apply online and send in high school transcripts and other docs they require. There will be a step by step guide on the college's admissions webpage. Fill out and submit your FAFSA online. Then contact the Financial Department and ask if you are eligible for any scholarships. Only take loans out as a last resource. Always ask what scholarships and grants you are or could be eligible for. If you play your cards right you can get most if not all of your education paid for without taking loans out.   Once accepted sign up for orientation/registration as early as possible.   If you like engineering and science you may want to major in physics or mathematics. Take a look at their list of majors/concentrations to get more ideas.  Make sure you meet with an academic advisor each semester before registering for the next set of courses. You don't want to get off track or take a course you do not need.   Don't just go to class and go home. Get involved on campus. This is how you can network for future jobs, make new friends, have a little fun, and getting involved on campus will allow you to do better academically overall. Good luck."

ApplyingToCollege,32mgyr,Imbrown2,2,Tue Apr 14 23:41:05 2015 UTC,"So did you get a D or an F? Was your transcript fixed to show a D? A D is a rough, especially in a class highly relevant to your desired field-but you can make up for singularly poor grades in a variety of ways, it's much more concerning to be consistently low. However, if you have an F on your official transcript, that is a whole new ballgame. That won't fly anywhere or requires some serious explaining, because with a D at least they know you took the class and got above a 60%, which shows comprehension of some of the material and at least some effort. An F can indicate literally zero points- also, teachers are almost always willing to get an F up to a D if a student wants to work with them. An F is indicative of an utter lack of effort in the class.   What would do well to offset this is if you can get a solid A in a class like AP Chemistry or AP Physics C. This shows universities that you are capable and something just went horribly wrong in one grading period. taking the Math SAT II subject test and doing well will also help, because you need to demonstrate that you are capable handling engineering-related topics and your poor grade was an exception to a trend of excellence."

ApplyingToCollege,32mbgv,angel8a92,3,Tue Apr 14 22:56:41 2015 UTC,"Have you looked into absolutely all other ways to pay for school? Loans should be a last resource, and $33,000 is pretty high. Is this for just one year?  Things to keep in mind:  -A loan will need to be paid back, with interest. You need to make sure to research the field you're wanting to go into after graduation to make sure you can afford to pay them back. Look at average starting salaries for jobs and compare them to what your monthly loan payment will be.   -Federal loans usually (not always) have lower interest rates. They also allow you to not make any payments until after graduation, sometimes offer payment plans or forgiveness programs, and some (subsidized) don't accrue interest while you're in school. Keep all of this in mind when looking into private loans.   -Take out the absolute minimum necessary. Consider getting a part time job, applying for scholarships anywhere you can think of, etc.  Best of luck! I ended up with about $24,000 in loans after 4 years at a state school. I was part of an Americorps program after I graduated, which paid for about half of that. Never stop looking for free money!"

ApplyingToCollege,32ixqy,AnaheimFekt,3,Tue Apr 14 03:57:41 2015 UTC,"I'm going to start you off with some words that you probably won't want to hear- you did the application process wrong.   First of all, it's pretty presumptuous of you to say that you ""expected"" to get into 7 schools. No matter how ""good"" you think your grades or test scores or activities list are, you can still never know 100% what decisions a college's admissions office will make unless you are actually behind those closed doors. Whatever decisions your colleges made (accept, deny, waitlist), know that those are made purposefully and with your best interests in mind.  So, you got into three schools, but they're not your top choices...? I want to assume that on some level, you liked these schools, because otherwise, why would you have applied to them? Applying to schools that you don't really like is not a wise decision, because then you end up in the scenario that you have described above.    Now, according to you, size and culture of a school are important to you, which is fine! I'm glad you at least put that much thought into that. If we take size and culture as your main priority, then it seems that State is going to be your best fit. However, what makes you say that MSU doesn't have strong engineering programs?? All you need to do is poke around their website, and you'll find that in Fall 2014, Mechanical Engineering had the largest enrollments of all the engineering programs, at both the undergrad and graduate level. I certainly hope that 1,300 students can't be wrong.   But, just to add another observation, while you list the three colleges, you name three entirely different programs and outcomes, so it seems like you still don't really know what you want to do. Again, if we are taking into account the social scene, take a visit to MSU and decide if that seems like a cool place- I think you'll like what you see, but I personally do not recommend enrolling at a college that you haven't visited. But overall, they seem to be the best fit for you. If career is indeed what you are going for, I would tentatively place Cal Maritime as a second place choice for you, ERAU at third."
ApplyingToCollege,32ixqy,blue_surfboard,2,Tue Apr 14 18:32:52 2015 UTC,"I suppose I am being a bit presumptuous; I was/am very frustrated after I was denied to both Minnesota and Ohio State after admissions representatives from both schools personally told me I would easily make it when I discussed my chances with them at college fairs and admissions meetings. I won't be able to visit Michigan State before May 1st, so if I decide to go there I will be going there nearly blind. I went to a welcome for admitted students put on by the local Alumni Association, but they did not discuss much more than the school spirit. Anyways, I did a bit more personal research into MSU's engineering programs, and the Mechanical Engineering program is indeed very good. Most of the mechanical engineering labs and partnerships are aimed towards careers in the automotive industry, which is not exactly what I am looking for, but is still good.  Thanks for your advice, I will definitely keep it in mind."
ApplyingToCollege,32ixqy,blue_surfboard,2,Wed Apr 15 04:50:45 2015 UTC,"I sympathize with your frustrations, and whoever those reps were should be ashamed for even suggestion such an outcome that didn't happen. I never make those predictions, even when a student brings a transcript with them to a meeting, because you never know what you will find in the application.  Now, so MSU... okay, you went to an admitted students event. Did you like the event? Did you get a good perception of the spirit? Again, you stated that that was a priority for you, and of the three, State probably has the most ""spirit."" I'm not surprised about the opportunities for automotive, given proximity to Detroit, but remember, undergraduate is really about taking advantage of all kinds of opportunities available to you. At a school as large as State, I have no doubt you should be able to find some kind of internship more closely in line with what you would like to pursue.  In any case, good luck with your pending decision- you still have at least a couple of weeks to make it!"

ApplyingToCollege,32huy6,FSUAdmissions,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:15:51 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily bad, but just keep in mind that if your first ACT attempt is in September of your Senior year, you won't have many opportunities beyond that to re-test to try and raise your scores.   If you can make room to take it in your Junior year, that would be a good thing. Then, once you get your scores back, you'll know which areas you did best and worst in, so you can hit the books to try and improve in your weaker areas and retest in September. Or, if you knock it out of the park on your first try, you can sit back and relax with no test anxiety in your senior year."

So I asked one of my student employees to describe the experience of taking the ACT and here's what she told me:   This is definitely one of the more time consuming tests you will take as a high school student. It also is going to test just how much you can focus. As long as you stay focused and manage your time well, the test is painless. It's divided into several sections that test general knowledge in Math, Reading, Writing, and Scientific reasoning. The Math is broken down into Algebra and Geometry. The Reading portion tests vocabulary and comprehension. The Writing section presents a prompt and asks for an essay style answer. The Science portion consists of different scenarios/experiments and asks questions that test your logic. Although the exam is a few hours long, there is no switching between subjects so you can focus on one subject at a time. Another plus is that you are only penalized for incorrect answers so if you really don't know something, you can always leave it blank!"

From the university apps I've filled out, it seems that most schools want between one and three letters of recommendation. Some schools don't require any. If you want to narrow down your choices, it would serve you best to get recs only from the professors whose classes are in your major field, and for whom you've done your best work. If possible, get one from a prof you've had for more than one semester. For example, my letters of rec come from a psych prof (my major), an art prof (my minor + a prof I had twice), and a former boss.   See if your school transfer center offers a ""credentials packet"" or some other way to file your letters.

I joined so I could grow up, which I did, mostly. The reactor and the ship lost its majesty after I was there for a bit, and my heart was never really in the workings of the propulsion system, it made hot water and that is a job that I did.   I learned through teaching that having the ability to effect other people's lives and impart the lessons and wisdom about owning yourself, and acting with the right and responsibility to change yourself and the world around us is my most favorite thing. On the other hand, it was a black and white world that lead to some ideas and perspectives of life that I want to break up a bit. Yes, money is not a concern. Even less is it a concern to go to a 'name'. It's about being in the presence of those who weild power and authority in the world, so that I can take some of that for myself. By learning how to take the ideas that I have, both business and social, and making them an effective reality.  It was a real process to extend myself towards the schools. It feels akward to detail my life to these somewhat 'mythical' places. I really have no idea what goes on up there.

I am working against the idea that 18-22 is the window of educational opportunity for these top-tier schools, but that is a bunch of shit. I am more ready today than I ever could have been at eighteen.  It will be important to me, however, not to walk in like I am big and bad and have seen the whole world.

Carnegie Mellon is a severe reach since your unweighted and weighted GPA are on the low side. You seem to have some good volunteering and some good athletics, but there's some lacking leadership. Start a club! Also, you need some science extracurriculars to show your passion for engineering. Since you are applying for engineering, they won't hold your English grades as much against you, which is good, but I severely recommend that you bring them up. Constant B's in English are not good, and schools like CMU, UIUC (I'm assuming you're talking about UIUC), UT Austin, and Georgia Tech that are known for engineering want their students to be capable to succeed in not only technical sciences, but the humanities as well.

ApplyingToCollege,32ed20,Ultra_dc,-1,Mon Apr 13 02:48:35 2015 UTC,"..That really isn't a con, since that's what I expect.   I can try and find one.   EDIT: Found this comment on a YouTube video by Alex Hanneman   I am a current student at Full Sail, in the Computer Animation course. Let me tell anyone who thinks the education is a joke: You are wrong.  Full Sail's graduation rate is low because the high majority of people can't handle what we do here. Last month in December my friends and I were probably working at least 100 hours a week. That includes the 8 hour daily lecture/labs and many hours of homework afterwards. We did not have Sundays off because of break, meaning we went to school for 20 days straight. That sounds insane, and it is. But if you can handle it and truly love this job, it's not that bad, and you get out faster than anyone else.  Although I cannot vouch for the other degree programs, if you're interested in Computer Animation or Game Art there is a very good success rate here. Meaning, if you make it to graduation, the companies who look at Full Sail know what you had to go through to get there. A living hell. But it's worth it if you are truly passionate about this degree.  That's really the key factor. I bet 80% of people I talk to aren't truly passionate about animation, and were just traditional art students looking for a art related program so they could do something. I can literally point out who will fail in the coming months. They're more interested in partying, or a college experience. And when they fail, they run to the internet and bash the school. It's ridiculous.  I see amazing work created here daily. My skills have improved vastly from before I attended here. I got to work 1 on 1 with my instructor who worked at Disney for 8 years and worked on projects such as Lilo and Stitch, Mulan, and other movies.   Before you bash Full Sail, don't base your opinion on the failures from the school that failed because they didn't attend class and put the minimum amount of work in, but talk to the students who know what it takes and are busting their asses to stay here and get through. Show less"

Very solid football team that is generally on the rise and has completed for their conference title in recent years. They play in a major conference (PAC 12) which is known for explosive offenses. University of Florida - Their football team is a historic powerhouse but they are in a rut right now (which I love, as a Florida State fan). They're in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) which is known for amazing talent, tailgating, and fan experience in general. Many consider it the ""best"" overall conference, although it's been somewhat trending down in recent years. West Virginia University - Also has a pretty good football team, and their fans are known for burning furniture after big wins/losses/whenever. It's actually such a problem that it's now illegal to have upholstered furniture outdoors in their town. They're in a major conference (Big XII) which is also known for exciting offense.   Of those three, UF is almost certainly the best academically, which could be a plus (better education) or minus (harder classes) for you.  Among the other schools, Purdue and Maryland are also in major football conferences (both are in the Big Ten) but neither of them are any good at football. SDSU and SJSU are also in Division 1 football, but are in lesser conferences.

ApplyingToCollege,31wmen,FSUAdmissions,3,Thu Apr 9 12:54:44 2015 UTC,Honest question: are you paid to promote FSU on here?
ApplyingToCollege,31wmen,wildhairguy,5,Tue Apr 14 00:14:37 2015 UTC,"I work for Admissions at FSU, they pay my salary. One of my responsibilities is to handle our social media efforts. We're on most of the major platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), including Reddit as of a few months ago. So I suppose in that loose sense I am ""paid to promote FSU on here"". But I think a better way to put it is that I'm ""paid to represent FSU on here"" since my primary goal is not promotion, it's engagement.  I like to be transparent about things, so here's the brief backstory of why we joined Reddit a few months ago and what our goals are.  I've been a redditor for a few years. I attended and now work for FSU, and check out /r/fsu regularly. I would often see admissions-related questions being posted. I'd occasionally answer them, but it felt weird doing so from my personal account since there was no way for other redditors to verify that I was a representative of the school. So a few months ago I went to our director and got approval to start an official account for our office.  Answering questions on /r/fsu went well so I started branching out to other higher-ed related subs. I found some of the more active ones and joined them, including this one. I also subscribe to /r/college, /r/highereducation, and /r/education. I try to check them every day and search for posts containing ""FSU"" or ""Florida"" to locate questions about FSU and/or colleges in Florida.  I don't want to be ""all about FSU"" so I also check out other threads to see if there is anything we might be able to weigh in on. If I happen to find a student that seems to fit our profile that isn't asking for information on any schools in particular (such as /u/KansasKid24 did in this thread) I'll chime in real quick to let them know I am here if they'd like some info on FSU.  It is not (and never will be) my intent to hard-sell FSU to anybody. I just want them to know we're here and we'd love to talk to them about FSU if they'd like. If they're not interested, I'm totally cool with that. I want nothing more than for every student to find the college that fits them best. That's what's best for the student and the school. If FSU isn't somebody's best fit, I wouldn't want to pressure them to come here.  Also, I want to be clear that we are indeed the FSU Admissions Office, so I reached out to this sub's mod and asked him to verify our account so other redditors here would know exactly who they are dealing with. I've tried to do the same on other subs when possible.  I hope that clears things up. I'm definitely not some spam-bot or ""hired gun"" with a goal of only driving up application traffic or some other metric. I'm here to try and help students and make positive contributions to the sub. As a redditor outside of my career, I love the platform and see so much potential in it when it comes to starting dialogues. I'd love it if students had a really solid resource in this sub for getting information and help on the college application process. It seems like we're one of the first schools to really show up here, and I hope more join over time."

However, it sounds like you're mainly concerned about the rigor of UofT's coursework. Difficulty of coursework is really subjective, so I think you should experience it for yourself and see how difficult it is for you. If you find the coursework too difficult after a semester, then you might want to consider transferring. The potential connections you might make there, the overall student demographic, and the better academics would definitely be worth working really hard during college.

But to be quite frank, unless you are a minority (Asian and Indian do not count) or female looking to go into a STEM field, your chances are slim to none.   I am a graduating high school senior who was recently waitlisted at Cornell. I had a 2390 on my SATs, three 800 subject test scores, and six 5s on AP tests by the end of my junior year. I was also salutatorian of a class of nearly 600, the president of two STEM-related clubs, and part of Columbia University's Science Honors Program. I still did not get in.  Getting into any Ivy League is extraordinarily difficult, and I think that schools like the UMich or UCLA are better schools to look at. Granted, I know very few details about you from your post except for a few numbers and courses. There are a multitude of factors such as your personal story, your high school location, your race, and your gender that are all factored into your decision. It is more than a numbers game. You may very well have a shot at Cornell, but there needs to be more information than what you have provided.   One tip I have is to begin drafting your essays right now. I began last March, and kept updating, changing, and scrapping my essays until the day my applications were due.

Got straight As except for English.  Currently I am taking Honors Jr Precalc, Honors Physics, and AP Macro and I'm getting As in those. Again, I'm not taking APUSH and I got a B in Spanish 4 first semester and will probably get an A this semester.   Next year, I am planning on taking Calc BC (highest), APES, and AP Physics C (highest). I will take regular English and I will not take Spanish. Also, I'm planning on taking Business Mgmt Honors. Realistically, I'll probably get a B in Calc, APES, and Physics.  I got a 32 on the ACT with an 8 on the writing test and I'm planning on taking the Math SAT subject test (not sure how I'll score on that). My unweighted GPA is somewhere along 3.7 and my weighted is 4.21.  For EC, I played football, baseball, and wrestled freshman year, played baseball and wrestled soph. year, wrestled this year, and will wrestle varsity next year. I am in Economics club and Bass Fishing club. I'm trying to start some sort of project this summer for charity, and I will work in my father's office: he is a financial advisor. I wish to either major in mathematics while minoring in economics or do something with engineering because that's what I actually enjoy. What universities do you think would be a match for me, and which solid universities could I get into with some scholarships.  Also, would it be a good idea to take Spanish 5 instead of either APES or AP Physics C? I'm not too good at Spanish anymore, and the teacher is terrible. I think i should take the two science classes if I want to major in mathematics or engineering, but you tell me."
ApplyingToCollege,31mtdx,bigdaddyEm,0,Mon Apr 6 19:36:20 2015 UTC,"Fellow Chicago suburbanite here, I would honestly suggest UIUC for you.  If you got your ACT score up to 33 you'd get into the College of Engineering no problem.  I applied with a 3.78 unweighted and 29 ACT and got sent to general studies.  They're pretty much good at every thing they do.  The problem is that they're stingy as hell with scholarships, as in I only got $5k/year but you'd probably get a bit more.  Being in-state also helps.    Another good choice would be Ohio State (where I'm 80% sure going this fall). It's not as high ranked as UIUC but very good nonetheless.  They're pretty generous with scholarships.   Purdue is another great choice, it was my top choice before I didn't get any scholarships.  However, you probably will get some if you keep it up.  I prefer it over UIUC but they're so similar that it's up to you.    For your Spanish dilemma, take the science classes instead.  I only took 3 years and took AP Macro this year instead. 10/10 would do again because the Spanish program at my school blows.  Take AP Physics because that will look very good when applying for colleges.    If you have any questions about all of this shoot me a PM and I'll be more than glad to help you out.

All that being said, you have a couple of vastly different colleges here, but I don't doubt that you will get a great undergraduate education at both. You saying that UCSD is better than Eckerd is really subjective, because the experience you get at both will be different. Yes, UCSD is quite well known, but did you know that Eckerd frequently ranks as one of the top colleges to produce PhD students? Did you know that they actually do have a nationally ranked marine biology program with top notch facilities? Clearly, though you may not realize it, Eckerd is still producing students with fantastic outcomes after graduation.

So if money is an issue, i'd reconsider where you apply. Many schools only take a certain number of international students, so I'd suggest applying to multiple (I applied to 9 Canadian Universities). The biggest thing for international students is Visas. No matter where you go internationally to study, you will need a visa which can take months to process, keep this in mind after you apply.

If you can get awards from there you will go much further than you ever will leaving it to institutional awards. The Overwhelming majority of astronauts are engineers, not doctors. Although the doctors are there, definitely a harder path to take.    Now onto whether or not you have a chance. You have stellar test scores but a weak GPA and overall okay ECs(in my opinion). Being just ""above average"", even at a top 10 school, is not where you want to be for the schools. I'm sure you know this as well as I do but for test scores, asians are somewhat expected to have high scores. The average for asians is generally 2300+ at those schools. Even then, you're doing great. The major issue is, as you know, your GPA is way below what they are looking for. Most schools of that caliber average a 3.9+(for Harvard's class of 2017 it was 3.93 and over 50% had a 4.0). Also, are there any other classes you can take? It seems strange to me that a school of that caliber(top 10) would only allow you to take 6 AP classes. Most kids I know who ended up at top colleges had way more than 6.    Now about other stuff, research is awesome. ISEF/Siemens/Intel STS is much better than leaving it to a journal. Honestly, I had no idea what squash was but after spending a bunch of time looking at videos of Indian men in a glass box, I feel that it is basically raquet ball(this is unrelated but I'm sorta interested in it now). Definitely cool! After that, there isnt all that much else unless the things that you didnt list really add up.    Overall, I think you have a fair shot.

That leaves mid to low end(state schools) that offer a bit of aid. Definitely not a bad idea, but suggesting that prestigious college will give much merit is a bad idea  P.S.

She would easily be able to get automatic scholarships to some not as prestigious schools, and could possibly receive competitive ones, too. I know University of Alabama gives full tuition scholarships to those with 3.5+ GPAs and 32+ ACTs. And some schools such as Ohio State have competitive scholarships that she could apply for."

A full ride would be a much better option especially for majors like engineering where the school matters less. Although MIT may be better than UA, the starting salary doesn't change much.   As mentioned in other threads, she probably won't be indepent and thus won't be receiving any need based aid. Unless she is willing to take circa 200k in debt, which she doesn't seem to want to do, top schools are out. Schools that offer free rides are out there, but many are competitive and the ones that aren't are generally small state schools.

Applying as an international student is not much different than applying as a normal student. BUT there are some major differences. I went through a ton of research about applying to an international school, which i suggest you do the same. To the extent of my knowledge, getting financial aid as an international student is extremely difficult and some countries won't give an international student any aid. So if money is an issue, i'd reconsider where you apply. Many schools only take a certain number of international students, so I'd suggest applying to multiple (I applied to 9 Canadian Universities).  The biggest thing for international students is Visas. No matter where you go internationally to study, you will need a visa which can take months to process, keep this in mind after you apply. Basically, just do your research. I knew I wanted to go to Canada for university my first year in high school and took all of high school to figure out what I need to do when applying and moving out of the country.

AP exams usually cover the same subject, but numerically the system is flawed because the difference between a 3, 4, and 5 can be a lot. SAT IIs, because they are measured out of 800 in increments of 10, can be much more precise and help give ad counselors a more precise understanding of your aptitudes.   Also, World History has a lot of info on it, so taking the SAT II right after the AP Exam is probably a good idea so that you don't forget a ton.   That being said, the school you are thinking of going to makes a difference. There is a lot of dispute as to whether or not it matters a lot. Some schools require them, some don't, others let you get credit for them. I think you should research the schools that you are thinking about and then you will probably have a much better idea.

ApplyingToCollege,30zeec,makerandbuilder,3,Tue Mar 31 22:49:12 2015 UTC,"I actually went to Penn, graduated almost 5 yrs ago. I know quite a few people that went to Penn from Philly and surrounding states like NY and NJ. That said, I have a few thoughts as a Penn grad:   You say you want to study eng or econ and go to grad school for ops research? Speaking from my experience + my peers, I can tell you that a lot of students enter college thinking they will do x, y, and z in school.  A lot of times, their peers and simply the environment of the school largely influence their career choice. Be prepared for that, and don't feel locked into a degree/major -- you may find something you're newly passionate about when you discover more about who you are in college.  Specifically, and imho, Penn is very Wharton (the biz school). What I mean is, the undergrads are largely influenced by Wharton people and Wharton classes. I never cared for Finance all throughout college and had entered Penn w/ the intent of pre-med, but I eventually went the business route and landed a job in finance out of college. This happens to a lot of undergrads that go to Penn.  In terms of ""best undergraduate education""... I'll say that Penn opened a lot of doors for me. I can't say it was ""the best"" education b/c classes can be on the big side and the atmosphere is extremely competitive, which are factors I believe may not always be conducive to quality  education. However, b/c of the brand name of Penn, tons of competitive companies recruit at Penn for internships and full time job opportunities all the time. Thus, I know Penn's brand name really helped me in my job search (also, the alumni network was invaluable), and helped me to find extremely intelligent, talented, and like-minded friends.    That said, with any school you pick, it really has to do w/ how much you know yourself, what you want to get out of your education, and how much you make of it.

If you want to work in Academia, Penn might be the way to go, as Ivy Leagues are going to put you in great standing in the job market (which is abysmal for tenure-track positions). Still, if there is no financial aid for Penn, you should really consider Case Western or Northeastern. Those are still great programs for people who want to get into top-ranking grad programs, which matter a lot more than where you did your undergrad.

If you have the feeling you may switch majors go to UPenn, in fact UPenn has the better school of Engineering as well as a the best Business school in the nation (maybe behind Harvard's), UPenn will be more competitive and especially in Engineering you want a school where you have as much help as possible"

I go to UC Berkeley and I found that in comparison, his work was pretty similar in difficulty (I'm a biochem major now going to med school). He was a bioengineering major which is pretty similar to the premed major in terms of difficulty and financially.  Rice and Cornell are both private institutes so they're definitely going to be pricey without scholarships or financial aid. You should look into the financial packages first and how much assistance you're gonna get from the school. Like Sgopal2 said, Rice is close to the Texas Medical Center which is a great opportunity. But if you're going into bioengineering, I would highly recommend Cornell. My SO said that it was one of the most challenging but rewarding experiences and through connections that he made through Cornell and fellow colleagues, he's already starting with a great job before grad school.

ApplyingToCollege,30wmz5,bigdaddyEm,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:42:33 2015 UTC,Penn state is cheaper but in the middle of nowhere. BU is a great option but expensive. If money is no object go to BU. Otherwise hard to beat Penn State (save money for MBA).
ApplyingToCollege,30wia9,iBangTurtles,6,Tue Mar 31 07:23:28 2015 UTC,"It's always worth a try. I know that usually, when a college allows for merit scholarship appeals, they actually require that you submit award letters from other institutions. So first, I would contact the top choice college, and just ask if there is a process for appealing the merit scholarship. If there isn't one, but they are open to it, send an email over, but include a scan of the letter that mentions the 66K scholarship from the other school."

You're safety gave you a lot because it's fighting to get you to go to their school instead of your top choice. Your top choice probably has more top students to pick from so they don't need to give you as much. That's just how admissions works.

If you wanted to go somewhere more competitive like UMich, you might need more but otherwise a 2000/29 would be fine. If you can manage it, try to stay in honors math(as long as you're not literally failing). Especially if you can bring it up over the years.  P.S. Dont get worked up over the stuff as a freshman... as long as you do decent in school, you'll get a reasonable SAT score and you'll do fine.

UCLA is one of the hardest schools to predict in my opinion (I know someone who got in with lower everything than you), but I still think you might be a bit too low in GPA and SAT for them. I think you have a decent shot at UCSD. If you have your heart set on UC, then I suggest you look into UC Davis (the next best UC in my opinion), as well as Irvine and maybe Santa Barbara.

You're listing things like ""I should have done"", ""I got screwed"" or ""I didnt have the opportunity to"". You cant put those on an application and they're pretty much irrelevant unless you plan on sounding like a whining child on your application.  About ECs first, you have a bit of stuff but many of them aren't ""dedicated"" things. Most people don't spend much time on things like science bowl or olympiad (although if you do that's great). Most of them time(not always tho), they are monthly things. Research is awesome, especially if you get things published recognized journals. Just being there and watching is great, but finding something or not finding something is much better.  About scores, I wouldn't recommend retaking anything unless you just feel like wasting time. A college would be more likely to deny you based upon being crazy for retaking a 2250+ than admit you for a higher score(although CalTech might be an exception because they seem to just want students with 4.0s and a 2400s). Your scores and GPA are great.  Have you taken 7? Are you taking them now? Are you going to graduate with 7? I really cant tell based upon your post. P.S.

I replied in PM but assumed I'd post it here too.   Well, your post says ""Will want to do something in business in college"" and you mention colleges like Harvard where they don't even offer business. If you had done more than a prestige run(maybe you didn't just do it but it sorta looks like you did), you would see that many of the schools you listed are VERY different. For example, Brown offers a open curriculum and tons of liberal arts while MIT/Carnegie Melon focus heavily on theory/hard science and have a very ""nerdy"" vibe. Harvard focuses on, for lack of better word, making money with it. I can't imagine many students-if any- that would be comfortable at both MIT and Brown. They're totally different environments.    You should be focused on finding a place where you're comfortable and not just a school that you like the name of. The schools have different vibes and should be treated as completely seperate.  If you'd like to do finance or computer science, most of those schools have good computer science departments, but as I mentioned, they are very different. Some teach theoretical and keep you on a track(CMU) and some teach the ""practical"" uses for it and allow you to chose just about every class you take(Brown).    There are lots of colleges that fit what you want. Anything from Stanford to UT Austin would fit the bill. You need to find more than just ""I want a college that has a high ranking and lots of rich alums with networking"". Most big name colleges will provide that but there is a lot more to a college than just the alums or the ranking/what can help you learn the most. You could go to the University of Illinois-Chicago and get the same education as you could get at UChicago. Sure, you might have to work for it a bit more at UIC(Is that the right acronym?) but it's definitely directly related to how much you put in to it.    When you have to decide what college you want, I urge you to consider things more than how many professors have nobel prizes and what the average scores of students are. You should also consider if you feel like you can thrive there. f the top schools happen to be those, then that is great. If they're not, then consider the schools that do.    Now about your ECs   There isn't all that much there and the ones that are there are sorta scatted. You're doing physics club but you want to major in business? Not that the club is bad but it's not exactly related to business. Internships and stuff are great and I' recommend working on them. Possibly getting your name on anything that is published. Although it is somewhat late for you, getting ECs related to your major generally help a bit."

Although a 2230 is a good-but-not-stellar score, it's about average at those schools. Eagle scout is awesome... You don't mention much else and if that's all (I'm sure it isnt tho!) you haven't done much in terms of ECs. Most places would expect you to have more than just a few(you only list about 3 or 4 ECs and no volunteering/research/internships).  Now objective stuff, solid scores. You don't mention actual course load but AP Scholar with Distinction hints that you've done at least a somewhat rigorous courseload.  Overall, you're about on track if you're a junior and pretty good if you're a senior."
ApplyingToCollege,30t8yg,SL0P3,0,Sun Apr 5 04:50:12 2015 UTC,"Have you considered doing EdX/Cousera courses? Although the certificates are far from impressive, they're definitely more than just a ""I said I did""'s. If any of your stories have been published you can definitely talk about them(heck, you can talk about them even if you haven't had them published. you could talk about your passion for them/writing). Although your ECs aren't stellar they're definitely not bad. Many of them are somewhat common. Also, only 100 hours the BSA? Most of the people I know had a couple hundred at least. I had 300 as a life scout. The issue is that, although to you might seem swamped, you don't look like someone who is swamped on paper. For example, if I had to allocate your time here is how I would guess it is is spent   8am - 3pm everyday + 1 or 2 hours of homework - School 3pm - 5pm 3 days a week - Soccer 5pm - 6 or 7pm monthly + some entire weekends - BSA 7pm - 9pm every few weeks possibly only part of the year - Drama   All of that really isn't that much.  Also, although your scores may be above all of the people you know at your school, that doesnt mean they're totally competitive at the top schools. Most valedictorians are denied at top schools. Also, dont worry about National Merit, most of what it is good for is scholarships and at top schools you're unlikely to find too many scholarships for it. Although if you decide to go to a state school, it could have been useful.    P.S. I still don't know if you're a junior or a senior."

I didn't realize that I was so averse to the school until a couple weeks ago when I spent an entire day there, sat in on a couple classes, and realized that it just didn't seem like a place that I'd be very happy at."
ApplyingToCollege,30sa7r,blue_surfboard,6,Mon Mar 30 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm going to call you out and give you some tough love- you did screw up this application season. Essentially, you put all your eggs into one basket, and now you are (understandably) in a bit of a panic. Luckily, there is still time way before May 1, when colleges need an official reply.   So, to start, I'm going to need you to get out of this mindset of what makes a school ""good"" or  ""mediocre."" You may not like a school, but that doesn't necessarily make it mediocre, and remember, one person's back up school, could be someone else's top choice. You haven't said what makes this other school ""mediocre"", but you were aiming high by going for MIT, so it's clear to me that you have been blinding by rankings (though, you did do your research on MIT to determine fit, and I have to give you props for that).  Keep in mind, there are over 4,000 colleges in this country. There are at least one or two that will take you, even at this point. Plenty of colleges are still taking applications, even though deadlines have passed. I can't find it at the moment, but there is a list that circulates every year of colleges that are still taking later applications. I would encourage you to just do your research and see what's out there. And yes, many colleges can still offer financial aid and scholarships.   Now, what you still haven't done is list what are your interests in a college- how large or small do you want the student body to be? What majors are you interested in? What types of extracurricular activities would you like to have? What kind of setting, location-wise, do you want the college to be in? Once you can answer these questions, and maybe more, then we can start to help you by suggesting colleges that you may want to look at.  I know some of this might be tough to read, but know that you still have a chance at college, as many other students do. Yes, you could have done the process differently, but what's done is done, and now, all you can do is learn from those mistakes and just move forward with the process. Hope at least some part of this was of help to you!"
ApplyingToCollege,30sa7r,blue_surfboard,2,Tue Mar 31 14:41:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I realize that I screwed up, and as much as I try not to be, I can't honestly say that rankings and acceptance rates don't bias me somewhat.  The 2 main things that concern me about schools that are taking applications still, are:    1) Scholarships and financial aid. The essential question for these schools in this topic is, can I still apply for scholarships and receive a reasonable amount of aid?  2) Honors programs. The essential question for these schools in this topic is, can I still apply for your honors program?  For most schools, even schools that take later applications, the answer to the first question is ""maybe,"" and the answer to the second is ""no."" That's distressing, but I guess I'll just have to deal with it.  As for your questions, I have a few answers.   Size:   I don't really have a preference for this, honestly, but if I had to choose an ideal range, I think I'd say an undergraduate student body of 4-8 thousand.   Extracurriculars:   Anything relating to math or computer science is ideal for me. Maybe a FIRST Robotics Competition team, although that's certainly not required. I'm not sure if it counts as extracurriculars, but a significant research presence - preferably with opportunities for undergraduate research - is a huge plus.   Majors:   A math major and a compsci major are both must-haves. Preferably with either a compsci track with a math/theory/security specialization or a math track with a compsci specialization, but that's not required. I'm interested in cryptography, which is mostly math with some compsci, so that's kind of what I'm looking for. Also, I'm really interested in Russia - its history, language, culture, etc - so having a Russian major/minor program from which I could take a class here or there for humanities requirements would be nice - but again, not required.   Location:   This doesn't matter so much, especially because my preferences have conflicts. On one hand, I want to go away from home, but on the other hand, out-of-state tuition is a bitch."
ApplyingToCollege,30sa7r,topheruknow,3,Wed Apr 1 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, so you have a pretty good list of answers going on here. Now, let's clarify a few things.   You are right in assuming that you likely missed any sort of deadline in applying to Honors programs. But, some colleges let you reapply for honors programs after your first year, so if that is something that is important to you, keep an eye on that. But please don't let that be a deciding factor in what college you decide to attend- most of the time it means just having extra words on your diploma.   Now, again, just to reiterate- lists are always circulated of colleges still accepting applications. Have you looked for this yet? And if colleges are still accepting applications, some will still have the chance for merit scholarships and financial aid. It's best that you don't waste time in doing this research, but you can't just keep thinking that all your hope is lost.   In thinking about cost, please don't generalize in-state vs. out-of-state. Remember that private colleges will cost the same for any type of student regardless, and while the initial price tag may look high, they are usually better at granting financial aid to applicants. But, if you only want to go to a public school, that is a different story entirely. But again, do your research.   Again, you have a lot of great answers, so you know what you want. Off the top of my head, I can't think of colleges that offer what you are looking for, but it doesn't mean they don't exist. Just don't waste more time!"

Congrats on surviving such an ordeal- if anything, the experience of moving provides some great fodder for essays :-)   As far as recs go, the general consensus is that you should use teachers from your junior and senior years because they have a better idea of who you are as a mature student. If somewhere you're applying allows additional rec letters (some I applied to allowed up to four from teachers), though, there might not be any harm in throwing in a letter from your old school. Someone who can vouch for how big an impact you had on your community, how much you're missed, ect could very well be an extra asset.

ApplyingToCollege,30paut,jamster533,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:02:46 2015 UTC,I think one reason why someone might chose to go to say Stanford over UC-Berkeley is that UC-Berkeley offer very little oos financial aid.

For computer science, Berkeley is again third in the world and Georgia Tech is nineteenth.  So although both are very highly ranked universities for EECS, Berkeley is the winner. However, there are other things to consider. I don't know much about Georgia Tech, although I'm applying there myself, but people have actually discouraged me from applying to Berkeley because of the strong hippy/laid-back environment there. Have you visited either one of these universities? That will allow you to get a feel of each campus and decide which one feels better. Also, cost is another big difference. The UC system is infamous for giving very little aid to out of state students, and the cost to attend them can exceed $50,000 per year! But I'm not sure about Georgia Tech's financial aid. Would you feel comfortable sharing how much aid you received from both schools if you have that information? Personally, I would choose Georgia Tech; it's closer to your homestate, it will probably be cheaper, it's in a really big and cool city, and it has a globally respected engineering and cs program, but that's just my opinion."

They changed their name because all they were known for throughout the 70s was their parties). Queen's is a party school too though.  They have the best reputations and on campus recruitment for investment banking positions and such. Their reputations are impeccable, though with Ivey you get HBA rather than BComm.  They are very pricey even for a domestic Canadian student, charging about 50-60k for four years of tuition. None of Canada's top business schools offer co-op (Desautels (McGill), Rotman (UofT), Schulich (YorkU), Queen's Ivey (Western) and Sauder (UBC)).  I'm attending Schulich (YorkU). I chose it over Rotman (UofT) because it is considerably cheaper, and has a better word of mouth reputation. Schulich is just marginally below Ivey and Queen's, with an 87% employment rate after 3 months. Schulich's reputation comes from accounting, with strong on campus recruitment from firms like Deloitte and E&Y. Queen's and Ivey get finance firms like Goldman Sachs, so head there if you can foot the cost. With Ivey you spend two years in their BA BMOS program and need 80%+ and extracurricular to enter Ivey, all the others are virtually impossible to get into as a second year transfer student.  Rankings come from MBA programs, hence Rotman ranks highly while their undergrad is not so great, though improving.  If you don't mind working in Vancouver, Sauder (UBC) is also great. They are largely unknown here in the east coast.  TLDR: I'm going into business in Canada, PM me questions."

At this point it's still a hobby but I'm decent enough that i can make money off it. At worst playing weddings and at best getting into modestly sized pro-orchestras ( I'm not as good as the people who have dedicated their lives to it and end up in big time programs).

You've also done a lot of work towards your major, so you really have that going for you. UCLA this year has accepted a very low amount of undergraduate applicants than previous years. Your SAT is great, I got in with less than yours (2080)  If you're proactive about what you'd want to do in the future, there's no doubt that you would write about it. Really write from the heart (i know, cliche) about what you plan to accomplish with whatever you're passionate about.

As someone who was admitted to UCLA(albeit a few years ago), I doubt that a 2300 is needed for any UC even with a lower GPA. His priority should be his grades.

It apparently accounts for about 30% of that.   So if you're expecting that to save otherwise poor scores alone, you're probably misplacing your hope.

But I would imagine if you're a decent writer, you'd be able to do pretty well with the CR section, or at least be able to improve a lot if it's not your best section.

MIT, Harvard, etc generally take 5 or so early grads a year and those are Terrence Tao style people. Your current corseload is okay...(not too competitive for those schools). Most MIT/Stanford/Harvard/Columbia students had more than 10 AP/College classes before graduating, so even with the 7 you're planning, you're behind. Also, they won't see your scores/grades for the 7 so youll be applying as if you have 3 or so AP classes. This is VERY bad if your highschool offers more. Why not wait a year, be a normal 17 year old at college and have MUCH better shot at the schools especially if there are more AP classes to take or colleges you could takr classes at nearby.  Not to say that it will, but your GPA is from one year. It could easily fluctuate based upom you going from a normal courseload to a ""high achiever"" courseload.   ECs are very common and not all that strong at all, but I wouldn't recommend trying too much more if you're going to be piling on classes.  Although you MIGHT be competitive for UCB, you'll most likely struggle as an early grad there too."

If they offer 13 or so... you'd have 5 per year for the next two years, a perfectly respectable courseload, and you would end up with 13 AP classes which is good. If the 10 is all that they offer, dual enrollment may be necessary.

Anyway, given that some significant number of people who graduate from high school do NOT go to college (they join the military, get a job, become slackers, etc), and it wouldn't make much economic sense for colleges to have a lot of underused capacity, the number of college spots is roughly equal to the number of students who WANT to go to college. Some schools, especially non-residential ones, have some flexibility in the number of students they teach, but I'm sure that flex capacity is much smaller than the number of high school students who choose not to attend college.

You do not recommend an applicant for entrance, you merely are there to recommend a denial. My father's associate Inteview's for Penn-Wharton (undergrad) and she mentioned that this past year, she had two candidates who had things on their resumes that each could not explain in person. One claimed he had an internship with a Congressman but when asked the congressman's name or what his duties were, he drew a blank.   Likewise, she mentioned that the same candidate kept raving about being a first generation college applicant, even in a patronizing way (i.e. you don't understand who I am, I am from Vietnam etc.). The interviewer (my father's associate) actually cut him off to explain that she was also a first generation college student herself, that she came from the Eastern Bloc, and lived under the Iron curtain until she was around 12ish.

For some schools, it wont matter at all what your SAT is alone, you simply can't consider it a safety based on that. SAT scores are not enough to get you into any of the top 20-40 or so national universities or the top 10-20 liberal arts colleges.   You should only really be able to consider a school a safety based purely on your test scores if it's an in-state state school with given auto-admit requirements for SAT scores or if you're applying to schools which very heavily weight hard stats. If the rest of your application package is strong, you can probably expand a bit what you may or may not consider a safety. But the SAT alone won't guarantee you all that much.

ApplyingToCollege,2zb8qg,SoUnhealthy,1 point,Tue Mar 17 03:20:16 2015 UTC,"What type of appeal are we talking about here? If we're talking about appealing an admissions decision (of a deny), I generally would not recommend this, and the phrase above would definitely not help your case."
ApplyingToCollege,2zb8qg,blue_surfboard,1 point,Tue Mar 17 03:29:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, other than that, what should I replace it with?"
ApplyingToCollege,2zb8qg,pitchwhite,3,Tue Mar 17 03:33:33 2015 UTC,"Is this a college that allows appeals? If it doesn't, I would avoid wasting your time and effort. I agree with what /u/blue_surfboard said.   If this was a waitlist/appeals are allowed for some reason, I wouldn't outright state ""my GPA and SAT are subpar"". Perhaps discuss any special circumstances that led you to have trouble with academics, if you did not originally include them in your application. If there are none, then leave it out and focus on why you want to go to the college and what you'll bring to it."
ApplyingToCollege,2zb8qg,blue_surfboard,2,Tue Mar 17 05:16:31 2015 UTC,"So what you're telling me is that this is for an appeal of a decision? Because I'm still of the mind that you should scrap this idea completely.   When a college goes through making decisions, they choose students who are going to be a good fit for the institution. But that goes beyond just the personality- colleges want to be sure that academically, there is also a match and that the student will graduate from the college, ideally in four years! The fact of the matter is, you're already admitting that your academics are not up to the level that is needed for entry into this particular institution. As tough as it might be to do, honestly your best bet might be to just take the loss, and move on. Use this as a time to learn an important lesson, and maybe you set your sights on another college.   Attending a college that is not your number one choice does not make you any less of a student. There are over 4000 colleges out there so there is bound to be at least one that's a great match for you. I sincerely wish you the best on your search."
ApplyingToCollege,2z9h6r,mathANDmeth,6,Mon Mar 16 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"Some people will try to tell you that the SAT is preferred in selective colleges, but I wouldn't buy into that.

ApplyingToCollege,2z9h6r,pitchwhite,1 point,Tue Mar 17 05:13:25 2015 UTC,"Yep. Unless the student walks out of one of them with a totally perfect score, it's definitely best take each at least once.

ApplyingToCollege,2z9h6r,bigdaddyEm,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:23:13 2015 UTC,Problem with ACT is narrow distribution. Tougher to distinguish top scores like 34 vs 35. SAT however has much wider distribution to help differentiate the top scorers.   If I had to choose one test I would choose SAT
ApplyingToCollege,2z9h6r,Sgopal2,1 point,Thu Mar 19 22:40:40 2015 UTC,"A 36 and a 2400 will be very impressive wherever you go.

Take the one you think you can do best on."
ApplyingToCollege,2z893o,sonitary,5,Mon Mar 16 13:17:22 2015 UTC,"There are a great many college students who have never taken an AP class - even those from schools with incredibly strong academics. In some cases, the schools simply didn't offer them - in others, students may not have been academically prepared enough, or may not have wanted the stress of such a courseload. Any college you apply to will receive a school report - if no APs are offered, how on earth can they expect you to have taken them? You are not fucked.  Taking classes, if you can, at nearby universities is a very smart idea. It's essentially doing the same thing as taking the APs, but in some cases, at a far less breakneck pace (which mystifies me, since the APs are over the course of a year, rather than a semester).  As for sure-thing international scholarships? Well, there are no sure things. If you're an academically strong student with a lot of unique talents and clear interests, reach for the stars; the most elite universities tend to have by far the most generous financial aid packages.  Here is a list worth looking at - be sure to research any college before mailing out an application, obviously.   You'll find that a great many schools do offer some financial aid to international students - check out their financial aid site. Be aware, though, that schools tend to award these to students who seem particularly special. That isn't always AP tests - grit and drive will do more for you than you'll ever know."
ApplyingToCollege,2z893o,Creepthan_Frome,3,Mon Mar 16 14:31:37 2015 UTC,"APs certainly are not required for college admission. In fact some high schools here don't even offer them. They may offer a different high-level program instead of AP. Does your school offer the IB (International Baccalaureate) or Cambridge AICE program? From my understanding, those are much more prevalent internationally than the AP program is. I can't speak for other universities, but here at Florida State we treat the AP, IB, and AICE programs as equals when reviewing admission applications."

I think I wrote something misleading earlier, so I'll clear things up now: I've taken pretty much every AP Course offered at my school and never gotten below an A.   As for the ECs, the reason that I said what I said is not to be condescending or anything, its just that my year is a little weaker academically. For example, my year only had 23 kids sign up for APUSH. The year above and below me had about 50 or so sign up. So essentially the GPA drops off really quickly outside of the top 6, like really really fast, so when I say I'm one of the only kids of the top GPA kids with ECs, I'm talking about that group of 6, and I can be pretty certain about this group because I know them really well.

One of the easiest ways to ensure you get through college at little to no cost is to pick a cheap school. State universities are best. Why? Because most states have scholarship programs specifically for in state schools, PLUS as a resident of that state you get the discounted price. Beyond that, because state universities are mostly being funded by the taxpayers, they have larger endowments (scholarship pools) and more available for you. Don't apply private or out of state unless you KNOW they offer full scholarships (most don't). Beyond that the best way to get a full ride is 1) apply early 2) apply to many scholarships early 3) show interest 4) have high grades/test scores  Personal experience: I applied to one state university early (in November), got a few scholarships just for doing that. Kept applying for scholarships, got more. Also had automatic state scholarship sent in. As a result, I not only have a full ride but get an overpayment disbursement each semester."
ApplyingToCollege,2z69nj,ayybubz,0,Mon Mar 16 15:31:22 2015 UTC,"If financial aid is important, you'll definitely need to be applying mostly to schools you know you'll be able to afford. There are a few schools that have automatic partial-full tuition scholarships (the University of Alabama comes to mind), as well as schools that have competitive full tuition scholarships. If you'll need a lot of need-based aid due to a low income, apply to schools that claim to meet 100% of need."
ApplyingToCollege,2z4mk1,CamelMurderer,6,Sun Mar 15 15:11:31 2015 UTC,"It depends on the school. It's really important for many selective universities, but many in-state public universities (excluding the very selective ones) care a lot more about your GPA and standardized test scores.  In general, if the application involves an essay, I'd think the essay has some sort of impact. If the school has a high acceptance rate, hard numbers may mean more."
ApplyingToCollege,2z4mk1,qogofud,2,Sun Mar 15 16:09:33 2015 UTC,"Not every University can invest as much time & effort into their Freshman class as MIT.    In a nutshell, this is how their process goes down:    http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/its_more_than_a_job    According to this blog entry, MIT accepted 1467 applicants this year.    http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mit-regular-action-decisions-now-available-online2    Thats nothing compared to some of the 20K and 30K student schools here in the US.    But, the entrance process has to be fundamentally similar.    Skim the basic entrance numbers.  Scrap anybody that doesn't have the basic grades.  Review the scrap pile for exceptional athletes or similar notable personalities that might merit an exception to academic standards.  Once you've done the easy thinning of the herd, if the pile is still too big to admit all, then you have to start playing favorites.  Your academic record, clubs and extra-curriculars come into play now to paint a picture of you.  But those things are just the outline of your portrait.  The color and depth needs to come from your essay.    Some Universities can accept so large a Freshman class that they don't have to be terribly selective.  But the best Universities are always selective."
ApplyingToCollege,2z4mk1,VA_Network_Nerd,5,Mon Mar 16 02:41:55 2015 UTC,"The simple answer is it depends. Having a bad essay does not boot you automatically but having an essay that is really good can be an excellent tie-breaker.   I talked to some admissions counselors at a pretty prestigious university and what they told me was this: No one makes it in on their essay alone. There's kind of a mass selection round where a lot of apps (for elite schools) get booted because they don't have high enough GPAs and frankly if they came to that school they probably wouldn't graduate. At the end of the day you have to remember that despite how holistic their approach is, Harvard and Stanford both primarily exist to educate and graduate students. Anyways, they usually go onto the teacher recs next and see what kind of person you are qualitatively in the classroom (do you help discussions, do you participate in debates, etc). The feeling they gave me was that the essay is something that is considered towards the end to learn about the applicants and then make final decisions. The essay is essentially a tie-breaker and at that point the process becomes a bit more subjective.   So it really all depends. If you're applying to the University of Colorado, being a little generic probably doesn't matter. If you are talking about Stanford and you made a horrible essay, it matters a lot. Above all, if you're writing it for next year first off good job on being proactive, but be true to yourself. I wrote my essay about my love of chemistry and how it impacted and continues to impact my life and I got a full-ride at a top 25 university so don't worry about having a super original essay or whatever.   Note: I realize that the process I outlined is different than /u/VA_Network_Nerd's but this is for good reason... The school I am referring to (USC), and the applicant pool in general for USC, is very different than that of MIT and accordingly their selection process is very different."

Honestly, getting into a decent college will be very challenging for you at this point.

Not just because, as I mentioned, it's pretty arbitrary at this point and the best students get rejected from all of these schools.

Because, to be quite honest, besides being a part of some special elite group that has evolved out of social construct, each of the Ivies is different and will have a different culture.   What SpecialWhenLit was trying to say (at least what I gained from his response) is that your approach of accepting nothing but the perceived best is only doing you a disservice. Maybe there are (gasp!) other colleges that are not Ivies that are not as selective but would still give you a wonderful and opportunity-filled four years of college! But you wouldn't know because you're not even giving them a glance (not sure if that's true- just assuming here). Please, don't measure your worth by your admittance into colleges that take less than ten percent of their applicants.   Maybe you actually get into an Ivy.

By no means am I saying they're not great schools, but prestige in schools (and life for that matter) is not the only thing.   I have a friend who got accepted to Harvard and another that got accepted to Cornell but both went to USC because at the end of the day they both told me that in their minds they really like the idea of going to those schools but when they actually visited them they just didn't feel like they fit in."

It would be totally fine to submit two sets of ACT scores, one with Writing and one without. We do superscore, which is one of the reasons we can do this. When we go to create a superscore in this scenario, we would simply only have one Writing score to use.   Since the schools you are looking at don't superscore, I'd recommend checking with them individually to see how they will handle it.

As for UNC, the more you can massage your hard stats, the better your chances. Try to bring that GPA up  a touch and your ACT more towards the 32-34 range and plenty of doors could be open to you.

I don't think HYP discriminate against homeschoolers; it's just that without a class rank, they have very little to go on for how good your academic performance was. So then they go back to your SAT and ACT, which are pretty low for the Ivies."

I could learn something I'm interested in, read a book, or volunteer but instead Im expected to spend lots of their time studying for a single saturday that tells them their ""worth.""  I never said they discriminated against me? I havent even applied. They don't admit homeschoolers at the same rate as other students. We, homeschoolers, average in the top 15% for test scores and yet are admitted at a lesser rate. As someone who goes to a homeschool co-op where the average ACT is over 30 and graduates on average 50 students a year, we have never had anyone accepted to HYP(according to my counsellor who has been there for 15 years) nor do I know any homeschoolers who have been admitted.   To the no backup thing, college classes. I've only taken 3 or so homeschool classes in highschool. Everything else is in college. If you take 90% college classes and never get a B you would be the valedictorian of any highschool in the country the only difference is that I don't have to sit in class all day. Do college transcripts not backup grades?"
ApplyingToCollege,2yg3jx,mrspiffy12,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:22:09 2015 UTC,"Well, difficulty comparing yourself to and dealing with peers is most likely a key factor in lower admit rates for home-schooled kids. Comments like ""If you take 90% college classes and never get a B you would be the valedictorian of any highschool in the country"" speaks a bit to your lack of perspective. As a home-schooled student, you have to go out of your way to prove you're a well-balanced, well-adjusted kid who has done more in the past four years than just sitting in the back corner of a community college classroom studying away. I don't think your test scores are a real problem, but the idea that you think they're beneath you is concerning. SATs may seem to be a waste of time to you and they may be flawed, but to colleges who are looking at students who come from a wide array of academic backgrounds (yourself being a prime example), it's a key tool in helping to give perspective on academic achievement from such different backgrounds. It will matter for college admissions, and many employers will want to look at it as well.  The key problem I see in your application alone is that you do seem to lack balance. You've done a couple activities, but don't seem to show much interest, passion, or progression. You taken a ton of courses, but don't seem to show much focus and haven't translated those things to much outside of the classroom (unless ""simple research/science fair stuff"" for example is a lot more compelling than you make it sound). I think it's up to you to take the time you have left before applications are due to put yourself out there and translate what seems to be an obvious intellectual curiosity into action, passion, or progression beyond simply a wide selection of online courses. Then you'll need to find a way to tie everything together into a compelling story with your essays and recommendations.  With that in mind, I think it may also be in your best interests to re-evaluate some of your college targets based on your background and interests. Fluffy intellectual curiosity may play well with schools like UChicago and Williams, but places like Dartmouth and Claremont Mckenna are a much different story where they really value a much different type of student. I mean, do you really want to end up at schools where a huge portion of the students have a heavy, well-set pre-professional bent as opposed to a more purely academically inclined student body? Have you considered how well you might fit at work hard, party hard type schools like these which have a heavy social fit aspect?"
ApplyingToCollege,2yg3jx,green_griffon,1 point,Tue Mar 10 18:52:03 2015 UTC,"So you are saying the valedictorian of any high school in the country gets a 2100 on the SAT? Your score is good as a sophomore, but if you refuse to take it again and/or refuse to take test prep on general principle, then you will be applying with a 2100 SAT.    50 kids a year over 15 years is 750 kids. Do the math on how many high school seniors there are vs. how many students HYP admit each year and you will see that no admits out of 750 kids is no great surprise.    Look, these schools care about one thing over all others, which is have you distinguished yourself among your peer group. This is primarily based on class rank (for academics) and being selected for leadership positions by adults (for extracurriculars). As a homeschool student you have no class rank, so there goes that. And I did not see a lot of leadership in your extracurriculars. There are some intriguing things, ""Helped to organize an entirely new way to tutor children with less income"", ""Started an online learning initiative at my college, 50-100 people have gone through it"", but they could mean a lot or a little.    There are other opportunities to set yourself apart from your peers, the standardized tests being one of them, but with your scores so far you have not done that yet."

If it grows at half of that speed because higher scores are harder, I would get a 34.  3/4 of the class applys to HYP, that would be over 1000 applications, assuming they each apply to two, averaging a 30+ on the ACT e.g. near average applicants.

Id like to go to a school of that caliber e.g. top 20 without the prestige seekers of HYP.   Like it or not, prestige of your undergrad is absolutely critical to your future career, regardless of whether that career is professional or academic in nature. You're not gaining anything by desperately trying to find a way to look down on the people who go to some of the best schools in the world. On top of that, many of the kids I know who went to HYP and the people who've since graduated have often been among the most intelligent and down to earth people I've met. Obviously there are exceptions (and some assholes who live off the name of their undergrad), but being a top student at a top school generally doesn't equal asshole beyond the level of your average undergrad.    I dont doubt they will go up; I just refuse to waste months prepping.   What statement are you trying to make by refusing to improve on something you're so confident you can improve on? You're acting silly, rethink that.    Also, the average applicant gets an associates degree before their junior year? I should get to work.   Most applicants to top schools take plenty of college level coursework, be it through AP, IB, or cross-registration. Do you have an associates degree? Or do you just think you have enough coursework for one? Because none of those credits will transfer.  Most applicants will also need to demonstrate a high degree of excellence well beyond the scope of their coursework.  If you want to come to places like this subreddit to ask for advice, that's fine. But if you just want to come to massage your own ego and try to seek affirmation on the opinion that you're far more unique and far more competitive than everyone else applying to these schools, that won't help you at all. To be 100% honest, you're a reasonably marginal candidate right now with a lot of flaws to your story.

If you walk into an interview at one of your schools and say this kind of thing, they won't care about you. You sound pretentious.  And no, getting above 30 the ACT does not get you into HYP. No, not getting Bs in college level classes doesn't make you valedictorian. If anything, you have plethora of college classes with no real way to compare you to any other students. You need AP and IB scores, but if those aren't possible, then SAT and Subject Test scores are needed.

When I was in highschool, I asked the adcomsat a couple top tier schools-Georgia Tech, MIT, and Stanford- about that exact issue and they all told me basically this, ""your goal should be to get college credit for it; AP or actual college works.""  Also, I don't care to get involved with this drama, but I don't see where he wants the SATs to be his strong point?

HYP, and a lot of the schools I've toured, didn't fit that discription.

Any top range schools will look at them but they dont seem to be the deciding factor.  In my opinion, taking the test any more than about 4 times between junior and senior year is a bad idea. Your score probably wont move all that much and you're just wasting time prepping and Saturdays after a point.  If you actually get around a 2200/33, there is no need to take it again IMO. No college is going to deny you based upon a 2200 and very few top colleges will admit you based upon it(or any score higher anyway), but after that it seems like they sorta say ""Okay, he has the potential, what else does he offer?"""

I probably could have gotten at least a 34 to 36 if I actually studied for the test. I honestly felt that the ACT was much easier, but do what you are comfortable with.

Scaling is usually less forgiving. You do all of the problems for one subject at a time.   SAT tends to have fewer questions that are more difficult. Scaling is usually a bit more forgiving. Subjects are broken up into multiple sections.

Most schools actually submit a sheet (the common data set I think) which describes what traits they weight most heavily in applications, I'd go look those up and that should give you some better perspective.   The story as a whole (combination of ACTs, background, GPA, essays, activites, recommendations) and how it fits together is the critical factor. You can almost never count on just one outlier to make you, unless it's something absolutely incredible (which even perfect scores on the SAT/ACT are not).

Look at Brown, they accept less than 1/4 of 36ers. Also, your score isn't that stellar. It is just in thr middle 50 for those schools.  For example, if your GPA is only around a 3.7 or you've taken easy classes throughout HS you might be looked at as a slacker or someone who prepped tons. If you have no ECs they might think you're someone who spends all of his time studying and doesn't care about/do much else.  Most colleges want people and not just stats. They help get you through that first thumb through but ECs, essays, GPA, courserigor, recs, and hooks mean just as much.  You're not even at the top of the middle 50% If just being in the middle 50 guaranteed admission, everyone that wanted to would get into those schools so banking on going to them is a very bad idea."

College admissions would be a lot simpler that way, but they would also end up with very wacky classes and they would have to accept that the only type of smarts they want are test smarts(not to downplay the correlation between tests and success, it's just that there are lots of other factors such as music, art, being really strong in one field, etc).  Lots of the colleges want a diverse group of students, one where people are the best at lots of different things. Everything from being a national level singer to being a professional bowler could help. That is the thing about schools near the top, they aren't looking for anything test score or specific GPA, they're looking for people that will contribute and they have tons of people to pick from. When schools like UChicago and Princeton get 30,000+ of the best applicants(average ACT is around 31-32 for applicants) and only have to chose 2,000 of them they have the ability to not compromise at all.

Once you're admitted, Ivies don't want to lose you. I have a friend (X), who was accepted SCEA at Harvard, who did much worse than you in the second semester of their senior year due to senioritis. Harvard sent X a warning letter; this is protocol, and it is a scary situation because, as I understand it, this is the last step Harvard takes before officially rescinding an offer of admission. X replied and everything was fine; I got a feeling that it was almost a formality on Harvard's part because once you're in, you're in. Basically, you have to seriously fuck up to get your admission revoked. Like criminal offense, sexual assault, etc. I can't say for sure, but I feel like I could have gotten all Bs my second semester of senior year and been fine by Harvard's standards (i.e., Harvard wouldn't have sent me a warning letter).

ApplyingToCollege,2xzkyv,pitchwhite,1 point,Thu Mar 5 05:39:55 2015 UTC,"First off - good to hear that you're getting help with your OCD. That's great.   While we're not on the same level as a school with Columbia's prestige, here at Florida State we still take senior grades seriously. Students earning poor grades (we say anything below C-) in their senior year have had their admission rescinded.   As for what you should do, I'd recommend that you contact Columbia's Admissions Office and explain the situation. I'm sure most other admission officers would agree with me that we'd really like to know about this stuff as far in advance as possible. Remember, our job is to help students get into our schools, not to keep them out. The sooner a student tells us about the potential for poor senior grades, the more time we have to help them out. Or you can think of it the opposite way. The later we find out, the less time we have to help you, and the less time you have to figure out a backup plan in the event that your admission is rescinded.   The students who bury their heads in the sand and hope that we won't actually check their final transcripts are fooling themselves. Some wait until they are enrolled before sending their final transcripts, thinking that once they are on campus there's nothing we can do. That's wrong. If we don't get your final transcript, we'll place a hold on your future registration until we get it. Then when we get it and find out the student didn't meet their conditions of admission, we switch their enrollment from Degree-Seeking to Transient (one term only).  Now back to your specific situation. I know nothing of the admissions process at Columbia and I obviously can't speak for them, but I think you will probably be fine if you contact them soon and explain the situation. I'd also suggest asking Columbia if they'd like a letter from your mental health professional to help explain your situation. They almost certainly can't rescind your admission due to a mental health disorder, as I'm pretty sure that would be illegal.  Also, if you do end up enrolling at Columbia, you should reach out to their student disability center to see if there is anything they can do to help you on your path to graduation. I bet they have counseling services and other such programs that will help you continue to succeed in school."

However, many require 3-4 to graduate from their school without having to take forge in language there.  I only took 3 years of Spanish because my schools need 3 to graduate, but it doesn't matter because I'm going to take either German or Polish.  Also, my Spanish 3 teacher was a massive cunt and made me lose interest in taking Spanish 4.  You don't need 4 years, the colleges really don't care if you stopped after 3 years, and it would look better to take a class similar to your intended major or another AP class."

For the very top schools, you'll probably want to improve them a little. If you can secure leadership positions by junior/senior year, that'd really boost your application, too. Your involvement in all the edX stuff is really interesting, but I'm not sure it'll help as much as having a couple of leadership positions on your application.

The issue with homeschooling is that I really have nowhere to expand in terms of leadership. My CC offers very few clubs and starting one is hard because they force you to spend a year going through the ""process"" and then by that time half the students who wanted it are gone. The EdX courses offered me the ability to make my homeschooling courses ""true"" courses, and the certificates at least gave a little bit to back up my classes. Although I've tried to take everything possible at the local community college, the highest courses they offer are very easy. The highest math offered was college algebra... the highest science was botany... I really want to learn more but I hate the test prep attitude and there are very few opportunities for classes.  Do you have any suggestions for leadership? I'm doing summer research this summer but honestly, I think my test scores are going to hold me back a little.

A 31 won't be too competitive for top schools (it's not bad, by any means!) in my opinion, but it depends on what you personally consider a threshold. Someone may say that a 2200 and 2300 are different, and someone else may argue differently; obviously, there's no right answer because there are no official cutoffs. It's more up to your standards. I just think that a 31 ACT is not super competitive because it translates to a <2100 SAT score, which is really not competitive for top schools either."

Where do I want to be at? Harvard and Princeton's middle 50% include 31, it is at the middle of Brown's middle 50%, at Cornell it is the mean, and my SS(U Chicago superscores IIRC) is in UChicago's middle 50%. Is it necessary to be in that top 25%? The last time I took it was in October so I was just barely even a Sophomore, but I hate the testing as well as the ""oh your tests score are all that matters"" philosophy that tons of people seem to have.  Is it worth my time to get a 33-35? I dont know what all schools release them but at Brown, the admission difference between 29-32 and 32-35 isn't much of a difference at all. Is it worth my time to waste a summer prepping, or would I be better off researching or working on something I care about?  Thanks again!  P.S. What were your scores/GPA for H?"

In my opinion, it's tough to look at brackets such as the ones you listed (""Harvard and Princeton's middle 50% include 31"") because they're not super indicative of 'normal' students who get accepted, especially at schools like the top Ivies where legacies and athletic recruits are not always held to the same stringent standards that an Asian female from an overrepresented state (lol me), for instance, may be. For example, for recruited athletes (especially true for some sports, like football...), their test scores should be decent so that Harvard can maintain its reputation, but they don't have to be great. They're not being recruited to really add any academic value to the institution, if that makes sense.  Given that you're only a sophomore, I think it actually is worth retaking. You should definitely spend your summer doing research or another meaningful activity, but I almost want to suggest doing both: studying for the ACT and doing a summer activity. I know nothing about your situation, however, so I realize that may be a lot of work. You should consult with some other people about your options!

Stats:  My school does not rank and instead gives colleges a GPA distribution and the 25 and 75 percentiles.   My cumulative GPA is a 98.1 out of 100 (my school does not use the conventional scaling). The way it works is that 98.1 is weighted and I receive 0.6 points for any AP or Honors class added onto my yearly GPA. So if I get a 95 in all my classes but they are all AP/Honors then my GPA would be a 98 if I took 5 classes.

The only other potential weakness I can really think of is your lack of leadership in pre-professional (basically, not cultural or social) organizations, but I think Siemen's and AIME are also incredible, so... Also, no need to take the ACT. Your SAT score is just fine, haha.  It's really up to how well you write your essays.

It also depends on what colleges you're aiming for and how many subject tests your classmates tend to take. I'm not sure that number of subject tests and admission are entirely correlated, but I'm at Harvard, and most of my friends took at least three subject tests (usually four).

Big state school or small LAC (liberal arts college)? Rural, city, or suburbs? What sort of things would you want a dream college to have?

ApplyingToCollege,2wv4gw,NoBeFat,5,Mon Feb 23 12:12:08 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it's precisely the opposite: going to an underprivileged high school can help your chances. Obviously, that's a pretty general statement, and you still have to do really well (like close to, if not, 4.0 unweighted GPA, great extracurriculars, strong application essays, etc.), but you'll be given leeway by admissions officers if they see that you succeeded—even if not to the same extent that a prep school student would have—in an environment that didn't encourage you to succeed.  I'm an overrepresented minority (read: Asian) that went to a bad, underperforming high school, excelled, and ended up at a top university. I didn't do as much as my current college classmates, but they went to better high schools and had more opportunities; colleges will take that into account."
ApplyingToCollege,2wv4gw,qogofud,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"I think going to a disadvantaged school hurts if your class rank is bad but helps admissions offices put your  standardized scores into perspective.  Think of it this way for class rank: Is it more impressive to be the valedictorian of Stuyvesant (the top ranked high school in the US) or some unknown ghetto school with an 80% dropout rate?  Now on the contrary, is it easier to score 5s in 10 APs and 700+ in SAT subject tests in the ghetto school with a poor quality education or in a prep school with an after school tutoring service?  So, I'd say going to a disadvantaged school helps if your class rank is high by mitigating the impact of low SAT/AP scores, but hurts if your class rank is low. What would be considered high or low depends on which schools you're applying to.   I'm probably gonna apply next year to some colleges but I haven't gotten any A's in most of my core classes and I haven't started becoming ""well-rounded"" yet.

Reading over this thread, it seems like you're obsessed with prestiege and just trying to game the MIT system. If you did decide to apply to MIT as an uncommon major just for the ""boost"", you'd probably get rejected. MIT knows how to weed kids out like you. Also the ""boost"" is minimal, if at all."

On the other hand, at a large public school with impacted majors, your intended major probably makes more of a difference.  In any case, being a strong applicant is the best way to gain admission.  Also, this is just my point of view, but studying something that is clearly not a school's strong department (like studying humanities at MIT...) is perfectly respectable but may be off-putting to company recruiters during your search for post-grad jobs."

ApplyingToCollege,2w4ac9,Creepthan_Frome,2,Mon Feb 16 23:48:12 2015 UTC,"So, you're going to apply; that's what I meant by interest.  My point is that there is a reason that the vast majority of MIT students are majoring in engineering or some other science; if you know from the beginning that engineering/science is not your interest, MIT would not be a good fit for you because it is a school heavily populated with certain types of students. I don't know from firsthand experience, but I have many friends who got into MIT and the college I attend, and intentionally chose to attend my college. Yes, there are many colleges in the Boston area, but it's not realistic to expect to spend a good amount of time at another college if you are not technically a student there.  On the other hand, if you plan on applying as another major to boost your chance of admissions, that would really only work if you were a very qualified applicant anyway. I mean high SAT score, high science subject test scores, stellar grades, great extracurriculars, etc.  I'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding your intentions; I just wanted to share my honest opinion, having gone through the admissions process at elite schools not so long ago."

Anyway good luck with that college thing. If you can handle youth baseball parents complaining about your strike zone, then college should be a breeze."

ApplyingToCollege,2w2wof,qogofud,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:14:40 2015 UTC,"No problem! Well, both are important and I'm sure the UCs look at both, but the weighted GPA can be misleading if context isn't given. Does your transcript have a spot for UC GPA? Mine did and I went to HS in CA; it's a separate GPA calculated for the UC schools. Either way, rank and school background information can help provide context to the admissions committees. For example, my weighted GPA was 4.40, but I was ranked #1. That weighted GPA may indicate a totally different rank at another HS. Your HS should offer this information, so visit your counselor.  Extracurricular activities are a huge deal for most competitive schools, including the UCs. It demonstrates passion, leadership (that's why leadership roles are important), interest outside of the classroom, good time management, drive, initiative, etc. If it came down to two applicants with the same stats and essays, but one had more impressive extracurriculars, the more involved applicant would get accepted."

ApplyingToCollege,2w2wof,qogofud,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:38:55 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, classes aren't truly extracurriculars, even if they're classes such as art and music.  Extracurriculars mean activities, such as journalism (like student newspaper), sports, community service organizations, speech and debate club, business/finance club, etc... I'm just naming off some typical ones. They don't have to be within the school; doing research in a lab at a university certainly counts, too.  Are you a part of any organizations? Doing nothing outside of class is a huge red flag to the top UCs, but getting heavily involved in your junior year to make up for a lack of activities also looks like a desperate attempt at resume-padding, so I'd be careful!"

If you have no ECs (extracurriculars), you have to be more realistic about your college goals; UCLA and UCSD may be pretty difficult to get into. It's not the end of the world, though; you should join a club (even saying that you're a member is better than nothing) that sounds interesting to you, such as community service or something like that, and definitely get involved in something over the summer. Internship, research, something. I think summer's your best bet since loading up on ECs at this point in your high school career will be obvious to admissions committees."

Stat-wise, I'm in the right range, but I'm planning to call admissions tomorrow morning. Fortunately, UIUC has an appeals process, but they do not consider   7th or 8th semester grades New extra-curricular activities or awards Test scores received by our office after February 12 Letters of recommendation  I have a hunch that although my essays were at least decent (2 revisions) they may not have appealed directly to my computer science major, but I was also denied from general studies which was my fallback.

ApplyingToCollege,2vtrg6,qaryoak,2,Sat Feb 14 05:52:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the question! Appeals are a great topic.  I don't have much info on that specific university, but I can share some general info based on what my school does which may be helpful for other students here as well.   The appeals process is really a rubber-stamp kind of thing, its there because it has to be there. It is rare that appeals have a positive outcome. The reason is that they're not looking for students to beg for acceptance but to show something that was overlooked in the initial review process. Things like new merits (better test score, higher GPA) or proof of a hardship will change an admissions decision. Better essays or new activities (unless you've done something really big) rarely have an impact. Unless a student has new merits or hardship proof, I do not recommend putting yourself through the appeals process. You want to move on to other schools instead of wasting time, which is basically money now that we are in the spring semester.    Typically, if you receive a denial letter it will give you other options depending on your situation. Sometimes it will say you are admissible under a different program or maybe not at all. It may encourage you to apply later as a transfer student which is a frequently overlooked option. If you really want to be a certain school, go elsewhere for a semester or two and reapply. You probably will not get the best financial aid package, but you are much more likely to be accepted."

ApplyingToCollege,2vtrg6,Frodolas,1 point,Sat Feb 14 20:27:35 2015 UTC,"Good question.  Typically little to none. The primary deciding factors for a college are academic. They need things that prove you'll be successful. Character and drive (commonly mentioned in rec letters) are secondary. If the letter is from someone important to the school (grad w/highest honors, former student body pres, staff member, community entrepreneur, gov. leader, etc), at some institutions that will tip a borderline app to the acceptance side. At a school that is purely merits, it can make a good app better. Maybe you'll get invited to the Honors College or get a scholarship. However, regardless of how the school weighs things in decisions, if you're far off on the merits it won't have an effect.  Edit: should add that having a rec letter from a teacher who graduated with good academics or is fairly well known among alums because of their legacy at the school is going to be around medium impact. Has been known to tip scales on borderline decisions. Because they are most likely to be able to gauge your chances of academic success, very trustworthy reference."

ApplyingToCollege,2vrihl,DatOdyssey,1 point,Fri Feb 13 13:42:09 2015 UTC,"Many students like yourself who plan on going into graduate programs later on tend to overrate their Bachelor's degree. Did you know there are English majors going to Medical School now? Where you get the Bachelor's really doesn't mean much anymore and I'm not sure if there was ever a point in time when it did. The last thing you want going into a grad program, whether its business or medical is debt. That will make it more difficult for you to get financial aid to get that MBA or MD. Something a lot of students also don't realize is that going to a bigger school with more resources does not necessarily mean you'll get to use them. Internships are more competitive at bigger schools. Lab time (other than assigned) is limited. Professors often don't have time for students and push them off on assistants. This is why prestige is not relevant. It is not a guarantee of success or intellect, and other institutions along with employers are well aware of that fact. A smaller school with at least average resources is good enough, it becomes great when you get a good scholarship package with it. I go to a smaller university and I am part of the Honors Program there. I can tell you from experience that everything I've tried to make happen academically and socially has. I've gotten personal internship recommendations from professors. I know the Director of the Honors Program. Those are the kinds of things that will shape your future and make a difference on grad school applications and further, because I've faced less competition in accessing resources I have more experience in my field.   Summary: Do not choose prestige over everything else, it is not a guarantee of success. Access to resources is more important than them just being there.

I had a few major extracurriculars in high school - lots of sports (I was hardly an all-star athlete - I was just enthusiastic), and I edited the school's yearbook. But in my own junior year, because I was seriously interested in museum work, I sought out a volunteer job at the Museum of Natural History in NYC (just a trainride away from my home, so not a big trek). They weren't advertising or anything - I just asked.  I ran one of the more crowded information desks on Saturday mornings and early afternoons. It wasn't museum work, exactly, but I put myself out there because I really had a passion for museums. And I really enjoyed it. Plus, I knew exactly where everything was, including each and every toilet in the museum. If you wanted to find the whale, I could give you very complicated directions to get there. Or the totem poles. Or the pteranodon. I was totally part of the museum's crew/  And on paper? That shows in a big way.  So what do you love? What is your THING?

It doesn't have to be something ""everyone is doing"" (NHS, president of something, summer classes) -- in fact, doing something a bit out of the norm often stands out more because it shows you've found what you're passionate about.  If you enjoy programming, keep doing that. Teaching yourself something on your own time absolutely counts. If you can by next year, some kind of tangible product is even better (make something you can refer to and talk about).   Here's my advice -- and I sorta had the same problem as you -- you're a junior and there's still time. Yes, senior year picks up so you probably won't have much/any free time then, but that's still time. You have the rest of this year and a whole summer.   Identify a couple things you enjoy and reach out to people. Your college counselor, teachers, friends, etc. Tell people what you're doing/what you wanna do and you may be surprised by the things they may suggest (this contest, this job, that opportunity).

Rather, it should be something you really want to do. I'm not saying that it is entirely your fault, but as somebody who had 4 leadership roles by the time I graduated, I can say that picking something you like and sticking to it is way more important than doing things that ""look good"". When I reflect on the people I knew in high school and the things they got involved with, it was very centric to their personality.  The truth is any involvement, whether a leadership role or not, is a valuable experience. This isn't about being who colleges want you to be, its about being who you want to be. My counselor always told me to be ""authentic"" and that is exactly what I think you need to do. Being on JV soccer isn't bad, that's learning teamwork and what it means to work as a unit.

Now there is a chance that you were put directly into the accept pile at UCB but without knowing your stats it is hard to say that this is the case.

Even people who think they know what they want to major in often change their minds at some point while they're in college. Some people have no clue whatsoever what they want to major in; you've narrowed it down to science/medical stuff, so that's a start.   I would suggest looking at various careers that interest you and seeing what employees of said occupations typically major in to give you a general idea. Also, try and knock out some majors by what you know you don't like. Do you dislike the math side of science? Then maybe not go for a chem or physics degree. Hate the living side of science? Don't major in bio. There are a lot of good career and major resources online that might help you. Do a quick Google search and it'll turn up a lot of stuff.  Lastly, most colleges don't require their students to declare a major until the end of their sophomore year, so you have plenty of time. Like /u/McMuffler siad, freshman and sophomore years are mainly general education requirements, so you can get a better idea of what you like to do.

You have a good idea of what you want to do.  So here is the best advice i can give you. When you're initially applying to a school and ""select your top major choices"" you choose the one that most interest you. Generally, you will only take intro classes or light basics of what you will be doing in that class early in your college career. In these classes you will be able to see if you are actually interested and devoted to this discipline. If you are great! If not, you should be able to easily change to what you would like to study.  I am in the same boat, I am only a freshman who was worried about wasting hours and money. But luckily I will lose nothing and only gain hours towards my desired major.

How many APs are offered at your school, on average how many do students take applying to the schools you are interested in, etc.  If there are 20 Aps and most students take 6 and you take 5 it is not a huge difference.  If most students applying from your school are taking 8 and you are at 5 then that won't help you at all.  The other thing is while it's better to get an A in an AP class it is not good to get a C in an AP class.  If you take AP English and do poorly that will have consequences, even if they don't see your senior year grades you will have to submit them at some point and apps can go into grade review.  Really changing 1 class won't have any major affect on your application."

If everyone was taking 6 and you took 5 you would be at a slight disadvantage, very slight.  Really 1 ap course is not a huge difference maker.  If every applicant had the exact same credentials, essays, lrs, ecs, etc and you had 2 less ap it might make a slight difference.

That being said, I sense that a lot depends on which country you're applying from; for instance, a Korean international has to be stellar to get into Harvard.  Not sure what your TOEFL translates to, but your SAT is, unfortunately, not super competitive. Again, I don't know how that affects you; it could sway either way, right? A low score may be more justified for an international applicant (non-native English speaker) OR it may mean you're not prepared for the rigor of a top Ivy school. I'm not sure, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.  Your alumnus recommendation for Harvard sounds interesting—what's that about? Did he simply graduate from Harvard or does he still have ties to the Harvard community?  Depending on how admissions regards your essay, I'd say your best chance is with Cornell.

ApplyingToCollege,2vayl5,theschizophreniac,5,Mon Feb 9 21:09:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your feedback.  Luckily, I'm not from China, India or Korea. In fact, I'm from a rather underrepresented country (Turkey).According to the only SAT prep school in the country, my SAT  score is probably the 5th-7th highest in the nation this year (and that includes expat kids who are native speakers). Neither my native language nor my school's language of instruction is English, so I'm hoping they can provide some leeway with the critical reading and writing scores.  If it means anything I know of 3 people who got in from my country with lower scores and 2 people who got in with higher scores and all of them were from English language schools.  I think the TOEFL is more like a pass/fail thing. Regular colleges require an 80, the ivies require a 100.  Of course, I forgot to mention that I only sent my score to Dartmouth because Harvard, Yale and Amherst don't require it, and Cornell gave me a waiver because my CR score was high enough.  The recommendation is from a former neighbor who knew me pretty well. He is a recent graduate and somewhat active in the Harvard community (he does interviews and all that).  With all that said, I'm still not really expecting to make it to the Big H (or Yale for that matter)  and it would be a blessing if I got in. Cornell isn't that great with financial aid, so I have my fingers crossed for Dartmouth and Amherst. If that doesn't work out I still have 13 more schools :)  Are you applying as well? If you are, good luck to you too.  Edit: Holy shit! I've been selected for an interview for Yale! Interviews aren't given to everyone in my country. This is huge. Aww Yess!!"

That provides some context (about the SAT score); your applications are submitted anyway, so no need to fret at this point, right? :P  A letter of rec from current teaching faculty or a significant donor would hold a lot of weight, but I'm not sure how much your alumnus recommendation will actually help you. That being said, it doesn't hurt!  Yeah, Cornell's pretty terrible with financial aid... Out of the colleges I was accepted to, Cornell expected me to pay the most in their financial aid package, haha.  I'm a current Harvard undergrad, just looking to offer advice to any applicants I see on Reddit. :) I'm happy to hear you got an interview from Yale - best of luck!

ApplyingToCollege,2uzmtt,dumbentrepreneur,3,Fri Feb 6 15:09:06 2015 UTC,"Your college transcripts are always in the light, hence why they ask you to send in all of your college transcripts when you apply for transfer.  Yes, having professional experience may help, but this is for a bachelor's program so that may not hold the weight you may think it would. If you were to apply for graduate programs, however, that is an amazing thing to look at.  You want to get good grades when you go back to community college. It is cheaper than going straight into a 4 year. Depending on where you want to transfer to, they might need letters of rec. I know first hand that UCs don't. What also looks good is that you went back to try to get a degree. This can be reflected in your application essays. Showing who you are and how your experiences as a CEO affected your life and how you want to attempt school again would be a great place to start when writing these essays.   Good luck!"
ApplyingToCollege,2uzmtt,sirziggy,1 point,Fri Feb 6 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughts. Would it be worth exploring an admissions strategy with a college counselor, or would they just point me to a community college and say ""good luck""?  Second, do you think the chances of me getting into an MBA program without a bachelor's degree is higher than me getting into an undergrad program, provided I have an outstanding GMAT score?"
ApplyingToCollege,2uzmtt,sirziggy,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:14:21 2015 UTC,"It's always worth it to talk to an admissions counselor, or even someone from the faculty of the program you would like to go into. When I was looking through my options in Theatre programs, I sent out emails to a faculty member of the school that I didn't hear talked about among my peers. He invited me to audit a class of his so we could talk about the program. I didn't go to that school in the end, but he provided me with a more informative opinion on their program. Lucky for me, he went to graduate school at my current institution, so it was even more beneficial to me.  There is a 0% chance you'd get into an MBA program without a Bachelors in something. This is also true if you were to apply to any graduate program (MA, PhD, MD, MFA, etc). You could take the GMAT (or the GRE) without having a degree, but obtaining an MBA is contingent on having a Bachelor's degree. That said, you don't have to pursue a Business undergraduate degree to get an MBA, you could also study Biology, Music, Sociology, or Engineering."

ApplyingToCollege,2uzmtt,GuyWhoLikesToComment,2,Fri Feb 6 20:39:03 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about this too. If OP is really a learn who picks up a ton of books and crams (and does well doing so), then the GMAT should be an easy test for him to do well on. All he needs to do is go into a local book store and buy a cheap prep book or find some exercises online. The GMAT doesn't really require most things learned during a bachelor's degree. I think OP is selling himself short or doesn't really understand what the GMAT really is."
ApplyingToCollege,2uzmtt,GuyWhoLikesToComment,1 point,Fri Feb 6 21:12:50 2015 UTC,"You could be right. I took a sample test out of the blue with no prepping and it looked like it was throwing out differential equation problems, so I just assumed the technicalities were well over my head.  Separately, I figured it'd be easier to get into a bachelor program with experience than it would to get into an MBA program without a bachelor's. If you think the latter is easier, I would certainly pursue it!"
ApplyingToCollege,2uzmtt,green_griffon,3,Fri Feb 6 21:41:41 2015 UTC,"There should be no DiffEq problems on the GMAT. Actually... I've got a prep book under my bed... I'll just look right now.   Ok, here is a quote from the book (Kaplan Premier 2015) ""you don't need any background knowledge or expertise beyond fundamental math and verbal skills."" As for fundamental math, that would be about the level of math you would complete on a HS standardized test (ACT/SAT): mostly basic algebra and geometry. Although the GMAT has special ""data sufficiency"" problems that you have probably never experienced before. They like to claim that the GMAT is the only test that uses such types of problems.   This link is pretty good for finding out GMAT/GPA scores for most U.S. MBA programs: http://business-schools.findthebest.com/  I know (more like strongly think) UChicago and MIT will both consider candidates WITHOUT bachelor's degrees.   Given your highly successful background, you may be a good candidate for those programs."
ApplyingToCollege,2uzmtt,JohnPooley,1 point,Fri Feb 6 23:11:33 2015 UTC,"I would suspect many MBA programs won't care about your lack of bachelor's degree given your experience, in fact I think they will like you better for your uniqueness. And you can ace the GMAT if you have half (or maybe three-quarters of) a brain.  Now, given your mention of ""impostor syndrome"" you may be wanting to launder your credentials by going to community college first rather than have people in your MBA program ask about what college you went to, but fuck 'em! If they get snooty just smack them with your wallet."

ApplyingToCollege,2uu0jj,Sgopal2,1 point,Sun Feb 8 00:34:34 2015 UTC,"Hi, American Colleges look at your entire profile when you apply, so there's no one single factor that will (by itself) make you stand out, unless you've done something extremely outstanding (international sports person, made a million dollars from an app you designed etc.)  That being said, there are plenty of ways that you can improve your profile and your chances.    Do well on the SAT I and take the SAT IIs even if they aren't required, as it will give you an edge over candidates who have not done so (provided you do well!)  Keep up your high school grades as they are important as well. 3.7/3.8 is good but the higher the better! Make the most of your ECA activities. Run for president, take part in competitions or better yet, start a new ECA! It's always nice to be able to call yourself a founder.  This may not be relevant to you right at this moment but when you do start, remember that the Common App essay is really important. I've known students who've received offers almost solely on the strength of their essays. It's also one of the easiest ways to stand out - if you're applying to top schools there'll be dozens of other people with profiles similar to yours, the essay is where you can show or tell them something that makes you unique! Make sure you make use of the Additional Information section of the common App as well. Don't forget to make use of all the options available. Applying Early Action or Early Decision to a school can give you an edge over anyone who is not doing so.    Remember, aiming for a top school is a long term process so start building your profile now. Don't forget to do your research on schools as well, and it never hurts to have an idea of what major you want to take early. While brand name schools are great, keep in mind that there are plenty of other schools that may fit your profile better or may be more well known for the major that you're applying for.

However, time has passed me by, and the closest I can get to experience these things is to research them. For as long as I can remember, I have loved archaeology: the study of tracing humanity’s past through the relics they left behind (this comes off as if you don't trust the admissions counselor to know the meaning of archeology, I like the description though, so maybe incorporate it differently?). One of my most treasured possessions (and one of the strangest gifts to give to a child) is a 1977 edition of the book The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen (italicize) by Howard Carter and A.C. Mace, which my father gave me when I was about 8 years old a child. Even though the writing didn’t exactly lend itself to the eyes of an 8 year old, I was mesmerized by the pictures. They depicted almost everything that was found inside Tutankhamen’s tomb: from a couch made to depict Hathor (the goddess of love, happiness, music, and the heavens) to sistra made of gilt wood and bronze (instruments that are similar in sound to tambourines) This sentence with the semicolon and the paranthesis is just a little too much formating, and it breaks the flow of the essay. Though these pictures were solely for cataloging the objects found in the tomb with nothing artistic about them, they enthralled my little brain. Day after day, I found myself flipping through the pages of this book and wondering what 3,000 year-old air smelled like, what it was like to be in a space that had not been occupied since it was closed off to the world, and how fast the archaeologists’ hearts must have been pumping when they realized what they had stumbled upon. As I grew up, I became more curious about ancient Egyptian culture. I was enthralled by the utmost respect that this civilization treated their dead, and the wildly imaginative view of the afterlife that they had. This rabid curiosity grew and grew over the next few years, and I found myself gobbling up book after book on archaeological findings from civilizations around the world, hungrily prowling the aisles of the library for more information. I was hooked. Now, every day after I come home from school, I trawl the internet, looking for more stories to satisfy my curiosity. trawling, gobbling, etc -your verbs feel very off beat to me - would you use them in conversation? Though I’m only 18, I feel as though I’ve lived for millennia, sampling life and death in cultures across the globe, been a native in many countries, and have been best friends with countless people from the dawn of humanity to present day. There’s not a feeling like it.  I'm assuming you plan on majoring on archeology - you don't really want your common app essay to be about your major. I like the topic though, but maybe focus on the dream and wonder, instead of trying to show your interest in the field. Thats not the purpose of this essay. Connect back to the prompt"

Some of the schools I applied to had a requirement of 2 years, but with 3 years I wouldn't have to take FL in college, otherwise I'd have to take 2 years there.

Because the tech schools- be they LTC, NWTC or FVTC are actually going out and asking employers what they want as oppose to a lot of the 4 year schools who are against doing that because apparently, college is not about ""job skills."" It's about ""life skills"" and being a ""productive citizen"" while putting together an all-holy portfolio that a lot of employers refuse to look at with some threatening to throw out any applications that have them attached...   So yea... that's what I, as someone who's about to finish up is facing.

Secondly, most people who take a break from college don't come back and overall has more negative impacts than positive, I don't know why you would herald that advice around here.  Moving on...I find that most of the problems you face will not be posed to me. Firstly, the career I am persuing should allow me to pay off debt in <2 yrs, 1 if I'm smart about it. I suggest everyone else pick a career path that would allow them to do the same, but of course you will always have your history majors.  I have experienced college classes through a program at my hs and have found that it's important to play ""classroom politics"". In other words, be the one guy that professor likes and that OP is complaining about, especially when it comes to opinion based classes like English & history. Does your prof present extremely left political views? Then you know how to write your papers. You're there to get a high GPA on your resume so you can get that high paying job that can pay off your loans. Debate immigration laws with your prof after you graduate. For now, just get that A.  Network, network, network, and network some more. It's the most important thing you can do, hands down.   Join a lot of clubs, extra points if it's career related and resume worthy. It's also a great way to get social if you have trouble doing that (you could join a frat too).  College really shouldn't be the high point in your life, it should be the beginning of an upward trend. The things I've said are the product of having excellent mentors to talk to, I suggest you do the same!"
ApplyingToCollege,2ttttc,PlebDestroyer,2,Thu Jan 29 04:23:52 2015 UTC,"Hate to break it to you, but the smaller the college, the fewer the clubs- which makes things difficult. Secondly, the title ix problems deserve to be mentioned because I've seen way too many people fucked over by it... Title IX should honestly be something that is pounded into every freshman's head during their first semester so that they know the laws and know how to protect themselves.   As far as taking a break, I've seen way too many crash and burn- and if most don't come back, that's not the worst thing in the world. College isn't the only path to success in life.  And as far as networking- it's seriously overhyped and doesn't do much good especially if you're trying to amass the largest network that you can. It's better to have a handful of connections you are really close to than a few dozen people who you barely know.  And as for the professor deal- it's not their bias that is the problem especially in a smaller school. It's that some will fraternize with students and give them favors because they're friends- it's unethical, but it's a major problem with smaller campuses and I've seen it happen (albeit not as often) on larger campuses. Also, if you're having to kiss ass to get a decent grade, then it shows that there is an inherent flaw with the class. And hell, kissing ass doesn't necessarily guarantee an A. Posing a strong, well supported argument- albeit harder, can be just as successful and I have done this several times especially when it came to having to deal with the co-head of the English department at my school."

That wont count for college credit of course but maybe they'll see that I have some proficiency in that subject? IDK  Also got A's in English Composition I, Environmental Science, Sailing(lol) and the Micro and Macro economics course sequence (those economics classes were 200 level courses for some reason, not sure if that matters)  Got a good letter of recommendation from my Calculus II professor who seemed to really enjoy having me in class and sometimes asked me to demonstrate solutions to problems on the board (he said he would mention that in his letter)  My Dean's report is fine, have never broken a rule or been disciplined in college.  I am currently taking these courses in the spring semester:  Calculus III  Calculus-based Physics I (my General Physics I wont transfer for engineering)  Inorganic Chemistry I  Elementary Engineering (intro to design and CAD and stuff)  I have applied to:  Manhattan College (my safety school, spoke with a transfer counselor there who told me I'd be accepted with their highest scholarship)  Rensselaer   USC  University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign   Ohio State  UT Austin   Penn State (this and Austin are my big reaches)  Boston University (applied for Mech eng here just to keep my options open. Have a sibling who went here for grad school but I dont know if that really matters to their admissions officers)     Any thoughts? I'm worried about my HS grades, my suspensions (I didn't really give them a generic ""this is all behind me"" statement on the Common App but my vastly improved track record in the past three years might make that clear?), and also the fact that I dont have the second semester of chemistry that is recommended by most schools.  One other weird little thing, I was a part time student in Fall 2014, but then immediately returned to a rigorous schedule for Spring 2015.  In my Additional Comments on the Common App, I said that I could take any other recommended prerequisite courses in the coming Summer at my community college."

It takes a lot of grit to push yourself through tough circumstances.  You should really look into something like communications - it's an excellent way to keep writing and thinking critically, while also working towards marketable employment in a ton of different fields. Yes, you might even get to work for something related to gaming - you know it's out there.  CC -> 4 year is a pretty decent path for easing yourself back into a classroom environment. It'd give you a good chance to catch up on your math skills, too. It's not worth overlooking.  Incidentally, I taught at Temple for a few years - I went to grad school there, too. I absolutely love the place; the mix of students is incredible. The Comms department is very strong, and you will absolutely have some teachers who really care about you there.  (and minor in creative writing or something! Seriously! have a little fun!)  I wish you the best of luck. And seriously, think about Temple. It might be a good place for you.

ApplyingToCollege,2tqskf,Creepthan_Frome,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:37:43 2015 UTC,I was looking at temple u the other day. I'm a junior graduating in 2016. What are the best/worst parts of it? Is it a highly selective school?
ApplyingToCollege,2tqskf,maroonrice,1 point,Mon Jan 26 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned, Temple has a very diverse student population, although they're largely from the northeast or Philadelphia region. But ethnically, racially, socio-economically, interest-wise, LGBT-wise, you'll find everyone. There's lots of first-generation college students sitting next to others who have had their whole family go through Temple. It's an inclusive environment that fulfills a whole lot for many different people.  It's not a highly selective school, with a 63% rate of acceptance (it's a large public university), but this really does contribute to the school's diversity. There's an Honors program for students with very high grades, and plenty of educational supports for students who need it. It's good for both populations to meet and work with each other.  Temple Basketball's great, and there are plenty of club and recreation things to get into. I was a fencer as an undergrad at JHU, and Temple was one of our toughest rivals - it's worth a watch if there's a meet going on.  That said, like many other large schools, Temple has a serious reliance-on-adjuncts problem. For a ton of your Gen-Eds, expect to be taught by adjuncts (that's what I did!). Overwhelmingly, adjuncts are highly qualified people who genuinely like to teach, and some of us (not me) even have Phds. But we're paid absolute dick for our work, and many students don't respect us. It may be challenging to foster close relationships with your professors, because classes aren't small, but if you reach out, it can be done.  It is worth noting that Temple's in an absolute shit neighborhood with a crime problem, and the locals are really, really not thrilled with the gentrification that's been going on in the area. Be aware of the tension between students and residents. But access to center city Philly is like five subway stops away, and that's pretty goddamn convenient."

You've heard correctly about the science section--when you start on the science section, just read the first question and then refer to the information they give you. Don't bother trying to read/skim over the information; it'll just confuse you. 9 times out of 10 the information is in the data table/graphs that they give you, not the passages.   And of course, don't cram the night before. Don't do anything that takes up a lot of brain power. You'll need it for the test.

ApplyingToCollege,2sym4c,MLB5252,2,Mon Jan 19 22:20:53 2015 UTC,"I might be the only person that jumped the amount of points you are hoping to improve.   I took the ACT in December of my sophomore year with no prep and got a 29. I knew the score was good, but I also knew that I could do better. In the year between my tests, I did a little prep, and received a 35 in December of my junior year.   It's important to understand what you truly believe your potential to be. I knew a 29 is great, but I also knew that for me it was about as low as I could've scored that day. A 35, of course, is great, and I knew I had maximized my potential, so I never tried to get a 36. It's important to understand what a 24 means to you. I believe standardized test scores are best represented by a range. Maybe a 24 was the absolute best you could have scored, or maybe it was the worst - but only you can answer that question.   Certainly, it is possible to improve 6 points, albeit very difficult. Test prep is essential. I recommend taking practice tests and really taking time to understand the questions you miss. Maybe it's also necessary to go back and relearn some of the math or English rules. My guidance counselor also told me that reading books improves a student's reading score, so maybe you could try that. I also tell people that my strategy for science (which many people say is the toughest) is to read the question first and then look for the answer in the graphs. Maybe also try taking the SAT; some students do better on it.   Good luck with test prep, test taking, and the college process in general! Let me know if you have anymore questions. :)"

ApplyingToCollege,2sym4c,fryderman,2,Tue Jan 20 01:20:53 2015 UTC,"Just going to copypasta something that I posted in an earlier thread on studying for the ACT, hopefully it will help somebody out.  College senior here, I highly recommend Barron's guide to getting a 36. While it is an overall good book for any ACT skill level, this book is incredibly helpful for students aiming in mid to high 30's, as it focuses primarily on reoccurring difficult questions in each section. The English and math sections in this book are INCREDIBLY useful. I would also recommend the big red ACT endorsed book for practice tests (it has around 5) this book is a great supplement to the barrons book. I found a studying habit that helped me was to allot a certain week to a certain subject (math,science,etc..) start the week by skimming the Barrons book in that subject, then taking each of the 5 tests in that section (usually 1 every night or other night), then grading each test, and going back to the Barrons book and going very in depth for the weeks section. Tips: do not write in any of the books, always write on a separate piece of paper so that you can go back and retake the test. Do not forget about the essay section, Big red book has some good exapmles of perfect scores Buy a year or two old version of Big red book, it does not change very much by year, and will be much cheaper. This strategy was very effective for me, and by doing this for 2 rotations (2 months, each section 2 times) i was able to raise my score from a 33 to a 35 Good Luck!"

ApplyingToCollege,2swwrr,sexyempiricus,3,Mon Jan 19 07:08:32 2015 UTC,"Harvard's a huge investment, but it'll get you a lot of places. I saw that you mentioned studying econ in another post; you really can't beat Harvard in that department (the prestige, at least).  Are you interested in consulting? Firms want Harvard students (among other Ivies' and pseudo-Ivies') and will pay thousands and thousands of dollars just to participate in Harvard's on-campus recruitment. Just for perspective, an average annual starting salary for consultants (and keep in mind that ~40% of Harvard seniors go through the recruiting process; it's that popular) is around ~65k + bonuses, so anywhere around $70-80k. That's average. I know plenty of recent grads making more.  Are you interested in finance, investment banking, etc.? The same argument follows. The starting salary tends to be at least six figures.  I'm biased, but there's a reason Harvard's yield rate is over 80%. So no, if I were in your position, I wouldn't turn down Harvard; however, as you mentioned earlier, it's ultimately your decision. :) While I realize your financial situation and think that you could certainly excel at other schools, given that you're impressive enough to be accepted to Harvard, I think you'd have to try a lot harder at those schools to get noticed by top employers that, as I mentioned earlier, specifically PAY Harvard to recruit their students (unless those schools are of equal caliber, namely Stanford + the Ivies, all colleges you'd probably have to pay a lot for); you'd be surprised at how much the Harvard name can help you.  Also, call the financial aid office! They'll tell you with more certainty whether you can get more financial aid or not."

ApplyingToCollege,2swwrr,qogofud,2,Tue Jan 20 06:07:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry for focusing so much on econ, lol. Another thing to keep in mind is that you may simply change your mind, as many freshmen do; I'm not saying that you in particular will, but unless you change to engineering or something, Harvard's a great school for really anything. I have many CS friends who land internships with Google, Dropbox, Facebook, etc.; my liberal arts friends (like History & Literature) say that Harvard's unique in that it's one of the few schools that has a very strong department and also provides ""security""—that is, they don't have to worry as much about majoring in something that won't make them any money, because at the end of the day, they'll have a Harvard degree. (I'd also like to note that consulting is not econ major-specific!)  On the other hand, if you're still interested in politics and law, your search for sought-after internships will probably be much easier, provided that you do well in your classes and are involved in extracurriculars.  If you take on $40k-60k of debt by the time you graduate, I think the bigger concern is the debt you'd incur by going to law/grad school. $40-60k is a drop in the bucket, in the long run. That's just my opinion! If you know any other current Harvard students, you should definitely reach out to them. :)  Edit: If you call the FAO, you should think about mentioning your financial aid package from Whitman. I don't think it's considered a school of similar caliber, but they might be willing to match or adjust your Harvard financial aid package accordingly. No guarantees though. :("

How good the essay is is completely dependent on how you write it and what you have to write about. I've had certain accomplishments or interesting aspects of my life other people suggested I write about for my essays, but I knew I couldn't make it as compelling as the one I did write (quite personal, and people thought it might be dangerous territory).   Both sound interesting, but we really couldn't tell you which is better until you actually write it. If you really tie in the Rubik's cube essay into your personal story and growth, it could be a brilliant essay. If it's just an essay about how proud you were because you won a competition, then it'd be a dull essay.  There's nothing in particular about either essay that screams it's the one you should write. Unless speed-solving is super uncommon (I didn't think it was?) and a huge part of your life, I think only you can decide which essay you should write.  Actually, write both.

Send your test scores/transcripts ASAP but they don't have to be sent/received by the deadline. Don't risk sending your apps in late because of transcripts. If a school is missing your scores they will contact you and if you feel the need, you can call the admissions office and explain any unusual circumstances and assure them that they're on the way.  That being said, be careful about submitting within 24 hours of the deadline. Be mindful of different time zones.

Your unweighted and weighted GPA will take a small hit, but if your school ranks at all, your rank will not be affected (or you'll go up in rank!) and that's also important to admissions officers to determine your relative performance at your school. :)"

ApplyingToCollege,2sda98,RoleModelFailure,1 point,Thu Jan 15 02:18:45 2015 UTC,"It all depends really.  If a school looks at how you performed compared to other students in your school then explaining the teachers were bad won't do much since they will see other grades.  If students got As in those classes with the same teacher then you are kinda out of luck.  It can never hurt though to try, if you have the academic record and this is out of the ordinary definitely explain what happened.  They may read it and take it into consideration."

This is an oversimplification, but let's say that your ""Final GPA"" is your 4 final grades averages together.  That would mean that you need to get a ~95 11th and 12 grade year to get an A average (90/A scale).  Honestly, even at an 85 you still have a pretty good chance of getting into some middle/high end schools.  Just try to do extremely well in your next 2 years of high school, and really try to kick-butt with your extracurriculars.  While grades are a big part, they are not everything, and a lot of extracurriculars can really make you stand out.  Also keep in mind, being an international student may help or hurt you with the application process.  I'm really not 100% sure, and it may vary depending on your university choice.

You can base your GPA/SAT/ACT on others who have been accepted, but there isn't really a guarantee that you'll get in or a guarantee that you won't get in.   Just try your ABSOLUTE best for the rest of your time in school.  Turn in everything on time, master all the material, sign up/start clubs, just do things to make you stand out.

ApplyingToCollege,2s63pt,qogofud,1 point,Wed Jan 14 21:59:49 2015 UTC,"Your extracurriculars are solid! Your UW GPA isn't the best, but if your school ranks at all, that's more indicative to admissions officers of how you did relative to your classmates; basically, maybe a 3.8 UW at your school is really good, and I just don't know that. :P Also, if you go to a top private school, it's a little tougher in the admissions process because you'll essentially be competing against your competitive classmates. However, I still think your activities and internships are very strong, so you're probably definitely competitive on that front.  Unfortunately, it's hard to determine if admittance is realistic or not for top-tier schools without an SAT score. The fact that your sister went to Princeton is not very significant, although it will help you informally (since your sister successfully went through the process and was admitted!) and perhaps help you be recognized among Princeton applicants, especially if the same admissions officer is reviewing your school's applicants.  Hope that helps a little!"
ApplyingToCollege,2s63pt,RudeSandstorm,1 point,Wed Jan 14 23:33:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice!  My school does not calculate GPA's, rather, it sends a full transcript because something about not believing in competitiveness. So, the figure is hand-calculated in the harshest way possible. I have 8 A's, 6 A-'s, and 1 B+ (from freshman year) with an upward trend. I wasn't really sure if the A- count against me - sources varied.   Also, if you go to a top private school, it's a little tougher in the admissions process because you'll essentially be competing against your competitive classmates.   I'm under the impression that schools take into account the rigor of the school - we send them a ""school report"" that essentially lets them know it is much harder to get A's here.   Yeah, I understand about the SAT. I wasn't under the impression that the SAT counted for a ton at top tier schools if it is above 2200.    The fact that your sister went to Princeton is not very significant   Darn, I thought legacy counted a tiny bit :/"
ApplyingToCollege,2s63pt,qogofud,1 point,Thu Jan 15 01:16:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's a strange way of calculating GPA, lol. Well, either way, it seems like you're doing well and upward trend is always good!  Schools do take into account the rigor of the school, but if students at your school perform well, you have to perform well/better to stand out at elite school admissions. For example, let's say your school's average SAT score is 2000 and an underperforming high school's average SAT score is 1400. If you score a 2000, you're not doing spectacularly compared to your classmates. On the other hand, if you went to that other high school and scored a 2000, you're doing incredibly well. Same logic goes for your grades!  While there's no official SAT cutoff for top tier schools, if you can score above 2200, then I think you're in great shape. :)  As for legacies, it matters the most when your parents/grandparents went there and donated a significant amount of money. Otherwise, when admissions officers see that you listed a sibling at their school, I'm sure they'll take a closer look at you, but it definitely won't be the reason why you are rejected/accepted. The topic of legacies can be unclear and touchy, but that's just my opinion!"

They may be waiting to see if the applicant continues to keep up grades/improve grades, or maybe if they do anything else of note in the time, or maybe just to see what other applicants are offering. Colleges receive an insane amount of applications, and they don't have time to tell individuals why they might be deferred. The application process is a difficult and scary time, but applicants have to realize that they're not that special. Asking for a decision now is acting selfish and entitled. If you want a decision now, assume you're rejected."

Some of the content I would have loved to see when I was trying to find channels like this would be some really honest experiences about the process of picking your major and school, on a personal level, and maybe tying that to what you've seen and heard from other students. It would definitely be helpful and awesome to see real-life examples of people in different engineering majors, because it's very hard to imagine what the descriptions of each major translate to in the real world and it's hard to find resources for that. I also love the idea of asking current students what struggles and issues they see, and I would maybe add what things are great about engineering for them. I think this would be an awesome way to show some diversity among the kind of people who can be/are engineers because there's a very restricted stereotype out there in my opinion.

Not every student will have that, but for every 2000 they accept, they'll accept a couple 2400s to balance it out. Priority for low SATs go to atheletes/legacy first, then other students who might be weak in some way but offer some kind of hook - great essay, award, circumstance (for some school, being able to say we have students from all 50 states might even bag you an acceptance).

I generally advise students to take the ACT, as it's fact-oriented, versus the SAT, which has more ""tricks"" to it.  UC schools are noted for their connections with California community colleges, and tend to accept a ton of students from them, so CC is actually a very wise idea, and will save you some money.   Your training and military background will only help you! Schools fall over each other to gain students with rich backgrounds and skill sets, as they're the kind of students who push themselves harder, and with a greater degree of ambition and direction.  UCLA, UCSB, and UCSD are options you should look into if you're interested in staying in southern California.

Just click the (PDF) next to each year and scroll down to the end. Don't mind the gap between years because they reuse the same tests in between.

ApplyingToCollege,2rgx1h,Ask_Admissions,2,Tue Jan 6 04:38:22 2015 UTC,"College senior here, I highly recommend Barron's guide to getting a 36. While it is an overall good book for any ACT skill level, this book is incredibly helpful for students aiming in mid to high 30's, as it focuses primarily on reoccurring difficult questions in each section. The English and math sections in this book are INCREDIBLY useful. I would also recommend the big red ACT endorsed book for practice tests (it has around 5) this book is a great supplement to the barrons book. I found a studying habit that helped me was to allot a certain week to a certain subject (math,science,etc..) start the week by skimming the Barrons book in that subject, then taking each of the 5 tests in that section (usually 1 every night or other night), then grading each test, and going back to the Barrons book and going very in depth for the weeks section. Tips: do not write in any of the books, always write on a separate piece of paper so that you can go back and retake the test. Do not forget about the essay section, Big red book has some good exapmles of perfect scores Buy a year or two old version of Big red book, it does not change very much by year, and will be much cheaper. This strategy was very effective for me, and by doing this for 2 rotations (2 months, each section 2 times) i was able to raise my score from a 33 to a 35 Good Luck!"

ApplyingToCollege,2qs5sy,RoleModelFailure,2,Tue Dec 30 06:06:42 2014 UTC,"You have a year - and there is a lot to do in a year! I'm assuming based off of your classes, you're a smart kid. The thing about the standardized testing is that it trips up a lot of smart kids. Being smart doesn't mean you test well, so don't think low scores mean you are stupid. For both tests, practice is key. The SAT ( i don't have as much experience with the ACT) repeats questions like crazy. You do enough practice, you'll be so familiar that the questions won't trip you up. Honestly, time management tends to be a big problem, and practice will help! The great thing about the PSAT is that they give a breakdown by type of question. Examine that carefully. Did you mess up in math across the board, or only in certain question? Don't waste time studying stuff you know - study the stuff you get wrong. Yeah you'll feel like crap if your mock score sucks but thats what's going to help you. Get some prep books, the library is a good source and come January a ton of seniors will have some that are unneeded - there is no excuse for not getting a good prep book.  Basically, if you put in effort, there is no reason why you can't get your score up. Don't be discouraged!"
ApplyingToCollege,2qs5sy,Scesaf01,2,Tue Dec 30 06:20:31 2014 UTC,"To repeat what everybody else has said, no one cares about the PSAT. My advice with the SAT prep is to get that blue prep book written by collegeboard itself. It has TEN full length practice tests. By the time the test rolls around, you should be able to live and breathe the flavor of the SAT, which is kinda what you need for a 3 hour test. Knowing the tricks up the collegeboard's sleeve is 90% of the test."
ApplyingToCollege,2qs5sy,pitchwhite,2,Tue Dec 30 07:39:22 2014 UTC,"What year are you?  Talk to friends that did well, talk to teachers for the areas that you did poorly in.  Practice practice practice.  Maybe take a prep class."
ApplyingToCollege,2qs5sy,kalotypography,2,Tue Dec 30 07:51:03 2014 UTC,"If I were you I would use the Barron's ACT prep book to learn the material and then use any book or online material to take many practice tests until you feel more prepared to retake the SAT. A 24 ACT isn't awful, especially if you have a decent GPA. If you are really confused on a specific topic on the ACT, ask your teacher and they will more than likely be glad to help you."

There are hundreds of threads on this, especially if you check collegeconfidential.com.  You could take an expensive prep class if you wanted, or see if any students at your school offer free tutoring, but basically, there's one way to raise you scores that everyone goes through: prep books and practice tests. For the ACT, the Official Red book is most recommended."

I'm looking at all of HYPSM, Caltech, Brown, Duke, Rice, Dartmouth, Cornell, CMU, and the UC system.  Stats:  GPA: 4.57/4.8 (W), 3.98/4.0 (UW)  SAT: 2390 superscore (800W, 790M, 800CR) || Subject: Physics (800), Chem (800), Math II (800)  AP's: 10 5's (Chem, Spanish Lang, Physics B, World History, Calc BC, Stats, US History, Physics C: M + E/M, Comp Sci)   Current Load: AP Psych, AP Econ (Micro), AP English Lit, Honors Advanced Math (seminar-style class), Honors Advanced CS: Numerical Methods, Astronomy  Next Semester: AP Econ (Macro), AP Lit, AP Psych, Linear Algebra, Modern Physics, Analytical Chemistry  Desired Major: Something in physics (biophysics or astrophysics idk)  EC's:  Clubs: NHS, Spanish NHS, Journalism (wrote a few pieces for my local newspaper, numerous awards), HOSA Future Health Professionals (Co-founder + Co-president), Amnesty International (Secretary), Math Club (numerous awards), Peer Tutoring (TA for AP Calc BC), Technology Student Association (Captain, numerous awards)  Sports: Track + Field (Sprinter [200 m] + Long Jump -- but i'm not very good :P),  Research: SIMR Summer Program (Cardiology -- presented at the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute), Local Community College (Astronomy), a couple of side projects at school  Volunteer Work: Extensive religious volunteering, Assisting local nonprofits that organize math contests to help the underprivileged in India  I talked about my religious beliefs and how I unify them with science in my Common App essay but not sure if that might be received well by the colleges.

ApplyingToCollege,2qpqbr,qogofud,3,Mon Dec 29 17:00:47 2014 UTC,"For the top schools, you've got as much chance as getting in as the next highly competitive applicant; that's not a bad thing as you seem very qualified, so at this point, it comes down to your Common App essays, which are the only thing that will differentiate you.  Depending on how strong your overall app is (so basically your essays), I'd say you're in at all the UCs, Duke, Dartmouth, Rice, CMU, and Cornell. HYPS is a crapshoot once you're as competitive as you can reasonably be without being completely above and beyond. Can't speak much for MIT and Caltech, sorry!  Does your school send a lot of students to top schools and Ivies? This may help or hurt you; if you're similar to some of the students who have gotten accepted in the past, then that's probably good. Admissions officers will compare you within the local context, so if a lot of your classmates are extremely competitive as well, it may be more difficult to get in. Also, if you're an Asian applicant from CA, it can be pretty difficult... Speaking from personal experience.  At this point, your apps are probably submitted, so relax! You'll definitely get plenty of acceptances. :)"

I will greatly appreciate it if you could spend a moment to go through my stats.  Unweighted GPA: Unknown, school doesn't give out GPA (Canadian school), but I am a full diploma IB student with an average of 5 out of 7 in all of my classes. Actual grade is 33/45 on the IB Scale. Had an average of around 88% in grades 8-10. IB transcript stated that a 33/45 is around a 93%.   SAT score: Nov 2013 Total: 1790 CR 570, Math 720, W 500, Essay: 06/12  ACT score: Oct 2014 Composite: 32, English 28, Reading 35, Science 34, Math 31, Writing 10/12, Combined Eng/writing 28.  SAT II scores: SAT Math II 730/760 (First and second try), SAT Physics 730/760 (First and second try as well, it's a coincidence)  Senior year courses:   IB English SL IB Mathematics SL IB Chemistry HL IB Geography HL IB Biology HL   No APs, the courses are all yearlong.  Applied majors: Chemistry, Biology (physiology), and Biochemistry depending on the university, my main aspiration is in chemistry, but I'm fine with any other listed ones.  Extracurriculars: Canadian student, so I'm not overly familiar with the American forms and terminologies of extracurriculars. I'll list what I've listed on my college applications.   Built a farnsworth nuclear fusion reactor with a friend as a summer project, entered the regional science fair and won an ""Outstanding engineering project"" award in my age (senior) category. Sugarcoated this as the ""project leader/co-founder"" when entering my ECs. Co-created (with my brother) two iPhone/android applications and published it on the iPhone appstore and the Google Play store. Founder/leader of the school's App/programming club. Club has been running since September after the launch of our second app (which explains the delay). Violin learner for >7 years, passed the music theory and level 8 violin examinations Golf player (no sports teams or varsity, recreational) for >5 years Symphony orchestra second/third violinist Did a research project at a university and wrote an essay on it in chemistry for my IB Diploma program, had a great experience and wrote about it in my essays. >100 volunteer hours. Volunteered with my city with over 50 documented hours within, initiated several citywide events with them and is currently on the steering committee of a major city event.    There are other things that I have withheld because they are central to my identity and I wish to remain anonymous, I can provide them upon request but I'd like to keep them off of this post. That being said, this information should be enough for rough estimations.   Essays:   Generic essay, failure, event central to identity, etc.    Wrote about the process of building that nuclear reactor: how initially I thought it was simple to build one because I understood the concepts and theories behind one, but only to learn that it was way more complicated. We ended up succeeding but had to go through an extra 8 months learning the additional theories behind the reactor (power supply, vacuum chamber, etc). Wrote about how introspection (to avoid arrogance) was important to me   Cultural/diversity essay   Wrote about my old background being extremely homogenous and thinking that everyone had the same opinions, which harbored a black and white perspective on opinions: there is a ""correct"" one and a ""wrong"" one. Then I moved to a more culturally diverse area and during an in-class discussion, realized that opinions that differ can both be ""right"", which created tolerance to different ideas and realizing that other perspectives can also synthesize opinions that are ""correct"" as opposed to my traditional thought that there must be a right and wrong opinion.   Why us? ""Groveling"" essay   I only had to write this for UW Madison, so I wrote about my researching experience in the summer because I've always been interested in chemistry. I learned that I loved doing research and wrote about how research oriented UW Madison is (it is!). Included a few stats about the dept. and uni as proof that I have done some research, I integrated them into the essay. My mom also went to UW Milwaukee so I wrote about how that exposed me to UW Madison.    Recommendations: 3 teachers, two of which I frequently talk to about thinking processes and stuff, so they should know me pretty well, I also asked my chemistry teacher because he was directly involved in my research project over the summer. 1 principal (there's only one in our school), she wrote a letter and I loved it.   American colleges I've applied to: Based on order of concern/importance/desire. Canadian universities, though significantly cheaper, aren't exactly on my radar or concern for some reason. :/ I have to pay out of state/International fees for american colleges.    University of Wisconsin - Madison and University of Washington University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign University of California - Santa Barbara   Reach (impossible reaches):   University of Michigan - Ann Arbor University of California - Los Angeles University of California - Berkeley Northwestern University University of Chicago University of Pennsylvania   Miscellaneous:  3rd gen college student, high household income. One of the highest ranked public high school in my region. (these will probably all hurt my chances heh)  I have applied to all of those universities except from U chig and U penn, both of which will be submitted in the next few days (due in 3 days!!) but I'm not caring about it as much as I should because I'm pretty sure I'm not getting in anyways. They're all Commonapp universities so applying them should be easier. Any thought would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!"

ApplyingToCollege,2qnr1t,ayybubz,4,Sun Dec 28 23:48:23 2014 UTC,"Get an idea of what you want to study so you don't look at schools that don't offer it. CollegeBoard has some good info about matching majors and careers. You don't need to be absolutely certain at this point but mentally take note of what your real interests are. If you want to go further, start researching specific majors and career fields for day-to-day life and job outlooks.  Select geographic areas of interest. Do you want to be close to home? Far away? Do you prefer warmer climates or colder? This will narrow down the search area. Public or private? There are often big differences between state universities and private schools. Things like culture, cost, lifestyle expectations, size, programs of study, and more will vary. Generally speaking, public/state universities or colleges are cheaper, offer a lot of programs, and have a varied culture. Getting a full ride is not impossible. Private schools are more costly, may have fewer programs or specialize, tend to be smaller and have a specific culture. Getting a full ride is hard if not impossible.  Big, mid-sized, or small? The large state universities you hear about often will have somewhere around 30-40K students, average class sizes in the hundreds, lots of programs and resources, and a big campus. A mid-sized school is roughly 5-10K students, average class sizes around the size of your high school, decent amount of programs and resources, and usually has a smaller campus. Small schools are less than 5K, some may even be in the hundreds, class sizes around the size of a high school class or smaller, limited programs and resources, small campus.   Urban, college town, suburban, or rural? Urban campuses are going to be in a city, so though the entertainment is great, campus safety varies but job prospects after graduation may be better. College towns usually have a good level of entertainment and safety but staying in the area after graduation may or may not be feasible. Suburban campuses tend to have less active student life but lower costs of living. Rural campuses can be small or big, but don't count on entertainment outside campus or being able to stay in the area post graduation.    Those are some general characteristics to think about and narrow down schools. If you can make a definite choice in each category, you're halfway there!

There are schools that are known for being generous with aid (merit & need-based) that are good to focus on if that is a consideration. ayybubz answer is an excellent place to start; I find we know some general truths about ourselves in terms of big school vs. small, how important prestige is to us, etc. and we can go from there.  Some additional things to consider on a micro level once you figure out the macro: do you want to go to a party school? Or a reputed haven for nerds? Are there specific on-campus activities you want to do and do schools have them? (ie: student newspaper, radio station, certain sports teams/student groups) Do you want to study abroad and what kinds of options are available? And when you are looking at school websites, look at the majors you're interested in and look at the courses you'd be taking, at the professors--do they reflect your interests/interest you? Are there decent career networking opportunities? If you're into the sciences, what are the research opportunities? If diversity matters to you, is the faculty diverse? Or is it a bunch of old white dudes?   More specifically, your stats can dictate where it is wise to look, and you'll want to look at a range of schools so you have reaches, matches and safeties. Forums like this--I also recommend College Confidential--are a good place to start. Post your stats/what you want to study and people are generally really helpful in providing suggestions.

City, rural, coastal, mountains, etc.  What do you want to study?  Science, math, engineering, etc.  Find schools that have the program you want to study and a program that you may fall back in to.  Why do you want to study there?  Ask yourself why you want to study at those schools.  Would you be happy living in that town?  Is that college the right fit for you?  Does the mission of the college fit what you want? etc.  And lastly look at the how.  How do they teach their students.  Some schools put more focus on internships and work instead of the classroom.  Is that something you want?  Or would you rather spend the majority of your program in class learning and then later applying it to your field?  Make lists of places you want to study at right now and start narrowing it down to places that fit what you want.  What do you want out of college?  The biggest question is not what a school offers but what it is that you want.  Figure out what you want and then find the schools that fit your criteria.

ApplyingToCollege,2qm058,LegendaryGinger,2,Mon Dec 29 06:32:19 2014 UTC,"It's a fantastic essay and you seem like an interesting individual.  First off say United Arab Emirates instead of UAE in the first mention as /u/kalotypography said earlier. It's easy to understand what you mean coming from context, but since it is in the very beginning it threw me off. I'd change it just to be safe.   If you haven't all ready, I'd recommend taking it to one or more of your English teachers to go over it with you and help tune it up. I'm not at all a talented writer, so take my advice sparingly, but sometimes I think you are a tad verbose. For example in the line ""The previous world that I had been living in seemed so distant and tiny"", ""that I had been living in"" sounds clunky and could be shortened.   Also there are probably better words or a better word for ""tiny and distant"".  In the second paragraph you talk about your school's religious tolerance and the diversity of religions around you, but you never state your religion. This makes me think that religion is not a defining characteristic in your life, but the fact that you religion appears in your essay that is supposed to define you kind of suggests otherwise. This is not a criticism, just an observation.  Bonus points for expatriate, awesome word.  Just go over it as many times as you can, because there will always be something that you can improve."

That you were in an abusive home? I really could not see how that connected to the rest of your essay  You committed the fatal error: never ever ever just make your essay a list of your accomplishments. This is YOUR STORY, not your résumé. Ask yourself how this event/your home life shaped you as a person, not what they ""inspired"" you to do. Convey what your personality is like--the cardinal rule is to show, not tell.   The first two questions were very awkward. Starting an essay with a question is very cliche. Frame the situation in a attention-grabbing. State it as a fact.  ""Foolish act of gallantry?"" What? If you wouldn't say that in person, don't say it in an essay. You have a lot of complicated wording that I really didn't understand upon first reading. Write colloquially (sp?), in a manner that you would talk. This is your chance to show your voice.  There are a few cliches present as well, things like ""my mind ran a million miles per hour."" Get rid of those."

Remember what has been said and make comments about them at the end.  I had a job interview that ended in a 30 minute conversation about cooking and food because I remember hearing one of the people talked about cooking breakfast.  We talked for a long time about recipes, why we love cooking, etc.  I also talked to a guy about tailors and buying suits because he mentioned halfway through that the shoulders of his suit were bothering him.  Even if it is something you don't know about you can still talk about it.  Don't know about cooking?  Ask them.  Don't know anything about how a suit fits ask them where they get theirs tailored or where they buy them from.  Don't know about knitting (or anything really) ask about it.  It does not seem like much from the outside but it makes you look great.  You seem like the kind of person that can hold a conversation, somebody that they can talk to and that they would want around.  I had a Spanish class online over the summer and we had weekly skype sessions with our professor.  We had to talk for 30-60 minutes and it was the majority of our grade.  I always asked my professor to show me where she was since the first time she was on some back balcony in Spain.  I saw where she was and asked her, I wanted to see where she was, I wanted to see what she saw and then we talked about it.  We talked about travelling and where we wanted to visit.

We'll see how it goes, haha!)  So have you applied elsewhere, and gotten a better monetary package? If so, call up Temple's Admissions. Tell them you go more money and that Temple is your first choice and you really want to go there- and you need the money, and ask for a reevaluation.  You may have to fax over your other admission letter with the money amount on it, so just be ready for that. But a lot of people don't realize that you can negotiate money given.   If you haven't gotten any other acceptances yet, I would wait a bit and see. And if they don't give you much more, you can still call Temple and say they're your first choice (even if that's not true), and you can get more money. Though I'm not sure how much it'll be.

It is also most likely one of the cheapest relative to the other schools you listed.  Also make sure the schools you're applying to have engineering programs because I know right off the bat that U of Chicago doesn't have an engineering school, they only do molecular engineering.

My friend has barely a 4.0 weighted due to transferring from an international school, and she got into MIT (granted, she's a female URM, so she's got that going for her).

Tell a story. Be honest. It's ok that you didn't give a fuck - most people don't have many fucks to give at different points in their lives. Running out of fucks to give is pretty standard.   So admit that, but then show that you got some traction. Presumably there's some reason, throw that in there.   Tell them about the internship. the Honor society. investment club. and bitcoin. things you're passionate about.   As a rule, follow your interests and passions. And be confident in you, you are picking a college as much as they are picking you. If there are schools, professors, etc.. that you're really interested in. I'd make an effort to reach out. To visit. to contact professors. students running clubs. If you really are excited about something, don't be afraid to email people directly. Ask questions, ""Are you going to offer a course on cryptocurrencies?"" ... whatever.   That approach is a win bcs it (a) helps you get a better understanding if it's a school you really want to go to and (b) you gain allies and have a story to tell, something that can set you apart when they're looking at 5,000 applications.  I'd also consider Harvey Mudd. And Occidental College (that's where I went, you could potentially do the 3/2 program w/ CalTech). And California is nice :)  Finally, if you're a coder and passionate about bitcoin, definitely reach out to some bitcoin companies (including blockchain.info) about an internship.

ApplyingToCollege,2prbgy,xo_hb,1 point,Fri Dec 19 14:07:59 2014 UTC,"It's great that you've showed consistent upward trajectory and I do think admissions officers definitely take that into account. However, the harsh truth is that because there are so many other qualified applicants applying, especially to your top reach schools (Harvard, Yale, MIT, UChicago, and UPenn), your GPA will hurt you; it's helpful that your test scores are good (if you do get that 34!), so I encourage you to apply to those schools, because you never know, but make sure you have a lot of match and safety schools in mind as well. On the other hand, I know that the process of application reviewing for the top schools goes through a lot of levels (local --> regional --> larger regional --> state --> etc.) before actually reaching a university's admissions office, and I'd reckon that your rank/GPA is certainly not low enough for your application to immediately get dismissed. Again, you never know, so just apply :)  Basically, your extracurriculars and test scores are definitely competitive (and your improving grades will certainly be in your favor), but your GPA might hurt your application. I can't really speak as knowledgeably for CMU, JHU, and those other schools but, of course, please apply!

ApplyingToCollege,2pr56s,ayybubz,1 point,Sat Dec 20 01:22:19 2014 UTC,Who told you this? I've never heard of credits not transferring just because a school uses a different calender system. What I've heard is that 2/3 of the credits are transferred so if you have 3 credits from a quarter system then it counts as 2 credits in a semester system.
ApplyingToCollege,2pnrl1,shrinkwrappedzebra,1 point,Thu Dec 18 06:20:53 2014 UTC,"At most institutions, having less than 60 credits means you need standardized test scores. Consider staying at the CC until you get there if you don't want to test. Good news is - at this point your high school grades won't mean much at all.  Based on your GPA, you'll probably get in at most if not all schools you apply to if you meet criteria in point 1. I don't even know if there is a such thing as a ""reach"" school for you.    Financial aid tends to be sketchier for transfer students. Most merit scholarships are reserved for freshman. Before applying anywhere, contact their financial aid office and see what offers they have for transfers...maybe throw out your GPA casually in conversation :) Some schools are interested in extracurricular activities, some aren't.

He may have had a 10% chance of getting in and you an 80% chance but if the wrong person reads your application and the right one reads his, then you see a result like this.  I don't think the disparity was that high, however; while standardized tests are important, most schools place more weight on GPA than on SATs/ACTs, the line of thought being that your performance over a long period of time (indicated by GPA) is a better representation of your ability than a single test score (due to some peoples' particular strength/weakness in a standardized test setting).  This does unfortunately sometimes lead to gaming of the system by sometimes rewarding those who took easier courses while hurting those who took harder courses.  Unfortunately your GPA is going to hamper you in this process.  However I think all of those schools are within range, with Butler and Miami being the highest reaches."
ApplyingToCollege,2pd3ge,BigEth,1 point,Wed Dec 17 13:40:06 2014 UTC,Thank you. This makes a ton of sense. The thing is at my school there are these classes that we call easy APs because they are just that. They give students easy A's with the AP weighting. I did not take any of these classes and my GPA did suffer because of this and also because I took the hardest AP class my school has to offer (AP chemistry) my GPA also took a small hit. I chose the route to be more prepared for when I go to college instead of the GPA padding route.

If these are the only schools/programs you are applying to, you need to add some targets/a safety or else you run a very real risk of not having somewhere to go next fall.  Going C/BE shouldn't affect your chances at JHU, which are rather good.  However, only applying to Duke and some BS/MD programs is quite risky.  Furthermore, going to be a bit blunt here, but should someone with a 2310 really be going to PSU/Jefferson?  It's up to you to decide if the security of guaranteed admittance to med school is worth it, but you never know if you may decide to ditch the premed track and thus should only ever go to a school that suits you without med school in mind.  Also, scoring as high as you did on the SAT typically correlates with getting an astronomically high MCAT score and being a competitive applicant at much better med schools than Jeff.    Consider Carnegie Mellon, Pitt, Michigan, UT Austin, Rice, Rochester, Emory, Maryland, Wisconsin, Ohio State, Bucknell and Harvey Mudd if you want some less to slightly less competitive engineering schools that are 1) still extremely/very good and 2) will still get you into the best med schools.

Additional Information (paraphrased from my Common App):  -Mock Trial team - defense attorney  -Junior year science fair project. Researched circadian rhythms in D. melanogaster at Neurobiology dept. in Umass Medical School  -Junior year engineering project - created tablet holder for students with visual impairment. Our group has a patent pending number.  -Volunteered for 20 hours over summer at the Massachusetts Audubon Society; I was in charge of clearing and building a new nature trail  -Young Neighbors In Action - 1 week service trip. Volunteered at a school in a disadvantaged neighborhood, assisting teaching 1st and 2nd graders.  -Participate at the WPI Toastmasters Club  -I teach a weekend class under Jago World, Inc. called ""Young Voices Gavel Club,"" a sort of weekend toastmasters club for elementary schoolers.  -Senior project: making a cooking blog.  -Senior year research: in the Molecular Medicine Department of UMass Medical School, studying treatments for the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.  -Employment: 2 week STEM-based summer camp for middle school kids  College Essays:  Obviously this will vary for each college. My Common App essay was about my service trip with Habitat for Humanity; I was previously unsympathetic to the plight of poor people until I actually met them and worked with them. Then it changed my outlook and made me more willing to help others.  I know this seems like a lot, but honestly, a lot of the points that I listed separately were mentioned together in the Common App. Thanks in advance for whatever advice I get."

ApplyingToCollege,2pd3ge,kalotypography,1 point,Tue Dec 16 05:26:04 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's one point where I feel a bit weak. I tried to compensate in the other essays but the Common App essay is, imo, one of the places where I could have done better.  But you never know. For all I know, the way I told it might have made it alright. My advisor told me how to emphasize certain aspects that would make it less cliche. No idea if they worked, but I guess that part's more or less over now."

That being said, it's possible that they'll all reject or waitlist you.   Anecdote: There's an Indian male at my school who had close to the same stats as you (some type of Intel sci fair winner, really good at Science Olympiad and MUN, NMSQT semifinalist, National AP Scholar, one of the highest GPAs in the school, stellar test scores, research work, charismatic) who got deferred from MIT as a potential engineering major. A lot of people have said that he deserved to get in, but three other students with less perfect achievements got in instead."
ApplyingToCollege,2pd3ge,joetheschmoe4000,0,Thu Dec 18 21:52:46 2014 UTC,"Incredibly strong application.  You can figure out an approximation of your GPA by simply calculating an average: each A is worth 4, and each B is worth 3 (the colleges will do this so it might be worth your while to do it as well).  Even for an Ivy applicant, you are at the absolute upper echelon with a 35/2380.  I have mixed feelings about the accelerated med programs.  Usually they stick you with either an undergrad school (BU) or a med school (Brown) that are a bit under what someone with your academic ability should be looking at.  Rice/Northwestern are the best BS/MD options in my opinion.  I think you've got a shot at landing interviews for all of the BS/MD programs you applied to, and from there acceptance will be contingent on how mature your decision to go into medicine comes across.  In at Tufts, UConn, UMass, Holy Cross, UNC, WPI and UVA.  Strong chance at JHU.  Columbia, Harvard and Yale are within the realm of possibility; you will need strong recommendations and essays to outweigh your ECs, which lean towards unbalanced/short-term."

I tried to make my Harvard, Yale, and Rice essays as strong as possible, so they show a decent amount of my personality. As for the Med Program essays, the only concern I have is that the emphasis I put on my interest in medicine might overshadow my ""voice."" And as for BU, I've heard that the Combined Med students are usually the only ones left surviving the bio program at the end of 4 years (not my top choice, but it's worth a shot). Thanks again for the help."

ApplyingToCollege,2pbt35,setthehook,1 point,Mon Dec 15 04:16:45 2014 UTC,"While it varies from college to college, senior grades are usually pretty important. Given your record, though, I doubt it will have much if any affect to your college chances. It would likely only have an impact if your senior grades were significantly better or worse than your trend so far.  I'd say hardly to no effect."
ApplyingToCollege,2pbt35,pitchwhite,1 point,Mon Dec 15 04:54:47 2014 UTC,Thank you. That will make me stress a bit less.
ApplyingToCollege,2pbt35,porkloins,1 point,Mon Dec 15 06:02:16 2014 UTC,"Grades from the first half of senior year get sent to any place you applied RD, so generally you want those to be as high as possible.  4 As and 2Bs is fine - in fact in your case it might even help to let them know you're actually human.  Last half of senior year, as long as you get C's or higher, your grades don't matter to colleges."
