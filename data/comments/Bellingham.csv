It's an annoying 20min drive from town (longer if you get stuck behind some twat doing 25mph) and the property value out there is falling like a lead balloon.   Not a competitive rental market either, college students don't want to live all the way out there.   A friend of mine who works for Keller Williams says it's garnered the nickname 'Sunken Value'"
Bellingham,3e2rnb,JamUp,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:38 2015 UTC,Don't do it. I live there. It's always dark. There are very few conveniences. There are houses going up for sale all over the place.  Just a thought: it seems like people invest in real estate because there is very little risk involved. Sudden valley would be an exception to that rule. You literally run the risk of huge depreciation over the next few years.
Bellingham,3e2rnb,PeterLikesRedditAlot,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:33:36 2015 UTC,"Bought a house in SV last year and for the most part we really like it. We found a place up on the mountain with a large clearing in front of it so we have quite a bit of light. I could imagine houses without this would be dark quite a bit of the day. Before building a place I would really recommend looking more into the real estate out here. There are some great houses on the market right now for a great price and if it's anything like it was last year for us, you'll be able to talk down the price quite a bit."
Bellingham,3e2rnb,boozecamp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:37 2015 UTC,"I grew up in SV.  Not a great place to invest at the moment.  If you are looking to just make money, then look elsewhere.  If you want a quiet place to live and much better value in a home (for the price, trust me as a builder) than in Bellingham proper, its a good spot.  I expect the home values will increase again long-term.  Disadvantages are commute, more rain than B'ham, less light (trees and hills are a problem).  In the 80s and early 90s the community facilities were in much better shape than they are today."

I love Sudden Valley! I never lived/owned anything there but my SOs parents just recently purchased a house on Lake Whatcom there, so I frequently visit and spend time there. Its so beautiful and peaceful. You have direct access to the water, and even though it is tucked away from places like Bellingham, I personally prefer it that way. I love the opportunity to escape the city and spend time in quiet area, away from most people. The neighbors in that area are snooty at times, but I haven't seen it as a real problem per se. Just from reading other comments here, I personally had no idea people felt this way about Sudden Valley, but like I said, I'm not privy to the real estate situation there. I just think its beautiful, tucked away and a lovely place to spend my time."

Bellingham,3cqhqy,Blueprint81,2,Fri Jul 10 02:31:52 2015 UTC,"I wondered the same... after i stopped squeeling with happiness.  The good news is, Mount Vernon and Burlington both already have a partnered groundwork for muni fiber. They started laying it back in the early 00's - currently, it is only accessible to business and government customers.  So basically, the backbone is there - they just need to start rolling it out and expanding it to residential.  I will be one of the first to sign up."
Bellingham,3cqhqy,DiabolicallyRandom,2,Fri Jul 10 03:10:33 2015 UTC,Bellingham also has a fiber network already established. Most of our municipal buildings are on gigabit fiber.
Bellingham,3cqhqy,BlckMrkt,2,Tue Jul 14 17:01:57 2015 UTC,"This was all the rage back in 99/00 as well. And then people started doing the math on recouping buildout costs, overhead to run and maintain the system, peering costs, IP availability, etc. It was a non-starter without deep pockets like Google has to fund it for a decade until it could sustain itself without being twice what Comcast charges.  Oh and you know that ARIN is running out of IPv4 address right? So I'm not even sure what the viability of a large block of routable upstream v4 addresses. Of course you could always make it a v6-default network with an upcharge for people that require a v4 address. I'm sure that won't cause any headache or gnashing of teeth at all.  In short, you can't just make promises at the political level and expect the technical and financial hurtles to bend to your will.  Oh, and for the people who seem to know exactly what internet ""should cost"" need to cite their credentials running an ISP."

Bellingham,3cry61,iamyourcheese,3,Fri Jul 10 07:55:15 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up from a hamster who lives in LA and works in the film industry: your rates are really high.  In LA, rates are based off of a 12-hour day.  Your rate for that would be $670.  I know plenty of people with far more experience and skill than you (not an insult, just the truth) who don't make anywhere near that.  Hell, I've been doing this for 6 years and I don't think I've ever made $45/hr.  For someone still in college and in Bellingham's market, you shouldn't be charging more than $150 flat for up to 12 hours.  If you have gear, then you can charge a little bit more depending on what you have, but for tax purposes that should be a separate amount from your day rate."
Bellingham,3cry61,filmnuts,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:28:12 2015 UTC,"Really? I was just told my rates are low for around here. What are yours, if you don't mind me asking?  Thanks for the notice though!"
Bellingham,3cry61,filmnuts,2,Fri Jul 10 23:05:04 2015 UTC,"I don't have set rates. My rate is whatever the production can pay. For 1st AC and gaffing jobs, I don't work for less than $200/12 unless it's a favor. Most of my jobs are in the $250-300 range. For DP jobs, I'm less concerned about the rate than I am on the quality of the project.  If it's something I can get behind, but they have no money, I'll shoot for as low as $126/12 (minimum wage in LA) and bring my gear for free.   I'd be curious to know what qualified this person to say your rates were low, because if $650/12 is a low rate for DP work in Washington, I'll pack up and move back to a B'ham in a heartbeat."

Only rule is you can't camp more than seven days in a month. Also,  leave no trace, camp in established sites, and no campfires while the burn ban's in effect. (It's DNR land.)  I've camped at Lily Lake two or three times, and Lizard Lake once. Parked on Chuckanut and had no problems. You'll want to bring a Discover Pass just to be safe.  (Also, this is a fun quick hike for the early season, but this time of year, there are much, much cooler places to go camping for free off Mt.

Though that satellite image shows little to no smoke in the area, it was super hazy when I was out there. The takeaway? Conditions change over time.   OP doesn't mention when his/her cousin is summitting Baker. If it's not for a few days still, this may have all blown over by then.. or lingered. Hard to say with fires continuing to pop up. Not to mention the difficulties thrown in by warm summer (and dry winter) conditions up on the mountain.. from what I've heard rarely-exposed rock is already exposed, snow bridges are insanely dangerous, crevasses galore up there."

Bellingham,3cbv5s,Fawkes_Lament,0,Tue Jul 7 02:33:21 2015 UTC,"Have you tried the towel trick? I used to use it with my old original model of the 360 when I got the red ring of death. Essentially you turn the Xbox on, wrap it up completely in a towel, leave it running for about an hour, then unwrap it and turn it off.   I always felt bad doing this because the Xbox would get really hot, but it seemed to work for a short time. Not sure if it works for the slim model (which is what I have now). Best of luck though"

The point of it is to reflow the solder on the circuit boards and does not work for everybody, it is a temporary fix anyway. It's like putting a band-aid on a hernia.  How old is it? Is it still under warranty? I know Microsoft extended the warranty because of red ring issues. I thought they addressed this issue though by the time the slim models came out?  There are different error codes associated with the rings, which of the 4 ring sections are lit up? Or is it just the center?"

Bellingham,3c9ea9,Tictacjo,3,Mon Jul 6 03:02:17 2015 UTC,"Molina administers your Medicaid coverage. Medicaid was expanded in the last few years to include most routine dental coverage (exams, fillings, extractions) for adults.   The issue isn't really your coverage, but not many dentists in town see adults with Medicaid. Interfaith Clinic does, but they have limited capacity for adults right now.  They will see you on a standby (basically waiting for a slot to open up in their schedule) basis for a limited exam and any treatment you need would also be on standby as well.   Interfaith also has a sliding fee scale in the event you may need to pay out of pocket."
Bellingham,3c9ea9,lovestobake,3,Mon Jul 6 05:15:23 2015 UTC,"Molina covers the medical side of Medicaid coverage. The dental side is administered directly by Apple Health. So when checking with dentists, you ask for someone who takes Apple Health.  There are very, very few dentists accepting Apple Health in town right now, but WAHA and Interfaith are working to expand options. WAHA does have a program that will let you get your single most emergent problem taken care of by a normal dentist who volunteers their time."

Bellingham,3c8h78,CelticTiger01,4,Sun Jul 5 21:56:29 2015 UTC,"I'll give you the no bullshit rundown from my perspective.  Been training here for 10ish years.  Sorry for anyone's panties getting twisted up.  Unbridled: Rob can beat you up and he wants you to know it.  It's super annoying.  Comes up all the time when I bump into ex students.  Actual content is ok(ish.)  He's definitely not trying to rip anyone off.  So I shouldn't talk too much shit, but man do I ever find training with him unpleasant.  I would say don't waste your time.  USMAA: Everything I've seen of this place has been total garbage.  The guy seems real nice though.  I've been in there twice.  If you want to barf, watch some of their hidden videos on the youtube page.  I'll just leave this here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbPwTl0kkCw  Shayne's: I personally think that all the kids stuff, and their brand of tma is crap crap crap, but he's also a very nice guy and he has some non traditional options.  They have actual MMA competitors with winning records training and teaching, they have the ONLY BJJ group in town.  I'd recommend it highly.  Bellingham Mixed Martial Arts: Proven competitors train and teach here.  This is the most serious kickboxing you can get in town.  I've never trained there but I know some people who do and they are legit.  I'd say that you will probably get a much more bro bro feel here if that's something you are concerned with.  I'd recommend it.  There is one legit Aikido school.  The guy on State street is a CRAZY person.  The group called Kulshan Aikido across from Bayou on the Bay is legit.  I think Aikido is pretty nimbly pimpbly overall, but these guys are some of the least weird ones I've met.  I've trained there and I'd recommend it as long as you don't drink the coolaid.  There is one Karate school in the area that I would consider ""not shit"" and that is the Shotokan Club at the Blaine Birch Bay Community Center.  The class times are reallly annoying though.  Like 4:30 on weekdays or something.  Strictly traditional karate, some kids, but they are disciplined.  I'd recommend it if you are interested in traditional martial arts and you don't mind weird time slots.  There is a Judo club at WWU that is authentic.  I'd recommend it if you like to work really hard but also like that old school feel.  There are also other judo clubs in the county.  Recommended if you live in the county.  That pretty much sums it up.  There are some kung fu schools but they are all classic tma mumbo jumbo with no substance. (imo)  Ps - belts serve one purpose and that is to keep your pants up."
Bellingham,3c8h78,DysonMachine,3,Sun Jul 5 23:54:28 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I train at Shayne Simpson's and can vouch for the BJJ. There are obviously better schools out there for competition but I always train when I travel and can verify that if you train hard at Shayne's you will hold your own wherever you go. There are lots of classes, varying instruction styles, and lots of skill levels for training partners. The constant kids stuff is definitely annoying and hurts the overall atmosphere IMO, but it keeps the lights on and there are a lot of training opportunities for the stuff you are into (BJJ/mma/Muay Thai). I've heard USMMA is good too (but no BJJ so I'm not interested) and the Bellingham MMA guys are tough fighters but not the most refined grapplers and only do no-gi.

Bellingham,3c1nws,PETC,2,Sat Jul 4 15:30:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I was reading that RCW yesterday while trying to pin down some of the stuff I've heard about legal vs. illegal fireworks, especially ones coming from the res. It was a little helpful but there was lots of legalese to wade through.  Interestingly, the law doesn't say anything about reservation fireworks specifically. I know that there are some that are federally legal but illegal in Washington state, so they can sell them on the res but you are not supposed to use them off the res. Of course, people do, but cops can't pull them over based on suspicion of illegal fireworks alone.  Anyway, from what I've read (but again, finding it hard to get concete information), those federally illegal fireworks carry a felony, though I'm not sure if it's just a felony to the seller or also to the buyer."
Bellingham,3c1nws,nettletart,0,Sat Jul 4 15:45:50 2015 UTC,No problem. Most of the laws regarding TYPES of fireworks that are illegal are on a city by city basis.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's a felony to possess commercial grade professional fireworks as an individual without a license. The ones that are labeled 1.3G vs what you get at the Res which are consumer 1.4G Fireworks. Aside from the back-door stuff they are the most potent you'll find even on the Reservations.
Bellingham,3c1nws,PETC,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:46:40 2015 UTC,"Cities can set their own limits but I think there are also state laws about it. While researching yesterday I dug up this fact sheet about legal vs. illegal fireworks in Washington State, put together by a fire department in Stanwood.  http://www.northcountyfireems.com/resources/2015_fireworks_stand_list_legal_and_illegal.pdf"
Bellingham,3c1nws,nettletart,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"Okay, so that's just according to the State. Cities can restrict fireworks even further like you said. Most have ""Safe and Sane"" laws which is essentially a bunch of shit fireworks that don't do anything. Yaaaay.  I understand the IEDs as illegal, but... come on Washington.... FIRECRACKERS? Also, why are firecrackers illegal, bottle rockets illegal, but mortars aren't? Mortars can fuck you up BAD and I've seen one explode inside of someone's house. Bad things happen.  For an example of why mortars are more dangerous than bottle rockets I would like to direct the audience's attention to MOTHER FUCKIN' BOOTLEG FIREWORKS!"
Bellingham,3c1nws,PETC,-1,Sat Jul 4 16:02:43 2015 UTC,"Just about all fireworks are inherently dangerous. I can't imagine trying to legally draw the line as to which ones are more bad than others. I'm so glad Bellingham has them banned. I just wish people would respect the ban.

Settle for two boxes and have them throw in as much smaller stuff (small bottle rockets and firecrackers) as you can get away with for free. It helps to have more than one person with you willing to do the same so that they feel like they're getting paid more money."

Bellingham,3bshua,Orale_Guay,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:57:14 2015 UTC,"South Hill doesn't have much in the way of a coordinated effort to identify the old (pre-1930's or so) houses - although there are a ton still there - but if you get the opportunity to drive, or, better yet, walk through the Eldridge/Columbia Neighborhood, there are plaques affixed to the front of most of the historical houses that identify the year built and the family who it was originally built for. It's really, really cool. They used to do a yearly walking tour, and several of the houses were open. I'm not sure if they do anymore, but if so, I'd highly recommend it.  Another resource is the Whatcom County Assessor's website - it's a lot more painstaking, but you can search by street name, and then browse through each of the houses on that street and look for the older ones. Say you want to search 14TH St - type that in, select Bellingham (it's glitchy, and there are a number of typos, so sometimes one option will bring up nothing, but selection the next option will be the one you were looking for) and then select ""Details"" on any particular property, and then ""Improvement/Building"" and it'll give you the date it was built.

As for an aquarium: plenty of people have already mentioned the Marine Life Center, which is really cool. Typically whenever I get a hankering to oggle fish I just go to the fish-store on Railroad. Of course this is for smaller fish, but the selection they have there is really quite amazing.

The job market in Bellingham isn't great, so even if you find a way to get around the border problem and the unpredictable commute doesn't bother you, definitely look into finding a job before you consider this.   If your relationship is serious enough that you're relocating for her, then you should probably consider just getting married and applying for residency. That way you can legally live and work in Canada."

They are not nearly as bad as people say and in fact the rental experience has been quite pleasant, they were quick to respond to my initial maintenance requests, have given lots of notice when coming onto the property or into the buildings, and they've made several improvements to the property in just the few months I've been there.  I've been happy with their payment options, I'm happy with my apartment, and I feel like they've been a very professional agency to rent through.    But when I was looking for the place I had to call them constantly if I wanted answers.  It seems like they are just terrible with handling calls and emails for potential renters and wouldn't call me about anything.  It was very frustrating because I was in a time crunch and needed a place.  Just call them every day, maybe twice a day until you get the answers you need.  I think that part of their problem is that they won't call a second or third applicant for a rental until the first person in line has either paid a deposit or been denied, so you may be behind someone else, but call and find out."

Why do i have the feeling that there's a heavy tobacco lobbying influence at work here? I don't care for vaping but it seems to be a far better delivery system than tobacco, which is freebased with ammonia.  The net result of this legislation is a huge victory for the tobacco industry and helps them craft both blueprints and establish precedents as they fight vaping growth in all of the other states.  Not to mention 130 jobs just went out the door because, as politicians well know, fear and ignorance will always win out over rationality and common sense."

I'm not saying that the legislation is perfect (or even good, really) but understanding its purpose makes me a little less angry about it.  If vaping causes even a single person to start smoking (and I've seen no evidence that it hasn't) then it should share in burden taxpayers have of paying for health care for smokers. If that tax persuades people to not smoke or vape, all the better."

He also says that companies mRketing e-cigarets should be doing so within that in mind and not glamorizing it.   I can't speak to your establishment, but as far as I can tell from the marketing I've seen done in the media and even locally in terms of how the ""vap lounges""are positioned, everyone is trying their best to make vaping look as sexy as possible."

Not to mention the fact that cigarettes are sold in every gas station and grocery store, while vape pens are sold, primarily, in specialty shops.

Bellingham,3az2hf,TheEmperorsNewHose,2,Wed Jun 24 23:51:55 2015 UTC,"I pay a lot in taxes, as well, and some of those taxes helped subsidize your public education. I have yet to complain about that, and I don't plan on starting anytime soon. But the point is that, 20 years ago, if someone who shares your worldview had SUCCESSFULLY made an argument against ""pointless taxes"", you might not have been able to afford going to that public university. Or maybe your family is well off enough that it wouldn't have matter, who knows, but I suspect that if you chose to go to WSU, that wasn't the case. So - don't bite the hand. Sin taxes are the thing that keeps our state, and most others, afloat - literally, in that it pays for a large portion of our infrastructure. Bitch about federal taxes all you want, and I won't argue with you, because those are the taxes that go to pork-barrel projects, disgusting unnecessary wars, and pay the salaries of ineffective federal bureaucrats. But state taxes actually go to things that we, the people in this state, need, and I'd rather those taxes come from someone sucking watermelon flavored smoke out of a tortoise-shell colored plexiglass pipe than from someone buying bread at the grocery store."
Bellingham,3az2hf,TheEmperorsNewHose,2,Thu Jun 25 00:26:30 2015 UTC,"You're free to do whatever you want, hell, I'll set up a blogspot account just for you, where you can rant and rave about taxation all you want, but it takes an absolutely spell-binding lack of self-awareness to complain about a tax on an unnecessary luxury good while at the same time toting around a degree from a school that directly benefits from the that same tax"
Bellingham,3az2hf,TheEmperorsNewHose,2,Thu Jun 25 00:50:34 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's focus on the merits of the concept of a state tax in general. States are constitutionally barred from running a budget deficit, the way the federal government can. They need revenue, period, in order to function - literally to function, not ""give tax breaks to the wealthy"" or ""fund unnecessary wars."" Literally just to pay the bills. So, with that established, where should they generate that revenue? Should Washington, for example, enact a state income tax to go along with the state sales tax? Should we raise the sales tax on staple products, food, clothes, etc? Or should we raise taxes on optional, unnecessary recreational purchases, like e-cigs? I think the answer is pretty clear, but I'm curious to hear your view of why I'm wrong, I'm sure it'll be good for a laugh"
Bellingham,3az2hf,TheEmperorsNewHose,0,Thu Jun 25 04:17:21 2015 UTC,And then they wonder why they aren't getting the revenue they projected from a sin tax.

Bellingham,3ayppi,ezramoore,2,Wed Jun 24 22:15:50 2015 UTC,"Comcast, DirecWay/HughsNet, or Dial Up.  Or that Wireless Internet service if it's still around and services your area.  The only real viable option is Comcast, unfortunately, as all the other options I listed blow huge chunks. There was a place up off of Bakerview called Connect Northwest that I use to go through to swing deals with Comcast. If they're still around give them a call."
Bellingham,3ayppi,PETC,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:05:49 2015 UTC,"yes, you're stuck with Comcast if you want anything decent.  Not really any way to lower your bill unless you get the promotional price on one of their bundles.  And those aren't a very good deal anyways, just a way to get you to pay more.  The one thing I can suggest is that you buy your own modem.  You can get a good one for as low as $60, as opposed to renting one for $7 a month.  Only do this if you're fairly tech savvy though, as they will not provide support if you have a problem and you're not using their equipment.  edit: something like this: http://www.amazon.com/ARRIS-Touchstone-Cable-Modem-DOCSIS/dp/B008GG78FU/ref=sr_1_9?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1435173810&sr=1-9&keywords=docsis+3.0  edit 2: I just looked at my Comcast bill and I don't actually see an equipment charge on it for the modem.  So, maybe they've changed their policy.  Something to ask the agent about I guess. (I also just realized we've been getting HBO for free.... no idea how long that's been going on.... Figures that I'd find this out right after GoT ends)"
Bellingham,3ayppi,aspbergerinparadise,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"I don't have any tips on getting the best price, but I do want to say that I've had Comcast, out of necessity, for the last couple years, and I haven't had any trouble with them, at all. Yeah, it's pricy, especially when you live alone, but my bill comes out to about $150 a month, now that my deals have expired. That's a lot, when you look at it in one lump sum like that. But it's also only $5 a day. I spend $5 a day on a lot of things that I get less use out of than I do digital cable/high speed internet.   Obviously I'd love to pay less, who wouldn't? But when you really think about it, you're definitely getting value for your money."
Bellingham,3ayppi,TheEmperorsNewHose,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:04:30 2015 UTC,I hope that's for a bundle and not just internet.

Bellingham,3ayppi,beardpunch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:27:01 2015 UTC,"I've manged to get promotional rates and deals by doing everything in the Service Center, the people there have been helpful. Calling Comcast has never been a good experience, but going in person has worked.   Best time is at the end of the year. I went in December to get rid of the TV and go just internet, they dropped the just internet price  and gave me TV and HBO just to get numbers up.   Plus you get hard copies of everything and can watch them to make sure they aren't screwing you over more than usual."

Bellingham,3aq53k,sleepinghuman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:04:54 2015 UTC,"I'd love to do that but the issue is preparing the grits. The grits are prepared daily and making grits for dinner for just one dish would be a waste issue. But perhaps if we switched to a grit cake that could be pan fried to order, possibly. I'll think about it, that's for sure. Chicken and waffles is a possibility as well, especially for brunch. We need to invest in a good commercial waffle maker."

Bellingham,3aq53k,kalamensch,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:09:43 2015 UTC,"Ahh, and I see now you meant all breakfast and not just shrimp and grits, haha. That's definitely a line space issue. You need to have all your prepped product (eggs, cut proteins, cut vegetables, english muffins, hollandaise, etc. etc.) out in the cooler and during dinner that space is filled with dinner prep. So we don't have to room to over a menu that big, much less the ability for our cooks to prepare that many different dishes. The larger the menu is, the harder it is during busy times to do things in batches, which is how a cook handles order volume. Making five pork po boys is much easier than making one shrimp and grits, one benedict, one pork po boy, one steak and one pasta, despite the fact that both are five dishes."
Bellingham,3aq53k,kalamensch,3,Tue Jun 23 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"Nothing much to ask, just want to say you are my favorite weekend brunch spot.  The bloody Mary bar helps, but I get a serious craving your your bennys."

The water usually doesn't get warm enough until July/August but it has been unseasonably warm.  You could probably see it just fine.  Just make sure you're in a place with little/no light pollution.

The problem with taking the kids though is that you are going to have to go there pretty late to really see a good show (around 11pm in the summer). I've been going for a quite a while and I've found that the best time to go is on a day that the sun has been out all day, during a new moon (less light in the sky and all around the better!) and at low tide.

We recycle all our cardboard, but I don't really mind if somebody takes it off our hands, as it's less work if I don't have to break it down & cram it into our dumpster. I've had people use this stuff for grass-killing projects before, and it's great because it's huge swaths of cardboard.   Probably won't get to this project until sometime Wednesday or Friday, and would prefer if it could be picked up ASAP. I'll see if I can't shoot you a PM early the day of, when it might be available."

You'll also see if you use google maps that none of Lake Padden, nor Lake Whatcom are inside of Google's boundary for Bellingham, but I'm pretty sure the city considers all of Lake Padden and part of Lake Whatcome inside of the city.  As far as I know, Whatcom County's official Northern Border and the Canadian Border are synonymous"
Bellingham,39v6ae,disastrophy,3,Mon Jun 15 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is correct. You can see the same errors show up at Lake Shannon, Hanging Lake, and several other small ponds that fall along the county line."

That isn't unique to point Roberts, though, many border towns do this to increase sales, including in the Meridian area of Bellingham.  Many Vancouver businesses accept the American dollar and in Victoria nearly every place will take American money.    I don't know about the gas thing though, can't help you there.

The new rules are actually pretty enjoyable to read through, and I've been curious about how they'll actually play.  Been a little busy saving up and planning for summer events (PAX Prime, lookin' at you) but if there's some real interest I might be interested.

Should they pass 250 votes, they are eligible to be selected for one of 20 $100,000 grants, from among all qualifying businesses that reached the vote total.  In last years campaign, approximately 2,309 businesses applied and 588 acquired the votes to move on.  Of the 588, 20 were selected (3%).  However, the selection process is very subjective (chosen by a panel), not random.  All that said, it looks like a cool project and I would love to see a local business win it, so I am going to log in and vote for you (as soon as the vote button is functional again...)."

Bellingham,38zhoa,Bifidus1,2,Mon Jun 8 05:38:51 2015 UTC,Seeing as it has been one of the worst snow years on record I doubt there is much snow now. I was there at the end of March and there wasn't even snow at the bottom of Chair 1.  Snow in August? Of course on an average snowfall year. They didn't even get half the average snowfall this year.  http://www.onthesnow.com/washington/mt-baker/historical-snowfall.html?&y=2015&q=base

Regardless of which one, or neither, you choose, it should be fairly easy to duplicate, as it is essentially just a pepper sauce. As I'm sure you're aware, be careful working with peppers. Wear gloves, don't touch your eyes or nose. Good luck."

Another thing to keep in mind is that Uber has been claiming they'll be launching here in Bellingham for months now. I even went to their ""launch"" party which they then transitioned into a ""meeting the community"" party after realizing they wouldn't actually be going live. They hit a bunch of trouble in Portland around the same time they were looking to launch here and I think that took priority.

The relaxed environment kept me from feeling miserable about the work I was doing, and that led me to actually focus better. But I figure this could be applied to parks as well. I imagine there might be some quiet corners in any number of our parks. Just remember to bring something to weight down any papers if it's windy.   If you're looking for something indoors though, I would try experimenting around at different restaurants/cafes/etc. Maybe a sleepy, not too busy cafe at one of their booth seats(and hey, Coffee! :D) You could even express wanting a quieter seat in the cafe to do some studying while you eat/drink, and you get to know some of our smaller and local food places."

Bellingham,38bga5,GrendelTheCat,6,Wed Jun 3 04:32:37 2015 UTC,"I'm currently house hunting and have seen a few houses that have been utterly ravaged by dogs whose owners don't give a crap. There was one house on F Street whose 100-year-old hardwood floors are utterly destroyed by years of urine-soaked carpet. No wonder it was so cheap!   It's a sad truth that a few bad apples spoil the bunch. If a landlord has one idiot dog owner that leaves the rental with thousands of dollars in damage, said landlord will obviously re-think their pet policy. No one wants to pay a $5,000 pet deposit, but that's how much a remediation could cost the owner. So instead, they simply refuse to accept pets."
Bellingham,38bga5,beerandbikenerd,7,Wed Jun 3 15:40:32 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it's because the financial risk is greater than the security deposit they feel comfortable charging renters.  I'm sure you are probably a responsible pet owner, and your pooch is properly trained, but the majority are not.  Especially those in the market of renting apartments.  You might consider spending a little more and renting a privately owned condo.  Private owners are often more tolerant.  Especially if they are dog lovers themselves."

Bellingham,38bga5,thatediblesguy,2,Thu Jun 4 04:23:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think its necessarily a Bellingham issue.  Lots of landlords don't want to deal with the potential problems.  A good dog might net them a little bit of income off the non refundable portion of the deposit (not likely), but the chances that a dog does far more damage than can be covered with a pet deposit is also a possibility with much bigger impact.    I think the biggest difference between regions is the demand for housing.  In markets that are flooded landlords are far more likely to attempt to draw in renters and open themselves to a bigger market.  In a place like Bellingham where most rentals don't sit empty for very long and many are booked well ahead of time landlords can find plenty of non pet owners and they all pay the same rent."

So we'd sell ours for about the same price at $200.  We don't have any lighting for sale, but you can always keep an eye on craigslist. The product reviews on BandH are pretty reliable and nofilmschool.com is always a great resource when considering new gear.

Bellingham,388pxb,Deaf_Pickle,2,Tue Jun 2 17:45:14 2015 UTC,"The electronics engineering degree is a AAS and is transferable to WWU to finish the engineering degree.   First year is the same as Instrumentation &  Control (literally same class)   second year focus is programming and design.    They are now offering a BS for electronic tech and management as well.   Those are brand new programs and should be similar to WWU's program they used to offer.   It's very fast paced, each quarter is usually 4 classes ran consecutively.   It was a test a week,  3 tests per class.   If you can make it through the first quarter doing well, you have a good shot at the program.   Good teachers, nice and stocked labs,  lots of help available.     They start you out with the basic basics and ramp it up quick.  Each class set (DC1 DC2) has a project that will mainly utilize your own design, troubleshooting and packaging.   Some are kits though as well.   Was really fun for me but I've always loved taking apart or fixing electronics.  Have good math skills (trig, at least pre-calc), soldering skills can be learned but helps if you already know how.    Pretty hardcore schedule but can be fun!   Edit : I forgot about the CET (certified electronic technician) certificate that,  if you do okay the first year, you should pass  it as well and that's worth a lot for regular work.

My recommendation is to look for a place on the fringes of downtown - ie down State St towards the New York Pizza/Green Frog area, or further down Holly near Bayou/Wild Buffalo - you get all the benefits of downtown without the parking restrictions/junkies/bro fights you'll be exposed to along Railroad.  Also, if you have a car, and have the option to pay for a parking spot, do it.

Bellingham,37mrfk,itsmeee,12,Thu May 28 20:00:38 2015 UTC,Why do people have cameras if they are crap quality?

Bellingham,37mvuq,nerdcamper,3,Thu May 28 20:13:09 2015 UTC,"I lived at Cascade Meadows for about 5 years and only recently had to move due to their new 'low income' regulations, so I can talk about some pros and cons of that area.  Pros:  -Its a nice location. Within easy walking distance of WCC, a few restaurant places (Oiishi, IHOP, Soy House, Westside Pizza, Goji, etc), the Community Food Co-Op, Peacehealth, the drivers licensing place, Best Buy and more. Fred Meyer and Winco are both within about a mile or less, can even walk there easily. Parking lot view isnt great, but if you get a nice place looking out towards the little woodsy area it's not bad. -Affordable! About $855/mo for a 2 bedroom, and the one I was in at least was a really big 2 bedroom with a nice layout. Plenty of space. Great rooms for the price. -The office ladies are awesome! -PLENTY of parking! Hardly ever had to park away from my building, pretty much only during construction when they'd rope off some parts of the lots.  Cons: -Lots of students, particularly exchange students. This may be changing due to new regulations (something something low income places cant be all students?) but it does mean you get parties. Our stairwell had a whole lot of vomit down it quite often and it didn't seem to ever get cleaned (gods that stairwell was so sour smelling). For a while we had issues with people singing karaoke at 3 am. Sounded like a dying cat. -Things that break take a while to get fixed. Our stairwell light didn't even work so it was pitch black at night for the last month or so we were there. It's probably still broken. -My car got vandalized twice while I was living there. One time someone carved their initials in it, another time my tire literally got stabbed. I don't even talk to people so there'd be no reason to target my car, so probably just assholes. -(edit to add) The dumpsters. Are. TERRIBLE. Residents are really shitty about putting their trash where it goes. Diapers in the cardboard bin was not an uncommon sight. In fact, they used to pop up in EVERY bin so they got rid of all recycling except said cardboard bin. People like leaving trash strewn about the entire ground there, you cant get to the dumpster without stepping over mounds of garbage.  Overall it was a good place. Wish we could have stayed, but a low income rule doesn't play nice when the income earner has a position highly tipped in the first few months of the year (they judged income based on first 2 or 3 months of the year extrapolated out, which I think is silly)."

In our 5 years they replaced the fridge, washer, and dryer, just because they were getting old.   Best of all, no property management jerks to deal with. We only moved out after having a kid and needing more room.

Maybe it's individual owners renting their units out through different property management companies, I don't know. amazing location mostly off the street, so downtown noise was minimal secure building laundry in unit lots of the units are owned and owner-occupied, so it's a good quiet community.   Robin's Nest (2841/2843 W Maplewood)   pet friendly cheap (615 now for a studio with a balcony)  the location isn't as bad as people would have you think very friendly neighbors in my experience Managed by Windermere, who are pretty responsive compared to others in the area. Got my entire deposit minus an already agreed-upon carpet cleaning fee back.   1060 York (near Civic Field)   the only good quality is that they are VERY cheap ($750 for a 2  bedroom) gunshots were fired at the building while i lived there neighbors dealing drugs, most neighbors short-term. lots of drama in the parking lot.

Moved here from Burlington a couple of years back, got the exact same impression.

I'm genuinely asking.  I get that it brings media attention but at the same time it's seems people just see people like this as a bunch of nuts."

It's completely idiotic. The cop had nude pictures of a 16 year old girl on his phone who he was lead to believe was 19.  At 16 years old most girls are fully developed into an adult body, sure it's still illegal, but it's highly unlikely this guy is a grotesque child molester who preys on very young girls. The question about the small child being raped that's the dumbest shit I've ever read. The cop was a speaker for hope4justice which taught the public about sex predators. I'm not saying what he did was right, but in the case I think this guy just got totally screwed by the system. To infer this cop is a dangerous predator and preys on little girls is a extremely serious stretch."

Bellingham,36x46u,armon645,2,Fri May 22 22:36:24 2015 UTC,"I made the mistake of going there the weekend after the big hit review they got came out, and it was horrible.  We had to wait an hour to be seated, it took another hour to get are food, and everything was so overcooked it was inedible.  Like I literally took two bites, and the second one took several minutes of screwing up my courage -- and I was starving.  After spending two and a half hours there and leaving hungry, I ended up getting a breakfast sandwich at Hagens.  It was actually probably the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I would never go back unless they've gotten a lot less popular or greatly expanded their kitchen staff and the size of their dining room, both of which I understand they won't be doing.  So no Homeskillet for me."
Bellingham,36x46u,Machinemagic,-1,Sat May 23 13:28:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe you shouldn't have gone on that weekend. Read their website - one cook does everything with minimal wait staff.

To get crispy potatoes, don't crowd the pan, and add a few capfuls  of vinegar to the seasoning. I also like to toss mine with nutritional yeast because it makes them never stick to the pan.

Bellingham,36x46u,3sheeting,1 point,Mon May 25 19:41:53 2015 UTC,"Any regular (i.e. not balsamic, fruit) vinegar you like will work. You just use a little bit so you won't taste it in the finished product.  Have you ever had nutritional yeast before? You can buy it in bulk at the Co-op/Terra, probably Fred Meyer, etc. It's delicious, and fortified with vitamin B-12, one of the only non-animal sources of that vitamin. Nutritional yeast is often called vegan crack, lol. But you don't have to be vegan to love it.  It really is yummy, and versatile. You can make cheesy sauces out of it, sprinkle it atop salads, roasted potatoes, popcorn, etc. It also happens to make potatoes not stick to the baking sheet. Go figure. I also use it whenever I marinate and pan fry chickpeas or artichoke hearts. It makes kind of a creamy breading, and pairs well with the flavors of the chickpeas / artichoke hearts."

Overall it is my favorite place to grab a cheap but high-quality bite to eat in Bellingham. They even offer up gluten-free and vegan options for the more discerning diner."
Bellingham,36x46u,agnosticbeliever138,2,Sat May 23 02:28:44 2015 UTC,Only $88.95 for that sandwich!  Lol. JK
Bellingham,36x46u,Vaycent,2,Sat May 23 22:27:38 2015 UTC,"Their combo deals are actually priced very well, in my opinion. You can get three different salads from their rotating selection and some yummy bread for less than ten dollars. or Soup and salad. Or have them make you a sandwich or pick from the large selection of pre-made sandwiches. It's a little pricier than subway maybe but especially if you are vegetarian or vegan they have way better ingredient choices, IMO.  I love their baked tofu. They make all kinds if flavors of that and I buy a slice and just walk out the door and eat it like a candy bar. Yumzers."

Bellingham,36wgzs,S8975,16,Fri May 22 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"Taking away signs is not a way to write more speeding tickets, Jensen said.   Bullshit"
Bellingham,36wgzs,aspbergerinparadise,14,Fri May 22 19:51:04 2015 UTC,"“The ultimate dream is we would be able to cut down enough signs, and people would know, ‘I should drive 25 until something else tells me,’” Jensen said.  In Whatcom County, the speed limit is 35 mph unless otherwise posted."
Bellingham,36wgzs,brasiwsu,2,Fri May 22 20:17:17 2015 UTC,"True for unincorporated Whatcom county, but cities can make their own ""unless otherwise posted"" criteria."
Bellingham,36wgzs,Googunk,5,Fri May 22 23:52:01 2015 UTC,"This doesn't go far enough.  We should save even more taxpayer money by taking down all of the speed limit signs. Also, get rid of street lights and stop signs, the ultimate dream is people would know ""I should stop now and wait for the other cars.""   ""Jensen said it will be at least six months before city workers begin taking down signs.""  ""the city could save money normally devoted to maintaining and replacing current signs.""  ""A sign typically lasts 15 to 20 years, Jensen said""   How is sending someone out to replace the signs more costly than sending someone out to remove it?  Why not just let the existing signs remain until damaged or lost and then remove them?  Removal of existing signs is a much different process than non-replacement of obsolete signs.   ""Twenty signs per year are replaced due to damage or fading, costing a total of $2,200 each year in materials, the city estimates.""   $2200/year to prevent speeding in the residential areas which have 25 MPH limits is a fantastic deal."
Bellingham,36wgzs,Googunk,2,Sat May 23 00:02:28 2015 UTC,"The math seems off.  They say they are replacing 20 signs per year.  There are 174 signs total.  The signs last for 15-20 years before they need to be replaced.  It costs  $2.2k per year to replace signs. I'm too high to figure this out, but if the signs last 15 years, and there are only 174 signs, how the hell are they changing 20 per year?  And each sign costs $100?  For $6 in steel and $1 in laminate?  Something is fishy here."
Bellingham,36wgzs,westphall,2,Sat May 23 01:04:57 2015 UTC,"$100 doesn't surprise me much.  You are paying only a small amount in material, but someone has to take the time to make it and then you usually have a pair of maintenance guys working together to replace them.  At $25/ hr each, that adds up faster than you might think, especially since they are probably digging the old post out and installing a new one if it's in bad shape"
Bellingham,36wgzs,disastrophy,1 point,Sat May 23 02:48:28 2015 UTC,"They are often replaced when damaged by graffiti, stickers, being hit, shot at, etc."
Bellingham,36wgzs,FrogOrCat,1 point,Sat May 23 07:38:28 2015 UTC,"yeah, if they're replacing signs every 15-20 years (avg 17.5), then every year they should be replacing 1/17.5 of the signs.  174 * (1/17.5) = 9.94   So... 10 signs a year.  Half of what they're quoting."
Bellingham,36wgzs,aspbergerinparadise,3,Mon May 25 16:09:27 2015 UTC,Can they use the money from grocery store bags to pay for the signs?

Front desk folks are a bit frowny face, but whatever. Some kinda weird rules for my place  (only 3 plants allowed, thanks home pot grower guy). Anyway, so far so good for me."
Bellingham,36t2nc,cheapdialogue,10,Thu May 21 23:43:30 2015 UTC,Ever seen a property management company with good reviews?  Just tenants being tenants.
Bellingham,36t2nc,brasiwsu,5,Thu May 21 23:29:42 2015 UTC,"I know people that work there and other management companies in town. Unlike a lot of property managers and their employees, the Misty Mountains people genuinely care about their tenants and tenant relationships. There will be people here with scary stories, like there are for any business (especially property managers), but the people who work there have their hearts in the right place, which is more than I can say for a lot of others."
Bellingham,36t2nc,ezramoore,2,Fri May 22 01:27:48 2015 UTC,"Haven't had any bad interactions with them necessarily. I just wasn't too happy when they bought out my old rental company mid lease and started charging for parking spots in what had previously been first come, first serve for tenants. They also raised the rent $100/mo at lease renewal so I moved on."
Bellingham,36t2nc,Grreatt,1 point,Fri May 22 04:20:26 2015 UTC,"Did Misty Meadows OWN your rental or just manage it? Because if they just managed it, it was on clear direction from the owner, possibly a new one that you were not aware of. It's very common for commercial property to be on the market without the tenant's knowledge. Regardless if it's the same owner or a new one, raising rents and finding additional income and such are par for the course."
Bellingham,36t2nc,FrogOrCat,2,Fri May 22 18:41:59 2015 UTC,"I guess I can go into some more detail. MM bought the whole apartment complex, retaining the previous manager, but changing several policies in the process. We didn't know it was on the market, but we were informed once the deal had been done. Mostly this was okay because the lease we signed protected us from the majority of changes they were making, rent included.  Parking was one thing not covered under our lease though because there were enough spots built in to accomodate ~2/apartment, so it was always just an informal first come basis. When they took over we were informed that we were then only alotted 1 spot and would have to pay a monthly rate (suspiciously near the cost of a campus parking pass) for an additional one or be towed. Then they put up signs for long term parking plans outside our building. My roommate and I ended up splitting the difference to maintain our spots, but I was never happy about it. /vent  You're completely right about raising the prices being standard practice. It was already a little on the high side for what we had before the hike though. It was a good kick to get me looking at other options, ended up with a cheaper place that was bigger and in a better location for the next year. Maybe I should be thankful.."
Bellingham,36t2nc,Grreatt,2,Sat May 23 00:15:22 2015 UTC,"I spent a year renting a house from them in Kendall. Despite the sketchy neighborhood, Misty Mountain Realty did a great job keeping on top of things like winterizing the house, cleaning the gutters, making sure the lawn was mowed when I let it get overgrown. They were never rude to me, even when they had to politely nudge me to move my trash bags out of sight and mow the lawn.   They're super responsive to any issues you might have, even over email, they'll respond within a couple hours. I had such a good experience there, if I owned a house and needed someone to manage it, this would be the company for me.  Oh and, they rented to me without even meeting me, which was really convenient since I was living on the east coast at the time. So I was able to arrange everything via email, and then I just paid my rent online and showed up at my new house with no problems!  ...Except that there were tons of giant spiders in the house because we were renting it for a month before we moved in. But they sent someone over to spray as soon as I emailed about it. Overall, I think they're great!  I know I wasn't the best tenant, since I even snuck a dog into the house when it was against the lease terms, but they were reasonable about that situation too, and just had me fill out a pet form and pay the pet deposit when they found out. A less tolerant landlord might've just kicked me out on the spot!"
Bellingham,36rvjj,jtran10,13,Thu May 21 17:01:51 2015 UTC,"I can't believe nobody has mentioned that this weekend is the biggest festival of the year in Bellingham: Ski to Sea. There is a multi-leg race on Sunday that starts at the top of the Mt. Baker Highway, and continues through the Chuckanut area (race diversion due to lack of snow this year), where ""it all ends in Fairhaven."" So, on Sunday you'll not be able to drive to Baker until the afternoon, and then it will still be slow going. You can find out more about it here http://www.skitosea.com/  With that being said, it's the biggest festival of the year! On Saturday there's a parade that flows through downtown Bellingham on Cornwall Ave, a walk of about 4 blocks from your BNB. On Sunday you could go to several spots to view different legs of the race if that floats your boat. Beginning at noon there's a festival in Fairhaven with food booths and live bands and arts and crafts! It's plenty packed with people, though. http://www.fairhaven.com/events/detail/6385/  Oysters: Rock & Rye Oyster House  There are three great Bellingham breweries you can walk to from your BNB: Wander Brewery, Kulshan Brewery, and Bounday Bay Brewery. They all have websites. Wander and Kulshan have great street food trucks, and Boundary has good food.  Walk the bay trail from downtown through Boulevard Park to the Fairhaven Festival on Sunday. You could also stop at the Bellingham Farmer's Market downtown and buy delicious food for a picnic. It's handily located across the street from Boundary Bay, and is open on Saturdays.  Kulshan Cycles downtown rents. Kayaks may be difficult to come by, as kayaking is one leg of the race.  Bellingham is hopping this weekend, you'll have a blast!"
Bellingham,36rvjj,TrixiDelite,2,Thu May 21 20:39:50 2015 UTC,"That party in Fairhaven on Sunday sounds great! It probably makes more sense to head out to Artist's Point and the Mt Baker Ski Area on Saturday then, and spend Sunday around town, correct? Should we make sure to do Chuckanut Drive on Saturday as well?"
Bellingham,36rvjj,TrixiDelite,3,Thu May 21 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, Artist's Point and Chuckanut on Saturday, as the race will affect both roads. It's a lot of driving for one day, though.  On your way to or from Baker you should stop at The North Fork Brewery and Beer Shrine and have some of the best pizza in the county and a beer. Great place. Or, if you want to spend more money stop in the town of Glacier and have lunch at Milano's.  On Chuckanut you could stop for appies and wine at the bar at Chuckanut Manor, or blow a fat wad of cash at the Oyster Bar (drool)."

Bellingham,36rvjj,aspbergerinparadise,2,Thu May 21 21:28:23 2015 UTC,"I would recommend doing Mt. Baker, OR Chuckanut.  It would be an extremely long and exhausting day to do them both."
Bellingham,36rvjj,FrogOrCat,1 point,Fri May 22 19:57:27 2015 UTC,"I am thinking this too. Which would you recommend? I'd imagine there is more ""to do"" on Chuckanaut, right?"
Bellingham,36rvjj,realiztik,2,Fri May 22 20:01:39 2015 UTC,"They're both pretty great.  Depends more on if you want to go up on top of a mountain, or do something down by the water.  You could probably do both, but just do a less demanding hike than Oyster Dome.  I'd recommend hiking down to Clayton beach (20-30 mins each way), or up to Huckleberry point (45-60 min each way).  It's been a while since I did Oyster Dome, but I remember it taking close to 3 hours to get to the top starting on Chuckanut Dr.  Artist's Point is spectacular (especially if it's a clear day).  And you can hike for as long you want up there, plus there's a couple of cool places to stop along the way.  Keep in mind that it's a 90 min drive from where you're staying to get to Artist's point if you don't make any stops at all.  So that's at least 3 hours in the car, but it is a gorgeous drive.  Another thing you could consider doing is renting Kayaks from the Community Boating Center in Fairhaven, and then taking them down to Larrabee State Park (which is along Chuckanut) - weather permitting.  What I'd probably do is head out for Artist's point fairly early in the day.  Hike around up there for as long as I wanted to.  Maybe stop at North Fork on the way back for a slice and some brew.  And then re-assess how I felt once I got back in town.  Maybe rest up for an hour or two then try to have a late evening picnic down by the water at Clayton Beach."

Bellingham,36rvjj,aspbergerinparadise,3,Fri May 22 01:54:42 2015 UTC,"No one has said this yet . . . Oyster Dome on the Cascade hiking map is a difficulty of a 3/5. The last bit is the hardest because you're contending with trees that are scrabbling to dig into a thin layer of dirt on top of rock. Be CAREFUL, if I hadn't caught my fall going down, I would have definitely broken my tailbone.  If you're into backpacking, there is a campsite not far from the lookout.  If you just want drink selection, and not really food, Elizabeth Station is where you want to go. They have hundreds of different beers, wines, ciders, ginger beers, you name it. Their website does not do them justice though, so you should checkout their Facebook.  A good breakfast place is the Mount Bakery (you'll want the downtown location, the one in Fairhaven is just a bakery, no breakfast stuff.) You can get eggs Benedict made out of Belgian waffles and sweet and savory crepes. They also serve local kombucha and mimosas.  Also, it's worth mentioning that if you plan on eating at local places, don't wait til Monday to do it, because half of the eateries are closed on Mondays, and on top of that, it's a federal holiday, and most places will take it off."
Bellingham,36rvjj,sourcrude,2,Fri May 22 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately our weather forecast this weekend won't be sunny and warm, but you live in San Diego so you already get plenty of that. You may get some rain on Saturday!   Try the Community Boating Center in Fairhaven for kayak rentals. There was a recent post on GF restaurants. See my comment there.  Check out this report on GF beers in Bellingham. We've never been, my BIL (a beer snob currently living in Fort Collins, CO) and his wife loved going to Elizabeth Station when they were in town. A second for the walk from Fairhaven along the boardwalk to Boulevard Park though my recommendation is to park in Fairhaven. Parking in Boulevard Park is much harder. There are some nice easy mostlyflat hikes around Whatcom Falls. A drive up to Artist's Point and a hike around there (bring your food!) might be really nice too. The road just recently opened and it's really early this year; we're in a drought here too."

Tips for meeting people: Go to open mics like the Buffalo or join up with the pickers on the deck of the Geen Frog. Get to know Jen and everyone at Make.Shift. 120% of everyone at the Make.Shift Block Party are in bands or go to shows.  Hang out before and after gigs with bookers such as Michelle at the Shake Down and Kat at Honey Moon. Buy a drink from Dan Vee at the Red Light and find out where all the secret house parties are. Make friends, invite them to play.  Most importantly, treat it like dating. Instead of starting these conversations about what you want, your experience and connections, etc., get curious about other people, what they play, what they're passionate about in the local scene, etc. You'll learn a lot more and make more authentic connections. People here who are in it for the community find all kinds of crazy artistic collaborations and opportunities. People who are in it for themselves enounter the Bellingham Chill. Then they move."

Uhhh let's see.... The weather in late fall/early winter can be depressing, wet and windy.  On Dec 21 the sun rises at 8:30 and sets at 4:30.  It's a lot of darkness.

Bellingham,360mp1,FeedtheTroll,24,Sat May 16 19:36:58 2015 UTC,CANADIANS EVERYWHERE! Seriously they take over the mall and costco and they aren't the best drivers. It's hard to shop at costco anymore because it's always packed.
Bellingham,360mp1,Wally13,5,Fri May 15 02:31:23 2015 UTC,It's actually been relatively calm these last couple of months.
Bellingham,360mp1,FrogOrCat,7,Fri May 15 04:40:45 2015 UTC,The exchange rate has fallen. It's lowered the Canadians incentive for a border run.
Bellingham,360mp1,lordhellion,3,Fri May 15 05:12:40 2015 UTC,"Also, because of this, the stores are always sold out of things because the canadians bought it all. It's really annoying. Don't even bother trying to go to walmart, they are always sold out of everything.  There are also a lot of homeless people asking for money."
Bellingham,360mp1,AstonishingX-Woman,4,Fri May 15 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"I recently moved here and I was shocked at how empty the Wal-Mart was. Where I came from, the shelves were always full and I never had problems finding anything. Here, the shelves are a barren wasteland and the people there are absolutely idiotic. I've went twice and ended up having to bump people out of the way to get by them, no matter how much I said ""excuse me"". One of the times I went they had ONE checkstand open and the store was packed. People (including me) were pissed because they weren't doing there jobs and I saw about 20 employees sitting in the back, just talking to each other.   -10/10, won't set foot there again."
Bellingham,360mp1,NintendoNoNo,5,Fri May 15 18:10:54 2015 UTC,I've lived in five states.  That is how every Walmart ive ever been to is like.  It has the reputation it had for a reason.  Maybe your Walmart was different but empty shelves and rude patrons who live to be in your way is just part of shopping at Walmart.  That's why people pay the premiums to target.
Bellingham,360mp1,wildweeds,2,Fri May 15 18:28:09 2015 UTC,"I definitely didn't like the one I used to go to, but I didn't think it could get worse than it.

Bellingham,360mp1,S8975,2,Fri May 15 18:52:38 2015 UTC,"Walmart isn't empty because of Canadians.  Walmart is known for not keeping their shelves stocked.  Ive lived in several states and its the same everywhere.   Also,  it makes sense that people from other countries and towns might be a little more unfamiliar with our signage and driving customs.  When im in Canada I always feel like I have to double check that I know what im doing.  It's just..  Slightly different and everyone else is on autopilot.  It's the same for anyone not local to any place.  They don't know the best lane or when to merge so they discover it at the last second.  It's not like they are just heathens out to clog up our cities. And the mall,  well it sucks so who cares if they shop there.  There's only like two restaurants left and stores keep closing."
Bellingham,360mp1,wildweeds,3,Fri May 15 18:25:06 2015 UTC,"No, I have never seen a walmart as empty as the one in Bellingham."
Bellingham,360mp1,AstonishingX-Woman,4,Sat May 16 01:41:19 2015 UTC,It's honestly worth the drive to go to Burlington. Their Costco feels like a ghost town compared to Bellingham's. It's wonderful.

Bellingham,360mp1,alienanimal,27,Fri May 15 15:37:21 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to the naysayers.    The Canadians concentrate in the Meridian retail area. So locate yourself south of Sunset and shop at Fred Meyer, Hardware Sales, Haggen, etc. I live on the southside and I haven't shopped north of downtown in years. I have missed nothing.  The homeless congregate around Old Town and bum around the downtown core. They are nowhere near as aggressive and nasty as, say, Portland. Bellinghamsters are just small town folk so whenever someone spanges them or they see some crusty with a shopping cart, they freak out. Don't worry about the homeless here. They are no problem.  You won't find any Michelin stars here but there is a huge array of eateries, breweries, and taverns. Everything from cheap gut bombs to decent dining to international cuisine can be found. Some of it is very good indeed.  The students here are a dream compared to most places. Yes, they get drunk and rowdy downtown on weekend nights. But they are largely lily white suburban kids or Asian exchange students. Well behaved for the most part. Locals complain because they have to wait in line behind six students at Starbucks. Waaaa.    If there's anything negative about Bellingham, it's the lack of good touring acts coming through town and the lack of specialist shops for those with quirky hobbies. Oh, and the gray. But you either get used to the weather or you moan about it. I prefer the former.   Source: Lived in NJ, NY, TN and CA. Have lived in Bellingham over 20 years."

Bellingham,360mp1,Wally13,12,Fri May 15 21:01:54 2015 UTC,"Good point.   In my mind, the negatives are:   Job situation sucks unless you are a degreed professional.  Real estate is overvalued.  Have to go all the way to Seattle for major events, most airline travel, etc.  ""Chill"" attitude can rankle folks who need everything done in a New York minute.  The weather. But at least you can say funny jokes like: ""Living in Bellingham is like having a really hot girlfriend who is sick 300 days a year."""

Bellingham,360mp1,nosajholt,2,Wed May 20 14:44:17 2015 UTC,"All of this. Basically, if you've dealt with the homeless in Seattle then Bellingham will be a breeze. Sure, there are quite a few homeless people, but I've never had even one of them bug me for food or money. That being said, it is a college town. The students may be more likely to beg you for money. As for the parties, the vast majority of students are actually very very relaxed. Weed is the drug of choice here, so unless you hate people with the munchies you'll be fine. In my opinion, the food here is great. If it doesn't live up to your standards then join the students and get it while high."

Bellingham,360mp1,chocopuppet,4,Sat May 16 00:52:42 2015 UTC,"Cost of living is pretty high (gas, home prices, groceries).  There's a big 'Not-in-my-backyard' mentality, where many seem just anti-any kind of development, which makes it a little bit unfriendly to new business growth.  The weather can get colder at times in the winter from a Frasier River Valley outflow, but besides that it's very typical PNW climate-wise."
Bellingham,360mp1,Blueprint81,1 point,Fri May 15 16:35:43 2015 UTC,"seriously, seems like people protest just so they can feel above other people who don't know the issues like they do"
Bellingham,360mp1,TheBigJasonGenova,18,Sat May 16 12:47:24 2015 UTC,"This is a very unpopular opinion, but I don't think Bellingham's food scene is that good. All of the popular spots are mediocre and all of the really good spots are overpriced.   Downtown also has a large homeless population. The thing is, the homeless people in Seattle and Portland have always seemed like normal people without homes. I never felt troubled by them and have made friendly conversation. However, a lot of the people that hang out in downtown Bellingham are downright frightening. It can be sketchy walking alone at night."
Bellingham,360mp1,canireddit,7,Fri May 15 04:04:14 2015 UTC,"What about Streat Food? Weekly rotating menu, well seasoned and inventive food, reasonable prices, parks at breweries. Yum."
Bellingham,360mp1,iLaughAtYourFart,0,Fri May 15 06:06:16 2015 UTC,"That's one food truck.  And they're pretty good, but not great.  On the whole, Bellingham's food scene is pretty lacking."
Bellingham,360mp1,aspbergerinparadise,3,Fri May 15 17:44:21 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, to each his own. Maybe myself and my friends have a misplaced obsession with Streat Food...    But you can definitely find some fine food around this town. Danielle's Back East BBQ: great food cart with amazing brisket and pulled pork. Neto's on Maplewood: fantastic and cheap burritos ($5) and Mexican food with housemade tortillas and salsas. Rock and Rye: great weekend brunch as well as innovative and tasty dinner options. The Local Publichouse: great curry fish and chips, awesome Reuben, good brunch options. Delicious Mischief: solid food truck. Not phenomenal, but I'm a fan of the shrimp po boy.    These are just my opinions and potential suggestions. Obviously we aren't in Seattle, but we have a few very decent options available. Cheers!"
Bellingham,360mp1,iLaughAtYourFart,10,Fri May 15 23:45:56 2015 UTC,"So true. Boomers has very mediocre burgers but everyone raves about them, I don't get it. The fries and shakes are good but the burgers are barely above fast food quality.   However there are a lot of solid $5-$10 places that crank out consistently tasty meals...the food scene isn't amazing but it isn't bad either."
Bellingham,360mp1,tillow,6,Fri May 15 04:13:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah unless it's Boomuary, and even if it is, I hate going there. Decent shakes, but not the best in town.   One thing I love about Bellingham's food scene is that you have El Capitan's, a taco truck, and A-B Crepes all open late and all centrally located. Good slices from Fiamma Pizza in the late night window as well. Even living in a big city now (Nashville), I can't find a ton of late-night food.   I'll give it to Fiamma Burger, though. Expensive, but worth it for a pretty good burger and a cool selection of sauces to dip fries in.  I also love the happy hour prices at Bob's. They have $3 burgers and though bare-bones in terms of toppings, you can't get much better for the cost vs product. Their caesar salad is cheap and pretty good, too. Cheap pitchers as well, and a decent selection of micros on tap.  Fuck, strEAT food has awesome stuff, but it's expensive. But you can sit outside of Kulshan and drink a good beer and feast on some awesome fries"
Bellingham,360mp1,theredmanspeaks,3,Fri May 15 06:07:19 2015 UTC,"Gotta find the smaller, less talked-abiut places. McKays is great in every aspect, Hana Teriyaki, El Riconcito and Coconut Kenny's are all good, reasonably priced places"
Bellingham,360mp1,detroitvelvetslim,1 point,Fri May 15 06:11:49 2015 UTC,"Hana was my hangover cure when I lived there. There's also pretty good burritos at El Jalapeño. I always just got the tofu sandwich and the roast beef sandwich from the Co-op, and their coffee is solid. That agave sugar is the only sugar I ever put in drip coffee. Otherwise I just got cheap slices from McKay's when I was looking for a quick bite."
Bellingham,360mp1,theredmanspeaks,2,Fri May 15 07:04:08 2015 UTC,Coconut sugar is THE sugar for coffee. Unbelievably good. They have it at the coffee counter at the Co-op so you can try it there.

Bellingham,360mp1,TameNaken,2,Fri May 15 06:22:00 2015 UTC,"No, you're absolutely right.  And I think most people would agree with you.  The restaurants scene is very meh."
Bellingham,360mp1,aspbergerinparadise,3,Fri May 15 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"I'll back you up on the food. If you're used to food that bites back, Bham cuisine is terribly bland and unambitious."
Bellingham,360mp1,lordhellion,0,Fri May 15 05:14:46 2015 UTC,Agreed 100%.  I'd go a step further and say that our food scene is piss poor and no one gives a shit.  College town...what are you going to do?
Bellingham,360mp1,DysonMachine,3,Tue May 26 19:40:27 2015 UTC,"Bellingham is a dead end with a view. So, if you work from home, it's the perfect place! :P There aren't a ton of opportunities in general, and definitely not a lot of advancement, but if you don't need that it is a beautiful city. If it wasn't a hopeless pit for my line of work I'd stay forever.   Be prepared for insane wind in the winter. The weather in general is not the best here, but that's par for the course in the NW."

Bellingham,360mp1,fayryover,4,Fri May 15 05:11:26 2015 UTC,"Personally, I love Bellingham/Seattle area weather. If it snows, it's only a couple of times a year and it melts quickly. So you still get the fun of snow but if snow annoys you it isn't for long. And The summers are filled with sunny days. We get on average a week or 2 of 90+ degree weather which i can deal with. The rest of the year is fairly mild. It doesn't rain hard often but the wind can suck but isn't constantly bad."
Bellingham,360mp1,nettletart,3,Fri May 15 22:24:07 2015 UTC,"I don't get the weather complaints. It is so delightfully temperate here. Rarely too hot or too cold. Yes, it rains, but that's why it's so beautiful here. And it rarely rains in the summer at all."
Bellingham,360mp1,cosmoismyidol,2,Sat May 16 20:42:50 2015 UTC,"MN, nice. I moved to Bellingham from IA about 6 months ago, also rocking a work from home job.   It reminds me a lot of northern MN, except maybe a little less scrappy..the proximity to Seattle probably helps. In terms of negatives, I do find the locals to be a little less..warm, than in the midwest. You will find it to be more crowded in general then MN, unless you live in the Twin Cities. The gray skies in winter are definitely unfortunate, but you do kind of adjust after a while.  One downside is the humidity. It is hard to air dry things, because the air is not dry, ever.   Can't think of anything else at the moment, if I do I'll add it. Good luck, moving across the country is not easy, or cheap. Let me know when you get here, I'll buy you a beer, if you want."

I moved here from california. my job also allows me to work from home. without my imported-from-california job, prospects are slim, and i would be making half what i make, IF i were lucky! however, working from home, completely alone, as you likely know, is very....solitary.

Bellingham,360mp1,NudgeTheMad,4,Sat May 16 01:10:39 2015 UTC,"I'm fifth generation Whatcom County, and was born and raised in Bellingham. I moved away for awhile. I've lived in big cities and small villages. I have a total love/hate relationship with Bellingham. Ever since the GP mill closed down the city council acts like it was given the green light to eradicate living wage jobs. They only want three types of people to move here: The Students - They are fine working for little money as long as they are free to pursue the arts. Their parents dump money into the college, but to no real benefit in society at large. The Elderly - They are already retired so they move here and don't add anything to the economy except the need for more low paying service industry jobs to support their needs. Thirdly: The People Who Have Enough Money To Move Here With Jobs They Can Telecommute To So Their Money Leaves The Local Area Immediately - These people drive up the local real estate to unobtainable levels for regular working folk and support business' who are developing products manufactured somewhere else. There is a vibrant art scene here. And plenty of people who are opposed to everything. Canadians are rude and clog everything up. But they also are one of the major sources of revenue. The local taxes they generate with spending are why we have so many amazing parks and trails. Bellingham is similar to Boulder, CO and Santa Cruz, CA; lots of money and idealism with an economy based on the migratory. EDIT - I should add that the hospital is one of the only sources of real income in the community. But Peace Health is doing everything it can to drive their employees wages down."

Bellingham,35yvra,nf5,3,Thu May 14 17:46:35 2015 UTC,If you are a fly fisherman head the south fork of the Nooksack. I would wait until mid June or July when the snow pack is already low. Fun to catch trout and small salmon before they head to the ocean. The south fork is less silty than the other forks. Above the Saxon bridge hatchery it is fly fishing only.

Bellingham,35qrf7,Crackertron,7,Tue May 12 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"While I agree it's ridiculous to think climate change is not real, revoking a degree seems like a cheap way to gather attention toward the problem.  Why don't they do scientific studies and publish them? Negative attacks are a bad way to go to get support for your issue."
Bellingham,35qrf7,kinther,7,Tue May 12 22:06:51 2015 UTC,Climate skeptics don't respond to science's near-consensus on anthropogenic climate change. Their real point here is to publicly shame Erickson; the stated goal of degree revocation is simply to means to that end.

Bellingham,35qrf7,therndoby,10,Wed May 13 03:03:39 2015 UTC,"I realize John Stewart has convinced an entire generation that satire is a substitue for rhetoric, but you cant defame a person's educational credentials without involving the institute that gave him those credentials. Should people also call into question the value and legitimacy of the university that gave him said degree? Did he buy a diploma, making the school unethical, or is it just a diploma mill that didn't take the time to notice their student was off target? That's a whole new can of worms, my friend, one where your baby goes out with the bathwater."
Bellingham,35qrf7,lordhellion,-1,Wed May 13 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"I don't particularly see the relevance of Jon Stewart in this conversation, other than referencing some generational opinion that is obviously already formed.  I seriously doubt that Western will strip the state senator of his degree. I also seriously doubt that the students think Western will agree with them. However, I do see the merit in the action to bring to light Erickson's ignorance."
Bellingham,35qrf7,therndoby,6,Wed May 13 07:55:48 2015 UTC,"The point isn't John Stewart, the point is using satire as a political statement only appeals to people already of a like mindset, a way to form a back-slapping, look-how-clever-we-are, self-satisfied society. It does nothing to create empathy from others, the stated goal. It just makes others think the group is a bunch of smug jerks."

SSC was able to provide 2 containers which look exactly like that you linked, one a 20-yard container, the other 30. They dropped it off when/where requested, and hauled it away when we were done. No idea how much it cost, though, as that was handled by my company's HQ. Call up SSC, though, and they can likely give you a quote. I've had nothing but good experiences with the service they provide, as they also handle our waste disposal, and paper, plastic film, and mixed materials recycling."

Bellingham,35i4rh,RoseGod,2,Mon May 11 04:25:25 2015 UTC,"I've been skating in Bellingham for the last 5 years or so. Before that, I grew up in Olympia and was pretty active in the Oly skate scene.   Culture: I'm not big on the Bellingham skate scene compared to Olympia. Mainly it doesn't have the same unified feel. Like, since it's more of a college town, it seems like the people filter through quicker so there is never a tight crew. At the park, people are more likely to cool-guy each other than crew up and actually skate together. The crowd in Olympia also seems less diverse in terms of age (I'm 26). I'm sure not everyone feels this way so I would be open minded.  Shops: There are two skate shops that I know of. One is WWS and it is at the bottom of the hill in Fairhaven. I have heard rumors that it might move downtown. The other is Unknown on Grant. These dudes are pretty cool and I feel like they have done a lot to improve the community since they opened. The host skate and non-skate events and are all around pretty cool dudes.   Spots: As for spots, the park on Lakeway is alright. I'm pretty burnt out on it. It has a bank section with like bank-to-ledges, small noping quarter pipes, and a step-up. It also have a pretty big bowl (ranges from like 4.5 foot quarter pipes to 10-12 foot vert). In the middle it has the ""old section."" It was build well before the rest of the park and is half un-skatable due to banks with huge inclines and whatnot. It's also far more crusty since Grindline built the rest of the park far more recently and more textbook. The quarters that are skatable in the old section or pretty chill if you like ramp skating.    There is a new DIY spot over by the Jack In The Box on Bakerview. It has a few DIY noping quarters and a flat box. It also has a goofy pole jam.  There is a ""bump"" skate dot at Franklin Park that is alright if kids aren't crawling all over it.   There is a mini ramp behind WWS. It's been sitting in the rain and needs love.  The Unknown dudes have access to a rad indoor extra-prime mini ramp that they let people skate now and again by donation. Kind of like a coop thing.   Besides that, there are a few street spots here and there. Burlington has a park. Sedro Wooly has a park. They both have lights are are fun. Canada has a butt-ton of parks. Western has some spots but watch those bricks sticking up. Lummi has a skatepark that is all street."

We have a few local shops in town, (Unknown, WWS, and one more I think?) But they're all very expensive and the staff at Unknown can be a bit cold if you aren't in their inner circle. I'll get a lot of flak for saying it, but I think the Zumiez at the mall is probably my favorite place for skate stuff.  Street spots are abundant if you're in the right part of town. Some places like WWU have put studs or stoppers (whatever you call those things) on some of the structures to prevent people skating on them."

Bellingham,35g5zf,auschwitzdiet,-1,Sun May 10 07:02:19 2015 UTC,"Yes they do. And while Vis probably has better quality fish, there is a certain process which precedes the actual ""sashimi grade"" label.  You can't get that at Vis because it's too fresh. Same with fish right out of the ocean.  It's all probably just as safe, but if you want ""sashimi grade,"" you gotta go to Fred Meyer."

I'm not gonna go through all of the points, but I could come up with reasonable doubt for each one of them. If I can, so did the prosecutor.  I know in the wake of Ferguson and everything since then that people are keen to expose corruption and ""one hand washes the other"" stuff, but in the end prosecutors are still project managers and their prosecutions are their projects. They have to assign and utilise resources in areas where they can have success.  When the prosecutor looked at this case - doubt related to the reason he possessed the images, reluctant witnesses, hearsay accusations of lying, evidence that can't be recovered? This is not a winner with a jury.  Getting him off the force, some punishment and registered is a solid takeaway from something that wasn't a sure thing. You can only prosecute people on what you can prove and what the defence can't disprove or call into doubt. So many points of this petition would be flat-out disallowed in a trial. The jury wouldn't even hear of it. If they did, the defence would move for a mistrial and get it.   Then, the DA as a project manager with limited resources is back to square one. Money's been spent, time lost and for what? You're back to square one.  Maybe he is corrupt and was doing the PD a favour. But even there, what is the PD going to do? Incriminate themselves and face a civil suit? Saying they're sorry would be admitting wrongdoing. That's not how it works."

Since they didn't go into details in that article, I don't know if this particular medical condition is one that could or could not be dealt with at the jail, but it doesn't surprise me that they would go this route with the sentencing if it was something that they didn't feel that they could handle."

Every once in a while, a stolen bike will slip through the cracks but it will usually end up at the flea market or somewhere in Skagit.

Bellingham,34gchd,charmlessman1,3,Thu Apr 30 22:30:57 2015 UTC,If the card is a local card bring it in and the bank can mail it out to the person. Alternatively you can put it in a mailbox and the post office will take care of it although that requires trusting to many people for my taste.
Bellingham,34gchd,thisisnothuman,3,Fri May 1 10:59:01 2015 UTC,They will just deactivate the card and send out a new one. They have no idea who has had the card or if the number is now compromised.

Bellingham,34ekj5,tiki18,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:46:55 2015 UTC,Sports Junkies and The Sports Exchange north of the border are decent. Craigslist locally can be fine. The league is non-checking and you can get by with minimal shoulder and elbow pads (if you are comfortable with that).

Bellingham,34ekj5,joshformayer,3,Fri May 1 00:34:43 2015 UTC,"Reading the link, it looks like we need to do an evaluation skate first to get placed in the correct division.  How does that work mid-season?  I would like to play - especially motivated watching the playoffs to get back into it.  Haven't played ice hockey in 15 years but played inline in a few leagues up till 2 years ago.  I suspect I'm D4.  Is there room on a D4 team?  I need to buy ice skates but should be set gear wise otherwise."
Bellingham,34ekj5,summerof79,2,Sat May 2 00:07:38 2015 UTC,There is no evaluation skate that I've ever heard of -- I'd start in 4 if you are unsure. Folks are very relaxed in that game. The teams dress in the same locker room and there is zero chippiness. Go and watch a few minutes of div 4 game (tuesdays) and a div 3 game (wednesdays) and see which you think you'd fit into better. Hit a stick and puck session beforehand.  Good times will follow.

Bellingham,34ekj5,boozencigs,1 point,Tue May 5 06:58:11 2015 UTC,Any level. You can be brand new to skating and come out and play. But I think you'll have more fun if you spend the summer practicing your skating.

Bellingham,34482m,NintendoNoNo,2,Tue Apr 28 04:11:37 2015 UTC,"You'll need to consider if it matters to you who you are certified through. Washington Divers offers SDI certification, Gone Diving offers SSI. Gone Diving also requires that you buy your own gear (mask, snorkel, wetsuit, fins, boots, and gloves), which can be quite expensive. I can't find any information about equipment rentals/requirements on WA Divers' website.  If it's an option for you at all, I would consider doing the studying portion here and then flying to Hawaii (cheap on Allegiant) or something and doing the dives there."
Bellingham,34482m,waoksldg,2,Tue Apr 28 05:08:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I talked to Gone Diving about a month ago and they told me this:  ""Our classes are easy to budget since we have all the prices up front for you to choose. Our beginning Open Water class is $350 and includes all your matiels needed to start and finish the knowledge portion of your scuba lessons. Including eight hours of confined/pool sessions scheduled over three days and four open water dives scheduled over two days. At the end of this course, you will be able to dive ANY WHERE in the world to 60ft.   We do have some basic equipment requirements in taking your Open Water scuba class. Scuba diving is a gear intensive sport so we have some packages to help you on your way to become a certified diver. Both packages include your rental for the bigger costly items like your 7mm wetsuit, vest/hood, weight integrated bouyance control device, air delivery system and information system. Along with the cylinders and weights need to explore the underwater world. Your own personnel mask, snorkel, open heel fins, 5mm boots, 5mm gloves, mouthpiece and plenty of tie zips that are your to keep. Having your own personnel equipment will help you gain confidence and comfortably with the lessons of breathing under water. Two price options: $225 is the budge option and you limit don your gear choices. The $450 is your choice of what ever we have in stock, your choice, also includes a mesh gear bag to keep your equipment together and 2 FREE days of rentals when you have finished your training. That is a $200 valve back to you to join one of our free shore group dives to hone in your new fresh scuba skills.""  From what I understand, it's $350 to take the class, plus pretty much another $450 to get the best gear possible from them? $800 to learn to dive seems like a lot to me. I'd assume it'd be a lot cheaper to buy decent gear online individually rather than just get what they have in their store. Do you think this would be correct? I was hesitant of taking the class there just because of the price but if that's what it takes, then I guess I have no choice!  Sorry for the long reply, btw."
Bellingham,34482m,waoksldg,1 point,Tue Apr 28 05:45:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I wouldn't buy things online sight-unseen. You're going to want to get a good fit on the mask and fins especially. If you're not planning on diving that frequently, I would see if you can find somewhere that will just rent you all the equipment. There are shops in Anacortes, Oak Harbor, Vancouver, Everett, Seattle.. going out of town might be your best option.   When I learned to dive, it was about 300 for the course which included all gear rentals. ~800 does seem like way too much."
Bellingham,34482m,FrogOrCat,1 point,Tue Apr 28 05:57:39 2015 UTC,"Scuba is a very expensive sport. Have you priced out what this shop or others are charging for rentals? Perhaps once you do you may see that it's on par.   What Gone Diving is requiring what was required when I was certified 15 years ago so it doesn't seem strange to me. I rented everything else from the shop and that was included in the OW course fee, just like at Gone Diving.  I've LOVED always having my own essential gear. Having ill-fitting gear is not fun and I really preferred having a mask that fit me perfectly. Fifteen years later it still fits and works perfectly and I've used it for diving and snorkeling all over the world."

Bellingham,33zqg2,41234,5,Mon Apr 27 03:39:39 2015 UTC,"I have a good friend who is celiac and I am gluten sensitive (not tested for celiac but have severe GI distress with gluten).  Lots of restaurants have GF items (pizza, pasta, etc.) here in town but cross contamination can be a problem. Brandywine is one of the few restaurants my friend has never been sick from eating at. I know she also eats at Taco Lobo often.   I love the GF fish and chips at Brandywine Kitchen. Totally greasy and delicious. http://www.brandywinekitchen.com/menu.htm#3 The GF mac and cheese is also really good.   Fiamma Burger has a nice GF bun but I'm also sensitive to xanthan gum so I usually avoid it. It only gives me really, really bad gas so sometimes I indulge in if I will be home shortly afterward. But they have a burger in a bowl which is really nice and that is what I usually get. Ask about cross contamination with the fryer if he's ordering fries. I don't have a problem physically with them but my friend won't eat them. They have a really nice breakfast sandwich and rosemary spiked hash browns. Both incredibly greasy.  Avenue Bread is a couple of nice locations and sometimes I'll get a sandwich there but I think they're too expensive for what you get and the counter service experience. I prefer the buckwheat crepes at Mt. Bakery or the GF pancakes at Diamond Jim's. The service is off at Diamond Jim's so I rarely go there.  Every once in a while we have pasta at The Table and they have a nice seasonal menu."

Emigration can be a long, slow process depending on method and your purpose for moving to the US.  The first step is to obtain a visa and green card.  Moving to the US without a work visa means that no legitimate business can hire you.  Once you move to the US and establish permanent resident status you can start the timer on being able to apply for citizenship, which for most people is 10 years or so.    Be prepared for lots of paperwork and lots of delays.  Understand that during certain parts of the process you may lose your ability to travel back across the border for a while.    If you've got a marketable tech degree or can get one, the H-1B visa is probably the easiest one to emigrate on, but you'll need to have already found a job before you move,"
Bellingham,33g4tg,disastrophy,2,Wed Apr 22 12:51:28 2015 UTC,"I don't live in town anymore, but I'm still subscribed to the sub and saw your post. Bellingham has a lot of resources that can help. One of the best immigration law firms in North America is headquartered in Fairhaven - Cascadia Cross-Border Law. Principal Greg Boos is very good at what he does, and would be an excellent resource for a consultation.   On the business side, Jim Pettinger at International Market Access in Ferndale has been helping people expand their Canadian business into the US for three decades (full disclosure: I used to work there). Jim has tips on how to do this in his monthly email newsletter, it's a good resource and I recommend signing up for it.   Western Washington University also has the Center for Canadian-American Studies and the Border Policy Research Institute, both publish information about cross-border trade and immigration that may be of interest as background info. (Full disclosure: I used to work there too).   One other resource is ReloNavigator. Junteet ""Jay"" is an expert on helping people move from Canada to the US, his consulting business helps people do that.   The Canadian presence in Whatcom County is quite large, and Bellingham probably has more resources to help you make a move down from Canada than any other city in the northwest if you do decide to pursue it.   Note that if you do move south of the border, you are legally obligated to become a Seahawks fan, if you aren't already. Good luck!"
Bellingham,33g4tg,soundslikepuget,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:19:39 2015 UTC,"I actually just did this Last Aug. We applied for a K1 Visa (fiance visa) at the end of Feb 2014 and did all the paper work/medical examinations/interviews and were approved within 6 mo. We had to get married within 3 mo of me moving here, then start the application process for a Employment authorization document/ Green card. It isn't cheap, the whole process probably cost around just under 5 k. I am now in line to have my green card interview in the beginning of May but I could legally work here since Jan due to receiving my Employment authorization document. So It's not a short process but totally do-able, especially if your SO can help support you while you wait for work documents.  If you need to PM me, please do, I will help answer as much as I can for you."
Bellingham,33g4tg,Jadeybear,0,Mon Apr 27 23:07:28 2015 UTC,"I did it the other way around (Bellingham to Vancouver) and after a bunch of research found that getting married to my SO was the easiest and quickest way to do it legally. The whole process took about 8 months and $2500, I did all the paperwork myself which saved a lot of money.   The US has a one-step process where you can apply from in the country, which might be an option for you if you can do without working for a few months. First you'd have to get a fiance visa and then apply for a change of status. The application fees alone are ~1500 at this point. If you have a car, you'll have to import it once you get your visa approved. It can be a very expensive process.  You also want to take into consideration that you'll be leaving a decent job market for a consistently terrible one.   edit: I don't know why I'm being downvoted. I'm certainly not suggesting that you marry solely for citizenship, if that's the problem. I assume if you want to leave your country in order to live with your girlfriend, your relationship is serious enough to consider marriage. ¯_(ツ)_/¯"

Yeah, there are a lot of douchebags at any big music festival, but the only reason a band like the Murder City Devils - an underground, relative no-name group - can play on the main stage at a festival as big as Sasquatch is because of the ""jocks"" who bought tickets to see the headliner.  Edit: Looks like I went and got myself some down votes for holding the opinion that artists shouldn't be assholes to the people they're performing for. I'd love to hear why that's okay.  Edit 2: Point of clarification - the ranter (Spencer Moody of - as I suspected - Murder City Devils, as a bit of research has turned up) was not responding to any jeering,  or asshole crowd behavior - he specifically and directly singled out a certain type of person - not individuals who had done something wrong, but an entire subset of the Sasquatch crowd - and lit into them, because of what they were wearing and what he assumed they must be like because of that. I've read a few articles, most notably in The Stranger, that framed him as some kind of brave, speaking-truth-to-power iconoclast, when, in reality, he was just drunk and singling out people who didn't fit the image of what he thought a crowd for one of their shows should look like."

Bellingham,32ymgm,experiencedaydreamer,-9,Wed Apr 22 02:00:17 2015 UTC,Or you know it could be our homeless youth who for whatever reason now all have dogs. They allow these dogs to poo anywhere they want. Sadly the poos are all soft and unhealthy. I feel bad for those pups.
Bellingham,32ymgm,wichschralpski,15,Fri Apr 17 23:06:33 2015 UTC,We find it highly unlikely that the number of dogs belonging to 'homeless youth' comes anywhere close to being a main contributor given the low number relative to the overall dog population.

There are far more sacks of dog droppings along than trail than I would expect to see if it wasn't a pervasive practice.  It really seems to be that a lot of dog owners just assume the parks service or some other concerned citizen will pick it up for them if they conveniently ""forget"" to grab it on the way back through or take another path back.

Bellingham,32ymgm,bpaige64,2,Sun May 3 14:57:33 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's been getting a lot worse lately. Last weekend I took my dog on a loop on the trails at Padden and I picked up four bags on the way out (plus the one I was carrying), some of which had clearly been on the trailside for days if not weeks. I've also seen them hiding in the grass in Broadway park.   I wonder if this might be an unintended consequence of the bag ban (which, don't get me wrong, I support), and the fact that purpose-made dog shit bags tend to be black or dark green and are much easier to overlook on the way out. It would be nice if these were required to be bright white or high-visibility orange instead of almost camouflage.   Aside from that, a little public shaming (like OP), a little education (like the mailers COB has been sending out) and maybe a few more trash cans could help (e.g. in the parking lot at Little Squalicum Park, which also tends to have a ton of non-dog-related litter strewn about)."

We always picked up after our 130lb greater swiss mix, and about 95% of the time we carried it with us the entire time.  If it was a lightly-used trail and we would be doubling back within the next 15 minutes or so, we'd leave it on the side of the trail bagged up and always grabbed it on the way back.  In some cases there weren't trash cans, so we'd roll the windows down and ride home with a bag of poop in the car.  At the same time though, I once left a large pile of cardboard recycling out on trash day and SSC left one behind for some reason.  When I picked it up, there was someone else's dog turd plastered to the bottom of it.

Our pets (and us) are too numerous to live in a system of natural balance. Instead, we try to mitigate the impact of our civilization by managing the byproducts of it. By processing waste we're able to reduce the impact it's raw form would have. It also allows us to control how the resulting material is reintroduced to the environment."
Bellingham,32ymgm,cosmoismyidol,2,Sat Apr 18 22:47:49 2015 UTC,"We don't live in the middle of nowhere, we live in a densely populated area. The number of people and dogs using the trail system is substantially more animals than would be in the area without trails, and the amount of feces that those dogs would leave is a far greater quantity than the wild animals that go through the area. All that extra poop is washed into our waterways. This issue is similar to people. If I go camping in the middle of nowhere and leave my feces, probably not a large impact on the surrounding area. But if Bellingham didn't have a sewer system and everyone was shitting anywhere they pleased or had shit canals like in 3rd world countries, we'd have a huge health crisis on our hands (and on our feet, and in our water, etc). Too many individuals require a regulated system of waste management."

The number of people and dogs using the trail system is substantially more animals than would be in the area without trails, and the amount of feces that those dogs would leave is a far greater quantity than the wild animals that go through the area. All that extra poop is washed into our waterways. This issue is similar to people. If I go camping in the middle of nowhere and leave my feces, probably not a large impact on the surrounding area. But if Bellingham didn't have a sewer system and everyone was shitting anywhere they pleased or had shit canals like in 3rd world countries, we'd have a huge health crisis on our hands (and on our feet, and in our water, etc). Too many individuals require a regulated system of waste management."

She tells it like it is, which I find it refreshing. If you have the right sense of humor, she's actually quite funny. They don't skimp on the drugs and the staff has always gone above and beyond any dental office I've been a patient with. She does have a very ridiculous portrait in the waiting room of herself and her two massive dogs and her staff only refer to her as ""Doctor""..They're is definitely an ego on this Dentist but hey, she gets the job done and theirs always a few laughs involved."

He's really nice, tech-savvy, and lets you watch whatever you want on the ceiling TV (he has netflix).  He's the only doctor there though, so you may need some advanced notice.  Although if it's an emergency, you can usually get in within a day or two.

Bellingham,32hsz7,kornholyoyo,-12,Tue Apr 14 12:41:20 2015 UTC,yeah ok.. prove it. oh endowments don't count right?
Bellingham,32hsz7,Codetornado,10,Tue Apr 14 13:24:15 2015 UTC,"Seriously... this is not hard. Non-profits must take all their money and spend it back into the institution.  For profits can do whatever they want. Non-profits have a board that decides the financial matters of the entity. As a state non-profit entity most of the money coming into the school is determined by the state legislature to the tune of tuition levels and tax funds directed to the entity. So it is an entity whose fiances are controlled by the public. Any extra money generated is either turned back into the entity itself or back to the state.  So by the very definition of endowments they would count as you can only give endowments to a non-profit. Charter can't get endowments. They can get gifts, donations, etc, but not endowments.  Charter can not receive endowments as it is a for profit institution.   I don't know what your problem is with the other school, but charter is not a good institution.   Look at all the reviews. here here here here here Here Here here"
Bellingham,32hsz7,kornholyoyo,-12,Tue Apr 14 13:56:32 2015 UTC,"I am not defending charter. I am laughing at your inability to distinguish state schools from being the same. State schools are run for profit and are run just as poorly. Over paid from the executives on down, yet they still raise tuition and fees every year. Pretty much a for profit style."
Bellingham,32hsz7,Codetornado,5,Tue Apr 14 15:19:21 2015 UTC,"""I am laughing at your inability to distinguish state schools from being the same. State schools are run for profit and are run just as poorly.""  What is their profit? No one get paid extra if they generate extra income this year. In fact generating too much money will reduce funding from the state the following funding cycle. Budget floors, state funding, and tuition are set by the legislature. If there is extra funding it can be distributed as seen fit by the Board of Trustees selected by the Governor. This is all open and public. Finances, salaries, and all spending is public. You can go find all the salaries, budget, and funds raised and spent. Private entities don't have to do that.  So what I've learned here is that you want your personal opinion to be fact, but it isn't. Those schools are both public and non-profit. I can't argue with your logic. It gets twisted to fit your personal agenda."

Bellingham,32howx,stoosepp,2,Mon Apr 13 21:56:19 2015 UTC,"I've used the heated self storage up on King St, by I-5, a few years ago. Reasonable prices, good location. I think I had a 20x20ish unit for $60/mo? I fit all my junk in there (enough to fully kit out a normal apartment), as well as my roommate's stuff.  Did the same out at Hinotes - E Pole Rd & Hannegan, no problems. Don't remember rates at Hinotes, as it was something like a decade ago."

Bellingham,32edhz,nicksatdown,16,Mon Apr 13 02:34:37 2015 UTC,Wander brewery is my favorite right now. They have a rotating food truck there almost everyday. They always have good beer.
Bellingham,32edhz,tatiotonka,3,Mon Apr 13 03:12:54 2015 UTC,I've never heard of Wander brewery!  I'll have to check it out!  Thank you.

Bellingham,32edhz,tatiotonka,2,Mon Apr 13 07:41:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed - Wander is top on my list.   Had a couple of less than stellar pints at Kulshan earlier this year, but they seem to be back to normal again. Hoping it was just some distraction due to the new expansion operation.  I also don't hate Aslan. Food, service, and atmosphere have been solid for us."

Bellingham,32edhz,azaydius,14,Mon Apr 13 18:40:41 2015 UTC,"Elizabeth Station isn't a brewery, but it is very much worth a visit.  Or ten."
Bellingham,32edhz,h22keisuke,4,Mon Apr 13 03:35:19 2015 UTC,"Wander and Kulshan are the best. Chuckanut sells a lot of very solid, clean and light beers but isn't amazing otherwise (still worth a taste if you like kolschs or pilsners). The north fork out in the county on the way to maple falls is awesome too, and good pizza.   I'm not a fan of boundary or aslan. Boundary's beers taste a little too heavy and overdone to me, like they're pumping up the alcohol with filler. Aslan's beers just plain taste bad and their food is only mediocre (I ate there, ordered the curry, and was given nearly raw vegetables with the curry sauce on them. Waffle fries are, and I can say this conclusively, sysco pre-bagged and then underfried).  Go see Wander especially if I had to pick. Those guys are great and so's their beer."
Bellingham,32edhz,meta474,5,Mon Apr 13 15:33:52 2015 UTC,Why not try them all out? Here is a handy guide & way to keep track... http://www.bellinghamtaptrail.com/
Bellingham,32edhz,ThursdayNotes,9,Mon Apr 13 16:37:26 2015 UTC,"I'm new in town, but I've been to pretty much every brewery by now, here is a summary of a few of the most popular ones:    Boundary Bay - One of the largest production and best known Bellingham beers.  Has an awesome deck.  Order a scotch ale and a bowl of Mac and cheese  Kulshan - Great beer, laid back taproom.  This is my personal favorite selection of beers.  The taproom does not serve food, but allows you to bring in carry out or order a pizza.  There is also a rotation of food trucks that serve food just outside.  Grab a Pizza at Coconut Kennys and bring it in so you can drink a Bastard Cat IPA with it.  Aslan - All organic beers, ""Bellingham style"" brewery.  If you want a slightly hippy brewery with communal tables, water served in mason jars and ambient music this is a good pick.  They have a huge variety of food selections, but most are on the finger food and appetizer side of things.  Seasonal beer experiments are varying and high quality.  Order a Dawn Patrol and a bowl of Waffle Fry Poutine.  Chuckanut - Easily the best Pilsners in town.  These guys specialize in German styles and they don't bother with dressing their beer up with fancy names or descriptions. Order a Kolsch and a Reuben Sandwhich"
Bellingham,32edhz,disastrophy,5,Mon Apr 13 02:50:57 2015 UTC,"You are definitely right about Chuckanut Pils being awesome. Their food has not been great in my experience though.  Boundary is legendary but it's definitely not the only game in town.   Aslan beer sucks. Great taproom but the beer is not good. I've sampled everything and while 1-2 beers are ok, the whole operation just feels like it's trying too hard.   Kulshan offers up some honest good beer and a great scene. Definitely check it out.  Wander is my favorite brewery. They do everything very well and offer up some unique brews like Saison, one of my personal favorites. It's small and still kinda secret somehow.  Elizabeth Station isn't a brewery but it's beer Mecca in Bellingham. Definitely spend some time there."
Bellingham,32edhz,zardozzardoz,9,Mon Apr 13 06:06:49 2015 UTC,"Just in my opinion (and friends of mine), Aslan isn't that great of a brewery.  I wish it was but it has consistently been a disappointment.  I do love Boundary and Kulshan.  Not a local brewery but I'd say Schweinhaus is a great place to get beer by the liter, great brats, kraut, and pretzels from the local Bavarian bakery."
Bellingham,32edhz,mrscoggins,5,Mon Apr 13 04:43:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think they are on par with the best breweries in the beer department, but I wouldn't go so far as to say they are disappointing.  They seem to try too hard to have unique seasonals when they should be focusing their efforts on creating a solid regular taplist (of which I'd say only 2 of their regular beers are above mediocre).    But Aslan has had consistently good food on my visits and enough varieties of beer to make visiting worthwhile.  They have a very different atmosphere than the other places I listed that appeals more to some than others, and I think that helps to make them a valuable asset to the micro community up here.  I don't expect to see their beer breaking out nationally, but I think anybody who wants to experience the Bellingham beer scene should visit and form their own opinion"
Bellingham,32edhz,disastrophy,2,Mon Apr 13 05:49:20 2015 UTC,I'd go so far as to say they were disappointing.
Bellingham,32edhz,meta474,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:29:35 2015 UTC,"Been back recently?  They are always experimenting and have put out a few beers that are pretty decent.  The fact that they are consistently busy shows that there are a lot of people who disagree with you.  The rock fish tacos are the shit. (The Dawn Patrol mentioned by the original comment in this thread is pretty good, probably my favorite they have produced so far)."
Bellingham,32edhz,azaydius,2,Mon Apr 13 18:37:39 2015 UTC,Business does not necessarily indicate quality over the short term. I went twice this past summer and fall but haven't been back since. Too many competitors. If it sticks around I'll give it another shot eventually.

Bellingham,32edhz,azaydius,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:39:35 2015 UTC,The ambiance is more enjoyable than their product.
Bellingham,32edhz,wichschralpski,4,Mon Apr 13 19:56:29 2015 UTC,"Also, if you heard out towards Mt. Baker, do check out Northfork / Beer Shrine. Had some solid sours there right after Christmas and the pizza is good.  McKay's tap room has a great selection of taps and features breweries from time to time. Sometimes you can get several year's worth of special vintage beers, like bourbon barrel aged stout, etc."
Bellingham,32edhz,tenthjuror,5,Mon Apr 13 14:58:52 2015 UTC,"Cool. So breweries. Aslan. Boundary Bay. Chuckanut. Gruff. Kulshan. Menace. North Fork. Stone's Throw. Wander.   Wander. They focus on beer and do a damn good job of it. Belgians, Wee-heavy, porters.  Chuckanut. ""Retired"" brew master who still loves making beer. Pilsners, kolschs, lagers.  Kulshan. First microbrewery of the new era. IPAs, reds, seasonals.  Menace. Tap room is the local. Some of the best food in town. Beer they serve some of theirs in addition to plenty more Cascadian brews.   North Fork. Pizza joint. Worth the drive which is saying something. ESBs, Brandywines.  Boundary Bay. The only brewery in town for 30+ years. Unfiltered style. IPAs, Scotch, Hangovers.  Gruff. Not open.  Stone's Throw. Not open?  Aslan. They started brewing for the first time ever 2 years ago. Their kitchen is better than their beer, but that doesn't say much. They are constantly improving. Organic beer.  I ordered these in my preference for quality of beer. Overall experience I prefer The Local--Menace because of the food and vibe plus being right downtown. Wander and Kulshan are close seconds as their beer is the best in town and they have a really cool relaxed vibe. Wander allows dogs. Kulshan outgrew their space but luckily is close to opening a second location. Chuckanut makes great beer, but I don't prefer the style in which they focus. Try everything.   April Brew's Day is coming up and that's a great chance to try everything local and more all in one stop."

Bellingham,32edhz,MajorDefault,2,Tue Apr 14 05:11:28 2015 UTC,"They have been slowly renovating the building on E Maple st, pretty much right across the street from Boundary.  If you walk down the alley from Boundary's beer garden to E Maple St, Gruff's building is right in front of you.  I haven't heard anything definitive on when they plan to open, only rumors at this point.  I really enjoyed their beer at April Brew's Day last year too and have been anxiously awaiting their opening.  Was hoping to see them at April Brew's Day this year and get some info, but they currently aren't on the confirmed brewers list, http://www.maxhigbee.org/2015-confirmed-brewers.html"
Bellingham,32edhz,azaydius,3,Tue Apr 14 17:30:27 2015 UTC,I don't see The Local mentioned here yet.  They are the tap house for Menace Brewing (based in Ferndale).  They also feature micros from other local and PNW based breweries.  Their food is pretty darn good too.

Bellingham,32edhz,Dynamosaur,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:39:47 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a lot of Aslan hate going on. 6 months ago, I would have agreed. They recently came out with the Batch 15 ipa, which is their new flagship, and a very solid beer. But after trying the sour brown, I bought a t-shirt.    Seriously, try the sour brown. The rest of their brews are coming along nicely as well.    While Kulshan and Wander are definitely at the top of my list, I can enjoy brews from any of our local breweries. And when it comes to the owners and staff of said breweries, there isn't any hate going on in our beer community.    Side note, head to The Local to try Menace brewing out of Ferndale. Ben makes some great beer!"
Bellingham,32edhz,iLaughAtYourFart,2,Mon Apr 13 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"I'm friends with Ben from Menace and the guys at Aslan so I might be biased, but I love their beers and I believe they're doing it right being organic and local. I love the support that Bellingham gives."
Bellingham,32edhz,Dynamosaur,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:41:07 2015 UTC,"The only thing I am biased about is they have awesome shirts and I still agree with you.  Their beer is not terrible, it is not the best either, but what they are doing is commendable and I'm glad all this hate I keep hearing hasn't seemed to slow them down.  I fear it might make it more difficult for them to sell their beers out of town, but all it takes is one awesome hit beer to break through that stigma I think."
Bellingham,32edhz,azaydius,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:32:55 2015 UTC,"A lot of Aslan criticism in here.  I first went there when they opened and it was fucking TERRIBLE.  The beer couldn't even be loosely called drinkable.  HOWEVER, after a lot of feedback from other local brewers and some big changes, they got their shit together and their beer is actually pretty good now."

How much of the revenue is eligible for the Exclusion?
