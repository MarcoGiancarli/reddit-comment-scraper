MyPeopleNeedMe,3dwgmv,OriginalPostSearcher,8,Mon Jul 20 04:09:55 2015 UTC,Thanks!
MyPeopleNeedMe,3dwgmv,Tominator2001,8,Mon Jul 20 04:48:47 2015 UTC,That's some fancy footwork and incredible aim. Good job!
MyPeopleNeedMe,3dwgmv,mattcushing,7,Mon Jul 20 12:16:22 2015 UTC,what game is that?  Looks like fun :)
MyPeopleNeedMe,3dwgmv,cheecid,8,Mon Jul 20 13:02:21 2015 UTC,Team Fortress 2 - it's free on Steam! http://www.teamfortress.com/
MyPeopleNeedMe,3dwgmv,willyscoot,3,Mon Jul 20 14:04:05 2015 UTC,One of my favorite FPS on steam. Because it's cartoony but not a minecraft ripoff
MyPeopleNeedMe,3dwgmv,blumpkinblake,3,Mon Jul 20 16:09:12 2015 UTC,Tf2 was there before Minecraft
MyPeopleNeedMe,3dwgmv,willyscoot,0,Tue Jul 21 02:59:39 2015 UTC,I know. But if you're looking for a FPS that's any way cartoony. You get minecraft ripoff shooters
MyPeopleNeedMe,3dwgmv,Patrik333,3,Tue Jul 21 03:13:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely check it out - it's an amazing game. I'm pretty casual but even so, I managed to spend 1000+ hours in it already... I play it for a month or so, get bored, but then always end up coming back to it. Plus, it's pretty newb friendly - unless you show no signs of wanting to improve, 90% of players are forgiving of you, and you can just pick Pyro or Soldier as pretty newb friendly options until you get what's going on a bit more."

MyPeopleNeedMe,3ds7mc,Whitellama,8,Sun Jul 19 03:32:11 2015 UTC,Gameplay from the forest.
MyPeopleNeedMe,3ds7mc,zakk002,3,Sun Jul 19 04:49:39 2015 UTC,What is this from?
MyPeopleNeedMe,3ds7mc,AngelGroove,7,Sun Jul 19 02:24:06 2015 UTC,The forest.
MyPeopleNeedMe,3ds7mc,theek,4,Sun Jul 19 02:43:47 2015 UTC,How does that stack up to the seemingly dozens of other early access survival games? It looks interesting but unpolished.
MyPeopleNeedMe,3ds7mc,AngelGroove,3,Sun Jul 19 02:55:47 2015 UTC,"I've been following it for a year or so now, and I haven't yet bought it, but I think you described it perfectly. It's an interesting game that might be good when its out but is really unpolished and needs a lot of work."
MyPeopleNeedMe,3ds7mc,joeytman,3,Sun Jul 19 03:05:43 2015 UTC,You hit the nail on the head. If it becomes a full polished product I have no doubt it could stand on its own. http://youtu.be/76dHkDhOZ04

MyPeopleNeedMe,3dmz7h,Nakataaaa,84,Fri Jul 17 16:13:03 2015 UTC,Damn this game looks more dated than in memory

MyPeopleNeedMe,3dmz7h,Evil_Disco_Marmot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:37:56 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd say it looks better than Most Wanted (2005).

MyPeopleNeedMe,3dmz7h,Sadukar09,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:21:59 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look that bad. Still not as good as in memory though, but with a texture mod it actually looks pretty nice considering the age."

MyPeopleNeedMe,3ccbra,umibozu,6,Mon Jul 6 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"Actually...that is not what bothers me. I have to actually recall a time I was in 5th grade and my mom took us snorkeling off the coast of one of the keys. I actually had a great time doing that with no issues of fear. What does bother me is what I assume is mostly due to a gross ignorance as to how currents near the shore work, bc I am severely terrified of being dragged out by some sinister current and getting the shit beaten out of me by relentless waves. The occupants of the ocean are a pretty low terror tier in comparison to the fluctuations of the tide. Haha now I am thinking of all the times I even remotely thought the tide was coming in and had awful visions of being swept up and away, never to be seen again. Oh how I would scream lol."
MyPeopleNeedMe,3ccbra,daftne,10,Mon Jul 6 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"Currents can either drag you into the sea or towards the shore. If the latter... no problem. If they drag you out to sea... never, ever fight it. You will lose and you will drown.   Swim sideways, parallel to the shoreline until the current abates (you'll feel it).

My parents laughed at me when I asked to learn how to swim, my schoolmates bullied me when I trained holding my breath. ""You're just a building"" they said. ""You were born to be stationary on land, not moving underwater"" they said; but armed with my playlist of Beatles songs I was determined to prove them all wrong. One day the tide came in, all the way in, and I saw my chance.  I may have only been a submarine of a second before I collapsed. But that was the best second of my life."
