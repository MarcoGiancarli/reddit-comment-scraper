catvideos,3d9ine,VerGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:38:05 2015 UTC,When you do the shell game you usually don't want to use different colors for each of them. I taught my cats how to do it and they hustle pounds of catnip every day.
catvideos,3d9ine,yaosio,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:02:22 2015 UTC,"Well, shouldn't the caps all be the same colour? you could re-arrange those 3 colours for hours, with the cat blindfolded during so, but ultimately it will still know what cap/colour you showed you put it under at first."
