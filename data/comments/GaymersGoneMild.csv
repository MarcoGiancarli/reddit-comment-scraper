GaymersGoneMild,3e1ihj,hobz462,3,Tue Jul 21 06:09:52 2015 UTC,I admit I find the fake head on the table a little disconcerting.
GaymersGoneMild,3e1ihj,raosion,3,Tue Jul 21 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"Dear god I had to look again, and only then did I realize that's not a third person stretching to get in the picture."
GaymersGoneMild,3e1ihj,luminositte,2,Tue Jul 21 18:02:27 2015 UTC,"I know, right?!"
GaymersGoneMild,3e1ihj,raosion,2,Tue Jul 21 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"I must find this bar.... Although, I'd be thrown out eventually or given a standing ovation lol."
GaymersGoneMild,3e1ihj,AdenJames,5,Tue Jul 21 07:29:21 2015 UTC,I don't know... The nurse waitress said we were a bit too gentle with our toys though.

GaymersGoneMild,3dxhlp,saturnhillinger,2,Mon Jul 20 20:51:04 2015 UTC,"well, you have my blessing, at least."

GaymersGoneMild,3dxhlp,PM_ME_YOUR_BLUESTUFF,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:59:07 2015 UTC,Too late you've already given your blessing for me to wear it.
GaymersGoneMild,3dxvu0,RecurvBow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:56:33 2015 UTC,"Yep, been there, done that. It's not fun. XD  I was wearing sunblock but didn't do something right (outdated? too little? too late?) *shrug*"
GaymersGoneMild,3dxvu0,zimzat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:53 2015 UTC,"AHHHH!  I put sunblock on yesterday too, but I guess after 4 hours in a pool you're supposed to reapply or something? I dont know. The beer probably didnt help..."
GaymersGoneMild,3dxvu0,zimzat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:10:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's every two hours and at least 15 minutes before going into the sun. I violated both of those when this picture was taken (last August on a beach) though I still suspect the sunscreen I had was outdated even if it didn't have a expiration date on it.  I got new sunscreen for the next times I went into the sun and it didn't get as bad, thankfully."
GaymersGoneMild,3dvl03,ezelus,2,Sun Jul 19 22:04:40 2015 UTC,You should take more! You're so handsome!
