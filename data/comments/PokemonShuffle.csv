PokemonShuffle,3e6ikz,blaziken8x,2,Wed Jul 22 09:43:29 2015 UTC,I'm just going to wait until the C-1 week (which is I think in 2 or 3 weeks time).
PokemonShuffle,3e6ikz,star_tale,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:17:50 2015 UTC,Yeah there's zero point in spending coins on a great ball. In a few weeks you'll have every item for free to use over and over...
PokemonShuffle,3e6ikz,pagit85,2,Wed Jul 22 15:52:52 2015 UTC,"Wait for the super catch power or whatever it is called and then use the Great Ball. Caught him this way at 59%. Also you can shut the game down when GB fails, you'll get the coins back that way."
PokemonShuffle,3e6ikz,heartslikeours,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:58:30 2015 UTC,I thought it saves the second you use coins?
PokemonShuffle,3e6ikz,RasmusSW,4,Wed Jul 22 10:30:02 2015 UTC,"No, but it does when you use gems"
PokemonShuffle,3e6ikz,The4drian,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:44:50 2015 UTC,"The game saves whenever you spend gema/money with the only exception of the GreatBall purchase, that is saved on the results screen. So if you exit the game before that you can get your coins back"
PokemonShuffle,3e6ikz,KamuKid,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:13:06 2015 UTC,"You'll get more items to ""experience"" every monday so the chances of you catching it later will be higher since there will be more turns left, but yeah I've attempted to capture it at least 20 times with at least 20 fails :("
PokemonShuffle,3e6ikz,valedictions,-1,Wed Jul 22 11:09:07 2015 UTC,"with a base capture of 1% and a move capture of 1%, its not even really worth trying to get the most amount of moves left over. you really just want to wait for a super catch plus and forfeit the 2500 imo (or just get lucky otherwise)"
PokemonShuffle,3e6ikz,dude_guy_bro_man,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:09:32 2015 UTC,It took me about 20 tries and 3 great balls (all after super catch power) to finally nab him. Every super catch failed.  I randomly got him at 7%. I know I could have waited but meh.

PokemonShuffle,3e6n3y,ddollas,2,Wed Jul 22 10:44:57 2015 UTC,"Yes the increase attack power will essentially double your score. As far as complexity -1, I imagine that it removes the stage's 5th pokemon. I forget who it is but it seemed necessary to use off you want to use tyranitar, since it has a similar color (to my eye, anyways)."
PokemonShuffle,3e6n3y,dude_guy_bro_man,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:21:20 2015 UTC,"Ninetails if I recall, which was really easily confused with Tyranitar for me when scanning that fast in a timed stage."
PokemonShuffle,3e4fsp,Stokos,3,Tue Jul 21 21:47:11 2015 UTC,"I'm going with Aurorus & Kyogre. I like hitting streak since it's a timed level and Aurorus is pretty distinctive-looking. I imagine anyone but Regirock, Excadrill, and Suicune would be good. I'd consider using Greninja if I had him, but I like abilities with reliable triggers. Though if you're lucky, unlike me, Swap+ would be pretty sweet."
PokemonShuffle,3e4fsp,AQuantumCat,2,Tue Jul 21 22:03:39 2015 UTC,I'm definitely rocking Groudon Milotic and Kyogre when I do my run. For the mega it'll be Gengar or Blastoise.
PokemonShuffle,3e4fsp,giraffe196,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:03 2015 UTC,I do not recommend Mega Blastoise. A lot of time wasted waiting for the combo-less fall.
PokemonShuffle,3e4fsp,kelelawar,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:59:51 2015 UTC,Groudon and Swampert. The goal is to trigger quake and hitting streak and then rack up the combos!
PokemonShuffle,3e4fsp,DrWeeGee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:40:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think it matters too much which one you pick, but I would go with Swampert or Aurorus because of their abilities.  I trained a bunch of these guys but the Swap+ and Stabilize+ abilities are NOT especially useful in the Blaziken competition level, even though they are amazing abilities in general.  The damage streak or hitting streak abilities will be much more useful to the ultimate goal of scoring high.  BTW, for Mega Blaziken ranking info for ppl out there:  One system scored 26500 and is ranked about 2600. The other scored 32600 and is ranked at about 2000.    The teams I used were varied, but high level. (one used blastoise, one used gengar). I'm fairly confident these scores will stay in the top 6000, though obviously I'll check Sunday."
PokemonShuffle,3e4fsp,chadwarmile,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:12:45 2015 UTC,"In EU i got about 11k score and I think that put me in rank 15,000, Only about 37,000 people have submitted a score so far.  I used gengar - tyrantar - Auroras - Groudon all around lv 5-6 no items  I know there are 4-5 days left but its looking like anyone who uses items is going to place high enough,  Unless everyone is focusing on the other event and leaving this till the last day."
PokemonShuffle,3e4fsp,02pheland,0,Wed Jul 22 07:52:40 2015 UTC,"I wish I could be more helpful, but my Mega Slowbro (6)/Aurorus (2)/Donphan (3)/Sudowoodo (1) team got me a solid 32k with all items, which is about 2100th place right now. Just having 70s in general will probably get you a good enough for the top 6000 (assuming you're in NA, that is, otherwise, I figure you're still pretty safe)."
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,markhawker,6,Tue Jul 21 20:18:22 2015 UTC,"im honestly surprised how easy this escalation battle is  giratina past level 40 was actually challenging, and then giratinas level 50 was equal to a great challenge  havent needed to use a single item for cresselia, and i must have had great luck considering i finished level 50 with around 8 turns left still."
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,valedictions,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:07:28 2015 UTC,"However, I expect that'll change after Lv.160 so that's why I'm canvassing opinions!"
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,eggstacy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:11:54 2015 UTC,did the last escalation battle get easier on 51 also? I'm breezing through the 70s on this one and feeling like i shouldve tried 100 last time now =(
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,Eagleby18,2,Wed Jul 22 08:21:19 2015 UTC,"No don't worry, last time 100 was only an option if you were a hacker or had 99,999 coins and were willing to spend ALL of them."
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,Herbas_,3,Wed Jul 22 11:39:33 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on getting that far already. I'm wondering when it gets necessary to get items to win. I'm on 56 using mega bannete, giratina, weavile and genesect"
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,giraffe196,2,Tue Jul 21 20:26:59 2015 UTC,"No congratulations necessary, honestly. I was able to buy 38 hearts from free jewels and had hearts stored up! Others that are around this point and beyond are (almost certainly) exploiting Homepass or have bought jewels and exchanged them for hearts.  So far, I've not used items apart from Lv.50 and Lv.100, which required items to complete. Attack Power Up, in particular for Lv.100.  I'm using Mega Gengar and Yveltal instead of Weavile in comparison to your setup. All are MAX. Whenever I get a chance to match 4+ Giratina or 4+ Genesect I do that as their abilities usually equate to 600+ damage each time. Otherwise you shouldn't have much of a problem getting to Lv.100 if you're a reasonably good player."
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,Paralykeet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:09 2015 UTC,This is really good to know! I'm at 46 right now and only planned to keep going if I didn't need to use items (I want those coins levels lol). I have the same team as you except I have scizor instead of genesect and levels range from 8-max except Yveltal is 6.
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,Herbas_,2,Tue Jul 21 20:38:48 2015 UTC,"You'll need them at Lv.50 and then I haven't used items until Lv.100. After Lv.50 it is, at least in my experience, easier than before Lv.50 although you may still get a board or two that are just painful. Just take the loss and then try again!"
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,P-Delta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:55 2015 UTC,I replaced Yveltal with Heracross which might be better because crowd control is such an insane ability. Yveltal's power of 5 just doesn't seem good enough.
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,Herbas_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:26:34 2015 UTC,"You could be right. I only have Heracross at Lv.5, though, so there's like a 20 difference in attack between them. But, could be better in the long run!"
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,DBrody6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:39:35 2015 UTC,"Great news. I think mega banette is better than gengar since he does great damage once evolved and has mega boost. Banette is good to remove ice blocks aswell, in my case it removes all the giratina and give me combos with genesect and weavile"
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,chadwarmile,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:39:21 2015 UTC,not a fan of m-banette precisely because he removes giratina. a lv10 giratina = 900 damage off power of 4+. that's a lot to give up by triggering m-banette
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,DBrody6,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:02:55 2015 UTC,"You may be right, but genesect is more reliable to trigger, due to 100% activation on 4 or 5 matches + less giratinas on the board (plus you still trigger giratina at the beginning and even eventually after mega banette)"
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,chadwarmile,2,Wed Jul 22 09:18:33 2015 UTC,"On another forum someone has reached Lv. 161 and has described it as obscenely frustrating. He's wasted over 10K coins on various item combinations in an effort to find the cheapest means of reliably beating it.   +5 turns/DD/Attack+ seems to be the most reliable but is also incredibly expensive (5300 coins per level, and over 200K just to reach level 200!), to say nothing of the items needed for Lv. 200 which jacks the difficulty even higher.   Since the speedups are at 100 and 200, only spend time going for 200 if you're willing to dump tens of thousands of coins (or an absurd number of hearts) into going all the way. There's no pity reward for reaching 161 and then getting walled. Combo ruining Solosis, tons of disruptions, and Cresselia's HP begins feeling really bloated at 161 so it honestly seems that stopping at 100 is best for your sanity. But if you've got the coins...there's nothing stopping you from hitting 200."
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,TheLightdarker,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:40:32 2015 UTC,"Did he mention if he tried using Mewtwo to clear the Solosis disruptions?  Thanks for all this info, btw -- super useful"
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,TheLightdarker,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"Mega Mewtwo? That's NVE against Cresselia, plus has an absurdly long evolution time. Cresselia is sporting 20K HP at this point, so you outright need Mega Gengar to get enough damage and combos in. The Soloisis's, as an annoyance as they are, still have Barrier Bash which partially excuses their appearance. But the team you've used for the past 160 levels still won't be changing."
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,icravedanger,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:09:29 2015 UTC,"Good point. I was just curious, I'm not saying it would be an effective strategy, but if the Solosis disruptions really do slow it down much, a Mega Mewtwo would help clear them out. (Even if it's NVE, he clears out a whopping 10 psychic types, that's just overpowered).   I don't think I'll even make it to level 161 to try it"
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,DBrody6,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:55:22 2015 UTC,I'm thinking of aiming for Lv.161 and then confirming whether that's the case! If it is then I'll be stopping and will report back. Always hard to make judgments on others' runs as depends on how good they are!
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,icravedanger,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:56:22 2015 UTC,"Very interesting information, and how tragic. Just when I was going to applaud the development team for making this less frustrating than Giratina! Currently on stage 95, and I haven't even bothered using ShuffleMove since 50 - and I've never used a single DD, which is a stark contrast to Giratina. But, if I'm going to hit a huge, frustrating wall at 161 - especially considering that I'm too indecisive to actually use any mega speed-ups - maybe I won't bother after all. Hmm."
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,DBrody6,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:54:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting to note:  If you buy jewels at the ""best rate"" (i.e., 75 for $48), every 48,000 coins is $6.25 - and if stages 161 to 200 takes 5,300 coins per attempt to reliably pass, you're at best looking at spending the equivalent of $27.60 on coins, if you don't farm any, to get one silly mega-speed-up. Considering just how many mega pokemon there are - and that some, like Ampharos, can accept 7 of them - I'm thinking aiming for 200 is a pretty silly endeavor after all (at least, for myself)."
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,icravedanger,-1,Wed Jul 22 15:11:50 2015 UTC,"He's wasted over 10K coins on various item combinations   Over 10,000 coins?! How will he ever earn that many coins back?"
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,Tjgalon,3,Wed Jul 22 01:40:17 2015 UTC,"10000 coins across various attempts, all failures, on a single level, isn't the worst thing in the world. And that wasn't the point.  You're spending a ton of coins for 40 consecutive levels. Even with hardcore Meowth powerfarming, accumulating all the coins necessary to reliably go from 161 to 200, to say nothing of actually successfully beating every stage first try, is the difficult part. Anybody can farm coins. Not anywhere close to everyone can farm that many in the 11 days Cresselia is available. Most people could probably do it in 8-9 days, which realistically only leaves two days worth of attempts at actually beating those 40 levels. Unless, of course, you fork over a shitton of jewels."
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,Shepdawg1,2,Wed Jul 22 01:52:06 2015 UTC,"Just because the devs put a prize behind level 200 of a freemium game doesn't mean you have to earn it. NSMB2 gives you a bonus title screen if you collect 9,999,999 coins, which obviously isn't worth the effort. Don't forget that the goal of Shuffle is to make money from microtransactions. If you don't want to pay, just forget about the last piece of candy. It's not worth losing sleep over."
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,TracingLines,2,Wed Jul 22 02:11:45 2015 UTC,I don't understand what you're trying to argue? I'm just saying that the 161-200 stretch is completely ridiculous and most people would be crazy to try it. I never implied I was going to waste time and effort to go for it; I'll be quite content just hitting 100.   I'm just flat out saying that 161+ is completely absurd and is weighted heavily towards getting people to pay for jewels since farming alone will barely cover the necessary costs to beat the levels.
PokemonShuffle,3e43be,SoftwareJunkie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:18:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, then that's something we can agree on. Leave those levels to the rich people and hackers."

PokemonShuffle,3e43be,TameFlame,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:23:57 2015 UTC,There's a trade-off between losing a few times and just buying an item and then earning the money back from Meowth. All about the numbers!

Just keep going for Crowd Control and Power of 4+. Mega Gengar will build up enough on screen to combo itself away, and if you don't deal with the ice disruptions immediately, I noticed they tend to stay localized to just one side."

PokemonShuffle,3e70xd,SmokeontheHorizon,-1,Wed Jul 22 14:48:23 2015 UTC,How pathetic do you have to be to look for exploits and cheats for a game that involves making matches of three? It's literally one digit easier than Connect Four.
PokemonShuffle,3e1hcc,Herbas_,13,Tue Jul 21 05:56:42 2015 UTC,"When level 35 started, I saw the board and was thoroughly confused. 5 seconds later I finally look up at the top screen to confirm that I had indeed selected the Cresselia stage, and not some Meowth level from the Twilight Zone.  I was in a hypnotic state just matching coins until 2 moves left, when I snapped back to reality and realized that if I didn't finish off Cresselia, I wouldn't get any of those coins."
PokemonShuffle,3e1hcc,icravedanger,7,Tue Jul 21 06:53:40 2015 UTC,I got around 1430 coins without using any items so I don't think it's worth wasting move+5 on this one as it spawns only 2 coins per turn.
PokemonShuffle,3e1hcc,zero2exe,2,Tue Jul 21 06:25:09 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly it starts with more than 2 coins per turn. It's important to notice that you get more coins EVERY turn and you generally won't get to match all the coins on the board before killing it, making it easy to profit on those extra moves"
PokemonShuffle,3e1hcc,zero2exe,5,Tue Jul 21 06:45:40 2015 UTC,By the time I reached move 10 I only had around 6 coins left on the board. Move+5 costs 800 coins which would spawn 10 extra coins (assuming they don't overlap with an existing one that is). You would need some luck to not only match them all by the end of the stage but also get at least two 4-matches just to call it even with what you spent.
PokemonShuffle,3e1hcc,TheLightdarker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:55:54 2015 UTC,"Using ShuffeMove for ""combos,"" and not paying much (any) attention to how quickly I beat the stage (I used my optimized, max-level super effective team), I got 730 coins from stage 35. I thought it might work like the weekend Meowth, where you get additional coins spawned based on combos - but not so much, apparently! Anyhow, I never saw Cresselia generate more than 1 additional coin per round, so it doesn't seem like this stage has that much coin generation potential... but still. A nice change of pace!"

Keep a few super-effective in the mix.  I tried all weak Quirky+ and Quirky with a +5 moves and ended up unable to beat Cresselia. :(
PokemonShuffle,3e1hcc,ReddJor,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:59 2015 UTC,"I wish I saw this like 5mins ago. I still managed to rack in about 730 coins, but Had I prepared myself I'm sure I could have made double."
PokemonShuffle,3e1hcc,Tjgalon,2,Tue Jul 21 15:01:10 2015 UTC,"Guys, just finished level 55. It was even easier than 35 for me, so be sure to bring weaker pokemon! I beat it too fast to take advantage of the free +5 moves I had"
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,KamuKid,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"I'm using a M. Banette ghost team and only used items to beat lv 50 so far (at lv 53). Tell me how you do at lv 50, this could potentially save me some coins when I reach lv 100."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,KurikuShot,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:34 2015 UTC,"Banette is too slow to mega evolve and unpredictable (you don't know which mon it's gonna erase), so it's hard to determine a good move for potential combos. Have you tried M-Gengar?"
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,JetLagoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:52 2015 UTC,"I find M Banette to hit a lot harder than M Gengar. M Gengar tends to have fairly weak subsequent combos after the first one, M Banette keeps on giving if you take a 3 ghost team. Banette doesnt actually take all too long to mega if you take care to activate Mega boost.   I use M Banette/Gengar/Giratina/Genesect"
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,sleepslacksnooze,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:05:37 2015 UTC,"M-Gengar theoretically and practically gives longer combo chains than M-Banette. We know that on the board, mega evolved mons are rarer than other mons, so let's say a 3-match from 7 M-Banette erases all 9 Giratina on the board, other mons and Giratina will drop soon right after to fill the empty tiles, thus the complexity is still 4. The case is not so with M-Gengar who actually reduce complexity for a while after they destroy themselves."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,JetLagoon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:44:50 2015 UTC,"If you are going to argue the point about lower spawn rate of megas, then I could also say that Mbanette clears one species and itself(because it doesnt spawn much), giving you C-1.5!  My gripe with Mgengar is that after the first hit, in subsequent turns you only have a sparse few Gengar concentrated at the top and you might not be able to use it to trigger a big combo. Mbanette doesnt have that problem because there is always something for it to clear and trigger combos.  When Mbanette is quite lacklustre when you pair it with only 1 ghost or 3 ghosts. Try it with 2, and put Genesect in the last slot. Mbanette is able to clear both Gengar and Giratina, which leaves concentrated Genesect for big crowd control.  And naturally, this means that Mbanette is only useful in rounds where you can afford to use more ghosts, and any 3mon round is better off with Gengar"
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,sleepslacksnooze,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:04:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've tried M-Banette many times, and not once I won with fewer turns than using M-Gengar. Giving you C-1.5? some cases maybe, refer to my example, is it occasionally convenient that all your M-Banette are destroyed in a match? But whenever you make a M-Gengar match, C-1 is guaranteed. And saying M-banette ""is able to clear both Gengar and Giratina"" is misleading, it can erase either one at a time which will be replaced by the same mons soon after."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,JetLagoon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:37:16 2015 UTC,Will do.
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,Hegarol,2,Tue Jul 21 16:09:40 2015 UTC,"I am using M-Gengar, Giratina, Genesect and Cress itself. Works perfectly so far. I am at lvl46 (Trained Cress to lvl5, all other are MAX)."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,growlgrrl,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:39 2015 UTC,"Personally I've been using M-Heracross 9 / Volcarona 5 / Genesect 5 / Giratina 6 with zero issues.   Volcarona makes M-Hera evolve fast, Hera/Gene/Gira all do great dmg and M-Hera usually clears the board on its first activations."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,TracingLines,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:11 2015 UTC,"This was a great shout. Got temporarily walled by level 50, but managed it with M-Heracross 6 & Volcarona 1."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,JetLagoon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:19:50 2015 UTC,Won't Cresselia hamper damage a lot though? I've been using M-Gengar/Giratina/Yvetal/Genesect (all around lvl 5-7) and finished up to stage 54 without items. The only stage I barely made it is 50 which I finished with 0 turn left. Phew!
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,JetLagoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:58 2015 UTC,"Haven't had any problems completing the stage, usually with 10 turns remaining of the 18 you start with. The cress' get cleared more often than the others so the damage is okay and it also spawns more of the other Pokemon as well so it helps and makes it so that you'll never have any barriers."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,JetLagoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. I've gotta give it a try then. In case you want to know beforehand, stage 50 has complexity 5 (Solosis)."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,zero2exe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:31 2015 UTC,So no Cresselia?
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,zero2exe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"Cresselia is just a disruption, not really a part of the complexity. It doesn't fall down to the board."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,MetaThPr4h,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:56 2015 UTC,I'm using M-Gengar / Heracross / Genesect / Giratina Crowd Control and Power of 4+ make insane damage on their own while Mega Gengar makes crazy combos. If the barriers become too annoying I just wait for a potential 4-match of Cresselia to be spawned on the board an go for it.
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,JetLagoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:15 2015 UTC,I did that on my first run of lv40 and thought having a Cress might be a bit more useful because I hated the barriers and the odd 5th Pokemon.. and it turned out to work great. Give it a try if you get stuck.
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,Swithe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:27 2015 UTC,Well my team works pretty well for now as I'm on level 49 right now waiting for more hearts. The lowest I have been to beating the stage is at 3 moves left once otherwise I'm finishing anywhere between 5-10 moves left every round.
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,JetLagoon,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:36 2015 UTC,"I personally go MegaGengar Giratina Genesect and Heracross and beat  the first 49 stages itemless pretty easily.  in 5 mins I have the heart for the last one, I'm sure it's going to be real bullshit.  EDIT: I was probably lucky but the stage was unbelievably easy with that team, beat it itemless with 7 moves left.  No disruptions but before the first move Cress freezed a side of the board, Solosis are in the map, anyways I got a combo in move 1, MegaGengar at move 2, and facerolled her."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,Swithe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:02 2015 UTC,Congratulations pal. You did a lot better than me. Luck favored you to have Gengar evolved so soon.
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,MaiKitty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:44 2015 UTC,M-gengar by the second turn is normal. its even possible in a single turn with the right setup.  did you use a megaspeedup with gengar?
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,JetLagoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:12 2015 UTC,"No, I've invested all my mega candies in Aerodactyl, one of the slowest damn things to evolve."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,MaiKitty,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:13:06 2015 UTC,"not a bad move. with the increased amount of block stages, having him out fast is nice.  used my first on gengar cause figured hes almost always useful, and its only one candy lol... Im currently sitting on my other candies. cant decide, lol."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,JetLagoon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:06:21 2015 UTC,"For level 50, bringing Cresselia doesn't work in your favor anymore. A Psychic type Pokemon is added and if you add that to your line up another different Psychic Mon is added. I'v tried the stage a few times now and it clear that I won't beat it without items. Just wondering which ones are the best. Any tips?"

PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,Thrormurn,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:37 2015 UTC,"You may try an all super effective team with M-Gengar. Do not fixate on destroying barriers too much. I never bother to, unless the barriers are too high on the board or I can clear them while making a match elsewhere.  I did stage 50 only once and beat it with 0 turn left, so I don't know whether my luck was bad or good (no notable combo whatsoever), but a move +5 should guarantee victory."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,Sluha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I gave it another go, and really spent time thinking about every move and also made it without items and no turns left, so it is indeed possible. 51 was easy again. I wonder if I should continue or start farming Meowth again. Decisions, Decisions....."
PokemonShuffle,3e2yb7,Thrormurn,3,Tue Jul 21 17:19:33 2015 UTC,"Cresselia has some coin stages; the soonest one from 50 are 55, 75...More details are in another thread."
PokemonShuffle,3e2wwr,KamuKid,4,Tue Jul 21 15:27:45 2015 UTC,The highest damage I've ever did was when mega lucario did a 6 match. It cleared the entire screen and did 1500 damage. The combos where happening so fast I didn't know what was happening.
PokemonShuffle,3e2wwr,xSoulsaber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:51 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah, I forgot that Mega Pokemon would do an insane amount of damage.. like Lucario and Aerodactyl especially. But seeing a normal Pokemon do it was just surreal."
PokemonShuffle,3e2wwr,zero2exe,2,Tue Jul 21 16:09:28 2015 UTC,I think I did around 3k damage with Sceptile's Vitality Drain against Regirock when it was around. Didn't help much anyway lol

I almost put my DS down to go get a snack."
PokemonShuffle,3e2wwr,TheLightdarker,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:24:56 2015 UTC,"With a single icon match, I've done maybe 1500 with Vitality Drain on Ampharos, and earlier today I had Genesect's Crowd Control hit Cresselia for 1050 - maybe my record for that ability? I'm sure I've probably seen better, but those come immediately to mind. I've been level grinding a lot, lately, so I'm not used to seeing normally high numbers."

Pretty much everyone who gets mad at this level overlooks how completely necessary Feebas is just to do anything.   Now if you've been doing that, and still can't win, bump it up to using a DD because Milotic is a fickle bitch who will just dump garbage onto the board."
PokemonShuffle,3e0uc9,DBrody6,8,Tue Jul 21 02:27:17 2015 UTC,"In addition, you need to be lucky enough to have Feebas arranged to destroy several top barriers in first turn, so that mons can fall down."

I enjoy playing this. But now it feels like everything is starting to get cheap. Hopefully there won't be any Milotic or Onyx bullshit in the main levels after this one."
PokemonShuffle,3e0uc9,DBrody6,9,Tue Jul 21 02:57:38 2015 UTC,"Your...difficulty depends on if you have all the megas or not.

PokemonShuffle,3e0uc9,Infinitedaw,2,Tue Jul 21 02:29:40 2015 UTC,nah I just want to clear it. Thanks for the tip
PokemonShuffle,3e0uc9,KamuKid,4,Tue Jul 21 02:52:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah there were a few that were just a sheer pain in the ass. Sometimes you just have to wait for the game to take pity on you after so many tries (I swear when I was trying to get Steelix the game was just like ""You suck so much, I'm going to take it easy on you after your 200th time trying to beat this level"")."
PokemonShuffle,3e0uc9,awkwardsoul,2,Tue Jul 21 02:41:45 2015 UTC,wow. who many times I failed onyx ... with or without items and when I used items ... always a barely fail to beat him.

PokemonShuffle,3e0uc9,02pheland,3,Tue Jul 21 02:46:56 2015 UTC,"I took M Ampharos, Feebas, Shaymin and Zapdos. It's nigh impossible to beat without Feebas on your team and apparently necessary to S-Rank it as well. Shaymin will lower the amount of disruptions (even though they're somewhay useful since you have a feebas of your own, so many bring Raikou or Sceptile?) and Zapdos' Po4 is always useful :) Good luck!"
PokemonShuffle,3e0uc9,PockymonShiffle,3,Tue Jul 21 04:00:42 2015 UTC,"Like others said, bring feebas and hope the RNG is lucky at the start and lines them up to clear the top wall of ice.   I also beat it with Mega Lucario and pure muscle, it's much more sloppy though."

PokemonShuffle,3e4oye,DifferentKindOfGeek,5,Tue Jul 21 22:53:59 2015 UTC,"No, there's a better way. That way will take you 80 hours for 9 hearts. This way takes 72:  Streetpass your first old 3DS five times then the second old 3DS five times. Since you're switching to the other one, you don't have to wait 8 hours when you switch.  I just keep my two old 3DSes off all the time until I want to Streetpass. Then I turn one of them on briefly. If you get an extra unwanted Streetpass from elsewhere, you can delete it in the Notifications menu."

I remember escalation Giratina being less difficult, disruption wise, than Cresselia has been so far - I'm on 38, iirc, using max M-Gengar, Giratina, Yveltal, and Genesect. Strong setup, to be sure, but I still have nightmares of using disruption delay and being glued to ShuffleMove for Giratina stage 50-100.  Edit: I'm on 33. How many coins is a coin level worth? I have 96,000 ATM and may need to spend down"
PokemonShuffle,3dx0ov,JustAnotherRandomLad,2,Mon Jul 20 23:41:10 2015 UTC,"It actually gets easier after stage 50 - you go from barriers every 2-3 turns to every 6. Hang in there - I'm past 70 and haven't lost or had to use items yet.  For the coin levels, you only get 10 turns, Cresselia has ~2500 HP, and coins don't drop from the top. I used Stage 37 tactics (rather than weekend Meowth ones; i.e., set up long lines rather than depend on Cresselia to make them) and got ~1500 last time."

PokemonShuffle,3dx0ov,Juuna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:43:20 2015 UTC,"That's why I told you to give up on Arceus and focus on normal/expert stages to get better mons fast. That aside, M-Gengar/Aurorus/Swampert/Manaphy team isn't half bad. Compared to top players' teams, you only lack Groudon (but Manaphy is just as good) and Tyranitar which is only 10 points stronger than Aurorus, but Aurorus' Damage Streak is more useful. You should have a solid chance to place for Blazikenite just as old players have.  The only thing you can do now is practice, a lot, and level up your team. Don't go all out too soon."

PokemonShuffle,3dx0ov,leoxyz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:01 2015 UTC,"Unless you're really efficient at arranging tiles (which I'm not), Manaphy is better than Suicune. Ampharos stage gives more exp, but it's a lot easier and faster to train on Buneary stage. If you can't win consistently on the former, then train on the latter.  Smeargle stage is 155, and Tyranitar stage is 200 which means about 45 stages (9 * 5 hearts) apart. Think you can pull it off for Tyranitar? Some normal stages can be hard to win without items, Onix for example."
PokemonShuffle,3dx0ov,MaiKitty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:02 2015 UTC,Kind of weird how Europe is downgraded to only the top 12.000 for the stone. Is this because not many people did the Mega Lucario revisit? Since Im pretty sure Mega Manectric had a lot more people ccompeting then usual. So for all they should boost up the ranking rather then downgrade it.
PokemonShuffle,3dx0ov,leoxyz,2,Mon Jul 20 18:02:52 2015 UTC,"I was also wondering if that's the reason. I have the stone so I got two jewels in the M-Lucario Event and naturally didn't use items, only played the stage once to get the one jewel. _ But now to get into the top 12.000 might actually be tough, even with items. Timed stages are harder for me so I'm a bit scared I won't be able to make it even with items."

PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,ratcliffja,6,Mon Jul 20 22:26:36 2015 UTC,"Also, be aware that this is the probability BEFORE you even play the mode.  Every time you fail to catch Cresselia, you have to adjust your probability again.  If you're at Level 30 and haven't caught Cresselia yet, your chances of catching aren't 99%+.  Its still 30%.  Its was pretty statistically amazing that you actually GOT to this point, but your probability is the same as if you had never made an attempt before (and are just throwing a 30-31% ball at a new pokemon)."
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,Hazdoc,3,Mon Jul 20 14:25:05 2015 UTC,I caught it at 2%.  Way better than 39% for Giratina
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,Sparkeagle,2,Mon Jul 20 15:28:58 2015 UTC,On the giritina stage somebody didn't catch it till about level 56. I think they were resetting every time it was caught though.
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,goldfish270,2,Mon Jul 20 13:46:28 2015 UTC,The odds of that happening without doing something like resetting away accidentally catching it are about 1.5 in 100 million.
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,TameFlame,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:15:59 2015 UTC,"You both refer to ""resetting"". Could you perhaps elaborate? I'm not familiar with the term in this context."
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,makoblade,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:11:35 2015 UTC,They mean quit the game and restart. If you do that on a catch it won't go through.
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,TameFlame,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, that makes sense. For what purpose would you do that though?"
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,growlgrrl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:17:58 2015 UTC,If you bought great balls but didnt catch the pokemon you can quit the game and not have to pay for them.
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,makoblade,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:22:08 2015 UTC,You can do it to save money on failed great balls. Not sure about why you'd reset on a successful catch.
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,clerksrat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:00 2015 UTC,Got him at level 2 and regular pokeball! Now Cresselia is making me work...
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,giraffe196,2,Mon Jul 20 21:15:47 2015 UTC,I didn't catch Giratina until 29
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,goldfish270,2,Mon Jul 20 14:45:44 2015 UTC,Heres the link for proof: https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYQHAAABAACNUKFHjP6Gww Pretty sure he reset
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,giraffe196,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:02:18 2015 UTC,Geez idk. That's terrible though. I gave up at 54 wth Giratina. I just caught Cresselia at 8 so I'm going to focus on Wobbufett (need to beat in a multiple of 10 once captured to soothe my OCD). After that I'm gonna focus on Megs Blaziken with my full item run on Sunday night then it'll be back to Cresselia with hopes of making it to 50(depending on how bad it gets I'll decide if itemless 100 is possible). I know I'll get the Speedup from Blaziken so I'll be happy if I get 2.
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,FrenchRocks69,2,Mon Jul 20 15:14:15 2015 UTC,I caught it on the very first stage at 1%
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,TehBoo1Two,2,Mon Jul 20 14:10:43 2015 UTC,Same here!

PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,MegaMissingno,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:00:51 2015 UTC,I'm kind of annoyed how easy it is to get some of these base 80 power pokémon. Anyone with Mega Sableye can pretty much get Cresselia which gives such a huge powerhouse to the early game players.  Back in my days we had to deal with all kinds of hard crap and we liked it. /s
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,drumsoverbogota,3,Mon Jul 20 14:25:41 2015 UTC,ha! I'm playing a second Pokemon Shuffle game and having M-manectric and now Arceus is WAY cheap
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,cyberscythe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:53 2015 UTC,having M-manectric   Why is Manectric better than Ampharos? Is it just the Hitting Streak ability?
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,thales_lima,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:56 2015 UTC,"Not only his ability is better but also his thunder's pattern. Is a little bit more linear than Ampharos', which allows more combos"

PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,tebbi123,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:01:46 2015 UTC,I caught it at level 4 but since then I haven't been able to catch anything else. I guess I used up a lot of my luck on that stage.
PokemonShuffle,3dxskd,Mathina26,-1,Wed Jul 22 16:25:05 2015 UTC,Sorry for saying but caught it at 7% and thank you! :)

PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,purplemew,2,Mon Jul 20 19:45:06 2015 UTC,Luck.  I struck out every time
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,Ali-Sama,3,Mon Jul 20 19:46:06 2015 UTC,Keep at it you'll get him! If need be wait until some of the other items come out to help you beat him up faster. (I'm guessing you're talking about Wobbuffet)
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,purplemew,3,Mon Jul 20 20:21:57 2015 UTC,I caught him!
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,Ali-Sama,4,Tue Jul 21 00:21:30 2015 UTC,You did itttt!! Congrats!! <3
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,purplemew,2,Tue Jul 21 00:24:44 2015 UTC,ty! i got super catch! went up to 50% it took several tries! btw the normal legendary. Forgot the name. It is amazing. I have not done the challenge yet. :) i hope to! i got a emerald or crystal whatever for last challenge! I already had him so i just played with a team for experience so others could get him! i will more then likely grind for more credits and buy all the options if i need to get new challenge! lol.
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,Ali-Sama,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:18 2015 UTC,I beat him.. Catching is impossible.
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,Ali-Sama,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:54:41 2015 UTC,Thank you! :)
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,giraffe196,2,Mon Jul 20 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"Caught Wobbufett with a 34% chance as the super catch activated (still have to beat the level 3 more times to get my coins back to ending in 0 though, OCD). Caught Cresselia with a 8% chance (super happy about this as it took me until 29% to get Giratina).  Got the 200 coins from Girafarig (but already had it, just wanted money).    Also haven't tried Mega Blaziken yet as I'm waiting to see the most used teams.  Which mega should I use? I have all available megas except for Mewtwo as I haven't caught him yet.  I heard Aerodactyl works well but if I use a Disruption Delay will it still work good? I have enough for 2 full item runs if need be (in other words a Mega Speedup will be mine)."
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,Chunni-chan,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"According to the top 5, Gengar seems to be the most used Mega. Tyranitar and Groudon seem to be the norm, with Kyogre or Swampert taking the last spot. I recommend Swampert due to Hitting Streak, which really helps more than Kyogre's ability. After a couple full item runs, I was able to score >6k, which will probably secure a speedup."
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,giraffe196,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:33:24 2015 UTC,"Mega Blaziken has block disruptions so Mega Aerodactyl might be useful but if you use a Complexity-1, then Mega Gengar could mae combos. However, Mega Blastoise is good without items and maye with. Also, as there is no mega start and Mega Aerodactyl takes a while to mega evolve, it might not do as much damage with a Disruption Delay and if you are using Complexity-1, less experienced in timed stages or going for combos, Mega Gengar could be useful but if you are faster or going for damage, then Mega Blastoise might be better but I've not used items yet and sorry. Thank you! :)"
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,Shepdawg1,2,Mon Jul 20 20:30:36 2015 UTC,Ok well if there's no Mega Start I'm gonna use Gengar or Blastoise then
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,TheDemonicEmperor,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"There isn't a Mega Start. I believe the power-ups are Complexity - 1, Attack Power Up, and Disruption Delay."
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,dude_guy_bro_man,2,Tue Jul 21 01:59:55 2015 UTC,Caught Cresselia at 9% (I'll likely try to get it up to level 30 and that's about it).  I've managed to strike out on Wobbuffet each time.
PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,MetaThPr4h,2,Mon Jul 20 20:20:10 2015 UTC,Been grinding meowth with little to show for it for due to combing out over and over. Bad luck day. Hope it turns around--I'm gonna need all the coins I can get for the next few weeks.

Somehow that's still the top 2% of all entrants, and going by the number of participants from the last competition, is a guaranteed speedup. Happy about that."

Not sure how I'm going to pass level 41 right now, been stuck on it for about 5 tries now and M-gengar/M-Hera aren't really helping much anymore and I'm not really sure which to go with next.

PokemonShuffle,3dzdli,valedictions,5,Mon Jul 20 20:51:23 2015 UTC,Giraffes aren't stupid.
PokemonShuffle,3dx30g,Underfyre,8,Mon Jul 20 06:37:46 2015 UTC,"By now, the top 5 are all super effective teams. That has to say something about Arceus and its normal team..."
PokemonShuffle,3dx30g,JetLagoon,4,Mon Jul 20 09:21:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that it's brutally difficult to pull off. The top team in EU is an Arceus team, and I think two of the top 5 in Japan are also Arceus teams. There's been two in NA as well but they've been bumped off.   It requires absolutely flawless play and good enough luck that you can proc Double Normal right at the start. At 13500 coins per attempt at playing for the top spots, the majority of people are going to side towards the safer SE team option. People at the coin cap (and I imagine anyone shooting for the top 5 was at it prior to the update) can only attempt a high score run 7 times before needing to farm Meowth, and even then it's a full day's worth of hearts to earn the 14K needed for just one more attempt. So for people who don't want to pay money for coins, these people realistically only have 10 attempts...it's really not surprising almost everyone isn't using a risky team that has extreme difficulty."
PokemonShuffle,3dx30g,DBrody6,4,Mon Jul 20 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"Which means I guess it's safe to say that super effective teams have better average scenario and Arceus team has better best scenario.  But if we have a water/rock/ground counterpart of Pyre/Sky Blast/Double Normal etc, the super effective teams would be completely superior."
PokemonShuffle,3dx30g,JetLagoon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:36 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, super effective teams already have a 1.5 (it is 1.5, right?) multiplier going for them. An additional 2x would completely imbalance them."
PokemonShuffle,3dx30g,Shepdawg1,2,Tue Jul 21 00:28:38 2015 UTC,"True, top 5 are all now super effective teams. But it does say that you can make top 6000 with a gimmicky team."
PokemonShuffle,3dx30g,Ekint,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:12:45 2015 UTC,Of course we have to wait a week to see if that's true or if I have to spend another 13000g to get back into top 6k.

PokemonShuffle,3ds7oc,deogenerate,2,Sun Jul 19 00:53:25 2015 UTC,"Probably reminds you of the music because Shuffle is composed by Genius Sonority's resident Pokemon composer, Tsukasa Tawada, just as Colosseum and XD are. He also did Trozei!, Battle Trozei and Battle Revolution. (Strangely, he didn't do Typing Adventure; that's composed by people from Basiscape (Azusa Chiba and two others, I forget who else) whom did works like Denpa Men, Final Fantasy XII, Muramasa, Tactics Ogre, Tekken 6)  I'm kind of sad he hasn't done much other than GS Pokemon stuff since like 2000, although he did do that one weird Harvest Moon 3DS game recently but that's it.

PokemonShuffle,3dg10m,kenniky,7,Thu Jul 16 00:54:57 2015 UTC,"I think that's very likely to happen, the client number of the game syncs the data from both your devices with each other every time you check-in or press a ""synchronize devices"" button to do so, similarly to how the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection cross-save feature works on the PS3 and the Vita."

PokemonShuffle,3dg10m,Fenor,2,Thu Jul 16 15:16:47 2015 UTC,"Good question. I believe my cellphone is useful to have around me during the day because sometimes I have to receive or make important calls, so it will already be around, not only for my game addiction, which is ignorable. Also I don't feel like I care about my cellphone as much as I care about my 3ds. I believe it's a mix between the facts that I'm more emotionally attached to my video games than telephones and that it would be really easier to replace it considering the huge price difference.  It's not safer, but it's a risk I already take, so it's something."

PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,bowser0000,18,Wed Jul 15 01:02:23 2015 UTC,"I am assuming Mega Blaziken will be time-based stage (most of the previous stages are plus the SS leaked shows 1 minute-stage) and I'm willing to spend some coins on itens to assure a really good score (there's also a chance this callenge comes with mega speed-up as well and I want it), so keeping that in mind, let's take a look at our pokemon options:  Megas   Gengar: Well, Gengar should be in a high level already for anyone, so no need to grind it. If you don't have a high level Gengar I strongly advice you train yours, hes useful on many many stages, so sooner rather than later train him. Blastoise: I'm betting on Blastoise to be the best Mega choice on this level. He can clean up black-smokes and ice blocks like no other option here and hes pretty decent against blocks while keeping damage up. Aerodactyl: He will be a godlike choice, but only if stage is heavily block-oriented. Anything away from that just makes Blastoise a better choice.   Regular pokes   Tyranitar (80-based): Highest attack plus good ability and hes brown, way peculiar colour pattern specially besides so many blue-based water pokemons, and this helps A LOT in time-based stages. No reason not to chose it. Groudon (70-based): Good attack and a good ability as well as a good colour pattern. One of the top choices. Kyogre (70-based): His ability is Rock Break and I expect to break rocks with either with Blastoise or Aerodactyl, so kinda weak ability on this one here. Aurorus (70-based): Damage Streak helps to deliver heavier damage, a good choice so far. Swampert (70-based): Same ability and power as Aurorus, as good as the forementioned. Excadrill (70-based): A good power, good colour but that Power of 5 is not that great in time-based stages. I can't find time to match 5 pokes in a time-stage so for me his ability is kinda useless. Maybe if you have some cat-like reflexes or something he is actually a really good choice since Power of 5 helps A LOT to pump the damage given. Milotic (70-based): Stabilize+ is a great ability, but again, I expect to remove disruptions with my Mega, so I would say hes a little useful only. Regirock (70-based): Since Im aiming to the top, Last-Ditch Effort is totally useless. As I said, I'm willing to get a really good score, so I will not use his ability at all. Just a 70-based poke. Manaphy (70-based): A good ability, but not in time-based stages and once again, my plain is to break disruptions with my Mega. Greninja (70-based): I DO NOT have Greninja yet, so I'm not considering using him. His ability is Mind Zap, which I would say is situational. If I had him I would set him at level 7-8 or so and the moment I see Blaziken's disruptions is a pain, I would grind him to max and use it.   Considering all this I found myselft training these mon:  Mega Blastoise  Tyranitar  Groudon  Aurorus  They're all solid, a good damage line-up with Quake and Hitting Streak, all 4 different colours, good versus disruptions with Blastoise. The reason I chose Aurorus over Swampert is that the latter is more easily mistaken by Blastoise. The only flaw I see here is lack of combo potentional, which could be only achieved by using Gengar as Mega. If I see I need some more combos, I would go for Gengar as mega and hope to beat Blaziken shortly after Disruption Delay is over so I don't need to deal with random blocks, pokes or whatever.  What you think guys?"
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,thales_lima,7,Wed Jul 15 06:52:14 2015 UTC,"Gengar will be best. Blastoise is awful for timed events--it wipes out the majority of the board and you're forced to wait for skyfall (and your combo ending) before you can keep matching. In the M-Venusaur event, there was a good reason why the top 5 in pretty much every region all used M-Gengar and not Glalie.   Depending on cloud spam I could see an argument for Blastoise, but if you're aiming for a decent score (moreso if there's a speedup available) you'll be using all items and therefore there won't be anywhere near as many cloud/block disruptions as you'd imagine."
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,DBrody6,5,Wed Jul 15 14:06:22 2015 UTC,"I hate Aerodactyl for timed...the blocks dont vanish for an absurd amount of time so it just blocks matches for awhile.

PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,Rez91,3,Wed Jul 15 10:53:51 2015 UTC,Tyranitar (80-based): Highest attack plus good ability and hes brown   WAIT my tyranitar has a puke green color. Maybe something is wrong with mine. :(

PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,Calder027,2,Wed Jul 15 20:23:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think Last-Ditch Effort is based on score. From my experiences with the Meowth stage, it procs pretty consisting during the last few turns, even with only a 3 match. I haven't tested it, but I assume in Timed matches it will provide during the last chunk of seconds (perhaps the last 10 seconds, maybe more). It does a ton of damage, so I could see Regirock being a useful partner. Plus, it's great to have a brown Pokemon among the sea of blues."
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,MonkeyWarlock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:21:52 2015 UTC,"Last-Ditch effort gives 50% more damage on the last 3 turns of the game, when the warning pops on the screen. For timed stages i'd guess it would trigger on the last 10 seconds then, but for that you'd need to let your combo drop and make a Last-Ditch pokémon match first to be able to use it."

PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,LioAlanMessi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:17:48 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty good guide, but I'm predicting the stage is going to have a lot of disruptions because they're probably going to want to push people into using Greninja for his Mind Zap. That means a lot of money would need to be spent for people to get all the S-Ranks necessary to unlock him. Which is what a shrewd business would do if they were trying to make a buck. Which is what I expect they are. If I'm wrong I'll have to admit my paranoid cynicism, but I'll be happy for being wrong."
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,butthead,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:58:00 2015 UTC,Did you sacrifice to RNGesus to catch Tyranitar or what? Because I'm a match shy of a mental breakdown over here.
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,cjs911217,5,Wed Jul 15 09:01:09 2015 UTC,"Bro I didn't had a hard time catching Tyranitar. I think I did it in my second try (it's been some time ago). I remember I procced some lucky Vitality Drain with Sceptile and Stabilize+ with Blastoise. Try to use Vitality Drain early on, it deals like 2000 damage on TTar if I'm not mistaken, it helps a lot"
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,thales_lima,2,Wed Jul 15 09:20:21 2015 UTC,"probably either mega blastoise, mega gengar, or mega aerodactyl along with greninja, groudon, and tyranitar since theyre all max leveled. i dont usually find abilities that useful in timed challenges because ideally you want to get a combo going the entire time.  speaking of, i might actually use my max level arceus, because if im lucky enough to get its ability to go off at the beginning of my combo, i'll have a super effective 110 base power pokemon to use every time i match it in the combo. its risky, but there isnt any consequence to trying."
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,valedictions,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:57:27 2015 UTC,"Base 110 * (occasionally) Double Normal vs Base 90/100 * (always) super effective + an ability?  Yep, I know which I would choose."
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,JetLagoon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:06:42 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by this?   ""i might actually use my max level arceus, because if im lucky enough to get its ability to go off at the beginning of my combo, i'll have a super effective 110 base power pokemon to use every time i match it in the combo.""   Why would Arceus hit super effectilevy on Blaziken?"
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,thales_lima,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:58:26 2015 UTC,Because he has the 'Double Normal' ability which is effectively a Super Effective ability for Normal types.
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,Amish_Thunder,2,Wed Jul 15 06:07:12 2015 UTC,"What is the activation rate on it though? If it procs 100%, it would be godlike, but I heared that it was something like 25% (on 3's), so in that case a weaker super effective pokémon would be more reliable."
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,FirePosition,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:33:27 2015 UTC,"Yea, the activation rate is not so great.  25% is probably a good estimate.  Hooo boy if you get it on a cascading combo though. :-)"
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,Amish_Thunder,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:44:33 2015 UTC,"Wow. Didn't know it was so strong. I see it boosts damage by 250%, interesting. Still, can't say if Hitting Streak is better than Double Normal in a time-based because Hitting Streak bonus' keep getting better by use, beyond 250%, just don't know how long does it take. Maybe it is actually a better choice to bring Arceus"
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,thales_lima,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:06:56 2015 UTC,I think Hitting/Damage Streak increases attack by 20% with each activation and caps out at 200% from what I've seen.
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,Amish_Thunder,4,Wed Jul 15 23:51:09 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one doesn't care about intentionally training levels in this game? It's such a hassle, and a decent amount of practice on a stage plus coins are more than enough."
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,JetLagoon,4,Wed Jul 15 12:47:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, level grinding is overrated unless you're going for the leaderboard. Having only level 5 Pokes has yet to be an issue on any level."

PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,Hydrathefearful,2,Wed Jul 15 13:53:21 2015 UTC,I myself just find another game to play in waiting for new contents to be added.
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,JetLagoon,2,Wed Jul 15 14:02:38 2015 UTC,"In preparation I'm leveling my water, rock and ground types to lv8 (Milotic/Manaphy/Swampert/Regirock/Auroros/Aerodactyl/Blastoise/Marowak/Donphan).. never know whose ability/mega will prove useful, right?"
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,KamuKid,2,Wed Jul 15 02:02:14 2015 UTC,Is it even worth it to level up Marowak/Donphan? That 10 damage isn't nothing...  Edit: Just realized Greninja's Mind Zap makes Ampharos completely reset its Countdown to 15... Doesn't mean he'll be good for Blaziken though
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,MayorOfChuville,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:29:26 2015 UTC,"It all depends how the stage gonna be, the amount and types of disruption. I'm leveling Milotic, Manaphy, Kyogre, Tyranitar, etc. For the Mega slot, it's either Blastoise, Gengar or Aerodactyl."
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,elleotribal,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:15:03 2015 UTC,"Well, let's thing logically here. If one was to use a DD and Blaziken uses rocks/metal block as disruptions, Aerodactyl wouldn't be feasible to use as the mega. If Blaziken uses ice barriers to disrupt, the best bet would be Blastoise-M with a team of Milotic, Manaphy and Groudon to interrupt disruptions as much as possible.. and Gengar should obviously be the mega of choice if it's a 3 Pokemon stage. Good luck everyone!"
PokemonShuffle,3dbq5u,4dazan,0,Wed Jul 15 22:35:05 2015 UTC,"Like elleotribal and kamukid have said, it's very dependent on how the level plays out.  Mega Blas will be good to keep combos alive. And for smokescreen. Mega Aero will be great in a block heavy level. Mega Gen will be in case there are 3 pokes or no extra Pokemon.  Plus decent at taking out smoke and some barriers.  When it comes to the side pokes, tyranitar will be your heavy hitter... Then it comes down to who or what you need to remove... Groudon will be a good poke as quake will hit hard and potentially paralyze.  I'd prob stay away from stunfisk / marowak unless you make and all ground team... Swampert, manaphy and milotic all play various roles. Excadrill could be interesting...  In the end, do a few runs with various pokes before doing an item run is my suggestion..."

PokemonShuffle,3dayha,LeaGarcia,5,Wed Jul 15 00:47:41 2015 UTC,Agreed on the OCD issue. I was diagnosed at 4 and it has made my life quite a challenge. It really pisses me off to see people use it in situations like these. It just contributes to the ignorance of the problem.
PokemonShuffle,3dayha,bogaboy,3,Wed Jul 15 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"I agree. I do not have OCD myself, but having studied it and I know how it feels for my own illness to be the product of much misunderstanding, I try and correct people where possible. That being said, it felt a little weird making it such an issue on a reddit forum about pokemon shuffle, so I merely commented on it and hope the OP was simply ignorant and chooses to learn about the actual illness (or simply understand this isn't it) so they can avoid this in the future. I wish you the best. c:  Edit: corrected a word."

PokemonShuffle,3dayha,bogaboy,2,Wed Jul 15 18:20:20 2015 UTC,"Out of genuine curiosity, what would you propose to be a better alternative way to illustrate the same idea as a figure of speech of this faux ""OCD""?  Because I myself have ignorantly used it, and always wanted to know a better way to joke about ""man I need all these small details consistent its driving me insane in a figure of speech kind of way""  Or do you suppose its not worth joking about altogether?"
PokemonShuffle,3dayha,Vinylzen,2,Fri Jul 17 06:48:37 2015 UTC,"I have no problem joking about it, because sometimes you just need to laugh at yourself. I spent some time in a mental hospital as a teen, and we would all joke about our ocd with eachother, and it wasn't a problem. I just have an issue with people using the term ignorantly, which can create problems for the people suffering from the disorder. For example, growing up at school sometime I would have to tell teachers about my problems because it was effecting my work in their class (I would leave the room 5-10x a period to wash my hands). And some teachers who were ignorant on the issue just wouldn't understand. And honestly, I'm not sure the best term to use when joking about it. I wish I had a better answer, but I'm not sure I do. Maybe the term ""nit-picky"" or ""anal"" might work. Anal would get a double laugh."

PokemonShuffle,3dayha,Exodiafinder687,2,Wed Jul 15 03:32:45 2015 UTC,"It's true that Chesnaught is hard to S-rank but it's not impossible, what in my opinion makes Chesnaught ""easier"" than Genesect is that you can't buy a Compelxity -1 which makes any full item run a lot cheaper and you don't need 45 or more seconds to get the S-rank. While I can't exactly remember my time it was something around 38 seconds and you might be fine with even 35 seconds, good luck!"
PokemonShuffle,3dayha,Oskise10001,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:50:18 2015 UTC,"Chesnaught seems to me like he comes down to how fast Aerodactyl Mega Evolves, because the combo potential when you only have 2 mons is ridiculous.

PokemonShuffle,3d3p0y,Swithe,6,Mon Jul 13 07:17:34 2015 UTC,A fire mega? Great. Now we don't have to rely on M-Lucario too much thanks to M-Heracross and M-Blaziken.
PokemonShuffle,3d3p0y,MegaMissingno,4,Mon Jul 13 08:13:44 2015 UTC,"What teams is everyone gonna prepare? Browsing through we have a few decent ground and water types. Does ""Quake"" work on fire types? i know it doesnt for electric.  Theres a fair few mon all with ""damage streak"" that could do some good damage so im torn between a damage streak team or a groudon/water team. I guess in the end it all comes down to what disruptions we're gonna see.  tyranitar has some good power too... maybe a groudon/tyranitar/watermon team will work well"
PokemonShuffle,3d3p0y,Swithe,3,Mon Jul 13 07:58:10 2015 UTC,"Quake does work on Fire types. IIRC Electric and Steel were immune but not Fire.  Damage/Hitting Streak shouldn't be used since they work poorly in timed stages.  For a mega it's either Gengar, Blastoise or Aerodactyl but I think Gengar will be the best since the other two are not that good for combos. Other pokémon are probably best left for optimise."
PokemonShuffle,3d3p0y,Disgruntled__Goat,4,Mon Jul 13 08:06:53 2015 UTC,"a key part when deciding megas seems to be the amount and type of disruption. im probably gonna prep aero if its blocks and gengar if it isnt. a few blastoise levels cant hurt.  streaks work okay in timed if you drop the combo often, though it was noteworthy that so many streakers were effective.  Personally it seems ill be going groudon, tyranitar and then one water mon depending on hazards (swap or zap for example) with the mega based on disruptions."
PokemonShuffle,3d3p0y,MegaMissingno,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:09:26 2015 UTC,"Damage/Hitting Streak shouldn't be used since they work poorly in timed stages.   Uh... it's actually the complete opposite, they work great in timed stages and less well in turn-based ones. The best scores are when you keep the combo going so if you start with a Streak and keep going you get even more. Disregard."
PokemonShuffle,3d3p0y,Disgruntled__Goat,2,Tue Jul 14 17:32:43 2015 UTC,"No. The bonus from Hitting/Damage Streak ONLY applies to the first match of a combo. You're confusing them with Pummel/Sinister Power/Pyre etc. which do indeed keep getting stronger when the combo goes on.  Since the ideal way of playing a timed stage is to keep up one massive combo, there will only be a chance of one ability activating meaning that most abilities are useless, other than the ones specifically designed for combos that I listed."
PokemonShuffle,3d3p0y,MegaMissingno,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:53:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm well according to this it's the same combo, not separate turns."
PokemonShuffle,3d3p0y,Disgruntled__Goat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:30:06 2015 UTC,"I did do some testing in both turns and timed and only the first match got the multiplier. Most of my combos were fairly short (3-5) but there wasn't anything to suggest that the multiplier would remain or increase within a combo. Of course, feel free to do more testing to prove me wrong or find a video evidence for the exact behaviour of the abilities.  I only tested Hitting Streak though. Maybe Damage Streak is different? I'm currently out of hearts but I'll look into this later if you or anyone else hasn't."
PokemonShuffle,3d3p0y,Disgruntled__Goat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:57:56 2015 UTC,"OK did some testing myself and I think you're correct. My bad.  Damage Streak works the same too. And the effects of both abilities are only for the same Pokemon, i.e. if DS procs for Stunfisk one turn then Marowak the next turn, Marowak only gets the first activation boost (1.2x), not the second."
PokemonShuffle,3d3p0y,Swithe,2,Wed Jul 15 11:31:22 2015 UTC,"Quake is too unreliable, it hardly ever procs. Groudon is worth it because of its power, but instead of Donphan you should use Stunfisk or Marowak."

PokemonShuffle,3d3p0y,giraffe196,3,Mon Jul 13 09:44:31 2015 UTC,Depends on what type of distuptions there are.  Blastoise + some combination of Milotic/Manaphy/Kyogre/Keldeo if there are a lot of disruptions otherwise Groudon and Tyranitar for raw power.

PokemonShuffle,3d3j9a,Swithe,15,Mon Jul 13 06:03:09 2015 UTC,"i strongly agree that its good they dont have any mega speedup prizes - that it'd just make it so greedy people would go and rank high and prevent someone from getting the mega stone.  to everyone who has the mega stone, try going for the lowest possible score. a kind of self-challenge. my current high score is 457 points with a team of umbreaon, surskit, purrloin and bonsly. as i typed this im ranked 2407/2407 for all of north america though, that's a feat!"
PokemonShuffle,3d3j9a,valedictions,3,Mon Jul 13 06:18:13 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly! Mega speed ups should only be available to new mega competitions.
PokemonShuffle,3d3j9a,JetLagoon,2,Mon Jul 13 07:19:55 2015 UTC,I agree with you. With the repeats almost no newcomer would be able to get a stone when the veterans go for the speed ups.
PokemonShuffle,3d3j9a,StrawberryKysa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:22:54 2015 UTC,"That's not true. The cutoff scores have been very low in turn-based competitions so anyone can place with a little effort. Of course, a lot of people don't make the effort and fail to get the stone.  http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/114531-pokemon-shuffle/72147900 - post 6 especially."
PokemonShuffle,3d3j9a,avengahM,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:26:16 2015 UTC,"When I posted I didn't know, that the cut off scores were very low for turn-based competition (realised it myself after competing). I also didn't know, that OP might be wrong. I assumed that it was true and based it on my experiences so far.   But I wouldn't say, that everyone who fails just lacks the effort. Sometimes it's also just the information how to play the game right to get the stones.  I just started lurking here and learned what I've been doing wrong or could be doing better. So I could turn my effort to success. So effort without knowledge had me failing since I started a while ago.   Seems like you're well informed. What about the cutoff scores for time-based competitions? And not just repeats. Will effort and knowledge give good chances to get these stones as well? Hope you don't mind me asking."
PokemonShuffle,3d3j9a,StrawberryKysa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:12:16 2015 UTC,"Oh no, it's fine! Yeah, the same applies to time-based competitions. A surprisingly large number of players are absolutely dreadful at them - on my old 3DS I submitted a 2500 score and beat over 13,000 other players. All you have to do is grind Meowth for a day or less - just buying the cheaper items is enough to place, and buying all items will get you into the top 2,000 with a good (not necessarily MAXed) team.  The items really do make that much difference. Players have actually referred to them as a substitute for skill, as you only have to be ""not terrible"" to get inside the top few thousand with all items.  While not everyone will know about Meowth or Ampharos, or other tips commonly shared online, anyone who wanted the stone badly enough would damn well make the effort to find things out - someone on GameFAQs said he did exactly that as he started playing DURING the first Lucario competition. He rushed through to Slowbro, ground Meowth then went all out on the last day - and placed highly.

PokemonShuffle,3d3j9a,PaintThing,9,Mon Jul 13 06:17:43 2015 UTC,They should make it so the top X people who don't already have it get Lucarionite. That way anyone getting in the top 30k doesn't push someone else out.

I heard about this event coming back and was worried theyd throw in a megaspeedup as a prize. dont get me wrong, id love to win one, but the incentive to win the speedup would deprive many newcomers of their mega stone.  salamence+victini is a huge advantage for higher level players."
PokemonShuffle,3d3j9a,Hylian-Highwind,2,Mon Jul 13 06:13:58 2015 UTC,"I feel like since the obvious intent is to give more people the stone, they won't put in prizes like that that would obviously draw the people who perform better and likely have the stone already.

Does this apply to my sister, who downloaded shuffle this week and is stuck on mawile? Which, coincidentally, would be a lot easier with M-Lucario.  I mean a team of 4 base 80s is going to passively do about 50% more damage if leveled up. If anyone who has been playing the game for a month or two also has 3000 coins to blow on an attack up (and heck, from a selfish POV it's definitely worth it for another jewel), they would be in a different league.  It's fine to say that you want 2 jewels because you want to get them and they are useful, but don't be a hypocrite and say that you deserve them because other people ""aren't trying"", as evidenced by a few gameFAQ posts."

It proves it's very possible if you put the effort in.  https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHkQ6_323w  With a team consisting of pokes before Mega Mawile, it's still possible to place easily without items. It may take a few tries, though. As people on the GameFAQs thread said, they weren't trying and still easily placed. If someone only has one go and hopes for the best, I wouldn't call that really trying, would you? A little effort is warranted.  If someone still can't score highly enough, there's always Meowth. Even daily check-ins give enough coins for an item or two, and people on Miiverse always recommend Meowth to new players."

PokemonShuffle,3d3j9a,icravedanger,0,Tue Jul 14 03:31:04 2015 UTC,"Seeing the scores does make me a little bit salty.  Most players who need the lucarionite are new players, and therefore very likely don't have mewtwo/victini/salamence/xerneas (and yet, behold the top 5 in EU all using this). More experienced players are also more likely to have a bank of coins, which most new players will burn on problematic stages.  I just did a shufflemove (ignoring it only twice to set up a better combo next turn) run with my optimised team, and got 4200/19500 with 17k. Because EU is top 15k, it looks like I will have to do an all-item run for an event that is coming around for the 3rd time.  I like how we're revisiting some important events to keep things fairer, but I think more has to be done to combat the ""rich get richer"" dynamic. Perhaps the top X players without a lucarionite get one, everyone else can play separately for jewels. Or perhaps getting a score above X gets you the mega stone, then have top 3000 get a speed up, etc."

PokemonShuffle,3d3l20,avengahM,6,Mon Jul 13 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"I've seen those kinds of arguments before and I just don't agree with them. My logic is based on trying to maximize delta fun (the increase in fun). The delta fun of me getting 3000 coins is less than the delta fun of someone else getting a mega stone. That's true even if you account for the discounting that my units of fun are worth more to me than the units of fun for other people. I base that on the value of 3000 coins being about equal to 3 runs of 5 meowth (giving myself some room to screw up since I train pokemon instead of using the Conkledurr plus 3 nothings trick). That's about a day of my time. However a mega stone is a huge deal. There are levels that I'm pretty sure were designed with the assumption that you'd have Mega-Lucario can save you a ton of coins later on. (Is it easy to tell from this post that I work in a business school?)  I'm also not sure that I like the ""deserve it"" logic. Some of the people playing this game are little kids who don't really understand how the game works. And there are other people who just started out or might even start during the week that the competition happens. I don't like to think that they are undeserving of something fun just because they aren't as skilled as I am.  I mean, you're free to disagree with me. We each value the difference in delta fun differently. I'm hoping that this little contest will cause a few people to get more delta fun from not getting a place than they'd get from placing.

Im not referring to S-ranking as that just involves going back with a stronger team and coins. I mean playing through the game and trying to beat the stage without many coins and no event mon. Hell if we allow any mon, even ones after the stage, i can S-rank it itemless no trouble.

PokemonShuffle,3d3l36,valedictions,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:56:07 2015 UTC,"Just did an all-items run with M-Slowbro, Xerneas, Chatot and Azumarill. Got a score of 44k and placed 817/71525! Not bad. I'm guessing I'll still be in the top 30k by the end."
PokemonShuffle,3d3l36,zero2exe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:52:53 2015 UTC,"it's definitely worth it, between M-Gengar and Lucario it's really great to have strong Pokemon that mega almost immediately"
PokemonShuffle,3d3l36,TameFlame,2,Mon Jul 13 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"try getting enough s ranks for xerneas at least. i'd say the ideal team is to use mega mewtwo, victini, xerneas, and maybe slowbro? since most people have it leveled pretty high, but if youre at mega gengar obviously you dont have that yet.  you might need to go all out (with items), and practice the mega lucario stage a lot if youre not good at timed stages."
PokemonShuffle,3d3l36,TameFlame,3,Mon Jul 13 06:45:00 2015 UTC,The mega lucario competition isn't even timed but rather turn based. And it's quite easy this time around since there's no added complexity.
PokemonShuffle,3d3l36,JetLagoon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:57:35 2015 UTC,"oops, you're right. also yeah i noticed that there arent riolus when i went for my run. they definitely made it easy for everyone to get the mega in order to take on arceus."
PokemonShuffle,3d3l36,TameFlame,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:21:18 2015 UTC,"I have Mega Gengar though! Would it be useful? Sadly, I've only seen Victini twice and failed both times. I need like 35 more S ranks to get Xerneas. Might give it a go."
PokemonShuffle,3d3l36,JetLagoon,2,Mon Jul 13 06:54:39 2015 UTC,"usually i'd use mega gengar more for time based competitions, mega slowpoke might be better here. maybe a team of mega slowbro, xerneas (possibly), victini (possibly), and espeon or some other psychic type with a mega boosting ability? snubbull's crowd control is useful, especially since this version of the competition has no added fifth pokemon."
PokemonShuffle,3d3l36,TameFlame,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:22:56 2015 UTC,Might work. Gengar counts as using a C-1 which helps at combos but you have to make sure to get rid of as many rock blocks as possible for that to work. Also the metal block line at the middle of tha match might get annoying.
PokemonShuffle,3d3l36,JetLagoon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:44:54 2015 UTC,I'll try it with disruption delay and attack power +. Maybe M-Slowbro would be better..
PokemonShuffle,3d3l36,JetLagoon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:31:21 2015 UTC,"Update: I managed to get enough S ranks for Xerneas though I'm having trouble beating him. I can only beat him 1/2 times, with the other times being near wins. Most of the time I win with like 0-2 seconds left though. My team is Mawile, Jirachi, Nidoking and Nidoqueen. So close yet so far!  Update 2: used a Mega Start and didn't win? Weird since I could win itemless. Used a +10 seconds and caught it with a 1% catchability... Anguish over"
PokemonShuffle,3d0116,MikoUK,2,Sun Jul 12 09:35:49 2015 UTC,"I managed to S-Rank him a while back before Mega Heracross arrived. I can't remember my Pokémon but I sure did optimize my team except for Mega Gengar.  But in terms of items, if I were to be honest with you....I saved up coins and went all in. Buy all the items to ensure victory. I tried cutting corners with a few items but always failed, except when I bought everything.  But from experience the minimum bare essentials are +5 moves for added S-Rank insurance, Complexity -1 to get rid of the Espeon icons MMY throws at you and disruption delay to prevent all the freezing and steel blocks he spams you with. You could choose to leave out Mega Start but if you don't build up your Mega meter fast enough before Disruption Delay wears off then kiss your coins goodbye in my experience."
PokemonShuffle,3d0116,yuiokino,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:50:50 2015 UTC,I must have got really lucky I s ranked it when I beat him I used a lot of items though
PokemonShuffle,3d0116,SirSmokesAlott,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"I will say, this is a pretty easy S Rank if you use a C-1 and Moves +5 at least, because the biggest obstacle, even with those disruptions, is arguably Espeon.  I recommend a team of Gengar + Optimize, Disruption Delay, C-1, and Moves +5. I finished with almost a 6 move buffer, which could mean Moves+5 is unnecessary, but I wouldn't chance it."
PokemonShuffle,3d0116,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"i used mega gengar along with yveltal, giratina, and zoroark. all i needed was +5 moves and disruption delay. i did use pokemon shuffle though and i finished with around a 2 move buffer, so if you want to be really safe you can buy a c-1, but i personally dont think its necessary.   i dont think mega heracross is useful if youre trying to go for an s rank. it'd probably be very useful to beat the stage since it could destroy mewtwos disruptions, but for combos heracross isnt great."
PokemonShuffle,3d0116,valedictions,2,Sun Jul 12 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"Mega Heracross is new, this hasn't been asked before as I'm aware. Not every solution is to use the search bar"
PokemonShuffle,3cz64n,hlhlhlhl,7,Sun Jul 12 02:47:20 2015 UTC,"i think it'd be great, but difficult to code. also might not deal with lag very well"
PokemonShuffle,3cz64n,rhysdog1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:57:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, literally a port of the N64 game would suffice. I love that game. There is the Gameboy Color version on the eShop, but it's just not the same."
PokemonShuffle,3cz64n,andersma,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:57:01 2015 UTC,"It's on 3DS eShop, you know.   Edit: wait nvm that's Puzzle Challenge. Still very similar games though."
PokemonShuffle,3cz64n,kenniky,2,Sun Jul 12 03:44:06 2015 UTC,"I would love that, but it would be very VERY easy to do wrong.  I think it would only really work on two conditions. (1) trainers won't be able to use any items and (2) you could only battle those in your immediate area."
PokemonShuffle,3cz64n,MexicanGameboy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:07:08 2015 UTC,I think just taking turns where you get the points for what happens on yours and they get what happens on theirs would be good enough. Maybe have it so you each pick two of the pokemon and keep a separate mega track if you wanted to get really fancy.
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,grilledtomato,15,Sun Jul 12 04:57:44 2015 UTC,"I'd say save them for now. Coins are easy enough to earn from the Meowth stage if you need them, and you never know when you might need the jewels for something like a Mega Speed Up.  Here's my philosophy: 12 Jewels equates to 48k Coins, but 48k Coins does not equate to 12 Jewels since  the exchange is one way and Jewels do/could have other uses."
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:01:24 2015 UTC,Hmm you're right. I'm gonna save my jewels but I may use them on coins if I can't catch Arceus/ place in M-Lucario. :/
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,skippingmud,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:29:30 2015 UTC,"There's really no good reason to either save or spend them at this point, so I save them since it's more practical and better for the long-term. Future updates might require Jewels to access items like enhancements. And, well, worst-case scenario is that you can use one if you need it in a very difficult stage."
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,JetLagoon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:21:06 2015 UTC,"Depending how much time you can spare to play Shuffle and how badly you need the coins (to get S ranks, catch ex pokemons,...). If you have little time to play, I say just exchange the jewels for coins. Farming coins for only a Comp -1 is time consuming and tedious enough. Besides, I highly doubt that Mega Speed Ups will ever be able to be bought by jewels, because...they are basically like rare candies! Have you ever bought rare candies in pokemon games? :p"
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,TrainerRedstone7,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:39:03 2015 UTC,"The thing is, most pokemon games aren't freemium. Since this one is, it's entirely possible that enhancements could be bought with jewels."
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,JetLagoon,2,Sun Jul 12 20:13:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, could be, but that would be a really bad decision because it'll give frequently paid players a huge advantage over free players, unless the game is also added a way to to earn Mega Speed Ups infinitely like earning coins. Furthermore, it might wear down competitions since losing Mega Speed Ups as a potential reward.  I (and maybe many) have always liked Shuffle because of microtransactions done well, giving balance between players. Selling Mega Speed Ups would destroy that balance."
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,icravedanger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:12:43 2015 UTC,"The microtransactions don't give paid players too big of an advantage, but they have bad value. A Complexity-1 costs almost $3, just to help you beat one stage. A great ball is very fallible and is about $1. Even if you spend $50 on this game, you will run out of coins within a month or two assuming you don't grind Meowth. This is a really bad cost-benefit ratio.  Shuffle is kind to free players because they will always be able to access all content with some time investment, but it is quite unkind to paid players."
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,JetLagoon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:50:57 2015 UTC,"""Time is money"". To some, the money to buy jewels is more trivial than the time they need to do other things instead of grinding coins. Besides, such high cost could be a way the devs discourage people to pay for jewels...or I'm just having a wishful thinking lol"
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,icravedanger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:15:37 2015 UTC,"Devs should encourage people to pay. And to see how bad Shuffle's freemium system is, you have to compare it to other freemium games as well as to DLC for paid games. Of course, it takes less time for someone to work a job and make $10 to buy 50k coins than to grind Meowth 150 times. But that argument doesn't work because, down the line, you would be paying hundreds of dollars on this game (which isn't even that high quality). The point is, $10 buys a couple hours of fun if you spend it on hearts and much less than that if you spend it on coins.  Not totally related:  ""Fire Emblem is such a great game, I played it for 200 hours""  ""If you worked minimum wage, you could have made $2000 in that time. So you're saying your save file is worth $2000?""  ""..."""
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,JetLagoon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:27:14 2015 UTC,"Those hours of fun might not get you as many S ranks and caught pokemons as spending $10 on coins though.  Btw I don't get your example. Spending time doing something enjoyable is not the same as doing some thing tedious like grinding coins (this could be a reason to buy jewels, not because of value measuring)."
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,icravedanger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:46:34 2015 UTC,"If you had $50 appear in your wallet, what is the chance that you will spend it on Shuffle? I would wager 0%, for everybody on this subreddit. Not everybody enjoys grinding coins, but almost nobody is willing to spend extra money on it."
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,JetLagoon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:48:33 2015 UTC,Someone who have lots of money and other fun things to do would do that. It doesn't make sense not to do so.
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,icravedanger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:03:17 2015 UTC,"Even people with high paying jobs usually don't spend money on Shuffle, and they don't care that much about S-ranks and captures. They would probably use the money on better games like Xenoblade or SMT Devil Survivor. Are you trying to argue that Shuffle purchases are generally very worth it?"
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,zero2exe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:05:08 2015 UTC,"Personally I've used my jewels twice. The first time was for a coin boost to score at the Mega Blastoise competition which really paid off with me getting a Blastoisinite. The second time I spent on a lot of hearts when the manectric safari came out which allowed me to catch everything in a couple hours, still have 17 unspent hearts from that in case another safari pops out. So generally speaking, feel free to use if you feel you need them at the right time."
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,02pheland,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:27:18 2015 UTC,"I used my first 12 to buy coins for extra item full atempts at genescet,  I dont play more then 10-15 hearts a day so grinding at meowth would take me ages to build up enough.   Wont be using my second free 12 unless I somehow get back down to only a few thousand coins and cant afford greatballs any more."
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,MaiKitty,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:29:54 2015 UTC,I say keep 6 and spent six on coins.
PokemonShuffle,3czi8o,Thrormurn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:32:53 2015 UTC,Since you still have a lot of stages to do and S-rank as well as Pokemon to catch i would say spend your jewels on coins. There is noting else useful with them to to after all.

PokemonShuffle,3d1ijh,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"Even to this day with a decent team, I still struggle with beating Mewtwo Y without items when going for random attempts. I got pretty excited myself when beating it itemless. Good job."
PokemonShuffle,3cymwx,SirSmokesAlott,7,Sat Jul 11 23:37:20 2015 UTC,Coins spent on items you cannot get back. The game autosaves the purchase the moment you start the level.   Coins spent on Great Balls are not permanently spent until you've returned to the main map. Those you can get back with resetting.
PokemonShuffle,3cymwx,DBrody6,5,Sun Jul 12 00:47:13 2015 UTC,I bet you didn't know the game subtracts the coins from your total in the shop and you were expecting that to be your total before subtraction. So after the game it was about the same.
PokemonShuffle,3cymwx,VMNC,2,Sun Jul 12 05:38:39 2015 UTC,This is it I did know I've got like 100 hours play but it was early and I definitely got confused. Cheers.
PokemonShuffle,3cymwx,MayorOfChuville,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:51:45 2015 UTC,"Probably not. If you buy power-ups, right before you enter the level, it'll say ""Saving..."" on the top screen"

PokemonShuffle,3cydrx,taijuu,2,Sat Jul 11 22:13:11 2015 UTC,"They don't really do anything. Score doesn't even have an effect on which rank you get.  But the extra combos MIGHT change which Pokemon gets the crown and the double exp (which is based on which Pokemon got the most matches), someone should test that."
PokemonShuffle,3cydrx,icravedanger,2,Sat Jul 11 23:06:09 2015 UTC,Are you sure Scores don't have an effect on what rank you get? I always thought that score = rank and that if you beat Ampharos in let's say 26 turns instead of 25 and got a huge bonus combo you'd still get the S-Rank because you'd get as high a score as you'd have needed even with that one turn's extra bonus points.
PokemonShuffle,3cydrx,KamuKid,2,Sat Jul 11 23:09:36 2015 UTC,"Yes I'm sure. Rank is based only on moves/time remaining. Capture is based on moves remaining discounting the Moves+5. If you're one move over the S-rank requirement, you don't get an S.  But interestingly, S rank is not always ""half the total moves, rounded up"" (sometimes you get more moves), and S-ranking Expert stages always allows you to use more than half the total time."
PokemonShuffle,3cydrx,icravedanger,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:18:29 2015 UTC,"S-ranking is half the stage's base moves rounded down, actually. +5 turns/10 seconds outright give you that much longer to get an S-rank. There's several bizarre exceptions to this rule (Buneary, Meowth, Banette, Renuculus), but otherwise it's consistent for absolutely everything else in the game.  Except Special stages, which demand 60% of the moves remaining (for some reason)."
PokemonShuffle,3cydrx,DBrody6,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:49:51 2015 UTC,So for 11 moves you only get 5 if you want an S? Okay. I believe Haxorus is also an exception.
PokemonShuffle,3cydrx,icravedanger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:30:53 2015 UTC,That's right. And he is also an exception because the level is purposefully designed to be impossible to win before exhausting every turn.
PokemonShuffle,3cydrx,DBrody6,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:32:44 2015 UTC,"Huh. I thought you would have 6, at least some of the time, but until I have proof I won't argue."
PokemonShuffle,3cydrx,icravedanger,2,Sun Jul 12 01:35:45 2015 UTC,"The score is 1:1 the amount of damage you do to a Pokemon. This is something that should be more evident during competitions. S-ranks, with the exception of about five levels, are entirely determined by finishing with at least half the stage's base moves left (rounded down)."
PokemonShuffle,3cydrx,DBrody6,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:52:24 2015 UTC,Ah.
PokemonShuffle,3cydrx,KamuKid,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:18:45 2015 UTC,"You get double XP for the crown!? Damn it, I need to learn the game's mechanics already."
PokemonShuffle,3cydrx,SoftwareJunkie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:49:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the replies on this!
PokemonShuffle,3cydrx,Valkyriess,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:37:54 2015 UTC,"Bonus combos after the Pokemon is defeated does not impact anything. On a side note, I've never heard someone say this, but it is something I have noticed. Combos actually increase the damage done to the opposing pokemon. Example, I have Cincinno and Ninetales both MAX level, so they have Attack Power 80 and 90 respectively. I make a match with my Ninetales (Active/First match) that makes a second match with my Cincinno (Second match). This makes a combo ""2"" and the damage for the 1st match is the same, 90, but for the second match it increases by 10%, so the damage done by Cincinno is 88. If I reverse d the match by make my Cincinno the active match, the damage would be 80, and 99 from Ninetales. Thus by doing pretty much the same move, you can increase your damage, even though in this example its only by 1. In the Ampharos stage, where I grind for EXP, when I'm training a Flying, Steel or Electric type pokemon, (They're all resisted by Electric) since they're damage is halved, I always try to make the weaker pokemon my first match (except in cases where I want abilities to activate) so the 110% damage multiplier happens on the more powerful pokemon. By doing this, I don't need to bring a ground type to deal supereffective damage to balance the not very effective damage, because I still deal enough damage to beat Amphraos, but I always bring Mega-Gengar.  Also getting a high number of combos increases the damage multipler, so the first thershold is 2-10 combos  for 10% extra damage, after that damage gets increased to 15% extra damage* I think, its that or 20%."

PokemonShuffle,3cwc63,NinjaKiwiFruito,15,Sat Jul 11 09:18:39 2015 UTC,"I don't like the sound of that shiny idea, because it pretty much requires you to bring a full item loadout for the more BS stages (Steelix) lest you fail the stage on the one time a shiny Pokemon shows up.  I feel like they're trying to space Shuffle's lifespan out until Gen 7. If we get 45 new Pokemon a month (including events), the game's still good for a little over 10 more months, not counting re-issues or just general dry spells. And then when Gen 7 gets released that'll probably be at least 100 more.  That said, Shuffle's just a game that's designed to go for a while, but not forever. Not sure what they would be able to do to increase the lifespan beyond the Pokedex besides rotate the events back through for those who missed."

PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,Joao_Krakenwagen,3,Sat Jul 11 04:20:47 2015 UTC,Do you  have mega location?
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,Ali-Sama,5,Sat Jul 11 04:41:45 2015 UTC,"I'll just assume your auto-correct messed ""Lucario"" up haha  And yes, I do have it, but Mega Gengar works better because Lucario basically resets the board and doesn't create many combos, while with Mega Gengar I managed to get a 10 hit combo once or twice.  Lucario would be useful if I had to deal with the Ice Disruptions, but they were completely gone thanks to the Disruption Delay"
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,Joao_Krakenwagen,11,Sat Jul 11 05:11:00 2015 UTC,"While M-Gengar is pretty damn good at effortless combo making, you can make combos with M-Lucario just fine if you know what to do.  Lead with a horizontal match that is at least partially, if not entirely, outside of the columns that will be affected by the M-Lucario match. Try to make that match as close to the bottom row if possible. The rigged skyfall from a M-Lucario match is based on a snapshot of the board just a moment before, but because the regular horizontal match you made shifts the rest of the board, the rigged skyfall becomes out of sync and is capable of forming combos. The lower the row of that initial horizontal match, the more likely a combo chain will occur and the longer that chain will be. People think M-Lucario doesn't make combos, but if setup right I've been able to get 20x combos with him on several occasions. Most of the time I can get some combo chain as if it were an average turn. The exception is if you can make a horizontal match of any other Pokemon that doesn't touch the columns M-Lucario will effect, in which case you want to lead with M-Lucario instead (which, anecdotally, has typically lead to better results for me).  If you just make a M-Lucario match and hope something happens then, yeah...combos ain't ever gonna go off. If you know what you're doing, and you get a bit lucky, his rigged patterns can be used to your benefit."
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,DBrody6,2,Sat Jul 11 07:47:54 2015 UTC,"In case anyone comes here for help in the coming days, I beat Arceus using M-Gengar (Max), Lucario (8), Mienshao (8), and Throh (8) also using the Attack+ and Disruption Delay. I beat him with 11 move remaining, and caught him with a regular pokéball with a 25% catch rate.  If you were worried like me, you don't need M-Lucario or even Conk! I grinded my three fighting types for 3 days on Buneary and got them to 8, and it worked for me!"
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,SoftwareJunkie,3,Mon Jul 13 05:11:34 2015 UTC,"I'll use those two items, thanks.. but I'll stick with M Lucario because I don't wanna take any chances."
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,Joao_Krakenwagen,2,Sat Jul 11 04:58:16 2015 UTC,"I must be one of the few that think Mega Lucario is not a good Mega at all :T  I only like it when I need to deal with ice barriers, but besides that I'd rather relly on Gengar because of the combos it creates, even though it was Not Very Effective against Arceus I still managed to S-Rank and capture it with ease.  But anyway, I wish you good luck and I hope you have captured Arceus by now :D"
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,Hylian-Highwind,2,Sat Jul 11 05:14:35 2015 UTC,"I think Lucario is preferable when not using items, since he can remove disruptions compared to Gengar.  Gengar's probably preferable when going for items since there's actually room to combo."
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,JetLagoon,3,Sat Jul 11 05:56:44 2015 UTC,"M-Lucario has its uses. On stages with lots of disruptions or complexity 5 (Aegislash line for example), it's really hard to make combos and you have to depend on pure damage output of a match, and that's what M-Lucario (and similar Megas) is for, clear A LOT disruptions and/or dish out damage per match. In case of Arceus, M-Gengar is only good if using disruption delay, otherwise M-Lucario all the way. I beat Arceus itemless with M-Lucario, 6 turns left and catch him with a great ball."
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,Hylian-Highwind,2,Sat Jul 11 08:08:52 2015 UTC,"I beat it with that team itemless, albeit it after a lot of trial and error.  It basically comes down to either a lucky move or if you have a Disruption Delay, because Arceus's disruptions are flat out borked."
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,pattycaeks,2,Sat Jul 11 05:12:13 2015 UTC,"I caught Arceus itemless at 5% (I know, right?) And my team was Mega Lucario, Conkeldurr, Mienshao, and I switched out the fourth optimized fighter for shaymin to try to trigger sleep.  It probably shouldn't have worked, but it did."
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,NeoAnima31,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:37:13 2015 UTC,"I I used Mlucario MAX, conkeldurr 9, mienshao 7, sawk 7 and disruption delay, mega evolution and Attack power I had 14 moves left andcaught with 31%.I think attack power and disruption delay is a must to beat it"
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,JetLagoon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:47:22 2015 UTC,"Really? My team was the same and I beat it itemless 4 times out of 10, I think. Thank god for the quitting game returning great ball money feature/bug!"

PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,SaveThePatrat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:07:46 2015 UTC,You have a chance conkeldurr is good because of its ability but if you use itemsyou dont even get a chance to activate it
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,Mettie7,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:09:23 2015 UTC,You really only need Attack Power + to have a good chance of beating+catching him.

I, then, decided to go for Mega Gengar (lv 8), Lucario (Max), Conkeldurr (lv 6) and Mienshao (lv 6) and bought every item (except for xp+ and move+) after reading from someone (thanks whoever called it) Mega Gengar + Pummel +3 Fight combo works wonders.  Dude I crushed Arceus so hard I thought my DS would explode. I beat him with 25 moves left (yes, took me 3 moves) and 55% capture chance. Just go for Mega Gengar with Mega Start, Attack Up and Disruption Delay. It should be more than enough to beat it."
PokemonShuffle,3cvprz,valedictions,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:31:27 2015 UTC,I thought my DS would explode.   Holy shit dude you must've beat him pretty hard
PokemonShuffle,3cwe95,giraffe196,2,Sat Jul 11 09:55:46 2015 UTC,Finally caught it today at 14%. Can finally start using Mewtwo over Slowbro for Psychic weak Pokemon
PokemonShuffle,3cwe95,The_Strict_Nein,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:36:00 2015 UTC,I was lucky enough to catch it on the first try. I guess you'll have to keep on trying. At least there isn't a limited number of chances.

PokemonShuffle,3cwe95,Houeclipse,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:40:52 2015 UTC,havent caught it yet either but I never bring an optomised team so that cuts into my % chance
PokemonShuffle,3cwe95,02pheland,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:10:09 2015 UTC,I threw a ton of coins at him and finally got him into a great ball this morning.
PokemonShuffle,3cwe95,serpent-tailed-angel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:05:52 2015 UTC,"I think I caught it on my second weekend it was released, but even my girlfriend and step-daughter still has to catch it to this day. It's not an easy thing to do. (Or they don't believe in the power of the RNGesus)"
PokemonShuffle,3cwe95,gospelexe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:36:52 2015 UTC,Oh I definitely believe in RNGesus cause I caught Arceus with a 17% and I also have Pinsir and Jirachi and Regirock (who were the 3 hardest to get imo). Also those1% catch rates on the EX Stages -(although I'm still trying to get Blaziken and anything after Mewtwo including him). But I think Victini just hates me.
PokemonShuffle,3cwe95,MayorOfChuville,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:02:24 2015 UTC,"It took me a month to catch Victini.  Week 1: It escapes  Week 2: Use ShuffleMove; it escapes again  Week 3: Use ShuffleMove, use 3 Great Balls, it escapes anyways (reset DS to save coins, but lose EXP)  Week 4: Use ShuffleMove, use 3 Great Balls and finally catch it  If you really really want it now, grind Meowth for money so you can use multiple Great Balls, and maybe even power-ups (though Victini's max catch rate is 20%, so if you buy a power-up you're spending 2000/3000g on maybe 2-4%)  The game only offers extra Great Ball chances if you have enough money for more, so try to make sure you have 7500+ when you're going in."
PokemonShuffle,3cwe95,Swithe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:30:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I had enough for 4 but it ran after 1

PokemonShuffle,3ct1sj,idai_puraisu,8,Fri Jul 10 15:22:24 2015 UTC,"I mean, he might be the hardest daily Pokemon this week, but he was still very easy. I beat him with 9 turns left first try with Slowbro, Victini, Mewtwo, and Groudon."
PokemonShuffle,3ct1sj,andersma,7,Fri Jul 10 15:34:43 2015 UTC,Same here. Everytime he spawns himself he got rid of most of the ones from the beginning
PokemonShuffle,3ct1sj,pagit85,-1,Fri Jul 10 16:28:06 2015 UTC,"thx ill try that order, I still blame rng because if I beat him once and cant catch him but since that time I cant even beat him just throwing coins in trash"
PokemonShuffle,3ct1sj,andersma,2,Fri Jul 10 15:42:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did it itemless. Don't bother throwing coins at it."
PokemonShuffle,3ct1sj,aysz88,3,Fri Jul 10 15:47:34 2015 UTC,"I was pretty successful - Slowbro, Mewtwo, Victini, Groudon. 8 or 9 moves left on most tries, once was 5 left.  Focused on breaking the top-right ice to break up the board.  Didn't need Slowbro to mega-evolve most of the time.   either RNG was in my favor or I was lucky   Those are the same thing... :p"
PokemonShuffle,3ct1sj,valedictions,2,Fri Jul 10 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"i lucked out on my first try with mewtwo, victini, groudon and excadrill, but in hindsight the stage should be super easy with slowbro"
PokemonShuffle,3ct1sj,cyberscythe,2,Fri Jul 10 18:13:09 2015 UTC,"I used a team of Mewtwo, Victini, Marowak, and Groudon. The latter two were max level, so I think that really helped  Ended up throwing ten hearts into it; I beat it every time, but failed the cap rate of 33~50% until I finally gave up and used a great ball when it hit max cap rate."
PokemonShuffle,3ct1sj,KamuKid,2,Fri Jul 10 21:51:28 2015 UTC,I've beaten him with 8~10 moves left every time but I can't for the life of me get Arceus to half his HP.. we're like polar opposites.
PokemonShuffle,3ct1sj,WillExis,2,Fri Jul 10 22:23:22 2015 UTC,"For me, Seviper was easy to beat, but slightly annoying to catch. It took three tries. The one I caught him on was with 10 moves left using Slowbro, Victini, Marowak and Groudon. I also used no items."
PokemonShuffle,3ct1sj,DISKFIGHTER2,2,Sat Jul 11 03:17:16 2015 UTC,"Leave as many sevipers as possible, you said it yourself he spawns them so theyre going to clear themselves. next focus on clearing the frozen top right pokemon, these will allow alot more pokemon to drop down than clearning bottom left"
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,LioAlanMessi,16,Fri Jul 10 06:12:16 2015 UTC,Disruption Delay and Attack Power+ got me 13 turns remaining with 29% unboosted chance. I caught with 100% super catch power. Now the god of all pokémon can rot forever unused because of its useless typing.
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,MegaMissingno,2,Fri Jul 10 06:45:17 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much what I did. DD and AP+, 11 turns left with 25% catch, success! Brought M-Lucario (max), Conkeldurr (5), Mienshao (6), and Sawk (6). Did 29888 damage."
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,Mettie7,2,Fri Jul 10 06:49:15 2015 UTC,"I think we'll eventually get formes for all its types, so that Arceus would end up being ridiculously broken (as befits a god)."
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,import_antigravity,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:37:56 2015 UTC,That would be awesome. Imagine Psychic-type Arceus w/ Double Psychic or Fighting-type Arceus w/ Double Fighting.
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,ReddJor,-3,Fri Jul 10 16:35:06 2015 UTC,His DOUBLE NORMAL ability makes it so a NORMAL team is just as powerful as any team...
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,psyducko,8,Fri Jul 10 06:52:28 2015 UTC,"Only if you lead with an Arceus on your move. If you don't, you're inherently doing half as much damage as any super effective team. If you do, somehow, kick off a combo every single move in a level with Arceus, you are AT BEST only equivalent to a super effective team. Normal types just can't compete in this game.  Edit: Also the ability lies, it's actually a 250% power boost instead of straight doubling. Were it to have a 100% activation rate (and it's far from having one), there might be a tiny niche for it."
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,DBrody6,3,Fri Jul 10 07:00:05 2015 UTC,True but this will make it so you can actually build a passable Normal team for once. Especially since his BASE is 90. Which means is Max is probably at least 110 right? That gives you at least some way to start to use Normals and level them up (if you're into leveling everyone up for completion or maybe even because that makes normal-type disruptions deal more damage)
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,butthead,0,Fri Jul 10 14:40:31 2015 UTC,Think of it more as a challenge then?
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,psyducko,7,Fri Jul 10 07:07:46 2015 UTC,"Trying him out, the real challenge seems to be getting the skill to ever activate in the first place :/  Honestly seems to have a ~30% activation rate on 4-tile matches. Kinda ridiculous."
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,DBrody6,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:14:20 2015 UTC,"thats the biggest problem with arceus. if double normal activated every single time, arceus would be usable, but still not super useful. the fact that its ability to help make it useful rarely activates is a huge mistake on their end."
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,valedictions,-4,Fri Jul 10 18:20:23 2015 UTC,You must believe! :) Arceus can't always help...

PokemonShuffle,3crq59,Mettie7,6,Fri Jul 10 06:25:04 2015 UTC,Anyone got a strategy on how to beat it without Mega-Lucario?
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,Lord_Tickleton,4,Fri Jul 10 06:25:43 2015 UTC,"itemless i have no clue, but im sure mega gengar along with disruption delay / attack power + / whatever items they offer would be more than enough"
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,valedictions,2,Fri Jul 10 06:30:21 2015 UTC,what is so good about gengar? He was most used in the last competition
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,ColCyclone,2,Sat Jul 11 00:06:30 2015 UTC,"it takes the least amount of matches to mega evolve out of any mega pokemon, and its ability will remove every single mega gengar on the screen, offering a temporary complexity -1 essentially."

I beat it with 14 moves left, which gives it about a 30% chance of capture. Get Mega Gengar running as soon as possible, then try and trigger Lucario's Pummel ability with each move. Hopefully you'll get a good combo going, but this is a nice alternate strategy."

PokemonShuffle,3crq59,mejjos,6,Fri Jul 10 16:31:15 2015 UTC,"I used DD to make the level not annoying, and an Attack+ to end up with extra moves for the bonus catch rate. 4500 coins is not too bad, and it went very smoothly."
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,icravedanger,5,Fri Jul 10 06:36:53 2015 UTC,"Replying to deleted comment: I had ideal Pokes, M Lucario, Conk, Sawk, Mienshao/Throh, levels 6-7 because I don't level grind. I think the DD is pretty much necessary, because the disruptions really limit your moves and combo potential. And the Attack+ allows for me to finish right after DD wears off, saving me probably 8-10 moves. It's worth it because it barely costs more than a great ball, and it raises my odds by a lot, especially if the first catch fails. And I don't use assist software so I like to make it easier on myself. Moves+5 wouldn't have helped me at all, and Mega Start wouldn't have that much."
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,icravedanger,2,Fri Jul 10 07:13:48 2015 UTC,You can buy DD and Atk+ with coins?
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,StrawberryCake88,2,Fri Jul 10 13:50:10 2015 UTC,You can only buy power ups with coins.

PokemonShuffle,3crq59,Schezoroark,2,Fri Jul 10 06:32:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, kinda frustrated that I forgot yesterday was the last day for Jirachi, I was going to use a great ball and then decided I had another day. Hopefully they bring it back because I haven't missed any mons except Regirock"
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:10:07 2015 UTC,Do I REALLY need to wait for the Meowth Coin map so I can get money to go balls to the wall with items? I can only barely get through itemless with 2 moves left.
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,misty_lax,3,Fri Jul 10 06:43:36 2015 UTC,"Well, there's also the Stage 37 Meowth if you don't want to keep throwing attempts in the dark."

PokemonShuffle,3crq59,Hobocannibal,2,Fri Jul 10 07:27:10 2015 UTC,why +5 Moves?
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,CvxFous,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:14:04 2015 UTC,probably wanted to S-rank the stage.

PokemonShuffle,3crq59,StrawberryCake88,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:36:28 2015 UTC,Had the extra coins so did the +5 moves for the S rank.
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,PineappleSlices,-1,Sat Jul 11 05:32:10 2015 UTC,aids in the capture rate. That's what i did to get Jirachi.
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,StrawberryCake88,5,Fri Jul 10 13:36:54 2015 UTC,+5 doesn't add to the capture rate.

PokemonShuffle,3crq59,giraffe196,4,Fri Jul 10 14:23:11 2015 UTC,+5 does NOT increase capture rate  The bonus moves from using a Jewel DOES increase capture rate.

PokemonShuffle,3crq59,grilledtomato,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:02:51 2015 UTC,Mega slowbro isn't a bad choice either especially if it is maxed
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,TheRealTravisClous,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:05:13 2015 UTC,Tried it with Mega Slowbro itemless. Obviously it was a fail because of all the ice blocks lol. Perhaps M-Slowbro with disruption delay would be better?  A bit confused as to what to do as I'm saving up coins for Arceus but I think I'll have to save up more for M-Lucario. Does M-Lucario need items?
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,grilledtomato,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:01:04 2015 UTC,"DD would be good, I already have mega luc and I got it the first time around, as long as you can get luc easily arceus should be a lot easier"
PokemonShuffle,3crq59,Harryhaz1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:26:04 2015 UTC,Hm yeah I think I'll try to catch Arceus first. Is M-Lucario hard to get? Missed it both times.

But definitely any form of -1 Complexity makes him a joke.  -1 Complx, Mega Ampharos to have more spread over eliminating disruptions, and 3 of any fighting types. I just have low level fighting types at the time, so I figure any other fighting pokemon any of you might have would be even better.  Seriously, $5 just for this guy. Don't feel compelled to do the same. I dont think anyone could make me feel right about this purchase. Especially when he is so useless. I should never spend money on a game like this. no more than $1 at most."

Mega Gengar and Lucario (lv max), Meinshao(lv5) and Pangoro (lv 3) used Attack boost and DD. honestly could've raised my last two mons levels more but I got bored with grinding levels. Had enough coins for 3 great balls but didn't even need them. All I have left is 25 stages to S rank so it's back to coin grinding for me until the next batch of special stages."
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,skippingmud,16,Fri Jul 10 07:06:59 2015 UTC,WHY? A third time? Seems like many of the new stages - having a MEGA Lucario is helpful; so I guess they just want to make sure everyone gets him.
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,psyducko,7,Fri Jul 10 07:09:21 2015 UTC,"It really is, though. No other mega is strong against Normal- and Steel- types, and its clearing power is amazing. It may not be the best for combos, but it's definitely one of the top megas we have."

PokemonShuffle,3cruog,elleotribal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:27:39 2015 UTC,They should bring Pinsir back and at the same time the competion for the Pinsirite.
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,valedictions,4,Fri Jul 10 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"awesome for those who missed out on lucario, but the only mega i dont have is mega banette... why cant we bring them both back together Smh  also i guess it's important to note that it will be turn based again (20 turns it looks like)"
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,elleotribal,6,Fri Jul 10 07:57:39 2015 UTC,What about the prizes for those who already have the Lucarionite? Jewels? Mega Speed Up?
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,jacob717,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:44:55 2015 UTC,That's an interesting point. Usually most people are fine to just throw away competitions for megas they ready have but if the speedups become the norm then I'm sure everyone will be trying to get those and keep some of the new players from getting the mega stone.
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,elleotribal,5,Fri Jul 10 15:53:09 2015 UTC,"They should run a separate competition. It could be like the weekly Meowth (not avaible to capture), something like a shiny version of a pokémon that already exists in the game (maybe the shiny Genesect that's already in the game data?). The prizes could be something like 1 Jewel, 2 Jewels and 1 Mega SpeedUp."
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,Hylian-Highwind,11,Fri Jul 10 18:05:07 2015 UTC,"Dear lord, the 3rd time?  Well, free jewel I guess, but what about bringing back Banette or something?  The timing's especially bizarre since the contest would end after/the same time Arceus disappears."
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,Hylian-Highwind,7,Fri Jul 10 07:09:00 2015 UTC,"Arceus event ends on the 24th, actually, while the competition ends on the 20th. That gives the people who still don't have it four days to take on Arceus with Mega Lucario!"
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,Hylian-Highwind,0,Fri Jul 10 07:11:15 2015 UTC,Really? Huh.  I guess I forgot it starts Monday because Jirachi left early
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,Houeclipse,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:12:42 2015 UTC,"No, I mean Jirachi leaving early threw off my sense of time, so I forgot the event started in 4 days (when I made that comment) as opposed to a full week after."

PokemonShuffle,3cruog,kalosstone,7,Fri Jul 10 07:09:53 2015 UTC,if they do it will be very hard for new people to get the stone

PokemonShuffle,3cruog,psyducko,3,Fri Jul 10 15:13:56 2015 UTC,Having Mega Lucario would be sooo useful right now =\  Glad I'll finally have a chance at one.    Anyone know if it'll be a timed or turn based event?
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,MegaMissingno,2,Sat Jul 11 12:22:21 2015 UTC,Repeat competitions are using turn based.
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,valedictions,2,Fri Jul 10 15:57:04 2015 UTC,I glanced through the Japanese site but I did not find a mention of any extra rewards like Mega Speedups. I believe it'll play out similarly to the earlier repeat but it's not too outlandish to say that it will most likely offer extra goodies to those who rank really high or already have the stone.
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,tebbi123,0,Fri Jul 10 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"i hope it doesnt offer any extra goodies to people who place high, because if they offer a mega speedup or something, its just going to encourage people who already have the mega stone to rank high and prevent someone who doesnt have the mega stone from even being in the rankings."
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,tgJester,2,Fri Jul 10 08:55:40 2015 UTC,"I never even saw the mega Lucario event the first couple times, I'm pretty sure I actually missed a lot of events, so this is really nice that I can get a chance at getting it."
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,mejjos,2,Sat Jul 11 07:53:35 2015 UTC,Oh thank goodness.  As a newer player with a completionist attitude I am so excited about these event repeats.

Serebii seems to suggest it was timed, then turn based on the two iterations so far?  Basically, should I be training pokemon with a specific ability or just go with optimize?"
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:03:08 2015 UTC,"I think in NA about 120k ppl did the last M-Luc competition, but between the 2 attempts at most 50K stones would have been given out (probably substantially less depending on how many went after the 2 jewels).  So theres still alot of individuals that have tried for the stone in the past and failed to get it, as well as new players to the game. Given how useful the Fighting type is to the game this is a good thing, especially given how many threads pop up over how to attempt levels where the person does have the stone yet."
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,IcyWolfosKelsos,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:30:53 2015 UTC,"I'm all for Fighting Megas, but Lucario's isn't a particularly combo conducive ability compared to stuff like Aerodactyl, Gengar, or Mewtwo."

PokemonShuffle,3cruog,ThorAxe911,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:45:09 2015 UTC,I really hope i get it!! What are the recommended team comps to do well on his stage so I can start training up?
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,ThorAxe911,-1,Sat Jul 11 04:44:15 2015 UTC,Aren't these events all about getting high scores and stuff? So I would assume the same team comp doesn't apply here as when catching lucario. Smartass.
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,ThorAxe911,-1,Fri Jul 10 21:21:56 2015 UTC,"Holy shit dude, did you know that there are stages AFTER you catch lucario so your team comp could IMPROVE after you originally caught him? Fuck off."
PokemonShuffle,3cruog,ThorAxe911,0,Sat Jul 11 21:49:44 2015 UTC,I don't have the answers. I wouldn't have asked if I did. I haven't caught every pokemon so I don't know if I should be focusing on specific expert stages or just advancing further in the main puzzles to capture specific pokemon that would net me the best results for this event.

PokemonShuffle,3cuq5r,drumsoverbogota,7,Fri Jul 10 23:00:07 2015 UTC,I feel like such an idiot. I can't believe I didn't realize that. I've been grinding for coins on Meowth and my team doesn't have a Mega Pokemon on it.
PokemonShuffle,3cuq5r,Alimagdi,3,Fri Jul 10 23:05:46 2015 UTC,"It's okay man, we all make mistakes!"
PokemonShuffle,3cuq5r,valedictions,5,Sat Jul 11 03:41:05 2015 UTC,you arent able to purchase a mega start if you dont have a pokemon who can mega evolve in the 1st slot. that's probably the case i'd assume.
PokemonShuffle,3cskct,elpuente93,4,Fri Jul 10 12:52:08 2015 UTC,Setting up a team for Lucarionite competition?
PokemonShuffle,3cskct,elleotribal,2,Fri Jul 10 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"Victini is the only other Psychic type with higher than base 60 power so using a full Psychic team compromises some power. Personally I like to stick to what optimise gives me: Mega Mewtwo, Victini, Groudon and Slowbro. The last one of course being the one most substitutable for one with a better ability. Two Psychics is sufficient enough to get combos going but once we get a new base 70/80 Psychic, a full Psychic team will most likely be (even) more optimal."
PokemonShuffle,3cskct,MegaMissingno,2,Fri Jul 10 13:10:46 2015 UTC,"I prefer to go with M-Mewtwo, 2 support psychics(Victini and Slowbro normally) and 1 non-psychic pokemon. When you have one of a different type since it never gets removed by Mewtwo they tend to accumulate at the bottom of the board and trigger more combos as as the match progresses.  Full psychic I find you remove each eventually so you don't get that concentration of one icon on the board, only 1 support psychic you remove that  icon from the board and that limits M-Mewtwos power IMO.  Of course this all goes the same for Bannette and ghosts."
PokemonShuffle,3cqksk,growlgrrl,4,Thu Jul 9 23:52:52 2015 UTC,Braviary might be a better choice than Heatran since it can empower its own and Salamence's damage and is only 10 power lower than Heatran whose ability will only activate at the end of the round.

PokemonShuffle,3cplkk,markhawker,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:54:32 2015 UTC,"it already works really well with mawile, assuming the skill procs, but mawile tends to be very limited use nowadays as lucario typically does her job for most players."
PokemonShuffle,3cplkk,markhawker,-1,Sat Jul 11 03:10:39 2015 UTC,"If this is true then I'm upset now. It says the event was the 6th through the 10th which indicates you can try again on the 10th (that's how society uses dates.) They better bring back Jirachi again because this is the first time I don't have every Pokemon, and I'm guessing it will be months before I can try to get Jirachi again. (Bring back Pinsir for those who don't have it!)"
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,markhawker,11,Thu Jul 9 22:48:22 2015 UTC,"I really like this game so I'd love to catch all 720 plus all the Megas. Also I feel when the next 6th/7th gen games come out, the new Megas/ forms/ Pokemon could easily be added in."
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,giraffe196,7,Thu Jul 9 23:03:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, that'd be a lot! The developers need to eat, you know. ;)"
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,Infinitedaw,5,Thu Jul 9 23:07:11 2015 UTC,"They do need to eat but many assets are taken from the previous match 3 game Pokemon Battle Trozei. Not to mention the game doesn't have 3d effect and the physical buttons on the 3ds don't have any functionality. This is all for the mobile release soon, where they'll make tons of money from the microtransactions."
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,valedictions,0,Fri Jul 10 14:09:44 2015 UTC,"They are, with an effect added. However, levels need to be designed, tested, added to the build, localised, released etc. Not to say that's expensive but it certainly isn't free and if people aren't paying for jewels then they'll end up in the red soon enough. Though, of course, if people continue to pay then it'll continue."
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,skippingmud,6,Fri Jul 10 14:20:59 2015 UTC,"the only thing i wish is that they had a focus on both recurring content and new content - like say this week if they brought back the kyogre event and introduced a new event, or would bring back old daily pokemon and introduced new ones. i think with this kind of game its important to not really have ""one chance only forever"" events because youre always wanting to introduce new people to the game and they dont want to miss out on stuff. i'll keep playing until it stops being updated though, its a really fun game."
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,JetLagoon,3,Fri Jul 10 06:39:57 2015 UTC,"I ideally want it to extend until all Pokemon (and forms/Megas) are obtainable, although I do know that's gonna take a long time. The way the game is structured, though, it isn't made to be something you start and finish, but something you can just keep coming back to. And I think they're doing a good job so far in doing just that."
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,JetLagoon,3,Fri Jul 10 00:40:51 2015 UTC,It's a F2P game with microtransactions. Games like that rarely end unless number of players are so few. They need to constantly add new things to keep us interested and I hope some of those are dual types and a higher level limit.
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,elleotribal,-1,Fri Jul 10 03:57:05 2015 UTC,"You don't Pokemon Rumble World, then? ;)"
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,Mettie7,5,Fri Jul 10 06:38:07 2015 UTC,I did play it for a few days but got uninterested quickly. I don't recall it was added new contents on a basis like Shuffle though.
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,02pheland,5,Fri Jul 10 11:28:54 2015 UTC,"It's very hard to have fun on Pokemon Rumble World without buying stuff with real money. You need a Jewel for every important thing on the game (mega stones, teach powerful moves, unlock new areas), the ballons take too much time to recover (and they usually land at the wrong place) and you're not even able to 'level up' your pokémon. I mean, there's nothing much to do on the game to begin with (other then collecting poké-toys)."
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,Hylian-Highwind,2,Fri Jul 10 12:08:43 2015 UTC,"For a 100% free game I'm pretty happy with it. A lot of the Pokemon we already caught have mega stones so there's definitely more content for a while! I'd be pretty happy to continue playing this till everything is released, imo"
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,Swithe,2,Fri Jul 10 00:47:25 2015 UTC,"Id like it to go to the full list but the problem I already see with it is more and more newer stages requiring items to S rank, eventually if they keep up the increasing difficulty we will need items to just beat sages.  I like the more puzzle stages where a set move or type of move is required, I know someone will just post the solution for everyone to copy but its better then just throwing more HP and more disruptions over and over till its too much."
PokemonShuffle,3cqcs7,pattycaeks,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:30:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like they want to keep this game supported for a while longer, especially with it being offered to the ""proper"" audience with the mobile port that might be more inclined to pay a bit.  I feel like the wealth of content they could make means they'll keep it going for a while, since, as you noted, new stages aren't too tricky to make."
PokemonShuffle,3cosed,Lopoiy,3,Thu Jul 9 15:52:16 2015 UTC,"We also have his Type/Power/Ability.. which is pretty darn appealing, but then again nobody really uses Normal types. Maybe it's time for the reign of Snorlax and Persian with Arceus around..!?"
PokemonShuffle,3cosed,KamuKid,3,Thu Jul 9 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's time for the reign of Snorlax and Persian with Arceus around..!?   Nobody with common sense will ever use Normal types still. You either use super effective types which do double damage on demand, or you use Arceus and some normal types who are 100% reliant on being able to match Arceus every single turn just to have the same damage bonus. Not even higher, just the same as super effectiveness.  The only time Normals will ever, ever be good is if a weekly event involves inverse battles, and who knows if they ever intend on doing such a thing."
PokemonShuffle,3cosed,DBrody6,3,Thu Jul 9 17:00:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, yeah we know. Unfortunate that Normals are so weak when some of them are peoples' favourite Pokémon :c"
PokemonShuffle,3cosed,KamuKid,2,Thu Jul 9 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"In the main game they are useful, but Pokemon Shuffle doesn't really focus on defensive properties of pokemon as much as the offensive utility of pokemon types."

PokemonShuffle,3clrqp,MayorOfChuville,3,Thu Jul 9 00:39:55 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, S-ranking the stages after the first 150 counts towards getting Genesect. If you S-rank a couple of those you can skip the really hard ones within the first 150. You'll probably still need to go back, though, since Greninja requires 200 S-ranks"
PokemonShuffle,3clrqp,skippingmud,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:18:26 2015 UTC,"This method isn't working for me, I have every stage completed up to Mega Heracross with well over 20 S ranks above the original 150 and still don't have it unlocked"
PokemonShuffle,3clrqp,valedictions,3,Thu Jul 9 00:38:02 2015 UTC,"You need 180 to unlock the Genesect stage, so if you've done 20 out of the 60 additional stages, you'll still need quite a few to unlock it. The guides made by /u/DrWeeGee can at least help you with the last 30 stages (one's stickied right now, and it has links to their other guides)."

PokemonShuffle,3clrqp,giraffe196,2,Thu Jul 9 01:50:08 2015 UTC,"your go-to solution for s ranking ""harder"" stages is usually +5 moves, mega start (if youre using anything that'd take more than 3 mega speedups), and disruption delay. you dont need complexity -1 for any megas except for maybe mega heracross and mega aerodactyl. i mean, you dont necessarily need them for those two, but the rng is too stingy for those levels i find. i feel like with skarmory, gengar and toxicroak you'd be able to get by with a +5 moves though."

PokemonShuffle,3chcfo,Rez91,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:34:41 2015 UTC,"True, but I'm just starting to learn to do Meowth and I'd have a better chance at getting 200 than hoping for 330 or 550."
PokemonShuffle,3cfyzk,grilledtomato,4,Tue Jul 7 16:46:10 2015 UTC,"The ones you listed are very valuable pokémon that you'll be using in the endgame (other than Absol unless it gets a good mega) so you're on the correct course. Make sure to use these pokémon and avoid giving experience to weaker pokémon since you'll ditch almost everything at 60 base power or lower towards the end. Meowth stage (37) is great for grinding coins for items and you should always try to aim at least four coins to get the best results. Since we don't get new main stages that often, you'll catch up in no time."
PokemonShuffle,3cfyzk,MegaMissingno,3,Tue Jul 7 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"Also, they've been pretty good about recycling event-exclusive pokemon to give new players a chance to get them. Only real issue is that they've introduced mega-speedups as a reward so now you still have to compete with everyone who already has those megas."
PokemonShuffle,3cfyzk,flounder19,2,Tue Jul 7 19:31:15 2015 UTC,Hopefully they don't do that for repeats.

But it's hard to compete in the rankings. But still, I'll keep motivated and do my best.   You'll catch up pretty fast to be able to succeed in most EX stages. It'll help to catch the event pokémon."

Not only a title 'I did X'. Also as I asked before (Just joking, don't take it serious) this could be done with the help of ShuffleMove, a program that tells you what's the best move in every situation.

PokemonShuffle,3cf6hg,gospelexe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:14:34 2015 UTC,Can't believe this got downvoted but uh.. Shufflemove is a program created to help people playing Pokemon Shuffle and it gives you the best move possible once you input how the board looks. It's frowned upon by some and used by the others. I myself only used it for Meowth (Sunday) since I personally would feel a type of way if I beat stages through said method and not through my own skill.
PokemonShuffle,3cf6hg,valedictions,3,Tue Jul 7 15:34:53 2015 UTC,"fyi, most likely the reason he got downvoted isn't what he said, but how he said it. Rather than asking politely, or even just asking he said ""What the fuck is Shufflemove??"" with two question marks as well. It just comes across as crude, and rude."
PokemonShuffle,3cf6hg,Hylian-Highwind,-3,Wed Jul 8 05:58:42 2015 UTC,I don't see how that was rude. I always ask like that on english boards or chats if I have absolutly no clue. Nobody ever said that it is impolite or rude in 5 years.

PokemonShuffle,3cf6hg,elleotribal,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:46:29 2015 UTC,"the only thing that really makes the stage hard is how much health heracross has. the disruptions are the easiest any mega boss has had in a long time (hell i'd say theyre easier than mega mawile), but heracross just has so much health that its difficult to beat even with good combos.  i think i beat it itemless with a similar team."
PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,KyuubiReddit,12,Tue Jul 7 13:53:54 2015 UTC,"this game is designed for the time limit. there isn't much to it.  you need to wait to play and need to wait for contests and updates, it's a wait based game"
PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,Fenor,5,Tue Jul 7 15:12:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, although that said, I would jump an a chance to buy unlimited hearts. What I would really like is to be able to upgrade your max number of hearts to 10 or so. I haven't spent a penny on this game despite hundreds of hours played, simply because you get so little for your money. It's a joke. But I would gladly pay $10+ for extra hearts."
PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,bogaboy,2,Tue Jul 7 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"I would love if they implemented a way to extend the amount of regenerating hearts.  Also I wouldn't want unlimited lives, however if they implemented the 2 hours of unlimited lives like Candy Crush sometimes has, I'd buy it for this game (I haven't bought the Candy Crush one cause if you beat the world, you need to pay to unlock the next one, since normally you wait a week and it unlocks).  With that, can you imagine how much Meowth or Ampharos grinding you could accomplish?"

PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,MexicanGameboy,2,Wed Jul 8 16:49:05 2015 UTC,"doesn't it make the design bad though?  free-to-play is supposed to make you want to pay to play more... but if you do, you're likely to lose interest in the game."
PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,Fenor,6,Thu Jul 9 05:46:08 2015 UTC,on a free platform? yes. on a platform you paid? it will make you take that console in your hands and eventually play more retail games while you wait yours 2.5 hr
PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,andersma,6,Fri Jul 10 20:26:57 2015 UTC,"I think this would be great as a $20 eShop game. When I first started the game, I was frustrated by how many levels I had to do and all the waiting that went with it. Now that I'm caught up, it's just me beating the update, daily Pokemon, EX stages that I might have missed, and whatever other event is going on.   If they took out hearts and left coins as an in-game currency (that you couldn't pay for), it would still be a lot of fun to me. It would probably be better even.  I've always hated when they added new EX stages especially because your hearts go by in literally 5 minutes and then you wait 2 1/2 hours for another 5 minutes of play. It's stupid.   Tldr; The hearts made the game worse for me in the beginning and they're kind of annoying in the end game. I'd be happier just buying the game outright and having to grind for coins."
PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,Zekrom-9,5,Sat Jul 11 02:40:15 2015 UTC,"If the game wasn't free-to-play, that would also mean the game would actually be finished. Meaning we didn't have to wait weeks for new stages to be added. Every Pokémon would be in the game, meaning there would be more than 800 stages to play. And they could still have the Special Stages for events and competitions. To me, a finished game with no half-an-hour-of-waiting per stage would be really appriciated."
PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,icravedanger,2,Tue Jul 7 15:15:26 2015 UTC,"How many times do you think you'll need to play Stage 37 to beat all 800 stages with an S-rank, and do you think that is acceptable for a paid game?"
PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,awkwardsoul,3,Tue Jul 7 15:22:27 2015 UTC,"The fun for me is the new content, competitions and special events that happen regularly. If they didn't have time released hearts they'd have to have new content more often."
PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,drumsoverbogota,2,Tue Jul 7 16:15:24 2015 UTC,"Indeed part of the fun is the limit, I could play M-Heracross stage all day until I got luckily a move that let me make an HUGE combo and then S-rank everything"
PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,eggstacy,2,Tue Jul 7 16:17:46 2015 UTC,"well i don't play Trozei, so probably not. but if they stopped releasing updates i'd stop playing this too. only reason i play a few times a day is to keep my coins up for new content, then leveling up the new pokemon."
PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,beardedpancakes,2,Wed Jul 8 07:09:46 2015 UTC,"What I'm wondering is if months down the road, when they see their numbers drop, if they'll offer a $19.99 package which will allow players to access all pokes (ie: limited run pokes/mega stones and add in all the missing pokemon that have yet to be released at that point) for one big payout before the game dies and for some last minute hype for the freemium jewels.  The game is ~5 months old now, and we're barely 1/3 through the list (720, not including pokemon like Rotom which increase that total) not to mention, we've really only gotten about 100 pokemon during that time, because we had access to 150 + EX stages at launch.  So, we're getting about 20 pokemon a month, and with ~500 to go, it would take 2 years to get every pokemon at this pace. Not to say that they're going to continue releasing this slowly, but it will be hard to keep peoples attention for even another year.  I mean, I've been playing since launch, have caught every poke, and have (to my knowledge) never missed a check in since, but I don't know if I'll be that passionate about catching 'em all in December. I have to admit that the slow rollout has kept me interested, but how long can you keep players interested?"
PokemonShuffle,3cfc00,WTFmane,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:11:48 2015 UTC,"If they keep sprinkling in different kinds of stages like the Giratina escalation battle, I think long-time players will be content.

PokemonShuffle,3celu1,FirePosition,14,Tue Jul 7 08:43:01 2015 UTC,"Manectric's ability is less random and a bit more combo conducive, and his Damage Streak ability mitigates the power difference somewhat compared to Ampharos's useless Dancing Dragons."
PokemonShuffle,3celu1,Hylian-Highwind,3,Tue Jul 7 10:30:31 2015 UTC,Dancing Dragons... I don't understand what use the designers ever envisioned that would have on Ampharos
PokemonShuffle,3celu1,pagit85,5,Tue Jul 7 21:14:43 2015 UTC,"He is ofc evolving faster and gives more combos tbh. His normal form also has a great ability, which makes him stronger than Ampharos in my eyes. You can plan combos better because the lightning isn't random."
PokemonShuffle,3celu1,Paul648,3,Tue Jul 7 10:00:49 2015 UTC,Ampharos is stronger Manectric is better for some stage (Braviary and Salamence) but do not work well on some (Milotic)
PokemonShuffle,3celu1,misty_lax,2,Tue Jul 7 10:12:31 2015 UTC,I feel like Ampharos would be better on the more disruption heavy stages but I haven't used Manectric all that much yet.
PokemonShuffle,3celu1,KamuKid,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:37:36 2015 UTC,I've been grinding it along with other newly-captured Pokemon on the Ampharos stage and I gotta say Manectric is badass.  Hitting Streak is extremely useful in tandem with other Hitting Streak mons and its lightning clear is a lot more predictable than Ampharos' completely random one. I'll definitely be using it in the next timed battle if M-Gengar isn't a better option.
PokemonShuffle,3celu1,WTFmane,2,Wed Jul 8 06:58:45 2015 UTC,"I prefer Manectric > Ampharos because of its more useful ability. The hitting streak makes up for the minimal difference in base damage, and it evolves slightly faster. He's my go-to Electric mega, for now :p"
PokemonShuffle,3celu1,4dazan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:54:24 2015 UTC,"Manectric's ability is more vertically linear than Ampharos who is more random.  Essentially it is a straighter, but weaker Ampharos.  I feel as though their combo potential is very similar, but I feel the strength and clearing ability of Ampharos is superior."
PokemonShuffle,3celu1,giraffe196,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:55 2015 UTC,I love him. :>

PokemonShuffle,3celu1,kxr,10,Tue Jul 7 14:45:02 2015 UTC,He was in the Safari. If you didn't get him during the Safari event (which ended at the same time) you have to wait for him to come back in Safari or an event to get him
PokemonShuffle,3ceh9q,psyducko,5,Tue Jul 7 07:36:25 2015 UTC,"mega heracross will end up being very useful against pokemon with vertical disruptions, such as ice columns or metal blocks or anything like that. its a bit harder to use its ability because pokemon shuffle is a game where the pokemon fall from the top of the screen, so its ability wont ever remove anything above it. mega slowbro could never remove anything to the side of it, but that wasnt so much a problem as pokemon dont spawn from the sides (unless theyre disruptions)"
PokemonShuffle,3ceh9q,valedictions,7,Tue Jul 7 08:24:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed that. If the M-Heracross is next to a wall, it doesn't do anything. But it's the same for any M-Slowbro at the top of the puzzle."
PokemonShuffle,3ceh9q,Zekrom-9,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:49:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think M-Slowbro does add icons above the puzzle, which then falls down once the column decreases. Or maybe I've just been very lucky at that?"

PokemonShuffle,3ceh9q,Hylian-Highwind,6,Wed Jul 8 03:02:28 2015 UTC,I have not tried Mega Heracross that much but it's funny how activating a burst of them seems to go back and forth like crazy. And I'm having a lot of trouble taking Mega Heracross's face seriously.
PokemonShuffle,3ceh9q,ElementUser,2,Tue Jul 7 13:41:42 2015 UTC,"I think his mega icon looks awesome hah, haven't used him in a stage to see him chain much yet. Coin farm life..."
PokemonShuffle,3ceh9q,bogaboy,2,Tue Jul 7 16:32:30 2015 UTC,"Slowbro used to be my go-to Mon for Megas since, like you said, its extremely explosive in power. My issue with it nowadays is that many stages have become disruption heavy and the requirement of having a lot of connected slowbro's on screen is beginning to seem like a struggle. This makes M2's stock rise in my eyes since it works effectively no matter the board state and is increasing in power as more powerful psychics appear.   Heracross is similar, but has a stronger typing. The only other anti-grass Mega is Glalie which is weak and takes a long time to get going. Its ability has similar use when it megas as well meaning it slots in without any real loss."
PokemonShuffle,3ceh9q,CKMo,2,Tue Jul 7 08:08:01 2015 UTC,"Gengar removes itself, Mewtwo and Bannette removes same type and Aero removes disruption;   Gengar - I feel is a good bet, because he usually can make combos because he is like a C-1;   Mewtwo and Bannette requires bringing in a poke with same type; usually works - but sucks with their SLOW mega speed. We don't really have that many strong ghost and psychic either. But they recently added Giratina and Victini :)  Aero - works great when there is disruptions, but so may time I am left with so many M-Aero and no disruption.   Haven't used M-Heracross that many times, but so far haven't done much COMBO yet; I feel like it's harder to plan.   Like you said, the typing is cool... just not sure how to use him just yet."

PokemonShuffle,3cdnar,Zekrom-9,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:21:43 2015 UTC,"But they'll probably be used on Pokémon like Arceus who already have a base of 90 and them boom, 120 out of nowhere."

I'm really inclined to spend them on Aerodactyl though, but what makes me not do it is the fact that when I need Mega-Aero the most is on stages where a Mega Start would also be a must."
PokemonShuffle,3cbsi4,Joao_Krakenwagen,5,Mon Jul 6 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"I used one on Gengar because of how often he is used, but I'm thinking the same with Aerodactyl. His mega effect is so good and on levels that he's needed, it can be hard to make enough matches to get it without coins."

PokemonShuffle,3cbsi4,icravedanger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:57:21 2015 UTC,What was your score?  So that I know the general cutoff for next time.
PokemonShuffle,3cbsi4,giraffe196,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:13:27 2015 UTC,I think the cutoff was around 35000 or so.
PokemonShuffle,3cbsi4,icravedanger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:58:22 2015 UTC,Idk. I had a score of 37.5k and was only at rank 2300 U.S.  So I'm thinking the cutoff was lower than that.
PokemonShuffle,3cbsi4,digikari4691,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:44:13 2015 UTC,"No, you're assuming the data is linear when it is not. For example, there are very few people who scored between 40k-45k, while many scored between 32-37k, and a very large number of people scored 10k-15k. It's a normal distribution and standard deviation type thing, although it isn't really normally distrbuted. I'm almost sure that the cutoff is above 34000 and I'm certain than it was above 33000. If I had to guess, I would say it is closer to 36,000. Maybe 35600. I got 37700 myself."

PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,Joao_Krakenwagen,5,Mon Jul 6 06:41:22 2015 UTC,"That's probably why Genesect has that same ability - so when Heracross evolves, you still have a bug to do Crowd Control and wreck house."
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,WTFmane,3,Mon Jul 6 07:51:10 2015 UTC,"Just to add on - The added M-Heracross icons are added in the order left-to-right, then top-to-bottom. I.e. top left, then top right, then bottom left, then bottom right. This is diagonally flipped from slowbro, which was top left, then bottom left, then top right, then bottom right.  Yes, its a small difference, but it will cause a huge difference in large chains."

Wynaut (30), Braviary (70) and Hippowdon (60) are pieces of cake.   In Braviary you even get to see Manectric mega because of all the combos you can make."

PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,fresh816163,2,Mon Jul 6 06:22:40 2015 UTC,Do we only get 10 gold per stage beyond the first now? Something I noticed.
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,fresh816163,3,Mon Jul 6 06:30:15 2015 UTC,Repeating special stages has always been 10 coins. Main stages are 30.

S-ranked the first two (Weavile and Hippowdon) quite easy (+5 moves helped). But shouldn't keep waiting for new stages to get S-ranked for the EX...   SOMEONE MAKE A GUILD TO S-RANK 201-210 :)
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,WTFmane,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:56:19 2015 UTC,"If any info pops up, I'll add it.  And let me know if one shows up, I could link it."
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,MikoUK,2,Mon Jul 6 06:57:45 2015 UTC,"Just beat Avalugg with no items, A-rank. In the first half of the battle, he only does that 1-row ice disruption (milotic throwback anyone? /shudders) IF you fail to combo. And since ice makes it harder, you'll only dig yourself into a deeper pit as you go. Make sure to combo and he won't disrupt you. Second half uses the timer, and he freezes 3-4 blocks at random - much, much more manageable. M-lucario recommended, but no need to use items."
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,Fenor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:09:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, on my first attempt I accidentally brought Pokemon that weren't super effective, and it turned into a nightmare pretty quickly. Second attempt, though, using optimized Pokemon, I got an itemless S-Rank, so overall I suppose I don't mind the stage after all : P"
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,NoctusNoctowl,2,Mon Jul 6 08:54:44 2015 UTC,"I recommend bringing Mega Aerodactal to Braviary, its disruption turns the top 2 rows into wooden blocks. It also has a rather large health pool, so mega starting may be needed. (I only passed it due to a miracle on the last move, comboing 3/4th of its health with 0 moves.) It has a 5% base catch rate."
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,Joao_Krakenwagen,2,Mon Jul 6 07:13:50 2015 UTC,"+5 makes S-rank easy; but yeah, catch rate sucked. I'll come back to catch it later. Ironic because yesterday was the 4th of July. Heh."
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,Joao_Krakenwagen,2,Mon Jul 6 07:16:47 2015 UTC,I brought Manectric just to finally use his MEGA.
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,PaintThing,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:18:07 2015 UTC,"I Mega Started M-Aero and S-Ranked this stage in 2 moves. If your Aerodactyl is max level, the first move will do a whopping ~1200 damage, then, since it's a 3-Pokemon stage, let the combos do the work for you.  Unfortunately, the catch rate for this thing is abysmal. I lucked out and got a super catch at 68%."
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,LioAlanMessi,2,Mon Jul 6 07:42:26 2015 UTC,"@Hylian-Highwind the Stage 202 strat' is good, but it's better to do the switch one in, so you're making matches of three and not four, then when the other side is frozen next turn, you can clear all of those frozen blocks as well, which you can't do if you've made matches of four on your first turn"
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,zero2exe,2,Mon Jul 6 09:46:33 2015 UTC,Mega Heracross is a mayor pain in the ass. it have lot of health and disruptions. M-aero is mandatory (other than super effective). still have to beat him.
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:31:15 2015 UTC,"Man, this Jirachi stage is going to be a pain.  It seems odd to me that Tepig gets a devoted stage... is that just me? Maybe that's just me.  Wynaut, the first new Daily, has a base 30 Attack Power and has the ability Stabilize.   EDIT: Ah, I see. Tepig is a predecessor to Pignite, which will inevitably lead to Emboar. Makes a bit more sense now."
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,MegaMissingno,2,Mon Jul 6 06:09:19 2015 UTC,On the Tepig's notice it says Pignite is coming on another event  on August. Maybe that's how they are gonna give away all Unova Starters and maybe their final form won't come on Expert Stages like how the Kanto and Hoenn Initials' did
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,zero2exe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:19:48 2015 UTC,"Might be, though even with 2 weeks, Tepig ends 10 days before August. Wonder what'll be in the interrim if that wasn't an error."

PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:31:01 2015 UTC,"Jirachi has a decent catch rate, so I say use items and make that chance count, because waiting is just going to be tedious and the disruptions are enough to eat through more turns than I think worth it."
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,psyducko,2,Mon Jul 6 06:11:39 2015 UTC,catch rate is 7% + 4% per move remaining

It's probably something everyone will noticed when going into the stage. HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE."
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,markhawker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:45:57 2015 UTC,"Is there an ideal Mega, or just optimize?"
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,valedictions,0,Mon Jul 6 06:47:25 2015 UTC,I just optimized. Don't worry about updating this info. THERE will be a different thread for GUIDES to S-RANK;
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,SergeantDoctor,2,Mon Jul 6 06:50:01 2015 UTC,"I guess, but some info might be helpful even just to clear through the stages and/or catch the mons. Basic info at least.  Besides, can't hurt to share here for the S Rankers to reference for later"
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:51:18 2015 UTC,"The best move I've found for Weavile is match whatever Pokemon are at 6.3 and 6.4 (row six, column four, for clarification) with a matching Pokemon from either columns five or six. This results in columns 3 and 4 shifting one row down, clearing all the ice on the left side and easily taking away 40% of Weavile's HP (This was with Lv. Max Lucario, Lv. 6 Xerneas, Lv. 5 Genesect, and Lv. 7 Conkeldurr). From there, just make the most sensible matches (activate Crowd Control with Genesect/Heracross, go for Mega Lucario, etc...). Easily S-ranked him without needing items."

PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:52:22 2015 UTC,"I find it somewhat surprising that they're giving away Arceus already. I honestly thought he was going to be one of the last Pokémon to be added, or at least after Origin Giratina, Uxie, Azelf and Mesprit. They really missed a chance for a ""big bad final boss fight""; now he's going to rot in our PokéDexes just like all the other Normal types (unless... he has the legendary ability Disrupt Buster?)"
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,giraffe196,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:46:58 2015 UTC,What if... we will get Arceus and each of it's typing...
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:50:06 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the chance if that is extremely low. It would require Arceus to have 18 different icons, one corresponding to each type, which there isn't. Or an ability that allows type change; since he's been added already, I doubt they'll make another update just for that. Sorry I'm such a party-pooper :c"
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,giraffe196,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:12:08 2015 UTC,the 18 different icons would just be a color change... which can be done. They can have more updates. There's always a chance; don't be afraid to dream!
PokemonShuffle,3c9vl5,andersma,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:29:24 2015 UTC,Also they might make it so that arceus is the same typing as the other Pokemon next to it if it isn't optimized before starting a stage.

After I clear it, I can begin to S rank stages again, as well as try to catch the ones that got away! Plus I can work on the expert stages since I still need to catch Blaziken and Mewtwo."
PokemonShuffle,3cbknz,Hydrathefearful,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:50:34 2015 UTC,"I think this stage may be easier to beat/ S rank with the mons from the new update as Braviary (base 70) and Salamence (base 80) are both Flying types.  Braviary also has the an ability that boosts flying move damage done in a combo. I'm thinking of a team of MSlowbro, Braviary, Salamence, and Chatot (although since I'll have to catch and train Braviary and Salamence, I may train up Pidgeot cause it'll eventually get a mega) will work well with the abilities and combos. Plus if I can't S rank it this way, eventually Pidgeot or Salamence will get a mega and I can attempt a mono flying type team to work with Braviary's ability."

I'm saying this due to the trend of Pokemon from the original 150 stages that can Mega Evolve (Aerodactyl and Heracross) being Megas in the new worlds.    After those 2, then I predict Steelix, Tyranitar, and Salamence to get theirs in the worlds after next.    Scizor, Charizard, Sharpedo, Pinsir, Hoenn starters, and Rayquaza will most likely be competition Megas, with the 2nd Charizard and Mewtwo forms, as well as the primals questionable.

PokemonShuffle,3c9rrs,psyducko,2,Mon Jul 6 05:27:15 2015 UTC,"it mentions that it noticed a time change and you need to check in again, or something like that pop up, when it happens."
PokemonShuffle,3c9rrs,Tjgalon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:39:38 2015 UTC,Its because you could use time travel to cheat and play stages that are currently available in the game but not available to you on that day. Or to do one-attempt per day things multiple times. So to counter it you need to check-in online to confirm the date is right before getting access again.
PokemonShuffle,3c9rae,Vinylzen,7,Mon Jul 6 05:15:22 2015 UTC,Competitions always end 1 hour before Check-in Time so that scores/placings can be calculated.

PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,Proxy94,4,Mon Jul 6 09:54:32 2015 UTC,"64% with great ball and missed 3 times :/   its easy enough without items but to be safe if I still dont have it by 2nd last day ill use a few times.  I just optimized my team and didnt really use any strategy, but maybe Stage 203 - Avalugg: Base 70, Barrier Bash, Ice-Type would be useful to get  or one of the other barrier bash mons"
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,02pheland,2,Mon Jul 6 11:25:19 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's sad. I got mine defeated with 4 moves left, with an optimised team, no items and 23% of chance with a regular Pokéball.   I hope you manage to get it tomorrow!  Protip --- I don't know if you are already aware of that, but here it goes anyway: If you don't catch a Pokémon with a Great Ball and run out of coins to use more of them (or if you simply don't want to spend too much on Great Balls), exit the game or turn your 3DS off before going to the Experience Points Screen, your cash will be back after the reboot, but your heart and coins spent on items wont be, though."
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,Joao_Krakenwagen,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:47:34 2015 UTC,ya that has saved me probably 40 or 50k worth of coins since I started playing
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,02pheland,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:19:40 2015 UTC,This is exactly what happened to me. But there's always tomorrow.
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,giraffe196,2,Mon Jul 6 12:00:25 2015 UTC,"I tried doing it itemless and I almost beat it, but I failed just very barely (one more easy tap would have done it). I want to say that I was unlucky, but you definitely want to use your chances wisely, especially since I expect the capture rate is very low as well.  EDIT: Okay, I was confirmed unlucky to the max... My step-daughter just beat it with four moves remaining itemless (even though it was really her mom that did it) and caught it at a 23% chance. That's one less Pokemon she has to worry about!"
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,gospelexe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:58:43 2015 UTC,"Base capture rate is 7% with an additional 4% for every move left. Not as bad as Pinsir was, but it isn't that high. Five tries is doable enough IMO, and clearing the new stages will give you enough coins for at least a Disruption Delay, which will help out a lot."
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,skippingmud,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:23:40 2015 UTC,"Apparently, they want us to use all the items we can buy."
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,elleotribal,3,Mon Jul 6 11:26:33 2015 UTC,Pinsir all over again. I swear this game gives me more stress than finals.
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,giraffe196,5,Mon Jul 6 12:00:57 2015 UTC,Double Damage and max optimized pokemons should do it. I also used Mega Start but the board was layed out that I wasnt able to use any Mega moves untill a board reset.
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,Juuna,3,Mon Jul 6 12:13:06 2015 UTC,"I used the optimized team and beat it with 3 moves left, catch rate was ~20% and failed. Super catch chance happened and it got up to ~80% and i caught it.  Its atleast better then Pinsir was, since the catch rate is higher then Pinsirs and we have the super catch chance now."

PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,Houeclipse,2,Mon Jul 6 15:54:58 2015 UTC,First time trying Jirachi and beat it itemless with 1 move left ._. 7% + 4% = 11% and I caught it... I think I spent this week's luck

PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,Infinitedaw,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:52:17 2015 UTC,"If you're concerned about catching it, use Attack+ and use a Great Ball. It's actually pretty straightforward. Considering how badly catching RNG can screw you, it's not something you should really risk botching."
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,DBrody6,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:52:55 2015 UTC,"I wasted a shitton of coins because I was just as paranoid of missing it xD I bought all power-ups (because I forgot Moves+5 doesn't help catching it -_-) and beat it on the first turn. Got it to 59% or so, and had enough for a Great Ball MAX just in case."
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,Zekrom-9,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:56:47 2015 UTC,"Just caught it with Charizard, Moltres, Lucario and Combusken all at like level 2 except for Lucario who was level 5. Used the attack boost and caught it with a 31% catch rate! Scary stuff."
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,grilledtomato,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:23:53 2015 UTC,"So I caught Jirachi today, but I'm hoping that Jirachi's lore doesn't come true for anyone who can't catch it becuase you'd have to wait 1000 years before it would be back in Shuffle."
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,giraffe196,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:31:44 2015 UTC,"Used an attack boost and beat it for a 39% catch rate, but of course it still popped out of the pokeball.  So the greatball double it to 78% and I caught it!  Worth the coins for the peace of mind."
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,tgJester,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:12:17 2015 UTC,"I beat it and catch it itemless, give it a try, you still have a few days left, go full-item the last day"
PokemonShuffle,3cabi5,elpuente93,-2,Mon Jul 6 10:36:15 2015 UTC,Mega start dd w/ M Lucario beat it in 1 move caught at like 60% pokeball
PokemonShuffle,3ca3mg,Rollarman,7,Mon Jul 6 07:55:42 2015 UTC,"To answer your questions:  Stage 130 (Ampharos) is the best place to grind EXP. As for teams, I usually just kind of throw them together. Pretty much anything paired with Mega Gengar will do decent damage to Ampharos. If you have low level Pokemon, Buneary is also a good option.  Meowth is used primarily for grinding coins. The idea is to take the coins that spawn in the stage (max of five coins without extra moves) and line them up to match, then finish the stage. Getting three coins matched is 130 coins, four is 330, and five is 530. It's best to start simply going for four and then working your way up to five when you feel comfortable. I recommend Heatran and Conkeldurr for their Last-Ditch Effort abilities, and a few normal effective Pokemon. Lucario's Pummel ability (though somewhat unreliable) can also help.  As for Absol, I've never heard of any effective grinding that comes from him. Maybe practice for events, but nothing else really special."
PokemonShuffle,3ca3mg,Shepdawg1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:09:16 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks a lot!"
PokemonShuffle,3ca3mg,Hylian-Highwind,3,Mon Jul 6 20:53:07 2015 UTC,"Absol is more to practice Timed Stages than to gain anything.  Ampharos is for EXP, Meowth for coins.  For Ampharos, you can manage with one NVE, but it might be ideal to include a Ground type in tandem to level out the damage."
PokemonShuffle,3ca3mg,skippingmud,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:57:22 2015 UTC,Thanks!
PokemonShuffle,3c6ucx,KamuKid,3,Sun Jul 5 12:00:33 2015 UTC,"The icons that they remove are treated as side-effects and not as part of the damage calculation. They serve more as potential setups for combos rather than sources for additional damage. I agree that those abilities will be much more useful if the removed icons also contributed to damage, but I guess they wanted to save that for the Mega Evolution's abilities where the difference is much more noticeable (removing at most ten icons vs. removing only one or two icons)."
PokemonShuffle,3c6ucx,skippingmud,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:28:38 2015 UTC,"Question: The icons removed don't contribute to the damage dealt, okay, but if they are icons of Pokémon capable of Mega Evolving, would they count to the Mega Gauge or not?"
PokemonShuffle,3c6ucx,Joao_Krakenwagen,3,Sun Jul 5 14:18:24 2015 UTC,"There's no way to verify this in-game since none of the Quirky and Quirky+ Pokemon mega evolve and Eject doesn't remove icons of the same Pokemon, but I would assume it won't because the removed icons are treated as separate from the matching icons."
PokemonShuffle,3c6ucx,skippingmud,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:21:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what was on my mind too, but I got curious and had to ask it to someone else haha"
PokemonShuffle,3c6ucx,Joao_Krakenwagen,0,Sun Jul 5 14:35:00 2015 UTC,"I guess.. Unfortunately missing out on a lot of damage, but I guess the potential damage is much greater which is always nice. Also, if a Pokémon with the possibility to mega evolve had Quirk/+ then they'd be able to mega evolve quicker if they proc'd the ability!I think :O"
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,Joao_Krakenwagen,9,Sun Jul 5 01:28:20 2015 UTC,"I would assume the new Mega will probably be Steelix, considering Steelix already came in this pack, but Heracross or Scizor could be options as well.  I assume at this point that EX and Event mons will have their Megas reserved for competitions, (Mewtwo being the exception since he was the Version 1 Final Boss of sorts)"
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,Hylian-Highwind,7,Sun Jul 5 01:33:43 2015 UTC,"Manaphy, Safari and Competition also end tomorrow;   We will most likely get a NEW legendary, repeat daily poke event, and new stages.   I hope for MEGA Scizor because he is one of my favorite pokes."
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,psyducko,6,Sun Jul 5 01:48:18 2015 UTC,"I guess it will be Palkia and the 3rd Daily Pokémon combo. Maybe Palkia could be another escalation battle, that would be cool. And then in one week from tomorrow, a competition for a Charizardite, I hope for a Fire Type Mega Charizard X or a Flying Type Mega Charizard Y. EDIT: Forget what i said about the Charizardite, they need to bring Mega Banette back first"
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,elleotribal,5,Sun Jul 5 01:53:44 2015 UTC,It's about time we get that Charizardite.
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,valedictions,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:12:14 2015 UTC,"A new Steel Mega Pokémon would be great, Steelix with a 70 base attack power would make Mega Mawile go to the bin. But I don't think that they'd pick Steelix only because it is from the same location as the boss, we also have Tyranitar on Pedra Valey that is able to Mega Evolve (forgive me if there is other ones that I'm missing). Also, what you said about EX and Event Mega Stones being distributed in competitions makes perfect sense, except for Mega Banette all of the Stones prior to Manectric were from the EX Stages. I think Mega Banette will come back next and then a Charizardite (don't ask me which one xD) will be the following event reward, then we will get another Random ""Pokémonite"" and then Stones for the Hoenn Starters in intervals between them and more randoms."
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,giraffe196,5,Sun Jul 5 01:44:22 2015 UTC,"i hope so! also just for fun, here's my estimates on the power of each one: zebstrika: 60 power weavile: 70 power avalugg: 60 power braviary: 70 (please we need a decent flying pokemon) excadrill: 70 aegislash: 70 salamence: 80 (guessing because tyranitar is 80 and their respective pre-evolutions share the same power) hippowdon: 60  no idea about the mega. im thinking it might be steelix, tyranitar, or salamence, but im hoping its for a type we havent had yet.  im guessing the next great challenge will be either registeel or regice, and that we'll get either repeats of daily pokemon or new daily pokemon."
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,valedictions,2,Sun Jul 5 03:54:01 2015 UTC,Dragonite?
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,giraffe196,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:00:51 2015 UTC,"i meant salamence, although i wish they would've made a mega dragonite."

PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,nomamut,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:17:35 2015 UTC,What would they call the stone though? dragonite-ite???
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,valedictions,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:32:21 2015 UTC,"You don't have to estimate the base AP, go to the in-game pokedex search for all pokemon and order by AP, look for the  silohuettes and the AP of their neighbors. Or check shuffle move's roster."
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,nomamut,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:46:44 2015 UTC,"this isnt actually true. trying it right now, phione, palkia, zebstrika, etc are listed in the 50 attack power range - which is obviously not accurate. shuffle move's roster might have the correct ones though."
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,KamuKid,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"They must have changed that last monday, on ver 1.2.4 I still could see Palkia on 80 and Regice&Registeel on 70.

Judging by this I'm predicting Heracross but Scizor would be cool too"
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,kenniky,3,Sun Jul 5 09:15:03 2015 UTC,"Steelix seems the most logical Mega to end Pedra Valley given the nature of the area, but then again they ended the playground area with Aerodactyl so it's not really guaranteed. Good catch with how there are nine Pokemon left in the dex, though. It definitely looks like they're Stages 201 to 209.   I think we might also be getting a new EX stage, much like how Genesect came with Mega Aerodactyl in Wacky Workshop. It'll probably be something that's a standalone, though, like Deoxys or Cresselia. Or they might begin a new trio. There's a big chance there won't be one, though, seeing as the Kalos starters were just unlocked."
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,giraffe196,7,Sun Jul 5 11:04:50 2015 UTC,Are you telling me you DON'T have giant pterodactyls in your playground?
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,psyducko,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:11:00 2015 UTC,"They just gave us a Steel Type Jirachi with Mega Boost+ and base 70 attack power, I think Steelix is really going to be it!"

PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,MegaMissingno,5,Sun Jul 5 02:14:51 2015 UTC,"There was a time when there wasn't so much going on - and you can focus on main stages. Now, there's legendaries, escalating stages, safari, daily pokes, competitions,..."
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,giraffe196,2,Sun Jul 5 03:04:02 2015 UTC,Well those other things are important for those who haven't reached the end of the main stages. They need something new and interesting if they are stuck on one of the main stages.
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,TheLightdarker,2,Sun Jul 5 13:23:50 2015 UTC,"My prediction:   201: Excadrill BP 60 202: Braviary BP 70 (please) 203: Weavile BP 70 204: Zebstrika BP 60 205: Avalugg BP 60 206: Aegislash BP 70 207: Volcarona BP 70 208: Salamence BP 80 (please, and a Flying type preferably) 209: Hippowdon BP 70 (please) 210: Mega Steelix (I think the Mega for Pedra Valley should be something that fits the environment and I feel that they won't do Mega Tyranitar since that'd be the second Rock Mega in a row)    Also, I think we will have Regice as an event legeandary since it's been an eternity since Regirock. And if we're going to get an expert stage (which I doubt) my bet is on Darkrai since it's one of the last legendaries (and probably the only one that isn't Psychic type) that isn't part of a duo, trio or have some forms that could be awkward to feature as expert stages.  For the next areas I believe that they will start all over again with a bunch of weak pokémon that still are way too strong like Froakie and Onix. As for the theme there are many options. I find it weird that most of the early game bugs (Caterpie, Wurmple, Sewaddle etc.) haven't been featured but all the lategame strong bugs like Heracross and Scizor have. So my prediction goes to a basic forest-like area with a bunch of bugs, maybe the elemental monkeys and hopefully Goomy as well."
PokemonShuffle,3c5onh,PaintThing,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:41:17 2015 UTC,"I think the Mega Boss is going to be one of the Pokémon included on the original 150 levels though. But besides that, what you said makes sense, I only think they won't add any new EX stages right now because we just got Greninja and Company, but they could be addidng more EX Stages for Legendary Duos / Trios in the future, when more levels are available, just like what they did with the last three stages. And I guess we won't see another Regi-something until the next Area is inaugurated, maybe in 4 weeks we receive a Steel Themed location and Registeel comes with it in an event (I hope I'm wrong though). Besides, Manaphy ends tomorrow, would they release Phione or are they putting a new Pokémon on the listing? And about that, with tomorrow's update, I'm eager to see which unreleased Pokémon are going to be put on the listings, just like those 9 I listed are on it as of now."

I've been playing Stage #37 all week long and saved up about 27,000 coins so I could have at least 2 runs with all items.   aaaand in the last 30mins I've dropped down 64 spots to 5688. :("
PokemonShuffle,3c658y,Harrason,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:52:49 2015 UTC,Oh man. I hope you stay in the 6000. I have enough for one run and then will have about 7000ish coins left. I haven't tried grinding Meowth ever since I'm still S ranking my remaining courses. I need 6 or 8 more to unlock Genesect and then whatever's left after that for the kalos starters. Also I've been stuck on Conkeldur :(. But I will have that speed up as I wasn't able to get one for lv 100 Giratina (only got to 56 item less and refused to spend coin there).

I spent coins on +5, Mega Start and Disruption Delay with Blastoise as my mega before, because I thought I would be able to do it without C-1, but I always fell short. So I caved in and finally bought C-1. I should've done it sooner. Anyway, my team was M-Gengar (Max), Manaphy (3), Dialga (5) Swampert (4). I think there also needs to be some luck involved but with C1 it's doable, but don't forget to buy +5. I didn't want to risk it so I also bought Disruption Delay and Mega Start, but Mega Start is kind of useless if you use M-Gengar. Good luck!"

PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,Rez91,6,Fri Jul 3 01:25:27 2015 UTC,"I love it! Giving us more methods of obtaining Mega Speedups is appreciated. I'd be worried about scoring high but 99.9% of this game's populace simply has NO common sense regarding coin conservation.   You get enough coins for an all item run in competitions simply by not spending coins for the whole week, checking in every day, and doing the weekend Meowth. Scoring high enough for the speedup is really trivial if you resist frivolously spending coins. It's practically a non-issue. I'm garbage at timed stages and yet I'm at 150th place in NA. Items are hilariously OP in these competitions."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,DBrody6,2,Fri Jul 3 04:39:40 2015 UTC,"I consider myself not so great at them too and I got a score just over 40K, sitting at place 1096 right now. I maxed out the levels on my team and used all the items and got that on my first ""real"" run. I definitely think you're right about the item thing, before I started actually reading strategies on the game I was horrible at it and didn't even get a Lucarionite in the first competition, but intelligently using items has totally turned around my Shuffle experience."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,cleffairyble,4,Sun Jul 5 19:51:31 2015 UTC,I'm garbage at timed stages and yet I'm at 150th place in NA.    I'm lower than 150th place. What does that say about me?
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,icravedanger,3,Fri Jul 3 07:47:54 2015 UTC,Well what is your score? Cause I had a crazy bonus combo after time ran out that inflated my score an additional 6000 points. I'd be a few hundred spots worse than that if I didn't have dumb luck.
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,DBrody6,-3,Fri Jul 3 08:09:23 2015 UTC,"About 37000 but my point was that pseudo-humble statements should be avoided because it is belittling or insulting to someone who tried hard and didn't have the same level of success. It's like saying ""I'm terrible at academics and I got a 3.89 without studying"" or ""my mile time is 6:40 and I'm slow as hell""."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,icravedanger,7,Fri Jul 3 08:24:20 2015 UTC,"Except just by looking around other forums, 37K is fairly average for people who aren't good at timed stages and use every item. I mean I get that what I said was a dick thing to say in retrospect, but I'd still stand by the point that using every item makes winning a sure thing."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,DBrody6,0,Fri Jul 3 08:28:42 2015 UTC,"It's not a sure thing. You still need strong Pokes and some skill. A lot of newer players do not have Groudon or Mega Gengar. I have placed 33rd for Banettite and 600s for Venusaur so I have good runs and bad runs. I would refrain from even implying that someone else is ""bad at the game"". That's not for you to judge, and no one benefits from saying it or hearing it."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,icravedanger,6,Fri Jul 3 08:38:15 2015 UTC,"Yes. I like that the mega stones are available for most of the people who are actually trying, but there's still an incentive to get a higher score."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,cleffairyble,10,Fri Jul 3 03:02:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan. It's got a rich get richer aspect going on. Namely, those that are the best are given tools that make them do even better. So now people who were already good are getting mega speedups that the rest of us can't get so their pokemon are even better and thus they can win even more.  If future competitions all had mega starts as an option, that'd definitely ameliorate my concerns though. Then the mega speedups could help you in the regular game but couldn't help you win contests."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,o76923,8,Fri Jul 3 06:18:01 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. But I'd like to add that most competitions thus far have offered the Mega Start powerup, and that would make Mega Speed Ups worthless. If that's the case with future competitions, then it isn't so much of a rich get richer aspect. And I believe a Mega Speed Up or two does not make a tangible difference that can turn an impossible goal into a possible one, or an unlikely success into a likely success, such as winning a Mega Stone or S-ranking a certain level."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,icravedanger,6,Fri Jul 3 07:45:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's stressing me out.  I stressed enough trying to get in the top 20000 in the US, but now the top 6000!?  I guess there goes all my coins. I don't grind Meowth since it's not fun to do so, I prefer to get the check in plus 30 coins for clearing any stage I'm trying to S rank/ beat/ catch.  I only do the weekend Meowth.  I hope there is enough time between the next competition that I can replenish my coins.  I hope this system isn't on the repeat competitions (Lucario, Blastoise, etc.) as I'd feel terrible ranking to get the prize when someone out there may need the stone."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,giraffe196,3,Fri Jul 3 02:18:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm kinda worried about this too. When the Bannetite or Venusaurite repeats roll around and they do the same prize leveling, it'll give the people who already have the stones an incentive to vie for the top spot to get that rare Mega Speedup. I'm hoping they don't do it, but I have a feeling they will if they see how it's working out in the Manectite competition right now."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,holocene-tangerine,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:32:54 2015 UTC,Have basically given up on trying to get within the top 20000 in Europe. Am currently at 19200~ but have no chance to play online for the next 7 hours before it ends. Is there a thread somewhere with people having the connection online problem?
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,fresh816163,0,Sun Jul 5 22:16:48 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of on the fence about prize levels. For one it promotes competition and that keeps people interested in the game which in turn keeps the game alive, but on the other hand, it could easily turn into a way to get players to sink coins (and by extension, money) into the competitions if they make the stages such that getting a good score without items is a pipe dream. I suppose I'm just worried the game will become balanced around players having these otherwise unobtainable items and making the game harder for players without them."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,icravedanger,8,Fri Jul 3 01:56:09 2015 UTC,"To put these ""unobtainable items"" into perspective, making a single Match 4 in place of a Match 3 will equal the effects of using a Mega Speed Up. Getting an extra Match 3 will equal using 3 candies."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,Exodiafinder687,-5,Fri Jul 3 07:51:50 2015 UTC,"I kind of like it, but I hope they make a easier way to get those Mega Speedups soon. I'd be willing to pay with coins if they let you buy Mega Speedups with coins. Maybe let you buy a Mega Speedup for like 1000 coins."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,Swithe,7,Fri Jul 3 00:26:36 2015 UTC,1000 would be FAR too cheap. they would probably either be 1 jewel or 5000 coins at least.
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,Pandachan17,8,Fri Jul 3 00:49:33 2015 UTC,I think even that is too cheap and Mega Speedups in my opinion shouldn't be able to be purchased and should only be distributed through competitions.
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,giraffe196,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:02:03 2015 UTC,"If they keep up with restricting Mega Speedups to events and giveaways, they're probably going to offer it for jewels should it become purchasable. Although that does make me worry for how they're gonna treat the distribution of the other ""enhancements"" in the long run."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,Swithe,0,Fri Jul 3 01:22:03 2015 UTC,I'd be fine with it being purchaseable for jewel/s per 1 speedup if their effects were not allowed/ recognized in the competition stages.
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,pagit85,0,Fri Jul 3 02:14:17 2015 UTC,"i did say ""at least"". could be far more if they sold. I'd expect repeat compeittion to replace the jewels with mega startup. either stone+jewel and megaspeed+jewel if you have it or stone+megasspeed and jewel+megaspeed if you have it already.  therell be some way to get them outside of competitions further down the line id hope. you'll need over a hundred by the time all the megas are out and compeittions arent gonna last forever. even with one compeititon a week it would take two years to get anywhere near the amount needed to feed every mega."
PokemonShuffle,3bxglp,Swithe,2,Fri Jul 3 01:23:24 2015 UTC,Well they help permanently so I imagine they'd be more expensive than any temporary item so def more than the 9000 for complexity -1

PokemonShuffle,3bwfwv,NeoAnima31,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:28:23 2015 UTC,A bit over 5300.. pretty sure I could get it higher if I weren't just playing the stage for coins. Surprisingly high scores though considering most of us are just playing it for coins.
PokemonShuffle,3bwfwv,KamuKid,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:51:54 2015 UTC,"4883, I tend to use only 1 pokemon, that being either lucario/conkeldurr (last ditch effort is much better for this stage though)."

PokemonShuffle,3bwfwv,PaysWith2DollarBills,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:58:25 2015 UTC,"I click optimize to get a fighting team, then get to see all the pokemon and take out the rest, leaving only conkeldurr in the team. Once you enter, the game will choose 3 base 30 mons to substitute those empty spaces, which helps when moving coins without wanting to do much damage. Also, because of last-ditch effort, conk is usefull if you need to rack damage quick in the last couple of turns."

PokemonShuffle,3bwfwv,Chance_Lo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:42:26 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, but I figured Meowth's special stage was one of the most played as well since everyone plays it when it is available, and 4900 sounds pretty unlikely as a high score on stage 37. Anyway, my b if OP meant stage 37."

PokemonShuffle,3bvhya,Arabesque91,4,Thu Jul 2 14:16:14 2015 UTC,"Took like like a few days to catch Gengar.. so I know the struggle, struggle on because the catch is so fucking worth it."
PokemonShuffle,3bvhya,KamuKid,2,Thu Jul 2 14:40:12 2015 UTC,I heard that using Tropius (if you caught it when it was a daily pokemon special) works because it has Eject as its ability and it guarantees getting rid of a Froakie when it activates.
PokemonShuffle,3bvhya,giraffe196,2,Thu Jul 2 21:14:24 2015 UTC,"I remember having a ton of trouble with Froakie as well. I even used multiple great balls with a ~%60 (can't remember exactly) and still didn't catch it. Eventually I was convinced it was broken, until my girlfriend caught it.  Wonder if it has some kind of bug on the catch rate. Could all just be coincidence of course."
PokemonShuffle,3bvhya,brunothepig,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:38:33 2015 UTC,Played for the first time today. Beat with 2 moves left. 5%. Caught.   Oh well lol
PokemonShuffle,3bu2mp,giraffe196,8,Thu Jul 2 03:56:18 2015 UTC,"Mega Speedup seems to be a rare resource right now, but more importantly it directly increases the rate some Pokémon evolve into their Mega formes. So I say they are definitely worth getting if say you wanted something like Mega Gengar or Mega Aerodactyl to activate sooner for future stages or competitions.  But if you don't have the coins or time then getting the Manectite stone is fine, because I'm sure we'll get more opportunities to get more Mega Speedups somehow.  As for me, hell yeah am I going for the Mega Speedup as well just in case we get an awesome Mega Pokémon that needs some more speed evolving. I'm currently at 144th place in the EU/AU leaderboards so hopefully I stay within the top 3000 places to get that Speedup :P"
PokemonShuffle,3bu2mp,yuiokino,2,Thu Jul 2 04:26:30 2015 UTC,"I have the coins, but idk if I have the time to practice on the stage. I can consistantly get around 11k itemless but when I checked yesterday I was at 7k so I imagine I'm close to 10k now.  I'm in the US so anywhere in the top 40k is ok, but I guess if I have time I'll try to get better and use items if necessary."
PokemonShuffle,3bu2mp,MayorOfChuville,3,Thu Jul 2 04:32:03 2015 UTC,"If you use the 3 items and the right Pokemon you'd have to screw up very badly to not get top 6k. I bought all the items, used M-Gengar Lv 10, Groudon Lv 7, Stunfisk Lv 7, Marowak Lv 7, and got 40k points on my first try."
PokemonShuffle,3bu2mp,yuiokino,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:06:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in terms of these competitions I've learnt that to even get those really high numbers on the leaderboards, using every item available is mandatory unfortunately.  But I do agree that since this competition is exactly like the Expert Stages, then getting some practice is really vital. I got my final score after spending all items but not before spending several tries practicing like you by going itemless. At my best I was able to muster up slightly above 10k but I'm 8k at my worst itemless.  Using all the items I found would essentially multiply your score by a factor of roughly 4, so if you can manage to get 10k consistently you'd be right in saying that you would easily  make it into the top 40k. It may seem overkill but my thought process is aim to get the highest prize then when this event finishes, at worst you still get the stone and also a Mega Speedup as a bonus if you're lucky :)"

PokemonShuffle,3bu2mp,valedictions,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:07:53 2015 UTC,"i hope so. i think on the last day i'll buy everything and give it a go, but i really am not that confident with the pokemon to use. ive been averaging 14000k itemless which really doesnt seem like a lot, so idk if i'd be able to get a high enough score to rank in the top 6000."
PokemonShuffle,3bu2mp,KamuKid,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:28:56 2015 UTC,Last time I checked I was in the top 20k with a score of 9k.. I think getting the Free Mega might be easy to keep with a few items for anyone who's trying.

PokemonShuffle,3bu2mp,KamuKid,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:16:21 2015 UTC,Hopefully not. Hope they all forget about the competition too so I don't have to use an item to stay in the 20k.. lol
PokemonShuffle,3bu2mp,mikane,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:37:51 2015 UTC,I tried with items and I am in first 1000 and I hope it'll be enough for speedup '
PokemonShuffle,3bu2mp,gospelexe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:29:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say that I would go for it, especially since people probably have at most three candies right now, with most people having only two who didn't bother going past Level 50 on Giratina (myself included).

PokemonShuffle,3bu2mp,MegaMissingno,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:01:39 2015 UTC,"My score (EU) is currently 44109 which gave me a rank of 75 on tuesday morning but now it has already dropped to 160/52630. Just today I've noticed it dropping 30 places and I'm expecting a lot more players to improve their rankings as time goes by. However, even if my ranking dips I should be perfectly safe for the speedup.  Kind of silly, however, since the mega speedups only offer a very small boost which is rendered useless by Mega Start so they are only really useful if the stage doesn't allow that or it's a routine stage with little significance and even then, the boost is really small. I'm still getting them, though."
PokemonShuffle,3bu2mp,TheLightdarker,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"I tried once with all items (first time I've ever done that in a competition), and was floored to get #333 US, yesterday.  I want the mega speed-ups, but in all seriousness, anybody else too ""afraid"" to use them on anything? I dropped one on Gengar, because it seems like he's always useful, but I'm at a total loss as to how to spend my other 2."
PokemonShuffle,3bu2mp,Oskise10001,2,Fri Jul 3 21:05:31 2015 UTC,I'm the exact same way. Tbh I'll probably drop it on Aerodactyl or Bannette(but Bannette and Chandelure together both having Mega Boost makes it easy.)
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,gospelexe,2,Wed Jul 1 11:36:17 2015 UTC,"I've gotten A rank on mega Gengar with a team of Mega Bannette, Chandelure, Giratina, and Haunter (all lv 7). I've taken a break from trying this to focus on Mega Manectric. Id say the other easy ones are Mightyena and Garbodor and possibly Milotic (make sure to bring Feebas). I just used the optimize button on those ones."
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,giraffe196,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:40:47 2015 UTC,The score I got on the Mega Gengar stage seems to be luck based though. I can consistently get B but only have gotten A twice. The best I've done is 7 moves left but I got a big combo early on.
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,giraffe196,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:42:44 2015 UTC,"Mega Gengar is heavily RNG based. I've attempted him many times with Banette, Giratina, Haunter, and another pokemon (probably Gengar) and I've only come down to about 10%-40% HP left.  Mega Gengar is RNG god."
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,giraffe196,0,Thu Jul 2 11:58:31 2015 UTC,I'm sure I could do it with either DD or Megs Start but I'm cheap so I probably won't. Plus i need my coins for Mega Manectrix.
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,Oskise10001,2,Thu Jul 2 12:48:31 2015 UTC,"Try Tropius on Froakie, I think it has eject which I'm 99.9% sure can get rid of the middle Froakies.  For Braixen bring Blastoise or Milotic and hope for Stabilize+ to activate."
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,Oskise10001,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:36:57 2015 UTC,"I just did a 5-heart run on Braixen. Here's my observation:  Blastoise seems to be a very good choice for this as I just tested this out. The sad part is that I need a specific Stabilize+ to activate, which is directly on the steel blocks. With all of the wooden blocks in the way, it's still only about a 30% chance to remove only one block alone.  I did manage to get Braixen down to two turns remaining, just one shy away from the S-Rank thanks to the steel blocks disappearing in five turns. However, with what I have right now, I also had Blastoise M-Evolve in five turns. With some use of the new candies, I could probably feed Blastoise a candy or two in hopes of M-Evolving in four turns and hope for a good chain."
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:27:07 2015 UTC,Such is the painful row to S-ranking all 200 main stages without items. Did you try Froakie yet?
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,Oskise10001,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:34:35 2015 UTC,"I tried Froakie using your suggestion with Tropius. Works wonders! I've gotten down to 4 moves left several times, but I recently switched to Mega Venusaur (using it for the first time) and that might help things up a bit. At least Mega Venusaur has a chance to Mega Evolve as opposed to Ampharos, who just simply takes too long..."
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,evuldave,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:50:45 2015 UTC,"I assume you don't have Keldeo?  I find Keldeo and Floatzel's Block Bash more reliable since it's guaranteed to remove a Steel Block whenever it activates, as opposed to Milotic and Blastoise removing either Steel or Wood sometimes."
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,Oskise10001,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:13:25 2015 UTC,"The thing is that if you get lucky with Stabilize+ removing steel then S-ranking is much more doable, Keldeo is better for casuals."

PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,slimjim367,3,Thu Jul 2 02:39:39 2015 UTC,Eject is a 100% proc.
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,Tjgalon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:31:35 2015 UTC,Do I have to match a certain amount of Tropius to use it? It seemingly randomly activates; sometimes with a match of three and other times with 4-5. But it doesn't activate consistently for me at all.
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,NobleArrgon,2,Thu Jul 2 05:32:55 2015 UTC,"Make sure to match the Tropius first because otherwise the ability won't work, I just tested on Froakie's stage and it works just fine."
PokemonShuffle,3bqqrb,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:27:56 2015 UTC,"Correct: Eject procs 100% of the time (hence the ""without fail"" in the description). Only problem is when Froakie spawns another Froakie on turn 4 and you haven't gotten rid of all four barriers, then it's basically a 50/50 gamble for getting rid of that last barrier. Furthermore, you also have to rely on getting a good chain for the defeat if you haven't already."

But back then, I used Lopunny to try to get rid of all of the top barriers and make a good escape. My winning run was actually pretty lucky, since I managed to get a line of 4 Lopunnies right after a board reset, so the chains went beautifully for a while.  I could substitute using Mega Venusaur now, or if I want to use the Lopunny strategy, then maybe Lucario due to higher strength."

PokemonShuffle,3bjyma,MegaMissingno,2,Mon Jun 29 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"It also says Attack + doubles your attack power. I thought it only did 1.5x more damage. Although, I could be wrong about that."
PokemonShuffle,3bjyma,beardedpancakes,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:32:06 2015 UTC,"It does double power, but it can't be used on the Mega competition (it's usually available for some Special stages only)  Edit: strike through"
PokemonShuffle,3bjyma,leoxyz,8,Mon Jun 29 22:43:34 2015 UTC,You should look at the items available for this mega competition...
PokemonShuffle,3bjyma,DBrody6,2,Tue Jun 30 00:57:09 2015 UTC,Thats weird o.O I was sleepy when i tried it but i could swear there we're only 2 powerups. I dont have my 3ds here right now but thanks for the info!
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,CW914,22,Mon Jun 29 14:16:41 2015 UTC,"I'm excited. But only if it has a transfer from 3DS, no way am I starting again.   Also, hopefully this'll give them a reason to bring back pokemon like Mew, Groundon, etc. I'd love that!"
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,LeaGarcia,6,Mon Jun 29 14:22:12 2015 UTC,I have no idea how they'd manage to make it able to transfer from 3DS. I won't be downloading it if they don't though. :/
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,mylifemyworld17,3,Mon Jun 29 14:38:42 2015 UTC,"Me neither, but I can see things like making it connect through NNID (I think it doesn't save any data at the moment, but they could implement it if it's not too much work) and maybe even Facebook, etc. I hope they do it, regardless of the means.   But if they're only doing this to attract a new fanbase, I can see why they wouldn't bother, sadly."
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,LeaGarcia,13,Mon Jun 29 14:46:23 2015 UTC,"The game does have that Client Number in it, perhaps they will implement a feature where you can Check In, and your progress (along with your Client Number) will be uploaded. Then you can input that Client Number to the phone version and your progress will be moved."
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,mylifemyworld17,3,Mon Jun 29 14:54:54 2015 UTC,"That seems like it'd be pretty simple to use as a means to an end, actually! There has to be some sort of progress it tracks for Nintendo, I can't see how else it'd be useful to utter it to customer support if you have problems."
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,LeaGarcia,3,Mon Jun 29 15:05:46 2015 UTC,"If i remember correctly, the NX they still have in development is supposed to have some kind of either cross play and/or mobile integration with their other hardware.  Maybe this will have some (early) form of that through something like NNID or such. I've heard that might also be the basis for the Club Nintendo Successor, so you never know.  That said, I didn't spend money on this game, so not like we'd lose all that much besides time if we switched."
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:53:35 2015 UTC,That's interesting. I'd definitely love this to be the start of Nintendo implementing these features that are otherwise quite common on many other games and services.  I'm in the same boat having not paid any money for the game. I hope they don't make the transfer a purchasable product. That'd be a kick to the teeth ouch.
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,LeaGarcia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:04:28 2015 UTC,"That might be a possibility, but it is still to early to say. However, if it really happens, I wonder if it's a one way transfer..."
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,LeaGarcia,3,Mon Jun 29 14:38:49 2015 UTC,"I'd, personally, still go for it if that was the case. Though I can see why it wouldn't sit well with a lot of people. I just find my phone easier to be on in public, I hate getting my 3DS out around people.   I don't think it'd be out of the question for them to let you sign into your ID on the phone? Or make both connect with Facebook. Everything connects with Facebook nowadays haha."
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,ShinySapphire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"Heh, it would be the third time starting again for me, as I already started a second game on my other 3DS. :P"
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,LeaGarcia,2,Mon Jun 29 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"Same, my first 3DS has a breakdown and I ended up having to start again (hence why I'd LOVE groundon and the like to make a return!). Hoping I don't have to a third time though! Haha"
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,ShinySapphire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:36:42 2015 UTC,"Sucks that it was because of a breakdown for you. For me, it was just for the lulz and partially also because I could get a few easy extra hearts from StreetPassing with my other 3DS. :P And like you, I'm still missing some Pokémon from the earlier events on that one, though (Kyogre, Groudon and Rayquaza are some of the examples).  Also, if you don't mind me asking out of curiosity, how far were you into the game on your first file? Which event 'mons did you end up missing out on because of the breakdown?"
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,LeaGarcia,2,Mon Jun 29 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"I don't believe I was too far, honestly, it broke every early into the games release. I must've only gotten up to mega mawile, if I remember correctly. I didn't catch any of the event ones before it died. I came back into the game a few days before Celebi ended, if I'm honest I'm not sure which I've missed. I know Rayquaza, Mew, Groundon, Kyogre and.. Keldeo? Can never spell that one on the top of my head. After that, I'm not too sure. I missed all the megas, but apart from Banette they've all repeated so ive got them now :)"
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,ShinySapphire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the most important ones of those are probably Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza and Keldeo (that was spelled correctly) I believe. I didn't get much usage from the rest of the event ones before that time if I recall correctly. Other than those, there's indeed Mew (which I barely used tbh) and the daily ones (the Rotom forms, Pachirisu, Tropius, Sigilyph, Farfetch'd and Druddigon), the competitive ones you mentioned and the first safari event (Carvanha, Sharpedo, Spinda, Cherubi and Cherrim) maybe? But I believe the daily Pokémon came back after the Celebi event, right?"
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,LeaGarcia,2,Mon Jun 29 21:14:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah! The daily pokemon like the rotoms I got again thankfully, they did indeed start around the time celebi ended. I havent yet got the first safari zone pokemon, I had completely forgot about those!   I also missed regirock but that's because I couldn't for the sake of me catch it tiny violin music xD"
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,cyberscythe,9,Tue Jun 30 00:11:10 2015 UTC,So that explains why the 3DS buttons aren't used for anything and why there's no 3D: they were planning a mobile phone market release from the beginning.
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,hrsetyono,8,Mon Jun 29 15:32:20 2015 UTC,Hmm it will be hard to play timed stage with fingers. Samsung Note might get huge advantage.  And is our save file stored on nintendo server? Has anyone changed their DS system and still continue the progress?
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,huskergirlie,6,Mon Jun 29 14:28:00 2015 UTC,For once the stylus is actually useful lol
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,MegaMissingno,5,Mon Jun 29 14:29:59 2015 UTC,"Eh, while it'd certainly be more convenient to play on my phone at work than on my 3DS, the 150+ hours I've put into my 3DS version convince me to not bother switching, and it isn't worth it to me to do both."
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,Tjgalon,5,Mon Jun 29 14:25:42 2015 UTC,"I have a few questions that I'm wondering:   Will this version get the same updates as 3DS at the same rate? It would seem probable that Mobile starts with the same 200 stages 3DS already has and gets updates at the same time. If this happens, we'll hopefully get Mew and other early events rereleased on the 3DS version soon since the Mobile needs them as well. Will the competitions have the same participation lists between the two versions? As in, the 20000 people who'd get a Mega stone in competition now includes people from both Mobile and 3DS. If we get the ability to link the two accounts, I could see this happening. Otherwise, I'm expecting these two versions to have separate leaderboards. How will the timed stages work on Mobile since it would be handicapped without a stylus? This could be a reason to have separate leaderboards for competitions again. Is Nintendo going to say anything about this? After all, this is their first leap into actually making a game for mobile devices. I'm aware that there have been some Pokémon apps before but those have not really been games and/or they've been utter crap so I'm considering this as their first step into mobile/console integration.   EDIT: I found an interesting picture on the official site. Not only is the map different but there are some new mysterious icons. Anyone able to decifer these?"
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,psyciceman,3,Mon Jun 29 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"in order, unsure what ! will be for, but the next should be check in, the next two we do knw and the last is l\menu that most phone has, might even be how you quit the app."
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,Cartyx,2,Mon Jun 29 16:43:45 2015 UTC,"The map just looks like it's vertical instead of horizontal. As for the buttons (if I had to guess, from left to right): Notifications, gifts (daily gift? Maybe split the notifications from check in for mobile), that stat menu that no one uses, store, and a standard menu.  If mobile doesn't get its own leaderboards for the completion stages they had better raise the cut off for Europe.  To me it doesn't look like it's going to be all that different."
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,SirSmokesAlott,4,Mon Jun 29 21:33:55 2015 UTC,"Not surprising considering that the game was made like a freemium mobile game. Thankfully the game gives no real reason to spend any money on the game, which is something I commend it for.  If I'm being frugal with my space then I'll probably just stick with my 3DS. I got enough to play on my phone as it is and if there's no way to transfer our saves then I wouldn't want to start over."
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,Xinare,6,Mon Jun 29 15:31:17 2015 UTC,"If they make them cross compatible there will be a LOT of cheating. You can use ""lucky patcher""  or ""freedom""  to hack In app purchases"
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,serpent-tailed-angel,2,Mon Jun 29 16:40:51 2015 UTC,What about streetpassing? I guess that won't be a thing.
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,SamChallis,2,Mon Jun 29 19:01:01 2015 UTC,"I don't keep my phone on my at home, but I guess this will be a nice little thing to go from time to time when I'm out. Probably gonna still mostly play this on my 3DS though. Just cuzz I've already made so much more progress on it, and have it around when I'm available to play more often. Here's hoping events don't share the same pool of competitors as the 3DS version, though. Or that they increase the number of winners.  In any case, good move for Nintendo. Or Game Freak. Whoever benefits from the microtransactions. Most of the people I know who go for microtransations are the type who mostly play smaller games on smart devices."
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,idai_puraisu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:58:35 2015 UTC,My phone isn't good enough :( Oh well not that I need to play the whole game again
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,Yuselwusel,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:46:37 2015 UTC,"I am not excited if it means they share the same competitions with 3ds users. If every version (android, ios, 3ds) has their own competitions then fine. Top 20,000 doable out of 100,000 but if you now have to earn top 6,000 of everyone in your region across all platforms. Not worth it"
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:09:09 2015 UTC,"I'm excited, but EX stages are going to be a pain on mobiles."
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,apoptygma,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:09:46 2015 UTC,Would we have to start over on the iOS version? or can we transfer our current game and pokes? I like it on the 3DS; not sure how I will like it on mobile.
PokemonShuffle,3big1x,apoptygma,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:18:18 2015 UTC,Dammit. This was about the only reason I still play my 3DS! Hope they figure out syncing progress across devices. Clash of clans does it so it should be possible.

PokemonShuffle,3big1x,OllyOllyOxenBitch,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:49:48 2015 UTC,I wonder if this goes against their policy of not porting games to the mobile market. I guess this game can be the exception with how it is though.

PokemonShuffle,3bjh02,WillExis,-9,Mon Jun 29 19:27:35 2015 UTC,"Zigzag might still be random or it might not, I guess we'll find out. And if I'm wrong I'll blame the site. Also look at that pitiful 360 damage..."
PokemonShuffle,3bjh02,NobleArrgon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"Looking at this, either it's really good rng for the 2 bolts to travel in in the same pattern or it's set to always clear that path. Assuming it's the latter...  Now, there's good and bad to this.  GOOD. for shufflemove users, this is easier to predict and therefore able to produce combos much easier compared to ampharos. Second, for stages that are timed, you can pretty much ignore the 2 columns on the left and right and just focus on the middle 4, since manetric is always going to clear those 2 when you match megas.  BAD. This is probably going to be useless for heavy disruption stages if it only clears the side columns, cause youre gonna be left with a mess of disruptions in the middle... which is the only bad thing i can think about atm.  Also, manetric does have a better ability than ampharos' dragon dance or w/e, so that's a win there."
PokemonShuffle,3bjh02,Loreinatoredor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:55:09 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you although since I don't use Shuffle Move it's more bad than good for me.
PokemonShuffle,3bjh02,leoxyz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:27:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, awesome! I assumed it was like ampharos but I guess it's closer to glalie and sableye (pattern based). I'll have to check the timing though to be sure, it's either 8 or 10 frame increments."

Both of them have 7 Mega Speedups as the maximum number though."

PokemonShuffle,3bino3,goldfish270,2,Mon Jun 29 15:29:23 2015 UTC,try not to think about your next moves. if you see a match of 3 just go for it don't look for something that will score 30 more points but take .5 seconds longer to find its not worth it. good luck :)
PokemonShuffle,3bino3,stavross100,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:48:15 2015 UTC,The closest experience that you'll get to Complexity -1 without buying it would be the last few seconds of Chesnaught after you've cleared through all of the wood.  Nvm~ Though I'd personally recommend still practicing on Manectric since you have to get used to the disruptions in the first place and more complexity is theoretically better for practice anyway.
PokemonShuffle,3bino3,Zertolurian,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:29:51 2015 UTC,"Not sure Chesnaught is recommended since Manectric has an extra complexity (Mareep) that is removed by the C-1, so ideally would be one with just your team naturally on the board."
PokemonShuffle,3bino3,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:16:52 2015 UTC,"Whoops... I thought that Chesnaught had added Complexity too (which would simulate having only 4 Pokemon on the board), but it seems that I was mistaken. All of the other Expert Stages have 5 Pokemon on the board though, so I guess we can't really practice Timed Stages with exactly 4 Pokemon after all. :/"
PokemonShuffle,3bino3,Zertolurian,2,Mon Jun 29 18:47:44 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, practicing a 5 complexity will probably indirectly help prep for the 4 Comp, since those are even easier to maintain a combo by collapse, or at least have those give you a buffer for making another match."

PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,icravedanger,4,Mon Jun 29 06:58:14 2015 UTC,Well... at least there's no reason for me to feel bad if I miss this stone.  Though this essentially means the only worthwhile rewards in this competition are the stuff for the top 20k regardless.
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,valedictions,3,Mon Jun 29 07:12:39 2015 UTC,Are those the slowest Pokemon to mega evolve?
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,icravedanger,3,Mon Jun 29 07:02:58 2015 UTC,I think Mewtwo and Banette are.

PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:49:33 2015 UTC,"Man, I was already thinking of just blowing off this competition - I mean, I'd play it a few times, but I'm not spending coins on it - but I was still thinking, if it was a faster evolving version of Ampharos... But if it takes the same amount of time to evolve as Ampharos, then, yeah, it's pretty worthless, other than maybe if its mega effect hits the same spots consistently instead of just randomly like Amphy...  Uh, anyway, the mega start and mega speedup I think are the more worthwhile prizes, but I'm not spending all those coins just to boost my score to maybe do well enough to get a mega start, because I could just buy one with the money I'd save by not buying items for this competition. I am fairly confident I'm not good enough to get the mega speedup even with items (I pretty consistently rank in the 7000s with items, except for the mega Venusaur one where I was in the 3000s)  Sorry that was long and rambly. But I think the only really good thing about Mega Manectric is its non-mega ability is way more useful than Ampharos's non-mega ability."
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,flounder19,3,Tue Jun 30 20:03:05 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, the competition for the top 3k/6k just got fierce. I like how it makes the top players truly fight for a prize instead of making us settle for whatever a full-item run gives us.  Interestingly no Mega Start available so Mega Speedups might be in play. However, both C-1 and Att+ are in so we'll need to put in a lot of coins to compete.  Originally I thought this would be just another boring competition that I could just roflstomp with all the items but this time it looks like I have to bring my A game. That, and a lot of coins. ;_;"
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Hylian-Highwind,3,Mon Jun 29 06:30:08 2015 UTC,"Looks the teams will have to be M-GENGAR, GROUNDON, stunfisk, and marowak. the last 2 are needed because thier hitting streaks activate, and do more damage, as opposed to groundon or donphan which cant activate thier ability, due to manetrics paralyze immunity. Im at 87k coints right, hoping to get to 99k before competition starts. had a few mishaps with meowth farming. LOOks like the majority of the items are require, havnt start comp yet."
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Hylian-Highwind,3,Mon Jun 29 07:26:59 2015 UTC,Why do you need 99K? It's only like 14K for all the items;
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,MegaMissingno,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:14:20 2015 UTC,"I always get 99k before go do a stage that requires large amount of items. And when i grind meowth sometimes i get unluckly and get 0 or 30 for each meowth. I only do the competition once a day, to see if i can surpass my previous score.  My current score is a little over 30k, but it could be better. I level stunkfisk and marowak, while grinding for coins. so i wont lose out on coins if i just grind on ampharos all the time."
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Hylian-Highwind,3,Tue Jun 30 23:11:02 2015 UTC,"If they keep tiered rewards and mega speedups for all competitions from now on, it's going to be hell for new players to get competition megas even when they're rereleased since players who already have those stones will have a stronger incentive to try and place."

Kinda just did as an ""I'm up and there wasn't one yet"" thing.  Also, minor thing that might be worth clarifying is that Mareep is treated as a Complexity, so it drops into the stage regularly rather than being added via disruption, and is the mon removed by C-1. At least, that's the difference in terminology I noticed.  Also, minor thing, has anyone tested what happens if you bring Mareep on your squad?"
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Juuna,2,Mon Jun 29 06:25:14 2015 UTC,Someone said that bringing Mareep makes Flaaffy the complexity.
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Wrulfy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:45:25 2015 UTC,"No its not worthwhile over marowak. marowak is pure white, groundon is all red, stunfisk is brown, u can pretty much tell the difference between these pokemon. marowak and stunfisk hitting streak is superior to donphan, but people have gotten high scores for them."
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,MaiKitty,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:12:55 2015 UTC,"I meant color contrast from Mareep, not the other Ground types, because Mareep is White with a very slightly yellow tint to it, which can be confused with Marowak at a glance.  It's not like the timed format lets Hitting Streak trigger often anyway. I don't see why not if it makes a difference to someone at least"
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,beardedpancakes,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:59:28 2015 UTC,"I use c-1 to eliminate mareep, it seem its neccesariy to o btain a high score. consider that donphan,stunfisk and marowak have gthe same power. the hitting streak gurantees an initial 3 match damage increase, over donphans base damage with no activation, though i think the people with high score, have very good reflexes, able to make combos quickly, without thinking much."

I have basically only been blasting through stages, and I'm on ~130ish now. I haven't been playing when any other competition has been out.  Any estimates for what kind of score I would need to get top 20,000 (EU)? I just did one itemless run and got 7,000. In 7 days time hopefully I should have access to M-Gengar and 3 ground types, as well as having levels higher than ~3/4 (obviously this should increase my score considerably) but will going for an all-item run be necessary for the stone? Because if not, obviously I'd rather spend coins on DDs and great balls (in Exp/boss levels).  Basically I'm interested in knowing what kind of standard the top 20,000 (EU) has been for the past few competitions. Will the top 20,000 all be players who are reasonably good, have optimal teams and will cash out on items?"
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Rafailo,2,Mon Jun 29 12:33:00 2015 UTC,Usually around 15000 should be the safe zone for the stone in EU.

PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,PaintThing,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:28:37 2015 UTC,Donphan might be viable over Marowak for a nitpicky reason: color contrast with the Mareeps (if you're not getting C-1 for a run).

PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Inequilibrium,-3,Mon Jun 29 06:29:38 2015 UTC,"So far this seems like the most poorly-conceived competition yet. Every player is going to use exactly the same team, so there will be less strategy and variety than ever. And the Attack Power + item against an opponent with no HP is the most stupidly redundant thing. I'd have preferred a Mega Start option if they wanted us to burn through coins.  Mostly though, it's just stupid that we got a second (weaker) electric mega instead of a fire, bug or flying mega. They should have saved Manectric until we had a few more viable options for ground types or Megas to use."
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Inequilibrium,6,Mon Jun 29 06:31:47 2015 UTC,it's probably one of the best devised competitions yet imo. it separates the boys from the men by making it a demonstration of skill since most players will be using similar team builds with limited items. the prize tiers really drive it home too
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Tjgalon,-3,Mon Jun 29 06:35:34 2015 UTC,"I find timed levels more about luck than skill, especially with the home button exploit gone. I could rank in the top 10 in the turn-based contests, but in the timed ones there are so many random fluctuations that there's less you can control. It's even worse when they added an extra 3000 coins to the cost per attempt, for no real reason.  Having only one effective team is boring, and is not more skilful than having a range of Pokemon people can use."
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Zekrom-9,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:33:59 2015 UTC,"i find it to be the reverse of that. time-based play prevents the use of 'shuffle move,' a program that computes the highest scoring match available to a player at a given moment.  if it were turn based, then every competitive player would need to be using shuffle move for their highest potential score, but then the final score would be completely limited to the random mons that drop on screen. time-based happens far too quickly to use the program, so a player must rely on their skill in spite of the random clutter.  but to each their own. i prefer turn based myself because i don't enjoy voluntary stress, but i won't shy away from changing conditions for a good time"
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,icravedanger,2,Mon Jun 29 06:56:45 2015 UTC,"if it were turn based, then every competitive player would need to be using shuffle move for their highest potential score   I never used Shuffle Move in the turn-based competitions and I believe I made top 10 in one, and top 5 in the other. Honestly, I find it pathetic that people would feel the need to cheat, but maybe they could put a timer on each move so you wouldn't really have time to enter everything into Shuffle Move, but you'd have enough time to weigh up your options."
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Zekrom-9,-1,Mon Jun 29 10:10:00 2015 UTC,"would that not be a repackaging of time-based play? and what of the home-button exploit, was that cheating or was it employing every tool available to do as well as possible?"
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,icravedanger,-4,Mon Jun 29 12:00:17 2015 UTC,"would that not be a repackaging of time-based play?    No. The time-based and turn-based mechanics are completely different. For instance, Pokemon's skills are almost entirely useless in time matches because they can't trigger mid-combo no matter how long ago the combo started. (Which IMO is a blatant design flaw.) I'm suggesting a turn-based system where you have, say, 30 or 40 seconds to make each move, just to prevent cheating.   and what of the home-button exploit, was that cheating or was it employing every tool available to do as well as possible?   Unlike Shuffle Move, the home button exploit was in the game. It shouldn't have been, but again, unlike Shuffle Move, it really did force everyone to use it if they wanted to compete. And it didn't choose moves for you. It also actually increased the ability to rely on strategy and finding the best moves, and made it less luck and reflex-based, so it wasn't entirely terrible even if it was tedious."
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Zekrom-9,3,Mon Jun 29 12:13:13 2015 UTC,"excellent, a cheater that wishes to prevent cheating. thankfully, the game actual game mechanics we've been given prevent the use of shuffle move, but this conversation has gotten far off topic from the OP. you should make a new one with that idea though, because it wouldn't be surprising if the game developers read user forums such as this"
PokemonShuffle,3bhe18,Zekrom-9,-1,Mon Jun 29 12:19:22 2015 UTC,"What are you even talking about? I've never used Shuffle Move, except once for a few minutes just to see how it worked before I got bored of trying to play that way and quit. I caught every EX Pokemon without the home button. I think I only used the home button exploit on Banette - and I was already in the top 1000 or so without it IIRC, so it made no difference to my legitimately-earned reward (in fact it cost me more coins to make these extra attempts). I was more doing it because I wanted to see how well I could compete, and every other top player was doing it - so in a sense, at the upper levels, it was a competition of that particular style of play. So in that instance it functioned as a different (slower, more strategic) way of playing the game, not actually cheating. That said, it should never have been in the game, as I said. They just should have designed it well in the first place.  What I'm opposed to is elements of the game design that reduce reliance on skill and increase reliance on luck. They hold back what would otherwise be a really great game. I think the time-based contests are bad because the time-based gameplay in this game is poorly thought out, has some major flaws, and an excessive focus on luck (e.g. looking at the right part of the screen first at the right time to see a good match). Making it cost more coins per attempt only makes the luck factor more important, as you have fewer chances to get a lucky run."

PokemonShuffle,3bj0d0,Roby_93,2,Mon Jun 29 16:55:13 2015 UTC,Use Aerodactyl over Glalie for Chesnaught. He's more valuable since he eats through the blocks for more damage and opens up much easier combos with the 3-mon stage.
PokemonShuffle,3bj0d0,Hylian-Highwind,2,Mon Jun 29 17:02:08 2015 UTC,A personal advice I'd give is not to spend coins on Chesnaught if you already have a strong team. Items may help but mostly you'll win only when Chesnaught finally lets you win. Your catch rate might be low this way but it's best to try it 5 times so than to spend a lot of coins and still the catch rate don't change much.
PokemonShuffle,3bj0d0,leoxyz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:49:18 2015 UTC,"Ended up catching Chesnaught at 2% chance, here. Perseverance will pay off! :P"

PokemonShuffle,3bj0d0,Zertolurian,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:51:42 2015 UTC,"Your best bet on guaranteeing your capture is to just S-rank their stages (refer to the Sticky Thread) and have like, 3 Great Balls in store since their capture rates hinge heavily on how much time you have left anyway:     Chesnaught: Base: 1% + (4%/3sec) Delphox: Base: 1% + (10%/3sec) Greninja: Base: 1% + (5%/3sec) Note: Time +10 does not count towards catch rate     If you want to go itemless, the same sets mentioned in the S-ranking thread should work too and you could just repeatedly beat them until you get lucky and catch them. I myself caught Chesnaught and Greninja itemless, but found it impossible to finish Delphox with 3+ seconds. I also used M-Blast and DD instead of M-Aero and MS, but I guess that just depends on the person."

PokemonShuffle,3bfa0a,butthead,14,Sun Jun 28 18:27:55 2015 UTC,"I made a video just now!  Basically, the idea is to get the coin in the bottom-left corner to the right column, without making a 3-match coin. This can be done by making 2 pokemon in a row that touch the bottom-left coin, then swapping the coin with the pokemon to complete the 3-match in the right-hand column.  After that, you look for horizontal matches that make the right-hand column drop a level or 2 (being careful not to make a 3-matched coin). Then when Meowth disrupts with the coin, you either go for the 4-match coin or set up for a 5-match coin.  If you go for the 4-match: go for it ASAP and then finish off Meowth as soon as you can.  If you go for the 5-match: you have to get Meowth really low by the time there are 2 Moves remaining, make the 5-match coin and then finish off Meowth. The 4th coin that appears on the board also has to be favourable to swap into the right-hand column without making any actual coin matches before the 5th coin appears, and the setup has to be perfect for that to happen. You also have to be careful not to kill Meowth early.    In my demo, you'll see that it was not favourable for me to go for the 5-match because the 4th coin that Meowth made could not be favourably swapped out. It wasn't adjacent to 2 identical pokemon that lines up horizontally/vertically. It was adjacent to 2 Conkeldurrs in a row, but the Conkeldurr I had in the right-hand column would have resulted in a 3-match (not what I want).  Therefore, I went for the 4-match.    TL;DR: the trick is to move the bottom-left coin to the right-hand column, then dropping the right-hand column a few levels, but not making a coin match unless it's a 4-match or a 5-match."

(...) It was adjacent to 2 Conkeldurrs in a row, but the Conkeldurr I had in the right-hand column would have resulted in a 3-match (not what I want).   Here (at 0:25, 5 moves remaining), an option is to replace the Cubone with a Conkeldurr (Row 3 Column 1's Conkeldurr <-> Row 3 Column 6's Cubone).  Then you can use that Conkeldurr to move the coin into position for the 5-match.  (edit: Though, I guess it depends on how confident you are at scraping together enough damage in the remaining two ""free"" moves, Move 6 and Move 8.)"
PokemonShuffle,3bfa0a,ElementUser,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:55:03 2015 UTC,"I suppose so, at the same time it also comes down to time efficiency. I don't want to spend too long thinking of a move (because that's just really boring and a waste of time).  I didn't see that move, but yes there are also other factors involved. In general, I go for 4-matches more than 5-matches for coin matches in the main Meowth stage because there is better consistency. I tend to get screwed over by luck if I go for the 5-matches too often, and it really depends on where Meowth disrupts the 4th coin for me to decide whether to go for the 5-match or not.  Last-Ditch Effort can also trigger when I make that Conkeldurr match you speak of to move the coin to the right-hand column when 4 Moves are remaining (yes, it has happened to me before when there are 4 moves left & not 3 moves left), which does have a reasonable chance of killing Meowth before the 5-match was made :S  Also: that's Marowak, not Cubone :)"

PokemonShuffle,3b58y4,optimist33,3,Fri Jun 26 03:21:22 2015 UTC,"Recently, I kept track of 100 tries on Meowth.  For about four days, I have used the Game Notes and edited that note each time after completing the Meowth stage. In the end, I had the following numbers for 100 tries:    Coins How often? Sum    530 57 30210   330 13 4290   130 9 1170   30 10 300   0 11 0    This makes a total of 35970 coins which are about 360 coins per try. As 360 > 330, it is definitely worth to go for 530 coins.  I have used Pokémon that needed some experience (no SE or NVE ones, power between 60 and 100, e.g. Dialga, Delphox and Manectric) and never spent too much time on a stage (I guess you could improve the results if you really focus on each turn)."
PokemonShuffle,3b58y4,Sim_X,3,Fri Jun 26 16:23:14 2015 UTC,"I normally go for the 300 and unless i get a lucky(Unlucky) Combo I get it every time.  I only ever go for the 500 if it almost sets itself up but even then sometimes It doesnt work out or on my last move left I dont have a good move to make to do enough damage.  I also use Conkeldurr, and Hetran since they both have last ditch effort, my other two are always some low lv that i never use"
PokemonShuffle,3b58y4,02pheland,3,Fri Jun 26 07:35:26 2015 UTC,500G is easy enough that I can get it every time... except when I make one little match at the very top and it somehow becomes a 11 combo.  I started running just Conkeldurr and nothing else because running two fighting types would still kill Meowth way too quickly. It also has Last-ditch Effort to secure the kill if I haven't done enough damage.
PokemonShuffle,3b58y4,MayorOfChuville,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:25:21 2015 UTC,What are your other Pokés? I thought Konkeldurr burst too much but maybe it is viable with Ghost types or with really weak Pokémon?

PokemonShuffle,3b58y4,ItsAlkron,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:50:00 2015 UTC,"500g is about 10% of the time for me, mainly due to poor set ups where I either beat Meowth too early, or not do enough damage for the last turn (since I was trying to prevent doing too much damage in fear of accidental combos..)

PokemonShuffle,3b58y4,Rivanix,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:03:54 2015 UTC,I always go for the 300. I seem to get it down in health very quickly so I just go for the quick 300. It would be nice to find out an easy way to get the 500 every time though.

PokemonShuffle,3b58y4,LioAlanMessi,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:45:47 2015 UTC,It seems going after 530 might be the way to go. I usually aim for 330 as I'm disappointed when I only get 0 or 30. But if the board presents itself in a way that makes this easy I try to aim for 530.
PokemonShuffle,3b58y4,MaiKitty,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:56:30 2015 UTC,I used to go for 300 with different Pokes I wanted to level up. Now I pick only Conkeldurr or two medium strong pokemons and it works better. Today I have just got 500g 4 out of 5 times :)

PokemonShuffle,3b4jyr,Rivanix,3,Fri Jun 26 07:55:01 2015 UTC,It was rage-inducing to say the least. At least with other tedious stuff like the Giratina stage I was consistently making progress.  I'm very relieved to be able to do even the most simple stuff like Meowth and Ampharos grind.

I didn't catch him, but my catch rate was decent and I'm patient enough to wait for him to show up again.  Despite everything, I still prefer Shuffle Safari to the R/B/Y Safari Zone.

PokemonShuffle,3b4jyr,Sekketsu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:44:00 2015 UTC,"I can't remember for sure what I used to S-rank M-aero, but I think Iused M-aero (with a mega start), optimized the rest, +5move and I also threw a disruption delay in there just for good measure.   I'm pretty sure that through all my S-ranking journey I only used C-1 on M-Mewtwo and maybe some other pokemon. There is always a cheaper way to do it :) Remember to use shuffle move since that will help loads."
PokemonShuffle,3b4jyr,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:10:11 2015 UTC,"I ended up finally getting it with something similar, but I chose Mega Start without DD, which let Aero eat through the opening blocks.

The very first time I did this, I saw Manectric. I ended up using all the Great Balls and still didn't catch it. I went back to the safari and of course it was one I already had so I quit out. When I went back in, it was Manectric again and I caught it.   So, try just quitting if it's not what you want."

I beated it, itemless using Mega Gengar, Slowbro, Ampharos (i think) and also Shaymin (his sleep charm ability is sweet to delay the disruptions, if you don't have Shaymin any other pokémon with Sleep Charm works too). All of my Pokémon are on Max. Level.  I did not beat the level on the first try, and neither would beat it all the times I tried, a bit of luck is always involved, but keep on going. I captured him on my fourth or fifth win, and I would always defeat him with 0 or 1 turns left, I was trying to catch him without the Great Ball, 12% chance sounded pretty fair to me, but then the Super Catch Rate popped up and made it go to 80ish% and i couldn't resist haha"

PokemonShuffle,3b443y,LioAlanMessi,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:34:59 2015 UTC,Why would you use ampharos? It has a useless ability due to having no dragons. Zapdos or Sceptile would be better no?
PokemonShuffle,3b443y,AleksTheGr8,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:09:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I really used him haha, that's why I put the ""I think"" in brackets, I had beaten the stage a couple days prior to my answer so I don't recall exactly what I used. But Amphy is my electrical Pokémon with the highest damage, I haven't levelled Zapdos or Raikou up yet, so I think if Amphy was suggested by the optimisation I would just let him on the team anyway because of his raw power even though Zapdos' Power of 4 can deal a great deal of damage sometimes. Raikou is not that worthy for me, because matches of 5 are not that common to make him a big deal IMO (specially on lower levels)."

There were some times when Manaphy would freeze the same set of blocks over and over, which wasn't bad at all.  Other times he would keep freezing higher and higher until I only had two rows to work with and four rows of ice below it.  I simply used my highest-powered Super Effective Pokémon (M-Ampharos, Sceptile, Zapdos, Raikou, all lvl. 7/8) and kept on fighting until I caught him.  I would beat him maybe 50% of the time with 2-3 moves left, which was a good enough rate for me to not try and change my strategy up.  Ampharos almost never got enough matches to Mega Evolve in time, so choosing a faster Mega could have been better."

So might not be the best strategy, but I had more success with this then with Ampharos as mega, it took too long to charge up (even with Pachirisu/Jolteon)"
PokemonShuffle,3b443y,SkylarGreen,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:53:12 2015 UTC,I got very lucky with simply optimising the team and finishing him with 0 moves left and 12% catch rate. Caught him even without a Great Ball.  Damn sure that'll never happen to me again

PokemonShuffle,3b443y,ShikonDragon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:57:18 2015 UTC,"Caught it on the first try with the following team using the optimize preset (no items): - Ampharos (7) - Zapdos (6) - Raikou (6) - Sceptile (6)  Ampharos turned mega as I defeated it so I suppose it would be fine if you had any other electric Pokemon here. I don't remember how many moves I had left (I think more than 5), but it was something like 30%+ capture rate. Best of luck!"

PokemonShuffle,3b21xb,Spider3412,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"wouldnt be able to say off the top of my head.  this comment lists whats been found so can work out the maths from there, assuming you pass ampharos each time, thats 50 exp a run (75 with exp boost) and 100 (150 with boost) to the crowned mon.  from this, it seems a 80 attack mon would take 7200 exp to max. at 50 a run, thats 144 runs. with crown every time that 72 runs. with exp 1.5 its 96. exp 1.5 and crowned everytime is as few as 48.  Bearing in mind that all the current ground types are weaker than 80 (60 and 70 are the best) it will take less runs than this."
PokemonShuffle,3b21xb,Swithe,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:59:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, that's alot of grinding regardless, I only play before I go to bed, so not something I'll end up wasting too many lives on."
PokemonShuffle,3b21xb,Spider3412,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:44:28 2015 UTC,"assuming they crown every time and you play 5 runs a day, thats little over a week per mon in this case, with the rest half way there if the one mon crowns every time.   Assuming the average is 1.25x (1 crown for each every four runs) thats 62.5 exp a run.   7200 to max a 80 attack mon is 115.2 (116) runs.  6720 to max a 70 attack mon 107.52 (108) runs.  6240 for a 60 attack mon 104.64 (105) runs.  Essentially, to max an entire team of four pokemon will take approximately 100 hearts if you do ampharos, everyone gets a crown once every four runs and you dont use exp x1.5. If youre only playing once/twice a day, victini will take care of the missing exp/runs leading to a maxed team in what should be less than two weeks."

My Groundon is also on Lv Max for a couple of months now.   I have two plans in mind:  Going with Mega Gengar, Groundon, Marowak and Stunfisk and rely on Groundon's raw damage + the Damage Streak Duo, or;  Levelling Drilbur up on the weekend so i have a Mega Gengar plus a Damage Streak Trio  And thanks for the tip about Electrike, it really did not cross my mind it could be a disruption on the stage, I guess i will try to put him on Lv 5 once Manectric is done levelling up."
PokemonShuffle,3b21xb,Joao_Krakenwagen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:54:21 2015 UTC,"if electrike and/or manectric end up being disruptions (best case, the only), it may be useful to run a Hitting Streak team, rather than a Damage Streak ground team. blaziken, swampert, and victini are viable candidates. bring one of the disruption mons and two or three of those i listed with or without a mega respectively, and then go to town. in this scenario it would be fantastic if items allow you to make it rain combos like the current safari stages. throw an attack power + into the mix, and you're looking at some ridiculous scores. adding atk pwr + item increases the potential coin cost to 15500  check out these comments on Hitting/Damage Streak  it really is a moot point until monday though lol"
PokemonShuffle,3b21xb,PaintThing,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:29:40 2015 UTC,"Nice, good thoughts here. I'm currently using your recommended party in the Safari (minus the mega) i.e. Groudon, Stunfisk and Marowak, and they are a good group.    I wonder if the upcoming competition will be less competitive than in the past given that some people will miss out on Manectric in the Safari and thus be less motivated to spend a lot of coins towards a high score for its mega stone."

PokemonShuffle,3b21xb,SaveThePatrat,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:27:19 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are along the lines of the fact that it is better to grind for coins than to train.

For mega might go gengar for combos. as gengar is max, currently training aerodactyl in case this competition has a lot of blocks. the other option is to forego mega and just run 4 ground types. maybe marowak so maro and stunfisk can keep that streak going  Its tough to say at this stage because we dont know if A: we'll get a ground mega next update and B: what type of hazards manectric will have."
PokemonShuffle,3b0mmt,Swithe,3,Thu Jun 25 07:46:01 2015 UTC,"unfortunately our only chances for a ground mega are through mega garchomp, mega camerupt, and primal groudon. the thing is that garchomp and camerupts primary types are not ground, so if shuffle follows the format of choosing the primary over secondary (generally), we wont have a ground mega. at all.  primal groudon would be the only chance, and while primal groudon's sprite is in the game, its hard to say when the chance for that - or the circumstances to unlock it, will actually come."
PokemonShuffle,3b0mmt,valedictions,2,Thu Jun 25 07:52:05 2015 UTC,primal groudon i think it will be a competition and it will be after a re-release of that mon

PokemonShuffle,3b0jlu,Hylian-Highwind,2,Thu Jun 25 01:12:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice :)
PokemonShuffle,3b0jlu,Hazdoc,4,Thu Jun 25 03:38:34 2015 UTC,"As noted, Gengar removing himself is more valuable than a 3rd Ground type, since the combos from only having 2 mons in play will basically end the match as soon as You get a mega match.  I'd recommend dropping Donphan for Marowak, since Marowak's Damage Streak helps a bit more than Quake, which I don't think can trigger (Electrics are immune to the paralysis effect), in case you have a ""swap Marowak and Gengar to match both"" type of situation."
PokemonShuffle,3b0jlu,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:01:23 2015 UTC,"Donphan (and Groudon, for that matter) can have their effects activate, but it won't paralyze.  It'll just be a damage boost, and I believe its only on the first match, if it triggers the ability, but I haven't tested it.  Marowak definitely does more damage, though, especially in the 2 match situation M-Gengar sets up."
PokemonShuffle,3b0jlu,ElementUser,2,Thu Jun 25 02:05:03 2015 UTC,"My mistake. Still, Marowak's much better trigger rate means his ability adds more damage, though the main thing is Gengar's Mega opening the combo."

PokemonShuffle,3b0jlu,CvxFous,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:21:03 2015 UTC,I know several of you are tracking stats. Has any of you figured out the chances of a Pokémon appearing in the Safari?
PokemonShuffle,3azxyw,Hylian-Highwind,2,Wed Jun 24 21:20:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I have played Battle Trozei a lot, even before Shuffle. Personally, I like it, but it's not really the same as Shuffle. You don't have any time or move limits, instead the wild Pokémon attack your health points. Also, you fight multiple Pokémon at the same time or in a row. You can also clear the board, so with a great combo the board gets emptier and emptier. Sadly, there's no Megaevolution included, but you have infinite tries and every Pokemon until Zygarde is available. I think, when you enjoy playing Shuffle, you may like Battle Trozei too, but it's a different concept. I'd suggest you to watch some YouTube videos, but in my opinion, it's worth the price!"
PokemonShuffle,3azxyw,Yuselwusel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"Well, but most of the pokemon are acting very slow, so you aren't that much in a hurry like in the EX stages. Of course, there are some stages where you need to be super fast (like Shaymin-Sky :/), but most of them are quite relaxed."
PokemonShuffle,3azxyw,Yuselwusel,2,Wed Jun 24 23:23:40 2015 UTC,"So here's the think, Battle Trozei is fun, but it doesn't scratch the same itch that Shuffle does. Some of the stages can only be played on certain days, and there are tricks to unlocking certain pokemon. I bought it after shuffle came out because I figured it would be better for someone like me. I stopped playing it after a few days because I didn't like the pacing, but for only $8.00 I wasn't too upset.  I personally don't like the EX Stages in Shuffle, and every level in Trozei was similar (but not anywhere near the same) as that. It's a far more quickly paced game. I like the intentionality and thoughtfulness behind Shuffle. I can think through my moves for a good while before I ever make them. Rather than being a game of reflex, it's a game where thoughtfulness counts.  With Trozei it's all about quick decisions - it's more intuitive rather than thoughtful. Don't buy it if you want an version of shuffle that you can play infinitely, but if you're interested in Pokemon Puzzle games then give it a shot.  Honestly, if you've never played it before I would recommend Pokemon Puzzle Challenge on the virtual store. I loved that game when I was younger and still play it on my 3DS from time to time. It's a different kind of puzzle, but I enjoy it quite a bit."

PokemonShuffle,3ay8lc,TheLightdarker,2,Wed Jun 24 13:40:04 2015 UTC,"I did catch Chesnaught and Greninja itemless. As for Greninja, I'd suggest using Frogadier as fourth pokemon, and optimize the rest (personally, I'd go with M-Venu instead of M-Ampha) - and a lot of practice. After I got used to the stage, I almost had every time 6-15 seconds left, which gives you at least capture rates of 11-26%. With enough patience, that should be quite a lot. The initial disruptions may be a bit hard at the beginning, but they are always the same. I always dragged a Frogadier into the frozen Frogadier cross in the bottom left corner. That should clear most of the ice in one move. Then I tried to megaevolve Venusaur as quickly as possible. For Delphox, I used M-Aero with Megastart and DD, I couldn't beat him without items, unfortunately. I hope I could help!  Edit: I did Chesnaught with M-Aero, too, but without items I never had a better capture rate than 1%, so I was very lucky."

PokemonShuffle,3auaa8,TheLightdarker,10,Tue Jun 23 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"Considering how many people fail to get the Mega stones in competitions even though using items is an insta-win, tells me that the amount of people who actually know what they're doing is not that high among the 4,5 million downloads. So there are still a lot of potential customers among the players who make the game profitable (and they wouldn't keep giving us weekly updates if the game wasn't profitable) so I wouldn't be too worried about the Meowth level being a way to bypass the pay-to-win trap of the game. Besides the late-game stages are clearly designed with Meowth farming in mind. That, or they expect the players to be millionaires."

PokemonShuffle,3auaa8,MegaMissingno,2,Wed Jun 24 01:47:39 2015 UTC,Were you using the ones that are effective like C-1 and Attack+ or just the simple ones like Mega Start and such? Because even without items reaching the cutoff is not too difficult (other than the one time when everyone was given free C-1s just before the competition) for a good player with at least somewhat decent team.
PokemonShuffle,3auaa8,disklosr,3,Wed Jun 24 03:24:01 2015 UTC,"That would have had a very big impact. Coins is the most used and helpful currency in the game. I like how they made having a big amount of coins a bit hard (as opposed to make having them for free an impossible task) so the determined people could go hunt for them as much as they wish. But my only concern if for the occasional non hardcore gamer who just wants to have fun with the game, catch all the pokes, without having to grind for coins like crazy. Those people are having a really hard time with the game and I can imaging how frustrated they get with some levels because they lack the coins."
PokemonShuffle,3auaa8,serpent-tailed-angel,2,Tue Jun 23 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"The game does give you 500 coins a day, so long as you're regular about it.

PokemonShuffle,3auaa8,CvxFous,3,Tue Jun 23 16:39:34 2015 UTC,"I would likely not have kept playing to the point I have without Meowth. I would've reached a frustration point and never played the game again. It's easy for dedicated players to be good at this game and progress at a good pace, whereas with Rumble World, even the most dedicated players can't fight the luck element present in that game. That's why I play Shuffle and haven't touched Rumble World in over a month and a half."
PokemonShuffle,3auaa8,DBrody6,2,Tue Jun 23 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"Even as a day one player, what really got me to pay up in Rumble World was the whole ""dangle content in front of the player"" aspect in the form of the balloons I didn't have access to; by accessing content early, it maybe helped me ""justify"" the purchase by thinking I was being much more efficient with the timers, lockouts, and what not. The luck portion, though (e.g., grinding for ""epic pokemon""), is definitely what made me stop playing Rumble World after I'd caught all 719 - just no appeal. No replay value there, for me."
PokemonShuffle,3auaa8,hlhlhlhl,2,Tue Jun 23 18:30:11 2015 UTC,"I just don't like the pay wall for Rumble World. I'm adamantly against free-to-play games, and that is why I told myself, no matter how hard I want to, not to spend a penny on these games. Whether that's the right attitude to have or not is up for debate, but that's why I keep playing Shuffle and not Rumble World. Shuffle makes it easy to get past the pay wall if you know what to do, and does it in such a way that it's not overly frustrating, but not terribly easy. Rumble World doesn't allow that."
PokemonShuffle,3auaa8,Gforce99,5,Wed Jun 24 00:14:58 2015 UTC,"This is something I've been thinking about for a while, I've even been paranoid that they were going to remove the coins from Meowth's Stage since it does remove the need to purchase jewels. But then I realized that the whole Meowth thing isn't just a COINcidence (sorry, I had to) and that the game might actually be balanced around it. The developers of Pokémon Shuffle aren't stupid and there's no way they could possibly have overlooked the infinite coins on Stage 37, they were the ones to put them there in the first place. I think it's just their way to reward hardcore and dedicated players, it's the way F2P should be, you should never be forced to pay if you're patient and choose grinding instead and that's why I've never gotten very far into an other F2P because when I hit that pay wall instead of paying I quit. In Shuffle however I do pay Meowth a visit grind coins for a day (or week) and jump back into action. Also, if you really think about it, isn't it kinda obvious that Stage 37 was purely designed for grinding?  Sorry if this was too long or too complicated, and I know I didn't really answer your question and instead just shared my opinion on the matter, but from a philosophical standpoint the whole ""what if Meowth didn't exist""-thing is interesting and I also encourage other people to think about it."
PokemonShuffle,3auaa8,cyberscythe,2,Tue Jun 23 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"""Sorry if this was too long or too complicated...""  Hehe, did you see my OP? I've never been one for succinctness either! : P  Seriously though, I appreciate the thoughts, and definitely share your perspective. Again, I don't have much to compare this game directly to, but I've been rather impressed at the rate at which new content is coming out for the game, and though I'll freely admit to having access to (well, almost), all the Pokemon, and using ShuffleMove all the time, I really appreciate that the devs aren't forcing the whole pay money or get out aspect of free to play down my throat. The game seems ""fair,"" to me, and the Meowth content just seems like such a fantastic way to, like you said, appeal to the more ""hardcore"" users.  Now, if I only had anyone to ever streetpass with!"
PokemonShuffle,3auaa8,fresh816163,2,Tue Jun 23 18:24:06 2015 UTC,"If they removed Meowth and they made it so that the only way to get a decent amount of gold would be with real money, I would definitely quit. 30 gold for one heart is way too little. It would take very skilled players (i.e. not me) to keep playing the game for free, since they would have to wisely manage their gold and keep their fails at a minimum (basically flawless) when spending coins, otherwise the gold lost would handicap them severely.   However, if they implemented a system similar to Pokemon Rumble's (premium access to a jewel mine after spending ~$30), I might pay for it at a later date. I don't know, maybe something like, ""Spend $30 and get 3 Meowth special stages daily!"" or something like that.   That being said, I still think that the way the game is right now is very well balanced in terms of currency, as it allows dedicated players to play through the entirety of the game for free (which is not a good business strategy; but hey, I'm not complaining).  In fact, I want to thank all the premium users that support all of us freeloading peasants. Without you, I wouldn't be able to get my bi-hourly fix. Thank you, guys!  I don't want to post such a long comment, but I'm way too deep to go back. ;-;"
PokemonShuffle,3auaa8,roxykesh,3,Tue Jun 23 18:47:58 2015 UTC,"I think maybe i'd have paid if it was something like get 100g per pokemon instead of 30, or somthing like you said."

I actually find Shuffle to be the better/more enjoyable game, so I wanted to spend some money on Shuffle too.   I'm already pretty flush with coins though and I don't need to buy hearts because I've caught most everything now. Also, jewels are surprisingly expensive — they're over a dollar each, and one gem gives you ~3000 coins. I'm thinking they're going to start selling Mega Speedups (and other permanent boost items?) later."
PokemonShuffle,3auaa8,VilAlesund,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the cost of jewels strikes me as a little absurd - and considering that everything in the game I could want, at this point (namely hearts, and maybe ""just to have fun with them"" coins), is already easy enough to come by with a bit of patience. I just don't see any player incentive - at least, for me, personally - to spend any cash in the store. I think even if jewels were way cheaper, I'd still have no real desire to ever buy any. We'll have to see what the store ends up eventually offering."

You can obtain the Premium currency in that game at a consistent if slow rate for free, but can buy it in bulk to get new pieces faster.  I would assume Nintendo had to at least look into what made the game a monumental success if they were willing to collaborate (P&D alone outgrosses Nintendo as a whole in some fiscal periods).  I wouldn't mind Mega Stones being available this way as an OPTION for those who don't want to wait/gamble on the competitions, but I don't condone the idea of them making that the exclusive option. Making it an option would benefits some people in fact, since some people might buy the stone instead and reduce the overall competition pool for the stones."

Maybe they'll be exchangeable for mega-speedups or something, someday."
PokemonShuffle,3av7y2,TheLightdarker,3,Tue Jun 23 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"I spent jewels on coins before. I think it depends on how much you enjoy grinding stage 37. It bores me that's why I cashed in those jewels. I would also keep a few. Especially for the EX stages when you're just short of winning and using that jewel also helps the catch rate. I used a jewel for Genesect and finally caught it, after spending many, many coins before. I shouldn't have wasted so many coins, the jewel was better value.  In the end I think it depends on where you are in the Game. If you still have a lot to do, or if you're as good as caught up."
PokemonShuffle,3av7y2,MaiKitty,2,Tue Jun 23 21:05:16 2015 UTC,"I'd retain them for an absolute emergency, personally. Coins and Hearts aren't impossible to obtain, and you never know what, if anything, those Jewels might allow you to buy later.  I assume the developer understands one of the most important things in these games is to never outright sell power. Convenience maybe, but one of the worst things a game can do is make something outright impossible to obtain without real money.   I'd say hold onto them until a situation arises in which you NEED them (such as being just barely below the margin for a Mega Stone and needing coins) or they start selling Mega Speed-ups."
PokemonShuffle,3av7y2,Hylian-Highwind,2,Tue Jun 23 22:56:31 2015 UTC,"if its coins vs hearts, arguably coins. hearts come with time and you can use the time to grind for exp instead of coins. you cant buy exp.  im worried with the new mega speedup items that they will become jewel-purchasable so im tempted to suggest stockpile jewels until we know for certain they wont be."
PokemonShuffle,3av7y2,Swithe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:30:08 2015 UTC,stockpile them. sharpedo and manectric are a thing. you do not want to accidentally fail to  clear a stage that you may only encounter once.
PokemonShuffle,3av7y2,PaintThing,2,Tue Jun 23 20:54:34 2015 UTC,I never encountered Sharpedo :(. But my Pokemon are leveled high enough and I'm good enough that needing them for 5 more moves on a stage is a non-factor. Guess I'll hold on to them for now though.
PokemonShuffle,3av7y2,PaintThing,2,Tue Jun 23 20:58:21 2015 UTC,"i encountered it only once, not realizing the significance of it, and failed to clear it. when i saw safari update on monday i was elated, thinking 'here we go! sharpedo at last!' ..."
PokemonShuffle,3av7y2,02pheland,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:14:47 2015 UTC,"I got frustrated at genescet failing to catch him after using all the power ups twice, so I spent my fee gems on coins to try again. (got him the 3rd time)  Like others Id recommend holding onto them in the slight chance they add new things to the gem store in future.  But if it does ever come down to coins vs hearths id always go with coins. instead of playing meowth you can then go for s ranks on other stages or just play ones for fun or level stuff up."
PokemonShuffle,3av7y2,psyducko,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:57:21 2015 UTC,i say just save them... who knows what new things they may add you can buy with diamonds.
PokemonShuffle,3av7y2,mikane,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:25:06 2015 UTC,Definitely coins are better and more needed. S-ranges and some events Pokemons can be expesive so money never too much ;) 48 000 coins - it's so many boring Meowth grinding!
PokemonShuffle,3av7y2,eggstacy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:41:39 2015 UTC,"84 Hearts in the Meowth stage would mean 27,720 coins if you get the 4 coins matched up every time, so maybe going for the coins is better?   I did calculations based on 330 coins per Meowth, because lining up 4 takes effort and isnt guaranteed which is the opposite of what the gems provide (zero effort, guaranteed coins). so 12 gems on 48,000 coins is equivalent to 145 Meowths at 330 per, or 80 hearts.   I decided the benefit of time saved was greater for coins, and it also gives me more freedom to pursue S ranks and level up."
PokemonShuffle,3av7y2,4dazan,0,Thu Jun 25 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"6 jewels on hearts, 6 on coins? thats what I do :)"
PokemonShuffle,3asw2y,Swithe,6,Tue Jun 23 06:20:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, there are 13 ""missing"" mons, due to the Meowstic and Rotom forms messing up the numbering.

PokemonShuffle,3asw2y,psyducko,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:05:41 2015 UTC,"I'd estimate about 45 alternate forms, assuming we only count forms that change type/ability/stats. That brings the total to 766 if we include hoopa and volcanion.  If we also count purely-aesthetic forms, then that adds another 88 forms, for a total of 854."
PokemonShuffle,3asw2y,psyducko,5,Tue Jun 23 23:55:28 2015 UTC,Roughly over a third of the way there...
PokemonShuffle,3asw2y,SirSmokesAlott,4,Tue Jun 23 06:32:36 2015 UTC,and it only took... four months...  it looks like shuffle might be designed to drag out over one year at this rate.

PokemonShuffle,3ar318,PockymonShiffle,6,Mon Jun 22 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"I believe that when you activate a Streak skill on one pokémon, any pokémon with the same Streak skill will also activate the boost. Perhaps the two separate abilities exist so that it'd be more difficult to make full teams of just one Streak ability to abuse the accumulating power while still having bunch of pokémon to have access to the fundamental ability?  However, don't quote me on any of this. I'm not 100% certain of these abilities and how they work.  EDIT: Found a Gamefaqs thread about this."
PokemonShuffle,3ar318,MegaMissingno,4,Mon Jun 22 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"That's most likely its purpose. They are separating out the two abilities, though identical so that there aren't too many pokemon that cross over and chain the ability.  Right now I think they're trying to create an early rift in the abilities so that as time goes by and they add pokemon, it will become more valuable over time. This seems to be happening with Victini.  It's also possible they just want to keep it to one Pokemon to prevent the ability from becoming too strong.  Currently the most useful application of damage streak is against Electric types. Their only weakness is ground. So a team of Groudon, Marowak, and Stunfisk + any Mega would be ideal (there are no Ground megas, Garchomp will most likely be typed dragon, and Camerupt will probably be fire). Groudon for base power, and two base 60 (the next strongest damage tier) both with Damage Streak.  Everyone likes Donphan, but Quake is a useless ability on Electrics because they never get paralyzes so Quake never procs.  Hopefully when Excadrill comes out they will have him keep Damage Streak like they did for Drilbur. It'll make up for the fact that there are no Ground megas. Most people (including myself) don't have Groudon so (hopefully) a base 70 with Damage Streak would be great.  Edit: Now you can also use Manectric (as well as its upcoming Mega) and Chesnaught together against water types for Hitting Streak, as well as Doublade and Swampert vs Rock types."
PokemonShuffle,3ar318,replicor,2,Mon Jun 22 21:50:30 2015 UTC,"I don't even know what Hitting Streak does, how much it increases damage by, when it activates, and what breaks the streak."
PokemonShuffle,3ar318,icravedanger,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:39:20 2015 UTC,everything is on the internet just google it. From memory i think it adds about 30% of attack points to your matches.
PokemonShuffle,3ar318,disklosr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:12:58 2015 UTC,I know. I wasn't clear on it even after Googling. It seems to be a 20% stackable bonus but broken if not triggered.
PokemonShuffle,3ar318,icravedanger,2,Tue Jun 23 16:22:55 2015 UTC,"you activate it, you get a x1,2 bonus on that damage of that move.  If in the next move you activate it again, it makes a higher multiplier, not sure but I would say it is like x1,4  this can go forever but it seems to cap at x2.  also, it seems it only works if activates with the same species, so if you use stunfisk and marowak, doing an activation with marowak, then one activation with stunfisk won't keep any mulpiplier the activation chance is similar to crow control, maybe a bit more for 3-matches  I would really love it to stack with different pokemon and make a whole team with that. At least is better than nothing, and activates far more commonly that opportunist and lookalikes"
PokemonShuffle,3ar318,Wrulfy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:19:02 2015 UTC,"The weird thing is that the moves don't even work as the descriptions suggest... I almost think it's a bad English translation. You can get a damage or hitting streak on the very first match of a puzzle. Also, when you activate either of the skills, if the next match is the same pokemon type, its pretty common for the damage to be of a normal amount, not the increased hitting or damage streak.   tl;dr:  No Clue."
PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,Boltbeam,10,Mon Jun 22 06:04:27 2015 UTC,"Add ""electrike"" to that list. (40 power, electric, ""hitting streak"" ability.)  Manetric (60 power, electric, ""hitting streak"" ability)  Additionally ive been running M-gengar, Groudon and Donphan so far and doing fine. Mostly in light of the fire and electric mon ive seen so far. Stunfisk for damage streak might be good i unno. (confirmed now. stunfisk is a great backup if you missed out on groudon. keep making swap matches with him and M-gengar and youll keep your streak AND get mega combos)  core strategy seems to be M-gengar, then two of the following: groudon, donphan, stunfisk"

PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,NoctusNoctowl,8,Mon Jun 22 18:28:06 2015 UTC,"What I used for Manaphy: Mega-Bro (max) / Shaymin (5) / Sceptile (7) / Zapdos (7). Slowbro allows to keep combos going by destroying some barriers (before mega evolving) so I found it more useful than amphy, while shaymin's sleep charm just wrecks manaphy (aim for those 5-matches asap). With this setup I can beat manaphy consistenly without using any items  As for the safari pokemon: Mega-Gengar (9) / Groudon (9) / Donphan (9) Really easy to beat every single one of them, only spend great Balls on Manectric and Darmanitan since you'll almost likely never see them again unless you spend a crazy amount of hearts like me."

Second heart - Manectric, kinda tricky, depends on the mega you choose, had to use great ball, didn't want it to be Sharpedo all over again. Third heart - Darumaka, like Stantler, very easy caught it with 38 % or 48 % no great ball. Fourth heart - Repeat of Darumaka. Fifth heart - Darmanitan, kinda tricky but once I got my mega going it was very easy, caught it with 41 % no great ball.

PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,KamuKid,2,Mon Jun 22 20:10:51 2015 UTC,"Just encountered Darumaka (fire). Had one neutral, one SE, one NVE, and it was incredibly easy. A bit boring, to be honest, though maybe the rare ones will be more interesting. Catch rate isn't too bad either."
PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,Inequilibrium,2,Mon Jun 22 07:38:23 2015 UTC,Whelp had to use 3 great balls to catch Darmanitan. Also used about 20 hearts and haven't found Manetric. :(
PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,giraffe196,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:11:08 2015 UTC,"I would avoid using coins and great balls (at least more than one) on Safari; unless it's Manetric. If you TURN OFF the game after using a GREAT BALL and did not catch, you don't lose any COINS.   if you use M-Gengar, depending on your swap; and sometimes luck; you should be able to beat them withing 2-3 moves; and higher catch rate and even higher with great ball;  instead of throwing more great balls, cut your loses and eventually the poke will come back and you can catch it the next time.  HEARTS do suck to waste; but since it takes more hearts to make 2,500 coins, i rather save hearts than waste the coins.  GOOD LUCK!  TL;DR: save your coins in safari, you will eventually see these pokes again if you keep at it. (with manetric as exception)"
PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:55:59 2015 UTC,I actually caught Manetric without using coins a few minutes ago so I'm thankfully done with the safari. Now I can focus in on Manaphy and then start training up a team for Mega Manectric next week.
PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,giraffe196,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"Good luck :)   Stage 130 is so long and sometimes annoying, but since it's electric it will be a good stage to train for Mega Manectric event.   I think the event will be interesting - because of RNG, not everyone will have Manectric; so competition participation will be effected? (affected?)... or the game is genius making everyone spend hearts after hearts to find the manectric to participate in the upcoming event."
PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"To me, Darmanitan is worth spending your coins too. It will likely take more than 5 hearts to encounter him and Manectric, so buying Great Balls is worth it in money; plus, this is not a permanent stage, so you would rather use a great ball and be done with it than miss the opportunity to catch it until they let us play the safari again IMHO."

PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,Zekrom-9,4,Mon Jun 22 09:31:59 2015 UTC,Most safari pokémon are really short stages so you don't have much time to activate your mega. Gengar's incredible speed as well as godly combo ability make it the superior choice over anything else.
PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,MegaMissingno,-6,Mon Jun 22 09:45:33 2015 UTC,"I just beat, captured and S-Ranked Electrike, Manectric and Stantler all in a row using M-Blastoise. And it evolved every time. M-Gengar isn't even near as ""godly"" as people praise it for. It's combo ability isn't even that great, many other megas are on par with it considering combos. Dare I even say some are better? It might be one of the better megas, yes, but it's far from being ""superior to anything else""."
PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,Zekrom-9,2,Mon Jun 22 09:56:02 2015 UTC,Have you not used Mega Gengar in 3 pokémon stage? It takes two turns to activate and from there you get a 100 combo to finish the stage.
PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,MegaMissingno,-4,Mon Jun 22 10:09:58 2015 UTC,I already do get such combos due to mega icons being scarce in the combo a mega Pokémon creates.
PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,Zekrom-9,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:09:06 2015 UTC,i'm also using m-gengar due to its combos. you can usually mega in 2 turns and as soon as you mega you win the stage with ~100 combo. he creates complexity -1 leaving the stages with only 2 super effective pokemon lol :)
PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,stavross100,-5,Mon Jun 22 11:36:13 2015 UTC,"That's the same with almost any other mega evolution. Mega icons are extremely scarce in combos started by the mega itself, so the Complexity-1 effect is already there. At least that's what I experience lol"

PokemonShuffle,3aomfg,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:37:36 2015 UTC,"Downvotes is not an illness, this person will survive. Thankfully everybody has their own opinion :p Although Zekrom-9 seems to say he got fairly good results with another Mega and that should not be overlooked, I think Gengar is mostly popular because it is useful on most stages, because it relies on its ability and not its type or power. A lot of stages are super easily S-Ranked with Mega Gengar because it takes few matches to mega evolve him, and I do not think the same results can be achieved with other Pokes. But right now we are talking about Safari, so I guess we can agree on the fact that no matter what Mega you take, you will wreck the stage.  And do not bully poor RNGs, they are unbiased and do their job well. People think they are unlucky because they cannot handle not being lucky all the time! #FreeTheRNG"

PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,WillExis,13,Mon Jun 22 07:59:07 2015 UTC,Watch manectric never spawn for me now
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,OFatalChaos,0,Mon Jun 22 08:04:14 2015 UTC,to be fair i only had a double in this new safari and got em all
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Fenor,14,Mon Jun 22 10:44:13 2015 UTC,"Poor Charizard, not this time."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,elleotribal,9,Mon Jun 22 12:11:23 2015 UTC,"We got lucario-blastoise-banette-venusaur, so I guess charizard should be the next one"
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Wrulfy,3,Mon Jun 22 13:21:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with this pattern. The bigger question will be, Charizard X or Y?"
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,psyducko,3,Mon Jun 22 17:00:06 2015 UTC,"I think y, wee need more flying megas."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Alimagdi,3,Mon Jun 22 18:59:58 2015 UTC,Would his type change in mega?   It really depends on the ability?   X = Clears an X   Y = Erases up to 10 of the same type  Just guessing what abilities it can be...
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:19:29 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's probably why his mega would be useful. Hahahaha the x avidly would be very cool!"
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Alimagdi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:28:12 2015 UTC,There hasn't been any other MEGA that changes type; why would Charizard be different?
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:46:12 2015 UTC,"That's true, but charizard x gains dragon typing. If you want a fire mega blaziken will come soon."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Alimagdi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:49:18 2015 UTC,"yeah, the theory is after the kanto starters get megas; the ORAS starters will be next..."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:54:21 2015 UTC,"Yup, let's hope we get charizard y as flying because we already have altaria."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Alimagdi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:58:10 2015 UTC,My hopes and dreams confirm that Charizard should indeed be next
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,TheLightdarker,7,Tue Jun 23 22:29:11 2015 UTC,Ooooh maaan...i knew not having groudon would hurt a lot someday...
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Mukuro_Ikusaba,7,Mon Jun 22 08:32:36 2015 UTC,he's the best ground type hands down
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Fenor,5,Mon Jun 22 10:45:10 2015 UTC,"managed to catch manectric on my second foray into the safari zone.  im a bit worried for this mega competition because we still dont have a ground mega, so i'm assuming that mega gengar will be the one everyone uses for it."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,valedictions,4,Mon Jun 22 08:13:50 2015 UTC,"because we still dont have a ground mega   And won't for a very long time. Primal Groudon is the first, and last, opportunity for a Ground-mega to ever exist in this game."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,DBrody6,11,Mon Jun 22 08:33:35 2015 UTC,"Both Mega Camerupt and Mega Garchomp could very well be Ground types.  I don't think Primal Groudon will be a mega anyway since Groudon doesn't have the Mega stone slot. By the looks of things, Primal Groudon will be considered an alternate form similar to Keldeo's or Shaymin's two forms. This would explain the pitiful 70 base power on Groudon and Kyogre since they would have an upgrade for them with the proper 80 base power."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,MegaMissingno,2,Mon Jun 22 09:42:18 2015 UTC,"I doubt that Garchomp will be ground, however I'm almost certain that Camerupt will be as Sharpedo was Dark instead of water and Camerupt will be the only Ground. We have plenty of Fire megas"
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,SamChallis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:37:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not too hopeful for that either but we would have a bajillion Dragon megas if some of them didn't use their secondary types instead. This way Camerupt could be on par with Sharpedo as a weaker variant whereas Garchomp could be the stronger one. Maybe even base power of 80 like T-Tar, please?"
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,MegaMissingno,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:45:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe since the primal regresion occurs automatically at the start of the battle, they will work like the other megas, but always starting at the start of the stage"
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Wrulfy,2,Mon Jun 22 13:20:39 2015 UTC,"Is magnetric confirmed to be Sharpedo 2: electric boogaloo, or is relatively common?"
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Wrulfy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:22:11 2015 UTC,"I'll just say I played about 10 games and saw Manectric once, mostly because as soon as I saw him I spammed Great Balls in case he didn't show up again."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:10:29 2015 UTC,I had to use about 30 hearts before I found Manectric.
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,TheLightdarker,2,Tue Jun 23 22:28:24 2015 UTC,"Manectite competition will be very interesting; will only those who have Manectric participate? Meaning, it might be easier to get the stone?   I guess it also sucks if you win the stone and don't have Manectric; or have to wait for the Manectric to spawn again in another event or repeat event."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,psyducko,2,Mon Jun 22 17:03:39 2015 UTC,"Safari lasts for two weeks, so the competition will start in the middle of it. Everyone will probably just go for it."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,clariwench,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:46:10 2015 UTC,"I imagine others will join in anyway, either with the intent of scoring low for a jewel, or to get the stone in case the safari event comes back."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,serpent-tailed-angel,3,Mon Jun 22 19:36:35 2015 UTC,"After around 10 tries, Manectric appears, lame stage with few zone to move until much later while he keeps freezing, and you don't want to waste money on powerups because maybe you get another stage instead of Manec.  Defeated him, 17% catchrate, I miss, I used 5 more Great Balls, all of them missed, he runs away.  I obviously closed the game to don't lose that 12500 coins, but c'mon, I hope the next time I catch him"
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,MetaThPr4h,2,Mon Jun 22 09:22:42 2015 UTC,"Same for me, but with 20%... That was frustrating."
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Yuselwusel,3,Mon Jun 22 11:50:55 2015 UTC,use Mega gengar and focus on build that mega he'll die very soon this way
PokemonShuffle,3aoulb,Fenor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:45:41 2015 UTC,"I wonder how rough of a competition this one will be. Obviously not everyone will have manectric because of the RNG factor; not everyone will encounter it, then those who do don't have a 100% chance of catching it. And the fact we don't have a ground type mega is worrying so I wonder what the best lineup would be to get a good score D: I'm banking on my Gengar-M, Groudon, Donphan and Marowak to get me the Manectite."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,The_Watcher_Nos,15,Tue Jun 23 00:13:05 2015 UTC,"This issue isn't as black and white as it looks. Fewer people were in the play pool this time than last time, so fewer people needed it.   Getting jewels is the right of anybody with with a heart that wanted to play, and they probably didn't disrupt anybody from getting their megastone anyway.   Going for jewels does not make you selfish, but I suppose if you really wanted to be selfless why enter at all? Your megastone could easily go to somebody more deserving!"
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,emperorbob1,3,Tue Jun 23 10:19:15 2015 UTC,"I feel that anyone who wants a stone gets one as the coin cost for an all-item attempt here was minimal, especially since compexity -1 wasn't an option.  Anyone who tried would have got one. I got my blastoisite and didn't feel as if it was difficult in any way."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,Hobocannibal,3,Tue Jun 23 11:35:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I got my two jewels and I didn't use any items or even ShuffleMove for that. Anyone can easily use just a single Attack Power+ item and break the cutoff if they actually wanted the stone. Besides, the person at #15,001 (the cutoff in EU was 15k) could've very well been someone with the Blastoisinite so my contribution might've not even been able to generate another Mega Stone."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,MegaMissingno,-13,Tue Jun 23 19:10:14 2015 UTC,"Why do you continue to feel the need to threadcr*p?    Let the rest of us enjoy this ""thank you"" post/thread in peace.    I don't really care how or why you justify screwing over fellow Pokemon Shuffle players for 99 cents (1 jewel = $0.99)."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,emperorbob1,5,Tue Jun 23 11:10:06 2015 UTC,"Then how do you justify screwing over fellow pokemon shuffle players for something they can never get back? If you didn't play thats somebody else who could get a megastone.   I personally got a megastone this time. People who went for jewels? Didn't screw anyone over. Especially not me. Didn't even spend any coins. I suppose now you are going to say I shouldn't have played at all because I took the stone from somebody else?  So let me say from the bottom of my heart, as a stone winner this time, that those who went for two jewels were 100% just in doing so. Only one person in the world is judging you. Thank you for your support of this game."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,emperorbob1,2,Tue Jun 23 13:36:06 2015 UTC,"When you do I will. Doesn't that kind of, yanno, help my point that a lot of people already had the jewel and the low player counter was already inflated by people going for jewels. Be they one or two.   At least somewhere people realized they could show their skills in this competition and get their two jewels. Without taking a megastone from anybody."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,emperorbob1,2,Wed Jun 24 02:34:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, well, good luck in all you do. Hope you get that megastone next time."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,OFatalChaos,5,Wed Jun 24 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"Did 1 time, ranked 50k got my jewel left"
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,Porkpants81,3,Wed Jun 24 03:00:08 2015 UTC,Yup I played once got a rank of like 41K and decided that my hearts could be better spent beating the new levels and safari.
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,kenniky,5,Wed Jun 24 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't pay enough attention but I was somewhere in the 100,000s. Pretty funny."

PokemonShuffle,3artgc,emperorbob1,5,Tue Jun 23 14:50:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah thanks everyone! Missed it the last time around cause I was waiting to post a score last minute and forgot lol. I just played once with power ups and got in the top 2,000 so I know a lot of people weren't trying lol"
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,RuneTheFifth,2,Tue Jun 23 00:28:07 2015 UTC,"If you got in the top 2000 then most people playing for jewels didn't matter. In fact, I'm pretty sure more than half of the players in the entire competition this time were after jewels. It's what the lower player count suggests."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,emperorbob1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:31:54 2015 UTC,"Over 100,000 people in one region would suggest that there were still plenty of people who could have won the stone, although the number of people this time who were throwing their all into it was probably lower."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,Wrulfy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:59:09 2015 UTC,It was much lower in both the NA and EU. By a good 20-30 thousand in the US along from my look a few nights ago. Got reports similar from a euro buddy.

PokemonShuffle,3artgc,Yuselwusel,3,Wed Jun 24 02:32:44 2015 UTC,Got 2 25 and 26 combos on the first turns.
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,Mukuro_Ikusaba,15,Wed Jun 24 11:20:46 2015 UTC,"Oh come on, it's a competition, I can't hear that ""please let others win"" stuff anymore. :( I think if someone wants the Blastoisite, then that person should fight for it instead of complaining on reddit that other players are soooo mean when they are trying to win a competition a second time. If the Blastoisite or any other Megastone was for everyone, then it would have been distributed to everyone, but thats not the case. Just my opinion."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,Hobocannibal,7,Wed Jun 24 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"Its a matter of being considerate. Its just like leaving your seat for someone else in the bus.  When the first competition was around, my team was too basic. So i can understand if more new-ish players dont have the best set up, or highly leveled pokemon. And i precisely think that this re-dos are chances for these kind of players to get stuff  I DO think its a selfish move, I'd prefer someone else having a bigger benefit...than just an extra jewel. Its not unfair, but it is selfish to me. No, i have no proof of player 30,001 missing out but theres no proof it was otherwise neither.  But as stated before its a competition at the end...not a niceness contest. And everyone has the right to do as they please. I  wouldnt do it. I dont agree with others doing it. But thats my opinion"
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,N0gai,7,Wed Jun 24 19:10:23 2015 UTC,"I got my blastoisite this time around, but i wouldn't consider it a challenge getting it. I feel that any all-item run will obtain the stone."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,Yuselwusel,4,Tue Jun 23 07:19:33 2015 UTC,"I also had to use items the first time the stone was available (...and I even used C-1 back then, so I used like twice as many coins), so why should people now have a free win? I didn't play to win and I didn't use any item, so, I was ranked around 17k in Europe. Really ANYONE who invested like 2k coins (...or the 99c you mention so often) was able to get the Megastone. So don't even try to make people feel guilty for actually participating."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,Yuselwusel,4,Tue Jun 23 22:16:47 2015 UTC,"If you're not able to discuss a topic without insulting, then I guess you are in the wrong place anyway and not less ""pathetic"" than I."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,emperorbob1,2,Tue Jun 23 10:03:00 2015 UTC,"First of all, there's no need to overreact, I did nothing wrong and just wanted to share my opinion, but you did not know anything better than to insult me.  Also, you are on reddit, and reddit is a discussion platform. I am free to share my opinion, and if you don't like it, then simply don't answer, but insulting is just unfair behaviour.  And when did I say that I feel selfish/guilty/whatever? Nor did I say that I got two jewels, and even though you are judging me without even knowing. Instead of insulting and overreacting, either ignore me or discuss in an appropriate way.  And, to come back to the topic: an extra jewel saves me 10 hearts that I would have to spend on Meowth (37). So, of course, I could spend 99c for one jewel, but anyone who wanted to have a Blastoisinite could have done the same in order to buy items, which definitely got you a good score. Even without items and mediocre pokemon, I could get a score over 20k, so don't tell me it's difficult. And anyone who does not want to either spend coins or money in order to get the megastone, or simply just train, that does not deserve the stone, I think. It's a special price for people who have the will to fight for the price."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,Yuselwusel,2,Tue Jun 23 11:26:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think a lot of people understand that people who don't use items rank lower, and most that want the stone(Seriously) will blow coins on it.   It's not shoving people off when to seriously rank at the top you'd need to blow more coinage than you'd gain with two jewels."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,emperorbob1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:43:54 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I don't know what's wrong with you, so it might be better that you don't waste your time on me :)"

PokemonShuffle,3artgc,elleotribal,4,Tue Jun 23 14:10:16 2015 UTC,"If the person who missed out wanted it bad enough, they could've easily spent 99 cents on some coins to buy items. And if they bought items, it makes it pretty easy to win a mega stone. This isn't kindergarten where everyone gets a participation medal, and people shouldn't be guilt tripped into letting others win. If they choose to do so, that's great. But they're not a bad person if they dont."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,Rez91,2,Wed Jun 24 02:43:14 2015 UTC,"""This isn't kindergarten where everyone gets a participation medal""  Loved this so much I wanna tatoo this phrase on my forehead.  I don't understand people who say that 'there are other players who deserved more'. I don't know how old some of you are, but life isn't about 'deserving'. You 'deserve' what you work for. If you didn't get the Blastoisinite on the second competition, I'm sorry, but you're probably lazy or simply not a good player."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,CKMo,3,Wed Jun 24 02:31:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know that stress of being on the cusp of ranking and having to check all the time wondering if you should invest in items just to make sure.

PokemonShuffle,3artgc,ludecknight,2,Tue Jun 23 15:11:44 2015 UTC,"Funny story about the Lucarionite repeat event.  Every time I had participated in an event up to that point (and since), the game had always asked me if I wanted to submit my high score.  I was curious to see how much of an improved score I would have compared to the first Lucario event.  My plan was to go all out with all the items and everything, see how high of a score I got, and then say no to submitting my high score.  But then, for some dumb reason, the game DIDN'T ask me if I wanted to submit my score.  It submitted it automatically.  I don't know why it happened, and it's never happened since, but it caused me to accidentally get into the top 30,000 and ruin some other guy's dreams."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,Hobocannibal,2,Tue Jun 23 00:33:49 2015 UTC,"Mine has never asked me. This event, the previous lucario event. Safe to assume it doesn't ask anymore, if it did before"

As someone who got a blastoisinite the first time around, I'm of the opinion that competition or no, it would have been a nice courtesy to those who missed or failed the event last time to not prevent someone from getting an event only item."

PokemonShuffle,3artgc,makoblade,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:43:02 2015 UTC,There is a certain challenge to see how low you can get. Did that in the second Lucario one just to see how bad I could do.
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,Kotakia,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:46:03 2015 UTC,"True. I thought finding matches that trigger multiple combos was hard, then I found making double-sure I only get single matches was a bit harder. I think, at most, I only hit a 3-combo in my single playthrough with ineffective mon"
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,emperorbob1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"If the player already had the mega stone, doesn't it just give them two jewels and then move on down the list to give the next highest player a stone?  At least that's what the event stated in-game."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,warthundersfw,2,Tue Jun 23 15:10:58 2015 UTC,It still only gave 2 jewels OR a megastone to the top 30k. After that everyone just got one jewel.
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,icravedanger,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:59:16 2015 UTC,"The general idea is what the jewels would be costly to attain keeping up with people buying items to get the megastone. So those players would spend less and rank lower, lest they spend more than they get in return.   So you could get two jewels and not screw anybody who was seriously playing the competition for a megastone."
PokemonShuffle,3artgc,valedictions,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:30:57 2015 UTC,I played for two jewels and ranked around 20k. It was quite easy and I feel if someone missed out they weren't really trying.

PokemonShuffle,3alksy,SamChallis,5,Sun Jun 21 12:09:58 2015 UTC,Inb4 once a day Maractus event!
PokemonShuffle,3alksy,4dazan,5,Sun Jun 21 12:17:48 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna guess a Pokemon Safari for the daily (with Electrike, Manectric, Darumaka, Darmanitan and Stantler) and Manaphy for the special (to celebrate 4.5 million downloads) - these are, of course, totally random guesses off the top of my head!"

PokemonShuffle,3alksy,OneGoodRib,3,Mon Jun 22 06:19:24 2015 UTC,Hopefully the Hoenn trio make a comeback for us players who started too late to catch them or mew but just in time to explore dank Celebi
PokemonShuffle,3alksy,KamuKid,0,Sun Jun 21 22:52:36 2015 UTC,"So, new week is here.  Safari has returned, and I have seen Darumaka so far. Last safari, every mon besides Spinda was vulnerable to Bug, so let's try and find a ""magic"" type for this Safari to save team space.  Also, Manaphy's available."
PokemonShuffle,3alksy,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:05:50 2015 UTC,"I've seen Darumaka, Manectric (has Hitting Streak, but BP 60, blegh), and Electrike, so it looks like Ground might be the magic type here."
PokemonShuffle,3alksy,OneGoodRib,0,Mon Jun 22 06:18:15 2015 UTC,My money's on a new set of daily Pokemon (hopefully NOT another Safari or once-a-day Pokemon) and a repeat of a legendary - maybe Kyogre.
PokemonShuffle,3alksy,OneGoodRib,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:09:46 2015 UTC,I think  it is a. Repeat of the old safari

PokemonShuffle,3alksy,Hylian-Highwind,-9,Sun Jun 21 13:11:18 2015 UTC,"That thread has a lot more than just ""predictions"". A 1 to 1 descriptive title would be overly long and cluttered.  And that doesn't change the fact that this thread is essentially a carbon copy with even less meat in it."
PokemonShuffle,3ale5n,MegaMissingno,3,Sun Jun 21 10:04:15 2015 UTC,"What did you think of this week's update?  Was not a fan of that Dialga stage. Once I beat it, I blew some coins to make sure I caught it so I could move on without looking back.  What were you doing this week?  Leveling.  How did you do in the M-Blastoise competition? Did you aim high or low?  I already have the stone so I was just looking to get credit for showing up.  Predictions for next week?  I'd like to see some new Daily Pokemon. I understand not everyone has had a chance at the older releases, but is it out of the question to run two sets of daily pokes?"
PokemonShuffle,3ale5n,Underfyre,2,Sun Jun 21 12:52:29 2015 UTC,"because dialga is a great challenge stage, i highly doubt we'll see another great challenge (regice, palkia) next week. im hoping new daily pokemon. if they do bring back an old series of daily pokemon i hope it's the rotoms, because i missed one.  i hope they bring back the old pokemon safari not because i enjoyed it (i hated it as a mechanic), but i did miss out on them and it's bugging me lately.  i've still been hoping they'd do a ""one new thing one old thing"" with updates where maybe they'd introduce a new great challenge but also give you the ability to challenge kyogre if you've never caught it."
PokemonShuffle,3ale5n,valedictions,2,Sun Jun 21 16:34:10 2015 UTC,"What did you think of this week's update?  Totally needed, I used all the money and even had to grind more to get catch every single one, Conkeldurr and unlucky EX catches made me waste so much coins.  What were you doing this week?  Grind money hard, I spended all the time the other patch to lvlMax Pokes and ended up with 55000 only for that new stages, that's why I needed to grind that much, I want to get first to 99999 coins (currently 72840) before trying to grind levels (but to be fair, Meowth spamming helped too, currently lvl 8 with Conkeldurr and 6 with the other strong ones).  How did you do in the M-Blastoise competition? Did you aim high or low?  I won't lie, even if I already had the Blastoise megastone, I tried to at least tryhard 2-3 times for a good score to get 2 jewels = extra money, if I don't get it, it's k, currently 13712 in Europe with only 15000 getting it, so I won't have success unless I try it one last time this night.  Predictions for next week?   Hopefully another calmed week with just 1-2 little things added, I want to get to 99999 coins and have the strongest new ones (Dialga, Tyranitar and Giratina) with atleast lvl 8 to do well in the new heavy update."
PokemonShuffle,3ale5n,MetaThPr4h,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:44:11 2015 UTC,"I'm just glad they brought back Mega Blastoise since it's the only thing in the entire game I don't have. Of course an 80 power steel type and free stuff isn't bad either. I didn't mind a small update, it gave me a chance to catch and S-Rank the Kalos Starters."

I would like a calm still, I am just 3 shy of a full S rank, and i need to earn the 3 ex ones, so close, and catching up, I love it."
PokemonShuffle,3ale5n,Tjgalon,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah - I invested in a disruption delay for each and every stage, 50-100, and ended up failing, even then, a couple times. This update definitely hit me in the coin purse!"

If I can't get it by the end, I'm just going to use ShuffleMove. I used up all of my free +5 moves trying to catch it...  What were you doing this week?  Mostly leveling up, though I didn't have much time because of my job's dumb hours. I just finished level 50 of Giratina, so that's out of the way.   How did you do in the M-Blastoise competition?  I aimed low, because I already have the stone. I still used an optimized team, but I just wanted to play with M-Venusaur. I think I'm in the 77,000's.   Predictions  The repeated dailies are done, right? So maybe we'll get new dailies?   I'd love to see a Ditto event where it changes types during the battle."

It seemed pretty good, although it was the first update since i started playing, so not much to judge it off  What were you doing this week? I was going through the main stage, getting a team for the mega blastoise competition, and then subsequently getting mega blastoise.  How did you do in the M-Blastoise competition? Did you aim high or low?  I aimed to get the mega stone, and i succeeded, ranking in around 7600(Europe). it was a real rush to get myself a good team and enough coins in time, but i just pulled through! (ty to everyone here who helped me figure out the best team i could scrape together in time!)  Predictions for next week? I reckon there's gonna be a manaphy to celebrate 4.5 million players, as well as a pokemon safari with darumaka, darmanitan, electrike, manectric and stantler"
PokemonShuffle,3ale5n,rhysdog1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:35:25 2015 UTC,"I pretty much spent the first half of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) just plowing through levels 50-100 on Giratina to get the third Mega Speed-up. It was a hell but I succeeded. The rest of the week I spent S ranking the main stages which mostly consisted of farming the Meowth stage because Giratina left me completely broke. I still have to S rank Conkeldurr and Tyranitar to get to Greninja.   Dialga I luckily managed to catch itemless. I liked that the stage was a challenging one with a puzzle in it but not Regirock-like challenging.  Even though I already have Blastoisinite, I decided to compete for the 2 jewels. My score is 26838 which currently in EU rankings is placing me at 6788/61533. This was completely itemless though and I'm not going to use any so if anyone actually wants to get the Mega Stone, they can easily just pop an Attack power+ to roflstomp my current score, even if they don't have Mega Ampharos.  For the next week I'm predicting a new Pokémon Safari. We haven't had one in a while and since the Daily pokémon and Giratina stage are going away tomorrow, we'll probably get another heart drain. I predict that there will be Numel, Camerupt, Finneon, Lumineon and Tauros. Maybe an old legandary like Mew could also reappear? Or a new Regi?"

PokemonShuffle,3aij1l,feenyx1,6,Sat Jun 20 14:55:53 2015 UTC,"Giratina and Zapdos are both super useful. Most of the Ex legendaries if they start with a base of 70 are good, 80 is even better."
PokemonShuffle,3aij1l,Kotakia,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:08:26 2015 UTC,Other notable pokemon I have are lucario and absol. Is there any point where I can get their mega stones?
PokemonShuffle,3aij1l,Kotakia,3,Sat Jun 20 17:49:25 2015 UTC,"Absol's mega stone isn't available yet. Lucario's is only available via competition and it's been run twice already, I don't think you'll see that again for awhile."
PokemonShuffle,3aij1l,Vinylzen,2,Sat Jun 20 17:55:54 2015 UTC,Lucario's mega isnt always super useful. But Lucario himself is still massively useful and a must have Fighting type. He's one of the strongest you'll have access to up until Conkledurr
PokemonShuffle,3aij1l,ElementUser,2,Sat Jun 20 18:20:32 2015 UTC,"And even then, Lucario's regular ability (Pummel) is very useful. So Lucario is probably better than Conkeldurr anyway."
PokemonShuffle,3aij1l,NobleArrgon,3,Sat Jun 20 18:46:03 2015 UTC,"i think the only legendaries you should neglect are the 3 dogs, power of 5 is a pretty hard ability to trigger, and there are many better fire/water/lightning pokemon with 70 base damage later in the game"
PokemonShuffle,3aij1l,ElementUser,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:49:38 2015 UTC,"Arguably not for Electric, Raikou was the only legendary dog I really use because of the lack of super-effective pokemon against Water types (only Grass & Electric).  Though now we have more pokemon like Shaymin & Tangrowth with 70 base power for Grass types, and Chesnaught just came out too. Still, these aren't accessible until very late game, so Raikou is still useful for a large portion of the game."
PokemonShuffle,3aij1l,Hylian-Highwind,2,Sat Jun 20 18:47:47 2015 UTC,"Giratina and Zapdos you have are both very useful.  A General rule of thumb is that a Pokemon is worth consideration only if its base power (Power at level 1) is 70 or more. There are some exceptions depending on if the mon has a Mega, or a useful ability (like Absol's Mind Zap).  Most of the EX mons (besides the Kanto starters) have 70 power or such an ability, so they're all worth catching.  I'd recommend trying to get as many S Ranks as you can if you ever get stuck, because there tends to be a legendary that does well against a Mega boss if you get stuck. Definitely train the legendaries if you have them."
PokemonShuffle,3aig89,treecko4ubers,3,Sat Jun 20 14:26:43 2015 UTC,"For me right now it's Lickilicky. That's the last stage I need to S-Rank. I have tried some different strategies, but none are getting me that S-Rank. I already know that beginning trick to clean out most of the Pokemon."
PokemonShuffle,3aig89,Exodiafinder687,4,Sat Jun 20 15:47:10 2015 UTC,"the trick for that stage, is to ignore the left and right most columns, dont waste your moves trying to clear his disruptions in those columns and focus on the 4 middle columns. Easy S-rank after i figured that out"
PokemonShuffle,3aig89,NobleArrgon,3,Sat Jun 20 16:28:52 2015 UTC,There is a very specific move I recall reading (probably could find it if you search Lickilicky on the sub) that clears most of the Lickilicky and Lickitung from the initial board to give you more space to work with.

I've basically tried every item combo that didn't include C-1, using Mega Aero himself, and every SE bar Blastoise with no luck.  I'll try with Blastoise after the event, but this thing is giving me more trouble than main series says it should.  6/25/15 Edit: Finally managed to get it with Aerodactyl and Moves + Mega Start. Cut it close enough that I think I needed the near max mons I chose. Ah well, onto Greninja."

PokemonShuffle,3aig89,valedictions,0,Sat Jun 20 16:40:35 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about the guide currently stickied, have you tried it with mega start? Stage was ass if I remember and required a bit of luck to S-rank. Steelix, currently in bed and can't remember what the stage was like."
PokemonShuffle,3aig89,NobleArrgon,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:01:24 2015 UTC,"yep, tried mega start and everything. ended with a b rank, so im just gonna do a different strategy instead. i suppose."
PokemonShuffle,3aig89,valedictions,0,Sun Jun 21 01:36:50 2015 UTC,"I will say, Steelix is actually significantly easier if you throw a Complexity -1 into the items to remove the drop down Onix. Mega Start Aero ensures he never gets any blocks out, and lets your SE mons combo pretty well.  With that, I finished at a margin that didn't need Moves +5 (though I wouldn't risk going without)."
PokemonShuffle,3aig89,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:16:50 2015 UTC,"yeah, but of the 5 i have to finish a lot of them have recommended complexity -1, so im just trying to figure out which of the 5 that i have left can be done without a complexity -1."
PokemonShuffle,3aig89,valedictions,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:37:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I can say from experience that, while I did have to max everyone out, I did mange to beat Onix and Doublade at least without the C-1. Took a full load out of the other items, but no C-1.  Onix and Doublade are much easier if they're not causing disruptions so that there's actually space on the board. So I will just say that, from my own experience, those two at least should be possible without Complexity -1, though I should disclose I used Mega Lucario for Doublade."
PokemonShuffle,3aig89,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:13:41 2015 UTC,i used mega lucario on doublade too and got around a b rank in my run. mega lucario rarely ever causes a combo and often times will kill my combos when im using it though. is there feasibly a better mega to use for doublade?  onix i havent really tried mostly because im waiting to get my mega blastoise (along with mega aerodactyl).
PokemonShuffle,3aig89,valedictions,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:38:42 2015 UTC,"For Doublade, I guess standard Gengar might work.  Maybe Lucario worked for me on Doublade because Klefki makes comboing a lot harder, so I just erred on the side of raw damage for him.  I think Onix could probably be beaten with Blastoise as well. Main thing is just that Lucario has a type or two without SE competition right now. For Onix I MAY have used Mawile, since I went Mega Start anyway and it was more combo conducive."

I forgot the strategy that I used back then, but I did it again just for you :) First try with M-Gengar, Giratina, Yveltal and Zoroark went bad. I S-rank'd on my second try with M-Banette, Gengar, Giratina and Haunter. I was a bit lucky with RNG maybe, but I had 9 moves left, so it should be doable without that much luck. Just try to align 4 Giratinas when possible, otherwise Banette to M-evolve it quickly."

PokemonShuffle,3aif59,KamuKid,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"Audino mega evolves soon enough and will help you get rid of the ice columns easily. That takes 4-5 turns. Then you should expect a combo on the top part in 1 to 3 turns that will defeat Raichu. Hopefully you'll do it in less than half the required moves.  M-Audino has this ability not to break combos. M-Lucario will erase your columns, but will spawn patterns that is likely to stop any combo."
PokemonShuffle,3aif59,ZtriS,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:17:54 2015 UTC,What about Gengar or Slowbro?
PokemonShuffle,3aif59,KamuKid,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:52:41 2015 UTC,"They both are great for combos, but they aren't going to help you get rid of the ice columns in Raichu's stage. Audino is perfect for that, it's like he was made for this level.  For M-Ampharos, Gengar would be tricky to use because it would still leave you with a lot of ice. Slowbro could erase them, but it takes too much time to mega-evolve him, and every turn counts. It's still possible to make it with a bit of luck (I'm not even sure I made with Audino only thanks to luck)."

PokemonShuffle,3aif59,KamuKid,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:33:51 2015 UTC,Skarmory: Max Mega Lucario and 3 max ground types made it a breeze for me. M-amph is the same idea
PokemonShuffle,3aif59,SamChallis,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:35:11 2015 UTC,mega ampharos i used a mega lucario mega start (i guess lopunny would work too) to get rid of the ice. it doesnt have much hp so it shouldnt be hard after that.  i think all i needed for mega mawile was a +5 moves. i guess keep trying  mega gengar and mega glalie can be done with just +5 moves and disruption delay (and mega start in glalies case). you could use a complexity -1 to be totally safe if you had the money but i did it without the money on both of them.
PokemonShuffle,3aif59,valedictions,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"I managed to S Rank Mega Mawile with just Moves + 5 by brute force, so something like Disruption Delay to avoid the Ice Blocks should make it fine.  Gengar I recommend your strongest Ghosts (Including Gengar himself as the Mega), and then using Haunter to invalidate Disruptions.  Skarmory's just kind of a dick. Lucario helps to clear disruptions if you're willing to use a Mega Start. Otherwise, is there a SE mon with ""Eject"" to remove the starting Skarm icon?"
PokemonShuffle,3ahl04,Mr_Mienshao,3,Sat Jun 20 06:30:58 2015 UTC,"The ""Go to"" Mega if you're not sure is usually Gengar, since he Megas quickly and his ability is a pseudo Complexity -1 for the duration of a combo, which you can keep going yourself in Timed Stages.  Otherwise, try to pick a SE one, or Mega Aerodactyl works for Heavy Rock/Block levels."
PokemonShuffle,3ahl04,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:50:58 2015 UTC,Thanks!
PokemonShuffle,3ahl04,NobleArrgon,2,Sat Jun 20 08:04:28 2015 UTC,"Assuming youre going to buy mega start for these stages;   For heavy block stages, Mega aero is probably the best.  Some people say mega gengar is really good for ex stages, i disagree. In a scenario that you have the board covered with mega gengars, it takes like a whole second for gengar to remove all gengars, this can happen like up to 10 times in one stage.. that's almost 10 seconds gone waiting for gengar to remove himself.. if you can process the information quick enough like, where all the blocks are going to fall and all the disruptions and stuff, go ahead and use gengar.  My personal go to mega for timed stages is ampharos, glalie, mawile, blastoise/altaria. reason is because they just clear alot better(removes random scrub pokemon AND disruptions), and promotes combos.  Personal preference really. Of course, if youre gonna try and save coins, mega gengar should be your go to, he mega evolves the fastest"
PokemonShuffle,3ahdsv,rhysdog1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:57:19 2015 UTC,"okay, so i should get ampharos, sceptile and zapdos for blastoise. do you think that i'll be able to get the latter two before the event ends? i havn't tried either of them, so i dont know how hard they are."
PokemonShuffle,3ahdsv,Hylian-Highwind,2,Sat Jun 20 05:32:09 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you might have trouble managing this. My best advice is to try and get as many S Ranks to unlock more mons, because the Expert Grass and Electrics are important for Blastoise, and Dialga is just a jerk even with the right mons, but Heatran's power is a big deal if you can get him.  My advice is focus on the Expert Stages and certain Megas until the last couple of days before trying Dialga. Blastoise I'd just wait and try to put in a score on the last day to see. You need to break around 20k it seems to have a comfortable position for the competition, but without Mega Ampharos and some items that might be tricky where you are.  Just try to get some more S Ranks and stages, maybe grind Meowth for some extra money, and see where things stand on the last day."
PokemonShuffle,3ahdsv,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:34:28 2015 UTC,"i currently have up to blaiziken unlocked on expert stages. for blastoise, the only experts i need are sceptile, zapdos and maybe venusaur, correct?"
PokemonShuffle,3ahdsv,MegaMissingno,2,Sat Jun 20 06:56:59 2015 UTC,"Those 3 and Mega Ampharos are your best bet to try and win Blastoise's stone. Zapdos is the most important I'd say, because the other two's abilities aren't helpful (it's their power).  In fact, I'd swap Venusaur for Dedenne instead, since it has the same power, and Mega Boost can help evolve Ampharos faster."
PokemonShuffle,3ahdsv,valedictions,2,Sat Jun 20 08:51:51 2015 UTC,"You probably don't have enough time to get the most optimal pokémon for Blastoise. However, in your situation it should be able to win if you bring your best pokémon and use ALL the items available. Mega Slowbro is probably your best mega for the stage. Just farm for coins in stage 37 Meowth."
PokemonShuffle,3ahdsv,FrozenGlacier,2,Sat Jun 20 08:54:12 2015 UTC,"ampharos is available at stage 130, which isnt too far from where you are right now. getting ampharos would help a ton with the blastoisinite."

You'll have to wait like three days or so for the event to finish and for you to be rewarded the Blastoisite if you make the cut but it beats wasting money/time trying to S Rank Mega Aerdodactyl (I think). To give you a heads up on how much you'll have to score, 26k has put me at around the top 7k in North America."

For Dialga, I recommend basically just taking whatever team ""Optimize"" gives you for your 3 supports, make one of them Ninetales for Block Bash, and then picking the standard Mega Gengar to facilitate combos once the blocks disappear after 5 turns. That said, avoid combos in the opening turns so you can avoid a board reset before the blocks vanish. Dialga also causes Disruptions in response to a combo until turn 10."

PokemonShuffle,3a5eqs,valedictions,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:13:09 2015 UTC,"I think if you're going Mega Start anyway, then better to use a neutral Mega (which is pretty much just Gengar, Ampharos, or Sableye).  Aerodactyl doesn't quite work as well since Dialga does a lot of disruptions, but I don't find them frequent enough to feed into Aerodactyl compared to the results I got with a test run with Sableye (who clears two columns along the top at least) or Gengar just to help combo once the blocks are gone."
PokemonShuffle,3a5eqs,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:21:52 2015 UTC,"thats true, but i would recommend some type of mega that could break blocks just in case you get a bad start with dialga and cant make enough moves to break its disruption case"

PokemonShuffle,3a5eqs,SkylarGreen,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:22:25 2015 UTC,"Aerodactyl + Ninetales  If you don't use a Mega Star  use as few combos as possible to make it through  5 turns without running out and having it reset,  to make all the blocks around you shatter and give you access to the whole stage area.  Use Ninetails combos until you break a hole in the ceiling then switch to Aerodactyl until all the blocks shatter.  Once the stage is wide open go all out on Aerodactyl until he goes mega.   There is some luck involved with this stage and you can get hosed pretty early by his disruptions."

PokemonShuffle,3a5vjo,drumsoverbogota,4,Wed Jun 17 13:55:16 2015 UTC,Thank you so much _^ oh and.. is there a way for me to tell how many S-Ranks I have
PokemonShuffle,3a5vjo,Vinylzen,6,Wed Jun 17 14:04:07 2015 UTC,You might have to cross reference it with the experts you do have unlocked to see where you stand in S ranks. Otherwise yeah the game still hasnt given us a way to know an exact amount without manual counting.   Also worth noting that Expert stage S ranks do NOT count towards the S Ranks you need to unlock more Experts.
PokemonShuffle,3a5vjo,Vinylzen,2,Wed Jun 17 17:32:13 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I've unlocked Yveltal so far so hopefully not long to go!"
PokemonShuffle,3a5vjo,Valkyriess,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:02:55 2015 UTC,Looked it up here and Yvetal requires 110 S ranks and Mewtwo is the next step up at 150 S ranks.
PokemonShuffle,3a5vjo,N0gai,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:31:29 2015 UTC,"Depending on the number of S-ranks you have, it might be easier counting which stages you haven't S-ranked, then subtract that number from 200.   A hint for obtaining S-ranks, USUALLY, you need at least half the moves you started with rounded down remaining, to gain S-rank. Score is irrelevant, you just need to beat the pokemon. One way of thinking about it is you need half your starting moves and need to reach the score X (the pokemon's HP, because once score > HP, its beaten). So from the info above, +5 moves helps you attain S-ranks, but does not affect the +500 bonus score, nor add to catchability.  Also when using the +5 moves, the USUAL number of moves needed remaining will still be half the original number of moves you were given. E.g. Amaura has 15 moves, so you need at least 7 moves left to gain S-rank. If you used +5 moves, you get 20 moves but still only need at least 7 leftover."

PokemonShuffle,3a9b71,SirLucksalot,18,Thu Jun 18 06:40:26 2015 UTC,some people who already have the score are scoring intentionally low to let other people have the stone as well....
PokemonShuffle,3a9b71,Fenor,9,Thu Jun 18 07:56:17 2015 UTC,"There are many potential reasons for this, here are a few.   As someone stated before, some people who already have the Blastoisinite are intentionally trying to get the lowest score, because they would rather donate their placement (Mega Stone) to someone who didn't get one. Some people don't think its worth the effort and might view the event as obsolete for themselves. They might participate later and not bother trying, just to get the free jewel. From your placement, 886, I assume you had to spend 6.5k on the DD, Mega Start, and Attack power+, which others have said is a waste of money since 2 jewels only get you 6k coins. <- This point is debatable, coins are farmable on Meowth stage, Jewels aren't (unless you Streetpass like a hoar). While you may view your score as low, compared to your placement, most people (well at least those who got the Blastoisinite) don't really care about the event, which leaves the less expert players, or those who started later and as such have weaker pokemon (like literally basic/1st stage evolutions) as being the primary competitors for this event. Some people might just be preoccupied with other events. A lot of content was released in the past 2/3 weeks and some people still haven't completed them (S-rank main stages, catch Kalos starter evolutions, catch Dialga, maybe get to level 51 or 101 for Giratina, etc.)"
PokemonShuffle,3a9b71,Valkyriess,3,Thu Jun 18 13:16:27 2015 UTC,i dont know what youre talking about.  with the turn-bases competitions usually scores above 20 000 / 25 000 get you in the safe zone  obviously youre not as bad at the game than you think you are if youve gotten 886 (which im guessing must be somewhere at the very least around 35 000 / 40 000 if its anything like north america)  or youre reading your rank wrong

I only went with Gengar since it's the best mega and really useful for the Giratina level. If we get a Water type excalation battle, I'll most likely use my candies for Mega Ampharos since it's also one of the best megas.  So far we'll just have to wait and see how rare these candies will be. In the end they honestly shouldn't be too rare since they are rendered useless by Mega Start but on the other hand if they are too plentiful, people won't buy Mega Starts making less profit for the developers."

M-Charizard Y would have the ability to increase damage done by same typing - so, each time you clear M-Charizard Y it increases damage done (including itself) by same typing (fire)...

I'm a bit confused on your M-Charizard Y's ability. Does that mean if you keep matching it, will continually stack up fire type Attack Power (to like 3000s in Ampharos stage)? or does it have a flat increase in power? like M-Charizard Y boosts all fire type combos by 20%? Or is it like pyre and sinister power, where the active match only gets the boost? (Honestly, when I tried to train on Ampharos with Zoroark, it only boosted once and never activated for Yvetal). So a flat increase would be awesome for fire types."
PokemonShuffle,3a0hye,NobleArrgon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:10:49 2015 UTC,"Either way? I think I was making Charizard Y mega too powerful.

PokemonShuffle,3a0hye,psyducko,2,Tue Jun 16 11:14:35 2015 UTC,"I love Ampharos, it was my favourite Gen II pokemon, but Ampharos's ability leaves me disappointed. It boosts Dragon types, but what's the point in using it if Dragons resist Electric types. Also the randomness of its Mega Lightning attack leaves combos to RNG. I would have preferred if its ability increased damage of electric types, and its Mega Ability was like the inverse (flipped) version of Glalie (or maybe removed an A shape). Yeah I know Ralts isn't in the game yet, but I'd rather have enough Speedups to max Gardevoir when its released rather than wait even longer, to replace the Speedups I used. When I meant unique, I generalised the ""Erase O/V/diagonals/rows/columns/X spaces within the match"" as removal effects. Slowbro was vastly different, and Aero removed disruptions instead."

But then again, Genesect is more steel... but is BUG type.   But later on, Onix -> Steelix, Steelix is STEEL and not ROCK...

PokemonShuffle,3a0hye,Zekrom-9,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:31:52 2015 UTC,The reason why Bug is the primary type for Scizor and Genesect is because the steel is just an armour whereas the creature itself is a bug. Onix and Steelix are made out of rock/steel making those the more sensible primary typing although I woul've preferred them to be Ground type in order to get a better Ground type pokémon which we need.

PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,Hylian-Highwind,9,Mon Jun 15 19:23:29 2015 UTC,"For the ""opening"" board, take a good look and try to stretch it out to last 5 moves and avoid any combos. Comboing will trigger a disruption from Dialga, and you need to last 5 moves without a reset to get the blocks to vanish.  The other tip I have, swap Groudon for Blaziken if you have him. I just found Blaziken's Damage Streak more useful since it actually can trigger semi-reliably compared to Groudon's Quake, and you need every bit of damage to beat Dialga.  Edit: Just got Dialga, 2 moves left, itemless. Needed 1 Great ball. Party: Lucario (Max), Heatran (Lv 9), Ninetales (Max), Blaziken (Lv 7)."

PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,psyducko,2,Tue Jun 16 00:06:14 2015 UTC,take your time on this one... pun intended :)
PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,MegaMissingno,3,Tue Jun 16 22:19:20 2015 UTC,"I heard that the first few blocks will be removed once you get 5 matches so you should try to go for simple matches of 3 and avoid combos.  Also, M-Aerodactyl with Mega Start can remove the blocks really efficiently. An Attack Power+ is just an added overkill but useful nevertheless."
PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"I'd advise against using Mega Aero even with Mega Start, since Dialga doesn't create disruptions in such quantities as Tyranitar or such do for Aero to feed on. If Mega Starting, any Mega works so long as they can open the top like Lucario or even Amph."
PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,Nefer007,3,Tue Jun 16 23:11:30 2015 UTC,"I swear the entire game is rigged. All the hype of M-Mewtwo Y was utter nonsense: my level 5 Giratina and M-Gengar took care of him once I used the Disruption Delay.  But THIS thing? It is SO RIGGED that it practically requires you to be one of the few who has a dammed Lucarionite on the game, then having a freaking Heatran (which means BEATING UP EVERYTHING) and then it's just plain torture. It would help if it didn't just keep POOPING ON THE ARCEUS-DAMMED BOARD like an incontinent person."

PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,Muggie_W,2,Mon Jun 15 17:20:01 2015 UTC,Don't reset the board.  Use Ninetales and hope to remove an upper block.  Could also match Dialga itself to trigger Block Bash+.
PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,tabularaja,2,Mon Jun 15 17:38:10 2015 UTC,"So uh.. I used M Lucario lv 8, Heatran, Ninetails, Groudon all three level 7.

I used a great ball and got the guy. The chances for this are obviously low, but it is /possible/ to get him without spending a coin."

Atleast I didnt have to buy powerups + greatball, just the ball that you probably wouldve had to buy even if you used the powerups. Point was its possible to beat him without spending anything, then its just a question of whether you want to buy a greatball or keep playing him until you beat him and catch him without one."
PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,Muggie_W,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:01:19 2015 UTC,"I hear ya man, I was just kind of venting that it's basically impossible for you to do anything now without spending some amount of coins"

PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,climb026,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:33:18 2015 UTC,"For items, I'd say to use a Moves +5 or Mega Start with Mega Aerodactyl, but I don't know about other pokemon.... You could try catching Blaziken."
PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,KamuKid,2,Mon Jun 15 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"most of the hard stages in the game are purely luck based if you go itemless. ive had runs with mega lucario, ninnetails, moltres and groudon that have defeated it fairly quickly (still havent caught it though), but ive also had a ton of tries where the entire time ninetails hasnt ever broken one of the top blocks and the stage would keep resetting (id end up doing about a sixth of its health at most)."
PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,giraffe196,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:36:43 2015 UTC,"For those of you who don't want to spend coins and are patient enough, its feasible to beat with this team without coins. I've beat it twice out of 10-15 tries, and its really really luck dependent. If you can last the first 5 moves without having to start again you have a reasonably chance, although it still depends a lot on how bad the disruptions are. Use Ninetales at the start to hopefully free an upper metal block."
PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,MaiKitty,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:28:50 2015 UTC,I wish I had Groudon.. I beat him with M Lugario 8 Ninetailes 8 Heatran 9 and Moltres 5 with one turn left and couldn't catch him :c

PokemonShuffle,39xe9h,tabularaja,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:01:42 2015 UTC,"Ugh... So I beat it once with no moves left because of lucky combos which left it to its 8% base catch rate... Threw the Pokeball, and of course it only gets one tick. Great Ball leads it to 16% and it still gets one tick...

No moves left, got a chance of 8% caught it with super catch power, so I basically spent 2500 on it and got 1000 coins back for finishing the stage. I tried only two times before that, so I guess if you're patient you can do it easily without items. Making no combos in the first 5 moves really helps."

I had to spend coins so far for the special stages - a great ball for Cherrim, 4 great balls that missed on Pinsir (which is the only event Pokémon I have not captured...) (I did the math, all 4 throws combined granted me a 83% to capture it), an item for regirock and items for competitive stages.  I have S-rank pretty much every pokémon up to stage 150 (except the Megas). I caught Mewtwo itemless! : D S-rank'd some extra stages too, though it's not really useful.

PokemonShuffle,39yim3,Hylian-Highwind,3,Mon Jun 15 20:49:22 2015 UTC,Buneary works well for everything. You can alternatively pair up your Dialga and such with a super effective pokémon like Groudon or a good mega such as M-Glalie.
PokemonShuffle,39yim3,MegaMissingno,3,Mon Jun 15 21:00:35 2015 UTC,"what i do if im grinding pokemons resistant to ampharos is bring a super effective pokemon (donphan, groudon, stunfisk) and if they are low level, a combo friendly mega like glalie or gengar. i prefer gengar just cause it makes the stage alot faster.  Strategy is to NEVER match the not so effective monster ever, unless needed to. Just always match your ground type pokemons, then the resulting combo should remove your other pokemons.   Pokemon with mindzap ability, currently only 2 in game, absol and greninja really help too."
PokemonShuffle,39yim3,NobleArrgon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:39:16 2015 UTC,Agreed. Mind Zap makes this stage so easy.
PokemonShuffle,39yim3,Chance_Lo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:07:55 2015 UTC,Absol helps since it resets the first disruption back to 15 turns
PokemonShuffle,39ww05,Hydrathefearful,3,Mon Jun 15 13:40:50 2015 UTC,50xp x Percentage of damage you did
PokemonShuffle,39ww05,Paul648,2,Mon Jun 15 14:14:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure, but somewhere I read that you get the equal percentage of EP as the damage you did. So if you deal 50% damage, you get 50% of the EP you could have won. But, as I said, I don't know if that's true."
PokemonShuffle,39ww05,Yuselwusel,2,Mon Jun 15 14:14:39 2015 UTC,"If you get him to 50% of HP, you'll get 50% of the XP. But no pokemon will get double XP as is the case with winning."
PokemonShuffle,39wt62,Infinitedaw,2,Mon Jun 15 13:14:27 2015 UTC,"Lucario. I tried aero with mega start, but I think I would have been better of just mega starting lucario. He'll clear the starting blocks which is the real problem in case ninetails decides she only wants to clear blocks on the bottom and you keep resetting. He also has the added benefit of being able to clear dialgas that get added, which mega aero can only do through a lucky combo fall. It seems dialga puts 2 sets of himself on opposite sides too, so without lucario, you pretty much have to waste a move at least moving a dialga over to where it can fall into a combo.  That said, in the initial set-up, don't do a combo. If you do a combo (even just 2), dialga triggers a disruption, adding more blocks. Huge pain in the ass.   Edit: although dialga's ability is block bash+ which looks like it gets rid of 3 (if it triggers, seems like it's like giratina and no longer always does), so it's not all bad to move a dialga but still not ideal."
PokemonShuffle,39wt62,Impertinent,2,Mon Jun 15 13:51:31 2015 UTC,"Dialga has block smash +, I used Lucario, Heatran, Groudon, and Ninetails and first I focused on removing blocks with Ninetails then I went for tons of combos involving evolving mega lucario after it was all said and done using DD and plus 5 moves I finished with 21 moves left if I minus the plus 5+ I did this all in 16 moves... I admit I got lucky when it came to the catch rate because I didn't think i'd catch him under 50%"

PokemonShuffle,39vxx2,Kotakia,9,Mon Jun 15 06:09:23 2015 UTC,"What's BS about Dialga is the fact that there's also a bunch of blocks along the bottom, so Ninetales can't even guarantee removing something that'll allow more pieces to fall in.  At least Regirock I was able to make moves! What the hell is this supposed to be?"
PokemonShuffle,39vxx2,Hylian-Highwind,5,Mon Jun 15 06:10:45 2015 UTC,I just found out you're supposed to small swaps without big chains and the blocks will eventually go away! After that it becomes a really easy stage though dialga adds 4 blocks from time to time.   Edit: It adds waaaaaay more blocks than just 4.
PokemonShuffle,39vxx2,SarcasticEmbodyment,3,Mon Jun 15 06:15:27 2015 UTC,Dialga adds a lot more than 4 a lot.

PokemonShuffle,39vxx2,goomyforever,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:57:52 2015 UTC,"Items work, you just need to stack them. Mega Start works well to clear the blocks, and disruption delay can prevent more from coming. Once you have combos, you can even add Power+ for a easier catch."

Funnily enough the first time was just with an ""optimised"" team, which didn't include Ninetales. However I did that one with zero moves left, so that was not ideal.  The second time I did it I had ~7 moves left. That was with a team of Mega Lucario, Heatran, Moltres and Ninetales. It's going to require a lot of luck, I managed to get Ninetales to destroy one of the top blocks, used that to get a lot of Lucario matches and then get a Mega Lucario match to clear off the top. After that it was some lucky combos, and having the lucarios in the right positions to clear Dialga's new blocks it kept adding.  Roughly 7 moves left gave me ~20% chance to catch.

PokemonShuffle,39usp3,Vinylzen,2,Sun Jun 14 23:55:20 2015 UTC,i see. oh well. i don't see this as a game i'd stick around for long anyway. lost interest in pokemon rumble as well. thank you!
PokemonShuffle,39usp3,Vinylzen,4,Mon Jun 15 00:19:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah tbh it's not a very kind game to newcomers.   I do prefer it to Rumble though because Rumble became ridiculous repetitive especially when it just becomes a game that's all about waiting around for things to wobble. And none of the content really changes.  At least with Shuffle, we're getting ""new"" content every week or so, even it's not much.   The draw for Shuffle for me is that I can pick it up and play it for 5 minutes a day. Rumble made me pour more time in each session because again, I was just waiting around for things to wobble. And it's definitely a game with a larger paywall. Shuffle to me has been very playable without spending a single dime of real life money. But then again I've been playing since launch.  It's up to you. I'd personally suggest sticking around, just play a little bit each day, don't worry too much about rare event pokemon. It's a basically a game that doesn't really require too much sacrifice so you don't have much to lose to give this game a bit of more time.  But again, it's understandable for it to be a bit intimidating for new players."
PokemonShuffle,39usp3,goomyforever,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:00:29 2015 UTC,yea i probably will anyway. good time killer. :) and i agree with the rumble part.

PokemonShuffle,39tb9f,MegaMissingno,12,Sun Jun 14 15:55:16 2015 UTC,"my problem with the new stages is that theyre getting harder and harder, but the pokemon theyre offering generally are not getting better. most of the stages this week were on the difficult side, but they were all pokemon around 60 power. the only useful pokemon from this was conkeldurr and tyranitar (who does have an amazing 80 power).   ive only played chesnaught for the expert stages so far, but it was a really fun stage to do itemless. giratina was a really neat stage too, and like all hard stages giratina level 50 was a game of rng if you chose to do it itemless like i did."
PokemonShuffle,39tb9f,valedictions,5,Sun Jun 14 17:11:30 2015 UTC,"Actually this new batch of stages was by far the easiest yet. Nothing in this group came even remotely close to Onix, Milotic, or Steelix levels of difficulty. The new EX stages didn't come even attempt to match Genesect's incredibly stupid degree of difficulty.  I loved the update cause I beat every level on the first try pretty effortlessly (except Tangrowth which I feel dumb about). Even Tyranitar wasn't horribly unfair."
PokemonShuffle,39tb9f,DBrody6,2,Sun Jun 14 19:01:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that the level batch was harder on the whole (in that I at least found I used more hearts to clear them), but it felt easier because you didn't have a couple heart sinks like Onix and Milotic."
PokemonShuffle,39tb9f,Hylian-Highwind,6,Sun Jun 14 21:10:32 2015 UTC,"I really like it, the new event was brilliant in my opinion (Yes, it was hard, but was hard-fun). This is my favorite update so far."
PokemonShuffle,39tb9f,drumsoverbogota,3,Sun Jun 14 16:09:36 2015 UTC,"I blitzed through the new content and defeated Lv.100 Giratina last night. I'm not sure whether I just feel like I'm going through the motions with the new content and should really take more time to enjoy(?) it. The new main stages are getting harder now, though, and so are the expert stages. I hope they don't do similar Escalation Battles in the future although I'm sure they will. Still, a week of grinding should regain maximum coins to play them over the two-week competition period.  As for 'old' content, I'm hoping for a Mew, Keldeo, Kyogre and Blastoisinite re-run. I don't want any new content for a few weeks now, I don't think."
PokemonShuffle,39tb9f,markhawker,2,Sun Jun 14 16:11:32 2015 UTC,"This update had probably the most content released in an update since the release of the game. Of course, a lot of it is recycled content of replaying Giratina stage. However, I still after a whole week haven't been able to go through it all because I'm trying to go for level 100 Giratina and now I've run out of money at stage 86. Luckily I still have the next week to grind money and beat the rest of the stages to get my third mega speedup. The main stages and expert stages are really good since they have given us loads of base 70 and up pokémon. Tyranitar especially was a happy surprise.  For the next week I'm expecting a small update. Regice or maybe a Mew rerelease."
PokemonShuffle,39tb9f,leoxyz,2,Sun Jun 14 16:00:52 2015 UTC,Can you tell me how much you spent during those extra 36 levels of Giratina? I'm gathering as many coins as possible before deciding to start trying 51+ and I'd hate to spend them and not be able to beat level 90 or so.

I don't know, but I have S-Ranked everything except Greninja (haven't tried the stage yet) & posted 9000 coins on Meowth Coin Mania this weekend w/ a 8200 coin net profit (higher net profit than I've seen posted here or at GameFAQs).  So I'm not terrible.    On the Java front, Bitcoin data miner programs primarily run on Java.  Most hackers run Linux or Windows AFAIK, but target all platforms.  They don't really discriminate, since installing their Bitcoin data miners on more computers = more money.  Anti-virus might not catch them, so beware.  :)  If I can get another 60,000 coins w/ at least 2 days remaining, I may consider it, but that's going to be tough.

PokemonShuffle,39tb9f,markhawker,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:51:37 2015 UTC,"OK, less cryptic: yes, I would recommend Shuffle Move unless you're able to do ~800 damage per move on these stages.

I'm on a Mac. :p      If I can get another 60,000 coins w/ at least 2 days remaining, I may consider it, but that's going to be tough.   Yes, it's getting a lot less likely now if you don't have massive amounts of coins. Though, some people have done it with less coins so YMMV. I used Moves +5 as a safety net so I didn't have to pay out on a more expensive DD but I've heard people doing it without Moves +5, too."
PokemonShuffle,39tb9f,leoxyz,0,Mon Jun 15 09:57:18 2015 UTC,"I had like 90k coins when I was at level 50 and I bought Disruption Delay and +5 moves on pretty much every stage. So yeah, even if you don't use +5 moves, you're going to use a lot of coins on this one.  If you don't have at least 90k coins right now, you probably are not going to make it through the 50 levels in just a week, not without using gems for some extra at least. However, if you are using homepass, you might be able to use the hearts from that for efficient Meowth grinding to make it possible."

PokemonShuffle,39tb9f,leoxyz,2,Mon Jun 15 03:31:38 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed giratina and the escalation battle. It could have been better if the difficulty was increased more gradually - I didn't lose until stage 50 and after that it was really hard without spending coins.  But I'd be happy if we got something like that again. Possibly for the other Giratina form?
PokemonShuffle,39tb9f,MetaThPr4h,2,Sun Jun 14 16:47:23 2015 UTC,"I had 99k coins before the update, since we had some extra, easy-paced weeks recently. I enjoyed most of the new stages, but I got mad when I made bad decisions (specially going with M-Start Mewtwo at Conkeldurr, and spending lots of coins at Chesnaught for nothing).  Giratina itself was a lot of fun, but I feel like it should last longer than 2 weeks. Part of the challenge, I get it, but it worries me too much (and I have already too many worries on this life).  Oh, something I gotta thank GS for is the lack of black clouds on the new Expert stages. And the new 80-based Pokémon, they really help. (I'm trusting there will be a Mega Charizard X/Y competition up until July, so Tyranitar is a blessing; I can't wait to be able to max lvl them both)"
PokemonShuffle,39tb9f,psyducko,2,Sun Jun 14 20:25:05 2015 UTC,"Today I finally caught all pokes and Sranked all new stages but Chesnaught (Im planing on farming lots of money and srank rush all EX stages I have left to Srank: Heatran, Xerneas, Yveltal, Mewtwo, Genesect and Chesnaught), got to lvl 50 Giratina, I wont try for the third candy since it will be a waste of money.  My opinion:  New 10 stages pretty fair but Conkeldurr, like Timburr, its just a bullshit luck based stage unless you bring all items.  Ex stages, I hate the low catch but the stages were fine, obv needed coins for srank.  Giratina, liked the idea, but the lvl 100 reward is just waaay to hard to achieve, absolutely not worth the time or coins needed.  8/10 for me"

For Greninja, MVenusaur (I suppose mAmpharos or mKangaskhan are the other options if you dont have mVenusaur)+Frogadier+Optimize, I personally used all items because I went for both catch and srank fast, but for catch only I suppose Megastart and maybe disruption delay is enough.  Also, I always went with 7500 extra money for up to 3 great balls chances of catch, remember that if you miss the catch and he runs away you can fast close your 3DS and you wont lose the great ball coins"

Yamask and Haunter both have Quirky, and Xerneas has Quirky+. This ability upsets the board state when you trigger it. Extra pokemon disappear, tiles fall, incidental matches get made. The key is to make a combo chain of three before all the action stops. Doing so will trigger Meowth's coin disruption, and make you more money.  M-Mewtwo might have the same ability as M-Banette, but there aren't any Psychic types with Quirky. So M-Banette is just a bit better.  Edit: To be clear, this was after buying Mega Start and +5 Moves."
PokemonShuffle,39s7lh,stavross100,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:19:27 2015 UTC,"Sounds great. I did not get that much myself. I do not really trust Quirky (and even less Quirky+) so I focused on matching Banettes, but I made a few bad moves. I will try it again with more quirk next time"

But the second time I tried it, I had terrible luck and got 1900 (a net loss of 900 coins...).  +5 Moves and nothing else is your safest bet if for some reason you have terrible luck. Today I just did the standard M-Gengar + Quirky+/Quirky team with +5 Moves and got 5600 coins."

PokemonShuffle,39s7lh,BasedTanaka,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:26:58 2015 UTC,"It IS pricey yeah. I was just wondering. I mean, it does save a lot of turns too. But Mega Boost sounds like a much better idea I agree."

PokemonShuffle,39rh04,sircaradoc92,12,Sun Jun 14 01:09:56 2015 UTC,"The game doesn't really need guides or Shufflemove, so it's insignificant. And there's probably a lot of people who don't know matrices but do know the Cartesian plane, so that's another way to label ordered pairs."
PokemonShuffle,39rh04,icravedanger,12,Sun Jun 14 04:49:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And the Cartesian coordinate system is much more common than a matrix. So while a matrix is a better description of the pokemon shuffle playing field, a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin in the bottom left  is understood by more people."
PokemonShuffle,39rh04,Norillim,4,Sun Jun 14 05:01:27 2015 UTC,"This is how confusion starts. You dont tell people to learn 2 different things just because one is right and the other is more common. A set of matrix isnt even hard to learn, it only gets hard when you do maths with them."
PokemonShuffle,39rh04,NobleArrgon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:07:20 2015 UTC,"Strange, because even before I learned matrices I would've thought of (0,0) as originating in the top-left corner.

PokemonShuffle,39qwt4,FrenchRocks69,5,Sat Jun 13 21:53:39 2015 UTC,"First tip I can offer for Xerneas to focus on clearing the Ice disruptions first and foremost, even before trying to Mega. You need the space open on the board considering how fast you have to combo to pass this.  For Yveltal, Mega matches and their effects will always clear away the black clouds. So if you don't have Lucario to use, use something neutral you can Mega and match easily along the edges to clear those clouds quickly.  Probably won't mean much, but the Umbreon draw their strength from your own mons, so if you're missing by an EXTREMELY small amount, you might be able to squeeze something out. If nothing else, throwing them into a free grinding slot for a team. On these stages, you do end up having to match them just to keep the combo moving.  Only other tip I have is obviously to use Xerneas against Yveltal and bring enough coins for a Great Ball. Even if you don't want to use it on the resulting rate, you need it to have a chance of Super Capture Power (and triggering that is the only reason i got Mewtwo or Genesect)."
PokemonShuffle,39qwt4,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:07:22 2015 UTC,"I caught both of those Pokemon with the new bonus capture rate thing (it's name is escaping me rn sorry). I think I had like a 1-10% capture rate before it and it snowballed it to like maybe 50-60%? Seriously without those I don't think I would have caught them at all.  For Xerneas I used M-Mawile (7), Nidoking (5), Nidoqueen (5), and Bronzong (4). My Pokemon aren't high leveled at all, I just kept playing the stage over and over until I got the additional bonus capture rate. You can use a Mega start to try and get rid of the ice a lot quicker and hopefully you can finish with some time remaining.  For Yveltal I used M-Lucario (7), Scyther (7), Xerneas (2), and Heracross (6)."

Xerneas: The only SE mega is Mawile, which has an annoyingly low power. Try to mega evolve as soon as possible if you use it, or use a different neutral mega. The other teammates can be Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Steelix, and Bronzong. Bronzong has the worst ability, (even though they wouldn't trigger often), so the other three are your best.  Yveltal: Having Lucarionite makes this a ton easier, as it is the only SE mega against dark types. Again, evolve it quickly, it can do crazy damage and clear clouds. The other pokemon should be Xerneas (one of the two base 80's, Genesect is a huge pain to catch.) some of the base 70 bug types (Scyther, Scizor, Heracross, or Pinsir), and possibly Conkeldur if you have it (it does not give a huge advantage.)  Both times, bring lots of cash for Ultra Balls. Once you reliably can win, wait for Super Catch Power and throw as many as you can."
PokemonShuffle,39qwt4,goomyforever,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:08:23 2015 UTC,"Would like to just add, prioritize Heracross among the Base 70's (assuming you don't get Genesect) because his Crowd Control ability is the only one that procs before the ""10 second pinch"" at the end, and if it triggers, Heracross deals Upwards of 400-500 damage depending on how many there are."
PokemonShuffle,39qwt4,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"I would agree, as well as prioritize Pinsir if you have it. Power of 4 is a decent ability that is more reliable than swarm. (Of course, the event only let people battle it 4 times)"

I just beat him to grab some levels on Giratina and the 3 who seem they'll see the most use in my S Ranks (my Level 8 Aero, Groudon, and Kyogre). EXP Booster does ridiculously well for them.  Also, I'm not sure if it's just from the high number bonus or unique to Victini, but I swear the ""crowned"" mon gains an entire level just for the crown regardless of numbers."
PokemonShuffle,39ohf8,Hylian-Highwind,4,Sat Jun 13 06:42:58 2015 UTC,I've read on here that the crowned Mon get double the exp
PokemonShuffle,39ohf8,ludecknight,2,Sat Jun 13 07:49:47 2015 UTC,"Might just be that doubling that amount has always turned out with a level up, but whether it's an exception or just the ridiculous number, the crowned mon essentially ends up with an extra level."
PokemonShuffle,39ohf8,Hylian-Highwind,2,Sat Jun 13 22:09:35 2015 UTC,"You can go from lv1 to lv4 (or at least 3 with one Ampharos/Buneary for a level) on Victini, or at least my Moltres did."
PokemonShuffle,39ohf8,psyducko,3,Sat Jun 13 07:04:32 2015 UTC,a clue.. a clue!!!   #BluesClues  I'm glad Victini is psychic... we need more STRONG psychic types.   I also got to LVL up (most lvl7 to lvl8) pokes with this event.

PokemonShuffle,39mbze,MayorOfChuville,4,Fri Jun 12 19:26:16 2015 UTC,"Tried this as well, worked really well. Moves +5 would have gotten me the S Rank (wanted to test without any investment first to see how it played).  For just a bit of chip damage, I also threw Lickilicky into my free spots while grinding other mons for Conk and Tyranitar."
PokemonShuffle,39mbze,Hylian-Highwind,2,Fri Jun 12 21:20:38 2015 UTC,Thanks. That worked.
PokemonShuffle,39kfhg,markhawker,5,Fri Jun 12 10:12:33 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind banette is a total different subjet, as it can boots itself (thankfully)  also, those are for plain matches. If you defrost a tile with a match, they doesn't count, only count the tiles that dissapear (tiles that are in both combos, in +, L and T formations count twice)"
PokemonShuffle,39kfhg,Wrulfy,2,Fri Jun 12 10:17:28 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see what you mean with Banette. I wasn't factoring in any kind of ability and was just thinking of the vanilla gameplay. Same with the frozen tile issue. But, yes, good to know!"
PokemonShuffle,39kfhg,Relvamon,2,Fri Jun 12 10:20:25 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned on GameFAQs, really good topic!  I do understand the worst possible scenario in regards to your max combo table, but for Banette, I think it's quite realistic for him to evolve in 6 matches (fully candied), with a 4-3-3-3-3-3 scenario. making it a pretty realistic 2:3 combo reduction. That 4-tile match would also guarantee a extra 3 tile Mega Boost bonus which should propel him to the top candidate. (and that is excluding it doesn't get any Mega Boost bonus from the other 5 x 3 tile bonus)  Something for you to consider, even though you mentioned the table doesn't factor its Mega Boost ability."
PokemonShuffle,39kfhg,Relvamon,2,Fri Jun 12 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"I can add a note on it, of course! Though, the same could apply to the non-candied so wouldn't they cancel each other out?"
PokemonShuffle,39kfhg,leoxyz,3,Fri Jun 12 14:31:50 2015 UTC,"Assuming 3-tile Banette match = 50% chance of Mega Boost.  Pre-candied: 4 (3) + 3 + 3 (3) + 3 + 3 (3) + >2 = 6 turns (Normal combo case)  Post-candied: 4 (3) + 3 + 3 (3) + 3 = 4 turns (~Max combo case)  It pretty much cancels each other out, and both seem pretty realistic scenarios. Only possible edge I see if that you can afford to be a little unlucky with 3-tile Mega Boost activation and still get him up within 4 turns."
PokemonShuffle,39kfhg,CvxFous,2,Fri Jun 12 15:45:43 2015 UTC,"Bummed to see Gengar with that 1:0 stat, haha. Though there are many ways to match them (e.g. if you make two plus-shaped matches, that single candy means a lot).  And ideally I try to move Gengar so that it will result in both its mega-evo and a further match, activating the mega effect. Likewise for Banette, Mewtwo and Aerodactyl (but not as often).  Nice thread anyway!"
PokemonShuffle,39kfhg,The_Watcher_Nos,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:18:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, there are lots of ways of matching. I guess that'd end up a pretty long list! :)"
PokemonShuffle,39k788,heavenorspace,2,Fri Jun 12 08:28:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, it happened to me as well, and more than once (I didn't catch it the first time). I believed it also happened with Pangoro. It's probably a bug they'll fix in future updates."
PokemonShuffle,39k788,Wattouat,2,Fri Jun 12 08:50:35 2015 UTC,"probably bug, finished with like 12 moves left and still got S rank. Doesnt matter though, free S rank :D"

PokemonShuffle,39k788,Swithe,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:58:15 2015 UTC,"Deleting it wouldn't be fair for those who accomplished it legitimately during the glitched period, so the best they can do it patch the fix without altering anyone else's score."

PokemonShuffle,39iwmw,Progressive_Caveman,10,Fri Jun 12 02:30:37 2015 UTC,hopefully not. the safari zone was a waste of hearts tbh. i didnt like how you could encounter pokemon you had already caught.
PokemonShuffle,39iwmw,valedictions,6,Fri Jun 12 03:06:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it would be pretty. Anyways you're right, although the problem wasn't so much that you could find already caught Pokemon, it was that the percentage of capture and encountering some Pokemon (sharpedo) was completely crap. Hopefully if they do it again it'll be fixed to not be a complete mess."
PokemonShuffle,39iwmw,Progressive_Caveman,2,Fri Jun 12 03:42:19 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Even if it was just giving a bias to Pokemon you haven't caught yet. Teams wasn't the issue since everything bar the very weak Spinda was weak to Bug types.  My big issue is that the Safari zone only had two Pokemon that would see any practical use: Cherrim and Sharpedo, and the latter only on the basis of the unreleased Mega."
PokemonShuffle,39iwmw,Hylian-Highwind,2,Fri Jun 12 04:09:39 2015 UTC,"Less of a waste than Giratina. All Giratina did was taunt you, knowing that you HAD to put in at least 50 if you wanted to get to 50. But the random element from Safari was AWFUL."
PokemonShuffle,39iwmw,Gforce99,2,Sat Jun 13 06:37:12 2015 UTC,I kinda hope so bc I never got a chance to see Sharpedo more than once ;(
PokemonShuffle,39iwmw,heavenorspace,2,Fri Jun 12 08:46:24 2015 UTC,"I was thinking, a safari with the Pan/Simi lines would be interesting, with new abilities (Blaze/Overgrow/Torrent) that boost combo power like Sininster Power and Dancing Dragons."

I was under the impression there was typically something like the Daily Pokemon and some competition/extended event (Giratina or a Mega for example), and Shaymin or Celebi type mons were just exceptions for certain game milestones."
PokemonShuffle,39iwmw,Swithe,2,Fri Jun 12 01:45:41 2015 UTC,"well, we already have a daily AND giratina running alongside right now. As they introduce stuff for veterans and bring back old stuff for new players, i think we'll see more simultaneous events at a time."
PokemonShuffle,39iwmw,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:47:32 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that's about what I meant to be the norm: Giratina/Mega/Legendary of some kind, and the Daily Mons. Shaymin is the exception as the 4 million download treat."
PokemonShuffle,39iwmw,Swithe,2,Sat Jun 13 02:45:17 2015 UTC,"yeah, the trouble is the content feels so slow if they cary on as they are, making veterans wait between events.

Or, maybe you can only get the SHINY if you already have the regular? Or, maybe they will add BOSS stages... and he will just be a BOSS that gives you prizes (like mega speed up); but you can't catch?   SUCKS if you can't catch though..."

Judging from the Lucarionite competition, lots of people started after the Kyogre and Mew events were already over.    I would really like Kyogre, just in case Genius Sonority introduces Primal Reversion as a later addition to the game.    I need some time to regroup to attempt Level 100 Giratina for the 2nd Mega SpeedUp.  A new competition/stage would put and end to Giratina for me."
PokemonShuffle,39iwmw,Vinylzen,2,Sat Jun 13 12:51:35 2015 UTC,"i hope we can get repeats of things we missed, but maybe running for shorter amounts of time. i never got a chance to get kyogre or keldeo unfortunately.  i think the next turn based mega stage will obviously be blastoise, which i hope could be soon but it probably wont be for a bit still."
PokemonShuffle,39iwmw,valedictions,5,Fri Jun 12 01:44:17 2015 UTC,I wish they'd just put out a bunch of old stuff all at once (at the same time as some new stuff) for certain periods of time to appease both newer players (who missed some stuff from before) and older players.
PokemonShuffle,39iwmw,Fenor,3,Fri Jun 12 01:55:22 2015 UTC,"tbh i think they should start adding one new and one old side by side every event period. something for the veteran players, and something for the new players at the same time. The ""new"" stages can be tough like the regirock stage so the new players dont just storm through both events.  The next event will probably be Regice/steel (likely ice) to carry on the trend. last time we had a trilogy set, it was a week on/ week off sort of deal."

PokemonShuffle,39hysp,AnAwesomePerson,2,Thu Jun 11 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"its mostly just up to luck. because of how many different types of disruptions giratina uses at stage 50, you just have to hope to have a lucky run where the disruptions are taken out by combos (and that the metal blocks never spawn)"
PokemonShuffle,39hysp,valedictions,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:07:47 2015 UTC,"There must be a reason the metal spawns. Any time I attempt it on my own I get them,  any time I use Shuffle I rarely ever get them. Maybe related to combos?"

PokemonShuffle,39hysp,KamuKid,2,Thu Jun 11 22:18:29 2015 UTC,"gengar level 8, yveltal level 7, giratina level 3 and zoroark level 4. granted, that same team i used against stage 50 giratina would sometimes only do a quarter of its health.  giratina has multiple different disruptions it can do at stage 50. i just got lucky and it never did the metal block disruption in my winning run."

PokemonShuffle,39hysp,TheLightdarker,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:02:26 2015 UTC,Kudos to you! Probably the toughest challenge in Shuffle thus far.  Mind giving some advice/tips on how you got through those higher levels?
PokemonShuffle,39hysp,markhawker,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:15:13 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. I used an optimised teams (Gengar, Yveltal, Giratina and Zoroark) and used Moves +5 and DD until Lv.99. At Lv.100 you need to also invest in Attack Power Up but shouldn't need the Moves +5. I always went to match four Giratina as about 99% of the time you proc the ability. Near the end I was using a combination of my own knowledge and Shuffle Move if I wanted to check for 1,000+ score moves. Which level are you at currently? Remember you'll need lots of hearts and coins, and we're getting close to the end of the competition!"
PokemonShuffle,39hysp,markhawker,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:54:49 2015 UTC,"I stopped at level 56 with a M-Banette (MAX), Yveltal (MAX), Gengar (MAX), and Giratina (8) team.  I don't plan on continuing, since it looks like I'd have to spend a few jewels in order to obtain one more speedup.  But I figured you could give some insight into how others may be able to make it.  Once again, congrats for reaching *the end and getting another speedup.  *(Might as well be considered the end, considering how impossible it gets after that point.)"
PokemonShuffle,39hysp,digikari4691,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:53:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a pain. I did end up using some jewels I'd collected from StreetPass to save on Meowth. But, yes, it's annoying!

PokemonShuffle,39hysp,Wrulfy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:18:32 2015 UTC,Is DD the only thing necessary to beat 50?

PokemonShuffle,39hysp,Amish_Thunder,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:03:56 2015 UTC,Level 49. I'm stopping when I'm done with 50... I'd rather grind Ampharos and not stress out about it.
PokemonShuffle,39hysp,CvxFous,4,Thu Jun 11 22:27:37 2015 UTC,The XP isn't all the great on Giratina anyways.  After ~40 runs my new Giratina went up two levels by the last escalation.
PokemonShuffle,39hysp,Coold2,3,Fri Jun 12 03:15:41 2015 UTC,"nope, special stages don't work the same, giratina gives 5XP everytimes, not 18. so it's even worse than you though"

PokemonShuffle,39hysp,Kusanagi2k5,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:12:50 2015 UTC,I just raised it to Level 40 last night. I was not prepared for its layout.
PokemonShuffle,39hysp,Kusanagi2k5,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:11:23 2015 UTC,"I'm currently at 63. Levels 1 to 49 were itemless. Level 50-55 required Disruption Delays, and 56 required DDs and Moves+5. I've had to stop recently to level grind Giratina, so I didn't have to purchase Attack Power Up, but I know that's coming eventually, as is Complexity-1.     My team the whole way through has been M-Gengar (MAX), Yvetal (MAX), Zoroark (MAX), and Giratina (5), before I caught at level 24, it was substituted for Mightyena (MAX). I've been reading one of the popular Giratina posts recently and people are bringing Shaymin with them.  Does this effectively remove the 5th Pokémon from the stage, or will it get another 5th Pokémon? Anything I can use to make this easier before I run out of coin would be amazing. Considering I haven't put a single dollar into this game, and don't plan to."
PokemonShuffle,39hysp,The_Watcher_Nos,2,Fri Jun 12 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I had been using M-Banette (MAX), Yveltal (MAX), Gengar (MAX), and Giratina (8) when I'd stopped.  I went in with a Shaymin and found that the 5th Pokémon became a Spinda. Absolutely destroyed, even at level 56.  I wish you the best of luck; it looks like all the items will soon be needed even before reaching level 90!"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,DrWeeGee,8,Wed Jun 10 13:39:07 2015 UTC,"Blitzle: Worked fine.  Lickilicky: Had to use +5 and Disruption delay twice. First time finished with 10 remaining, second had 13 (whew!).   Pangoro: Worked as listed. 10 moves remaining. Average combo rate. Slowbro was mega.  Garbodor: Worked. 10 moves remaining. Slowbro mega. Average combo rate.  Cofragigus: Yep. Took a few tries to get Gengar going early enough, but definitely no coins needed.  Doublade: An effing POS as far as I'm concerned. Very difficult to get combos first time through (No Mega start) with +5 and Disruption Delay. Lucario Mega. (Heatran, Ninetales, Groudon). Had 12 moves left with +5 Moves, Mega Start, and Disruption Delay second go-round. Wouldn't risk it, just use all 3 from the start. Klefki is a phallus.   Reuniclus: Took 3 tries, but no need to spend coins.  Conkeldurr: Worked like a charm (to the point that +5 may not be necessary, but I had great combo chains).  Tangrowth: 1st time, diddly squat. Couldn't KO with Glalie, Heatran, Genesect, Scyther (but nothing was summoned either). 2nd try it summoned but nothing happened. Same team. Got a 5 combo with Scyther and ice didn't go away. No KO.  ..out of hearts, so will update in a few hours. The 2nd column to 4th column deal worked. Easily completed after that. See below comment from /u/boltbeam .   Tyranitar: another eff me. 1st one with +5, DD, and MS got me to 10 moves remaining with Mega Mawile, Sceptile, Lucario, and Groudon.   2nd switched Kyogre for Groudon and got 11 moves remaining. Oh the humanity! Will probably give it one more go with above listed, but if you want a sure thing just spring for complexity -1. Sheesh.   3rd try got him. Just barely with 15 moves remaining. If you're feeling lucky then go for it (after all 4300 x 2 is less than 9000 alone for complexity), but if you want a sure thing just bite the bullet on C -1  Chesnaught M-Aero, Genesect, and Heatran. +10 seconds and Mega Start. Had 26 seconds remaining, so just an A rank. I don't really care about S-ranking the timed ones though, so I won't attempt anything else.  Delphox As above, had 9 seconds remaining. ..Stupid 1% catch rate. I won't be using coins again if I can help it.  Greninja Had 5 seconds remaining using M-Ampharos, Mega Start, and +10 (I was stupid and didn't check rankings for Venusaur, finished 20,016). B-ranking.   Thanks for the tips and table! Good luck everyone!"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,shlockin,3,Wed Jun 10 14:52:38 2015 UTC,"Look at my comment history, there's a specific first move for tangrowth"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Boltbeam,7,Wed Jun 10 22:58:54 2015 UTC,"Alright guys, I have started another S-Ranking Guide, please let me know if any of these do not work (after multiple tries) as the game can be a hassle, and can screw your combos over, especially with the later stages"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,NobleArrgon,2,Wed Jun 10 13:41:21 2015 UTC,"For greninja, i just used M-ampharos instead of M-venasaur, cause ampharos just produces more combos. All i bought was mega start and finished the stage with 8 seconds left."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,markhawker,7,Fri Jun 12 15:10:16 2015 UTC,"For Delphox, I used Aerodactyl, Mega Start and +10 Seconds. A lot cheaper but YMMV."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,markhawker,4,Wed Jun 10 14:01:43 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, a lot cheaper. I was just fed up with these stages and just wanted a quick win. I'll try it out later and see, unless someone else can confirm"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,ItsAlkron,6,Wed Jun 10 14:04:30 2015 UTC,"I think I did the same for Chesnaught but I was the same as you, just wanted to complete it fast. The aim is to not delay disruptions as that's what MAero feeds on."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,markhawker,3,Wed Jun 10 14:24:49 2015 UTC,"I can confirm this worked, I cleared it with 20 seconds remaining!"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,valedictions,2,Wed Jun 10 15:46:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I put +5 Moves instead of +10 Seconds so you'll need to update your table."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Hylian-Highwind,3,Wed Jun 10 20:45:08 2015 UTC,Done
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,valedictions,6,Wed Jun 10 21:29:23 2015 UTC,"BTW, lickilicky can be s ranked itemless if you want. i beat it with 12 turns left itemless with mega lucario, sawk, meinshao and pangoro.  pangoro doesn't need any items either, just use optimize and save your money for the ones that actually require it."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Hylian-Highwind,5,Wed Jun 10 20:19:14 2015 UTC,"How important were the abilities in doing that, since Conkeldurr's 70 Base power might make him a bit more helpful in place of one of the supports."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,valedictions,3,Wed Jun 10 20:48:30 2015 UTC,"conkeldurrs ability i think is one of the abilities where it does more damage the less turns there are, which is virtually useless when s ranking. i used pangoro because at least it has hitting streak.  there arent a lot of good fighting types in the game yet unfortunately."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,gu_cu,2,Wed Jun 10 21:39:23 2015 UTC,"Minor thing, but Pangoro's ability is Pummel, which increase Fighting type damage in a combo.  So that might indeed be useful, but I might swap Mienshao or Sawk for Conk just for the extra damage."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,leilalover,2,Wed Jun 10 22:06:01 2015 UTC,"youre right, i was thinking of mienshao when i said pangoros ability was hitting streak - oops!"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,ItsAlkron,5,Wed Jun 10 22:43:02 2015 UTC,in the LickiLicky stage i got an easy S rank by putting LickiLicky and Lickitung in my team :)
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,MetaThPr4h,6,Thu Jun 11 02:49:01 2015 UTC,Confirmed. Did this and used a moves+5 and S ranked on the first try. Other 2 pokemon I used were mega Lucario and Mienshao
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,lupinesence,5,Sat Jun 13 01:26:06 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Lickilicky is the only one I haven't gotten so I'll give this a go! Hopefully it'll work, thanks :) Edit: Second try I just scraped by with 11 moves left! Guess I just had to be persistent! Thanks!"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Yuselwusel,4,Wed Jun 10 13:43:09 2015 UTC,"Wish me luck mates, going for Srank Tyranitar, the last one left of the normal stages!  EDIT: Yes! I did it, thanks a lot for the help :)  Now only the extra stages left, gotta catch them all! ... well, after I get some coins ;-;"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,wibenji,4,Wed Jun 10 19:07:40 2015 UTC,"For Tyranitar, I'd strongly recommend Mega Mawile over Lucario and Kyogre is good for getting rid of extra wooden blocks to help build combos."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Tjgalon,3,Wed Jun 10 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much! As for beating Greninja, I think C-1 is a waste of money here. With M-Venu, Ampharos, Sceptile and Frogadier I usually have 6-9sec. left, so a catchrate of 11-16% which is enough imo, if you have patience! :)"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,butthead,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:21:34 2015 UTC,also did Greninja Itemless. But i had M-Amph.

PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,SarcasticEmbodyment,3,Mon Jul 6 18:10:22 2015 UTC,Did Conkeldurr with M-Aero/Xerneas/Victini and your power-ups. Beat him in 5 moves. Definitely didn't need a +5 moves. Xerneas and Victini were both max level.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,heavenorspace,3,Wed Jun 10 15:00:09 2015 UTC,Is M-Khan really worth it over M-Aero for the rest of Chesnaught's stage? I have been unlucky with catch rates on the new EX stages so any second is precious.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,valedictions,3,Wed Jun 10 17:27:34 2015 UTC,I took M-Aero in and wrecked the stage. Don't go for the DD as that's what you actually want to happen.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Nytemarerulez,3,Wed Jun 10 20:44:05 2015 UTC,Could you maybe add Victini and Genesect to your guide? I've been really struggling with both of them for quite some time.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,NarcoticHobo,2,Wed Jun 10 17:46:13 2015 UTC,I saved up for 2 great balls worth plus all items for genesect. Lol.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Hobocannibal,3,Wed Jun 10 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, Mega Gengar is actually pretty helpful on the Lickilicky stage. I had to use +5 moves tho"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,NarcoticHobo,3,Fri Jun 12 08:34:05 2015 UTC,"if youre decent at expert stages, a good tip for chesnaught is dont bother buying any items. also dont bother with mega kangaskhan either, its not a great choice.   mega aerodactyl wrecks house on the stage, and once you have it going the stage will make its own combos because of it being a 3 pokemon stage limit. i tend to finish with around 10-20 seconds each time. its catch rate isnt super high, but if you dont have anything better to spend the hearts on i dont see a reason to not do it itemless."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Hobocannibal,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:53:33 2015 UTC,I had crap luck with Aero even doing a mega start ending in the same time I gotten without it. Mega Khan only one that seems to allow me to win the stage most every time. Crap catch rate but still win it.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Chance_Lo,5,Sat Jun 13 06:34:42 2015 UTC,"Ice barriers don't just go away on tangrowth, something i'm missing?"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,HelloHerroHewwo,9,Wed Jun 10 13:47:09 2015 UTC,"I uh, s-ranked it first try with no items. Assumed it was just a flashy start to the level since the first thing tangrowth did was create an entire horizontal row of tangrowth through the middle of the screen which collapsed all disruptions present on the level.  I assume you're meant to use a summoned tangrowth to remove the starting disruptions."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Hylian-Highwind,5,Wed Jun 10 14:29:25 2015 UTC,"I don't get any tangrowths summoned when i start... wtf?  EDIT: It showed up this time, but at least twice it did not."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Boltbeam,5,Wed Jun 10 14:50:17 2015 UTC,Such is shuffle.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Hylian-Highwind,2,Wed Jun 10 14:58:55 2015 UTC,They appear after a 3 moves combo I think
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,legomaple,3,Thu Jun 11 07:59:53 2015 UTC,I've done it 4 times....nothing shows up.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,themdreamers,3,Wed Jun 10 20:01:02 2015 UTC,You need a 5 combo to get Tangrowth to trigger the disruption that will clear the blocks. Boltbeam's move gets it consistently at the start to save you moves.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,legomaple,9,Wed Jun 10 20:47:08 2015 UTC,There is a specific first move that will give you a 5 combo.  I think its dragging the 2nd column top icon to the 4th column where it will make a match in both places.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Hylian-Highwind,4,Wed Jun 10 16:07:42 2015 UTC,Seconding this. I managed an S Rank (admittedly by the bare minimum margin) itemless with an Optimize team by opening with this move.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,legomaple,2,Wed Jun 10 17:29:33 2015 UTC,What is a good replacement for Genesect against Reuniclus?
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,ezsce32,3,Wed Jun 10 18:10:24 2015 UTC,Heracross is what I used to S-rank.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,fresh816163,3,Wed Jun 10 20:41:07 2015 UTC,"But he is already in the team though.  But I S-ranked it with ease after asking, so nevermind!"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Inequilibrium,2,Thu Jun 11 04:12:48 2015 UTC,What's the rest of your party? Heracross has the same ability for a slight drop in power. What other mons are you currently using though?
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,N0gai,2,Wed Jun 10 20:49:09 2015 UTC,"M-Gengar, Yveltal, Heracross, and Girantina, but I S-ranked it with that team without items, so it's fine!"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,valedictions,2,Thu Jun 11 04:13:30 2015 UTC,I used mega Banette and chandelure with my most powerful ghost type on Giratina. It seemed to work pretty good. Only had to use a disruption delay on level 50.
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,TheLightdarker,2,Wed Jun 10 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"I have been able to get an itemless A-rank on Conkeldurr using Mega slowbro, Xerneas, Mewtwo, and Victini. Once I got Slowbro to mega evolve, he went about clearing the screen, replacing a large number of the wooden blocks with M-slowbro icons. I had finished with 6 moves remaining, so I think using just +5 moves may be enough using slowbro in the mega slot. Just a suggestion for a less costly S-rank, I will need to test it once I've caught all the new pokemon.  Edit: I've found this strategy to be too inconsistent to use item on. In my itemless tests, I was unable to consistently complete the stage but when I did, I always ended with 6 moves or less. I suppose this relies on good rng which doesn't happen enough of the time to yield favorable results."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,climb026,2,Thu Jun 11 02:55:24 2015 UTC,"For Giratina: M-Banette, Giratina, Spiritomb and Yveltal, with a Mega Start, is slightly cheaper than your strategy. Worked for level 50 for me, haven't tried going further yet. Banette, unlike Gengar, is reasonably good at getting rid of barriers (provided you have other ghosts with you), and I ended up having so many turns left over that the +5 moves I used was just a waste of coins.  Spiritomb requires some luck to activate Spookify, so maybe Gengar is a better choice."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Lord_Guthan,2,Thu Jun 11 04:17:38 2015 UTC,"Imho DD is realy not needed for 194, it's really doable with +5 only."

PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Hylian-Highwind,3,Wed Jun 10 14:13:48 2015 UTC,"You sure Gengar's the optimal choice for Blitzle? Aerodactyl seems like the fastest way to clear the rocks so the other 2 can combo.  Also, minor note, but in clearing the starting board for Lickilicky, make sure you drag Lickilicky instead of Lickitung for its brute force and a bit of extra damage.  And it might have been luck, but I beat Pangoro by just using an Optimized team, no items. Mewtwo/Xerneas/Victini/Slowbro. Important part I'd say is 2 Psychics with Mewtwo."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,wibenji,4,Wed Jun 10 14:03:31 2015 UTC,"Gengar is AMAZING in Blitzle, as the level is a 3-pokemon stage. So he's essentially a Complexity -1. The trick is to get him online ASAP.  As for the Lickilicky stage if you kinda let your eyes relax, you'll see the best spot is to move one of the lower-right hand  Lickilicky's to one of the upper-left hand Lickitongue, it'll clear more than half of them out.  As for Pangoro, I think you got luck. I heard some people can clear it with just +5 moves, but my way is a sure-bet"
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,ItsAlkron,2,Wed Jun 10 14:07:44 2015 UTC,"I just assumed Aero worked since Megas are biased to drop in less after the evolution, so once Aero does his job clearing most of the rocks, having just the two grounds would combo ridiculously fast, but I guess then just having the two from Gengar's effect would do that anyway.  I'll give it a shot with that once I clear Giratina Level 50."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,NeoAnima31,3,Wed Jun 10 14:12:41 2015 UTC,I think the problem is Aerodactyl takes too long to mega evolve. MStart is too expensive and not necessary therefore
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,zero2exe,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:44:35 2015 UTC,"I did one run with each so far, and I came closer to an S Rank on my ""blind"" Aerodactyl run than going back with Gengar.  The problem is that the board for Gengar is mostly rocks, so there's not enough holes for him to open up combos like a typical board."
PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Wattouat,2,Wed Jun 10 16:57:01 2015 UTC,"focus on getting gengar online first, then start doing matches near the rocks to unlock a few, then you should see combos happen automatically. this is the cheapest and most reliable way of beating this level"

PokemonShuffle,39ao7n,Sykikal,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:51:30 2015 UTC,I still can't figure what kind of magic trick are you all pulling on the blitzle stage. Every time I use Gengar and move+5 I barely finish the stage with 3-4 moves left (no bonus) due to thousands of rocks blocking the combos.

PokemonShuffle,39dkq0,aerosmithguy151,8,Thu Jun 11 01:19:27 2015 UTC,"That's not how Eject works. Eject removes a Pokemon on the board that isn't part of your party.   For Giratina 50+, pretty much every mega boss, and some other stages like Doublade, the stage forces upon you a ""Fifth"" support Pokemon that's generally worthless in order to make the stage harder. Giratina's is Shaymin.  An example of Eject being useful is Froakie's stage, where there's several starting Froakie's that can be ejected. They aren't a fifth support Pokemon and thus the skill works. The skill also works on disruptions where tiles get turned into useless Pokemon (provided that said useless Pokemon isn't also a 5th member)."

On the snorlax level, with a maxed out sawk. Giratinas ability only didn't trigger 3 times today, so that's far too few for it to be add rare as vitality drain triggers.

PokemonShuffle,39b96w,SampritB,3,Wed Jun 10 16:14:14 2015 UTC,Yeah but its only 5 exp per stage completion so its not worth it for the exp. I would say stage 50 is worth it for the (currently) rare mega candy. Its also easy up until level 50 so I'd say go for it.

PokemonShuffle,39b96w,lockescythe,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:03:53 2015 UTC,"What is your team? By level 40 I was using M-Banette(5) Gengar(8) Yveltal(8) and Giratina (5). I also felt like Gengar really worked good too, especially since I used my mega candy on it. If I would use it I replaced Banette with Zoroark(8). A strong team is really helpful. I think 40-49 has that specific pattern where the opening move always does a good combo. IIRC you have to make an upside down L, I think it's on the right side. Just look at the board you'll see it. That should really help. For 50 I had to use a DD/+5/MS and finished with 7 moves left."

PokemonShuffle,39b96w,Coraldragon,2,Fri Jun 12 20:22:49 2015 UTC,"Basically, every Mega requires a certain number of ""icons"" of it be removed by matching (not accounting for things like Mega Boost ability). Each candy reduces that number by 1.  For example, Gengar requires 11 icons be removed through matching him to Mega Evolve. Using a candy on him reduces him to 10 icons. Some Pokemon would benefit greatly from this since it requiring a single extra icon can sometimes require another turn/match to actually mega evolve if they get close."
PokemonShuffle,39b96w,NobleArrgon,-4,Fri Jun 12 21:07:39 2015 UTC,"That's pretty good, kinda feel like cheating though."
PokemonShuffle,39b96w,Hobocannibal,4,Wed Jun 10 18:08:20 2015 UTC,I wouldn't really consider upgrades provided in the game cheating. It's like leveling them up for more damage or other things. It's being played as intended.
PokemonShuffle,39b96w,KamuKid,5,Wed Jun 10 18:37:39 2015 UTC,"Friend, you have a very weird definition of cheating. youre literally saying something along the lines of ""using mega evolves in the game feels like cheating"". Cheating is the getting of a reward for ability by dishonest means or finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation  When you grind 50 levels of giratina to get that candy to make the rest of the game juuuuust a little easier, like by a minimal amount, shit isnt cheating. Like the candy doesnt even do much, instead of having to match 10 gengars to mega evolve, feeding it the candy, you just have to match 1 less gengar.  first mistake you made was wasting great balls on giratina on stages under 10. I dunno about other people, but if the great ball chance is under 50% i aint buying it, you bought it at 6%. Also by your definition of cheating, using great balls would be cheating, makes the game easier."
PokemonShuffle,399qfr,AvatarMew,7,Wed Jun 10 07:17:35 2015 UTC,"Over on GameFAQs we've established this is similar to the promotion that was announced for Japan where they got six free jewels for any purchase.

PokemonShuffle,396vcm,Loreinatoredor,3,Tue Jun 9 22:46:32 2015 UTC,":-) now it should be more obvious what the best choices are, depending on which megas you use. Personally, I used my first on gengar. My next 4 will go on lucario, because he's actually quite useful. Audino can sit in the corner and be ignored like he should be."
PokemonShuffle,396vcm,Amish_Thunder,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:56:03 2015 UTC,"I agree about Lucario - I'll probably give it my remaining speedup, but I'm not sure yet. It'll depend on me being able to get to level 100 too x)"

PokemonShuffle,396vcm,Loreinatoredor,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:17:27 2015 UTC,"Disruptions removal aside, are you prioritizing towards making a vertical or horizontal M-L match?"
PokemonShuffle,396vcm,Rez91,2,Fri Jun 12 06:08:03 2015 UTC,Make them horizontal so they clear 3 columns instead of 1.
PokemonShuffle,396vcm,Wrulfy,6,Fri Jun 12 11:08:49 2015 UTC,"Wow Khan can go down to 8? That would boost its viability pretty nicely in this new disruption heavy game.   I think the most probably useful is gonna be M-Aero, and I really want to use M-M2. Although, like Gengar, it doesn't immediately effect disruptions it still gives good moves even if you just match the mega Esp if you go in using all psychics which is steadily getting stronger.   That 87 total tho...I feel like I'm gonna have to pass this game onto my grandchildren :p"
PokemonShuffle,396vcm,giraffe196,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:20:25 2015 UTC,I used mine on mewtwo. I guess I'll use the one from #50 giratina on gengar

PokemonShuffle,396vcm,xveganrox,0,Wed Jul 8 00:10:31 2015 UTC,"It only takes 1 candy, the other megas require several"
PokemonShuffle,396vcm,danpmss,-2,Tue Jun 9 18:58:55 2015 UTC,so.. using it on gengar is pretty much a waste of a speedup.
PokemonShuffle,396vcm,Hylian-Highwind,10,Tue Jun 9 18:18:00 2015 UTC,Used it on Gengar right away. No regrets.
PokemonShuffle,396vcm,NobleArrgon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:23:49 2015 UTC,same here
PokemonShuffle,396vcm,DBrody6,6,Tue Jun 9 18:25:54 2015 UTC,"Looking loosely at the math, Gengar is technically the most efficient use per single Candy, yielding a 9% boost for one.  Next closest is Audino with 25/3 ~= 8%, or the Normal types in general.  And considering how much Gengar is used, it's acceptable. Nothing irks me more than being one icon below Evolving Gengar, since missing out on the ones from that last match might have cut down the Mega's damage/combo"
PokemonShuffle,396vcm,Amish_Thunder,2,Tue Jun 9 19:44:45 2015 UTC,"I hope not, since I used my first on it hahah. Depends on a lot of factors I guess.  Gengar is one of the megas I most use (e.g. this Giratina event, or even when NVE, like the Safari event) and has a great skill/attack power (many players disagree tho).  The 9% might seem little, but it is for a single Mega Speedup. The other megas require a lot of candies to reach that higher %. Since I have no idea when we'll get more of those, I decided 9% was good enough."
PokemonShuffle,396vcm,DBrody6,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:26:36 2015 UTC,Used my giratina one speedup on gengar too LOL
PokemonShuffle,396vcm,Amish_Thunder,2,Tue Jun 9 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"I can't count the number of times where I've fallen one tile short of evolving Gengar. Hell just from Giratina attempts alone, the speedup has already paid itself in utility."
PokemonShuffle,396vcm,N0gai,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:45:30 2015 UTC,"You're always going to be getting just 1 tile short of a Mega-evolution though.  At a decent rate, you're still only able to get Mega-Gengar in 4 turns (3 tiles per turn).  You might get lucky and get two unstaged turns of 5 tiles, but that doesn't seem too likely (depending on the level).  You'd have a better chance of getting a 2nd Gengar cascade combo.  I know he has a better speed-up %, but overshooting the mark doesn't mean anything in the game (yet).  Now if he could be sped up to 9 tiles.  Definitely worth it. Personally, I think you should use them on a monster to get the tile count to a multiple of three."
PokemonShuffle,396nwq,butthead,6,Tue Jun 9 17:16:13 2015 UTC,"I went prepared with a Disruption Delay and Moves+5, finished with 6 moves left.  Team: M-Gengar (max), Yveltal (max), Banette (6), Giratina (4). Worth to mention my Shaymin is lvl 5 (intruder species, but at least it's strong and does regular damage)."
PokemonShuffle,396nwq,leoxyz,3,Tue Jun 9 17:26:12 2015 UTC,Did you focus on making matches with any particular pokemon
PokemonShuffle,396nwq,NobleArrgon,4,Tue Jun 9 17:34:55 2015 UTC,"DD and +5moves helped me enough to finish the stage. At the start doesnt matter if youre using M-banette or M-gengar, try and get  mega evolve ASAP if you wanna try and save on mega start.  In terms of priority,   if any giratinas have possible 4 matches, dont hesitate just match them. that 700+ damage is godsent not sure who your other pokemon are, but match them so that your megas get comboed, do not match megas, waste of a move. (i hope you get what i mean here lol) clear shaymin if you cant do 1 or 2. Cause if you cant do 1 or 2, shaymin probably has your board covered."
PokemonShuffle,396nwq,leoxyz,3,Tue Jun 9 17:49:26 2015 UTC,"exactly ^  Edit: Don't know your team, but my top priority in first couple moves is any Banette match that will also result in Gengar matches - I was able to mega evolve Gengar in a single move this way (not on level 50 tho)"

PokemonShuffle,396uk2,Porkpants81,5,Tue Jun 9 17:59:19 2015 UTC,"Finished up to level 50 (this last one after trying my very, VERY best) without using itens. I'm kinda afraid of going through level 50+ now, so I can't say much.  Just stick around with M-Banette, Gengar, Yveltal and Giratina (if you don't have it yet, go with M-Gengar, Absol, Yveltal and Zoroark).  The first 39 levels are pretty easy with any kind of combination, once M-Banette evolves.   Level 40-49 are more tricky (40 is somehow way more difficult than the other ones), but you always have the very same map, that leads to the very same combinations everytime (just try to repeat your ""success formula"" from the last win again and again, it works just like that.  Level 50 was almost plain impossible without itens, but I did it with the help of Shuffle-Move and doing some reasoning about the irritating pattern.  Level 50 kinda dismotivated me a lot, so I'm not sure if I will grab the extra speed-up at Level 100."
PokemonShuffle,396uk2,danpmss,2,Tue Jun 9 18:39:45 2015 UTC,"i dont think trying for level 100 will be worth the coins. the extra speed-up boost isnt worth it too. most of the time if we really need a mega early on in the game, we just buy mega start anyway."
PokemonShuffle,396uk2,NobleArrgon,4,Wed Jun 10 12:17:24 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think is possible to get to level 100 without cheating, much less more than 100. Level 50 was hard as hell with DD, and to do the stages consistently you'll need at least Mega Start, Disruption Delay and maybe even +5 Moves, and that's not counting if there's and extra pattern after level 50."

PokemonShuffle,396uk2,Hylian-Highwind,2,Wed Jun 10 02:35:06 2015 UTC,"Blitzle seems like you should use Mega Aero and your two best Ground types.  If Aero megas (with a start or otherwise) and eliminates the blocks, you basically have two Pokemon comboing for an absurd amount of time."
PokemonShuffle,396uk2,DrWeeGee,2,Wed Jun 10 02:50:19 2015 UTC,"Mega Gengar and +5 moves are better and cheaper. Gengar acts as a complex-1, even better on a 3 pokemon stage"

PokemonShuffle,396uk2,Eagleby18,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:49:16 2015 UTC,"For S-ranking, mostly.  Though for Conkeldurr, you should use M-Areodactyl in adition to ALL the items at once."
PokemonShuffle,396uk2,P-Delta,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:00:00 2015 UTC,"ive liked using m-gengar, banette, spiritomb, giratina. m-gengar over m-banette because giratina's power of 4+ is way too strong and m-banette can remove that from the field. spiritomb has spookify which procs decently often, especially at 4 and 5 matches, and increases the damage of all ghost type attacks and delays disruptions for the duration of the status ~3 turns"
PokemonShuffle,396uk2,warthundersfw,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:51:57 2015 UTC,How does the Pokemon type buffs actually work? Is it a lasting ability or only the combos occurring after it activates?
PokemonShuffle,396uk2,P-Delta,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"There are different buffs. Pummel for example increases fighting damage for that turn/combo only. Fairy power, pyre,  and the dark one on zoroark are the same as this as well.   Then you have stuff like burn, and spookily which apply a debuff to the enemy and all matching type damage work for its duration (~3 turns). I believe glailie's chill also works the same for ice but only lasts one turn"
PokemonShuffle,396uk2,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:04:58 2015 UTC,"To be clear, I believe Glalie's Chill is a one turn delay on Disruptions."
PokemonShuffle,396uk2,P-Delta,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"i vaguely recall one of the shuffle tips that appears after a level that chill causes increased damage from ice. could be wrong about that though and it was just my imagination. the disruption delay is true though, not disputing that."
PokemonShuffle,396uk2,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:44:11 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to confirm that whatever Chill's effect is, it only lasts for one turn as you noted, which is disappointing since Optimal Ice is surprisingly rare in this game (compared to substitute Base 80's for things like Grass)."

Tried level 51 and nah, I don't see any instant reward from beating it so I'mma pass, but is there anyone who has got to level 100 / whatever the top level is?  and are there any prizes for doing so??    for anyone interested, I used M-Gengar MAX, Yveltal MAX, Giratina lvl5, Zoroark lvl8; M-Banette is an option, but is weaker than Gengar and doesn't open up for nearly as much combo potential, so is generally inferior imho.

Here I thought I could go all the way to 100, with some trial and error and hit a wall at 50. Makes me a little sad, but I know I can beat this last bump to get that candy and just have to make due without the extra one, for now."
PokemonShuffle,397d7z,KurikuShot,6,Tue Jun 9 20:00:34 2015 UTC,"Chesnaught my team was M-Gengar/Genesect/Heatran. Used a DD. Honestly I think M-Aero would have helped a lot more instead. Essentially several columns have over a hundred wood blocks in reserve for dropdowns and the goal is to clear them all out as quickly as possible. I got the board cleared after ~50 seconds, but with M-Aero it should be much faster. Once it's cleared you've basically won.   Delphox was a total bitch. Useless Fennekin, tons of metal blocks, and one of your Pokemon doesn't even appear on the initial layout! I'm fairly confident there's a perfect opening move that lets you get a large combo right from the start, but without being able to screenshot it with the home button I had no time to figure it out. I used DD and M-Start with M-Aero, prayed M-Aero actually spawned on the initial board, and prayed super catch power would trigger.   Greninja really, really sucks. You have to bring Frogadier, there's just no way around it. I tried not using him along with using items and, yeah, damn near unfeasible. When frantically trying to make matches, it's made worse that Frogadier is easy to confuse with Froakie. I didn't use M-Venusaur, though I would argue that he's superior to M-Amphy once you've made a Frogadier match or two to thaw several pieces of ice. I went all out with items. Hated it. Hated the stage. Hated the difficulty of getting a good catch rate. Caught him, ain't looking back.  None of them are Genesect-levels of difficult, but they'll very worthy of being EX stages still."
PokemonShuffle,397d7z,DBrody6,2,Tue Jun 9 23:54:29 2015 UTC,"What do their respective disruptions consist of? I can tell Aero's gonna be necessary to clear the inherent blocks for Chesnaught and Delphox, but what does each turn by turn disruption involve? Clouds, more blocks, ice?"
PokemonShuffle,397d7z,Hylian-Highwind,5,Wed Jun 10 02:52:49 2015 UTC,"Chesnaught is wood blocks for days. Entire columns at a time. He'll never blockify the far left column, and that's important to know because if you're not quick enough in destroying the blocks, that's the ONLY column you'll have to play with. The fight is unwinnable if you become restricted to only that column. It begs for M-Aero instead of M-Glalie.   Delphox will keep throwing out a trio of metal blocks. Fuel for M-Aero really, but on top of all the Fennekin it's still annoying.   Greninja creates a trio of ice blocks (I wanna say it was always in an L pattern but it mighta just been coincidence). RNG for me loved favoring them near the top of the screen, always conveniently on Froakies and Frogadiers.   Nothing has clouds (THANK GOD). Nobody's disruptions escalate or change mid-fight, their method of disruption from the first second to the last will be the same."
PokemonShuffle,397d7z,DBrody6,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:02:13 2015 UTC,"Chesnaught WILL do his 3-block disruption in the left column. If he does it in the middle, then there's no way to make a match in the column until you get your Mega up (unless you brought something with a disruption-removing skill). I've gotten stuck in the middle rows multiple times because he disrupted both of the sides."
PokemonShuffle,397d7z,Seven29,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:59:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips here and below. Regarding the Delphox's opening move, it's taking either A1 or B1 to F4 (where A is top row, 1 is leftmost column). But in a stage with so little time (the falling blocks feel like an eternity) and those damn Fennekins, it can't do much. Powerups and M-Aero are still mandatory."
PokemonShuffle,397d7z,leoxyz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:36:50 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, you heard it from me over in Miiverse!  In terms of the timed stages, you may want to also think about taking Pokemon that are different colours to make them easier to spot. Sometimes that can help quite a lot! However you do it, I think you'll need to spend on items as there aren't enough opportunities to make enough combos on these stages."

PokemonShuffle,398p4i,aceflight17,8,Wed Jun 10 01:41:09 2015 UTC,Yes. Fighting Ampharos repeatedly is a common grinding method.

PokemonShuffle,398p4i,Hylian-Highwind,6,Wed Jun 10 01:49:28 2015 UTC,"EXP is awarded based on the number of moves the Pokemon alots you to beat it, regardless of how many are left.  Ampharos has 50 moves and is relatively reasonable to clear without SE Pokemon (compared to Snorlax), so it gives a good EXP yield on a consistent basis."
PokemonShuffle,398p4i,Swithe,2,Wed Jun 10 01:52:34 2015 UTC,"bext exp stages are:  Snorlax for 55, but the difficulty is much higher than Amph for only 5 more exp, so its not worth it.  Ampharos for 50, but far easier than snorlax. most recomended.  Buneary for 30. Not as much as amph, but its pretty braindead easy and fast. Its also available very early in the game (21 i think, compared to amph at 130)  If youre looking to burn through your hearts and get exp, buneary. If you want the most exp per heart, Ampharos.  Im not counting Victini cause its a once a week thing, but that gives 400 (600 with exp 1.5) IIRC."

PokemonShuffle,396b36,RojoRider,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:42:37 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, the speedups just reduce the number of matches you need to make before the pokemon mega evolves."
PokemonShuffle,395dd0,Bro-brocop,10,Tue Jun 9 11:07:33 2015 UTC,"Mega Boost adds three icons' worth to the mega meter when the ability triggers, regardless of match size.   Banette is the only pokemon currently available that can Mega Boost itself, but it works exactly the same as it does for other pokemon."
PokemonShuffle,395dd0,waluweewee,6,Tue Jun 9 11:54:34 2015 UTC,"It does, and I can't say for sure but if I had to guess I'd say your example is correct. Seems to me every mega boost fills the equivalent of an extra match of 3 icons (regardless of how big the actual match size - this will only affect the chances of Mega Boost being triggered, and the regular filling of the mega bar)"
PokemonShuffle,393q4d,goomyforever,3,Tue Jun 9 01:14:10 2015 UTC,"While a possibility, I think such items would be more common than the Mega Speedups if they did exist, since enhancing abilities has a much larger pool of candidates than Megas even if you narrow it down to the Base 70+ Pokemon and Base 60's with really good abilities."
PokemonShuffle,393q4d,Hylian-Highwind,3,Tue Jun 9 02:17:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will do that, in order to give value to newer Pokemon over old ones. In addition, the +/++ abilities have reduced activation rates compared to the base ability. This doesn't mean they are straight upgrades.   Because they aren't pure upgrades, it makes sense to have Pokemon of both the base ability, and the enhanced ability to choose from for players opting between risky but potentially more effective, or consistent but slightly less effective."
PokemonShuffle,393q4d,DBrody6,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:35:00 2015 UTC,I just hope they don't make the same with power of five +
PokemonShuffle,393q4d,Wrulfy,2,Tue Jun 9 07:51:26 2015 UTC,"I think its more likely to see 'X-attack' item.   If a pokemon has base 70 power then it can take 1 of these to bring it to 80. And if they have a base of 60, then they can take 2 of them to bring it to 80.  This would be an expensive way for people to use their favorite pokemon without losing out or making things more difficult for themselves.  Would also mean weaker pokemon with good abilities could be powered up to be more useful."
PokemonShuffle,3949sd,giraffe196,8,Tue Jun 9 03:49:58 2015 UTC,"41-49 is plain stupid... it starts by locking out 66% of the grid behind bearriers, then starts dropping blocks to replace middle clears while randomly barriering the middle every othe turn.  ADVICE: clear the top rows first. Also, if he randomly barriers at the top, youve failed. literally. its almost impossible to ""unbarrier"" the top row if it happens.  at 50, he starts throwing steel blocks and Shaymin (a 5th mon type) into the mix, but removes the side barrier thing, only to replace it with extra barriers per turn on top of the steel blocks."
PokemonShuffle,3949sd,Swithe,2,Tue Jun 9 05:21:08 2015 UTC,i'm stuck at 50 actually. is using m-banette a better choice there?
PokemonShuffle,3949sd,Fenor,5,Tue Jun 9 07:52:58 2015 UTC,i managed it with the m-gengar setup. you can always just use items if you have to and give up at 50. I think i might after seeing how evern a hacker only JUST managed to beat stage 100 with all items on.
PokemonShuffle,3949sd,Swithe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:10:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, M-Banette; either Mega Start or Complex-1 should help win."
PokemonShuffle,3949sd,psyducko,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:15:29 2015 UTC,"In regards to the randomly placing barriers in the top rows when the stage is in the 40's, is it just me or does it not place disruptions when you make at least two matches with a turn (so have at least a combo of two)? From what I can see the key should be just making combos and you win, and the starting setup of the board makes that very easy. I'm on 48 with no items and just one RNG loss from stage 33, and this strategy just seems to nullify the ice for me."
PokemonShuffle,3949sd,Ciashi,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:12:59 2015 UTC,i was doing the double match swaps and still had barriers randomly placed so the combo thing isnt working for me. I know he places them much more frequently the higher the lv gets.
PokemonShuffle,3949sd,Swithe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:17:29 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, 40 - 49 is much harder. It caused my only loss during these escalation battles so far at 41, am currently at 45.

PokemonShuffle,3949sd,Hobocannibal,6,Tue Jun 9 12:12:29 2015 UTC,"Since I'd guess that casual players are expected to reach 50, we shouldn't expect it to be that hard. For me, it stopped being a cakewalk after 30 since it spams barriers every turn at after taking some damage. The 40s might look kinda easy at the start due to how easy it is to make combos, but the random blocks and massive barriers later on can often screw you over here. I'm guessing it'd start to actually become a challenge the closer you get to 100, and just straight up unfair after that.  EDIT: Need coins to beat 50, and its HP is like, 3x greater at 100. GG."
PokemonShuffle,3949sd,Zertolurian,4,Tue Jun 9 07:29:19 2015 UTC,"Casual Players are also probably expected to throw money at the game if they haven't caught Giratina before Level 50.

PokemonShuffle,3949sd,DBrody6,3,Tue Jun 9 06:02:30 2015 UTC,"It gets harder at 5, 10, 30, 40, 50, 100."
PokemonShuffle,3949sd,Teengirl_fantasy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:36:15 2015 UTC,I'm at 48 and haven't felt challenged yet - I have heard it gets pretty tough from 50 onwards though
PokemonShuffle,3949sd,huskergirlie,0,Tue Jun 9 05:50:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't fail my first level until 38, but that was my fault because I was distracted at work and not really paying attention to the game.  I'd say Level 40 was when I first thought ""Welp, I may have to start using items soon."""
PokemonShuffle,3949sd,nintendobratkat,-2,Tue Jun 9 16:46:03 2015 UTC,I feel like it hasn't asked me to capture it for awhile. I know I haven't caught it and I'm at level 39.
PokemonShuffle,3949sd,nintendobratkat,-2,Tue Jun 9 15:45:52 2015 UTC,Seems that it doesn't show when you catch it on thr Pokémon screen and I didn't notice I caught it lol.
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Stokos,9,Mon Jun 8 17:49:34 2015 UTC,"If this is true, it looks like I'm never playing Blitzle's stage :/   maybe theres one every 50 lvls?   Level 100 would have to be the cap considering Pokemon can't level past 100"
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,MayorOfChuville,5,Mon Jun 8 18:01:18 2015 UTC,"Each level difficulty is referred to as ""stage level"" not ""pokemon level"". So it may not make sense to apply that cap on it."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,butthead,3,Tue Jun 9 04:18:55 2015 UTC,"i hope its not every 50.... or people who pay or people in heavy streetpass areas would have way too much advantage. also by 100 id imagine its very item heavy, lol."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Swithe,7,Mon Jun 8 18:05:20 2015 UTC,"Well, looks like I know the only stage to play for the next two weeks."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,goomyforever,3,Mon Jun 8 18:56:20 2015 UTC,Same here.
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,nintendobratkat,2,Mon Jun 8 19:48:13 2015 UTC,is 100 the cap or does it keep going?
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Swithe,4,Mon Jun 8 20:01:38 2015 UTC,Oh it keeps going. But it's damn near impossible (even with all items!) at that point. 150 is a pipe dream for legit players.
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,DBrody6,2,Mon Jun 8 18:49:34 2015 UTC,oh ffs... so basically it looks like the mega speedups are pay to win locked?
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Swithe,5,Mon Jun 8 22:25:59 2015 UTC,"""even with all the items""  That means no matter what you pay, you still won't win."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Eagleby18,3,Mon Jun 8 23:37:45 2015 UTC,"""near impossible""  so imagine what it would be like without items... it seems that the 100 reward candy is gonna be coin locked by the sounds of it."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Swithe,2,Tue Jun 9 00:33:38 2015 UTC,"At that point you're realistically only going to win every stage, with moderate consistently, by paying 15K coins for every item. And you'd have to do this every single time until 150 (assuming 150 even gives you another speedup). That's 750K coins. That's hundreds of dollars in jewels for ONE speedup.  These things aren't meant to be obtained super easily or quickly; getting to 50 is achievable by all players, and hitting 100 is something legit dedicated players can do (likely with the help of items a number of times). We'll be getting more candies from events in the future, and probably as consolation prizes in competitions. It's likely not gonna be pay to win (I just wanna point out that you could just, you know, pay 2000 coins for a Mega Start and nullify any usefulness the speedups give you...)."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,DBrody6,3,Tue Jun 9 00:43:18 2015 UTC,"well, most just want it for completionist purposes =P"
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Swithe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"Well since there's no confirmation if 150 even gives a speedup, setting your goal at 100 and being satisfied with that should be good enough. I'm a completionist too and I'm stopping at 100. Not like 150 is actually reasonable other than by cheaters."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,DBrody6,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:48:00 2015 UTC,definitely going for 50 (got to 45 without items). gonna try for 100.
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Swithe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:50:43 2015 UTC,Is there any confirmation now? (about the cap) Did any hacker reached 150 in the end?
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,danpmss,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:51:36 2015 UTC,"I can't find any videos or bragging Miiverse posts regarding stage 150. Might just be that, stages 100+ being Giratina's final jump in difficulty, even hackers can't be assed to deal with his bullshit to see if 150 gives another speedup.  I'll reply again if I find anything, but no idea if it'll happen."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,DBrody6,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:14:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks pal, I will be waiting for some updates then xD"
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,danpmss,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:29:40 2015 UTC,"Well, you get a prize each time you beat one of Giratina's difficulties for the first time. The last difficulty is programmed to start on stage 100, so I'm almost sure there are no more speedups after it.  The guy from the Miiverse post stopped at stage 101 iirc, so you probably won't be getting a stage 150 post from him (I had told him to get to stage 100 just to confirm the extra speedup)."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,RitchieJk,2,Tue Jun 9 09:30:15 2015 UTC,to be fair the one in the video of the 100th win sucked hard.
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Fenor,2,Thu Jun 11 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"Damn, my completionist spirit will make me so mad if I dont reach lvl100, but I dont have money left and still have to catch and srank Tyranitar and the three kalos starters"

PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Satokech,3,Tue Jun 9 04:48:44 2015 UTC,Title is a little misleading.  It's a Mega Speedup. Mega Boost is won by finishing Level 30 Giratina.

PokemonShuffle,391zdp,junkynaruto,10,Mon Jun 8 18:56:14 2015 UTC,HomePass.
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,markhawker,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:01:40 2015 UTC,Does HomePass really give that many Hearts?
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Zekrom-9,6,Mon Jun 8 19:23:26 2015 UTC,"One heart per 10 StreetPasses and then a jewel every 100 StreetPasses. If you've been saving up since when they split the hearts then it's easily done. Also, I've seen people with 9,999 StreetPasses so it's evidently possible as that'd be like 99 jewels and hundreds of hearts."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,markhawker,2,Mon Jun 8 19:47:30 2015 UTC,"I have been saving up since they split the Hearts. I got whopping 12 extra Hearts! ... When you use HomePass, do you automatically get 9,999 StreetPass hits, or how many hits do you get from it? I can't really seem to find information about how effective HomePassing is anywhere."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Zekrom-9,2,Mon Jun 8 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"No, of course not! You need to check your 3DS every 10 and clear them out so I imagine it's a bit of a time sync. You've seen /r/StreetPassNetwork?  Also, it's evident there's still a hack about as seen in this Lv.100 video: https://youtu.be/LotqRFPb9TQ?t=2m50s"
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,markhawker,2,Mon Jun 8 20:36:55 2015 UTC,I wonder how they got the hack to work. Probably not something anyone can do
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Zekrom-9,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:53:35 2015 UTC,"It's known but I thought it had been patched. Obviously someone 'in the know', as it were. I mean, just take a look at the videos in their channel."

PokemonShuffle,391zdp,markhawker,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:16:51 2015 UTC,"i see it now. i thought the hacks would have appeared during the gameplay and so i just jumped right to that instead. shame on this guy. i hope his 3ds gets bricked.  given the number of powerups he's using to beat lv100, i think its probably safe to assume that reaching 100 legitimately will cost a boatload more coins than the megaboost is worth."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,P-Delta,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:18:02 2015 UTC,"Homepass is just using streetpass relay at home, using different MAC addresses. So you will eventually get 9999 hits if you change them enough (it's 6 per address)."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,lexarqade,2,Mon Jun 8 21:52:56 2015 UTC,I have two 3DSes and just the streetpasses from a single unit give a good number of hearts as long as you go out and get streetpasses from other players every few days to reset the counter.
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,TSPhoenix,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:49:05 2015 UTC,"I've seen some videos of people attempting stage 100, failing, going to the store and trading jewels for coins and their jewel count didn't change.  Almost nothing but cheaters are at 100 I'm presuming based on that."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,DBrody6,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:43:26 2015 UTC,I thought the cheating was stopped back when they fixed the browser exploit. Must be something you need external equipment to do I guess
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Zekrom-9,4,Mon Jun 8 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"apparently it's the browser exploit but i was sure you needed access to the eshop for the lastest version of the game, probably something like custom firmware+ browser exploit"
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Fenor,2,Mon Jun 8 21:30:21 2015 UTC,"You do. There is no way the browser exploit still works in the update with Giratina. To update the game to the current version, you have to access e-shop. To access e-shop, you have to update the system. I think they manually inserted the Shuffleshop hack, bypassing the need of the browser exploit. But they won't tell how D:"
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Zekrom-9,2,Mon Jun 8 22:31:31 2015 UTC,i think that with a custom firmware you can still access the e-shop.  with a 9.0 to 9.2 you downgrate to 4.5 install a CFW update the CFW to 9.8 and access the eshop....  i think it went that way.
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Fenor,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:25:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, interesting. Too bad I can't do that myself."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Zekrom-9,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:53:45 2015 UTC,when i decided to update my 3ds it was the day 9.3 came out.... it was a bad day...

PokemonShuffle,391zdp,Fenor,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:34:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure I know how Mega Boosts are used. Do they permanently decrease a pokemon's mega evolution lead up time? It only says that they're consumed, suggesting that they're less useful than Mega Starts"
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,SonicFlash01,3,Sat Jun 13 06:57:33 2015 UTC,"They're permanent. They're ""consumed"" in the sense that they're non-transferrable, or re-useable. They can't be used again. In other words, you can't re-use or transfer them to a different pokemon after you've already used them. Once used, they're used. But their effects are indeed permanent. That was redundant enough, but I'm confident I've made the point."
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,butthead,3,Tue Jun 9 03:36:19 2015 UTC,Naw I probably needed it confirmed like that

PokemonShuffle,391zdp,TommoPuppy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:27:22 2015 UTC,is there anything else after 50 between 50 and 100?
PokemonShuffle,391zdp,lockescythe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:04:36 2015 UTC,Still just 51-99.
PokemonShuffle,393ryz,Eagleby18,2,Tue Jun 9 01:29:21 2015 UTC,"How the hell did you get to 99,999 coins in less than a week? Surely not through just the Meowth stage?"
PokemonShuffle,393ryz,TheSandwichy,5,Tue Jun 9 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"If you use every heart to go for 330 coins in Meowth's stage, you'll make ~8000 coins in a day. If you aggressively pursue 530 most of the time, you'll make over 12K per day. Between that, check in bonuses, and weekend Meowth, going from 0->99K is a week of dedication."
PokemonShuffle,393ryz,DBrody6,6,Tue Jun 9 02:30:29 2015 UTC,"Granted, when I first said to myself ""I'm gonna do it"", I was already around 45,000."
PokemonShuffle,393ryz,Shepdawg1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:47:51 2015 UTC,"I'd like that. All my coins generally come from Meowth nowadays, and I've caught and S-ranked just about everything (except for friggin' Conkeldurr). My jewels are just sitting there with no purpose in life."
PokemonShuffle,393ryz,Swithe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:43:55 2015 UTC,"however, they make more money by making stages so stupidly hard all for a single candy, we have to spend coins/hearts to get them. look at giratina for example which costs at LEAST 50 hearts to get ONE candy. granted many of us could get the first candy no trouble at all (im actually at stage 50 now without buying a single item, determined to beat it without caving, lol), the second candy most arent bothering with as its essentially locked behind a coin wall.  if we could convert our free jewels to candy id welcome it, and honestly i think candy could open a new revenue for them, but as far as theyre ocncerned they can make more money by putting the candy behind ""coin walls"" that some people are willing to throw money at.  not saying its the most sensible idea, its just how they seem to think itll work."

PokemonShuffle,393ryz,02pheland,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:31:20 2015 UTC,Ive been sitting on all the free gems you can get since release so about 20 or so now in the hopes they release something new and useful to buy with them but I think if the candy comes out I might buy 1 and then would go back to saving the gems for something better.
PokemonShuffle,393ryz,Thrormurn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:12:19 2015 UTC,"Lets hope they would also give us a method to buy them as a f2p player, even if one would cost 10000 or so coins."

PokemonShuffle,3926z4,ItsAlkron,6,Wed Jun 10 15:53:39 2015 UTC,"I just S-ranked this!  My team was M-Aero, Mewtwo, and Xerneas. Used +5 turns/Mega Start/Complexity -1.   Spam M-Aero matches as much as you can until all the blocks are gone. This has two consequences--one, continually making mega matches rigs the dropdowns to not give you mega icons for a short period of time and, two, removes all of the wood blocks. With these two points combined, all the blocks should all be gone within 8-10 turns, at which point Mewtwo and Xerneas have a giant combofest and wreck Conkeldurr's health.  If you don't wanna spend coins then best of luck to you, it's a brutal S-rank without them."
PokemonShuffle,3926z4,DBrody6,4,Mon Jun 8 21:19:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for the great advice!  If I had the idea of using M-Aero just a bit earlier... could have saved so much coins. With Aero and C-1 it was super easy!
PokemonShuffle,3926z4,Yuselwusel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:48:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you! sadly I will need to grind Meowth (I only have 5800), but when I get the 10800 I will go for it!"
PokemonShuffle,3926z4,Shepdawg1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:59:37 2015 UTC,"The problem with this stage, though, is that it's really easy to get caught in a scenario where you have no moves left, so the stage (and consequently all the blocks) get reset, causing me to lose all hope at an S rank. I too fall into the category of buying all power ups on him and getting screwed by this."
PokemonShuffle,3926z4,DBrody6,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:27:44 2015 UTC,"A single match of M-Aero pretty much elminates this possibility. Like, you'd have to have the most absurdly terrible luck in order to still fail to have a move available."

PokemonShuffle,3926z4,DBrody6,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:41:19 2015 UTC,I found M-Mewtwo to be not effective enough. There's so many wood blocks that there won't be enough of any single Psychic type to get a lot of damage out.

PokemonShuffle,3926z4,Wrulfy,-5,Tue Jun 9 01:11:40 2015 UTC,I A-ranked it on the fist try. Conkeldurr is fairly easier. I did not catch it because I didn't want to waste money. maybe you need more powerful pokemon

PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,NoctusNoctowl,4,Mon Jun 8 07:41:52 2015 UTC,Giratina starts adding itself onto the board around level 20 when it's low on health. If you haven't caught it yet like I hadn't it's pretty annoying.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Maiiau,3,Mon Jun 8 13:35:12 2015 UTC,i already had him in the team never seen him adding himself to the board. i'm at 29 atm

PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Kotakia,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:28:19 2015 UTC,They become ice blocks starting at level 30.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,kirby_j3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:46:46 2015 UTC,I'm on 33 as I type this.  The ice blocks haven't been as annoying as the HP increase.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,NoctusNoctowl,8,Tue Jun 9 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"Hi Relva!  Should probably add this pastebin detailing the stats of all the added Pokemon:  http://pastebin.com/490YtKSc  If it's anything to judge by, Giratina will have 26K HP by the late 40's, almost requiring a double power item at the bare minimum."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,DBrody6,3,Mon Jun 8 06:57:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you, Deathborn.  Will add it now, and reply back on GameFAQs too."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,DBrody6,3,Mon Jun 8 07:03:06 2015 UTC,"No problem. Luckily for you there's been no freebie Attack Power+'s so you probably won't have much trouble getting that bonus mega speedup by the event's end.  Though, knowing you, I'm sure you'll challenge yourself to hit level 50 itemless!  I hope Chesnaught's data is wrong in the pastebin though...26K HP on a 90 seconds timed stage? That's absolute insanity. I think he doesn't have a garbage 5th support Pokemon which kinda eases the difficulty, but still! That's a lot of health!"
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,DBrody6,2,Mon Jun 8 07:07:29 2015 UTC,"There was another thread which showed the overview picture of all the EX stages, by /u/MegaMissingNo  Only Delphox EX seems to have its own disruption cooldown timer, the other two shouldn't summon any disruptions.  As for Giratina, I'll see if I can go itemless on him, though I won't mind using Attack Boost if needed, like Regirock haha."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,DBrody6,2,Mon Jun 8 07:13:53 2015 UTC,"That's a relief, I didn't even think about looking for a disruption timer.  Thinking about it, I used the -1 on the M-Venusaur stage and scored 25K in a minute. Chesnaught isn't that terrible by difference (an extra 30 seconds and everything). Delphox has low HP and it's a short time stage so maybe she won't be terrible. Greninja's starting board is horrible but its health is really low compared to its HP value so hopefully once someone figures out an ideal way to clear the opening board, he'll be simple too."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,DBrody6,2,Mon Jun 8 07:17:31 2015 UTC,"I sincerely don't believe that Chesnaught EX can have that much HP.  Even EX Genesect only had 14,000HP with much more time, even though it had tons of disruptions. Much lesser HP with same amount of time (90 seconds)."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,valedictions,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:22:45 2015 UTC,"Well, as I said I managed to deal 25K damage to M-Venusaur in 60 seconds, and with a -1 he isn't really different from Chesnaught barring whatever disruptions Chesnaught has.  I'd waste a heart trying it out, but I really wanna reach the end of the new stages first. But hopefully it is wrong since 26K HP is still really high and requires superb play to have a decent catch rate."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,NoctusNoctowl,2,Mon Jun 8 07:30:15 2015 UTC,"Indeed, but no worries. I think most players won't bother with the EX stages, even people that missed out on the dailies might even get more love than those new EX stages haha.  I'm pretty glad that it's not as crazy-hell as Genesect, makes me wonder if they patched the difficulty of him after the home button removal."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,legomaple,2,Mon Jun 8 07:37:53 2015 UTC,"I doubt they did (though it would be nice for new players). Genesect is probably the single hardest thing in this game to beat. Maddeningly frustrating. It really felt like a ""screw you"" to everyone trivializing the stages with home button exploits :/"
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,NoctusNoctowl,2,Mon Jun 8 07:42:21 2015 UTC,"Amen to that~  I guess time will tell if they do reduce the difficulty for Genesect. They have been quite generous to the players with freebies and apparent easier main stages, so maybe new players can look forward to easier EX stages xD"
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Fenor,7,Mon Jun 8 08:03:59 2015 UTC,"wait, so level 2 only nets you 2%, level 3 only gets you 3%, and so on?  wow this thing is gonna eat up a ton of hearts before it even gets to a decent catch rate."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,TequilaTitan,6,Mon Jun 8 06:21:28 2015 UTC,"That's how it seems it's gonna be, yeah.  It's grindin' time.  ...at half-hour intervals.  EDIT: Got the sucker at 8%. Now it's time to get them level rewards."

PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,TequilaTitan,2,Mon Jun 8 16:36:44 2015 UTC,Not really.  You will have a ~45% chance of having caught it by the time you beat the 10th level.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,RageTiger,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:04:49 2015 UTC,I'm not lucky. I don't have it after 16 levels and there's a 28% chance of that happening.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Chance_Lo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:32:36 2015 UTC,Also you need to beat lvl 50 to get a mega speed up
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,legomaple,2,Mon Jun 8 07:37:13 2015 UTC,Do they seriously expect me to play this 50 times? Because I will.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Chance_Lo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:35:37 2015 UTC,"Not if you're lucky, i caught him on level 2 with only 2%  I couldn't believe that happened"

PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Pandachan17,3,Mon Jun 8 08:31:22 2015 UTC,You lucky prick.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,KurikuShot,2,Mon Jun 8 06:55:26 2015 UTC,"I know, but for once, I would have been fine with not catching it, since I will have to make the level at least 50 times anyway. Now it loses a little of purpose."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Fenor,6,Mon Jun 8 06:31:58 2015 UTC,he is super effective against himself. use him
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:40:23 2015 UTC,You can still go for the mega boost! Considering it is scarse atm. Adds plenty of purpose if you ask me!
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Hobocannibal,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:42:33 2015 UTC,"I just caught it on 2%. Interestingly, there is no poke ball next to it."

PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,psyducko,2,Mon Jun 8 06:44:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks, so Chesnaught unlocks either after force-triggering 190 S-Ranks, or maybe with 191 S-Ranks. I'll lean towards the latter for now.  Edited."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,valedictions,3,Mon Jun 8 15:13:48 2015 UTC,Thank you.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Brizven,3,Mon Jun 8 07:42:51 2015 UTC,only 195???  at 190 we got genesect  only 5 to go... but i need to catch giratina first
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,valedictions,3,Mon Jun 8 06:23:49 2015 UTC,"Does the stage have to ""properly"" complete for Giratina to level up? Depending on how ridiculous the stage gets later on, I might elect to ""lock"" Giratina at a certain level with the Great Ball exploit until I capture him just to ensure I get him and can use him against himself for the higher ranks."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,valedictions,2,Mon Jun 8 06:26:05 2015 UTC,"Well, the 'trick' relies on not saving the game after the level is complete. Naturally if the game isn't saved you aren't going to get a level up."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,MetaThPr4h,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:07:02 2015 UTC,That's actually a good idea... I'll have to test this out once my hearts replenish. I'm guessing the great ball exploit hasn't been patched? I haven't used it since before they removed the Home button trick as that's when I caught all the Pokémon available at the time.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Swithe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:08:51 2015 UTC,"Seems like most people are catching him under 20%; it's probably better to catch him early on to use him against, well, himself. But, TBH, since it gets easier to catch him as level increases; just keep leveling till you catch... or maybe around level 20-25 if you still haven't caught him, do the trick?"
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,fresh816163,3,Mon Jun 8 07:59:40 2015 UTC,"woah, tyranitar has 80 attack power according to serebii. that's the first main game pokemon with 80 attack power isn't it?"
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Swithe,2,Mon Jun 8 07:09:06 2015 UTC,Dragonite also has 80 base power. I suppose it's limited to legendaries and pseudo-legendaries.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,nintendobratkat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:09:35 2015 UTC,"dragonite was an expert stage pokemon though, along with every other pokemon with 80 base power except victini and giratina. tyranitar so far has been the only one you can encounter in the main game to have 80 attack power. im guessing salamence will be in the next update, and probably also have 80 attack power (hopefully)."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Swithe,5,Mon Jun 8 08:00:41 2015 UTC,"gave the giratina stage 1 a whirl without knowing what to expect  finished in three turns, my catch rate was 1% (the moves left dont seem to add anything at all for this)  surprisingly enough i didn't catch it. it seems super interesting so far!  also got to use mega venusaur to take out blitzle. from the first five stages ive beaten, i can tell s ranking is gonna be hell without items."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Inequilibrium,3,Mon Jun 8 08:12:10 2015 UTC,"I tried to Srank blitzle with MegaAero since the stage is full of blocks, but didn't work, I will focus on Giratina before trying to do the main stages"
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Chance_Lo,4,Mon Jun 8 15:33:57 2015 UTC,"So what did everyone use their first candy on? M-gengar here. he only needs 1 anyway, and hes useful in a lot of situations ^"

PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,psyducko,8,Tue Jun 9 22:57:33 2015 UTC,"s far we know of 2. the free one, and the one for beating lv 50 giratina."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Chance_Lo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:21:25 2015 UTC,What candy?
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,psyducko,3,Mon Jun 8 06:28:46 2015 UTC,the mega speed candy thing. you feed them to megas to make them evo faster.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,MayorOfChuville,3,Mon Jun 8 06:19:19 2015 UTC,"I'm also waiting - when the next competition appears, that's probably going to determine what mega I use it on.  That said, I can see a case for using one now on Gengar, Banette or Mewtwo - not just because the former two will be great for Giratina (who yields a second Mega Speedup to save anyway), but because of the extra coins they can yield for Meowth. (More so for the latter two, as I think the Mega Boost teams beat out M-Gengar + Quirky teams.) Although that only being once a week now, I guess its value has been halfed.  But then, we might want one for Blastoise when we get to Mega Charizard, and there are a couple of other megas that could definitely use a boost as well. So it's too hard to decide right now. The number of empty slots is pretty large relative to the number of candies that seem to be available, so I hope the rate we obtain them isn't too bad."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,psyducko,3,Mon Jun 8 06:23:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think he is my favorite Mega atm. But Banette seems like it would kick asses if it had a faster Mega Evolution, so I am thinking of using it on it too."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Ekint,2,Mon Jun 8 06:25:45 2015 UTC,"I'm holding mine for now. We don't know how rare they'll be, nor what'll be the best strategy."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,psyducko,2,Mon Jun 8 16:28:45 2015 UTC,STAGE 13; 13% catch rate... caught GIRATINA :)  Now I can focus on the new stages;  Is it worth going to stage 50 for GIRATINA? 14 days...
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Ekint,3,Mon Jun 8 16:46:54 2015 UTC,It certainly is for the Mega Speedup.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,onlytruestories,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:31:12 2015 UTC,Who are you using your mega speedup on?
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,fresh816163,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:44:57 2015 UTC,"I used my free one on M-Gengar because it seemed like the most efficient (shaving 1 move off of 11 is a 9% decrease, whereas 1 move off of 14 is a 7% decrease) as well as the fact that I seem to use M-Gengar almost everywhere"
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Zekrom-9,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:05:26 2015 UTC,"Since Gengar is my favorite, I want to give it to him too;  I have a feeling since MEGA SPEEDUP will be hard to come by - seeing how we have to beat GIRATINA 50 times to get another one for the time being."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,TequilaTitan,2,Mon Jun 8 06:33:09 2015 UTC,Probably yes. I think that mega speed ups are gonna be rare things.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,markhawker,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:43:19 2015 UTC,Who are you using your mega speedup on?
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Paul648,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:57:20 2015 UTC,I used the first on gengar because he is awesome. Ill use the next one either on a really strong poke or with aerodactyl because he is a really useful poke for many lvls.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,AvatarMew,2,Mon Jun 8 07:52:11 2015 UTC,So I caught Giratina after six tries and I'm not really sure if it's worth continuing playing this stage just for items.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,markhawker,6,Mon Jun 8 08:04:17 2015 UTC,"well the level 50 reward is mega candy and seeing as it's the only other one in the game aside from the given one, it may be worth going for if you feel it's worth your time"
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,SaveThePatrat,2,Mon Jun 8 06:45:58 2015 UTC,"Caught Giratina at 8%. Probably the luckiest I've been in the entire game, at a stage I actually have to beat 50 times. Wish this could've happened back when I wasted 50 hearts on Quilladin."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,DrWeeGee,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:57:24 2015 UTC,"I caught him on level 2 at 2% I was shocked, but laughed a bit since it'll take some of the fun out of beating him the remaining 48 levels"
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,pagit85,2,Mon Jun 8 17:03:22 2015 UTC,"The pastebin does not show correct information about the Giratina stage at Level 51 difficulty.  Giratina still goes after Level 50 (you will get the Mega Speedup prize) and Level 51 and on to Level 52, but his HP isn't 26,000 as stated in his Level 51 stage, more like above 10,000 HP."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,SaveThePatrat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:02:52 2015 UTC,"Is there an end, then, or does it continue way above 50? https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYQHAAABAACNUKFHg1Hh5g"

PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Shepdawg1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:36:27 2015 UTC,Wow... 66... I wonder how high it goes...
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,4dazan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:11:42 2015 UTC,Looks like you get another Mega Speedup at 100: http://www.serebii.net/shuffle/escalationbattle.shtml
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Houeclipse,2,Mon Jun 8 12:10:04 2015 UTC,"So, I really do not get the point of Escalation Giratina.  Level 5: 1000 coins  Level 10: 1 Disruption Delay (1500 coins -> 2500 coins cumulative)  Level 30: 1 Mega Start (2000 coins -> 4500 coins cumulative)  Level 50: 1 Mega Speedup (???)  So let's break this down. By level 10, we would have had 2500 coins worth of rewards. Comparable to meowth farming (300x10).  But for the next twenty levels, we are only making 100 coins a level (ignore the 30, since you get those with meowth farming too). 20x300=6000 coins, let's be generous here and say 5000 coins, so we keep the same farming ratio as level 10). So we are down 3000 coins.  Unless the mega speedup is worth 3000+5000=8000 coins, it's not worth farming for. It's not even worth farming for the level 30 mega start.  Not to mention that you have a 43% chance to capture Giratina within your first ten hearts (1-0.99x0.98x 0.97x0.96x0.95x0.94x0.93x0.92x0.91x0.9)- at 10% chance catch rate, I'd argue it is better to use a great ball, and if it fails, to just quit, because 1/0.1=10-1/0.2=5 (you save 5 turns on average by using a great ball). 2500 coins for a great ball-2500 of coins and disruption delay= you break even. There is no incentive to play further for giratina, unless mega speedups are so rare (they are at the moment, but I don't think it would be worth 8000 coins) and necessary that you must get them.  (To those wondering why I don't argue for using a great ball at 5%, it is because even though you would save 10 turns, you are also five turns away from a 1500 coin bonus reward, so they're about equivalent, and this requires less thought.   This new event is silly. I hope we don't get any more like this.  Fun fact: There is a 90% chance to catch Giratina if you try to catch it from 1% all the way to 20%. It's ridiculous. There is no reason to play this level so many times. They offer you four rewards spaced out through 50 levels, but a reasonable playthrough only gets two rewards.  For me, none of that is too important. What I really hate is the fact that 28% of the players will not be able to catch Giratina within the first 15 levels. By then, however, Giratina may become too difficult for them to catch without using any coins. I'd rather have a flat 5% catch rate throughout with no escalation battles, because the current system is just scummy."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,clariwench,5,Mon Jun 8 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"Having caught Giratina at 3%, I still plan on seeing how far I can go itemless, strictly to get the Mega Speedup. Yea, the level is a sinkhole for hearts, but the Speedups seem to be ultra rare now, and down the road I would like to have a nice stash of them ready to help me with future levels."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,hopsizzle,5,Mon Jun 8 12:18:05 2015 UTC,Just sounds like a good challenge to me. What else are you gonna do when you've gone up to stage 200? Least you'll earn a reward that's extremely rare for now
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Rez91,2,Mon Jun 8 12:36:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah... being the completionist type, I'm probably going to go for the level 50 reward first, but the reward is honestly useless. I don't remember a situation where I would have S-ranked or completed a level if I had just mega evolved one turn earlier.  The savings from mega evolving earlier could be huge, but I can't think of a situation where I wouldn't choose to just mega evolve (outside of levels where I can't do this) as soon at the start of the level if I couldn't s-rank it. The item's pretty marginal in that sense.  Not that any of this matters. I'm a bit of a collector, so will never use the mega speedups on any of my pokemon."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,icravedanger,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:27:26 2015 UTC,I don't think your math is right about the 99% chance. It's actually a 90% chance. And I'm on level 24 and I still don't have him. There's a 15% chance I won't have him by level 30. I won't comment on how egregious this event is until I get to the 40's.
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,Rez91,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:06:57 2015 UTC,"You're right, my bad. 99 percentile is at around the 28th level. Unfortunately, this event screws people who haven't caught him early on. I decided to do the great ball trick early on, because honestly I have no idea how many levels I'll be able to do."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,leoxyz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:52:44 2015 UTC,"Based on what I've seen of Mega Speedup, for each one used on a Pokemon, it requires one less Pokemon removed to trigger its Mega Evolution. Haven't thoroughly tested this, it's just based on one comparison, so don't quote me on this. That's just what I think it is."
PokemonShuffle,38zy1r,valedictions,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:24:19 2015 UTC,"I really lucked out today, got Giratina at a 3% catch rate.. Didn't even use a great ball"
PokemonShuffle,391fmf,raygius,2,Mon Jun 8 15:35:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, I felt like they were introducing our first kind of ""item"". But honestly I'd like none to be added soon.  Mega speedups are already too scarce; hopefully they won't make us pay tons of $ to get even more advantage in near future."
PokemonShuffle,391fmf,leoxyz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:52:59 2015 UTC,"I was wondering why they were referred to as ""Enhancements"", like it's something there's lots of different kinds of. Maybe they'll add Enhancements to boost the level cap? Or permanently gain more exp.? Or as you said boost Base Power? I hope that if they do, they'll do it to prevent Pokémon from getting outdated. I would hate it when the time comes that Lucario becomes too underpowered."

PokemonShuffle,39122l,Rez91,3,Mon Jun 8 14:35:50 2015 UTC,Im not too sold on Mega Start since its expensive and really anything past a 3 combo doesnt net you any benefit. Ultimately its based on luck besides going to Mega as fast and possible and aiming for 3s as you can never tell if the coins will line up as 500s or a bunch of random 100s. Arguably you might want to try to combo off of 4 coins instead of hoping the coins land in them.
PokemonShuffle,39122l,Zekrom-9,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:22:42 2015 UTC,"No, I'm aiming for meowth's power to trigger. If I'm not wrong, meowth power triggers when you have a multiple clears. I'm trying to chain  this as much as possible like: Pokemon clears combo > meowth turns pokemon into coins > coins clear themselves > more pokemon combo. And so on...  Or did they change this so that you can't get meowth to activate its power more than 1x in one move?"
PokemonShuffle,39122l,Zekrom-9,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:39:41 2015 UTC,"Youre right, Meowth spawns coins everytime you get a 3 match or greater. My feeling is this tho, attempting to get the board to clear itself over and will lower value because the likely matches for coins will get smaller and smaller leading to more 100s and less 500s. Just a theory tho..."
PokemonShuffle,39122l,Zekrom-9,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:50:00 2015 UTC,I guess you're right. I'm willing to compare these theories if I could get enough tests. Or has anyone compare it? I'm kinda out of the loop when it comes to pokeshuffle material thanks to all of these mini games
PokemonShuffle,39122l,Zekrom-9,2,Mon Jun 8 15:58:26 2015 UTC,"I tried using a +5 Mega Banette all-Ghost team once, nailed almost 7000 coins. Then I tried again the week after, only got 2300. And so I tried with a Mega Start this here weekend, and ended up with the same result as you. Seems luck is a HUGE factor in Weekend Meowth's stage."
PokemonShuffle,39122l,Vinylzen,0,Mon Jun 8 14:11:03 2015 UTC,7000 sure is a jackpot. Yeah I tried my best to get Meowth changed as many coins as possible with the combo but it's difficult since it relies solely on luck.
PokemonShuffle,39122l,Vinylzen,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"It might have been because Meowth started a combo with coins, with then lead to another combo disruption, which lead to a line of 6 coins, which gives 700! So yeah, luck :P"
PokemonShuffle,39122l,Vinylzen,0,Mon Jun 8 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"When I'm feeling lucky, I'll probably go overboard with -1 complexity and mega start with +5 moves. Unless someone has tried it and report the result"
PokemonShuffle,39122l,cwhiterun,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"oh glad I looked around before actually doing so. I guess one way or another someone had tried it and know the outcome. Now I think about it, is that C-1 available in meowth stage?"
PokemonShuffle,39122l,digikari4691,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:39:59 2015 UTC,I was thinking about doing that too. But I don't want to risk losing the coins either :/

PokemonShuffle,39122l,goomyforever,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:11:31 2015 UTC,I use 2000 since I'm certain I can land multiple combo with instant mega banette in my team since it clears a lot of pokemon. +5 moves where in each move I should at least get 160 coins to be profitable..sometime I can't achieve that with bad setup.

PokemonShuffle,390mxx,Infinitedaw,3,Mon Jun 8 15:44:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd say its working considering I spent my jewels on hearts just to keep playing the Giratina stage. I can always farm more coins from stage 37 meowth

PokemonShuffle,390mxx,Fenor,2,Mon Jun 8 15:00:52 2015 UTC,I didn't get it either but I got Lucario on his return and Blastoise and one other. I think they will bring them all back around.
PokemonShuffle,390mxx,goomyforever,2,Mon Jun 8 15:13:54 2015 UTC,Blastoise had a return?
PokemonShuffle,390mxx,Zertolurian,2,Mon Jun 8 17:17:26 2015 UTC,No Lucario did. I just expect Blastoise to return and I don't know the name of the other one I got a stone for. I missed out on this one since I had no coins lol. I wasn't exactly playing regularly either so it's my own fault.
PokemonShuffle,390mxx,Swithe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:59:20 2015 UTC,they redid the lucario event recently.  after you catch em all it's simply a metter of use all the items on every completition and you are golden.  as of now i have 40k gold simply by logging after getting all the mons and doing only the weekend stages.
PokemonShuffle,390mxx,N0gai,-1,Mon Jun 8 18:13:36 2015 UTC,Dang. Why not try and max level all your Pokemon? :o

In that case, everyone's going to farm the hell out of this thing.  Edit: I stand corrected; 5 days it is, then!  Greninja, on the other hand, is going to take me days to grind out the luck and money needed in order to unlock it...

I would assume itll get hard at 40+, but im at 30 now and still havent fallen below 10 turns remaining except for one bad run at 28.  edit: forgot to say he starts pulling out barriers at 30, so its definitely only gonna get harder..."
PokemonShuffle,390mxx,Fenor,2,Mon Jun 8 14:52:59 2015 UTC,Recommendation to everyone to maybe stop at Level 29 and use the Great Ball exploit. That equates to a 29%/58% catch rate without Giratina leveling up until you let him (i.e. you've caught him).  Catching Giratina will make it ideal to switch over to Bannete if you have him since clearing other Ghost types might help mitigate the barrier disruptions.
PokemonShuffle,390mxx,N0gai,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:07:29 2015 UTC,I lucked out and caught him on level 10.
PokemonShuffle,390mxx,Fenor,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:54:54 2015 UTC,"switch over to Bannete since clearing other Ghost types might help mitigate the barrier disruptions.   It destroys everything, all 3 ghost types with banette are handily defeating the 40-49 stages with around 3-6 turns left."
PokemonShuffle,390mxx,benjgammack,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:51:27 2015 UTC,"i'm at 29 at the moment, never lost once, never had trouble so far. he start with disruption more often but he actually kind of suck and die quite easily after a couple of nice combo"
PokemonShuffle,391cqw,KamuKid,5,Mon Jun 8 15:15:31 2015 UTC,"That damage isn't bad at all. I just wish they'd give some of the normal types the ""+"" abilities so that they aren't overshadowed by their super-effective potent colleagues."
PokemonShuffle,391cqw,Palletox,5,Mon Jun 8 15:23:29 2015 UTC,Gotta agree. Some of my favourite Pokemon are Normal types but they have no use at all.. even Snorlax with a whopping 70 power only has an ability that lets it fight Pokemon it does less damage to averagely and only if you activate the ability..
PokemonShuffle,391cqw,Herbas_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"Actually heracross can do more than a 1000 damage with enough Pokémon on the field, matches of 4 or 5 doesn't differ from one another in terms of crowd control damage. But considering a full leveled giratina will do 900 damage per match and the ability to do that more often on the stages, I guess it's a better Pokemon. Too bad id takes up a spot of a dark type, less points from gengar + sinister power"
PokemonShuffle,390opk,Zekrom-9,3,Mon Jun 8 11:47:18 2015 UTC,"Well, the power of that skill is insane for how relatively easy is to do a match of 4, it's a nice balance choice"
PokemonShuffle,390opk,MetaThPr4h,2,Mon Jun 8 13:07:51 2015 UTC,It activates fairly often anyway so it isn't even that much of an issue.

PokemonShuffle,390opk,heavenorspace,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:33:28 2015 UTC,He doesn't. I can definitely confirm that now. It's a bout 50% of the time it activates.
PokemonShuffle,390opk,02pheland,2,Mon Jun 8 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"That's a little low, mine goes off way more than 50%."
PokemonShuffle,390oln,treecko4ubers,2,Mon Jun 8 11:46:02 2015 UTC,"Mega Banette. I don't find Mega Gengar that useful, actually. I'd rather use Mega Banette and ordinary Gengar."
PokemonShuffle,390oln,Zekrom-9,4,Mon Jun 8 12:01:22 2015 UTC,Wish I had Mega Banette.
PokemonShuffle,390oln,KamuKid,3,Mon Jun 8 12:03:20 2015 UTC,They should bring him back.  I hope.
PokemonShuffle,390oln,Ali-Sama,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:39:52 2015 UTC,Ordinary Gengar is kinda meh. I only recently realized its ability was power of 5 o_O  I agree the remove other of the same types as very strong and only held back by their incredibly high match requirements(both 23). Banette at 18 might be a reasonable replacement for Gengar.
PokemonShuffle,390oln,Rez91,0,Tue Jun 9 03:54:18 2015 UTC,Same. I've never liked Gengar
PokemonShuffle,390oln,giraffe196,-1,Mon Jun 8 12:35:59 2015 UTC,"I just don't get the hype about it. It got a nice Base Power, but I find it's Mega Ability to be near useless. Heck I often chose Mega Sableye over Mega Gengar because of the crazy combos it makes xD"
PokemonShuffle,390oln,Zekrom-9,9,Mon Jun 8 14:03:22 2015 UTC,I definitely wouldnt say useless since it basically acts like a temporary complexity minus by erasing all Gengars.  Its honestly the reason I was able to catch all the Safari pokes by leaving the playing field with just two pokemon and often giving me triple digit combos.   Gengars also how I beat snorlax in 10 turns! True story. I got it to 100% catch rate as a result.   You have to wait til you have a board full of them. His effect is obviously useless if you use it with like four gengars on the field  On the other hand I dislike Sableye alot for the lengthy charge up time and have had bad luck with its combo ring. Plus it really messes up boards with barrier disruptions from my experience
PokemonShuffle,390oln,Vinylzen,0,Mon Jun 8 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"I meant useless compared to M-Bannete. It too acts as a temporary Complexity-1, and sometimes even as a Complexity-2. But I congratulate you on your 10-turn victory of Snorlax though!  It might just be because I'm super lucky with Mega Sableye then. I find it to be the best Mega when it comes to barrier levels. I tried using M-Gengar 'gainst both Solosis and Duosion, but couldn't even beat them at all. Then I used M-Sableye; instant S-Rank both times."
PokemonShuffle,390oln,Zekrom-9,0,Mon Jun 8 14:31:45 2015 UTC,can't act as comp-2. it will remove up to 10 of the most common ghost type on the board. it will choose only one mon to remove
PokemonShuffle,390oln,Fenor,2,Mon Jun 8 15:04:40 2015 UTC,"He's saying its effectively removing two pokemon from the board, if there is only 3 Mega Bannette and you match those, and then there is less than 10 or less gengar then both are removed. Out of the blocks that fall after you'll get more gengar but Mega Bannette won't appear for awhile"
PokemonShuffle,390oln,Infinitedaw,0,Mon Jun 8 15:19:35 2015 UTC,"Mega icons are rarer than normal icons, and most often when you make a combo with a mega, they don't spawn for the rest of that round. And 10 is a very high number in this game, it isn't often there's more than 10 on the field. I experience the Comp-2 effect quite often."
PokemonShuffle,390oln,Zekrom-9,2,Mon Jun 8 16:17:10 2015 UTC,Mega Gengar has higher power and the ability is incredibly useful to match the other pokemon on stage. Mega Sableye is only good when there are many disruptions.
PokemonShuffle,390oln,Infinitedaw,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:21:36 2015 UTC,He is good for 3 man battles.  He eliminates himself so you get do many good combos.
PokemonShuffle,390oln,Ali-Sama,0,Mon Jun 8 20:38:35 2015 UTC,"Power doesn't matter when it comes to choosing between megas. You can still use the high-power one even if it doesn't Mega Evolve. I find Mega Sableye to be useful even when there are no disruptions, due to the huge amount of combos I get with it."
PokemonShuffle,390oln,Zekrom-9,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:19:55 2015 UTC,I am gonna save it but I really want to use it on Aerodsctyl.
PokemonShuffle,390oln,giraffe196,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:35:19 2015 UTC,if we had another good ghost type banette would be a cool use of it

PokemonShuffle,38zzqv,butthead,6,Mon Jun 8 06:56:42 2015 UTC,"You are correct. Statistically, you have a ~43.5% chance of catching it after the 10th round.

PokemonShuffle,38zzqv,legomaple,3,Mon Jun 8 07:42:13 2015 UTC,"You can get the probability of multiple things happening at the same time by multiplying their probabilities, so the probability of not catching it after 10 tries is 99%x98%...x90%, which gives us ~56.5%. Ergo, the other 43.5% is when that doesn't happen (i.e. when we do not not catch it)."
PokemonShuffle,38zzqv,Zertolurian,2,Mon Jun 8 08:31:21 2015 UTC,Right! That makes sense.

PokemonShuffle,38zzqv,lockescythe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:06:44 2015 UTC,"I think it safe to assume the 1.5x would still be there from a regular match, but the only way to test it would be comparing a ""primary"" Match 4 and a ""secondary"" Match 4; that is, depending on whether Giratina was the dragged Pokemon or not."
PokemonShuffle,38zzqv,dzakadzaka,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:15:22 2015 UTC,"it isnt a 100% chance skill, it can fail.  249 without it activating. 747 when it does. 3x confirmed. (lv 2 giratina)"
PokemonShuffle,38zzqv,TequilaTitan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:47:33 2015 UTC,Base is 80.  Super effective is x2.  Match of 4 is x1.5. So with no ability it should be 240.  That means power of 4+ gives x3 multiplier.  Holy crap!
PokemonShuffle,38zzqv,AvatarMew,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:24:39 2015 UTC,How much does the percentage go up each level?  Is it just 1%?
PokemonShuffle,38zzqv,Sichaye,2,Mon Jun 8 06:48:46 2015 UTC,the % catch rate is equal to the number of times youve beaten the stage (giving 100% with a great ball at level 50). its designed that way so that youre guaranteed to catch it at max lv (with a great ball)
PokemonShuffle,38zzqv,jasmineitor,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:50:22 2015 UTC,"I caught it at 4%, just kind of sat there for a moment not realizing what happened."
PokemonShuffle,38zzqv,Brainirrigation,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:04:11 2015 UTC,"wow, grats. given my usual luck (i failed a catch at 96% before...) i wasnt expecting to catch him until at least 15%."

PokemonShuffle,38zxgf,butthead,4,Mon Jun 8 06:09:21 2015 UTC,Looks like it's the candies used to speed up mega evolution.
PokemonShuffle,38zxgf,thatcodergirl,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:11:23 2015 UTC,I wonder if you can buy them or if they're event only
PokemonShuffle,38zxgf,Shepdawg1,4,Mon Jun 8 06:14:27 2015 UTC,"Haven't been able to find a way to earn them except through beating Level 50 of Giratina's stage, where you only get one."

PokemonShuffle,38zxgf,Swithe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:23:11 2015 UTC,At this point we'll have to wait and see lol
PokemonShuffle,38zxgf,Swithe,2,Mon Jun 8 06:20:01 2015 UTC,"go to the pokemon select menu and itll give a brief tutorial. they are the candies you feed to mega pokemon to speed up their evo. theyre permanenet once used, but this is the first and only candy in existence right now, no telling how rare theyll be later or is theyll be jewel items.  ON A SIDE NOTE: What has everyone been using their first one on? =P I went gengar because of the current event and hes so reliable ^"
PokemonShuffle,38zxgf,ocknon,3,Mon Jun 8 06:16:55 2015 UTC,"M-Banette tears up M-Gengar if you have room for an extra ghost on your team. Really depends on the stage I guess though. Works wonders on Ampharos though. Mewtwo is even better, but with a spare psychic."
PokemonShuffle,38zxgf,legomaple,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:22:04 2015 UTC,"with giratina being a 80 power ghost, i can see M-banette becoming much more useful, especially with gira's ability being far more reliable than gengars."
PokemonShuffle,38zxgf,psyciceman,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:26:21 2015 UTC,"Gengar seems like a great choice, he only needs one candy for full potential and I use him way more than many other megas because he is a mini-complexity-1 which, in my opinion, is the best. (unless you have a board with a shit ton of disruptions, then I'd opt for someone else.)"
PokemonShuffle,38zxgf,legomaple,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:25:40 2015 UTC,"With that reasoning,I wouldnt pick gengar because he only needs 1. There are others with greater or equally great effects that are less effective because of how long it takes to mega evolve them"
PokemonShuffle,38zxgf,Mr_Mienshao,5,Mon Jun 8 06:31:46 2015 UTC,With that reason I wouldn't pick any pokemon until time has passed and we develop an understanding about how rare/difficult these candy are to obtain.
PokemonShuffle,38zxgf,giraffe196,2,Mon Jun 8 06:47:26 2015 UTC,That's what I'm doing (and I feel I'm not alone on this)
PokemonShuffle,38zxgf,Infinitedaw,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:50:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah and with how many top tier pokemon (base 70-80) I have maxed out right now, it's not like there's any rush. I mean unless Girantina Lv.50 turns out to be super hard. Then it'll be worth dropping a candy in order to win a candy."
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,AwesomeYears,9,Mon Jun 8 07:45:29 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, pretty weak team. but giratina is fairly easy the first few stages so your team could beat him  Max level gengar, absol, yvetal, zoroark is my team"
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,NobleArrgon,2,Mon Jun 8 07:50:12 2015 UTC,"SECOND, using the same team... once you get GIRATINA, add him to your team... and probably on later stages switch out M-GENGAR or M-BANNETE; LEVEL 50 gives you another MEGA SPEEDUP!"
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,psyducko,2,Mon Jun 8 08:15:23 2015 UTC,"missed out on M-bannette, was rank like 10200 or someshit, cutoff was 10000. running M-gengar until that event rolls around again"
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,NobleArrgon,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:18:57 2015 UTC,"M-Bannette with a ghost team (Gengar, Giratina) ensures a strong attack; but if you use M-Gengar right, you can maybe do more damage (if used when lots of GENGAR on screen); also, you probably have more control with M-Gengar - where M-Bannette clears random.  I personally will try to use M-Gengar for as long as possible :)   GOOD LUCK!!!"
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:29:50 2015 UTC,"M-banette is not random. it's quite long to explain, but as far as i remember upon activation it does the following.  count for any ghost how many are on the field.  pick the one that have more of his spieces on the field.  remove the first ten scrolling from the upper left to the lower right line from left to right then up to down."
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,Fenor,2,Mon Jun 8 11:50:51 2015 UTC,"That's bull, with over 10 Gengars and 3 Giratinas it removed Giratinas, so it's either totally random or it activates by some really weird rule."
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,Slaynie,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:36:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it just seems to pick a random ghost type and remove 10 of it."
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,Hobocannibal,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:24:35 2015 UTC,"That's cool; I didn't noticed when I did use M-Banette.  Will try him out.  In terms of damage, how much damage does the removal deal?   M-Banette still takes a little longer to activate mega vs. M-Gengar;"
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,psyducko,0,Mon Jun 8 12:02:19 2015 UTC,"as far as i know the removal do no damage, they disappear they aren't paired (like m-gengar). by disappearing falling blocks will help building other comboes, this mean that the combo potential is there, but no raw damage power."
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,Fenor,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:34:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, the removal does do damage, but I don't remember the formula off the top of my head. You might find it in /r/ShuffleMove."
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,TrainerRedstone7,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:39:31 2015 UTC,how do you get the first MEGA SPEEDUP?
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,Fenor,3,Mon Jun 8 11:48:00 2015 UTC,Everyone should have received with check-in/update...  It's located in the POKE selection screen.
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,psyducko,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:58:26 2015 UTC,so if you use the auto team thing you aren't getting it. time to open the poke select screen. (and then rush the last 20 giratinas....)
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,Fenor,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:33:21 2015 UTC,"Well yeah of course you're going to open the poke screen, optimize has always been bad at strategizing since it only picks a super effective mega at random and the highest power super effectives with no thought as to their abilities."
PokemonShuffle,3905kx,Hobocannibal,4,Tue Jun 9 14:19:01 2015 UTC,"Dude, I had 14 moves left, and thought it'd push the percentage up at least a bit, on my first run through, but it stayed at 1%.

This stage is the first in what is called an Escalation Battle. Each time you complete the stage, it levels up and becomes more complicated with added obstacles such as four columns of frozen blocks at Level 40 or instant disruption at Level 10. When you reach Level 5, you get 1,000 coins and when you get to Level 10, you get a Disruption Delay item. The likelihood for capture also increases as the stage's level gets higher"

PokemonShuffle,38vtx5,ghrrrr,2,Mon Jun 8 04:22:31 2015 UTC,i think the free complexity -1 they gave out really influenced how high you needed to get a score of in order to be in the competing. if i didnt use a complexity -1 / disruption delay i would have been out of the running. at least the competitions arent daily so if you grind meowth you should always have enough coins to purchase a few things in order to get a very good rank.

PokemonShuffle,38vtx5,ghrrrr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"+1 to what valedictions said about artificially raised scores, from what i'm reading, the required score would have been around 15k to 17k, which should be achievable using the free complexity -1 and a 1500 coin disruption delay.  I was using the default optimize lvl 6 mega glalie (72), 6 heatran (92), 6 scyther (82), and 5 blaziken (80). Though i hear there was a +combo fire damage pokemon that his ability triggering would buff up the score.  In general, use of all available items will put your score in the required rank."

PS. i had a max level team of m-gengar, absol, zoroark, and yvetal when i attempted this itemless and used shuffle move. barely got him to 1/4 hp."

PokemonShuffle,38uuwk,valedictions,3,Sun Jun 7 04:39:49 2015 UTC,"i might just be lucky, but from my experience the mega mewtwo stage is easier than mega gengar. i used mega gengar, yveltal, heracross, and scizor and it took me a few days at first, and then when i unlocked mewtwo and caught it you had to go back and re-fight mega mewtwo in order to get the mega stone again (some weird glitch that was fixed) and i beat it first try no items.  i'd say its easier on your time to just buy a +5 moves and a disruption delay and then grind stage 37 (meowth) when you need more cash. if you wanna do it itemless all you need is time and a good team."
PokemonShuffle,38uuwk,WillExis,4,Sun Jun 7 06:17:01 2015 UTC,Mega Mewtwo is borderline impossible without items. Also Mega Sableye is more preferred than gengar.

Gengar Megas faster and is a bit more combo friendly, but Sableye's Mega effect has a slightly more consistent benefit, but he takes longer, is weaker than Gengar himself, and Mewtwo's disruptions aren't easy to clear since Sableye always hits along the edges.  Mewtwo is extremely difficult in general. Most important item to beat him is Disruption Delay, and the S Rank you pretty much need Complexity -1 for the Espeon."
PokemonShuffle,38ni5h,MegaMissingno,10,Fri Jun 5 10:39:41 2015 UTC,"Personally I hope that this could be a 20-level pack for the main stages. Since we are getting all three of the Kalos starters, I guess that they unlock like some of the other expert stages with 10 S-ranks each on top of the current requirement for Genesect. But of course, some of the previous starters were only 5 S-ranks apart so who knows?  I'm also hyped for Conkeldurr which will most likely be another base 70 Fighting type which has been needed for a long time. Goodbye Throh, I won't be needing your services anymore. Also, Giratina is a Ghost type so finally Mega Banette gets another powerful Ghost type partner."
PokemonShuffle,38ni5h,Paul648,7,Fri Jun 5 10:42:40 2015 UTC,"My guess: S Ranks: 190 Ex22 , 200 Ex23, 210 Ex24  Seems like the chance of a big main level pack is very high!!"
PokemonShuffle,38ni5h,masadac,5,Fri Jun 5 11:14:32 2015 UTC,I barely hit 180 for Genesect. Oh my god...

PokemonShuffle,38ni5h,Alimagdi,3,Fri Jun 5 15:32:01 2015 UTC,Hopefully the orb that turns giratina into its distortion form is in the last level of the escalation battle.

PokemonShuffle,38ni5h,psyducko,3,Sat Jun 6 05:04:16 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for GIRATINA... because that means more legendaries such as DIALGA and PALKIA will be added soon after?   Regirock is still missing his other brothers though...

PokemonShuffle,38ni5h,heavenorspace,2,Sat Jun 6 06:39:39 2015 UTC,"I think the deciding factor for Greninja's is going to be what his disruption actually is. It doesn't look like there's a way to clear the Frogadiers initially, so I'm inclined to believe his disruption will spawn them, since expecting the player to work with so little of the board is kind of ridiculous.  I hope it's not a Milotic case where you have to bring Frogadier just to clear that Ice and beat Greninja. Then again, Greninja is a frail evolutionary line and design, so if he has relatively little health compared to Milotic I guess it could be worked around.  I just wonder if the Froakies, Frogadiers, both or neither are disruptions or complexities, because 6 Complexity boards are bullshit as Genesect has proven."
PokemonShuffle,38ni5h,ElementUser,2,Sat Jun 6 06:48:37 2015 UTC,Greninja Mind Zap :O
PokemonShuffle,38ni5h,DrWeeGee,9,Fri Jun 5 16:21:20 2015 UTC,Greninja better not be nerfed after he gets released...  Nice ability on him though :)

PokemonShuffle,38ni5h,DBrody6,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:41:24 2015 UTC,"im super excited for the giratina battle. it should be super cool! also delphox will be a cool replacement for combusken.   i hope the three new s rank stages arent all as hard as genesect was because it essentially means that you'll need to use a complexity -1 on all three of them (or some other massive assortment of items). genesect deserved to be really hard because its a legendary, but the fact that the kalos starters all have only 70 attack mean i cant see them being a huge replacement for anything else (and as such i hope their stages arent stupidly hard)"
PokemonShuffle,38ni5h,butthead,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:37:28 2015 UTC,"Looking at the initial configuration for all three stages, they're a LOT more reasonable than Genesect. Greninja is the only potentially brutal one--he has Froakies AND over half the board is frozen Frogadier's at the start. He probably spawns them as disruptions, so once you clear out the initial ice blocks he should go down like normal. Sadly they're configured in a way that renders M-Venusaur useless, if you thought you could be clever."
PokemonShuffle,38ni5h,butthead,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:23:51 2015 UTC,Will Girantina be a set as a Ghost or a Dragon type? I need to know what team to start leveling up now. Dark or Dragon...

PokemonShuffle,38ndex,heavenorspace,10,Fri Jun 5 16:18:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty weak in a lot of stages, the best use of MLucario is in stages with a lot of disruptions so he can clean up them fast"
PokemonShuffle,38ndex,MetaThPr4h,2,Fri Jun 5 10:11:43 2015 UTC,I guess but don't people rather M Aero other M Lucario in the M Aero stage?

PokemonShuffle,38ndex,Infinitedaw,4,Fri Jun 5 11:00:45 2015 UTC,I think the point is to get other Pokemon to start the combo and then end with a MLucario match to get the most damage.
PokemonShuffle,38ndex,valedictions,3,Fri Jun 5 11:33:17 2015 UTC,Probably.. It probably does the most base damage right now
PokemonShuffle,38ndex,Hylian-Highwind,3,Fri Jun 5 11:34:53 2015 UTC,lucario is very good in stages with horizontal disruptions (especially if they're ice). his ability is a bit weaker than pokemon like kangaskhan because at least they can take out middle columns.  mega lucario and mega lopunny i dont think are meant much for combos and are most just for taking out large horizontal disruptions.
PokemonShuffle,38ndex,TommoPuppy,2,Sat Jun 6 02:05:28 2015 UTC,"Mega Lucario is good for clearing disruptions, but his ability doesn't offer much in the way of combo potential. He's mainly good for Ice types, since Aerodactyl can't clear those and they're probably the biggest hinderance to combos since they can outright lock out a column altogether."

PokemonShuffle,38j0ys,MegaMissingno,13,Thu Jun 4 15:23:32 2015 UTC,"My hopes for a long-term future update would be stages with new ""rules"", so as to make us think in new ways. Some suggestions:   Stages where matches must be of at least 4 icons (3-species only to ease the task) Palkia stage where ""gravity"" changes direction after a few turns (like, icons start falling from left to right) Dialga stage where icons turn into their preevolutions after a few turns   update: Would also be great if Pokémon could change types when mega evolved - would be trickier to choose a mega for each stage, and that could also solve our apparent lack of Poison, Ground and Fairy megas. For example, Gardevoir would be bad against a Dark-type, but awesome if used with a Mega Start."
PokemonShuffle,38j0ys,leoxyz,2,Thu Jun 4 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"""gravity"" changes direction after a few turns (like, icons start falling from left to right)   I always imagined a Malamar stage would make icons fall from down to up."
PokemonShuffle,38j0ys,Reddichu9001,4,Fri Jun 5 14:54:03 2015 UTC,I hope the next update finally releases these candies that are listed next to all the Mega Pokemon.
PokemonShuffle,38j0ys,Exodiafinder687,8,Thu Jun 4 19:10:29 2015 UTC,"What I thing will happen is that the 30 stages in Pedra Valley will be done in packs of 10. Right now there are exactly 20 unreleased pokémon in the list. Assuming that one of the stages will be a mega, all 20 will be used by the end of Pedra Valley and that the Kalos starters will be expert stages, we will have the following pokémon:  Update 1:   ??? Doublade (BP 60) Garbodor (BP 60) Cofagrigus (BP 60) Excadrill (BP 60) Braviary (BP 70) Avalugg (BP 60) Lickylicky (BP 60) Tangrowth (BP 60, just like with Mismagius because Genius Sonority would troll us like that) Volcarona (BP 70)   Update 2:   ??? Hippowdon (BP 70) Pangoro (BP 60) Weavile (BP 70) Conkeldurr (BP 70) Salamence (BP 70, please be a Flying type) Reuniclus (BP 60) Aegislash (BP 70) Tyranitar (BP 70) Mega Steelix   Expert stages:   Chesnaught (BP 70, Rock Break) Delphox (BP 70, Prank) Greninja (BP 70, Counterattack)   We would end up with two completely new pokémon which I predict being Nosepass and Probopass. Mega Steelix is mostly there because I couldn't come up with a better mega for Pedra Valley. I didn't feel like predicting abilities for all of the pokémon so I did it only for the starters. I tried to have both base 60 power and base 70 power pokémon equally and I feel like Tangrowth might be a troll and have the same as Tangela. We have a pretty good selection of powerful Grass types like Sceptile, Shaymin and Chesnaught so they probably don't want to oversaturate us. Since the list of unreleased pokémon will come to an end, the area after Pedra Valley will, unfortunately, be filled with more base 30 and 40 pokémon."
PokemonShuffle,38j0ys,pineapplesauce,6,Thu Jun 4 15:24:13 2015 UTC,"All of these are very likely, yes. But I think the Shuffle developers might realize that, for the longevity of the game, they will need to space out the ""payoff"" pokemon like Tyranitar (or any other 3rd stage evolution w/ 70 BP).   Personally, I would take your list there and space it out with a few base 40 pokemon. Maybe one for every five good pokemon. From a developers stand point, doing this would seed in future levels (e.g. start Beldum now for Metagross later) and let them toss players a couple relaxing filler stages. My predictions/hopes for what they'll use: Beldum, Ralts, and Starly. Beldum because Metagross is sweet and they've done most of the other psuedo-legendaries, Ralts because Sylveon is extra useless without a Fairy type Mega (and we really really need a BP 70 there too), and Starly because Flying also really needs a BP 70.  The next Mega will probably be Steelix, but I really want it to be Scizor. I don't even care for Scizor that much, but right now we have four Bug pokemon with BP 70: Scyther, Scizor, Heracross, and Pinsir. The last three have the potential to go Mega, but none of them have a stone. I think Scizor should get it because he is otherwise identical to Scyther, and Heracross is beastly as is. Pinsir's ability isn't too shabby. (All this doesn't even take Genesect into account.)"
PokemonShuffle,38j0ys,pineapplesauce,3,Thu Jun 4 16:38:55 2015 UTC,"My reasoning for this list was that the developers would probably want to get the current unreleased pokémon fully out there. The area after Pedra Valley will most likely be the BP 30/40/50 paradise with all new pokémon. Other than Sneasel and Weavile, we haven't had any new main stage pokémon added to the game since Wacky Workshop, so I have the feeling that the new pokémon will be handled only as these limited batches instead of a continuous chain of new pokémon added to the mix all the time.   I really, really, really hope that Mega Gardevoir will be Fairy type since it's the only one (other than Mega Diancie who looks like it'll be Rock type based on Carbink) that could make Sylveon's ability worthwhile. The same is true for Mega Beedrill for Poison type as well as Mega Camerupt/Garchomp for Ground type and Mega Salamence for Flying type. If these could happen, then all types would have a good amount of megas."
PokemonShuffle,38j0ys,leoxyz,3,Thu Jun 4 16:54:51 2015 UTC,"It's solid reasoning. The stages might look cleaner and more self contained.   But I think they're going to keep everything spread out and connected. The original launch of the game stopped at stage 150, and all the evolution lines up until that point were concluded. The game was technically finished. So then starting from 151 we had this really jarring drop off where they had to start all over. I mean, we just faced Mega Mewtwo and then... Munchlax? Onix? FEEBAS?? I think now that the devs have the game base out there, and they have a working patch system, all their future releases will keep a steady mix of Larvitar-like beginnings and Tyranitar-like payoffs.  Also, I have a hunch that Pedra Valley will only be 20 stages total. They released Wacky Workshop in two 15-stage parts, ending part one with the Milotic mini-boss. I think they're reducing it to two 10-stage parts with the Steelix mini-boss because they can produce and patch in the stages much faster that way.  I don't have a source, but I believe Nintendo said this game was an experiment for them with the Free-to-Play model. The development team is learning as they go, so there will be inconsistencies while they figure out the optimal way to keep Shuffle fresh."
PokemonShuffle,38j0ys,valedictions,2,Thu Jun 4 17:34:49 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  Now that you mention it, it'd be neat if there was a mix of powerful as well as weak pokémon. I wouldn't even mind if Pedra Valley ended up being a 20-stager and saving up Aegislash and friends for later and giving them slowly instead of all at once. At least this way we wouldn't have to go through another Wacky Workshop where we get nothing but weaklings."
PokemonShuffle,38j0ys,Muggie_W,3,Thu Jun 4 18:40:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't count on these, though: Tyranitar, Aegislash, Reuniclus, Salamence, Conkeldurr, Weavile.  Their modus operandi (at least since stage 151) seems to be releasing one stage of the evolutionary line per area. Larvitar, Honedge, Solosis, Bagon, Timburr are all in Wacky Workshop. Pupitar, Duosion, Shelgon, Gurdurr and Sneasel are in Pedra Valley (Doublade will most likely be too, in the next update). That makes it seem like the final evolutions I mentioned will only come for the next area.  I'm betting on Mega Steelix as well, but given the fact Mega Aerodactyl showed up at Wacky Workshop, maybe they don't mean to match the area theme. My other guesses would be Scizor, Heracross, Absol or Pidgeot.  update looks like I was wrong about Conkeldurr :P it'll be stage 198"
PokemonShuffle,38j0ys,Reddichu9001,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:02:42 2015 UTC,im hoping for pidgeot tbh as there isnt a good flying type mega yet. unfortunately unless absol had a great mega ability dark megas are for the most part useless compared to using ghost megas.  mega steelix would be amazing too though because mega mawile is not that great.

Managed to beat it with one second left which gave me a 1% chance, understandably failed. Got that super catch chance, went up to something like 46%. I was happy. I had struggled to catch that one for a while."

PokemonShuffle,38ds1x,RasmusSW,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:46:14 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, move the pokemon whose ability you want to activate.  And if you don't care about abilities, move the LOWER of the two pokemon (because you'll get more chances for chaining if the upper match breaks first, staggering the drops)."
PokemonShuffle,38eoe9,leilalover,8,Wed Jun 3 18:43:09 2015 UTC,I used all items and optimized team and did not need the homebutton trick. Around 40 seconds left...
PokemonShuffle,38eoe9,Yuselwusel,4,Wed Jun 3 18:57:48 2015 UTC,I used all items as well and caught Genesect on something like 60% post patch. Complexity really helps.
PokemonShuffle,38eoe9,Pandachan17,3,Wed Jun 3 19:01:48 2015 UTC,"IMO you really have to use Complexity -1 to catch him, so make the investment count! Get Mega Start & Disruption Delay just to maximize the catch rate."

PokemonShuffle,38eoe9,shewdz,2,Wed Jun 3 22:20:16 2015 UTC,"Aside from the item recommendations, I've been noticing some small thing that might help: Genesect can't form disruptions over an empty space, as in a space where the line has JUST disappeared.  I just noticed from moving the combos around that every once in a while a space glowed and no cloud formed while the rest of the column was covered. Also, anything removed by a Mega loses the disruption, including the actual Mega Match, so I prioritize Aerodactyl matches even without blocks so I can remove clouds.  Edit: I just caught Genesect on an itemless run, though mostly because of Super Capture Power (I finished with 2 seconds left). If I managed that, items should make him a breeze. Disruption delay and C -1 probably make the biggest difference because Genesect just goes nuts with all the disruptions.  Personally, I think the SCP is a fair trade for the Home Button Trick. Considering how nuts the board gets and how much of it is blocked by clouds anyway, I think it better to just buff the chance for capture on the few clears rather than win dozens of 5% chances."

If you play only a few times a day, it's probably not worth it.. if you religiously play and your heart timer is always working for hearts, then grinding to max is easy 1, 2, 3. takes a fkload of time, but worth it.  Edit: im literally only doing this because every bit of damage i can get, will somehow save coins when trying to S rank stages, especially those stages where you gotta S rank in <4-5 moves."
PokemonShuffle,38djq2,NobleArrgon,5,Wed Jun 3 15:16:57 2015 UTC,"Once you're out of stages to complete and are at max coins, there isn't anything else to do in this game. So it's only done to marginally improve our offensive power to get that extra few hundred points for competitions."
PokemonShuffle,38djq2,MegaMissingno,2,Wed Jun 3 16:31:14 2015 UTC,"Only if you have absolutely nothing better to do. It takes too long, and having 4 extra levels on every Mon is like getting a bonus match out of every 10 matches."
PokemonShuffle,38djq2,icravedanger,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:46:26 2015 UTC,Practically speaking I think coins are more useful as I dont think the last couple of levels gives an incredible advantage in any given stage - competitions may be the exception.

The worst of losing on ampharos is not crowning , and probably just a bit less than 50 exp."
PokemonShuffle,38djq2,Wrulfy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:56:07 2015 UTC,"It's a decent thing to do in down time, such as when you've caught everything and are waiting on a new update. It's just that the time/Level up ratio slows down tremendously after Level 5 for minimal returns. Sometimes it might be more efficient to grind up the disruption mons (like Onix for Steelix) since they account for your version of the mon if you own it.  It's basically something you do only if you have time to fill and play the game extensively. I'm doing it to help with the touchier S Ranks like Steelix or Snorlax."
PokemonShuffle,38djq2,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:23:05 2015 UTC,"If you're struggling with some levels but find normal Meowth frustrating, it's worth it; it gives you something tangible to do that will (mostly) not drive you crazy while still piling up small coin gains, and it's something that, once done, will benefit you for the rest of the game (as opposed to coins, which are obviously a one-and-done sort of thing, even if they are more directly helpful).  It might not be an ""insta-win"" factor like the items, but sometimes that tiny bit of extra damage is just enough to save you a turn or two; you see the most returns on the shortest stages (where every tiny bit of extra damage counts) and the longest stages (where that tiny bit of extra damage has time to add up)."

PokemonShuffle,38ahl0,Inhaling_Springtrap,3,Tue Jun 2 23:10:25 2015 UTC,"do you still have that free complexity -1? i've found the easiest way to beat the stage with items is complexity -1 and disruption delay, you dont need anything else (unless youre using a mega other than gengar in which case you might want to purchase a mega start)  the team i used was mega gengar, combusken, heatran and blaziken. combuskens ability allows fire type matches to do more damage with combos so if you can make quick combos you should win with anywhere above 20~ seconds.  genesect has the 1% base catch rate but it is pretty forgiving, i finished with around 20~ seconds left and it had around a 50% catch rate so"

Then it would have a niche in low turn stages, but as it is crowd control is wholly better. I suppose its somewhat balanced out by being on high dmg pokemon youd use anyway as opposed to CC which has low distro.  BTW its last 4 moves!"
PokemonShuffle,388h1w,Rez91,2,Wed Jun 3 00:49:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed, doing that much damage in only three turns/few seconds is so worthless compared to CC like Heracross/Volbeat/Snubull. Especially in time matches where it's harder to get the Pokemon needed for Swarm and then the chances of getting it then is so little too :s Last-Ditch Effort would make the 70 bp Regirock feel so much less underwhelming than he already seems too. Such a hard challenge for a Pokemon with 70 bp and an Ability that won't work if you finish the stage before the last few rounds.. at least Heatran has his 80 power"

PokemonShuffle,384mdr,abrad45,7,Mon Jun 1 20:38:37 2015 UTC,"advance through the levels as stronger pokemon > trained pokemon. stop to catch the better (higher base attack) pokemon and then return later to catch the low-tier pokemon later. you start getting hard diminishing returns on xp/attack after level 5. somebody made a post regarding xp/level and it should give you some insight into significantly how much more xp is required per level for a very incremental boost. for the levels that are few-turn based, more like a puzzle, than a match of bejeweled, its very likely that your megapokemon will not reach its megaevolution before the level ends. in those cases, it is usually a better option to simply use the highest attack effective pokemon instead.  higher catch rate is dependent on fewer turns used. while that advice isnt helpful, there are ways to go about that. the shufflemove app is very good at predicting the correct move to do the most damage per turn. coins spent toward powerups can also reduce the difficulty of the stage to work toward fewer turns, notably complexity -1 allows for huge chains to occur."

PokemonShuffle,384mdr,P-Delta,3,Tue Jun 2 03:00:22 2015 UTC,"Let's see how many of these I can address:   That was usually never an issue for me. I completed stages at a good pace even without focusing on leveling up. I can't think of any Pokemon up to that point that are necessary to have off the top of my head, so list the ones you're missing. The expert stages and a lot of the hard stages usually need to be brute forced with coins. I'd suggest practicing the expert stages and being familiar with the best way to do them yourself before spending coins Don't spend jewels on hearts. Hearts regenerate at a much faster pace than coins, and coins, as I said earlier, help you through those really hard stages. The best thing to do is hoard jewels until you have 12. Then use them all on coins. It's not necessarily important to catch them all. You want to catch the limited time ones because none of us know when/if they'll come back, but for the main stages, there are usually only a few that really make a difference. You definitely want to catch expert Pokemon, as their power is really helpful. I just choose to catch them all because of the completionist in me. Maxing out Pokemon is up to you. I've only maxed a few Pokemon out, and that was just through regular play. I've caught all Pokemon and have all the Mega Stones, so that, to me, says it's not necessary. It can help on those hard stages, and for Victini on Saturdays, definitely focus on those Pokemon that are best. I like to have a good mix of Pokemon using Mega Stones. However, once you get up to the point where most players here are, you'll stop going back to those old Mega Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Audino, Lopunny, etc... The best strategy is coins. There are times when even the most dedicated player can't get anywhere without them. Power-ups make your life easier, and Great Balls will greatly boost your chances for those low catch Pokemon. Exit the game if a Great Ball fails. Use ShuffleMove (this one is a bit of a touchy topic, so it's up to you). Don't hold out on coins and power-ups for those really hard stages; either go big or go home. When going for an Expert Pokemon, always have coins set aside for Great Balls. Learn how to grind coins on Meowth's stage. Grind experience on Ampharos/Buneary. Only use coins to beat a stage if you ABSOLUTELY cannot beat it. Most stages up to Mega Glalie can be beaten without coins. After that, there are a few stages that are near impossible without coins. Go for S-Ranks whenever possible.   I hope I covered everything."
PokemonShuffle,384mdr,Shepdawg1,2,Mon Jun 1 21:27:55 2015 UTC,"Missing:    Ivysaur (59) Marshstomp (63) Espeon (71) Grovyle (72) Cubone (74) Slyveon (79) Meowstic (81) Dedenne (85)   The rest of the disparity between 85-71 is the trainer battles which count as a level but don't offer a catch.  Thanks for your answers. A few questions:   You said to focus on the best pokemon. Is that determined through the attack power stat? You're saying, the second a great ball fails, go home and quit the app and it won't spend the coins? I've checked out ShuffleMove but it seems to take a while to set everything up and input everything, but that's worth it probably in some rare instances.   Thanks!"
PokemonShuffle,384mdr,pineapplesauce,2,Mon Jun 1 22:12:44 2015 UTC,"attack power for the most part. in certain situations you might trade 10 attack for a superior ability. i recommend bookmarking this for future reference: http://www.serebii.net/shuffle/pokemon.shtml doesnt have to be ""the second"" it fails, so long as you do not continue and force an autosave. keep in mind that the game autosaves once you enter a level, so any coins spent toward powerups will still be spent and you'll still lose a heart for the stage. this greatball cancel trick is best used if you're solely looking to catch. if you're trying to beat the level to advance in stages, this will do you no good and only burn your coins. it takes a bit to set up but the pay off is always tremendous as it can find 4+ move chains that you may not be able to see."
PokemonShuffle,384mdr,pineapplesauce,2,Mon Jun 1 22:30:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for the link and explanation of mechanics. I really appreciate it :)
PokemonShuffle,384mdr,NobleArrgon,2,Mon Jun 1 22:44:04 2015 UTC,"None of those Pokemon are worth catching. They all get outclassed by Expert Pokemon. Yes. Attack Power is the main factor in determining the bet Pokemon. Always be checking the attack stats of your Pokemon. It is possible to get some early Pokemon leveled up so they have higher attack powers than later Pokemon. It's worth more in the long run to focus on those that will have larger final attack stats. The second most important factor is ability. Yup. If you exit out of the game as soon as a Great Ball fails, the coins are not taken from you. The window of opportunity is generous, but don't wait too long. And yes, ShuffleMove is useful for those rare situations, but it does take lots of time to setup."
PokemonShuffle,384mdr,Hobocannibal,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:15:13 2015 UTC,thanks much :) I'll pass on those for now and come back later once I've beaten all the normal stages.
PokemonShuffle,384mdr,OldDefault,2,Tue Jun 2 03:01:21 2015 UTC,"How important is it to catch 'em all? Is it better to progress through the game to make sure you get to levels with stronger Pokemon, or will ensuring that you catch every one you encounter give you better success down the road?   Not terribly important. One of the flaws of this game (IMO) is that the early game becomes entirely outclassed and irrelevant when you hit the mid-late game. With maybe a few exceptions, the only relevant pokemon are the ones with 70+ base power and the ones with 60 base power and a unique ability like Mega evolving.   Should I try to level all your Pokemon equally, or just focus on having a few of each type maxxed out?   Focus on just a few, with those few being the above mentioned 70+ base powers and special 60s. Don't waste your time trying to level up your Espurr, because all those early 'mons get outclassed.   Is it worth putting a Pokemon with a Megastone in slot 1 100% of the time, or are there instances (while ""leveling"" before the endgame stuff) that it makes sense to go with another Pokemon with a type advantage?   If a stage only has a few moves, odds are you won't be able to trigger Mega-evolution. So there's no real point bringing a Mega in for those levels, unless that Mega happens to be one of your strongest regular pokemon as well.    What's the best strat for catching Expert / Special Pokemon with crazy-low catch rates. (Telling me to try to increase the catch rate by completing the level in the lowest number of moves is not helpful. Telling me to wait until I catch the rest of them would be, but I don't know if that's what I'm supposed to do or not.)   Honestly? Patience. If you don't spend real $$ on the game, you only have one renewable resource: 1 Heart per 30 minutes. So figure out how much time you want to spend playing, and for that matter, how you want to play this game. For me, I wake up and play Shuffle for ~15 minutes, stop at lunch to play for another round, squeeze in another round before I leave for home, and then one last round before I go to sleep. If you're the type of gamer who does one 3-hour session per day, this game will seem incredibly slow.  That being said, there are five basic ways to spend the hearts that you have: 1) beat main stages, 2) catch missed and/or expert pokemon, 3) S-rank early stages, 4) grind money, and 5) grind levels. The first three are self explanatory. To grind money, you play the Meowth stage (#37) and match the coins before you beat him. You do this many, many times. Here is a guide. To grind levels, you play the Buneary stage (#21) or the Ampharos stage (#130) and simply beat them. Again, you do this many, many times. Here is a guide on how experience works.  My recommendation for catching those harder pokemon is to grind Meowth for ~6,000 coins. This allows you to purchase Mega-Start (2,000) and Disruption Delay (1,500) and then leave you with enough money to throw a Great Ball (2,500) if need be. Make sure that the team you take is all at least level 4 or 5. If you read the guide on experience, you will see that getting to level 5 is relatively easy, but 6 and beyond take much more work. If you don't want to put in that much preparation work, then brute force it by sheer numbers. If a pokemon has a consistent catch rate of 10% for you, be prepared to spend about 8 or so hearts just trying to snag it.   Any tips or tricks i'm missing?  I'm up to stage 85 and have caught 71 Pokemon (I can tell you who I'm missing if you're curious / there are any MUST HAVES in the first 85 levels).   Mega-Mawile is stage 90. It's probably the first real obstacle of the game, and it might feel like a bit of a pay-wall.   I'd say the notable pokemon available to you would be...  Liepard (#87, Base 60 Dark type with a good ability),   Slurpuff (#86, Base 60 Fairy type because fairies don't get any stronger until Xerneas),   Azumarill (#76, same thing as Slurpuff),   Cubone (#74, Ground types are criminally scarce in Shuffle),  Slowbro (#69, one of my favorite Megas),  Mawile (#51), another Mega),  Sableye (#24, another Mega),  And that's pretty much it. Most of the other stuff is just early game fodder. Use it to advance the game, then sub in the better stuff."
PokemonShuffle,384mdr,02pheland,2,Mon Jun 1 22:15:49 2015 UTC,Great guide. Thanks so much for taking the time to write all this out.  I've noticed the lack of ground so far but if you're saying it continues I'd better go back at some point and catch Cubone.
PokemonShuffle,384mdr,Hylian-Highwind,2,Mon Jun 1 23:02:03 2015 UTC,"I've noticed the lack of ground so far but if you're saying it continues I'd better go back at some point and catch Cubone.   It pretty much does continue like that. You get Donphan at 101, Stunfisk at 136, and Marowak at 139. Those are the only 60 power ground types. The one and only 70 power was Groudon, and that event probably won't return for some time.  Until then, you only get Phanphy and Cubone at 50 power. Normally this wouldn't matter so much, because you can often use a type-diverse team to fill your 4 slots (Like for Mega Mawile you can mix fighting, fire, and ground types). What drives me crazy is that Electric is one of two types in the whole game where you can't do that because it only has one weakness (the other type being Normal). And that weakness, Ground, is stupidly short in supply."

PokemonShuffle,384mdr,KamuKid,2,Tue Jun 2 03:02:09 2015 UTC,"Catching them all is up to you, personally I think attempting to S rank the stages are more useful, because that unlocks the expert stages, where you get most of your end game pokemon... with the attempts to S rank, usually you end up catching the pokemon anyway. Hell no. waste of time. There's this thread someone made and updates after every patch that lists the highest base damage pokemon against each type. Note that these do not take into account skill effects which can be REALLY useful late game (lvl 180+) No, dont have to.. especially in the stages where you have <15 moves. (unless youre using mega start, then by all means put a mega stone in there). The only mega i recommend putting in when you have a low move count is M-gengar, he megas pretty quickly. Expert stages.. I caught mine through persistence. If you can easily beat the stage, just keep doing it, you'll eventually catch it. Only bitchy stages are blaziken and genesect.. bloody black clouds. Farm stage 37 meowth for coins, try and match 4 coins(safest) and you gotta make sure you kill meowth to get that easy 330 coin farm. Farm ampharos, stage 130 for free exp."

PokemonShuffle,3828pl,KamuKid,3,Tue Jun 2 09:27:37 2015 UTC,he made a smart team. why are you whining against him?
PokemonShuffle,37ybv3,SamChallis,5,Sun May 31 12:46:15 2015 UTC,"Only 3 Rare candies implies that M-Venusaur evolves really fast (I believe it was mentioned somewhere to be 15 tiles to mega evolve) which is probably its saving grace since its ability is pretty weak outside of really disruption-heavy stages like Milotic. M-Sceptile's higher base power and potential to have a better ability doesn't really give me confidence about M-Venusaur's usefulness but if M-Sceptile is a slow mega evolver, then it won't completely outclass M-Venusaur."
PokemonShuffle,37ybv3,MegaMissingno,5,Sun May 31 14:53:28 2015 UTC,Plus who knows when they will release Sceptilite.  Could be while.
PokemonShuffle,37ybv3,Boltbeam,2,Sun May 31 15:27:33 2015 UTC,"The next competition should be for the Absolite (let's be honest, he's the first pokémon on the Exp. Stages, I think it's the time we got its Mega Stone)."
PokemonShuffle,37ybv3,elleotribal,3,Sun May 31 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'd prefer if the new one is a type that we don't yet have a Mega for.  Maybe Fire, Flying, or Bug."

PokemonShuffle,37ybv3,MegaMissingno,1 point,Sun May 31 17:17:41 2015 UTC,"Venusaur is strong against Water, Rock and Ground. All of those already have some serious competition in form of M-Blastoise, M-Glalie, M-Ampharos and M-Lucario. In Lucario's case some types such as Normal and Steel don't have any competition for the mega spot on top of Lucario's 70 base power, fast mega evolution and better comboing due to not cleaning the entire field at once.  Mega Venusaur will be handy but only as an option. I think its best use right now is a replacement for Mega Ampharos for extremely disruption-heavy stages like the Milotic stage."
PokemonShuffle,37ybv3,valedictions,0,Sun May 31 18:09:13 2015 UTC,3 rare candies indicates that mega venusaur evolves at the same speed as mega audino does
PokemonShuffle,37ybv3,Loreinatoredor,2,Sun May 31 18:13:06 2015 UTC,"According to the data dumps, Mega Venusaur will require 15 blocks matched to fill the mega gauge."
PokemonShuffle,37ybv3,Wrulfy,1 point,Sun May 31 17:33:48 2015 UTC,I hope M-venusaur does more damage per block broken than kangaskhan
PokemonShuffle,37ybv3,treecko4ubers,3,Sun May 31 17:52:36 2015 UTC,Venusaur's base 60 power vs. Kangaskhan's 50 indicate that this is probably going to be true.

PokemonShuffle,37vzit,AlextheGreat2013,3,Sat May 30 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"One tip, try to fit Haunter on your team. He matches the Disruptions, so he helps remove Gengars when he uses that disruption, and can even start combos."

Just a reminder, here is the passcode for 5 free Exp boosts, leaked at the end of April: 04482045  The best use of them is on Victini every week."
PokemonShuffle,37tebg,valedictions,2,Sat May 30 06:18:39 2015 UTC,Also important to note the code expires Monday so put them in now!
PokemonShuffle,37tebg,Mukuro_Ikusaba,2,Sat May 30 11:30:20 2015 UTC,I don't think it's double great ball. I had a 5% catch on victini and procced a super catch. I could see the blue greatball line go to it's normal 10%(double initial rate) but the white supercatch line shot up to 54%
PokemonShuffle,37tebg,andersma,2,Sat May 30 22:55:21 2015 UTC,Mine went from 11 to 45 so maybe the super catch rate varies.
PokemonShuffle,37tebg,Relvamon,4,Sun May 31 00:48:58 2015 UTC,"Earned about half a level for my Level 6 Heracross, if that means anything for scale.  I'm gonna catch Victini before I make my next attempt at Timburr, - Mewtwo - Xerneas - Snubull (Crowd Control) - Victini (Strong Filler)  I just wish they gave it a decent catch rate if it was only available once a week. Even best case scenario (managing some insane combo in one move) you only get a 20% capture rate. Better save up for some Great Balls."
PokemonShuffle,37tebg,GloboX38,5,Sat May 30 06:15:40 2015 UTC,"20% catch rate translates into 80% super catch rate, and that happened for me on the first great ball. I didn't optimize, caught with 11 -> 45%."

Also, I find Mega Glalie's effect to be pretty distracting and annoying since I have to wait for the whole map to refill afterwards, so I haven't even been using him.  If he's one of your best, though, I'd use him.  Also, it really helps to pick Pokémon with distinct colors.  Scizor's bright red color makes him easy to see amongst Genesect's purple or Scyther's green.  For whatever reason, I have trouble discerning Heatran from Ninetales when I'm in a rush.  Since there are a bunch of Pokémon with 70 base power or higher that are super effective against Venusaur, you can experiment with different combinations to avoid picking two Pokémon that are so similar you have trouble telling them apart when playing quickly.  So long as you practice, you can probably make the top 20K with just Lvl. 6 Pokémon, or throw on a Disruption Delay since they're pretty cheap.  Good luck."
PokemonShuffle,37owa3,Dynastico,4,Sat May 30 01:39:45 2015 UTC,"Just focus on keeping the combo going and matching as quickly as possible. I like to make matches that are close together near the bottom of the screen for a chance at automatic falling matches above. Disruptions can really mess this up though, so make sure to clear those quickly or just use a disruption delay if you have the coins.  Most of my Pokemon are also in the level six range and I was able to hold rank in the Lucario competition so I think speed and method are more important than level. Still, high base power Pokemon will always give better results. Sorry I can't say more about level grinding. Good luck."
PokemonShuffle,37owa3,NoNahNope,4,Fri May 29 20:24:29 2015 UTC,"aagggh, i just did 15.4K itemless, it only puts me 6849/98153 US, why do I feel like even this isn't safe?"
PokemonShuffle,37owa3,heavenorspace,7,Tue Jun 2 05:13:11 2015 UTC,"Since we already have a bunch of powerful Megas for water, rock and ground types, M-Venusaur needs a really good ability to justify its usage due to the 60 base power.  Between the three itemless runs, my best score was about 12,5k points. My team was a completely level maxed Glalie. Heatran, Genesect and Ninetails. This next week I should probably focus on grinding up Heracross or some more Fire types as well as practice home button -less expert stages.  EDIT: Right now (31 May) my current high score of 13454 has given me a placing of 4839/53832 in EU. It's not looking too promising for me. I'll most likely have to end up using my C-1 on the next Sunday. But I still like the tension of maybe being able to get the Venusaurite without items. I don't really have anything better to do with this game so I might as well challenge myself with this stage.  EDIT 2: I gave up and went in with both items. Today (3 June) my ranking had dropped to below 7000 and I wasn't very hopeful of my ranking staying within the top 10000 so I chose to secure my score of 23139 at 363/63974. My team was maxed Glalie, Genesect, Heatran and Heracross. The top 5 in EU right now is Toshin ESP (37883), avengah GBR (32961), Scuttler GBR (31220), Adrián ESP (30726) and EOE_Jumi ITA (30433)."

PokemonShuffle,37owa3,JackMasterAndrew,1 point,Sat May 30 01:59:51 2015 UTC,Hard to say. C-1 users are pretty much guaranteed a spot but people are so cautious with them. I'd say you need 14k to be completely safe since that puts you above what most people are capable of itemless. In the end the cutoff could be lower in the 12-13k area.
PokemonShuffle,37owa3,flounder19,2,Sat May 30 06:14:24 2015 UTC,I just used my C-1 and DD. I nearly doubled my high score and was making some insane combos.
PokemonShuffle,37owa3,N0gai,2,Tue Jun 2 16:11:33 2015 UTC,I know. After playing a bunch of times and never breaking out of 10k-13k it was extremely gratifying to just use the dd and c-1 for >20k and be done with it.

Update:  10,813 isn't enough to rank in the top 20,000 anymore.  :(  I tried 5 additional times today and got 12,093 w/ no items, which is good for a rank of 12,872.  I still don't think 12.872 is enough w/ the free Complexity -1 that was given away after the Lucarionite event.

PokemonShuffle,37owa3,Wattouat,3,Sat May 30 08:01:13 2015 UTC,I was on about 12k and used the -1 to get me to 20k+ as I think scores between 10k and 13k will be quite volatile!
PokemonShuffle,37owa3,Wattouat,2,Sat May 30 08:31:36 2015 UTC,"EU here! As of rn, a 10k score gets you below 11k in the ranking, just scored 13k and jumped to 5k. 8 days to go tho :(( I tried to use Gengar as a mega as someone suggested, got only 8k. Glalie is way better imo because if you focus on doing matches on the bottom row, the V-shape of Glalie's power doesn't disturb you too much while allowing combo making above. Hope it helps!"

PokemonShuffle,37owa3,kenniky,0,Fri May 29 15:07:38 2015 UTC,"Fewer items, though. They removed Mega Start from the options so it's strictly DD and -1. And judging from the cutoffs from previous competitions, I'd argue against them being ""pay to win"". So few people seem to want to use coins (if a ton of people did, the cutoffs would be much higher).

Often where you wanna go!), plus people who crutched on the home button exploit just to barely squeeze into a qualifying position, I imagine the cutoff will be a little lower than normal. Probably 11K or so.   I'd say ""Oh, but people will just use their Complexity's!"" but considering casual players can almost effortlessly get 9000 coins in a week (Check ins + Weekend Meowth + Casually rebeating stages) and yet the 20 turn M-Lucario event had an embarrassing ~8000 cutoff across all regions, I'd say the majority of players either refuse to use one, or already used it.

I ask because I thought the ability of the first match always activates as long as conditions are met (note: the match you drop the pokemon into with your stylus is always first)

Also in my experience, don't load up on Fighting types because you'll ending up defeating it before you can get any coin chains. Otherwise, anything really works.  I tend to use things that I'm intending to use for the next level to (very slowly) creep up some experience."

This will help you get the big damage you need in the final turn(s), without accidentally KOing Meowth early the way something like Crowd Control would. Power of 4 is nice to have as well if you need more damage.  If you get it right, you can match all 5 of the coins produced for a 500 coin reward instead of 300. This is riskier, though, so revert to aiming for 300 if it looks like it's not going to work out."

PokemonShuffle,37lp4z,ladykillerwannabe,7,Thu May 28 15:13:44 2015 UTC,"I did pioneer this Regirock strategy and released this video to best show it - http://youtu.be/dc06s1XAZ3I  It started off before the nerf after a week past, and I wanted to S-Rank him personally and with the thought of perhaps a future Regigigas stage needing all the three Regis, I figured that maybe, just maybe adding Regirock into the team would help me S-Rank Regirock before the nerf, and I did (Miiverse link shown within the video).  tl;dr: With that in mind, I figured that leaving the 4th slot open will allow those that didn't catch Regirock, to have him take him up that slot. This strategy is much more useful and needed before the nerf if you wanted to save coins on items. Basically, it acts as a Complexity -1 so you only deal with 4 Pokes instead of 5 in the stage, allowing you to set up your mega faster plus free Regirock combos whenever Regirock summons his minions.  (Regardless if easy or hard Regirock returns, I do think this strategy will prove useful either way. Rock type also does neutral damage against rock enemies)"
PokemonShuffle,37lp4z,Relvamon,3,Thu May 28 15:34:23 2015 UTC,"Are there any other stages that actually play better if you take 3 Pokemon instead of 4? Sometimes the game forces a weak 4th ""support pokemon"" in its place."
PokemonShuffle,37lp4z,ElementUser,3,Thu May 28 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"At this moment, probably not. Almost all other stages should have a Pidgey welcoming you if a 4th slot is left open.  Shaymin stage will have Treecko invading an empty 4th slot, but when you add Shaymin into the team, the initial Shaymin will remain unchanged, so it does let you deal with only 4 Pokemon in the stage (although you can easily remove all the initial Shaymin to begin with). So in this case, it doesn't follow the same as Regirock."

They're not designed to be impossible, they're designed to be hard.  Or, they push you to use items, which I did for a few of the later ones.  I didn't grind my Pokemon to be max level, either.

That's not gonna be a big deal in competitions cause the ""best of the best"" group is probably pretty small, and just from beating up EX Lucario a couple times I think getting ~20K itemless on the next competition should be more than doable, but the competitions aren't the part I wanna lament.  It's Genesect. Fuck him. I mean, you look at the elements in his stage compared to Mewtwo, the stage right before him, and it seems clear what the developer intent was. ""Oh, y'all using that home button shit? Here's a clusterfuck of disruptions AND two garbage support Pokemon! And a fuckton of health! Have fun, dickbags!"" I caught him forever ago with...relatively extreme amounts of home button abuse. Plus a ton of items. His stage is just brutal, leagues beyond Mewtwo.  So with the removal of the exploit, I'd hope Genesect's stage gets a little more kind. Or, at least, M-Charizard gets released with a not-useless ability for Genesect's stage. That, and whenever EX22 rolls around, I hope it's more reasonable. I'm fine expecting challenge, they're ""Expert"" stages after all, but even with every item Genesect's difficulty merely gets lowered to ""kick in the balls"" territory. Use every item on Mewtwo's stage (playing legit) and you can largely drool on the touch screen and you'll finish with 45+ seconds left. Genesect, you gotta be on your A-game no matter what you do."

PokemonShuffle,37iwlq,Loreinatoredor,1 point,Fri May 29 16:03:30 2015 UTC,What? People wouldn't use ShuffleMove on timed challenges. You just make fast matches. They use it on non-timed challenges like the last Lucarionite. It's still a cheat-aid for competitive levels.
PokemonShuffle,37iwlq,icravedanger,0,Thu May 28 01:11:49 2015 UTC,"True, it was tricky, but it could be used as a way to identify the best cascades - now that's a lot harder to do."
PokemonShuffle,37iwlq,Loreinatoredor,1 point,Thu May 28 08:20:57 2015 UTC,"It's not ""tricky"", there was simply no use of it at any time. You would have to tap the home button over and over to see the blocks, which wastes time. Blocks are constantly clearing and falling, and a good cascade can be slower than fast matching. You can also move stuff around without creating any matches.   And now, by the time you have entered in every block, the competition is over."
PokemonShuffle,37iwlq,icravedanger,0,Thu May 28 13:32:14 2015 UTC,"Before, you could go to that sketch thing and see the entire board to decide your next moves."
PokemonShuffle,37iwlq,Loreinatoredor,1 point,Fri May 29 00:11:35 2015 UTC,"What sketch thing? Are we still talking about timed stages here, because as far as those go, the only thing you need is speed."
PokemonShuffle,37iwlq,icravedanger,0,Fri May 29 00:14:28 2015 UTC,"The app on your home screen, which lets you view the upper and lower screens of any open program."
PokemonShuffle,37iwlq,Loreinatoredor,2,Fri May 29 00:19:34 2015 UTC,Well then I guess it depends on how convenient it is but arguing about it is moot since the patch. Shufflemove is still cheating for non timed stages but I don't really care if others use it.
PokemonShuffle,37jpmp,Hylian-Highwind,3,Thu May 28 03:03:42 2015 UTC,"Yes. Get Disruption Delay, Mega Start, and Moves + 5. Take Mega Ampharos and Frebas for sure, and then other Pokemon based on attack power/ability. It may take a while because there's still luck involved, but those will significantly increase your odds."
PokemonShuffle,37jpmp,Shepdawg1,2,Thu May 28 03:14:25 2015 UTC,Funny thing is I had been trying forever to S-rank Milotic and yesterday I finished the stage in 7 moves without items.  The two biggest helps were Shaymin and the Shuffle Move program.
PokemonShuffle,37jpmp,FlipFlopManiac,2,Thu May 28 04:01:03 2015 UTC,"Is more of luck than anything. If you get with feebas a great start so the top blocks are cleared quickly, or at least the board resets often. I once got one single block of the top unfrozen and could just do shitty moves until milotic fills that row with disruptions and resets the board"
PokemonShuffle,37jpmp,Wrulfy,1 point,Thu May 28 11:15:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty much luck. Once I bought the Mega Start and almost didn't defeat it. Next time I just brought my strongest team (w/ Feebas) and he was done only in 6 moves."
PokemonShuffle,37jtsj,KamuKid,6,Thu May 28 03:39:38 2015 UTC,"Good job!! Before coming to this sub, I wasn't aware that Gengar was terribly elusive. I actually caught him on my first try at 2%, but I'm obviously the exception. However, I've spent the past week trying to catch Yveltal, wasted most of my coins in the process. When I wasn't playing the Yveltal level, I tried to get the Lucarionite...to use against Yveltal. I finally caught Yveltal tonight without any items. Feels good, man. :')   Now, I'm going back to trying to get Mega Gengar."
PokemonShuffle,37jtsj,ornithes,3,Thu May 28 06:05:04 2015 UTC,I do not remember having a hard time catching any Pokémon; However there is a handful of them I had a lot of trouble S-ranking...
PokemonShuffle,37jtsj,Chance_Lo,2,Thu May 28 06:47:57 2015 UTC,"My worst nightmare on Shuffle? Mega Glalie at the beggining.  That was hell on earth without a doubt--  Not even with itens I could even defeat him at that point in the game (and when I did, it was pure luck, with rank B and complexity -1 + disruption delay + Mega evolution + 5 moves).  I sucked hard at the game, I guess, but it was THAT difficult for me at least lol"
PokemonShuffle,37jtsj,danpmss,2,Thu May 28 08:14:19 2015 UTC,I cannot catch the frog like Pokémon.  It is annoying.

PokemonShuffle,37ixe5,imdag2,7,Wed May 27 23:33:24 2015 UTC,Buy complexity -1

PokemonShuffle,37ixe5,legomaple,1 point,Thu May 28 08:12:46 2015 UTC,"+5 turns and Disruption Delay will help with the majority of those.  For Genesect, I ran a team of Ninetales/Heatran/Auroras/Aerodactyl (not mega). Made Aero matches to clear away the clouds. Disruption Delay is basically a necessity here; his disruptions are crippling."
PokemonShuffle,37ixe5,DBrody6,1 point,Thu May 28 00:11:02 2015 UTC,"S ranking Skarmory is pretty easy with Mega Start (wipes out blocks quickly depending on the mega you use), as well Moves +5 for assurance.  Good luck with Genesect....gotta go all out on him. Complexity -1, Mega Start, Time +10 and Disruption Delay."
PokemonShuffle,37ixe5,ElementUser,1 point,Thu May 28 02:34:35 2015 UTC,"Time +10 does not add to catch rate, but it does to Ranking."
PokemonShuffle,37ixe5,goomyforever,1 point,Sun May 31 21:46:37 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, there is no easy way to beat the hardest stages.  In the end, it almost always comes down to spending time to grind experience and money.  I beat all those stages by getting my best team members up to level 6 or 7 then spending however many coins I needed to get the S-rank.  I almost always get a Disruption Delay and +5 moves, and if the map starts disruption heavy I'll buy the Mega Start.  I don't believe I needed a Complexity -1 for any of the main stages, although buying one would probably be the easiest solution.  As for Genesect, you'll want the Complexity -1 and everything else besides the Time +10, but don't buy anything until you've practiced the stage a fair amount.  I usually follow the same strategy for all expert stages- focus on making vertical matches at the bottom of the screen.  That way there's less distraction from new columns falling in.  Since Genesect's disruptions mostly come in columns, they aren't that bad.  I would recommend to use Mega Aerodactyl since Genesect starts spawning annoying columns of blocks after a while, and I would rather get rid of the blocks than the clouds.  Plus, don't forget to have some coins in reserve to buy Great Balls at the end.  You really don't want to have to buy more than one Complexity -1 if you can help it.  It also really helps me to play expert stages with my headphones in; it blocks the outside noise and keeps me focused."
PokemonShuffle,37ixe5,Dynastico,1 point,Thu May 28 04:15:27 2015 UTC,"I used the free C-1, Disruption Delay and Mega start on Genesect My team was M-Blastoise, Ninetales, Heatran, Aurorus all level 8.   Disruption delay really helped as for the first 45 seconds you're in the clear for making matches.  Once the metal blocks and smoke clouds came up, Blastoise cleared about 1/3 of the board each time to keep the momentum going. Even though genesect was still on the board, crowd control triggered often and actually helped against himself.  I finished with 19 seconds and had to use a great ball to catch him. The free C-1 was a godsend as I only had to spend 6000 coins to catch him rather than 15000.  This is all without the use of the Home Button trick as I was in the same boat as you. Good luck!"

PokemonShuffle,37eua4,hardgeeklife,5,Wed May 27 03:20:41 2015 UTC,"Has anyone tried making a backup off their sd card, wasting a load of coins and then replacing the data with the older copy? Like loading an old save if you spend a load of coins and still dont catch something.   Do NOT try this (unless you're doing it on a spare 3DS with a Shuffle save file you don't care about). I think I've read that Shuffle is one of the games with anti savegame restore - you could lose your entire save file."
PokemonShuffle,37eua4,TheLightdarker,3,Wed May 27 05:46:48 2015 UTC,"Dumb question...I just updated and I have the extra hearts, but what are they? How do they replenish? I didn't use them yet or anything because I was worried I'd lose them."
PokemonShuffle,37eua4,lumpking69,3,Wed May 27 05:51:48 2015 UTC,"There are now two separate counters. The one on the left shows the five hearts that regenerate. The one on the right shows any extra hearts (most likely hearts that you get from Streetpasses and Jewels). The game uses the five regenerating hearts first and then uses any extra hearts from the stash. I haven't tested this myself, but that appears to be what they're for. Use them to your heart's content."
PokemonShuffle,37eua4,N0gai,4,Wed May 27 07:39:15 2015 UTC,This is really good. At least people who buy hearts will no longer feel like they are dating their 5 base hearts.
PokemonShuffle,37eua4,jaywan1991,1 point,Wed May 27 08:37:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the polite answer! Darn though, I was hoping we would get 2 extra to use whenever per day. Good to know, at least!"
PokemonShuffle,37eua4,y2kcasualty,5,Wed May 27 07:01:04 2015 UTC,"I can't check in. My internet doesn't allow me to download anything from start to finish, it always disconnects in the middle. So it's hard for me to download update data, but easy for me to leave it in sleep mode to download games. While the update ""failed"", I was able to get in game and see the separation of hearts.  Anyways, great job on detailing the patch notes.  And I'm happy about the removal of the home button exploit. Now we will see how much skill everybody really has."
PokemonShuffle,37eua4,Kotakia,2,Wed May 27 07:15:19 2015 UTC,When you catch a pokemon it now automatically displays the stats for it
PokemonShuffle,37eua4,jaywan1991,2,Wed May 27 07:25:35 2015 UTC,I didn't know you could get 1000 gold a day from shaymin. Is there a next best thing now?
PokemonShuffle,37eua4,N0gai,2,Wed May 27 07:18:45 2015 UTC,I was fighting Sceptile and got Super Catch Power after my regular pokeball failed. I did not need to have a Great Ball failure before the Super Catch power was given to me. Might be truly random.

PokemonShuffle,37eua4,joshuralize,2,Wed May 27 17:26:40 2015 UTC,"Well, Luckily I came here to see while updating and could still cancel it.   Idk if I would beat Genesect without it.   Btw, poor people who have to beat Blaziken."

PokemonShuffle,37eua4,Infinitedaw,1 point,Wed May 27 15:03:19 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how the extra bonus hearts work?  Do you only get those 5 extra and that's it?  Once you use them you're back to only ever having 5 at the most?
PokemonShuffle,37fro9,Yokuyin,3,Wed May 27 08:42:52 2015 UTC,I used shaymin on mega-aero several times and it never activated so I think it's true
PokemonShuffle,37fro9,Brancus,3,Wed May 27 09:01:51 2015 UTC,"Update: I'm now checking other types at the moment to see if they trigger. It seems Grass types are also Immune to Sleep Charm (see opening post).  Edits: Steel, Ghost, Ice, Fighting, Dragon and Dark too."
PokemonShuffle,37fro9,Brancus,2,Wed May 27 09:25:28 2015 UTC,"yes, just like fire types can't be burned and electric types can't be paralyzed(don't know about ground and paralyze?) grass types can't be put asleep, similar to the main games because you can't use powder moves on grass types(not entirely the same thing though). But it is weird that rock types can't be put asleep..."

Awesome fieldwork and I do strongly support that it won't work on Rock types, period.  It's somehow similar to Quake or Paralyse not working on Electrics, but it is weird why it doesn't work on Rock, Steel and Ghost types apparently."

PokemonShuffle,37fro9,Chance_Lo,2,Wed May 27 20:13:50 2015 UTC,"I was wondering why Shaymin could not put itself asleep, but I simply thought it had to do with its appearing as a disruption in the Shaymin stage."
PokemonShuffle,37fro9,mzxrules,2,Wed May 27 12:14:08 2015 UTC,"unless this was changed with the recent update, sleep charm definitely works on steel types, as I've had it activate against Steelix several times."

PokemonShuffle,37gjc9,Internutt,2,Wed May 27 13:49:29 2015 UTC,Was that the update today?
PokemonShuffle,37gjc9,nintendobratkat,2,Wed May 27 21:57:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah. When a great ball fails, you now can get super balls that add a full 30% extra to the score on top of the great ball's doubling."
PokemonShuffle,37gjc9,Internutt,2,Wed May 27 22:26:08 2015 UTC,The great ball doesn't need to fail. It can come up before you buy anything.
PokemonShuffle,37fpvq,legomaple,8,Wed May 27 08:15:53 2015 UTC,"Then again, the threshold for getting the Lucarionite was really low for this competition and anyone who was willing to invest a few items (a single Mega Start got me a good +3000 points on my previous record) will get the stone so if anyone seriously wants to get the stone and isn't a complete beginner, will get the the stone.  Besides, the person in 15001 could've been someone who already had the stone."
PokemonShuffle,37fpvq,MegaMissingno,1 point,Wed May 27 09:29:28 2015 UTC,"yeah, what you said, the people that actually wanted lucarionite would have used some kind of item. My US friend used a mega start only and got 9.8k for the lucarionite and they don't have mewtwo."
PokemonShuffle,37fpvq,Hobocannibal,2,Wed May 27 16:55:11 2015 UTC,"Same with me. But if you think about it, if we managed to get a passable score not using items, then the people who really wanted Lucarionite had ample opportunities to get a better score than us (even just using a mega start or something)."
PokemonShuffle,37fpvq,DarthSnoopyFish,2,Wed May 27 21:04:47 2015 UTC,I admit that I went all in for the 2 stones. I bought all items and sealed somebody out on the first day.
PokemonShuffle,37fpvq,warthundersfw,0,Wed May 27 16:46:36 2015 UTC,"I also ruined the Lucarionite for another player, I read it terribly and I through if I ended in the 15000, I would get the 2 jewels, but didn't count to the total of the ones without it.  I ended like 3000 with just optimizing and no items, that sucks for the unlucky players, sorry."
PokemonShuffle,37fpvq,MetaThPr4h,0,Wed May 27 09:06:33 2015 UTC,"I did the same...I just wanted the one jewel and let others get the stone, but I accidentally optimized my team and got an 8k score despite trying to sandbag it. I honestly thought ""that'll take me out of the top 30k, no problem."". To my horror on Monday I got 2 jewels. I feel so damn crummy. Next time I'm trying harder to lose."
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,joshuralize,8,Wed May 27 02:27:11 2015 UTC,I'm not liking the way this looks... What do you guys think it will do? Change the Mega effect? Just level the Pokemon?
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,andersma,12,Wed May 27 03:08:29 2015 UTC,"From the looks of it--the quick evolving ones (like Gengar) can't be fed many, while long ones like Banette can be fed a bunch. Would lead credence to a theory that each rare candy reduces the number of tiles needed to mega evolve by one."
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,DBrody6,6,Wed May 27 03:53:28 2015 UTC,"Ooh, you might be onto something!"
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,andersma,5,Wed May 27 04:32:48 2015 UTC,"I think it most likely alters the Mega Effect, as the ""Rare Candy"" counter only appears next to Pokemon with Mega Stones."
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,Shepdawg1,2,Wed May 27 03:25:39 2015 UTC,Agreed.
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,andersma,1 point,Wed May 27 03:53:24 2015 UTC,I actually could like it. At least they are aware that the game is stalling and trying to improve it.
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,drumsoverbogota,0,Wed May 27 03:30:06 2015 UTC,"Well, it's going to suck when these Rare Candies are required (but also purchasable for $0.99!). It could be interesting though."
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,andersma,6,Wed May 27 03:54:08 2015 UTC,"I say it all depends on what they do, and how they are obtained(real money or in game coins). If they're not super powerful, or can be bought with coins, I have no problem with it. But if they're very powerful and can only be purchased with cash, I'll be upset."
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,bogaboy,1 point,Wed May 27 03:57:45 2015 UTC,"I'd say Jewels or Coins. Maybe it's 1 candy per jewel, depending on what the candy does?"
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,legomaple,5,Wed May 27 08:50:29 2015 UTC,Woah.
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,DoktorFeelgood,2,Wed May 27 02:43:09 2015 UTC,"It seems to reduce the matches needed by a certain amount as slow megas like amph and sable needs 7 and 8, whereas fast ones like gengar only need 1.  on a side note, it takes 84 rare candies to max out every mega's candy count so far. At that amount i hope its not an event thing. I cant see them in the jewel shop so hopefully its not a jewel thing.  Ill note though that last event there were complaints that people were earning jewels and stopping those who needed the actual mega stones. Perhaps its a case of ""Already got the mega stone? have a rare candy instead"". They seem to be connected to megas already, thogh 84 would be a lot. Maybe its ""didnt get the mega stone? have a rare candy. alread had it? have two"" and gems becomes purely purchased again (or every 100 passes).  The symbol on the candy seems to show theyll be called ""Mega Candy"" though."
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,Swithe,1 point,Wed May 27 09:17:42 2015 UTC,it could be a threshold instead of 1:1 spending.
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,Tagrineth,1 point,Wed May 27 14:01:12 2015 UTC,so from now on earning 1 jewel = 4 candy or something?
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,Swithe,1 point,Wed May 27 14:19:09 2015 UTC,Are rare candies something permanent?  Also how do you get them?
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,Ekint,1 point,Wed May 27 08:20:15 2015 UTC,somebody know how to get them?
PokemonShuffle,37ermg,Fenor,1 point,Wed May 27 10:15:42 2015 UTC,No one knows yet. They will probably be added fully to the game on Monday.

PokemonShuffle,37fuwy,Infinitedaw,2,Wed May 27 13:45:18 2015 UTC,Yes I do based on these images found in the game's files.

PokemonShuffle,37b87a,hopsizzle,0,Thu May 28 02:22:02 2015 UTC,Got it today after I updated my game.
PokemonShuffle,37b87a,DarthSnoopyFish,4,Thu May 28 02:52:59 2015 UTC,Well then tomorrow you wont. It only happens ONCE after update.   I've tried it TWICE already and no extra 1k gold.

But the rest really dont need - complexity, just +5moves/megastart/disruption delay will get you S rank. Bagon doesnt even need items, just catch bagon and use bagon against bagon, dragon super effective against dragons, easy."
PokemonShuffle,37egqt,tale-wind,1 point,Wed May 27 16:50:48 2015 UTC,I ended up unlocking and catching Genesect yesterday. I used the free comp -1 plus the home button trick on him then I updated it:D.

The problem I have with this list is that, as I said, I do not want to count them one by one. This list features the unavailable incoming Pokes, so there are more than 228 atm.

PokemonShuffle,37asf3,legomaple,-3,Tue May 26 07:12:51 2015 UTC,It takes longer to write a reddit post than to count the pokemon

PokemonShuffle,3778r2,ElementUser,2,Mon May 25 23:28:08 2015 UTC,"He's particularly good for screen clears, especially vs. black cloud disruptions. And he's powerful too!  The downside is that his mega clear pattern kills a lot of combo streaks because the clear pattern simply doesn't lead to combos. If you're looking for a combo-esque match, Mega Gengar/Banette/Mewtwo Y/Mawile/Ampharos/Glalie are way better for chaining into tons of combos."

PokemonShuffle,376l5w,MegaMissingno,1 point,Mon May 25 09:05:39 2015 UTC,"i never noticed it factored in disruptions before. For example on stages that started with steel blocks, they would still be there after i used it, i would just have 1 less pokemon.  The new description makes it sound like it just removes the obstacles from appearaing on stages where they drop down?"
PokemonShuffle,376l5w,Wrulfy,4,Mon May 25 10:34:25 2015 UTC,"it basically removes the last thing on the pool of things that can fall down, that includes your pokemon, extra pokemon (usually just one, like in most mega stages and Ex, but Genesect uses 2) and wooden blocks/coins  I believe metal blocks that fall in a certain pattern, like those ones in Timbur stage might not count, but if someone have used it with timbur can confirm."
PokemonShuffle,376l5w,BananaSplit2,2,Mon May 25 11:53:01 2015 UTC,"ah, so it can only do that effect on stages where the blocks count as ""falling"" hazrds, but stages where they start on screen or are added through disruptions are entirely unaffected.  Thats good news then i guess. I was a little worried as id never noticed that effect so was worried theyd been nerfed. I was looking for some input as i didnt know. Luckily i got all my S ranks already so had it been nerfed it wouldnt have been so bad for me =P"
PokemonShuffle,376uc0,Relvamon,1 point,Mon May 25 10:31:59 2015 UTC,":( How? Any pointers, please. Which shaymin intersections to you take out first?"
PokemonShuffle,376uc0,KamuKid,1 point,Mon May 25 14:26:39 2015 UTC,Thanks.
PokemonShuffle,376uc0,KamuKid,2,Fri May 29 04:29:15 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool! It won't matter that much since looks like Special stages ranks don't matter, but it's nice anyways, thanks for the effort"
PokemonShuffle,376uc0,MetaThPr4h,3,Fri May 29 04:51:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, the video wouldn't help catching Shaymin at all, haha.  I'm pretty sure that people can just as easily S-Rank it with their main optimised 4 Pokes xD"
PokemonShuffle,376uc0,Boltbeam,2,Fri May 29 04:56:39 2015 UTC,I think the Crowd Control strategy works just as well if not better.  M-Gengar/Genesect/Heracross easily destroys this stage.
PokemonShuffle,376uc0,N0gai,1 point,Mon May 25 10:55:11 2015 UTC,"the missing slot strategy worked with Regirock? damn, so many coins wasted."
PokemonShuffle,37611h,danpmss,6,Mon May 25 04:28:08 2015 UTC,"Assuming linear power growth per level, it means that those 30 Attack Power pokemon has a max potential of +40 Attack once they reach level 10, leading to a final Attack Power of 70.  Not worth it :S"
PokemonShuffle,37611h,ElementUser,3,Mon May 25 04:45:41 2015 UTC,"Thought the same thing too. Makes me wonder why exactly did the developers made things like that (Smeargle's ability is not even something better than the usual (like the ""+"" abilities), and besides, it's a normal type).  I really expected that to be an opportunity to make Mismagius slightly superior to its pre-evolution or something, but in the end, it was pretty much pointless...  Maybe they have especific plans for them in the future (like Milotic stage had the obligatory use of Feebas (inferior pokemon), or something. I just can't see the logic in some aspects (I still think Mismagius base has been done wrong).  In any case, no pokemon above lv.30 have this bonus atk feature so far, I'll update this as soon as I finish leveling up all the mon (up to level 5)."
PokemonShuffle,37611h,Boltbeam,2,Mon May 25 05:02:06 2015 UTC,I just assumed they made 30 base pokemon grow faster so that the beginning of the game wouldn't be too much of a grind.
PokemonShuffle,37611h,leoxyz,2,Mon May 25 05:42:41 2015 UTC,"Problem is, Smeargle is post Mewtwo (Same goes for Feebas).  It's kinda illogical tbh :p"

PokemonShuffle,374u25,thehintguy,2,Sun May 24 22:06:23 2015 UTC,"currently ranked around 9000 out of 118798, so i should be pretty fine. i'm guessing that events like this will happen for blastoise and banette, but im also hoping that there'll be new mega / competition opportunities in the meantime."
PokemonShuffle,374u25,valedictions,1 point,Sun May 24 22:41:21 2015 UTC,They still have like 500 more Pokemon to release
PokemonShuffle,374u25,optimist33,1 point,Mon May 25 00:41:01 2015 UTC,I think he means he's hoping they'll release some more new stages before just cycling back through the old ones.
PokemonShuffle,374u25,Sillyjones,2,Mon May 25 03:45:03 2015 UTC,"Where are you geographically? If you are EU then top 15,000 get prizes, you might want to be a bit careful in this care, if you are NA then don't worry, I think that's top 30,000."
PokemonShuffle,374u25,cjs911217,1 point,Sun May 24 22:33:54 2015 UTC,"Just under 4,000 atm. I got confused originally and thought it was only 4,000 players that would get it this time around. So glad I misread x_x"

PokemonShuffle,374u25,cheeseandcereal,1 point,Sun May 24 23:04:44 2015 UTC,When do you  find out if you got it?
PokemonShuffle,374u25,TenebrousEye,1 point,Mon May 25 01:43:41 2015 UTC,"PSA: If you already had a lucarionite before this event, and you qualified for another one again, you will receive 2 jewels instead."
PokemonShuffle,374u25,Fenor,1 point,Mon May 25 05:42:02 2015 UTC,And this time I managed. At about 5000th place but I currently have 100% on events again so that's nice.
PokemonShuffle,376agh,Parliamentronic,2,Mon May 25 06:02:26 2015 UTC,Shaymin is Grass type  Base 70  Sleep Charm - Leaves the foe asleep
PokemonShuffle,376agh,Boltbeam,0,Mon May 25 06:10:33 2015 UTC,Beat it but not caught yet!
PokemonShuffle,376agh,Ali-Sama,1 point,Mon May 25 06:17:28 2015 UTC,Nice to see an easy and fun event after Regirock and Lucario competence
PokemonShuffle,376agh,drumsoverbogota,0,Mon May 25 06:28:03 2015 UTC,What is this?
PokemonShuffle,376d5h,Artieee,4,Mon May 25 06:33:42 2015 UTC,"It is possible for them to return for a third time. If they were to bring them back, it would probably not be until later on. But I'm sure Nintendo understands that new players join the game every day so it is in their best interest to bring back old content once in a while"
PokemonShuffle,376d5h,RagingHadouken,3,Mon May 25 06:43:05 2015 UTC,wouldn't be surprised if it happened
PokemonShuffle,376d5h,CKMo,3,Mon May 25 07:09:42 2015 UTC,Probably every few months.
PokemonShuffle,376d5h,nintendobratkat,-1,Mon May 25 07:27:36 2015 UTC,"Mew returned, Rotoms Returned, Lucarinite returned.  Sounds like they will all be back eventually."
PokemonShuffle,3769kn,CKMo,2,Mon May 25 05:53:21 2015 UTC,This one was hard.
PokemonShuffle,3769kn,Ali-Sama,2,Mon May 25 06:19:08 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter anymore. Try to get Shaymin.
PokemonShuffle,3769kn,AvatarMew,1 point,Mon May 25 06:05:34 2015 UTC,have caught all pokemon and plan to continue that trend. have never spent a cent. game is not p2w
PokemonShuffle,3769kn,P-Delta,1 point,Mon May 25 06:42:44 2015 UTC,"By now the event might been finished but have you tried emptying one slot method? It worked for me and it goes like this:  My team: Mega Mawile, Swarmpert & Marowak ( I leave out one support pokemon bc it will replace that slot with Regirock itself)  Swarpert and Marowak both got great abilities which boost the dmg when triggered in a row. Mega Mawile is great for the coverage. Regirock will spawn itself occasionally and does combo due to empty  slot filled with Regirock.''  EDIT: forgot to mention this is done without using powerups/coin at all"
PokemonShuffle,3769kn,Houeclipse,1 point,Mon May 25 13:37:28 2015 UTC,"never tried that. i didnt know that if you left one slot empty, regirock would fill it. doesnt that technically mean complexity -1?"
PokemonShuffle,374kdw,SmithsEnemy,7,Sun May 24 20:37:06 2015 UTC,Do you know you can quit the game through home menu before the game saves any coins you spent on Great Balls?

PokemonShuffle,374kdw,danpmss,2,Mon May 25 04:03:06 2015 UTC,I did not know that. Number 31 here we go..

PokemonShuffle,374kdw,person6445,2,Mon May 25 00:39:07 2015 UTC,You're not alone MAero is my only S rank left too. I've thrown like 15000 coins at this thing with a bunch of strategies and still fall just short of that S every single time.
PokemonShuffle,374kdw,trepvox,1 point,Mon May 25 01:25:39 2015 UTC,-1 Complexity my butt. And it feels like no Mega is strong enough to counter act that many blocks.
PokemonShuffle,374kdw,Chance_Lo,2,Mon May 25 03:58:46 2015 UTC,Mega Aero itself maybe
PokemonShuffle,374kdw,KyuubiReddit,1 point,Mon May 25 11:01:39 2015 UTC,I was well past level 100 and I kept having issues catching Slowbro... yeah Slowbro... I refused to use a Great Ball and just kept trying till I got him.

PokemonShuffle,3734af,LaNoir_aka_Blacky,3,Sun May 24 12:39:09 2015 UTC,Tried this. Made 7500 minus 2800. Good!
PokemonShuffle,3734af,drumsoverbogota,3,Sun May 24 13:22:03 2015 UTC,How about Mega Mewtwo Y with psychic types? Swap won't proc when Mewtwo is in his mega form.
PokemonShuffle,3734af,ElementUser,3,Sun May 24 16:09:39 2015 UTC,"Holy crap - just got 5,300 coins with Mega Banette, Chandelure, Lampent, and Cherrim. If memory serves, that is indeed better than I've done with Mega Gengar. Thanks for the tip!  Edit: I did NOT buy mega start, but did pick up +5 moves."
PokemonShuffle,3734af,TheLightdarker,2,Sun May 24 19:04:01 2015 UTC,"hey what's up, is M Banette really needed or I can use another pokemon ?"
PokemonShuffle,3734af,v95z,7,Sun May 24 14:57:18 2015 UTC,M Banette has the same ability as M Mewtwo so if you've got that the process will work the same with psychic types.
PokemonShuffle,3734af,Kotakia,2,Sun May 24 16:52:02 2015 UTC,U sexy sexy person I love you :D
PokemonShuffle,3734af,sauceLegs,2,Sun May 31 13:42:37 2015 UTC,Does having more than ghost type help if I'm buying the mega start? Would having m-banette a ghost type and two quirky plus be the best setup?
PokemonShuffle,3734af,optimist33,2,Mon May 25 00:58:03 2015 UTC,I'm wondering that too.  Is it better to have the 2 Quirky+ mons (Xerneas and Cherrim) or to have more ghost types for Banette to choose from
PokemonShuffle,3734af,beardedpancakes,3,Mon May 25 03:01:36 2015 UTC,I literally just posted this on Friday night...
PokemonShuffle,3734af,bogaboy,1 point,Sun May 24 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I wrote this 1 week ago, but I wanted to wait until I can show a screenshot that it really works, so I had to wait until weekend. The internet is a cruel world and I wanted to give the people something they can believe on. Not like there is any reward for making guides, I just wanted to share my experiences. If you posted something similar a few days ago, then I am sorry, but I haven't stolen it from you if you think so."
PokemonShuffle,3734af,bogaboy,-2,Thu May 28 02:07:45 2015 UTC,"I never claimed you ""stole"" anything. I'll admit, I was slightly annoyed when I made the comment, but nothing more. You posting doesn't affect me in the slightest, even if you did just copy from my post (I'm not saying you did). At the very most it was a redundant post, and maybe you should've searched for similar posts first. But no harm no foul, and the more people that can benefit from our discoveries the better."

PokemonShuffle,3734af,Houeclipse,1 point,Sun May 24 17:17:31 2015 UTC,Awesome strategy! I will try this soon. Any video walk through?
PokemonShuffle,372as4,thehintguy,7,Sun May 24 05:00:29 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of data :O thanks for sharing!  Would like to add:   Meowth's disruption may indeed ""transform"" a coin into a coin. Happened to me once -_- But it's really unlikely to happen, because its disruptions happen only in the center of the grid, never the borders (i.e. only at middle 16 squares). So I had put my coin there to try maneuvering it into it's rightful place later, and then it makes that stupid disruption. No surprise I don't try this way anymore. I do believe it's best to rely on skills, specially some like Last-Ditch Effort and Hitting Streak (as discussed in a recent thread) than having a team like yours, with two fighting types. You have much more control on when to trigger a skill and when not to (e.g. if you move a Pokémon icon from A to B, instead of from B to A). I didn't record my progress but I have the impression my results were relatively better than yours (specially the 36% overkill stat). Meowth has 1160 HP, and you can see how much is left of its HP if you look at your current score. This way, if you know the attack power from each of your Pokémon, you can optimize the chances of not killing it too early and making sure it will die with your last move. A recurrent calc I keep doing in my head when trying to match 5 coins is to multiply a known attack power by 1.1 (rounded down), because it's how much the 2nd match of a combo will get, but there are many more (there should be a thread on Combo and Skill multipliers somewhere).   I could list some other tips, but this is already too long, and well, practice should be enough for people to eventually notice them."
PokemonShuffle,372as4,leoxyz,3,Sun May 24 15:51:02 2015 UTC,"I have not observed Meowth changing a coin into a coin, so I don’t know if that’s a possibility or not.   I can confirm that this is indeed possible to happen. :´("
PokemonShuffle,372as4,raygius,1 point,Mon May 25 15:04:43 2015 UTC,"Same. I don't have a screenshot or anything, but I have had a few times where he simply turns a coin into a coin instead of creating a new coin."
PokemonShuffle,372as4,Exodiafinder687,1 point,Mon May 25 16:19:30 2015 UTC,Excellent analysis! Thank you for wasting spending time on this research :D
PokemonShuffle,372as4,Houeclipse,0,Mon May 25 13:47:29 2015 UTC,"You are better off aiming for the 4 coin 300 bonus everytime.  On a bad day when combos screw me, i get about 75% success rate on the 4 coin.  This would bring you to a higher coins per heart average of around 250.  This also reduces your time spent significantly.  It is a good analysis but you should have furthered it with a TLDR on what is optimal.  5 coins imo is not optimal because you spend quite a bit of time trying to set the board up to achieve this, where as you can mindlessly blow through a 4 coin set up.  Always aim for 4 coin, and finishes with 100 if you get a bad combo.  Use 1 fighting and rest neutral pokemon."
PokemonShuffle,372as4,Almidas,1 point,Tue May 26 16:22:35 2015 UTC,"No. Absolutely not. We calculated it on GameFAQs, and a player who gets 530 50% plus a few 330s does better than a player who gets 330 90% of the time. People who only go for 330 report daily hauls of 8-10k, but people who aggressively play for 530 but bail if it starts to look bad? They tend to make upwards of 15k a day. Read the Meowth topics on GameFAQs for more information. My personal record is just under 20,000 a day and I've had EIGHT 530s IN A ROW. Also, it doesn't matter if it takes a few seconds longer because you have to wait for hearts anyway!"
PokemonShuffle,371syv,ElementUser,3,Sun May 24 01:49:20 2015 UTC,"A lot of skills are situationally useful. The ones that increase other Mon's power if they share a type, Quirky+ for removing itself, Stabilize+ for removing disruptions, skills that delay disruptions such as Quake and Sleep, etc. I prefer a disruption delay skill over a slight damage boost. Crowd control is OP though, I agree."
PokemonShuffle,371syv,icravedanger,3,Sun May 24 03:17:59 2015 UTC,"Crowd Control is by far the best ability in the game, I love playing Heracross or Genesect, their raw power with that ability is insane"
PokemonShuffle,371syv,MetaThPr4h,2,Sun May 24 08:56:19 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Crowd Control activates 100% of the time with a match of 4.
PokemonShuffle,371syv,Boltbeam,2,Sun May 24 01:59:07 2015 UTC,"it doesnt. its high, id say 92%+ but its most definitely can miss on 4."
PokemonShuffle,371syv,P-Delta,2,Sun May 24 03:16:40 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I've never had it fail for me.  Are you always ""dragging to"" it   to make a match of 4 rather than ""dragging away""?"
PokemonShuffle,371syv,Boltbeam,1 point,Sun May 24 16:17:54 2015 UTC,buneary stage as one can tell from entire left side being filled by blocks. screens are both full of pokemon for proof that only first move is being made. the first shows a normal 4-match of heracross. the second screenshot shows a sucessful activation of crowd-control and the significantly increased damage as a result. http://imgur.com/m3GYong http://imgur.com/4NJk04F
PokemonShuffle,371syv,P-Delta,2,Sun May 24 21:07:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, Crowd Control will NEVER activate if you're matching the only existing tiles of that species. The first screenshot, you're matching the only Heracrosses on the board. CC does 50 damage per additional tile that isn't used in the match, so even if it did trigger, you'd be dealing no additional damage regardless."
PokemonShuffle,371syv,DBrody6,1 point,Mon May 25 06:24:24 2015 UTC,makes sense. definitely oversaw that when i noticed that sometimes it wouldnt proc. will continue to look into it. here's to me being wrong
PokemonShuffle,371syv,P-Delta,1 point,Mon May 25 06:45:01 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I concede.  I've never seen that before.  Thanks for the pics!"
PokemonShuffle,371syv,Boltbeam,2,Sun May 24 22:57:16 2015 UTC,Im not a huge fan of Mega Boost since it doesnt activate that often and doesnt appear to give an equalivant boost to the Mega Bar it doesnt often seem better than just matching the Mega. Itd be nice if skills could proc on combos...  I think the status effect (burn spookify) could see more use as those types get stronger.
PokemonShuffle,371syv,Rez91,1 point,Sun May 24 04:48:17 2015 UTC,"Gotta love this thread!  I'd just note that Vitality Drain takes 10% off the Pokémon's remaining HP. So, best to use it by the beginning. And do never rely on its trigger for Competitions, it'll do 0 damage."

PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,icravedanger,2,Sat May 23 06:45:10 2015 UTC,"I was about to ask if you got 500 after deducing the 800 coins from +5 Moves lol Anyway it seems like it was really bad luck. Anyway I do not think you would have gotten that many coins with a good run, because you forgot +5 Moves. Have you been able to mega evolve?"
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,Chance_Lo,1 point,Sat May 23 06:51:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I probably wasted 3 moves getting Gengar to mega evolve, and then there were only 3-4 Gengars on the screen for the rest of the match. Oh that's right. It must have been the bad luck from bringing Farfetchd when I normally run Haunter. Never again.  Any overall score of 3000 or so would be considered good to me, my highest was around 4500 but that was luck. No matter what I get, it's very much based on luck."
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,icravedanger,1 point,Sat May 23 07:05:29 2015 UTC,"Ahah I would go for Farfetch'd as well, just because his color is distinct from Gengar's and it makes it easier to spot the matches."
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,Chance_Lo,3,Sat May 23 07:35:25 2015 UTC,"Does Mega Banette evolve fast enough? By the way, is there a list that shows how fast each Mega evolution happens?"
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,Chance_Lo,2,Sat May 23 05:32:06 2015 UTC,"Gengar and audino evolve almost instantly, Banette, from what I can tell is rather slow, even with the mega booster. But maybe I just fkd up."
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,N0gai,3,Mon May 25 09:41:04 2015 UTC,"So I just tried this strategy with Mega Banette, Chandelure, Lampent, and Xerneas. I used Lampent because I think rushing with Mega Boost is kinda the point here.  I know that my personal average for weekend Meowth is floating just under 2K coins per run. My highest previously was 2,600. Just now I got 3,300, so I netted 2,500 coins. And I think I may have played a bit clumsily but whatever.    To tell if your purchase of +5 moves was profitable, take your total gold for the level and divide it by 3. If it's over 800, then you made more than your money back.   I get that you use this to find your average profit per 5 turns, but I think the extra 5 turns are worth much more. We're relying on mega-triggers for this strategy, and that takes time to build up for a higher payout. If there were an option to buy 10 turns for 2K gold, I would take it here."
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,pineapplesauce,2,Sat May 23 06:25:27 2015 UTC,"To tell if your purchase of +5 moves was profitable, take your total gold for the level and divide it by 3. If it's over 800, then you made more than your money back.   I agree, I do not think it does work like this. To me, you should just see how much money you make with the five last turns, and if it is above 800, then buying it was worth it.  Edit: I think I agree on Lampent as well... Not sure though."
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,Chance_Lo,2,Sat May 23 06:31:21 2015 UTC,Wouldn't Mewtwo also work?
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,drumsoverbogota,2,Sat May 23 04:40:45 2015 UTC,"I think Mewtwo would take too long to trigger the mega evolution, even with a full team of Mega Boost."
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,pineapplesauce,3,Sat May 23 06:04:32 2015 UTC,"also, when matching mewtwos you have the small chance of activating swap (no really sure as coins there are more like the 5th pokemon) but mega banette can boost itself"
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,Wrulfy,2,Sat May 23 08:49:56 2015 UTC,"Damn, it sure works, got 4300 (-800 for +5 moves) I even got 700 coins for a 6 coins due to Bannete cleaning hard+ Meowth coin spawn. The start is slow but later the combos go like crazy, thanks"
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,MetaThPr4h,1 point,Sat May 23 06:20:56 2015 UTC,4300 doesn't seem crazy compared to Mega Gengar imho
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,Chance_Lo,3,Sat May 23 06:22:59 2015 UTC,"I used MGengar until now and got around 3000 and 3500, so its an improvement."
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,MetaThPr4h,2,Sat May 23 06:42:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, I guess it will take a few runs with M Banette to determine if it is worth it or not anyway. At least it seems really viable."
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,Chance_Lo,2,Sat May 23 06:53:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's easily the best tips I've read so far!! I would usually get ~1300 coins, even with the quirky pokemons, got 4300 today!"
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,Wattouat,2,Sun May 24 08:58:31 2015 UTC,Glad it worked for you!
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,Wrulfy,1 point,Sun May 24 11:27:43 2015 UTC,"I usually use Mgengar, cherrim, xerneas and haunter, but yes, I should use bannete or chandelure instead, unless you get a match 5 is not guaranteed quirky activation  What I do is use shufflemove too, but 0.2.5 works better for that. assign a different type (sans fighting or ghost) to each one (I usually go for colors poison for gengar, dragon for xerneas, electric for cherrim, dark for haunter, normal for coins) and set gengar to 100 attack, the rest to 50 and coins to 1. that way shuffle move will try to mach gengars at first, then combo with the rest, and pretty much ignoring coins unless they're part of the combo. That way there will be more chances of getting meowth automaticaly making matches with coins with his disruption  After M gengar has evolved, I set the whole team to 100, so shufflemove tries to mach the most without any preference, and in the last turn, assing the most damage to coins, or just try to get 300 or 500 on the last turn"
PokemonShuffle,36y1sq,digikari4691,1 point,Sat May 23 08:48:35 2015 UTC,"I just got 7300 with M-Gengar, Xerneas, Cherrim, and Chandelure which was pretty sweet (although definitely a record for me). Usually get between 3k-5k depending on how many combos trigger. If your team is more profitable than this, I'd give it a try though!"
PokemonShuffle,36xufe,Chance_Lo,3,Sat May 23 00:44:17 2015 UTC,"I will say, that stage has made me gain a newfound respect for Last-Ditch Effort."
PokemonShuffle,36xufe,TheLightdarker,1 point,Sat May 23 01:20:44 2015 UTC,"I roll with one fighting type and one ghost type, so that I have a bit more control over how much damage I want to do. And I usually attempt to match 5."
PokemonShuffle,36xufe,icravedanger,1 point,Sat May 23 06:37:31 2015 UTC,I do not know why I haven't thought of that before as well; I will do. I am just a little concerned about the fighting type bursting too much during random combos. But I guess with enough attention you can prevent random combos from happening.
PokemonShuffle,36xufe,icravedanger,2,Sat May 23 06:46:11 2015 UTC,"That will just happen to you, and you'll get 30 coins as consolation. But you can usually take note of all the positions of your fighting type and avoid matching them if you've already triggered a 5+ combo. Without the fighting type, you'll be in a sticky situation a lot of the time when you're forced to look for combos, particularly if you choose to go for 5. Having a fighting (Lucario uses the exp really well) is more important than having a ghost.  If you shoot for a match 5, all sorts of crazy things happen. But the gambling excitement is the only thing that makes grinding Meowth fun."
PokemonShuffle,36xufe,icravedanger,1 point,Sat May 23 06:56:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the burst of damage must be useful at the end of the stage, but this is why I use Last Ditch Effort. It almost always triggers on the last 3 turns (I do not know how exactly this has been programmed but maybe it always does trigger when you reach the last quarter of the stage or something like that?)   But the gambling excitement is the only thing that makes grinding Meowth fun.   I think you're right, but everytime I do not get at least 330, I feel a bit sad. It does not prevent me from going full retard on this stage and not planning anything, but still. If i had more time or less hearts, I would consider making the most out of every play; but now that I S-ranked and caught everything, I do not have much to do. I would grind xp so much more if Ampharos stage was not so long to complete."
PokemonShuffle,36xufe,leoxyz,1 point,Sat May 23 07:09:35 2015 UTC,"Last Ditch is probably just the last 3 turns, but I'm not sure.   You're not a gambler at heart, so you feel sad. I'm perfectly okay with  making a match 5 and losing the stage, or being 1 move away from a match 5 and ending the stage early, but I have to take the risk.  And grinding exp is totally not worth your time. Hopefully you have other games to play once you've S-ranked everything."
PokemonShuffle,36xufe,leoxyz,1 point,Sat May 23 07:17:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I feel better when I lack that extra 2 damage to get the kill and 530 coins rather than getting an early kill because of a big combo: at least I feel like it was just my genuinely being bad. Wait, I should not feel better about this...  Yeah, I really feel like I am wasting my time on this game and even more so when I fight Ampharos. I do play a few other games as Shuffle just to kill time; but I mostly play SSBM. Problem is, we are really few playing it in our city, and the few guys I used to play with suddenly stopped playing uguu.  So since I am on holiday, I have plenty of time to kill both Meowth and Ampharos and wonder what the hell am I doing with my life."
PokemonShuffle,36xufe,leoxyz,1 point,Sat May 23 07:32:11 2015 UTC,"The Last-Ditch Effort skill can be triggered during the last 4 moves; and the bigger the match, the higher the chances it'll trigger."

As you said, Heatran saved me a lot of times at the last turn (after 5-matching-coins), but also sometimes Aurorus with its Hitting Streak bonus. And since Aerodactyl's power was far less than the others, it helped me calc and prevent early kills as well.  Oh, and I actually assembled this team to go against Genesect, so two birds with a stone: they all got to Lv.Max this week, and I got the freaking insect."

PokemonShuffle,36otag,Alpine54,7,Wed May 20 23:34:46 2015 UTC,"To be fair, up to about £40 in total, you can justify buying gems. After that point this F2P game has cost more than it would have if it was released as a full game in stores to buy. You've probably played this as much (if not more) than some games you've gone to a store and bought for £40. I know I've certainly wasted money on games I ended up hating and only got half of it back when I traded them in."
PokemonShuffle,36otag,ortizr93,3,Thu May 21 01:44:58 2015 UTC,"I agree!  I'd say Pokemon Shuffle would've made a great ~$40 3DS game so it's justified to spend some money, especially if it supports what you like (Nintendo, Pokemon, or the combination thereof) :)"
PokemonShuffle,36otag,digikari4691,10,Thu May 21 02:17:40 2015 UTC,"$40 can buy you Xenoblade/Fire Emblem/MH4U, Pokemon Shuffle is nowhere near that."
PokemonShuffle,36otag,icravedanger,5,Thu May 21 02:46:20 2015 UTC,"You know, I would've said $30 would've been good because I was thinking like Puzzle and Dragons, but then I realized that was basically 2 games. This game doesn't have much over the quality of a eshop game, and it's related spin-off, Pokemon Battle Trozei is $8. I mean, They could've priced it around $15-$20. I find that more people would buy it around there, but if it was lower, they would probably lose money, due to everyone just buying the infinite copy."
PokemonShuffle,36otag,TJ1524,3,Thu May 21 02:53:39 2015 UTC,"This game is better than Trozei, but it really isn't up to the quality of P&D.  People would buy it for $15 or more now after playing it so long, but I think very few people would have splurged $15 to buy it after a short demo. $15 might be a fair price for infinite hearts, but the coin grinding is still a problem. If it gave coins as well, that would give too much of an advantage in competitions.  And yes, no matter what price they charge for any sort of ""unlocked"" version, they stand to lose money by having fewer microtransactions. In this case, they are best off doing what they are doing now, even if not all the players are happy."

But since I'm not, I don't need to worry about that.   The game as it is right now is designed to have players coming back each day or each week for subsequent updates. People grind meowth to have the resources for these updates. But if it were a full length one-time purchase game, that obviously necessitate change to the coin/jewel system to make it worth the purchase price. With the right tweaks and add-ons, there are plenty of ways this would be a worthy but not as worthy as FE/MH4U, of course 3DS game."

I personally think Shuffle's transactions don't give you enough for what you pay, and I'm okay with grinding, but if you have money that's your choice what to spend it on."
PokemonShuffle,36otag,icravedanger,11,Thu May 21 02:48:43 2015 UTC,"I think people have a problem because of the extension of the idea.  In a sense, much of the game is about grinding. Imagine if there was some option where you could spend $100 to instantly earn ""game over"" and win the game and unlock everything and S-rank everything.   Would you do it?  I mean, think about how many hours of grinding it would save you. I've already played over 100 hours so that would actually be a great deal, wouldn't it?  No really, right? I mean the point of this particular game is to enjoy the journey (the grind, really), not to get to the finish line.   The philosophy of gaming itself gets pretty murky when you turn gameplay into a such a boring chore that you need cash to skip it.  At the rate new pokemon are being released it will be up to half a decade or more until all pokemon are released. This game hardly has an end in sight. So there's also the matter of how insane will be the amount of money we will end up spending if we play it to the end. Drop $10 a month for 5 years? Choose between that or real life time ""wasted"".   Now you're beginning to see the dilemma and the problem most people had with this new freemium model in the first place."
PokemonShuffle,36otag,butthead,2,Thu May 21 04:09:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think people should ever tell others how to spend their money, especially when they are fully aware of what they are buying.  I have qualms myself with this freemium model. It's like Candy Crush but more crude. And I can also see how costly it can be to toss money at the game every time you need assistance.  But by grinding I mean playing the Meowth level over and over every time you get some hearts. This is not an enriching experience, unlike grinding in RPGs, or compared to attempting a difficult level 20 times in order to beat it or get the capture. This is just for coins, since I consider level grinding largely pointless and unnecessary. Obviously nobody would pay to have the entire game completed for them, because they don't get to have any fun catching Pokemon or experiencing the challenge in each level. They are only paying for the privilege of not playing a single level over and over until their coin count builds up. And let's not forget that it is the paying customers who foot the bill so that we may enjoy the game for free. They're the last people whose behavior you should be criticizing, lest there be no more new Shuffles for anybody."

PokemonShuffle,36otag,butthead,2,Thu May 21 05:41:59 2015 UTC,I don't get it. Great ball saves coins and/or hearts by spending coins. Just like how you can save time and/or money by spending money. Mull over that one.
PokemonShuffle,36otag,icravedanger,0,Thu May 21 06:26:10 2015 UTC,"Except you're not saving money, you're spending more. Unless you count impatience as a cost, which I guess it is considering this game is designed to make you either bored or impatient unless you pay."
PokemonShuffle,36otag,butthead,4,Thu May 21 07:03:14 2015 UTC,"You only spend money on a great ball if you can't duplicate your performance on that level without spending a lot more than the cost of the great ball. Like if you spend 8k and get regirock to a 30% catch and miss, it makes more sense to use a great ball rather than let him get away."

If you buy 💎 then you are supporting the F2P model, however if you don't buy 💎 then you aren't a player that the developers will take into consideration when designing future titles.  With F2P games the small percentage of whales spend the largest percentage of cash so they also hold all the pulling power in terms of developers catering to them.

PokemonShuffle,36otag,Ekint,1 point,Fri May 22 18:43:19 2015 UTC,"But how late did you start? because I have no need for gems, is like, I dont even Meowth, I go to Buneary stage and just train Pokes the whole day, with this and register I have 23000 coins and still a lot of time until next stages coming (I did the last ones with 55000 coins I got the same way).  But anyways, If that makes you enjoy the game, nice, just be careful and dont be  an idiot like me that wasted around 250 euros for skins (Different suits) in the game League of Legends, Im so dumb."
PokemonShuffle,36otag,MetaThPr4h,1 point,Thu May 21 04:43:10 2015 UTC,Why do you train them on Buneary stage and not Ampharos?
PokemonShuffle,36otag,Chance_Lo,1 point,Fri May 22 09:20:44 2015 UTC,Nothing else than laziness honestly

PokemonShuffle,36otag,Fenor,0,Thu May 21 08:39:24 2015 UTC,"oh i nearly have everything, caughting stuff isnt the issue, it's the s-ranking that gets me."

PokemonShuffle,36nu8d,leoxyz,11,Wed May 20 19:11:43 2015 UTC,I'd love to be able to hold L or R to quickly scroll through my pokemon... It'd make things a lot more convenient.
PokemonShuffle,36nu8d,WolfHeroEX,3,Thu May 21 04:41:26 2015 UTC,"Actually, if the API for 3DS games is properly written this should be a matter of a few lines to change it - they can probably do this any time they want. In the off chance that their technical debt is through the roof... then it might be practically impossible."
PokemonShuffle,36nu8d,Loreinatoredor,2,Wed May 20 20:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's why programming patterns exist, right? xD  The most they would have to program would be calling some interface methods already coded, assuming the 3DS itself can simplify button events."
PokemonShuffle,36nu8d,Loreinatoredor,2,Wed May 20 21:26:15 2015 UTC,"Yup, but if they were on a tight schedule they might have... skipped some steps to push it out before it was cleanly done."

PokemonShuffle,36mmnf,ItsAlkron,3,Wed May 20 14:58:35 2015 UTC,I wasn't necessarily trying to get low but I entered for the jewel. Got like 8800 and I'm still ranked like the top 7500. Hopefully my crap score doesn't steal a mega stone from someone.
PokemonShuffle,36mmnf,Porkpants81,2,Wed May 20 16:36:22 2015 UTC,Thought your sub-par attempt resulted in a 3300-ish score. You tried again?
PokemonShuffle,36mmnf,icravedanger,1 point,Wed May 20 17:19:31 2015 UTC,No I was ranked 3300-ish after the one attempt
PokemonShuffle,36mmnf,Porkpants81,3,Wed May 20 17:21:59 2015 UTC,Oh I misread. Your score is actually quite high without items. I think it will be top 30k.
PokemonShuffle,36mmnf,icravedanger,2,Wed May 20 17:24:33 2015 UTC,"I do feel bad since I don't really need the extra jewel, I wasn't even thinking about selecting a non-optimized team.  I just played it once to enter. Oh well, my apologies to whoever is ranked 30,001"
PokemonShuffle,36mmnf,Porkpants81,2,Wed May 20 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"For all we know, Lucarionite might come back again. And I believe that anyone who spends 1500 or 2000 coins can get in the top 30,000. However, the dangerous but easy assumption to make is that everyone has super effective Mons with 70-90 attack, and that's clearly not the case. For example, I don't think more than a quarter of the competitors have Xerneas."
PokemonShuffle,36mmnf,icravedanger,2,Wed May 20 18:09:26 2015 UTC,I don't even have Xerneas yet....I have the level unlocked but I've been more focused on S-ranking the regular stages that I haven't really tried too many times on the timed ones.
PokemonShuffle,36mmnf,Porkpants81,2,Wed May 20 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"I did this too, hopefully if Blastoisite event repeat the people who gets them let me have a chance :D"
PokemonShuffle,36mmnf,Houeclipse,2,Wed May 20 17:38:41 2015 UTC,Do you guys think 17868 points will hold up within the top 30000?  Or do I need to spend some coins on M-Lucario?  I really don't want to miss out on the mega stone this time :/
PokemonShuffle,36mmnf,Boltbeam,2,Thu May 21 04:49:30 2015 UTC,That'll be fine.
PokemonShuffle,36mmnf,Hobocannibal,1 point,Thu May 21 11:22:27 2015 UTC,I was thinking this would be a cool little contest to have just for fun. I still need Lucarionite though. Maybe if M-Blastoise comes around again.

PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,butthead,2,Wed May 20 10:05:55 2015 UTC,I S-Ranked it the first time with 7511 but caught it with an A rank the second time.
PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,Lunick,1 point,Wed May 20 10:16:44 2015 UTC,So there isn't really a reason to S-rank special stage other than bragging rights?
PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,Infinitedaw,2,Wed May 20 16:19:02 2015 UTC,"As of now that is correct.   The game doesn't appear to keep track of special stage rankings at all. For example, when a special stage character makes a return after a hiatus, the rank is reset.   It's possible that a general tally is kept somewhere in the game's memory, but that remains to be seen."
PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,butthead,1 point,Wed May 20 17:28:58 2015 UTC,"It's not specifically after a hiatus but when the game updates the Special area of the game, it just wipes it all which sucks I guess. I wish I knew that when I first started Shuffle so I didn't have to S rank the Rotom lol."
PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,Lunick,8,Thu May 21 05:50:09 2015 UTC,"The level itself is not hard, but you might need some luck to save moves. The catch rate is what can really screw people over. With M Gengar it seems that I can usually complete the level in 2 or 3 moves.  Shuckle is a bug type with 60 attack and Risk-Taker (random increase or decrease)."
PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,Chance_Lo,1 point,Wed May 20 06:15:19 2015 UTC,"Mega Gengar did the trick for me, thanks. I then used two great balls; I was ready to start over but 6500 coins seemed reasonable to me. Now back to Meowth."

PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,Fenor,4,Wed May 20 07:24:03 2015 UTC,you should have used the home button trick for the g-ball
PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,Sanceston,1 point,Wed May 20 09:23:58 2015 UTC,Completely forgot about it. Thanks. I'll save up for another and use that. Should half the time it takes to catch.
PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,HelloHerroHewwo,1 point,Wed May 20 11:13:01 2015 UTC,What is the home button trick for great ball?
PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,leoxyz,5,Wed May 20 13:05:49 2015 UTC,"If you close the game before the ""return to map"" is pressed (after trying to catch the Pokemon), it will not record the fact you spent coins on great balls."
PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,CellarDweller1980,2,Wed May 20 13:51:51 2015 UTC,"Wow so basically you can always use Great Balls for free? Isn't this an exploit to get all catch meters to ""max"" or does the trick stop after 1 ball?"
PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,Hobocannibal,3,Thu May 21 08:35:28 2015 UTC,"You just throw more great balls at 2.5k each, it doesn't go up to ultra balls or anything like that.  It just means that if you throw great balls and fail to catch, you can get that part of your money back. You still use the hearts and any money spent on items."
PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,Infinitedaw,1 point,Thu May 21 11:11:01 2015 UTC,"Use the great ball, if the pokemon escapes use shutdown/home button to quit the game. You'll get the money back for the great ball (2500) but you will lose any money spent on items and the heart used."

PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,beakpaste,3,Wed May 20 08:11:40 2015 UTC,"Ick, threw like 5 greatballs on one attempt and made a bunch more without any and still didn't get it. I guess this is payback for catching Girafarig and Kecleon on the first try."
PokemonShuffle,36ld5u,butthead,3,Wed May 20 08:09:32 2015 UTC,"Why would you use a single great ball on shuckle, let alone 5? Are you rich or something?"

I've beaten the level 3 or 4 times with only 1 move so I had the max possible chance a few times....it's just frustrating

PokemonShuffle,36ilr5,ElementUser,8,Tue May 19 17:37:30 2015 UTC,"Normal pokemon are only useful if they have a Mega form, IMO. Their abilities are usually not anything special to make them stand out.  Even then, most Normal pokemon are replaced by better megas (speed: Gengar, power: everything else). Surprisingly, Mega Audino is still useful when I need fast area clears that clears non-self blocks, but I've only used Mega Audino like twice ever since I got past stage 130. Still, niche usefulness still has a place."
PokemonShuffle,36ilr5,thehintguy,7,Tue May 19 17:53:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. Most Normal types are replaced by other types with better powers. That said, they do offer a few unique benefits:   M-Audino evolves very quickly, and is great for stages with few moves but numerous disruptions. M-Lopunny can clear out columns of Pokemon better than anybunny. M-Kangaskhan does the same, but with rows.   There may come a time when these niche skills prove useful.  After all, before the latest set of Main stages, it seemed M-Aerodactyl was all but worthless. With Steelix under his belt, ain't nobody laughin' at M-Aero now. So the Normal Megas may have their time in the spotlight sooner or later."
PokemonShuffle,36ilr5,TrainerRedstone7,8,Tue May 19 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"M-Lucario pretty much replaces M-Lopunny, though, since it has better power and typing. With the new Lucario event, a lot more people will have access to it."

PokemonShuffle,36ilr5,Fenor,1 point,Tue May 19 19:39:17 2015 UTC,audino lopunny and kanga are useful for the levels immediatly after you get them.... 2 or 3 stages...

PokemonShuffle,36ilr5,Infinitedaw,2,Tue May 19 19:08:46 2015 UTC,But none of them are really strong or have a good ability. So its just the mega that could be arguable worth using.

PokemonShuffle,36ilr5,cyberscythe,1 point,Wed May 20 15:24:18 2015 UTC,"Since you walk into each battle knowing who your opponent is,  you can always type-match against it.   Normal could be a safe-ish hedge bet if you were facing a random opponent like with the Safari Zone. Otherwise the only way they can differentiate is special abilities or super huge attack scores."
PokemonShuffle,36ilr5,oranoran,-7,Thu May 21 21:12:17 2015 UTC,"This is how pokemon has always been - some pokemon are simply better than others.  I think this feels weird because it is a clash of worldviews. To the Japanese its not weird that some pokemon just suck and are worthless for battle. There was this news article a few years ago about how people of non-Japanese descent were barred from running in highschool intermural races. (I can't find it now... if someone could) To the Japanese this makes sense - ""Japanese are just genetically worse runners than Kenyans. We know they will win, so why race them against each other?"" But in my mind I think its just butthurt parents trying to make their kids win and the justification is just bs. Similarly, many Japanese will tell you with a straight face that there is something within the Japanese genetics that makes it possible for them to learn Japanese, explaining why so many foreigners struggle with the language."

PokemonShuffle,36hxie,Amish_Thunder,1 point,Tue May 19 15:44:36 2015 UTC,Lately I've been using my hearts during the day to grind Buneary (level 21) to gain levels. The only way I caught regirock was by getting my dudes to level 8-10 and using powerups. After that it wasn't too difficult. Beyond grinding I don't know what will help considering we both have a small amount of available choices (late start).
PokemonShuffle,36hxie,mr_sporb,1 point,Tue May 19 18:13:21 2015 UTC,That's a pretty high level. Mind me asking how long it took you to get to that level?
PokemonShuffle,36hxie,mr_sporb,1 point,Tue May 19 19:40:22 2015 UTC,It takes a couple days of grinding to get the 4 around those levels. I use all hearts on buneary with the same guys.
PokemonShuffle,36ggyc,treecko4ubers,9,Tue May 19 05:04:37 2015 UTC,"Mewtwo suffers a bit in normal gameplay since his Mega takes a relatively long time to activate and unlike Gengar and Slowbro, is contingent of having a lot of another mon and having few of himself. That means sacrificing damage not matching the target mon and often weak turns used to activate. SlowBro you can just do at your own pace, and if you happen to have a lot and activate then goodbye screen. Neither of them deal with disruptions especially well, but Slowbro is definitely better here since M2 does basically nothing. Also, you need another Psychic type of which there's only 60s rolling around...  In the competition however, its a relatively clear board with weak disruptions and people are likely to use Mega Start to avoid his activation Flaw. You want a ridiculous score? Mewtwo, Slowbro, Xernes, Snubull. You probably don't need DD, but just go ahead and get everything (total 12500, a bit pricey, but you will only need to do this once). Activate Mewtwo whenever you can, that's probably 800 base + tons of combos. If no Mewtwos or very few Slowbros match any 4-5 snubbull = another 700-800. I did this and got 37k, top 30."
PokemonShuffle,36ggyc,Rez91,3,Tue May 19 06:36:05 2015 UTC,"Well, as of now, the top 5 NA places all have Mega-Mewtwo, Slowbro, and Xerneas. The fourth slot varies between the top 5, but it's always a psychic type. I think the strategy is to proc Mega-Mewtwo and weed out the two other psychic types. That leaves behind a bunch of Xerneas to combo off and deal more damage.  The problem with Mega-Slowbro is that he's more of a one-shot guy. He's great for a giant combo to finish a level or wipe out a bunch of obstacles above him, but after you pull the trigger on him, he has a bit of a recharge time before he can go off again. And in the Mega-Lucario event, 1) you're playing all 20 turns regardless of how much damage you deal, and 2) you're probably using Disruption Delay to prevent obstacles.   Mega-Mewtwo, on the other hand, will pretty much always start a combo whenever you simply match 3 of him. Proc'ing him will clear out either all the Slowbros or all the 4th slot pokemon. Combine that with a Complexity -1 and a Disruption Delay'd board, and you're probably going to end up with at least a 10+ combo."
PokemonShuffle,36ggyc,pineapplesauce,2,Tue May 19 06:21:11 2015 UTC,Mega mewtwo can only delete one set of pokemon. If you have to psychic pokemon it will choose one of them.
PokemonShuffle,36ggyc,Ekint,2,Tue May 19 06:51:37 2015 UTC,That's correct. It will randomly choose one of the other psychic types on the board and clean it out (or get close). I don't think I said otherwise in my first comment. The main benefit of having two different psychic types is that you can trigger Mega-Mewtwo twice in a row and both times clear quite a few tiles. That will happen a lot if you're comboing off.
PokemonShuffle,36ggyc,pineapplesauce,1 point,Tue May 19 07:23:46 2015 UTC,Is Mega Mewtwo easier to use with the HOME button trick maybe??
PokemonShuffle,36ggyc,TSPhoenix,1 point,Fri May 22 04:44:44 2015 UTC,Not in this case because it's turn based and not timed. You can take your time thinking about your move unlike the timed expert stages
PokemonShuffle,36ggyc,Drkdragonz66,1 point,Sun May 24 03:55:38 2015 UTC,Oh I hadn't actually tried it yet when I posted. I managed to place bottom 500 to make sure someone else has a shot.
PokemonShuffle,36ggyc,TSPhoenix,1 point,Sun May 24 09:09:56 2015 UTC,"I personally have never found success with Mega Slowbro ever. I just never got good chains with the ""extra"" slowbro that gets added in.  With a psychic type Slowbro on the team, Mewtwo Y's ability kind of kicks ass, at least in my experience. It clears out the Slowbros and Mewtwos and leaves me with a bunch of the remaining two on my team and I always get really good cascades with it, on top of the fact that Mewtwo Y's pure damage is just straight up ridiculous.   I didn't know people hated on Mewtwo Y but i dunno I'm a big fan of him I tend to generally be really successful with it so it's gotta mean its got a good effect"
PokemonShuffle,36ggyc,Vinylzen,2,Tue May 19 06:00:08 2015 UTC,Mega mewtwo doesnt clear itself.
PokemonShuffle,36ggyc,Ekint,2,Tue May 19 06:50:26 2015 UTC,"Mega Slowbro is best when you have a bunch near the bottom in a roughly horizontal layout. Your triggering play should be near the top, and cause at least one more Slowbro to trigger. This will cause every other single Slowbro to become at least a match 3, if not 4-6 if there are any above them."
PokemonShuffle,36g7az,Rimefang,3,Tue May 19 03:29:41 2015 UTC,"mawile felt pretty weak (62 power) and his mega move didnt help.

PokemonShuffle,36g7az,DISKFIGHTER2,2,Tue May 19 04:54:42 2015 UTC,"Gengar's catch rate is still gonna be pretty shitty, but I had use a DD on him to be able to have any decent number of turns leftover.

I think i'm around 80 right now. You could also just grind on Buneary or Ampharos. If you wanna get it done asap would say go for Zoroark because that's probably easier than gengar and then save up for a disruption delay and a move+5 on mega gengar, i just hate saving up coins and grinding, at least with getting S-ranks i feel like im making more progress ya know?"

PokemonShuffle,36clcb,Disgruntled__Goat,4,Mon May 18 16:56:53 2015 UTC,And what if I'm a cheap bastard and want two jewels?
PokemonShuffle,36clcb,HeroofTime55,-8,Mon May 18 14:49:35 2015 UTC,"I also want the two jewels.  With the recent confirmation that you no longer get street pass jewels after 9999 tags, jewels are now a limited resource (since paying for them is silly).  I don't feel bad about that.  It's a competition, it's supposed to be hard.  And you'll get in the top 30k if you're really determined anyway.  But on the other hand, it's not the most pressing need for coins, so I probably won't spend coins on it.  Gotta save them in the back pocket in case I actually need them, like for the new daily stages for instance.  So I might not make the 30k mark at the end of the day."
PokemonShuffle,36clcb,icravedanger,6,Mon May 18 15:55:21 2015 UTC,"Jewels buy coins and hearts, which are not a limited resource. If you grind Meowth and wait for hearts, you have no need for jewels at all. And what would you do with 100 jewels?"
PokemonShuffle,36clcb,He_Himself,1 point,Tue May 19 05:10:50 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, jewels could have a decent impact on current and future EX stages.  The time allotment that they buy back goes towards catch rate, so you get 5x 3-sec increments back if you spend a jewel.  Match that with a ridiculously short EX stage like Blaziken and you have a solid reason to choose the second jewel."
PokemonShuffle,36clcb,icravedanger,1 point,Wed May 20 20:37:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you were in that specific situation with 1 jewel. But you should have more than 1 jewel. Unless you spent them on hearts and coins, which brings the argument back full circle."
PokemonShuffle,36clcb,He_Himself,1 point,Wed May 20 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"The mega-stone contests are great at pressuring new players to cash out of their guaranteed jewels.  I don't think many people still have the dozen or so freebies.  And spending a jewel in the scenario I gave doesn't guarantee a capture, so there is potential for waste."
PokemonShuffle,36clcb,icravedanger,0,Wed May 20 20:52:38 2015 UTC,Which still translates into 3-4k coins per jewel. Getting an extra jewel is an extra 3-4k coins basically. And can you keep using jewels until the level is finished? I'm not sure on that.
PokemonShuffle,36clcb,He_Himself,1 point,Wed May 20 20:56:25 2015 UTC,"I don't get why you keep trying to pull this argument back around to coins.  Jewels have a totally viable use in the EX stages where every second counts, and there's no way to buy that effect with coins."
PokemonShuffle,36clcb,icravedanger,0,Wed May 20 21:10:25 2015 UTC,"Other than spending 800 coins at the beginning. My point is that a jewel is used to buy coins. Your point is that the jewel is used on EX stages, and when I asked where the spare jewels went, you admitted that they were used to buy coins."
PokemonShuffle,36clcb,He_Himself,1 point,Wed May 20 21:26:56 2015 UTC,"The 800 coin time boost doesn't add to the capture rate.  It only counts towards rank.  So if you finish inside of that extra time, it's a 1% catch rate regardless of the time on the clock.        My point is that many players, regardless of how good they are, have used at least some of their default jewels by this point.  Rotating events and contests probably contributed to that.  So opportunities to snag an extra free jewel are valuable to them, especially considering the late-game use in EX stages."
PokemonShuffle,36clcb,HeroofTime55,1 point,Wed May 20 21:33:58 2015 UTC,"Have them sit there maxed out and feel proud when I look at all 100 of them, for the most part.  Though they also serve as an emergency reserve if a particularly tough stage comes up."
PokemonShuffle,36clcb,icravedanger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:42:52 2015 UTC,"But having them maxed limits your ability to get more, which means any extras go to waste."

PokemonShuffle,36clcb,Disgruntled__Goat,6,Sun Jul 12 08:33:12 2015 UTC,"Clearly it's a complete waste of coins. Why would you spend a bunch of coins just to get (probably less) coins back?  All the previous competitions have been dead easy to make the cut (and in EU there are 5,000 more places this time), so if someone doesn't make it, they don't deserve it.  I'm gonna give it a few goes, my Pokemon are decently levelled so it should be easier than usual. But if I only get one jewel, whatever."

Base catch rate of 3% with 2% per turn means you have a negligible chance of catching him that way. Hence using a bunch of coins at once to do it.

I tend to be a late adopter, it helped me avoid the Lumiose City glitch in Pokemon X, but hurt me in Pokemon Shuffle, because I did NOT foresee limited time events that I missed (Lucarionite, Mew, Kyogre).

PokemonShuffle,36cx8p,icravedanger,1 point,Mon May 18 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Mega Gengar is a key to keeping a combo going in those stages, other Megas work but not nearly as well."
PokemonShuffle,36cx8p,Chance_Lo,1 point,Mon May 18 17:15:34 2015 UTC,I tried it and liked it. But Banette with Banette is still the king of carnage.
PokemonShuffle,36cx8p,Chance_Lo,3,Tue May 19 06:45:31 2015 UTC,"With those hearts you spend on Banette, you should farm Meowth instead. With the coins you earn, buy yourself a Complexity -1 and rollface those insanely hard stages :p"
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,RagingHadouken,15,Mon May 18 06:01:19 2015 UTC,"I went on a rush and didnt even notice the Mega Lucario competition is now with a number of moves (20), not seconds, haha.  Edit: Girafarig Psychic, 7 moves, starts with a few wooden blocks, less than 3455 HP, capture rate: 8% + 4% * moves left"
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,leoxyz,11,Mon May 18 06:09:02 2015 UTC,"Me too. I was super confused when I couldn't move between actions. Still managed to get 10745 points with about 14/500 placing despite wasting the first three moves.  The amount of winners has been increased, probably because the people with Lucarionites would otherwise hog most of the rankings in their greedy gem hunt."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,MegaMissingno,3,Mon May 18 06:18:46 2015 UTC,"May I ask what pokemon (and items, if any) did you use?"
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,SarcasticEmbodyment,2,Mon May 18 06:22:57 2015 UTC,"M-Slowbro, Xerneas, Mewtwo and Azumarill. Everyone level maxed except Azu who's level 5. No items yet."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,MegaMissingno,1 point,Mon May 18 07:22:24 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks!"
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,SarcasticEmbodyment,1 point,Mon May 18 07:27:20 2015 UTC,How do you max pokemon that fast? My strongest pokemon is lucario lvl8
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,Ekint,2,Mon May 18 10:19:25 2015 UTC,I've done everything else in the game so I just play the Ampharos level to get loads of exp on my best pokémon.
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,MegaMissingno,6,Mon May 18 11:39:56 2015 UTC,Looks like people can't use the Home Button trick anymore... and now they can use Shuffle Move instead!
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,MayorOfChuville,1 point,Mon May 18 07:02:19 2015 UTC,"Where did you get the HP from? It doesn't show you that in game, right?"
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,Disgruntled__Goat,1 point,Mon May 18 14:50:51 2015 UTC,"I just wrote it down after it fainted. The score is actually based on the Pokémon's HP. So if I scored 3455 (before the remaining moves bonus are added), it means a damage of 3455 is enough to knock it out. It's useful to know that information if you know how damages are calculated, so you can decide if you try a possible move or not."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,leoxyz,1 point,Mon May 18 16:17:05 2015 UTC,"I'm out of hearts for the next 20 minutes so I can't check, but are you saying that the score (before move bonuses) is a direct measure of damage dealt? Does it value combos more or is it simply a tabulation of match damages?"
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,tabularaja,1 point,Mon May 18 21:43:15 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. And both options are true, haha. Combos and skill bonuses actually do more damage (there's a slight multiplier for 2-combo, 5-combo, and so on increases), and that's why they get you more score.  If you grind a lot against Meowth you might have noticed it's always defeated when your score is just under 1200 (or, Ampharos where it is 15k-something).  The only actual ways to get higher scores on HP-based (non-competition) stages is through the moves (or seconds) left when you get them to 0HP. And through further combos that keep happening even though the Pokémon was defeated.  (Sorry if that wasn't clear, I got myself confused just by trying to explain)"
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,leoxyz,13,Mon May 18 23:46:55 2015 UTC,"Since I already have Lucarionite, I'm probably not going to participate in the event again. Save a spot on the leaderboard for those who need it.  They've also upped the number for us in Europe & Oceania too. 15,000 now. That's up from 10k for Mega Blastoise and Mega Banette, but actually down from the last Mega Lucario event which was 20k I believe."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,TommoPuppy,8,Mon May 18 06:40:46 2015 UTC,I'm glad there are players like you. I have won all the Mega Stones so far except for the Lucarionite since it came out when I was basically just beginning. I think I will sit out too when they start bringing back the ones I have already won. That or I will just play once and get a bad score on purpose so that I can still get the free crystal just for participating.
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,Exodiafinder687,6,Mon May 18 07:04:48 2015 UTC,"Same here  I do think they should have a seperate scoreboard though - Those with Lucarionite already should be on anothee board, with the top, say, 200 getting two gems. Or five, ten, whatever"
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,Wild_Shiny_Eevee,6,Mon May 18 08:02:58 2015 UTC,"one run without item just to ensure the gem, let the stone to those who don't have it."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,Fenor,5,Mon May 18 09:10:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah that occurred to me after I had made the comment. I could just take in a bunch of weak Pokémon to make sure I don't get the Mega Stone, too."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,TommoPuppy,3,Mon May 18 09:13:38 2015 UTC,Yeah we can take all non effectives
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,Ekint,6,Mon May 18 10:21:23 2015 UTC,"EU has fewer Lucarionite winners than last time, but NA has more. Last time, there were twice as many NA participants as EU participants. So roughly 20% of EU ranked players received the stone, while 10% of NA ranked players did.  But overall, it is likely that half of those 15k or 30k people will receive 2 gems instead."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,icravedanger,2,Mon May 18 06:57:26 2015 UTC,Out of interest how many players roughly participated in the blastoise event from NA?
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,pagit85,3,Mon May 18 13:50:00 2015 UTC,THank you for this. Ill be doing the same if some competition repeats in the future.
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,Ekint,2,Mon May 18 10:20:34 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, so do us Lucarionite owners HAVE to participate in the comp and purposely get a bad score to get that jewel, or can we just sit back and sit out from it altogether?"
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,Vinylzen,2,Mon May 18 17:53:02 2015 UTC,"Nah, if you want a jewel, you have to participate."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,TommoPuppy,3,Mon May 18 18:18:01 2015 UTC,"burning through hearts like crazy on the Girafarig stage, damn thing won't catch. at least the stage is easy i guess."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,andersma,4,Mon May 18 14:45:12 2015 UTC,Seriously! I even beat it in one turn and didn't catch it. It always goes to the third shake and he breaks out.
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,MasterWario,3,Mon May 18 15:18:00 2015 UTC,My game just REFUSES to catch anything anymore
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,raymogi,2,Mon May 18 15:42:28 2015 UTC,I sure am excited for Spiritomb! Here's hoping it has a good ability!
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,welshwuff,2,Mon May 18 08:11:01 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I have the chance to get the stone again.  Went on a rush too thinking it was a timed stage, luckily the combos kept on coming and ended up scoring 33k-ish. Ranked 32 as of now."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,icravedanger,1 point,Mon May 18 13:59:59 2015 UTC,"Shuckle was a real pain, it made me finally cave and buy coins. ahwell i did like 98% of the game without paying, spose its ok to show support for something ive been enjoying."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,Alucardnr,-2,Wed May 20 23:34:40 2015 UTC,"At least nobody can cheat this time, though coins and luck will be very important.  Actually, considering that a computer program could win this competition, and the significance of luck over skill, I don't think limited moves is the way to go.  Edit: If you don't want to spend at least 2000 coins (3500 preferably), don't even try."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,hitmonwhirl,6,Mon May 18 07:13:56 2015 UTC,Anybody checked top 1 in JP? This guy used Ditto and his score is 107479. I don't know how he did this but he must be cheating!
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,Alucardnr,1 point,Mon May 18 09:54:19 2015 UTC,"I don't remember Ditto being in this game, what's his ability?"
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,hitmonwhirl,4,Mon May 18 12:00:29 2015 UTC,"No idea about his ability. The point is Ditto doesn't available now but this guy just made it happen. Btw, his ranking has already been deleted."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,icravedanger,1 point,Mon May 18 14:03:25 2015 UTC,Busted by Nintendo. I really am hoping for Ditto soon. Love that little jelly.
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,andersma,1 point,Mon May 18 15:05:06 2015 UTC,I believe in freakish luck.
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,icravedanger,1 point,Mon May 18 16:52:44 2015 UTC,"Why shouldn't you try? I'm in the top 1000 after one try. I know that place won't last, but I don't see myself dropping 29,000 spots either."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,andersma,1 point,Mon May 18 17:27:46 2015 UTC,"What's your score? I don't think 7000-8000 will hold, though if enough people with Lucarionite sit out, I suppose it's possible."
PokemonShuffle,36caf9,icravedanger,1 point,Mon May 18 18:21:28 2015 UTC,"Around 9000. That was just one try though. After I finish last week's S Ranks, I'll try again"
PokemonShuffle,36d1od,Wattouat,3,Mon May 18 12:23:45 2015 UTC,I personally used no coins at all; however I used the home button trick and it worked wonders.
PokemonShuffle,36d1od,Chance_Lo,1 point,Mon May 18 15:51:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I tried to use it again today, it's just so frustrating to me, makes me spend so much time on the stage and I don't even win that often.. I think I'll end up using coins because my mons are already +5, grinding won't even be that useful in my case :("
PokemonShuffle,36d1od,Chance_Lo,3,Mon May 18 21:09:43 2015 UTC,"If you want some advice, here is how I use the home trick. If anyone wants to correct me, feel free: 1) Grab the Pokemon you want to move and push the home button right after it. 2) Press the home button again when you can, and right when you do, place the stylus at the place you want your Pokemon. 3) When the game starts again, your Pokemon should be hovering over the place you want it to be. Lift your stylus as soon as possible and press the home button again. 4) Try and find another Pokemon and start over.  If you can not see any move, press the home button several times to see better. Also, do not forget you can make moves EVEN IF you do not make a match."
PokemonShuffle,36d1od,tabularaja,1 point,Tue May 19 19:26:26 2015 UTC,"It seems slower using the homebutton, but it actually saves you time in the long run since the win rate is much higher with the hb"
PokemonShuffle,36d1od,digikari4691,1 point,Mon May 18 21:47:21 2015 UTC,"I'm currently aiming to S-rank these same stages (except Blaziken, already S-ranked) right now so I'll let you know my strategies as I accomplish this!"
PokemonShuffle,36d1od,digikari4691,1 point,Mon May 18 20:45:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you!! I'm curious though, why do you want to s-rank expert stages?"
PokemonShuffle,36d1od,digikari4691,1 point,Mon May 18 21:08:24 2015 UTC,"Just aiming for 100% completion :) But I also feel like there's a possibility somewhere down the line that S-ranking the expert stages will unlock some hidden stages - the same way expert stages are unlocked by S-ranking the main stages. If not, it's overall pretty rewarding and that's enough!"
PokemonShuffle,36d1od,bogaboy,1 point,Mon May 18 23:11:29 2015 UTC,"Having trouble S-ranking Xerneas still, but I was able to beat it with 14 seconds left and a team of M-Mawile (lv 7), Nidoking (lv 6), Nidoqueen (lv 6), and Bronzong (lv 5) and Mega Start. Having Mawile in Mega right off the back gets rid of almost all those ice blocks which will allow you to combo much easier starting from the very first minute"
PokemonShuffle,36d1od,Kotakia,3,Mon May 18 23:26:27 2015 UTC,"I did it with the same team, Mega Start and Complex-1. It's expensive, but I figure I'd rather spend the coins upfront, then spend money on only one power up and fail."
PokemonShuffle,36d1od,digikari4691,1 point,Tue May 19 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"Hmm, hadn't thought of that with mega start. I've been replacing mawile with steelix lately since the power difference is obscene. Will have to try that, Xerneas, Mewtwo, and Genesect are the only ones I've got left to catch."
PokemonShuffle,36d1od,Teengirl_fantasy,1 point,Wed May 20 14:59:48 2015 UTC,"Beat Yveltal with 33 seconds with my team M-Lucario (lv 9), Xerneas, Scizor (lv 8), Heracross (lv 8) and Mega Start, +10 seconds (but you can do without the +10 if you're still aiming to catch) I use M-Lucario to clear the smoke on the left 3 spaces as my first move and then the smoke on the right 3 spaces. Afterwards, just use M-Lucario when the smoke starts getting too much in one area, or opt for Disruption Delay!"
PokemonShuffle,36d1od,bogaboy,1 point,Mon May 18 23:29:39 2015 UTC,"So first of all i recommend doing the stages in order as each of them helps you catch the next one. So in general for these expert stages you want to be constantly matching to build up good combos, so make sure your pokemon look different, makes it much easier to see what can be moved. In addition, when i was capturing these pokemon, most of the time my catch rates would be super low (especially mewtwo), so it took many attempts to finally catch them. If you are gonna use great balls, save them till you get a decent catch %.  In terms of specifics:  Xerneas - think i just optimised my team and used mega mawile, bronzong, nidoqueen and nidoking. Might have swapped one out for klefki, can't recall. Clear the ice towards the top before the bottom.  Yveltal - mega ampharos (for clouds), xerneas, any 2 of lucario/scyther/scizor. Mega evolve ampharos asap and clear the clouds.  Mewtwo - hardest of the 3. I used mega gengar, yveltal, scizor and scyther. Clear ice whenever it appears, you have to just be really fast matching for this stage.  Have not unlocked genesect yet. As I've said, the catch rates are low, so once you start beating them you'll still need many attempts to catch them unless get lucky. Hope this helps!"
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,RagingHadouken,17,Mon May 18 06:31:09 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that they brought it back because I wasn't even aware of Shuffle when they had the Lucarionite competition, so I started late. This will help me catch up. To me, the whole point of this game is to catch all the Pokemon, and I don't really mind that the stones are less exclusive. It's nice that they give everyone a chance to get the event Pokemon instead of trying to sell them as in app purchases."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,dfhz,7,Mon May 18 06:40:19 2015 UTC,"People will still try hard. Even if they sit out this competition, they will stay alert for future ones.  Shuffle does what it can to help out new players. It has brought back Lucarionite, Rotom forms, and released new main stages very slowly. This is not exciting for long-time players, but we have to understand what it feels like to start this game at the beginning and be overwhelmed by everything that is happening and has happened."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,icravedanger,4,Mon May 18 07:07:28 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I haven't missed any events so far and I'm pretty excited that they're bringing them back. Partly because it means if I miss any future events then I'm not losing my chance for completion, and partly because I've missed out on enough exclusive things in various games to not want that to happen to anyone else. I hate when things are exclusive - I either feel bad because I can't get them, or guilty because I got them and other people can't."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,Holly164,6,Mon May 18 08:59:04 2015 UTC,"I started the game late so I'm glad they're giving me another chance to get it. Just hope I can make top 30k, I don't have Mewtwo or Xerneas yet and I could only get 10.5k ish points on my first try."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,ArisaMiyoshi,1 point,Mon May 18 06:57:46 2015 UTC,"Slowbro, Azumarill, Chatot, and Slurpuff or whatever is what I got it with when I started playing the week that competition went live. You can do it!"
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,Kotakia,7,Mon May 18 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"I already won it so I'm sitting out so others can get my favorite Mega. It is, however, heavily biased towards spending coins to get an almost surefire position at the top. Obviously to, ahem, encourage acquiring jewels, but all the same rich players have blatant advantages to poor ones."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,DBrody6,3,Mon May 18 06:54:20 2015 UTC,"I already won it so I'm sitting out so others can get my favorite Mega.    Dont sit out, just play really bad. You get 2 jewels! No, you don't, you only get 1 jewel. Whoops."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,legomaple,6,Mon May 18 08:52:10 2015 UTC,"I meant sitting out from getting into the top 30K. I'm still picking up that free jewel (with a gloriously crap score of 6500), but I don't want to swipe a spot and steal the Lucarionite from what would be an unlucky 30001th place finisher."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,DBrody6,2,Mon May 18 08:55:08 2015 UTC,"Rich players can play it many times, but poor players who earned at least 3500 coins can play it once and place in the top 15/30k. Everything else I completely agree with."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,icravedanger,3,Mon May 18 07:27:42 2015 UTC,"The Complexity -1 is such an interesting item. I only played the stage once for the jewel, and I gotta say those Riolu as just as bad as any other garbage 5th support Pokemon that regular Mega stages force upon you. I say interesting because I personally feel that item alone boosts your score more than the other two items. I wish there were a way to discover average scores of players who use no items, some items, and all 3 items. Something to get a gauge of where the bottom 30K line is. I wouldn't call it fair to say the MS+DD is enough for newer players to easily place...when everyone has access to those items easily, the bottom line is gonna shift to match. The real question to me is what percentage of players are willing to use a -1."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,DBrody6,3,Mon May 18 07:34:26 2015 UTC,"True, I agree. 3500 coins may not make you place, but given that 30,000 people will place, I don't think they are all going to use C-1. The only thing I am willing to state outright is that spending 0 coins will give you almost no chance to place.  Most people who place will not have spent any money to do so. If you define rich in terms of actual currency, then I don't really think that rich players have a better chance. If you define rich as ""willing to spend 12500 coins"", then I agree."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,icravedanger,1 point,Mon May 18 07:54:20 2015 UTC,Its really easy to farm coins dude
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,Ekint,3,Mon May 18 10:23:39 2015 UTC,"To us, yeah. To the casual player? Not a damn chance. Nobody I know who plays this game has a degree of competency at farming Meowth. They're dirt poor and do little more than ram their heads at the Mega stages because they can't buy items to get past them faster."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,DBrody6,1 point,Mon May 18 10:27:11 2015 UTC,Whats stopping them from farming meowth? He is lvl 37 and you dont need any special pokemon to farm him.
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,Ekint,3,Mon May 18 10:38:32 2015 UTC,What's stopping them is a knack for puzzle games.
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,incredulousbear,3,Mon May 18 11:01:40 2015 UTC,"""Beating"" him is easy. It's the ""carefully managing his HP so you run out his disruption timer and can skillfully maneuver all the coins on the board into a single place"" part that they, and probably many others, find incredibly difficult."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,DBrody6,3,Mon May 18 18:19:09 2015 UTC,Do the people who already got the lucarionite count towards the classification?
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,Wrulfy,1 point,Mon May 18 07:15:23 2015 UTC,Yes
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,icravedanger,3,Mon May 18 07:24:28 2015 UTC,"I'm glad they did this because up until now it was uncertain whether or not you'd be able to catch them all just because you didn't get the game as soon as it came out. Since I already placed and got the mega stone last time, I played the stage once so I can get a mega stone for trying. Ended up with a 6,000 score so I should definitely be kicked down past 30,000 by the end of this competition. Good luck to everyone who didn't get it last time.  Edit: missed a zero"
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,RA0674,2,Mon May 18 08:25:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily say it's that much easier. A good chunk of the winners will most likely be those who already own Lucarionite and being based on turns instead of time rewards luck, not skill."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,MegaMissingno,1 point,Mon May 18 06:47:03 2015 UTC,". This will help me catch up. To me, the whole point of this game is to catch all the Pokemon, and I don't really mind that the stones are less exclusive. It's nice that they give everyone a chance to get the event Pokemon instead of trying to sell them as in app purchases.   At least there is no home button trick now lol."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,Chance_Lo,1 point,Mon May 18 14:56:53 2015 UTC,I prefer timed competitions even with (and because of) the home button trick due to the skill required to win instead of being forced to use coins or be lucky with the turn limit.
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,MegaMissingno,1 point,Mon May 18 15:15:32 2015 UTC,"Yes; I guess my point is that people who are not aware of the home button trick are doomed for ever :/ If they just deleted the home button trick then it would be more fair to me. But I agree, even with it, time based competitions have the advantages of not relying on money and luck."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,Chance_Lo,2,Mon May 18 15:32:55 2015 UTC,I think its a nice change to have a turn based event rather than an expert stage type one.
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,climb026,3,Mon May 18 07:08:13 2015 UTC,The problem with turn-based is that it is primarily luck-based and forces you to spend lots of coins. And you can use a computer program to basically win for you.  The good thing about it is the absence of the home button trick.
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,icravedanger,2,Mon May 18 07:26:29 2015 UTC,"I'm glad they bought it back. I already have Mega Lucario (and Mega Blastoise and Mega Banette) so you'd think I'd prefer a new Mega to play with, but I generally struggled so much to catch Regirock and if the inevitable Regice and Registeel are anywhere near as difficult to catch as that thing then I'm gonna want as much down time and as little distractions as possible in order to grind my Pokemon and save up coins in order to have a chance at getting them! Mega Lucario is really useful, too. You guys are gonna love him."

PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,giraffe196,1 point,Mon May 18 12:27:26 2015 UTC,"Panicked a little as I still hadn't caught Regirock but I just got him so I can spend this week trying to work on this one (yes, there's the new weeklies too but those can wait a little while). This is the only mega I haven't got so far and the inclusion of those who already have it in the leaderboard makes it notably harder (doing a bad performance for one gem is fine but two gems isn't worth someone else not getting the mega) but I managed the others so this should be doable."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,TenebrousEye,1 point,Mon May 18 12:45:59 2015 UTC,"Lucarionite is the only piece I'm missing from having everything in game, so I'm okay with it.  When the first event took place I was still new to the game and didn't have strong enough Pokemon.  Also, I'm sure that they changed the event to moves rather than time because of the Home button trick that people were using."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,johnsorci,1 point,Mon May 18 13:51:01 2015 UTC,I wonder if they only made a turn based event because they had already made a time based one for the Lucarionite.

PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,Wrulfy,1 point,Mon May 18 14:19:12 2015 UTC,Do I have to attempt the competition in order to get my jewel?  I already have Lucarionite and was wondering if I could just ignore the comp altogether and pick up my jewel later
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,Vinylzen,1 point,Mon May 18 17:45:14 2015 UTC,"You have to participate to get it, but if you don't want to get in the top scores just use a bad matchup to get a low score and still get a jewel."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,Progressive_Caveman,1 point,Mon May 18 21:42:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's really good for players who may not be as good on Timed stages as they are for Moves! Plus, I get a free jewel since I already got the lucarionite the first time."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,digikari4691,1 point,Mon May 18 19:56:45 2015 UTC,"I'm another one who missed the first Lucarionite competition, so I'm happy I get another shot at the stone, but I can see why those who won the first time around would feel like the value of their success has been diminished. What the game devs should have done imo is put out a different fighting mega/megastone (M-Meditite or something?). The reason M-Lucario becomes so valuable in the game is that it's the only one of that type available. If there were a different one too, I think it would make things more interesting, yet still give a somewhat equal playing field.  Anyway, I figured opportunities to get all the stones again would come eventually, but this is much sooner than I thought."
PokemonShuffle,36ccq9,beakpaste,1 point,Mon May 18 20:50:27 2015 UTC,I saw they changed it. I didn't win first time so hope I can get a better score this time.
PokemonShuffle,36caxh,kirby_j3,8,Mon May 18 06:07:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course. Fewer than 30,000 people will receive Lucarionite in the NA region. If you play for 2 gems, then someone else out there will miss out on a Lucarionite.   It is likely that after this competition, there will be just over 30,000 total Lucarionites in existence in NA. This assumes almost everybody who cared to compete for Lucarionite before are still competitive now."
PokemonShuffle,36caxh,icravedanger,1 point,Mon May 18 07:02:39 2015 UTC,How high do you have to get to get 2 gems?
PokemonShuffle,36caxh,galloots,2,Wed May 20 05:13:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know, 8000 maybe? I don't recommend going hard for 2 gems, it's better to let people who don't have the mega stone get it, and you still get 1 gem no matter what. It's only a 3000 coin difference."

PokemonShuffle,36caxh,02pheland,1 point,Mon May 18 07:44:50 2015 UTC,"Mega Lucario can be great depending on the stage, that's how I caught Regirock. You just have to know the layout, clearing columns helps immensely."

Kanga was better since she's way faster to mega (giving you more time to spend matching your super-effectives) and in two matches you can clear the screen of clouds, allowing you free reign of the board. Before this I literally had never beaten Yvetal; after I managed to finish and catch with :14 left.  Switch out Scyther for Scizor and you're set to go."
PokemonShuffle,36bzuo,ghostiest,1 point,Mon May 18 07:04:24 2015 UTC,"Why swap Scyther and Scizor? They have the same base power, and my Scyther is a higher level."

Heracross is better because Crowd Control procs a lot more reliably than Swarm, and Crowd Control typically does a lot more damage."
PokemonShuffle,36bzuo,themdreamers,1 point,Mon May 18 16:04:54 2015 UTC,"Scizor is likely to have a mega event in the future, so it would be a good idea in the long run to level up Scizor as well."

I use M-Lucario to clear the smoke on the left 3 spaces as my first move and then the smoke on the right 3 spaces.

PokemonShuffle,36ae4w,digikari4691,1 point,Mon May 18 17:02:01 2015 UTC,"It is, but if that split second is not enough, you can open the ""Game Notes"" app (pencil icon).

PokemonShuffle,369mhn,bogaboy,5,Sun May 17 15:04:02 2015 UTC,You should catch the expert Pokemon. These are pretty strong and should help considerably in the long run.
PokemonShuffle,369mhn,Hegarol,6,Sun May 17 16:48:48 2015 UTC,I would recommend   Get expert Pokemon Get coins to complete the S-Rank remaining pokemon Get coins for the next stages

I realised this weekend that my Ice types/Rock/Flying/Steel types and the Kanto starters were all still mostly level 1, so I figured getting a huge chunk of my caught Pokemon to level 5 would make S ranking remaining stages (and catching Genesect) a much easier task to accomplish."
PokemonShuffle,369mhn,Internutt,3,Sun May 17 22:27:23 2015 UTC,"Only one I can think of is for the stages where those pokemon are automatically added as non-support pokemon (e.g. Mega Mewtwo Y's stage adds Espeon) so they do an ever so slightly increased amount of damage.  Other than that, nope."
PokemonShuffle,369mhn,ElementUser,2,Mon May 18 17:31:36 2015 UTC,"Work on catching the pokemon in expert mode, they'll help you with getting the S ranks in normal stages afterwards which with the next big update will add more stages to S rank and most likely add another mega form and expert stage to unlock. So the best thing is to catch all you can and S rank the normals so you have less to do later once the next update drops."
PokemonShuffle,369mhn,trepvox,0,Wed May 20 18:42:45 2015 UTC,I'm trying to S-Rank all the main stages first. Then I will try to catch and S-Rank all the Expert stages. After that it's just replaying Snorlax's level to get all my Pokemon up to level 10.
PokemonShuffle,369mhn,Exodiafinder687,3,Sun May 17 19:43:44 2015 UTC,"Snorlax is too hard, just do Ampharos. You'll only be able to beat Snorlax with a team full of fighting Pokemon. It's not worth the 5 exp."
PokemonShuffle,369mhn,icravedanger,1 point,Sun May 17 22:12:15 2015 UTC,I have been trying Snorlax because he has more turns. You get the experience even if you don't beat the Pokemon.
PokemonShuffle,369mhn,Exodiafinder687,2,Mon May 18 07:30:03 2015 UTC,"Ampharos is still better. Beating Ampharos gives more experience than not beating Snorlax, no matter how close you get. Because 50 extra exp is given out to one Pokemon."

PokemonShuffle,36cie4,icravedanger,9,Mon May 18 07:51:53 2015 UTC,"S-Ranking stages is not something people enjoy. having something that might help is welcome, i use it from time to time. the last 10 stages i had them S-Ranked without it, still no problem with it. it give you a nice idea of some falling that takes place, but it's far from perfect. most of the time doing it manually is a better choice."
PokemonShuffle,36cie4,Fenor,4,Mon May 18 09:29:46 2015 UTC,"I use shuffle move because I find it interesting, especially because I can look at the code. I am studying to become a programmer and looking at everything I can is very important to me. I use it and sometimes it does a great job, and sometimes it's buggy. I like to try and think through the thought process and the code that was used in both shuffle move and the game itself to try and learn neat tricks I can apply somewhere else.  Does the computer program give the people using it an advantage? Sometimes. I have noticed when I know the pattern of the descending pokemon, I am better than shuffle move because I can abuse how they fall.  Also, when I know I need to push hard for a mega evolve, I will make matches of 3 of the pokemon I need instead of chaining 2 pokemon somewhere else, making me superior to the program.  If I need to push to S rank something and none of the above apply I will use the program, I don't like to spend coins S ranking things when perfect play will get me that rank. Hope this helps, sorry for text wall."
PokemonShuffle,36cie4,ocknon,2,Mon May 18 08:00:06 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're looking at the code and programming behind it, then you're a special case. I'm talking about people who don't care about programming, but really enjoy the game (not just a score-chaser).  The only thing it seems to actually do for you is help you if you need an S-rank and don't want to spend coins, but I doubt that it always comes through for you. And in the event that it does come through, I would maintain that you possibly could have achieved the same results yourself and be happier for it."
PokemonShuffle,36cie4,ocknon,2,Mon May 18 08:07:02 2015 UTC,"You could argue that achieving the S rank without the program would make the player happier, but you could also argue that using the program to get the S rank would make the player happier. It all comes down to personal preference at that point. For me, if the game had more hearts and wasn't a facebook type game, I would definitely find it more fun through achieving it myself, however, the game in its current state has me leaning towards using the program because I really dislike it when I am 1 move off of S ranking something because of luck and then run out of hearts and have to wait 30+ minutes for another chance."
PokemonShuffle,36cie4,Wrulfy,4,Mon May 18 08:48:55 2015 UTC,"The difference with other puzzles is that this one is moslty random. Not all stages are like the Haxorus one.  Shufflemove only tells you the move with higher output, based on what is already on the board. it doesn't tell you the best move, or the move you definitely need to do."
PokemonShuffle,36cie4,DerpySauce,3,Mon May 18 14:24:49 2015 UTC,I don't. I don't see the fun of using it.
PokemonShuffle,36cie4,Yeltsin86,2,Mon May 18 16:15:25 2015 UTC,Is S-ranking everyone of those really hard puzzles fun?  A few of the puzzles are hard even to BEAT.  I probably wouldn't use ShuffleMove at all if I wasn't limited to 5 plays every 2:30 hours.

PokemonShuffle,36cie4,mathsnail,1 point,Tue May 19 05:28:21 2015 UTC,Well said. Most people are even agree that skill actually trumps Shufflemove. You can definitely get Lucarionite if you buy a Mega Start and a Disruption Delay.

If there was a ""Fire Emblem Move"" that told you the exact moves to make to beat the level without deaths, would it be popular? What about a RPGmove program where you typed in the name of the enemy and it told you which unit to send out and which move to choose? Would that be a hit in the Pokemon community?

In the original games it was (and I am pretty sure it has been proven before); but in Shuffle, I have seen many extremely low percentage captures fail after two or three shakes, and many extremely high percentage captures fail after no or one shake. I think after the game calculates whether your catch succeeded or not, it just sets a random amount of shakes between 0 and 3 for the suspense. But this could just be bad luck.

PokemonShuffle,36597y,SirLucksalot,1 point,Sat May 16 23:02:00 2015 UTC,I am very concerned about the real catch rate they use at Regirock's RNG. It seems a lot like what is shown is a lie
PokemonShuffle,36597y,Chance_Lo,-5,Sat May 16 13:21:12 2015 UTC,"Catch rates mean nothing at all in this game. I have failed many 70%+ ones, but caught many others at around 3%."
PokemonShuffle,36597y,SirLucksalot,7,Sat May 16 07:14:29 2015 UTC,This is just how percentages work imo. An event's being unlikely to happen does not mean it will not.
PokemonShuffle,36597y,Chance_Lo,-2,Sat May 16 10:33:23 2015 UTC,"That's correct. However saying an event has a 70% chance of happening, means you will get 7 times out of 10. Throwing 5 Great balls and still failing is a bit off in this calculation. It's been a while since I've done statistics in school, but I do understand that the event are exclusive, and the chance of success is 70% every time, but for it to be 70% you must succeed 7/10 times :P"

PokemonShuffle,35vsv7,huskergirlie,4,Wed May 13 22:47:01 2015 UTC,Are you sure you have S-ranked 157 main stages? S-Ranks in expert stages do not count for unlocking new expert stages.
PokemonShuffle,35vsv7,Yuselwusel,2,Wed May 13 23:20:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am 100% sure."
PokemonShuffle,35vsv7,MayorOfChuville,3,Wed May 13 23:29:53 2015 UTC,"Well, Bulbapedia's not wrong, you do need 150 S-ranks. I'm willing to bet it's more human error than a bug, though.  What is the furthest Main Stage you've completed?"
PokemonShuffle,35vsv7,MayorOfChuville,2,Thu May 14 00:48:10 2015 UTC,The only level I haven't beat is Steelix at 190.
PokemonShuffle,35vsv7,trepvox,6,Thu May 14 01:01:46 2015 UTC,"Well now I'm stumped. I'd recount, chalk it up to a bug if you get 157 again, and then just keep S-ranking until the game gives it to you.  Maybe /u/trepvox is right, but that's unlikely unless 8 of your S ranks come from stages after M-Aero. (the first 180 are counted properly otherwise nobody would have Genesect)"
PokemonShuffle,35vsv7,Ekint,4,Thu May 14 01:13:38 2015 UTC,"Try to focus more on the original 150 then, it could be a glitch that's from the latest update not counting your newer level s ranks for mewtwo."

PokemonShuffle,35tkd5,ElementUser,3,Wed May 13 18:01:39 2015 UTC,"The same strategy as Solosis :). Easy S-ranking! Duosion has an annoying catch rate though, that's the only issue.  I still managed to S-rank him without using Duosion for his stage by getting lucky because of Mega Gengar matching at the right time."
PokemonShuffle,35tkd5,Porkpants81,1 point,Wed May 13 16:53:47 2015 UTC,"Yup I did this with Mega-Gengar, Yvetal and Duosion and I made one love and got a 66 combo for the s-rank."

This was my 3rd attempt, before I decided I was done narrowly missing my S-Rank despite using mega start and +5 moves:   Used Mega Aerodactyl (max), Heatran (9), Ninetales (9), Lucario (max) Bought Complexity -1 (prevented additional Onix spawns), and Mega Start (had a first round block clear, thanks to Aerodactyl); I also bought +5 moves, but it doesn't seem mandatory. Used ShuffleMove to give advice / the best move under most circumstances.   That ended up working for me, so good luck to everyone else out there! After a pretty awesome first turn, I was left with 3 persistent Onix icons that I ultimately never matched away. This was expensive, for sure, and more of a PITA than any other Pokemon thus far, but it got me the S-Rank!"
PokemonShuffle,35tkd5,Exodiafinder687,3,Thu May 14 14:26:53 2015 UTC,Is there any better strategy for Steelix? I just saved up the coins and did your strategy and I didn't even beat him. Used both of the powerups you suggested and he still had health left when I ran out of turns.
PokemonShuffle,35tkd5,TheLightdarker,3,Sun May 17 21:14:15 2015 UTC,"I failed twice, using the advice you mentioned, and got frustrated to the point where I also bought Complexity -1; it did the trick with no trouble at all. Good luck!"
PokemonShuffle,35tkd5,Exodiafinder687,1 point,Sun May 17 01:12:02 2015 UTC,I'm guessing that that's what I'll have to do too. I mean if I can't even beat him using this strategy I can't imagine that I'll be able to S-Rank him without using a Complexity -1.

What made a huge difference was not only Steelix not spawning any additional Onix icons, but also, my being lucky and being able to trigger an Aerodactly block clear on the first round - that cleared all but 3 Onix icons, which persisted for the remainder of the stage. I used ShuffleMove as advice, and ultimately landed my S-Rank. A huge coin investment - more than I've spent on any other stage - but seems an almost guaranteed S-Rank. Good luck!"

PokemonShuffle,35uqeg,ElementUser,2,Thu May 14 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"You don't know for sure that their business model is inferior. If people buy an increase in heart cap, they may never pay again. And Nintendo would prefer them to pay multiple times."
PokemonShuffle,35uqeg,icravedanger,3,Fri May 15 19:33:27 2015 UTC,"They could adjust values numerically, it depends on the types of players that play this game. The more impatient ones will spend more money, while some other people won't spend money as long as the resources are reasonably obtainable.  The only thing that people like me will tend to spend money on are permanent upgrades, and they could always make those a bit more expensive and/or reduce the benefit of said permanent upgrade per purchase. So +1 to Heart Cap could cost $5, for example, but +5 to Heart Cap can cost up to $30 or more. Nintendo won't get money from this pool of players unless they do something like what I said (permanent upgrades) because those have more value to that pool of players.  The best thing for them to do would simply be to cater for both parties.  Another random note: this is 1 reason why I don't check for Streetpasses right away, and only check them after I use my hearts (typically when I feel like playing) so that I don't ""waste"" heart regeneration time."

PokemonShuffle,35uqeg,Exodiafinder687,5,Thu May 14 03:42:20 2015 UTC,"It doesn't, its just gives you those hearts that you buy and on top of that you don't get a heart per half hour until you have lesas than 5 hearts again."

PokemonShuffle,35sge6,gereffi,2,Wed May 13 03:21:18 2015 UTC,"Mega Lucario is actually pretty much a waste of a mega. His ability wipes out the entire column leaving whatever possible combo's you had coming down the road with them completely gone for not enough of a damage to make it worth it. It's really like you're leaving the entire thing up to chance in a game where the game doesn't want you to win. (Oh, and mega forms don't get any more of a damage boost that I've seen so he's not even any stronger.)  So have some confidence knowing that you're on an even playing field because of this. Literally no one is using him for much of anything for long."

All timed stages give 10xp. If you fail to win then  you get a percentage of it based on how well you did, so getting the health down halfway would get you half the total xp possible. Once you get past Glalie, Ampharos is the best stage to grind on, however it's also harder to beat with a team of randoms."

PokemonShuffle,35lwpe,ddollas,10,Mon May 11 16:08:52 2015 UTC,"When I am farming coins with Meowth, I usually use two Fighting-Type Pokémon und leave the last two slots open. By doing that, Meowth won't get beaten too early. But I guess you will have to experiment which Pokémon you can use so you're not too weak but also not too strong.  Then, there are always 2 coins on the right and one on the left side. Try putting two coins over each other, so if you have at the beginning   X ... C X ... X X ... X X ... X X ... X C ... C   try do make it like   ...X ...X ...C ...C ...X ...C  or ...X ...X ...X ...C ...X ...C ...C   on the right side by either getting the bottom-left coin over first or cleaning the four pokemon between the right coins first - depends on you luck.  Then, after two rounds, another coin shoul appear. At the beginning, I would recommend to aim for 330 coins per try (so 4 coins a row). Be aware that three coins must not be placed next to each other, otherwise you'll only get 130.  If you're getting better, you can try to place 5 in a row. For doing that, you need something like that in the right column:   X C C X C C   Meowth will give you the fifth coin very late, so you have to make sure that you have weaken it enough. I hope I could help you :x  Edit: Sorry for the formatting problems."
PokemonShuffle,35lwpe,Yuselwusel,2,Mon May 11 16:19:16 2015 UTC,"What he said, hopefully you can drop the upper coin by 3 places with one match, then the last 1 place with a second.  Then try to move the other coins as they spawn to the final positions Yuselwusel noted. You then need to make a decision based on what health meowth has left. Hopefully you then have 3 turns left and must choose whether to take 330 coins or wait till 2 turns left when coin 5 spawns. Thats 1 turn to claim the coins and 1 turn to beat meowth.   I usually have Lucario and 3 other pokemon around 50 power or so. Lucario hits 3 times as hard as any other pokemon and i usually match it when i need to finish meowth quickly."

PokemonShuffle,35lwpe,ElementUser,1 point,Tue May 12 11:22:19 2015 UTC,"Your goal in most Meowth runs is to make a match 4 coins (I find them to be the most consistent, and making a match of 3 coins only nets 100 coins, which isn't worth it most of the time for 1 run).  The easiest way to do that is to relocate the coin from the bottom-left corner to be above the bottom-right corner coin, or to be above/below the other coin (after you make some matches). Then when Meowth does his first coin disruption, you have a few turns to make the 4-coin combo and finish off Meowth. The ""art"" of doing it well is trying to make 2 matching pokemon adjacent to the bottom-left coin, and swapping the coin for the final matching pokemon on the right-hand column.  You'll learn better by trying to do it yourself."
PokemonShuffle,35lwpe,Ekint,2,Thu May 14 17:50:08 2015 UTC,I use the same strategy as our friend here and decide if im going for 300 or 500 in the first turn. The leftmost coin could be in a setup that allows me to position the coin instantly on the right column. If not the case I aim for 300 because moving blocks around to allow me to position that coin takes too many moves and I wont make it to 500.
PokemonShuffle,35lwpe,Chance_Lo,1 point,Mon May 11 17:19:37 2015 UTC,Thanks!
PokemonShuffle,35lwpe,Ekint,1 point,Mon May 11 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"How can you plan this on turn 1? It depends a lot on where the other coins will appear to me. Also, you have 3 turns to place the first coin at the right place. This is more than enough and you should not quit aiming for 530 gold even if you cannot place the first coin on your first turn. If the board is nice, then you can really easily place the left coin on the right. What I usually do: If the coin in the bottom left corner is aligned with two of the same Pokémon (That is to say, if there is twice the same Poke above my coin and/or to the right of it), I either switch the coin for this Pokémon on the right column, or I try and place one Pokémon of this species right above the bottom right coin on turn one, so I can switch the bottom left coin with that icon on turn two. If the coin on the bottom left corner is not aligned with two of the same species, well I make sure it is with my turn one (and turn two if necessary), and then I place it on the right column on turn three. If I have any spare moves before the second coin appears, I try and take the top right coin one line lower by matching a line below it."
PokemonShuffle,35lwpe,Chance_Lo,1 point,Sat May 16 07:12:01 2015 UTC,I planned just like I explained. Because Ive seen that normally if the initial setup is not good enough I will fail when trying to line 5 coins. Either I never line the up because I dont have enough moves or I line them up but dont kill meowth.  Its just the way I do it to avoid failing.
PokemonShuffle,35lwpe,Rez91,1 point,Sat May 16 10:57:34 2015 UTC,"If this allows you to consistantly get 330 gold per try, then I assume this is fair enough.

Since it doesnt activate in combos theres a low chance of it affecting things early and if going for 4 it makes it arbitrarily easy to win since you have 4 turns to form a 4-5 match for the kill shot. For 5 you need a bit of luck since the 4 of a kind Crowd Control must already be setup.  This way you can run any reasonable strong mon and even some not effective ones (currently running gengar tropious snubull heatran for reference)"

Especially the stages before Heatran are actually really easy if you have mediocre pokemon.  The expert pokemon are really worth it because they are usually a lot stronger and will help you with Wacky Workshop (you'll have problems with it...) - for example, Raikou, Entei, Xerneas or Blastoise.

PokemonShuffle,35khya,Boltbeam,2,Mon May 11 07:23:35 2015 UTC,Just used the same team you used except I switched Lucario out for Milotic (Stabilize+ comes in handy on this stage) and beat him on the first try with 10 moves left and caught him with a Pokeball. M-Aerodactyl is extremely useful for those unbreakable rocks.  I wasted almost all my coins and didn't have enough for a Great Ball. It's such a relief when that Pokeball clicks.
PokemonShuffle,35khya,WTFmane,1 point,Mon May 11 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"Well done! Yeah mega aero is super helpful. The rest of the team was just the best I had. I'm sure kyogre and milotic would be better, I just haven't caught them yet!"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,Boltbeam,1 point,Mon May 11 15:51:50 2015 UTC,"Also just got it with this combination. Had to spend some coins there, but it's nearly impossible without, and the low as shit capture rate makes things worse."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,BananaSplit2,1 point,Mon May 11 09:53:52 2015 UTC,Congrats! Yeah definitely would be nice if the capture rate was higher!
PokemonShuffle,35khya,Boltbeam,1 point,Mon May 11 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"Oh! That's brilliant! It worked for me, though I had to use a Great Ball. Thank you for sharing!"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,TommoPuppy,2,Mon May 11 11:29:03 2015 UTC,Congrats! Glad I could help :)
PokemonShuffle,35khya,Boltbeam,10,Mon May 11 14:28:48 2015 UTC,"Man, does genius sonority make good music or what? The theme for the new area reminds me of pokemon colosseum, which I think was made by them too."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,SarcasticEmbodyment,11,Mon May 11 06:19:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm really feeling some Orre region nostalgia with the new section.  (Honestly, I'm just glad I don't have to listen to Wacky Workshop's theme anymore)"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,MayorOfChuville,3,Mon May 11 07:19:05 2015 UTC,"Ugh, me too."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,SarcasticEmbodyment,3,Mon May 11 08:00:57 2015 UTC,It grew on me after awhile
PokemonShuffle,35khya,Infinitedaw,9,Mon May 11 11:45:12 2015 UTC,"The silhouettes of 237 and 238 in the pokedex look like Regice and Registeel. Looks like there will be more on the way.  I wonder if they'll add Regigigas in later too.  Side note: Now that there are more stages, is there potentially a new expert stage?  Edit: 55 move Snorlax stage. New grinding material?"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,beardedpancakes,4,Mon May 11 06:14:37 2015 UTC,"Ah, good call. Forgot about the half stage"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,beardedpancakes,3,Mon May 11 06:51:24 2015 UTC,Edit: 55 move Snorlax stage. New grinding material?   Meh. It's kinda hard to beat without fighting types.
PokemonShuffle,35khya,N0gai,8,Mon May 11 07:10:52 2015 UTC,"Holy crud, this stage seems to be hard. This thing has a massive HP bar."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,clapyourhands59,8,Mon May 11 11:34:43 2015 UTC,"Tried it once I took half his HP, the rocks are so damn annoying, I must find a way.  OK, THEY WENT FULL ONIX WITH REGIROCK  Used MegaStart+5 moves, beat him with 2 moves left, 3% catchrate, tried Great Ball, missed too.  GL PEOPLE, WE WILL NEED IT"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,MetaThPr4h,16,Mon May 11 06:06:36 2015 UTC,At least we get 2 weeks and not 4 tries like Pinsir
PokemonShuffle,35khya,beardedpancakes,4,Mon May 11 06:07:42 2015 UTC,Pinsir was just a mean producers idea
PokemonShuffle,35khya,MetaThPr4h,5,Mon May 11 06:40:39 2015 UTC,THEY WENT FULL ONIX WITH REGIROCK   That was enough to convince me I probably wouldn't be getting it this time.
PokemonShuffle,35khya,Reddichu9001,1 point,Mon May 11 06:41:12 2015 UTC,Try Attack Power Boost instead of +5 moves.

Looking forward to taking him down! And best of luck to you, too, with Regirock!"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,TheLightdarker,9,Mon May 11 11:29:40 2015 UTC,"Only 10 stages this time, and no mega. Sneasel, Duosion, Snorlax, Granbull, Frogadier, Gurdurr, Quilladin, Shelgon, Braixen, Steelix"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,icravedanger,7,Mon May 11 15:04:41 2015 UTC,"181 Sneasel didn't really pay attention (lol) 182 Duosion level starts with its half left full of frozen Pokes, mostly Duosion and I didn't bring anything that could solve it (probably an ability like Slowbro's will help a lot) but still managed to win (thanks M-Gengar combo) 183 Snorlax followed people's tips and beat it with M-Aero and fighting types (barely leveled up, I must say) 184 Granbull level starts with a lot of Granbulls and they keep getting added, which usually triggers combos for you. A couple of steel blocks now and then, Bronzong helped a little with those 185 Frogadier starts with a bunch of Froakies, freezes a row after a few (4?) turns"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,leoxyz,3,Mon May 11 09:49:37 2015 UTC,"186 Gurdurr Moves: 22, 3-pokemon stage. Spams (2-4) metal blocks every turn, when low on HP also transforms 2 rows/columns into metal  187 Quilladin - Moves: 8 - lot's of wooden blocks at start, then major interruption with 2x2 wood, 2x2 metal and another 2x2 wood every three turns. basically forces you to go with disruption delay for S-rank  188 Shelgon - got out of hearts to try this one"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,trikson,5,Mon May 11 09:24:24 2015 UTC,"188 Shelgon begins with a lot of frozen pokes at columns 1,2,5,6, most of them Shelgon. Disruption after ~4 moves adds more Shelgon and hopefully starts a big combo streak. Didn't seem a big challenge, but just like Duosion, Barrier Break might help.  (Thankfully, Gurdurr is easier than Timburr. And I agree Quilladin's disruption is evil, but I think Moves+5 might be enough to S-rank)  Edit: just remembered I used a lot of Glalie's Chill against Quilladin and that might be why its disruptions didn't affect me so much."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,leoxyz,6,Mon May 11 11:34:06 2015 UTC,"189 Brazien Moves: 7, 3-pokemon stage  190 Steelix Moves: 26, interrupt with a row of metal blocks and 2x2 metal blocks onix will drop.  steelix is the last added stage"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,youmightbelucky,3,Mon May 11 12:03:31 2015 UTC,"How are you guys facing Braixen? It's a pretty messed up start, I thought of using Keldeo (to remove the frozen steel blocks at the top), but I'm not sure it's enough.  I haven't yet gone for Regirock because it seems Steelix has a 70 base power, maybe it helps.."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,leoxyz,3,Mon May 11 11:56:01 2015 UTC,"Mega Start with M-Aero, S ranked and catched using 2 turns but it might be one if you get lucky.  For the regi simply go with the megastart Maero and the attack bonus. it's 5000 coin wasted and you need another 2500 in case of megaball."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,youmightbelucky,3,Mon May 11 12:09:25 2015 UTC,just did Braixen with 1 move - 89% catch rate. Best M-start ever bought
PokemonShuffle,35khya,trikson,1 point,Mon May 11 12:25:50 2015 UTC,"Beat it with keldeo, kyogre and milotic (I think) and no coins. Once you get a few of the metal blocks out of the way its not too bad. It helps if you get lucky at the start. Really liked this stage."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,climb026,8,Mon May 11 12:57:51 2015 UTC,"This game used to be a lot of fun, but with every update, it seems like they're just trying to get money out of you."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,andersma,12,Mon May 11 15:06:20 2015 UTC,I dont mind the challenge
PokemonShuffle,35khya,Ekint,6,Mon May 11 07:00:42 2015 UTC,"It gets to the point where it's no longer a challenge and it's an obvious cash grab instead. I still enjoy the game, I just wish they didn't do that."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,andersma,3,Mon May 11 08:35:55 2015 UTC,"It's true, they are getting harder and harder, but keep in mind that it's stage 181, so they assume you've got skills and dedication. Level 181 isn't easy on F2P games like Candy Crush, Panda Jam etc. Although Regirock is a bit ridiculous for people who started not long ago. What's up with the low reward?"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,icravedanger,4,Mon May 11 15:31:41 2015 UTC,"This stage is a major heart and coin-sucker. It forces you to use Attack Power+ which is 3k coins, then if it isn't caught with PokeBall, you have to waste another 2.5k on a Great Ball. I can't think of anything else to do after 5 hearts. Anyone got a surefire strategy?  I used M-Mawile Lvl 8, Milotic, Kyogre and Lucario all Max Levels. Best catch rate I got was 21%, with no catch obviously."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,WTFmane,2,Mon May 11 08:28:16 2015 UTC,Use meg aerodactyl
PokemonShuffle,35khya,Ekint,1 point,Mon May 11 06:40:53 2015 UTC,"When I brought Aero, I didn't manage to get the evolution until the last 8-10 moves or so, and after that there wasn't a single disruption block, rendering M Aero useless. But with Mega Start, it would be a very different situation."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,icravedanger,2,Mon May 11 08:35:09 2015 UTC,"y, honestly for a decent catch rate one needs to already spent 3000 for Attack+ and 2500 for MegaStart for MegaAero"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,MetaThPr4h,1 point,Mon May 11 09:19:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, which means that once you win, you're better off throwing 3-4 Great Balls until he's caught. Because it's not worth making the big investment at the start again."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,icravedanger,5,Mon May 11 10:29:28 2015 UTC,"Just want to throw it out that I beat Regirock with M-Blastoise (5), Groudon (8), Kyogre (7), Sceptile (6). No coins used. 2 moves left. Didn't catch it unfortunately :(  Edit: Also you get +2% catch rate for each move remaining."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,eksimo,2,Mon May 11 10:48:07 2015 UTC,"Hype! let's see how many stages they added, the first one is Sneasel!  First going for Regirock tho.  GL everybody!"
PokemonShuffle,35khya,MetaThPr4h,2,Mon May 11 11:28:24 2015 UTC,Did anyone here Srank Snorlax? I'm having a hard time with it (I beat it quite easily tho)
PokemonShuffle,35khya,MetaThPr4h,2,Mon May 11 06:02:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think it helps, but with all power ups except Moves+, and using M Gengar, Snorlax went down in 5 moves. I also tried M Aero with a Mega Start and Moves+, and it failed to S-rank.  Edit: Turns out Disruption Delay is good for more than 20 turns, so you can go with M Gengar and 3 fighting 'Mons without Moves+ or Complexity."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,icravedanger,1 point,Mon May 11 09:24:28 2015 UTC,Gonna try it out thanks!
PokemonShuffle,35khya,MetaThPr4h,2,Mon May 11 17:09:55 2015 UTC,"Aarg, I was so close to beating it without boosters. I used Bronzong & Klefki to remove the blocks early-game, and Lucario & Mega-Mawile for the damage."

PokemonShuffle,35khya,icravedanger,2,Mon May 11 07:07:23 2015 UTC,Well the game was designed around microtransactions.
PokemonShuffle,35khya,Infinitedaw,1 point,Mon May 11 08:22:27 2015 UTC,they finally got a 3DS version of this to work?
PokemonShuffle,35khya,RageTiger,1 point,Mon May 11 08:37:20 2015 UTC,I believe that there has always been one. People use it for Smash to unlock custom moves. I don't think it works with Shuffle though.
PokemonShuffle,35khya,andersma,1 point,Mon May 11 08:44:09 2015 UTC,"you're right not worth it, unless there is one that also works on world rumble.  Both games still feel like it punishes you for not buying the in game currency.   I also fear that this might be testing the waters for a main pokemon game."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,RageTiger,1 point,Mon May 11 11:49:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll see this in a full release. But, yeah, as time goes on, these Shuffle levels are just getting ridiculous. I like a challenge, but things like that Pinsir level are stupid."
PokemonShuffle,35khya,andersma,1 point,Mon May 11 17:25:02 2015 UTC,I just gave in and bought a bunch of diamonds for rumble world to unlock the higher areas because in comparison to shuffle the prices seem pretty reasonable for what you get. With cash hungry shuffle events like regirock I'm just gonna accept the fact I won't 100% this game and that doesn't degrade my enjoyment of the game too much.
PokemonShuffle,35kjsb,Sillyjones,6,Mon May 11 06:25:27 2015 UTC,"For what I read, the stage will be pretty much imposible to beat without a full fighting type, so sadly I don't think so.  I still didn't get there tho, fucking Regirock is going to be a nightmare ;-;"
PokemonShuffle,35kjsb,MetaThPr4h,4,Mon May 11 06:34:28 2015 UTC,"I've already given up on Regirock for now, I have trouble getting him down to half health let alone beating him. :/"
PokemonShuffle,35kjsb,MayorOfChuville,4,Mon May 11 06:42:46 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, after the halfway point the stage gets a little ridiculous without M-Lucario. I can't imagine winning without 4 fighting types"
PokemonShuffle,35kjsb,MetaThPr4h,3,Mon May 11 07:47:49 2015 UTC,"What does he do halfway? if it's create blocks maybe MegaAero is a good plan, I honestly don't like MegaLucario at all, he doesn't do that much combos at all.  Also it sucks that I don't have trained the fighthing types since they are pretty meh except Lucario."
PokemonShuffle,35kjsb,MayorOfChuville,3,Mon May 11 07:51:54 2015 UTC,He turns 2 horizontal rows near the bottom into metal every ~3 turns. If you don't have M-Lucario you end up playing on half/one-third of a board.
PokemonShuffle,35kjsb,Azurenai,8,Mon May 11 08:13:45 2015 UTC,MAero works well for this stage if you don't have MLucario. Just beat snorlax with 8 moves left.
PokemonShuffle,35kjsb,MetaThPr4h,2,Mon May 11 08:46:26 2015 UTC,"I see, thanks"
PokemonShuffle,35kjsb,StyofoamSword,2,Mon May 11 08:24:11 2015 UTC,MegaAero worked wonders for me.
PokemonShuffle,35kjsb,StyofoamSword,2,Mon May 11 12:40:50 2015 UTC,"I beat him with Mega Aerodactyl, Lucario, Mienshao and Sawk.   Tons of block in the stage so MAero is amazing in the fight."
PokemonShuffle,35kjsb,MegaMissingno,2,Mon May 11 12:40:20 2015 UTC,It's a decently challenging stage. I'd say it's only useful for grinding fighting types alongside a powerful disruption removing mega.
PokemonShuffle,35kjsb,Lord_Surskit,2,Mon May 11 07:57:22 2015 UTC,"I got seventeen turns left with Mega Ampharos and three Fighting types, so unfortunately probably only good for grinding Fighting types."
PokemonShuffle,35kjsb,ItsAlkron,2,Mon May 11 16:38:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say definitely No. I beat it with Max Lucario, then the rest of the fighters Sawks, Meinfoo, whatever they are, level 9 and 8, and had 10 ten turns left, B rank. So hitting em real hard I scraped by, I couldn't imagine using a non Fighting team."
PokemonShuffle,35knps,MexicanGameboy,5,Mon May 11 07:22:01 2015 UTC,"This may be redundant   This may be redundant, but someone said last week that matching 4 coins in the Meowth stage will get more than 200 coins.  It arguably takes more skill, though"
PokemonShuffle,35knps,MayorOfChuville,6,Mon May 11 07:46:32 2015 UTC,"It depends, if you want the full 530 potential then it takes skill and a little luck. However if you go in with the intention to get 330 that's doable virtually every go"
PokemonShuffle,35knps,pagit85,1 point,Mon May 11 08:02:38 2015 UTC,I aim for 330 but if the health bar is low enough i'll position the coins ready for the 5th coin to spawn and go for it... I don't end up going for it very often.

PokemonShuffle,35iyai,SarcasticEmbodyment,3,Sun May 10 23:52:15 2015 UTC,"That's a really good question. It's kind of an unspoken rule among people here in SA to set the US as our country. This allows us to access key internet services like the eshop and Netflix (wii u). However, even after doing this, some other services like Nintendo video and Netflix (3ds) are still locked and can't be used.   Hope this helps."
PokemonShuffle,35iyai,leoxyz,1 point,Mon May 11 03:11:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I went to ask my friends but all of them set up their 3DS as either from Canada or the US, so it was no help. But I just remembered that during the last competition (Banettite), one of the top 5 scores was from Brazil, so I'm betting the whole South America goes among the NA rankings."
PokemonShuffle,35iyai,drumsoverbogota,1 point,Mon May 11 03:33:38 2015 UTC,I think Brasil has access to eShop. We at Colombia don't.

PokemonShuffle,35i2dt,galloots,7,Sun May 10 16:12:11 2015 UTC,"Almost every single low move stage (3 or 5 moves) has typically one specific move that removes nearly all disruptions on the stage and creates a massive combo. Just find this combo and grind up your pokémon to high enough levels where their power is enough.  Alternatively, you could drop a +5 moves whenever possible and not feeling like dealing with the gimmicks."
PokemonShuffle,35i2dt,MegaMissingno,1 point,Sun May 10 16:54:30 2015 UTC,"shufflemove really helps for that.  also, for removing certain disruption, you just need to asing a huge number to a certain pokemon, and see where the pattern goes.  but +5 turns really helps on any stage you want to S-rank"
PokemonShuffle,35fw73,sjd_13,12,Sat May 9 23:28:12 2015 UTC,Used every power-up and decimated him with an S rank. Never looked back.
PokemonShuffle,35fw73,ShadowJet96,2,Sun May 10 00:34:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this, used the power ups after levelling the pokemon I would use and crushed it."
PokemonShuffle,35fw73,defaultsuck,1 point,Sun May 10 01:04:19 2015 UTC,What pokemon did you use and what levels were they around?
PokemonShuffle,35fw73,defaultsuck,1 point,Sun May 10 05:15:42 2015 UTC,"https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonShuffle/comments/318y5o/lategame_guide_the_strongest_pok%C3%A9mon_to_use_for/  M-Gengar, Yveltal, Heracross and Scyther if I remember correctly. I didn't like using Yveltal and Zoroark together since they look too much alike."
PokemonShuffle,35fw73,MetaThPr4h,1 point,Sun May 10 05:58:10 2015 UTC,"Hm, I use all the pokemon in the 70 range for psychic, but they're leveled up to have an attack  power of 80-84. Currently using M-Gengar, Scyther, Zoroark, and Scizor. Don't think I have Yveltal :( Guess I should go back and S rank a bunch and try for it.  Thanks!"
PokemonShuffle,35fw73,xenithflare,2,Sun May 10 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"I love how every other stage that I used coins into was like ""Well, I can't do shit in this stage after 5 tries, gonna farm coins for items""  For MegaMewtwo, I was like, before even trying it before ""Well, after Glalie, Mawile and Gengar this shit is gonna be imposible, I will just farm coins""  Farmed Meowth, then I tried it for first time with all the boosts, Srank, move on."
PokemonShuffle,35fw73,Wrulfy,1 point,Sun May 10 09:55:20 2015 UTC,Guess i have lots of coin grinding to do! Thanks though
PokemonShuffle,35fw73,TommoPuppy,1 point,Sun May 10 05:16:16 2015 UTC,"I used every power-up with pokemon at level 5+, and still couldn't get him to half health. Three times now. It's disheartening at times."
PokemonShuffle,35ddal,MexicanGameboy,12,Sat May 9 05:50:03 2015 UTC,"It will end at May 11th at 06:00 UTC, so that means you can play it today and tomorrow.  Anyways, really, don't waste money in this game, if you don't catch him you will be angry or something for one, maybe two days, but no one will remember this game in a year or so, better use the money in things that are necessary.  Good luck in your catch"
PokemonShuffle,35ddal,MetaThPr4h,3,Sat May 9 06:20:42 2015 UTC,"I'm playing around with the idea of spending money on it, but to be honest I'm probably not going to. I just have too strong of a mental block against it. I do think the game's going to lose a certain charm to it if I don't get Pinsir though.  Thanks man, you too!"
PokemonShuffle,35ddal,mr_sporb,7,Sat May 9 07:56:22 2015 UTC,"try to wait it out and see if you can get it tomorrow. i would steer you away from spending money due to the fact that it'll probably be available again in a few weeks, and even if you don't get it it's only Pinsir so it's not like it's the end of the world"
PokemonShuffle,35ddal,trikson,1 point,Sat May 9 06:22:39 2015 UTC,"That's true, but the completionist in me is still screaming that I might not get him. I really hope I can manage to catch him in the next two days. If not, I don't think I'm going to like the game as much anymore. Rather than being a fun challenge, this event is making the game a stressful endeavor."
PokemonShuffle,35ddal,Seattle-Skies,3,Sat May 9 08:07:41 2015 UTC,"Rotoms are back, so will probably other timed events"
PokemonShuffle,35ddal,nintendobratkat,3,Sat May 9 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"I just caught him today after my 2nd attempt at the event. I didn't spend any money, just coins I farmed. The only items I used were a mega start and a great ball. Good luck :]"
PokemonShuffle,35ddal,Zambelta,1 point,Sun May 10 03:37:34 2015 UTC,"I managed to catch him today after feeling despair. Don't give up! I was saving my coins for the great ball game. Even if you do spend all your coins, just use the home button trick so it doesn't save and use them again next try. Good luck!"
PokemonShuffle,35ddal,nintendobratkat,2,Sat May 9 16:53:26 2015 UTC,What's the home button no save trick?? Does it allow you to keep your coins you spent or something? Sorry I'm a little new to shuffle.
PokemonShuffle,35ddal,Zambelta,3,Sat May 9 21:07:04 2015 UTC,"Basically after you try and catch it and fails, it will ask if you want to use a great ball and do so until you run out of coins, catch it or say no.  Say you hit yes until you run out of coins and never catch it, you're like well that was a waste of coins! After it pops out of the ball, hit the home button and exit the game.   The only coins you lose (and life) will be used before you enter a level so those won't be returned since it saves as it loads the stage. So unless you just S'ed a level, you can just exit and not even worry about it. It won't save your score, but it will make it so you don't lose coins spent on great balls. = )   Sorry if formatting is awful. I'm mobile lol..."
PokemonShuffle,35ddal,mr_sporb,2,Sat May 9 21:13:23 2015 UTC,Oh wow didn't know thanks so much!
PokemonShuffle,35ddal,mr_sporb,2,Sat May 9 21:24:51 2015 UTC,"After doing the Meowth stage tomorrow I'm hoping to have enough to buy the complexity -1, +5 moves and a great ball afterwards. If I can't catch him with that much of a boost... Well I don't know 0_0."
PokemonShuffle,35cru9,drumsoverbogota,2,Sat May 9 01:39:49 2015 UTC,"They basically have always been there, so expect them to last throughout the lifespan of the game."
PokemonShuffle,35cru9,Internutt,1 point,Sat May 9 13:53:28 2015 UTC,I have no idea. My bet (and hope) is it'll go on until they come up with a new Special Stage with similar ways of profit..
PokemonShuffle,35cru9,leoxyz,-1,Sat May 9 05:34:09 2015 UTC,You get one shot Saturday and one shot on Sunday. But notice that meowth has no health so just go for money.
PokemonShuffle,35cru9,trepvox,5,Sat May 9 04:54:48 2015 UTC,"I know but, they are time limited like the other events or they are going to last forever?"
PokemonShuffle,35cru9,The_Strict_Nein,2,Sat May 9 05:04:00 2015 UTC,"So far, they've been every single weekend"

PokemonShuffle,35c901,drumsoverbogota,3,Fri May 8 23:48:03 2015 UTC,"Also, maybe you could try Mega Aero, Groudon, Sceptile and Kyogre.  Still hasn't reached S-Rank but I'm very close to it."
PokemonShuffle,35c901,drumsoverbogota,2,Sat May 9 01:07:17 2015 UTC,"For Timburr, I used Mega Mewtwo Y, Slowbro, then whatever two other Pokemon were strongest. With Complexity - 1 and Mega Start, he was super easy.  For Mega Aerodactyl, don't use Complexity - 1. I don't remember exactly who I used, but I'd go with Mega Aerodactyl, and whatever three strongest Pokemon you have (I prefer Pokemon who have Power of 4). Match Mega Aerodactyl whenever there are lots of blocks and go everyone else in between.  Also, use Moves + 5."
PokemonShuffle,35awva,Jayyyyyyyyyydos,8,Fri May 8 16:04:37 2015 UTC,"RNG is RNG, but I'll be damned if it doesn't feel like it's indeed conspiring against me, sometimes - or more recently, totally on my side. For as maddening as it can be, it sure creates some amazing stories - and adds a ton of allure to more aspects of gaming than I could ever enumerate. I look at it fondly, now, but I'd be feeling rather different if I hadn't caught my 15% rate Pinsir on day one, I think..."
PokemonShuffle,35awva,TheLightdarker,1 point,Fri May 8 19:03:18 2015 UTC,"I maybe should have had another paragraph explaining that I didn't think the game was rigged, as it definitely isn't. The game evidently is based off of the statistics of chance. I should have titled the post 'Frustratingly funny', like I did in the first sentence.  The point of the post was to talk about experiences and how funny it is that you can get incredibly lucky and catch a Pokemon on 1%, but then fail more than 10 captures in a row with 75% or higher.  I caught Pinsir on my first try also. The game is definitely fair."
PokemonShuffle,35awva,Treviso,1 point,Sat May 9 08:42:21 2015 UTC,"Got Pinsir this morning with a 34% catchrate (with megaball). Glad I got that done now, was definitely worth spending the 2500 coins on."
PokemonShuffle,35awva,tabularaja,8,Sat May 9 00:44:14 2015 UTC,"It all evens out. I've had maybe 3 catches at <10%, I've had a few misses >85%. It's like rolling dice. I've found the odds to be consistent, though. I don't think they are lying about the actual catch rate"
PokemonShuffle,35awva,Shepdawg1,1 point,Fri May 8 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the game just likes to screw with us sometimes. You may have a lucky spree of catching around 25% several times, you may get as low as 6% one time, and a catch may spectacularly fail at 98%. Just a price to pay for a free-to-play game. If it doesn't cost you money, it costs you your sanity and several migraines."
PokemonShuffle,35awva,ortizr93,1 point,Fri May 8 17:47:20 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, anything from 50-90% is fair to miss occasionally. At 80%, you have a 1 in 5 chance of it missing. It seems to come out very fairly though, I've caught 3 at 1% (Entei, Suicune and Raikou luckily) and missed 2 over 90%"
PokemonShuffle,35awva,JanoSicek,1 point,Fri May 8 23:53:59 2015 UTC,"I believe the game is fair and rolls the dice every time. You can hear about success stories with 1% catch rates and failure stories with 99% catch rates.  For example yesterday I failed to catch pinsir with 15%, 30%, 30% = which has 41% cumulative chance of failure Today I catched him on first try at 15%, and that had 85% chance of failure..."
PokemonShuffle,35boqx,Frozeded,5,Fri May 8 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"It does not double the catch rate again, I had to use two great balls this morning and it didn't double it a second time."
PokemonShuffle,35boqx,onlytruestories,2,Fri May 8 19:57:12 2015 UTC,Okay thanks. Good to know
PokemonShuffle,35boqx,leoxyz,-6,Fri May 8 20:02:22 2015 UTC,"Good, really? :P"
PokemonShuffle,35boqx,Loreinatoredor,1 point,Sat May 9 00:46:50 2015 UTC,"He said good to know, as in it is good to know that is how it will play out."
PokemonShuffle,35boqx,leoxyz,-1,Sat May 9 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"I realize that, thanks"
PokemonShuffle,35boqx,TheEnglishman2,2,Sat May 9 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"Wait,are you saying you can use more then one great ball?"
PokemonShuffle,35boqx,02pheland,2,Sat May 9 09:04:49 2015 UTC,"you can use as many as you have money for or until the pokemon runs away, on the expert stages ive had pokemon run away after one great ball other times the same pokemon I threw 5 great balls before it ran away"
PokemonShuffle,35boqx,TheEnglishman2,1 point,Sat May 9 10:53:37 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, I didn't know this thanks. So just to be clear, there is a chance that even if you have the money for another one, the Pokemon may run away before you have the chance to buy another."
PokemonShuffle,35boqx,WolfHeroEX,2,Sat May 9 16:13:34 2015 UTC,It would be nice to get offered an Ultra Ball for 5000 gold though.
PokemonShuffle,35bsi1,Exodiafinder687,4,Fri May 8 20:16:44 2015 UTC,in this case it removed about 20 wood blocks from the middle of the screen at the start of the match
PokemonShuffle,35bsi1,P-Delta,3,Fri May 8 20:34:32 2015 UTC,I think you may be right. I read on another site that apparently Complexity-1 on this level simply removes the extra blocks that are supposed to fall down once you destroy the main blocks.
PokemonShuffle,35bsi1,02pheland,2,Fri May 8 20:39:25 2015 UTC,"from the point of view of the game code the wood block is counted as a pokemon so complexity - 1 stops this 5th ""pokemon"" form spawning"
PokemonShuffle,35bsi1,Yuselwusel,1 point,Sat May 9 10:56:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it is the same for M-Aero, but a few Pokémon summon additional Pokémon. For example, in the M-Gengar stage, there are your four Pokémon plus Eevees, and if you use C-1, the Eevees disappear. Maybe it's the same with Aero, but I cant remember."
PokemonShuffle,35bsi1,Infinitedaw,3,Fri May 8 20:35:19 2015 UTC,If you bring eevee with you to the mega gengar stage it starts with pidgeys XD
