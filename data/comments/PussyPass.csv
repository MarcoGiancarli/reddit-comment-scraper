It's a shitty argument because it allows for people to get falsely accused and imprisoned. The justice system is too much in favor of women, IMHO."
PussyPass,3dtrmz,Varean,9,Sun Jul 19 17:42:05 2015 UTC,"Rape is a very unique crime because of the proof that is required for a conviction. In any other crime, the material or lackthereof is tantamount to showing that a crime was even committed (a body, a broken limb, a missing object, possession of something illegal, some kind of video evidence, etc.), but in the case of an only somewhat carefully orchestrated rape, there might be no DNA evidence whatsoever, which would really help out the case. Even with DNA evidence, how do you prove the intent?  I know I'm simplifying the hell out of it, but it is possible to both (a) not even touch a person and then consequently be thrown in jail for rape or have your reputation completely tarnished when they fabricate a story from scratch, or (b) to drug and rape somebody and then face no consequences from it whatsoever, even after a tox screen and a DNA test.  So, if a victim comes forward, they have set themselves on a difficult journey. First of all, they are seen as a victim of a horrible crime in the eyes of some, and are slut-shamed in the eyes of others. During the investigation, they might get equal amounts of encouragement from people who want them to make sure justice is served, and discouragement from people who want them to drop it because she's going to ruin a good person's life, it was their fault for wearing her clothes / acting a certain way, etc., and now for a long time many people (including the victim) may see them as ""broken"" or ""damaged."" The consequences so far are nearly guaranteed. At this point, the investigation may find no material evidence, even though the crime absolutely did happen, so now the entire case is based on the victim's words versus the perpetrator's words, and one of them has just been through probably the most traumatizing event in their life so may have difficulty holding it together. At trial, the defense attorney is going to print up pages and pictures from your Facebook profile and show that you live a care-free lifestyle and that you're a slut and were just being slutty, but got mad at this person and want to find a way to ruin their life.  Meanwhile, if they had just stayed silent, the world won't know that somebody did something terrible to them. Nobody would be telling that they brought it upon themselves, that they deserved it, that so-and-so is such a great person and maybe they can talk it out, etc."

PussyPass,3dtrmz,SuperNinjaBot,5,Sun Jul 19 22:40:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, I need to point this out:  This is only applicable to rape accusations made when both parties are arguably drunk or marital rape.  Statutory rape doesn't usually go down like this- neither do stranger rape cases, or many other forms of sexual assault.  Frankly, the insistence that all rape victims get slut shamed in equal amounts as they are supported is ridiculous.  Slut shaming in rape cases usually happens when the case is truly in a grey area.   The cases were the alleged rapist truly believed they weren't forcing anything on the person they allegedly raped because they were either married, or both drunk.  Hell, in our society we'll prosecute a 17 year old lesbian on statutory rape charges for having sex with her 15(16?) year old girlfriend.  That's the reality- people really Fucking hate rapists, and genuinely are concerned for rape victims.  Also- no. The ""she's a slut"" defense is inadmissible in court. Clothing and lifestyle choices are excluded- always. So that's just straight up make believe there.   Now, if they had repeatedly had sex before then, that would be admissible, but it's not a very good defense- even a shitty lawyer can explain that one yes isn't a yes forever.  My point being this: if you or someone you know gets raped- go to the police. It's nothing like what this poster said- unless it's marital, or both of you were drunk."
PussyPass,3dtrmz,jroth005,2,Sun Jul 19 22:18:34 2015 UTC,"I also don't think GPP is correct with regard to tox screens. Yes, someone could use a chemical that they don't have a test for. That person would have to have some serious medical and/or forensic knowledge, or have researched it beforehand, which would be at the extreme end of premeditation for a rape case.   Yes, this could happen, but these kinds of cases would be dwarfed by the number of cases where rape victims don't press charges, and when they make false accusations. If women who were not raped would stop making false accusations, and women who were raped would consistently report their rapes, without washing away evidence, whatever 'ninja rapists' remained would become a far more identifiable and quantifiable problem, and the state of forensic technology would adapt. We'd get better tests.   Also, while it's totally conceivable that a person could date rape a woman without leaving any dna either in or on a part of her body that would indicate sexual activity had occurred, he still cannot predict that this will happen. He will have to both premeditate in some way to minimize his chance of leaving evidence (Full body depilation? Dermabrasion?) and simultaneously plan a defense in case it doesn't work out the way he planned. It's very difficult not to leave dna somewhere, and forensic detectives are fucking good at finding it. In the case of a drug facilitated rape, I guess a pair of latex bondage pants and a condom might work, but then there's still the tox screen, and I am sure that stealth date rape drugs are very hard to come by, so this situation cannot possibly be common, and when it does happen, it's probably a friggin' doctor doing it, and she likely will never even know. Yes, I know this happens, but there is no friggin' way, in any class of crime, that the criminal justice system can deal with the really uncommon cases before dealing with the really common cases. It just doesn't happen. It's the common case that needs to be dealt with, by eliminating the kind of rape culture culture that encourages real rape victims to not report their rapes, while simultaneously encouraging false accusers to either make legal accusations that could put innocent men in prison, or just to make accusations in the public sphere designed to ruin a man's life. All of that crap needs to stop before we can even begin to deal with the rare but inevitable criminal genius who just so happens to know how to get away with rape."

Basically to get out of jail right away he had to lie and legally admit to a crime or possibly spend several more years in jail to be vindicated.   Also many states have laws that outline how much you can actually get paid for each year you are imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit, here is a table I found. So this happened in LA so per their laws he would get $100 per day in prison if he had fought it, he served 18 months so that would be roughly $54,800 plus the time it would take for the retrial which could take even longer then 18 months"

PussyPass,3dswo2,Citadel_CRA,3,Sun Jul 19 04:13:30 2015 UTC,Because the guy filming wasn't doing anything illegal? Probably didn't care that it could be used against his friends.

PussyPass,3dswo2,Archbishopmikedub,2,Sun Jul 19 12:18:40 2015 UTC,I think for me and probably everyone its just how she was smiling and laughing and hitting him in the face as hard as he could and then as soon as he hits back she swapped to absolute victim.... Don't think he should have but her so late though.
PussyPass,3dswo2,eggsy,9,Sun Jul 19 21:25:32 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they are both guilty of assault. Sure, she hit first and even continued to provoke him (and I'm pretty sure there was an element of drug use to diminish responsibility) but since she was being restrained what he did was definitely criminal. I'd guess she would get a lesser punishment despite being the instigator anyway."

It's possible that they do use 16 as one of their cut offs, though it's possible that they don't have any but just prosecute under different laws. I doubt that the age of consent in the general population would be an especially firm boundary though, since this is an issue for mitigation rather than culpability (which is identical in every case).   My original point was just that the fact that the person was over 16 did not diminish legal culpability. Sorry if I was confusing."

PussyPass,3dnb5k,ilnuit,8,Fri Jul 17 19:18:40 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of SJW :      Social Justice Warrior. A pejorative term for an individual who repeatedly and vehemently engages in arguments on social justice on the Internet, often in a shallow or not well-thought-out way, for the purpose of raising their own personal reputation. A social justice warrior, or SJW, does not necessarily strongly believe all that they say, or even care about the groups they are fighting on behalf of. They typically repeat points from whoever is the most popular blogger or commenter of the moment, hoping that they will ""get SJ points"" and become popular in return. They are very sure to adopt stances that are ""correct"" in their social circle.  The SJW's favorite activity of all is to dogpile. Their favorite websites to frequent are Livejournal and Tumblr. They do not have relevant favorite real-world places, because SJWs are primarily civil rights activists only online.     #1:  A social justice warrior reads an essay about a form of internal misogyny where women and girls insult stereotypical feminine activities and characteristics in order to boost themselves over other women.  The SJW absorbs this and later complains in response to a Huffington Post article about a 10-year-old feminist's letter, because the 10-year-old called the color pink ""prissy"".  #2:  Commnter: ""I don't like getting manicures. It's too prissy.""  SJW: ""Oh my god, how fucking dare you use that word, you disgusting sexist piece of shit!""    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"

PussyPass,3dnb5k,jizzlyn,5,Fri Jul 17 19:24:51 2015 UTC,"No, there can't.  SJWs don't care about the cause, they care about themselves.  Ask an advocate for social change why things should be different and you'll get an impassioned response because that's how people react when you ask them about their passions!  Ask a SJW and they'll scoff, telling you that either it isn't their job to educate you, or they'll smugly name their fee for speaking.  A person who cares about race relations smiles when they encounter an interracial relationship. A SJW is disgusted by the mix of cultural appropriation and internalized racism.  SJW are scum and some the worst people you can meet."

Basically, there may be a scientific basis genetically for different races, but what we call different races - black, white, asian, etc - is indeed a social construct."
PussyPass,3d9tks,novaquasarsuper,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:37:49 2015 UTC,"Uhh no, the article does not support OP because his claim was that race was a purely social construct, and the article plainly refutes that notion and provides evidence that race has a biological basis.  You might want to read it again.  I didn't say that race was ""necessarily something you can see visually external"", I'm just refuting the argument that ""there's only one race:  THE HUMAN RACE"" because that argument is wrong.   The past century has seen a wild swing from the widespread acceptance of the idea that human races are real, with big, important differences, to the opposite position: that race is fundamentally an illusion, a social construction of the human mind. But both of these arguments are mistaken. The established modern consensus about the equality of people, irrespective of race, is morally and ethically justified. But these beliefs we hold to be true do not derive from the natural science, which doesn’t present a clear moral lesson."
PussyPass,3d9tks,hell___toupee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:50:20 2015 UTC,"No. OP said breaking us down into 'ethnic categories' is purely a social construct.

PussyPass,3d9tks,hell___toupee,0,Tue Jul 14 22:59:20 2015 UTC,"No. OP said breaking us down into 'ethnic categories' is purely a social construct.   And OP was wrong.  Take a close look at the second image from the top which shows the genetic distance between peoples from different ethnic groups.  He is citing this study which analyzes genetic variation between distant human populations.  This image shows that there is less average genetic variation between different ethnic groups from Africa, East Asia, South Asia, and Northern Europe than there is between an average member of one of those groups and an individual from a different group.  This image maps the amount of average genetic variation between groups that could be classified as being from the same ""race"", for example East Asians such as Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Japanese people are more closely genetically related than other racial groups from other geographic areas, but they can still be easily partitioned into separate racial categories based on there being less average genetic variation between two Japanese people than there is between a Japanese person and Vietnamese person.

I'm in no way excusing that hypocrisy as it clearly shows double standards and men are viewed as lesser beings, but you have to realize that the majority of people on the planet will act like this due to two main factors imo:    1: They've been conditioned ALL their life by their parents and the parents before that to not hit women, and therefore create this mental image that blocks them from thinking rationally and doing the egalitarian approach which is treat everyone as a HUMAN BEING, not a MAN or a WOMAN. This creates this social trigger which will make us laugh/feel pity for a guy who is 'too weak' to defend himself.    2: An extension of my first point which is that some KNOW that what the girl is doing is wrong and that they should step in.

I pulled this from the wiki link you gave me. Ill do you the honors since you might not have read it yourself "" [there was a 15 point difference on]intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g). Controlled studies of the way the tests were formulated and administered had shown that this did not contribute substantially to the difference. Attempts to devise tests that would minimize disadvantages of this kind had been unsuccessful. The scores predicted future achievement equally well for blacks and whites. ""The cause of that differential is not known; it is apparently not due to any simple form of bias in the content or administration of the tests themselves. The Flynn effect shows that environmental factors can produce differences of at least this magnitude, but that effect is mysterious in its own right. Several culturally based explanations of the Black/White IQ differential have been proposed; some are plausible, but so far none has been conclusively supported. There is even less empirical support for a genetic interpretation. In short, no adequate explanation of the differential between the IQ means of Blacks and Whites is presently available."""

Racially, blacks score less than whites who score less than asians. For some reason, it's not a touchy subject to say that asians are racially more intelligent."
PussyPass,3cxvh4,jizzlyn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:59:27 2015 UTC,In that case there wouldn't be so many white trash out there. But there are SO many factors that takes a community to become uneducated and in poverty.  Essentially how its ran and its funding which we do not fund nearly as much as we do for defense. YES dea\gov cuts and resells coke back to black impoverished communites. YES they gave it to them in the first place in masses. YES we enslaved there lineage for hundreds of years up until our great great grandparents lifetime. Get over your white superiority complex.

PussyPass,3cxvh4,politic,2,Sun Jul 12 07:04:17 2015 UTC,"Let me be abundantly clear: I am NOT a white supremacist.   I believe that every race has racial strengths and weakness. I take issue with the fact that every other race is subject to racial scrutiny except for blacks, and that's unfair.  There's nothing I hate more than hypocrisy and injustice.  That's why I hate how the criminal justice system treats women. Divorce and child custody suits are overwhelmingly biased in women's favor.   Consent laws are written with the assumption that women are not responsible for their actions. Maybe you saw that picture on the front page today? Something about how John and Jackie are drunk and hook up, but Jackie can't consent because she's drunk so therefore John raped her. The double standard is sickening. When two drunk drivers hit each other, gender never factors into who is at fault - yet apparently men are liable for their drunk decisions but women aren't.   Also, the gender pay gap is still believed by a majority of people, despite being refuted over and over.    If a female teacher commits statutory rape on an underage male student, the word rape is never used. They call it sexual contact. And everyone just laughs and asks, ""Where was she when I was in high school?"" Yet when a man has consensual sex with a 17 year old student, he's branded a rapist, put on a sex offender registry, and popular opinion wants to see him executed, or at least castrated.   Do you see what I mean? It's the injustice, hypocrisy, and double standards that I and people like me hate. Not the demographics in question."

For example, I despise violent crime, not black people. Incidentally, black people are responsible for the majority of violent crime. If blacks stopped committing crimes, a white supremacist would continue hating them. I would not.  I see things like the black communities reaction to Michael Brown's death - the burned and looted their own cities and senselessly murdered cops on the other side of the country over it. And I'm supposed to feel white guilt because a criminal was killed for attacking a cop?  That white oppression was the cause of all of that? Absurd!  Gay pride.  White pride.  Black pride.  Transgender pride.   One of those four is socially unacceptable. Can you guess which one?  Why should I be denied pride in my heritage? I never owned a slave.  Hell, my family didn't even immigrate to America until after slavery ended.  Do you deny that the social double standard exists?"

You cannot have both."
PussyPass,3cidfb,Tingly_Fingers,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:52:49 2015 UTC,"I simply don't understand how a woman attacking someone is ""acting like a man"".   The core idea behind chivalric behavior is based around the idea that women are physically weaker and less durable than men (an idea that is totally bullshit). In addition, physical violence is supposedly below feminine gentility and as such, in cases where a physical response was ""warranted"" for offensive behavior from a male, another obliging male would take up the mantle to ""champion her cause"" in response to that offense. Because of that assumption, women were historically granted a degree of immunity from retaliation for physically assaulting a man or otherwise rude physical responses.  Historically, a slap from an offended woman was considered the upper limit of an assault that a man would take from a woman. But at the same time, there are countless historical anecdotes showing women assaulting men with kitchen implements (frying pans, rolling pins, brooms, etc...). Again, men were ""expected"" to accept those ""minor"" assaults in exchange for women accepting their societal role.  However, with our ""modern"" society, the constant declaration from feminist women claiming that they want to be treated as equals to men constantly conflicts with the reality that when they assault men, these same women expect the old rules to apply.   Here's a side note; historically, the term ""lady"" was only meant for noblewomen. But when it came into common usage, it was a term of respect for women who accepted the ""traditionalist"" gender role for women. They were treated with genteel courtesy in exchange for that acceptance. ""Ladies"" were never supposed to engage in personal violence as a rule because violence was deemed a behavior limited to ""the male realm."" A gentleman (formerly a lord or knight) was there to take up the mantle of violence for a lady in case of an offense where violence was the only appropriate response. In more modern times, you had women who engaged in ""unladylike behavior"" and as such, in response you had phrases like ""the difference between a woman and a lady...."" come into common usage. But I digress....  The phrase in question (""acting like a man"") is based on the idea that if a woman strikes a man herself, she waives that ""feminine immunity"" from violence, the associated championing from a concerned male, and accepts the burden of defending herself from any further escalation that results from her striking said man.  The fact is that human beings fight when attacked. Historically, women accepted the gender role as ""the weaker sex"" in exchange for a degree of immunity from that frightening aspect of human behavior. By demanding to be free from that role, the only protection that they have left is the same protection that any other man has from another. The fact is that good men don't start fights; they only finish them.  (*edited for thought reorganization and clarity)"

PussyPass,3cidfb,mastersoup,32,Wed Jul 15 21:19:03 2015 UTC,"He didn't ""grab her"".  She made a fist, he grabbed it to keep her from striking. She struck him with the other hand, so he retaliated in self defense. This is a pussy pass, because if you raised that fist, you would instantly be charged with assault.   This is a hilarious instance of a blatant pussy pass, simply because she threw a weak ass punch. Watching the video, we see her terrible punch, but if you are in that situation, both presumably intoxicated, she threatens you, and you are struck, you will not think rationally, you will defend yourself."

There was no shoving his way into her, she was the initial aggressor to anyone with eyes and a brain."
PussyPass,3cidfb,mastersoup,19,Wed Jul 8 07:59:46 2015 UTC,"You are allowed to grab someone who raises a fist at you. It would be impossible for anyone to legitimately claim he's the initial aggressor, since he objectively is not.    Again, this is where the phrase to the extent necessary comes in to play.   No it doesn't. It isn't extent you deem necessary. It is extent they deem necessary. Saying someone is weaker doesn't mean jack shit. You don't know if she might grab a bottle or glass off that bar. Hell, the pain from a good punch wouldn't even have had enough time to register. Someone throws a punch, you are not accountable for throwing one back.   Disparity of force? A punch for a punch isn't a disparity. It is parity.    Which doesn't change the legality of the act.   Yes, it does."
PussyPass,3cidfb,kragshot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:09:21 2015 UTC,"Disparity of force does not apply if a punch is thrown in response to a previous punch.  The law is supposed to understand that fights happen. If one person responds to being punched by punching and the other person punches back in turn, then you have a fight and the adjudication starts at an analysis of who threw the first punch and why.   ""Disparity of force"" only applies in cases where a far superior (or more lethal) category of response is used in reply to a lesser one. Key example. If somebody slaps you and you stab them in the neck with a knife in response, then ""disparity of force"" is applicable for the prosecution.  This guy is going to jail because he had the misfortune to be a black man who encountered a ""Shelby"" and now he's going to pay for daring to lay hands on a white woman in Florida."

PussyPass,3cidfb,mastersoup,14,Thu Jul 9 04:05:33 2015 UTC,"And when he jams his way in to her, she turns around and says something, and keeps on shoving? If this was two guys, it would have started something.   Actually, he's very fucking clearly trying to get to the bar to order a drink. She should get out of his way. He isn't jamming his way into her, he's trying to get through the crowd.    It isn't what I or the two involved in the incident deem necessary, it's what a reasonable person deems necessary. Given the disparity of force between the football player and the woman and the weak blow she landed, it's pretty hard to claim that full on decking her was necessary to prevent bodily harm.   How is it even remotely hard to claim getting punched can cause bodily harm? Even a light tap to his eye can cause lasting damage. And what is this garbage you keep linking me? What do all of these gun blog posts have to do with retaliating a punch with a punch? Are you fucking daft?   It does in the eyes of the law. Disparity of force is a significant cornerstone of American self defense jurisprudence. If it didn't, you could defend, in the extreme case, decking a toddler because they raised a force to you. Disparity of force caselaw is the reason you can't claim a toddler presented a threat, just like this guy probably isn't going to be able to defend himself against the assault charge.   Disparity of force isn't what you think it is. Saying someone is stronger when both people punch each other is fucking ludicrous. What you are literally saying, is that a man can NEVER defend himself against a female attacker, assuming they are both at average strength for their gender. If he shot her in the face, you've got a point. He didn't. He retaliated with identical action. If someone shoots me in the shoulder while hes trying to kill me, and I shoot him in the head in my retaliating gunfire, am I guilty of murder, just because I am a better shot?  You are completely ignorant in terms of the law, and common sense. You're making a fool out of yourself. If this was you and me at a bar, both men, the cops see this footage, I would be charged with assault even without throwing that left hand jab. No ifs ands or buts. It is blatant, and textbook assault. If I were teaching law school right now, and we had a lesson on assault, I'd show this video and point out the woman, and say ""assault"".    Which doesn't change the fact that she didn't.   That's not how the law works, and why it precisely states perceived threat. What she does (weak punch) doesn't matter. You simply cannot know what the other person is going to do. If someone points a gun at you, are you not allowed to shoot back unless they shoot first? He was first threatened, then punched, and you think he can't reasonably assume it may escalate?    Jails are filled with people that tried that line of reasoning.   Many are blatant pussy passes.   Is a punch from a toddler on parity with a young, built football player? Is the punch thrown by the woman? The guy walks away unharmed. It's clearly not parity.   You walking aware from an altercation harmed vs unarmed doesn't mean shit. Where did you go to law school? This is painful to read. I lunge at you with a knife, I miss, you kick me in the face and break my nose. You going to jail? And a grown ass woman isn't a toddler. If you're going to keep making an ass out of yourself with false equivalency, then by all means, take your bullshit elsewhere. A woman is capable of beating up a man, punching a man, killing a man, assaulting a man, and has the mental capacity to know right from wrong.    Ask a prosecutor if it does. You'll find out rather rapidly you're wrong.   Depends if you mean legally, or what actually happens with a pussy pass."
PussyPass,3cidfb,mastersoup,13,Thu Jul 9 04:16:33 2015 UTC,"You're clearly seeing what you want to see.   No, I am seeing blatant and obvious assault. A raised fist is assault.   It's hard to claim a light, hamfisted tap from a drunk woman presented a threat.   Why because it looks like a shitty punch while you watch the footage sitting on your fat ass in your computer chair? If I get punched, I don't think, ""what a weak punch"". You don't have time.   They're gun blog posts that go over the jurisprudence surrounding self defense law. I'm pretty sure self defense law is relevant to self defense.   It is literally, completely unrelated to this video. Do you see anyone pulling out a gun here?   You're welcome to post a citation that shows otherwise, which you don't seem to be capable of doing.   A citation for an abstract thought? It's not long some specific legal term. The only time it's ever used in legal conversations, is when talking about shooting an unarmed person. It's never used in a physical altercation, when one person is simply stronger than the other. Strength isn't even the determining factor of who wins every fight. Technique is far more important for example. A trained martial artists fights a body builder. Martial artist can't harm the body builder because he isn't as physically strong?   Yes, officer, I shot an unarmed man. He, like, might have gone and gotten a gun. It's totally a legitimate defense! Yeah, it actually doesn't work like that at all.   If that gun was in his belt buckle, then yes, that's perfectly valid. Cops get off with killing unarmed people constantly. Why? Perceived threat. Zimmerman got off, didn't he? You're simply and painfully wrong. Did travon martin have a gun? Yes or no? Learn the law. You're wasting my fucking time with your ignorance.    Wait until a jury gets through with the case. It matters, if you would actually bother to read any part of the articles I've already posted about disparity of force.   When I say it doesn't matter, I mean legally. If I threw that punch, I'm charged. If he's found guilty, it merely displays the pussy pass at work. As I have said many times. It doesn't matter if that punch is strong or weak, because the second she makes the fist, it is assault, and he is allowed to defend himself. Punching someone isn't a serious act, and it is one of the most basic forms of self defense.    Again, disparity of force. Person with weapon > unarmed person. Drunk out of shape woman < young fit football player.   You either misunderstood, or dodged the example. You brought up that it's ""disparity of force"" because she is possibly bruised, and he is ""uninjured"". My example shows that I would be injured, and you would not be, even though I came at you with a knife. I am telling you that your point is irrelevant.    I guess the words ""extreme example"" were lost on you. It was an extreme case to illustrate a point that has obviously flown right past you.   It's not an ""extreme example"" it is called false equivalency, it is a logical fallacy. An adult woman is not the same as a toddler, at all. The potential threat someone poses shouldn't be somehow based on gender. We have female prisons for a fucking reason. They can do harm, and do bad things. No toddler is serving 5-10 for stabbing their father.    Pot, kettle, kettle, pot, kiddo.   Please quote my false equivalency.    All women aren't capable of beating up all men, and all men aren't stronger than all women, which is why we have judges, courts, and juries to judge the merits of cases. But, that all seems lost on you, so I'll leave you to your childish insults.   They don't need to be capable of beating up all men. Courts aren't there to decide who is stronger, or who's the better fighter. They aren't keeping score of some MMA match. They are there to determine who instigated, and if the actions were justified. If I rob a bank, get caught right after, do I get to go home free because I suck at robbing banks? This woman broke the law. She assaulted him. It's not the courts job to decide if she assaulted him well, and how good her punching form is."

It appears that the blonde and the QB are both vying for a spot up at the bar.  The blonde pushes her way through.  The QB leans in to the asian person and says ""Excuse me, can you move so I can get through.  If you look closely, his hand is underneath the bar the whole time trying to clear a line to what should be an empty spot.   The blonde looks like she keeps backing up into him as he is trying to squeeze through.   He finally gets by her, and she turns to him and starts trying to intimidate him, which obviously isn't going to work. She raises a fist and says something along the lines of ""Back off, asshole"".  He grabs her wrist and says ""Put your fist down you drunk bitch.""  to which she responds by yelling at him to let her go, and throws a punch into his face.   He glances it off, and replies with a punch of his own.  Legally, should he be able to punch her back in self-defense?  Absolutely.   I would not have made the same choice, but she not only raised her fist to him first, she actively threw a punch at him.    SHE WAS THE ESCALATOR,  NOT HIM.  I'm not saying going off and blasting drunk sluts in the face is the best option to choose in that scenario, but I don't expect everyone to make the same choices."

PussyPass,3cidfb,reddexx,4,Wed Jul 8 10:00:40 2015 UTC,"Under Section 776.012, Florida Statutes, a person is justified in the use of non-deadly force in self-defense where the person reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself or herself or another against such other’s imminent use of unlawful force.  There is no duty to retreat.  That being the law, here are the jury instructions on self defense:  3.6(g)  JUSTIFIABLE USE OF NON-DEADLY FORCE  Because there are many defenses applicable to self-defense, give only those parts of the instructions that are required by the evidence.  Read in all cases.  An issue in this case is whether the defendant acted in self-defense.  It is a defense to the offense with which (defendant) is charged if  the [death of] [injury to] (victim) resulted from the justifiable use of non-deadly force.  Definition.  “Non-deadly” force means force not likely to cause death or great bodily harm.  In defense of person.  § 776.012, Fla. Stat.  Give if applicable.  (Defendant) would be justified in using non-deadly force against (victim) if the following two facts are proved:  1.    (Defendant) must have reasonably believed that such conduct was necessary to defend [himself] [herself] [another] against (victim’s) imminent use of unlawful force against the [defendant] [another person].  2.    The use of unlawful force by (victim) must have appeared to (defendant) to be ready to take place.  Woman escalates thrice. I don't know what video youre watching but it's no where near how you portray it. Casual contact happened in a crowded bar. He asks the girl next to the party involved if he could slide into that spot. She acknowledges and moves, as Deandre approaches the now vacated spot the woman try's to box him out with her ads and hips. Words are exchanged and the woman draws back with a clinched fist while using her fore arm under the mans chin/ neck area. Deandre grabs the perceived threat and pull it down. She the try's to knee him in groin and he positions himself to not be hit by the knee. Finally she takes a swing. Three times she escalates. If the law is truly blind both get charged and they let a jury decide.   Edit: that disparity of force article you linked is for Missouri and doesn't apply. No precedents like that have been set in Florida. Only disparity of force precedent I can find is escalating hand to hand violence into deadly violence."

Hence, her immediate violent reaction to being (in her perspective) felt up. She acted out of violence immediately rather than just moving away from him as much as possible, which would be my (and any other reasonable person's) reaction to someone encroaching on my personal space, she decided to hit him.

The woman doesn't sound like she has prior crimes, so there is no need for charging for prior offenses.  That brings us to the user above stating they hate the ""prior offenses"" punishment, which I gave a different opinion to.   That's why they both got the same punishment (sex offender registry) for one crime (being sex offenders) and why they got different punishments (jail time) for another crime (having prior criminal offenses).

This pussypass is quite irritating  to me, but this is a very very very unpopular opinion of mine, so I usually don't speak of it. I believe, and nobody was ever able to give me a decent argument against it, that if you think a PERSON deserves to be punched it doesn't matter if it's a woman or a man.   If by your personal subjective filter and reasons you think that 'being hit in the face' deserves the reaction 'hit back', you should hit back regardless if it is a man or a woman, with a few exceptions (mental disability, kids, etc).  ""NEVER HIT A WOMAN"" is just plain stupid. What is the criteria? Strength? There are women stronger than some men. There are men weaker than other men.   You should only react when someone is the same size or bigger than you? So weak/small people have a FREEPASS to hit others? You might say 'no, they will be charged', but that still generates inequality. Why? Because both big/strong and small/weak people will get charged (or at least SHOULD, but as we see in this case they don't lol), but only one of those can hit the other without being hit back. That's bullshit. If you were hit and you think the person who hit you deserves to be hit back, you should just do it regardless of their size or sex.  Honestly, what the FUCK was this woman thinking? This is all I want answered. She CLEARLY thought she had a freepass punching him. Fuck...  I personally don't go around punching people, even if they punch me first. I only punched someone twice and I was under 12 years old both times. But if I ever felt like hitting someone, the sex of the person wouldn't matter."

At that close range, he was fully in the right for defending himself and getting away from the imminent danger.

Hes going to suffer the wrath of a media shitstorm which might cost him his professional career, and shes gonna get a fat paycheck for starting a fight then pulling the victim card. This is a clear example of how the legal system favors women."

This guy is aggressively and rudely pushing his way up to the bar against two people who do not see him. He should have been gently stepping through while tapping one of them on the shoulder (left) so he could ease through.  Meanwhile, it's never okay threaten to punch someone who aggressively bumped into you unless you clearly know it was intentional.   Neither person should be charged.

Miss Sandlin, who was on a gap year after leaving the £11,700-a-year Abbey Gate College   A 'free spirit', one could say of this young woman, if one were polite.   Price had been at a wedding, where he had drunk seven pints  'He was very drunk, blind drunk. He completely overstepped the mark. I was shocked.’   Your average 24 year old male in the UK does not get so drunk off of seven pints over the few hours time(?) of a wedding to be in a mindless rapey zone. Unless they were pints of something harder. And if he was THAT drunk? His dick wouldn't work in the first place.   the incident happened at Price’s family home, a £1million eight-bedroomed farmhouse in the picturesque village of Higher Kinnerton  Miss Sandlin, who lives with her civil engineer father and housewife mother   There it is.   Miss Sandlin realised Price was drunk because he kept laughing for no reason and picked her up, accidentally hitting her head on the kitchen door in the process.   Didn't say ""No""   Once in the bedroom, he also took a cover off his broken leg and threw it towards her, banging her nose   Didn't say ""No""   They began to have sex, but Price started biting Miss Sandlin on the neck and pulling her hair, making her feel frightened. Miss Sandlin said she became upset because Price took hold of her neck and started to choke her.   Come on. You can do it. Tongue to the roof of your mouth... nuh... nuh... now make a circle with your lips. Nuh... oh. Nnnnno. No.   But he laughed and let her go when she said ‘No’ and began to cough.   That's a good girl. And see? He didn't mean harm. He thought you were enjoying yourself.   The pair – who both accepted their relationship was not emotional but purely physical –   Those are always fun.   once [back] in bed he bit her on the thigh and bottom. Price denied assault, telling police the sex was no more rough than normal.    So this is their thing. No wonder the guy didn't catch any subtle red lights. Safe words exist for a reason.   But no, let's not be a responsible adult and instead, choose to strip ourselves of agency:   Miss Sandlin accepted she could have left at any time, but said she was scared Price would get angry.   Oh so she brought the bogeyman in her head into to court, and not the actual guy she, by all prior indications, had a good time being roughed-up by?   Miss Sandlin, who is hoping to start a creative writing degree   Good, maybe she'll improve her storytelling skills."

Guess how the article went? Of course the two only infos were burried deep inside a flow of compassion for the murderer, and barely evoked. And it literally said that the number of murders didn't matter (yeah because the lives of the seven other babies is worthless, right?), and that it didn't make her a serial killer (how the fuck do they define a serial killer, then?! for fuck sake). And then even that ""she is like everyone else"".  So if she was neither abused nor clinically insane, why was she excused for impaired judgement? Because she was ""shy"" and complexed about her fat ass. (That is all. Really.)

The only point of outrage that had anything to do with the ""millions watching"" was simply that it was setting a bad example and discouraging female scientists around the world.

Aggravated assault, forcible confinement (kidnapping?), rape, possibly attempted murder (head strikes with a frying pan)... and she gets 9 months. Yeah women are SOOOOOO oppressed...."
PussyPass,3bhoqi,Jesus_marley,29,Mon Jun 29 11:31:35 2015 UTC,"A Prince George teenager has been sentenced to nine months for her part in brutally assaulting two men she believed sexually assaulted her while she was asleep.  The pair of men were struck with an empty bottle, frying pans, and one of them was sexually assaulted with a mop handle — no culprits, however, were ever arrested by police for the suspected sexual assault that sparked the whole thing.  According to court records, it all began in January 2013 in the middle of a multi-day house party when the teen, who was sleeping in a bed with another woman, awoke in the belief that the pair had the same dream of being sexually assaulted during their sleep.  There was also a white iPod stuck to Ms. P’s body that didn’t belong to her.  “Using what can be described only as deficient detective skills, Ms. P came to the belief that the assailant was connected to the white iPod that had been left in the apartment,” the judge wrote.  The teen and six others, though social media, determined the iPod belonged to a Mr. P, who along with another man would be found by first responders the next day in a snowbank, beaten and bloodied.  The man was invited down to an apartment, where the seven accused, including Ms. P, — 15 at the time — were waiting.  He was shown the iPod and an explanation was demanded — then the group attacked.  “The group closed and locked the door … then continued to strike Mr. P with their fists … another one of the co-accused struck him in the forehead with an empty vodka bottle and another kicked him in the face,” said the judge.  At some point, Mr. P managed to convince the group he wasn’t involved in the suspected sexual assault. That’s when the group accused his cousin, a Mr. W, of being the culprit.  The man was then forced to lure his cousin to the apartment via Facebook message — he wasn’t allowed to leave until his cousin showed up.  Mr. W was similarly attacked after arriving at the apartment.  “Ms. P hit Mr. W on the head with a frying pan two times … four of the assailants, including the co-accused, rolled him over, and one of the assailants removed his pants and sodomized him with a mop handle.”  According to the court, RCMP conducted a subsequent investigation into the suspected sexual assault of the two young women — police were told “nothing had happened.”   I searched reddit for this link... 4 threads, biggest one has 15 replies.  8chan thread about this story: https://archive.is/ycISC from which i copypasted the above sumup  Article archive for posterity or clicks-denying: https://archive.is/nNCYe"

PussyPass,3bhoqi,jvardrake,19,Mon Jun 29 13:58:08 2015 UTC,"“Ms. P hit Mr. W on the head with a frying pan two times … four of the assailants, including the co-accused, rolled him over, and one of the assailants removed his pants and sodomized him with a mop handle.”   Even in Canada, if someone had done (or had taken part in having done) those 3 things:   Hitting someone in the head with a frying pan. Forcibly removing that someone's clothing. Penetrating that someone with a mop handle.   to a female (especially one that was innocent of what they thought they were avenging here), is there any way in hell that they would have gotten off with a 9 month sentence?  This case is an excellent example of the fact that not only are females afforded  far greater leniency in sentencing, but that any sort of crime perpetrated against them is considered far more severe.

The main problem is incompetant drivers should not be allow to drive around a ton of metal that soars down roads at lethal speeds.  This notion that everyone has a right to drive their own car is such a silly one that has resulted in countless amounts of pointless deaths for so many years now.  Make the drivers test even more strict.  Require it to be taken annually.  Encourage the use/funding of public transit.

Accidents are bullshit. Accidents are people being careless and, if anything, that's an aggravating factor not a mitigating one.  I remember reading a similar story where a woman parked her car on the highway, directly in the lane of travel, with no hazard lights or anything, so that she could help a duck cross the road.  A motorcyclist and his passenger (a father and his young son) rear ended her vehicle and were killed. She had next to no consequences.  She deserved death twice over."

Tribal Courts : Tribal courts are courts governed by the local people living there, and often times they make rulings that would otherwise violate Pakistani Law. A 10 year old boy can be seen as a fully capable adult if he meets certain criteria under these tribal courts. These tribal courts often have mullah's or judges that are extremely uneducated or corrupt. Pakistani Law: Pakistan does have age of consent laws, 16 for women, and 18 for men. It is possible that if the victims family takes this to state courts that the boy may see justice, and the court shutdown. And yes I know Pakistan is a fucked up place. On another note : Do women get punished for adultry? Yes. but VERY VERY rarely. Is there a double standard against women? No. Why? Because the men receive the same punishment. Its oppression of both genders, but feminists always focus on the women.   Edit First time commenting on Reddit trying to fix my formatting."

PussyPass,39xitp,novaquasarsuper,3,Tue Jun 16 01:32:40 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go as far as saying knock her out. He'd probably get in more trouble than it's worth if he did that. He still fucked up royally as a father and I question his protective instincts. When they were getting in the van he says 'she's not even your real mother.'  That means you let a fucking stray put her grubby hands on your children! I mean a mother you have to deal with delicately due to court issues and custody issues. If this bitch's only relation to those kids is the ring he put on her finger then she is a fucking stray. No way you let some bitch off the streets put hands on your children. At the very least put your body between them. Don't just stand there like a dunce while a stray puts hands on your defenseless flesh and blood!

If the guy recording this had laid a finger on that woman, we wouldn't be having this conversation because it wouldn't be on reddit because he'd be in jail (and not for just 1 month either) and she would have deleted the video. He would just be one more statistic of an abusive male. Oh, and his kids would be alone with that woman.  That's reality.

PussyPass,39xitp,TheySayImZack,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:43:24 2015 UTC,"While I sympathize with your explanation of how not to commit murder, I think you may underestimate the potential of some people in the lengths they would go to in order to cover up the perfect crime.  I watched the video, and I'm incensed.  Emotionally, I want to kill her, but like you explained, there are better ways to go about it, especially for the sake of the kids.  With that said, under enough prolonged stress, I could see a person like myself killing her.  I stopped the video at the mark when the father told the son to get into the bedroom and get his shoes on.  I couldn't take anymore.   Trying to put myself in that position, after years of abuse & the same old song and dance by family courts, a properly executed 'disappearance' may be the only reasonable option when the system has failed you.  It's a risk you take, and it's far removed from society's ""acceptable solutions"", but I understand why people would take that risk."

I understand why you would be worried, but as long as the system is working correctly (in this case it is), it's a great system. When it goes wrong, the people work toward getting it corrected. We lobby lawmakers to fix loopholes, we protest, and we bring lawsuits against those responsible for breaking the system."

PussyPass,39yrgz,RedPillJohnny,3,Mon Jun 15 21:51:49 2015 UTC,"This is a horrendous story no matter what angle you view it from but one thing didn't quite add up for me:  ""The conditions quickly became brutal as they were beaten and starved and Lindhout gang-raped. ... One captor puts his assault rifle to her head and plays Russian roulette.""  How does one play Russian roulette with an assault rifle? Its a freaking magazine fed automatic weapon, not a wheel gun. Even if you put it on single shot mode, it either chambers an available round in the magazine or it doesn't if the magazine is empty. I suppose there is a small chance a round could jam in the receiver but if its an AK-47(An assumption I'm making due to the mass quantities of cheap black market AKs that can be purchased for as little as $30 in Africa.) thats less than a minuscule chance; AKs are known to properly chamber and discharge a round even when its internal workings are covered in mud. I'd guess the guy either put the weapon up to her head and didn't pull the trigger or he knew the magazine was empty; this was not Russian roulette.  So was it Amanda who relayed that part of the story? Did the media  not think that was an odd thing to claim? I mean if a not particularly bright man whose only military experience was JROTC can identify that glaring flaw in her story, why can't the press? Are they giving her a free pass on that obvious hyperbole because she had all specifics of her ordeal gang-raped out of her thick skull?  Although what happened to Amanda was beyond atrocious, it shows her to be both obstinately stupid as well as completely and totally lacking in integrity and honesty. She was all too willing to throw Nigel on the spear in order to save herself from the hell the SHE led them into.  Let this teach all men everywhere a lesson: don't ever let a woman lead you around by the nose. Remember, all women will only get involved with you when it is of benefit to them to do so. They view you as ""usefully disposable"" and will not hesitate to take you to slaughter when your death is more benefit to them than you remaining alive.  Homo homini lupus."
PussyPass,39yrgz,mr_matte,3,Tue Jun 16 21:03:23 2015 UTC,"There are people calling Amanda a hero but she was hideously stupid and apparently continues to be. After you are held hostage the moment you enter a country, I think that should generally be the universal sign for ""it gets worse from here"". And then throwing someone else under the bus after she dragged him into it? Her mother doesn't deserve any props if she actually tried to access the Australian account either because that's two stupids at that point.  As for the Russian Roulette with an AK, a very popular and effective form of psychological punishment that a lot of terrorists and cartels (and organised crime families) is one where you drag people out to random spots in the desert/jungle/convenient lonely place and press a gun barrel to their head or neck before pulling the trigger on an unloaded gun.  The psychological torment comes when they do it repeatedly. POWs have reported experiences where members of their group are sometimes actually shot so they can't ever rely on the gun being unloaded. Being that she is a non-Muslim westerner, she's already considered a whore by their standards so they probably felt completely justified in doing the terrible things they did. I'm not saying that it was right, but she did put herself in that position by ignoring all the advice from professionals in the field and any possible survival instincts she may have had.  I know some other people have commented on Nigel and called him a coward but when the AK-47 was placed in his hands at the mosque, he was essentially being tested on his faith and being recruited into the terrorist cell. For him that was probably his test of conscience vs. test of survival because governments do not treat known terrorists very kindly, even if they were pressured into it for whatever reason.  That being said carjackings do happen in Africa outside of terrorist groups by people that borrow their tactics. Benedict Cumberbatch and a film crew were carjacked in Africa and the gun trick was played on them before they were dumped in the desert.  Know your area, trust your gut, be aware, and don't knowingly put yourself in dangerous situations without being prepared for the consequences! And if you do, don't take your friends."

Girlfriend given 10 years after hiding the body. Judge says ""Her newborn baby badly needs a mother's love and breastfeeding"".    Ultimately, the judge was probably more lenient on the girl, because she is a girl, than had it been a guy. However, the actual murderer was the boyfriend.    Mack's defense attorney told the judges that Schaefer killed von Wiese-Mack following an argument over Heather's pregnancy and that no evidence exists to show that the couple planned the murder in advance.

How many male criminals are afforded such a lax interpretation of motivation?  She knew it was wrong but flicked the idea away so that's why she's crazy? No, simply put, she's arrogant.

The court unanimously ruled the law was constitutional, because lawmakers could take account of the danger of pregnancy for teenage girls in such cases.   Isn't pregnancy a danger for men, too? If a 16 year old girl rapes a 12 year old boy and gets pregnant, what happens?"
PussyPass,393zxk,zyk0s,8,Tue Jun 9 23:54:30 2015 UTC,"Courts don't consider being tied to a financial responsibility against your will a danger. Or simply, they don't care about boys.  Now what the supreme court is saying is that the law cannot be made gender neutral in some case. So what's the rationale for making it equal in other cases?"

PussyPass,393zxk,swingmymallet,5,Tue Jun 9 14:58:08 2015 UTC,"Sodomy = non-vaginal intercourse.  Sodomy = a criminal offense you can be charged with.  The word Sodomy comes from Sodom and Gomorrah, a story in the bible about homosexual sex being a sin. That, and the bible pretty much has a passage for any kind of sex that isn't vaginal, and how its bad. Even vaginal is bad if its out of wedlock.  1+1=2  I like turtles."

Usually it will start with two or more women savagely beating each other while any woman who tries to break it up ends up involved.  Then the moment a man tries to get involved all hell breaks loose.  It's wrong for anyone to hit anyone, so thus I agree that it's wrong for a man to hit a woman.  That being said, I see nothing wrong with a man trying to restrain a woman when she's savagely beating another woman, but unfortunately when too much alcohol and testosterone and not enough critical thought come into play, the first guy to try to stop a fight between women will be beaten within an inch of his life by the rest of the room."

PussyPass,38mqgb,ManPlan78,19,Fri Jun 5 05:29:40 2015 UTC,What Josh Duggar did was worse. Not because he is a male but because he went further than Lena Dunham. That being said they are both very fucked up people.
PussyPass,38mqgb,blackarmchair,2,Fri Jun 5 17:38:13 2015 UTC,I agree that the responses were sickeningly different.
PussyPass,38mqgb,oddaffinities,24,Fri Jun 5 22:40:09 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she like really young when this happened? I might be incorrect because I've only read very little but in all the incidents I've read she was like 7 whereas Duggar was a teenager. I'd think that's less about gender and more about how much malintent a 7yr old can really have."
PussyPass,38mqgb,Mariokartfever,17,Fri Jun 5 22:56:26 2015 UTC,This stuff continued on until she was 17.
PussyPass,38mqgb,Xpariah,31,Fri Jun 5 06:00:40 2015 UTC,"Not true. The only thing that happened post-pubescence was that Lena would masturbate while Grace was asleep because they shared a bed as teenagers when Grace asked to and Lena relented. There is absolutely no indication that Lena tried to involve Grace in any way - it's clear from context that she is simply not allowing her sister's presence to stop her from reading Anne Sexton, watching SNL, or masturbating. At worst, that's a little odd. But it is not abuse and certainly not comparable to Duggar repeatedly fondling the breasts and digitally penetrating the vaginas of five girls, including four of his 4-12-year-old sisters, when he was fifteen.  The differential treatment is not about gender. It's about the fact that Duggar's actions meet every legal and psychological criteria for abuse, while nothing Dunham describes does."
PussyPass,38mqgb,Mariokartfever,7,Fri Jun 5 06:08:35 2015 UTC,digitally penetrating   what is this

PussyPass,38mqgb,schrankage,7,Fri Jun 5 18:39:54 2015 UTC,"You should read the article I linked with all the experts affirming that nothing she describes is abusive or outside of developmentally normal behavior - and definitely not illegal. The different reactions are about the fact that Duggar's behavior was, unlike Dunham's, both illegal and abusive, not about gender."
PussyPass,38mqgb,MyNudePepPep,7,Fri Jun 5 07:25:25 2015 UTC,experts? accurate information? isn't that everything she's against?
PussyPass,38mqgb,oddaffinities,4,Fri Jun 5 07:29:50 2015 UTC,"Wait, so you mean what Dunham did to her sister is not considered illegal and abusive, but considered normal, while Duggar does the same thing and is considered illegal and abusive? Both were in the same age group all the way to teens and no one cries foul for her, but only for him? I just pointed this out in the pic!"
PussyPass,38mqgb,schrankage,14,Fri Jun 5 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"It is not the same thing to masturbate next to your sister while she sleeps without remotely involving her than it is to fondle the breasts and digitally penetrate the genitals of five girls including your sisters age 4-12 when you are 15. It is definitely not the same as the kissing games and investigations of prepubescent children with no concept of sexuality. There are experts that decide the criteria for abuse and it is very clear: one is illegal and abusive, and the other is not. Calling them ""the same thing"" is insane and dishonest."
PussyPass,38mqgb,bob_barkers_pants,21,Fri Jun 5 07:39:37 2015 UTC,"You're full of shit. If a male had admitted to what Dunham admitted to, he'd be investigated by the police and black-listed from everything. Dunham wasn't because she has a vagina and no amount of apologizing is going to change that fact. ""Curious"" females who molest young boys and girls almost always get a pass, because when girls do it it's ""innocent, and a natural part of growing up,"" and when boys do it all hell comes down on them for their unnatural perversions. Because they have a dick. And no one gives a shit about boys. No one speaks up for boys, they have no representative. Girls rarely have charges pressed on them, because when charges are pressed, it's usually by a woman. And women tend to help and protect their own, so they don't press charges on girls. And men don't press charges on girls. And again, no one gives a shit about boys. They can rot in juvie or jail, have to register as ""child molesters"" when they're 12 years old (look it up, there are 12 year old registered sex offenders, with their pictures and addresses on freely searchable databases, and it's disgusting). How many teenage girls do you think are registered and on the database? Do you REALLY think that's because girls never do anything with kids? If so, you're deluded and delusional."
PussyPass,38mqgb,SmartFarm,11,Fri Jun 5 07:45:45 2015 UTC,It's both.  The Duggar case is worse AND Dunham is getting a pass because she is a dumpy woman.   Insisting that it's one or the other is a waste of time and unproductive.
PussyPass,38mqgb,blakspeech,-6,Fri Jun 5 15:33:16 2015 UTC,"You have an agenda, and that is why you are trying to shoehorn the Dunham stuff into your worldview when it doesn't fit. We're not talking about whether girls or boys have charges pressed against them more often, we are talking about Dunham.   The law does not prosecute seven-year-olds for molestation because that's absurd. It also does not prosecute 8-12-year-olds for kissing their sisters. It also does not prosecute teenagers for masturbating next to a sleeping sibling they share a bed with without involving them at all. None of that is abuse - read the experts. Period."

But there were other people all around.  Her running away didn't lead to any additional injury or death.  The articles I read didn't state whether she was drunk or speeding, nor did they have any witnesses to estimate her speed.  I fully understand people's flight reaction when something traumatic happens.  Imagine someone being struck right in front of you. Chances are you would not want to stick around and would wish to get as far away from that scene as possible. Yes the responsible thing to do would be to stop, but as I already said, that would not have prevented anything that already did happen from occurring.   The report also stated that she did get out of her vehicle, attempted to hand her keys to a stranger, ect.

If there was no alcohol or anything else illegal that was done when the accident had occurred, then she simply freaked out and ran for no reason (as she would not have been in trouble either way).  And the 3 news stories I read about it mention nothing about her being tested for alcohol and having it in her blood.

But what's most damaging is that feminists believe that men have it better/women have it worse. That doesn't matter. Women are treated unfairly, and that's wrong. Once you start believing that one gender has it better than the other, you start justifying the jealousy, hatred, and start justifying doing bad things to a group of people.  The other half of that statement is that some women really get what on for being women. Some women totally have the life for being women (through benevolent sexism). Same for men. We're too varied to make the statement that one gender has it worse than the other."

And if we approach every situation without the burden of one gender getting the title of 'most descrimination' we will be able to approach each situation openly. If feminism as a whole would approach things this way, the movement wouldn't be so harmful to men, they wouldn't delight in men's issues failing, they wouldn't be so laughable in society (which they are still in many cases). Don't be like a feminist. Don't get caught in that trap."

PussyPass,37y8hq,gmcalabr,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:41:39 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. I wholeheartedly acknowledge that there are many inequities against men, some forming now, some have been there for a long time. There are 100 reasons you or I can give for why men have it worse. There are also 100 reasons that being a woman worse. None of that matters. What matters is that we fix those 100 reasons on each side.  Again, you're pushing me for an answer that's irrelevant to the conversation of moving forward. If I agreed that men have it worse, then you might feel more justified in passing off legit rape cases filed against men, ignoring laws that politicians are passing in my state that make it extremely difficult for women to get an abortion or proper healthcare. When feminists argue that women make 77% of what men do for the same job, it gets women to put on bake sales and sell confections, $0.77 for women, $1.00 for men (yes, I do know that $0.77 is a greatly misused statistic, it's a mediocre example).  To restate a point on my first post, I also think that individual experiences are far too varied to say that one gender has it better or worse. Sure, I'm tired of being shut out for mentioning that something isn't fair to men. I suffer some gender inequality. But I don't suffer gender discriminatory divorce policy (or at least not yet). I've never been belittled for being raped as a man (hopefully never will be). I've never been sat on by some woman in a NY subway for 'manspreading'. I've never had women gang up on me when I was simply defending myself against a female aggressor. I've not suffered many other anti-male inequities. So have I had it worse than most women? Who knows. Everyone's experience is far to different.  So yes, shit's bad, if that's what you're looking for. But no, I won't agree that men have it worse. Not because I believe women have it worse, it's because I refuse to perform the analysis. The forest doesn't matter here, the trees do."

Drama for a bit at one point.  I was also in Apophasis for a while, but at that point I was so burnt out I just couldn't raid anymore and gave up.  I'd also seriously question they are not pushing bleeding edge progression, wow PVE was beyond easy even at top tiers.  You basically had 10-15 decent players and a bunch of dead weight.  Wow PVE was more so about time put in than actual skill level.  The top 10 guilds are better about keeping drama down for obvious reasons, but they're still full of mediocre players being carried by the core.  http://www.arenajunkies.com/user/33936-elorahnahimi/  This is the profile of the account I raided with before quiting the game.  Like I said, I was mainly a pvper (top 5 worldwide multiple times) and the female bullshit was all over the place even there.

I put a lot more time into the game than her, she was less than half my level and none of her skills surpassed mine. However, she was richer than me. How was she richer than me, even though I put more time and effort into making money? Because random people would give her shit, because she was a girl. She would stay in the same spot, start talking to people, befriend them, and ask them for money. She made hundreds of millions this way.   I had another friend who was a guy, yet played as a girl character because, according to him, people were nicer and would be more eager to help him. There was a mod of the game would said in a forum post that he played most MMOs with a girl character because he was treated better.    Anyone who thinks women have it worse than men in gaming are fucking delusional."

If the perpetrator is hot, knowing high school boys (myself included) the chances of it being consensual are vastly elevated, it's simply how sexual attraction works.  That the law considers it illegal is an entirely different matter, fact of the matter remains it's easy to argue that it's less immoral due to it probably being consensual."

PussyPass,37tbp1,Deadonstick,7,Sat May 30 14:14:53 2015 UTC,"You seem to be sort of confused about your setting here.  There is no lesser offense when statutory rape is consensual, that's why the rape is classified that way to begin with.  Reversal of the genders is what makes people see this objectively, or at least see their bias more clearly.  The laws make sense, and not every young person is groomed into a situation where a rape occurs.  Environmental and parenting issues can create young people making poor decisions and you don't have to go further than reddit to find what people would take advantage of those young people if it weren't illegal."
PussyPass,37tbp1,Dnz2,-2,Sat May 30 15:19:15 2015 UTC,"So you're telling me it's illegal because in some cases it might be a case of the minor being taken advantage of. I am opposed to any law that makes ethically grey or even white things illegal so that the black becomes easier to prosecute.  To me this is similar to the Californian consent laws that we're all so opposed to. Yes, it makes real rape cases easier to prosecute, but it also makes fake rape cases easier to prosecute. Most of us here are against a man being arrested for rape for having sex with a drunk woman because ""she couldn't consent"", I am too.  Yet you're for this law? The only way to justify that is saying that a 15-year old is far less capable of making ""right"" decisions than an 18-year old drunk college student.  In a lot of cases, can the minor be taken advantage of? Yes, ofcourse.  Does this mean that if all the signs and evidence point to it being a consensual relationship on both sides, and the younger ""victim"" seems to understand his situation, that it should still be illegal? No.  Environmental and parenting issues can not just create young people, but any person making poor decisions and most of them aren't illegal nor should they be."
PussyPass,37tbp1,JamietheJedi,2,Sun May 31 11:28:50 2015 UTC,"The thing is that at a certain age the general priorities of life change, so where at 15 year old might be trying to fuck 20-30 year olds, they aren't any longer, or have better options."

PussyPass,37ltfd,eternalexodus,16,Sat May 30 05:31:03 2015 UTC,"Well, laws don't give exceptions because someone isn't mad about it.  You can choose not to press charges in a civil case, but not in a criminal case.  That is in the hands of the court.  If someone commits statutory rape, the charges come regardless of if the victim wanted it.  So I highly doubt the dude's opinion matters on the nature of if a crime was committed.  The only part you can really say the guy would be needed for the criminal case to be properly prosecuted.  You'd need him to cooperate, but he is obligated to do so when a crime is reported and he is called as the only witness."
PussyPass,37ltfd,janizary,7,Thu May 28 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"right, but this is where the disconnect between ethics and law sometimes comes into play. if the victim doesn't feel like a victim, or that he was wronged in any way, charges are brought regardless. is it moral to continue due process in this situation? maybe.  I do know that if the genders were switched in this situation, the guy's life would already be ruined, and chances are decent that he'd end up in prison."
PussyPass,37ltfd,eternalexodus,9,Fri May 29 01:58:17 2015 UTC,What about the opposite? What if someone has reasons to feel opressed about something which isn't techically breaking a law? Should the law be rewritten to include that situation? The problem with using guilt as a metric is that some people brush off almost everything while others are offended by everythign they can imagine.  Even worst is that one sex has been ingrained to never feel offended while another one has been raised on using offense and ''priviledge'' as a go-to source of instant redemption for their actions so it would lead to even more sexually biased laws.

PussyPass,37ltfd,suss2it,5,Fri May 29 01:06:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone here considers it rape.  That's not really the point.   The thing is that many feminists say that alcohol automatically prevents the drunk person from giving consent. So if the roles were reversed and she was the drunk one asking for a booty call from a sober man it wouldn't matter what she was doing or saying, they would call it rape.    And no, I doubt anyone here would think that is rape either.  We are pointing out what we think is blatant hypocrisy.  Yes, some people do think this, for example this link   If someone is drunk or high they cannot consent to sex, as they are unable to make clear decisions. If you have sex with someone who is intoxicated and cannot consent, it is rape."

Part of the reason for this sub's existence is that many of us are tired/sick/disgusted by modern feminism and the ridiculous SJW movement.  Unfortunately, when you become their counterpart and make the same ridiculous claims they do (ridiculous selective interpretations of rape), you've become what you despise.  Furthermore, I've absolutely not moved on from name calling. You seem like you have a head on your shoulders so I don't feel quite as much contempt for you, but the majority here deserve nothing more than disdain and contempt. I honestly believe they should be made to feel bad about themselves. They should be shunned.   A decline in masculinity is, in large part, facilitating the very thing they are here to complain about. And these people are insufferable pussies. I honestly believe they deserve nothing better than contempt."

A federal judge in Cleveland recently put that assumption to the test by polling jurors on the appropriate sentence for a man they had convicted of receiving, possessing, and distributing child pornography. On average, they recommended a prison term of 14 months—far shorter than the mandatory minimum (five years), the sentence recommended by prosecutors (20 years), or the term indicated by federal sentencing guidelines (27 years).  This womans sentence of 3months was definitely far below the average.  Pussy Pass confirmed."

But apparently it works, they're on like season 15.  It doesn't even compare to some of his UK shows, where he's an entirely different person (well, he's not, and he still has a temper once in a while. It just feels real legitimate, and not like ""character X made a mistake so he swears at her and calls her a donkey"". He also barely yells, in fact he's an incredible person at being understanding and reasonable.  My favourite show from his is Gordon Behind Bars and in this show he goes into prisons and tries to establish a bakery inside, getting the prisoners working, so they can try and make money, get jobs when they get out, have something to work towards. It was a really heartwarming and amazing show that felt incredible real - the total opposite of the US shows which is blaring epic orchestra while he finds creative ways to call people stupid animals."

They are raised in poverty, in horrible conditions. They have so little of what we have in the West. The ISIS leaders (this goes for any terrorist organisation) will use these poor conditions as well as using religious justifications in order to brainwash young men and women into joining their cause.   They may be intelligent but lack wisdom and so are easily influenced by people they believe will be able to bring them out of these conditions. These young people eventually become the next generation of leaders until their world view is so distorted they cannot see any other way than violence. People don't just do things for no reason. I don't see them as ill, I see them as brain washed.  I do not sympathise with either these Finnish people or with ISIS  and their actions at all and there is no way I'm defending the way they do things, don't get me wrong.

Only then can we begin to teach the male 99% not to rape."
PussyPass,36il07,redditgoogle,12,Wed May 20 03:08:24 2015 UTC,"No, what I was doing was making a joke about the absurd assumption that being a rapist is the default for all men and that all men need to be specifically taught that rape is wrong, otherwise any one of us would never be able to understand that rape is bad."

I maintain that on average a woman is more likely to be raped than a man.  I don't think anyone here disagrees with that, right?    Anyways, the real messed up thing here isn't arguing about nebulous percentages.

Gender matters not in a crime so heinous and damaging. Male or female, those who commit the crime have subjected the victim to an incredibly harmful, traumatic experience and should be brought to justice."

PussyPass,36dqh2,ryuut,4,Tue May 19 11:33:33 2015 UTC,In a state where rape is defined as forcible penetration then all she would've got hit with is sexual assault  or something less until she penetrate his ass with a tool or finger.   Luckily Washington doesn't define rape as such so it just makes it weird that she was wasn't charged with rape in the second degree.

PussyPass,36dqh2,JoshAndArielle,7,Tue May 19 06:34:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Attempted murder carries the same weight as murder, it's just there so that if the person is a dumb fuck retard and fails at murder, they don't get away with assault or something. The same should apply to rape.   Edit ;verbiage."
PussyPass,36dqh2,burningdandelion,4,Tue May 19 02:10:02 2015 UTC,"Well, in that case they would be charged with attempted murder, which I think should carry the same weight as murder."
PussyPass,36dqh2,PrivateCaboose,7,Tue May 19 02:44:11 2015 UTC,"It does carry the same weight. That's the point. If attempted murder wasn't a charge then they would be able to get the punishment of assault or something, since no murder would have actually been committed. That wouldn't be good. So the same should apply with attempted rape. Just because the person want actually able to rape the victim doesn't mean they shouldn't be punished as if they had succeeded."

PussyPass,36dqh2,burningdandelion,4,Tue May 19 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"It's the same logic by which attempted murder is not as serious as actual murder. If you are inept enough that it failed, you are not as dangerous as a successful criminal.  The corrections system has several goals in dealing with convicts:  1) Rehabilitation, where possible. It's better for everyone if a criminal changes their ways and becomes a productive member of society.  2) Containment. Violent criminals are dangerous people, and need to be isolated from the rest of us for the sake of public safety.  3) Deterrence. The threat of punishment is an incentive to obey the law.  4) Retribution. There is a certain element of eye-for-an-eye vengeance to the system.  For the purposes of deterrence and rehabilitation, an attempted crime is essentially the same as a successful crime, but for the purposes of containment and retribution, they very clearly are not."

In terms of justice - philosophical, legal and practical - it isn't a good trade off even if it does encourage / discourage some girls to come forward.  Simple put: A town has a death penalty for horse theft. That towns farmer has a horse go missing. Now, they have a suspect and in the process of trial they break the suspects legs so he won't run.

The more maddening part is that they put stickers on the driver side a number of times, and it looks like all the drivers drove off with it still on.

I don't know about Russia, but putting stickers on someone's property is considered vandalism, and it's illegal.  It would not be that different from spray painting the window.  Obviously the main difference is that it would be harder to take off the paint than it would be taking off the sticker, but it's the same idea.

After testing, it was found that this woman had an abnormally low IQ and had been attending a local church group, and they persuaded her that parts of the Bible required her to have sex with her children.  From what I understand this group was not being monitored by anyone, which is how they got away with arguing it for so long.  My mother wrote in her report that this woman was a nice person, but should not under any circumstances be near children.  Since she was only a PO and not the judge, she didn't know what happened afterwards."

People would had put some stuff about it on the internet, people would be talking, it wouldn't all be swept under the rug!"

If she really had such a low IQ she would have qualified to be handicapped. This means she was either at 80 or higher or there was a faillure of the system to diagnose her, in which case I think she would have a serious defense there because of course we can't assume a mentally challenged person (to the point of not being functional) is able to have a logical understanding of the world around her... and of manipulation.  1970's in a bad neighbordhood in a big city... EXCUSES! Show me a single man who used the ''I was in a bad neighborhood, this excuses my incest your honour'' and walked away with it working.  And I damn well hope the bible study group was researched by the church they used. I surely don't think I could start a bible study group promoting Satan as the one true lord and still be welcomed in that church!  You might not even realise it, but you are making up excuses after excuses for that woman conduct. None of which would sit well if a man tried it.   Let's see this headline in a newspaper:  Low-IQ man living in a high crime neighborhood walks free after blaming bible study group for his incest on his kids.

PussyPass,35qrb2,alien6,1 point,Wed May 13 17:55:43 2015 UTC,"Wow, you're pretty upset.  I gave reasons that explained why she did what she did, and I provided a little background information to help you understand the context.  Neither of those things are excuses.  And I never said she got off scot-free.  I just don't know what happened to her.  In any case, my mother still wrote ""should never take care of children"" in her report, which is what was warranted by her job description.  If I had to guess what happened, I'd say her kids were taken from her and she was ruled not competent to stand trial.  But that would be groundless speculation on my part.  Also, she wasn't diagnosed earlier because she watched so much television that she learned how to pretend to be normal.  They don't routinely test people for mental retardation on the off-chance that they might be terrible parents.  Maybe they ought to, but they don't.  That too is a reason, not an excuse, by the way."
PussyPass,35qrb2,asaasa1983,2,Wed May 13 20:15:36 2015 UTC,"Your comment is so funny. She has an incredibly low IQ yet from watchign TV she was smart enough to mimic the behavior, she was logically capable of interpretting as sane and normal, to manipulate people in her life...  Do you know how fucking SMART you need to manipulate people? Manipulation is a sign of intelligence not of dumbness!  And yes you're making excuses. If she wrote that she has this or that it's EXCUSES as to why she behaved that way. It certainly doesn't sound to me like your mother was putting those as aggravating factors now did she?  What was the reason to put she has a low IQ if not to explain her behavior and try to put it in a more positive light? What was the reason to put she was born and raised in a bad neighborhood if not to excuse the behavior?   Let's put it this way:  Person X is a white female 5'6'' tall with a weight of 120lbs, blue eyes and naturaly brown hairs. She likes going to the cinema and walking during summer days.   Why wouldn't she put those things? Because it's of no interest! The same could be said of her IQ, it's of no interest unless it's made as an excuse for her actions! Her low IQ doesn't explain why she did something wrong. Does everyone with a low IQ commit crime? NO not at all they behave like other people but usually with more problems so the low IQ part IS an excuse!   We're so conditioned to find excuse for woman that we don't even realise when we're doing it and even after an explanation you can't seem to grasp that it would not have been the same for a man and the conclusion certainly would not be as tame as: ""should never take care of children"" it would have been ''legal recourse against his behavior is strongly suggested'' and you know it damn well!"

I was never allowed to use my cell phone in ANY final I took. She gets special accomodation, fails the class for a second time and has the nerve to sue? Jesus christ, where is the sense of personal responsibility?   For treating Burbella differently than the other disabled student, the university should be liable for unspecified damages in excess of $75,000, the lawsuit contends.   Disabled? There was no mention that she is even disabled at all. Not to mention she already got the accomodation of a ""distraction free"" room, so why the fuck would she expect to take the test with everyone else?  This is a clear cut example of someone digging for excuses to avoid any responsibility."

BUT if we read the article, the professor offered her to be able to ask questions during the exam yet failed to respond to her phone calls. Why did the professor even asked to be contacted by phone is beyond me but if a professor engage him/herself into a contract, that person should fill out their obligations. In this case it would be to be available, in person, in e-mail, by phone, by telegram if need be but to be available!  I agree that filling a lawsuit is a bit of an exageration but I can understand her frustration when someone says the exam will allow questions yet not be there to answer them. I think in this case both parties shoulod be held liable. She failed the class twice but the professor clearly did not offer much in the way of help to pass.   To the people who would like to argue a professor is not required to do so... well wrong. We are required to do so almost everywhere and more and more lawsuits are forcing our hands for mentally challenged people. I don't think it's fair to others who work really hard but the courts (at least in Canada) has decided that we have to accomodate them."

In fact, I pass most of my time trying to make guides, find new examples, prepare some mathematical problems for my students.   I would like to tell some of my students: grow a spine and go study but the fact is that with current education, even at college level, professors have a duty to help the students. And if a professor offers some help, I damn well hope he goes through with his/her promise. You can't go on and say you’re going to be available to ask questions and not be available. BUT you can certainly say no questions are allowed during the test. The difference is that in the second case the student knows what to expect, in the second case it's a useless cause of increased stress.  Sure the girl had to hold her weight but to me it seems like a professor enacting vengeance on the student by setting her up for failure. Keep in mind I say this as a professor who’s seen as being an asshole to students, I just guess there I have some decency in not offering some help and withdrawing it after the fact."

Likewise, you no doubt watched a host of ""war"" and other exciting ""action"" films, and engaged in various dreams or fantasies about being some ""uber special forces"" dude in live-fire urban warfare, or some jet-pilot in an aerial combat, or being a fireman who enters burning buildings, or an EMT who rescues people from nasty car crashes, etc. -- but I think I can say with ZERO uncertainly that you were in no way equipped to handle any of those things actually happening in real life either.

And then when someone who got tied to an operation table to not only get penetrated but forcefully removed all of her reproductive organs says she feels like a monster because of it it's... portraying infertile woman in a bad light.   So funny. Dick in vagina = feeling like a monster, getting organs removed forfully = get over it movie writers.  I'm pretty sure if we took a woman, tied her to an operation table, sedate her and remove her reproductive organs against her will she wouldn't fell all fine and dandy saying: Well you know what? At least I won't get ovary cancer! Badam-ching!  Seriously feminist, she has as much reason to feel like a monster than banner does. And it is implied that she had those organs removed in order  to be a better killer, which she seemed to become. Yet she left Russia (or USSR, whichever) because of what she had done. She doesn't feel like a monster because of that procedure only but because she followed what people wanted from her and now realise just how much damage she did to protect things in which she doesn't believe anymore.

PussyPass,34t3f1,asaasa1983,88,Mon May 4 15:09:54 2015 UTC,Look up Kara Hultgreen. Navy and Airforce were competing to see who could get the first female pilot or something. The navy gave her her wings despite failures in training. She ended up crashing her plane. They told her she was ok to fly when she wasn't. They killed her. This shit has to stop.
PussyPass,34t3f1,a_midgets_last_stand,66,Mon May 4 13:15:09 2015 UTC,"No sorry, SHE killed herself. And in doing so damaged public property for millions.  She knew she didn't passed the test. She knew she was not as competent as her male teammates. SHE still decided to get inside the plane cockpit and fly that damn airplane.   We, as a society, need to stop blaming other people for women problems. Not only did she kill herself but in doing so she destroyed the credibility of having female pilots. Sure now there are some but it gave a bad reputation to female pilots which they are still struggling to get over."
PussyPass,34t3f1,asaasa1983,39,Mon May 4 15:34:34 2015 UTC,"If I failed some tests but the military still told me I was ok to fly, then I'd reckon I was ok to fly."
PussyPass,34t3f1,a_midgets_last_stand,23,Mon May 4 15:44:22 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt it. Most people are able to self-analyse. It's easy for you to say this right now because your life is not in danger. But would you go drive a formula 1 at 300km/h if you failed your driving license? (I mean the actual driving part, there's no stop sign on a racing course!)   (...)despite receiving low scores from her instructors and having four ""downs"" or indicators of an unsatisfactory performance (one or two of which usually can end an aviation career).   Let me get this straight: You get FOUR red flags during your training, two of them should see you BANNED from flying. Your other grades are low. This is not she did 59 on a test which she needed a 60 on. This is she totally fucked up ALL of her training, she was not that poor kid in grade 12 that tries to get the passing grade and ends up begging the teacher for a few bonus points. She was the kid who did not follow since grade 6, nothing got better yet got handed a diploma with: well you're the first vagina we had here so it counts as a 10 points bonus.  Let me get this straight now: You know you're going into a dangerous (life threatening) job. You are asked to do things to prove you are good to do. You fail systematically all of those. Someone tells you four MAJOR errors you made, someone else said: just by doing this and that you'd get yourself killed. Yet you would say: ah brush that aside, what does those people who pretty much invented the whole subject knows, I know myself, I'll ace that shit when comes the time.  I know it's hard to do, but you ARE giving her a pussypass right now. Blaming the navy instead of her. The navy never told her she got passing grades when she didn't. She was supposed to be smart enough to either re-take the classes or apply for another position in the army."

PussyPass,34t3f1,Joelasaur,6,Mon May 4 18:33:24 2015 UTC,"Playing devil's advocate- you have no idea what they told her or did not tell her. Perhaps they downplayed the importance of the grades and promised to start off slow with basic trainer aircraft and work her way up when she's ""more capable"" to faster aircraft. It seems as though that's exactly what they did, actually, and this;    she totally fucked up ALL of her training   Isn't true.   Upon graduation (ranked third of seven in her class) she was assigned to Training Air Wing FOUR at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas for primary flight training with VT-27 in the T-34C Turbomentor. Screened for the Strike Pilot training pipeline, she underwent follow-on training in the T-2C Buckeye and TA-4J Skyhawk II with Training Air Wing THREE at NAS Chase Field, Texas. Following designation as a Naval Aviator, she received orders to fly EA-6A Prowlers with Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron THIRTY-THREE (VAQ-33) at NAS Key West, Florida. Upon the Navy's integration of women in combat in 1993, LT Hultgreen was selected to be among the first female pilots to undergo F-14 Tomcat training at NAS Miramar, California.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Hultgreen  I'm guessing if they were that desperate to push her through, they were probably quite manipulative about it as well. It's not the equivalent of failing a driver's test and then being putting in a formula 1 car. She didn't go from multiple choice tests to the F-14 overnight. Even today pilot's don't start out on F-22s. After flying a number of hours on trainer aircraft and less powerful aircraft, they probably built up overconfidence in her and told her she was ready for the F-14- and she wasn't.   Edit: For the record, I'm not entirely excusing her, but if you're saying the government has no blame here, you're wrong."

Imagine someone encouraging them for years and then giving them a Ferrari."

Calling stories like this a pussy pass really takes away from the stories that truly are.  Lady was hit with 14 felonies & was facing life in prison.

If they took an evaluation of the victim of any gender in edge cases, for example 16+, they could determine whether the individual involved was capable of making that decision.

PussyPass,34ia0o,BrotyKraut,1 point,Sat May 2 00:00:01 2015 UTC,"A changing plea isn't considered perjury because it's essentially an opinion on whether or not you're guilty of a crime. it's not saying whether or not you actually committed the actions. For example, you can plead not guilty to murder because you killed the person in self defence even though the action that they're charging you for happened.  Essentially perjury doesn't cover opinions. It covers misrepresentation of events/facts."

He was 18 she was 15 and looked more mature than my GF at the time who was 20 fuckin 3.  Guess he should have checked her ID and cross referenced it with her birth certificate.  Her ID was fake.  She bought cigarettes and such in my presence.    She was found out by getting preggo.  She left a list of about 10 men in her room trying to figure out who the father was.

PussyPass,34adry,whosthisguythinkheis,1 point,Fri May 1 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"ple will defend it, mostly because its happened to them and they don't want to accept they've been violated. its pretty obvious when you look at women who are victims of FGM they will berate women who haven't been victimized as a way to reconcile it to themselves in places where it is common.   i didn't say you were violated in particular i was talking about male circumcision there. i simply stated you are going to be biased towards supporting and agreeing with spanking kids as you yourself have been spanked.  i did not say you were being violated. you took that from what i wrote yourself.  however people outside of a relationship are best to see if someone is being abused, people being abused are generally the most blind to it. so actually people outside that relationship literally are the best people to tell you whether or not you have been abused.   despite that, i still didn't say you were violated."

There is a difference between spanking a child who misbehaves, smacking a dumbass kid who is participating in rioting and looting, and straight up beating a child. The first two are not abuse, the latter is. But yet all the pansy ass liberal fcks who want nothing but keep children in a giant protective bubble and we can never hurt their precious little sensibilities for fear that they MIGHT one day snap and hurt someone else. It's getting to the point where you can't even raise your voice or use a single cross word towards a child when they need to be punished or disciplined. Fck that."

PussyPass,34adry,HidekaValheim,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:39:42 2015 UTC,"NOTHING good comes from hitting children.   that's a matter of your opinion. i believe Einsteins quote of ""if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing its stupid"". i believe the same mentality rings true to raising a child. if you teach a child his whole life that there are not physically harmful consequences for breaking a rule, then they will grow up thinking that they can do anything and become a sociopath and get a nice seat on death row.   the proper answer is- it falls to the parent to know their child well enough to mete out the appropriate punishment on a case by case basis - be it a Physical, mental, or laborial punishment.   i catch my son using a weapon to threaten or terrorize someone, im most certainly tearing that ass to pieces - because he needs to understand that its a potential consequence of his actions. if i just went ""oh its ok honey, go to your room and think about what you have done"" i am reinforcing the notion in his head that there are no severe punishments.   TL/DR: id have whipped that ass too- even though i know it would result in an assault charge because of the dick between my legs."

You're right, I'd probably feel outraged. But we're not talking about a guy overpowering his daughter and beating her. We're talking about a teenager who could easily defend himself or outrun that woman.  We're talking about a guy who was part of a mob that was burning down homes, businesses, and senior centers, then cutting fire hoses. We're talking about someone old enough to be responsible for their actions, who's part of a mob that's looting stores, destroying property, and terrorizing people.  He may not have stolen anything, set the fires, flipped any cars, or cut the hoses, but he's adding to the chaos. He's one more body making it ""more okay"" to do these things. Remember that no individual snowflake ever feels responsibility for the avalanche.  That guy deserves a whole hell of a lot more than a couple of whacks from Mom and national humiliation. I'm not saying beating a teenager is the best choice for discipline, but if it's a viable choice for anyone, the people rioting sit at the top of that list."
PussyPass,34adry,m1kepro,-3,Fri May 1 12:40:19 2015 UTC,"Are you insane?   What do you think this guy will learn? It's ok to slap, hit and beat up other people if you're in a position of authority and you feel what the other person is doing is wrong.  Not only is the mother laughable but what kind of message you think she's sending him? Violence is fine as long as someone in authority is attacking someone who cannot retaliate.   Her child is most likely still living under her roof so telling her to stfu is not even an option to him.   Don't ask yourself: is it ok for her to hit him in this circumstance. Ask yourself: why did he partake in such manifestation? Most likely because his mother always used violence to ''raise him'' and he was raised in a climate where it's fine to act that way.  I hate to be that person but it seems like it needs to be said: Why do we never see that kind of problem arising in white neighborhoods? I could understand Fergusson as a white on black violence but this time it's a black mayor, a black police commisioner, it's not a white people in charge protecting white police officers. There is absolutly no reason why this is happening. They left no time for peaceful enquirys. So why where young black people protesting in such a way? Why where they burning stuff? Why do they think it's justified to destroy other things while at the same time demanding that police officers are more tolerant to them?   Basically: there is something wrong with the way those people are behaving. And of course white people did play a part in all of this. of course white people abusing black people goes back a long time. But isn't it time that those people stop acting this way and make real effort to help themselves? You can bring a horse to a river but can't force it to drink. Black people are happy to say how white people fucked them over but without determination from themselves, there is no way we can make things better.   I know a lot of people will see me as a racist, but what I'm trying to say here is that unless they tone down their reactions, they are only continuing a cycle of violence and nothing will get any better if they continue to answer with violence and petty destruction of property. And the first person who should do this are the parents raising their kids. They are the ones who should show good manner and slapping your kid to encourage him to be... non-violent is probably the most stupid way to make your point!"

PussyPass,33zolq,labiaflutteringby,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:38:57 2015 UTC,"My argument is that one isn't worse than the other, and that both sides are committing the same crime - distributing child pornography.  Just because one of them is distributing it to individuals and another is distributing it publicly, that doesn't make one more wrong than the other. Otherwise, how many people do you have to distribute child porn to before it's a crime?"
PussyPass,33zolq,eDgEIN708,-1,Mon Apr 27 15:57:12 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't just the distribution of nude photos. It's the non consensual distribution of the photos.   Child pornography laws were designed to harshly punish adults who sexually exploit children. Trying to simplify it as ""distributing child pornography,"" ignores the agency of the teenagers we're talking about.   If you would, forget about the whole ""child pornography"" thing for a minute. If  adult #1 sent a nude picture to adult #2, and adult #2 then puts that picture up on Instagram without permission, would you still be saying that these two people did something equivalent in terms of wrongness?"

Yeah, like we could ever see officers strapping a girl down and forcing her to get sopping wet down below via stimulation, just to prove that the Box-Shot she sent the kid down the street is actually her. There'd be total outrage, from regular society and feminists alike! And rightfully so! No such outrage when it happens to a guy, though..."
PussyPass,33zolq,Destroya12,-1,Mon Apr 27 15:45:08 2015 UTC,My question is under what circumstances did the girls send the pictures? If they were threatened or something then I'd understand. Do we even know if the boys solicited the pictures from them or did they offer to send them?

Kid calls her his girlfriend, he's almost 18, but because he's not he's automatically a victim here and his 'girlfriend' gets arrested for it. Can't imagine he's too happy about this.  These stories are just as much about our oversimplified age laws as they are about gender.  I'm not saying the typical 'teenage boys all love sex with hot teachers' shit. I'm saying many of them do and they should be able to say in court, ""I consented."" and if they are deemed of sound mind then sure, the court should admit they consented.  Teacher-student relationships are bad in and of themselves, but rape is a much more severe charge and it's always assumed it was rape because of the age of consent laws."
PussyPass,33xeiy,d3m0n0gr4ph1c,5,Sun Apr 26 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"My bad for missing the fact that 2 others came forward, thanks for the correction.  As for the last point, that's what I'm saying is wrong. Every 17 year old is not incapable of giving consent, so the laws do not match with reality here. It's possible 1 or more of them may have come forward with allegations only because they knew it was illegal even though they may have consented."

This is such a stupid argument and I'm tired of hearing it, and I'm against most legal age restrictions.  Just because you're allowed to join the military at 18 doesn't mean you're ready to or should be allowed to do anything else at 18; it's a logical fallacy. Two wrongs don't make a right, etc. All the age requirement for joining the military indicates is that the government decides that at that age you can join the military; it has no bearing on the quality of an 18 year old's judgement or reasoning skills. If anything, the argument that ""it's not fair that you can fight in a war at 18 but you can't drink until you're 21"" just means that they should raise the age requirement to fight in a war. Not to mention the fact that military service and the consumption of alcohol are two totally different things. Like comparing apples and M1 Abrams tanks.  Again, I'm totally for the cause, I just hate hearing that phrase."

(edit: charging multiple times for the same repeated act with one individual is a scare tactic used by prosecutors to get the defendant to plea)  3 years will be a pussy pass, 45 will not. I'm 99% sure they have to at minimum sentence her to 3 years at this point. I'm going to hazard a guess she'll serve 18 months if she has no prior record with an extended parole to 5+ years.  I'm a guy who wishes I had been able to sleep with a teacher or two at 15 or 16. I also think it's important to stress statutory rape is hugely different than saying she raped them."
PussyPass,33xeiy,ThisVersionOfMyself,3,Sun Apr 26 17:49:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've said this before - they should stop insulting the word rape (and I say this as a person that hates pseudofeminism - as in the tumblr kind) by calling consentual sex with a post pubescent teenager rape.  They should just call it for what it is - sex with an under age person.  And escalate it to ""sex with a child"" when it's with a much younger person (I dunno, 14 or so?).  I mean I guess you CAN call it rape if it gets to that level and they don't know what sex is, but I know for sure that I knew what sex was by age 15 and that if a teacher offered and I accepted that now, over 10 years later, I still wouldn't have considered it ""rape"".  But yeah, if my fourth grade teacher did it, I wouldn't have known the implications and I'd have been somewhat more open to calling it rape."

My good friend has his son 80% of the tome and he even pays child support.

Or asked them to remove him from the house? No she play the all is good card and then BOOM take that bullet to the face motherfucker.  Since all her family seems to be on her side, she had other options to pursue than staying there to continue the violence cycle. I seriously doubt he was that bad and she was an angel.

(I'm a bot)     Last fall, Columbia University senior Emma Sulkowicz began carrying a mattress around campus - a protest, she said, of how the school handled her sexual assault complaint against a fellow student.  Now Nungesser is suing his school, its board of trustees, its president and one of its professors, saying that Columbia failed to protect him from a ""Harassment campaign"" by Sulkowicz even after a school disciplinary panel cleared him of responsibility in the case.  The lawsuit alleges that Nungesser's rights were violated by Columbia and its officials for supporting Sulkowicz, and by professor Jon Kessler for approving the mattress-carrying piece as her senior thesis.

PussyPass,33iqk2,WPKage,10,Thu Apr 23 02:45:27 2015 UTC,"eh, I don't really trust the state to be the judge of who should live or die. Wasn't there a case a few months ago, a guy's wife was murdered or something and he was accused, the DA had evidence that proved his innocence but withheld it and had him thrown in jail for like 20-30 years. Finally the guy was exonerated and released a little while ago and the DA (who was then a judge) was charged and sentenced to like 10 days. Of which he served like 5."
PussyPass,33iqk2,WPKage,-4,Thu Apr 23 03:08:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but when you're writing laws you've gotta keep write them based on how they'll apply 99.99% of the time to 99.99% of people.  That incident wasn't the result of an error in the system. That was the result of the DA committing another crime.  Essentially, don't write laws and try and account for corruption. Deal with corruption like the second issue that it is."
PussyPass,33iqk2,sailorJery,7,Thu Apr 23 03:17:22 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm pessimistic but I think that 99.99% is a little bold. If anything it shows how easily (and nearly undetectably) one corrupt person (and honestly I think it's more than one since he didn't even get locked up for 10 days) can twist the system like that.  If the state had killed him wouldn't the just thing be then to kill the judge?

I think the only laws that should exist are ones that if anyone found anyone breaking them it would be justifiable for them to kill them on the spot. So things like, rape, murder, breaking into someone's house, etc.  All petty laws do is slowly extort people while offering no protection and inevitably, no matter now mundane the law is, it will eventually be used to justify killing/mutilating someone.  Just look at how many people are dead because of weed. I just can't wrap my head around justifying paying people to round up and imprison/extort/kill people for smoking/growing a plant while (statistically speaking) about 1/2 of the people charged with doing the rounding up/killing will go home at the end of the day, drink alcohol and beat their wives.

PussyPass,33hxvv,beatbox_pantomime,4,Wed Apr 22 18:30:43 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm a bit curious as to why they dropped the charge against her, given that accomplices are held as guilty as the primary, when a crime has been committed. If info comes out giving another reason for why she was given leniency, especially given that the law insists she be held just as culpable as the principal for the actions committed, than simply being female, then feel free to remove the submission. Until then, I still say it reeks of the preferential treatment women receive by our justice system on a regular basis.  Also, I am not surprised at the allegations.

PussyPass,32xlfo,zaturama008,17,Fri Apr 17 17:09:31 2015 UTC,"Karla Homolka:       Karla Leanne Homolka, also known as Karla Leanne Teale and Leanne Bordelais (born 4 May 1970 in Port Credit, Ontario, Canada), is a convicted Canadian serial killer who helped her husband rape and murder at least three women. She attracted worldwide media attention when she was convicted of manslaughter following a plea bargain in the 1991 and 1992 rape-murders of two Ontario teenage girls, Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French, as well as the rape and death of her sister Tammy.   Homolka and Paul Bernardo, her husband and partner in crime, were arrested in 1993. In 1995, Bernardo was convicted of the two teenagers' murders and received life in prison and a dangerous offender designation, the full maximum sentence allowed in Canada. During the 1993 investigation, Homolka stated to investigators that Bernardo had abused her, and that she had been an unwilling accomplice to the murders. As a result, she struck a deal with prosecutors for a reduced prison sentence of 12 years in exchange for a guilty plea for manslaughter.  However, videotapes of the crimes were later found that demonstrated that she was a more active participant than she had claimed. As a result, the deal that she had struck with prosecutors was dubbed in the Canadian press the ""Deal with the Devil"". Public outrage about Homolka's plea deal continued until her high-profile release from prison in 2005.  Following her release from prison, she settled in the province of Quebec, where she married again and gave birth to a boy. In 2007, the Canadian press reported that she had left Canada for the Antilles with her husband and their baby, and had changed her name to Leanne Teale.  In 2012, journalist Paula Todd found Homolka living in Guadeloupe, under the name Leanne Bordelais, with her husband and their three children.  On 17 October 2014, the jury in the first-degree murder trial of Luka Magnotta heard that Karla Homolka is living in Quebec.

But what I'm saying is that everyone who wants a seat has one and the reason why the two standing people aren't saying anything is because they are about to get off the train soon.  Of course I'm speculating on that last part but i think you're also speculating when you call all those people pussies because they couldn't visibly confront the woman in the fraction of a second it took to capture this photo."

In fact, there's even a spare seat between the woman lying down and the woman beneath her, so perhaps the man was sitting there in the first place.  I really have no idea how you people get so pissy about this minor stuff. If we had proof someone asked her to sit up, or she deliberately stayed laying down knowing someone needed a seat, sure.

The main motivator of the most ardent supporters of this ideological crusade seems to be righteous indignation (being offended on the behalf of themselves and especially others). It is this ""righteous"" anger that fuels the core of the movement, there is no group of elites intervening at this stage.  The excessive coverage in the main stream media is not motivated by political ideology, it is because of money. The 24 news cycle will devour and promote any salacious story they can get their hands on. Saucy stories draw viewers and viewers draw advertising dollars. People crying rape and rape culture is very saucy.  I know those on the right are eager to blame a hidden elite for whatever facet of the culture war they perceive to be losing, or even as a counter for the explicit actions of right wing elites like the Koch brothers. In many instances I might agree with them, those with wealth wield a ridiculous amount of power over public discourse. However, they are not omniscient and, as comforting it would be to believe that there is some shadowy group responsible for promoting this trend, I do not believe such a force is responsible for this. They may very well benefit, for the same reasons stated in the video (which I also disagree with), and these powerful figures may not fight against such social forces, but that does not mean they are responsible for it."

That doesn't seem so bad...oh wait...until you start thinking that these girls don't deserve to be in a STEM program if they can't make it on their own.  And I'm not saying that women shouldn't be allowed to do these careers, they definitely are capable and should be encouraged to do so, but not when they are given inflated egos because of bonus points on a test score.  If someone is given free points in school to fast track them for STEM careers, they won't be properly prepared for the work that it entails.  STEM work is about actually knowing the material, much like most careers, so getting a free pass and not learning the material properly will only hurt them in the long run.  (hint hint, learning involves having a mistake and correcting it, not just told you did good enough and be on your way.)

She actually talked about feminist issues in class. All of the male students suddenly found that they couldn't get a passing grade on many of their papers no matter how hard they worked. All of the female students who had done poorly in previous Honors english courses suddenly found that they were getting easy A's.  Since this teacher gave us work that was all about subjective analyses of literature, she could get away with saying one paper was good and another was bad solely on the ""quality of the content,"" which was something only she could judge. We were all bright students, so she almost never found spelling or grammar errors. It was all about her subjective feelings about the content, supposedly. Realistically, it was about her subjective feelings about the gender of the student.  Others who looked at the papers would often see that the male students' papers were far better in every way, partially because we'd put many hours into each paper trying to get a C or better, while the female students could drift by with barely any effort.  Three male students who had all A's and B's in every previous Honors class failed her class, while female students who had never gotten an A in Honors English ended that year with an A in her class.  This was not by any means the only example of feminist grade-skewing I noticed in school, but it was probably the most dramatic.  Now, I'm seeing it in the young kids of my extended family. The boys are struggling while the girls are being given easy A's, even while, when questioned, they clearly don't know the material nearly as well as the boys."
PussyPass,32n7l8,Viklove,8,Wed Apr 15 21:02:48 2015 UTC,The boys are struggling   The boys are not struggling.  They are being abused by these feminists teachers.  They are trying to work within a system in which they cannot win.

Sounds a wee bit too similar to my experience except that we had a parallel English class taught by a male teacher. By the end of the semester I was (foolishly) one of three boys left in the female teacher's class. All of the other boys had either dropped the course or transferred to the other class.  Funny thing is, everyone knows why she's so bitter. When she was a new teacher, she ""accidentally"" slept with one of her students. The student was 18 and the board wanted to keep things quiet so she was moved out of that school (with a lifetime ban).   Personally I think they should have just fired her, but the going assumption is that she either has dirt on someone or has threatened to bring a discrimination suit (or both)"

This might be one case where the pussypass is well and truly valid.
PussyPass,327n2y,capontransfix,13,Sat Apr 11 15:56:18 2015 UTC,Why are they different?
PussyPass,327n2y,BobaFettuccine,-20,Sat Apr 11 16:28:37 2015 UTC,"Because two different things often have differences which differentiate them from one another.  Edit: I though giving a brainless answer to a witless question would be okay in a humorous sub like pussypass.  Apparently not.  Real answer is this: men and women are not identical.  Equal? Sure.  But, as people in this sub are supposed to understand, equal does not mean identical.  Women and men, biologically and psychologically, have different gender roles.  The point of /r/pussypass is to call out those who seek to play the gender card only when it suits them.  For instance, the feminist who punches a dude in the face on this sub yesterday when he jokingly protested for ""menenism"" .   I'm not saying what they did to that boy wasn't a crime, or wasn't wrong.    Show of hands, who here (guys only), would have felt violated if two of his female high-school teachers, both moderately attractive, came onto him and wanted him to have a threesome with them.  Would he feel as vulnerable and violated as your average teenaged girl being solicited for a three way by male teachers?"

PussyPass,327n2y,sockmess,-6,Sat Apr 11 18:19:49 2015 UTC,"Well, it would obviously depend on the specifics, and I'm not sure top/bottom is the same as pitcher/catcher, but I would say that if the student is the one doing the penetrating, it would be harder to argue that he was being coerced.  If he is underage, it is illegal and it shouldn't be happening at all, just as is the case with any teacher/student sexual liaison."
PussyPass,327n2y,capontransfix,2,Sat Apr 11 18:30:58 2015 UTC,"The pitcher is the one giving the dick, the catcher is the one receiving the dick. While some gay men stick to one role, some switch up roles during the sexual act that they both be catcher and pitcher."

PussyPass,327n2y,431854682,-5,Sat Apr 11 19:41:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't say they make up for it; I was saying they are factors relevant to just how egregious a crime was committed.  A 15 year old boy can be tried as an adult in a criminal case, he can drive a car under supervision, he can legally father a child...but if he has consensual sex with a creepy thirtysomething woman, he immediately becomes a child and she immediately becomes a monster?  I just don't think these teacher/student relationships are always so cut-and-dried, and I think it is probably more often the case with female perpetrators than male perpetrators that the young person is not coerced.  I am not saying any of these examples are not crimes."
PussyPass,327n2y,capontransfix,3,Sat Apr 11 20:05:59 2015 UTC,"Well I believe that teachers shouldn't diddle kids.  If they want to, then they should wait until they are no longer in a position of authority above them before beginning to pursue a relationship.

I think, however, that you are putting words in my mouth, and not really reading what I'm saying before judging.  That is partly my fault by starting off trying to be a funny smartass.  But...    doesn't mean these types of relationships are ever in the best interest of the student. The teacher is still taking advantage.   I never said any of that.  I said one is is not quite as bad as the other.  From the same post you are characterizing, I said quite clearly:   I am not saying what they did to that boy wasn't a crime, or wasn't wrong.    You're taking my comments about some moral grey area, and casting them as in black and white. Like I said that is partly my fault for starting off snide, and I offer my apology for that.

PussyPass,327n2y,capontransfix,2,Sun Apr 12 16:56:51 2015 UTC,"what makes this an unsafe place? Do you feel threatened by my statement? I thought about what you said, and the implication I got from it was that a guy would enjoy a threesome with 2 female teachers. I got that implication because of how people treat men getting sexually harassed. They think the guy is lucky and should be happy for being harassed or raped, instead of being violated. Many people do not recognize female on male rape as rape. In government rape reports, its called ""Forced penetration"" and carries less weight than a male raping a female.  Judging from your previous posts in this thread, you do not think that a male getting raped by a female is as bad as the other way around.   a 40 year old woman having sex with a 15 year old boy isn't as bad as a 40 year old man having sex with a 15 year old girl   Of course this is a circlejerk sub.

PussyPass,3297jf,RX300,6,Sat Apr 11 18:48:54 2015 UTC,"How is this a ""Pussy Pass""?  She was sentenced to 20 years to Life in prison for a second degree murder charge, pretty common sentencing.  Additionally, it can be considered controversial that she was criminally charged at all, as this woman very likely has a mental illness called ""Münchausen syndrome by proxy""   Münchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP or MBP) is a behaviour pattern in which a caregiver fabricates, exaggerates, or induces mental or physical health problems in those who are in their care.[1] With deception at its core, this behaviour is an elusive, potentially lethal, and frequently misunderstood form of child abuse[2] or medical neglect[3] that has been difficult to define, detect, and confirm.  MSbP has also spawned much heated controversy within the legal and social services communities. In a handful of high-profile cases, mothers who have had multiple children die from sudden infant death syndrome have been declared to have MSbP. Based on MSbP testimony of an expert witness, they were tried for murder, convicted, and imprisoned for several years. In some cases, that testimony was later impeached, resulting in exoneration of those defendants.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchausen_syndrome_by_proxy"

PussyPass,3297jf,sammyhere,-2,Sat Apr 11 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"20 years is far too light. She intentionally poisoned and dried out the insides of her kid with Morton (or some other brand with a picture of an umbrella) knowing that she would kill her child (is dumping salt down your throat not painful?)  Mental illness is not an excuse for a heinous crime against children. Anyone can claim it in court and display traits that show up on tests to get a lighter sentence.  Society locks up people because they have violated the law (NOO, murder is totally acceptable because you have a syndrome of sorts!), indicating that they are a threat to society. The reason they are lighter is simply because of motive: It can be inferred that the woman may not have had complete control over herself. Combine this with the fact that females tend to get lighter sentences and you have a little loophole. Whether she did it in full consciousness or as a result of her disability does not change the fact that she is a threat to society by killing her own child.  I would say if she wasn't a woman the sentence would be far heavier.  edit PS: citing a Wikipedia article in this case is highly questionable to proving your point. It states right in quotes that it is a controversial topic. This goes to show that the sentence itself had less to do with the disability itself rather than some other factor: can you guess what it is?"
PussyPass,3297jf,TheGuyWhoDoesHisJob,3,Sat Apr 11 21:50:48 2015 UTC,"20 years is far too light   Actually, in the state of NY, the prison sentence for Second Degree Murder is 15 Year - 25 Years to Life.  You could definitely argue that she should have been charged with First Degree Murder. However, the sentence for First Degree Murder in the state of NY is 20 - 25 Years to Life.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_punishments_for_murder_in_the_United_States#New_York   Mental illness is not an excuse for a heinous crime against children   I'd generally agree, but a lot of people would not agree at all.  Many mental illnesses, including MSBP can completely change someone's motive.  The point I'm making is exactly what I said:  ""Additionally, it can be considered controversial that she was criminally charged at all"" because she has a mental illness. I'm not saying she shouldn't have been charged.  However, many people would completely disagree with this ruling, because she does very clearly show signs of having MSBP.   It can be inferred that the woman may not have had complete control over herself. Combine this with the fact that females tend to get lighter sentences and you have a little loophole. Whether she did it in full consciousness or as a result of her disability does not change the fact that she is a threat to society by killing her own child   Other than her getting a lighter sentence, because she really didn't, I would agree.   I would say if she wasn't a woman the sentence would be far heavier.   Again, probably wrong.  She got a very normal sentence for Second Degree Murder in the state of NY.  Many (not myself) would argue that she was sentenced too strictly, because, like you said, she probably didn't have full control over herself because of MSBP.  And Wikipedia is completely fine to cite.  It states that, yes, it's a controversial topic, because that's the point I'm making.  It states that many rulings of sentencing from MSBP are very controversial in the legal community because it can be considered a mental illness that strongly affects motive."

PussyPass,31v4ms,WhiteMarauder,6,Thu Apr 9 01:01:15 2015 UTC,"Truth. Therefor, the arresting body should be held responsible for keeping the identity of the accused private until they're proven guilty. Also, It should be illegal for the press to publicise the name of someone being accused of committing a sex crime until they're proven guilty. Also, the accuser, or anyone for that matter, should be held criminally responsible if they spread the accuseds name to the general public if the accused is found not guilty. So they wouldn't be charged with filing a false report or committing perjury, they'd be charged with criminal defamation and whatnot. But only if they were to spread the persons ID. That way, there wouldn't be pressure to not come foreward, but there would be pressure to not publicise the matter. That wouldn't be a problem for a scared or timid person anyway. I can see how this might be a difficult thing to prosecute, but it's better than nothing."
PussyPass,31v4ms,PussyPass,3,Thu Apr 9 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with all your propositions. However, all the proceedings are in the public domain. If you truly wanted to, you could find that woman's identity with a freedom of information act request. The arresting agency will legally have to supply you with that information - however, neither the arresting agency nor the media have any responsibility to publish either parties names.  It's like...you're free to know it, but you have to go get it yourself, no one's just going to publicize it recklessly.  After all, think about being the owner of a smaller media outlet. Despite what your morals are telling you to do, good business sense dictates that it would be an unnecessary risk to publish the accusers name. Feminist would scream victims blaming and attack your paper.  Right or wrong, the media has to adapt it practices around the feminist narrative as well as individuals.   Anyway, we're on the same page - I'm just pointing out a few of the unfortunate obstacles to the type of justice we would like to see. Personally, if I was that driver, I would privately publish the name of that woman. I would find her workplace and alert her supervisors. Do whatever I could to ruin that woman's reputation while staying within the law.  Everyone should know the intricacies of their local laws.

Assistant District Attorney Sophia Polites said the teen's grades dropped significantly following the statutory rape, and that even today he has trouble in social interactions.   The ADA is making it seem like this teacher ambushed him after school and violently raped him with a strap-on or something. But instead what appears to be the case is they had a consensual relationship (Whether or not the law recognizes it), based on the fact he was showing pictures off to his friends in class. Just because the law doesn't allow a teenager to consent before a given age, should not mean the prosecution can paint the teenager as a victim of a real, forced rape.  So, yeah, he probably is depressed and deeply affected by this because he can't get anymore of that sweet, sweeet trim."

That said, these things are limited by 1) the investigation itself and 2) logistics - there are only so many courts and so many judges and so many cases they can see.  But it's not all bad, because any defense attorney worth their salt is going to squawk if an unreasonable amount of time passes (and commute that as ""time served"" on a guilty verdict or a grounds for a lawsuit to the city / state for an innocent man)  Unfortunately, it is very hard to put a value on this man's life and the trauma of incarceration.

The best we can do it to address the gross injustices as best we can and keep improving them.  Expecting that every judge is going to work exactly as intended without any oversight is about as silly as assuming that all people will follow the rules simply by virtue of the existence of laws. Obviously judges are held to a higher standard, but as we know, sometimes individual systems don't work as intended and must be course corrected. We specifically have these laws in order to punish deviance from it.  Again. It's little consolation to the victim, but it's better than saying, 'Fuck it. We'll probably get to you. Or we won't."""

The accusers would convulse and roll around on the ground in court and say they were being attacked by the witches.  To this day, the strongest theory is that the girls did it for nothing more than attention.

The male counterpart is the incubus. Religious traditions hold that repeated sexual activity with a succubus may result in the deterioration of health or even death.  In modern representations, a succubus may or may not appear in dreams and is often depicted as a highly attractive seductress or enchantress; whereas, in the past, succubi were generally depicted as frightening and demonic.

Anyone who encounters situations like this and feels there is actual harm occurring should bring it to someone with authority, not trying to whiteknight. Women shouldn't rely on strangers to keep them from harm. Women aren't the only victims of sexual violence."

PussyPass,31tea6,CrayolaS7,2,Wed Apr 8 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"LOL. Your name just makes me laugh. Talk about a delusional personality.   I'm gay. I've been fondled by women at parties. Many women would call that assault.   I worked for planned parenthood. My boss was incredibly sexist towards men. She made derrogatory comments about men, forced me to carry all her and the office staff's bags and belongings, and hid several instances of electioneering by using my email accounts without my knowledge (I nearly had charges brought against me).   I assume your attitude stems from some belief that men cannot be victims.   You are just another SJW with some sort of quaint delusion about enlightenment.   Not very buddhist IMO."

Not once did I say men don't face sexual assault, or face other kinds of persecution, belittlement, etc. The thing is this isn't what the video was focused on, that's a whole separate set of issues that yes, SHOULD be addressed but just because they weren't in this particular video doesn't mean its some conspiratorial effort to attack men like some of the guys in this thread seem to think.  As for my name, yeah wow you are totally correct, me saying    This doesn't matter if it's a woman being drugged at the bar or a dude getting mugged out side a 711, if you are there and capable of helping them you should.   Basically calling for the general population to support each other and do good, TOTALLY not Buddhist in concept at all. I was being SUCH an asshole thanks for helping me realize asking people to create a supportive community is a bad thing.  This is exactly why no one takes MRA seriously, you are paranoid, and when questioned with a reasonable statement you start attacking people and act like children. You're doing nothing for men's rights (which by the way I totally agree there is a need for a movement to address) by acting like a child."

Except that this is from an official government body and this type of thing is extremely common, almost all domestic violence campaigns revolve around the idea of women being the victim and men the aggressors. No, I don't think it is a conspiratorial effort to attack men on behalf of the people making this (although absolutely there are some feminist activists motivated by that desire), I'm sure their intentions were good but the effect is the same.  Yeah, if the message they were presenting was ""look out for each other to make society better"" that would be okay but it's not, the tagline was ""when you don't help her, you're helping him."" There isn't a counter-part to this where it's a guy being robbed by someone at a 7/11, there never is because that point is straight up obvious. The message they are trying to convey is that women are victims of sexual harassment and violence and you have to stand up for them. This is again just reinforcing the female=victim, male=aggressor dichotomy (which is equally as offensive to women, IMO).  This is nothing to do with ""MRAs"", this is a fucking awful example of how to do a public awareness campaign. There's no reason they couldn't have used a variety of men/women victims as well as gay/straight. I've had a female superior massage my shoulders like that and it was creepy as fuck but I was only 19 at the time and had no fucking idea what to do or who to complain about it and was scared I'd end up in trouble if she accused me of coming on to her.   The idea that men are the sexual pursuers and always make the first move is absolutely pervading within our society whether it is in pop-culture or this type of advertising. Maintaining this dichotomy is extremely harmful whether to male victims of female aggressors or female victims of female aggressors and we shouldn't allow it to continue.  Obviously you've already made your mind up that this is perfectly okay for some reason and can't even see why he would be defensive after you call everyone here crazy and accuse him of being paranoid. You then say he's being childish when he gave you a rational and personal response. I doubt you'll even realise it but to anyone else reading that conversation, he's not the one who looks ignorant and childish you are. I expect some crappy response about why I hate women and am paranoid because you're too stupid to see when you're out of your depth and the stuff you're saying is complete nonsense."

Men aren't complicit to these things any more than other women are. This campaign is designed to play to a certain set of emotions around male guilt and responsibility. This isn't about being good citizens, its about shaming a group of people into political receptivity. If this had been about all citizens, then why were only men the attackers? Statistics do NOT support the idea that males are exclusive aggressors. In fact newer statistics seem to be pushing closer and closer towards gender parity on these issues, so why the extreme focus on men? It is clearly politically motivated.   Of course, its always a countdown with feminists when you criticize their narrative to the moment they call you a child. That is basically your trump card right ? Men are just being children that need to be put in their place or ignored.    So mature /s"

While women have an innate urge to look out for themselves.  Women play the game of life on a lower difficulty setting. In almost any situation you can think of women have it easier.

Ask for help with something, anything. If you are a girl there will be plenty of people to help you. If you are a guy tough luck.  Guy reporting domestic violence against him. Gets treated with contempt, suspicion and frequently gets arrested himself.  Girl reporting domestic violence. OMG lock that asshole up, don't care if there is no evidence.  Dating ... who pays? Who has to risk rejection? Risk getting called a creep? Risk a false rape charge if the girl regrets having sex with him a few days/weeks/years later.  Who gets the kids in the divorce?  What gender is the victim of more violence, murder and crime in general?  What gender dies sooner, retires later, funds the majority of health research, but receives the least amount of said research funding?  What gender can quit their job after getting married, with the full expectation of the other supporting them and continuing to do so even after they get divorced?  What gender need to register for the draft before they can even vote?  Men are 10 times more likely to be homeless, 4 times more likely to commit suicide. Yet, the lion's share of the funding of gender specific programs goes to women.  How many men die at work for every one women?  What gender gets to make all the reproductive choices?  What gender grows up being told at every turn that they are evil, worthless, violent, stupid, creepy, oppressive assholes who are responsible for everything that goes wrong and every bad thing that anyone of either gender does?

Its not right. I appreciate you ""going against the grain"" a little to shed some light on the reasons behind this type of widespread thinking, and I don't think you should be downvoted as nothing you said was ignorant or accusing toward anyone.

He/she let me take fruit out of the chow area, let me get away with X/Y/Z. Once they have that leverage they hold it over the guards head. 'You are going to do what I want or I expose you"". That is how guards end up bringing heroin into the prison, little baby steps. That's why you don't have sex with inmates, because nothing in prison is what it seems. A collage student sleeping with her professor for a better grade or a HS student sleeping with a teacher isn't in the same ballpark let alone playing the same game.  3: This is Reddit, if your ""just asking a question"" and not trying to bait a argument ill be shocked."

In this case, the ""man"" in question is a minor who was the victim of an adult sexual abuser in a position of responsibility over him. The premise of the quote being posted to this sub is that it shows the judge was unduly lenient to her. While it's an ignorant stereotype when stated generally, as you suggested, in the context it is describing the diminished responsibility of a minor. The legal concept basically implies some reduced ability to make good decisions - whether you want to attribute that to ""with their penises"" or otherwise.  The only way the judge's statement can affect the sentence he gave the woman is by exaggerating the coercive influence she had over him. Your objection to it in context can therefore only conclude in an even more lenient sentence."

As a child, I may have had strong sexual urges, but I didn't have the capacity to make very rational decisions regarding consent when it came to those urges. Taking advantage of a child's sexual adolescence and nativity is sexual abuse. Unfortunately, there is no specific universal day/age when a child becomes able to make such decisions, but I do think a step forward would be for the consenting age to be lowered (15 maybe) and then enforcement to be unilateral regarding sex."

And if a teacher does lower your grade for saying no, they are risking getting fired since that's against policy, but it takes the student speaking up for that to happen.

Methinks your politesse is just a veneer over the usual gaping chasm of emptiness where the mind would go on a fully formed human being.  The affluenza sub-thread is not the one you are currently posting in.  You're in the sub-thread where someone asked ""can her parents really be rich if she was driving a 5 year old car?""  And I pointed out that a 5 year old car was not exactly a sign of poverty.    For a high school kid, a car only 5 years old is pretty well indicative that the parents of this girl were upper-middle-class.  They likely buy a brand new car at least every 5 years.  5 year loans have high interest rates and are very expensive, adding thousands to the cost of the car.  You'd know these things if you were an actual working adult who pays his own bills."

Clearly you're unable to follow along. Your expletives, and now your silly, not to mention misplaced, insult regarding age just makes you look like a child, even if you are well over 50.  You are just all over the map with your comments.  Starting with stating your disdain for debt and now speculating that her parents likely buy a brand new car at least every 5 years and 5 year loans have high interest rates etc. etc.  Yes, it's obvious you don't like going into debt because you don't know how loans and interest work.  The last car I purchased (my twelfth including two minivans which I owned before my children moved out) was purchased at zero percent interest. The one before that at 1.9%.  In my experience, (see how I don't generalize and claim that everyone shares my position or opinion) only those that cannot manage their credit pay high interest loans and those that might be considered upper class are not likely taking a 5 year loan on an economy class car.  This is the last I'm going to comment here, feel free to have the last word. You strike me as someone who will always want the last word anyway so this would just go on forever and I've used all my crayons explaining this to you."

The fatal injury happened within 24 hours of her death, Johnson concluded. The baby's father, Joseph Molina, was then implicated: the time frame fit a period he was caring for the child. The entire case was presented to an Onondaga County grand jury, Doran said. The grand jury indicted Molina on manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child.   So now they're going to have a trial and examine all the facts and testimony and see what truth emerges."

The syracuse.com article says the medical investigation found that the mom shaking the baby didn't actually cause the baby's death, so I guess that's why she only gets assault and he gets manslaughter. I don't know the whole story (and they don't either, that's why there's a trial), but my only point is that he's not just being taken to trial for no apparent reason, as one might think by reading the twcnews.com article, which doesn't say anything about why these charges were brought."

I know you want to be outraged at him but really? Cenk is criticizing pedophilia and the new frequency at which it seems to happen, then wonder if it hasn't something to do with the way some people are influenced by media,  some people will try to emulate a new idea, or concept they are being made aware of, as it sometimes happens with suicides.   Some people who have pedophile tendencies might be inclined to act on it as it is more publicized and seems like an available option, the only thing he says that could be remotely criticized is when he says he doesn't know if the act of sending a love letter is the same thing as the act of touching a child, he's not saying sending a letter is not pedophilia, he's just saying their is a line between the 2, which could legally change the situation.  Sending a love letter to a child is wrong but molesting the child is worse so as she hasn't acted on her impulse to kidnap and molest the kid, it is the difference between murder and conspiracy to murder or attempted murder, they are not on the same level, they are equally bad but are not legally seen the same way.  Re-watch the video and you'll see that Cenk isn't justifying anything, it's your comprehension skills that are lacking, no offense."
PussyPass,30sdnp,sfresh666,16,Mon Mar 30 10:00:11 2015 UTC,"You're right, he isn't trying to justify female pedophilia, because in his mind, these women are not pedophiles. He was trying to find a way to reduce her guilt by partly blaming the media, and saying that it's different when women do it because it's an emotional thing (i.e. trying to equate it to love) whereas for men, it's just dirty old perverts.   Sending a love letter to a child is wrong but molesting the child is worse so as she hasn't acted on her impulse to kidnap and molest the kid, it is the difference between murder and conspiracy to murder or attempted murder, they are not on the same level, they are equally bad but are not legally seen the same way.   You're talking about an ideal justice system, but that's not how it works in this world. The distinction between a man falling for a pedophile trap (chatting with a police officer who poses as a minor) and one caught for actual molestation is semantic only. Look up the sentences, see if the legal system gives a crap. Case in point, with enough kiddie porn pictures, your sentence can be longer than that of a man who actually raped a child. The reality is that all law surrounding sex and minors is based on strong emotions, which magically cool off when the offender is a woman, and that's when we're supposed to be reasonable and call it a ""romance"".  This is r/PussyPass, the point of this sub is to show instances of women behaving badly and given a legal and societal pass for being women. Find me a video where Cenk is equally sympathetic to a man accused of pedophilia but who hasn't actually raped anyone, and I'll consider your defense."

It set up compulsory arbitration of disputes, and a created a method to determine who was the aggressor in international conflicts. All legal disputes between nations would be submitted to the World Court. It called for a disarmament conference in 1925. Any government which refused to comply in a dispute would be named an aggressor. Any victim of aggression was to receive immediate assistance from the League members. The Conservatives in Britain condemned the proposal, fearing it would lead to conflict with the United States. Washington also opposed it, and the proposal was tabled.

If doctors have deemed this woman to need institutionalisation, which is the greatest loss of rights legally possible in the UK, over prison then the judge was right to listen to them. You, nor any of us here, are better equipped to judge this woman than the doctors that have evaluated her and the judge that based his decision upon their input. Chances are, if she is delusional and suffering from serious mental health problems, she will spend many years in a secure facility. Life sentences are for murders and rapists.

This is a serious attempt at a serious maiming, she just failed.

PussyPass,307p0f,gellis12,7,Wed Mar 25 06:11:10 2015 UTC,It's from the case where the woman sued McDonalds over the spilled coffee. Remember that picture anytime someone uses it as anecdotal evidence of extraneous litigation.
PussyPass,307p0f,YM_Industries,16,Wed Mar 25 06:59:01 2015 UTC,"Plus the woman only sued McDonalds for $10,000, enough to cover her medical expenses. McDonalds offered $800 settlement, which she refused, and the judge was pissed at them and slapped them with $2 million. I hardly think that asking McDonalds to pay your medical bill for an accident they had a significant part in is unreasonable."

Suing McDonalds because you spilled their coffee on yourself is like suing GM because you broke your arm when you drove into oncoming traffic."
PussyPass,307p0f,Flowers214,13,Wed Mar 25 09:25:56 2015 UTC,"The coffee was served at an irresponsibly hot temperature. Coffee is meant to be served hot, yes, but it's not meant to be above boiling.  If she had spilled coffee on herself and mildly burnt herself then I'd agree with you, but to get 3rd degree burns is ridiculous."
PussyPass,307p0f,Humankeg,3,Wed Mar 25 09:45:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's like suing GM when you broke your arm driving into oncoming traffic because the gas pedal on the car you bought from them stuck. They sold you an unsafe product and you sued them for the injuries it caused. It's not unreasonable to expect that you can walk away from a relatively common occurrence like spilling your drink without being hospitalized for it.  Although the argument you just put forward was basically exactly what the defense attorneys argued; the court was having none of it, partially because this was not the first time McDonalds had been notified their coffee was dangerously hot."

The lady that sued McDonalds when hot coffee was spilled on her, had her vaginal lips practically welded together with MAJOR burns to her legs from coffee that was about 180-200 degrees (and yes she deserved the money she got from that suit).  This man had even hotter water dumped over his head.  /u/thepedanticcynic I beleive posted a picture of her legs in a post below."

Women expect women to fight back. But they rarely ever expect men to fight back.  This is /r/pussypassdenied, not /r/catfightdenied. A woman fighting another woman isn't attempting to use her Pussy Pass. A woman fighting a man is typically using her Pussy Pass in the sense that she either assumes he won't fight back or will fight back much more softly than he would fight another man that did the same to him.  I'm of the opinion that any time a woman fights a man she's automatically trying to use her Pussy Pass."

PussyPass,2zwfbq,Fruhmann,8,Sun Mar 22 17:04:31 2015 UTC,What she did was likely assault. Assault is the threat of violence; battery is the physical act of striking someone.  Assault: Intentionally putting another person in reasonable apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact.  It's putting someone in a position that they fear being hurt.
PussyPass,2zwfbq,BullyJack,9,Sun Mar 22 18:25:50 2015 UTC,Yeah... I'm gonna go ahead and believe the multiple assault charges on my record over your comment. Edit. My state is different.

I have no idea what was going through the prosecutor's mind when they decided that three women who have shown they're willing to kidnap and torture a man should walk free.   If three men kidnapped a woman, mutilated her vagina, and beat her, I really don't think they would just walk out of the courthouse with some community service.

PussyPass,2zazxc,NaturalisticPhallacy,3,Tue Mar 17 18:36:34 2015 UTC,"Partial transcript:   After controlling for the arrest offense, and criminal history and other relevant factors, and looking at the process from beginning to end, she found that women are significantly more likely than men to avoid charges, to avoid convictions - completely - and they are twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted. Now on average men receive about 63% longer sentences than women arrested for the same crime. Now professor Star estimates that the gender gap in sentencing is about six times as large as the sentencing gap between black and white defendants.   So every time a radfem trots out the 77% rhetoric, use this. The 63% rhetoric.  Do they want a rectification of their perceived pay inequality in exchange for a 63% increase in sentances for the same crime?  Do they want a 200% increase in incarceration rates for the same crimes in exchange for what they perceive to be a pay gap to achieve equality?  That's the thing. Do you want equality or not? Most of the vocal feminists I've encountered want preferential treatment, not equal treatment. They want none of the drawbacks, and all of the perks. Which is not equality, but feminine superiority. Making them liars, and in my book, beneath contempt.  On that note, have you ever noticed how so many of them want to ""smash the patriarchy""? They don't want to ""create a matriarchy"" or even ""create an egalitarian society"". No. They want to destroy what's already there. Not create something better. Not create something they think is more fair. They just want to smash what already exists. It's not a path to improvement. It's not a path to a more equal society. It's wanton destruction as a child would. Without regard to the consequences. I would honestly respect them a lot more if they wanted to ""erect a matriarchy"" than I would if they didn't just want to tear things down. There's no creation of a better society here. Just destruction of one they perceive to be unfair. And that, I think, is the real reason that it will never work. The minute they as a gender start to want to create something different rather than destroy something that already exists, they will affect real change. Until then it's like watching children smash something you built based entirely on feelings. It creates nothing of value while destroying something of value.  I think the sexes are different and complementary, and trying to make them exactly equal across the board will be worse than complementary. Women are better at some things. Men are better at some things. Forcing equality that ignores the differences is worse than accounting for them in a way that both sides benefit."

She is about equality, not victim status, and readily admits unlike 2nd and 3rd wave feminists that men face hardships too, and modern feminism is about raising women by demonizing normal male behavior.   The National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC), a U.S. organization co-founded by feminist Gloria Steinem with a mission statement ""dedicated to increasing women’s participation in the political process and creating a true women’s political power base to achieve equality for all women"", awarded Sommers with a 2013 Exceptional Merit in Media Award[38] for her New York Times article, ""The Boys at the Back"".   I have a hard time thinking something founded by Gloria Steinem would give an award to a woman they didn't think was a feminist. She is just more like the first wave of feminism, instead of a patriarchal mumbo jumbo 3rd wave one. You saying CHS isn't a feminist is akin to saying Camille Paglia isn't.

No amount of money can make up for not being able to walk again. That destroys 90% of life. I'd prefer a whole different system, to be honest.  I'm fine with her not going to prison if she had to pay this man every month for the rest of her life; and if he dies she owes his family until she dies. That's punishment, justice, and reparations, all rolled into one.  On top of that, if there ever is a regenerative procedure found to give him his legs back, she must pay the full cost of that; but also no longer needs to give him monthly checks once he fully recovers.  I think that's all perfectly sound, and fair. Punishments should benefit the victims, not just harm the perpetrators."

I'm not saying its ok but she is young, dumb, and made a giant mistake.  Sad but true, accidents happen all of the time.  I know a guy who lost his leg because a driver wasn't paying attention and pulled out in front of my friend's motorcycle.  Do we lock him up and throw away the key too?  Do I think the sentence is low?  Yes.  I would think it probably should be double what she got.  But 14 years like the victim wanted, what purpose does that serve?  You are an inexperienced driver, got somewhat drunk, and hit someone on a moped (which already are dangerous because experienced, sober drivers frequently don't see them) now you are getting out of prison at age 33 with no work experience, no education, no bank account.  How does that fix the situation exactly?  Turn it into a learning experience by giving a sentence just long enough for her to see the severity of her actions, ban her from driving, and give a large settlement to the victim.  No amount of punishment will change what happened."

I know a guy who lost his leg because a driver wasn't paying attention and pulled out in front of my friend's motorcycle. Do we lock him up and throw away the key too?   Better that than to let him chill and live his life after he ruined your friend's.   now you are getting out of prison at age 33 with no work experience, no education, no bank account. How does that fix the situation exactly?   Because now you're poor as shit and won't be able to drive drunk and ruin other people's lives because of your selfish desires.  I'll stick to my opinion, you stick to yours. But the way you see it, we should be pardoning almost everybody for their fuck ups because ""no amount of punishment will change what happened.""

PussyPass,2zap4z,nsummy,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"This happened in the UK, 18 is the minimum age to drive there.  If we followed your opinion we would need about 10 times as many jails as we do now.  Accidents happen and people can be rehabilitated. Although she was legally drunk you can surely bet that pulling out in front of someone is a result of inexperience.  Its not like she was bombed and ran a stop sign. at 30 mph.  Either way the whole reason I commented was because this was not a pussy pass.  These sentences are common, especially in Europe where they favor rehabilitation more than punishment.  Some of the posts in this sub are really stretching and in cases like this its just a lenient sentence that happens to involve a woman."

Kuenne's close friend Andrew Bagby was allegedly murdered by Shirley Jane Turner after Bagby ended their tumultuous relationship. Shortly after she was arrested, she announced she was pregnant with Bagby's child, a boy she named Zachary. Kuenne decided to interview numerous relatives, friends, and associates of Andrew Bagby and incorporate their loving remembrances into a film that would serve as a cinematic scrapbook for the son who never knew him. As events unfold, the film becomes a sort of true-crime documentary.  In an interview with MovieWeb, Kuenne says that the documentary began as a project only to be shown to friends and family of Andrew Bagby. But as the events unfolded, Kuenne decided to release the film publicly.    Kuenne is donating all profits from the film to a scholarship established in the names of Andrew and Zachary Bagby.

I said are you serious, I drove here and I'm the reason why you even have four girls hanging out here. plus we still had to pay for a damn hookah. the place didn't stay in business for very long."

Everybody's doing it...""  Serious question, here. Did you grow up amongst the Amish where having sex before marriage means you're ""Damaged Goods"", or are you just trying to start drama? What the teen did, sexual acts aside (Which should be covered under any reasonable Romeo and Juliet exemption), amounts to a Class A Misdemeanor (Theft by Extortion) under Kentucky State Law 514.080 (3), which demands a penalty of no more than a $500 fine, and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months. (Section 534.040 (2)a and Section 532.090 (1), respectively)  By no means does the punishment fit the crime, especially if we regard the sexual behavior between the two as reasonably exempt under a Romeo and Juliet exemption.

B.H. was still on probation when the other offenses arose, justifying the court's decision to punish him rather than the girl, Fuchs said.

PussyPass,2ykn3y,PeterPorky,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:19:22 2015 UTC,"The fucking point is that you're being coerced. That is always wrong. Yes, there is a decision involved; she had the choice to have her life ruined and very likely be forced to move with her whole family to another town in order to avoid the harassment. She could have taken that.  The boy also had the choice to run away with his family to a country without extradition.   Both had the same choice, so why is this ruling wrong to you?"
PussyPass,2ykn3y,TechnoL33T,2,Wed Mar 11 00:43:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but if you're legitimately immature enough to actually believe that if she had denied the kid that she would have ""had... her life ruined"" and would be ""forced to move her whole family to another town to avoid harassment,"" I feel bad for you. Just shut down the computer and go get some experience in the real world.  The thing with rumors, as with all things, is that eventually everyone just stops giving a shit.  Hell, it'll happen with the court case. After a certain time, people just stop caring.  -  They also both didn't face the same decisions, and ultimately I blame the dude's parents but I'll get back to that.  The decision that the girl faced was to say, ""no."" She would face some hell for a bit, no doubt, but she wouldn't have to move or anything like that, just deal with a negative public image till everyone realized that it doesn't matter. Actually, it probably would have happened long before that once everyone at the school realized that this kid had issues. The decision that the dude faced was to not be a prick and learn that he won't always get his way.  -  Now here is where the dude's parents come into the issue. The fact that they didn't return any sort of accusation AND probably pushed him into taking a guilty plea is appalling. It actually really shows their true guilt in the matter. They raised little Johnny into believing that he would always get his way and that he could weasel his way into a yes. Sorry, no, that isn't how the world works. Second fault is not teaching him to respect a woman, and he probably has mommy issues stacked up too, but the fact that he conned this chick into doing what she did is just nasty to the core. Another thing, letting him date a thirteen year old? No, not okay. There's a really big gap in social maturity there and a large gap in sexual maturity as well.  -  BUT!  It isn't felonious. The kid is a dick snot, I've never said he wasn't, but it isn't a felonious charge. It's a community service charge and some sort of sexual harassment seminar/course or whatever, and maybe parole. If his appeal doesn't go in his favor, he is going to have to deal with something he did when he was a dumb ass teenager that will effect him for the rest of his life. Yes, he should face repercussions but not of that magnitude."
PussyPass,2ykn3y,PeterPorky,-7,Wed Mar 11 03:34:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can say no to threats, obviously. Your response is textbook blaming the victim. It's not her fault for being coerced by a threat, it's his fault for threatening her.  Threatening a 13-year-old girl and forcing her to take nude photos of themselves is still a crime.  You seriously think there should be no repercussions for that because she could've not responded to a threat? You really need to reevaluate your logic on this.  A 13-year-old girl's response to a threat of slandering her name would not expectedly be ""Really, oh well."". You have to be incredibly thick to believe that."
PussyPass,2ykn3y,TechnoL33T,8,Tue Mar 10 22:39:00 2015 UTC,"This is in no way victim blaming. Victim blaming is telling the rape victim that it's her fault because of what she wore.  This is blaming someone who simply could have moved on with their life and is a ""victim"" of a crime that they also committed. And actually it is her fault for falling for coercion, have a back bone and deal with life. It's not a candy coated wonderland where you get to go your way.  That girl got on the stand, cried crocodile tears and got what her parents wanted to happen.  The kid's a dick and he shouldn't have done what he did, don't think I'm excusing what he did, but he also shouldn't be considered a felon by any sort of definition.  He did what a fifteen year old would do, nothing more."
PussyPass,2ykn3y,PeterPorky,-3,Tue Mar 10 22:55:54 2015 UTC,"This is in no way victim blaming. Victim blaming is telling the rape victim that it's her fault because of what she wore.   Blaming a 13 year old girl for sending nude photos because she was threatened to do so is also victim blaming. You are blaming her for giving in to a threat, which is ridiculous.   This is blaming someone who simply could have moved on with their life and is a ""victim"" of a crime that they also committed. And actually it is her fault for falling for coercion, have a back bone and deal with life. It's not a candy coated wonderland where you get to go your way.   That isn't how threats work.   He did what a fifteen year old would do, nothing more.   He forced a 13 year old girl to send him nude photos. That is not what the average fifteen year old does."
PussyPass,2ykn3y,TechnoL33T,7,Tue Mar 10 23:12:04 2015 UTC,"No, it really isn't ridiculous because she is at fault, it also isn't victim blaming by the traditional sense.  Once again, victim blaming involves telling someone it is their fault because of something they did without any sort of interference. See rape victim blamed for clothing.  I'm blaming her for not having the backbone to say no and stick with it, same as I'd blame any idiot that falls for any con. I'm sorry, but there's really no other way around it.  She was never ""forced"" she was threatened with a rumor and didn't stand firm with a no.  Once again, I'm not excusing what the kid did or his methods of getting it, he shouldn't have done what he did. But she also should have enough common sense to know when to not comply with someone's demands."
PussyPass,2ykn3y,PeterPorky,-2,Tue Mar 10 23:27:36 2015 UTC,"Being threatened to do something is being forced to do something herp derp. This is true in every legal sense. If someone forced you to do something through a threat it is the responsibility of the threatener, not the threatened. ""Blaming her for not having a backbone to stand up to a threat "" is by very definition victim blaming and its disgusting that you place all of the blame on her for giving into the threat and none of it on the kid who coerced her into sending nude photos. Victim blaming can be for more than just rape, it can be any case where the victim is being blamed rather than the perpetrator, and in this case you're blaming a 13 year old girl for not standing up to a threat. I don't know how simpler to put it."

Physically (beat us with coat hangers, fly swatters, wooden spoons, anything) and also emotionally. I once caught my mother beating my little sister with a broom handle. I called the police and when they showed up my mother just started crying and playing victim like we were the ones who forced her hand. The police officer that showed up didn't do anything really. Kept telling me to keep my mouth shut or else I would be arrested for obstruction. That really pissed me off because I'm not obstructing anything if I'm trying to explain exactly what happened. In the end he said he couldn't do anything unless he arrested both my sister and my mother. I said good do it (knowing my sister is a minor and he couldn't lock her up or charge her with anything anyway) but he just left and said that I shouldn't call the police unless there was an emergency.

As for your situation, all I can say is move out as soon as possible if you still live there. If you're already gone then it's sort of cliche but you can't let it bother you anymore. If you let the past continue to wane at your psyche then, trust me on this one, it seeps into your other personal relationships. I had a relationship with a girl that would do anything for me several years ago (I've been single since just to self reflect and try to rid myself of hatred) that I ruined because I was incapable of trusting her fully. It slowly went downhill and finally crashed...I don't blame my mother for it because it was my own inability to move on from that abusiveness."

Then she was pissed off when they helped hire an investigator to help set things right, she hired and attorney as she saw this as potentially damaging to her case she had been building.  Evil fucking liar, profiting from the real victims of sexism.  She was :   PAID MORE than her male colleagues Offered her ideal job after many many many times being given warnings about her performance and actions in her first promotion Was given access to the leading mentors and gurus of her industry   Fucking cow. The women who make her shitty suits are the ones who need the $16M, the ones who have to work, suffer abuse, so they can feed their kids, the women who develop health problems while working.  Now some spoiled moron who calculated that despite spending so much money on paper degrees she would only year low ten-ks a month and with the lifestyle she had and expenses she'd never hit the wealth management curve in time.  She got involved with a criminal for purely financial purposes, fucking gold digger, that landed her in shit with the SEC and FBI now.  Then she breaks contract and employment law, as well as wire fraud, conspiracy and some other laws, paying off an employee to leave a company and push her into the position, betting on the outcome of court case.  yishan was bribed to step down as CEO and promote her (they'd planned it for a while, but they needed some ""reason"" and they could't find one... hence the ludicrous exit yishan had) REDDIT STAFF KNOW THIS, they are just too chicken-shit to do anything about it."

Like most things society makes illegal, I think a couple of studies could really shed a lot of light on the matter and inform the current laws. If we find that child abuse is more likely to be prevented when ""real"" CP has less demand, and that simple drawings can help restrain those who would otherwise offend, then it (CP hentai) should be legalized and, in a way, even encouraged."

At some point his dad started offering to massage my back while I played. I let him do it and thought nothing of it. Well one day, he started reaching around a bit and next thing you know I was getting wet. So he asked me if we should move somewhere more comfortable where he could massage me a bit more. I said sure and we went to his room. Well, within 5 minutes it was on. The oddest phrases came out of that man. I asked him if he thought Jesus would be mad at us and he said he thought Jesus would want him to be happy. That passed my 14 year old logic test so we kept going.  Well, for the next 5 days we did it at his house, mine, in the car and really anywhere we could get the chance to. He even had it set up where he could sign me out of school (he was tight with my mom) so he did one day and we had more or less an all day romp.  He offered me a few hundred dollars and said it was so we could take a vacation to get away from everything. I took it. I also told my older brother since I couldn't contain myself any longer. He immediately told my mom that he had threatened to kidnap me (I guess that is what it technically would have been) and my mom told my dad and my dad called the cops.

Note how it's ""statutory rape"", that's because it's not actually rape.    they are incapable of giving consent.    Consent has a meaning outside the law you dumb fuck."
PussyPass,2y0v7g,Insula92,3,Sun Mar 8 08:54:41 2015 UTC,"Well, then in my country, it means rape. And consent certainly does have a meaning outside of rape, but when the law legally rules on that type of consent, in our case sexual consent, it defines it. You're trying to split hairs, and for some reason getting really worked up about it. You're also acting like some personal meaning of rape is more important than the fact that you will have legal reprocussions by committing the act, especially with a law that isn't even controversial.   Whether you like it or not, legal definition does matter, just going 'ehhh, that's not how I define consent' in court isn't going to help you."
PussyPass,2y0v7g,SuperFlowLess,-2,Sun Mar 8 13:16:51 2015 UTC,"but when the law legally rules on that type of consent, in our case sexual consent, it defines it.    For legal purposes, and for legal purposes only.   You're trying to split hairs, and for some reason getting really worked up about it.    I'm not splitting hairs. Saying it's rape is just wrong and stupefying."
PussyPass,2y0v7g,Insula92,0,Sun Mar 8 14:17:47 2015 UTC,"The law is made to govern the society, it's not like the law is monopoly rules and only exist in a board game. You are splitting hairs because you're pretending like the legal definition has no bearing on average day to day life. If a 30 year old has sex with a 14 year old in the US and that becomes public knowledge, calling that rape. The authorities are going to get involved and you really aren't going to find much of an outcry against that because it's generally accepted that it is non consensual sex."
PussyPass,2y0v7g,SuperFlowLess,0,Sun Mar 8 14:29:26 2015 UTC,"You are splitting hairs because you're pretending like the legal definition has no bearing on average day to day life.    I'm not pretending that, I'm asserting that rape has a clear meaning outside of the law, so does consent, so have they for thousands of years. And that meaning does not change because simply because some legislators decides to redefine rape.    If a 30 year old has sex with a 14 year old in the US and that becomes public knowledge, calling that rape.    Is wrong.    The authorities are going to get involved and you really aren't going to find much of an outcry against that because it's generally accepted that it is non consensual sex.    No it's generally accepted that it's illegal. Rape and sex with a minor has nothing in common except both involving sex. Calling sex with a minor ""rape"" is retarded newspeak. It implies that it makes sense to group the two, when it does not."
PussyPass,2y0v7g,Insula92,15,Sun Mar 8 14:44:06 2015 UTC,"Rape by legal standards, but I looked through the entire thread and it seems like op gave all the consent he could muster in his 14-year-old head. He even said    Zero body fat, beautiful eyes, blondish hair. She looked so magnificent lying on my bed I wanted to omnomnom 'till the cows came home.   So you tell me if the legal system is right in saying this was nonconsensual sex because ""a minor can't consent"".   Edit: this post does fit the sub's theme if you consider gender reversal. I'm talking about a different subject entirely. I guess you could see it as dangerous since the same argument could be used for ephebophilia, but I don't feel like that's nearly as severe as pedophilia. The op's consent may have been a strong factor in the woman's sentence."
PussyPass,2y0v7g,LunarisDream,27,Thu Mar 5 16:21:53 2015 UTC,"I feel the legal system is not the only thing at fault, but society in general. When genders are reversed, why do most consider the girl to be not consenting? At the time they could have consented but society will tell them that's wrong and they will second guess themselves. There's a lot of gray areas when it comes to these situations but the people of today see them as black and white. Girl v Man = not consenting, only pressured or persuaded into sex. But boy vs Woman and it's entirely plausible for the 14 year old boy to consent even though there is clearly persuasion by this Woman."

For boys it's just playing with fire and not getting burned. In this story, she groomed him and took advantage of his immaturity and parents trust, she's a predator."

PussyPass,2xwqhs,WacoKid212,10,Wed Mar 4 23:30:33 2015 UTC,"He reduced federal expenses pretty much across the board.  He froze White House salaries on his first day in office.  Signed an order banning gifts from lobbyists to anyone in the executive office.  He appointed the first Federal CIO to oversee federal IT spending which has been reduced dramatically year over year ever since.  He phased out unnecessary and obsolete weapons systems and introduced the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act, to curtail overspending, fraud and abuse in defense contracts.  He ended the F-22 program, saving $4 billion. Though the military had 187 built, the F-22 NEVER EVEN ONCE flew a combat mission. As an aside, his “fiscally conservative” Republican buddies fought to keep it.  He helped push through the Democratic-sponsored American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (a bill that passed even though only 3 Republicans voted for it). And launched recovery.gov, so taxpayers could track spending from the Act.  Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , cut taxes for 95% of America’s working families.  Tax rates for working families haven't been this low since 1950.  We were losing 800k jobs per month when he took office and he was able to create and maintain 2.1 million new jobs within his first year thanks to the ARRA. He then oversaw the creation of more jobs in 2010 alone than Bush did in his entire 8 years.  Created the MHA home refinancing plan.   Oversaw and implemented the auto industry rescue plan saving more than a million jobs and saving GM - a company on the verge of folding that is once again the top car company in the world.  Ordered executives who accepted bailout money to cut their own pay until they paid back the bailout money in full.  Spurred the housing marking recovery by offering first time home buyers a hefty tax credit.  Cut ties between energy companies and the government by dismantling the minerals management service.  Supported the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act to close offshore tax avoidance loopholes used by many of the super rich and some prominent republican politicians (coughRomneycough).   Negotiated a deal with Swiss banks to permit the US government to gain access to the records of criminals and  tax evaders.  Signed the American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act, which closed many of the loopholes that allowed companies to send jobs overseas, and avoid paying US taxes by moving money offshore.  Worked closely with Apple to convince them to build more of their products in the states. They are now building two large plants in Texas and Arizona.   Ordered all federal contractors to pay a minimum of 10.10 / hour leading to a nationwide increase.  Banned anyone from working in an agency where they had lobbied previously.  Under his leadership there have been 60 months of continuous job growth as well as 64 consecutive months of economic growth. This is the longest stretch in US history.  The stock market under Obama has reached record highs, repairing many of the economic losses felt under Bush when it reached record lows.  Extended benefits to same sex partners of federal employees.  Repealed don't ask don't tell.  Issued an order requiring hospitals to allow visitation by same sex couples.  Ushered through and signed Affordable Care Act, which expanded health insurance coverage to at least 30 million more people, ended many common insurance company practices that are often detrimental  to those with coverage.  He also established healthcare.gov, so that taxpayers could keep up with developments.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, inflation in the healthcare sector dropped to its lowest point in more than 50 years.  The Affordable Care Act dropped the number of uninsured Americans by 22.3%, which amounts to more than 10.3 million people with insurance who didn’t have it before.  Ordered the closure of Guantanamo. His republican buddies prevented him from staying true to that promise though.  Provided active combat troops with better body armor.   Eliminated restrictions on embryonic stem cell research, and provided increased federal support for biomedical and stem cell research.  Provided financial support for private sector space programs.  Eliminated the practice of forbidding Medicare to negotiate with drug companies on prices.   Doubled federal spending on clean energy research.  Provided a tax credit for people buying hybrid or electric vehicles.  Addressed the U.N. Climate Change Conference, officially reversing the Bush era stance that climate change was a “hoax.”  Became the first President to simply say “Climate Change is a fact,” and set up the first federal government protocols for dealing with the impacts of climate change.  Under Obama our dependence on foreign oil is at its lowest point in 30 years.  Got BP to cough up $20 billion to establish Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, to reduce the need for taxpayer funds to be used for compensation and clean up (It took 20 years to get $1.3 billion for the Exxon Valdez spill).   Eliminated federal funding for abstinence-only education, and rescinded the global gag rule.  Signed an Executive Order that will speed up deployment of a more comprehensive broadband infrastructure.  You get the idea..."

Lists of all the good and/or bad things each president has accomplished are easy because every president has done both good and bad things. The list was to illustrate that you shouldn't ignore the things any one president is responsible for because of how you feel about them - good or bad."

The only difference between you and me is that I'm willing to accept the fact that every president, the ones I've liked as well as those I haven't, has been responsible for a huge number of both good and bad things."

Especially considering the company is now not even American owned..... I guess if you're told something is good enough times people will start to believe it throwing logic to the wind. I'm not even going to argue the fact that all the points you made about decreasing taxes and cutting spending are basically just ridiculous claims and half truths because I know you're set in your beliefs that all of that is undeniably true. I had no idea that /r/PussyPass was wasted on the government koolaid, you guys see what women can get away with for being women, I assumed you all had the rationality to see what politicians and the government can get away with because they make the rules and have all the power , instead many of you celebrate their crimes, misrepresentation and misappropriation of tax money with thunderous applause and then downvote someone who calls out their bullshit because you can't handle the cognitive dissonance, congrats"

PussyPass,2xq7bf,ThisVersionOfMyself,1 point,Tue Mar 3 01:52:31 2015 UTC,I've raised plenty of dogs in my life. Most from puppies. All raised with care. Most people think pitbulls and rottweilers are dangerous and that's because the owners typically abuse their raw power. I've raised 2 of each breed and they have been loyal and non dangerous at any situation. I had a poodle who was the spawn of Satan. It's all about the raising. Any type of dog can snap at an instant and I mean ANY. I've seen a pomeranian bite someone's finger off and a chihuahua rip at someone's leg. The breed has nothing to do with the violence factor. Some breeds might be more prone to violence but in personal experience I haven't seen any evidence showing such.
PussyPass,2xq7bf,DoxBox,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:18:56 2015 UTC,"Still depends on how they're raised. She trained it to attack on command. I know people who've had pitbulls and literally trained them nothing, they turn out just as docile as a lab. The difference being that if a pitbull will break your arm when it bites you and a lab will break the skin. So pitbull attacks are documented far more frequently than any other breed, because of the severity of damage inflicted.  Imagine a police trained german sheperd that somehow ran away and was taken in by a family as a stray. That animal would be reported within a week for attacking someone."

This does differ in that it was in plain view, but I don't see how it's very different from any other more or less harmless drunken mistake, and I certainly don't see how it should be made to follow and humiliate her forever.

PussyPass,2xi9u5,Real_Patriot,86,Sat Feb 28 23:15:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, the people here saying this isn't a pussy pass are either sick SJWs or brainwashed.  I'm all for letting people make their own choices in life, but the idea here is clear: If this was a 24 year old man grabbing a 14 year old girl and shoving his tongue down her throat, he'd probably end up with charges.  Do most people in general want most laws in general erased? Yep. Most people would be happy with only the obvious crimes like murder, theft, and assault being on the books, and then let everyone who isn't hurting someone else do as they please. But why does this only come up when the victim is a boy? Why do the SJWs come into these threads when a boy gets molested or raped by a grown woman and say there's nothing wrong here, but then they foam at the mouth for vengeance against a guy in a similar situation? Sexism.  Whether or not you think 14 year old girls should be able to kiss 24 year old guys without anyone getting into trouble, pussy pass is determined by one thing only: Would a guy doing this get in more trouble than the woman did? In most cases, he absolutely would, so yeah, this is clearly a pussy pass unless she ends up with charges."
PussyPass,2xi9u5,UnityNow,5,Sun Mar 1 04:08:24 2015 UTC,"Just like the twilight paradox, where, if a bunch of middle aged men would be screaming after a 17y old girl at a movie premier, the cops would probably come in, but if a horde of milfs screams after Pattinson, it's just fine.  And honestly I also thought this wasn't a pussy pass, but this was merely to fact that I didn't know she was 24. I thought she was something about 16ish before I looked at it a second time after reading your comment."
PussyPass,2xi9u5,Pronato,3,Mon Mar 2 14:48:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Twilight paradox is a great example of this kind of double standard. There are plenty of examples of that, where mainstream media shows middle aged women going crazy over young men, but then simultaneously portrays that it's creepy if the genders are reversed.  But this specific case is more of a pussy pass because there's video of a 24 year old woman passionately kissing a 14 year old boy, and it's considered okay even though if the genders were reversed, there would most likely be charges for the man.  Supposedly it was a dare or mission given to him: ""Kiss someone 10 years older than you."" As others have brought up, there was peer pressure and likely alcohol at play, too, but none of that would matter if this was a 24 year old guy kissing a 14 year old girl. She also didn't just let him peck her. She actively grabbed him and took it further.  I think the camera angle and other factors diminish the appearance of the age difference. He's standing up and she's kind of laying back on a bed. If they were both standing up, she'd be much taller than him and the age difference would be much more obvious."
PussyPass,2xi9u5,UnityNow,3,Mon Mar 2 15:22:16 2015 UTC,I came here to genuinely ask if there are any charges for this sort of thing?  Like I know sex with a minor is illegal but is making out with a minor?
PussyPass,2xi9u5,GingerSnapBiscuit,2,Sun Mar 1 21:57:30 2015 UTC,"No idea. But coincidentally, a few years ago I watched a Chilean coming-of-age film called ""Machuca"", which had a scene in which a female character kisses/makes out with two boys, aged 12 or so. Her character is supposed to be around 15, and she looks it, but in real life the actress was in her early 20s, if I recall correctly, which made me wonder how the parents of the boys ever consented to that. So, maybe it's different when it's for the sake of ""art"" or whatever."

Same way they don't arrest musician who ''smoke weed'' on stage: there is no proof it's really weed well in this case they sure try to say it was her breast but how can you prove it? So probably too hard a case for police to pursue it.

At the free skate parks every day and in downtown Miami/Fort Lauderdale every weekend. You grow up a LOT faster than your peers when you see street life every day. Sheckler is no exception to this.

PussyPass,2xfwnv,crackyJsquirrel,13,Sat Feb 28 18:15:18 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think feeling sorry for people in prison isn't wrong in and of itself. Its having a huge amount of sympathy for killers that don't have penises, and then having none for those that do. If that's your distinction for who deserves their punishment, then you can fuck off.   I feel bad for anyone serving a life sentence. I get that they killed someone, and I understand that its fair (assuming they are guilty) but I can't help but feel bad that they have one life and the rest of it is going to be spent slowly aging and dying in prison."
PussyPass,2xfwnv,Muffinizer1,2,Sat Feb 28 19:54:25 2015 UTC,I have no sympathy for anyone who is serving a life sentence as long as they are guilty. They should have thought about their one chance at life before they took someone else's.

The security naturally thought the girl was the one who was the victim. So getting involved would probably mess up where you were going because your now a part of it.   3: no idea

He quit Kidder in 1991, dissatisfied with his bonus, and set up his own firm, Fletcher Asset Management. He also sued Kidder for racial discrimination, alleging that the firm decided that the amount he was owed “was simply too much money to pay a young black man.” An arbitration panel dismissed the racism charge but ordered Kidder to pay Fletcher an additional $1.3 million in bonus money.   And doing a google search on the guy and there are no shortage of dramas. The guy is definitely a mess.  https://www.google.com/#q=Alphonse+%22Buddy%22+Fletcher  http://www.theday.com/article/20131215/NWS01/312159915  Motherfucker even ran a Ponzi scheme:   The trustee, Richard J. Davis, claimed Mr. Fletcher’s alleged actions had “many of the characteristics of a Ponzi scheme where, absent new investor money coming in, the overall structure would collapse.” Mr. Davis said the firm’s funds were likely insolvent since December 2008.   Jesus H Fucking Christ, what a fucking mess:   Before marrying Pao and seeking that extra apartment, Fletcher shared the Dakota digs with his long-term boyfriend, Hobart Fowlkes Jr, a switcheroo that goes barely explored in the Times piece. By e-mail, Fowlkes, the godfather to Pao and Fletcher's child, assured the paper of his closeness with the couple — and also, perhaps passive-aggressively, reminded Pao of just how close he is with one-half of it."

Because it's 20%, but overall MUCH LESS in engineering, so they are fucking liars, they want 50% of the fucking jobs but 0% of the higher skill / workload / productivity jobs.  edit a massive percentage (over 60%) of state budgets are in healthcare and education, look at the /r/dataIsBeautiful post - what I want to show is, first, how much public money, and to which kind of jobs, are going to male / female - first, it's important research (I bet the only objectors will be disease-minded feminist) and second it'll set the record straight."

They are basically female 'neckbeards.'   Absolutely, I get the same impression, treat women as people first - some nutcases want to rob women of their personhood and create some sick feminist-caliphate where women are advised not to go to parties (at the same time, we're told not to tell them not to go to parties...), they try and put women on a pedestal by childishly merging the idea of wanting time-attention and broaching the idea of unwanted attention and calling all representations of the female form as ""objectification"" (this is absolutely diabolical, positively wrong and nobody questions it, objectification doesn't exist).  Women are individuals, people first. Not faceless gender stereotype victims you can use to raise funds.  In 2007/8 on reddit I coined the ""ikea slob"", I said for women to be equal they need the same criticisms as men, not just more praise.  If a 35 year old woman is alone in a small ikea furnished apartment with 11 cats, that's FINE but we should be as open about how that impresses upon us as we would if a guy is in the same situation.  I've seen so much bullshit online about ""loser guys in their shitty apartments"" and stuff, time to talk about loser women, it's not vindictive, it's really about the positive, benevolent idea of ascribing the same potential to each person. Not in a patronizing way.  Anyway, to the same degree, most women want the same options to succeed and have a rewarding journey of accomplishment - but it's a handful of medically diagnosable individuals that are using victimhood to try and get unfair advantages."

I wonder if they study the Equal Pay Act of 1963 in gender equity law classes:   No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section [section 206 of title 29 of the United States Code] shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs[,] the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex ...   It was signed into law over half a century ago, and outlines specific legal remedies for anyone who has a case.   Glad to see this tried in open court, rather than in front of an arbitrator."

There's a couple of reason why this slipped out of Justice's hand.  a) Criminal Case, burden of proof is on the plantiff to prove that the defendant is beyond a shadow of doubt, guilty. Therefore, the prosecutor may have did a shit job, and hence failed to proof, beyond a shadow of doubt, that she was committing a 2nd degree attempted murder.  b)Improper screening of jury. Jury can be screened by judge and attorneys, and attorneys can reject jurors if they find them unfit to carry out impartial judgment. Perhaps one of they fucked up here?  Does anyone know this case file? If someone can link it, we can read it without accusing anyone. Maybe there was some information we are missing?"

PussyPass,2wrrll,redditgoogle,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:29:01 2015 UTC,"Given that they're waving guns around like that, I'm going to say strict on paper, not in practice.  Of course, I would only be mildly surprised if Russia had extremely strict rules on buying guns, but had no laws against brandishing.  It seems like the kind of thing Russia would do.  Regarding strictness - a weapon with more than 10-round capacity is completely illegal for civilians in Russia, and you have to go get a fairly involved license to own and carry a hunting rifle.  It's not UK-tier strict, it's probably more comparable to New Zealand or California."

If the genders were reversed, then no defense in their right minds would go for this defense without getting their car keyed. The outrage is that if genders were reversed, the defense lawyer could not take this track. They wouldn't even think of 'blaming the victim' for their rape.  The issue here is the sexism that will come from the jury and the fact that the judge would likely put a stop to the defense if the genders were reversed.  Sad thing is she has a decent chance to win and probably not be ridiculed for this defense. If not, then there is a decent chance that her sentence would be similar to a slap on the wrist. She will get 6-12 months in prison but will be out in half the time and not have to register as a sex offender. That would be horrendous."

I was 18 at the time, but wasn't involved in the situation, never in a room alone with any of them because I knew better. I'm down in the convention hall with my friend and this guy comes charging up to him and grabs him by the arm. I have no idea who the hell this guy is or what he's doing so my mind is racing between finding security or lunging at him, so I just stand there frozen.  Full story came out later. My 14 year old (male) friend had consensual sex with the guys son, who was 15, and the father was going to try to pursue statutory rape charges. My friend's parents had left him at the convention for the weekend under the supervision of a family friend. I spent the next half day trying to find as many people involved and try to figure out the story, but everyone seemed to have vanished so I don't really know what happened after that, but it turned into a giant shitshow."

PussyPass,2vwy1o,ancillarynipple,-28,Sun Feb 15 02:28:39 2015 UTC,"I do what I want when I want. I'm hyper aware of my surroundings and always pay my fines, it's really inconsequential for all the traffic laws I regularly and intentionally break ( nothing serious) and traffic school every year ( I have a PHD by now) keeps my license, 1-2 dollars a day covers my fines yearly and I always do my part to pay that extra tax. Worst ticket I got was when after a MLB game I was snoozing laying down in the back of the car while she was speeding and a CHPrick pulled her over, woke me up and gave me a seatbelt ticket. Her nothing. Asshole.  I will admit once I was a drunk passenger in a car that was being driven by a slightly drunk driver and a CHPrick was in the right lane giving me the double stink eye over no seatbelt. I didn't give a fuck. They tried to be cool and the driver touched his seatbelt while giving me the do as I do mimic stare. Again, no fucks given, I think I was in the middle of a funny drunk rant and cop or no cop I was going to finish it. So he pulled us over and came to my window and I was given a seatbelt ticket, I told him to save the lecture just as he started it, double jeopardy and all ( yes I'm white, we can do that).  It was $50 bucks, big whoop, and they never even talked to the driver, who was highly pissed off at me for almost getting him busted. My bad.   Sometimes when they obviously get right behind me I go 4 mph over the speed limit just to test them. You can visually see steam rising of them as they get perturbed at the audacity of it but they usually don't do any more than run the plates while they try and get bumper to bumper on you because they want to make SURE you saw them even though I keep eye contact in the mirror with them the whole time. If not they let you go with a warning since it was only 4 mph and I'm probably going to fight it in court one way or another.   Ask me about the time I stopped all traffic (5 lanes) among 4-5 other broken traffic laws on the I-5 bridge at rush hour between Portland OR and Vancouver WA. Started with me going 35-40 right of the white line while regular traffic was doing 5 in Portland and ended with me thinking Dukes of Hazard style if I made it to the WA state line all was good. Hint: I didn't make it but it all worked out.  Point is, if your a good looking woman you don't ever have any tickets regardless and if your a man you are legally and highly discriminated against with insurance even if you never get into accidents."

He was 16 at the time. On June 15, 2013, he crashed a pickup truck into pedestrians. In December 2013, Judge Jean Hudson Boyd sentenced him to therapy at a long-term, in-patient facility,  after his attorneys successfully argued that the teen suffered from ""affluenza"" and needed rehabilitation, and not prison.

I believe that is illegal in more than one state.   every fool in the US has the power to take somebodies life   That may be true technically, but if you're implying all American own guns, that is completely false. And, sorry to break it to you, but you don't need a gun to kill somebody.   So what? implying you can reach your gun faster than a criminal can pull the trigger, let the police fucking handle criminals   Oh, yes, because the police will certainly be there much more quickly than it takes somebody to pull the trigger and shoot you! ""Hold on, there, buddy. I need to pull my cell out and dial 911 real quick before you try to kill me!"" What do you do if you can't call 911 from your cell, like I can't, and don't have the long number for dispatch in the area you're in? Guess you're SOL.

An inexpensive 22 LR rifle with Ammo is going to run you at least $200. Handguns generally cost more than that.   and in this case, every fool in the US has the power to take somebodies life   Anyone in another country has the power to do so as well, with tools other than gun. Knives, Baseball bats, etc.   theres no logical reason to call owning a gun a ""right"" and driving, a ""privilege""   It's called the Bill of Rights, and they put it in there for a reason: to stop a tyrannical government (The American Revolution).   theres also no logical reason for guns to be legal at all   Self defense, hunting, collecting, hell, I'd say most people probably own them just to shoot targets as a hobby/sport. Or:   the only valid reason for guns to be legal would be, to help overthrow the rotten government   Nice job contradicting yourself. So, guns should be illegal, unless there is a tyrannical government to overthrow? How do you expect us to get them if there is a tyrannical government, when guns have previously been illegal? The government isn't going to make them legal, so that you can overthrow them.   the shitty argument would be ""but a criminal will always get guns""   Nobody can even agree how many guns there are in the U.S. If they are all destroyed, there is no way to tell how many are left, and who has them. Even then, they will be smuggled in from Central/South America. The black market may shrink if they are made illegal, but it will never go away.   this argument was somewhat shut down by jim jeffries   Source?   So what? implying you can reach your gun faster than a criminal can pull the trigger, let the police fucking handle criminals   Will I reach my gun faster than a criminal? Maybe, maybe not. People use guns for self defense every day. Check out /r/DGU. I know one thing, I can draw and fire the gun on my hip faster than I can call the police, and much faster than the police can respond to my call.   An autismal kid cant just walz into a gun deal and buy 30 thousand dollar gun from the black market, which in turn stops future potential criminal activities, like killing a bunch of school kids   I read this about 10 times, what the fuck are you even trying to say?   The xwife in this case migh not have killed him and commited suicide if a gun wasnt so easily availible, she might have had more time to think her options through   Or she would have used a knife, baseball bat, ran him over with her car, mixed some antifreeze in his sweet tea, etc. Someone who is determined to kill someone will do their best to do just that.

Its total BS that men can be fined and jailed for not paying child support (basically a debtor's prison).

Yet isn't it in the best interest of the child to have that money spent on them instead of on drugs for the mommy?   How can we justify this?   It's better for mommy to have you and go out and have you babysat by a stranger while daddy's money is used for bingo cards, cigarettes, drugs and alcohol   vs  Having the child leaving with a caring father that makes a good salary and has shown an interest in raising the child in a stable household.  I'm totally flabergasted at how many times I heard people say (females, it goes without saying): It's just ridiculous that the father got the custody of the child.

I should say it annoys me when someone offers, and offends me when someone insists. I get that historically it's a way to be polite, but ""I insist"" just tells me ""I heard you say no, but I don't give a fuck and I'm going to do what I want."" I know it's not meant that way, but it just bothers me so much that people think they can just ... override(?) me like that.   With the faceplant guy, yeah, he's down, he needs a hand up... but if I'm about to get out of a car, I don't need a hand. You don't offer your guy friends help getting out of the car, the only reason you would do it for me is because I'm a female, and unless you're trying to woo me, I'd rather just be treated like a normal human being.  Honestly, I'd prefer to be treated the way people treat a man they respect. Not because I want to be treated like a man, it's just that it seems like in this culture ""male"" is the standard and female is something else. I just don't want to be treated differently because I'm a female.  I think this view comes from the fact that I spend so much time in online forums... it seems like unless someone states otherwise, they're assumed to be a male. And I'm guilty of making this assumption as well.  The thing that got me thinking the other day was this... if someone assumes I'm a man online, there's no point in correcting them. My opinion is what it is, and unless it's something specifically related to gender, making mine known is unnecessary. Sort of like the whole thing about men approaching women to ask what time it is or something and them responding ""I have a boyfriend.""  I'm sure I'm not making sense, because I haven't even fully fleshed out what my opinion on this is... Maybe this is horrible of me, but I suppose I consider my ""womanhood"" as a disability, and I'd just rather not be reminded of it constantly.  Make any sense?"

The argument could be made for the thesis of this article, but it isn't well defended or coherent here. It also deals more in the semantics of the words pay gap (saying the difference in earning counts as a discriminatory label, even if it is explained in nondiscriminatory way) than in actual rebuke of the study.

You posted an article which disagrees with your assertion that the wage gap is 4 cents or less because ""explaining why a phenomenon exists is not the same as demonstrating that it doesn’t exist"" and advocates for the 25 cent wage gap. It defends Obama's claim of a 25 cent wage gap at the end as true.   The only real evidence it presents is claiming that studies (that don't control for specialization, overtime, and sometimes even job description) find disparity is best explained as discrimination. (instead of, like, controlling for variables)  Strong cases can be made for socialization impacting choices to be the primary caregiver, but he doesn't make any beyond briefly mentioning it.

PussyPass,2v7uhw,Mike12344321,-2,Thu Feb 12 17:35:12 2015 UTC,"Dude, that's flawed logic.   The police forces of various countries (and in various states/provinces/regions and cities/towns/etc.) are made up of lots of very different people. As such, it would be inaccurate to make simple statements about the whole (except for statements like ""they are all police"" or ""they all get paid""). At any rate, obviously not all police are ""bad""; those that are bad are numerous, and receive much more publicity than those that aren't, but this does not mean that all police are bad. Even a statement acknowledging both ""good"" and ""bad"" police officers is too simple to adequately describe the whole.   It is impractical, inaccurate, and unrealistic to assume that any police officer you meet is ""bad"".   There's also a question of burden of proof; your assertion is not self-evident, and you should provide proof supporting your position.   Tl;dr what makes you say that?"

PussyPass,2v5z1h,Scr33nlines,0,Sun Feb 8 19:29:18 2015 UTC,This was a university library not a public town library. It is difficult to convict someone of something like that when there are no witnesses. I don't think that she was charged with any sex offender crimes because she was a woman but because they could not provide enough evidence to reasonably convict her of that crime. Also if she was a first time offender they might choose a lesser charge. But I think that without other witnesses a man probably would be charged with the same crime. It isn't always about what they did but what they can prove.

Same with teens who send sexy text messages. Shouldn't be charged with child porn offenses and shouldn't be on sex offender lists. At all.  I'm not even sure this woman should be on the sex offender list - at least not permanently (and I would say the same for a man). I'm glad she was cited for public indecency though.

Elements of acting reasonably include that the defendant had first avoided conflict and, secondly, had taken reasonable steps to retreat and so demonstrated an intention not to fight before eventually using force.

The concept of 'don't have sexual relationships with minors' is not a difficult one to follow and the rule of law should apply to both men and women without discrimination.

Agreed on the second bit, I doubt anyone here would go in for the crazy ""but it's different when women do it"" schtick, but what's a minor? 16 is a legal adult in some parts of the world. Again, I'd regard the law as existing to protect people from harm, unless you think a 16 year old can be harmed by seeing a picture of a naked adult (did you never see any porn when you were a kid?) I don't see why we should have a law preventing it. Now if she sent them to him without him wanting her to, that's a different matter."

Yes, for four reasons I can think of right now. Firstly, we shouldn't allow loopholes for sexual predators to get away with their actions. Secondly, if we look at an extreme case of a 50 year old man abusing an 8 year old girl do you think the ""no harm was done"" thing would still be okay? No because, thirdly, we needed to set age of consent to a point where this we could protect those who are too young to consent, even if they wanted it. Why is that age 16, 17, 18? Because, fourthly, the harm done to people of this age may not be visible for many years.   but what's a minor? 16 is a legal adult in some parts of the world.   You're mostly right in this reasoning. The research done about the harm of sexual indecency of kids 15, 16, 17, 18 years old is limited. It is difficult to tell what is the appropriate age and that is why we elect lawmakers to decide on an age. Maybe the 16 year old kid was mature enough to deal with the situation and maybe it will bring him psychological and mental health issues later in life. I do not know enough to tell but as a democracy it was decided that 16 is too young so that is what we will stick with."

I find it hard to believe no harm would be done, but an 8 year old kid with no understanding of sexuality or adult relationships is not a 16 year old kid (man?). Do you remember what it was like to be 16? I don't know about you, but I wasn't some poor innocent kid with no sense of my own agency. And plenty of people lose their virginity at 16 (let alone see a naked picture), or earlier, with no ill effects.   Maybe the 16 year old kid was mature enough to deal with the situation and maybe it will bring him psychological and mental health issues later in life.   If seeing a naked picture is enough to warp the mind of a 16 year old, every generation in the west since the 1990s is doomed. Like, seriously, when was the first time you saw a picture of a naked women?   I do not know enough to tell but as a democracy it was decided that 16 is too young so that is what we will stick with.   Like I said above, it depends on the circumstances, but I'm not convinced that the law definitely did more good than harm in this case.

I make no such assumptions whatsoever. I've pointed out over and over again that the article gives no detail. If you're saying he was coerced then you're the one making assumptions. In cases like these, it's usually the highly offended parent pressing charges, not the kid.

If you're not thinking in terms of, ""how can I prove I was here and doing only legal things?"" all the time you're not going to remember what you were doing six months ago.  So getting consent for every sexual encounter you have isn't going to save you from having your life destroyed by a vindictive woman.  If I ask someone, ""do you believe in due process; in the concept of 'innocent until proven guilty'?"" but then follow it up with, ""do you think people accused of rape should be immediately sanctioned and/or prove they got consent?"" I am often faced with answers like, ""Well, rape is different.""  How is it any different than regular ol' assault? What about robbery?

PussyPass,2uqvtf,snell_kille,2,Thu Feb 5 02:04:12 2015 UTC,"From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence.   In the United Kingdom changes have been made affecting this principle. Defendants' previous convictions may in certain circumstances be revealed to juries. Although the suspect is not compelled to answer questions after formal arrest, failure to give information may now be prejudicial at trial. Statute law also exists which provides for criminal penalties for failing to decrypt data on request from the Police. If the suspect is unwilling to do so, it is an offence.[29] Citizens can therefore be convicted and imprisoned without any evidence that the encrypted material was unlawful. Furthermore, in sexual offence cases such as rape, where the sexual act has already been proved beyond reasonable doubt, there are a limited number of circumstances where the defendant has an obligation to adduce evidence that the complainant consented to the sexual act, or that the defendant reasonably believed that the complainant was consenting. These circumstances include, for example, where the complainant was unconscious, unlawfully detained, or subjected to violence.   So it seems that England has a tradition of presuming innocence but lacks the same constitutional protections the United States has."

Pretty convenient that she decides to ""report"" him only AFTER he's already been accused.  ""Oh, blah blah blah, she was embarrassed. Seeing him accused gave her the courage to stand up."" Is an excuse I feel needs to stop. I could see that excuse viable for when a MAN gets raped, because when its a man being raped, no one believes him.  If a woman legitimately gets raped, she has no reason to hide from it. She needs to call police, get help, and get the scumbag arrested, then get on with her life. She needs to be bigger than whatever challenge life throws at her. And I feel for her if she really was raped. I cannot even imagine how horrible something like that must be.  However, I also feel terrible for the guy. If he didn't rape her, then he got his name dragged through the mud for MONTHS, labeled a Serial Rapist, and sometimes even harassed (like the list of names appearing in the bathroom, with his at the top titled ""Serial Rapist"").

PussyPass,2u88yb,baldylox,23,Fri Jan 30 21:10:55 2015 UTC,"She's not on a sex offender's list.  Indecent exposure is pulling out my dick.  Masturbating in a public place is not indecent exposure, it's a sex crime. If a man did this, he would not be spending a year in jail. He would be on a sex offender's list and his whole reputation tarnished never being able to get a job and much more jail time."
PussyPass,2u88yb,bam2_89,18,Fri Jan 30 21:21:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah and neither would a dude be.  OK so lets take a rational look at things instead of talking out our ass:  Oregon defines public decency as follows: 1) A person commits the crime of public indecency if while in, or in view of, a public place the person performs: (a) An act of sexual intercourse; (b) An act of deviate sexual intercourse; or (c) An act of exposing the genitals of the person with the intent of arousing the sexual desire of the person or another person.  It is a misdemeanor offense.  It is not registerable unless it is your second offense or you have a qualifying previous conviction such as a public indecency or rape.  In that case it makes it a Class C Felony, and then you MUST register.  So, if this gets pled down, you might have a point.  But for first time offenders of any sort, it usually gets pled down, even if you go off trolling for truckers in the state park.  EDIT:  Also, she isn't on a sex offender list for the above reason, and because there has been no conviction.  This whole post of yours is pure speculation.  And just to make clear, jerkin it in public falls under subparagraph c above and IS NOT A REGISTERABLE OFFENSE unless the other prerequisites are met."

PussyPass,2u5e2b,rahtin,-6,Fri Jan 30 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"The issue in this country right now is that police are also killing people that are in no way ""attacking them"". Like a guy who they thought was selling cigarettes illegally that they fucking choked to death needlessly.   Police in this country are not military. They aren't walking enemy territory. Their job is to protect and serve the citizenry. If your default mindset when dealing with people is to fear for your life and pull a gun and shoot, you probably don't have what it takes to be a cop.   The other problem is that when they do something wrong all the other cops will protect them and typically they end up not even getting a slap on the wrist. There's no accountability. Think about the fact that they are all opposed to the idea of wearing cameras. If they're really only using the force that they need to for their own protection, they should have no objection to that. They know that their fellow officers frequently abuse their power and that video taping them all the time would likely result in some actual punishment for a change."
PussyPass,2u5e2b,PackerBacker50,4,Fri Jan 30 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"I won't deny that this exists...but not as much as the senseless cop-hate out there. It's at the point where a cop in Ferguson kills a man in self defense and, because a city full of uneducated, unemployed professional victims and criminals decide to break the law even more with violent protests, the poor man has his reputation and livelihood ruined. For doing the right thing. Because people who break the law threw a fit for being held accountable to it. It's absurd. It's almost enough to turn a man racist. Blacks bitch about being targeted by cops, yet blacks make up up 13% of the population and account for over half of violent crime in the country. It's not racism or 'profiling' when those kinds of numbers are in play.  As for Eric Garner, cops didn't kill him. He killed himself. The police used a headlock, which is a far cry different than a choke hold, because the man was resisting arrest. If he didn't break the law and then resist, he'd be alive today. If he wasn't morbidly obese with a laundry list medical problems that are a direct result of his poor life choices, he'd be alive today. Hell, a brisk walk up a flight of stairs would have killed Eric Garner. What are the police supposed to do? Just let him go? Are criminals who have medical conditions above the law? Think about it logically. Whose actions led to his death? It wasn't the polices. Ironically, I've never heard of a case where a cop, in a professional capacity, went around killing people who weren't breaking any laws.  So help stop cop related deaths by shaming criminals. If you have a friend who commits crime, end the friendship. If your wife is committing crimes, divorce her unless she desists. We need to change the mindset of this country - criminals are NOT victims. They are CRIMINALS."
PussyPass,2u5e2b,rahtin,-2,Fri Jan 30 18:48:40 2015 UTC,"he killed himself.   Not according to the medical examiner. The death was ruled a homicide, which means he died as a result of purposeful action by another person (in this case the cop). It was a chokehold, not a headlock, by the way, and it was entirely unwarranted. (I know headlocks from wrestling, there would be an arm in there with the head; I also know chokes from my military martial arts instruction, that was a fucking choke)   What are the police supposed to do? Just let him go?   Considering they didn't have any evidence of him breaking any sort of law, I'd say yes. It's not clear whatsoever he was selling cigarettes in the first place. Or they could not choke him which isn't authorized by NYPD. Or they could do something when he tells them 11 times that he can't breathe.    Whose actions led to his death?   The cops' actions did. Directly. According to the medical examiner.    Criminals are NOT victims. They are CRIMINALS   This is just outrageously stupid. So if you break a law you can't also ever be a victim of anything? You could jaywalk and a cop could kill you but you're not a victim? That's entirely off base, so much so that it's scary.   Even without looking at race at all, cops in this country are pretty much out of control right now. There needs to be more accountability for them. Set up a system to police the police. Maybe even get rid of the unions, which is one thing that stops a lot of police from being properly held accountable."
PussyPass,2u5e2b,PackerBacker50,0,Fri Jan 30 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"No, the cop's actions didn't lead to his death, he resisted arrest.  He started the physical altercation.    How fucking brainwashed do you have to be to not see that in the video?"

A mother slitting her children's throats is not typical postpartum depression behavior.  With postpartum depression it isn't uncommon to have thoughts about harming yourself or your child, but when you cross the line into an actual attempt or success at harming yourself or your child, you venture into postpartum psychosis territory, a condition that generally begins to present itself within 2 weeks postpartum.   If her youngest child was 2 and she was exhibiting signs of severe postpartum depression or psychosis (which she likely was prior to the crime), the real failure is on her, the family, and the woman's health care provider (assuming she had been seeing one) for not recognizing the signs and getting the woman proper treatment.  While a woman may try to hide the baby blues or postpartum depression from their family out of shame, the personality change that would accompany THAT level of depression/psychosis would be noticeable."

While I was attempting to fish them out with my finger, the woman stomped over to me and violently wrenched the mug out of my hands. The coffee spilled all over her hardwood and she flung what liquid remained in the mug into an adjacent bathroom sink. She immediately apologized for her outburst, claiming that people picking at their food was a pet peeve of hers. She then went into the bathroom while I got some paper towels to clean up the mess she'd created. While I was on my hands and knees mopping up the spill she tried to leave the bathroom. I was positioned right at the threshold of the door as thats where the spill was. When she couldn't step over me, she exhaled in an exasperated fashion and told me in a very nasty tone: ""Move!""

PussyPass,2tdsga,autowikibot,4,Fri Jan 23 13:30:42 2015 UTC,"Karla Homolka:       Karla Leanne Homolka, also known as Karla Leanne Teale and Leanne Bordelais (born 4 May 1970 in Port Credit, Ontario, Canada), is a convicted Canadian serial killer who helped her husband rape and murder at least three women. She attracted worldwide media attention when she was convicted of manslaughter following a plea bargain in the 1991 and 1992 rape-murders of two Ontario teenage girls, Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French, as well as the rape and death of her sister Tammy.   Homolka and Paul Bernardo, her husband and partner in crime, were arrested in 1993. In 1995, Bernardo was convicted of the two teenagers' murders and received life in prison and a dangerous offender designation, the full maximum sentence allowed in Canada. During the 1993 investigation, Homolka stated to investigators that Bernardo had abused her, and that she had been an unwilling accomplice to the murders. As a result, she struck a deal with prosecutors for a reduced prison sentence of 12 years in exchange for a guilty plea for manslaughter.  However, videotapes of the crimes were later found that demonstrated that she was a more active participant than she had claimed. As a result, the deal that she had struck with prosecutors was dubbed in the Canadian press the ""Deal with the Devil"". Public outrage about Homolka's plea deal continued until her high-profile release from prison in 2005.  Following her release from prison, she settled in the province of Quebec, where she married again and gave birth to a boy. In 2007, the Canadian press reported that she had left Canada for the Antilles with her husband and their baby, and had changed her name to Leanne Teale.  In 2012, journalist Paula Todd found Homolka living in Guadeloupe, under the name Leanne Bordelais, with her husband and their three children.  On October 17, 2014, the jury in the first-degree murder trial of Luka Magnotta heard that Karla Homolka is living in Quebec.

With deception at its core, this behaviour is an elusive, potentially lethal, and frequently misunderstood form of child abuse  or medical neglect  that has been difficult to define, detect, and confirm.  MSbP has also spawned much heated controversy within the legal and social services communities. In a handful of high-profile cases, mothers who have had multiple children die from sudden infant death syndrome have been declared to have MSbP. Based on MSbP testimony of an expert witness, they were tried for murder, convicted, and imprisoned for several years. In some cases, that testimony was later impeached, resulting in acquittal of those defendants.

UPDATE TO UNBELIEVABLE STORY ABOUT WOMEN WHO WERE CAUGHT ON VIDEO STEALING BEACH GEAR ON JULY 4TH (via Gawker.com): I reached out to the man—who asked that we refer to him only by his first name, Rich—through a mutual friend, and he gave some additional background on the encounter, including what happened after the video cut out; it involves one of the women screaming at Rich, ""I'll grab your dick!""   We were enjoying a great family day at the beach. My sons needed a nap. We were staying a block from the beach and decided to walk them home, and leave our chairs and canopy set up. I've been to New Smyrna Beach a thousand times and felt it was safe enough to do so. We were gone for about an hour and a half. My dad is a local and mentioned that Beach Patrol may pick up items that are left alone. I was skeptical but volunteered to check.    My sister, Lib, offered to join as I was walking out the door but I told her I'd take care of it. From the boardwalk I was dismayed that I didn't see my canopy set up. Then I spotted our chairs loaded up in our beach cart with two women (attempting) to break down the canopy. I ran down the ramp to the beach and pulled out my iPhone to share what I was seeing with my wife and sister back at the house.    If I were to judge a book by its cover, theft would not have been my first thought. I honestly thought they were being neighborly because NSB is Mayberry on the beach. I was surprised when they said it was theirs and stuck with the story. They were grasping for straws by saying my oldest son's beach toy belonged to them. I offered to let them move along but the one woman ""was not making it slide.""    Her partner aka Tankini threatened to ""take that camera and put it in the grass."" There wasn't a blade of grass in sight so you know she meant business. She slapped at my phone, scratching the screen with a ring. I thought it was hilarious that this lady that was clearly in the wrong was actually coming at me. I did not intentionally stop the recording.    What followed was pure gold. I continued to back up as we went around the canopy frame. In the most bizarre moment she gnashed her teeth, lunging at me with an open palm and said, ""I'll grab your dick!"" I appreciated the offer but didn't feel the chemistry was there.    The two then said they needed to call ""Pat"", which may or may not have been the androgynous SNL character. He or she was going to apparently clarify what they were doing with my stuff. Lady in Red said, ""We need to get a phone, but not his. His phone is tainted."" They then scurried off towards the parking lot.    I couldn't believe what just happened. I messaged the vid to my wife and sister back at the beach house, just the video without a message. The way the video ends I can now understand their concern. They told me they got in the car immediately and called the police right away. My wife, sister, and niece arrived a few minutes later, Beach Patrol a few minutes after that.    I explained that nothing was taken and the ""assault"" didn't warrant filing a police report or pressing charges. The Beach Patrol Officer explained that this never happens in New Smyrna Beach, which I agree with wholeheartedly. The 4th of July holiday brought out large crowds of beachgoers and a few bad apples had less than the best intentions. We've definitely learned that you shouldn't leave your belongings unattended, even in Mayberry.﻿"

PussyPass,2sytat,MRMRising,30,Mon Jan 19 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"At least this story makes the problem clear. The judge let her off because he thought that this was clearly ""a breach of character.""  Meanwhile there is no possible way he could have known her character as he's never even met this woman before. Its the assumption that because a woman is well put together she is a good person.  This reasoning clearly makes no sense, and the worst part is judges rarely take a man's ""character"" into account when enacting justice. Who gives a shit about character. You are there to decide whether they committed the crime or not.   This is not justice this is proof that society thinks women should be able to do whatever they want to a man, to use him and abuse him without care or remorse."

PussyPass,2sytat,theonlynever6,6,Tue Jan 20 01:01:37 2015 UTC,"This is false all around. As a convicted felon and somebody that had been through the system far too many times in my early 20s you're wrong. There are mitigating factors. Having your mom kill herself and never being convicted of a crime previously as well as showing respect to the judge and appearing well put together are all factors in sentencing.   She was CONVICTED with a SUSPENDED sentence. (Sorry have no idea how to bold or italicize on mobile, not trying to shout at you). She didn't get anything special that any other first timer would get, especially since she beat him while he was down like a bad person.   You also get character witnesses and letters that can speak to who you are and the judge takes these things into consideration.   Reread the article and this was in the UK, may be a bit different than the US."
PussyPass,2sytat,Fluffymufinz,3,Tue Jan 20 07:29:25 2015 UTC,"Assault and battery is a very severe offense. I don't think many people would get let off for it. The prosecution could have even charged for Assault with a deadly weapon because of the belt. Also, we don't know if the victim here got compensated for his medical expenses or grief. At least make the lady pay this guy some money.  I mean this would be different if the victim had provoked her in any way. This was a savage and deliberate beating that she obviously feels no remorse over. That says more about her ""character"" than anything."

PussyPass,2sytat,Aaron565,2,Tue Jan 20 23:11:43 2015 UTC,"Like I said, no previous charges. She wasn't going to jail and she still could if she violates her probation. Her sentence is real and is just suspended. She is on probation and she SHOULD be excited to be going home. A trial isn't about the person that got attacked but you vs the state.   I get your point and to an extent I agree just because it was a violent crime and should carry a different punishment than say a first time drug offender. But if she has never had a history of violence then locking her up doesn't benefit anybody. It isn't going to make the guy feel better, it isn't going to make us feel better. Her having to go through the court process and what she could be looking at may actually benefit her."

PussyPass,2sv9av,thrownaway_MGTOW,4,Mon Jan 19 20:11:00 2015 UTC,"In loco parentis:       The term in loco parentis, Latin for ""in the place of a parent""  refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organization to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a parent. Originally derived from English common law, it is applied in two separate areas of the law.  First, it allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the students as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students' civil liberties.   Second, this doctrine can provide a non-biological parent to be given the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent.   The in loco parentis doctrine is distinct from the doctrine of parens patriae, the psychological parent doctrine, and adoption.  In the United States, the parental liberty doctrine imposes constraints upon the operation of the in loco parentis doctrine.      Interesting: Ward (law) | The Unit (season 2) | Dixon v.

I know who bitch that is and I know what she was doing. Not gonna name names cause I don't want to reign r/Kappa hellfire upon them. She's a local anime player and not very bright (I'm pretty sure she has aspergers or something like that), she's a very much ""Social Justice Warrior"" like aswell. Anyway she was not happy with ShinBlade and the Memphis team at all and was pretty vocal to a few people about her not liking ShinBlade thinking he's a rude person and too loud for the tournament. So when ShinBlade starts popping off she decides to go up and grab him, trying to look like she's calming him down but mainly to bait a reaction out of him. Not only did she try to get him DQ'd but he wanted him to end up as another Aris CrossAssault situation and make it look like he attacked her and get some serious heat heading his way from shit like Kotaku and Polygon. I guess she's going off the logic that cause she's a girl people will believe her over the guy. She wasn't alone on this either, she told her friends, who are thirsty as fuck white knight nerds, this whole thing and they jumped in. Hence you can hear dudes in this video yelling to DQ him before anyone knew what was going on even though he did nothing wrong and she was the instigator. This seriously isn't the first time she's played the victim like this to get someone else in a fucked up situation either, on facebook right now she's making the whole situation revolve around her. Anyway TOs show up and try to figure out what the fuck happened ready to get the DQ hammer out, I didn't hear the conversation but I assume dudes with tapes and witnesses confirm that ShinBlade did nothing and the girl started it, tournament continues but I assume ShinBlade was told to keep the pop offs quiet. I just wanted to shed some light on the situation before Kotaku shows up and tries to make it look like ShinBlade assaulted a woman and how the FGC is mysoginst.""

IDGAF), I completely disagree on the feminism thing.   SJW's/Feminism are practically one-and-the-same when it comes to modern feminism. SJW's are the ones pushing this socially retarded stuff like California's ""Affirmative Consent"" laws and ""We must believe the victim by default"" crap that's spawned the Duke Lacrosse and U of VA scandals. Some of them, like Sarkeesian, consider themselves both Feminist and SJW, so the line between the two is not just blurred, it's practically nonexistant.

These children are required to attend school, and these teachers are expected not to have sexual relationships with their students.  Thus, even though in most cases it is not rape, it is inappropriate. Now, if male teachers having sex with students past the age of consent are getting far more severe punishments, then this is a PP.  Thing is, I don't know if slap on the wrist is not necessarily the correct punishment. I have a hard time thinking 2 people beyond the age of consent having sex should be a criminal. These people should lose their licenses and be kept from working in similar settings, since they broke with the expectations of their profession, not jailed for 20 years."

PussyPass,2sf1up,Humankeg,2,Wed Jan 14 21:43:37 2015 UTC,"Came to post this. Some will simply dismiss the suggestion as a stretch or grasping but it isn't. Or at least, it may not be. The whole point of this case is that people, society, don't see violence against men by women with the same importance as violence against women by men. The two are not equally valued.  If this issue was the murder of a child, the witnesses would have been much more likely to cooperate with the process. The death of a child has a much greater value than what happened with Hope Solo. The same can be said for the debate over the value or any crime. If someone steals your sandwich, you probably won't bother calling the cops or pressing charges. The sandwich isn't valuable enough. If someone steals your new car, you would have a much greater incentive to report it.  The point is, willingness to charge someone for a crime and a willingness to follow through with the process are indicators of how valuable that crime is to the victim and to society. The fact that the witnesses didn't think it was important enough to continue the process may very well show an indifference to domestic violence against men. As the least it may show a lower value for that violence.  So while many might disregard this case because of the reasons for the dismissal, the fact is that the law exists within the context of society as a whole and it is society as a whole that produces the circumstances for pussy passes, not the legal system alone. Pussy passes aren't a legal creation, they are a social creation. If double standards exist, the behavior of the witnesses in the Hope Solo story is predictable way that sexism would be expressed and that would make this a pussy pass."
PussyPass,2sf1up,Abadoobie,0,Thu Jan 15 01:01:27 2015 UTC,"To be fair, many women don't go to court to convict the men in their lives of dv.  Its wrong in both cases but it does happen.   The bigger problem is that society itself doesn't give a fuck and let's her off the hook, very unlike what happened to ray rice (who got what he deserved)."
PussyPass,2sf1up,Cryptonix,1 point,Thu Jan 15 15:11:27 2015 UTC,"Sure, lots of people of all demographics don't report crimes of all types. But domestic violence is seen as a man-beats-woman scenario and those DV scenarios are the only ones society puts much value on(child abuse aside). The Hope Solo incident may show those cultural values by the case being not important enough to continue for the witnesses. But she also has a history of DV so you would think that would make it a bit more important to continue. It clearly wasn't. It's all part of the same thing, cultural values. These individuals may have just re-affirmed the existing cultural norm that female DV is less important than male DV."

If you fail to comply, you will be arrested on the spot.   Should you not agree with the law or the officer, you have your day in court before a judge to plea your case. What you don't have is the right to argue, fight, or resist the officer who is doing his job and sworn duty.  To think otherwise is folly, the sort of entitlement that is a cancer to our free society. When you have people who think they are above the law, you end up with chaos.   The intelligent and practical person doesn't argue with an officer of the law when they've been stopped for breaking the law. If she was any sort of decent intelligent person, the officer would at the most issued her a warning citation, cautioning her to her jaywalking behavior being dangerous. Walking out into traffic is actually dangerous to not only the person, but to others, hence we have laws concerning it.   This simple concept shouldn't be escaping an adult in the United States, let alone a college professor, who is in a position of authority herself when she is instructing students. Her behavior is unjustified, and should be grounds for termination of her job, as she is setting a really bad example and giving her university a poor reputation via her association with it.   The problem I believe is that she thinks she's entitled to this poor behavior for several reasons, which thankfully she's been put in check for. The fact that we are having this discussion about this officer losing his job, or her having any grounds to sue on should be a red flag as to the serious condition that university is in.    The fact that I have to spell out the simple facts of this matter are also alarming as there are far too many misinformed people with very faulty ideas about basic adult responsibilities.

In college, I worked with juvenile sex offenders for about a year. I'm not sure how many males we supervised but there were many. While there were only two females. The males would typically end up in juvenile corrections while the females had much lighter consequences.   For example, one male had consensual sex with a 14 year old girl when he was 15. Her parents found out about it and pressed charges. In my state, you can be charged as an adult for sex crimes at age 15 so he was charged with sex abuse (a felony conviction) because he was ""an adult having sex with a minor."" He was sentenced to 6 years in juvenile corrections with 3 years parole after. And he has to register as a sex offender for life.   One of the females at age 16 had engaged in sexual acts (including oral sex) with at least one girl under the age of 5. She was slapped on the wrist and placed in a residential program where she could get a job in the city and was taught life skills like cooking, cleaning, money management etc. she had no jail time (aside from waiting for court hearings.)"

Men do not own their body, have no reproductive rights, and get zero sympathy when the victim of abuse or crime. Men almost never win custody rights, and that statistic stays consistent even when you remove all the cases in which the man doesn't want custody. Men by miles suffer the most from alimony and child support of which rarely makes it to the child. Men are blamed for everything, regardless of what century it happened in. The list goes on."
PussyPass,2s74u4,freedomfreighter,8,Mon Jan 12 21:15:03 2015 UTC,How is voting for men a conditional privilege in the US? Not from the states so genuinely curious.
PussyPass,2s74u4,FynnM,22,Tue Jan 13 00:53:45 2015 UTC,The current system requires that all men the age of 18 must sign up for selective service (conscription). In many states failure to do so disqualifies you from voting. Women do not have this requirement.
PussyPass,2s74u4,freedomfreighter,14,Tue Jan 13 02:49:55 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the fact that if you don't sign up for the draft by your 18th birthday, the government can also give you retardedly huge fines, bar you from getting a drivers license or any other government services, and arrest you.  But it's ok, this isn't discrimination, because it's not happening to women!"
PussyPass,2s74u4,gellis12,6,Tue Jan 13 04:05:25 2015 UTC,I think its because not signing up for selective service which all men are required to do can result in felony charges and if your a felon you lose the right to vote.

For example It's true that men serve longer sentences than women for the same crime, however It's closer to 60%-65%, not a whopping 400%.   A little fact checking goes a long way.

PussyPass,2s74u4,Lazaek,-1,Tue Jan 13 07:05:18 2015 UTC,They don't. In fact the last time someone was even persecuted for failure to register for the draft was in 1986.

It takes LESS effort to say ""end genital mutilation"" than to say ""end female genital mutilation"". The only possible reasons to specifically exclude boys are:   An indifference to or denial of their mutilation. The belief that male genital mutilation is so accepted that including it would weaken their other goals.   The first case is obvious sexism. The second case is faulty reasoning again.

Those devices are comparable to a dildo for a woman, and I am pretty fucking sure the cops would have arrested any of those women if they had seen them cramming a dildo in their crotch.  Pussy pass is a woman performing an action a man is not allowed to/acting aggressive and then thinking her gender is a shield against reprisal or getting lesser punishment or no punishment at all for something a man would be punished for... and none of those requirements are met in this video.  This video is little more than raging that vibrations can get girls off, and how unfair it is that they get to get off in public, through their clothes, in a way that breaks no laws and leaves them fully clothed.

Look at this woman, look at the way she's narcissistically looking at the camera. This isn't a mother; this is a grown-up college chick. And trust me, you don't want to marry a typical ""herp derp Im a college girl"" kinda person. Their world revolves around themselves and the way other people view them. That's why they're so in love with insta-selfies - it caters to their incredibly egocentric existence because it showers them with the attention they so desperately crave. The problem is that college chicks never get this: if they put on revealing yet impractical and uncomfortable clothes, it's not because they depend on male sexual validation to sustain their self-esteem, nooo, it's because ""hurr durr you know, can't I wear whatever I want? And whatever, I like the way it looks, I'm doing this for me""...sure girl, you're wearing that crap for you™. And the selfies? Those are ""for you"" too, right?   Anybody who thinks the stereotype of ""women are irrational and emotional"" is complete nonsense obviously has no day-to-day contact with average women in their 20's. I'm willing to bet they only come in contact with the typical reddit-chick; the kind of STEM-girl who has a whole bunch of her own insecurities for which she tries to make up by doing something ""interesting"" and ""status-improving"" in hopes of patching up that gaping hole left by not being hot enough to receive the sort of attention she'd ideally want (don't be fooled, she could still easily get some very decent looking fellas to sleep with her, but it's the thought that counts).   Ah, look at me, I drifted off like a /r/twox whiner. Now, what should you take away from my post? Faces and appearance are everything.

Dry lightning cracks across the skies Those storm clouds gather in her eyes Her daddy was a mean old mister Mama was an angel in the ground The weather man called for a twister She prayed blow it down  There's not enough rain in Oklahoma To wash the sins out of that house There's not enough wind in Oklahoma To rip the nails out of the past   Also, she can't sing.  Quick edit:  You'll notice the little boy in the video in the background smiles at the camera.  It loosely reminded me of this internet hit.  Which of course, ends with the big sister probably hitting her little brother (now contrast that with the Italian video where young boys are told to hit/slap a girl and they refuse).  Obviously not the same scenario, but the point that boys are taught from a very early age it's wrong to hit girls whereas girls seems to not receive the same message.    Lesson here:  Don't mess with a girls narcissist time.  Had the boy in the OP spilled the milk when the mom was watching TV, I doubt her reaction would have been the same.  Equal rights from men and women also means acknowledging that women can also be violent, abusive monsters."

No, because chances are you've seen it before, and if you can see it in person why not in pictures? Sending those pictures around should 100% be classified as distribution of child pornography, but having them shouldn't be classed as possession.   A 17 year old taking pictures of a naked 13 year old? Yes, because that is abusive, the 17 year old is nearly an adult and should know better.  An 11 year old filming the stripping of a 5 year old? Yes, though maybe not for life. Maybe til they are 18, or for a 10 year period. We all do stupid things as a kid, but that doesn't mean you should be able to escape without punishment.

PussyPass,2rxgzw,COCK_MURDER,3,Sat Jan 10 19:37:17 2015 UTC,That's not the definition of a felony. A felony is a crime for which you can be punished for more than 1 year. The risk that you could be imprisoned for more than a year is what distinguishes it from a misdemeanor.
PussyPass,2rxgzw,poof312,1 point,Sat Jan 10 21:37:39 2015 UTC,"""A person convicted in a court of law of a felony crime is known as a felon. In the United States, where the felony/misdemeanor distinction is still widely applied, the federal government defines a felony as a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. If punishable by exactly one year or less, it is classified as a misdemeanor.""  Either the sentence is wrong, or the classification of her crime as a felony is wrong.

He did the intelligent thing by not fighting back, as when the white knight cops got there they were ready to throw him in jail on the spot. It took some fast talking AND the video to get it through their thick skulls that she was indeed the criminal there.   Epic pussypass bullshit of hall of fame quality.   You talk shit about beating her, but you obviously have no experience with the combination of the pussypass coupled with the white knight effect compounded by 'i'm a king shit cop' mentality all stirred together for a recipe of some prick with authority thinking with his dick as some 'poor widdle girly' being victimized by some dude whom he can bully to impress her.   I know one's first reaction is one wants to beat the bitch like a drum. I showed the video to my 73 year old mother and she said if she happened on to this happening, she's beat the bitch bloody herself. lol Settle down, mother.   The disturbing take away from all of this is that a woman can be abusive in a multitude of ways towards males and unless you have overwhelming proof of their shenanigans, you are in serious trouble if they sic the authorities on you. Even then in a clear cut case of their crimes, they aren't punished like a man would be if the roles were reversed.   It points out a glowing hypocrisy of feminism whereas they want 'equality' yet don't address the abuses they dish out while being excused of such via their 'pussypass'. It shows their moral high ground is actually swampland.   I need feminism because...I need to get away with shit.   This is what we shine the light of truth on in hopes that some day, our children might live in a more evolved sense of equality. We can't sully that with our own flights of fantasy of brutal retribution without turning this forum into the petty fogging of the sex wars.   Let's keep to the high ground please.

PussyPass,2rgrr9,Decessus,10,Tue Jan 6 01:38:05 2015 UTC,"I'll start by saying that this case is about a false accusation of rape which led to a deep mental depression of the man accused. He ended up dying later because of this. Nothing happened to the woman who falsely accused him.  Translation of OP:  Widow of dead ""mototaxist"" who was declared innocent of rape accusations demands “moral justice”.  Felipe Bastos Alves , the man who died in the 28th of last november due to a cardiac arrest, was imprisoned for over two months in the Regional Prison.  To the family of Felipe Bastos Lopes, 33 years of age, the justice’s document saying he’s innocent isn’t enough.  The “mototaxist” (person that rides a motorcycle taxi) was arrested last January 16th accused of rape. However, the DNA test ran by the IGP (institute of investigation) showed that his genetic material wasn’t a match for the crime, which led Lopes to be considered and declared innocent by the judge’s sentence on November 28th.   Now the widow Iasmin dos Santos, 21, tries to realize her husband’s wish that he made before dying 8 days after his absolution. He was fighting a deep depression and on the 28th he didn’t resist to 2 cardiac arrests, leaving behind a widow and an 11 months old daughter.  “My husband was innocent. He spent two and a half months in prison without being able to see the sun. He was tortured with hot water and suffered psychologically with the horrors he saw inside. All this for a crime he didn’t commit”, said the widow.  Felipe Lopes was the suspect of a rape commited in the beggining of 2014, in the morning of January 5th. On this date a 36 years old woman asked for a mototaxi ride on the corner of Lobo da Costa St. with Marechal Deodoro St. Her destination was the citie’s hospital where she had an appointment.  When the doctor wasn’t able to see her, she left the place in the same vehicle, asking the driver to take her back to the corner where they first started the ride. In her testimony to the police, she said that her intentions when she asked for the service was to get back home.   According to the victim, the driver took a different route, going to the Engenho’s Road, in the Areal neighborhood, where he started the abuse. First he attacked her with punches, then he raped and robbed her. Hurt, the woman went to the Ferreira Viana Avenue, where she got help and was taken to the Pelotas Emergency Room.  The police began to investigate all mototaxists that worked those routes. Lopes was recognized in pictures and in person, leading to his “preventive arrest” which was to be served in the Regional Prison of Pelotas, where the mototaxists stayed until the beggining of april.  According to Lopes’ Widow, the drama of bearing the burden of the rape lasted until September, when the result of the DNA test was finally ready. “But during this time my husband got depressed because nobody wanted to employ him. He started selling candies, because he couldn’t get a job, until a man who has a business at the Duque de Caxias Av. decided to give him a chance”.  The 20th of november, the day the justice system declared Felipe Lopes innocent, could have been the symbol of a return to life. But his heart was already weak. “My only wish is that my husband won’t bear the reputation of a rapist.”    Absolutely nothing happened to the woman. And nobody seems to care about it. People are worried that the DNA test took too much (which it did), are worried about the legality of his arrest (which was legal) and are worried about his reputation. NOBODY SEEMS TO GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE LYING IDIOT WHO RUINED THIS MAN’S LIFE.  Video in portuguese about the case: http://g1.globo.com/rs/rio-grande-do-sul/jornal-do-almoco/videos/t/porto-alegre/v/caso-de-mototaxista-preso-inocentemente-em-pelotas-rs-completa-um-ano/3872094/  The video says he was arrested by mistake and that justice has corrected its error, but unfortunatelly the guy died one week after being declared innocent. According to the family his death happened due to a psychotic break.  Then the police chief appears ans says that examination on the victim confirmed the sexual abuse. That the woman identified Felipe Lopes as the perpetrator, the woman had a good degree of certainty of this. That before Felipe went to prison he provided DNA for a test, but that he wasn’t informed of when the result of the test would be ready. That he was arrested for more than 2 months.  His family said he was innocent. His wife said she knew that for a fact because he was with her taking care of their newborn child.   Felipe was released after the victim wasn’t able to convice the judge during the trial hearing.  His wife said that people called her names everywhere she went and that people kept calling her “the wife of the rapist”.  Felipe wasn’t able to get a job, everybody shut him down.  Due to all this he got into a huge depression which led to the usage of drugs. He ended up being admited into a mental institution for a while.  Then came the result of the exame which proved he was innocent. He died one week later.  Absolutely nothing happened to the woman."

She will walk all over you with no consequences.  You defend yourself? You're automatically labeled as an asshole.  So it's a no-win situation.  I used to think that women were the most at fault for this. But not anymore; the problem is the embarrasingly large number of white-knights around that would excuse any shitty behavior from a woman in order to be perceived as ""real men"" and hopefully get laid from the girl. Those spineless men are the most at fault. Giving up your sense of justice and equality in order to get laid or validation strikes me as something really pathetic.  A cut lower lip is a very small price to pay for daring to assault someone physically. If that girl has more than one brain-cell inside her skull she should take this as a lesson for the future."

The laws were created long ago (before the 60's) because it was the only way to even out the risks women took during those days. During that period, women held no position of power, they weren't the breadwinners, and their only position in society was caretakers. So in order to balance some of the power they were lacking, they did so through the courts.  Fast forward to present day women are in the work force, they are bosses/CEOs, they bring home the bacon too. And the White Knights are still pretending they are living in the early 20th century.   But Feminism isn't completely off the hook. They bare some responsibility because this isn't a cause they are in any hurry to take up. For the most part, their victimhood storyline benefits from the unbalanced laws. They are more interested in the areas where they are still behind and increase those benefits before they ever acknowledge the laws that are unfairly in their favor."

One day, out of nowhere, we were walking along, and she had convinced herself that she could read my mind and that I was daydreaming about another girl, and just started wailing on me and screaming at me in a mall. I just said ""fuck this"" and tried to walk away, but she had gotten a death grip on me and refused to let me go.   I had basically given up trying to get away and resorted to a peaceful sort of protest by calmly asking her to just let me go, when a crowd of people gathered around and starting yelling shit like ""stop hitting her!"" (I wasn't even touching her), ""what the fuck did you do to her, asshole?"" and ""shit dude, you better fucking leave her alone!"". I begged them to call the cops multiple times, but everyone continued to yell at me to leave her alone, even though I was stuck in her grasp, being hit repeatedly, not raising even a finger to her.  Some middle aged soccer mom (think Kate Gosselin) finally walked directly up to us and asked my girlfriend if she was okay, and I quickly interrupted and asked her to call the police because I was being hurt (this was long before I had a cellphone). The soccer mom told me to ""shut the fuck up and leave the poor girl alone"".   The soccer mom ended up calling the cops. Although I was nervous what her true intentions were, I was happy that someone had finally called the police so I could tell them what was happening and get the fuck out of there and go home.   When the cops arrived, a few people from the crowd and the soccer mom were pulled aside and ended up telling the police that even though they hadn't seen how it started, I was hurting her, and she was defending herself.  If you had taken even 10 seconds to look at me, it was obvious that nothing had happened to her, and that I was the one with her fingernails broken off in my forearms, bleeding, and my eyes, face and neck were bruised from her hitting and scratching and grabbing at me. But, because I was the guy, I obviously had done SOMETHING to deserve that.   After the police questioned everybody, and absolutely refused to listen to my side or look at my injuries, my girlfriend got taken home and I ended up getting 5150'd (aka put on a mandatory 72 hour psychiatric hold) in a run down hospital where I was beaten up and pissed on by a cracked out homeless guy.

She called in to Tom's show in a frenzy (many many women do) and decided to try to play the part of the big bad powerful woman making up some bullshit story about how she got away with murder.  She's just a stupid idiot that wanted to one-up the other callers to the show.  For anyone who has an ounce of critical thinking ability, it's pretty obvious what this is.  This particular suicide was with a firearm, they did investigate thoroughly at the time it happened, including analysis of the spatter, interviewing the girlfriend who was in the home at the time, talking to his friends, etc etc.  There was NOTHING to indicated she killed him.  This guy had been threatening suicide many times before.  Also, this woman is not very bright.  Trust me, the cops would never be fooled by her.  They aren't THAT fucking stupid.

I hate the system.  I've had guy friends that did want to be dads though, and only receive every other weekend with their kids.  At least in Texas, that seems to be the norm, which I despise.    What I don't like is when the mother gets a shitload of money, and you KNOW she's not spending it all on  housing/food/kid, and using it for herself.    I think there should be a maximum payment.  Sorry if the kid lived a lavish lifestyle, and the system expects the same after a split.  Then again, being a devil's advocate, why should the kid have to suffer if the mother isn't making as much as when they parents were together.  Its tough, but IMO, many wanting fathers get screwed big time.  And women seem to almost always take advantage of it,  use the custody to get back at fathers.  This is from what I've personally seen of friends, family members, and co-workers.  Sorry ladies, its just the way it is for the most part."

The only exception is if one parent (usually the mother) is living in squalor and not creating a safe home environment for the child. If this occurs, then the higher-earning parent helps provide an adequate lifestyle for the other. Obviously it isn't fair for the parent paying out, but in the end it's supposed to go toward the benefit of the child. In a perfect world it would work, but people are easily corruptible."

PussyPass,2qo7m3,s_w_,4,Mon Dec 29 20:11:00 2014 UTC,"This highly depends. In my state child support is based on income. How little the mother makes is a determining factor on how much the man pays. If the woman goes out and gets a shit job she can get more in child support. There is this thing, I forget the actual name of it, but it basically  says someone can contest if one parent is under-employed.  But to be under-employed is a very hard thing to do. A friend of mine spliy up with the mother of his child and they were getting 50% time each and the court just awarded the mother child support. So the father was paying for the kid 50% of the time, and then another 30-35% when the mother had the kid.  When it came down to it, the father was supporting the kid 70% financially. Which he didn't care, he just wanted to see his son. But to me, the fact that the system lets this thin happen is sickening. They just awarded her child support because she make so little. But they can see her work history, how little she has worked, they can see my friend had a steady job of 6 years, they see how often she changes jobs, the gaps of time in between.. And they reward this irresponsibility..  It got down to it where the mother was trying to take the child away from my friend because it meant more in child support.. So my friend threatened to fight for full custody if she wanted to go that route. If he had gotten full custody she would owe a whopping $80 a month in child support. How fucking pathetic.. They were trying to take 25 - 30% of what he made...   The system is backwards. Why are men always expected to stand up and be responsible no matter what but in situations like my friend's where they can see how irresponsible the woman is no one makes her stand up and be responsible.."

The assumption in most states is that if the kid lives with you, most of your income is going to go towards them one way or another i.e. in housing costs, food, clothing, gas driving them around town.  So the less custody you have, the more you have to pay.  The flip side of that is it does without a doubt mean parents fight for custody for kids they don't even want, just because they think it might be cheaper for them than having their wages garnished. I know that is true for my parents. My dad fought like hell for us after he found out custody length is linked to child support obligations in our state. This is the same person who wrote a letter to my grandparents saying that since he was getting divorced he wanted to walk away from his kids & start life over somewhere [he did not know at the time that even if our mom went along with it, she has no legal power to sign away child support obligations]."

But if you work all those hours, you have no time left over to form a meaningful relationship with your child. So you're damned if you do, damned if you don't.   If you're at work, you're a ""bad"" father for not spending time with your kid. If you're spending time with your kid, you're a ""deadbeat"" because you can't afford to pay your child support on time.   Female control of ALL the most effective methods of birth control has led to them being extremely irresponsible and selfish with it.

Wallstreet. Consider Princeton's study which shows that anytime Wallstreet's take on an issue differs from the American people, wallstreet wins. That is to say; if you look at every major piece of legislation of the last 30 years Wallstreet always wins. Intelligence agencies. If the CIA can get away with doing the opposite from what Congress wants by selling narcotics in our inner cities to fund operations that go against the CIA's orders [See: Contra] then that says something profound and disturbing about who is really in control. Sort of related to the other two: The Prison Industrial Complex. Two judges were convicted of taking bribes to send minors to private for profit prisons. But let me ask a question: What happened to the private prison company who paid the bribes? Last I checked it is illegal to bribe public officers, so shouldn't they be punished equally severe? If you guessed that they got away with it with at most a slap on the wrist, you'd be right!   So if you think about it, the problems we see manifesting themselves with our dysfunctional family courts are unlikely to be ressolved. How much money is made just off of those imprisoned ""deadbeats"" who can't make their child support obligations? Even if we ignore the prisons which are themselves sometimes for profit that still leaves:   For profit goods manufactured by prison labor. Commodities like phone service & food that are sold at huge mark ups to inmates. Private companies that are hired to do things for corrections like serving the food, doing the cleaning, providing uniforms or whatever else. Not to mention:  Once someone has a record they are unlikely to be paid a living wage again, so you're helping out these major corporations by creating a workforce that can be paid pennies on the dollar for their service just because of some arbitrary ""record"" that does not indicate necessarily the person's trustworthiness."

If a mom has no education & literally no skills, as is usually the case with a lot of these ""baby momas"" then even if she wanted to change her ways and get an education & a good job, that's a process that is going to take years during which she'll need some way of paying for the kid(s). A lot of these mothers start having kids as teens, sometimes before they're even old enough to work.  There have been gov experiments, IDK if the US has done this, where they've tried giving moms access to free or heavily discounted daycare to allow them to go get an education & a job. But if someone has literally no skills, the daycare is going to cost more than they'll make from any job they will be able to find.  Not that this excuses it, mind you. I am a strong believer that people should never have kids they can't afford and every aspect of our society would improve if we had a way of helping people act accordingly. A lot of this multigenerational welfare stuff would be gone in a generation if we made access to contraceptives, abortions, and sterilization surgeries free & easy to get... while also making it an automatic disqualifier to reproduce while on any gov aid programs. But both the left and the right of our mainstream politics would be disgusted by such a proposal (the right for religious reasons, the left due to emotion-driven knee jerk reactions of calling it genocide or eugenics). So instead I would expect nothing beyond arguments over the funding of these programs, which really only punishes the kids {I doubt many like having their dads thrown in prison for not making child support} who are innocent in all this."
PussyPass,2qo7m3,sg92i,14,Mon Dec 29 17:34:36 2014 UTC,"Once a woman gets pregnant, she has the right to abort the fetus. This essentially gives her the ability to prevent the burden of a child before it happens. If the mother has the right and ability to abort the child, then the father should have the right to say he either wants her to get an abortion/give the child up for adoption, or give up all rights and responsibilities to the child to be. This would basically give the male abortion rights, without forcing the mother to do so. If the mother decides to carry the fetus to term, then she would be completely responsible for it because the choice was completely hers. The fact that the child will no longer have a father around, or money from him is immaterial to the question because the child was completely the choice of the mother. If she was incapable of taking care of the child on her own, she shouldn't have made the decision to carry it to term. Yes the child may have it rougher, but that is not the fathers fault, it's the mothers. If the child is brought to term with the fathers knowledge and without protest, then he would forfeit his right to give up rights and responsibilities because the child was both their decision, not just hers. Many people are saying that even if the mother brings the child to term against his protests, it should still be his responsibility because he failed to use birth control or made a poor choice of sexual partner. The problem with this argument is that birth control is fallible. There are very few completely effective birth control treatments on the market. Furthermore, the mother could easily lie about being on birth control. As for choosing a your sexual partners more wisely, you can't know everything about a person, or how they will react in any given circumstance no matter how well you know them."

So then what happens when the mother is poor? The kid will go on all kinds of social welfare programs and cost the gov a boat full of money.  Child support reduces the gov's costs, because even if he can't pay enough to get the kid out of foodstamps & subsidized health care it will at least make things cheaper.  Meanwhile, threatening the dad with prison for not making or working enough also serves the state's interests by helping the prison industrial complex. If a dad looses his job, can't pay his bills, and ends up in prison then that makes a lot of people a lot of money between 1- prison labor [they manufacture military armor & man call centers in our prisons] 2- prison contractors [prison phone providers, food providers, commissary etc] 3- prison operators [if applicable: i.e. private for-profit prisons & private for-profit firms employing the guards].

If anything, encouraging it for people who don't want kids, or can't afford kids, or aren't ready for kids, benefits the state & our society at large.  Consider how accidental pregnancy currently can force both parents into poverty if it happens at the wrong time in the lives- the dad saddled w/ child support and the mom forced to abandon things like higher education. These two parents hustling to provide for the kid can't spend that time & energy becoming more productive members of society.  Or so the argument goes anyway."

He then thought ""gee, if I have to get divorced I rather just start life completely over, marry someone else, and have new kids"" and had no interest in seeing or supporting his existing kids again.  Imagine going from having a dad who actually cared about you & was a great provider to someone who would never let you see him again just because he suddenly found he couldn't live the life he wanted to.  He would work under the table to avoid his obligations, and would take my mom to court every year around christmas to fight over his obligations. Why christmas? It was his way of revenge: he wanted her so broke she could not afford christmas presents. And it worked."

Following that: this is a very derisive topic, after all, if we are talking about legal disowning, we are also talking up the scenario that a woman legally disowns a child prior to it's birth but the father still wants it, what is the woman supposed to be now? A gestation tank?  Of course we could apply the same cold heartedness that feminists apply to men and say, 'she shouldn't have done the act if she didn't want her fate', but the reality is a bit more gruesome because women can abort their children without the aid of a medical professional.  So you would have to make a new crime that is basically, outlawing an abortion when one parent has disowned a child but the other wants to keep it.  So this is really, quite a dark topic to talk up."

PussyPass,2qo7m3,ThePedanticCynic,1 point,Mon Dec 29 04:49:05 2014 UTC,"What it comes down to is feminists are fucking retarded. All of them. And the ones who are most vocal are psychos.  They confuse terms all the time for sensationalism to convert undecideds and vilify opponents. Sex and rape are the same thing to them; so if a man admits he had sex with a woman then he's admit to raping her if she says so.  In this instance they're confusing conception with birth. Yes, a man does help in the conception, but he has no say over the birth of the child. Zero. None. Therefore the only fair and reasonable thing would be to allow him to disown the child and not pay child support, if he so chooses.  There hasn't been a reasonable feminist in decades, so never try to converse with one. I have met a few on reddit who say things like ""we're not all like that"", but after some probing it turns out they're exactly like that. You might as well be talking to a creationist.

PussyPass,2qo7m3,ThePedanticCynic,-3,Mon Dec 29 05:29:10 2014 UTC,"I would like to respond to this, or at least add to the discussion. Let me first say im not passing judgment on whether or not men should have a choice in whether or not they pay child support.  Keeping that in mind, I want to say that the right to your own body is such a different thing than where your paycheck goes. I cannot see anyway that it is comparable to use one as justification for the other.  On a side note I would like to offer some advice for all the men out there. If your partner uses birth control, find out what they are using and understand how it is supposed to be used. Further more check to make sure it is being taken or used correctly. Do not rely simply on what you are told by your partner.   I once read the instructions on my girlfriends birth control and as i remember it if you miss taking your pill you have to start the whole thing over from the beginning, including the one month adjustment where you are not protected. That was NOT how it was explained to me by my gf at the time and she often forgot to take them when she was supposed to or miss a a couple days completely and take 2 the next day. Lets just say im glad i always used a condom.  I found out that most pregnancies that happen while on birth control is simple human error and not the product not working.  TL:DR Pregnancy does not equate to income: And ALWAYS read the instructions before putting your dick into it.  EDIT: 2 words removed because I like pressing buttons more than proofreading"

How do you think people earn a paycheck? I'm assuming you're a slacker, and thus have no idea that people actually work for their money, but for the rest of us we have to sacrifice our time; and when it comes to physical labor our bodies as well. Do you think a woman's right to decide is more important than roughly 40 hours a month of a man's time? That her decision should obligate the next 18 years of a man's paycheck? He is now legally obligated to maintain a job over that time.   They are the same. A woman's right over her body doesn't override my rights over mine. What the fuck is wrong with you?"

It is wrong to force one person to suffer the consequences of another person's decision, especially one that lasts 18 years.  What about when the man wants the child and the woman doesn't?

We have that for over 30 years. I am male and ""Parking only for women"" is normal for me. Legally I can park as a man over there, but I stick to the rule.  The sense of the woman parking is the path to the output must be possible shortly. And also usually brightly lit. This provides security for women. I'm not angry about that than you. It is okay for me.  Also at supermarkets, we often have parking ""only for women"". Not bad, Germany loves his women.  Happy 2015, Emil"

PussyPass,2qjagc,MaunaLoona,-2,Wed Jan 7 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"In a nutshell it goes back to studies starting in the 90ies which showed that women are afraid to use certain public areas like parks, underpasses, railway stations or similar ""classy"" dark dimly lit areas because because they are afraid of being attacked.  Since a portion of your citizens actively avoiding certain areas more than others is both something that's not exactly cool but also costing huge amounts of money city planning started to take those things into account.   Areas were redesigned, dedicated parking spaces for women were introduced (what the difference is exactly is up to the state, common things are e.g. being closer to exits, being more brightly lit and being camera monitored) and, in a case like above, it's highly likely that those seats are closer to the front aka closer to the driver.  It is socially completely accepted (people not having to worry about their own or someone else's safety is pretty awesome), is lucrative (more customers in areas that were avoided beforehand) and doesn't hurt the other gender at all because people are smart about it (I don't recall a single case of a man I know being chased off a woman's parking space when the entire thing was full for example).  So, yeah, this is imho a really great case of something good that ""feminism"" has introduced in the sense that it came from recognizing a clear difference in perception the genders have and helped evening out things without any harm done (on the contrary, most things were clearly improved for both genders based on this idea) for the other side. Not to mention all the awesome jokes it has made possible.  I'd save my ammunition for cases of actual privilege."

PussyPass,2qjagc,PavleKreator,3,Sun Dec 28 08:06:40 2014 UTC,"I never claimed it was. Neither does the police, nor does the government. What counts however is that the fear itself exists and measures like these improve life for a decent amount of the population - besides not doing harm or being lucrative.  (As a side note according to German crime statistics women are more often victims to sexual crimes than men - just not in public places.)  In fact there are quite some modern Feminists that are very openly against these things because they both ""portray a weak female image"" and also because they ""distract from where most of the crime against women actually occurs"".  As a result of the above (and because areas got more safer in general) e.g. Switzerland removed those kind of parking slots in certain areas while most Germans still seem to prefer them existing.  Personally? Feeling safe is an important part of ones quality of life to me. Sure, ideally educating people that there is nothing to be afraid of in the first place would be preferable but until such things are actually rolling I highly prefer crutches like these over ignoring the issue."

You can read here   The Fort Collins woman told police in November that Dustin Toth, then 25, had kidnapped her from the Windsor Safeway parking lot, and drugged and raped her at knifepoint at his nearby home before she was able to run from the house.  Toth was arrested, but the case against him was quickly dropped when police discovered Bennett had fabricated the entire story.   As for the woman:   Katherine Bennett, 21, was sentenced to 32 days in the Weld County Jail, 180 days of electronic home monitoring   Here is what has come of the false report for the man:   As a result of the false report, Toth said he lost his job at OtterBox and was barred from deploying with his Army National Guard team to Cuba. He has since struggled to find work, been denied on multiple apartment applications and has become prone to anxiety attacks, he told the judge Friday."

PussyPass,2qjajp,thelordofcheese,6,Sat Dec 27 22:07:34 2014 UTC,If the parents brought it into criminal or civil court first the local DA might have drawn up charges against the local school system.   But in all likelyhood the chances of that are low... as the city would be fighting itself and forced to defend the teacher in question as a school employee.   The best course of action is to take out outside of the city and go to state civil court and get money for the damage they caused to the child. They have a lawyer and .. I'm sure thats what they're doing.  The days worth or recordings is their evidence and I'm sure it's going to be a slam shut case if that's admitted.   IF not the court of public opinion is being made right not with the media attention  (that's why the woman was on indefinite leave & until the teachers union cuts her off from support)
PussyPass,2qjajp,flip69,2,Sun Dec 28 00:24:44 2014 UTC,That is a very precise answer.  The cunts should be in jail. I as a man do this to your kid and I am in jail. 2 Women do it and your answer above is why they are not in jail.
PussyPass,2qjajp,flip69,1 point,Sun Dec 28 01:18:11 2014 UTC,"Yes. I do believe that there have been both men and women that have gone  to jail for the abuse of children. But outside  of clear sexual or physical abuse many school districts are reluctant to have charges filed for the reason I've given (above)   Many will choose to handle these internally and avoid media attention.. This is why I believe the parents have now taken  this case to the media, so the can't  continue to sweep it under the rug.   There's lots of abusive sports coaches that call their players names and swear at them...  That's still something that exists and  still has a blind eye turned towards it in many small towns.   Even sexual abuse has had a blind eye and school coverup for male coaches (I'm talking about you penn state). I do believe that all of those people should be I. Jail for the damage that was done to all those little boys all those years... And although it took some time some of those abusers are sitting in a cell that keep society safe.   Men do not get harped on if the demean their students at the right time and place. (Sports).  What these women did was to demean the girl and they're going to get fired for it and most likely not be able to work around kids again.  The he school system will settle out of court if they can with the family."

PussyPass,2qlt2m,Cosmic_Bard,3,Mon Dec 29 06:32:00 2014 UTC,"there is a simple answer to this question   This'll be good.   if a woman hits you, or physically abuses you, as a man, you need to walk away to somewhere you are safe.   That's probably a smart idea for being hit by anybody, I'm not sure why this has to be a sexist comment.   no matter whether she is bigger than you   Then what's the point?  The whole point of chivalry is to shelter the weak and those who can't fight.  We don't consider them either of these things any longer.  Women are our equals and they can serve in the military and be shot at and killed like a nice other comment pointed out.   or if she is trained in martial arts; NEVER hit a woman.   If she's trained in martial arts and is attacking me, she's not only a threat, but she's disrespecting her martial training.  I would defend myself to the best of my ability against any reasonable threat.   the complicated answer is: if you are in danger, genuine danger and fear of your life or your safety, then, and ONLY then, is it okay to hit a woman back.   If I'm being attacked by a heavier adversary (physics, hello?) I'm in danger.  If I'm being attacked by a trained adversary, I'm in danger.  Moreover, even if you aren't either of these things, you could have a weapon even if you're four foot nine and one hundred pounds.  You could have a knife or a gun. Or you could gouge my eyes out.  Or improvise a weapon and stab me.  Any thousands of things could happen in a fight."

EVERYTHING in this video indicates that she is in the wrong and that the guy did not do anything to hurt her.

It is named after Duluth, Minnesota, the city where it was developed.  The program was largely founded by Ellen Pence and Michael Paymar.   As of 2006 [update], the Duluth Model is the most common batterer intervention program used in the United States.  It is based in feminist theory positing that ""domestic violence is the result of patriarchal ideology in which men are encouraged and expected to control their partners"".  Critics argue that the method can be ineffective as it was developed without minority communities in mind and can fail to address root psychological or emotional causes of abuse.

PussyPass,2q5dqs,ReputableSourceA,-15,Tue Dec 23 18:42:36 2014 UTC,"Come one this is a stretch. I watched the video twice, when is the rape accusation? Normally I ask reverse the roles and see what would happen, but I can see a guy stopping some girl from driving home drunk, at least to the point the cops get there and he can say 'she's trying to drive home drunk, I stalled her as long as I could, it's on you guys now'. Just the slightest benefit of the doubt, we don't know if he loves ten miles away and just telling her what she wants to hear. She might have saved his life or someone else's life on the road. Drunk drivers are inherently selfish. If the cops show up and are needed to get him into a cab whatever.  This doesn't seem like a 'you can't leave me I love you'. More like a 'stop being stupid you don't know what you're doing. Let's be rational about this."
PussyPass,2q5dqs,sovietterran,13,Tue Dec 23 13:33:09 2014 UTC,"She didn't say ""I'll call the cops on you drunk driving"" she said she'll call the cops on her bruises. He could have had a cab or a friend picking him up. I doubt he was drunk based on the speech and camera holding ability (quickly moving it when she might have shown too much skin). She may have had good intentions, he should have gotten more context on why she woke him up, but this is a very crazy way of going about keeping someone from drunk driving."

What we have here is a guy who probably got a bit drunk, fell asleep at her place and she wanted attention.

Even with video like this, it's going to be an uphill fight.   You can bet the farm she will be playing the pussy card hard, by crying and carrying on like the 'poor widdle abused girly' and they will get hardons instantly and he's in deep shit.   If he muscled his way past her, she'd drop a dime to the pigs, they'd show up, she'd crying big crocodile tears and show her 'bruises'. They go find him and if he's been drinking even a little, they are going to think he's guilty and a woman beating prick for them to put the hammer to.   He'd have to jump in his vehicle and zoom off and stay off their radar for a damn long time. This means hiding his vehicle and not going home, laying low, probably losing his job unless he's got some bros who will give him a solid alibi.   It's all super problematic, especially if you are a law abiding citizen, a good innocent guy just trying to be solid and do the right thing. If you aren't well versed in fucking the system like a pro, it's going to hammer you and this fucking bitch knows it. She knows he's not a thug, hence she's playing that pussy pass card all out."

Also, from the article:  Bianco said a sentence in the standard range for the conviction was appropriate, and denied Dickey’s request to not immediately impose the sentence.  “You were found guilty Aug. 19, you’ve had almost four months to prepare for this,” Bianco said.  Bianco said the Pennsylvania Sexual Offenders Assessment Board determined Woods is not a sexually violent predator, but she would be required because of the pornography-possession conviction to register her address, workplaces and schools she attends for 15 years following her release from jail.  Doesn't sound like much of a pass to me."
PussyPass,2pll0h,thelordofcheese,35,Wed Dec 17 19:49:41 2014 UTC,"Doesn't sound like much of a pass to me.   I disagree, especially when they start her off at the base-minimum for what the law allows them to sentence her with. (Indiana Law states the Sentence is anywhere from 6 Months to 6 years. At the least, the malice and intent-to-harm/frame an innocent person qualifies her for the latter half of severity.) She not only furthered the demand for materials that require victimization of children to produce, she intended to use this material as a way to harm an innocent person (Her husband), who would subsequently be victimized yet again in the prison system, had she succeeded.  This goes past simple negligence, and into outright depravity, which justifies the harsher penalties. Compare with a typical case from Indiana courtrooms where a male gets 3 years, on average, and you have a Pussy Pass established quite ardently.  Also, one last bit...   Bianco said the Pennsylvania Sexual Offenders Assessment Board determined Woods is not a sexually violent predator   Of course not, she just intended to get others to enact her violence for her, or to enact her violence in an indirect fashion. This is why murder investigators often immediately begin with a female-suspect-profile when the MO has been poisoning. Indirect violence has been a female-based MO for centuries, and this is a prime example of that. But an attempt to get others to enact violence in your stead, is still an attempted assault against that person, albeit indirectly, and just as, if not more, sinister, due to the innocents it ropes into the malignant cause."

This kind of behavior out of her probably isn't something new, and it needs to be on police record. Imagine how nuts she is if she's got a husband or boyfriend. By charging her with this, it helps establish grounds to sort her out for bad behavior if it continues.   Perhaps she's abusive to others, to her kid even. Teaching her child this is  how to react isn't doing him any favors. Letting a little kid run wild in a skateboard park is just plain irresponsible. Anyone with an ounce of sense knows it's a place set aside for skateboarders to do their thing so that accidents like this doesn't happen.   Two things should happen from this. One, she is arrested, charged and punished for assault. Second, child services needs to take a look at this kid's situation. My clue is that she's making a big deal out of it being his birthday for her own reasons. That should have no bearing in the normal mind. But if this is an abusive parent out to try to make up for crappy parenting by making his birthday 'special', this might screw that up, hence the unseemly reaction.   The choice of taking the little fellow to such a place is also a sign of crappy parenting, not to mention the fact she wasn't close to him in such a clime."

I'm 100% with you, he had no business being brought there and the shitty mom was probably making a lazy attempt at doing something with him and making it seem, to the child, like it was Disneyland. Kind of a tangent, but I hate parents that do this. There are times when I can't even skate because some shitty parent is letting their kid run around the skatepark, it's even worse when they bring them there with a scooter (not meant to be in a skatepark, it's like taking your kid to play soccer on the basketball court.) because then they're going in the halfpipe or playing on the ramps and you're left with absolutely nowhere to go because if you run into them on accident, you're the monster."

I'm not a skater, I haven't been on a skateboard since 1978, but I think they are fun, and the things people do on them are amazing to me. I tried jumping with a skate board ONCE as a kid and faceplanted on concrete. That being said, I personally support skate parks and them being a safe haven for those using it properly not to be messed with.   If you think shitty parents are bad by bringing their kids to skate parks like that, I have an even more depressing bit of information so to make those you have to endure look less monstrous. lol.   There are shitty parents who will take their kid to an amusement park, make a great day of it, then abandon them there never to see them again. It's some sick thing, I guess to have one last day with them, make it fun, then leave them. I couldn't imagine the horror or heartbreak for a child that something like that happens to. What kind of monster would do that to a little kid? It fucks me up to even ponder it.   Now you can remember that bit of horror when you have to deal with shitty retarded parents at your skate park, but be slightly comforted that at least they aren't that bad. They will take them home at least.   Happy Holidays...lol...I'm not right. I know it."

PussyPass,2p9s37,autowikibot,8,Sun Dec 14 16:58:34 2014 UTC,"Genene Jones:       Genene Anne Jones (born July 13, 1950) is a former pediatric nurse who killed somewhere between 1 and 46 infants and children in her care. She used injections of digoxin, heparin and later succinylcholine to induce medical crises in her patients, with the intention of reviving them afterward in order to receive praise and attention. These medications are known to cause heart paralysis and other complications when given as an overdose. Many children, however, did not survive the initial attack and could not be revived. The exact number of murders remain unknown, as hospital officials allegedly first misplaced then destroyed records of her activities to prevent further litigation after Jones' first conviction.

PussyPass,2p9s37,WolfeBane84,7,Sun Dec 14 18:01:16 2014 UTC,The death sentence can only be used in capital murder cases(murder for gain).  These murders were not for her or anyones gain.
PussyPass,2p9s37,chubbysumo,8,Sun Dec 14 18:34:27 2014 UTC,"Except it was her gain, just not of a strictly material gain.  If her plan had gone smoothly she was receiving praise (and for being so ""awesome"" possibly promotions).  That's gain even without the promotions."

PussyPass,2p6bfp,muckymann,24,Sun Dec 14 00:04:57 2014 UTC,"It's called aggravated assault. She hit him and then stood up and backed away after getting slapped. When he stood up and approached her again as she was up against the door, he could have let it be.  That she wasn't attacking him at that point and he went after her is the definition of aggravated assault (not under immediate or imminent attack, as she backed away and yet he still approached her to continue fighting). What he could have done is stood up and waited for her to leave the scene or for the stop and he do the same. If she came after him again, he still could only respond with equal or lesser force to the attack. I live in Alberta, that's the law. (equal or lesser force = If you slap me and I break your fucking arm, that's aggravated assault)"
PussyPass,2p6bfp,OrdainedPuma,-21,Sun Dec 14 00:31:36 2014 UTC,"That's because you're thirsty for violence against women.  A reasonable person would view an equal or lesser response as being a reasonable response.  The only reason to use more force is to eliminate a serious threat of imminent bodily harm.  A slap does not qualify.  Say, were you bullied in high school?  Because you sound like someone who is bitter because he was bullied in high school."

If someone slaps me, chokes me, and pulls my hair, no one should have no qualms with me decking them. I didn't do anything but sit there being peaceful and you're going to be violent with me?  No. You're objectively wrong and deserve whatever comes you way, including my fist."
PussyPass,2p6bfp,RalphWaldoNeverson,14,Mon Dec 15 11:11:44 2014 UTC,"(equal or lesser force = If you slap me and I break your fucking arm, that's aggravated assault)   That part is never really defined well. Does equal or lesser force refer to Newtons? Like if she hits me with 50N of force I can retaliate with 50N? What if she's fragile as fuck and has osteoporosis and 50N of force breaks her bone since she didn't drink enough milk growing up? Would I get aggravated assault?  Then maybe it shouldn't be ""equal or lesser force."" Maybe it should be ""equal or lesser damage."""
PussyPass,2p6bfp,calviso,5,Mon Dec 15 00:46:29 2014 UTC,"LOL i love this analogy. I would assume realistically they look at the ""damage"" factor. Though it would be hilarious if the crime scene recreation team busts out some springs and tries to recreate the scene by calculating F=k*x"

PussyPass,2p6bfp,calviso,1 point,Sun Dec 14 01:06:49 2014 UTC,"That part is never really defined well. Does equal or lesser force refer to Newtons?   It has more to do with how the attack is performed as well as the damage it causes. Basically it means, that if someone hits you, you can hit back, but not kick. The idea is that someone pushing you does not give right for you to shoot them, but rather to use the same kinds of means to defend yourself.  There are grey areas in this when it comes to people who have martial arts training, when facing multiple assailants and when dealing with more powerful/larger assailants.  Overall you can't just blind textbook logic in these cases, but have to take them case by case. Someone who is 140cm tall and weights 40kg is not the same as someone who weights 120kg and is 210cm tall."

No one said ""call the guards here"" when she started beating him. People don't give a shit if you are a man getting beat by a woman. It looks like she was leaving the train and could have seriously hurt someone on her way home. She is a grade-A psycho. Him calling the police would not guarantee her getting arrested because they would need to find her first. If this woman had a knife she'd kill someone. I can bet my life on it.  If someone beats you, you don't have to take that. If someone attacks you, for no reason, you have the right to fucking defend yourself and not sit there like some dog with an abusive owner. It escalated into something that didn't need to be when she first attacked him. Period.  I honestly don't care about your story or your shadow ban."
PussyPass,2p6bfp,that_nagger_guy,7,Sat Dec 13 23:19:46 2014 UTC,"People don't give a shit if you are a man getting beat by a woman.   Trust me, I know, I put up with it for more than 4 years. I had a police officer pull a gun on me when I never laid hands on my ex after she had been preventing me from getting in my car and going home. That doesn't make it even a little bit right to start attacking someone after they had given up on fighting.    It looks like she was leaving the train and could have seriously hurt someone on her way home.   A) That's incredibly unlikely.  B) That's not this guy's responsibility, he's not a cop and he's not a fucking super hero.    Him calling the police would not guarantee her getting arrested because they would need to find her first.   Then he would need to follow her and make sure that they find her. That's what I would have done.   If this woman had a knife she'd kill someone. I can bet my life on it.   Yeah, try to make that argument stand up in court. People aren't guilty of crimes they haven't committed.    If someone attacks you, for no reason, you have the right to fucking defend yourself and not sit there like some dog with an abusive owner.   But you don't have the right to attack them after they've walked away. You need to look up the definition of self-defense."
PussyPass,2p6bfp,diesel_stinks_,1 point,Sat Dec 13 23:23:09 2014 UTC,"A) That's incredibly unlikely.   So because something is unlikely no one should give a shit? What if she got out of the train, walked over to the next line and pushed some poor bastard onto the tracks and he got run over? Incredibly unlikely? Sure, but have you seen this fucking psycho?   B) That's not this guy's responsibility, he's not a cop and he's not a fucking super hero.    Then who's responsibility is it? He got attacked, he has a fucking right to attack back.    Then he would need to follow her and make sure that they find her. That's what I would have done.   So when he follows her for justice and to prevent her from doing any more damage to someone else like he did in the video, he is doing a bad thing BUT when he is following her after she left the train (remember, this man probably lives somewhere and wants to get home) and putting himself in even more danger (remember, she viciously beat him and is a fucking psycho) it is not a bad thing?   Yeah, try to make that argument stand up in court. People aren't guilty of crimes they haven't committed.    Who brought up what stands in court? This is Reddit. Get over yourself. The crime she committed was an unprovoked attack.   But you don't have the right to attack them after they've walked away. You need to look up the definition of self-defense.   I know what self-defense means. Don't be a condenscending prick. I don't care what you say I have the right to do or not to do. If I was out and some guy just punched me and walked away I wouldn't just stand there or walk the other direction. I don't give two shits if he is walking away. He attacks me and he is getting attacked back. Simple as that."

There is usually one male in a group who is saying something and the others are telling him to quit complaining.  What pisses me off is that I am a male and I have to deal with other males who enable this behavior. I say it all of the time.  I've worked so many places where I and someone else was in charge. A female is testing her limits. I try and put a stop too it and the other person in charge just says right in front of her, Why do you care so much?  Then when the female won't listen or do her job the other person wonders why...   And then you have the guys who don't care how horrible of a person a woman is.

Fucking the boss for a raise or crying rape to get out of negative judgement still requires the woman to initiate the process. She presses play and system runs itself from there on out.   If a woman decides to use the ""I'm a dumb defenseless woman don't blame"" defense then she's just as complicit for the bullshit out come as are anyone who then grants the pass. Let's say a hypothetical woman were to  commit a crime and was adamant about receiving the  written punishment for her offense, however,  everyone else then decides for her she can't be responsible for her actions because she is a woman and gives her the pass.

PussyPass,2onh5g,Goldfulgore,7,Mon Dec 8 22:36:42 2014 UTC,Berta Lovejoy makes an appearance in the comments section.
PussyPass,2onh5g,Involution88,34,Mon Dec 8 22:04:59 2014 UTC,"""Don't raise your hands"", ""why not, what do you mean don't raise my bloody hands"" it's like she's saying what are you gonna do about it, you can't do anything and you know it. And of course everyone goes over to comfort HER and make sure SHE'S okay."
PussyPass,2onh5g,usernameintensifies,36,Mon Dec 8 15:28:02 2014 UTC,"Everybody surrounded her. Make no mistake, nobody started attacking Gordon Ramsay. You say they surrounded her to make sure that she is okay, I say they surrounded her to create space between her and Gordon Ramsay and to ensure that she can't go on a rampage. The next step is to create space for her in the direction of the exit. Accomplished by having the young woman between her and Ramsay maintaining her distance to the angry person and having the male confidant in a blue cap ""pulling"" her towards him by being her ""ally"" while moving towards the exit. Those nice words were an attempt to calm her down. The way she was handled is the most effective way to handle men who become violent too. They were a bit overeager in trying to convince her to leave while she was in an absolutely disagreeable state of mind.  Mad respect for the kitchen staff. They could teach most cops a thing or two about handling a dicey situation.  Gordon Ramsay handled the situation like a boss.  Edit: I would not have cared if Ramsey had decided to punch her instead."
PussyPass,2onh5g,tupendous,2,Mon Dec 8 21:06:32 2014 UTC,I would have broken her wrist the second time she tried to slap.

PussyPass,2onh5g,stoobah,-9,Mon Dec 8 17:18:01 2014 UTC,"This is not female privilege.  Her violence is countered peacefully (physical and verbal blockage). If anything, this contrasts with the other videos showcasing the complete inaction of bystanders as well as the person being on the receiving end (apologizing as they're getting hit, furthering the idea that the perp is right in her actions).  Just because people don't hit back doesn't mean it's a privilege. She's still getting blocked and told to stop.  Her attitude is self-righteous, but that's not a gender privilege. Anyone throwing a temper tantrum behaves this way.  I behave the same way when people hit me (rare event) knowing that escalating is no good.  Post-karmic realization: Okay, this place is officially a circlejerk. I'm out."
PussyPass,2onh5g,Cryptonix,14,Mon Dec 8 18:28:23 2014 UTC,"I think the idea is that if it had been a man, he'd have been arrested, whereas this woman was simply talked down.  Edit: Also, the fact that she felt that being mildly offended was a valid reason to (try to) hit a man in the face."
PussyPass,2onh5g,Mister_Sensual,-1,Mon Dec 8 19:15:40 2014 UTC,"The whole idea of these slice of hell shows is to watch people be drilled and get mad. Violence, while most likely prohibited by contract, is kind of expected. It doesn't happen often, but it does. Knowing that, had Gordon been a woman and this woman a man, I see no compelling reason to believe that it would be any different. If you have actual evidence of this kind of thing happening where a drama-propelled show leads a man to get up in the tough, blunt female host's face and try and hit her only to be blocked almost completely by her sheer might, then I might be convinced. It's all conditional. There isn't some underlying, inherent reality that women are always given the edge. They are too often, but not always because of white-knighthood and female privilege. The context of this is too obvious and conditional for me to be convinced."

PussyPass,2onh5g,myspamhere,8,Mon Dec 8 18:37:29 2014 UTC,Because Gordon Ramsey understands that people do irrational things sometimes. Not everyone who see red for a second and does something stupid deserves to be thrown in jail. I think it's punishment enough that this video is now public.
PussyPass,2onh5g,Former_KGB,-3,Mon Dec 8 21:23:00 2014 UTC,"Sorry this just means she is the kind of person that will resort to physical violence.  If people were not there to stop her, I bet she would have went for a weapon."
PussyPass,2onh5g,Shaojack,2,Mon Dec 8 21:25:11 2014 UTC,"No, you can't assume that. She is clearly aggravated and tired, but it does't mean she is trying to kill Ramsey. Look, I'm not defending her actions. All I'm saying is sometimes people don't feel the need to press charges and that's fine."
PussyPass,2onh5g,myspamhere,2,Mon Dec 8 21:29:53 2014 UTC,So anyone who has hit or tried to hit a person ever should be labeled a violent criminal.

PussyPass,2onh5g,myspamhere,5,Mon Dec 8 23:55:52 2014 UTC,"I guess that makes me a violent criminal, my older cousin use to antagonize they hell out of me to the point I once hit him.  I guess violent people like me should remain in prison forever since we are prone to violent outbursts.  We should apply blanket titles for everything, makes it so much easier to slap easy labels on things and not worry about the rest."
PussyPass,2onh5g,Shaojack,-1,Tue Dec 9 01:27:08 2014 UTC,"Strawman argue much?  Can I play too? So hitting people is OK, and we should remove all battery crimes from the legal code.

PussyPass,2onh5g,InternetFree,2,Tue Dec 9 06:07:02 2014 UTC,"This whole argument has been a strawman argument. No one said hitting people is ok.

PussyPass,2onh5g,Shaojack,-5,Tue Dec 9 07:12:30 2014 UTC,Yes.  She was violent and did something criminal. That's what the word means.

Every person ever can be pushed to physical violence.  I am not even saying she was right, she was clearly wrong.  If I play a bad joke on my girlfriend and she gets super upset and punches my arm, is she a violent criminal?"

PussyPass,2okdn8,Space_Ninja,115,Sun Dec 7 20:57:42 2014 UTC,"Quick note: I'm posting this to both /r/MensRights and /r/PussyPass, and I've made an archive of the comments just in case.  This is the type of fucking bullshit that makes my blood boil.   2 years ago, the guys around my cubicle were borderline sexually harassing me.   What the fuck does ""borderline"" mean here? Either you were sexually harassed, or you weren't. Fucking weasel words, right off the bat.   I went to my manger's office, hinting that my coworkers are pushing me to the point of quitting. He brings up a open position that pays an extra 75k per year that will have it's own office and I can stay there secluded for most of the day. The way he looked at me, I knew what he was hinting at. I asked him when he wants to talk about it. He says he'll pay for a motel and we'll both get off two hours before work ends. Nothing straight forward was said. I couldn't even text my husband for the rest of the day. I arrived and we were there for around an hour. No one ever got suspicious afterwards.   So let me get this straight: you decide to complain about sexual harassment, get sexually harassed by your boss, and accept his disgusting proposition as a solution to your problem. What kind of fucking logic is that?   Was it worth it? No no no NO! The next morning, I realized something very important. I didn't need that extra money. I could have just quit and found another job. Now I feel like an outcast in my family, a person who would sell out love for money.  I convinced my husband to put the extra money until our kid's college fund for a few years, and then until a vacation account for when they're in their late teens and we can go on a nice cruise, possible have them bring their girlfriends or boyfriends. I'm not spending a dime of that money on me, and I know that's not enough to make up for what I did.   Of course it isn't enough to make up for what you did; all you're doing is trying to assuage your own guilt. If you had even a modicum of integrity, you'd have told your husband immediately.   I haven't told him only because of our children. They have a great life and I'm not strong enough to break that.   Well isn't that a convenient display of mental gymnastics? Do something repugnant, and then play the fucking martyr. Self-serving and fucking reprehensible.  And now, for the grand finale; here it is folks, some of the most stomach-churning advice I've ever seen:   Unlike the other posters, I will say this: Don't tell him. All you'll be doing is wrecking his life and your children's lives to salve your own guilt. We all make mistakes, some much larger than others, obviously. The question is whether you learned from your mistake, and it sounds like you have. Learn from the mistake, forgive yourself, and work to make your family's life and your own the best it can be. That's how you do penance for a mistake.   Unbelievable. She betrays her husband and family, and your advice for her is to take zero responsibility for her actions and live a lie for the rest of her life. And to top it top it off, you have the fucking temerity to call it ""penance"" just because she regrets it. This is beyond fucking repulsive. Reverse the genders, and you can bet your ass nearly everyone would (rightly) tell a man to come clean and face the consequences."

Or having a career. Or the patriarchy. Or anything else they can think of to ensure a woman never has to take responsibility for her actions."

For a person working in a cubicle this would mean at least a double in pay. Now, she says she works with a pack of perverted men right? And she says, ""no one suspected a thing."" We all know rumors are the lifeblood of any workplace. There's no way she left 2 hours early, same time as her boss, got a $1,450/week promotion and her own office all within a short period of time and no one suspected anything.

Females would cry about how they didn't feel safe or couldn't do something so they got handed an easy job.  If I ended up being the only person working out of a group and I so much as asked where the others went I was screamed at and told, Stop fucking crying!"
PussyPass,2okdn8,koreandragn,7,Mon Dec 8 01:16:21 2014 UTC,"I did not have an integrated division.   I went in undesignated and got sent to Deck. Females could do quals they needed and on the job training during work hours. Males had to do all of that stuff in their spare time. Which we had very little of.  Plus females weren't expected to work, and only around 4 of them did.    When I cranked I went to cargo where all we did was move food into the galleys. The people who were permanently assigned to cargo would break all of the food out and we would come in at night and move the food up to the 2nd deck and into the galleys.  We all had landings we were responsible for. My landing was the only one that ever got dirty. Every one else's landing was dry goods. Mine was fruits and vegetables.   Everyone else had 1 landing, I had 5 because there were 4 decks between mine. Plus my main one was right outside the office. It is also where all of the cleaning supplies were stored.  So every morning we would muster and everyone would get off but me. I'd have to scrub the floors of my landing. Then because everyone else was left and I was the only one left the Chief in charge would  have me do other things that needed to get done.  I was going to bed 4 hours after everyone else daily. (We were off at 8.) What the people in the office and Chief would do is move the trash from the office onto my landing so it would become my responsibility. No one would separate the trash so I'd have to sort through it to take it to the trash rooms.  I eventually tried to talk to the Chief. I explained how the trash was everyone's not just mine. I explained the very least he could do is enforce the rule people throw trash into the appropriate bags. Another thing was all of the cleaning supplies were on my main landing. So people would just throw things down the stairs and then leave. Chief would then tell me to put them away. He made me get rid of all of the old supplies. I tried to tell him we all used them.  I was cranking and in cargo my chain of command consisted of two people. A second class and a chief. Who both took advantage of me. I was only an E2 so no one would listen to me. I'd try to bring up what was happening but people would just say, No one like cranking. And I'd try to explain that it was more than me not just liking cranking.. It was an issue of me being bullied and taken advantage of.  So a month and a half pass of me being up 4 hours past everyone else and doing all of these other odd jobs alone. The entire command has to take a pee test. This female who never worked waited until the last day to take hers. She ended up being up until noon waiting in line. Chief gave her the night off. I was up until noon every day while everyone else was off by 8. The one time she stays up and because of her own fault too... Chief gave her the night off...  I just started sweeping my main landing and leaving after that. Chief acted all confused. I don't know why you're just leaving when their is work to do. But every morning until I finished cranking I just left and went to sleep.  I mean there were 5 of us and 2 females didnt lift a finger so me and two other guys busted our asses all night then I had to stay up 4 hours more..  And when I tell the story people still say, No one like cranking. That's just how it is.. But I mean my cranking experience was a bit different than a lot of people.. There is so much of it I just don't want to talk about.. What I've said here is maybe 5% of it..    For about 6 months I ran a duty section of entirely females except for myself. It was Hell."

One of the tenets of recovery in regards to addcitions... the ""steps"" as it were, is in making amends. Seeking out and apologizing to those you have wronged. However, one of the caveats is ""unless it would do more harm then good"". This does have some merit. Some people write it off as an easy way to ""get out of"" having to make ammends, but it's really not. If you're in recovery and you're truly trying to turn your life around and goddamn, you  just reeeeally want to make ammends and are carrying around some fucked up shit, it would be easiest to actually get it off your chest. But if it will actually cause pain to the other person, then it's actually harder on you not to confess because you have accepted the responsibility of ""I fucked up royally and now, as much as I'd like to come clean and get this off my chest/conscience, I can't because it would do more harm to the other person."" So you're now forced to carry that burden. It's your own damn fault, but the cross is on your back.   In a case like this, with children involved, if it was a one time thing and the person feels incredibly guilty and will not do it again, I would agree and say ""yeah, don't say anything... you fucked up, you know it, but it would only cause possible irreparable harm to your family."" Honestly, there's no real good that could come from it. I understand the idea of ""they deserve to know"" but sometimes, no knowing is what's best for us.   Like it or not, it is good advice for a truly repentant person that is certain they're not going to do it again.   With that being said, I don't actually believe the story."

Or better yet, they should be required to work with the local police in these matters.

PussyPass,2oek21,CVTHIZZKID,16,Sat Dec 6 16:15:56 2014 UTC,How on earth is bounty hunting legal?  Shouldn't it at least require some kind of training and a license?
PussyPass,2oek21,lexsird,15,Fri Dec 5 23:56:12 2014 UTC,"Bounty hunting exists because if someone who posts bail with a bond tries to flee, the Bail Bonds company is responsible for paying. As such, the government has little incentive to track down these low level fugitives because they are already guaranteed the money.   In many states, it does require a license. But modern bounty hunting is more about tracking people like a detective (""skip tracing""), and not acting like a Boba Fett wannabe. And if you really think that a license and training will always stop people from acting like thugs, then you haven't been following the news lately.   Note that I don't work in that industry and don't really know much about it, but I realize that people in other countries would be even less familiar, so it's pretty much a US only thing."
PussyPass,2oek21,thelordofcheese,11,Sat Dec 6 01:38:49 2014 UTC,"When I was young I worked for a P.I. Agency and bounty hunting was something on the menu for us, but my agency didn't fuck with it. This was back in the 80s mind you, but from what I recall you wanted to work close with cops when you did it. You could go into places after a bounty without a warrant, but you would want the cops with you lest you bit into serious trouble.   It's about the bail bonds guy losing that bond money when they run. Let's say he's bailed them out at 10% of a 100 thousand dollar bond. He's put up that full 100k telling the court that they will show up for their court hearings and trials. When they bounce, the court keeps that and he's fucked.   This is where he wants them back into custody, they've bounced and hence a warrant is out for them. Well the reality of it is cops have plenty on their plate and the court has a nice fat chunk of money, hence no rush to run the fucker down. Your job is to ferret the fucker out and unless you are Barney McBadAss, you do the smart thing and just call some cops and they roll in with you for an easy bust.   Bounty Hunting is time consuming and you are obviously on commission. If you suck at finding people who don't want to be found, you are going to starve. My agency went for the easy money of insurance fraud investigations. The work was far easier, less dangerous mostly and we got paid by the hour gloriously when we delivered which was almost every case.   My qualifications were a streetwise wheel man, bouncer and ex military. The agency just had to get me bonded/insured and licensed under the State. There was no formal schooling. The agency trained me for the job.   The point is if an agency wants to hire whomever, they can. If they want to hired a bunch of women and try to work it like that, it's like anyone else, a matter of bonding/insurance and simply paying a license fee with the State and getting your ID.  Frankly I'm skeptical of their business model. In my opinion, you want to be low key so you can blend in unnoticed that way you can work undercover. Fame is not your friend for undercover work. You are trying to pass yourself off under the radar and glean information out of people who by their very nature are guarded about the very information you are after.   Ideally you are a ghost, not even enough to remember. Showing up in flaming Pink matching outfits chasing guys around with BB guns with your faces all over youtube and acting like it's ""girl's night out to kick guys in the balls for giggles"" is the complete polar opposite.   I'm thinking this makes for some ""Barbie Fun House"" feel good feminist empowerment good times, but if they fuck around with the wrong crowd its going to end really badly. It's dodgy shit, they could hit the tip of an iceberg and get an entire crew hell bent on burying them in a shallow grave. There are some seriously bad people out there and not all of them are dipshits that end up caught.   Or I could be wrong. Bad guys could have turned to cupcakes baked by sugar plumb fairies since my day in the field. If so, happy pickings girls."

This took place is California, which does not require bounty hunters to be licensed, but they are regulated to some extent by the Department of Insurance and are required to be certified. Maybe somebody could file a complaint with them, but if this guy has a lawyer, I'm sure he's already doing that."

PussyPass,2o93h1,Nulono,3,Fri Dec 5 19:02:46 2014 UTC,"Except that killing a foetus is still illegal under the offenses against the person act. That's why doctors need special circumstances to do it, just like an ordinary person might need self-defence as a reason to kill an adult.  Saying 'a foetus is not a person' isn't a legal statement but a personal opinion. Who else decided that a group of people were humans but non-persons..?  What this case shows is that ideological support of abortion is more important than proper interpretation of the law even when not directly related.  This absurd ruling can be summed up as 'proper application of the law might make people question abortion even though it has nothing to do with this ruling so I should instead invent a justification for misinterpreting it'."
PussyPass,2o93h1,Nulono,3,Fri Dec 5 19:09:09 2014 UTC,Wouldn't that bodily harm also apply to the child once born? It's not like FAS only affects fetuses.

It would be more harmful to all women if fetuses were granted personhood, because then the state would have undue control over pregnant women's bodies. Depriving women of their right to choose detriments society as a whole, because restricting liberty over one's body is unjust. It's also pragmatic to let women get abortions, because then there's fewer unwanted children.  It's not a fair outcome in this case, but the line has to be drawn somewhere, otherwise many more will suffer."

This mostly occurred at the bus stop and on the bus, and every time I tried to stand up for myself, the local boys would go all white knight on me, and even help them to stuff snow into my backpack or steal my shoes when they knocked me down and so on.   What did I do? Just put up with it. Can't retaliate against a girl and all that, so...  Now just imagine this guy. Pushed and pushed and pushed to the point to where he just snaps.

Criteria for civil commitment are established by laws, which vary between nations. Commitment proceedings often follow a period of emergency hospitalization, during which an individual with acute psychiatric symptoms is confined for a relatively short duration (e.g. 72 hours) in a treatment facility for evaluation and stabilization by mental health professionals—who may then determine whether further civil commitment is appropriate or necessary. If civil commitment proceedings follow, then the evaluation is presented in a formal court hearing where testimony and other evidence may also be submitted. [citation needed] The subject of the hearing is typically entitled to legal counsel and may challenge a commitment order through habeas corpus rules.   Historically, until the first third of the twentieth century or later in most jurisdictions, all committals to public psychiatric facilities and most committals to private ones were involuntary. Since then, there have been alternating trends towards the abolition or substantial reduction of involuntary commitment,  a trend known as ""deinstitutionalisation.""

I fail to see how you can defend bullys   Where did I defend the bullies, ""needless to say, these girls should be prosecuted for harassment"".   The cunts deserve jail.    Possibly, depends on the level of harassment.   The guy needs psychiatric help.   Definitely"

I believe this is the crux of our disagreement, I'm presenting an argument based on the evidence presented,    No, once again you're arguing your own view of the evidence based on what you want it to be. Two girls harassed and bullied a man to the point of mentally breaking and flying off the handle, and they claim its because all they did was call him ""Harry Potter."" Also really funny how his side of the story hasn't been heard either. If you don't know how to smell bullshit then I'm sure I've got some great late night infomercials with some amazing products you'll love.    you seem to be under the impression that theses two girls have been harassing the guy for years, If you have another source for this story with more information then please share.   You seem to be under the impression that these two cunts are innocent little girls.    Where did I defend the bullies,    In all your previous posts in where you make them out to be innocent little angels brutally attacked by a big mean man monster who simply flew off the handle in an unprovoked rage for ""no reason"".    Possibly, depends on the level of harassment.   Here goes the defending of bully's again. What sort of harassment should constitute jail time? Hmmm maybe the type that pushes someone to the point of a violent attack? Society doesn't need sociopaths like these two cunts on the streets.   What you simply fail to grasp is this: his side of the story hasn't been told. His evidence hasn't been seen. And every bully always plays the ""i didn't do nothin"" card the moment they're caught. If this was reversed, if this was a girl who flew off the handle because two guys called her ""Hermione Granger"" both of those guys would be in jail without questions asked, and the woman would be paraded around as a poster child for abuse."

That's just how I was raised, but I argue regularly with a female friend that the term feminism doesn't imply equality.  It implies the superiority of the feminine, in the same way that capitalism implies the superiority of a capitalist economic model, Islamism promotes the superiority if the Muslim religion, and every other ism implies superiority of the term that precedes it.  I'd say it should be changed to reflect actual gender equality, but since so many feminists want to cherry pick, it's actually pretty perfect."
PussyPass,2nz0lw,JustHereForTheBacon,4,Tue Dec 2 12:22:16 2014 UTC,"""Feminism"" is supposed to be the raising up of women to the same level as men. Alas, it is used in the real world to try to drag men down to the level at which women perceive themselves as being. So when they suggest/promote/condone an injustice to be committed against men/a man, they retort with shit like, ""How does it feel?!"" when they should be against it in any case."
PussyPass,2nz0lw,usernameintensifies,0,Tue Dec 2 23:59:59 2014 UTC,"I don't think those terms imply superiority. They just describe how things are being done. Capitalism is just the word for a specific type of economical model. The fact that Capitalism exists does not suggest that it's superior and is completely independent from whether or not the people participating believe it is.  I do agree that people who want equality should consider themselves egalitarians. However, feminism is a perfectly valid word to describe a person who primarily looks to solve issues which affect women, regardless of whether or not their belief is that people should be equal."

If you answer, please remember that I'm not anti-women and I want gender equality.  I just think the use of ""ism"" and ""ist"" can put people on the defensive out of reflex.

PussyPass,2nw5f0,thelordofcheese,0,Mon Dec 1 07:43:24 2014 UTC,"I have to disagree. The town I went to school in (USA) had a school shooting in which a teenaged boy shot and killed a teenage girl. He was sentenced to juvi until his 18th birthday, upon which the conviction would be sealed and he would basically have no criminal record. From my experience, juvi cases are handled relatively evenly with deference given to the fact that they are minors versus whether they are male or female.   What I do see is a big difference in the amount of charges leveled against juvenile boys verses girls. I tackled a guy once because he said something bad about my dad. Damn near got charged with assault. But I've seen women throwing blows and pulling hair over comments about how each other are dressed and the worst they get is detention, maybe suspension if they've gotten in fights before.   Time and time again I saw boys get charged with things while the girls played the victim or the unwitting accomplice, when most of the times they were egging on the boys who were trying to impress them. As far as the Juvi system goes it isn't the courts who have the problems, its the schools and the police."

PussyPass,2nw5f0,thelordofcheese,1 point,Mon Dec 1 08:49:33 2014 UTC,"Well, when I was growing up at least (SW US), the jails were already full of drug dealers and drunks and wanna be gangsters. The only juvi we had, I believe, was upstate and it had a limited number of cells to hold juvenile offenders from all over the state.   For a while we did have a boot camp run by the local PD. I, thankfully, never had to go through it. It was intense from what I saw. I'd be up at 7am and I'd see groups of kids returning from a run carrying a large log. They were disciplined through physical exercise and were required to march through school, without stopping, without socializing. If, during their training, they felt their tummy tumble, they had to throw up in their sweaters. I know it sounds like complete shit, but it happened. Every couple of months they were given one ""free day"" where they, under close supervision, would be allowed to go to the pool or the park or, later on, the movie theater.  And the shit of it was- it was really effective. I'm not gonna quote some anecdotal number to make myself sound smarter, but a lot of the kids that I knew who were in that program actually got their shit together and graduated high school. A few of them went to trade schools and now have a happy healthy family, which is a lot better than what would've happened to them without this.   Despite how obviously good it was for these kids (and mind you these weren't petty things they were put in their for either- theft, assault, drugs, alcohol possession, etc) some parent complained and the whole thing got shut down my junior year. And, just to relate this to the thread, it was not discriminate based on gender. Girls got the same training regime and punishment as the boys and were expected to keep up. So, at least on the juvenile side, in my hometown things were equal."

Every self-identified feminist I met has just been a pseudo-intellectual, a hater, and a perpetual victim.

PussyPass,2myp6r,HalfysReddit,0,Sun Nov 30 16:36:39 2014 UTC,"I've never met a tumblrite in real life. All the feminists I've met have been reasonable people. Some are my professors. I'm including men and women.   Maybe it's geographic. It makes sense that the label might be applied differently in different parts of the world.  ...actually thinking about it I might have met one tumblrite... he was a dude. Didn't strike me as a pseudo-intellectual, hater, or someone who'd call themselves a victim though. Pretty chill dude. Never brought up his opinions except one time either.  Idk. Maybe I've just been lucky."
PussyPass,2myp6r,blndcavefsh,0,Sun Nov 30 17:13:52 2014 UTC,"I definitely imagine it's partially geographical. I live in Southern Maryland where everywhere that isn't a rich neighborhood is either ghetto or white trash trailer park land. Well I don't consider it the ghetto but apparently other people do, IMO it's not ghetto until drive-by shootings are a problem.  So given that everyone around here is busy hustling and trying to get out of the area, intellectualism isn't a top priority. I've met some very humbling people in these sorts of environments but you also encounter a lot of ignorance.  That being said, that means around here one would have to really put a priority on feminism to label themselves a feminist. So basically all I've seen is extremists.  Really though, your comment tells me one thing - you're a student. Disregarding your college experience, think of the people who discussed feminism with you outside of that environment, that's the sort of people that breed the feminist stereotype."
PussyPass,2myp6r,HalfysReddit,0,Sun Nov 30 17:23:11 2014 UTC,I honesty have never met a single person who fits that stereotype.
PussyPass,2myp6r,blndcavefsh,0,Sun Nov 30 17:30:30 2014 UTC,But you recognize that there is a difference between people who self-identify as feminists in a college environment and those who self-identify as feminists outside of it right?
PussyPass,2myp6r,nsummy,0,Sun Nov 30 17:54:52 2014 UTC,"Sure. I'm not saying the crazy feminists don't exist. Just that crazy feminism is not ""the absolute definition of feminsism."" It's not. A lot of people who are at university, who have been to university, or who have actually read about the ideas taught at university are feminists, and thus fat-gendered otherkin victimised anti-man justice warriors are not representative of feminism as a whole.   And really, the educated feminists aren't either. There are so many different divisions among feminists that any attempt to criticise feminism as a whole will almost always fall short. Even the extremists don't agree on everything."
PussyPass,2myp6r,Wolfeh2012,-6,Sun Nov 30 18:25:05 2014 UTC,"I think she deserved a lot more time, hell probably kidnapping.

Sounds like a lot of mental torture & maybe small wounds, not to mention this dude is crammed in a trailer with 8 people, and smoking weed with heroin, do we take his story at face value?  ""...and the state’s inability to find Dail at the time of sentencing."""
PussyPass,2myp6r,HalfysReddit,3,Fri Nov 21 19:28:07 2014 UTC,"While I agree it's possible he exaggerated on his part, and that his not showing up during sentencing may have led to a lighter sentence... Lets keep in mind a few things.   He's a victim, there's no question about it she was convicted of the exact crime detailed in the article. He's homeless, his not showing up very likely has to do with the fact that he doesn't have a place to live. ""do we have to take his story at face value?"" No, we don't. Because she was already convicted, and therefore found guilty of the crime described in the article.  She cut his dick. It doesn't exactly matter if it was small wounds, she attacked him and terrorized him. Considering men go to jail for hitting their wives, it's surprising she can cut someone multiple times and threaten to kill them without any jail time at all."

PussyPass,2myp6r,Abadoobie,52,Fri Nov 21 09:17:38 2014 UTC,Feminism.
PussyPass,2myp6r,ShitLordXurious,-28,Fri Nov 21 16:05:54 2014 UTC,Not true. Feminism may support and encourage it(or simply ignore or deny it) but treating females better than males when it come to crime and punishment is a long standing reality.
PussyPass,2myp6r,Abadoobie,24,Fri Nov 21 18:59:45 2014 UTC,"Sure, but feminists are the first to oppose any kind of equal treatment of females in the criminal justice system."
PussyPass,2myp6r,ShitLordXurious,-32,Fri Nov 21 19:03:51 2014 UTC,Not true. They support solutions to all kinds of situations in which women are currently treated unfairly.
PussyPass,2myp6r,Abadoobie,23,Fri Nov 21 19:08:11 2014 UTC,"Women are treated favourably in the criminal justice system. Vastly so - they receive 63% shorter sentences for the same crimes as men, and feminists have campaigned to make those sentences even shorter, and even to close women's prisons completely!"
PussyPass,2myp6r,denart4,-33,Fri Nov 21 19:15:12 2014 UTC,"That's because doing so supports solutions to more serious issues that affect women. Get your priorities straight man. Rape culture and violence against women, economic gender inequality, poverty, inadequate contraception availability, abortion rights, the glass ceiling, sexual objectification of women in the media, these are all serious issues that need legislative and legal support to tackle. What you call favor is actually just sorely needed and academically verified solutions to these pressing issues."

So depending on the areas laws on both not paying a fare and citizens arrest laws he could get in some serious trouble. She's a piece of shit hands down. The white knights are shit as well.

PussyPass,2mwyjb,Edgeinsthelead,3,Fri Nov 21 06:28:41 2014 UTC,It's still an arrestable offense. The cite & release part is if you agree to show up to court or pay the fee.
PussyPass,2mwyjb,jfiowemodsa,26,Sun Dec 7 19:14:32 2014 UTC,No. Citizen's arrest is applicable here because she just stole from him. In what mind would it be right for her to walk away?

PussyPass,2mm9p7,coletricklegoinglow,24,Tue Nov 18 04:20:32 2014 UTC,"Lawyer here.  No, that's not assault.  What separates assault from battery is whether there is contact (or ""touching"").  If I swing and miss, that's assault.  If I swing and connect, that's battery (although technically, that's both assault and battery since there was both reasonable threat of harm and harmful contact).  Thus, saying those words like ""I'm gonna fuck you up"" are neither assault nor battery.  They may constitute other crimes depending on circumstances (e.g., terrorist threats), but they're neither assault nor battery.  Some jurisdictions, however, have done away with the distinction between assault and battery since most incidents of assault will result in battery.  Those states generally classify all such incidents as ""assault""."

PussyPass,2mm9p7,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,-3,Tue Nov 18 13:54:00 2014 UTC,"In the way that it contradicts Wikipedia and every other lawyer I've spoken to and article I've read on the subject. I guess they could all be wrong and you could be right, or I could be misunderstanding, but you understand I have to go with the most logical answer here.    An assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm   From wiki"
PussyPass,2mm9p7,coletricklegoinglow,5,Tue Nov 18 14:18:07 2014 UTC,"We were talking about your example:  ""Saying 'I'm gonna fuck you up' is assault"".  Words like that generally do not constitute assault.  Your statement makes it sound like any time someone utters those words would constitute assault, which it clearly does not.  Indeed, the video in question is a perfect example.  That woman makes all sorts of threats, and he laughs it off because it's just words.  There may be instances where the totality of circumstances would justify those words as rising to the level of assault.  But the example that you gave, and the example provided in the video above clearly do not."
PussyPass,2mm9p7,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,-4,Tue Nov 18 14:27:07 2014 UTC,How is it not assault?
PussyPass,2mm9p7,coletricklegoinglow,7,Tue Nov 18 15:02:07 2014 UTC,"They're just words.  People make idle threats every day.  They might rise to the level of another crime such as criminal threat, but without any more facts, there clearly is a lack of immediacy and reasonable fear of harm that would warrant an assault charge."
PussyPass,2mm9p7,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,-8,Tue Nov 18 16:31:55 2014 UTC,This was clearly not an idle threat. I really dont think you have any idea what you're talking about.
PussyPass,2mm9p7,coletricklegoinglow,6,Tue Nov 18 16:44:13 2014 UTC,It's stupid; it may constitute terrorist threat under certain facts; it may cause the cop to give you a beating; but it is not assault.    Ask the DA whether the guy will be charged with assault.  It's silly.
PussyPass,2mm9p7,Gibtohom,6,Tue Nov 18 14:37:09 2014 UTC,"Did you read his comment?   What separates assault from battery is whether there is contact (or ""touching"").   Clearly says exactly what you said."
PussyPass,2mm9p7,Gibtohom,3,Tue Nov 18 14:39:11 2014 UTC,"I've misread your comment.   Because lawyer there is wrong in that there doesn't need to be physical contact for there to be assault, only that the victim is in fear of injury.    I thought this was you agreeing with him in that statement. I read it as Lawyer guy is wrong, in that there doesn't need to be contact for assault.  My bad."
PussyPass,2mm9p7,coletricklegoinglow,1 point,Tue Nov 18 15:02:44 2014 UTC,"I'm saying that in most circumstances, aggressive threatening language is assault.   Soooo utterly wrong. Assault statutes generally don't consider such words to constitute assault.  The scenario you previously portrayed (fellow holding an axe) is one instance where the totality of the circumstances might give rise to an assault claim, but the words without much more clearly do not constitute assault."
PussyPass,2mm9p7,chore_bore,1 point,Tue Nov 18 12:11:06 2014 UTC,This is right
PussyPass,2mm9p7,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,1 point,Tue Nov 18 14:02:11 2014 UTC,Yeah I'm thinking lawyer there is not actually a lawyer
PussyPass,2mm9p7,coletricklegoinglow,0,Tue Nov 18 14:09:50 2014 UTC,Card carrying member of my State.  And you've clearly misunderstood.
PussyPass,2mm9p7,coletricklegoinglow,1 point,Tue Nov 18 14:34:54 2014 UTC,"""I'm going to fuck you up!"" is assault.   Like I said, the words in and of themselves do not constitute assault.  They must be coupled with other facts to make the words rise to the level of assault.  Your belief that the words themselves constitute assault is woefully incorrect."
PussyPass,2mm9p7,Gumstead,-5,Tue Nov 18 14:33:19 2014 UTC,"You're not a lawyer. Any lawyer would've prefaced his comment by specifying jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, there isn't even a battery statute, there is assault and agg. assault, with agg. assault functioning as battery does in other states.   Typically, what makes something assault is if there is a legitimate fear of harm. Her simply saying she will fuck him up isn't assault. But, if she raises a fist or reaches into her purse while making this threat or is holding some sort of weapon, then what was merely a threat is now assault. In states which have separate statutes for assault and battery, aggravating factors might be the type of weapon (knife/gun vs mace), the physical difference between the victim and suspect, their relationship/status difference, etc.   Anyways, I know you aren't a lawyer because you said you were a lawyer. A real lawyer would've said what state and what type because otherwise, your statement means nothing."
PussyPass,2mm9p7,coletricklegoinglow,2,Tue Nov 18 23:42:54 2014 UTC,"I'm hurt that you don't think I'm a lawyer.  How will I recover?  Saving that soul crushing attack, I should say that I specified previously that different jurisdictions handle assault and battery differently, and that some jurisdictions have done away with battery altogether.  But don't let your reading comprehension skills, or lack thereof, get in the way.  Like I said, go ahead and post it on /r/legaladvice if you're so certain.  Please!"
PussyPass,2mm9p7,Gumstead,-2,Tue Nov 18 13:19:25 2014 UTC,I don't need to. Not a lawyer but lets just say I am involved in a different profession that makes extensive use of criminal law. I know I'm right on the matter.

PussyPass,2mm9p7,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,-7,Tue Nov 18 17:56:07 2014 UTC,A threat is assault

PussyPass,2mm9p7,MightyTaint,-8,Tue Nov 18 23:56:50 2014 UTC,"That wouldn't be ""normal circumstances"" now would it?"
PussyPass,2mm9p7,Beiber_h0le69,2,Tue Nov 18 04:11:45 2014 UTC,"Normal circumstances don't matter. What does matter in a case like this is to determine what is something that could be reasonably foreseeable. Could somebody have an allergic or negative reaction to mace, absolutely!"
PussyPass,2mm9p7,MightyTaint,-1,Tue Nov 18 04:36:25 2014 UTC,"By that rationale, you could be charged with aggrivated assault by serving someone a shrimp cocktail.  Just because someone might have a severely averse reaction, doesn't mean aggravated assault occurs."
PussyPass,2mm9p7,mastersoup,2,Tue Nov 18 06:53:06 2014 UTC,"Actually no. It's about intent. If it were somehow provable that you intended to force feed someone shrimp in the hopes to do harm to them, then yeah."
PussyPass,2mm9p7,MightyTaint,-2,Tue Nov 18 06:54:24 2014 UTC,"It's actually not about intent at all, it's whether the victim reasonably felt threatened.  Thanks for playing though!"
PussyPass,2mm9p7,mastersoup,2,Tue Nov 18 04:51:32 2014 UTC,"I actually wasn't referring to the crime, I was clarifying your example, which was absolutely shit. If you wanna keep using false analogies, feel free, but you're just proving you're wrong and have no idea what you're talking about. Since you wanted to make it specifically about the crime in question in this thread(which is battery), you're still wrong.   Specific rules regarding battery vary among different jurisdictions, but some elements remain constant across jurisdictions. Battery generally requires that: an offensive touch or contact is made upon the victim, instigated by the actor; and the actor intends or knows that their action will cause the offensive touching.   If you mean specifically assault with a deadly weapon, then intent or feeling threatened are both irrelevant."
PussyPass,2mm9p7,Beiber_h0le69,4,Tue Nov 18 04:56:33 2014 UTC,"Its irrelevant, even if they say they didn't intend to cause the harm that ultimately occured, they still caused an unlawful contact. You are substantially certain to cause harm by spraying somebody, not so much with shrimp."
PussyPass,2mm9p7,MightyTaint,-3,Tue Nov 18 05:39:49 2014 UTC,"So the distinction becomes whether it is assault or aggravated assault (which you obviously don't know the difference).  Beyond that, you don't even know that you don't even have to have contact for assault to occur.  So thanks for your ignorance, I guess."

If we saw video of the investigators speaking to the men accused in a tone that implied that they did it, no one would be standing up for the men and saying that it was police intimidation. The only reason they are saying the police were wrong is because the investigator didn't tell them what they wanted to hear. In these idiots eyes it doesn't matter that the detective was 1: a woman herself 2: a trained professional in these types of cases and 3: had evidence to support her investigation. To them they only heard ""We don't think your story is true."" so therefore the police MUST be wrong. I mean, no women ever lie and every man must not be telling the truth."

The abuse by her father resulted in the birth of seven children and one miscarriage; four of the children joined their mother in captivity, and three were raised by Josef and Rosemarie Fritzl and reported as foundlings.

Instead, they write it off to ""Sudden Infant Death Syndrome"" and move on to the next case.  It really is a HUGE pussy pass. This case got a lot of attention, but it goes on ALL the time. :("

Again, it's not something that is really talked about, though any lawyer or judge working near such cases know the full extent of the problem.  I agree with you that women being treated so VASTLY differently than men is a huge problem too. To the point of it being pretty blatant sexism."

They found out she had been killing all her kids with a pillow, only reason they caught on was because she didn't understand you can't inherit genetics through adoption."
PussyPass,2mjljo,SuperNinjaBot,2,Mon Nov 17 15:19:26 2014 UTC,"There ya go.    I wonder if there even really IS such a thing. As said before, most of the cases I've heard of, the mother had to make the brutally practical decision because there wasn't enough money to take care of both her and the child (or at least she thought so).  Eight in a row sounds like your run of the mill nut job though. Sheesh, and if they let her adopt a kid, she was not bad off financially. That's not the case in general. It's mostly the very poor that lack resources.  It does make the point clear though. If SIDS can be so easily assumed even after 7!! infants... yah. It's more a matter of looking the other way than anything.  edit: Actually, in America anyway, there is SOOO much help for single mothers, this never really needs to happen. It IS a very natural instinct though. It's always been like this, and I guess the government figures it's better to just turn a blind eye. Nothing they can do will stop it, and it will only mean less money to line their pockets with.  Still, it is very lop-sided in massive favor of women.  Strange things going on there."

First, she's at a Gay Pride event, probably not the best venue to display white female privilege by being openly and rudely vocal to an activist who's just silently standing holding signs in both hands.   After she initiates hostilities, she then invades his personal space with more rude and obnoxious statements while making ""in your face"" hand gestures, all the while the man is helplessly holding signs.   She then commits simple assault by grabbing the camera of the person videoing her hostilities.   This is NOT a case of merely voicing her opinion of disgust, but multiple and repeated actions of aggression, exploiting her pussy pass as we say here. Couple that with her crowd baiting and instigating attempts via falsely crying she was the victim and you have a prime example of a female knowingly exploiting her privilege and position.   Had this been another venue, I'm sure she would have lured several ""white knights"" into play on her behalf."

If they were going to do it regardless if they were a cop or not, then the charge will stick and likely get a conviction. Now if the cop coerces you into getting drugs for them when you normally wouldn't mess with said drug, then that is entrapment... Also if they hold a gun to your head and force you to do it, then that is also entrapment."
PussyPass,2m792w,BadThingsAreBrewing,4,Fri Nov 14 16:35:52 2014 UTC,"If the man had told the police, ""No, I don't want to have sex with a little girl.  Leave me alone"", they continued to pursue him, he continued to say, ""No."", and then eventually he agreed to do it, then we're getting closer to entrapment.  Entrapment is when the police encourage someone to commit a crime who is not ""predisposed"" to commit it.  (You'll notice in the article, they specify that the officer did not initiate talking about performing sexual acts.)  Asking for panties on craigslist, then holding a month-long sexually-explicit conversation with someone he thought was 13 is pretty damn far from entrapment."

Entrapment is when someone gets someone to do something they wouldn't normally do. Say you have Jim, Jim law abiding citizen and wouldn't normally break the law. As he is going into a store a underage girl asks him to buy her liquor he says no at first but she offers him a lot of money to persuade him to buy it for her, he goes through with it and it turns out to be an undercover cop. That is entrapment, the cop has created a criminal out of someone who was not one by manipulation.  Now if the Cops could prove without a doubt Jim would have committed this crime without them acting in the way they did then they can charge him but if they can't then he walks."

On average the poor are treated more harshly than the rich by the law, black people are treated more harshly than white people and men are treated more harshly than women. This sub is about the last one.  Interestingly most studies show that the male female justice imbalance is the most lopsided one.   It finds large gender gaps favoring women throughout the sentence length distribution (averaging over 60%), conditional on arrest offense, criminal history, and other pre-charge observables. Female arrestees are also significantly likelier to avoid charges and convictions entirely, and twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.   This is less than the imbalance found for race, where black people are only about 20 % more likely to be incarcerated than white people."

PussyPass,2m2xmt,HadToBeToldTwice,76,Thu Nov 13 08:16:05 2014 UTC,"People are not entitled to a single fucking cent of their spouse's income or property, especially when they are the one to initiate the split, and especially if they intended to harm their spouse.  Only in exceptional circumstances should someone receive alimony. Usually those circumstances involve some sort of criminal form of repression on the spouse that prevented them from being fully independent. Which, by itself, is abuse, and a crime - and the court should follow through with that, and into 'suing for damages'. Otherwise, if no criminal evidence is shown, alimony or 'reparation' should not exist.  Everyone is free to do whatever the fuck they please in this world. Are you married, and you feel the marriage is holding back your ability to financially succeed on your own? Then fucking leave, go on your merry way you entrepreneur you, may you lead a life of peace & prosperity from the benefits of your hard work and determination.  Alimony, regardless of the recipient's gender is nothing short of wage slavery and as it's enforced by a federal authority that makes it the wholesale definition of ""Involuntary Servitude"" as far as I'm concerned, whereby a person is coerced into financially supporting another entity, and diminishes their own financial support and well-being by doing so. Involuntary servitude is explicitly forbidden in the United States Constitution, amendment Thirteen.  The person receiving alimony is free to do whatever they want, they are under no obligation to remain in their current condition, if they feel it is a detriment to their success in doing so. The person paying alimony is under obligation because they are coerced in doing so by an entity that will literally ruin them financially (even further) or put them in a dungeon if they protest.  It is outdated, and obscene."
PussyPass,2m2xmt,bat_mayn,16,Wed Nov 12 18:03:49 2014 UTC,"Sure, I'm going to get killed for this but you're missing a pretty big key from the alimony, which is that in some cases it's two people working on one person's career. I'm sure you're thinking specifically of cases where the woman's the gold digger, leaching off a man's career and using him to support her life style. I guess that happens sometimes, and if that's the case, sure I agree with you.   *note: I completely agree that the woman in the article shouldn't have gotten a fucking dime. Except maybe ten years in prison.   I just busted my ass putting my wife through medical school and residency. I've paid for pretty much everything, and we've got considerable debt as a result of her medical training. She's about to graduate and start making three times as much as I am.   If she divorced me, I'd likely get Alimony as payment for my contributions to the household.   More importantly, Alimony is a way to prevent total control of a spouse by an income producing partner.   Generally a stay at home mom or dad has to sacrifice his or her career so that the spouse can get a high paying job. They can't leave without a severe cut in their standard of living - going from a nice house and car, stable food, not really worrying about bills, to... living paycheck to paycheck? Renting a shit hole apartment? I gladly sacrificed my job prospects for my wife. I prefer my wife to them. But if that falls apart?    Bullshit. I'm very fortunate that I've got a good job that lets me work remotely (Software Developer) but I've had to move 2 times in the last three years for her career, which would have severely limited my own career options. It also prevented me from getting my Masters degree.   Even more importantly is if my wife or husband fundamentally changes the nature of our relationship (head over to /r/deadbedrooms for a fun afternoon) the actions of the spouse through neglect or abuse can force a person to leave a marriage.   Without alimony, someone who's sacrificed a career taking care of their spouse can't leave."
PussyPass,2m2xmt,sawser,3,Thu Nov 13 13:19:55 2014 UTC,"I just busted my ass putting my wife through medical school and residency.   That's your choice.  In todays society, nobody is forced to do anything.  Nobody is expected or forced to be a stay-at-home parent.  It's a personal choice.     If you're expecting the law to make sure you get a portion of her earnings in the future in return for your help, then you should really re-look at why you're doing it.  Alimony is bullshit."
PussyPass,2m2xmt,Buzz_Killington_III,8,Thu Nov 13 17:02:15 2014 UTC,"Right. I'm making the choice to contribute to the marriage, because I love my wife and she's worth it to me. If I didn't, and left, then I wouldn't have her and I wouldn't have the prospects to raise children.   The POINT of marriage isn't to get alimony, it's to have a stable life with a person. Often times, it's best if one person works and the other person doesn't. It's about optimizing roles in the house hold. If she didn't want the constant support that a spouse provides and risk having alimony, she didn't have to get married either.   But if she wants the support, love, and care of a spouse who doesn't work, she runs the risk of having to contribute to my finances in the event that our relationship ends prematurely.   Alimony is risk mitigation in the event of a failed household. Without it, the working partner leaves the household with all of the financial benefits of the partnership (a stable household, emotional and physical support, etc) and the non working partner is left with literally nothing.   Without alimony the longer a relationship goes, the less incentive the working partner has for working on or continuing a relationship and the more and more risk the non working partner is assuming.   15 years into a marriage, a non working partner would enter the job force without any marketable skills, no job experience, and with a huge employment gap, because all of their skills and experience went into maintaining the household.   You're operating under the assumption that a non working spouse doesn't contribute in any way to the marriage. I'm sure that happens and I agree in that situation (gold diggers) shouldn't get anything.   Alimony is important."
PussyPass,2m2xmt,sawser,1 point,Thu Nov 13 17:39:10 2014 UTC,"You're operating under the assumption that a non working spouse doesn't contribute in any way to the marriage.    No, I'm arguing that everyone, married or not, should be self-sufficient whether married or not.  Those who choose not to be, fine, but nobody else should be forced into paying for them to live at any specific level of comfort.    I understand every point you're making, I just disagree that any of it is justification for taking money from 1 person to give to another for months or years on end after they've chosen to not be together is absolute bull.  If someone turns 18, has a kid, and decides to be solely a stay-at-home mom for a decade and then separates, under no circumstances should the other party be responsible for your standard of living after that.  It wasn't a 'joint decision' to be a stay at home spouse.  You may have talked about it, but it's ultimately the decision of the individual.    It's a risk on both sides:  The stay-at-home spouse is risking a failed marriage ending in having to find a job with no skills and not making much money.   The working spouse is risking working for 10 years, paying for everything that both of you do during that time period, and it not working out resulting in already having spend 10-years worth of money on someone else.  One party shouldn't have those risk mitigated at the cost of the other party."

Those who choose not to be, fine, but nobody else should be forced into paying for them to live at any specific level of comfort.   They aren't forced to, unless they willingly get married. If you don't want to risk paying alimony, don't be the breadwinner in a marriage.    If someone turns 18, has a kid, and decides to be solely a stay-at-home mom for a decade and then separates, under no circumstances should the other party be responsible for your standard of living after that.   There's plenty of single parents in exactly that circumstances. The difference is that two people entered a joint household (voluntarily).  One focused on increasing income, the other focused on household stuff.    It wasn't a 'joint decision' to be a stay at home spouse. You may have talked about it, but it's ultimately the decision of the individual.   There are plenty of dual income marriages (mine is one right now). And I'm not sure if you are or have ever been married, but every single decisions isn't a ""Fuck you, I get my way or I'm leaving this marriage"" decision. Or if you feel that way, I can see why you're so bitter about the topic.    The working spouse is risking working for 10 years, paying for everything that both of you do during that time period, and it not working out resulting in already having spend 10-years worth of money on someone else.    No, this isn't a working spouse taking a risk. Because the day before a divorce and the day after, they are still exactly as financially secure. Both parties have lost the love/caring/support aspect of the marriage. Even more importantly, the working spouse is more stable financially then ten years previously because they are further along in their careers.   The non working spouse has no career, no money, no job skills, they likely aren't as attractive and/or have already had a number of children, so there's less chance of being the 'non working spouse' again.   It's like tipping at a restaurant. Plenty of people don't feel that tipping at a restaurant is fair. You get the food, you pay for it. It's the job of the server to serve, and they should get paid for it by the employer.   And if that's how you feel, great! Don't got to a restaurant with wait staff.   Likewise, if you don't like the risk of having to support a person who's made financial sacrifices for you, GREAT! Either don't get married, or encourage your spouse to start his/her own career (and hope that it doesn't take you to different cities or states, thus ending the marriage prematurely)  Either way, then you won't have an income disparity and thus no one will have to pay alimony."

PussyPass,2m2xmt,koera,1 point,Thu Nov 13 20:08:36 2014 UTC,"""No financial support"" is not really an enforceable contract in many cases.   If both parties have significant or at least similar assets, it's not unfair and is therefore enforceable.   However, in a situation where one party has all the assets or at least significantly more, it would be seen by most courts as a contract signed under (financial) duress: the party without assets is basically giving something up (option of assets after divorce) without getting something in return (since they would have enjoyed the other party's assets in the marriage with or without the prenuptial agreement).   That's why a ""good"" prenup will only exclude certain assets like ones held prior to marriage (but any appreciation in the value of those assets during the marriage will be fair game) or things like trusts held for children that already ""don't belong to either partner"". It may also protect things like businesses from liquidation, but will not protect the income from said businesses.  Also, custody of any children of the marriage can't be assigned in a prenup as that is only decided after divorce using the circumstances of the divorce, situation of the parents at that time, and circumstances of the marriage up to that point as decision criteria. The interests of the child are paramount, and cannot be treated as ""assets"" of the marriage to be assigned by contract.  Disclaimer: IANAL, but I learned all this from an excellent family lawyer while setting up a prenup with my wife before our marriage, as she had some preexisting assets that we both agreed shouldn't be subject to division during a potential divorce. Talk to your own lawyer for exact details, as some laws governing divorce vary by state and situation. And, of course, I am a random internet person and should obviously not be trusted for legal advice."

So if I don't work for 10 years in order to support my spouse even assuming I have skills that are still relevant and employers won't care about the 10 year employment gap (Pro tip, no one will hire someone who's been out of the workforce for ten years)  There's no way to make up those lost wages. So depending on the situation (Stayed at home to raise the kids, etc) the spouse without a job has suffered irreparable damage to his/her income earning potential to the benefit of the working spouse.  (If the non working spouse didn't do anything, the working spouse would be forced to either do the extra work his/her self, or hire maids, cleaners, cooks, baby sitters, day care, etc etc etc)  Your statement is like saying that an investor who's put money into a business isn't owed anything when the business sells.   A non working spouse likely puts tons of work equity into a household, and often (but not always) deserves recompense for that time.   If a man, or woman, spends 10 years not earning her own income to assist her spouse, he or she's legally entitled to some of those earnings s/he makes as a result."

PussyPass,2m2xmt,NovaeDeArx,1 point,Fri Nov 14 15:02:27 2014 UTC,Prenups are commonly thrown out. She should be charged for attempted murder. Period.
PussyPass,2m2xmt,zyk0s,1 point,Fri Nov 14 17:21:34 2014 UTC,"That's because many prenups are badly written and are inequitable. A prenup written by a good lawyer that properly addresses the assets of marriage is much more likely to be upheld, although things like infidelity or attempted murder (if not addressed in the prenup) can override it, depending on the party committing the action and their assets."
PussyPass,2m2xmt,madfer,11,Sat Nov 29 18:36:36 2014 UTC,"It sounds like a good legal principle, but think of this hypothetical case:  A man poisons his wife to get a large life insurance payment. He fucks up, get caught, and the wife is rushed to the hospital. They save her, and upon release, she gets hit by a bus and dies. Do you think the life insurance company would pay him?  It may be far fetched, but I'm pretty sure they would get out of paying by saying that the husband's fraudulent and criminal attempt at getting the money disqualified him from receiving any in the future, even though the wife's death is not immediately related to him poisoning her.  Ask yourself too if your opinion would be much different if the man had asked for divorce after she tried to poison him. If you allow something like that, you would effectively encourage women to poison their husbands, since it's a sure way to get them to divorce you and you still get the money. If that shouldn't be permitted, I don't see why this should."

It's against the law to profit off of murder, so if someone dies unnaturally, the multi billion dollar insurance company WILL investigate before they pay the money.   If a spouse murders for the money, and are caught (which happens 99.99% of the time) , then the company doesn't have to pay.  However if the spouse dies in an accident as in the example, then the company may have to even pay double, if there was an accident clause."

And guess what, society is made up of men AND women. We are all in this togeather.  And yeah, sometimes women abuse the system for their own personal gain. And sometimes men are such white nights that they try to defend those women that abuse the system. But the problem is not the people, the problem is the system that created them.

""Wait till some rehabilitated murderer rapes your wife and kills your kids"" is more than a bit ad hominem - if we accept that they're a murderer, then raping my wife would be a bit out-of-character for them, and simply saying ""they're all beyond help"" is why the US has such an overcrowded prison system.  You seem to think that I'm 'rehabilitating' with some magic pixie dust and wishes, before throwing them back onto the neighborhood. That's not what I'm suggesting at all. The justice system needs to focus around serious, psychiatric aid, in protected places, as well as training programs so they're able to reintegrate with society - the kid who's been in and out of prison for 10 years probably lacks the skills to hold down a decent job, and incarceration is the perfect time to remedy that.  tl;dr The justice system should be attempting to reduce rates of reoffending above punishing the guilty."

Besides, you're using the most extreme examples to discredit the whole thing. The classic ""is it wrong to steal a loaf of bread to feed your family"" applies to a lot of cases - when you punish everyone, there's little call for circumstance to be brought into it, and prison makes it more difficult to get a job, which makes it more difficult to survive without stealing, and so on, and so forth. Training while in carceration, and social welfare regardless of past convictions makes it easier for people to reintegrate with society.  Oh, and of course the prison system typically punishes the poor more than white-collar crime, because not having a job matters less if you have shares and savings collecting interest, and it's easier to get a job after prison if you know a few business owners."

They just uphold the law, and some are a little overzealous.  A feminist is a voluntary self-identification for which they must intrinsically believe women have fewer rights than men. I have never seen a feminist argue or fight for a man's rights, and there are stacks of evidence that they are actively fighting against men's rights. MRAs were declared a hate group because of this psycho cult.  The truly radical feminists are the ones who actually do think men should have rights; not the other way around."

While Gest and Minnelli were married, VH1 planned to air a reality show set in their reality, but the show was scuttled before its debut. According to VH1's lawsuit, Gest's behavior went ""far beyond the acceptable bounds of show business eccentricity"" -- he demanded that VH1 pay for his wardrobe, would not allow crew members to sit on the furniture, and repeatedly disrupted filming when he felt he did not look his best. During their divorce, Gest accused Minnelli of repeatedly beating him while they were married, while she claimed he had stolen $2 million.    http://www.nndb.com/people/724/000024652/"

Mentioning the fact that she has it in order to explain her occasional inability to moderate does not mean she is using her GENDER as a pass. It is a standard-fare excuse, and a totally acceptable one at that.   Secondly, though she said ""In a Perfect World, we'd all be gender-blind,"" it does not preclude the fact that we live an IMPERFECT world. Nor does it preclude the fact that we all HAVE a gender.  It is OKAY to mention you have a penis or a vagina (or in the case of Lady Gaga and some individuals, a combination of both). What is NOT OKAY is mentioning one's gender to use as a crutch. IMO the Mod was not using her gender as a crutch in her post; she merely pointed out the fact that she does, in fact, have a gender, however she will NOT let said gender cloud her arguments- a common-sense realization of gender-blindness. If you cynical POSes really want to be precise (and I know you do), you COULD say that she is using cancer as a crutch, which does not implicate gender, regardless of how you feel about breasteses.  TL;DR the OP is using cancer as a crutch, not her vag."

I feel like in a perfect world, we'd all be gender-blind humanists operating in a meritocracy, but that's not where we are, nor where we seem to be heading.  I don't have ""internalized misogyny"" or whateverthefuck--telling/showing women that their actions don't carry the weight of a man's is treating her like a child, in my opinion.   Since you seem to think this is personal, here are a few personal reasons a female would object to pussypass behaviour.   It's demeaning, being treated like you're not to blame for your own actions. She's a humanist, living in a society that doesn't recognise certain biases.  She believes in a meritocracy, which is incompatible with a pussypass world. She believes in rational discourse, a concept often undermined by those attempting a pussypass. Not all girls get pussypasses. That's just as unfair. Any human rights violation left unchecked is an invitation to test the next limit, which is dangerous for any human with rights.   So if you can't grasp the concept that the world isn't always about how much you can take from it and get away with, then maybe one of those rings true for you."

I was encouraged to question  authority and call out bullying, and you'd think after having an emotionally abusive father, that I'd be in the other camp entirely.   But I have brothers, friends, a husband, and tons of other men I don't even know--half the populaton--being shown that everything about them is worth less than a woman's feelings. Women receive automatic empathy from first world society--men receive automatic apathy, or worse. Plus, I'm a gamer. That's a whole other argument.  Besides, I've known enough women who think trapping a man into marriage with a pregnancy (or even a pregnancy scare) is A-OK. I used to bartend, and would hear women talking in clutches all the time about using false rape claims as a weapon. It's fucking disgusting behavior that happens more often than people are willing to admit, and it makes the rest of us look bad.   TL;DR Because ethics and empathy."
PussyPass,2ls37p,Safety_Dancer,8,Sun Nov 9 21:00:12 2014 UTC,"From my experience, most female bartenders not working in a meat market get to the same conclusion you have. Women in general are pretty cool, but you get the scheming, nasty ones that want their way, and alcohol really brings them out into the light. I worked in a strip club for a long time and I got to see the bad side of men in a similar fashion. Neither gender is more right than the other, and I get no perverse thrill for seeing women getting put in their place unless they deserve it, and I feel the same for men. The issue I see for a lot of men here is that they feel that they've been denied something and they love to see a woman hurt in some way. That shouldn't be the point for being here. It should be a gender specific /r/JusticePorn. Not a ""look at how bad she feels"" or ""That bitch got HIT! lolol"". I think that this is what too many men are here for, to get a thrill from a womans misfortune. Most posts here are great. But once in a while I get a rapey vibe from some of the comments, that it more than seeing someones attitude adjusted. That needs to stop.

You know, when a woman decides to start testing your testicles loudly and publicly, to the point where she starts putting her hands on you?   If you react physically, all the other men in the area will instinctively advance on you and start trying to kick your ass. (just labeling them white knights isn't fair; if I turned around and saw some man beating on a woman, not knowing what went down, I'd at least try to stop it if not defend her because she's smaller and weaker and a lady). If you do nothing, you've proven yourself a punk bitch and she'll continue, leading yourself back to either situation A, where you hit her back, or when you can eventually leave, making it look like you ran away.   It's a Catch 22: Either ""Ooh, big man beating on a woman"" or ""You got beat up by a girl, you wuss!""  And of course, the law will side with the woman, even after watching the video where she CLEARLY initiated the whole thing.  I like the old samurai maxim where ""It is dishonorable for a man to cause a woman harm, though an honorable woman, knowing this, should not ever put a man in a position where he has no choice but to harm her."""

I think there's some statistic out there that a black male somewhere around 16-25 is more likely to be in jail than in school.  And that most don't grow up with a father (in jail or ran).  This also negatively affects the girls/women too, but in other different ways.  Namely in how they choose men to fuck/date and their expectations (which generally reinforces other criminal behavior in men).  But there's a growing black middle class that you don't see on youtube/worldstar."

Any examination of the women who are in U.S. prisons reveals that the majority are nonviolent offenders with poor education, little employment experience and multiple histories of abuse from childhood through adulthood.    So we should start with women because the majority of men in U.S. prisons are... superbly educated violent offenders with excellent career prospects and no history of abuse? That sounds right.   Women are also more likely than men to have children who rely on them for support   Ah, the good old ""think of the children!"" argument.   — 147,000 American children have mothers in prison.

Okay. She's got that.   Let's move to the feminist theory: deep breath in half baked at best. Absolutely true that there are far fewer women in prison than men. More research needs to be done to find out if ""imprisoned women with children=imprisoned caregiver"" is true. Merely assuming that these women are the primary caregiver to a child because tits is bad science. Bad science! No testable results for you! Why does prison impact women differently than men? She didn't answer this question in an easy to understand way, simply calling it a ""male"" institution does a disservice to males who may not identify with a traditional ""male"" caricature, and could be just as negatively impacted. Bad feminist theory, you forgot that gay men exist. That's cool though, because they aren't women thus of course evil patriarchy.   I agree that women's prison's should be done away with, well, let me fix that, I agree that the current prison system should be overhauled in light of longitudinal data that shows prison does more harm to society than good.   Caregivers when imprisoned should be able to provide support to their children as much as possible, basing this access off gender alone is so anti-feminist, Limbaugh is currently masturbating to it.

And then when we ask why people say because it would keep women who were actually raped or abused from coming forward out of fear of punishment.  Which to me is very stupid logic. I mean a person commits a crime,and they are punished... How does that scare people who didn't commit a crime from coming forward? They say that other women won't look at it like, Well they just got in trouble because they lied. I'm telling the truth. Which is ignorant..   By this logic should we not convict murders who comes forward out of fear of keeping other murders from coming forward?"
PussyPass,2lbcu0,s_w_,0,Thu Nov 13 00:29:07 2014 UTC,"Uh, what?  The idea is, if you imprison one woman who made a report of rape, other women will be deterred from report.

PussyPass,2lbcu0,malvoliosf,2,Wed Nov 5 15:32:24 2014 UTC,This centers on the idea that if the man is found not guilty then the woman would be charged by default with filing a false claim.

A not guilty finding on the rape charges has nothing at all to do with wether or not the woman filed a false claim.

No, I don't think it does.  I think anyone would be wise to be extremely circumspect about doing anything that would put them in range of a felony complaint.  The mechanisms of ""justice"" are too creaky and unreliable.  If I were living in a jurisdiction that had a reputation for cracking down on (purportedly) false rape allegation and a friend told me she had been raped on a date, I would tell her, ""Forget it.

Which is not what happened. Actually, none of the bullet points for that first list apply, except for the ""game"" comparison - and Dunham's ""game"" was honestly basically just bribing her sister with tangible rewards for sexual favors. That's a lot different from ""show me yours and I'll show you mine"" type games.  On the other hand here's the list from that article of abnormal sex play:   One child entices or forces the other into sex play. There is an age difference of more than three years between children. The sex play is not appropriate: for example, oral-genital contact between a six-year-old and a three-year-old. The event occurs more than once despite your careful intervention and supervision. These are grounds to protect your child from another by terminating the friendship. If the sex play is between siblings, seek professional help. If your child has been threatened to keep it a secret.   Emphasis mine. All of these, except for the threat to keep it secret, definitely apply.

No belligerence, I know what happens when you don't submit.  I had a poor driving record and it took 15 months and over a dozen appearances to be sentenced. In NY, murderers and rapists do not have to pay to cover the costs of probation but those charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence are required to pay the state to cover these costs, hence the fines. $1000. each for no insurance and refusal to blow in the booze box, the rest in fees/fines and probation. Don't ever blow, it saved me from a DWI.   Here's the kicker: I paid my fines in a timely fashion and never missed probation. ""Paid my debt to society"" so to speak, in 1989. 6 months? 5 years? It is a life sentence. When an employer asks 'have you ever been convicted of a felony?' I can lie and open myself up for termination without reason for lying if they find out, or tell the truth and watch my chance for interview call backs dry up.   So when I see a double murderer, especially one who preys on the weakest of us, I find it appalling.

Most of those people keep it quiet because they don't want to risk their jobs or their reputation because they know the bad rep weed has now. The ones giving weed a bad name have always been losers.

PussyPass,2l37mw,ZombieOmNom,17,Mon Nov 3 04:03:50 2014 UTC,"Exactly. And people actually donated. It isn't right for me to feel this way, but I often see women like her and I don't try to speak up or even fight what they are trying o do because i know someone out there will come along and fall for it. I've been beaten down by how other males can be blind to when a woman is pulling something.  A lot of this attitude stems from being in the Navy. I saw it all throughout my time in, but I'll use one time period as an example.   At one point there were 4 main supervisors in my department. We were all third classes meaning we were the first step in the chain of command. The other three let females do and get away with whatever they wanted, and I wouldn't. (this included others in the chain of command above us. No one really held females accountable.)  A female would be trying to manipulate or pull something and a lot of the time it seemed like something small, but it was still a test to see what they could get away with. So I would try and put a stop to it and there was always one of the other three third classes who made it a point to say in front of whichever female was pulling something, What does it matter, sw? or Why do you care, sw? And this set a bad precedent because 1 of four supervisors was telling them no.. Making half of them just assume I had some personal problem with them because that is how their world view worked.. And the other half just learned to go around me.  Then the other 3 guys couldn't figure out why the females wouldn't listen, and why they felt like they could get away with so much.  And this got me into a bad way of thinking.. Because I will often assume, why fight it, someone else is going to come along and give them what they want or fall for it..  But that is just one of the huge headaches when it comes to being a male.. There are always other males out there who set a bad precedent and then insult you or want to get physical with you when you point out what is going on.  People didn't even just stop giving her money after she reached her goal, they kept going.. Sure the post was taken down, but like I said above... She still got $500.. So she really didn't learn her lesson.. She still sees the world exactly how she saw it before.. She has this view of, I don't care if some people talk badly about what I'm doing, men will still find me attractive, I'll still have friends, people will still donate. I'll still get what I want and come back from the negativity because I'm a pretty young woman. ....  She didn't lose anything. If the donation page was taken down immediately and her IP address had been blocked for a week then she might have learned to be responsible. But as usually everything worked."

But they just get ignored.  And when it comes down to it.. We have kids running the military. It's crazy when you think about it. I mean you've got 19 year olds on the flight deck directing traffic and 22 year old sw running the davit / crew which launches the search and rescue boats.. And kids aren't always mature or had enough life experience to know a lot of things.  I'm not talking down toward these youths. I'm just pointing out who actually is responsilbe for a lot of serious things performed in the military. because not everyone knows this is going on. I was one of them doing serious things.. things i wasn't qualified to do.. And that is one great thing about being a man that actually benefited me. People in my chain of command were always just throwing me into things because i was man and my job was to toughen up. It really helped my confidence and helped me see that I don't have near as many limits as I thought.  Don't get me wrong.. making me do specific tasks and work harder just because I was a male was bullshit, but it did benefit me in the long run. I'll try anything or volunteer for all kinds of stuff now. It's amazing how much people can really do and learn. Society just puts limits on us. Telling us we need certain things to qualify in order for certain jobs, etc. Like how high school has so much weight on our futures. I was a different person out of the Navy. And to look back and judge me for how poorly I did in school prior to the navy will always bother me. I am going to miss out on opportunities and experiences because I was a dumb kid who didn't take high school seriously because of shitty circumstances.  But I'm on my way to doing exactly what it is I've always wanted to. I may be turning 26 and getting there a bit late, but it worked for me. Taking a different path, but I'm slowly getting there. Definitely harder to get my foot in the door because my college's name doesn't look as good on resumes despite giving me the same training an d education a the big names.... But I'm getting there."

I'd assume many quit (retire) because of getting married or pregnant.  So, let's assume we are looking at 7% who actively look to get promoted and don't quit (my assumption).  Let's also assume that only the top 30% do well, verses the top 10% of men.  So, 2% of the military (who are women) are getting that special treatment.  Not a big number, but could piss off a lot of men who quit the military after less than 10 years of service.    The same was said about blacks, back in the day."

PussyPass,2l37mw,FlyingSpaghettiMan,2,Tue Nov 4 23:36:21 2014 UTC,This is why I think a gender segregated army would be a good idea.
PussyPass,2l37mw,s_w_,2,Mon Nov 3 16:01:26 2014 UTC,"That could work, but if women are put in harms way then men have a natural instinct to protect them, even if it means failing their mission.  This is just one of the reasons women don't belong in combat.  I read an excellent article by a woman ex-soldier who is against a non-segregated army mostly because the physical standards are so wildly different.  Men are expected to be able to climb over 10 feet walls, do a bunch of pull ups, carry a lot of equipment, have the strength to carry a wounded soldier, etc.  Meanwhile it is rare for a woman to be able to climb a wall like that, they are not required to do any pull ups, and they just don't have the natural strength to carry the equipment or carry another soldier.  It's not sexist if it is biology that is the problem.  Women could definitely fill roles in the military and do great at it, but when they're in war zones it just raises too many issues and a military (especially one as good as the USA's) is meant to have as perfect unit cohesion as possible.  Unit cohesion just falls apart.  There is nobody to blame really, it was an experiment, and hopefully soon we will all realize that feelings don't trump biology."

If you studied history, you'd find many examples where both men and women worked the same jobs and fought in the same wars.  Women have advantages as well as disadvantages.

The issue is how women are treated, since they are clearly the minority and fill few leadership roles.  How women treat men is really a non-issue, insofar as rules and regulations are written for all soldiers and any penalties for breaking them is non-gender specific.    Men are very well represented in all areas of the military, women are still not.  This is a culture and training issue.  It may always be an issue (in that women generally avoid military service and are usually the ones to quit and raise kids).     I think the same could be said about other minorities, gays and blacks come to mind.  The institutions were created to prevent these groups from serving or denying them from advancing.  It will take a long time before these filters are really removed.  The issue has never been white men can't advance."

This logic is fucking retarded, allow me to demonstrate why:   How men treat women is really a non-issue, insofar as rules and regulations are written for all soldiers and any penalties for breaking them is non-gender specific.    As you can see it works both ways.   The institutions were created to prevent these groups from serving or denying them from advancing.

From Uber's website regarding ""Price Surges"":  ""What is surge pricing and how does it work?""  With surge pricing, Uber rates increase to get more cars on the road and ensure reliability during the busiest times. When enough cars are on the road, prices go back down to normal levels.

The company has no responsibility to assume parenting duties by treating you like a child.  This is the same nonsense when girls make false sexual-assault and Rape claims because they regret sex the previous night (buyer's remorse).  if you're too drunk to responsibly order a Taxi, don't even remember confirming the price, and the next day find yourself living the consequences of your drunk decisions, then you're too stupid to go out with access to money.

It varies in every state to a degree, but generally in the absence of a statute, attempt requires that you satisfy the mens rea for the underlying crime and take action toward that ends which is calculated to cause or has a substantial risk of causing the desired outcome.   The test cases I've looked at say that HIV infection isn't likely enough to be akin to firing a gun at someone, so it isn't attempted murder per se. But if you form the intent to kill someone through a certain action and carry out that action, likelihood of success doesn't matter. Saliva has virtually no chance of transmitting HIV, but a prison inmate who spit at a guard and told him he would infect him was convicted while an HIV-positive rapist wasn't because he communicated no intent to transmit the disease."

PussyPass,2kx8rq,flooberses,6,Sat Nov 1 05:29:42 2014 UTC,"Well because saying something ""is a bad thing"" IS NOT homophobia. And the term is so often misused because it's just thrown around as a norm. Homophobia is a fear of people who are gay or becoming gay. That's like someone saying ""eww I don't like spiders"" WOAH you're arachnaphobic. No. Phobia is an irrational fear. Not implying it's just something they don't like."

PussyPass,2kx8rq,OmnipotentPenis,1 point,Mon Nov 10 11:26:42 2014 UTC,"It has nothing to do with morality, but everything to do with the actual definition of the word.   Although sexual attitudes tracing back to Ancient Greece (8th to 6th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (ca. 600 AD)) have been termed homophobia by scholars, the term itself is relatively new.[11] Coined by George Weinberg, a psychologist, in the 1960s,[12] the term homophobia is a blend of (1) the word homosexual, itself a mix of neo-classical morphemes, and (2) phobia from the Greek φόβος, Phóbos, meaning ""fear"" or ""morbid fear"".[13][14][15] Weinberg is credited as the first person to have used the term in speech.[11] The word homophobia first appeared in print in an article written for the May 23, 1969, edition of the American pornographic magazine Screw, in which the word was used to refer to heterosexual men's fear that others might think they are gay.[11]  Conceptualizing anti-LGBT prejudice as a social problem worthy of scholarly attention was not new. A 1969 article in Time described examples of negative attitudes toward homosexuality as ""homophobia"", including ""a mixture of revulsion and apprehension"" which some called homosexual panic.[16] In 1971, Kenneth Smith used homophobia as a personality profile to describe the psychological aversion to homosexuality.[17] Weinberg also used it this way in his 1972 book Society and the Healthy Homosexual,[18] published one year before the American Psychiatric Association voted to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.[19][20] Weinberg's term became an important tool for gay and lesbian activists, advocates, and their allies.   Educate yourself next time before you make an ass out of yourself."
PussyPass,2kx8rq,jakelove12,1 point,Mon Nov 10 14:07:13 2014 UTC,"Yes, I'm aware that people began using the word incorrectly, which gave ""homophobia"" the incorrect meaning that it is commonly recognized as having today. However, from the very text you posted, ""the word was used to refer to heterosexual men's fear that others might think they are gay."" This means that indeed, homophobia entails a fear, not a hatred.   You bleeding-hearts are so annoying."
PussyPass,2kx8rq,OmnipotentPenis,1 point,Tue Nov 11 03:19:02 2014 UTC,"Lol, you're either delusional or just can't read properly.  The person who adopted the ""incorrect"" meaning of homophobia is the person who made the term up in the first place. Stop being a clown."
PussyPass,2kx8rq,jakelove12,2,Fri Nov 14 01:28:34 2014 UTC,"You know full well homophobia is a blanket term for prejudice against homosexuals.  Arguing against it using pointless syntax is just being contrary for the sake of it.   Homophobia encompasses a range of negative attitudes and feelings toward homosexuality or people who are identified or perceived as being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT). It can be expressed as antipathy, contempt, prejudice, aversion, or hatred, may be based on irrational fear, and is sometimes related to religious beliefs.[1][2][3][4][5][6]"

All she'd have to do is yell rape with their hands on her and everyone within a 100-foot radius would proceed to bash the guy's skull in. She gets away with stealing, but it's a bit more complex than just because she's a woman and men are too attracted to her breasts to know any better.

A teacher asked me to stay behind and help set up buzzers for the Academic team tryouts. So I did. I'm working from right to left. the cable that connects each buzzer is short. So in order to connect another buzzer I had to lift the previous buzzer off of the desk it was on momentarily. So for about 3 seconds the buzzer on the desk to my right would be suspended by the shirt cable giving me enough slack to connect the next buzzer. I hadn't said a word and it was obvious what I was doing.   Then I heard it, Ugghhhhh! Just so you know!..... You pulled my buzzer off of my desk!... i just looked at her with a blank expression wondering if I should explain what I'm doing, but i could tell there was no getting through to her. Just the snottiness and unreasonableness about her tone. And she really believed I was doing her wrong by momentarily moving her buzzer in order to connect the next one. I wasn't being rude.. i wasn't even talking to her.. i was just connecting buzzers one by one..  After that she gave me a really hard time. Just constantly insulting me and trying to start things. We had a class together and I'd be on the other side of the room talking to friends and she would just sit over on her side and make comments.. Snottiest person I've ever known, but not the worst..

PussyPass,2kvqxw,Musicly2343,2,Thu Nov 6 01:43:53 2014 UTC,"This is the thread that makes me leave this sub. Come on, man. Some things are pussy pass, some things are men being assholes. Believe it or not, catcalling is abhorrent behavior."
PussyPass,2kvqxw,Musicly2343,4,Fri Oct 31 22:44:12 2014 UTC,"It isn't the cat calling I personally have a problem with, its the entitled attitude that says ""all men are cat calling me, even when their words read hello."""
PussyPass,2kvqxw,lordthat100188,0,Fri Oct 31 22:48:38 2014 UTC,"It's not the words - it's the attitude and intent. It has actually nothing to do with the words. Catcalling isn't about saying hi I'm the off chance you might actually get to meet and get to know the beautiful girl - it's a power play allowing you to heckle her and she can't do anything about it. Anyway, don't heckle women, dude. They hate it - isn't that reason enough not to do it?"
PussyPass,2kvqxw,Musicly2343,2,Fri Oct 31 22:53:51 2014 UTC,"I have read several comments like this around reddit; comments saying that it is about intent. Sometimes (most times) a hello is just a hello. Also as far as I know, mind reading isn't a thing, so I have no idea how someone could hear the words 'good morning' and just know that there was malicious intent behind it. I'm just saying that whenever I accidentally make eye contact when walking past someone in public, I usually say hello; I dunno, I guess I figure its less wierd that way.  TLDR: Sometimes a hello is just a hello."
PussyPass,2kvqxw,lordthat100188,2,Sat Nov 1 00:50:46 2014 UTC,"who ever said everyone is heckling women by saying pleasantries. if that's true, I've been heckling everyone I see immediately when I see them that day. Being hyper sensitive about greetings is the most victim mentality thing I can think of."

PussyPass,2ktupt,ThePedanticCynic,0,Fri Oct 31 01:56:22 2014 UTC,So the scum in the video have something to do with feminism ?
PussyPass,2ktupt,rapscallionx,35,Fri Oct 31 02:02:21 2014 UTC,"A dude showing up out of nowhere to attack a man he's 3x larger than, in defense of a woman, a situation he's utterly unaware of? That's definitely the result of feminist propaganda, even if he's never heard it directly in his life."
PussyPass,2ktupt,sizzletron,7,Fri Oct 31 02:07:19 2014 UTC,"I agree with your sentiment, but not with what you're saying. I don't think feminism creates the urge to protect women, however, I do think that feminism does it's best to hide the fact that women are protected so vigorously in western culture. This is an attempt to further their selfish agenda. Protecting women is instinctive to men that's why you see people lacking self awareness acting on those instincts."

PussyPass,2ktupt,ThePedanticCynic,-10,Fri Oct 31 06:26:19 2014 UTC,"That's not the result of feminist propoganda, if anything it contradicts the feminist movement. I think a feminist would be upset that the big guy assumes the woman can't take care of herself. The attacker is actually hitting the little guy as a result of the traditional value of treating women as delicate helpless objects."
PussyPass,2ktupt,Krono5_8666V8,9,Fri Oct 31 05:22:14 2014 UTC,"It's like you don't know anything at all about feminism. They want all the benefits, but none of the consequences. They love it when white knights jump in to help them because it allows them to engage without any real risk, but they also want to ensure when a woman starts a fight she isn't the one charged with a crime.  They want/fight for/have the privilege of starting a fight with a man with next to zero risk of legal or physical consequences. Independence is just something they spout to make it seem like they're not full of shit to people who don't know any better."
PussyPass,2ktupt,KageStar,-2,Fri Oct 31 06:55:05 2014 UTC,"Venetian is supposed to be about female empowerment, and fighting the advantage they believe men have in society. I'm not denying that there are feminists who want what you're talking about, but no tenant of any form of feminism includes men assuming a woman is to weak to defend herself. This guy jumping in is an extreme version of the classic feminist complaint of men holding doors for women."
PussyPass,2ktupt,rapscallionx,4,Fri Oct 31 07:06:13 2014 UTC,"I wish you were around to argue for the Nazis: ""No tenant of National Socialism includes genocide, so it not real feels"""
PussyPass,2ktupt,Hoodwink,-2,Fri Oct 31 08:37:36 2014 UTC,"Well actually he hits a boy he's larger than. It's actually chivalry,  feminism employs romantic notions as such when it benefits them however. Hitting a woman is seen as a non honorable act so thus he must champion her honor and protect her even though she is the attacker."
PussyPass,2ktupt,ExBABYYy,2,Fri Oct 31 03:50:53 2014 UTC,I don't think that that's what he's saying.

Some girls are really fucking strong and can kick almost any guys ass and bitches like in this video don't fucking mind to do it.  Man I fucking hate bitches like her.  I'm done with my rage now
PussyPass,2ktupt,KageStar,4,Fri Oct 31 07:53:31 2014 UTC,"Yeah, because the average person isn't really a fighter, thus it's not hard to be able to beat up and majority of the population if you put a little time into being able to do so. There's just a shit ton of guys that she wouldn't be able to bum rush, even guys his size. His form was terrible and he couldn't fight to begin with, it's dumb how people automatically assume every guys > any woman. Just too much variety for that to even hold logically or scientifically."
PussyPass,2ktupt,teeelo,0,Fri Oct 31 14:30:29 2014 UTC,"If I look at my SO, she is 154cm tall and weighs 46kg, but she is really strong with her tiny arms. She can lift me with 1 arm and walk me thru the room (im around 75kg)."
PussyPass,2ktupt,kurokabau,-6,Fri Oct 31 15:03:15 2014 UTC,"Congrats? I can lift you with one arm as well, 75kg is not a lot of weight to move. Strength is relative only to the person you're dealing with, and your body weight composition and resistance does play a factor. I can easily throw someone who is 250lbs(113kg) but if they're proportionately strong for their weight and understand positioning and leverage then it makes the job a whole lot harder. Which in the video, the guy did half the work for him when standing as he had all of his weight back which any person can push him over, that's just basic physics and mechanics independent on how strong or well trained the opponent is."
PussyPass,2ktupt,I_HaveAHat,1 point,Fri Oct 31 18:48:26 2014 UTC,"I do think he was holding back, partially because he didn't know how to fight and partially because he knew that if he would unleash the fury he would be swarmed by a dozen white nights to protect that Womans sweet innocence."

PussyPass,2ktupt,Soapboxmegaphone,2,Fri Oct 31 20:26:42 2014 UTC,How was that the right thing? He walked into a situation he had no knowledge of and assaulted someone. The right thing would have been to break up the fight and try to understand what's going on.
PussyPass,2ktupt,Musicly2343,-4,Tue Nov 4 14:14:38 2014 UTC,the young fellow (for whatever reason) was fighting a girl.

Phrasing it as ""A person"", in addition to infinitely more future proof and accurate, gives them no such excuses. Mentioning men just lets them bring up whatever argument they recently read and bookmarked.  No one can argue with the phrase when it's put as ""A person"".  Just worth considering. I just find these tactics more successful at reaching the other side.

If we don't, we're literally the cause of our misfortune.  We've used the power we have with our Patriarchy to absolutely slaughter the criminal rights of men and massively, massively favour women for the exact same crimes. The only way we can fix this is by joining feminism and admitting everything is about making life easier for men, and we gotta make it harder! That'll make it easier!  Holy fuck seriously do these people even Introspect at all? It's amazing how much actual control feminism has established over public perception. I don't even disagree with older-feminism.  Rather, I am an Egalitarian. I want every single person to have the same opportunity as me, and I as them.  They say that's what they care about, but only do anything that benefits one side, insults you if you bring up the other side, ignore any issues brought up, slander you if you do etc. All while under a name that literally only references one gender. Yet if I'm not part of this movement, i am against equality?  I am an Egalitarian. I've actually been literally called out by many feminists as being part of an anti-woman movement because of that.  I repeat. My egalitarianism has been used as ""proof"" I am for the oppression of anyone who isn't a white male.  It's just.. how can you reason with people like that. It's so frustrating. Then that frustrating causes a lot of people to call them dumb bitches. Which they are. I'm sorry but if you feel that way, you are a dumb fucking bitch. If you are a male that feels that way, you are a dumb dickhead. Gendered insults? Yep, because english uses Grammar. The fact that I think you are a dumb bitch has as much to do with lowering the rights of women, as the fact that I think a guy with your opinion is a dumb dickhead is about lowering the rights of men.

At first it bothered me but to be honest I don't think I really cared; women have a right to fulfill certain fantasies just like we do (sucks how much easier it is for them). Sure I think he's a dirtbag.. but I also think this teacher chick is a dirty fucking slut.   I fully agree with the fact the kid should of kept his mouth shut he's 16 not 12 he knew what he was doing.   edit: I dated her 4 years after the fact wasn't with her at the time of her doing this."
PussyPass,2kiida,Hiscore,4,Sun Nov 9 19:17:35 2014 UTC,The problem I have with it is that the teacher is in a position of authority and is abusing it.

PussyPass,2kiida,NormSonOfAGunderson,-1,Wed Oct 29 01:01:31 2014 UTC,They absolutely should go to prison. An Army DS just received a load of time for extorting sex from privates. This teacher would be violating statutory rape laws and be abusing their power.  That's bad.

That doesn't make the kid who was molested a lucky kid.  He was a victim of rape.  I hate that double standard.
PussyPass,2kiida,NormSonOfAGunderson,3,Tue Oct 28 14:59:13 2014 UTC,"We have no idea whether the kid enjoyed it or not. For all we know, this only got out because he bragged to his friends. Maybe he was lucky."
PussyPass,2kiida,cravf,3,Wed Oct 29 14:06:51 2014 UTC,He was a victim of rape.   At 16 I find it hard to swallow that he was not completely willing to have sex with that woman.
PussyPass,2kiida,NormSonOfAGunderson,7,Tue Oct 28 05:34:43 2014 UTC,"Yes... That is statutory rape.  He is not old enough to consent to it.  If it was a female student and a male teacher, the teacher would be labeled a monster.."
PussyPass,2kiida,Hiscore,5,Wed Oct 29 20:22:21 2014 UTC,"I'm personally on the fence on this one. I think it's a very gray area and it's safer for teachers to not have sex with students either way.   That being said though, when I was 16 I was fully capable of consenting to sex. I also was a technical victim of statutory rape when I was 17 (by having sex with someone that was 21) and absolutely would not want to see that person going to prison because they didn't actually rape me and I absolutely did consent.   I do agree that if the genders were reversed in my example that person could have easily gotten in a large amount of trouble, but I would rather see less men being labeled as sex offenders than seeing more women being labeled for sex offenders."
PussyPass,2kiida,Veylis,-1,Tue Oct 28 15:25:38 2014 UTC,"Here's the thing.  at 16 you might very well know plenty about intercourse.  But suppose the teacher has HIV and is really hot.  But you don't know she has HIV.  Honestly, how hard would it be for her to talk you into sex without a condom?  You're not going to be thinking straight about sexual decisions at that age.   I can think back to being 16 and having a teacher named Ms. Bulka.  She was hot and every guy was in love with her.  Back then if she would have thrown herself at me, I would have pretty much done anything she wanted me to do.  She could have owned me sexually.  She could have affected my grades then if I pulled away from her.. She could have ruined my teenage years by consuming me.    Also, understand that with teenagers, maturity always comes at different times.  I know people who made it to 19 and knew very little about sex.  So while most guys are aware, many aren't, which is why they use 18 as the blanket age to protect everyone..."
PussyPass,2kiida,Hiscore,-1,Tue Oct 28 22:51:46 2014 UTC,Still rape. Besides she mentally abused him.
PussyPass,2kiida,Veylis,-2,Tue Oct 28 20:39:12 2014 UTC,"Legally it is statutory rape, which is often a victimless crime. The fact that something is illegal doesn't always make inherently it wrong.  How did she mentally abuse him? He was 16 and bragged about it to his friends. I have met 24 year olds with the mentality of 15 year olds and 16 year olds with the mentality of 30 year olds."
PussyPass,2kiida,DOZENS_OF_BUTTS,1 point,Wed Oct 29 17:33:19 2014 UTC,"You're wrong.  Any abuse of power by an individual with authority is a clear and egregious violation of the rights of the victim. He was used and she coerced him into it.  She played on his psyche and got burned.  Also, it's still rape and mostly it is a victimed crime, since people are psychologically abused."
PussyPass,2kiida,Veylis,3,Wed Nov 5 09:29:55 2014 UTC,Is there more to this story or something? You seem to be very dogmatic about this topic.
PussyPass,2kiida,NormSonOfAGunderson,1 point,Wed Nov 5 12:49:48 2014 UTC,Maybe /u/Hiscore is just saying what he/she is saying because abusing a position of power over someone to have sex with them is wrong. There doesn't need to be a backstory. I feel the same way and I don't have a backstory to why I feel that way.
PussyPass,2kiida,Veylis,3,Wed Oct 29 14:07:48 2014 UTC,A gym teacher doesn't have much power in that situation. In reality the student has all the power since they can explode the teacher's life over the relationship.
PussyPass,2kiida,NormSonOfAGunderson,0,Wed Oct 29 15:51:18 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure how you can say statutory rape is a victimless crime.  While they're not being forcefully raped, they're often being manipulated by someone older than them.  They're still kids man.  At 25 years old, you're usually in a position where you have a car, money, a place of your own, etc.  You can easily trick a high school girl into thinking you're awesome.  Buy her alcohol, etc.  That is not a victimless crime.  Marijuana use is a victimless crime...  Manipulating a minor for your own sexual benefit is a crime..."
PussyPass,2kiida,Veylis,4,Wed Oct 29 17:16:00 2014 UTC,We fundamentally disagree. I have known older guys that have been mercilessly manipulated by much younger girls. It just doesn't work as a blanket statement to say the older person in a sexual relationship always has all the power.
PussyPass,2kiida,NormSonOfAGunderson,0,Wed Oct 29 17:26:54 2014 UTC,"I see what you're saying.  I know guys who were manipulated by younger girls as well.  I think the difference is that those guys are adults and should know better. Being young and being blinded by a cute girl are a bit different.  Not that I haven't been guilty of the latter myself. ha.  Being under a certain age makes you more vulnerable, or so the law says.    Besides if you don't agree, then what age is the cutoff?  Is it ok if it's a 30 year old woman and a 15 year old boy, 14? 13? etc..  Your age cutoff is your personal belief, but most people believe otherwise. There's a reason why 18 is such a landmark age in many places.  It's widely believed that is when you become an adult and can consent to many things, on top of sex."
PussyPass,2kiida,0Fsgivin,2,Mon Nov 3 06:35:31 2014 UTC,"It is widely believed in the US. The age of 16 is rooted in old Victorian and evangelical Christian moral philosophy. The age of consent varies quite a bit around the world. Today the average is around 15-16 even in the US.  My personal cutoff I suppose would be 14. I feel like we demonize sex enough as it is. It's just sex, its not like these girls are being beaten or anything. If a 14 year old girl wants to have sex with an 18 year old boy who cares? I had sex with a 22 year old woman when I was 16. I didn't even think of it as an issue at all.  18 is just as arbitrary as anything else. You apparently cannot make an informed decision about alcohol until 21 in most of the US so why not just add sex to the 21 limit as well?  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Age_of_Consent.png  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent"
PussyPass,2kiida,0Fsgivin,1 point,Mon Nov 3 12:17:18 2014 UTC,"Some states have a clause for age of consent about the age of the older person though.  I think in Florida the age of consent is 16, but the older person cannot be older than 24.    I was with a 24 year old woman at 17 (had just turned 17).  The thing is, when I hit 24, I thought that girl was kind of weird for doing that.  But to each their own I guess.  I still see a problem with 30/40/50 something teachers banging high school kids.  We all have our own moral compass which is why we have to defer to the law for these things.  You're comfortable with a 14 year old, but I would definitely not be.  I'm 33 and to me that would be very wrong."

PussyPass,2kiida,triskaidekaphobics,0,Wed Oct 29 19:46:00 2014 UTC,"Age of consent:       The age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts, and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and their sex partner as the offender.  The term age of consent rarely actually appears in legal statutes;  it has sometimes been used with other meanings, such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to marriage,  but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood. It should not be confused with the age of majority, age of criminal responsibility, the voting age, the drinking age, driving age, etc.  Age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,  though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18. The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the actors, or other restrictions such as abuse of a position of trust. Some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age. Charges resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a misdemeanor such as corruption of a minor, to what is popularly called statutory rape (which is considered equivalent to rape, both in severity and sentencing).  There are many ""gray areas"" in this area of law, some regarding unspecific and untried legislation, others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes, and others due to conflicts between federal and state laws. These factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject, and a topic of highly charged debates.

A few cops drove by and only one stopped to ask what we were doing and then just drove off. Lots of people walked past. A few offered help. I can't imagine being a black male with black friends get away with that so easily.

PussyPass,2khilc,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,2,Mon Oct 27 23:55:08 2014 UTC,His point is 'Why is it in pussypass.'
PussyPass,2khilc,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,9,Tue Oct 28 00:28:39 2014 UTC,"The Only person who called the cops on her was another woman,  but in an nonsimulated context it's clear she'd gotten away with it. Compare her situation to the black male and even the white male to a lesser extent,  the black male was instantly confronted and even a lot of people approached the white male; however,  the woman was not confronted she was in fact assisted one guy even ignored and went against his wife to help her. Making this a pussy pass.   TL;DR: She took the back several times before she got the cops called her. The men were confronted,  the black male instantly caught mass outrage."
PussyPass,2khilc,mattsprofile,2,Tue Oct 28 01:57:03 2014 UTC,"The one thing that messes with this videos results is that the black dude is pretty small.

PussyPass,2khilc,psycharious,1 point,Tue Oct 28 15:52:07 2014 UTC,"I agree.  I think they weren't physically intimidated which is why everyone was so bold,  had he been in similar stature to the white dude, those people would have called the cops without hesitation first then tried to stall as opposed to confronting him then calling the cops. They seemed to call the cops more so because they felt insulted by his attitude.   So I guess another take away from the video is people are more apt to call the cops when they feel like they themselves can't stop the problem or they want to be spiteful."

One of the flaws or the main flaw I saw, was that there wasn't a black female test. It really showed that people regardless of race will give the white person the benefit of the doubt,  with men then going out of their way to help the pretty girl even if they know she's in the wrong.   There's also the gender dynamic ignored as a woman is not biased to help another woman just like a man is less based to a man, since the sex appeal isn't there.    Note: I am also over simplifying these dynamics, there are more dynamics and nuances, but these are really general impressions you can take from the video, outside of personal bias or prejudices."

MRAs and such tend to see this as horrible abuse just like how it's treated with women, but honestly, not a whole lot of men care. Feminism in media has put the standard that assault against women is offensive and disrespectful whereas assault against men is funny/cute/empowering for women to do so. Both genders view it thay way a lot of the time.  I don't think it's right, but I don't have a problem if men are alright with it. It becomes a problem when these types of women think it's universally okay to do that to any man and be able to get away with it. To laugh about it no matter the context of the circumstances."

It's not something I'm sure of my stance on because until today I've never considered it, but it seems fair to say that if a male is raped it's not fair to force him to become a father if he doesn't want to be, especially with the (admittedly rare) cases of male rape victims being forced to pay child support later in life. Since the ""mother"" has proven herself irresponsible, in the cases of female on male rape it seems it should be the males choice what happens to the fetus, barring dangerous conditions for the mother. If it's not going to kill her in childbirth and the guy wants to keep the child, it seems his rapist brought the pain and problems of childbirth on herself. It's not about punishing her (for me at least, dickbag69 might disagree,) it's an issue of males not having enough choice regarding fatherhood on a good day and women not being held responsible for their actions.  It sucks that it has to happen to ""deh bodyz,"" but it feels like they should have considered that before drugging and raping children."

Just grant him immunity from having to pay child support (or go a step further and make the woman pay him grief money or something)  The fact remains that you can't force a surgery or other form of abortion on someone if they don't consent. Doing so would make you no better than they are, and would completely destroy the point of them being in prison and you being free."

We can put someone in prison for the rest of their lives, but we can't perform an operation that has no long term effect on the prisoner? It's not even a punishment, it's giving men the right to say they don't want someone to be able to hold them down, forcibly extract their semen, and use that dna to create a new organism. The difference between prison and such a simple operation is completely arbitrary. It might be a little traumatizing, but I feel like prison just might be as well."

PussyPass,2joc1m,Neodymie,2,Thu Oct 23 22:08:30 2014 UTC,"Could you even…could you even IMAGINE the reverse?  A woman who approached two men on the street outside a nightclub in Kazakhstan wound up flat on her back on the pavement after she chose her words poorly.  According the UK's Daily Mirror, Kondrata Golubev, 32, asked the two men how much they charged for sex – a comment they took exception to.  ""I was outside waiting for my girlfriend who was getting her coat when I saw an argument break out between the woman and two men,"" nightclub patron Anatoli Pokrovski told the news outlet.  ""She obviously thought that she was in with a chance, as she tried to ask them for a drink, and when they told her to get lost, she decided to insult them by asking of they were prostitutes and how much it would cost.""  The incident, which the Mirror says took place in the regional city of Atyrau in the country's west, left the woman suffering concussion.  Kazakh police who spoke to the newspaper said they believed the man was trained in a martial art.  ""The force behind that punch was so great we suspect this is not the first time he has hit something hard,"" a police spokesperson said.  © ninemsn 2014"

PussyPass,2jimrb,lexsird,5,Fri Oct 17 18:16:50 2014 UTC,I did. That level of emotional and physical abuse can crush a person completely. You see lots of abusive pet owners and their pets love them still. We wonder how a girl can receive a black eye every other week and still be with the same guy.
PussyPass,2jimrb,rarely-sarcastic,3,Sat Oct 18 00:31:30 2014 UTC,"Oh it's out there plenty, which is why it's incumbent upon ourselves to not only be wise to it, but to resist it. Nobody is going to save you from that shit but yourself. If you are too stupid to keep enabling the abuser, then part of that is on you. That isn't victim blaming, that's about having enough brains and guts to do right by yourself.   I know all about the abused women and the shit they go through, I worked as a Private Detective when I was young and we had lots of clients that were women that had crazy abusive BFs or ex husbands, etc. Cops see that kind of shit daily, I don't know how they keep from snapping when they encounter it, but then again some of the worse offenders I've encountered were cops themselves.   There are so damn many ways people can be abusive to each other it's sickening. I advise though not to put up with an iota of it, bounce, get some serious distance from them. Life is too short and fucked up enough without some asshole heaping abuse on you for whatever jacked up reason.   I think once a person has the experience of liberating themselves for the first time from an abusive relationship, it gives them the strength and experience to help them through and out of future bullshit relationships. I would also advise getting some quality therapy for your head afterwards. It helps to identify things in your own person that might lead you to make the same mistakes. It's just good personal policy to have clean mental hygiene and maintenance.   We all need a little help now and then no matter who you are."
PussyPass,2jimrb,lexsird,2,Sat Oct 18 01:40:23 2014 UTC,"I had a friend in a physically abusive relationship. Her bf was arrested twice, once for drunken misconduct in public and another time for disturbing peace or whatever but both those times he hit the gf and was never charged. We did all we could for her to try and save her but she was way too far gone and started to blame us for her problems. I don't talk to her anymore but she's in another abusive relationship now. This guy who I was really close with was in a very abusive relationship too. It was mostly mental abuse but I've seen him get hit in public by her a few times. None of us (his friends) reacted in any good way. We just kind of made fun of him for being so ""pussy-whipped""  and how he needs to get his shit together as a man. I feel bad about that but part of the reason why we didn't step in was because that bitch was crazy and had already accused 2 guys of attempted rape."
PussyPass,2jimrb,tangerinelion,1 point,Sat Oct 18 01:48:48 2014 UTC,"You have to cover your ass if you are a guy in a situation like that. I would advise him to set  up some secret surveillance gear to record the abuse, get a recording of it, then go to the police with it and explain your situation to the highest ranking person you can approach. If you can afford one, take a lawyer with you.   Evil fucked in the head women will pull out all the stops on shit they will do to you, and they will land you in some serious trouble because guys tend to be seriously fucked over because of how the pussypass mentality of our society works.   But if you lay the ground work and bring the authorities in on it, they aren't blind sided by the ploys of an evil cunt working the system. Get that shit documented and filed on paper. When you make your move out, either do so all in one swoop when she's gone or have a cop escort you and your shit out.   You can't fuck around, you have to be proactive with nutter bitches like that. With any luck you can have a restraining order handed to her on the way out the door with your stuff. It sounds damn extreme, but the alternative is the bitch can wreck your entire life, land you in jail, get you fired, beat up, etc, etc.   Players get played. Learn about someone before you get involved with them and never, ever stick your dick in crazy. The world is full of dumb fuckers who never learned that lesson. Guys make for the easiest of victims of abuse because one, few people believe them, and even if they do they little support.  A guy can just bounce more easier than a woman, they can't be physically forced as easy. That's why I say if you catch a whiff of bullshit, to bounce pronto."

I think the age of consent itself should be 14 to 16, not 18, and off the top of my head can think of multiple cases I know of where people should have never been charged with anything who are sitting on sex offender lists.   For that matter, I had a teacher in 8th grade who was a first year teacher that was hot as fuck and I would have consensually done all sorts of things to if she let me. I was 12 or 13.   It's not like most of these boys probably aren't willing participants. The reality is that we have arbitrary laws about sex that were written by puritans to punish anyone for it if they can come up with any excuse on the books in tons of states and people are scared to call them out as horseshit because they don't want to sound slutty or something.

If you're a man and a crime is committed against you by a woman, your legal recourse is almost non-existent.

The rest of his involvement was at the manipulation by, obligation to, and ultimately the responsibility of his father through indoctrination and fear.  The whole thing is rotten and he is not without responsibility for his actions. He was abandoned by the Harper government and abused in Gitmo beyond any shadow of a doubt.   The loss of Speers' life was tragic and was at the hands of the group Khadr was drawn into. To say Khadr is wholly innocent is naive and not my stance on it. However, his treatment was a gross violation of human and civil rights.  Here's hoping the tide of youths being drawn into conflict by lies and manipulation stops or is slowed by any amount.

Nope, she sure doesn't, but she doesn't deserve a light one either.   She put people's live's in danger because    This was my mother's car, it wasn't my own and I had a friend in the car with me   What does that even have to do with it?  And to you these lives are worth $600...  Making her pay a fine and sweeping it under the rug doesn't teach her a lesson."

Women now don`t even need to spend the time or effort to find out who the father of their children are, as long as they get a paycheck."

""You were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and, indeed, are the more guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction.""  ""If the law supposes that,"" said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands, ""the law is a ass — a idiot.

PussyPass,2ii9p3,Revons,7,Sun Oct 12 22:45:23 2014 UTC,"Well, assuming the woman doesn't tell anyone she was raped until it was too late, she is saddled with the actual child.  Fortunately for them, they have the option of taking a morning after pill, if they catch it early enough, having an abortion, or giving it up for adoption.  Hell, they don't even need to do paperwork, they can simply drop the baby off at a fire station or hospital and absolve themselves of all responsibility. Even if they weren't raped.  But men and boys have no choice in the matter after the initial sexual act. In the case of rape, they had no choice whatsoever. If the woman decides to keep the baby, the man is forced to accept her decision."

If this really is the case can he sue her for all the money he potentially has to pay for child support and somehow make it a wash?

PussyPass,2ii9p3,JManRomania,1 point,Thu Oct 9 09:57:38 2014 UTC,"Age of consent:       The age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts, and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and their sex partner as the offender.  The term age of consent rarely actually appears in legal statutes;  it has sometimes been used with other meanings, such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to marriage,  but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood. It should not be confused with the age of majority, age of criminal responsibility, the voting age, the drinking age, driving age, etc.  Age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,  though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18. The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the actors, or other restrictions such as abuse of a position of trust. Some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age. Charges resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a misdemeanor such as corruption of a minor, to what is popularly called statutory rape (which is considered equivalent to rape, both in severity and sentencing).  There are many ""gray areas"" in this area of law, some regarding unspecific and untried legislation, others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes, and others due to conflicts between federal and state laws. These factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject, and a topic of highly charged debates.

So basically that means that males are beating up their GFs and wives and the chicks aren't fighting back. With (some celebrity) busting open a can of whupass on his wife last week, we decided to conduct an informal survey of the Jezebels to see who's gotten violent with their women. After reviewing the answers, let's just say that it'd be wise to never ever fuck with us.  One Jezebel got into it with a chick while they were breaking up, while another Jez went nuts on his girl and began violently shoving her. One of your editors heard his girlfriend flirting on the phone with another guy, so he slapped the phone out of her hands and hit her in the face and neck... ""partially open handed."" Another editor slapped a girl when ""she told me she thought she had breast cancer."" (Okay, that one made us laugh really hard.) And lastly, one Jez punched a steady in the face and broke her glasses. She had discovered a sex story he was writing about another girl on his laptop, so she picked it up and threw it. And that's when he socked her. She was, uh, totally asking for it."

PussyPass,2hyowr,Stephen1985,6,Wed Oct 1 21:36:32 2014 UTC,"Shooting somebody in the crotch can kill them, they can bleed out"
PussyPass,2hyowr,Number357,10,Thu Oct 2 00:15:17 2014 UTC,"Yes and punching someone in the face can kill them, to be charged with attempted murder you must have tried to kill."
PussyPass,2hyowr,Stephen1985,-1,Thu Oct 2 00:42:09 2014 UTC,"It's not always about intent, hitting someone in the head with a blunt object or a professional boxer punching someone in the head can be tried as attempted murder."
PussyPass,2hyowr,Dnz2,1 point,Thu Oct 2 04:52:17 2014 UTC,"Yes if there is evidence to suggest that you intended to murder them, otherwise its assault with a deadly weapon.  Its all about intent, infact in order to convict for attempted murder they MUST show intent. if i accidentally shoot someone in the face that's manslaughter at best, if i intentionally shoot someone in the face then that would probably be attempted murder.  If you commit an act which does not normally result in death then it would be very difficult to pin a charge of attempted murder.  I would say that the fact she shot him where she did shows that she intended to punish him, not necessarily kill him."
PussyPass,2hyowr,Stephen1985,2,Thu Oct 2 05:04:10 2014 UTC,"I understand your reasons for wanting to label this attempted murder because I share many of them.  I am thinking from the legal standpoint of innocent until proven guilty. It seems clear that the woman's intent was to maim rather than kill. Yes he could have still died from these wounds but he didn't, if he had the charges would be different.  For you to be convicted of attempted murder the prosecution must demonstrate that you tried to kill the person.   I don't think this can be demonstrated in this case."
PussyPass,2hyowr,Stephen1985,-2,Fri Oct 31 23:36:17 2014 UTC,"The pussypass is in full force knowing that the woman would be charged with more than manslaughter if he actually had bled out.  So it's battery because she wasn't trying to kill him, she was trying to blow his dick off?  It should be attempted murder for the simple fact that blowing a dick off isn't like blowing off a finger.  That's not even to mention what would happen if a man shot a woman in the vagina.. roles reversed."
PussyPass,2hyowr,Dnz2,2,Fri Oct 31 23:56:24 2014 UTC,"I really dont think your understanding the fact that attempted murder means you intended to kill someone, It doesn't matter how horrible what she did was, you can't just decide something should be attempted murder because it was nasty.  If a woman had her genitals mutilated you cannot claim that's its attempted murder just because it was nasty.  if i went crazy on my partner and stabbed her genitals is that attempted murder? because i dont think it is."
PussyPass,2hyowr,Stephen1985,-3,Thu Oct 2 05:28:20 2014 UTC,"It's not about nasty or horrible it's about the chance of bleeding out to a wound, which is the same as the baseball bat to the head stuff I was just telling you about.  Look it up."
PussyPass,2hyowr,Dnz2,3,Thu Oct 2 05:48:59 2014 UTC,"If someone dies and you didn't mean to do it then its manslaughter.  Look at oscar pistorius, he shot his girlfriend while she was in the bathroom and he has been acquitted of premeditated murder, doesn't mean he wont be convicted of manslaughter but they couldn't prove that he was trying to kill her so they couldn't get him.  I took this from the CPS website ""Attempted murder requires an intention to kill. Accordingly, an offender convicted of this offence will have demonstrated a high level of culpability. Even so, the precise level of culpability will vary in line with the circumstances of the offence and whether the offence was planned or spontaneous. The use of a weapon may influence this assessment."""

PussyPass,2hyowr,Wraithstorm,4,Wed Oct 1 04:46:24 2014 UTC,It should be attempted murder any time anyone discharges a firearm intentionally at another person no matter what. Guns are not meant to maim.

There is some evidence that circumcision has health benefits, including:  A decreased risk of urinary tract infections. A reduced risk of some sexually transmitted diseases in men. Protection against penile cancer and a reduced risk of cervical cancer in female sex partners. Prevention of balanitis (inflammation of the glans) and balanoposthitis (inflammation of the glans and foreskin). Prevention of phimosis (the inability to retract the foreskin) and paraphimosis (the inability to return the foreskin to its original location). Circumcision also makes it easier to keep the end of the penis clean.  Note: Some studies show that good hygiene can help prevent certain problems with the penis, including infections and swelling, even if the penis is not circumcised. In addition, using a condom during sex will help prevent STDs and other infections."

Let's imagine for a second that removing a woman's clitoris was supported by a small portion of doctors, but there was an equally large camp of doctors that said it was bad. Would you be a-okay with parents choosing to remove their newborn daughter's clitoris? Is it a good enough excuse to start removing things like breasts, because it minorly improves the quality of life of the child?"
PussyPass,2hyowr,Skandranonsg,2,Mon Oct 6 19:39:30 2014 UTC,The clitoris and foreskin are two totally different things. Incomparable

PussyPass,2hyowr,Newoski,-1,Thu Oct 2 04:25:10 2014 UTC,"Dat slippery slope. Regardless the parents do have the right to make that decision for the child,  since the child is not capable of making it themself. And to compare foreskin and the clitoris is asinine in and of itself.  The foreskin is purely cosmetic skin fold while the clitoris is a nerve center. To make an accurate analogy for genital mutilation the parent would have to be removing the penis head in its entirety."
PussyPass,2hyowr,Skandranonsg,1 point,Thu Oct 2 05:23:30 2014 UTC,cosmetic? So it evolved in the principles as a peacocks tail feathers? How did this happen was the human mating ritual some kind of puppetry of the penis show?
PussyPass,2hyowr,KageStar,-1,Tue Oct 7 06:16:15 2014 UTC,"So body mutilation is okay, because it's purely cosmetic? You have to pick one. Is circumcision okay because it's cosmetic or because of the health benefits that may or may not be true.  Also, it's because the child cannot consent to that choice that we should not be doing it. If someone wants to be circumcised when they can consent to body modification then let them. There is a damn good reason why you aren't allowed to give tattoos or perform elective surgeries on children.  Spin it all you want, circumcision is elective surgery. Just like getting implants or botox."
PussyPass,2hyowr,Skandranonsg,-1,Thu Oct 2 06:07:07 2014 UTC,"But there's also a cultural religious value associated with it, and there are some health benefits even if they're disputed. If the procedure really fell under mutilation then it wouldn't be performed end of story. And before you misconstrue my point, I said comparing removing the foreskin to removing the clitoris is not correct as they serve two different functions. Nerve center =/= tip cover.   I mean, well bro, you're the one arbitrarily defining it as mutilation. Tell me how removing the foreskin is harming the function or damaging the appearance of the penis. Removing the clitoris is destructive to vagina as a whole, more than it's cosmetic. Therefore till you can actually definitively show that it's destructive on non-beneficial don't call it mutilation, and don't especially compare it to female genital mutilation, because it's not in the same ballpark.   I am circumcised I like it, sure my parents choose for me, but guess what it was their choice to make for me, not yours."
PussyPass,2hyowr,bojackhorsemen,-1,Thu Oct 2 07:38:39 2014 UTC,"Something being religious or cultural is not enough justification on its own for something that would be illegal under any other circumstances.  Let's find a more direct comparison. What if it were a cultural and religious tradition among a certain group that completely removing the nipple from males was important. Should that also be legal for the parents to do?  My point is that it shouldn't have to be a choice at all. Any reasoning you present is just post-hoc justification for the continuation of a bronze age religious tradition. Bodily autonomy is one of our base freedoms agreed upon as human beings, so why are we allowing anyone to cut off any part of our body for any reason other than immediate medical concern?"

When Cosmopolitan and MTV are constantly pushing ""you go grrl!"", ""show him a strong woman don't play dat!"" shit that a cheating husband/bf will be seen as justification for pretty much anything in their minds.

PussyPass,2hyowr,KageStar,-4,Thu Nov 27 04:21:20 2014 UTC,If you shoot at someone its considered reckless unless you have the intent to kill someone.  That is why when you shoot someone you get charged with anywhere between assault with a deadly weapon and first degree murder.    All you did was confess to first degree murder by admitting you knew where you were putting that bullet.    Lets say I left the house and everyone knew I was going to cut off someones leg and not kill them.  If I can prove that then I would not get charged with murder.  Maybe a crime resulting in a homicide which depending on the circumstances can be a degree of murder but that is up to a jury.  Murder is the premeditated unlawful killing of someone.  Not punching them in the face and them accidentally dieing.  That is a different crime.    TLDR: Punching someone in the face with out the intent to kill them with the result of them dieing is not murder.
PussyPass,2hyowr,SuperNinjaBot,2,Thu Nov 27 04:22:45 2014 UTC,That's at least manslaughter.

PussyPass,2hyowr,Varean,1 point,Wed Oct 1 17:42:34 2014 UTC,"Based on your analogy and phrasing,"" Punching someone in the face with out the intent to kill them with the result of them dieing"" is is at best justifiable homicide if being attacked or manslaughter otherwise.  There's no way you can intentionally punch someone in the face and not understand that such an action can severely hurt if not kill a person.  In the incident she shot him in the penis after leaving and coming back which is also premeditation. The crotch is a highly vascular region,  she's lucky she didn't knick a vein or artery or hit him in the intestine.  Which all of these spots are within inches of one another.   Before you condescend, you should make sure you are not talking out of your ass either. Just based on the situation there was no mitigating factor that justifies her actions,  I understand the argument of intent but regardless of whether or not she intended to she could have killed him. She shot him,  guns   aren't toys she intended to cause harm and suffering to him. Any chance for emotional distress went when she left and came back to shoot him."
PussyPass,2hyowr,SuperNinjaBot,1 point,Wed Oct 1 18:30:50 2014 UTC,"This could at least be tried as Attempted Manslaughter, she knew that this guy could die from this injury from blood loss. To be honest this is all up for the cops or the judge/jury to decide, she could have been charged with Attempted Manslaughter and pleaded to the lesser charge of Aggravated Battery. But to sit there and go light on her in the first place when they don't do the same for men is insane."

'Could at least'  Like you are a prosecutor of some kind.  Keep watching Law and Order kiddo.    Also INTENT is involved in determining what crime someone committed.  The fact that they meant to kill or maim makes EVERY difference in a murder/homicide.  Its the difference between walking, doing 7 years, doing 15 years, or doing life.    There is also a ""heat of the moment"" defense.  Which means even if you know all these things you didnt intend to kill someone. Yet in a certain set of circumstances they will deem you not guilty because you were so blinded by [insert rage, jealousy, passion] that you could not have premeditated your actions or understood the consequences of them at the given time.  Then there is good old affluenzia.  Being so rich and disconnected from society (along with heavy influences from their parents / hierarchy) that you do not understand the consequences of your actions.  4 killed in Texas remember?    There are a hundred (probably more) other circumstances which make you completely wrong."
PussyPass,2hyowr,Stephen1985,2,Thu Oct 2 04:02:42 2014 UTC,"You list all these ""possible""  scenarios when you just needed to use common sense (also, good job referring to me as 'kiddo' trying to insult me as a grown man, thank you) the article clearly states that she had to leave and go home (possibly a drive distance) and retrieve a Gun. Those who are sane and level headed would have cooled off by that point but she instead clearly had intent to cause bodily harm with potential to kill. Depending on his condition upon reaching the hospital it could be considered attempted manslaughter. You are right I am not a prosecutor (which by the way, I completely forgot, whoops!) and I stated I would leave it up to the judge or jury (should have included prosecutor) to decide what she was charged for. Again, I believe the evidence shows that she intentionally shot him, with a high potential to kill which  should warrant a higher charge than what she received."

She had no excuse to do this to these kids. I imagine they loved every second of it. But they are stupid kids and the law is there to protect them from a predator that essentially has them in her power as they will get into trouble is they don't attend her class, as well as the potential fear that she could make their lives harder if they refuse.  If she wanted to get attention and fuck around, there are plenty of grown men that would gladly have done it for her. The thing is, she did it for the ""naughty"" thrill, knowing what she was doing was wrong."
PussyPass,2hx5c4,Silverbacked,2,Tue Sep 30 20:25:29 2014 UTC,"I don't think so in this case. Age of consent in Pennsylvania is 16, but there is a ""corruption of minors"" charge, (which they nailed her for), for sex with someone between 16 and 18 if the other party is over 18.  There was a similar case in the UK where a teacher screwed his 16 year old student. AoC is 16 here so he didn't get prison time, but was obviously fired from being a teacher. That was about 10 years ago. Since they started a ""non-sexual"" relationship before she was 16 he'd probably be done under the new ""grooming"" statutes today.  The hammer really only comes down hard when you drop below AoC, for men anyway."
PussyPass,2hx5c4,Silverbacked,2,Tue Sep 30 22:29:36 2014 UTC,"There are laws specific to ""authority figures"" that are designed to prevent this. AoC doesn't count for teachers. Even if they were all 18 years old and having a consensual gang-bang with her, she is breaking the law.   As of 2012, it is illegal for a teacher in Pennsylvania to have a sexual relationship with any student, even if they are above the AoC."

If the teacher was a man, yes I feel the same, before anyone asks. Age of consent should be more around 14 to 16 rationally, not that it's a good idea but I don't see how it should be criminal.   If the person is consenting, they're not being raped. It's not a good idea, just like plenty of other things that are bad ideas, but it's not something that should be a crime that results in prison."

I think that the man can choose to be pathetic loser if he does nothing or rapist if he defends himself. It seems that the only thing that our society will accept is if it man runs away from the bitch.

Not much of a limb to go out on to figure she was probably coerced/manipulated, possibly even threatened. I don't know, but she was 12 and being influenced by an obviously unstable predator. So while I'll gladly call out a pussy pass when I see it, I just don't think this qualifies.   And imo, in this case, to say ""imagine if a 12 year old boy did that..."" is disingenuous. If there's another comparable case (12yr  old boy with a 24 yr old girlfriend that murdered his parents with the predator), then show it. But to take our legitimate grievance with the unfair ""pussy pass"" and project it onto a hypothetical rare and unique case is just silly and just provides more confirmation bias ""they're all just hateful misogynists lookin' for anything to whine about"" fodder for the naysayers."

In Canada, the onus is on the prosecution to demonstrate that there's a good reason (i.e. in the best interest of society) to try the offender as an adult, which typically means an extremely serious crime (e.g. murder, aggravated sexual assault, etc.) with a history of other violent offences.

Last summer Miss Edwards went to stay with her parents in Redditch, Worcestershire, and Ravenall agreed to look after Cuwella. Mr Sutton said Miss Edwards had phoned her friend every day to ask how her cat was and Ravenall told her it was ‘playing up’.  Miss Edwards then met up with Ravenall and they returned to the high-rise flat in the Stechford area of the city.  Miss Edwards told her friend she was considering taking the kitten to a sanctuary because she was unable to keep it and she wanted it to have a better home. Ravenall responded by hitting the animal and then throwing it into the hallway. Both then went into the hall where Ravenall picked up the cat again and pushed past Miss Edwards, going into the living room.   In a statement, Miss Edwards said: ‘It was miaowing. She walked to the living room window and just dropped Cuwella straight out of the window.’   When she asked Ravenall why she had done it, the defendant replied: ‘You did not want it anyway.’    Jesus fucking christ. That poor kitten.  Honest to god, if that was my cat, I probably would've thrown her right out that window after the cat in a fit of blind rage."

PussyPass,2hp1gd,I_Cum_Blood_666,1 point,Mon Sep 29 06:20:41 2014 UTC,So she gets a pussy pass for passing a pussy through a window?
PussyPass,2hp1gd,PrimesteFericera,1 point,Sun Sep 28 20:34:09 2014 UTC,"OK, I realize this is going to be down-voted to hell, but:  This bitch needs therapy or Jesus; not a trip to the Psychopath Learning Center for Gifted Abusers.   They should allow judges to sentence animal abusers to time in a psychiatric center under watch. While they're there professional doctors can evaluate their risk to society, and try and get their symptoms controlled before they kill someone.   Doctors are much better at determining the stability of a human being than a jury of twelve randomly selected citizens who don't know enough to get out of jury duty.   You send them to jail and all they learn is not to look at Big J's bitch or risk a shanking, or worse; they learn how to act so that you can't prove it the next time they pull this shit.  Throw this bitch in a the bin, not back home or prison."

PussyPass,2hp1gd,Element7AB,1 point,Mon Sep 29 03:57:18 2014 UTC,I love the arrow showing how it fell. As if couldn't figure that out from the title.
PussyPass,2hp1gd,pBeatz,1 point,Mon Sep 29 04:17:07 2014 UTC,Throw this bitch out an 11th floor window and see if she survives. If she does she can skip jail.
PussyPass,2hp1gd,IncipioMutatio,1 point,Mon Sep 29 14:10:00 2014 UTC,Give her some slack. She has the hardest job IN THE WORLD: She's a mother!!!
PussyPass,2hp1gd,pBeatz,1 point,Sun Oct 5 01:22:16 2014 UTC,... all that black lung sure is a bitch XD
PussyPass,2hp1gd,IncipioMutatio,0,Mon Sep 29 07:26:52 2014 UTC,Nice view from that window
PussyPass,2hp1gd,pBeatz,1 point,Mon Sep 29 07:54:02 2014 UTC,"Yeah. How do you just chuck a kitten out there with no thought? Also, was that the flat where her child lived? I'd be terrified of my kid accidentally crawling out and falling as well."
PussyPass,2hp1gd,pBeatz,-6,Sun Sep 28 20:56:56 2014 UTC,"inb4 ""pussy"" puns"
PussyPass,2hp1gd,IncipioMutatio,7,Sun Sep 28 21:07:05 2014 UTC,I think you're a few minutes late.
PussyPass,2hp1gd,pBeatz,-5,Sun Sep 28 17:54:27 2014 UTC,but im not
PussyPass,2hp1gd,IncipioMutatio,-8,Sun Sep 28 18:09:08 2014 UTC,"As weird and disturbing it is that she would do something like this, I really dont think she belongs in jail. Its a cat, guys."
PussyPass,2hp1gd,pBeatz,2,Sun Sep 28 18:14:04 2014 UTC,"And? It's a life. It feels pain and fear. Her actions showed a complete lack of empathy for life and a total disregard for the pain and suffering of another creature. A defenseless one at that. It's a direct window into this twats psyche and if this story doesn't give you any inkling as to what she's capable of and why that deserves more than a couple hours of community service and a ""bad girl"" slap from the magistrate that I seriously question your moral compass."
PussyPass,2hp1gd,IncipioMutatio,0,Sun Sep 28 22:06:52 2014 UTC,"Easy on that slippery slope there, guy."
PussyPass,2hp1gd,IncipioMutatio,2,Sun Sep 28 23:38:38 2014 UTC,"There's no slippery slope to what I said. None. She showed depraved indifference and maliciously killed a defenseless animal over ... what? A tantrum over the previous owner planning on giving the animal away so it could have a ""better home"". That displays to me that she is a person with absolutely zero empathy and is capable of a deplorable actions based on her obviously unbalanced and unstable mood at any given time.   She's a danger and should be dealt with as such."
PussyPass,2hp1gd,IndigoCup,2,Mon Sep 29 02:11:27 2014 UTC,"This argument again, two wrongs dont make a right, you cant just kill a defenseless creature for no reason, if i did that to her i get life, why is the cat different? How meat is treated is horrible, nobody could argue that. But that doesnt mean you can just murder every other creature because you want too. Have an ounce of fucking compassion like you would if the girl was the one who died, You fucking idiot."
PussyPass,2hp1gd,IndigoCup,-1,Mon Sep 29 07:20:44 2014 UTC,You honestly place the same amount of value on a kittens life that you do on a human life? Thats insanity.
PussyPass,2hp1gd,rpendleton18,2,Mon Sep 29 00:07:04 2014 UTC,"Ive had this argument 30 times on reddit. Yes, we are all animals, we are not higher beings, we are all disposable. *Obligatory situation pending, maybe a small childs life may take precedence if it came down to it, but an adult life is definitely equal."
PussyPass,2hp1gd,IndigoCup,2,Mon Sep 29 01:29:48 2014 UTC,Coming from n00f.
PussyPass,2hp1gd,rpendleton18,-1,Mon Sep 29 02:06:28 2014 UTC,"Wow that is really disturbing and you cant possibly live your life according to that belief. I ran over a frog the other day with my car, should I get sent to jail too?"
PussyPass,2hp1gd,IndigoCup,1 point,Mon Sep 29 02:21:30 2014 UTC,"Your retort is ridiculous and you know it. If you seriously aren't aware of how that is an entirely different thing than please never ever get a job in law enforcement, the public or private sector and please don't vote or breed."
PussyPass,2hp1gd,IndigoCup,1 point,Mon Sep 29 02:27:54 2014 UTC,If all animals are equal than its not ridiculous at all.
PussyPass,2hp1gd,Dustinfl,1 point,Mon Sep 29 02:28:55 2014 UTC,"So you're seriously that obtuse... ok.   It is ridiculous. It is incredibly ridiculous. Animals being equal has nothing to do with anything as you're presenting two entirely different scenarios.   The difference is that one is an accident(oops, I hit a frog) and the other is a deliberate act intended to cause suffering and death(Fuck you and your kitten, toss).   And we find the same scenario with humans so your ""if animals are equal ..."" cop out is just weak sauce mental gymnastics at best and deliberate dishonesty to prop up your lack of shits to give about  animals at worst.   Humans are all equal yet if you accidentally kill a person with your vehicle who ran out into the road or was pushed or fell into the street or perhaps you hit a patch of ice and careen uncontrollably into a pedestrian and crush them, it's vastly different from taking your car and deliberately running someone down and would be treated as such.   That's the difference and that's why your example is in fact, ridiculous."
