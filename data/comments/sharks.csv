sharks,3dxlmd,axelfoley12,23,Mon Jul 20 11:05:41 2015 UTC,That shark was no more than 2.5m.
sharks,3dxlmd,ricardo_lacombe,5,Mon Jul 20 12:29:14 2015 UTC,"Ok, but its caudal fin was at LEAST a metre long. It would be very out of proportion if the shark was 9ft long with a 3.5ft dorsal fin. I think it may have been a bit bigger."

I wouldn't base this on the still and a comparison of a guys back to show scientifically how large the fin was.  I watched the video and in my experience (and only mine - I'm not citing expertise here because I'm not, I have just filmed sharks for awhile, nothing more than that) - I watched the video and based on what I saw moving I say it's a juvenile and no more than 2.5m. Couple with that the notion that a shark of 5m+ would definitely have taken a nibble to investigate in my opinion."
sharks,3dxlmd,ricardo_lacombe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, you can't use the above image as a comparison, this is like shark week discovery all over again.... they are at different distances and angles, which can make a dramatic difference in actual size. Looking just at the shark's dorsal and caudal gives you a better idea of the size of the shark, and given that distance its a juvenile great white no doubt (maybe nearing adulthood, but a juvenile nonetheless)."

sharks,3dxlmd,CaptianBadKid,2,Mon Jul 20 14:33:47 2015 UTC,Exactly - it's the Caudal fin. It's the back end of the tail we are seeing. You can just tell from looking at the video the shark is nowhere near a 21footer. It's a juvenile for sure.

sharks,3dxlmd,czechm8e,4,Mon Jul 20 18:20:01 2015 UTC,What a load of fecking drivel. I like sharks and I'm not flipping out over killer sharks from mars but the shark was pretty clearly going for this 'seal' that he resembled at the top of the sea.
sharks,3dxlmd,washyourclothes,5,Mon Jul 20 17:57:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. The comments on this sub lately are enough to make me consider unsubscribing. Yea sharks are great and beautiful and a crucial part of our ecosystem and yea the media has often overblown their aggression and yea they are misunderstood but they are still predators that occasionally attack humans. Yea sometimes the attack is just the shark investigating or being curious, but what difference does that make to the human who is bitten? It's still an attack. Have some respect for these great predators. They are not just cute little fish. This is what I would describe as an attack. I have been in the ocean with sharks, sometimes while scuba diving, sometimes while surfing, etc. While I haven't been around great whites as far as I know, a curious or investigative shark would swim under or around a human, this video clearly shows the animal attempting a strike. It lunged at Mick Fanning, thrashed about, etc. Yea yea the shark is investigating the surfer but it is trying to take a bite and ends up thrashing about, smacking him in the head, etc. To describe what we see in the video as an attack is not sensational, but to downplay it is just disrespectful of both the surfer and the shark. I doubt many people in this sub have actually come in close contact with sharks. I have. Most of the time they leave you alone. They aren't mindless eating machines like the media says. They don't seek out humans to prey upon. But they do mistake humans for food and when they do, they attack. If a lion mistakes you for prey and comes over to take an investigative bite/swipe at you with its claws, is that a lion attack? Or just a stupid curious lion coming over to say hi..? A lot of people in this sub need to get real and understand that their cute naive perspective about these predators is a bit skewed. I'm not saying that the media and the world in general have a better perspective. I understand that their portrayal of sharks as viscous monsters is often extreme and endangers the lives of thousands/millions of sharks. But get real people. A 20ft great white shark is a monster. To call it that is giving it the full respect that it deserves. That doesn't mean we should go culling them all. It just means that under the right circumstances that giant predator would come out of nowhere and fucking eat you. That's a monster. This is a video of a shark attack. Get over yourselves."
sharks,3dxlmd,ricardo_lacombe,5,Mon Jul 20 18:37:24 2015 UTC,"I have been around Great Whites and this does not look like an attack at all.  Study of shark incidents (not attacks) actually show little evidence of the mistaken identity seal shape theory. The behaviour is often nothing like an actual predatory attack but more confusion in the surf zone. Sharks (especially Great White Sharks) will often investigate on anything....a piece of kelp, a board, a piece of wood, a penguin, a flipper.... Anything at all. What a lot of incidents show us is that the vast majority of time it's nothing like an attack. This video of this incident is classic of that. Shark investigates. Gets caught on rope. Thrashing is confusion and panic.... Not an attack. Not a bite.  And I have indeed been around great whites and have seen this several times.  A good source for excellent coverage of this ""mistaken identity"" theory proving unfounded in reality against documented incidents is Dirk Schmidt's second book ""White Sharks: Magnificent, Mysterious and Misunderstood""."
sharks,3dxlmd,5b3ll,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"Yea sometimes the attack is just the shark investigating or being curious, but what difference does that make to the human who is bitten?   It makes a difference because it puts the calls to cull in perspective. It isn't right to cull and animal because it made a mistake, whereas some would see a deliberate targeting of humans as reason to cull."
sharks,3dxlmd,Smellzlikefish,0,Mon Jul 20 22:01:26 2015 UTC,"He wasn't bitten or even mildly injured.  The shark got close to this guy, but that wasn't an attack.  If I counted each close call as an attack, I would probably hold some sort of Guinness World Record."
sharks,3dxlmd,czechm8e,2,Tue Jul 21 05:40:41 2015 UTC,"So what? The shark lunged at him and tried to chew his board, this is an attack and you are being ridiculous. I don't care about your anecdotes about how much of a badass shark survivor you are, the state of your injuries does not define an 'attack' or not."
sharks,3dxlmd,Smellzlikefish,0,Tue Jul 21 07:23:22 2015 UTC,"Define: ""Attack""-to take aggressive action against with weapons or armed force.  Alternatively, an aggressive or violent action against a person or place.  There was no violence nor actions with armed force or weapons, apart from Fanning's flailing.  The shark never touched him."
sharks,3dxlmd,czechm8e,2,Tue Jul 21 07:30:54 2015 UTC,"So an animal never attacks another animal because 'it has no weapons'?   There was no violence   Yeah never mind chewing on his surfboard let's just pretend there was no attack here. How about instead of listening to your semantic bullshit I just take ISAF curator George Burgess' word for it:   Some people are speculating if this was even an attack at all, or more of an âencounter,â since Mick was never bitten or wounded whatsoever. Can you confirm or deny?  Well, it is indeed an attack, as you suggest. By all appearances, it was a situation where a White shark was coming up for an investigation of the situation. The fact that there was no bite suggests that the animal was simply there to check it out, to see what was going on. Whether the shark simply decided ânot for meâ and avoided its attack, or the shark was simply giving it a quick look to see what it was up there, we will never know.  We canât get into the heads of these things. But what we can say that from the International Shark Attack Fileâs view, because contact was in fact made â minimally, with the board â it will go in as an official attack. Even though, in this case, the reality was no actual contact with the human...  Letâs just agree that shit got real â a physical altercation between man and shark â therefore an attack.  Oh, definitely, from our standpoint, the fact that it cut the leash technically makes it an automatic shark attack, because it made contact thoroughly with an object that was a part of the human. The other part, of course, was his activity of swinging back and forth. That was smart. We advise to demonstrate some power and size back at the animal.  Whether it was anything more than a mosquito buzzing around-sort of thing, or his activities really startled the animal, we canât be sure. But clearly, it got mixed up in the leash and caused some concern."

The best way to tell a shark is by its fins, usually. The caudal fin looks about right, and it looks as if the anal, second dorsal, and pelvic fins seem to match that of a bull shark. Interesting find, looks like you were shore fishing. Bull sharks are by and large the most aggressive sharks so it doesn't spell well that you caught one from the shore.

sharks,3dj7q4,StonerJack,6,Fri Jul 17 18:22:46 2015 UTC,Awesome! I went cage diving in Gansbaai in 2011! Spent about 25 minutes in the water. Biggest GW I met was about 4.5 meters long. Got to experience him coming right at me jaws open too. It was one of the greatest experiences of my life.
sharks,3dj7q4,TerrySchiavo20,3,Fri Jul 17 06:40:18 2015 UTC,He just wanted a hug.
sharks,3dj7q4,paradism720,2,Thu Jul 16 21:45:44 2015 UTC,All he (she?) wanted to do was free the humans from the cage. Nobody likes being in captivity.
sharks,3di1z1,das38,2,Thu Jul 16 13:11:37 2015 UTC,"Tough to say, but definitely not a silky.  Silkies have smaller dorsal fins in relation to their body.  If I had to guess, it could be an Atlantic sharpnose (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae)."
sharks,3di1z1,Smellzlikefish,2,Thu Jul 16 19:39:22 2015 UTC,Definitely not a thresher. Sharpnose or maybe a finetooth?

sharks,3di1z1,aLonelyClone,0,Thu Jul 16 14:22:40 2015 UTC,Came here to say silky shark. Glad someone beat me to it.
sharks,3di1z1,bschlapkohl,0,Thu Jul 16 16:38:04 2015 UTC,"the tail kind of makes me think Thresher, but I'm no expert."
sharks,3dh0tz,Panzer5005,8,Thu Jul 16 05:11:53 2015 UTC,"Glad they released the shark. But I freaken hate it when they leave sharkies on the beach so long to pose for photos, poor thing is suffocating.  That being said. like my surfer friend from Cape Town said. You have no idea how many sharks swim around you without you even knowing it, protected and unprotected beaches. Chances are VERY good that you have been within meters from a shark on numerous occasions and did not even know it!!!"
sharks,3dh0tz,Hoenderboude,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yea we had no idea what the guy was doing. He was visibly frustrated by the crowd but tagged it and got him back in the water.   Scary part is I think you are right. That guy came running down the beach with his line passing over my head shouting ""get out, there's a 6 ft shark on the line!"""

sharks,3df9oe,ProbablyNotAGoodSign,2,Wed Jul 15 20:30:05 2015 UTC,for those who watched Sharkweek. Shark Planet was adapted from this.
sharks,3df9oe,akornblatt,2,Wed Jul 15 21:31:16 2015 UTC,Yep. Shark Planet was basically the abridged U.S. version of it. There's about an extra hour of footage in the BBC version.
