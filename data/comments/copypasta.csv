In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini, is the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it's a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible because it wasn't that long ago that I was in a little Lamborghini sleeping on bookshelves in the Hollywood Hills with only forty seven billion dollars in my bank account, and forty seven Lamborghinis in my Lamborghini account, and only forty seven hills in my Hollywood account, and only forty seven Tedx Talks where I talk about Warren Buffets in my Tedx Talks where I talk about Warren Buffet account.   But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a Lamborghini, and another Lamborghini, and a few more Lamborghinis. I found five Lamborghinis. I don't call it money anymore I call it fuel units. You must have enough units. You must have enough Lamborghinis. You must CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS.  I'll see you on my website.

copypasta,3dn1w5,Rosenkrantz_,2,Sat Jul 18 04:49:32 2015 UTC,"From the same thread, copypasta gold:   Excuse me but are you a meme hater? Let me preface this by saying that I've been a memer since they first appeared on 4chan circa 2006 (ages ago in internet time). I remember refreshing /b/ all afternoon with the hope that someone would make a new meme. I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on livememe and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny. Do you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them. In fact, you've never even submitted to /r/adviceanimals. So please, respect my judgement regarding the direction of the subreddit and the integrity of posts I have held dear to my heart for nearly 7 years but you have no strong feelings for.    I'm trying to be as civil as possible amidst a subreddit invasion, the likes of which you are unlikely to have ever seen. We have 43 subscribers subscribers and provocations like this tend to spread to the major griefer subreddits and cause extreme problems that at times, have escalated to reddit admins with discussions with about contacting the FBI due to reddit global denial of service attacks. The unserious attitude of your junior mods isn't helping, and they continue to pelt me with off-topic banter about movies and TV even within the last 20 minutes, a day later. Our own moderators have a policy to conduct all internal discussions on a separate thread from a modmail user complaint, so only specifically relevant, targeted messages reach outside redditors. So I'd appreciate it if your mods would cut me off their discussion thread, now that you have taken action.  I would like you to understand what's going on here. I'm not some young kid drunk on power as a moderator who is flying off the handle. I'm 54 years old and i've been moderating forums since the early 1980's. I have seen it all before. Our subreddit gets a lot of shit, and yes, there are a lot of young, inexperienced, socially maladapted kids who complain about memes. It's our mission to help them and educate them about memes, verticals, and such, to help them adopt more healthy attitudes (about memes specifically). But we can't do that when outside subreddits are intentionally making a hostile environment, where people can't discuss their penguin or duck memes openly or honestly. The post that got attacked by your users was a young kid, trying to find his way in the AdviceAnimals world, and honestly admitting he screwed up. His message was an example for others, to help them avoid similar screwups. These attacks from your subreddit singled him out, which has a chilling effect on other users who now see how hostile the environment can be when someone speaks openly about their memes. So when a user like you singles out an individual for ridicule, and incites other groups like /r/AntiMeme to engage with it, it draws in the most notorious griefers on reddit, like /r/ShitRedditSays and worse. The collateral damage includes attacks on almost all other current threads, which takes days to moderate and calm down. Sometimes it even attracts determined griefers who become permanent problems. IMHO, there is a big difference between posts that deliberately incite trouble in a top 20 subreddit like ours, and poking fun at an obscure subreddit like /r/RandomActsOfBlowJob. Since this has been a repeated problem, and it seems like certain users are constantly scanning /r/AdviceAnimals for material to hate on, I would greatly appreciate if you could look more closely at these posts and in the future, try to understand the meme. Consider this problem might be representative of a bad tendency of yours, provoked by minority bullies that you would like to eliminate just as much as we do.  Thanks."

Anyone with an ounce of understanding about how the US govt works and the current US political climate will understand he's making promises that are impossible to keep.  It's same shit Obama pulled with his ""Hope & Change"". He stood by pretty much none of his campaign promises, ended up being almost the opposite of what people wanted, those promises he did fulfill were weak bastardizations of what they were supposed to be (see: Healthcare).  Then Obama apologists rally behind him and say ""it's not his fault. Mean ole congress won't let him do anything"". Congress is the body elected to make laws and pres is the executive to sign off on laws.  People overestimate the role of the president in the US government, so someone can come up and say ""vote for me and you'll get free blowjobs and donuts!"". Idiots vote for him, he asks congress, congress says ""no. No BJs & donuts. Are you retarded?"", and then he's like ""oh well I tried. It's congress's fault""  In reality he knew he could never make good on the promise of BJs and donuts, but he still made the promises because no one really understands simple fucking concepts about how the US government works, and they'll believe a candidate will give them anything they want if it gets them to vote for them.  Unless you have a far left leaning congress (you don't. Not even close), Sanders is just going to sit playing with his wrinkled old dick while none of his campaign promises are met. In 4 years he'll be out and the process will start over again.  If you believed Obama's ""Hope & Change"" bullshit, you were an idiot that fell for nothing but a good marketing campaign (it's hilarious how well that worked on the foreign audience. Obama's camp won awards for how well they marketed their product.)  If you're dumb enough to fall for almost the exact same thing but doubled down with even more unlikely promises from Bernie Sanders, you deserve to be taken out back and shot for the good of the human race."

copypasta,3df6jd,mintrolling,3,Wed Jul 15 20:07:58 2015 UTC,This guy is pretty butthurt
copypasta,3df6jd,Jca1,3,Wed Jul 15 21:18:21 2015 UTC,"Butthurt is such a fucked up way to describe a person who just got fucked over. Would you call someone who just got shot in the face butthurt? Because its the same thing as you are doing by calling them butthurt.  The only people in the world who use the word ""butthurt"" are the people who DO take advantage of these situations. Its what people who require an unfair advantage in things do when they get thrown under the bus.  I was called that once in clan wars. They had a guy spend what had to be thousands of dollars upgrading his base from max TH9 to max TH10. Walls, heros, all extra buildings all were upgraded during war prep. As a member of a clan that only spends money while out of war, this pissed me off. So I wrote ""Pay 2 Win"" as our clan description. They retaliated with ""don't be butthurt."" They won by 1 star.  In conclusion, every single person who has ever said butthurt at somebody is a terrible person in real life."

You must literally be sat there waiting for me to respond, just so you can make yourself look like you're shitting all over me, but you're not. Anyone who reads this thread can see how fucking retarded you are. All you do is sit here, type shit, and then you think you're fucking great. I just told you, I will beat you the fuck up. In the ring. Where do you live? You thick fuck, I'll skullfuck your sister."
