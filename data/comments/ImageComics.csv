Also, each of the main characters look a lot like they do in the comic, which, seems eerie.   Parents get Cinemax so I guess I'll end up watching it there, but I didn't realize it was Cinemax that picked this up, I fear that's going to limit it's reach quite a bit."

I guess it's just the first comic I've bought off the shelf that's turned into a tv show, and I did my (extremely) small part to help make that happen. We did it!"

Its like they haven't really got behind it. They just bought the rights because of The Walking Dead's fame and they have put very little money behind it just to see how  much interest there will be. It looks like a fan film or one of the countless shitty cheapo horror films that come out all the time. Ill watch it when it comes out and I hope it will be good but i really don't like what i see so far. I really hope its great but im very sceptical at this point. Also its Fox so will we really see the violent scenes like when he is punching fuck out of the kid or when that dude bites the chicks tongue out? I wouldn't say there is a lot of blood in this book but it will be really shit if they cut around it and don't show anything."
ImageComics,3e066m,Blintx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:08:36 2015 UTC,"I think it is going to be on cinemax and  if it is anything like banshee, its going to be good. Also I don't think it is going to be air until 2016."

My method usually entails buying the first issue and if I like it, waiting for the trade. Then, if I really like the series, I'll buy the HCs. Waiting helps slow things down a bit for me."

ImageComics,3dutgl,kyletj1031,13,Sun Jul 19 18:11:31 2015 UTC,"Image Comics isn't really an universe like Marvel or DC, its creator owned content, and only a few titles cross over with each other.  Where to start? Look at their website, check what looks cool and go read it.   Some advice? Saga, East of West, Lazarus, Autumnlands, Deadly Class, Low. And a lot more, don't even know where to stop. But my real advice? Just pick up what you think looks neat."
ImageComics,3dutgl,ShinCoal,4,Sun Jul 19 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"That's what i really like about Image and smaller publishers, reading 1 series doesn't force you to read 2-3 others."
ImageComics,3dutgl,the_one_true_b,4,Sun Jul 19 22:59:53 2015 UTC,"Yea, if you post your general interests then we might be able to better recommend stuff. I think the easiest way to get an idea of where to begin might be by checking the solicits:  https://imagecomics.com/content/view/image-comics-solicitations-for-october-2015  If anything sounds interesting check out the synopsis for the first issue.   Then Google the previous months solicitations and repeat. You'll eventually work back maybe 5 months and see most of the current running stuff and have a better idea of what kind of diversity Image offers. This is mostly what I did anyway.   Some of my favorites: Saga, Copperhead, Southern Bastards, Descender, Drifter, Postal, Invisible Republic, The Tithe, Wytches, and Lazarus. In no particular order."
ImageComics,3dutgl,Selykg,4,Sun Jul 19 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"Saga, East of West, Drifter, Chew, Sex Criminals, The Wicked + The Divine"
ImageComics,3dutgl,Bonedeath,2,Sun Jul 19 19:41:58 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add Revival, Ghosted and Walking Dead to that list. Great books."
ImageComics,3dutgl,Fiend1138,2,Mon Jul 20 06:37:48 2015 UTC,"There are my favorites in order. wayward, Chrononauts, Birthright, rasputin (used to rank higher but I'm not sure about the new story arc), saga, sex criminals, wicked and divine."
ImageComics,3dutgl,jicty,3,Sun Jul 19 21:24:20 2015 UTC,"First off read Saga. it's the best ongoing comic right now and it's amazing.   humor:   Chew: An Agent for the FDA has a physic connection to whatever he eats. If he eats a steak he knows how it was cooked who cooked it and the conditions of the farm it was raised on.  Sex Criminals: every time the main character reaches orgasm she stops time. extremely sexual and extremely funny. Rat Queens: Fantasy story about 4 female friends that go on quests together. the dialogue is amazing in this one.  Scifi:  Black Science: A group of anarchist scientists make a machine that takes you to different dimensions and something goes wrong and now it is randomly taking them to different dimensions.  Low Its in the deep future and mankind has gone undersea to hide from the radiation on the surface. No one has been to the surface in known history and now they are running out of air. the art is amazing in this.   Manhattan Projects: it's ww2 times and all the best physicists are making crazy awesome scifi weapons.  Horror/thriller:  Revival: the dead come back to life in this small humble town but they aren't zombies. they have all there memories and seem to be completely normal or are they? Outcast: This one is all about possession and demons. The story is pretty slow right now but it's on track to really build up to something crazy. Nameless: this one isn't for everyone but if you like Grant Morrison's style then look no further. I love this comic and fallow it very closely  and will chew up your consciousness and spit it out into space.  other:  Deadly Class: This is my favorite comic of all time. It's the late 80's and our main character is struggling on the streets as a 15 year old kid who has lost everything until he is recruited into a secret assassin school that trains the worlds greatest and most powerful killers. The art is original and expressive, the coloring sets the mood for every page you read, I think it has the best paneling of any comic I have ever read, and the writing is supper relatable and personnel to the writer.  Wayward: Anime meets comics and it really pulls it off great. Art on this one is pretty amazing and I hope the story goes on for a long time. One of those worlds where you could get a ton of awesome content from."

Those should keep you busy until Compendium 3 is released in October, and it's available for preorder.  then start picking up the single issues every month so they'll be ready when you've finished C3.  Everyone else has already mentioned several good titles, but the ones I'm ready right now, other than TWD, are Saga, Manifest Destiny, Lil Depressed Boy, Empty and Southern Bastards.  They very literally come out with new series every week so you can get started on new titles all the time."

ImageComics,3dutgl,raikonai,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:55:50 2015 UTC,"Saga, Low, Sex Criminals, Black Science... there are a lot. Depends on what you're into. My personal advice is to go on comixology, or your LCS and pick up the first issue of any series that looks good to figure out what you like. You can't really go wrong with anything by Jonathan Hickman or Rick Remender imo"
ImageComics,3dutgl,georgeharrisun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:28:05 2015 UTC,"almost every image title atm is just gold. Im yet to find something i don't like. That being said you can see from the comments here that some titles are more popular. I would say go on amazon or your local store and grad the first trade of saga, deadly class etc."
ImageComics,3dutgl,5hif7y,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:59 2015 UTC,"I would direct any comic book lover who is new to Image to start with Invincible. Just bite the bullet and get the Vol. 1 compendium. I found one on Amazon for about 40 bucks. It collects the first 9 volumes of the series.   It's an amazing superhero comic with actual continuity. From Robert Kirkman, author of The Walking Dead...but this book is loaded with color."
ImageComics,3dutgl,isaacsploding,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:12:08 2015 UTC,"Rat Queens, Sex Criminals  and Saga are all amazing. Get the collected issues.....definitely the best way to do it."

ImageComics,3dutgl,StupidBroats,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:28:35 2015 UTC,Well the 3 titles that guy recommended are pretty expensive in single issue format. For a new reader I think getting tpb to check them out is a good way to start.

ImageComics,3dwd0h,analogphototaker,2,Mon Jul 20 02:10:04 2015 UTC,I haven't read the other but I love Ghosted. The first issue is kind of heist like but the next issue are more the main character being dragged into first related situations. It's a really fun read. I actually just picked up vol 4 today.
ImageComics,3dtxvz,definetlymaybe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:57:53 2015 UTC,"The short answer is yes, they will be releasing further volumes of the Omnivore Editions. The Omnivore Editions typically collect two TPB's, for example 4th volume collects TPB Vols. 7 and 8. Since the 10th TPB hasn't been released yet, they haven't announced the 5th omnivore.

The original 1000 didn't fly because they had characters they didn't own on them, so those are some of the ones that were given out at random places. Zdarsky and Fraction each did another 500 separately from one another and I think THOSE are what is coming out this week, maybe."

ImageComics,3dflce,dookie1481,2,Thu Jul 16 06:27:06 2015 UTC,I would have had negative or ambivalent things to say about it after issue 2 but now with issue 3 out things are starting to take shape.  We are starting to learn more about the nature of the Injection and the identity of the people who created it.  We haven't gotten to their mission yet but we are getting there.

As for the writing...it's self-indulgent. Ellis is clearly writing about ideas that he likes but it's taken 3 issues to get an inkling of what those ideas are.   If you can find all 3 issues currently out I'd definitely try it, but you need all 3 I think, or wait for the trade to really see what it's like."

ImageComics,3dbhzf,TehSonicWombat,2,Wed Jul 15 13:23:14 2015 UTC,"It's beyond rad, and has arguably the best art of any image comic, or any comic for that matter, but that is because the creator doesn't draw comics for a living and does graphic design for videogames I think. Because of that the comic isn't his first priority so he takes an extremely long time with each issue, there's only been 2 released so far with a 4 year gap in between . HIGHLY recommend tho"

ImageComics,3dax5l,MattMur,3,Tue Jul 14 22:49:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But that was why Image was so cool at the time. Everything else was über story driven to the detriment of art.  Image put the art out front instead of writing. Not surprising considering who founded.  The old books don't stand up great, but the art is still awesome. It's hard to overstate how radical they were in the 90s. But it was a way different company then."

ImageComics,3dax5l,bosco10382,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:11:51 2015 UTC,How familiar are you with Spawn? I was a superfan of the HBO series before ever buying a comic and I think that made me a lot more forgiving of the initial story arcs.  I've been working my way through Spawn via the collection trades (they're gorgeous) and the story is mediocre at points while the art stays very nice. If you're a fan of the character you might forgive a less gripping story otherwise I'm thinking just pick up recommended arcs.  edits: I can't type on my phone

ImageComics,3dax5l,Subject2Change,2,Wed Jul 15 02:07:55 2015 UTC,"IMDB Link  Loved it at the time but the animation doesn't really hold up compared to today. The plot lines are pretty good with a nice mix of depressing or just plain sad.   Expect typical HBO stuff like nudity, drug use etc."
ImageComics,3dax5l,browses_on_the_bus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:16:49 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'll have to check it out. Thanks!

ImageComics,3dax5l,BatsArentBugs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think so. I picked it up again (after many many years away, I think my last regular issue was when it was in the 60's) with the special Spawn: Resurrection #1 issue, and have continued with the ongoing series since."
ImageComics,3dax5l,MattAlbie60,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:41:32 2015 UTC,"My knowledge of Spawn basically stems from reading #1 maybe twice in my life and also the HBO animated series, which I haven't watched probably since it came out on VHS.   I jumped on with ""Spawn: Resurrection"" and have been reading ever since and I'm liking it. It's not my favorite thing that I read all month or anything, but I do look forward to it. It's a lot... ""quieter,"" so far, that I assumed something like Spawn would be, to be honest. It's more introspective. I like it, regardless."
ImageComics,3dax5l,pace122004,-6,Sat Jul 18 12:32:30 2015 UTC,"Poor people hate spawn, that's been my perspective. I'm not sure if its the longest running story ever, people on this sub can correct me if its not, I've always liked spawn but only recently started collecting. For me its more about nostalgia, it takes me back to a better time."
ImageComics,3dax5l,JumalOnSurnud,6,Tue Jul 14 21:54:25 2015 UTC,"What does being poor have to do with liking Spawn?  Edit - Also, Dave Sim wrote and drew Cerebus for 300 issues from 1977 to 2004, I believe that's the longest from a single creator.  And Judge Dredd has been going on in real time since 1977 (he ages in real time, no reboots), primarily written by John Wagner."

I also am intrigued by the human playing the role of ""savage"" while the ""animals"" are taken aback by his willingness to use violence, even when it benefits them; it reminds me of Planet of the Apes in that way. I'm definitely going to keep reading."

ImageComics,3cyflu,Baby_Cum_Angels,3,Sat Jul 11 22:29:19 2015 UTC,I am fairly new to comic books and have decided to make a review hobby out of me learning more about comics as I go along. This is my first actual review.
ImageComics,3cyflu,joerdie,3,Sun Jul 12 00:08:35 2015 UTC,I respect your opinion but couldn't agree less with your review. I thought the art was awkward and the posing didn't feel right. The story was a great idea but it was carried out in such a way that I was bored out of my mind the entire book.
ImageComics,3cyflu,joerdie,3,Sun Jul 12 15:19:13 2015 UTC,"Hey that's what opinions are all about! No offence taken here. Some people like Vanilla some people like Chocolate I appreciate the feedback!   As my project is me being very new to comics my opinion could very well change as I become more versed on different stories. At the moment I am pretty much limited to Saga, The Walking Dead, Locke and Key, We Stand On Guard, and a handful of more recent Marvel stories."
ImageComics,3cyflu,kw1nn,2,Sun Jul 12 15:23:43 2015 UTC,"I am glad you are not offended.   I find that it's hard to compare most comics to TWD, the current Cupulo/Snider run of Batman, and Saga as they are, IMHO the best runs in the last two decades."
ImageComics,3cyflu,joerdie,2,Sun Jul 12 15:38:55 2015 UTC,Oh! I have also read Court of Owls. I ordered City of Owls on Amazon but it came damaged so awaiting the replacement. Should be here tomorrow actually.
ImageComics,3cyflu,XPostLinker,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"I think what you said is true about it being slightly boring, however I think it laid a good foundation for the series. Has the potential to rebound."

ImageComics,3cv1qt,underelectriclight,3,Sat Jul 11 04:17:00 2015 UTC,W+D is one of my favorites right now! I picked it up on a whim and have been eagerly anticipating it each month.
ImageComics,3cv1qt,deviousgiant,2,Sat Jul 11 04:18:39 2015 UTC,"Wicked + Divine is currently my favorite comic book, tied with Airboy."
ImageComics,3cv1qt,KidAstronaut,4,Wed Jul 15 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"Those are all great series and other posters have already said my thoughts on them. The only difference being that while I like TWD, I am kind of getting burned out on it.  For recommendations, there's so many I read! Off the top of my head I would say (I'll try to summarize them all in two sentences or less):   Chew - An Image fan favorite. Highly recommended. Manifest Destiny - I love this series as well. It involves Lewis and Clark's journey with supernatural elements. The series is unsettling to read in a good way. Birthright - Starts out as the classic fantasy hero tale...then we are hit with a major twist. Lazuras - A dystopian future where ruling families assign a person as their property protectors (i.e. they kill anyone they say). Revival - A crime noir about a small Wisconsin town that one day has some of the dead come back to life (As people, not zombies.) Postal - A town of populated with only ex-convicts where the story is told through the POV of the mayors son with Asperger. Shutter - A really popular series where I'm at. It's hard to describe this one. An adventure series where a young woman is trying to unravel family secrets. Morning Glories - this one I'm still reading. It's compared to Lost in that there are a ton of new twists but little explanation. I am very much enjoying the ride and read many of the authors other works. He assures us that the story is all planned out. Wayward - A nice West meets East series as a girl goes to Japan to to learn her family's demon slaying ways. Often compared to Buffy.   Okay, so it was harder than I thought to short summarize these series without thinking ahead. Let me know if something isn't clear. I also think some of these series first issues are free right now on Comixology for SDCC."

East of West was slow for me so I only picked up the first volume. The Walking Dead was something I wanted to like, but became a chore for me to read so I dropped it.  I know it's not an Image comic, but Afterlife with Archie is a better walking dead story then The Walking Dead (in my opinion) and you should see if it's something you'd like. It looks like you enjoy horror so another (non Image) comic you might want is Rachel Rising or (Image comic) Revival."

ImageComics,3cv1qt,cuttups,3,Sat Jul 11 01:36:47 2015 UTC,"I've also been reading Sex Criminals and enjoying it and out of the ones you're looking at buying, I've read...   East of West (fully caught up): Amazing series, this is second to one series you haven't mentioned yet imo (will say which later). The Walking Dead (on TPB 6): Really good, if you've seen the show just imagine that but it doesn't become terrible quickly. NOTE: TWD comics are in black & white, might not matter but some people don't like this. Wytches: Have read the first TPB and it seems like a very promising series, can't say I find it really great yet though.   Now for ones you haven't mentioned (also the one I mentioned above),   My favourite comic series at the moment, Chew!. I picked up the first TPB of this series and did nothing for the next few days but catch up on everything that was out. This series is definitely one you should put on that list. I feel this one is on par with East of West too, Lazarus. Only 3 TPB out at the moment and a HC if you'd prefer. This series is brilliant and got especially interesting to me with the latest volume, now in my top 3.   I still haven't actually read Saga but I've heard so many good things about it, I've always got catching up to do with other series! Will have to try that out soon."
ImageComics,3cv1qt,ArnoldoBassisti,2,Sat Jul 11 01:27:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the input! TWD being in B&W may not be a deal-breaker for me, but it's good to know, because I was going to order the first two compendiums and pre-order the third, now I'm just going to get the first and give it a try.  As for Chew and Lazarus, they are comics that I've been thinking about picking up, but they were lower on the list, maybe I'll pick them up instead of the later two TWD compendiums. You've been a lot of help, thanks a lot!"

ImageComics,3cv1qt,KidAstronaut,2,Mon Jul 13 02:23:21 2015 UTC,"Descender is great and so is Southern Bastards.  I couldn't get into Wytches, it just left me cold and I don't like the use of paint splatter in the art.  East of West is fascinating, but I'm behind.  I really like Death being a pissed off cowboy.  The Walking Dead is great until it isn't.  You see the plot structure after a while, and it makes a surprising book seem banal.  Outside of your list, are you looking into Image superheroes at all?  Invincible is a perennial favorite, and up until around issue 100 it's stellar.  Ultraviolence, interesting teen drama (and you get to watch the main character really grow up!), and a lot of heart.  I would also recommend Paul Grist's Jack Staff.  Here's a lengthy recommendation."
ImageComics,3cv1qt,BigusBeatle,2,Sat Jul 11 05:44:35 2015 UTC,"Low is incredible. I cry at the end of some issues. The emotional level is peak.  The Walking Dead is one of the most consistent, best series of all time. If you love the show, then you need to catch up to the comic, because the places it is being taken right now are down right out of this world insanely entertaining, frustrating, and exciting  On a similar note, read Invincible  by Robert Kirkman, creator of Walking Dead. It was my first superhero comic and my favorite comic of all time. Coolest shit ever  Wytches scares the shit out of me like no media has done in a long, long time. I've gotten emotional over this one, too. It puts real personal fear into your heart.  Southern Basterds is one I was late to, but it really is incredible. Especially if you know nothing about football as I do.  I'd also recommend Deadly Class for just being one of the coolest things ever created. By Rick Remender who does Low.  Also Bitch Planet by Kelsey Sue DeConnick is not one to be passed over.  Descender was fun for the one issue I read. East of West of course is brilliant, but not on my current list.  Hope this helps!"

ImageComics,3cv1qt,themadera,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:16:18 2015 UTC,"Chew, East of West, and Revival have been mentioned.  Those are two of my absolute favorites.  But if you wanna go deep, try and find Fell, by Warren Ellis & Ben Templesmith.  Came out a while back and there's only 9 issues because, as I understand it, the issues were released very intermittently toward the end of the run, and Image didn't want to release any more until they had a full run of them to release regularly.  Unfortunately Warren Ellis' hard drive crashed and he lost a whole lot of the scripts to his books, including Fell.  As a result, Fell has yet to be picked back up by the two.  At least that's how I heard the story of how its production was ceased.  Fell is my absolute favorite series.  It's about a detective who is reassigned to a rough part of the city and each issue is basically like a procedural with a new crime he's solving.  It's very gritty, darkly humorous, and very very good.  Has a Se7en vibe to it, if you liked that movie.  I'm a filmmaker and I'm dying to make a Fell fan film.  One day, I suppose.  Other great Image stuff (Image is my favorite, they just speak to me)  Deadly Class - About an underground school for kids who are being trained to be deadly assassins.  It's like an 80's teen flick, but their education is on how to kill people.  It's very good and one of my current favorites.  Fatale - If you dig film noir type stuff, and if you dig occult type stuff, you'll love Fatale.  Brubaker and Phillips have a cadre of different series that are all great, but Fatale is my favorite.  It's about an immortal woman who has the power to make men fall in love with her and do whatever she wants them to, and about the men who go to great lengths to protect her from the cult that has been tracking her down her whole life.  Happy - A 4 issue series that can be found in trade form, by Grant Morrison and Darick Robertson.  Tells the story of an ex-crooked cop turned mafia hitman who is on his last legs and has been tasked with finding a child-killer by her imaginary friend, Happy, a small flying blue unicorn, who becomes his partner in the hunt to save her and stop the killer.  It sounds silly, and it is, but it's also dark, violent, gritty, humorous, and just really fucking good.  Nowhere Men - It's a wordy one, mostly because it's unlike most comics you're used to reading.  Definitely a unique one about a world where science has become to pop culture what music is in today's world. Tells a story of 4 scientists who changed the world, then grew apart in older years, and how they are each struggling against one another, for the most part, to achieve their goals.  Along the way there's a secret space mission that goes awry and the inhabitants of the station involved develop different characteristics and essentially become superhero-esque, not unlike the Fantastic 4.  It's very different, and unfortunately, very short.  There hasn't been new issues in a long while and no sign of new issues coming soon.  Peter Panzerfaust - It's the story of Peter Pan, but instead of it being set in Neverland where happy thoughts make you fly and Captain Hook is a wily pirate trying to thwart Peter and the Lost Boys, it's set in Nazi occupied France in WW2.  Peter is the leader of a resistance, the Lost Boys are his soldiers, and Captain Hook is a high ranking officer in the SS.  It's a truly unique take on the story and it's fantastic.    Rat Queens - Rat Queens is the shit.  A fantasy tale set in a town where different bounty hunter factions are hired out by the town to take care of unsightly business, and our heroines are a group of women known as the Rat Queens.  It's a LOTR style fantasy world with magic, witches, elves, warriors, etc.  I love it. It's one of the few comics that make me legitimately LOL (Sex Criminals is the other, but you got that one already)  Ten Grand - J. Michael Straczynski's first series under his Joe's Comics imprint, 12 issue run.  He says the point of Joe's comics is to create short run series that are great, and end them before they get dragged out and dull.  Basically if a series lasts too long it's eventually gonna crumble under it's own weight, and his goal is to make series with a beginning and an end and make sure it's excellent in between. It's somewhat complicated to tell off the top of my head, so I'll just direct you to the Image page itself with the description, just know that it's very awesome.  Ben Templesmith draws the first half of the run where it's set in the gritty real world, but eventually the protagonist makes his way into the afterlife, where a shift in the art is done by C.P. Smith to a more surreal style befitting of the afterlife.  It's very cool.  Those are my suggestions.  I love Image, their stuff just gets me.  Hope you try one of those out and you dig 'em!"

ImageComics,3cv1qt,Barnes_the_Noble,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:56:06 2015 UTC,"East of West may be my favorite current series. It's definitely a slow burn but it's definitely worth it (as my favorite image titles tend to be).  It certainly isn't an easy in and out comic. Immersion in the world is what makes it great though.   Wytches is also great and just wrapped up the first arc at issue 6. It would actually be a great ending in general so if you end up hating it you have a great stopping point that wouldn't really leave you wondering.   A general recommendation would be Copperhead. It's a bit of the traditional sci-fi western so if you are a firefly fan or western fan in general, I would really recommend giving it a try.   I've also been enjoying Trees. It's a little strange and is also relatively slow. But it follows a couple of stories which makes it feel like it's moving a little faster.   Zero just ended and I really enjoyed it. It is a great spy thriller/Rogue 007 title. However the last few issues get Grant Morrison level trippy, but I'd still recommend it overall.   And finally, I'd recommend Pretty Deadly. It ended a while back but my understanding is the plan has always been to start it up again at some point. It is another western style setting. But with a paranormal/spiritual story instead of the sci-fi.   Also, I saw someone had mentioned Sheltered, which I would second.   If you want more details on any of them or more recommendation just let me know"

Especially when that post specifically mentions that Walking Dead when it was in it's first year was selling about 20k.

ImageComics,3c17sv,jake61341,3,Fri Jul 3 22:57:34 2015 UTC,That's sad. It's such a great comic. Most certainly top 3 material in my mind. On any given day you could swap those 5 books around though. They're just fantastic stories and I may favor one more depending on my mood.

ImageComics,3c17sv,Manaaniwanderer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:15:03 2015 UTC,Invisible Republic is one of the best new Image titles for sure.
ImageComics,3c17sv,Detention13,2,Tue Jul 7 13:12:47 2015 UTC,"Yup. It's possible it will jump to the top 3 for me after the first arc is done and we get a bit more of a conclusion to part of the story. So far it mostly seems to just be providing more questions than answers, and that's all fine, especially for a book that is just starting. My thing is that the other books have at least 1 arc complete (Copperhead has 1, Southern Bastards has 2, and Lazarus has 3) so it's a slightly unfair comparison this early on.  I LOVE Invisible republic though, it's a fantastic book so far and I am crossing my fingers it continues doing what it's doing because this is an outstanding start."

Didn't feel right.  It's too early to rank The Dying & The Dead but I have very high hopes for that one. I know it's going to take a while to unfold, though. That means it's a serious investment, but I'm on board because I can see it getting almost as big (story-wise) as East of West.  It's too bad Alex + Ada had to end at 15 issues. Words cannot express how sad I am to see it end. It really felt like it was just getting started. I identify deeply with Alex as a character. It seems like most protagonists are larger-than-life heroes or people doing extraordinary things in extraordinary situations. Alex feels like the exact opposite. He's just a normal guy put in a precarious situation and reacts to it how almost anybody would. The whole thing feels so down to earth & real, just ~50 years or so into the future. Sci-fi that doesn't hinge on ambitious world-building seems rare these days.  Anyways, I needed to gush about that comic for a second. Nobody I know reads it."

I've also been pulling it from the start but I haven't read issues 6-10 yet. One of these days I'll sit down and get through them.  The setting is good, the art and colours are beautiful. The story is pretty well done in the first volume. Can't really engage in theories or anything.  Ive got tomorrow off, I'll read them tomorrow and come back."

Not actually a new #1 or anything, just an arc called 'Reboot', and I can imagine that continuity will eventually be restored. Surely. Please god do not ruin Invincible's continuity.   Maybe he sends himself back somehow,  Terminator-style, because it's the only way to stop Robot from gaining power?"

It's not a cosplay event, more of a day-long series of live press releases with good stagecraft. I am not sure I've ever noticed anyone dressed up -- mmmmaybe there was a Luci at last year's afterparty? -- so be ready to rock your look in a sea of jeans.   It's a lot of sitting and clapping. My personal tip is to judge whether you want to miss the stage events in favor of standing in line for signings-- especially given that the creators are highly accessible all day and mingle with us at the afterparty. Me, I prefer to stay in the main room and watch the panels. I get more out of it, but someone with a stronger emphasis on signing would feel differently.   It's a good event and a very different one. Sitting in front of that main stage getting the news at the same time as all the frantically typing press in the front rows offers fans a great sense of inclusion. Image's news isn't only for press, it's for us, too. I'm thrilled to be able to attend these events.  One more tip-- there's food and drink at the afterparty so save room!"

ImageComics,3baapo,Selykg,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:53:26 2015 UTC,I think the whole idea was to draw penises and stuff haha. There's also an xxx variant by someone else that's known to be nsfw
ImageComics,3baapo,Selykg,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:26:42 2015 UTC,All of the available new issues in solicitations have both a normal cover and a bagged version that's nsfw
ImageComics,3baapo,MattAlbie60,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:46:05 2015 UTC,"All issues will be bagged from what I understand, but the xxx variant will be distinguishable, whereas the blank covers they drew and the regular covers will have the same bag so you don't know what you get until you open it. That's what I thought was happening, I could've misunderstood it though."
ImageComics,3baapo,MattAlbie60,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:01:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's how it works.   My comic shop, TFAW.com, has two listings. I'm using issue 12 as an example because issue 11 is no longer listed. But, when I pre-ordered it was identical to how 12 is.   Example:  issue 12 normal - note the pre-order price of 2.80  issue 12 bagged - note the price of 3.75  First, why different skus if they're all bagged? Second, why would you pay more to potentially only get the same cover?  You'll note in the image solicitations that there are two skus as well. One for the bagged version and one for the normal."
ImageComics,3baapo,MattAlbie60,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:13:52 2015 UTC,"The bagged issue is the xxx variant, for issue 11 only they said they were doing in addition to the xxx variant (which is always the same, only bagged because of nsfw cover), the regular prices issues (#11 only) would be bagged for a 1:35 chance of getting a signed blank with a custom cover at cover price. But for issues 11-15 I believe they are doing xxx variants at 4.69 (3.75 for you). So you either buy the normal for cover price, or the variant at the upped price, but if you buy the normal there's a chance to get the signed blank.  http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/fraction-zdarsky-sign-sketch-seal-1000-copes-of-sex-criminals-11"

Other mistakes on their website: they recently posted a 26MB cover image for Satellite Sam #15 -- WARNING: NSFW! -- and a 13.5MB one for 8House: Kiem #3. They posted a .tif for Sunstone, Vol. 3 -- WARNING: NSFW!"

ImageComics,3azmxh,BCdotWHAT,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:50:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they change their release dates quite a bit. I posted a list last week, and those were all changes that happened in one day.  The most annoying thing is that they don't place their dates too far in the future, instead they have them close to the current date and then when it gets near that date they do an update and suddenly the release date is two months later."
ImageComics,3azmxh,BCdotWHAT,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:55:09 2015 UTC,"Sheesh, just look at today's changes.    Sex Criminals #11 is delayed by three weeks (odd, since this is now the same date as SexCrim #12),  Casanova: Acedia #3 by four weeks,  Velvet #12 goes from 1 July to 2 September..."
ImageComics,3azmxh,NotBeth,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:19:50 2015 UTC,"Rat Queens release dates have been messed up for months on there. What's funny is they will update one but not others so the release dates don't make sense. Like they updated #11 and #12 but #13 is still showing the old date, making it appear to come out before 11 & 12.   If you follow them on FB they're pretty good about updating as new dates are released. Probably Twitter too but I don't do Twitter!"

The past couple issues have just been kinda meh. Hopefully it picks up or I'll drop it.  The Walking Dead #143 - Because duh  Wytches Vol. 1 - I loved the single issues so much that I want the trade too!
ImageComics,3atkns,BoogKnight,2,Wed Jun 24 02:38:57 2015 UTC,Is it common for people to buy trades if they already have the singles? I've considered it a few times because of how easy it'd be to re read and I have a friend who doesn't treat my singles with OCD like care like I do.

Now I got all 4 volumes the rest of the single issues and signed up for the year subscription. It is amazing for anyone who hasn't tried it."

ImageComics,39i2wg,TimeLordBurrito,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:10:49 2015 UTC,"I bought Saga vol. 1 based on lots of good press/hype, and Sheltered vol. 1 just by reading the blurb.  Never read US comics until a few years ago (though I do read plenty of European comic books -- I'm from Belgium) but these days I read a ton, mostly Image ones."
ImageComics,39i2wg,TimeLordBurrito,3,Thu Jun 18 12:44:26 2015 UTC,Got some great titles in there. Are you trying to mostly do trades? Or do you plan to get some hardcovers?
ImageComics,39i2wg,Wishfuldrifter,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:53:50 2015 UTC,"I have a few hard covers but I prefer paperbacks just cause when I started I was just getting TPBs so i just kept buying them. I do have a problem with popular books releasing Hardcovers before TPBs. Like locke and key, probably my top book next to Saga, released the last book hardback and took ages to release the trade. I really wanted to read it but i put it off till it was paperback."

ImageComics,39i2wg,WilliamBrilliance,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:36:49 2015 UTC,In a perfect world I would love to have everything Hardback but at this point it would feel wasteful to start re-buying stuff I already own. Chew is one of my favourite series. I'm almost finished vol. 4 Flambe

ImageComics,39i2wg,Detention13,2,Fri Jun 12 09:05:26 2015 UTC,"Another thing I forgot to Mention was that my Sister used to work in Waterstones (UK book store, don't know if you have it in america) and she got a 50% discount on all books/Comics and she could also order in books/comics. So basically I would go in and drop like £60ish and get double the trades I would normally get for that price. And some of the smaller image trades would be like £7.50 so it would only cost me £3.75. Needless to say she was pressured to stay in the job for longer than she probably wanted to XD"

So I assume your sister isn't such a comics fan, if she didn't want to use the discount for herself. :P But a 50% discount is massive! In this case, I would try to flood myself in comics, too. Btw, thanks for still answering a long time after I posted the comment."

I think she reads like the walking dead but im not sure. the discount allows like £10,000 a year of discount so she couldn't really run out... unless we spent like 20k on books and comics.

ImageComics,39gknj,losicecreams,3,Thu Jun 11 16:03:36 2015 UTC,It's bound really well so no issues. But it's very heavy and not very portable. Mostly read it at home on a table or the couch with a cushion on my lap. The individual trades seem to be coming out monthly now. So you could read it that way.
ImageComics,39gknj,saturdaysgone,2,Thu Jun 11 20:49:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the physical info I was looking to get this instead of the trades as it seems much more worth it but thanks for the advice!
ImageComics,39gknj,Body_without_organs,2,Fri Jun 12 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"It is held up pretty well for me. Stray Bullets is so good, if the book just fell apart once you finished it, it would still be worth it."

ImageComics,39g1ak,ShinCoal,3,Thu Jun 11 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"This was the second series I read since I started reading comics again (stopped in the early 90s, started again with Fatale in Fall 2014). I loved Girls. Weird space alien sperm monster. Smart look at gender issues, lots of plot points made to make you think, likeable characters (and hateable ones too). Yet, it never felt over the top, and the storyline always seemed to be heading in the right direction. It was always going somewhere. I guess it's why I've given the Luna Brothers' other projects a chance (since then I've read The Sword, Alex + Ada, and Whispers).  I've only seen the movie version of The Mist, and the parallels never crossed my mind."
ImageComics,39g1ak,Koalacanth,2,Fri Jun 12 05:07:47 2015 UTC,"Never read this, but I really enjoyed Alex + Ada and was thinking of checking out Luna's other work. Anyone read both and recommend it?"
ImageComics,39g1ak,bunkermatt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:31:43 2015 UTC,I haven't read either but I read The Sword and loved it! Couldn't put it down.
ImageComics,39g1ak,jpjtourdiary,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"I have the same question. I've peeked at Star Bright and the Looking Glass & it is really something. Basically an original fairy tale / fable all written & drawn by Jonathan Luna. I haven't finished it, but it's just a one-shot hardcover, so not really enough to wet the appetite after Alex + Ada.  SO freaking sad that Alex + Ada is ending with issue 15. It could go so much further. Here's to hoping it gets some kind of spin-off / continuation in the form of a series w/ a subtitle or something. I'd prefer a continuation, but I'm hedging my bets & not getting my hopes up. :("
ImageComics,39g1ak,Detention13,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:14:42 2015 UTC,"I recommend it. There were several WTF moments but I binged it because I couldn't put it down. The story is phenomenal and deals with a lot of societal preconceptions toward both men and women. And of course the art is top notch. It does have some nudity, though."
ImageComics,39g1ak,TheAmazingSpider-Ham,2,Thu Jun 11 21:02:08 2015 UTC,I have only read the first volume so far and I like it. The main guy is an arsehole but that's what i like about him. I have only seen 'The Mist' Film and I can kinda see it going in a smiler direction but being trapped in a small town rather than just a store. I love that film and if its anything like that im sure i will love the rest of the series.

ImageComics,39bphn,alltaken21,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:17:29 2015 UTC,"Invisible Republic & Descender are blowing my mind right now. Injection could also be shaping up into something good, but I haven't had a chance to read the second issue yet. Roche Limit is also really good. The fifth issue just came out in February & now it's spawned a new series, Roche Limit: Clandestiny, which is now in its 4th issue.  OH... The Dying & The Dead is going to be something you want to get on board with now. It's Jonathan Hickman's (writer of East of West) newest series and like East of West, it's really ambitious. The first issue is massive and to me it was like seeing a 2.5hr movie and coming out of theater thinking ""How long was that? An hour and a half?"" It's that engrossing. 3rd issue comes out July 15th.  Let's be real. Pretty much anything sci-fi that Image is putting out right now is gold."
ImageComics,39bphn,Detention13,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:56:08 2015 UTC,"Some good suggestions in here (especially Descender and Injection) but I'd like to add Rebels to the list.  I know this is /r/ImageComics so suggesting a Dark Horse book is probably a faux pas but Rebels is excellent so far, only 3 issues are out and honestly it feels like it could be an Image title when you're reading it."

I don't have any knowledge of the ordering process, or where to find out an ordering deadline for a certain book but the below quote from Zdarsky's tumblr less than a week ago leads me to believe they could still be added to a shop's order.   It’s as easy as telling your retailer to order one! There’s no “order ten copies, get one copy” bullshit or “be in this alley on this date in those boots gary likes” bullshit, just an order code!

ImageComics,38n6hw,BoogKnight,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:56:31 2015 UTC,"Yea, it seems like something is different this time around. Possibly that killing the gods isn't extending her life as long anymore."
ImageComics,38n6hw,Coffeypot0904,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah something like that. I just realized I was wrong and that ananke definitely killed Lucifer lol. I'm an idiot, I totally forgot that's what happened."
ImageComics,38n6hw,BoogKnight,2,Fri Jun 5 22:09:46 2015 UTC,"I think I also recall Ananke specifically telling someone that killing a god WONT extend their life. If she is killing to add time to her life, it would make sense that she would lie and dissuade others from doing it. Also she deemed Laura's death as ""necessary"" while her parents were not, implying that the parents deaths wouldn't give her any benefit."
ImageComics,38n6hw,Coffeypot0904,2,Fri Jun 5 22:15:14 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a pretty cool ending to be honest. We all went in thinking Baphomet would be doing the killing, and throughout the issue we were led to believe it was going to happen sooner or later.  Laura's desperation to become one of the ""Pantheon"", the joy at discovering her ""voice"", and then the cruel, cruel twist where she was murdered by Ananke.   It was a wonderfully done bait-and-switch.   I almost think that Ananke has been kept alive all this time by murdering the Gods one by one. It would be ridiculous if that's the case.   I loved that issue."
ImageComics,38n6hw,azmanian_devil,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:50:17 2015 UTC,"But in the first issue, they're all seen together as if they specifically met to die, then were killed by Ananke. If she is, in fact, killing them for their life, then something else may be at work where she can't wait the full two years any more and has to kill them earlier."
ImageComics,38n6hw,Coffeypot0904,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:48:48 2015 UTC,"I thought that they killed themselves with the ""circle snap"".   How does Ananke fit in?"
ImageComics,38n6hw,MightyProJet,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:31:02 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts: I think anake works the same way the gods work: if she kills them she gets more time. Notice how she's always the one to do the deed? I'm probably totally wrong but that's just my theory.  Also I had to reread that part so many times before I could process what happened. Holy fucking shit. And honestly I thought it was some really great writing mixed with really great art for that scene. The looks on her face, the way you see the incoming doom. I thought it was great. But now my two favorite characters are dead and I'm sad. I'm curious who the focus is going to shift to now. Cassandra?"

ImageComics,37w33i,idontliketocomment,2,Sat May 30 23:50:45 2015 UTC,This is awesome. Was kinda thinking of doing the same thing when I move into a more permanent place.   What was your method of choosing for displaying certain issues? Just the newest from what you're pulling?
ImageComics,37w33i,Legion564,1 point,Sat May 30 23:59:34 2015 UTC,Newest for the series. With saga (My favorite) I chose to display the covers i liked / was most proud of owning (hence the 1A). Eventually I would love to show off all of them but the space would be immense. I've seen some sliding rack things for posters on sale that I may eventually try to engineer for comics.

ImageComics,37wt9l,settleddown,2,Sun May 31 18:23:59 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the first volume. The story is well done and has a lot of mystery. I have no idea how it actually plays out beyond that.   My only issue is that even though the artwork looks beautiful I don't think it fits very well with the atmosphere the story is supposed to be setting. That's just me.   I recommend checking out the first volume by all means.
ImageComics,37wt9l,hazrek,2,Sun May 31 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"I read the first volume yesterday and really enjoyed it. I like the artwork a lot, and the characters are compelling, which is at least as important as the mystery and supernatural elements for me.  I'm going to pick up the rest of it today while it's on sale."
ImageComics,37wt9l,bunkermatt,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the first four arcs. The one that just wrapped felt a little under par, but that may be more from me going from trades to monthlies for this arc. I think it is one of Image's more unsung series going on."

I stuck around until a little into the second arc, couldn't keep my interest in it, and then dumped it. Pace was a little slow, but I can see how a comic like this would translate into something CW watchers might like.   That being said, I'm hoping this tv show becomes wildly successful so that I can sell off my issues at a higher rate, lol."

ImageComics,37mo06,nakedpicturetime,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:05:35 2015 UTC,I literally searched for Image Comics on Reddit just to talk about Nowhere Men. Was it officially announced that it's coming back? I'm very excited because nothing has taken the place of this amazing book. Manhattan Projects and Black Science don't even come close to what this comic did and I hoped they would fill the gap. Please bring it back!
ImageComics,37l25a,admiraltoad,3,Thu May 28 12:17:01 2015 UTC,"While I echo some of the reviewer's opinions I definitely liked Material a lot more than this reviewer... but then I'm always extremely sympathetic to comics which play around with the comics form.   It feels like Material is Kot's return to the idea of a semi-educational comic, with all the annotations in the margins referring us to further reading/music/whatever material (ba-dum tish), like in Wild Children. Reminds me a little of a university lecture in that it's a prompt/inspiration for the student's mind instead of spelling out precisely what the creators want us to learn.  Whether it succeeds for any of us readers is... well, that's a matter of taste I guess. But that's why I like seeing what Comic Bastards have to say - you might not always agree with their reviewers but you can trust they're calling it how they see it."
ImageComics,37l25a,deviden,3,Fri May 29 10:31:31 2015 UTC,I really like Ales Kot's writing and think that his views are extremely modern. I have been keeping up with Zero which has fallen into a complete psychedelic paradox and the Surface which shows huge influences of a post internet age and feel that this comic is being really strait forward with Ales just expressing his ideas and hope he keeps it up.
ImageComics,37i8a6,luckie_reubs,4,Wed May 27 20:45:57 2015 UTC,"I don't find humor in the false visual imputs, it's all Balloon and the programmers controlling Babylon. He's going to change from this innocent kid into the End. Kind of says something about nature v. nurture though, that he isn't an ""evil"" force (concerning the world at large) but is probably becoming one through this programming and manipulation.   This is a pivotal issue for us seeing the development of Death's son, moreso than the issues that feature the Ranger. Hickman is really showcasing his ability to craft characters with these types of issues in EoW (Mao, Death, Babylon, the Prince, the Endless Nation) and I think it's stronger than his actual plotting for this story. Wonder if it's still on track for 60 issues or if the run is going to be bumped up. Dragotta's art is crisp and gives the series a look I hope continues throughout its run."

I guess it really depends on the artist.  A rough, illustrative style like Latour, lends itself to a more forgiving interpretation of scripted consistency.  A more concrete style like Quitely, Cassaday, or even Oeming and Bachalo, grounds the reader in the color and hue of the environment... confining our understanding of the script with characterizing signatures.  Latour rends our understanding of story with swift and broad strokes, using color and inconsistency to depict the environment as it's meant to be - impermanent, nuanced, and flawed.  Like when none of the plates, silverware, or cups match, but the table is still set and dinner is served."

ImageComics,37f7m3,Legion564,3,Wed May 27 17:55:53 2015 UTC,"Latour pointed it out in his tweet. He wasn't being a dick, but he wasn't bending over backwards to coddle a fan. Sometimes an artist has to make ""mistakes"" to fit everything the writer wants into the panel, and, not to mention, make it visible. In the end, does the location of the star-badge blow a big hole in the plot and rip apart the flow of the story? Hell no.   Furthermore, in the South, it's spelled Shauna until you yell it. Then the drawl you've tried to suppress takes over and it's ShAWna.   edit source- Mississippian, probably grew up not too far from wherever Craw County was based on."
ImageComics,37f7m3,Legion564,1 point,Wed May 27 19:07:31 2015 UTC,Interesting. And I assume the tweet you're talking about was the one between him and I?
ImageComics,37f7m3,Selykg,3,Wed May 27 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's posted all over this submission."
ImageComics,37f7m3,Legion564,2,Wed May 27 20:06:27 2015 UTC,"Man, I never noticed this."
ImageComics,37f7m3,Selykg,2,Wed May 27 06:32:29 2015 UTC,Someone should really ask Latour about this.
ImageComics,37f7m3,Legion564,5,Wed May 27 16:51:30 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/rtGF1Ar I did. He criticized me for not putting in spaces on twitter.
ImageComics,37f7m3,Selykg,2,Wed May 27 18:03:37 2015 UTC,Lol I think my respect level for him just dropped a lot.
ImageComics,37f7m3,Legion564,2,Wed May 27 18:37:16 2015 UTC,"Respect? Dude, he made some minor mistakes. You don't make mistakes at work?   All things have deadlines. Otherwise you never ship.   Anyone who is going to bitch about this type of thing has lost perspective on real life"
ImageComics,37f7m3,HeraldHS,3,Thu May 28 01:36:02 2015 UTC,It's not just that it's how he responded back to op. Also with Image books the creative team can take longer than artists at marvel or DC and I would think for something as symbolic as earl's dad's graveyard he would have made sure they were the same.
ImageComics,37f7m3,MuscularSon,1 point,Thu May 28 01:57:41 2015 UTC,I don't see the big deal on Latour's response. For the same reason the OP left out periods Latour's had to be brief. He also made it clear that we're human and mistakes happen.   Twitter is a shitty medium for communication in any meaningful way.
ImageComics,37f7m3,isaacsploding,1 point,Thu May 28 02:04:30 2015 UTC,I guess I just expect more consistency from them then.
ImageComics,37f7m3,isaacsploding,2,Thu May 28 02:07:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sure if you dig into any comic you'll find issues like this. The point is that the greater story be enjoyable. Isn't that the reason we read comics?   It sounds like most people in this thread never seen these errors when they read it. Without the OP pointing this out they'd never have known, yourself included. Now you're expecting more consistency? For something you had to have pointed out to you?  You know, I work for a company that makes software. Pretty popular software actually. A couple years ago we rewrote our application from scratch, minus some internal libraries for making development easier, and it was a hell of a battle. We cut corners, we had bugs, mistakes happened and shit was messy for awhile. But after two years of developing it we had to ship or it was never going to ship.   Sometimes you just have to throw it out there and hope for the best. Southern Bastards isn't the only comic he works on, right? Deadlines matter, he has a schedule and pushing an issue doesn't just mean it inconveniences him, it means it pushes printing, payment, etc. comics don't generally make money until they goto trade or so I heard.   Another important consideration is that no one likes when they are told by someone not in the same business that they're doing what they do wrong. I can't tell you the number of times people have come to me and said I was doing things wrong. I always ask if they do what I do for a living and if they say no I happily ask them if they'd appreciate it if I went into their work and having no experience with it told them they were doing their job wrong.   People are not infallible. We make mistakes, we are protective of our creations, and especially when we pour ourselves into something. The simple fact that OP even asked Latour about this shocks me. It's honestly selfish and inconsiderate.   Take it for what you will, but this entire complaint by OP smells like a lot of bullshit to me.   Enjoy. The. Story.   That is ultimately what matters."
ImageComics,37f7m3,Bobwayne17,2,Thu May 28 02:17:18 2015 UTC,"Selfish of me? I buy Southern Bastards. He gets MY money. I don't think it's unreasonable to be concerned about a lot of mistakes. Plus, people need constructive criticism. I wasn't being a dick. You say if we ""dig"" into any comic, well find mistakes. I wasn't digging. That's the problem. They're not hard to find, they're blatant. Or at least for me, because I'm very analytical about everything in life. Never the less, I love Southern Bastards, and the fact that he even responded to my tweet at all shows he cares about fans."

Although Kirkman has a lot of projects going on right now, so maybe there are more mistakes around issues 100 (or whenever he started the TWD show and invincible) and forward? Especially now at issue 141 I wouldn't blame him for making mistakes with outcast, the outcast show in development, etc. But then again that's a writer not an artist."

ImageComics,3725zk,Legion564,9,Sun May 24 04:18:28 2015 UTC,"A lot of Image books like to put out an arc and then take a break and then get back to it.  Plus, because it's creator owned, sometimes there are release gaps because of funding and what not.  Source: I work at a comic shop and get to learn stuff from creators and all that fun stuff."
ImageComics,3725zk,hoopajoop69,1 point,Sun May 24 10:06:57 2015 UTC,Exactly.  Creator owned and creator paid for.
ImageComics,3725zk,kesselrun_7,1 point,Sun May 24 13:28:34 2015 UTC,Do creators have to pay Image for every issue? I thought after they got it going it was fine.
ImageComics,3725zk,Legion564,1 point,Sun May 24 16:03:38 2015 UTC,That's a good question.  I'm not really sure what the answer is.
ImageComics,3725zk,kesselrun_7,1 point,Sun May 24 16:59:19 2015 UTC,"Check out Jim Zub's series of articles entitled ""Creator-Owned Economics"".  The implication is that, like record companies, the creator goes into debt with the company and pays it back over the printing run.  Some interesting quotes:   Even with Image covering costs so we didn’t have to spend our own money to print or distribute...  Here’s the real beauty of the Image model when it’s running at full steam and, as far as I know, it’s something no other creator-owned publisher can match: Image has a flat administrative fee for soliciting and releasing each issue of a series. That amount does not change no matter how much the issue sells. On a relatively low selling comic (like back in 2010 with Skullkickers #1) that base fee can eat up most of what’s left over after the printer, distributor, and retailer take their cut but, on a strong selling comic that amount stays the same and the issue becomes a lot more profitable. A lot."
ImageComics,3725zk,wagneranti,6,Mon May 25 04:05:52 2015 UTC,"Look how long it took to get 5 issues of Jupiter's Legacy out.  Image has a lot of good quality comics for this reason, they don't pump out garbage just to keep shelves full."
ImageComics,3725zk,OldManHowlett,3,Sun May 24 05:12:40 2015 UTC,"All of what you said is true and I will also add that Fraction is notorious for letting his arcs fall off and get lazy. Hawkeye was becoming really inconsistent and the delays were just crazy. Inhumanity was passed over Charles Soule after 1 or 2 issues because he was taking too long. I'm sure this had more to do with his creator owned work becoming quite successful on its own and what comic creator wouldn't get excited about your own IP taking off and becoming kind of bored with the big 2 and their limitations.   Also, the artist for sex criminals is writing Howard the Duck for Marvel and that is probably eating up a lot of the time he has to draw sex criminals."

ImageComics,3725zk,blitzman734,6,Sun May 24 19:28:52 2015 UTC,The bonus is you tend to have a very consistent creative team. You don't have random chunks of story where the art falls off completely.

ImageComics,370yih,SoapRage,2,Mon May 25 03:45:40 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Grabbing some series on payday this will be one of them. I just realized its Rick Remender. In my experience he does a great first book, but hit or miss after the first one. I will still go for it. Thanks man!!"
ImageComics,370yih,BouleanApe,1 point,Mon May 25 04:00:07 2015 UTC,"Np, hope you enjoy it!"
ImageComics,370yih,agingnerds,2,Mon May 25 05:20:10 2015 UTC,"Some of my favourites that were not mentioned are Manifest Destiny (supernatural exploration by Lewis&Clark), Deadly Class (Hogwarts for young assassins with amazing art), Birthright (great twist on what happens after classic fantasy stories), and Ghosted (great 20-issues horror story with in-depth mythology)."
ImageComics,370yih,Legion564,3,Sun May 24 11:59:17 2015 UTC,"I am a huge image comics fan in fact I would say i am a bit of a fan boy. Here is a list of some of my favorites. I could go on, but this is a good start, plus there have already been a great list created by previous comments. Here is my list: Sex Criminals (M.Fraction), Rat Queens (K. Wiebe), Velvet (E.Brubaker), Thief of Thieves (R.Kirkman), Trees (W.Ellis), Saga (B.Vaughan), Shutter (J.Keatinge), Southern Bastards (Aaron), Pretty Deadly (K.DeConnick), Prophet (B.graham), Lazarus (G.Rucka), Fade out (Brubaker), Fatale (E.Brubaker), Five Ghosts (F.Barbiere), East of West (j.Hickman), Chew (j.layman), C.O.W.L (K.Higgins), Manhattans Projects (j.hickman)... this list can go on a bit more. Sorry kind of a nerd when it comes to this stuff. Hope this helps.  BTW. My favorite is Rat Queens and anything Brubaker."
ImageComics,370yih,Selykg,1 point,Sun May 24 04:16:56 2015 UTC,Wow! Thanks! But if you have to choose the best two from your list...?
ImageComics,370yih,Monktank,2,Sun May 24 05:29:25 2015 UTC,From his list I would pick Chew and Velvet.
ImageComics,370yih,mi0j,2,Sun May 24 05:35:31 2015 UTC,Lazarus and Southern Bastards for me. Lazarus is amazing.
ImageComics,370yih,agingnerds,2,Sun May 24 15:42:57 2015 UTC,Saga and Southern Bastards for sure!!
ImageComics,370yih,sova_77,2,Sun May 24 18:45:54 2015 UTC,Saga and East of West
ImageComics,370yih,americanmook,1 point,Sun May 24 20:15:32 2015 UTC,"My favorites are probably Rat queens and Saga, but honestly a good chunk of them I keep up with on a near monthly basis."

But if I have to suggest just one, I say go with Invincible. Can not stress enough how good this book is. As an added incentive, you can buy the giant sized omnibuses on Amazon for cheap. You'll get most of the entire run, so far, in two gigantic volumes."
ImageComics,370yih,robotron2112,1 point,Sun May 24 06:49:34 2015 UTC,I hope is not the typical superheroe comic. Im a little bit tired of Marvel/DC superheroes style.

ImageComics,370yih,pchancharl,1 point,Sun May 24 09:54:03 2015 UTC,Descender is also a great new sci fi comic. But it's only 4ish issues in so isn't collected yet.

ImageComics,36vrpd,admiraltoad,3,Fri May 22 14:43:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the post.  I love Trees and I wish more people would check it out. This new arc is an excellent jumping on point.
ImageComics,36vrpd,Hellbound-Glory,2,Fri May 22 20:48:05 2015 UTC,"The  first arc was a little slow and in my opinion had too many character arcs that never had anything to do with each other, but I still liked it after re reading the first 8 all together. #9 definitely seems to be heading in a good direction."
ImageComics,36vrpd,BoogKnight,1 point,Fri May 22 20:58:58 2015 UTC,I kind of give up after the first arc. I think I have through 11 showing up at my door though

Bummer. I was hoping for an ongoing. It's been a while since Morrison was on an ongoing."
ImageComics,36t46k,briancarknee,2,Thu May 21 23:00:05 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he did finish a seven year project just about two years ago."
ImageComics,36t46k,briancarknee,3,Fri May 22 01:51:53 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I wasn't saying he's a lazy writer or something. He always has at least half a dozen projects going on at once.  I just love when he has the space in ongoings to really explore and flesh out some of his ideas. His Doom Patrol run in one of my favorite runs of all time."

ImageComics,36iq2j,lolarline,5,Tue May 19 21:43:35 2015 UTC,For sure. That sucked when it was put on hiatus. But much worse is what Nate was dealing with. Can't wait for the story to continue.
ImageComics,36iq2j,Braillebreak,5,Tue May 19 22:00:15 2015 UTC,What happened? I thought they just stopped it. This has made my day  Now if bedlam would come back....
ImageComics,36iq2j,_Diren_,3,Wed May 20 07:55:40 2015 UTC,"The artist, Nate, went through a period of heavy depression that put the book behind schedule. He posted about it on a blog somewhere. And the way Eric gave him space and time to deal with those problems without adhering to the onslaught of doubt that the book would finish was really admirable."
ImageComics,36iq2j,Braillebreak,3,Wed May 20 11:14:13 2015 UTC,I see it as a reprinting of Vol.1. is there an actual solicitation for vol.2?
ImageComics,36iq2j,actioncomicbible,3,Wed May 20 01:44:28 2015 UTC,It says it's getting a reprinting because the series is returning in the fall.
ImageComics,36iq2j,King_slender,2,Wed May 20 02:34:49 2015 UTC,I'm blind. Thanks for point it out! :)
ImageComics,36iq2j,actioncomicbible,3,Wed May 20 02:58:03 2015 UTC,Best news of my month. Two amazing series
ImageComics,36iq2j,_Diren_,2,Wed May 20 07:56:12 2015 UTC,Wow. Nowhere Men.  That is good news all around.

At least, no new series starting, I can get behind that, these new comics coming fast and hard every month has me getting behind a lot.  Copperhead is great so glad to see that in here and on a consistent schedule. That rocks.   Descender i think is ending the first arc?  Great to see Drifter back as well. Though I think it came back in July.   Kaptara ends the first arc. I'm excited to read the second issue this week.  Lazarus is also on a solid regular schedule.  Low... same drill.  It looks like most of my comics are on their regularly scheduled program. I'm only disappointed that I am not seeing a Rat Queens Hardcover yet"

ImageComics,36i0qq,Suppiluliuma89,3,Tue May 19 15:14:05 2015 UTC,Only issue 1 & 2 will come out this year!? That's a bummer. A HC will come out in July 8th and it will include bonus material...can't wait!
ImageComics,36i0qq,xcurly89,3,Wed May 20 03:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was bummed to read that they're only doing 2-3 issues per year, they at least could've spaced it a little more instead of just a month apart. That said I do enjoy it, its not as serious as some other comics I'm into, which I like."
ImageComics,36i0qq,BoogKnight,2,Wed May 20 21:54:20 2015 UTC,"Next Year!?!? thats so unfortunate, this is my favorite new line right now."
ImageComics,36i0qq,Davonport,2,Tue May 19 19:10:12 2015 UTC,"Yah, bummed me out too. I don't really get the European system, because I've never really read any series using that one. Basically, the reasoning is that if both issues were broken down into standard US sizes, it'd be about six issues."
ImageComics,36i0qq,Davonport,2,Tue May 19 19:11:56 2015 UTC,I think in the end it will limit their sales just due to no exposure and and consumers short attention spans. Their only saving grace will be if the reviews start blowing up.
ImageComics,36i0qq,CallMePlissken,2,Tue May 19 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed this, glad others did too.   I think there are some small issues I had (lots of threads, but not enough time to flesh them all out), but overall I agree with your points."
ImageComics,36i0qq,BoogKnight,2,Wed May 20 16:29:48 2015 UTC,Yeah they tried to do quite a lot with only 2 issues
ImageComics,36hcua,Hellbound-Glory,3,Tue May 19 12:02:22 2015 UTC,"Trees - One of my favorite running comics. I know it's a slow read, but I love the story.  Spawn - Hoping its good. Nostalgia for my youth can't keep me reading forever."
ImageComics,36hcua,admiraltoad,2,Wed May 20 05:09:46 2015 UTC,"Nothing for me this week, though I might grab Kaptara #2 to check it out. I enjoyed the first issue and am interested in seeing where it is going. It would be easier jumping on for the run if it was limited though. I wish creators were more inclined to write limited series. I enjoy epics (like Saga) but sometimes I just want a movie via a comic."
ImageComics,36hcua,GuyOne,1 point,Tue May 19 12:13:36 2015 UTC,I really liked the second issue maybe not as much as the first. Keith didn't get on my nerves like I thought he'd start to and I kinda like him. I once knew a guy exactly like Keith. It got on my nerves every now and then but man he said some hilarious things.   I do like the Flash Gordon vibe to it. The crazy flying creatures and cat tanks are just awesome. The humor is up my alley too.
ImageComics,36hcua,azmanian_devil,2,Fri May 22 21:38:07 2015 UTC,"Fade Out has been excellent, looking forward to this issue. Although the cover art seems to have diverged a little bit from the faces theme they were going on.   And since Scott Snyder can do no wrong recently, Wytches."

ImageComics,36hcua,Legion564,1 point,Wed May 20 14:12:40 2015 UTC,Would you say you like velvet more or fade out? I love velvet and am thinking of trying fade out but I'm not sure whether I'll like it enough.

I'm afraid the best I can do is say that I think The Fade Out is an excellent book. If your local shop has Issue #1 or vol 1 of the trade, I'd say it's worth the investment."
ImageComics,36hcua,Kahrooch,1 point,Thu May 21 04:55:36 2015 UTC,Spawn #252 - Tried to jump on with the return of Al. I'll give it a few issues or so to see if it's worth sticking with.   Wytches #6 - Finally! The suspense has been unreal!

ImageComics,36hcua,GuyOne,1 point,Tue May 19 15:43:09 2015 UTC,I only have experience with the first issue but that in itself wasn't enough to hook me.
ImageComics,36hcua,BoogKnight,1 point,Tue May 19 16:34:54 2015 UTC,"It's slow, and the first arc focuses a lot on characters instead of the trees, reading them all at once would be much better than waiting a few months for action. It's really hit or miss."

ImageComics,36hcua,joowgir,1 point,Wed May 20 17:09:21 2015 UTC,"Only Ghosted #20 for me. It looks like the last issue of this nice serie I enjoyed from the beginning. I also liked Trees so far but I'll wait for the trade on this one, as previously said it might be a better read that way."
ImageComics,36hcua,drewskyh,1 point,Tue May 19 17:20:33 2015 UTC,I'm curious to see how Trees sales will look; I imagine I'm not the only one switching from buying monthly to waiting for the trade. It's a good story but I had to re-read a few issues each month to remember what's going on.
ImageComics,36hcua,luckie_reubs,1 point,Thu May 21 12:36:08 2015 UTC,"I've been reading Trees, but I'm going to drop that one; it's been kind of slow and would lend itself better to being read as a trade, I think. Same for Oddly Normal, which I get for our daughter. I'd prefer just one book on her floor rather than 5 for each volume.  So, nothing for me from Image this week."

Because the cover is completely (limited edition) filth!   Maybe #12 and #13 aren't hand drawn or whatever like #11 and are just more limited edition normal print covers that are a bit more adult.

ImageComics,35v0fv,Mr_Potato_Oles,4,Wed May 13 19:09:57 2015 UTC,"By typing any of these comics names into the search bar you will find people who have asked similar questions about each and every one of these comics. It's a good way to read through people's thoughts on them.   To answer your question, yes peter panzerfaust is a great read. I've enjoyed it without being a big fan of peter pan or WW2. Kurtis is a great writer and blends the two subjects together perfectly. Specifically with the peter pan subject material, it never feels overbearing or forced. This is not rat queens though. There's no nudity I can think of and the humor isn't quite as mature as rat queens. Between the two I prefer rat queens.  Of the other series I can say birthright, chew, and deadly class are all excellent but I consider black science and saga the only two ""must reads"" on your list (at least of the series I've read). You might also consider low. It's another sci fi series by rick remender (author of black science)."
ImageComics,35v0fv,BrownBoognish,1 point,Wed May 13 19:19:02 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate the feedback. So to someone who hasn't read any of these though, which book would you recommend to start reading first?"

I was incredibly impressed with it when I picked it up. Very good sci fi. Saga is also amazing. Peter panzerfaust is great as well. You can't go wrong with any of them"
ImageComics,35v0fv,AlconTheFalcon,3,Wed May 13 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Chew and East of West are both must reads."
ImageComics,35v0fv,JimmyMcShiv,4,Wed May 13 19:19:21 2015 UTC,East of west is incredible
ImageComics,35v0fv,Selykg,2,Wed May 13 20:13:01 2015 UTC,Yep. I don't know why it hasn't won an Eisner. It is incredibly well done.
ImageComics,35v0fv,Selykg,2,Wed May 13 20:15:09 2015 UTC,"Ninja edit: I have enjoyed Peter Panzerfaust. You'll do yourself a great favor by reading the original Peter Pan before reading the graphic novel though. There's a lot of cool tie ins.   I have enjoyed Rat Queens, I just started reading it this past weekend and will likely get through the entire current run sometime in the next week.  Birthright seems to get great reviews, I have the first trade but have not yet read it. I figured for $8 I couldn't go wrong to give it a shot.  Black Science didn't do it for me, but Rick Remender is a skilled writer  imo, I love his other book Low. I may give Black Science another shot next time I can pickup a few issues cheap on Comixology. I only read the first issue and wasn't super impressed, but it's possible reading a couple more issues might change my mind I guess.  Rick Remender also write Deadly Class, so, there you go.   Chew is fun. If you like Rat Queens, you might really like Chew.  East of West is a great book imo. It's dense... be prepared to read it several times to get all the story. I actually had to take notes and research stuff for this one.  Five Ghosts, again, I have the first trade but haven't read it yet. It's on my list though as I love the premise.  The Manhattan Projects is interesting, but the lack of plot kinda killed it for me. I love Hickman's other book right now The Dying and the Dead.   Nameless is sort of like East of West in the density. Lots of dense story here. Be prepared to re-read.  Never read Ody-C but I've heard good things.  Roche Limit is pretty cool. I don't think it lived up to the hype for me, but it was an interesting read none-the-less. I may throw up my TPB at /r/comicswap soon since I now have individual issues as well.  Saga is a lot of fun. I would highly recommend it.  Never read sex, cannot comment. Perhaps you meant Sex Criminals? If so, that one is pretty interesting if you're into Matt Fractions stuff.   Trees is pretty weird, not going to lie. I think the second volume is starting back up soon.   Wytches is great, and I think the first trade is coming out soon."
ImageComics,35v0fv,Selykg,1 point,Wed May 13 19:38:19 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate you taking the time to write little blurbs about all those books! So, you enjoyed the Peter Pan book? I've only seen the Disney movie, and Hook. Is the book interesting or different in ways?(if so I'd be interested).   Also, East of West seems to be the most interesting read to me after reading everyone's replies, and reading a little bit about the book. But what made you feel like researching it? Anyways, that sounds awesome.   I'm actually interested in Nameless because Grant Morrison said he was going for a Lovecraft horror story feel, and that's right up my alley.  Thanks for the feedback!"
ImageComics,35v0fv,Legion564,1 point,Wed May 13 20:03:26 2015 UTC,"So, the Peter Pan you know is a fairy tale. It's a fantastical story about a boy named Peter. Hook and the other Disney related stories are all within that same sort of deviation from the original story.  Peter Panzerfaust is like a book about World War 2 but with the Peter Pan stuff tied into it. Peter Pan is one of your main characters and it follows him and the Lost Boys through the war. It's a combo of the french army and orphan's, like the original story. The villain is still Hook, but it's all tied into WW2.   If you aren't familiar with the story enough to know the characters and the history of Peter Pan you'll want to do that first. You would be able to read the original Peter Pan in a few days, it's a short story. This will give you a lot of background needed to fully enjoy Peter Panzerfaust. To be honest, I have no idea if the movies would give you enough as I haven't seen them in 15 years or more.   East of West is about the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse. It has a lot of tie in with religion and the 4 horsemen. I am a very non-religious person and therefore did not have much background on this whole thing. Thus research was needed to really grasp a lot of it.   Nameless is bananas. I'm not entirely sure I understand it, but it's also a mini series I think, ending with issue 5 or 6, I forget how many. It's typical Grant Morrison I hear in that he uses symbols and history and stuff and weaves a very deep story. I don't have any experience with Morrison's previous work so I cannot comment on it any more than it's a bit bananas for a new reader coming into it."
ImageComics,35v0fv,Selykg,1 point,Wed May 13 20:19:24 2015 UTC,"I looked up the book and it's free on the Kindle store, i guess because it's so old. So why not? I'll give a quick read. It sounds fun to be able to compare the two. I appreciate the feedback!"
ImageComics,35v0fv,jicty,1 point,Wed May 13 22:40:23 2015 UTC,Yea it's old and therefore in the public domain.

ImageComics,35v0fv,Dinosquid,1 point,Wed May 20 19:55:59 2015 UTC,I'll see what I can come up with. They're all hand written. I'll see if I can find them and let ya know if I find a good place to put them.
ImageComics,35v0fv,Dinosquid,2,Thu May 21 00:41:07 2015 UTC,"Birthright and saga are both amazing and must reads. Chrononauts is still new but the first 3 are really good and I have enjoyed them. That being said there is one book not on your list and I feel is a hidden gem. Wayward. Seriously, read the first trade and you will be hooked by the end, it has an interesting story and some of the most beautiful art I have seen."
ImageComics,35v0fv,Legion564,1 point,Thu May 14 01:28:46 2015 UTC,I will definitely check Wayward out. Looks interesting. I appreciate the feedback!

ImageComics,35v0fv,alext5,1 point,Wed May 13 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"Just to throw a few more names at you, my personal fav ongoing right now are Lazarus and Zero, both from Image Comics.  Of all the comics you listed: Peter Panzerfaust, and Black Science are my favs"
ImageComics,35v0fv,bunszellj11,1 point,Wed May 13 19:38:03 2015 UTC,I wasn't even looking at Lazarus and Zero. How are those?
ImageComics,35v0fv,Koalacanth,2,Wed May 13 19:54:24 2015 UTC,"Lazarus is enthralling - starts out slow, but after a while youre immersed in this world where separate families control the country, fragile alliances shifting, deep interesting storylines, Greg Rucka knows how to make you NEED to read just 1 more issue to find out what happens next.  Zero is basically like Bourne Identity, super-highly trained special ops guy codename: Zero, doing missions, at odds with the mysterious organization who gives him orders. The storyline is non-linear so one issue will be completely out of control chase with little dialoge, the next issue a very powerful somber story with an ending that made me need to re-read the entire issue again. I should say, not all people agree with me on how great this comic is, some people love it, some people ive talked to thought it was not their style at all."
ImageComics,35v0fv,jsibony,1 point,Wed May 13 20:42:40 2015 UTC,I'll definitely check out the first issues! I appreciate the info!
ImageComics,35v0fv,muggs60,1 point,Wed May 13 22:41:49 2015 UTC,I went from loving chew to trying rat Queens so I think you'll really like chew too. Image titles are all so different so it's always hard to say you'll like something based on your looking this book.

ImageComics,35v0fv,alltaken21,1 point,Thu May 14 00:08:15 2015 UTC,"East of West, Black Science, Deadly Class, and Saga are fantastic series.  Chrononauts is relatively new but good so far seems to be a pretty promising.  ODY-C is pretty out there and I would say its hard to follow.  I enjoy it because its a retelling of the Odyssey and I think that's cool."
ImageComics,35v0fv,alltaken21,1 point,Thu May 14 03:06:19 2015 UTC,"Five Ghosts was a little too one dimensional for me. Nameless has just gotten going, but I'm liking it so far. It's not as ""out there"" as I thought it would be, but seems to have a nice mix of space and magic. Ody-C wasn't for me. The writing was too weird, archaic. Saga will be with me for awhile. It's very solid, but start at the beginning. I have the first two trades of Sex. I liked the first trade, but maybe it's a slow read. I'm going to stick with it for a few more trades probably. It's not for everyone though. Trees I wasn't into, but might try to read through the first arc. The Wicked and Divine is popular, but I'm middle road with it. I can't really figure out why I keep reading it. Wytches is good, but probably better read as a trade."
ImageComics,35v0fv,alltaken21,1 point,Thu May 14 06:02:06 2015 UTC,"I thought peter panzerfaust was a. Interesting read, although i only read the first trade. Of the other titles, i read most of them (minus birthright, sex, and chrononauts). In my mind, they're all highly worth reading ( though if i could only pick two or three, I'd say go for east of west, saga, and chew for can't miss awesome titles). Nameless will really depend on how you feel about grant morrison and his writing style, and roche limit is an interesting title so far, but im still on the fence til i read the next story arc. Ody-c is another really strange title with fantastic art and a slightly confusing story but worth a read if youre into slightly alternative story telling ( it relies mostly on prose and narration as opposed to dialogue). Black science is a rompin good sci fi story with lots of fun action. And i haven't read wytches but i tend to trust most things scott Snyder writes so there you go. But for sure pick up east of west and saga. Those two are pretty much guaranteed hits IMHO"

Injection 1, The Mantle 1, Mythic 1 - 3 new series that caught my eye, excited to try them out!  Chrononauts 3 - a fun, SciFi buddy story.

I'm a big fan of Fiona staples artwork and I was interested to hear she will be doing 3 issues of Archie sometime in 2015. Nobody seems to tap into comics and genres quite like the way pandora does for music. Certain comics are so great and have many other similar titles you would also enjoy. Saga > Y The Last Man, etc.  We are surrounded by tons of amazing books and for those of us not near a local comic shop and without those recommendations your not reading probably all the great stuff you could be and growing this amazing arena of comics."

ImageComics,35fq8x,DecemberMagpie,10,Sat May 9 22:32:45 2015 UTC,Bought Sex Criminals weekend at a used book store. Came with an inscription to some guy named Bruce. I assumed that it was form a significant other. The store owner told me that that I could get the book signed today by Chip Zdarsky at TCAF. Turns out the original signature was from him as well.
ImageComics,35fq8x,new_eyes_open,6,Sat May 9 22:32:52 2015 UTC,"That's hilarious, and what a good sport. I imagine it's kind of a gut punch to see something you personally inscribed for someone you thought was a fan in the second hand bin. Good choice too - fantastic book. So, yeah, fuck Bruce!"
ImageComics,35fq8x,SamuraiJ,7,Sat May 9 23:37:50 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a Canadian, Chip Zdarsky is a national treasure and an amazing human being. He'll also sign just about anything, it doesn't even have to be in his name - I remember at last year's TCAF he was offering ""Stan Lee"" signatures for a small charitable donation lol.   This is also the guy who ran a one-man convention outside of Toronto's Fan Expo and routinely carries on conversations with a local Applebee's Facebook page!"

I thought the art was too basic to really showcase the sci-fi noir aspects of the story they were trying for and outside of an interesting premise the story was pretty bland. A new artist may help but I don't think I'll be buying this one again."

ImageComics,34jvn6,HGFantomas,2,Sat May 2 01:30:17 2015 UTC,"Comixology has a whole bunch of free #1 issues. I got over 20 including Southern Bastards, Wayward, Birthright, etc."

ImageComics,34abjv,Nanjasaurus,5,Wed Apr 29 15:40:31 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's just an advert from when they first announced the book.   It's definitely not a variant and I haven't seen it as a poster for sale.
ImageComics,34abjv,TheGreenJuan,5,Wed Apr 29 17:02:20 2015 UTC,"Dang that's such a shame. I had a feeling it wasn't a poster, since I feel like I hardly ever see Image posters, but I'm sad it's just promo artwork. It looks so great!"
ImageComics,34abjv,WolfieTheWolf,5,Wed Apr 29 17:04:52 2015 UTC,Upvote for simply being a cool as fuck picture.
ImageComics,34abjv,Madolan,3,Thu Apr 30 02:49:47 2015 UTC,That was Jamie's first teaser image for the series when it was announced! It was plastered big and bold in front of our faces at Image Expo.  It's a great idea for a print-- it's still absolutely valid in terms of where the book is at. You might even email McKelvie; he's open to ideas about prints.
ImageComics,34abvf,King_slender,2,Wed Apr 29 15:43:06 2015 UTC,"Well, hopefully they'll do a nice hardcover for this one."

ImageComics,34abvf,TweetPoster,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:43:10 2015 UTC,This is a bummer.  I felt it was really starting to hit its stride.
ImageComics,34abvf,BoogKnight,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:43:54 2015 UTC,I only read a few issue of this but I thought people were really liking this series. The art was pretty cool.
ImageComics,34abvf,BlueBlazerIrregular,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:48:30 2015 UTC,What a downer. I just tracked down all of the back issues like 3 weeks ago after receiving the first 5 as part of the last Image Humble Bundle. I liked the premise and it felt like it was going places. I particularly liked how the characters all felt fleshed out and had good motivation.
ImageComics,34aqh8,Nanjasaurus,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:29:50 2015 UTC,"I don't use it but I think it'd be great if I lived somewhere without a good comic store, but I'd personally rather use a local store. Also you can't get variant covers from image direct."
ImageComics,34aqh8,BoogKnight,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:51:00 2015 UTC,"I use TFAW.com. They take the normal MSRP and knock 20% off by pre-ordering. For example, I have Injection #1 pre-ordered. Normal price is $2.99, my pre-order price is $2.39.   I do have to pay shipping, which is sometimes a tad high depending on the number of comics being shipped but it's anywhere between $4 and $20 (usually I don't see $20 unless there are statues or a large number of trade's in the box to increase weight).   My last shipment had 13 floppies and cost $6.50 to ship. So, I mostly save the money of driving to the comic store since I don't live near one.   I set my shipment for pre-orders to every two weeks. So and the shipment method is the slowest they offer, which means it takes about a week to get my comics after they ship. You can have them ship immediately if you want but you're paying more for shipping.  This is just to offer up a different view from a different service. I've been very happy with TFAW but the shipping does hurt from time to time. If not for the 20% savings on pre-orders I wouldn't find it useful due to the shipping costs. In that case I'd probably just goto Comixology, but I like having issues I can sell or trade later if they aren't my cup of tea."
ImageComics,34aqh8,Selykg,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:00:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight! I'd never heard of that website, and I had a ton of fun looking at all their merchandise haha"
ImageComics,34aqh8,Selykg,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:26:53 2015 UTC,"No problem. I have been with TFAW longer than Image Direct has been out so I'm not very familiar with Image Direct, but it might be reasonably comparable. I keep using TFAW because of convenience at this point. There are a lot of other places that provide similar services.   Plus, they carry a lot of other stuff, too. And comics from other publishers. For me it makes sense since I do read a couple of comics from other publishers."
ImageComics,34aqh8,Selykg,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"So far, the only one I currently read outside of Image is Fables. It honestly is just a coincidence that that's the case, but I prefer story comics over superhero comics. I tried, but Batman was the only one I could get into."
ImageComics,349ojp,admiraltoad,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:20:47 2015 UTC,I thought the first tale of him arriving at the hospital was more interesting than the nam flashback.  So these are memories triggered by the space program he is part of? I don't really know. Might get the next issue just to try and figure it out.
ImageComics,3457vo,Kahrooch,4,Tue Apr 28 12:02:24 2015 UTC,Outcast #8  And  Red One #2
ImageComics,3457vo,BoogKnight,3,Tue Apr 28 14:24:27 2015 UTC,"Outcast #8, Red One #2, The Fuse #12, and maybe Pisces #1.  I think this might be it for the fuse, its a decent series but I don't like it enough to keep buying it, so I'm just finishing this arc."
ImageComics,3457vo,Legion564,3,Wed Apr 29 18:44:49 2015 UTC,"Nothing for me this week actually but I wanted your guys recommendations for maybe one more title on my pull list. I'm not too interested in adding  Sci fi or crime right now. What I'm currently reading is chew, East of West, Rat Queens, Southern bastards, and Velvet. If you could recommend something that hasn't been out too long that would be great."
ImageComics,3457vo,admiraltoad,2,Tue Apr 28 12:10:27 2015 UTC,If you are interested in trying out a horror series then my suggestions would be Wytches or Nailbiter. You can also check out the community's suggested reading list. Might give you some more options.
ImageComics,3457vo,GuyOne,2,Tue Apr 28 13:06:44 2015 UTC,I second Nailbiter. I am not pulling it. I have the first volume and just ordered the second. I don't really know where it is heading but man it had me almost immediately. The tone is great and it's really setting up to be an intense thriller.
ImageComics,3457vo,RANDALLFLA666,2,Wed Apr 29 18:48:33 2015 UTC,I suggest Spread. Its horror/ port- apocalyptic in a very cool way. 7 issues are out currently and a trade. I also suggest Nailbiter. The first trade is like $10 and only 11 issues are out i think.
ImageComics,3457vo,The_Catsnake,3,Thu Apr 30 11:48:10 2015 UTC,"Alex + Ada, They're Not Like Us n Wayward are all great! Image is the best!"
ImageComics,3457vo,aiptruss,2,Thu Apr 30 03:22:08 2015 UTC,Nobody else is feeling Rumble?  One of my favorite Image titles right now.  I gave the last issue a perfect 10 on AiPT.  Rumble #5 is a pretty damn satisfying conclusion to the first story arc as well.
ImageComics,3457vo,wvekng,2,Wed Apr 29 20:59:52 2015 UTC,I was really hyped for it when I saw the cover for #1. I eventually dropped it at issue 4. Even though the art was great I felt like not enough happened each issue to warrant me paying 3.50 each month.
ImageComics,3457vo,admiraltoad,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:10:29 2015 UTC,Just Outcast #8 and Pisces #1 for me this week. Did anyone get a chance to read Kaptara #1 last week? I thought it was pretty interesting. The artwork was top notch but overall it was well done.
ImageComics,3457vo,GuyOne,2,Tue Apr 28 13:05:16 2015 UTC,I read it and loved the art and story... But that main character. Still contemplating calling my comic shop and adding it to my pull list

ImageComics,3457vo,imbiat,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:05:49 2015 UTC,"do you identify with the label feminist or at least don't groan when you hear it? if so, i'd suggest you pick it up, you'll prolly enjoy it. the story is really just starting but there so far it is sci-fi future over controlling government world building and a prison planet with a diverse cast of women inmates."
ImageComics,3457vo,Koopnut,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:46:48 2015 UTC,"Kinda posting a bit late but I just finished reading my Image pulls  this week  Rumble #5  Bitch Planet #4  They're Not Like Us #5  Wayward #7  I loved them all this week, all of them seem to be picking up in story right now so that's awesome (especially because a few of them were pretty slow paced)  I also picked up Pisces #1 because Kurtis J Wiebe is gonna be at my LCS soon and I love Rat Queens. I have no idea what's happening in it, but I still liked it though!  Winner this week: definitely Bitch Planet #5"
ImageComics,33x38f,jj-jumpercables,7,Sun Apr 26 13:46:41 2015 UTC,"Image always puts their titles into trades as far as I can tell. They are by far the best company when it comes to publishing trades after issue 5 comes out. Invisible republic is only on issue 2 so it will be a few months until you see a trade for it, with the popularity of that title there most definitely will be a trade. Source : I work in a comic shop."
ImageComics,33x38f,alatar_,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:26:37 2015 UTC,Awesome.  Thank you for the reply
ImageComics,33x38f,beebzz,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:56:07 2015 UTC,Is it really popular? I like it a lot because I love indie everything and I think the story has the potential to go somewhere interesting but I'm surprised that anyone else would think about picking it up. What do you think the appeal with it is?
ImageComics,33x38f,alatar_,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not sure what the appeal is. It is a great book which is what I tell everyone that is interested in picking up a new series. Great writing and great artwork, you can't go wrong. The first time my shop ordered Invisible Republic #1, we only ordered about 15 of them and sold out on the same day. #2 we ended up ordering 35. They must be doing something right."
ImageComics,33x38f,beebzz,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:47:00 2015 UTC,I will say that the covers are spectacular. Not just the art but the graphic design and layout of the whole thing. Look at issue #4 cover
ImageComics,33x38f,alatar_,2,Mon Apr 27 19:03:08 2015 UTC,Damn. That cover is dopest dope I've ever smoked

ImageComics,33x38f,DrunkButcher,5,Mon Apr 27 19:55:01 2015 UTC,"I have found that with their Vol 1 $9.99 price points. I have picked a ton of trades off the shelf. Defiantly my #1 impulse buy when I'm at the shop. I gotta say Image has really impressed me, I went from buying nothing from them to probably 80% of my buys is from Image.  Doesn't help that Marvel & DC keep rebooting & I really have no idea what the hell is going on with Marvel & Battleworld, my God! But all in all Image, with the quality they keep coming out with is my #1 go to comic."
ImageComics,33x38f,destroytheheart,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"yeah, I hear you on Marvel.  I used to love X-Men back in the day, and the new Star Wars titles got me back into collecting a little bit again (even though they're not super great imo, but I can't resist new canon with Star Wars).  I was interested in looking around Marvel's titles, but it's so confusing.  The tons of #1s and this secret wars stuff just hasn't made me want to look into where to start.  Honestly, this was why I started picking up Valiant and Image stuff, and I haven't been disappointed with either."
ImageComics,33x38f,Selykg,2,Sun Apr 26 22:25:06 2015 UTC,"They also generally price vol 1 of their trades at $9.99, which is such a smart move. I can't tell you how many times I've picked up their trades because of this or passed over $19.99 vol 1 trades by other publishers. If you're trying to hook new readers this seems like the best strategy."
ImageComics,33x38f,destroytheheart,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"I preorder mine from tfaw.com and save 20% as well, so I generally get the first trade for $8.00. Shipping is a bit more, but I don't have a comic shop nearby so it's kinda my only option. I usually subscribe to my comics on there as well, save 20% and have the, shipped every two weeks. Depending on the haul it can be anywhere from $4 to $10 for shipping usually. Sometimes I envy people who have a store nearby, and hate people with several options nearby."
ImageComics,33x38f,Selykg,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:27:28 2015 UTC,"If it's any consolation, even as someone with two shops about 5 minutes down the road, I don't care about superhero comics or Dr. Who, so a lot of what I'm interested in doesn't even get ordered or is such a low priority that neither stock things until they hype catches up to them."
ImageComics,33x38f,beebzz,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:56:23 2015 UTC,Invisible republic is so good so far. This story feels really deep. I'm not sure I could wait for TPBs of this one.

ImageComics,33pfp5,pjl1701,-1,Sat Apr 25 13:11:45 2015 UTC,"I get down voted everyone I say it, but I hated red son.  It's was basically an exercise in re-skinning classic characters.  There was nothing in it that suggested the premise, a world with a soviet superman, was actually developed.  I mean they had stalin as a kindly uncle who said ""m'boy"".  Morrisons Nazi Uber man did a better job engaging the premise, and it was a one shot which opened with Hitler taking a shit!"
ImageComics,33pfp5,luckie_reubs,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:15:50 2015 UTC,Why don't you like Millar? I guess I'm only familiar with some of his work and not anything outside of that.

I am in the process of diving back in right now, but is very time consuming trying to find out what is currently running. There is no way of showing ""all current running series"" or something similar, you have to manually go from week to week for maybe two months or so, because some books might have a longer break between volumes. And every page takes ages to load."

ImageComics,33cg4u,bigteebomb,3,Tue Apr 21 12:02:22 2015 UTC,I'll be picking up Deadly Class #12. Remender is really not slacking on the quality on any of his stories.   I also just read the first issue of Descender. Which was fucking incredible. Epic Art. Epic Story. Can't wait to see what happens.

ImageComics,33cg4u,bigteebomb,1 point,Tue Apr 21 12:14:59 2015 UTC,MPH is very mediocre in my opinion. It's got some interesting action. But the story is rushed and the characters are not compelling at all.

ImageComics,3340bq,kblock9412,3,Mon Apr 20 04:48:05 2015 UTC,"As someone who's read the series through the trades, my biggest disappointment is that I didn't read the issues as they came out.  There's a lot of hype around the series, and it's all warranted. So honestly, I can't think of why you'd want to wait.  But, if the wait in between volumes is a problem for you, pick up one now, then get the second in a month or two. Space them out, but don't wait. You don't deserve that."
ImageComics,3340bq,kblock9412,2,Mon Apr 20 00:33:25 2015 UTC,"I ended up buying Volume 1 earlier. Was going to get both, but I was getting Volume 1 of: Manifest Destiny, The Wicked + The Divine, Black Science, The Woods, Southern Bastards, Sex Criminals, and C.O.W.L.  I've gotten a lot of DC trades over the past few days, and realized too late that I probably can't read through that many superhero comics without some non-cape shit to read between them. So, instead of buying new trades in series I already read, decided to start some new ones. I'm super fucking excited."

ImageComics,32swc7,suss2it,4,Thu Apr 16 13:23:59 2015 UTC,"Interesting article. I didn't realize that Brubaker and Phillips has signed that sort of deal with Image.    creator-owned comics have a wider audience now. In general people seem to be more accepting of them, given how many successes that Image has had recently.   I don't think ""creator-ownerd"" is the right term here. I doubt the increase in Image Comics readers over the last few years has had a lot to do with the fact that the series are creator-owned (at least not directly). It would have more to do with people moving away from traditional superhero comics and Image is really providing a huge selection of very different and excellent books for all genres."
ImageComics,32swc7,admiraltoad,6,Thu Apr 16 16:48:35 2015 UTC,That's why I love Image.   I'm fed up of the same galactic superhero nonsense
ImageComics,32swc7,deep1986,2,Thu Apr 16 20:37:12 2015 UTC,"And if I told my friends I was, they'd think I was just trying not to be fun. They don't understand why I read Image. Since I was a kid, these were the type of comics I always wanted but couldn't find."
ImageComics,32swc7,decoyF0XH,2,Fri Apr 17 08:32:40 2015 UTC,"Yup. I loved the idea of comics when I was younger, but super heroes didn't do it for me. Now I feel like I'm trying to make up for lost time.   There are so many more stories to tell beyond super heroes and I'm glad that Image is taking up that flag. Not that super hero stuff is bad, it's just that it doesn't really work for me personally."
ImageComics,32swc7,Selykg,4,Fri Apr 17 15:26:38 2015 UTC,I think the two concepts go hand in hand. Image itself doesn't really have to adhere to any kind of overarching story of universe series to series precisely because they're creator owned.  That in turn leads to higher diversity of themes and settings and stories.
ImageComics,32swc7,yourethegoodthings,2,Thu Apr 16 23:47:25 2015 UTC,"The massive growth in Image's appeal in recent years seems to come from three directions:    new comics readers who were never particularly interested in superhero stories in the first place, seeing Image as trustworthy 'brand' to latch on to. older comics readers like myself who developed a case of 'burnout' on the cape comics. Too many crossovers and events, rising cost-per-issue, decreasing page count and a growing sense of having seen the story patterns before - all of those things contribute to this.  fans following their favourite creators over from other publishers.    Not everything Image puts out is great (sometimes editors are a good thing) but, generally speaking, if I want to see top creators and bright young talent doing their best/most interesting work I will look to Image. There's a reason I pull more Image comics than any other publisher (it somehow reached a near 2:1 ratio of Image:not-Image)."
ImageComics,32swc7,deviden,2,Fri Apr 17 11:24:33 2015 UTC,I kinda fall under one and two. I used to be interested in comics as a kid. Lost interest after graduating. Just got back into it last year with The Walking Dead. Love the lack of super heroes in my Image Comics.

ImageComics,3248hi,ShinCoal,3,Fri Apr 10 13:24:59 2015 UTC,Really liked this book. Somewhat grounded work from Millar (relatively) and Quitely's art is gorgeous as always. However the thing that killed this series for me is how long it took to come out. I literally forgot I had this book on my pull because I had not gotten an issue in months. By the time I got back into it I just wished I had waiting on the trade.
ImageComics,3248hi,admiraltoad,2,Fri Apr 10 13:42:03 2015 UTC,"I get how you feel. I reread the whole thing when the final issue turned up specifically for that reason, which makes me think that doing Circle while Quietely potters away at Legacy will make Legacy Pt2 better.   It's a great book though, a very fresh-feeling superhero story for sure. Not quite as fresh as I found MPH, but still good. By the end of the series I was gagging to know more, and I think the ideologically-charged world they're in will only get more interesting, although it does feel like Circle isn't really required narratively and all the interesting stuff is really going to happen after Legacy Pt1 chronologically. But hey, it's Millar, it'll be good."

ImageComics,31qmaw,admiraltoad,3,Tue Apr 7 12:02:24 2015 UTC,"New Saga, always a good week.   I don't think I am going to continue with Big Man Plans, seems like a fun book and I love the Goon but nothing really grabbed me. I think I also am not going to bother with the new Jupiter's books (Jupiter's Circle). The loss of Quitely as the artists sucks and Legacy took sooooooooo long to come out. New Todd McFarlane series coming out too (Savior) I added that to my pull to check out. Could be interesting."
ImageComics,31qmaw,new_eyes_open,3,Tue Apr 7 12:55:47 2015 UTC,"Nameless and ODY-C in the same week - that's a lot of weirdness. Descender, Saga, and Southern Cross are on my pull. Not sure about The Surface, but it's tough to judge a premier issue, so I'll grab this new issue too."
ImageComics,31qmaw,ProximaMidnight,3,Tue Apr 7 14:34:55 2015 UTC,"This, plus Luther Strode. Didn't care for The Surface, just felt like it was trying too hard."
ImageComics,31qmaw,new_eyes_open,2,Wed Apr 8 15:05:21 2015 UTC,"It did seem very pandering, but the last couple pages were enough to convince me to grab issue 2 and see how aware of itself the story is, if that makes any sense."

ImageComics,31qmaw,admiraltoad,1 point,Thu Apr 9 09:51:04 2015 UTC,ODY-C is the only 1 I read and it was pretty damn interesting. It's like a drug trip in space based on the Odyssey.
ImageComics,31qmaw,CVance1,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:37:43 2015 UTC,"Like /u/admiraltoad , i've only read ODY-C, and I must say it is quite intriguing. I've kept up  with the whole series and it's very trippy, although sometimes the pictures are a bit confusing. I'd give it a try at least, especially if you've read the Odyssey."

ImageComics,31bjrk,Christasbooks,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:56:53 2015 UTC,"I read the first Volume of this not to long ago and absolutely loved it. The premise is intriguing and the serial killers are down right creepy. I don't read a lot of horror series so I couldn't say if it's the best one right now, but it is certainly one of the best I have read.   Also I bite my nails and it made me want to stop immediately."
ImageComics,31bjrk,new_eyes_open,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:05:29 2015 UTC,"Excepting the two gimmick issues (Bendis guest appearance, Hack/Slash crossover), the series is pretty good and this most recent issue made it considerably better. It's creepy and discomforting, as it's meant to be, and this arc is hinting at a pretty significant revelation, so now would be a good time to catch up."
ImageComics,31bjrk,itisntknown,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:59:24 2015 UTC,"I already loved the series, but that bed scene really put it over the top."

ImageComics,31bjrk,Baltron9000,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:49:26 2015 UTC,"I love this series. Something about it hits just right on the creepy factor. Serial killers are easy to mess up, but I feel like this series does a good job of making them both intriguing and terrifying. I feel like Nailbiter himself is second to the series, its not about him or the FBI agent, its about the town and just what exactly is it that makes these killers. Its a great puzzle, and I can't wait to have the answer revealed."
ImageComics,31bjrk,admiraltoad,2,Fri Apr 3 22:57:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. My fear is that they will try to drag the series on too long. I hope they have a game plan in mind for the end, though I've been enjoying the ride so far."
ImageComics,31bjrk,Baltron9000,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:18:13 2015 UTC,"Fingers crossed. After the newest issue's cliffhanger, they damn well better deliver. I don't need them to pull a Lost of sumshit. Answers!"

ImageComics,30yaf1,beebzz,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:19:09 2015 UTC,Yup. I preordered this one. As a BTTF fan it made sense.
ImageComics,30yaf1,Selykg,0,Tue Mar 31 21:47:26 2015 UTC,I think this book is over hyped. The fact that the movie rights were bought before the first issue is out is a little fishy. I think Millar is writing this as a package deal and I think it's going to take away from the comic. I also think the whole time travel thing is played out and with how strait forward this story looks I just don't see it being good. Murphys art is awesome though.
ImageComics,30yaf1,beebzz,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:18:28 2015 UTC,"I've not read any of issue 1 yet, I'm waiting until I have all 4 issues.   I don't think it really matters if it's over hyped. It's only 4 issues, it's a short story basically."
ImageComics,30yaf1,Selykg,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:42:53 2015 UTC,If I'm not mistaken it lasts longer than 4 issues. I think that just the first story arc. I have read the first issue and it's not bad but I'm just not a mark millar fan.
ImageComics,30yaf1,beebzz,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:09:38 2015 UTC,Tfaw.com shows it as a mini series consisting of 4 issues. Here's issue 4:  http://www.tfaw.com/Series/Chrononauts/Profile/Chrononauts-4-%28of-4%29___477790

ImageComics,30mzeh,snerfo,2,Sun Mar 29 02:20:08 2015 UTC,"If you want the cheapest way of reading the entire series, getting the 2 compendiums and the remaining 3-4 trades after that would be the way to go. That's how I caught up back when it hit issue 100. That said, like oblivious mentioned 118 has a really good recap and is supposed to serve as a jumping in point for new readers. You could always go back and catch up later if you really get into it."
ImageComics,30mzeh,Selykg,2,Sun Mar 29 16:46:28 2015 UTC,"I think I picked up the first 100 issues on comixology during a sale for like $50 or something like that.   Edit: I was a little off, 111 issues for $75"

ImageComics,30lzsk,Starkiller32,4,Sat Mar 28 16:29:47 2015 UTC,Ok good I have the same first impressions as you and am only on issue 4. Nice to know I'll probably like it way more after another read.
ImageComics,30lzsk,Legion564,2,Sat Mar 28 16:52:32 2015 UTC,I think the second read really helped win me over on this series.
ImageComics,30lzsk,SiegeTheBox,4,Sat Mar 28 16:54:44 2015 UTC,"I guess I should read it again. I picked it up when it first came out and, while I didn't dislike it, it didn't really grab me. It's been sitting on my shelf ever since."
ImageComics,30lzsk,Legion564,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:03:07 2015 UTC,I'm on issue 10 now and I reread the first arc again. Much better second time around.
ImageComics,30lzsk,SamC1803,3,Thu Apr 9 21:41:31 2015 UTC,My favorite story right now. I think the episodic format could be perfectly adapted to TV. It could be this generation's Star Trek or Land of the Lost.
ImageComics,30lzsk,beebzz,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:15:53 2015 UTC,For people that have read issue 12 how do you like the colorist? Dean white is off the book and he did a fantastic job.
ImageComics,30jgrw,ShinCoal,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:10:45 2015 UTC,I dropped this one after the first 2 issues. Was that a mistake or do any of you are still reading it think if it didn't grab me right away it's probably not for me? I don't recall specific instances but I remember thinking a few of the characters were making really dumb cliché decisions given their predicament.
ImageComics,30jgrw,new_eyes_open,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:31:26 2015 UTC,"It's a good series. But after collecting the first (of a planned three arcs), I'm planning on trade waiting for the rest. Too many other titles that I'd rather pick up monthly."
ImageComics,30jgrw,wishdasher,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:06:27 2015 UTC,"For me, this series started out with some amazing concepts and had all sorts of embedded political commentary; most telling were the magazine-style articles/entries within the story (as well as the maps at the start of some issues), all which helped deliver quite a bit more weight to a fairly standard rescue-the-girl plot.  But by the latest issue, it became quite a bit less sophisticated IMHO. I know the rescue story needed telling, but some of the more interesting political/social characteristics of the situation on Roche Limit proper were washed out. I don't mean to imply that the series wasn't good, but -- at least for me -- it did lose a bit of its fire."

ImageComics,30ihmr,rvgreen,2,Fri Mar 27 19:34:53 2015 UTC,Done. It's a bit more general but we can start with Image. I just don't think limiting to a publisher is worth it.   /r/issuebyissue/  If someone would rather do it as part of this sub that makes sense too. Happy to help either way.

It has gotten a bit more mention this past week on this forum so hopefully that continues.   I'm doing floppies though, seems to be worth it for me. If your LCS has issue 1 give it a shot, if you like it grab the rest. Otherwise, wait for the trade and see what you think. It looks like the last issue of this arc is #5 which just came out this week and the trade is scheduled for June 17th."

ImageComics,30bl60,Legion564,4,Thu Mar 26 16:22:39 2015 UTC,My two favorites right now are probably East of West and Black Science.  I also dig Deadly Class and Saga.

ImageComics,30bl60,GoldenFalcon,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:34:33 2015 UTC,I thought of that question people ask if you could pick three books to take on an island or whatever I think Chew is the only one that would be on that list for sure.

ImageComics,30bl60,jicty,4,Thu Mar 26 02:47:45 2015 UTC,It's a mystery about food and there are people with food related powers. Also it's based in a world where avian flu killed a bunch of people so the government bans chicken.
ImageComics,30bl60,Goldenbry,2,Thu Mar 26 03:33:13 2015 UTC,Dark humor. Very interesting read. My library had the first 2 omnibus editions to help me get caught up.
ImageComics,30bl60,MARBLECAEK1,5,Thu Mar 26 14:13:35 2015 UTC,"I really like wayward and it saddens me how little people talk about it. Issue 5 was amazing and I really want to see where the story goes. I love the charecters and setting so much, and I love how the bad guys are based on Japanese mythology. And add to that it has probably the most beautiful artwork out there. Seriously if you haven't read it the first trade came out yesterday. Pick it up."
ImageComics,30bl60,Selykg,2,Thu Mar 26 13:38:03 2015 UTC,I picked up the TP on a whim and I must say it is one of my favorite impulse buys to date.

ImageComics,30bl60,johnnybdinar,2,Sun Mar 29 20:27:07 2015 UTC,In my opinion the artwork and coloring is the best of any ongoing series.

ImageComics,30bl60,soonerzen14,4,Mon Mar 30 00:13:51 2015 UTC,The Wicked + The Divine. The blending of mythology and music is just as beautiful as the art itself.

ImageComics,30afma,beebzz,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:05:50 2015 UTC,Its got me interested. Its kind of a sci-fi/western/mystery.  Haven't gotten the chance to read this issue yet.
ImageComics,30afma,bisquemix,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:24:33 2015 UTC,I dig it. Cool Sci Fi read.
ImageComics,309lt8,The_Catsnake,3,Wed Mar 25 16:24:05 2015 UTC,Easily my favorite ongoing book. I hope they do it justice.
ImageComics,309lt8,REDDIT_RAMPAGE,2,Thu Mar 26 01:24:50 2015 UTC,"Same, Hope a Good Channel picks it up!"
ImageComics,309lt8,DrunkButcher,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:47:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. I grab the trades & it is fantastic!
ImageComics,309lt8,ActualButt,0,Sun Apr 26 21:19:15 2015 UTC,They won't. Expect something on the level of Supernatural or Lost Girl on Syfy. This would have been a great concept for someone like the Wachowskis. Too bad.
ImageComics,309ney,Starkiller32,2,Wed Mar 25 16:36:49 2015 UTC,Yeah.. The next issue got pushed back to the 20th of may...
ImageComics,309ney,scarwiz,3,Wed Mar 25 17:32:06 2015 UTC,Damn.
ImageComics,309juh,ShinCoal,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:09:11 2015 UTC,I've got the first two issues and love this one. It has a pretty interesting story so far and I'm really curious to see where it goes. I definitely recommend it.
ImageComics,304lim,admiraltoad,2,Tue Mar 24 13:04:43 2015 UTC,That's pretty neat.  I think this is a really good time to be talking about the themes from I Kill Giants.
ImageComics,304lim,yourethegoodthings,2,Tue Mar 24 13:12:03 2015 UTC,You mean mental health and the blur between fantasy and reality? Or how those with a certain culture (geekdom) can isolate themselves and alienate those outside of that circle?
ImageComics,304lim,CharlesFudgemuffin,1 point,Tue Mar 24 13:40:35 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see a movie version of I Kill Giants, so I'm really excited about this news."
ImageComics,304l2y,mrsaucytrousers,2,Tue Mar 24 13:00:25 2015 UTC,The Autumnlands: Tooth & Claw #5 - loving where this story is heading. Drifter #5 - probably swtich to trade waiting for this title Goners #6 - one of the quirkiest titles currently reading. Rumble #4 - cool story and great style. They're Not Like Us #4 - Top of the read pile every month. Wayward #6 - It's back. Everyone should grab the trade if they haven't read this yet. The Wicked + The Divine #9 - This arc has been slow but i want to see where it goes. Intersect #5 - Probably trade wait the next arc. Wytches #5 - great horror book but the story is getting a bit hard to follow.
ImageComics,304l2y,Koalacanth,2,Tue Mar 24 14:23:19 2015 UTC,"Three series I'm on the fence about:    They're Not Like Us #4 The Wicked + The Divine #9 Wytches #5   Eventually, I'll probably get the Criminal trade, and the Sex trade, but not right now."
ImageComics,304l2y,Selykg,2,Tue Mar 24 18:02:31 2015 UTC,"For me:   The Autumnlands: Tooth & Claw #5 Drifter #5 Intersect #5 (I cancelled this sub but had a few left already pre-ordered) They're Not Like Us #4 (again, cancelled my sub) Life After #8 Roche Limit Vol 1 TPB Empty #2 Low Vol 1 TPB Wytches #5   Non-Image:   Gotham by Midnight #5"

ImageComics,304l2y,Ser_Duck_The_Stout,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:37:07 2015 UTC,Light week for me;   The Autumnlands: Tooth & Claw #5 They're Not Like Us #4   Has anybody checked out Wayward yet? I'm thinking about grabbing the TPB this week as well.
ImageComics,304l2y,mrsaucytrousers,1 point,Tue Mar 24 13:56:18 2015 UTC,Definitely grab the TPB of Wayward. If you like Buffy but wished it were set in Japan then grab the trade and pick up issue 6.
ImageComics,304l2y,admiraltoad,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:00:53 2015 UTC,I like Zub (and am a HUGE Buffy fan) and have been enjoying Skullkickers but there was nothing in Wayward that grabbed me. I read the first 3 issue and then gave up.
ImageComics,304l2y,ShinCoal,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:07:12 2015 UTC,Image   Autumnlands: Tooth & Claw #5 - One of the best launches of past year. Dat art. The Wicked + The Divine #9 - Im starting to wonder wether or not Im just buying them for the covers.
ImageComics,2zzk80,Legion564,6,Mon Mar 23 06:31:41 2015 UTC,"My vote is Southern Bastards, Invincible, The Walking Dead & Ghosted. There is a 25 cent issue of Invincible coming soon this month that's supposed to be a jumping on point. It would give you a cheap way to see if you like that one at all."
ImageComics,2zzk80,snerfo,2,Mon Mar 23 14:05:38 2015 UTC,Southern Bastards. So. Good.
ImageComics,2zzk80,Selykg,6,Mon Mar 23 23:30:08 2015 UTC,"If you like sci fi check out prophet. Brilliant stuff, fantastic art and the story is a fun ride."
ImageComics,2zzk80,tariq89,1 point,Mon Mar 23 09:18:54 2015 UTC,Where would you start with prophet?
ImageComics,2zzk80,rvgreen,2,Mon Mar 23 16:04:17 2015 UTC,I would start with volume 1 remission. The comic has been rebooted in the last few years and looks and reads far better than the original 90s run. There are 4 volumes in total but remission gives you a great taste of the universe that it's set in and the characters which inhabit it
ImageComics,2zzk80,tariq89,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:59:20 2015 UTC,thanks
ImageComics,2zzk80,rvgreen,3,Mon Mar 23 19:59:00 2015 UTC,"As already mentioned if you like sci fi and Rick Remender (author of Black Science you're already liking) I recommend you Low by the the same author, it's a very good story with amazing art and the first TP will come out this week.  You might also enjoy Lazarus, a really nice action story set in a dystopian future where a handful of powerful families have replaced all forms of governments and are represented by a powerful warrior."

ImageComics,2zzk80,HeraldHS,2,Mon Mar 23 15:36:29 2015 UTC,Check out rat queens. I love this series.
ImageComics,2zzk80,flimflamslappy,1 point,Mon Mar 23 08:48:17 2015 UTC,Hey do you have an extra set of rat Queens? Singles seem to be super expensive
ImageComics,2zzk80,flimflamslappy,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:41:52 2015 UTC,I have the first trade. Got it for 9.99 at a LCS.
ImageComics,2zzk80,Uzumakian,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:46:57 2015 UTC,Wow this series comes out super slow
ImageComics,2zzk80,deathstarapocalypse,2,Tue Mar 24 15:27:22 2015 UTC,Rat queens is amazing! Check out Low as well if you like sci fi.
ImageComics,2zzk80,jpjtourdiary,2,Mon Mar 23 11:32:39 2015 UTC,"SPREAD. Post apocalyptic and very gory. The art style is insane! The story is real fun. I have a friend that's also into Low he says it really good, its done by Remender. I have yet to read it."
ImageComics,2zzk80,CharlesFudgemuffin,2,Mon Mar 23 12:00:00 2015 UTC,Manhattan Projects is what you need.
ImageComics,2zzk80,bisquemix,2,Mon Mar 23 12:41:56 2015 UTC,Saga and Alex + Ada are two of my favourite Image Comics.
ImageComics,2zzk80,admiraltoad,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:29:09 2015 UTC,There are some newer titles that I have personally enjoyed.  Birthright is good and the vol 1 trade came out this month. If you like Sci fi I liked Copperhead and Drifter.  This past week I picked up the first issues of Red One and Invisible Republic and they have piqued my interest.    I also recently read all of Invincible and it is very good if you like super hero books.
ImageComics,2zzk80,jicty,1 point,Mon Mar 23 07:20:30 2015 UTC,The community also does a suggest reading list every 6 months.
ImageComics,2zzk80,bunszellj11,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:53:39 2015 UTC,Wayward. It's actually one of my favorites but nobody seems to talk much about it. The 5th issue is amazing.
ImageComics,2zzk80,abercromby3,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:15:02 2015 UTC,"I was enjoying Wayward mostly for the setting and art up until the fifth issue, but man, that was awesome. I almost think they should have started the series off with that instead, or at least pushed it closer to the start. What a great hook. I am 100% on board with the story now."

ImageComics,2zzk80,Selykg,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:09:36 2015 UTC,"By this point, Invincible is easily the best ongoing comic I've ever read.   I also really enjoyed Sheltered which just ended. Also Southern Bastards, Autumnlands: Tooth & Claw, They're Not Like Us, and based on your other reading I'm sure you'd like Lazarus.   Obviously TWD is an awesome ride too."
ImageComics,2zzk80,Intermediate_Jesus,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:11:49 2015 UTC,Nameless and LOW are on my pull every month and I highly recommend them.

He's from here and we also go to the same comic shop so I will eventually get my issue #6 signed too. I got a print of issue #2, the spreadworm, signed also. Its the second one i had got from him because the first one got water damaged (a very interesting story behind that) This book has been my favorite since #1."

ImageComics,2zyo0t,upyours192,6,Mon Mar 23 00:59:42 2015 UTC,One thing that made me steer clear of the omnibus was the size of it. It was something that was too big for me to lay comfortable in bed and read.   If the size doesn't bother you then it is a great bang for the buck.

ImageComics,2zvo33,Koalacanth,3,Sun Mar 22 17:12:04 2015 UTC,I'm about to pick up the last trade of the Sword. Super good series. The Luna bros stories are dangerously addictive.
ImageComics,2zvo33,JimmyMcShiv,4,Sun Mar 22 21:36:41 2015 UTC,I can't really think of a completed Image series but you could try checking out Rising Stars or Midnight Nation by Top Cow or Locke and Key by IDW.

ImageComics,2zvo33,Noodles1312,0,Tue Mar 31 13:27:11 2015 UTC,The idea of Haunt was so cool that I wanted it to continue even when it started going downhill.
ImageComics,2zvo33,sammywhammyboy,2,Sun Mar 22 22:19:39 2015 UTC,I think it was just a lighter retelling of spawn almost. It felt like Todd didn't want to deal with the baggage of all the fucked up shit Al Simmons did but still wanted to write early Spawn type stuff.
ImageComics,2zvo33,mcarrara,2,Tue Mar 31 12:11:58 2015 UTC,"I think you're exactly right. Heavy stuff just kept happening. It was refreshing when the new team took over and all that crazy stuff happened, but it didn't stay fresh for long enough."

ImageComics,2zpoje,fridchikn24,5,Fri Mar 20 16:19:26 2015 UTC,Great overview of the story. This video hits all of the important concepts of this book. Definitely one of my favorite ongoings currently.
ImageComics,2zpoje,mrsaucytrousers,2,Fri Mar 20 16:52:53 2015 UTC,Just read Volume 1. Does anyone know when the next trade is scheduled to come out?
ImageComics,2zpoje,logrusmage,2,Fri Mar 20 16:57:25 2015 UTC,I'd say probably July/August.  I'm simply going by the timetable of current issue release dates and assuming it's going to be another 4 5 issue arc.  https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/birthright  Edit: Corrected issue count...

ImageComics,2zp2zo,admiraltoad,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:17:31 2015 UTC,I've heard very good things about this title. Thanks for the review.
ImageComics,2zp2zo,geekgentleman,1 point,Sat Mar 21 06:03:38 2015 UTC,I thought the fight scene was excessively long as well. My only thought is that it serves to demonstrate the rulers ruthlessness.
ImageComics,2zhonn,notalent117,8,Wed Mar 18 17:52:47 2015 UTC,Yeah i just got a new subscription to spawn and that's the first one I've received. Loved it cover to cover! I love the end when he transforms back into spawn. Too bad it was just a one shot.
ImageComics,2zhonn,deathstarapocalypse,5,Wed Mar 18 18:57:08 2015 UTC,The story is continuing with Spawn 251 though correct?
ImageComics,2zhonn,blakewhitlow09,5,Wed Mar 18 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"Correct. Same writer, same artist. DC and Marvel are notorious for starting books over with #1 to boost sales. McFarlane is proud that Spawn has made it to #250. He has said he'll never start the numbering over. But since the story was shifting gears and bringing Al back he decided to come out with a new ""#1"" issue.   That's Spawn Resurrection. It's a fresh start. A jumping on point essentially. Although I would recommend reading the whole series anyway. It's a damn (heh heh) good series."
ImageComics,2zhonn,blakewhitlow09,2,Thu Mar 19 02:09:22 2015 UTC,"Ah ok gotcha, thanks for clarifying, I've actually started Spawn but have only made it around 10 issues deep so far. It's such a daunting task to sit down and tell yourself you have 250 issues to catch up to haha. Then again I caught up on Invincible in like a week or two so I'm sure Spawn will be a similar story once I get hooked into the story."
ImageComics,2zhonn,unwittynamehere,1 point,Thu Mar 19 12:52:09 2015 UTC,"Here is the most comprehensive Spawn reading order on the internet. Tooting my own horn, I made it. I've read everything on this list. I'm 100% positive this order will make the story flow better. If you only want the most ESSENTIAL story and none of the extra stuff, PM me and I'll send it to you. Some of the one-shots and mini-series are vital to the story."
ImageComics,2zhonn,SynCig,2,Sat Mar 21 06:06:58 2015 UTC,"So I've been kind of out of the loop with Spawn since issue 60. I started to reread from number 1 again, but I also started Spawn: Resurrection. I have peeked a little here and there to get an idea of where everything's at though.  I don't think I'm spoiling anything with the issue breakdown below since if you read the first issue (even the title) it's kinda self explanatory as to where it takes place. Besides, even Todd McFarlane has given this info out in conversation.  What's got me confused it this...  1-185ish Al Simmons  186ish-250 Some other guy  250+ Al Simmons  Spawn Resurrection says it's continuing in Spawn 251, then what's the point of Spawn Resurrection? Is it another ongoing or was it a 1 shot? Do we now have 2 ongoing titles dealing with Al Simmons? I guess Spawn Resurrection can take off in the timer period where 186-250 was going on, but it seems odd to start a first issue with a ""get back in the action"" type event.  Edit: It's a one shot.. seems while I know how to read big words on a cover and everything in the book, I ignored that part on the cover..."
ImageComics,2zhonn,unwittynamehere,3,Wed Mar 18 21:00:09 2015 UTC,"Resurrection was a one-shot designed to be new reader friendly.  That way they'd pick up the one-shot (that has no big number on it), like it, and then continue reading with issue 251.  It's an interesting way to do a new jumping on point without relaunching the series.  We'll see if it works to bring in new readers or not."
ImageComics,2zhonn,Noodles1312,2,Wed Mar 18 21:43:16 2015 UTC,"D'oh, it does say ""One Shot"" right on the cover...   Alright then, that is a nice way to bring him back then. I can see how it can be a little confusing to the new reader in a sense, but I'd rather them keep the numbers going instead of setting up a Volume 2 or 3 since it's the core story line."
ImageComics,2zez61,skeever2,14,Wed Mar 18 00:41:17 2015 UTC,Is the art by Nick Dragotta? Carl looks like a young War from East of West.

ImageComics,2zez61,BoogKnight,3,Wed Mar 18 06:05:08 2015 UTC,It looks like the image of Roland and Susanna from The Dark Tower
ImageComics,2zez61,pukey-beautez,0,Wed Mar 18 01:35:03 2015 UTC,"This is not a good way to fight a horde. Plus she's just chopping heads, but she's not killing them."
ImageComics,2zgxzq,admiraltoad,3,Wed Mar 18 14:34:07 2015 UTC,"Sheesh, kinda ripped it to shreds there, yeah? I just finished reading it and honestly thought it wasn't that bad. Amazing? No, but still pretty fun and it looks like it could be pretty interesting.  Reviewer seems pretty much instantly negative because of Millar, though, so I imagine that had, at very least, a little bit to do with it."
ImageComics,2zgxzq,JakeTheHawk,2,Wed Mar 18 20:49:38 2015 UTC,As soon as the reviewer referred to the book as Millar's latest movie storyboard he laid his stance out for all to see and the book was never going to get a fair shake.  Clearly he's from the anti-Millar camp.  Millar is hit and miss but I'll usually give his stuff a chance.  Chrononauts didn't grab me story wise but I love Murphy's art.

ImageComics,2zcmx5,Ser_Duck_The_Stout,2,Tue Mar 17 19:51:45 2015 UTC,"Based on what I've read about it so far I think you could jump into this new #1 without having read the first run. Hickman and Pitarra set-up a detailed world(s) and mythology during the first 25-issue run and they are now going shift focus to different established characters in several different series, this being one of those. That being said, you might find yourself confused buy some of the characters, their motives and the mythology that has already been established. If you're interested, I would highly recommend reading the series from the beginning, it's really great IMO!"

Just as an example: Spawn #1, PGX graded at 9.6 is about to sell for <$40  There's not a whole lot that jumps out at me from that list.  I'd guess the Spawn stuff would be the most valuable and even then it's still pretty affordable."

ImageComics,2ywbi9,ShinCoal,4,Fri Mar 13 10:36:16 2015 UTC,"I consistently look forward to this title. Sailor's anxiety puts me on edge and I find it very easy to immerse myself in the story. Because of that, it creeps me out despite the relatively slow pace. The ferris wheel scene in particular basically had me clenching my jaw even though it's a flashback so you know it must turn out well. I really like Wytches, especially in the monthly format because I think the wait helps build up the tension."
ImageComics,2ywbi9,new_eyes_open,3,Sat Mar 14 01:39:21 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying it as well. It's creepy and leaving me wondering what's going to happen next.

Kinda bummed about that but I guess it means I have an open spot on my pull list soon."
ImageComics,2ywbi9,Selykg,3,Sat Mar 14 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda happy its a limited run. There won't be any temptation to drag out the story just because it's popular. It won't get driven into the ground. The whole concept is creepy, too, right down to the fact that the Wytches don't just randomly attack people. Somebody has to be so cold as to condemn somebody to their horror. I thought that was really cool."
ImageComics,2ywbi9,new_eyes_open,3,Sat Mar 14 02:02:52 2015 UTC,I guess you make a good point about the limited run side of things. Totally on you with the creepiness factor. It's pretty up there.
ImageComics,2ywbi9,Selykg,2,Sat Mar 14 13:31:47 2015 UTC,"In hindsight I might have better waited for it to conclude and picked something else, I didn't realize it was limited until I was almost done.  That said I got to run now so I won't have time to do something else. Sorry guys!"

ImageComics,2ywbi9,beebzz,2,Fri Mar 13 20:45:14 2015 UTC,I thought the art was really original and well done but I didn't really like it all that much and also felt like it didn't really go well with the kind of story it was trying to tell. I also think that for a horror/thriller story there is too much build up and not enough shit going down.

ImageComics,2ywbi9,mrsaucytrousers,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:20:59 2015 UTC,Arcs are just specific runs of a series. Basically each trade of a book is a story arc. This is an ongoing series so this will continue way past 6 issues.

ImageComics,2ywbi9,Selykg,2,Mon Mar 16 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"Aye, I was under the impression that it was an ongoing as well. It looks like it is but not a very consistent ongoing:  http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=50261   Do you plan on ""Wytches"" being a mini or ongoing series?  The idea is that we want to do five or six issues, take some time off -- the Brubaker model.

ImageComics,2yozar,Kahrooch,6,Wed Mar 11 16:45:51 2015 UTC,"I started from 1 about a year ago but stopped at 100. Recently, I started reading from where I left off. Issue 1 is a good place to start if you want to read about his back story and the introduction of his villains. If you start at the beginning, the only tie ins that matter are Angela, Violator, and maybe Blood Feud.  Todd McFarlane suggested which issue to start with if you're just jumping in now in a recent AMA... (Spoiler ahead!)   Wow... well, issue #185, the original Spawn character kills himself, and a new person has to take over, so from #185-250, there's the entire buildup of this new character until we get the original one back, at the end of issue #250. So that's not a bad table-setting place.    I haven't read resurrection yet so I can't say much about it."
ImageComics,2yozar,Sausage-and-Eggs,2,Wed Mar 11 18:58:52 2015 UTC,Resurrection basically just explains where al has been and why he's back. It's just a one shot.

It maintains all surprises and reveals and incorporates all miniseries.   If you want to jump into the more recent stuff, #185 is a jumping on point. And I wouldn't recommend jumping into the recent stuff like Resurrection because it spoils loads of stuff from the whole series. If you want the roller-coaster ride, start from the beginning.

ImageComics,2yjoot,Selykg,3,Tue Mar 10 13:01:40 2015 UTC,"Doing a quick search myself I found that Revelations 4:1 has a reference to a door   After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me, said, ""Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.""   Here's 5:1   I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals."

ImageComics,2yg3uq,Koalacanth,2,Mon Mar 9 16:29:42 2015 UTC,I just finished the second issue and am enjoying it. Seems like Morrison is drawing ideas from Zecharia Sitchin.
ImageComics,2yg3uq,Selykg,1 point,Sun Mar 15 23:38:13 2015 UTC,I have preordered the first 3 issues of this one and I couldn't even get through the first issue. She makes it sound interesting. Guess I'll give it a shot again when I have issue 3. Then decide to re subscribe.
ImageComics,2y6g5m,ShinCoal,4,Fri Mar 6 21:44:32 2015 UTC,This comic was awesome. I can't wait for #2. Reminds me of Mass Effect in a small way.

ImageComics,2y6g89,johnnybdinar,8,Sat Mar 7 06:17:08 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that's part of inclusiveness that hurts comics in general.   I buy comics because they're fun to collect and read. The value is what is inside the pages not the possible payoff by selling it at profit.
ImageComics,2y6g89,Selykg,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:45:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with this. It's cool to know that you have 1 of XXXX number of a first print run, but I know none of mine are going up in value.   If they do, it's because ZERO gets made into a TV show and people want everything having to do with it or they want a copy of The Autumnlands when it was still Tooth & Claw for like a day after it's first printing."
ImageComics,2y6g89,Selykg,1 point,Sun Mar 8 14:19:04 2015 UTC,"yup. If you want to save money or lose less, buy the trades. The value is what is between the pages. Not every comic turns into the walking dead and makes massive money for early low print run issues."

Oh he's out of a dream? Oh he's on a boat now? I felt the second issue actually helped fill in a lot of the blanks of the first issue, and it engaged me more. It set up a lot more of the mission, and though it's not straight forward, I was happy the second issue cleared up a lot of the confusion I had after reading the first. It's been fun thus far!"
ImageComics,2y5d0p,ch4nk,2,Fri Mar 6 19:45:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, issue one was not very good in my opinion. I don't think (though since it is Morrison and he has a habit of making everything important I may be wrong) the story was introduced effectively and I only felt confused at the end. I told myself I wasn't going to buy issue 2 but did so because I wanted to like the story. I am really glad that I did, this will be a ride."

It's laugh out loud funny and provocative. The art is 2nd to none. Even the letter section is awesome. Be warned it is definitely a mature title."
ImageComics,2y31ak,phaeton83,3,Fri Mar 6 06:38:27 2015 UTC,I second this. I picked up issue 1 with no idea what it was from my local shop just because of the ape motorcycle gang cover. I'm hooked now. It also has an awesome soundtrack that they upload to soundcloud every month.
ImageComics,2y31ak,patrickfahey,3,Fri Mar 6 06:43:36 2015 UTC,"The Humans is one of my favorite books right now. I love Tom Neeley's past work including Henry and Glenn Forever. It's a punk rock comic book about a motorcycle gang of Apes, the return of a member who's been fighting in Vietnam, and the gang (called the Humans) trying to make a move against a powerful organized crime system. It's brutal, hedonistic, satirical, funny, but doesn't feel like it's exploitative in a way that's problematic. It's a good grindhouse story. More so, it's a lot of fun.   Hunter S. Thompson's Hells Angels + Planet of the Apes + Easy Rider = The Humans."
ImageComics,2y31ak,johnpisme,2,Fri Mar 6 14:37:28 2015 UTC,"Dark Engine is super out there. I've read the first three issues, and I have the rest. I don't even know if I'd recommend it. But it's something weird, if that's what you're into. Rocket Girl is awesome. That's all I'll say. Three started off crazy strong in every respect. The ending fell flat for me, which was really disappointing. It wasn't a good or bad ending. Just... I don't know."
ImageComics,2y31ak,mehigh,2,Fri Mar 6 04:38:29 2015 UTC,Strange Embrace is one of the best horror comics you will read.

ImageComics,2y31ak,Christasbooks,2,Fri Mar 6 09:22:05 2015 UTC,"I read the first issue of Dark Engine and Rocket Girl.  Dark Engine was weird, gross, and hard to follow.  I can't think of any reason to recommend it to someone, unless that's what they're into.  Rocket Girl seemed like a comic I could like if in the right mindset.  The premise is neat, the writing is decent, and the art is good.  It just wasn't my thing so I didn't read past #1.  I have heard good things about Three, but I can't say anything from my own experience."
ImageComics,2y1w0v,number_1_swimfan,5,Thu Mar 5 19:17:50 2015 UTC,It was worth every penny.  The story and art are spot on.  Its been a while since a comic I looked forward to exceeded my expectations after I read it.  Can't wait for #2!
ImageComics,2y1w0v,busboysrule,2,Thu Mar 5 19:40:46 2015 UTC,"Just got an opportunity to read it this evening.  Agreed that it far surpassed all expectations I had.  The story just felt right - it didn't feel hokey, it didn't feel like too much.  Well written, and I'm in the same boat as you - can't wait for issue #2!"
ImageComics,2y1w0v,sammiereads,3,Sun Mar 8 02:01:21 2015 UTC,It's so perfectly sci-fi. I think this will quickly become my new favorite title! Lemire is the best!

I don't know what happened further to be fair) in a case of domestic violence with/against his wife.  So, its a good thing the book is back, the delays were long and tedious. That said I'm removing it from my pull list. Its not that I'm not sympathetic to why Roc was removed, but I just CAN NOT give a damn about Sejic his art. I know hes a favorite around here but his art doesn't do anything for me. I'm going over to trade waiting the series. What a damn shame."
ImageComics,2y0dik,starfleetbrat,2,Thu Mar 5 10:38:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of the art either. I was going to buy the Trade anyway, but from what I have seen of the art so far I don't like it as much as I did the art in the earlier issues. I'm not sure I can put my finger on why entirely, but it somewhat feels like a lot of the... attitude? sass? something in the features of the characters has gone, and they look a lot softer now. Its like the lines aren't as harsh or something. Which is not a bad thing per se, I just prefer the previous look. I'm sure the story will still be good though, and that is why I'll still buy the TPB. I just... don't feel as excited about it?"
ImageComics,2y0dik,DriveByUppercut,1 point,Sun Mar 8 07:36:54 2015 UTC,"Seijic's art is definitely heavily stylized so I can understand some people just not finding it alluring. To each their own. The aspiring artist in me is in awe of how quickly he can dish out these paintings on his youtube channel and his creature design if you compare it to other comics is flawless, very great imaginative demon-like beasts. Seijic also usually does his own color and speech so there's also that. His efficiency and workflow is up there with Fiona Staples in terms of digitally made comics I'd say. Just listing some of the reasons I personally like it a lot haha, What's an art style you personally enjoy?"
ImageComics,2y0dik,logrusmage,3,Thu Mar 5 22:01:42 2015 UTC,"I, for one, looooove Seijic's art. Like, super love. I'm really happy he's on this book, and I can't wait to get a death vigil trade."

I am a fan of revenge stories but this one just made me depressed.  BUT I will say it is beautifully drawn and I bet many people will dig it.  Just not for me.
ImageComics,2xok24,KlutchAtStraws,4,Mon Mar 2 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"Going to be totally honest here...  I thought the first two issues were complete crap. Confusing, bad writing, non-existant pacing, a ridiculous amount of pandering...   I just don't think Fraction is a great writer. He's just a good writer who panders really hard to a crowd that doesn't get pandered to often in comic books.  That being said, I'm not hating on anyone who enjoys his work. It clearly isn't bad writing. I just... really don't get why the fanbase seems to be in love with him. I tend to think its just a very vocal minority.  Also, the blatant in your face radical feminism pamndering (comparing Helen of Troy to a bound BDSM slave? seriously? She was worshipped, and decided on her own to folow Paris to Troy...) is really really annoying."
ImageComics,2xok24,logrusmage,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:06:53 2015 UTC,"Well... I love Hawkeye and Casanova but those are the only things of Fraction's that really grabbed me until this.  I really liked the depiction of the crew of the Ody-C battling the Cyclops in #3.  They were soldiers who were fighting and dying in some pretty horrific ways which you don't tend to see.  But yeah, I can see the book is not going to be for everyone."
ImageComics,2xok24,logrusmage,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:05:27 2015 UTC,"They were soldiers who were fighting and dying in some pretty horrific ways which you don't tend to see.   Why don't you tend to see soldiers die in horrific ways? Or do you mean female soldiers specifically?  To be perfectly honest, I was instatnly turned off by the need to read a giant timeline to even have a chance of figuring out what the hell was going on in Issue 1."
ImageComics,2xok24,logrusmage,2,Tue Mar 3 01:12:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, women soldiers.  I'm used to the Gamorra, Zealot, Black Widow type of female character who are often there as fan service but in Ody-C the women are grunts and they get crushed and torn apart which isn't something I really recall seeing in comics."
ImageComics,2xok24,esoteric311,1 point,Tue Mar 3 07:20:50 2015 UTC,"I'm used to the Gamorra, Zealot, Black Widow type of female character who are often there as fan service   FYI, this is incredibly insulting to fans of those characters. The fact that they're hot hardly makes them ""only"" fanservice. There aren't exactly a plethora of ugly or fat male heroes you know. In fact... I really can't think of any ugly male humanoid heros that aren't comic relief characters in traditional superhero comics.    but in Ody-C the women are grunts and they get crushed and torn apart which isn't something I really recall seeing in comics.   That's to the comic's credit. Most mediums don't depict women as cannon fodder, mainly because throughout history they've pretty much never been cannon fodder. However, it is nice to see a comic go beyond historical probability. It would be nicer, however, to see it in a comic that isn't just a gender-swap of an ancient story. It isn't nearly as impactful as it could be because the women in Ody-C are just stand ins for historical men. It is particularly ineffecitve because Fraction killed off the entire male gender before the story began.

I thought it was an interesting image on it's own, it fit in the whole trippy feel of the comic. The biggest issue was the artwork occaisionally, with the fact that i couldn't completely figure out what the hell was going on. It made an impact on me, and I think I'll keep following it if only because the character of Oddyssia was great (i think the crew needs to be drawn a little better) and it was pretty good execution."

I haven't read the actual Odyssey in a while, but I'm guessing something similar might've happened in terms of someone ""owning"" Helen. That might've been what Fraction was going for. He also could've just been flipping it and making it accurate for a gender-bent world. Maybe he just really likes BDSM imagery in this instance. I thought it added to the surreal trippy qualities."

Regardless of whether she was originally abducted or seduced, she was viewed and treated as a Queen before she ran off with Paris to Troy voluntarily.    He also could've just been flipping it and making it accurate for a gender-bent world.   That would have the women fighting and dying directly FOR men, to protect them/plunder them as valuable prizes.    I thought it added to the surreal trippy qualities.

In a world that isn't written by a gender studies major, that would make men insanely valuable.   I don't think it's pandering to anyone. It's just something that is. Maybe it adds to the character of the person who owns him?   I don't see how you could possibly think it isn't pandering at all. I could see maybe thinking it adds to someone else's character, and that's fine, but it was quite a blatant ""hurrdurr men used to treat women like slaves"" pander to the feminist crowd that loves Fraction."

BDSM implies that it's a consensual thing. Who knows, maybe it's what He wants, maybe it's just a silent slave thing and without men, they decide to treat it as a pet.

This is a horror book after all. Ever since watching the Exorcist as a kid I've always been terrified of demonic possessions. Such a cool and creepy concept. I know they are already in talks to do a TV show, and that is something I would love to see. Especially if it ended up on FX, AMC or HBO."

It's not rushed and Kirkman isn't throwing us sensationalist distractions like the gore in Walking Dead. Always been a big believer that great horror is slow, escalates over a period of time, and doesn't just come right out and show the evil. Outcast gives us little bits of the demon, but just enough to make us want to know more. Don't mind the set-up issues because the pay-off is gonna be awesome."

He is merely a comic book character in the Invincible Universe. The Science Dog Universe is a fictional universe with the Invincible Universe. It is like Inception. I wonder what kind of comics Science Dog reads?"

ImageComics,2wfh5o,Ser_Duck_The_Stout,2,Thu Feb 19 15:44:23 2015 UTC,"Image comics  Best series of 2014: Saga - Sorry to be boring, but it's the one I'm still most excited about and the 3rd arc really pulled out of the writers writing about writers writing head up its own assedness nosedive of the second arc.  Also apologies for that metaphor tossed salad.  Best new series of 2014: Wicked and the Divine - I've given everything Image launched last year a try and only Wic\Div and Birthright have made me audibly say ""Wow!  Holy shit!"" and Birthright is too new of 2014.  Best Writer of 2014: Warren Ellis - mostly for taking huge risks with Supreme Blue Rose.  Best Artist of 2014: Tula Lotay - Again for Supreme Blue Rose.  She somehow balanced clean and readable with all sorts of supraliminal elements, then switched styles once or twice per issue.  It's a lot of gymnastics I'm very impressed.  That said, there is a deep bench of really really great artists going on in Image books lately  Best cover of 2014: The Wicked and the Divine #1 - By now, the imitation Social Network expressionless portrait with text over it is a little played out, especially after December had all those McKelvie\Wilson covers, but Wic\Div #1 reignited my love of comics, and the cover was a big part of it.  Non Image comics  Best series of 2014: X-Force - Spurrier tends to overwrite and seems to think his portmanteaus are more clever than they are, but I'll be damned if I wasn't surprised by how much I was invested in what happened to a lot of characters that I frankly don't like.  There's something to be said for that.  Best new series of 2014: Ms. Marvel - It gets a lot of rightly earned praise and is right in Marvel's wheelhouse.  G. Willow Wilson has shown that she and the concept have some staying power.    Best Writer of 2014: Matt Fraction - He's got a lot of irons in the fire, and only Satellite Sam is a stinker.  Best Artist of 2014: Pulido - this is a tough one for me.  Nobody's interiors really blew me away.  At least Pulido was trying something different and new.  Best cover of 2014: Amazing Spider-Man #1 - I don't read Spider-Man, but this cover is just incredible.  Non comics  Best album of 2014: Completement Fou - Yelle manages to strike a balance between evolving her sound and holding true to what she and Grand Marnier have been doing all along.  Honorable mentions: St. Vincent - St. Vincent, and FKA Twigs - LP1.   Best song of 2014: St. Vincent - Birth in Reverse - Hard to pick a best song, but I'm always happy to hear this one.  Best movie of 2014: Birdman - I was actually angry with someone for suggesting that I wouldn't like this movie.    Best book of 2014:  I really don't keep up with current books as they're released, but the best book I read this year was A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway"

If you're a fan of strange fiction and art I would read the series in its entirety. I've been a Spawn fan for a long time but what started me out was that weird middle section in the series that is less-sensicle and more apeshit. Also if you are a fan as of art and oddities like I stated above you should really start with Hellspawn, mainly because Ashley Wood is a genius and the comics are entirely about art and emotional response and less about contrived story like Spawn can be at times."

Buy mercandise from my book about a superhero who fights people with a bow instead, because violence is bad.""  Also, BDSM is not abuse, and even though it's portrayed badly in 50 shades doesn't mean it's condoning actual abuse. It's just a bad movie."
ImageComics,2vzsle,Batduck,8,Mon Feb 16 02:21:42 2015 UTC,BDSM done right is not abuse. BDSM as portrayed in 50 Shades IS.
ImageComics,2vzsle,Batduck,-2,Mon Feb 16 02:23:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but to say that the movie glorifies domestic abuse is a pretty big leap. It's bad at showing BDSM, but that doesn't mean that it's enabling child abuse. This just seems sensationalistic.  Not to mention the hypocricy of a cape writer complaining about violence in the media. I don't know, this just rubs me the wrong way."
ImageComics,2vzsle,Batduck,4,Mon Feb 16 02:50:11 2015 UTC,"Well, making a movie starring an abuser could be seen as glorifying, given that it's not in an antagonist role or resulting in any negative consequences.  Also, Fraction's writing goes way beyond capes, and he's not actively writing ANY cape books at present, instead focusing on such sex-positive titles as Sex Criminals."
ImageComics,2vzsle,lunobear,-1,Mon Feb 16 03:05:55 2015 UTC,"Christian Gray isn't an abuser in the context of the movie, just in the context of the real world, because of poor writing choices. Sex Criminals is a sympathetic portrayal of bank robbers, and what's more, they're bank robbers IN THE CONTEXT of the book.  I'm not saying I have a problem with Sex Criminals. Sex Criminals is fine. I just think it's a gigantic reach to say that 50 Shades says that beating your wife and children is the same thing as not agreeing on a safe word before getting kinky."
ImageComics,2vzsle,beardead,2,Mon Feb 16 03:16:26 2015 UTC,"Men going around in capes as vigilantes isn't a problem that plagues people in the real world, or something that a disturbingly large fraction of society believes is OK.  Domestic violence and violence against women in general is a HUGE problem, and having it normalized in mainstream media even more than it already is can have real world consequences."
ImageComics,2vzsle,Batduck,1 point,Mon Feb 16 06:39:31 2015 UTC,"The complaint is not violence in the media. He says that it normalizes abusive relationships. Context is key here. Unless you wanna point me to the chapter where Hawkeye shoots his girlfriend with an arrow, your analogy isn't really very sound. I get it, but you're missing the point.  Also, consider this; 50 Shades of Grey is a first exposure to BDSM for a vast quantity of people. BDSM is not portrayed properly in 50 Shades of Grey. The portrayal of BDSM in 50 Shades of Grey is abuse. It is a part of mainstream media. The general public are already swept up in it. These people think this is what BDSM is, and now that 50 Shades is mainstream media, the BDSM as improperly portrayed in 50 Shades of Grey is very likely to become the norm, by definition of ""mainstream.""  Anyway, the cause and intention here is good, what's the trouble? He's essentially asking that you donate to charity (while getting something physical out of it). Donating is a very personal thing. It is by no means mandatory. Clearly you do not want to take part in this, and that's fine. Just don't do it."
ImageComics,2vzsle,beardead,1 point,Mon Feb 16 08:17:13 2015 UTC,"The problem 50 Shades will cause isn't that a guy will see it and think, ""You know, I was feeling pretty bad about beating the shit out of my wife and son, but now I feel kind of okay with it."", it's that somebody's wife is going to get curious and want to try BDSM, and her husband is going to go along with it, not really knowing what he's doing, and halfway through, the wife's going to realize that she hates it, and it's uncomfortable, and she wants it to stop, but she's not going to be able to communicate that, and the husband isn't going to pick up on it.  ""Combating"" 50 shades by donating to a charity for victims of domestic abuse doesn't actually do anything to solve the problem 50 Shades causes. The way to fix the harm of the movie is to educate people on proper BDSM, or recommend (or even create, if you happen to be a famous comic book writer) better BDSM fiction.  I'm not saying donating to the charity is a bad thing, I'm saying that the connection to 50 Shades is tenuous. He's offering a solution to a different problem than the one he's worried about."

Their biggest characters are imprisoned and couldn't touch the success of Todd, Image, and Spawn. He is like a teenager throwing the finger at Mom and Dad.

It featured Spawn getting pulled into a dream like world with a small armadillo character. I think the armadillo was another creator owned comic and the artist was writing this story.   During the story it talks a lot about creative freedoms within the changing comic industry. The super heroes were never really disused, just showed the limitations some of the old heroes have on their stories.  It was a weird issue in which Al Simmons has a happy ending with his wife.

I'm jim dog anal about wanting to know all the origin stories and stuff. It's really good even though some of the art is a bit dated. Even with that said though, a lot of the art is kickass. Hope this helps"
ImageComics,2uto4e,Roach-King,3,Thu Feb 5 02:02:38 2015 UTC,Issue 250 is a good jumping on point. It's the end and the beginning of a new direction for Spawn. I would keep up with the monthly releases while reading old trades or sources on the Internet to fill in the gaps.

Intriguing concept, great characterization; I implore all of you to give this one a chance so we get a lengthy story out of it. I do have one question though, for anyone who might have more than just my vague understanding of the condition. The narrator has Asperger's syndrome and I was wondering since we get his internal monologue (which I thought was a bold move on the part of the writer), how authentic does he seem? I know there isn't like a strict checklist of criteria or anything but, say the writer never came out and said directly that the character had Asperger's - would any of you assumed he did anyway?"

I really appreciated how Gillen took the whole worship of pop icons to the far extreme and actually made them gods. I work in a concert venue, and I didn't know what the word ""crazy"" meant until One Direction played at out building. Maybe because of that connection, I resonated a lot more.  I also genuinely like Luci's story. Just Lucifer in Paradise Lost, Luci did something wrong and she genuinely tried to take the high road. She went to the court, she tried to pay for her crime. But in the end, she's still a reincarnation of Lucifer, and fall she must."

ImageComics,2u6x0u,ShinCoal,1 point,Fri Jan 30 12:35:39 2015 UTC,"I really love everything Remender has put out this past year. His stories are always so in depth and have so much relatable detail. In Deadly Class, for example, he contrasts the seriousness of an assassin school and relationships with shitting yourself at a comic book store.   As far as reinventing himself, I absolutely think he is. Every story he does keeps that element of Remender storytelling at its core but they choose to explore a different philosophy of life and a different way of looking at characters. Black Science is easily one of my favorite series right now, I honestly have a hard time waiting each month for the new issue.   I look forward to reading his stuff for a long time."

I havent read Black Science and havent finished the first issue of Deadly Class yet, but that seems to be going better for me than Low did. I feel like Remender should have won this though simply because he has 3 books for Image that fans all love, while many other writers only have 1 or 2."

It's way too early to judge, I have to wait until I read a handful of issues of anything Hickman writes before I can see if it's going anywhere or not. I'm intrigued by this, but I'm starting to notice a lot of cliches he recycles in everything he does that's starting to get a little old (mysterious white-hair-white-skin character, strong theme of death in an abstract way, mystic figures with Arabic-sounding names). It didn't immediately pull me in the way some of his other series have but I'm going to keep an eye on it either way."
ImageComics,2u0bap,new_eyes_open,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:08:46 2015 UTC,"Just got done reading this issue and you can count on at least 1 more staying onboard. Awesome start. You can tell right from the opening sequence that Hickman had it very clear in his head the style of story he wanted to tell. Not that it needs to or should, but those pages could translate verbatim to live action. Also, I definitely heard the colonel's voice as R. Lee Ermey and that just added to the awesomeness."

Bitch Planet #2 - I want to see where this book goes. So much hype off of the first issue really puts the pressure on this book being good. Death Vigil #6 - Love this story and cast of characters The Dying and the Dead #1 - a new Hickman book about elderly people definitely has me intrigued. Graveyard Shift #2 - The story and art for issue one was very mediocre. I'll probably drop this if the issue isn't good Rasputin #4 - I love the artwork and that it tells the majority of this story. Revival #27 - I've got some catching up to do on this book. Sex Criminals #10 - Best book i'm currently reading. Can't wait to read the conclusion of the second story arc. They're Not Like Us #2 - Loving this book so far. It's if the X-Men didn't wear costumes and only cared about themselves.

ImageComics,2tanfn,bunkermatt,3,Fri Jan 23 06:09:05 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. I think a lot of people who read comics hear of Image, hear that it is putting out good books, but are still scared to venture away from DC/Marvel because they dont know the characters."
ImageComics,2tanfn,SpaZticHero,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:37:21 2015 UTC,"Ya see I don't think thats too much of an issue. Image consistently put out a constant stream of new series, so if something sounds good they can quickly attach to it.  Additionally, with the introduction of the $1 issue ones and the $10 volume collections, any lapsed readers who missed the boat, often don't have too struggle to either find or pay for past issues, further incentivising them to try something new."
ImageComics,2tanfn,MaxDunbar,7,Thu Jan 22 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think its necessarily a question of which is best.  The great thing about comic books right now is that they are getting more diverse, and Image does have a massive role in that.  However, if you're a fan of super heroes and other super powered characters, chances are that you'll want to go with some Marvel and DC comics.

ImageComics,2t9qin,DomoMadSock,2,Thu Jan 22 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way about Nightly News by Hickman. I've been interested in Transmetropolitan for a while, I might need to bump it up a few spots on the wish list."
ImageComics,2t9qin,EggzOverEazy,1 point,Fri Jan 23 05:00:21 2015 UTC,"I HIGHLY recommend it. It has, by far, the best writing and dialogue out of any comic I have read thus far. I'm still somewhat new to comics, so I'm not sure how its compares to other series, but its definitely a series that I would say to try out.   What's Nightly News?? Never heard of it. But I do love Hickman! East of West is the actual shit."
ImageComics,2t9qin,DomoMadSock,1 point,Fri Jan 23 05:21:59 2015 UTC,"East of West is my favorite thing, so I looked for more Hickman. Nightly News is a militant take on anti-media. Its shocking how ""real"" Hickman makes his terrorism."
ImageComics,2t9qin,EggzOverEazy,7,Fri Jan 23 10:29:32 2015 UTC,"Check out ""Fables"" as well. Very good series."
ImageComics,2t9qin,jordaniac89,3,Thu Jan 22 15:43:32 2015 UTC,"Since you're already into Image stuff, check out: Black Science (my current favorite), East of West, Rat Queens, Deadly Class, Drifter, Rumble, Trees, Wytches, and The Wicked and The Divine. For a start."
ImageComics,2t9qin,SamC1803,2,Thu Jan 22 13:09:37 2015 UTC,"I agree on all of those, especially East Of West. Really tried to warm up to The Wicked and The Devine. Didn't succeed."

For currently active titles, I'd recommend Rat Queens, Southern Bastards, and Manifest Destiny. For completed titles, I'd suggest Fatale and Girls. I also enjoyed Nowhere Men, but I'm not sure if it's continuing or what."

ImageComics,2t9qin,TheRear1961,1 point,Thu Jan 29 23:23:21 2015 UTC,"Shutter, Manifest Destiny, The Autumnlands: Tooth & Claw, SEX, and East of West are all series that need to be checked out once you've read what you have. Five Ghosts and Zero are great too. IDW has Winter World and Return to Dreamland which are great. Vertigo has Fables, Wolf Moon, Dead Boy Detectives, and Fairest. I know I'm leaving some out but these are all amazing series. You have a good start though.  Edit: Oh and anything by the Luna Brothers. Start with the complete collection of Girls."

ImageComics,2tbck0,ShinCoal,4,Thu Jan 22 18:51:40 2015 UTC,"I enjoy Saga, but I can't help but being slightly annoyed by it always winning by a massive margin, it feels like posterboy syndrome.  I would have rather seen East of West (or Deadly Class, but that one already got best new series so whatever) win, but alas, can't have it all.  I do think that Saga keeps on being solid, people complained about volume 3 being somewhat slow (which was probably needed), but BKV and Staples followed up with volume 4 which was a massive thrillride. Pretty excited for volume 5."
ImageComics,2tbck0,dopebob,1 point,Thu Jan 22 19:01:28 2015 UTC,"I was just about to post my article about my favourite comics of 2014 because Image were responsible for the majority of them but saw this thread so though it would be more appropriate here. I enjoyed East of West, Deadly Class and Manhattan Projects more than Saga. Saga is so accessible though, I can see why it's popular."
ImageComics,2tbck0,Koalacanth,3,Fri Jan 23 19:27:29 2015 UTC,"I don't really have much love for Jonathan Hickman's writing. I read fifteen issues of East of West trying to figure out what was so great about it. Couldn't get into Manhattan Projects past a few issues. The language seems so convoluted, and self-important.  If not Saga, I would probably have voted for Rat Queens or Fatale."
ImageComics,2tbck0,dopebob,1 point,Fri Jan 23 20:06:34 2015 UTC,"It is a different style of writing, different strokes I guess. I like stuff with more complex dialogue, I like other things too, just depends what mood I'm in. The only thing about Hickman that gets on my nerves is at the beginning of his runs when he often just throws you in half way through the story and you have no idea what's going on for a while. Once you get past that I love it though, and it's kind of cool not having the beginning being slow with introductions of everyone and what's going on."

ImageComics,2t249y,aiptruss,1 point,Tue Jan 20 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"I just reviewed Rumble #2 for AiPT and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  I like the slow unraveling of the story and the still-cryptic motives of the creatures, although how it all comes together in the end will be interesting to see.  (Edit:  Image Comics just posted my review up on their FB page.  Aww yeah.)  My friend reviewed Autumnalnds and he claims to like it just as much as Saga.    Good time to be an Image fan."
ImageComics,2t249y,new_eyes_open,1 point,Tue Jan 20 20:30:11 2015 UTC,Looks like it's Drifter #3 and The Autumnlands #3 for me. Somehow I missed Drifter #2 and had to order it through my LCS so hopefully that'll be in tomorrow as well and I can decide whether or not I like this title. The Autumnlands is off to a good start as far as I can tell. Busiek isn't a name I was familiar with but it turns our he's got a pretty solid reputation and the artwork is beautiful so I imagine I'll be staying on this one.  Anyone got any recommendations for other books coming out this week? What are you looking forward to that I should check out?
ImageComics,2t249y,N0ninja,2,Tue Jan 20 16:21:19 2015 UTC,"For further reading of Busiek's stuff, I recommend either Superman: Secret Identity or Astro City: Life in the Big City. I have been a fan of his for a while now."

I hopped into the series about a month ago so I experienced the first 24 issues in trade form (which were amazing) however I feel like I rushed through them too quickly.

I tend to shy away from superpowers and big guns. I appreciate that Southern Bastards had neither, but was still able to tell a compelling story about good guys and bad guys.

ImageComics,2rzjgt,klyonawesome,4,Sat Jan 10 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"Most volumes come out 2-3 months after the last issue they contain. Most volumes run 6 or 7 issues so about every 8 months is a new volume assuming there are no breaks in the release of the series.  Edit: To speak to if it's worth waiting that is preference. I personally collect issues but wait until I have a few to read because I usually feel unsatisfied just reading one issue. Also waiting a month between installments usually mean I forget what happened in the last issue. So I prefer to read a trade amount of issues, but prefer collecting the issues. So if you want to save money go trades. If you like knowing things as soon as they are available the go issues."
ImageComics,2rzjgt,seraphrunner,4,Sat Jan 10 20:16:07 2015 UTC,"I dunno what the other guy was saying. Generally speaking, a image will release a trade the week before the next arc starts.

ImageComics,2rzjgt,JimmyMcShiv,2,Sun Jan 11 05:49:50 2015 UTC,"Isn't that bundle insane? I saw the BTA when it was $13... I decided it was worth $5 to just get the top tier. Now it's only less than $3 difference, so it's not going to go down. PLUS, more will be added. I bet it will be Walking Dead related, at least."
ImageComics,2rzjgt,GoldenFalcon,3,Sun Jan 11 19:00:35 2015 UTC,Personally I thing Image is one of the best when it comes to trades. I get all my image titles in trades but that is just me. Saga just released the Hardcover special edition which is the first 3 volumes in one. Reasonably priced at $35-$40 as well.
ImageComics,2rzjgt,skinnyKss,2,Sat Jan 10 20:45:46 2015 UTC,"I prefer trades. I don't mind waiting to get the books, especially since I spend the money I save on more books! If you wait longer you can even get the deluxe editions for about the same price per issue (on amazon). Btw if you like Hickman, his fantastic four run is one of my favorite things ever. Manhattan Projects is also pretty great."

ImageComics,2rrpgj,window360,3,Fri Jan 9 03:09:35 2015 UTC,RunLoveKill also looks amazing. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous.   I totally agree and I always really appreciate when an action sequence is constructed in a way that's manages to be both comprehensive and interesting. Often one aspect is sacrificed for the other where you either get a sequence so abstract it's difficult to follow or it's a boring panel by panel series of chronological snapshots.  I'll be looking out for this one too.

Really need to start. God Hates Astronauts #5 - Funniest book i'm reading. Humans #3 - Loving this story and style. ODY-C #2 -Still confused but the artwork and intrigue is there. Roche Limit #4 - Favorite Sci Fi book i'm reading. Sinergy #3 - Fun title with a cool premise Trees #8 - Another book I haven't gotten around to reading yet. IXth Generation #1 - Is this a title branching off of an existing story? I'm not really familiar with Top Cow's output.
ImageComics,2rijn1,bunkermatt,2,Tue Jan 6 15:14:39 2015 UTC,"IXth Generation intrigues me as well, but it does sound like it branches off of a story I know nothing about. I'll pick it up and see how it goes."

Trees #8 - I keep reading it because I want to know what happens. It's like one issue moves things forward then there are two issues of nothing.
ImageComics,2rijn1,ShinCoal,2,Tue Jan 6 17:23:23 2015 UTC,"Bithright #4 Never thought I would be into a fantasy at all, but this book is amazing.

Roche Limit #4 Up there with Drifter as my favorite current sci-fi book Trees #8 Yes it is a very slow burn, yes it seems like things dont happen at all, but the world building is great, I am invested in the characters and can't wait to see what is going to happen."

ImageComics,2rijn1,bunkermatt,0,Wed Jan 7 16:12:37 2015 UTC,"I gave up on Trees a few months ago, it's good but I have to read it in trade, not enough happens in the single issues for me to stay into it from month to month.  I was confused by Ody-C but figure I'll try to stick it out a few more.    Intersect was another one that confused me."
ImageComics,2rijn1,BoogKnight,2,Tue Jan 6 16:50:18 2015 UTC,"I love Trees, and it is certainly a very slow burn. I dont think I could handle reading it in trades because of that. It is okay to sit down for 15 minutes once a month and read it and not a whole lot happen, but to sit down and read 8 issues back to back and have nothing really happen would turn me off from it."
ImageComics,2rijn1,Koalacanth,0,Tue Jan 6 17:22:57 2015 UTC,I just wish it had more to do with the trees and not some kid trying to learn about his sexuality. I'm a big scifi person and nothing has really happened with the trees which is why I'm becoming uninterested.

ImageComics,2rbsx8,HistoryNerdi21,14,Sun Jan 4 20:14:07 2015 UTC,"Neither. Neither one is appropriate for TV or Film. I could see either getting an animated mini series though.   I love Saga, but its pacing is all over the place, making it VERY difficult to stay true to in film or TV form.   Sex Criminals would lose a lot of its charm if portrayed in a real life setting. The occasional narration is important, and hard to do well outside of animation."

ImageComics,2rbsx8,ezpetersen,4,Mon Jan 5 14:18:09 2015 UTC,Neither. Not every comic needs to be adapted.
ImageComics,2rbsx8,HGFantomas,2,Mon Jan 5 02:55:09 2015 UTC,No way saga could get done decently on tv or film. Comics is the perfect medium.  Sex Criminals on the other hand could be done on hbo if the right people are in charge.  It would take a delicate touch ro have come across properly.
ImageComics,2rbsx8,BrownBoognish,2,Sun Jan 4 22:26:55 2015 UTC,I think about writing a screenplay for East of West's first 3 trades every time I read it

To answer your question, my friend introduced me to The Woods by James Tynion IV. It's about this highschool that is teleported to an unknown planet filled with minsters. the comic fallows the story of a group of teens who go out to find out why they are there and how they can go back to earth. It has great art, and amazing writing. Highly recommend it."
ImageComics,2r2m86,threeeyeraven,3,Fri Jan 2 06:04:44 2015 UTC,I actually read the first trade of that series and really enjoyed it! I will definitely keep an eye out for volume 2! Thanks for the recommendation though I'm sure somebody else will pick up on that as well.
ImageComics,2r2m86,threeeyeraven,3,Fri Jan 2 06:09:17 2015 UTC,"No problem, and yeah I hope more people read the comic series. It doesn't have the buzz that it deserves. Just like his other project.

ImageComics,2r2m86,bunkermatt,2,Fri Jan 2 06:18:03 2015 UTC,Really enjoying The Woods as well. I do wish more people read it. Hopefully with Tynion IV doing the Batman back ups he will get a few people to check out his other work.

Morning Glories is filled with questions that dont get answered (or take a long time to get answered) and seems to do its best to mess with your mind and what is going on, while The Woods feels more of a supernatural/horror vibe."

ImageComics,2r2m86,ColonelCorto,2,Fri Jan 2 15:57:53 2015 UTC,"Southern Bastards is awesome.  I am a huge fan of Jason Aaron and regard Scalped as up there not just with the best comics but books, movies and TV as well.  Jason Latour’s art and colours really suit the story.  Very excited about this book.  Huge shout out for The Activity by Nate Edmondson, Mitch Gerads et al.  This book really is at the bleeding edge of covert special forces operations and about as close as we will get without signing up and going through selection.  It received a glowing review from ex-Ranger and Green Beret Jack Murphy who is one of the editors at SOFREP.  Alex Kot and various artists are doing great work on Zero which is another secret agent special ops type book but set in the very near future with a non-linear narrative.  Edward Zero is one of the more interesting protagonists to come down the pipe in a while.  First trade came out a few months ago and I am guessing #14 or 15 will round out the second.  On a completely different note I also snagged the first trade of The Wicked and The Divine by Kieron Gillen and Jamie McElvie.  Rock stars worshipped like gods, gods worshipped like rock stars.  Everyone has been telling me how good this is.  I look how Image is putting out a lot of trades of the first arcs of their new series.  They usually sell for  £7-8 here in the UK too in contrast to most of the trades from Marvel or DC."
ImageComics,2r2m86,JuxtaPositioNed,1 point,Fri Jan 2 09:54:02 2015 UTC,"The second trade for Zero was out in September. Though you're right, the third should be out after issue #15.

Don't get me wrong -- I think he has fantastic ideas, and the stories he writes tend to be pretty interesting. It's just that his dialog is... well, sometimes it's pretty cringeworthy. A lot of characters saying things that sound out of character, and not in a good or interesting kind of way."
ImageComics,2qg9ws,Mr_Spam_Man,5,Fri Dec 26 20:40:45 2014 UTC,"I second this. A lot of Vaughan's dialogue sticks out as being from him and not his characters.

ImageComics,2px3z9,CptSpaulding,1 point,Mon Jan 5 02:45:43 2015 UTC,"Not a very in-depth review. He basically just says ""it was good, so I liked it. I liked it because it was good.""  I personally thought Wytches #3 was quite a big drop in quality from the first two issues, which were absolutely outstanding. The story was very slow and even boring at times.  In Wytches #2 we were following 3 simultaneous stories all building up to a climax. In Wytches #3, there was one story in which nothing happened while people stood around talking about stuff that happened in the previous issue, interspersed with a flash-back which also did nothing to progress the story.  Overall I was slightly disappointed with #3 because there was a serious lack of plot.  Edit: ah, so turns out that /r/imagecomics is no better than /r/movies when it comes to fostering discussion and allowing other people to say their opinions. I guess that makes Wytches like this subreddit's The Dark Knight."

I think it is it's too early to tell which one I like more. Both stories are captivating and great reads, but they are not that far along in their stories and either could take a turn for the worse. So with no end or scope of overall story to gauge these titles on I would say read both. If you can only have one I would say Saga."

I was wondering what are some of the most useful things you've learned about comics since the release of the first issue?  Also, I've been working on a book by myself too and I can relate to some of the struggles you were talking about in the interview. Making comics are a lot of work, especially when you're doing it solo. All the workload, pressure and disappointment can be overwhelming for anyone to handle alone. I hope you're able to find a little more calm in your life and issue 3 comes along a lot easier."
ImageComics,2pd85n,NateSonOfSimp,2,Tue Dec 16 04:44:54 2014 UTC,"I feel your pain. Somebody said drawing comics is like typing on the world's slowest typewriter. It is really, really hard.  I may not be the guy to ask for comics advice, as I'm pretty sure I'm doing it wrong. That said, use paths with strokes on them for speech balloons. That makes life easier.

Your work really hooked me, especially visually. Plus it's great to see a comic with a female protagonist.   What other comics/pieces of media inspire you? I found Nonplayer initially through an Exalted 2.0 (tabletop RPG) board, because players thought the art from Nonplayer really captured the game. More recently Saga and a webcomic called Unsounded have been grabbing me."

ImageComics,2pd85n,NateSonOfSimp,1 point,Tue Dec 16 15:44:40 2014 UTC,"Yep, pushing for reprint of issue one, since issue two is kinda dense. And I can't find copies of #1 anywhere these days. If I had to guess, I think the odds of a reprint are pretty good.  The option lapsed after 18 months and Warner chose not to renew.

While I am excited for a second issue, and for the consistent quality of the work, I have also come to expect a consistent quality a book's publishing.  Where a book like Planetary had built up my investment over time, story by well crafted story, Nonplayer is one in of what looks like an epic tale.  Waiting this long in the very beginning does not build much trust in the creator's ability to produce, regardless of personal life hurdles."

It's wicked funny, and moves SO FAST.   Peter Panzerfaust: Awesome riff on Peter Pan, set in WWII France. Lost boys are Orphans, Peter is an American abroad, they all join the French Resistance. The first trade is slow and a little tonally off, but the last 3 trades have been really dark and magnificent.   Copperhead: I've been buying floppies, but I'm gonna drop it and wait for trades. Sci-Fi world, female sheriff comes to town. It's cool, but a little slow and small.   Manifest Destiny: I just took a break from this to play on Reddit, and I love it so far. Only a few issues in, but it's a blast. Lewis and Clark exploring uncharted America, except there's zombies and minotaurs and scary stuff.   Random Stuff: The first two issues of Tooth and Claw have been great, and the first Nailbiter was alright.   I'd actually like some more suggestions to fanboy about as well."
ImageComics,2p7hul,dopebob,4,Sat Dec 13 23:05:55 2014 UTC,I have really loved Nailbiter. It has been a solid series thus far.
ImageComics,2p7hul,ballzrog,1 point,Sun Dec 14 02:11:44 2014 UTC,Yeah I read the first trade and loved it. I was really enjoying Bedlam too which has a very similar story line.
ImageComics,2p7hul,bunkermatt,3,Sun Dec 14 10:41:19 2014 UTC,thank you thank you thank you!!   What a great list! I'm especially interested in the Copperhead one. I'm totally into the whole space cowboy genre.
ImageComics,2p7hul,OldManHowlett,6,Sat Dec 13 23:09:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah, check it out, especially if you like space cowboys(girls)!  I don't know how this one slipped my mind, but I'm throwing it into the ring as well...  Birthright: Kid disappears into a Narnia like world when he's 8, then comes back to the real world a year later, except he's this bad ass adult dragonslayer guy. Hits a lot of really awesome notes with his family, too. Only 3 issues in."
ImageComics,2p7hul,bunkermatt,2,Sat Dec 13 23:17:33 2014 UTC,I keep seeing ads for Birthright! I've been curious if it was any good.
ImageComics,2p7hul,RJCtv,2,Sat Dec 13 23:34:25 2014 UTC,It's good.

ImageComics,2p7hul,schnitzel0540,4,Sun Dec 14 18:15:32 2014 UTC,"Chew a cop gets psychic impressions from the food he eats. In order to solve crimes he sometimes uses these powers... A good buddy cop series that is criminally underrated.  Revival for one day only in a small Wisconsin town the dead come back to life. Unlike TWD where they are zombies, they go back to living their normal lives like nothing ever happened except they cant die. Follows a cop trying to solve the mystery of why.  ** Alex + Ada** takes place in future. Guy gets dumped by girlfriend and his grandmother sends him an android to fill the void left by her. Human android love is frowned upon by others as AI may be becoming sentient.   Wayward teenage girl moves to Japan to live with her mother and starts fighting monsters. Very similar to Buffy.  Nailbiter 13 serial killers come from the same small town in Oregon. No one knows why. Cop goes to investigate after his friend goes missing there. Has a good 80's horror movie vibe in it.   Southern Bastards about a small county in Alabama that loves football, and one man who returns home when his dad dies and tries to correct things he doesnt like about the place.   Those are some more that havent been expanded upon that people mentioned. I'd also agree that Manifest Destiny, Copperhead, and Birthright be checked out too."

I will second the recommendations on Sex Criminals, East of West (fucking brilliant!!!), and Lazarus.  I would also strongly recommend picking up the Veritgo series Punk Rock Jesus. Six issues series that ran awhile ago. It has been one of my all time favorite. You can get all issues on Ebay for pretty cheap. And while I am suggesting older series, I highly recommend Dead Body Road."

The best way to describe the series would be a pop art mediation on fame, art, and youth. Think David Bowie, Oscar Wilde, and Lourde.   That being said, if you have to pick just one, I would choose Sex Criminals. Interestingly, the most recent Sex Criminals issue includes a scene that is porno adaptation of The Wicked + The Divine."

The artwork draws you in, especially in the creature department. His demons are so twisted and diverse."
ImageComics,2oz7bs,mrsaucytrousers,2,Mon Dec 15 13:48:07 2014 UTC,Stjepan is one of my favorite artists right now.    It's mostly if not all digital but it's beautiful.  I'm reading Death Vigil and his writing is pretty good.  He also did the art for the reboot of Aphrodite IX which is getting a new run coming out early next year.  I don't read Rat Queens but it's exciting to see him getting more work.

ImageComics,2oz00p,OldManHowlett,2,Thu Dec 11 17:34:58 2014 UTC,Aren't misprints usually worth lots on the collector's market?
ImageComics,2oz00p,Mister_Ef,7,Thu Dec 11 19:31:00 2014 UTC,Not for comics. Not unless it is a comic already worth something. Like if you had an action comics #1 and superman was colored in black? Sure. But most expensive comics would lose cgc points and therefore value for a misprint like this.   The only way he is making money off of these is if sex criminals #9 becomes the most important issue of this series and this series becomes huge with tv/movie deals.
ImageComics,2oz00p,OldManHowlett,6,Thu Dec 11 19:42:59 2014 UTC,"Well, I did hedge my bets:  ""Or something."""

That's all."

My issue with it isn't that it shows breastfeeding, it's that it doesn't quite do justice to Staples' art. I think there are better covers not because of what's on this, but because I've just seen more appealing pictures."

Its on #8 I believe but this book is great. Great artwork. Also worth cathing up. Sci-fi  Low(#3) and The Fade Out(#3) just stared and they are awesome.

I read in another discussion some people think that these delays will lead to the demise of the book, which I hate thinking about. I've gotten 3 people into Invincible in the last year and it's my favorite ongoing out right now.  As for the upcoming book, I'm thinking it may be filler, but the best filler ever. I'm hoping it's just huge double page spreads of a bloody battle to the death between the two juggernauts. I think that kind of thing could make up for the delay (in my mind)."

ImageComics,2l22pd,hillman2152,7,Sun Nov 2 11:34:52 2014 UTC,"Southern Bastards is just beautiful writing. Great story so far, the latest issue managed to get me to sympathize with the series's biggest villain thus far. Great stuff.  Black Science is a really cool concept. It could go no where or it could be amazing. Def worth keeping up with.  Rat Queens is just pure FUN. Caps necessary. By far the most fun I'm having reading a monthly. I can't wait fore the next issue!!!  Umbral is great if you like dark fantasy. Like if you liked the Dark Crystal or the Black Cauldron as a kid, I totally recommend Umbral. Really cool art and the story is headed towards a pretty classic fantasy romp.  Saga is pure amazing. Get the first three volumes and then either be patient like me and cry while you wait for volume four or break and read the issues. It has won Comic of the Year numerous times in numerous publications. Just read it.  Lazarus is a really interesting concept. Not a must read, but def interesting.   Zero is pretty damn cool, especially if you're into spy thrillers. If you like the Bourne movies and/or basically any Robert Ludlum novels (or Clancy or anyone like that) definitely check out Zero. They change artist every issue which can give it a jarring, but refreshing feel.  Deadly Class is a lot of fun so far. It kinda has a manga feel to it while still be very western. Its about a high school for assassins and is way less corny than that sounds.  That's all I can think of for now!"
ImageComics,2l22pd,logrusmage,1 point,Sun Nov 2 16:51:39 2014 UTC,"Well, now I have a looooong reading list haha, thank you!"
ImageComics,2l22pd,logrusmage,3,Sun Nov 2 18:54:39 2014 UTC,"You're welcome!  One piece of advice, one comic newbie to another: don't be afraid to drop things if you're just not that into them, regardless of what others think of it.   I spent a bit too much money when I started sticking with weeklies that I didn't really enjoy because I knew a lot of other people did, or because I kept giving the comic one more chance to get good... If you're really not feeling something, don't be afraid to just drop it! Some things aren't for everyone. Some people looooove the Walking Dead, some people can't get past the third or fourth issue. Even Saga has some people dropping off after the first few issues.  Now, I wouldn't discount people who have read much further than you telling you it gets better. That's a different story. This advice pertains primarily to ongoings.   Image is nice because you know the properties aren't going to randomly get a new creative team. With DC and Marvel, creative teams come and go. When they hit it out of the park, it can be amazing (Snyder/Capuello (spl?) on Batman, Azzarello/Cheng on Wonder Woman, Soule/anyone on anything.... ) but then the team can finish its run and move on. Don't be afraid to jump ship.  For example, I recently dropped Moon Knight because of a team change. The new team was taking it in a similar direction, but I just wasn't enjoying it as much. Gave them one issue and dropped it.  Have fun, and try to read what you like! Image in particular has such a wide scope of books. Don't be afraid to read from other companies though! Marvel and DC both have some great books these days, even if they also have a lot more crap and crossovers and the like. The new Ms Marvel is down right amazing, one of the best new super heroes to be created in a decade. And both Batman and Wonder Woman have had great runs with their creative teams (though WW's just changed). Dark Horse, IDW and the like also have great stuff. Letter 44 published by Oni Press has some seriously awesome modern-political sci-fi going on. Tons of fun. Plus... it's Charles Soule, who if you didn't pick up already I really really really really enjoy.  Ooooo second piece of advice: The first volume of any Image series (called a ""trade paperback"" or ""trade"" for short) is usually only $9.99. They're a great way to try out a new series! All the Image books I mentioned in my first post has ten dollar trades available. Image is really good about getting trades out on a reasonable schedule (unlike DC... grumblegrumble). Buying in trades is pretty much always cheaper than collecting issues. I read some series in issue format (Rat Queens and Ms Marvel) because I just can't wait and some exclusively in trade (like Saga or Batman) for delayed gratification purposes.  If your comic book shop is as awesome as mine is (and I hope it is!) you should be able to develop a relationship with the owner/sales clerks. If you chat about what you like often enough, they're likely to be very capable of recommending you new stuff. The owner of my LCS (local comic shop) has gotten me into numerous amazing series (including my two top books right now, Ms Marvel and Rat Queens). (http://escapepodcomics.com/   <----Plugging his awesome store, he does a podcast too which can be quite funny and informative!)  Good luck! Sorry for the extremely long rant, I've been reading regularly and buying on Wednesdays (which is new comic book day!) for maybe a little more than half a year and I've gotten very passionate about it! So many great stories and so much amazing art out there....  Ack, kept rambling. Apologies. Good luck and have fun. Must stop typing... damn cherry mx blues making it super fun to type."

ImageComics,2l22pd,Gigabeto,3,Sun Nov 2 18:55:16 2014 UTC,"Shutter is easily one of my favorites. It's a sci-fi/fantasy themed adventure story, the main character, Kate, has grown up and become disillusioned with Indian Jones/Lara Croft type adventures but gets back into the game when she finds out that her father, who inspired her adventuring career, had OTHER children she never knew about. And they seem to want her dead. The art is great like Saga in that there's a lot of really cool visual information and artistry going on that make lingering on every page rewarding. There should be a trade paperback of the first 6 issues coming out this month and then the monthlies will return not long after so it's a great time to jump on!"

ImageComics,2jw7ce,snerfo,1 point,Tue Oct 21 16:24:24 2014 UTC,"There will be an issue in December(assuming they stay on schedule), it's just that the issue was already solicited months ago. They've already solicited all the way up to issue 117, but 115 hasn't even come out yet and isn't supposed to until next month now. They never solicit more than 3 issues ahead of the most recent released one because they don't want too many spoilers about what's coming up. The fact that they didn't put a solicit out for January, doesn't mean we won't get an issue that month."
ImageComics,2jw7ce,DaveSilver,1 point,Tue Oct 21 21:06:08 2014 UTC,Ha! I just put in my full set of orders up to December just this week. I guess this might be planning a bit too far ahead.

ImageComics,2jw7ce,sandals0sandals,1 point,Tue Oct 21 17:54:32 2014 UTC,"AFAIK the current series is a continuation of a webcomic that already had a trade/hc somewhere else, I think this is the reprint of that."

ImageComics,2jv5vp,new_eyes_open,4,Tue Oct 21 06:15:25 2014 UTC,"Better late than never! It really is one of the best titles out right now.   Is it's length predetermined as far as anyone besides the creators know?   I don't think Vaughan or Staples have given us any word on that. My best guess is it'll last 60-100 issues. Y: The Last Man lasted 60 but I think the Saga universe has a bit more storytelling potential, so it might run longer."
ImageComics,2jv5vp,Rossegut,2,Tue Oct 21 10:42:41 2014 UTC,That's awesome. The story really could go anywhere.
ImageComics,2jv5vp,LightLifter,2,Tue Oct 21 13:16:37 2014 UTC,"Vaughn said the run was supposed to be longer than both Ex Machina and Y so about 110 issues at least. Interesting to not is that it spans Hazels life, not Marko and Alana we are watching so it means one period of her life might be somewhere around 18 issues."
ImageComics,2jv5vp,print_is_dead,2,Wed Oct 22 04:36:48 2014 UTC,"Now is a great time to get in on Saga.  When they announced the hardcover that's coming next month they said that the plan for the series is for three such hardcovers, each collecting 18 issues.   Edit-  after some googling i'm not seeing that confirmed anywhere, but BKV said it at the saga panel at SDCC.  Perhaps he misspoke or i misheard.  I'll look more later when i'm not on mobile."

ImageComics,2jjnj4,Munstered,1 point,Fri Oct 17 22:38:20 2014 UTC,"True, but image certainly allows a lot of creative freedom. The other big studios do some of it as well, but a majority of marvels imprints are about other versions of established characters, with a few exceptions. DC gives a bit more freedom, especially with vertigo, but Image is the master if not requiring it all to connect and letting everyone do their own thing."
ImageComics,2jjnj4,Metalunicorn,2,Sat Oct 18 03:00:20 2014 UTC,The entire purpose both of Icon and Vertigo is to give the writers creative freedom and rights to the characters.
ImageComics,2jjnj4,RushofBlood52,1 point,Sat Oct 18 04:10:52 2014 UTC,The Ultimate Universe and Marvel 2099 are not really an imprint of Marvel though. Those are more like a line of comics that exist in a pocket universe separate from the core Marvel U (616). Icon is an imprint of Marvel though.

While I am a sucker for super nice editions, the Ultimate Collections are a pretty good size/# of issue/price combination for me. They are fairly well bound, etc. too, but I usually have to reconvince myself that the cost of getting a Complete Library hardcover for invincible is a bit more than I can chew at once budget-wise if it's not a complete series in one purchase."
ImageComics,2jcgx3,xfloormattx,2,Thu Oct 16 03:30:14 2014 UTC,"Yea, I waited until the third volume to decide to get the libraries, now it looks like I'll have to switch formats."

Exact same thing with Prophet and East of West, but I'm fairly sure its going to happen anyway with these.  I want the saga HC to have a less shitty cover."
ImageComics,2jcgx3,TheSpycrab,3,Wed Oct 15 20:02:55 2014 UTC,I beg for a Prophet deluxe hardcover every time new Image solicitations come out. I think they did one for the classic Prophet comics.. C'mon guys.  I agree with you on the Saga HC cover. Its unfortunate.
ImageComics,2jcgx3,ShinCoal,3,Wed Oct 15 20:12:37 2014 UTC,Brandon Graham has said that prophet is getting a complete deluxe HC in the future. We can rejoice.

Both Saga and Manhattan projects have been pretty good about that, so if the trade-off is to have TPBs earlier but have to wait a while on deluxe editions, I'll gladly take trades.  That being said, Prophet is one of the few current books that I would really like to see in a Library edition. Something like they did for Hellboy would be great."

I liked the ending too. Overall it has me interested enough to get the third issue. I think ""Boo"" is shaping up to be a much more interesting character than the lead character. I can't even remember her name."

ImageComics,2ipgyn,wolf_man007,0,Sun Oct 12 20:46:04 2014 UTC,It REALLY bothered me that she called the deputy Boo after he explicitly stated that he doesn't want to be called that.  Bosses who disrespect their underlings just because they can are a special kind of scum.  She just seems like a power tripper.

Based on this review I feel pretty compelled to check this out too. Have you read it? Do you agree with the review?
ImageComics,2ijvu5,new_eyes_open,3,Tue Oct 7 17:04:37 2014 UTC,"The article is spot on. This is a great book to pick up. Fun characters, gruesome deaths, great writing. If you like horror in your comics, this is the book for you.  Also, Bedlam. It's on hiatus for a while, but the 11 issues(2 TPB) that are available are amazing."
ImageComics,2ijvu5,BruceIsdead,1 point,Tue Oct 7 17:37:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I'll check it out, I'm a big fan of horror. And look at that - just noticed the CotM. Nice.  Edit: Wow, did a search and read a few panels, Bedlam looks pretty intense. I'll check that out too, for sure. Nice that it ended on a finale. Won't name any names, but some other stories have had a tendency to get delayed mid-arch lately."
ImageComics,2ijvu5,new_eyes_open,1 point,Tue Oct 7 18:23:11 2014 UTC,The artwork lends so much to the storytelling of the series. You can just tell that Bedlam isn't a great place to live and how dark and grim the characters are.

Ales Kot can do good sci-fi, his 2012 Wild Children was total fuckery, if you like his style i would highly recommend it, its not hard to read but it would be hard to read it and not think, hard."

He loves his family. He suffers from PTSD. He is a relatable character. Since both of their kids are now potentially in danger, and they're together now I could see them starting a tentative partnership. That's really cool to think about because they're both a couple of badasses."

ImageComics,2gnhsi,admiraltoad,3,Wed Sep 17 12:00:50 2014 UTC,Loved this first issue and that Image is looking at more all-ages comics.  Oddly being half-witch half-human reminds me of the little girl from Bewitched...but of course a little older.  They mention water being harmful to full bred witches like Wizard of Oz (wicked witch of the west).

ImageComics,2gmwh4,BoogKnight,2,Wed Sep 17 05:56:01 2014 UTC,I was in the same boat. The only series I read that had a new issue was East of West. I'm reading Death of Wolverine because I have to but that's not worth mentioning. I decided to snag Copperhead because it was new and I really dug it. I'm actually checking out Ghosted Issue #1 right now to see how I feel about it. I'm also intrigued by the Mice Templar as far as old series go.

I absolutely love that series and I've been trying to sell it to my friends who think it looks campy. Conceptually it sounds goofy but it ended up being an incredibly serious human drama. Sure there are giant frogs and Mosquitos that eat through human insides but at its core its a human drama and a period piece. I cannot wait for them to flesh out the Sacagawea character some more.
ImageComics,2gmwh4,pbarell,1 point,Sat Sep 20 15:44:15 2014 UTC,I was really impressed with this issue. Didn't have high expectations but it looked cool enough to check out. I thought the writing was great. I loved the banter between Boo and Sheriff Bronson. I added it to my pull list.

It's great that you are able to digest the entire history of the character rather than needing to read over 50 years of books from multiple authors and with tons of retcons along the way. I've also tried to jump onto some of the spin offs since I enjoy Kirkmans writing style so much. Wolf-Man wasn't bad, kind of an interesting take on the classic monsters side of the superhero world. Brit was enjoyable as well though he does seem better suited as the leader of Guardians of the Globe. I have the first volume Tech-Jacket and I've been picking up the new series as well."

ImageComics,2ejypm,SeriouslyLaughing,4,Mon Aug 25 18:57:53 2014 UTC,"Coloring is a special talent and is often done by someone different than the inker. Basically they add the color to an otherwise black and white picture. Lettering is also a special technique. Covers are sometimes linked to the story, sometimes not, sometimes misleadingly related. There is a lot of artistic license in comic book covers. The cover is an opportunity to do some unique artwork. Often it is a selling feature to have art that is done by another artist on the cover. Many times as a variant cover (which comic book companies use to get people to buy more than one book, and which collectors look for for rarity). Comics are about anything. Read what interests you. If people have ""thoughts"" on people who don't like superheroes, then they are opinionated idiots. Who cares what someone else likes."
ImageComics,2ejypm,defedude,6,Mon Aug 25 19:47:35 2014 UTC,"Art is usually broken down into at most 3 components. Basically, any given artist could be working on many books at a time, and having to keep to monthly release schedules. Therefore it's very common for work to get broken down into smaller chunks. The standard format is this: Penciller (sketches the outlines of each image to give the skeleton of each panel), Inker (goes over the pencils with thicker black in order to give a black and white version of the final panel, which prepares the sketches for print), Colourist (colours in the black and white image to give the final product). Generally, if the book says 'Artist', that person is doing the all art duties that aren't credited to anyone else.  Same as above. Lettering is an art form separate from learning to draw (it's more closely related to graphic design) so they get another person in to do it which, again, speeds up the development cycle. Sometimes. Especially on creator-owned books, the writer or artist will be enthusiastic about lettering and will do it themselves, but it's rare.    2a. Usually a combination of both. Sometimes the letterer simply creates a custom font for the book, other times they'll hand write each issue. It depends on the feel the creators want for the book.    It depends what you read. Covers are normally related to the contents of the issue, but vague enough to not give any spoilers. There is, however, the issue of variants. Most books will do variant covers for each issue (or sometimes only special issues like a Christmas special or a #100). Variants are usually not related to the plot, and often feature characters drawn in the styles of other characters from popular culture. They aren't really for anyone but serious collectors, so I'd recommend ignoring them for now.  Same answer from above, to speed up development time. Covers are big, detailed images that need to grab the eye and, if done well, add to the feel of a series (the beautiful fairy tale painted covers of Fables contrasted against it's very standard comic-book art is a great example). With independent comics it's more common for the people who work inside the book to do the covers (like Invincible or Saga), but in the big books at Marvel and DC, where the characters have become modern myths, they tend to do more covers by wider ranges of artists.  It's not rare to avoid superhero books. I'll admit, I think they're mostly crap these days. Personally, hero-wise I only read Kick-Ass (if you count it) and Invincible, as they are actually proper stories about realistic humans, as well as great criticisms of the superhero genre. Modern Batman, for example, seems to be rehashing the same old stuff as always, never drifting too far from the status quo, and never really saying anything of meaning. As entertainment, it's fine. As art? Hmmmm. The best place for you to start is just to jump into some current Image titles, as they avoid capes (mostly) and are generally the most innovative and artistically credible books. Try Sex Criminals, Saga and (if you can stand a superhero book that's about people, not superpowers) Invincible. If you're not already, read The Walking Dead too.

Don't get hung up on picking sides or disliking anything in particular. As a new comics reader you don't have to get into the petty arguments the longterm fans have. Enjoy the fact that you can skim the best books off of the top of 75+ years of comic book history."
ImageComics,2ejypm,sandals0sandals,3,Tue Aug 26 00:06:57 2014 UTC,"I can't really stand superhero books. What is the community's thoughts on people who only read stuff that doesn't include capes?   I don't think anyone will ostracize you for it, whether it's the Image Comics community or comic book lovers as a whole. The cool thing about comic books is that the entire medium is speculative fiction, not just superhero books. There are a lot of non-cape titles at your disposal!  Personally, I'm not much of a superhero reader either. Other than Invincible and Astro City, none of the comics I read have superheroes."
ImageComics,2ejypm,Rossegut,1 point,Mon Aug 25 22:34:54 2014 UTC,"a lot of good answers, but Ill just answer 3/4. (warning, this will be a bit jumbled)  Covers are an animal that has no official rules. Some books, like Walking Dead, Saga, and Phil Noto's Black Widow do have the same artist on interiors as the covers.  While other books, like DC's Harley Quinn, have one regular cover artist (In this case she is also the writer of the book) and a different artist on interiors.  At the end of the day, not every artist has time to do an entire book and a cover piece (comic art, especially full page art, takes a while). There are also artists who do almost exclusively covers. People like Alex Ross don't have time to do 23 pages of sequential art in a month, but they do have time to pump out 3-5 covers. And also some artists, to put it bluntly, haven't quite cracked the code of a good cover. It's a different animal then interiors, often they need to convey motion while looking still, need to pose real pretty while also fighting a villain etc etc.   As for why? Like some people mentioned, the cover is the quickest form of advertisement the book has to offer. They need to jump off the stand and into your hands. In some cases, yes they don't have anything to do with the story. These are usually ""pinups"". Pieces that show the character in a cool pose.   But in a lot of cases they do relate to the story, but usually in an exaggerated way.     Here is a great example of a cover not directly related to the plot of the story. It is a first issue, and it is done by the above mentioned Alex Ross. It sets up the basis of the story without showing a scene from the actual book. In this case these three characters come together to fight for ""Justice"", do you need much more info than that for a first issue, probably not.  There are also covers that have a graphic design element to them. See Manhattan Projects.  These minimilist approaches can often provide just enough information to make someone stop in their tracks and look inside.   With DC and Marvel, finding the right cover is usually the job of the Editor. If they aren't using the interior artist, they want to find an artist whose style and tone will still be a good representation of the book. In some cases, they just have cool pinups that they pre purchased and have been waiting to use when it is appropriate, see Michael turner, whose work was used on covers years after his death.   Im tired or I'd go on, but that is a quick scratch on the surface of cover art in the comics industry."

ImageComics,2e06tj,Rossegut,3,Tue Aug 19 19:33:13 2014 UTC,Basically the announcements of the stuff they're planning to publish. Solicitations meaning they're soliciting retailers to order them (and also readers to order/buy them).

ImageComics,2dmv7d,admiraltoad,1 point,Fri Aug 15 14:14:12 2014 UTC,Anyone still reading Ten Grand? I'm pretty disappointed in the direction the series has taken as of late. I'm not 100%if it's just the loss of Templesmith's artwork or if JMS has less interest in the series now. When it started out I was hoping for a replacement for Hellblazer. Something like a gruff detective story with demons and monsters thrown into the mix. I'm not really too interested in this whole heaven/hell storyline.
ImageComics,2dmv7d,BobZebart,3,Fri Aug 15 14:18:16 2014 UTC,"I expected a lot more small arch stories taking place on earth while they unraveled the back story regarding heaven, hell and his wife, but they jumped right into that main story. I thought that was a mistake. I am very much on the verge of dropping it from my pullbox. All JMS books have been disappointing as of late."
ImageComics,2dmv7d,alohapigs,2,Fri Aug 15 20:08:36 2014 UTC,"I'm with you on that. There's so much great stuff out there I just can't justify spending money on stuff I don't love. I think Templesmith's art was perfect for the series and even though I like CP Smith's touch, I don't think this is a series I'll be continuing."
ImageComics,2dmv7d,Doubleeight3XL,2,Fri Aug 15 22:49:23 2014 UTC,"With the loss of Templesmith, I've dropped the book. I also thought it would fill the hole that Hellblazer or even Fell left behind. The mood of the book set by the artist was what I weighed the book on. I just couldn't get back into that same mood with the new artist."
ImageComics,2dmv7d,moretreesplz,2,Fri Aug 15 15:02:47 2014 UTC,I'm still giving it a shot.  I've got a few issues waiting for me at the shop and those will decide it for me.  I am with Doubleeight3XL in that when Templesmith left I really stopped digging it.  I don't know if the story line was already planned and it was a coincidence but I also don't think Smith's art really does the story justice like Templesmith's did
ImageComics,2dmv7d,cuttups,1 point,Fri Aug 15 17:14:07 2014 UTC,"I'm still following it but as others have said, its taken a dip in quality.  I loved the original art and the idea of a detective dealing with weird supernatural things but now they are focused on ""saving the world"".  I don't mind the new art as some of the full page spreads are trippy as hell and really cool.  I will probably keep reading until issue 12 as that looks like the end of this story and then make a decision on whether I am going to continue with it after that depending on the quality."

Remember, Image isn't a traditional publisher like DC, Marvel, Dark Horse, etc.   All of Kirkman's books get various hardcover treatments because the dude just likes hardcover comics. Fortunately, the sales have supported this in a big way."
ImageComics,2dfjrf,QuickityJacks,2,Wed Aug 13 14:03:09 2014 UTC,"Yup. I've been buying trades for Saga cause I thought that it would be like Vaughn's Y: The Last Man in that the Deluxe editions would be made after the series was over. Might sell or given away my TPBs now.   I would like to add that most limited series, those that have less than 10 issues, don't get the HC treatment often enough and when they do, like Infinite Vacation by Nick Spencer, it will take years."
ImageComics,2dfjrf,fallyinghigh,2,Wed Aug 13 14:32:56 2014 UTC,"I promised my friend to sell the TPBs to him since I was going to buy the HC and I kinda regret making that promise. Having a HC is nice and all, but the cover is imo fucking awful. Literally any of the covers would have been better imo.  http://www.comicbookresources.com/imgsrv/imglib/300/0/1/saga-hc-5fb5b.jpg"
ImageComics,2dfjrf,ShinCoal,2,Sat Aug 16 21:09:22 2014 UTC,"From what I've seen it does appear to come down to sales and a demand for the HC books. Usually long running series, or a series that has become very popular, are given HC versions or editions that bundle multiple volumes together. It's not something every book will necessarily get immediately, or at all."
ImageComics,2dbty7,admiraltoad,3,Tue Aug 12 12:10:03 2014 UTC,"I've always thought McFarlane was a bit full of himself, but I do love Image, and I'm glad that it's gotten to the point where it will survive with or without Spawn."
ImageComics,2dbty7,brizian23,3,Tue Aug 12 19:11:53 2014 UTC,"Agreed. I drifted away from comics for a long while, only recently getting back into it. The complete 180 that Image has pulled is mind blowing. In my youth, they were the brand that pedalled some beautiful artwork with flimsy storytelling (Wildcats, Supreme, Wetworks, Young blood, etc). I felt like every series was the same thing. Now they're brimming with creativity."
ImageComics,2dbty7,Bosstis,2,Wed Aug 13 02:48:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I'm currently reading Trees, Pretty Deadly, and Shutter. In the 90s no one would've expected these kinds of books from Image."

ImageComics,2cl8p4,BobZebart,1 point,Mon Aug 4 17:02:26 2014 UTC,That is awesome! I have never gone to SDCC because I fear it would be too crowded and a hassle (I have been to PAX a few times and feel that way there). Do you think there is any validity to my concern or am I just missing out a on good time?
ImageComics,2cl8p4,ImperialAgent,2,Mon Aug 4 14:35:38 2014 UTC,Oh it is crazy crowded. In order to get some Brain and Fiona you had to be there as the doors open to the convention center.  If you made it five mins after they would be all gone. That being said it was a great time none the less.

When I turned  to that last page and read Harold's response, my heart sank. The article states that the reader may have a different perception of Harold at this point, though I feel like that put a negative perspective onto Harold. If anything, that final page lent to a more sympathetic tone felt for Harold as far as I'm concerned. Thoughts?"

ImageComics,2c4ss6,admiraltoad,7,Wed Jul 30 11:41:30 2014 UTC,"Good review, but I'm reading too many opinions about there being too much world building. I have read the book already and I disagree with that opinion whole-heartedly. What else do you expect from a #1 in a series? Without the early pace setting, you'd be left in the dark for months (much like East of West which still isn't entirely cleared up after that rediculous first 3 issues (adhd-ridden puddle-jumping, imo)). It just seems like people don't actually like knowing what is happening in a comic book anymore."
ImageComics,2c4ss6,Mahdimuh,5,Wed Jul 30 17:16:29 2014 UTC,"I just finished reading my copy. I love it. I think the artwork fits the storyline, plot and environment perfectly. There was only panel that I made me think ""what the...""  I will definitely be keeping this on my pull list."
ImageComics,2c4ss6,SmoothRide,3,Wed Jul 30 20:22:10 2014 UTC,I'm in complete agreement with you. I read it and it reminded me too much of East of West. Everyone loves East of West but I keep thinking it's a hunkered mess you have to sort out just to understand what is basically going on. I don't like being spoon fed a story but I don't like having to analyze and think through everything to understand it.
ImageComics,2c4ss6,soonerfreak,1 point,Wed Jul 30 22:28:49 2014 UTC,I kind of like the trickle feeding of stuff in East of West because it makes the moments when things become clearer bigger to me. Like when the Endless Nation shows up or the not following up on the moment at the end of one issues till a few later.
ImageComics,2c4ss6,Shamrocksoul,3,Mon Aug 11 04:03:30 2014 UTC,ALL HAIL RICK REMENDER!!
ImageComics,2c4ss6,rssotrn,3,Wed Jul 30 12:16:55 2014 UTC,That cover is incredible.
ImageComics,2c4ss6,Shamrocksoul,2,Wed Jul 30 13:52:14 2014 UTC,"First, I'd like to say that this book opens and closes with what i believe will set the tone of the entire series. Two opposed ideologies that together will seemingly shape everything that will happen. We have the rational head strong protagonist and his idealistic optimistic wife. I can see this drawing a huge divide between the two of them, given the situation they have been placed in. Props to Remender, for trying his hardest to put this world into perspective for the reader. You realize that there is an age old grudge that the cain family has made and is now paying a costly price for. I expect the next couple of issues to hopefully reflect on the events that took place prior to issue 1, and maybe go into detail about the capabilities of the helm suit. As far as I can tell, this is going to be another book of Remender's that will keep us on the edge of our seat each issue. I agree that this does have a very secretive, or rather buried, plot. much like east of west's plot. It seems like a lot of time will be spent leaving the reader wondering what the hell is going on and slowly but surely revealing the true nature of the story. Which is something i don't mind, Alan Moore did it perfectly with the watchmen and I trust remender egually as a writer. So I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something riddled with sci fi tech, great art and suspense."

I went and bought every print he had.. One of them was limited of 300, and he hand numbered it on the spot.. I ended up with number 2!"
ImageComics,2bwt73,StarkResilient,1 point,Mon Jul 28 05:55:30 2014 UTC,I bought a print too. Had a hard time choosing.

ImageComics,2bwt73,StarkResilient,3,Tue Jul 29 14:45:55 2014 UTC,"Sure thing.  Here's an album of my print collection.  Sorry the pictures aren't the best. Two are framed and on my wall already, the rest are in my portfolio book, and will need framing immediately.  As far as I know, I'm only missing one print.  East of West is shaping up to be one of my favorite comics of all time.  It is certainly my favorite comic that's being published right now, so I'm trying to put together an extensive collection based around it.  I have CGC books (my set is ranked 6th in the CGC Registry, I gotta submit the rest of my books), a couple of sketch covers, and even a commission from Dragotta himself on the way."
ImageComics,2bwt73,moose27,2,Tue Jul 29 20:20:46 2014 UTC,"Thanks, super jealous. That panel with the rangers is one of my favorites so far. You'll have to post a pic of the Dragotta commission when it arrives"
ImageComics,2bwt73,StarkResilient,3,Wed Jul 30 14:38:22 2014 UTC,I think I saw a picture of it on twitter tweeted out by his art rep.  Unless someone has the same commission as me this mine:  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bto9zyUCEAAmdwu.jpg  EDIT:  I'll be sure to confirm though when it arrives.
ImageComics,2bwt73,moose27,2,Wed Jul 30 20:25:18 2014 UTC,"If you don't mind my asking, how much did the commission cost? I'd love to get some sort of dragotta artwork, I doubt I'll find any comic con exclusives so I'm trying to figure something out"
ImageComics,2bwt73,StarkResilient,2,Wed Jul 30 20:35:13 2014 UTC,"He's not cheap, but he's a hot artist right now as well as my personal favorite.  His rate is $400 for an 11x14, which is definitely quite pricey.  This is my first and only piece of original artwork from an artist for the foreseeable future for me, though, so I don't quite mind."

I told the guy at the local comic store it is because the stories are original, interesting, funny, gritty, just plain awesome.  You should also check out Rat Queens. It has adventure, humor, sex, drugs, and drama. I just read the TPB and now I have to go get 6 + 7 to catch up and will be adding it to my pull list."

When I have time and money to catch back up, I'm going to collect the trades of the issues I missed and then it will be about 80% Image, 15% Dark Horse, and 5% Boom.  My only issue is that Image seems to be a little too lenient on their creators sometimes re: delays. I ended up cancelling Ten Grand during the Templesmith fiasco, and I'm more than a little annoyed that Starlight and Jupiter's Legacy seem to disappear for months at a time randomly, especially given how amazing they are."

ImageComics,2bqd7o,ShinCoal,5,Fri Jul 25 22:19:36 2014 UTC,"Low Next week will be the first release of the new series by Remender and Tochinni. People tend to be less positive about their joined arc in Uncanny X-Force, but I adored it. Ever since Image Expo I have been excited by the premise and the insanely beautiful covers. Nameless Grant Morrisons new project, announced at Image Expo. allegedly going to be a horror series, but it has been really silent around this title ever since. Injection Ellis, Shalvey and Bellaire have been KILLING it on Moon Knight over at Marvel, and I was sad to see the team leave the title. Hope this makes up for it! Tokyo Ghost Looks a lot like Ghost in the Shell, and thats not a bad thing at all! Roche Limit Haven't really looked too much into it, but decided to preorder number 1 anyway. Copperhead Idem.   EDIT: Totally forgot about the new Brubaker/Phillips (The Fade Out) and the new Snyder (Wytches)"
ImageComics,2bqd7o,Krigstein,2,Fri Jul 25 22:31:10 2014 UTC,I'm stoked for Low and Roche Limit.  Cant say too much for any of the other big ones that were teased at image expo 2013 or 2014 since some of them may never materialize. But those two are tangible and coming pretty soon. Pumped.
ImageComics,2bqd7o,Mahdimuh,2,Sat Jul 26 09:28:04 2014 UTC,"Really upset that Tokyo Ghost isn't taking place in Tokyo. Mostly excited about Low. The first issue is going to have such insane art. The story of Nameless doesn't excite me, but since Morrison is in on it, its a must pull. Injections premise seems overdone. I dont know if they have the ability to make it their own.  Honestly, none of them actually seem interesting to me. It's just the people on-board working on them that has me hyped."
ImageComics,2bqd7o,admiraltoad,1 point,Sun Jul 27 01:14:40 2014 UTC,I think WYTCHES by Scott Snyder and Jock is the title I am most excited for at the moment. Both are amazing talents and I am a huge horror fan. Should be a fun series.

I hope the Image site can match prices of comixology, google play, and ibooks like on this sale cause I'm switching to DRM free. Also they should have trades in digital."

ImageComics,2bbg9r,abercromby3,2,Tue Jul 22 14:23:19 2014 UTC,I said Invincible but it's worth mentioning twice. It's my favorite Kirkman series.
ImageComics,2bbg9r,writerbw,2,Tue Jul 22 14:37:00 2014 UTC,"... I know.   I was reinforcing it, Invincible is the BOMB. I actually got a tattoo of him recently."
ImageComics,2bbg9r,numenorweeps,4,Tue Jul 22 14:48:00 2014 UTC,"The great thing about image comics is each one is completely creator owned, so it is so different. I'd say look at Saga, look at Chew and get started on Invincible."
ImageComics,2bbg9r,Neutralgray,3,Mon Jul 21 18:39:06 2014 UTC,chew definitely looks interesting. i don't know if i'd like invincible though. i get enough superheroes from dc. also i can never really get behind main characters that are in their teens.
ImageComics,2bbg9r,cuttups,5,Mon Jul 21 19:24:50 2014 UTC,I understand that you've read plenty of superhero books but I'm going to agree with the other guy and say look into Invincible. It's a fantastic series and it doesn't really do crossovers so you can know everything about it by reading the main series.
ImageComics,2bbg9r,numenorweeps,2,Mon Jul 21 23:03:51 2014 UTC,i'm gonna give it a go! i'll be sure to post my new image collection once i get it together!
ImageComics,2bbg9r,cuttups,3,Tue Jul 22 05:22:14 2014 UTC,"That's what I thought. Then I gave it a shot. It starts out like you'd expect as a teenage hero comic, but it very quickly turns very dark.   I'd say pick up the first compendium. If you don't want to make that big an investment, pick up the first trade or two. By the end of the first trade you'll be hooked."
ImageComics,2bbg9r,brainiac4200,3,Tue Jul 22 01:25:41 2014 UTC,"alright alright, you convinced me. i'll give it a go."

ImageComics,2bbg9r,andycpsu,2,Tue Jul 22 05:17:00 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I knew it was good but wasn't officially hooked until the second compendium.  It gets great when things start to turn for the super dark and tragic."
ImageComics,2bbg9r,abercromby3,2,Tue Jul 22 02:08:12 2014 UTC,"Second compendium definitely took everything I liked about the first and cranked them up to 11. The beginning is very... teenagery. It's unique, but has a lot of the high school drama crap.   However, I'm hoping that the end of the first arc is enough of a hook to get him into it so he can push through to the meat of the series."
ImageComics,2bbg9r,klassobanieras,3,Tue Jul 22 02:12:42 2014 UTC,Invincible is probably the most exciting and interesting and original superhero comic out there.  It has never had a reboot and things just keep amping up further and further.

ImageComics,2b753z,Wekos1187,2,Mon Jul 21 00:53:10 2014 UTC,I thought the exact same thing! But it is best for any of us who can attend SDCC for it NOT to be ticketed. The ticketed signings are so limited. But these guys are so nice that they will squeeze in as many people and their stuff that they possibly can at their signings. It is best that they are not considered super stars.

ImageComics,2ay5hw,michaelmacmanus,1 point,Thu Jul 17 19:17:11 2014 UTC,"This book impressed me in two ways: 1) the quality of line work of the art - visually unique and satisfying & 2) how much story was told using very few words - fantasy world/ dimension where a character known as ""the alchemist"" (perhaps with an ulterior agenda) creates a being, compelled by a dark force that also transports it uncontrollably reborn through time, to serve a mission that has yet to be fully revealed. The moments of silence were necessary and offered a well thought-out contrast to the bursts of violence, which were complemented by the page paneling. I'm really looking forward to the next issue."

The POV was meant to be offputting and the twist shocking, but it was all too hollow and rehearsed. Zero nuance, zero space to leave the reader feeling bereaved of the way things should be. Just cheap intrigue and action between two non-characters.  I'm really not being too hard on it. I already said that I'm still hopeful for this comic. But this sample itself just isn't much of an augur of greatness ahead. If it excites you or others, wonderful. But if this what they think of as the spark to lure readers in, then Wytches will be much more limited in scope."

It really feels like a different world, and there's a lot of room for exploring the history behind everything.  It has the same visceral and isolated feel as The Thing, which is great for me since I love sci-fi horror.  I can't wait for the next issue."

ImageComics,2abtby,Mahdimuh,1 point,Fri Jul 11 18:53:01 2014 UTC,Glad to hear it! Yah I haven't been this excited since saga.  It's pretty awesome
ImageComics,2aawci,Mahdimuh,4,Thu Jul 10 03:36:02 2014 UTC,Image is so great and this sub definitely needs more users. It's amazing how so much of the comic book world has yet to be explored because non-superhero stories are such a vast realm.
ImageComics,2aawci,FelicityInFables,6,Thu Jul 10 05:33:12 2014 UTC,"I got into the comics world recently.  Superhero stuff never appealed to me (outside of the movies) because they've been around so long and there's been so many different storylines that I just felt like I would be overwhelmed trying to read some of them.  I also didn't like reading about superheroes and instead was more interested in tales that would make for good fiction, as well as good material for movies or tv shows (I'm a filmmaker).  Image is pretty much my go-to.  First trade paperback I bought was ""Fell"" on a whim, fell in love with it, asked the comics guy what some good non superhero comics are, he steered me toward East of West and Peter Panzerfaust.  I discovered Revival on my own, and then had a friend recommend Rat Queens.  Of course, The Walking Dead was something I was interested in before I got seriously into comics.  My local store just had an awesome 4th of July sale and I picked up all the Chew trade paperbacks.  Geez what else?  Oh yeah, Saga I'm all caught up on.  Haunt.  Happy!   Image just gets me."
ImageComics,2aawci,gallow737,4,Thu Jul 10 08:48:59 2014 UTC,"I love how Image creators, artists, and writers have enough power to be unique and divert from the cookie cutter stories that make up so many of today's comics. That's so cool, a film related job has always been a fantasy of mine. May I ask what films you've made? I feel as though Hollywood can give a lot of credit to comics for great inspiration. Unfortunately the comic medium is not as ubiquitous as film. My friends didn't even know 300 was based off the book until recently. I think the comic world needs linear story lines that can attract a wide demographic. Like you were saying, superhero stuff doesn't appeal to me either because it's incredibly overwhelming. But Chew appeals to wider base, including me, partially because it has an Asian main character. Chew is definitely one of my favorite comics of all time and hopefully it will be made into a movie or show. The tiny details in the background are so fun to read and often times they are references to tv shows or movies. You'll love it. Also I have to read the last two issues of Saga. The trades take way too long haha."
ImageComics,2aawci,FelicityInFables,3,Thu Jul 10 09:12:42 2014 UTC,"Really? For me, I just find Superheroes overly simple and overused. That's why Im not into Superheroes. There are some exceptions though. I really like Deadpool for the comedy aspects and Moon Knight...because he's just awesome."
ImageComics,2aawci,FelicityInFables,3,Thu Jul 10 09:57:50 2014 UTC,"That's what I was trying to convey. Superhero stories overall are basic, rudimentary, and bland. The genre is narrow but it's extremely difficult to start and follow a character or story line for several reasons. They are all similar copycats that clutter up the original or best stories. Also the writers or artists get moved around in series with hundreds of issues so there's no stability. For example, I loved Ultimate Spider Man but the artist got changed around later which ruined the series for me."
ImageComics,2aawci,FelicityInFables,3,Thu Jul 10 10:09:14 2014 UTC,I can agree. We're on the same page. :)
ImageComics,2aawci,gallow737,2,Thu Jul 10 10:12:07 2014 UTC,Cool. Cool cool cool :)
ImageComics,2aawci,FelicityInFables,2,Thu Jul 10 10:18:08 2014 UTC,"I'm merely an aspiring filmmaker working with a team of friends.  We're trying to get funding for a film. It's hard to describe, but it's a Cambodian-American movie, meant for the Cambodian market, website and teaser trailer here (Our director is Cambodian, and there's a large Cambodian community here where we live).  But we're in a small town that's getting some big movies here recently because of the state's tax incentives, so we do work here and there on them.  Basically grunt work while we grind to make our own way.  We live in a very convenient world where you don't need to move to Hollywood to make a name for yourself due to the many outlets on the internet to get your vision out there.    We don't do anything big (yet), though my friends and I have talked seriously about creating a Fell fan film based on the first issue.  Well, mostly me, but they're on board.  I'm dying to do it, Fell is my absolute favorite."
ImageComics,2aawci,gallow737,1 point,Fri Jul 11 03:32:41 2014 UTC,Following your dreams is tough but hang in there because it sounds like you truly love it. Did you know that in Saga some of the rooms on the planet Cleave were inspired by Cambodian architecture? Here's a link to Fiona Staples wiki page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Staples  Now I think I'll have to try Fell for sure. I'm about to get into The Private Eye which is also a Brian K. Vaughan comic. http://panelsyndicate.com
ImageComics,2aawci,Iggy210,2,Fri Jul 11 04:35:29 2014 UTC,"The Private Eye is awesome!  Fell is often forgotten in the troves of Image comics because it was done several years ago by Warren Ellis and Ben Templesmith, but they did it very sporadically (I think it took like a nearly two to two and a half years to put out 8 issues).  As I understand it, Ellis had written the next 9 issues, but Templesmith is so busy he can only get to them whenever he has time, and Image Comics didn't want to release one at a time every several months or so, so they're waiting for him to finish the entire run before releasing any more.  There's been 9 total. At least that's what I believe is the situation.    It has a very Se7en-ish film noir feel to it.  And I love film noir (and Se7en) so it really plays to my interests.  It's also darkly comical for a serious gritty crime series.  I have no idea why but it was one of the only non superhero trades on the graphic novels shelf in my local store, and it just looked cool so I snagged it.  Talked to the owner about it the next time I was in there and he was like ""I have no idea what Fell is, and didn't even know we had it"", lol.  Oh there's also some Cambodian lore talked about in Fell as well!  Cambodia in the house!"
ImageComics,2aawci,Iggy210,3,Fri Jul 11 05:22:19 2014 UTC,"I agree, but I was a huge Vertigo fan before I moved overseas for like 5 years. They had all the good series 5 years ago: Y The Last Man, 100 bullets and Fables. Now that Im back in the States, its really cool to see all these new awesome series from Image."

This might seem like not your cup of tea, because I immediately didnt think it would be for me either, but its a very interesting story in the way its told with lots of thriller and drama elements. This series got a lot of series of the year awards in 2011.  ""The Morning Glory academy is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. What looks like an innocent prep school for the rich and snobby is actually a diabolical testing ground where no one can be trusted. In the first arc, For A Better Future, six teenagers, half girls and half boys, are chosen to attend this prestigious prep school. Each of them has their own mysterious past and their own reasons for attending. Each of them are bright and intelligent but have a troubled past. They will learn that the Academy has dark secrets and there is no escaping from them. The faculty is sinister in intentions. These six new students will learn that few can be trusted... not even each other."""

Also haven't touched Stray Bullets: Killers or Hack/Slash: Son Of Samhain, but the rest weren't that enthralling; couldn't even finish the #1's of COWL, Magi, Red City or Tech Jacket.  Wicked + Divine seemed to have promise but not a very original story.  Also, i was scammed by geekality with Tales of Honor. was one of the ""winners"" by tweeting a ToH pic to win signed copies of Think Tank...but the box ""shipped"" to my house was opened while en route and returned to sender, and they said they'd ""look into"" another prize.  that was a couple months ago."

I can see the appeal of SB, no doubt, but this type of story (genre) just doesn't do it for me. Also, I have no affinity or identification with southern culture.  Not a region I know.  My opinion may be different otherwise.  Plus, i liked the artwork on trees more so than SB. Cant put my finger on why... think it was the colors more than anything.  I have to be honest, I did not realize the prevailing opinion was the opposite. Why do people like SB?"
ImageComics,2a9omh,HGFantomas,3,Thu Jul 10 03:46:38 2014 UTC,"I actually haven't read either, which is why I'm interested in what you had to say about it. I have heard quite a few people talk about them though, and they tend to like Southern Bastards because its basically a ""Bad-Ass"" dark gritty pulp thriller.

Issue no. 3 was heartpounding and gut wrenching and all manner of actions to body parts. It's an amazing mix of zany, macabre action that I am falling deep into.   Also I discovered Black Science last night when I impulsively bought all six. Holy crap what an amazing comic. Both it and Shutter make me imagine seeing my world in their art styles as I walk around. Who knew Image Comics would seep into my perception of reality?"

Starlight also had a very strong start, and it's coming from a major creator. Since I was already pulling Jupiter's Legacy though I decided to trade wait on that series. Though JL has been a slow go as it is.  Picked up Tech-Jacket yesterday. Excited to get into the new series. I really enjoyed his character in the Invincible series and the first Tech-Jacket trade that Kirkman did. Hoping this will be along the same lines."
ImageComics,2a9omh,admiraltoad,1 point,Thu Jul 10 12:21:59 2014 UTC,I like what is happening with Shutter. I just find the story interesting so far.  I really like concept and potential of Trees. I'm enjoying the art in it a lot as well.  I'm torn on The Wicked + The Divine. I like the art and I want to like the story but I have never been much of a pop-culture kind of person. I'm going to have read the next couple of issues to see where it goes.

ImageComics,2a43d1,FelicityInFables,2,Tue Jul 8 03:43:04 2014 UTC,From what I understand the comic bought through the iOS app are not DRM-free because they are provided by comiXology. If the comics are purchased on imagecomics.com they are DRM-free. As for how the money is split I would guess it depends on the contract the creators signed with Image. Also I would think comiXology gets a fixed amount per comic?
ImageComics,2a43d1,seraphrunner,2,Tue Jul 8 06:13:15 2014 UTC,"No, image comics are not DRM free on the app. You are not buying the comic, you are paying for permission to view the comic. Same with all Comixology comics.  I recommend buying the comic through the Image website and then use Chunky Comics on the iPad. Chunky Comics can connect to your Image account so you can automatically download comics straight from Image into the app without navigating the website."

ImageComics,2a43d1,defedude,1 point,Wed Jul 9 00:19:45 2014 UTC,Never heard of the chunky comics app until today. I usually use ComicZeal but its loading is always a pain.

Gonna have to get used to the organizing but I can deal with that part.  Thanks for pointing it out.

Supposedly the Chunky Comics guy is working on a server app for your desktop so that you can stream comics page by page and see your entire collection in the app without having to download anything.  Hopefully that gets past the app store police."

I think what would be best is if they stuck with the 'Viltrumite War' thread from the beginning, covering Viltrumite-related stuff from issues 1-70ish, and have it end with Mark's conversation with Thragg after the Viltrumites start hiding out on Earth. I feel like if they did less, say 30 issues per movie, it would take too long to get to the good stuff. I'm tempted to say it would actually be better to wait until good CGI is much less expensive, and make it a TV show instead á la TWD so more screen time is available, like 8 hours per season.   EDIT: maybe James Franco's younger brother Dave for Mark?"

Your concept of young and old varies greatly from mine, apparently. I like Emma Stone for a younger Eve. I could see Marie Louise-Parker playing an older Eve. Corben Bernsen would be my pick for Cecil.   But most importantly, we have to get the movie before Tom Selleck is too old for Omniman. There is literally no actor that is as perfectly suited for a role as he is for Nolan."

The comic sells around 10,000 issues a month, and on the face of it, is not a super unique concept. As an avid fan I could go on for hours about how Invinicbile is more unique and more interesting than it's more mainstream counterparts, but the basic concept feels like a modified version of Superman or DBZ at first glance. The series already doesn't get anywhere near the attention it deserves from comic readers, why would a movie studio go forward with it when they could just as easily choose one of the more well-known heroes, or one of the more unique/interesting image series?"

I know he sold the rights to an Invincible movie awhile back, but Davesilver is right. Numbers and concept wise to the higher ups, it's just not a good gamble. All we can do is keep our fingers crossed that all this Walking Dead popularity will be enough to get us something more than that motion comic that was on MTV or whatever.

It's a pretty interesting premise as well, I think I'll really enjoy Kirkman's take on the whole possession mythology. I've always loved this kind of horror movie (Amityville, The Exorcist, etc..) so this is right up my ally.   I did laugh at the note from Robert Kirkman a the back though where he said he thinks this setting is scarier than zombies because it's more real. I am not really sure how you begin to measure that. The question ""What is more believable: the dead returning to feast on the flesh of the living, or, an evil and malevolent spirit from another dimension taking control of a human body?"" is kind of ridiculous. The answer is neither, neither are believable."
ImageComics,29kk2v,JimmyMcShiv,1 point,Tue Jul 1 16:01:01 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the back matter was kind of ridiculous. He did the same thing that happened in Wildfire where he says something along the lines of ""this book is neither blank or blank."" Which pretty much means that is what it is. (Wildfire was about not having a bias about GMOs and this is about whether or not he believes these things). I would have preferred he stopped after he mentioned how excited he was."
ImageComics,29hiqe,jftrent,3,Mon Jun 30 17:03:43 2014 UTC,This review is a little harsh. But i'll have to agree that this isn't really a page turner.   However I think this is a pretty big story ellis is telling. And these early issues are snapshots of a much larger tale going on. I'm pretty sure this issue will fit in very nicely with the whole story once it becomes volumized.
ImageComics,29hiqe,bigteebomb,1 point,Tue Jul 1 14:19:19 2014 UTC,"I hope it does. I will continue to pick this one up and am still looking forward to where it will go, this issue was just really uninspiring."
ImageComics,29etzo,Kevin_Wayne,15,Sun Jun 29 19:10:07 2014 UTC,"You just have to start at the first issue. Theyre quick reads, you'll be caught up in a day."
ImageComics,29etzo,kingshane,3,Sun Jun 29 19:22:55 2014 UTC,Should I buy all the trades? What does the largest trade end at?
ImageComics,29etzo,kingshane,1 point,Sun Jun 29 19:24:08 2014 UTC,"Currently there are three paperback collections that will get you up to #18 (6 issues each). The most recent issue was number #20 and that just came out.   I have heard word of there being plans for a Hardcover collection that I assume would collect the first 18 issues all together, but you can probably get a pretty good deal just getting the trades if you dont want to wait. The first one is only $10"
ImageComics,29etzo,kingshane,2,Sun Jun 29 19:27:15 2014 UTC,What is so great about this book? Most people say it's like StarWars and LOTR meeting. What else is there?
ImageComics,29etzo,kingshane,11,Sun Jun 29 19:28:55 2014 UTC,"I was just talking about this earlier, and it's almost hard to pin down what is so great about saga. It actually has a lot of mundanity with spurts of action sprinkled in, and honestly sometimes it feels as if nothing happens in some of the single issues, but for me personally it always gives off the feeling that im reading something epic. Maybe thats too flowery?  Really its just simply a very fun book with an amazing diverse cast, a great sense of humor, and beautiful art. It's always a refreshing read when it comes out.   To me Saga is kinda like The Beatles of comics. I can understand if it's not your favorite, but I think as a whole it's got something for everyone and I have a hard time understanding those who plain don't like it.   The first issue is only 99¢ and is a double length issue if you're hesitant to try it out."
ImageComics,29etzo,holemole,3,Sun Jun 29 19:34:39 2014 UTC,Damn that was beautifully said man. Definitely going to pick this up now.

ImageComics,295meh,admiraltoad,1 point,Thu Jun 26 15:25:23 2014 UTC,"As far as the opening Alana scene, it seems that her previous argument with co-worker and near employment termination resulted in some kind of in-universe ratings boost creating an audience desire for either a scripted series about their production company or a fabricated reality show. like that matters to anyone but me  ."
ImageComics,295meh,carson3000,1 point,Thu Jun 26 19:49:16 2014 UTC,"It works for our real life closest relative to their show, Pro Rasslin'. It was always popular, but when they pulled the camera back to reveal the 'real' goings on outside the ring, their ratings went nuts.  Back towards the topic. Saga was superb as always, but I felt a twinge of anxiety before opening this issue, given what we found out at the end of last month's."

ImageComics,2902cw,Guano07,1 point,Wed Jun 25 04:02:56 2014 UTC,Forgive me but I have to ask. What is the importance of the music with the comic? I have a vague understanding that the creative team has always had music be apart of their stories. I guess I just don't understand if this play list is fan created or from the creative team.  Thanks for any help.
ImageComics,28yr0h,admiraltoad,1 point,Tue Jun 24 13:52:39 2014 UTC,Can we talk about what an amazing first issue this came out to be?  Because it is an amazing first issue.
ImageComics,28yr0h,oldmankyle,1 point,Wed Jun 25 18:38:30 2014 UTC,"i was sucked in. The line work is phenomenal, heavy on the blacks, confident thick strokes, minimal detail that captures facial expressions perfectly. And the coloring, spot on for the feel. Greenish blues and purples for dark scenes, an autumn palette to show the town. The art really reminds me of some of the stuff the Fatale creative team is putting out right now. The story is holding up to be just as well done as Walking Dead, it hints at religious influence in a way that recalls Updike's Rabbit Run, but doesn't try to make us believers. This is a comic reading experience that feels more like your watching a movie. I wouldn't say this first issue scared me, but it definitely has me hooked."
ImageComics,28wcnh,ShinCoal,3,Mon Jun 23 19:25:38 2014 UTC,"I, for the life of me, cannot get into the show. I've been reading the comic since it came out and it's sacred to me. The show seems to focus on drama too much, the characters are nothing like they are in the comic, it's no where near as violent as the comic.... The show sucks. I watched the first 2 seasons and finally have up mid season 3, it was just about unwatchable."
ImageComics,28wcnh,six6sickx,1 point,Tue Jun 24 13:20:16 2014 UTC,I feel the exact same about the show as you - I even watched up to about where you did.   The difference being that I've yet to read a single Walking Dead comic. No doubt they're great - but the show has turned me off to that universe for now. I'll visit it eventually.
ImageComics,28wcnh,michaelmacmanus,2,Tue Jun 24 15:17:35 2014 UTC,Question: How true to the comic is it. I never had that much of a clear answer to this one.
ImageComics,28wcnh,Nifarious,2,Mon Jun 23 19:29:37 2014 UTC,"Characters live and die at their own pace in the show vs the comic. Some characters are much rounder and live longer than their paper counterparts, some are the same character in name only. The tenor and style is just different...it's simpler and more black and white in the comic. Read the comic if you feel so inspired, but only expect the broad brushstrokes to be familiar."
ImageComics,28wcnh,admiraltoad,2,Mon Jun 23 22:42:04 2014 UTC,"It's a good adaptation to the comics but I don't think they wanted to really retell the same story. The characters basically follow the same path (small camp -> the farm -> the prison) but otherwise everything is a bit different. They never went to the CDC in the comics. The group, who is alive and who died, is different. The whole Governor thing was a lot shorter (and probably better)."
ImageComics,28nbew,admiraltoad,2,Fri Jun 20 15:26:16 2014 UTC,Its a pretty good issue and id recommend it if it wasn't free.

ImageComics,28mxnb,admiraltoad,1 point,Fri Jun 20 12:45:57 2014 UTC,I love this series. The relationship and the world that has been written feels so realistic. The conflicts seem to arise organically and there are no bombs going off. It is a calm and relaxing read.
ImageComics,28mxnb,seabterry,1 point,Fri Jun 20 19:48:03 2014 UTC,It is a calm and relaxing read.   I feel the same. The book offers a respite from the excessive violence usually offered. I have nothing against excessive violence - but sometimes a break can be a good thing.
ImageComics,28joml,admiraltoad,2,Thu Jun 19 12:37:32 2014 UTC,So happy to see a review of this. This series deserves some love.

ImageComics,2840nf,merz123,2,Sat Jun 14 12:10:32 2014 UTC,"I've enjoyed issues #1 and #2, haven't got #3 yet. The art is gorgeous and it is a very inventive world. I'm just not really hooked by the plot yet, I must admit, and like you say we don't know much about our protagonist. This is one that I'm more into at the moment for the art than the writing."
ImageComics,2840nf,ConfusionGrows,2,Sat Jun 14 22:32:42 2014 UTC,"I think one fun surprise after another is a good way to describe it. It started out kind of heart warming and whimsical, jumping into random moments of crazy fun adventure, then featured some alternating creepy and tragic elements late issue 2 and in issue 3. I also feel like it's hard to get a sense of who Kate is, and I think it might be because she's not the same person she was with her father and she still doesn't know who she is now either. In the same way it's hard for me to get a sense of what kind of book Shutter is developing into, except it's fun and interesting around every corner thus far."
ImageComics,2840nf,nopushpins,1 point,Mon Jun 16 15:58:32 2014 UTC,"I'm going to be honest, I don't feel the same way. I feel like so far there's been a lot of overblown action to try and make you keep buying, but characters have taken a bit of a back-seat. The only real plot point I can discern is about the sudden inclusion of previously-unheard-of relatives, and that seemed a little overly comic-booky to me; that whole plot point is pretty much what was happening exactly when I cancelled my Batman sub. I go to indie comics for Alana shitting herself on page one, or the residents of Wausau dealing with the complex emotions of living with Revival.   I don't know, I just don't feel the characters are interesting enough yet. I'll keep reading though, and hopefully it's a grower, because the art of day to day life in it's world could be amazing.   EDIT: I've only read 1 & 2 so far."
ImageComics,2832yo,ConfusionGrows,8,Fri Jun 13 21:33:21 2014 UTC,"Aren't there only like, 6 issues out? I mean, I know it'll be a while before we see it but jeez."
ImageComics,2832yo,mjwright412,0,Fri Jun 13 22:12:07 2014 UTC,I'm just surprised it got picked up before Saga.
ImageComics,2832yo,SpaZticHero,6,Fri Jun 13 23:15:37 2014 UTC,I doubt that Saga will ever be on TV because Brian said he doesn't want it done (right now). Search for tv on his interview http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=50441
ImageComics,2832yo,seraphrunner,6,Sat Jun 14 01:16:07 2014 UTC,"In all fairness, Saga is an epic, Rat Queens is 4 characters doing shit (this isn't about quality, I like them equally, maybe Rat Queens even more). Rat Queens can easily be adapted to do anything, doesn't even have to be the same stories as the comic."
ImageComics,2832yo,ShinCoal,3,Sat Jun 14 08:56:22 2014 UTC,"In any case, they are making it but a TV station needs to pick it up. Adult Swim might be best for this. Toonami!"
ImageComics,2832yo,SmoothRide,3,Sat Jun 14 22:26:31 2014 UTC,"I'm happy for them but the Damn thing is only 6 issues long. They are going to butcher it, aren't they?"
ImageComics,2832yo,SmoothRide,3,Fri Jun 13 23:42:24 2014 UTC,Maybe it will be a Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood thing where the cartoon is just as good as the source material but is a separate story.
ImageComics,2832yo,seraphrunner,4,Sat Jun 14 01:11:56 2014 UTC,"errrrr, isn't Brotherhood actually the same as the source material? afaik only episode 1 wasn't canon (and the first 1/3 was a bit sped up because it was already featured in the other tv series)"
ImageComics,2832yo,ShinCoal,3,Sat Jun 14 08:57:43 2014 UTC,"Ah you are right, it was the last half of Full Metal Alchemist that was different then the manga."

ImageComics,280h4c,throw10away,1 point,Fri Jun 13 00:51:07 2014 UTC,"Hey Sean,  Avid reader of Image books and otherwise - I'm glad you're doing this AMA, because I've always been curious about Skybound's branding - or lackthereof.  Many of my friends, avid comic readers, don't even know the name Skybound - and some of them read TWD. I've had several friends just assume ""Skybound"" was a merchandising company. Even with the success of AMC's TWD and the TWD book, the Skybound logo is rarely seen or the name heard. For one of the most successful comic publishers out there (and definitely the most successful of the Image companies), this seems really strange.  When people talk about TWD, or even Manifest Destiny, people don't say ""Skybound"" - they say ""Image.""   With such a slew of successful books, why does Skybound care so little about name-branding - and, on the heels of that, with the success of Manifest Destiny and Invincible and the Invincible Universe, why does it seem like you just rally around TWD?"

ImageComics,27wcph,youpeoplearesick,2,Fri Jun 20 18:54:58 2014 UTC,"I'm going to try give an overview of it as its one of my favourite comics, so hopefully I do it justice.   Main premises of the universe it is set in:   1) chicken is outlawed, a deadly strain of bird flu killed a whole load of people and the government blamed chickens so now they're treated like a class A drug, it is illegal to be in possession and there is a thriving black market.  2) some people have food related powers such as being able to fashion weapons out of food or being able to see the future of any living thing that they eat.  The main character is cop and a ""Cibopath"" which gives him the power to see the past of anything he eats (except beetroot), once this is found out he gets moved to a FDA department dealing with violent food related crimes (which almost always include him eating parts of the crime scene/victims).   Obviously there is more going on but hopefully that gives you a vague overview. It is a very funny comic and has some great background gags and well written characters, I'd thoroughly recommend giving it a shot."

ImageComics,27owxt,ShinCoal,5,Mon Jun 9 12:31:51 2014 UTC,"Even though he is not my absolute favorite writer, he is writing what is currently my absolute favorite comic: East of West.  Hickman seems to be a real planner, both East of West as the Avengers/New Avengers arcs on Marvel are clearly going for a ending with a bang. A clear drawback of his writing style is that its far from an easy read, its not necessarily overly complicated technically, but issues tend to introduce a lot of new elements and he regularly takes a few issues to just show new or deepen older elements without actually moving the plot forwards.  This is certainly a style that could be called an acquired taste, some readers want to read books that allow for faster plots, and there is certainly nothing wrong with that, but in those cases Hickman stories might not be for them. Some would go as far as calling his stories convoluted.  The Manhattan Projects seem to suffer a little less from from massive introduction sprees, but I personally seem to be losing interest in this premise, ironically it doesn't feel like its going forward at all.  I still have to read his older self contained work, I have the Nightly News HC but had some trouble getting into the (pretty dark) story. Been waiting for a second chance ever since."

Also, God is Dead is a pretty interesting concept even though it's pretty light fair. Though he wrote the first arc he has since stepped away from that one.  I agree with you that he isn't the best writer out there, but he is a good writer.  I think that the reason he is so well regarded in general (and the reason I love reading his books) is that he is an idea man.  He can convey big ideas well.  He doesn't have Vaughan's characters or Gaiman's world crafting, but he has amazing big philosophical ideas and conveys them in interesting ways.    And right now he is killing it."

I really loved the Fermi story in the Vol 3. I am about halfway through Vol 4, and still very into it.  That being said I have not read any East of West. Anyone want to give a brief rundown and comparison. The only Hickman I have read is Manhattan Projects, so I am not sure if I am a Hickman guy, yet..."
ImageComics,27owxt,whopoopedthebed,2,Tue Jun 10 00:48:20 2014 UTC,"I read both in issues and let me tell you, East of West is built for trade.   It takes place in a future where America developed very differently. It is split up into a few large factions/borders; Indian country, a Chinese Dynasty, what is essentially the Confederacy, and a few others.   The story jumps around, but mainly follows Death, as in of the four horseman.  Essentially the horseman came at some point, did some shit, and Death kind of stayed behind and became a man with no name of sorts.    Honestly is it hard to describe, I am up to date and I am not 100% sure what is going on/ don't want to spoil what I do understand. But I would recommend picking up the first trade. It is definitely one of those series that may be best read in omnibus, or at the very least merits re reading before each new release.   It has very little tonal similarity to Manhattan Projects. It has the darkness of MP, but none of the sillyness."
ImageComics,27owxt,Rossegut,3,Tue Jun 10 09:22:31 2014 UTC,"While it isn't an Image book, his Secret Warriors series is a tour de force. Pick it up in Omnibus and spend the weekend in.   He is definitely a meant for trade writer, with the possible exception being Manhattan Projects which can be read either way just fine.   I think the success of his Fantastic Four run helped usher in a movement within Marvel that is allowing writers to tell longer multi arch stories (Remender too).  Also everyone in /r/dataisbeautiful would love almost every one of his books. The man puts graphs and charts in everything."
ImageComics,27owxt,jm001,2,Tue Jun 10 09:30:41 2014 UTC,"The only title of his I read is The Manhattan Projects. The first two trades seemed to set up a really fun story: WWII scientists toying with questionable science, with the intent of exploring the stars. But then volume 3 instantly tore that down... and volume 4 seemed to lack all direction.  I have no idea where Hickman is taking the series. If it has a plot, I'm having trouble pinpointing it. Maybe things will get back on track now that you-know-who is dead."
ImageComics,27owxt,MadMatMan,2,Mon Jun 9 15:53:02 2014 UTC,"What's up with the crazy bold? (I haven't been round here in a while and I'm finding it kind of hard to read).  Anyway, I think Hickman is OK, but while some authors are described (positively or negatively) as ""writing for the trade"", Hickman in my eyes writes for the omnibus.  I first ran across him in the first issue of The Nightly News, but it didn't grab me at all  - it seemed too ""wordy"" for me. It was shortly after I'd started reading comics, though, so I am planning to try it again a bit further down the line and see if my tastes have changed enough over the past few years to appreciate it more.  Short stories like Red Mass for Mars are fairly good, but in my experience feel like they should have been slightly longer because they didn't quite have room to spread their wings.  On the other hand, I haven't found that longer running books grip me on a monthly basis.  My favourite book by him so far is probably FF, over at Marvel (who I found much more interesting than the Fantastic Four proper).  I read a little bit of The Manhattan Projects, which I quite liked at first but found very repetitive very quickly. I may be overstating it in my recollection, but there seemed to be a lot of issues where SPOILER: it went for a shocking twist, and every time the twist was that there was an alternate version of a character  (Sorry, don't know how to format spoilers on this subreddit)."

Prophet has more of an grandiose, mythic feel to it, with an emphasis on its universe and 'lore' (if you'll excuse the term).  Saga is more intimate and character driven, with great art and a more suspenseful plot.  IMO Prophet might the best book Image is publishing right now, but I'm a little biased so take that with a grain of salt."

One being an alternate universe where the Apaches invaded Germany in WW1. Another being a society of ghost plants possessing monkeys to be civilization.  The only downside is they keep hopping at random time (their device has been sabotaged) so you don't really get to dwell on any of these other cultures. It's cool all the same.

ImageComics,272wm9,n0ahhhhh,2,Mon Jun 2 02:58:21 2014 UTC,"The text pieces at the end of a comic continuing the story are fairly uncommon for books right now.  It's a pretty jarring transition from the velocity of a comic sequence.  It really shows how reading text is from sequential art.  The sequence in the text piece occurs 10 years before what you have just seen occur in Rio de Janiero.  Rio takes place in 2019.  The text piece occurs in 2009.  It is not Zero's debriefing.  The scene depicts a scene in which Zizek, who has been using the name Michael Stoikovic as an alias, has been identified by a Bulgarian drug dealer.  The drug dealer, pragmatist that he is, still wants to offload some bulk Krokodil but he also wants to seal up the security holes.  There must be a rat.  The drug dealer lets Zizek know that he knows his real name.  He bring in two men carrying a third, badly beaten, man.  Zizek's guard, Carlyle, stands watch.  The drug dealer tells Zizek about Krokodil and then asks an impassive Zizek if the beaten man is indeed a security threat.  Zizek does not deny that he is a security threat.  In reality, this badly beaten man is a deep cover agent that Zizek is willing to sacrifices for whatever plot he is carrying out.  The badly beaten man accepts his fate and is killed.  There is a third yellow page.  Maybe you didn't flip there yet, confused by first two.  The third page names the badly beaten man as Mooney.  It identifies the drug dealer as Yievgeniy.  It is a third person narration but describes Carlyle's inner environment.  Later on, Carlyle kills the drug dealer, souring the deal that Zizek struck with him.  Carlyle feels the similarity between the broken and dying people in a drug house ridden with Krokodil and himself.  While the issue does not specifically name the man that Zero is to assassinate as Carlyle, it doesn't matter.  If the man is not Carlyle, then his reasons for leaving the Agency are the same as Carlyle: Zizek is toxic.  Zero is beginning to realize this.  Read on.  I don't want to spoil anything for you."
ImageComics,272wm9,HRWatson,2,Mon Jun 2 13:50:03 2014 UTC,"Okay. This was an awesome explanation. Thank you for taking the time to write that out. :) I finished vol. 1 so I think I'm caught up to speed.  So basically, Zizek has some sort of ulterior motive and Carlyle picked up on this, just like Zero is currently doing. Carlyle kills the drug dealer to mess up the plans that Zizek had because he feels that he is hiding something. Is that a fair statement?   All of this being a parallel to what is currently happening between Zero & Zizek.  Your explanation made this a whole lot easier to understand. The wording/narration of those yellow pages just threw me off, haha.  Again, thanks for your help! :D"
ImageComics,272wm9,HRWatson,2,Mon Jun 2 15:40:18 2014 UTC,"I think it would be safe to say that everyone in this book is hiding something.  Everyone knows everyone else is hiding something.  Trust is impossible in this story.  Carlyle realized what he was doing on this earth was poisonous to himself and the world.  Carlyle knows he can't stop Zizek.  He's too connected and too powerful.  So he screws up his Krokodil purchase and absconds to Rio.  Kinda, ""fuck the man, what can I do with the time I have left?""  Eventually, at the hands of Zero he pays for his transgression.  The poison inside Zizek is the focus of issue 7.  Zero accompanies Zizek to an analogous deal in Mexico.  Zero is going to take what he learned in episode 4 and make his own choice.  It's a very different choice.  Issue 8 takes place several hours later and deals with the fallout.  These text pieces can be really puzzling.  Who's talking? How do we know?  I had to read that piece a few times to figure out exactly what's going on.  I think it's worth it though.  Not a lot of comics ask you to work very hard right now.  Happy to help.  I think your question produces rewarding answers when you get further in the story.  Have you been been reading Copra by Fiffe?  He has an interesting way with dialogue.  If you enjoy Zero, I would suggest hunting it down.  Fiffe is also writing All New Ultimates and his style transfers to mainstream comics in an interesting way."

YouTube is a fantastic resource to learn a TON of art concepts you'll need to have a basic understanding of to start making decent looking pages. Don't let the amount of crap I'm about to show you scare you away. I've been coloring for 10 years off and on, and most of this stuff I didn't really grasp well until about 3 years ago.    This guy's channel is priceless for learning about light and shadow http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5dyu9y0EV0cSvGtbBtHw_w , and a lot of different art-related subjects.

And people are going to think that you were setup by me to ask about this, but I actually just launched an coloring course this week.   https://www.udemy.com/coloringcomics/?couponCode=COLOREDDIT  That link will make it $49. It's really thorough and comprehensive, and it goes through all the aspects of coloring. The last section even talks about how to go about trying to find your first coloring gig.  Honestly, I don't think there's anything else that thorough on the Internet right now unless you pay Chris Sotomayor $600 (and it's probably worth that, but still). I realize that all sounds a bit Billy Mays-ish but I created the course because I don't think there's enough coloring education out there, and the comics industry needs more good colorists.

You made it to the big time as an actual member of a comic book creative team. For Image freakin' Comics. That's the dream of most people on this sub. And you haven't forgotten about the little people, either! You just typed out an excellent, informative wall of text. Props to you."

This is my first monthly, and my first Image title, so I'm very excited.   I was pumped when the official Image Tumblr showed some art, so I'm going to try not to squeal like a little girl when I actually see the first issue with my name in it."

ImageComics,26tey2,Giraffosaurus,3,Thu Jun 26 12:26:06 2014 UTC,"Awesome resources... I will be taking a look at every single one. What about getting your foot into the business as opposed to the learning how part you mentioned? Like what was your process from learning how it is done and practice making it good, to getting a job that paid? What was that part like?"
ImageComics,26tey2,Giraffosaurus,3,Fri May 30 02:22:13 2014 UTC,"The last lecture of the course covers this as well, but basically the keys are don't swing for the fences first. A lot of people want to start by shooting for the big companies, and it's a mistake. You've got to prove that you can do the work and hit deadlines.   Start small. Search for want ads and forums and what not, and find gigs doing shorts... 4 pagers, 8 pagers, pinups, etc. And honestly don't expect to make a dime at first. You'll be offered lots of ""back-end"" deals. I have never made a single $1 from a back-end deal, but these gigs are important. They'll grow your portfolio, and make you better.  I worked for free or really cheap ($10-20/page) for probably a year or two or so. I did full-issues that turned into nothing.   I basically worked with artists and writers in the same boat as me. Nobody was getting paid much if at all, but we are all making comics.  I started trying out for gigs and didn't get a bunch, but got a few. Again... building the portfolio, getting better, getting faster. At this point, this is still indie stuff that nobody has really heard of.   Eventually, one of the artists I was working with got a gig with a indie publisher, Black Mask Studios, and they were looking for colorist for a 4-page short to be a backup story for a Liberator trade. The artist told them about me, and I got hired to work with some guy doing the writing and art. Again... Four. Whole. Pages. Big whoop, right?   That guy? Albert Einstein.   No, it was actually Tim Seeley -- as in Hack/Slash, Revival, (now Batman Eternal), Tim-freakin'-Seeley.  So, I geeked out briefly, colored that, and shortly after, another writer friend of mine emailed me to say that Rachel Deering was looking for a colorist for a short in In the Dark: A Horror Anthology (which is a 360-page badass hardcover collection by the way) for IDW. She didn't know me at all, and so she had me tryout, and she liked it. So I got that 11-page gig, and I wish I was making this up, but the writer on that short was... yeah... Tim Seeley. It was totally unrelated. He didn't refer me. I can't make this shit up.  Anyway, a few weeks later I got an email from one of Tim's editors offering 5-issues of Hack/Slash.   I used to wonder why creators didn't seem to tell these stories publicly. It's because it's generally a boring story. Some small gig turned into some medium-sized gig which turned into a big gig. There's some luck involved I'm sure, but you've got to put yourself in position to be lucky--which means... being a decent colorist and being able to finish projects.   A lot of people want to be able to say they do comics or want their name on a comic, but when they realize that's actual work, they fold."

ImageComics,26jpx4,Noodles1312,3,Tue May 27 02:42:01 2014 UTC,I thought this was a pretty funny and intriguing comic. I hope it continues.
ImageComics,26jpx4,Tahler,2,Tue May 27 05:08:49 2014 UTC,"I'm hella late again, so much to do so little time, should stop making promises, ugh.  I personally think that Todd is one of the best comedy comics around there on the moment. I think its on par with Superior Foes and Hawkeye (minus the waiting). I think its the strongest on Image in terms of laughs*, mostly since I'm getting tired of Sex Criminals (or Fraction in general).  What I love about Todd? The big middle finger it gives to normal story structure. Todd isn't a story, Todd is the freight train that rams through a story in progress every issue, and just continues when its done hanging around. I don't always agree with the whole ""Its not about the destination, its about the journey"", but in Todds his case its the absolute truth.  Gotta laugh about that unfortunate kid that always gets the blame of everything but in the end manages to land on his feet.  Not without its flaws, but great nonetheless.  *EDIT: I guess Manhattan Projects is also good for laughs, but I never saw it as a comedy.  Edit2: I'm an idiot, best comedy on Image is actually Rat Queens."

This might be big. I doubt that the series is coming to a total end, it feels bigger than, but it does appear to be the end of the current arc and probably the current age. Unless the next arc will be ""The Apocalypse: Year Two""  Very excited!  Low  Just look at this cover man: https://d138hkes00e90m.cloudfront.net/news_images/low_02.jpg  I haven't even read issue 1 yet (obviously) and I'm so much in love with this series already. Please gimme gimme.  Supreme: Blue Rose  Same shit man, just look at this: https://d138hkes00e90m.cloudfront.net/news_images/superemebluerose_2.jpg  Already subscribed obviously.  The Fade Out  Fatale is done by now, new Brubaker and Phillips excites me obviously. Will get the movie magazine variant.  Now some other shit, I'll just use the order on the website, won't discuss them all.  Dead@17:   A combination of name and cover never made me so uninterested. Was this a series before? Was it any good?  Black Science:   Happy to see it. Should probably praise it for what it is, one of the best series on the moment.  Drumhellar:  I gave up on this title, do other people actually read it? Not trying to be a dick, but I just don't hear ANY buzz at all. Anyone here enjoying it? Suprised to see it alive honestly.  The Manhattan Projects:  Still going strong I guess, kinda stopped being excited about new issues but I always give them a read and they never fail to bring a smile on my face.  Manifest Destiny:  Hope it keeps being so strong. The amount of strong titles on Image hold be back on writing some lovesong about it, but its good.  Revival:  Same thing, glad to see it alive.   Saga: Dittooooo  Sex Criminals: Starting to annoy me right now, but obviously its alive since a lot of people are in love.  Shutter: Feel like I should start pulling this, so much fun.  Spread: Cover makes me curious, seem to overlooked this on lat months solicitations.  Umbral: Still having fun reading this, should probably start pulling it but I only have limited money. Once again, glad to see this series alive."

The already cliche' dystopian future genre has been overused to the point that most are very predictable and really not worth your time. However, Lazarus has a different feel to it. It is a really entertaining read and Rucka is definitely putting forth a lot of effort into making very dynamically interesting characters and he isn't afraid to test the readers comfort level. If you are interested, read the first 4 issues and if you aren't hooked, then fucking read Black Science at least!"

ImageComics,256gz7,Argonaut13,5,Sat May 10 02:18:03 2014 UTC,"Similar in what way? What aspect of the story did you like?  Things you might have liked and want to see again checklist:   Frenetic multiverse action. Non-traditional panel layouts. Everyman protagonist. Solid romantic subplot with sci-fi twist. Multiple versions of the same character present within a story. Evil corporation as antagonist. Art-style.   Manhattan Projects has a nice little multiverse thing going on, but it's just starting to become prevalent in the story. 5 is definitely there for MPs though, and I think it's executed well. Homestuck has a lot of timeline/multiple universes stuff, but it's really long and it would take a while for you to get to that part of the story."

I've been collecting Manhattan projects since the beginning, and something in a somewhat similar sci-fi/light fantasy aspect would be pretty cool. Manhattan projects has a bit of a darker tone than I'm looking for. It's great in small doses, but I don't know if I can read another series with that much blood and gore.  Thanks for the Homestruck recommendation, I'll take a look at it. I'm kinda looking for something on the shorter side, but that's not necessarily a deal breaker."

ImageComics,25184z,admiraltoad,3,Thu May 8 11:38:24 2014 UTC,"I got the first issue because it is about Oregon and I live there. I am pretty glad I did, it looks like it can be pretty good. The art is great."
ImageComics,25184z,skinnyKss,2,Thu May 8 16:43:19 2014 UTC,It's off to a good start. Ready for the next issue
ImageComics,25184z,SmoothRide,2,Thu May 8 19:38:04 2014 UTC,"I just read it a few minutes ago and it seems great. Lots of potential. I felt the same way after reading Southern Bastards, this book has a ton of potential. Here is to hoping both books live up to their potential."
ImageComics,25184z,BobZebart,2,Fri May 9 05:17:41 2014 UTC,"I loved #1. Super creepy, and definitely took some cues from shows like Twin Peaks and Fargo in establishing a weird little setting. Loved the touch of honeybees flying around in the rain."
ImageComics,25184z,StupidBroats,1 point,Fri May 9 09:24:08 2014 UTC,Completely missed the Master Shake cameo. Good lookin out.   I'm really excited to see where they take this story. The creepy guy that is seen when Finch is staring into the distance towards the end of the book was a pretty creepy touch.
ImageComics,25184z,hunchbackduda,1 point,Thu May 8 16:53:15 2014 UTC,"Great art, great story and excellent pacing. It's rare that I make comments about pacing on a first issue, but this was fantastic. They introduced the story and characters quickly and efficiently while also developing an interest for me in what happens next."

ImageComics,24v2t3,patrickfahey,7,Tue May 6 13:49:08 2014 UTC,Sex Criminals. HBO should get all over that now.
ImageComics,24v2t3,CrazyDlAMOND,3,Tue May 6 18:23:28 2014 UTC,"An animated Peter Panzerfaust would be really cool.  I'll go with something different too, and say I'd go nuts for a series on Fatale. With the same kind of tone that True Detective had, but with genuinely supernatural and creepy things going on. It'd be so awesome and terrifying at the same time."
ImageComics,24v2t3,CrazyDlAMOND,2,Tue May 6 15:42:25 2014 UTC,"It's the first thing I thought about. There's so much tension and fear to build up with the series, and it would be so cool to see it all played out. The only problem I can think of would be the length. They wouldn't be able to keep it going for a long run, maybe just 1 or 2 seasons."
ImageComics,24v2t3,ChairmanW,6,Tue May 6 15:54:25 2014 UTC,Thief of Thieves is being developed as a TV series on AMC.
ImageComics,24v2t3,tjblack,4,Tue May 6 16:06:11 2014 UTC,Lazarus. Screams to be made into a show.
ImageComics,24v2t3,DreaHun,1 point,Wed May 7 01:33:21 2014 UTC,"seriously, it had a very unique view of the post-apocalypse, people ate that sh** up. Not to mention a truly badass fem protagonist."
ImageComics,24v2t3,TownsUnderground,5,Tue May 6 17:31:38 2014 UTC,I'd LOVE to see saga done right.
ImageComics,24v2t3,johnazoidberg-,5,Sun Sep 14 13:11:51 2014 UTC,"I would too, but I remember reading that the entire motive behind Saga is that it could never be a TV show or movie and could only be a comic"
ImageComics,24v2t3,TownsUnderground,2,Tue May 6 15:27:51 2014 UTC,Yeah. I like that about it too. Oh well... In a perfect world/moon.
ImageComics,24v2t3,skeever2,3,Wed May 7 01:41:58 2014 UTC,I'd love to see an invincible movie!
ImageComics,24v2t3,skeever2,3,Wed May 7 02:27:54 2014 UTC,Peter Panzerfaust or Rat Queens
ImageComics,24v2t3,lickmyelbows,3,Wed May 7 02:40:03 2014 UTC,I know AMC got preacher and Seth Rogan is the writer so I'm a bit worried. Y! The last man would be awesome.
ImageComics,24v2t3,SmoothRide,3,Wed May 7 02:41:22 2014 UTC,"Not an Image title, but American Vampire would be an amazing show to watch on TV.  I'd also like to see Sixth Gun become a TV series. It even almost did. NBC almost ordered a pilot for it but that was terminated. Sorry, once again not an Image comic.  I think Revival would also be an entertaining TV show."
ImageComics,24v2t3,the_one_true_b,3,Wed May 7 05:59:34 2014 UTC,I rights were optioned for Happy! a while back but was disappointed nothing every came of it.  Side discussion: Whatever happened to the Revival series being developed?
ImageComics,24v2t3,oxygen_addiction,3,Wed May 7 21:38:49 2014 UTC,ABC passed on it and then apparently ripped off the concept and made their own show.
ImageComics,24v2t3,the_one_true_b,2,Sun May 11 00:07:59 2014 UTC,...well damn.
ImageComics,24v2t3,oxygen_addiction,1 point,Wed May 14 19:51:03 2014 UTC,Yup...fuck network television.  Hopefully they try to get it done via the web once Revival becomes bigger.
ImageComics,24v2t3,sandals0sandals,2,Wed May 14 19:55:00 2014 UTC,Godland or Madman
ImageComics,24v2t3,SHsquared,2,Wed May 14 20:01:00 2014 UTC,"We are only 3 issues in, but based on the concept and what I've seen in said issus - I would love to see Mercenary Sea turned into a series"
ImageComics,24v2t3,SmoothRide,3,Tue May 6 18:59:36 2014 UTC,How good is that? I've heard mixed things.
ImageComics,24v2t3,SHsquared,2,Tue May 6 21:49:04 2014 UTC,"I love it. The story is filled w/ little touches that make the setting and characters believable (if a little cliche at the start, but its well done) and the art is amazing! It's such a beautiful book. I'd recommend checking it out - it's great IMO"
ImageComics,24v2t3,SmoothRide,2,Wed May 7 23:22:05 2014 UTC,So I finally got around to reading the first volume of Morning Glories that I got from the Humble Bundle. That would make a good show on like CW or something.
ImageComics,24v2t3,Wakkadude21,2,Thu May 8 01:23:58 2014 UTC,The Walking Dead could actually be a great show.  Morning Glories would be a fun Lost/Twin Peaksy type show.
ImageComics,24v2t3,CMelody,1 point,Wed May 7 23:42:13 2014 UTC,"The Sword, or anything the Luna Brothers have written.  I'm actually rather surprised Ultra hasn't already been turned into a movie because it would seem to appeal to both men and women."
ImageComics,24v2t3,AbnormalDream,1 point,Wed May 7 04:16:25 2014 UTC,I think Saga would be incredible but I remember reading that they specifically didn't want it made into anything but a comic. I can respect that but goddamnit it would be amazing. I once heard it called 'Star Wars - Game Of Thrones crossover' which is a perfect way to describe it.
ImageComics,24v2t3,geekgentleman,1 point,Mon May 12 02:25:00 2014 UTC,"Lazarus, definitely. Also, the Fuse and Sheltered. These are sci-fi stories that aren't as complex as East of West, for instance, and would translate easier to the screen. The Mercenary Sea could make for a fun Indiana Jones-type adventure movie."
ImageComics,24v2t3,ben13allen,1 point,Mon May 12 03:01:57 2014 UTC,"I think HBO should pick up the rights to make a Saga tv series, I think that its right up their alley. Imagine it like the child of Star Wars and Game of Thrones."

ImageComics,24sm7w,the_one_true_b,2,Tue May 6 01:00:46 2014 UTC,"asked this same question a little while ago, best answer i got was assume it's on hold with no news about new issues or it ending... i know it's a sucky answer"
ImageComics,24sm7w,thebubbazanetti,2,Mon May 5 18:43:49 2014 UTC,"This, those, and Non-Player.  Would love to hear from all four's creators."
ImageComics,24sm7w,kesselrun_7,2,Tue May 6 02:53:30 2014 UTC,"The creator of Non-Player got into a very serious accident a long time ago. Issue 2 is on the way, but it'll be awhile. Last update was November 2013."
ImageComics,24sm7w,wishinghand,1 point,Tue May 13 20:27:30 2014 UTC,That's terrible!  I hope they mend up well.  Thank you for letting me know.
ImageComics,24sm7w,kesselrun_7,2,Wed May 14 05:19:08 2014 UTC,"I think issues have been solicited, but nothing further has happened. Even as one of my favorite current books, I'm not holding my breath, and will likely be waiting for the trade if it ever does return. The delays make it too hard to follow issue-by-issue."
ImageComics,24sm7w,holemole,2,Tue May 6 04:35:04 2014 UTC,Remember Hell Yeah! ? Guys?
ImageComics,24sm7w,hansel08,1 point,Tue May 6 05:05:15 2014 UTC,this was easily my favorite series of 2013.  I imagine [hope] they're getting the next issues ready for a consistent release schedule. the delays on vol 1 were heinous
ImageComics,24sm7w,Sploderz,1 point,Tue May 6 05:18:21 2014 UTC,"This is sometimes the case with smaller Image comics. Release dates can get unpredictable. They don't have the corporate deadlines associated with Marvel and DC (even those get broken though, like Ultimate Wolverine vs Hulk)."

ImageComics,24r6vb,JSFord815,1 point,Mon May 5 18:28:39 2014 UTC,"My bad. I should have read your entire post. Those are just a few Image prints, not from Sejic."

Stjepan has some excellent work on Witchblade for the earlier #100 and beyond issues - search him on www.topcow.com."
ImageComics,24r6vb,AllenJacoby,2,Wed May 14 21:26:57 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I've been reading Aphrodite IX and Witchblade (ron marz).  Will look for that crossover when it comes."
ImageComics,24qai1,nopushpins,6,Sun May 4 23:15:21 2014 UTC,Don't know if it's on there but Fatale would probably fit the bill since you said you want realistic detective fiction and it's great
ImageComics,24qai1,ostentatiousox,6,Mon May 5 00:31:53 2014 UTC,"East of West and Manhattan Projects, maybe?"
ImageComics,24qai1,pacotacobell,3,Sun May 4 23:53:38 2014 UTC,Five Ghosts and Rat Queens are pretty enjoyable reads. Five Ghosts reminds me of Indiana Jones with a cool twist. Rat Queens is like an MMO with really raunchy characters.
ImageComics,24qai1,i_appreciate_you,3,Mon May 5 03:24:12 2014 UTC,PROPHET
ImageComics,24qai1,bestfriendrand,2,Mon May 5 04:58:31 2014 UTC,"Saga is pretty interesting. It's almost like a twist on Romeo and Juliet. Well, if they were two warring alien species from different planets."

ImageComics,24qai1,Batterup77,1 point,Mon May 5 02:18:51 2014 UTC,"Chew and Invincible are my 2 favorite Image comic books!  Invincible is probably my favorite...  Once you get into it it turns into a whole universe of super heroes.  Tech Jacket is pretty awesome also (for the sci fi aspect you are into) he is part of the Invincible uni, and had a short series... I don't know if issue 1 is on comixology though... There is also a brand new 3 issue mini series for him."
ImageComics,24qai1,WW4O,1 point,Mon May 5 14:33:19 2014 UTC,"IMO, Invincible is the best superhero book on shelves. The Walking Dead is also worth it, and far superior to the tv show. Although the beauty of the free #1 system is that you get a sample of everything, these two (and any comic that's been running for ten years) change and grow significantly from their origins."
ImageComics,24ooro,ShinCoal,1 point,Sun May 4 10:28:29 2014 UTC,2 series on this I'd like to see more of...Todd the Ugliest Kid on Earth & Dangerclub
ImageComics,24ooro,the_one_true_b,1 point,Mon May 5 00:45:14 2014 UTC,Revival and Morning Glories are two of my favorites right now.  Though Morning Glories really needs to start moving the plot along.

ImageComics,24jaxh,SpaZticHero,1 point,Fri May 2 22:55:47 2014 UTC,"Man, this series keeps getting better and better for me. Probably my favorite issue to date, because I felt it went for a lighter tone, and still managed to convey how fucked up their world is."
ImageComics,24jaxh,Argonaut13,1 point,Sat May 3 02:58:44 2014 UTC,"Yeah, this series is quickly becoming a current favorite of mine.  Image is killing it lately, with this, Saga, and now Southern Bastards.  Really digging their stuff.  Love Remender's writing as well, got into him thanks to his wonderful work on Uncanny X-Force.  That was a wild ride.  I hear Black Science by him is incredible as well but have yet to get into it."
ImageComics,24j4br,ShinCoal,2,Fri May 2 09:54:56 2014 UTC,I made the jump from trades/hardcovers only to collecting floppies. How can one start better than by buying the complete East of West until now:  click  Also got the second East of West trade and the first Rat Queens trade:  click  Issue 5 of Black Science (already ordered the entire backlog prior of these) and special edition hardcover of the Nightly News:  click
ImageComics,24j4br,sandals0sandals,2,Fri May 2 09:58:43 2014 UTC,What's this Nightly News about?
ImageComics,24j4br,holemole,2,Fri May 2 22:54:59 2014 UTC,"Its Hickman's debut book. Its a pretty dark and political book about the downsides to our current media structure and the people who get fucked over in the process, there's an order opposing this and they are ready to fuck shit up."

ImageComics,24da4u,holemole,1 point,Thu May 1 05:09:20 2014 UTC,"I liked this overall, as I did with the original one-shot. My biggest gripe was the lack of voice-over with this comic."
ImageComics,24aogd,admiraltoad,4,Tue Apr 29 18:17:24 2014 UTC,"Holy shit thats insane. The $15 tier is laughable, but I advise everyone to get into the $7 tier if they haven't been collecing the majority of the comics already (and even then)."
ImageComics,24aogd,ShinCoal,6,Tue Apr 29 19:12:46 2014 UTC,"I'm slightly confused, by volume one do they mean issue one? Or like the first volume of the trade? I guess this is obvious actually considering the price, but the language used isn't necessarily clear...  Edit: just did a bit more reading, this really is the trades, that's insane. Getting this immediately!"
ImageComics,24aogd,ghostnuts,3,Wed Apr 30 00:04:24 2014 UTC,I'm going to try and turn my friends on to some of these series. Too good to be missed.

ImageComics,24aogd,_yen,6,Wed Apr 30 08:53:59 2014 UTC,"They come in a choice of DRM free formats, PDF in 2 qualities, epub, cbr and cbz. That means no Comixology or Image app support, but its better that way.  I'm guessing that you have an iPad as you have the Image app. Image has a good list of apps that work with these formats here."

ImageComics,249xhs,admiraltoad,4,Tue Apr 29 13:42:13 2014 UTC,The Manhattan Projects would make for a grotesque and brilliant cartoon.

ImageComics,249xhs,undertoe420,3,Tue Apr 29 22:24:33 2014 UTC,Invincible a million times over. It would translate wonderfully to a cartoon.

ImageComics,23syge,Rossegut,3,Thu Apr 24 01:42:57 2014 UTC,It seems to me it's just what they think the market will bear. Another example of Image sliding back on the 9.99 price point is Walking Dead Vol. 1 is now 14.99 when it was 9.99.  In my opinion all trades should be 9.99. At 14.99 the price per issue is basically the same price as the floppies.
ImageComics,23py1z,Melanismdotcom,6,Tue Apr 22 22:57:54 2014 UTC,Chew is awesome. It could be a superstar on adult swim
ImageComics,23py1z,AlconTheFalcon,3,Wed Apr 23 13:47:24 2014 UTC,"Agreed - Adult Swim would be an awesome place for Chew. It's just strange enough for Adult Swim, yet would still appeal to a wide audience."
ImageComics,23py1z,holemole,3,Wed Apr 23 18:42:24 2014 UTC,"Hopefully it actually goes through this time, I got excited when they announced the Showtime series just to be canned a year later. I think the animated format will work a lot better for Chew (hoping they can recreate Guillory's style which is perfect for the writing).   [...] the animated feature adaptation of the popular comic from Image Comics.   Does that mean a movie length release? A TV series on FX/FXX would be awesome."
ImageComics,23py1z,drchasedanger,3,Wed Apr 23 00:22:44 2014 UTC,"I would love a TV series, but I'll take anything I can get after the disappointment with Showtime. Of all the Image comics I enjoy, Chew is the one that I love the most and think has the best chance of being a hit with wider audiences. I grew tired of Walking Dead around season 2 and issue 100, but I did love the actor who played Glenn, and I think he'd be a great Tony."
ImageComics,23py1z,Batterup77,2,Wed Apr 23 02:46:23 2014 UTC,"I think the walking dead comic hit it's high point at issue 100... I still read it, and the current arc has been pretty good.

ImageComics,23q8mt,hiltonking,3,Wed Apr 23 00:50:49 2014 UTC,I'm really enjoying Velvet. It's a really awesome spy thriller with a strong female lead and every time I read it I feel like I'm watching an incredibly cool action movie. I would definitely recommend it.
ImageComics,23q8mt,ban_radi0,3,Wed Apr 23 03:12:47 2014 UTC,It's really good! Definitely pick it up.
ImageComics,23q8mt,boskoyouth,3,Wed Apr 23 04:27:45 2014 UTC,It's so good. Ed Brubaker is the man.
ImageComics,23q8mt,thesedogsarebarkin,3,Wed Apr 23 06:19:29 2014 UTC,"I'm a huge Brubaker fan, so despite not being initially impressed I have stuck with it for the time being. I honestly think it's just okay. If anybody else was writing it, I would have dropped it after the second issue. It definitely seems like something that would be more enjoyable in a trade format, because I'm sure it will only become stronger as the series continues but at the moment it really isn't the strongest thing he's ever put out. I'm all for doing something different and I love the spy genre, but it's only been okay so far honestly. I say check it out if you're interested, but it definitely isn't as superb as Criminal. It still feels like it's in its infancy too much, like he has all these great ideas that will come to a head in awesome ways and the character certainly does grow on you, but it doesn't feel like it's established itself as strongly as you'd expect from Brubaker, hence why I said I feel it'll probably be awesome to read in a more completed fashion."

Dark Engine looks like it could be fun, Spread has an appealing cover so I'm going to try that, not sure what to think about the Aphrodite/Cyber Force crossover since the story is pretty much connected already.  A lot of TPB's, just when I decided to knock off with my TPB buying rampage, a few more HC's would have been nice I guess.   Obviously good to see East of West, Black Science, Alex & Ada, Revival, Manhattan Projects, Saga, Sex Criminals, Sovereign, Velvet and Umbral continueing, the amount of other series is starting to make my head spin, should probably drop a few of the latter."

ImageComics,23lnzu,ShinCoal,1 point,Mon Apr 21 21:14:40 2014 UTC,"I wasn't sure about it either, but the 2nd issue was great. It had a lot more lore and whatnot to explain the world that is being created. As someone who is reading both Dune and A Song of Ice and Fire, the writing is very similar to both. Many similar plot devices are used as well. I like that this is a fantasy series not inspired by the European Middle Ages, which most fantasy does. I love the 2-3 page lore sections in the back pages. They are very detailed and are so well thought out and written that it feel like the events actually happened. However I wished instead of just text, I wish they would have put some art to it.  This series is shaping up to be very interesting."

ImageComics,23lzzi,alaricus,2,Mon Apr 21 19:06:04 2014 UTC,"So, you know how the typical superhero is someone who gets powers and realizes they have a responsibility for the safety of their city?  Godland is basically a superhero realizing that he has a responsibility to the universe.  The easiest way to describe Godland is that its the work of Jack Kirby treated as a genre of comics. It takes the art style, story themes and mind expanding concepts of Kirby-style creations like Darkseid and The New Gods, and creates a brand new story in that mold.  Joe Casey writes a story that is equal parts humor, action and drama. Tom Scioli creates modern art that follows the Kirby method to an extreme level. Overall you are left with a very entertaining comic book."
ImageComics,23lzzi,doody_shoes,2,Mon Apr 21 19:28:13 2014 UTC,"Oh, and one more thing about Godland, if you read the first issue or trade, and decide you want to collect it, the Godland Celestial Edition books collect two trade paperbacks at a time and are amazing."

Lazarus has been running longest, I forget how many issues in that one but the others are 3-6 issues so far.   Lately, except for Revenge, I feel like Image does no wrong. Not that Revenge was necessarily wrong for everyone but definitely not my style(ironic bad on purpose)."

Pretty Deadly and Black Science are one of the most beautifully drawn comics being released right now, although their story telling is a bit odd and not my cup of tea. But I still enjoy them.  Lazarus is awesome. As is Rat Queens. If these are too many, get Lazarus and Rat Queens but if you can get them all then go for it."
ImageComics,23kpde,EvilMagician,2,Mon Apr 21 07:25:57 2014 UTC,"In relation to the monthly title the Batman crossover fell right in the middle of the first volume. It was what prompted Jackie to start trying to be a hero (in a badly conceived storyline). I think it brings Ripclaw in shortly afterwards. Honestly it's not very good, and you only really need to read the last issue or two for setup for the next thing.  Which is Paul Jenkins' soft reboot. That returns Jackie to New York and back in with the mob. This is basically where The Darkness kicks off proper, the series before that after the opener was never sure what it was doing, though obviously did set up some things like Angelus and Magdalena. But if you've read up to Batman you've read all the important stuff."
ImageComics,23j1h3,DGer,5,Sun Apr 20 18:54:21 2014 UTC,I don't know why people on the Internet like to make it an either or thing. I enjoy titles from both. Just to blow peoples' minds I also read some DC and some indie publishers. Scandalous I know.
ImageComics,23j1h3,kalic00,2,Mon Apr 21 05:14:21 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's a matter of one or the other either, but I do have my preferences towards Image. The reason for that? Whilst plenty probably like the interconnected universes of Marvel and DC, I for one enjoy being able to pick any comic series of the rack and read it without knowledge from other series. Besides references in some of Invincible universe, for example, every series is relatively self-contained."
ImageComics,23j1h3,Random_Avenger,1 point,Mon Apr 21 09:44:34 2014 UTC,"many Marvel and DC series are also self-contained (Hawkeye, swamp thing, and Harley Quinn off the top of my head). You can read any of them independently of having read prior issues/other books in the universe. The Darkness/Witchblade, published by top cow/Image are riddled in crossovers, and make no sense if you just read one of them."
ImageComics,23j1h3,Random_Avenger,8,Mon Apr 21 16:36:18 2014 UTC,"While this is fine and all to prefer Image, Marvel still easily competes and even beats Image in a lot of aspects as well. this article is just a poor opinion piece.  There are still ""Image"" like comics in Marvel. Hawkeye? Young Avengers? Ms Marvel? She-Hulk?   The covers... Again, I refer you to the comics listed above, and to add to them Uncanny X-Men,  Print quality paper? Soon that won't even matter as digital comics are on the rise and print is slowly dying. Seems like Marvel is technically smarter by embracing it with stuff like the Marvel Infinite stuff. True, Marvel does have lots of ads. However, a LOT of people and newer readers in general tend to read trades so there aren't even any ads in the stories. More for less? Marvel limits the amount of current books out, just like DC. Just because there's a lot of gems in Image doesn't mean there aren't duds. In fact, a lot of the problems arise because Image is a lot of stories that are creator owned so they don't have an editorial staff nearly as strict as Marvel to keep them on deadline. That's what you're paying for with the big 2: consistency. Not to mention that Marvel offers FREE digital copy on the $3.99 books if you buy in print. Image does NOT. Oh... And Marvel has plenty of 2.99 books just like Image has plenty of 3.50 books.   Is Image bad? Absolutely not. They have amazing individual stories that are well crafted. However, what if someone wanted more than just that one story? Something to expand on. Manhattans Project, Saga, SEX, East of West, Spawn, Think Tank, and a whole bunch of other stories aren't connected. The ones that are have brached out into their own smaller production company like Top Cow for the Witchblade and Artifacts Universe. Marvel does allow you to combine different books to tell a bigger story.  Image doesn't make Marvel look bad. They just do things differently.

I do prefer Image over Marvel, however, because of the very thing which you listed as an appeal to Marvel or DC also for the matter. Whilst I can understand why some might enjoy a great interconnected universe, I for one prefer series which are self-contained.   Most of Image's series can be picked up and read. There are no crossovers to worry about or whatnot, which in my opinion is nice. Even when there are references to other comic series, such as with Robert Kirkman's Invincible universe (e.g. Invincible refers to The Astounding Wolf-Man), it's subtle and not impending on that individual series story."

Also the article mentioned that there are nice Marvel covers (including the Hawkeye one you selected).

ImageComics,22qwac,TG_Naptown,4,Fri Apr 11 02:21:44 2014 UTC,New Father Prophet. Hands down. Love me some space opera epic.
ImageComics,22qwac,i_appreciate_you,3,Fri Apr 11 06:03:39 2014 UTC,"Chew.  The story of a detective that can see the past of whatever, and I mean whatever, he eats.  Incredible story, writing, artwork, and pacing.  I can't begin to describe how fleshed out the characters are.  Its set in a world where chicken is illegal and there exists a vibrant black market for it.  I'm currently through #30 and have no bloody clue where this wild story is going.  Especially recommend if you like detective stories and maybe not so much if you don't want to see some pretty nasty violence."
ImageComics,22qwac,Bosstis,2,Fri Apr 11 04:35:26 2014 UTC,"I checked out issues 1 - 17 over the past few days and I think this is a really clever, albeit out-there, concept. That being said, there is just something about it that isn't capturing my attention as much as other titles."
ImageComics,22qwac,Bosstis,1 point,Tue Apr 15 19:23:47 2014 UTC,"Fair enough.  Image is putting out quality works all over the place, so I can't fault your comment.  I will say that the next few issues after where you stopped get pretty intense.  Mason Savoy comes back on the scene in a big way and there's a highly interesting teaser that has not been explained through issue 30.    I also am excited by the fact that this series will have an end, though can't remember if the author said it would be 50 or 60 total.  So I will get to see where this crazy ish is headed and it won't be some flame out where the author wants to keep around a character or scenario to return to.  Talon in the Batman New 52 series is coming to mind.  For some reason, I often do not have the energy to keep reading a series that will go on for perpetuity, though Saga will test that theory."
ImageComics,22qwac,FindMitch,1 point,Thu Apr 17 18:52:59 2014 UTC,"awesome series. but stopped reading after the late 20s.      it's easy to lose interest when you have to wait 1 whole month for like a 16 page book. a book, i might add, that has very few words.      the trades make for a better read. but they're so goddamn expensive. yes...I torrent but then you run into the problem of reading off your computer screen which is also tiring.      gawd..."
ImageComics,22qwac,ShinCoal,3,Fri Apr 11 05:32:22 2014 UTC,"Sorry, but you are dead wrong about them being expensive. Image TPB's are cheap as dirt, Chew is nothing different in that regard."

For me, my favorite character is Invincible but you've already been reading that so I would say maybe check out The Astounding Wolf-man. Another Kirkman book and you would've already met the character depending on how far you are in Invincible. If you're looking for something a bit different then maybe check out Revival, really cool horror series."

I know DC and Marvel also kinda have this problem, but in this case it just feels like too much.

ImageComics,21pws5,gilvoth,2,Sun Mar 30 19:21:37 2014 UTC,"Interesting, thanks for posting. Pretty Deadly is currently on my pull list and I've been enjoying it although mostly hearing people locally talk about the negatives and giving up after the second issue. I've been trying to get some of them to give it another shot but not much luck yet, two issues really isn't enough to make the decision.  Ten Grand is one I've been seeing and curious about and was thinking of picking up. Researched a bit more after reading this article and found more of the same so thanks for saving a bit of time and money for me there..."

I really like this book, so much so that if you go back in my post history you'll see I posted 4 really great pages from issue #5.  I say give it a chance, I did (got the first four issues as part of a trade on r/comicswap) and I'm really happy I did."
ImageComics,21pws5,gilvoth,2,Sun Mar 30 04:40:27 2014 UTC,"Oh no, definitely not solely off of this review but found a few others that seemed to agree.. I'm still somewhat curious, if I find a sale on comixology or something I might check it out still."
ImageComics,21pws5,ShinCoal,2,Sun Mar 30 14:00:55 2014 UTC,"I heard a lot of people complain about the change in art on Ten Grand, me one of them, the previous artist had a way better fit with the story.  THAT SAID, this is FAR from a commonly accepted opinion. Yes there are people who dislike Ten Grand, but there are loads of people who think its great, at the same time there are LOADS of people who criticize Pretty Deadly and find it unreadable.  Reviewers are not some universal good, they are readers just like you.   I like both of 'em."
ImageComics,21pws5,Bolognaous_Monk,1 point,Sun Mar 30 13:11:07 2014 UTC,I'm not a huge fan of the current art I do like that it wasn't arbitrarily injected into the story. I was talking about this w/ the GF last week. Something takes place in the story that explains why things look differently and the reason is complimented by the style of art despite dislike of said style. Hopefully Templesmith will be back for the next story arc
ImageComics,21pws5,Colossonaut,1 point,Sun Mar 30 15:59:09 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I thought the change in artwork was because of the story (it fits perfectly) Now if Templesmith doesn't come back when Joe finishes his biz in this arc then there might be something to bitch about. But I find this complaint to be a bit premature."

Now I could do a cut-and-paste from solicitations archives, but then it'd need to be verified with actual printed products. Solicitations are unreliable as a source, too much is solicited but never really released. Not to mention the odd stuff, like conventions specials and limited variant covers (it's not Image, but IDW Red Label line is not even solicited on Previews)."

To me the current story is good but it is developing very slow.  But according to Mcfarlane is 250 will be a triple issue and is supposed to shake things up.

Yeah its a bit confusing at first, but I felt that they did a really good job at introducing the world and nothing more (which I think was the idea). Most of the characters were not really introduced yet, but that's nothing the future can't solve (and the text in the back already did a large portion of that).  This book is also really, really pretty. Right up my alley! Will buy paperback trades asap.  BTW I think its a bit weird that Image started using Popgun as a reference for artists. I think Popgun is great in its own right. But its roster is insanely big and I don't think that the stories are prominent enough to warrant a reference over other work."

I like the art, and I loved the first two story lines (third was good, but not as good imho), but it felt like a teaser for three different comics. I'll give it another few comics to see how they treat the multiple story lines at once, but if it only gives us this taste each time I won't be able to keep reading. I get impatient."

I bought Godland Celestial Vol. 1, Fables Deluxe Hardcover vol 1, Marvels hardcover, Hulk: Gray hardcover, all of which with the exception of Fables have been out of print for a while. They've all gotten reprints either now or scheduled for later this year.(Fables dropped out of inventory at most sites for about 4 months)  Just to give you a preview, then, of what's next? Last week I bought Madman Gargantua and Madman Atomica, the Runaways hardcover that's issues #1-18, and Frank Miller's Complete Spider-man. Get ready!"

Normally I try to get up to speed with a series for the Discussion of the week, especially if its a limited series by one of my favorite writers. I mean, goddamn its Hickman! East of West man, the guy even makes me not dislike Fantastic Four!  But I'm going to be honest, I couldn't get through this one. Its not bad, its not even necessarily too hard on my mind, but I was just way too upbeat (not implying that's a bad thing) this week and this was such a 180 degrees change that I just had to put it down, goddamn its so fucking gloomy. Will read, one day.  I hope someone has something better to say, I kinda dread the prospect that nobody has anything to say this week.

Have read east of west, manhattan projects, his 3 current avenger comics + infinity, part of his f4 and ff runs, and this feels like a way heavier read than ANY of those.  Not only is it pretty violent/harsh, its minimalistic in its color use, its dialog heavy, theres a lot of graphs/infotexts and i honestly felt confused what he reading order of panels was on some pages. But really cant comment if the story is a quality story, but considering this pretty much kickstarted his carreer, it should be good."

Some books talk at great length about art and can be quite interesting. Other books show the author creating amazing illustrations but don’t always give you the information you need to achieve similar results. The most helpful art instruction books don’t merely talk about art, or show you art, they teach you how to create something you could not have achieved before owning the book. Hi-Fi Color for Comics provides you with step-by-step tutorials and artwork teaching you how to color comic book illustrations from start to finish."

Its fucking great, I go into it a bit deeper here: click  May saw the kickoff of Ten Grand. J. Michael Straczynski is a bit hit or miss for me, but it ended up as another wonderful series! Sadly I feel kinda confused whether I still like it as much with the new artist.  I started a bit late with Todd, the Ugliest Kid on Earth, but it has been absolutely great. Thanks /u/Noodles1312 and /u/the_one_true_b !  Five Weapons is apparently targeted to a younger audience, but I honestly love the shit out of it, so happy it turned into a ongoing!  End of the year had an insane amount of really cool new series: Rat Queens, Black Science, Manifest Destiny, Umbral, Velvet, Pretty Deadly, Sex Criminals, Alex + Ada, Dead Body Road, The Saviors. I'm not even going to elaborate on this. Few of these might drop off, but the amount of quality series in hands of Image right now is just insane.  What a great year!  P.S.

ImageComics,1zyi4f,jm001,4,Sun Mar 9 10:07:09 2014 UTC,"Most image stuff is in its own universe, but there is a shared universe of sorts known as skybound and populated by Kirkman characters. There is some overlap with The Astounding Wolf-Man, Brit and Tech Jacket both show up, and I know that Guarding the Globe is an offshoot of Invincible. However I'm not sure how much of a connection there is to other image comics - I know Savage Dragon shows up a bunch but I haven't looked into that at all.   And there are a huge amount of good books out from image. I'm particularly enjoying Bedlam at the moment and The Manhattan Projects, Saga etc. all have avid lobbyists (and not without good reason) but if you're looking for something to read in trade similar to Invincible then I'd say that The Astounding Wolf-Man would be a good shout."
ImageComics,1zyi4f,jm001,1 point,Sun Mar 9 11:16:09 2014 UTC,"I understand that most of the series are in their own self-included universe, bar the occasional crossover event, and I'm not complaining. That is a strength if you ask me, because it makes a comic series much easier to enjoy for newbies such as myself. With Batman, I've had to read tons of TPBs and comics from a variety of series to catch certain events (for example, Death of the Family). However, with Invincible, I just started at Volume 1 and so far everything makes perfect sense.  Having said that, where does the new series of Invincible Universe fit into things? Is it actually about Invincible, or more of just the other characters which occupy his universe? I also heard about some prequel comics, explaining the origins of Atom Eve and Rex and whatnot, so are those any good?  Do you happen to know what other comics Cory Walker has worked on, out of curiosity? One of my favourite things about Invincible, believe it or not, is its art-style. It's a really nice change from the dark and gritty featured in almost every single DC comic nowadays. I love the simplicity and vibrancy, which really suits the superhero-genre if you ask me.  Finally, with regards to what to read within Image, I'll probably check out most - if not all - of Kirkman's comics. He's a really good writer. Does anyone have a list of all of his released Image comics?"
ImageComics,1zyi4f,ShinCoal,3,Sun Mar 9 11:52:49 2014 UTC,"The Atom Eve and Rex Splode books were good. I'd also recommend Science Dog if you can get it.   Try searching Comicvine for Kirkman and it should have every comic he's worked on under ""appearances"" - I'd also recommend The Irredeemable Ant-Man if you fancy something else by him - it's great fun, and while one issue does tie in to World War Hulk iirc no knowledge of the event is really required and honestly you can read it knowing very little about the Marvel universe at all. I can't remember for sure, but Cory Walker may have worked on that one too. Again, check comicvine.   I haven't got to Invincible Universe myself, so I can't speak on that I'm afraid."

ImageComics,1zyi4f,DaveSilver,3,Mon Mar 10 03:33:35 2014 UTC,"Hey man, here's a quick rundown of all the series and mini-series related to Invincible and when you can/should read them.  First of all, Brit had three one-shots which were published before or right around when Invincible began. On top of that, there was a Brit series which lasted 12 issues that ran around the time of Invincible issue 50, so if you read it after that point, you will be fine.  Next you have Tech Jacket which had a six issue series which was actually published before any of the Brit one-shots. On top of that, a number of issues of Invincible included Tech jacket back-up stories, and finally there was a 3 issue series called tech Jacket Digital which was just released and overlaps with Invincible around the time of issue 60.  The third side series is Astounding Wolf-Man. I can't tell you exactly when it started, but Wolf-Man actually crosses over with Invincible for the first time in Invincible issue 57, and Wolf-Man issue 11. So if you move backwards from that, you should start reading Wolf-Man around issue 46 of Invincible. You could do it later than that because the stories don't really overlap much other than that one crossover, and it's not even super important, but that's probably the earliest you'd want to read it.  The fourth series is Guarding the Globe/Invincible Universe. Guarding the Globe is a mini-series which ran for six issues and was published between issues 70-77 of Invincible. It covers what was happening to the Guardians during that period since Invincible was temporarily away from Earth. After the initial GotG mini-series there was another six issue mini-series which was a sequel to the original. Finally, after issue 100 of Invincible the GotG series was re-launched as an ongoing series called Invincible Universe and for the most part it runs side-by-side with Invincible. The two don't overlap too much other than in the rare scenarios where events from one are alluded to in another.  Finally, you have Invincible presents: Atom Eve, and Invincible presents: Atom Eve and Rex-Plode. The first one tells the origin of Eve, and the second tells the origin of Eve and Rex's relationship and how they met. Both series occur before the first issue of Invincible and can be read at any time.   I'll also warn you that there are a few random mini-issues you may not see in the trades which deal with the origins of characters like Dupli-Kate, the Immortal, a character you may not have met yet named Monster Girl, and I think one other. I want to say they are available in the second and third Ultimate Collections but I'm sure you can get them other ways.  Beyond that, the only other Invincible appearances are random one offs or minis that have little to no impact on anything. The series I've listed above encompass all the relevant events that occur within the Invincible ""universe"", and if you read all of them then there shouldn't be any characters/events/information you miss.  Finally let me just briefly mention two issues of Invincible which you may not know when to read. the first one is issue 0. Issue 0 takes place between issues 22 and 23. It is mostly a recap issue intended to help new readers get into the book, but it's also a short issue so it's at your discretion whether you want to read it.   The other issue is Invincible Returns. This issue occurs between issues 70 and 71. Again this is somewhat a recap issue to help new readers com in. Unlike issue 0 though, Invincible Returns is actually relevant to the story and by skipping it you'll be missing a few scenes, even if they aren't super important. This issue is more like issue 70.5 than anything else, and is definitely an issue you should read. One of the coolest things in this issue though is that they brought the original artist back in to re-create some of the more epic scenes that had happened in the book up to this point as two-page spreads. All of them are pretty incredible.   In the end, the great thing about Invincible is that while there are side series like all of the ones I brought up, you don't really need to read any of them. I highly suggest them all since they are all pretty great, but as long as you don't skip anything in the main title, you shouldn't ever be more than momentarily confused by anything they talk about."

I feel like she isn't the lead of the comic, the men are the lead, and we are the men, we are the lead of the comic.   Ofcourse, she doesn't impose her will on us, but I feel that shes equally mysterious to us as she is to them. What the fuck is going to happen? What is the significance of Nick, is he truly different than the other men? I have this feeling that this comic will only fall together in the last issue and I CANT FUCKING WAIT.

Absolutely the truth. I'm glad for this community and I absolutely love Image comics (along with Marvel and DC) but above all else I love comics.    Everybody moans about variants, but here’s the honest to goodness truth: You stop ordering variants; we’ll stop making them.   Please. Please. Please.   If there are people in your community who aren’t comfortable going into comic book stores, ask them why. Ask what you could be doing that you’re not.   This is something I often hear and it's a hard things to address. Most of the time it's the attitudes of the people that run the LCS. Geeks can be an amazing group of people, one I am proud to count myself a part of, but they can also be socially awkward. Building a better local comic community it definitely something we should all be working toward."

ImageComics,1yzgd6,JuxtaPositioNed,3,Wed Feb 26 14:29:54 2014 UTC,"From all accounts he has written new Fell (I think 7-9 issues worth), but Ben Templesmith is so busy he barely has time to draw them.  And since the original run was so sporadically released, they wanted to make sure they had the whole set before releasing another one.  Last I read he had drawn I think two issues.  It saddens my heart.  I actually came here to say something about Fell, but ya beat me to it, haha."

ImageComics,1yqvma,ShinCoal,7,Mon Feb 24 00:03:44 2014 UTC,"Saga, oh Saga. I'm going to admit something, I'm past my mid twenties now, and reading/collecting comics was always something I wanted to do but for some reason never did. Enter Saga, somewhere in 2012. The moment I decided to start buying my shit. Saga trade here, then more Image trades into more Marvel trades (and some Batman). But Saga is the fucking catalyst. Thanks you!  I said it before about East of West and the first artist of Ten Grand: can you say story/artist synergy? I don't know man, its probably because I don't know better, but I can't imagine having any other artist than Fiona Staples working on Saga. The art just fits so immensely.   The story is fun, its nothing special in essence, but the characters are quirky and modern enough to keep me reading. I mean in the sense of character, because their appearances are outright fantastic and I just love looking at them.  Can't wait to see what the new arc is going to be like when it starts in May.  ===   Undertow last week. I don't know. I didn't finish it, I was so terribly confused halfway through, something that rarely happens to me. Will probably give it another try and if it doesn't click right there I will just stop reading it altogether."
ImageComics,1yqvma,SouthernJeb,6,Mon Feb 24 00:39:09 2014 UTC,"Exactly the same thing happened with me, except I collected when I was younger.  Saga brought me back into collecting comics.  Wonderful book."
ImageComics,1yqvma,SinkVenice,4,Mon Feb 24 00:47:58 2014 UTC,"I said it before about East of West and the first artist of Ten Grand: can you say story/artist synergy?   I entirely agree, those two (well Ten Grand was) and Saga are the epitome of why comics are such a great art form.   Someone (I don’t know who) once said comics are the great collaborative art and I think those titles demonstrate why.  I originally downloaded the free issue one for Saga from Comixology and tbh I was kind of underwhelmed (why has that guy got a tv for a head!), being more of a Sci-fi than fantasy fan I wasn’t sure I could get behind the idea of winged fairies and spell casting goat-headed dudes. Then at the insistence of pretty much everyone I bought the first trade and was immediately hooked.  I am waiting for the third collection now, I hope there will be many more to come after that.   Also Lying Cat is one the greatest characters ever created, it’s such an excellent story mechanic."
ImageComics,1yqvma,ThatGingeOne,3,Mon Feb 24 09:49:32 2014 UTC,"Same thing for me! I had always wanted to get into collecting comics and I did pick up a few when I visited America but Saga is what really got me into them, what got me to find a good comic book store where I live, to start reading regularly, and now I am reading heaps more comics (Image especially so far) and really loving it"
ImageComics,1yqvma,mmclennan,5,Tue Feb 25 06:16:04 2014 UTC,"Coming into Saga I was already a pretty big BKV fan. I loved Y. It's just such a strong series and it, incredibly, kept up that very steady pace throughout the entire run. It really made me appreciate what you could do with a comic series. I am also a big image fan because they've really been bringing out a lot of new and interesting titles. And finally, I'm a huge sci-fi nerd; So, for me, picking up Saga #1 was a no-brainer, but I could still never guess at just how much I would fall in love with this book. After issue 3 I was already recommending it heavily to anyone who reads comics. I bought 4 or 5 copies of volume 1 the first xmas it was out to hand out as gifts. I really wanted people to read this damn book. Now it's everyone new favorite comic and it's fucking fantasic! My list of people to talk to about Saga (IRL) went from less than a handful to dozens. There are literally dozens of us!!!"

A quick google search taught be that he is an alternative comic artist.    Is there any particular relationship between Vaughan or Staples and Pope, or any reason why he was chosen in particular to do the variant?  His style seems cool in its own right, but not necessarily complimentary to Fiona Staple's.    Just curious.  Nice find!  EDIT:  Welp, that there is a strange down vote.  Anyway..."

I've been reading thief of thieves since the beginning, and i'd say that it's one of my monthly pulls that I am most willing to drop.

ImageComics,1y1c2c,dozer504,1 point,Thu Feb 20 01:31:27 2014 UTC,"Thief of Thieves is kind of dull. The stakes never really feel high and the main character feels like a mix between George Clooney in Oceans 11 and the guy from Mad Men. I also think the series was created solely for the purpose to gain a fan-base so Kirkman could launch a TV series on AMC, which before it was even 3 issues deep it got optioned. Once it does become a show it'll probably be popular. I stopped reading back when the protagonist gets into Italy or whatever."

ImageComics,1xsq1a,HGFantomas,1 point,Thu Feb 13 15:40:19 2014 UTC,"Yea, I'm having the same problem. Image is brutalizing my wallet."
ImageComics,1xrato,zeus37,10,Thu Feb 13 00:38:33 2014 UTC,Prophet is fantastic. The current series starts at issue #21.
ImageComics,1xrato,zigstarr42,5,Thu Feb 13 02:14:51 2014 UTC,"As for newer comics go I'd suggest Umbral, Manifest Destiny, Bedlam, Sidekick, and Todd the Ugliest Kid."
ImageComics,1xrato,Noodles1312,4,Thu Feb 13 00:54:31 2014 UTC,Todd is awesome and a refreshing change of pace from normal Image comics.  The best news i got last year was when they announced Todd was going to full series.
ImageComics,1xrato,the_one_true_b,3,Thu Feb 13 03:20:45 2014 UTC,Todd is very original and full of shtick.   It almost reminds me of how the deadpool comics are written.
ImageComics,1xrato,Noodles1312,4,Thu Feb 13 08:38:10 2014 UTC,"I haven't tried yet, but do you mean Deadpool like Kelly wrote it or that horribly depthless thing that they call Deadpool these days? Because if its the former then I'm going to check that out."
ImageComics,1xrato,ShinCoal,6,Thu Feb 13 12:47:27 2014 UTC,"I gave up the current run of Deadpool.  The character is so shallow and seems like they've turned the  sarcasm into 1-liners.    Todd is just all around funny with the interaction of all characters and the seemingly off the wall connection of the stories.  Also, if you want something that's reminiscent of Deadpool in his prime check out a Dark Horse one shot called Buddy Cops."
ImageComics,1xrato,the_one_true_b,3,Thu Feb 13 13:23:56 2014 UTC,"You got me interested, will be checking both out. Thanks!"
ImageComics,1xrato,ShinCoal,3,Thu Feb 13 15:22:57 2014 UTC,...how the Deadpool comics were written   Posehn should read Todd and learn how to write characters.
ImageComics,1xrato,the_one_true_b,3,Thu Feb 13 13:25:20 2014 UTC,I agree.  I should have said the older deadpool comics that made him popular among comic book fans.
ImageComics,1xrato,Noodles1312,6,Thu Feb 13 17:10:42 2014 UTC,"Saga, invincible, walking dead ,velvet, black Science"
ImageComics,1xrato,seidelryan,6,Thu Feb 13 01:19:19 2014 UTC,"Nowhere Men is on some odd hiatus but was getting pretty damn good.  Think Tank has it's moments, but is a very intelligent book and informative. Also, one of the lesser known titles i think it kinda good is Secret.  Written by Hickman in a unique noir tone makes it rather enjoyable, written by Hickman.  Being under the radar makes it rather easy to 1st prints."
ImageComics,1xrato,the_one_true_b,4,Thu Feb 13 03:28:24 2014 UTC,"Manhattan Projects, Chew, Revival, Morning Glories, Manifest Destiny, Ghosted"
ImageComics,1xrato,HGFantomas,2,Thu Feb 13 03:21:39 2014 UTC,"I love Manhattan Projects and Chew, highly recommended. Morning Glories has gotten too ridiculous for me, but it has a really interesting premise."
ImageComics,1xrato,holemole,1 point,Thu Feb 13 17:48:33 2014 UTC,"I have only read the first three trades of MG. So maybe I have avoided the silliness? I kinda worry that is starts off good and mysterious like ""Lost"" and ends silly and bad like ""Lost""."
ImageComics,1xrato,HGFantomas,1 point,Fri Feb 14 01:16:34 2014 UTC,"I felt like they kept adding more and more twists, and never any closure on previous twists. I couldn't keep up with it all.  They actually started printing the Morning Glories Study Hall in the back of each issue, likely because people had a hard time following what was going on. If it gets to the point where you have to provide the reader with a ""what you just read"" column, you're probably making it unnecessarily complicated."
ImageComics,1xrato,holemole,5,Mon Feb 17 16:04:06 2014 UTC,"On top of those titles, I enjoy Great Pacific, Sex, and Adventure Time, and others. I've been working on collecting the trades for the entire Dark Horse run of Robert E. Howard's Conan."

ImageComics,1xrato,HGFantomas,4,Fri Feb 14 01:17:27 2014 UTC,Black science is a must for a new series. #3 just got released and you can probably still pick up 2nd prints of 1 & 2. But other than that I would say The Manhattan Projects and Prophet are awesome too. Try and get volumes to catch up if you can.
ImageComics,1xrato,scrabbledon,3,Thu Feb 13 09:40:25 2014 UTC,"Image: Manhattan Projects, Manifest Destiny, Five Weapons, Umbral, Black Science, Ten Grand, Velvet, Fatale.  Marvel: Remender's 'Uncanny X-force' and its sorta sequel 'Uncanny Avengers'. Aaron's Thor: God of Thunder."
ImageComics,1xrato,ShinCoal,2,Thu Feb 13 10:34:23 2014 UTC,"Manifest Destiny is fantastic, quality quality book.   Check out Pretty Deadly, creepy western fantasy story, about Death's daughter.   I really like Valiant's Archer & Armstrong too. Funny, exciting. Great writing."
ImageComics,1xrato,copperandchrome,2,Sat Feb 15 15:14:19 2014 UTC,"If you like role-playing games, or fantasy in general, I sincerely recommend Rat Queens. It's an insanely fun comic, and the art is beautiful."

ImageComics,1xq09k,clayduck,3,Wed Feb 12 17:25:11 2014 UTC,It's definitely a very good pulp action book. I was not disappointed in the slightest.
ImageComics,1xq09k,mmclennan,3,Wed Feb 12 17:32:14 2014 UTC,"Yes! I was a lit major in college, so I love all of the literary allusions and the pulp adventure feel of it.  I am really enjoying the current ""Lost Coastlines"" arc"
ImageComics,1xpe0g,mmclennan,3,Wed Feb 12 13:09:11 2014 UTC,"I was actually hoping this would be better, but it just kinda threw you into a situation with little explanation or context.  Also not a big fan of the art."

ImageComics,1xlxka,mmclennan,3,Tue Feb 11 12:50:58 2014 UTC,"Absolutely love this comic.  If you love comedy and fantasy or love the webcomic LFG, this is the comic for you.  One of the few books I genuinely really look forward to every month."

ImageComics,1xi8te,ShinCoal,7,Mon Feb 10 08:40:26 2014 UTC,"I noted this over in /r/comicbooks, but I really think Kirkman's making moves to split Mark and Eve up. There's just so many little hints. They're fighting a lot. That viltrumite woman has shown she has feelings for Mark, which is now always going to be in the back of his head.  Plus, with Mark trapped in this other dimension, Eve's been proven completely right, with the problem being Mark probably doesn't see it that way.    Oh, and an ex-superhero being charged with raising a surprise baby while her superhero husband continues to go on daily adventures is really not going to help.  Sounds like a breeding ground for resentment really."
ImageComics,1xi8te,MySonsdram,3,Mon Feb 10 18:58:48 2014 UTC,"Lately this book has been leaving me with the thought ""ok that was good I guess I'll keep reading it"" but after what happened with Robot at the end of 108 I stood there mouth gaping analyzing the cover for 109. Also with the promise of a more Walking Dead type character life expectancy I think this is going to have quite a bit of interesting developments."
ImageComics,1xi8te,aamendola3,3,Mon Feb 10 21:27:25 2014 UTC,"Man, I can't believe it has been over 10 years and over 100 issues. I think I came in around volume 2 and, at this point, I can't see me stopping until Kirkman ends the run. What did everyone think of the big issue #100 event? Think we'll ever see Invincible on the big screen?"
ImageComics,1xi8te,mmclennan,2,Mon Feb 10 13:34:27 2014 UTC,"I honestly don't see Invincible working on big screen.   Sure, the whole 'my superman dad is an asshole' thing could work as a feature, but imo it would miss the point of Invincible.   I honestly think that a lot of characters in Invincible are totally replaceable, even Mark, especially Mark. Its the smaller things that make the story special to me, instead of taking an all different take on the superhero thing (like Kick-Ass or Wanted did for instance) in a shorter story, Invincible is like that but more subtle. Its a long stretching story where a lot of character plots go towards point B where we have seen them go to point A all too often, it explores problems others haven't yet.  I think Invincible is one of the closest things to a 'realistic' view of how people would react to being ACTUAL superheroes.  Invincible the soap opera would totally work though. And I'm not even joking.  Funny sidenote: Invincible is also the name of an American Football movie starring Mark Wahlberg."
ImageComics,1xi8te,DGer,3,Tue Feb 11 17:13:02 2014 UTC,I guess this is a spoilers thread.  I really have struggled with enjoying this title since the Viltrumite War. It seemed like such a natural end point to the series (even though the ending would have been really unsatisfying). I keep reading I guess mainly out of habit. I have always read the series in trades and I used to rush to the store to get a new trade. Now the trades seem to sit on my stack and not get read for a while.

ImageComics,1wwgi0,ShinCoal,9,Mon Feb 3 16:23:06 2014 UTC,"Jonathan Hickman is killing it on Image. Two out of three of my favorite ongoing series on Image are written by him.   Firstly East of West manages to intrigue me every issue,  he seems to be going for a big plan, exactly like he is doing with the Avengers on Marvel. Unlike that material though he isn't working with established work, so while EoW is way smaller in scale, the pacing is so much slower due to the endless introductions. Which I love, I think its great reading about the world he is creating, I really like the characters, but the story crawls ever so slowly.  Still really good, probably my favorite Image comic right now.  Manhattan Projects is the other one. While I wouldn't dare imply that its without a plan, it feels a lot faster and spontaneous, and is really.. uh.. 'light hearted' (?) with the pretty fucked up material its using. It manages to crack me up every time I read it.  Also a big fan of his Avengers/New Avengers/Avengers World run on Marvel right now, seems to be building up to something really big!  Special mention for Rick Remender:  He created what is probably my favorite comic book series ever, Uncanny X-Force (I think the current series with the same name sucks though), and while he isn't such an obvious planner as Hickman, he can suddenly grab back something from the past and you get the feeling that this was meant to happen all along. Its 'followup' Uncanny Avengers is going towards a big climax and I'm loving every moment. Also having fun with Captain America.  On Image he just started with Deadly Class, and for once I'm not entirely convinced yet. But I have good hopes he will turn me into a fan once again, not going to shoot it down after a single issue.  Black Science, Black Fucking Science, well this is a rare pearl. I can say so much good about this (also fairly new) series, but I just want to say one thing about, because it does this aspect so well: Pacing. The pacing on this comic feels so fucking spot on. Such a delicious read, can't wait for more."
ImageComics,1wwgi0,SHsquared,4,Mon Feb 3 21:31:17 2014 UTC,"I think deadly class has potential, and I like the art style... I'm intrigued enough it's on my pull lost to a we where it goes. Black science is great so far!   And I'm with you in regards to Hickman. Dude is crushing it. Especially East of West - that's my favorite thing in the world right now"
ImageComics,1wwgi0,seidelryan,3,Tue Feb 4 00:53:51 2014 UTC,"Black science is probably my favorite comic right now. The art is great, imaginative story and great pacing like you said.nothing but good things :)"
ImageComics,1wwgi0,holemole,2,Tue Feb 4 04:32:18 2014 UTC,"Hickman is one of my favorite writers in general!  I want to read Black Science so badly, but I've been waiting for the trade. I read issue 1 and loved it, but don't have the funds to follow it monthly at the moment!"
ImageComics,1wwgi0,zigstarr42,5,Tue Feb 4 15:25:08 2014 UTC,"I absolutely love Brandon Graham. His art is gorgeous, and his world building is fantastic. I love stupid humor, so all of his puns are right up my alley. I think he's a fantastic storyteller, and I love how he's always trying to make full use of the medium."
ImageComics,1wwgi0,mmclennan,4,Tue Feb 4 03:46:09 2014 UTC,"For Image writers Robert Kirkman is still the top of the list for me. Invincible is an amazing series and it's the only superhero where I can claim (truthfully) that I've read the entire run of. The Walking Dead has remained surprisingly strong over the years, though I still miss Tony Moore. His other series might not have held my attention as much, but they are always guaranteed to be fun and entertaining."
ImageComics,1wwgi0,Tackysackjones,2,Wed Feb 5 14:20:28 2014 UTC,Kirkman has my love for Invincible. I even love that he made himself a character in Invincible. It's been a fantastic series and one that I re-read frequently.
ImageComics,1wwgi0,thebubbazanetti,5,Thu Feb 6 20:27:47 2014 UTC,For me currently it's rick remender. Black science is an amazing action sci fi with a pretty flawed scientist leading the way. Deadly class is only one issue in but I'm hooked. Also can't remember the name of it but one of the previews from imagecon in SF was of his book and the art looked breath taking so super excited for that.
ImageComics,1wwgi0,Tackysackjones,3,Thu Feb 6 06:58:41 2014 UTC,"You're talking about 'Low', I'm really stoked for that one too. The art is great."

ImageComics,1wwgi0,SHsquared,3,Thu Feb 6 20:29:54 2014 UTC,"Kelly Sue Deconnick is a recent favorite of mine, her words read like prose at times, and her deliveries hold so much weight.

ImageComics,1wd8km,mmclennan,6,Tue Jan 28 13:04:27 2014 UTC,"This review was annoying to read, the way it was written was irritating and tiresome, most of it is just long sentences followed by a fullstop.  Also, I realize I can't always have the same opinions as a reviewer, but I find it weird to criticise something and compare it to manga just because it has some characters that are over the top, especially when the whole premise is a bit over the top anyway. The manga comparison is what annoyed me the most, lets just ignore the blatant stylistic and cultural differences and compare it when a set of arbitrary rules have been breached, right."
ImageComics,1wd8km,ShinCoal,2,Tue Jan 28 13:51:44 2014 UTC,The run-on sentences are super annoying. A little editing could help.
