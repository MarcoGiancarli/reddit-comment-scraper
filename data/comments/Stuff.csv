The constitution doesn't say anything about the people having an automatic human right to browse Google. It says freedom of speech is all. It doesn't say that you have to be automatically provided with every single tool that everyone else has to express yourself. You can still stand on the sidewalk and shout your opinion on a soap box if you don't have the money for a $1,200 computer and a $50/month broadband connection."

Your vote doesn't count unless you can afford influence.
