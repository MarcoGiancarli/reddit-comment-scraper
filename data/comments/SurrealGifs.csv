SurrealGifs,2gl2yf,double2,2,Fri Oct 3 22:52:48 2014 UTC,It's either that or a form of synesthesia. But probably you're going mad.
SurrealGifs,2gl2yf,autowikibot,2,Sat Oct 4 15:04:13 2014 UTC,"Synesthesia:       Synesthesia (also spelled synæsthesia or synaesthesia; from the Ancient Greek σύν syn, ""together"", and αἴσθησις aisthēsis, ""sensation"") is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.     People who report such experiences are known as synesthetes.  Difficulties have been recognized in adequately defining synesthesia:   many different phenomena have been included in the term synesthesia (""union of the senses""), and in many cases the terminology seems to be inaccurate. A more accurate term may be ideasthesia.  In one common form of synesthesia, known as grapheme → color synesthesia or color-graphemic synesthesia, letters or numbers are perceived as inherently colored.   In spatial-sequence, or number form synesthesia, numbers, months of the year, and/or days of the week elicit precise locations in space (for example, 1980 may be ""farther away"" than 1990), or may appear as a three-dimensional map (clockwise or counterclockwise).

Somebody commented that this subreddit is supposed to be about the adjective surreal over actual surrealism. Is that true?    Someone's gotta get a reign on this shit or else it will be taken over by glitch gifs. Your own post is in no class of any form of surrealism, it's just a stylized animated polygon mesh shaped like a heart. Boo on your post."

SurrealGifs,208452,veggiter,2,Wed Mar 12 12:47:56 2014 UTC,What exactly is surreal about it?
SurrealGifs,208452,JesterOfDestiny,2,Wed Mar 12 17:59:40 2014 UTC,"A phantasmagoria of rapidly swirling clouds in vibrant colors churns in the sky and is mirrored in a lake. The duplicated image confuses the viewer's sense of space, the speed and repetition the viewer's sense of time. The end result is a beautiful, other-worldly, dreamlike gif.  What isn't surreal about it?"
SurrealGifs,208452,JesterOfDestiny,2,Wed Mar 12 19:25:44 2014 UTC,"Isn't surreal supposed to be something that goes against what is considered normal, or real/realistic? Sort of a synonym to weird, but in a different way.  Dreamlike could be word to describe it, but this dream is one of those, that doesn't seem to make sense, yet it does. Maybe throw in some heavy symbolism, like a lot of dreams, or surreal works have.  Swirling clouds isn't exactly something that goes against the norms and rules of reality.  I don't know, I'm not good with words. Just google image search the word ""surreal"" or ""surreal art"" and see what I mean."
SurrealGifs,208452,JesterOfDestiny,2,Wed Mar 12 19:44:18 2014 UTC,"Symbolism is present in a lot of Surreal art, but it's not a requirement.  From Wikipedia:   Artists painted unnerving, illogical scenes with photographic precision, created strange creatures from everyday objects and developed painting techniques that allowed the unconscious to express itself and/or an idea/concept.   The scene depicted is definitely unnerving and illogical.  The clouds are moving unnaturally rapidly in a repetitive pattern. Also, no other part of the scene is moving but the clouds, which are reflected in the lake below - sure a reflection is natural, but that doesn't make it any less strange to the eye.  That being said, the adjective ""surreal"" has a less strict definition than the style of art. It generally means dream-like or hallucinatory or disorienting.  It didn't necessarily mean ""doesn't occur in nature""."
