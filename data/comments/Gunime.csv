If you're browsing from anyhere but Japan you'd need a VPN or something to access the page on dmm.com. Link to the page.    I typed the guns' common names (as I know them) on the image titles. In the descriptions I transliterated what the guns are called on the cards to English so you people can have a few keks.    I don't get payed enough to translate their names too.      Shooting Girl is an upcoming online game that's been compared to Kancolle a lot. Your guns/girls/whatever they ares are represented by cards and they go pew pew apparently. I took one look at the guns and the girls and the pew pews and I new I had to play.    Right now they're allowing you to earn a single card before the game is released in what they call their Pre-Registration Scouting campaign. If you have any interest in this game I'd reccomend you try and pick up a cool card. I got me a FAMAS. :^)    If you need any help doing this, I can try to help ya. I also made a crappy guide.      Also any help on listing the cards' artists would be appreciated.    Edit: Am I bad with post titles? I think I'm bad with post titles."
