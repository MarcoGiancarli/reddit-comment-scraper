We got six fusions in season one: Opal in ""Giant Woman"", Sugilite in ""Coach Steven"", Alexandrite in ""Fusion Cuisine"", Stevonnie in ""Alone Together"", and Garnet's reveal and Malachite in ""Jailbreak"".  So far we have two in season two: Rainbow Quartz in ""We Need to Talk"", and Sardonyx in ""Cry for Help"".  They're even in spaced out in  the season similarly (Opan and Rainbow Quartz are both in episode twelve, and Sugilite was in twenty while Sardonyx is in fourteen).  Also of note, four of the six season one fusions are on this chart, and two of them feature other characters.  Now, this is Sugar we're talking about, so she'll either maintain this pattern more-or-less, or throw a wrench into the work and change everything completely.  In the prior case, I don't think it's a stretch to expect one more CG fusion (maybe a flashback to the everyone-but-Amethyst fusion or the Garnet and Rose fusion?) then a Steven fusion that drastically changes our understanding of things (like Steven and another gem) and then a season finale with an important CG fusion (it's too early for Steven's version of the temple fusion, but I can dream) and a Homeworld fusion (likely Yellow Diamond, likely with Peridot)"

EDIT: Let me explain...  The second equation is what /u/ASBusinessMagnet wrote. But even though it's a very handy equation, it's not very intuitive. There's a much more verbose way to tackle the problem, if you know about a function called ""choose.""  In combinatorics, the ""choose"" function asks the question: ""given x things, how many different ways are there to choose n of them?""  Example: ""Given 3 differently colored marbles, Red, Green, and Blue, how many different ways are there to choose 2 of them?"" (the answer is 3).  So if you want to know how many different ways there are to fuse x gems, (and if you don't weight the probability of certain fusions and if order doesn't matter), then you can do it ""the long way"" by asking ""given six gems, how many different ways are there to fuse two of them; given six gems, how many different ways are there to fuse three of them; given six gems..."" and so on, until you end up choosing the same number of gems as the number you're asking about.  That's what the first equation is: the summation of all the choose functions for x (in this case) gems, for all the fusion combinations of two, three, four, five, and six gems.  Put both equations into a graphing calculator, and BAM, you'll see that the two functions are positively identical. They equal each other.  This is mathematically nifty because it relates a summation of choose functions to 2x, which you wouldn't guess would happen. There's a cleverer way to derive /u/ASBusinessMagnet's function that has nothing to do with the choose function at all (hover over the link to find out what, credit to /u/ASBusinessMagnet), but the symmetry between the two is still there, hidden in the math. Pearl would find it oddly satisfying."
stevenuniverse,3e26w9,SpaceHeeder,9,Tue Jul 21 14:59:56 2015 UTC,I firmly believe that a fusion of Ruby and Pearl makes Sard and Sapphire and Pearl makes Onyx if only because Sardonyx is made of those two in the real world.

Sardonyx, Sugilite, and Alexandrite are certainly fusions which include Garnet, but I'm not convinced those fusions are really a product of Ruby or Sapphire.   It's entirely possible that a fusion of Sapphire, Ruby, and Amethyst is something entirely different than Sugilite, as Garnet seems very much to be her own person.   Just my two cents. : )"
stevenuniverse,3e26w9,jakeb89,6,Tue Jul 21 14:18:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like since we do see the individual gems during fusion and unfusion, that it does count as a fusion between Ruby, Sapphire and X, rather than Garnet and X, but at this point all we really do have is opinions and conjecture."
stevenuniverse,3e26w9,notpandora,6,Tue Jul 21 14:47:24 2015 UTC,"It's just math to me. A Ruby+ A Sapphire+ An Amethyst = Sugilite. Just like how 1+2=3. Regardless if you do it like this: 1+1+1=3.   The gems are like sentient computer programs in a sense (their gem is their core, they 'glitch' out when damaged, they project holograms to make them more relateable) so a programming/computer-logic approach seems the most logical way to handle it to me."
stevenuniverse,3e26w9,Bombkirby,9,Tue Jul 21 15:10:38 2015 UTC,But Garnet often repeats that a fusion is more than the sum of its parts.
stevenuniverse,3e26w9,arthurstone,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:08 2015 UTC,"But Ruby and Sapphire are still parts in the fusion. Just because they're Garnet at the time of an additional fusion doesn't make them not exist in the additional fusion.   Garnet is ""2"". 1+2=3. Ruby and sapphire are 1. 1+1+1 still = 3. It's not a different three just because they're separated at the time of the fusion.   A fusion with Ruby OR Sapphire, and Pearl won't result in Sardonyx because the other factor in the fusion isn't there."
stevenuniverse,3e26w9,Mythiiical,4,Tue Jul 21 16:15:04 2015 UTC,"We don't know that's how it works. It's still possible that order matters, which would make the Ruby + Sapphire + Pearl fusion different from the Garnet + Pearl fusion."
stevenuniverse,3e26w9,BlackHumor,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:14 2015 UTC,But we saw in Alexandrite's de-fusing that Ruby and Sapphire were briefly separated.  It was the prime piece of evidence of Garnet's fusion status for a long time.  The fact they briefly defused and refused as Garnet while falling establishes that the Alexandrite fusion fell apart into it's 4 separate pieces.  2 of them just happened to be in sync enough to reform together.
stevenuniverse,3e26w9,LSunday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:55 2015 UTC,"To comment on that, I believe we can get an answer on the fact that it's been stated before that a fusion ""is a manifestation of two gems relationship.""    So then the questions is, is Pearl/Amethyst relationship to Garnet, different from their relationship to Ruby AND Sapphire separated? One can only assume it is, as Garnet is a single entity. She is their leader, and a representation of a strong relationship they can look up to. Ruby and Sapphire separated however, are two lovers who, as we've seen in ""Motel Keystone"", have a good relationship but can have differences and are individuals (something that wouldn't happen when forming Garnet). In addition they are so much shorter in stature to Pearl and Amethyst, so just their physical presence in the fusion dance would be altered (if that matters)  So I don't believe that it is as simple as 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, more A + B = C and  C + D = E but A + B + D =/= E but possibly F.    I mean logistically there would be no reason for Pearl or Amethyst to fuse with Ruby AND Sapphire, before they form Garnet, but it's an interesting thought experiment.   Also interesting how this would apply to Alexandrite. If 3 person fusion dances are possible, and that's indeed how they formed Alexandrite ( Attack The Light has the 3 of them separated to fuse, but we don't know how cannon that is.) , then would a Garnet/Opal Fusion result differently? We might have a clue at the 1 frame easter egg that was included in ""Fusion Cuisine"" hinting at Ruby and Sapphire before it was revield. The way it's animated kind of implies that normally fusionw defuse to their base gems, but Garnet stayed together, because, you know she's Garnet ( and that's what happens with Sugolite and Sardonyx as well), but it could clue us in that my entire above explanation is wrong and it is as simple as 1 + 1 + 1 = 3"

stevenuniverse,3e26w9,PorkchopsandHotdogs,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:19 2015 UTC,I think it's more like Sapphire+Pearl =/= Ruby + Pearl but Garnet(Sapphire + Ruby) + Pearl = Sardonyx. Therefor Ruby + Sapphire + N = Garnet + N.
stevenuniverse,3e26w9,xXTheGrapenatorXx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I didn't do the stupid =/= sign. What I'm really trying to say is sapphire and pearl would have a different outcome than ruby and pearl.

stevenuniverse,3e0pqn,nameless88,4,Tue Jul 21 09:04:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean if she was a regular crystal gem all of the fights would basicly boil down to her glaring at an enemy while holding a slush and crushing it with out even blinking."
stevenuniverse,3e0pqn,infernal666,3,Tue Jul 21 12:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Green Ranger is a good way to put it. Honestly, when/if she comes back to the CGs, I highly doubt she'll just instantly forgive them for the whole mirror thing. If it weren't for Steven, she would not give a single shit about them. I've always thought that Lapis' only reason for fighting alongside the CGs would be to help them maybe ""take back"" homeworld, so that she could finally go home. But that sounds like later series shit.  Seeing as she really has no other options, I can see her living in some underwater fortress, Elsa-style, somewhere outside of Beach City. Steven swings by every once in a while and they goof off. Whenever it majorly hits the fan, she just pops up, wrecks some people, and then goes back. I've read a theory that, if the whole Pink Diamond as Rose thing is true and Steven is some gem prince, then Lapis would make a really good champion. Like, ""Nah, I don't use my OP water powers unless someone is messing with Steven."""

Pearl is the fussy soccer mom archetype, Amethyst is the young sister or teen-mom archetype, and Garnet is the matronly protector. My bet is that Pearl is either gonna die trying to save Steven or turn to Yellow Diamond's side and the same episode Lapis will join the Crystal Gems partly out of a desire to help Steven. As she's put in a position where she has to be more of an authority figure we'll see their relationship strain as Lapis struggles to fill her new role and Steven feels betrayed, lonely, sad and angry at Pearl and Lapis.

At this point, it would be fair to say that she's attacted to Garnet and above all, steven. Something would have to seriously fuck her shit up to destroy, what is essencially, her entire persona like that. I'd also wager that she wouldn't die. If anything, her gem would become corupt, and it turns into a battle to save pearl now. They're forced to re-activate the homeworld warp by whatever means they can to gain access to current age gem tech and abilities to scout for something to help fix Pearl. I can only imagine that is what Steven would want to do. Help pearl in whatever way he can, even if it means risking everything. After all, even when pearl was simply poofed, steven waited day and night for ?Two weeks? before she came back. That's some dedication right there.  As for where Lapis fits into all this... It's really up in the air. I have no idea what her motivations are at this point, or what her true personality is like. Water-Step-Mom would be cool I guess though."

It kinda makes sense she's rarely about since she only comes to see Steven when 1) she has the time and 2) when her overbearing parents let her. It's a shame but it's in keeping with her backstory that she's not about as much as say, Lars and Sadie who work just round the corner from the temple.

To add fuel to the fire, Suitcase Sam has a cohesive brown color palette, which seems pretty consistent with how the Gems look, especially the Homeworld Gems. If she's really a gem, she'd be something brown colored... Suitcase Sandstone, perhaps? Maybe there's a reason Suitcase Sam has an androgynous name?

stevenuniverse,3e1u8n,BlueRoanoke,14,Tue Jul 21 08:41:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know... to me, it kind of looks like some of the script can be derived from old Viking-era Anglo-Saxon runes, sometimes known as 'fuÞark' or 'futhark', while other parts can be loosely taken from a Cyrillic script. I'm looking at the third pillar, and it looks almost like it has stylized versions of the runes over what appears to be a representation of someone bearing an odd resemblance to Yellow Diamond. Hear me out?  • The first symbol looks similar to the Old English Futhark rune, yr; transliterated, it'd make a 'y' sound. • The second is simply a reversed 'E', or a version of the rune eh / ehwaz turned on its side... either way, that's 'e'. • The next rune isn't one, but two—it appears like an inverted lagu rune twice over... which would make two 'l' sounds. • Next comes a tiny stretch, but I see a closed-off eðel / ethel rune, which transliterates to 'œ', an 'uh' or 'oh' sound. • Finally, the 'N'-shaped rune could be similar to the hægl rune, which is either an 'h' sound or a soft stop.  Y... e... l-l... œ... h. Yellow.  • Next, we see what looks like a 'w' or 'E' turned onto its side... or perhaps, a stylized version of dæg for 'd'. • Again, we see a similar symbol as in the first word, yr. That's another 'y'. • After that, what looks like another ethel rune, which means another 'uh / oh'. • Next comes another stretch—this next letter could be similar to mannaz with its halves switched around to create that distinct 'ф' shape. If you've caught onto the pattern, mannaz transliterates to 'm'. • Again, what appears to be another hægl rune, another soft stop.  D... y... œ... m... h... or d-i-a-m, the first four letters of ""Diamond"".  Now who's the one potentially looking too far into potentially meaningless things?!"

stevenuniverse,3e1u8n,Militron,3,Tue Jul 21 12:52:21 2015 UTC,That's really interesting!  Do you have a picture of the set of runes you're looking at that you could link?
stevenuniverse,3e1u8n,nixlheimr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:31 2015 UTC,"You made me realize something.   You're right, it makes a whole lot of sense to start with the one who looks like Yellow Diamond, and then with your analysis based on the futhark runes and Cyrillic script... That got me thinking...   What if this is an invented code based on a lot of different writing systems to make our brains explode? I did a quick check on a lead for one of the characters on the pillar, and apparently the second to the last character (the one you identified as a ""mannaz"") is a combination of the ㅁ and the ㅗ of Hangul, which reads as the M and O sound respectively. Now I don't know anything about Hangul rules... but what if this is a sound-based code instead of a letter-based code?  口 could be an i/y sound  the reverse E could be a short e sound  the upside down double L is the L sound  日 could be the ""schwa"" sound  ...and so on.   Based on that, I tried if it would work on the writing on other pillars, but my data isn't enough to get anything coherent yet.   There are a lot of ""E"" looking characters though, so I'm wondering, what's the most common sound (not letter) in the English language?"

I gave a kind of misleading example with 中 (center), in that I talked about a country, which we usually see as flat.  Most of the time though, 中 refers to something being inside of something else, which is why I was thinking of the Earth beetle (who would most likely be inside of a mountain) as opposed to the Heaven beetle, who was on top of one.  But, given that I already made logical leaps big enough to clear the grand canyon while trying to interpret this, it could easily be both."

As Pearl said the Sky Coliseum was the place where the first battles for Earth took place, I'm gonna assume that they begun with discussions, audiences, and maybe duels.   Maybe the Coliseum was built for that only purpose, so the Diamonds ordered to wrote that phrase, to remember everyone why they were there, because Rose Quartz wanted to protect a handful of insignificant bugs (living beings). Eventually, Rose got pissed off and everything went straight to hell and there were wars."

stevenuniverse,3e1u8n,Wasabi-beans,2,Tue Jul 21 08:56:52 2015 UTC,"XD we're so far into the realm of stretch at this point, that anything's possible XD I had been thinking of the fourth Queen as Rose, since she seems to be at the bottom of the Diamond Authority, but if it was any of the other ones, comparing humans to worms would actually make a lot of sense XD    Those are both cool languages!  There was a point when I actually would have chosen Tagalog over Chinese if given the chance, though I ended up getting addicted to hard languages, so I'm glad I didn't :)  Thanks XD it was fun to let my crazy side out for a bit!"
stevenuniverse,3e1u8n,Eilavamp,2,Tue Jul 21 09:18:07 2015 UTC,"Well, you definitely inspired me. I think I'll do a similar analysis on the other pillars, but with what I know of Japanese. But then, the kanji characters mean differently than their Chinese equivalents and the grammar is definitely different, so I might end up in a different place than what you've done here.  On a related note, I know Chinese is difficult to learn... but does Tagalog also have the image of being difficult to learn for non-native speakers? I grew up bilingual (Filipino + English) so I wouldn't know..."
stevenuniverse,3e1u8n,PrimaDonne,3,Tue Jul 21 09:26:12 2015 UTC,"Awesome, you should keep me posted on what you find out!  I'd also be happy to compare notes with you over the kanji :) I'd be really curious to see exactly how they contrast!    Honestly, I would say the difficulty of Chinese is subjective.  I'm currently trying to learn Russian, which I think is waaay harder, but I know other people who are the opposite.  I wouldn't say many people know what tagalog is to be honest.  I remember getting interested in it because my first foreign language was Spanish and, in the days before I started Chinese, I had this idea in my head that I wanted all my languages to be useable in the same region.  Since I had Spanish already, and I'm a native English speaker, and those are (as I understand it) two of the three major components of the language, I was curious to see how much I could understand.  It ended up not working out, I tried learning Quechua (language of the Inca, still spoken in parts of Peru) independently, got a reality check on what it's like to try and learn a non-school approved language, and swore that I would only learn languages that were available in classes for the remainder of my education.  And my college is tiny, our language options are spanish, french, german, russian, and chinese, so, yeah XD   But to answer your question, I think the people who know what tagalog is don't perceive it as being difficult to learn-at least for english speakers."
stevenuniverse,3e1u8n,RotomGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:41:26 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I understand. Well, you're right: Difficulty in learning a language is pretty much subjective to a lot of things. I think one of the factors has to do with how far off the target language is from your native (or other learned) language's family? Like, if you know Spanish it'd be easier for you to learn other Latin-based languages because of the similarities of the grammar, word etymology, etc. But then I guess a person's interest is a major factor as well (a lot of people tell me Japanese is difficult, but I find it so fascinating that I don't feel how difficult it is).  And best of luck with the Russian. I knew someone who studied Russian before, and I heard it's kinda complicated."
stevenuniverse,3e1u8n,nixlheimr,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"Hey cool, I was trying to decipher those pillars a while back myself. But I only speak Japanese, so, assuming they're meant to be read as Chinese, the different grammar and meanings for symbols + some symbols not being used at all or commonly in Japanese would've made it difficult - near impossible. (All I could get out of it when I was trying to read it for myself were 'royal', 'mountain', 'centre', and 'bug'. Kind of surprised I couldn't read 口; maybe it's because the pillar's in perspective a little? I dunno.)  But no, this is really good! Not only does it uncover a possibly great lore tease, but I just love reading about other languages and cultures. So I liked reading this."

stevenuniverse,3e089w,gutclusters,5,Tue Jul 21 17:25:28 2015 UTC,No. This fanbase is tiptoeing dangerously close to Brony-like territory. And we all know what happened to them.

stevenuniverse,3e089w,EggheadDash,3,Tue Jul 21 11:59:16 2015 UTC,Exactly...
stevenuniverse,3e089w,MagykBob,3,Tue Jul 21 12:09:42 2015 UTC,I'm still confused. I'm in both fandoms (though more SU than MLP nowadays) and as far as I know they haven't imploded or anything like that. I guess they just stopped being novel?
stevenuniverse,3e089w,EggheadDash,3,Tue Jul 21 12:15:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of they hit a threshold of enthusiasm where, until that point, their perceived involvement in the show went from a myth->weird->strange->novelty, but then at some point between the shipping and the fan art and, well, the furries (though admittedly a very small portion of the fanbase), some of the more moderate viewers of the show (like myself, I followed it until around season 3 or 4, I forget), didn't so much lose interest as chose not to want to be associated with those presumptions anymore.   It's one thing to have to convince people a girly kids show has material for adults built in. I did that and it wasn't fun, but I got the message across and even managed to get more than a couple of my friends to join the fandom with me. The problem comes when the stigma against it gets worse as a result of these very vocal outliers in the community. I'm talking about the people that do full on furry costumes to brony-cons, the ones that where excessive amount of merchandise, etc.  Like, IMO, I've only see brony-merch done right once: A dude had Celestias emblem on a button on his bag. No one from outside the fandom would recognize it, but other fans instantly did. The problem is with guys who wear nothing but MLP shirts and generally just obsess about the show 24/7. They've found a sense of community and dive head first into it. I know I did.   It was fun for a time, but the fandom sort of burned too hot too fast I think, and a lot of people who would have stuck with the show for the shows sake ended up disheartened from the whole experience and choosing to leave it behind."
stevenuniverse,3e089w,MagykBob,2,Tue Jul 21 12:25:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see what you mean. I still follow the show and look at fanart and such, but pretty much always avoid comments like the plague. I do wear MLP shirts but only once, maybe twice a week and it's usually either when I'm either just in my house or I'm with friends (many of whom are also bronies), maybe occasionally to the grocery store or something. Definitely not every day."
stevenuniverse,3e089w,EggheadDash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:34:09 2015 UTC,"I definetly get what you mean about the avoiding comment sections like the plague. I think what the guy up above was trying to caution against is that, right now, we are all just fans of a show. We like a show because it's cool and fun and good. When you start adding labels to the fans, you sort of make less-enthusiastic fans uncomfortable it seems. You also make it very easy for people to slip into the mentality of weirder things being okay since everyone else in the community is saying/doing it."
stevenuniverse,3e089w,MagykBob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:41:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think this show doesn't really need a label. I personally don't like how brony is a label, but it's well-established so I roll with it. I wasn't exactly there in the early days of it."

stevenuniverse,3e2nl6,AlasPoorBenedick,6,Tue Jul 21 14:28:05 2015 UTC,"We actually should worry about them.  Just because we won the marriage fight (and only for now, they're already trying to exploit loopholes and find ways to ignore it) doesn't mean that there are not a whole host of other LBGT issues that need to be addressed (employment discrimination, a whole host of issues for Trans people, etc...).

It's a fucking transwoman doc so it's not ike you didn't know what her show is about, she won't make your son become a girl, your son was always a girl but didn't know it was ok to be such.  Other countries edit the life out of some shows. I've heard Australia edited Lumpy Space Princess to not be so easily annoyed or show her yelling at her parents because they don't want kids to be mean to their parents.  I think that was smart of the Crewniverse in a sense for Ruby's design, make her just ""masculine"" enough to easily pass for a male voice actor if needed."

stevenuniverse,3e2nl6,megagikarp,4,Tue Jul 21 14:42:11 2015 UTC,"Parents have the right to choose whether or not their children are shown homosexuality in a positive light. This episode, however violates that right. It is for this reason and mostly for religious reasons(SDA Christian) that I'm boycotting this show.   Just like parents have the right to choose whether other races are shown in a positive light.   I believe that children should not be shown anything from heterosexuality and homosexuality because they are young and should not be shown anything sexual including kissing in shows.   There are a number of episodes depicting heterosexuality, such as 'Island Adventure' and 'Alone Together'. Furthermore, there are many opposite-sex married couples in the show. Should they be censored?   Even if sexual preference was inherent, it doesn't mean that children should be exposed to the concept in such a young age, leave children out of this delimma for now and when they grow up they'll discover their preferences on their own. Children should be allowed to live their innocence phase before they discover sex in general.   Refer to the above reply.   I'm signing this petition because although I love watching Steven Universe with my family I feel the subliminal messages it sends about LGBT are to much for children. I think the main problem comes with how they portray the relationship between the Gems when fusing and although I love the friendship messages I don't want my kids to be effected. I never noticed until The gems who make up Garnet, Ruby and Sapphire, were shown kissing and embracing in a more than friends way.   Do you think that seeing same-sex relationships will make your children gay? By that reasoning, gay people would be non-existent, given the exposure they get to opposite-sex relationships.   Showing kids examples of committed lesbian relationships will give children autism. This should be left to parents to explain to kids, ""Mommy and Daddy are movign the family because two women moved in next door honey, we don't feel comfortable with you seeing that so we are moving to somewhere it can't happen. Please start learning Arabic, children. And thank God you are not mildly autistic or this would be so much harder on me and daddy"".   I agree entirely with this statement.   Right. The Gay Agenda will destroy society as we know it. First they go after the children, corrupting thier minds with thoughts of swalllow ... equality shudders, and then once they assume direct control of the childrens' brains they will amass an army with which to resurrect the great Demonlord Cucumberhands. All of society shall perish.   I see now... It's all connected! Onion wants to make kids autistic, then turn them gay in order to rise to power! Censor Steven Universe! Destroy gay autistic onions!"

stevenuniverse,3dy35n,anders_,8,Tue Jul 21 01:14:50 2015 UTC,I wanted to know what she looked like as a cyclops
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,Sadi_Reddit,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:03 2015 UTC,What about if she were a Biclops?

stevenuniverse,3dy35n,ColeTheo,7,Mon Jul 20 18:25:27 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, I LOVE Garnet's eyes! But, yeah, her shades fit her personality so much more. Still, these are great."
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,RealBillWatterson,6,Mon Jul 20 19:52:00 2015 UTC,That one on the top right tho
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,DenryuRocket110,5,Mon Jul 20 21:44:41 2015 UTC,"Well, Garnet probably uses shades not to look stoic, but to hide that she's a fusion. Or to not scare people (don't tell me you weren't a bit scared when her third eye showed up when she played Meat Beat Mania). Or... Sapphire hides her eye, maybe she has a complex about that?"
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,alecksmugino,5,Mon Jul 20 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"We need an episode where Garnet suddenly decides that the shades aren't always necessary due to some plot device within the episode.   Now that she's become more expressive, we need to see how goofy she looks when she's using all 3 of her eyes to react to something absurd, like UG.   EDIT: Well reading the comments, some people are sort of torn on seeing Garnet shed her shades, so let's just say I want an episode."
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,Jenicsaco,4,Mon Jul 20 23:01:26 2015 UTC,Wow these are really well-done.
stevenuniverse,3dy35n,So-Strange,3,Mon Jul 20 18:28:59 2015 UTC,I get the feeling Garnet's top eye is a fusion of Ruby's left eye and Sapphire's inner-eye.

stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,joeythehamster,25,Mon Jul 20 14:07:09 2015 UTC,I wonder what the crystal gems thought of their relationship.  Pearl obviously used to not like or want to interact with humans.
stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,MurfDurfWurf,28,Mon Jul 20 15:56:33 2015 UTC,Pearl probably thought they were both bad influences on each other.
stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,SmartAlec105,28,Mon Jul 20 17:13:15 2015 UTC,... which probably just drove Amethyst to hang with Vidalia all the more.  Meanwhile Garnet was probably neutral but wary of what might happen as Vidalia aged.
stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,fennric,14,Mon Jul 20 17:18:45 2015 UTC,Vidalia was merely something that would last a few decades. That's probably why she didn't think Greg would cause Rose to give up her physical form.
stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,SmartAlec105,2,Mon Jul 20 17:23:20 2015 UTC,They may not have been fully aware - she might done it quietly like her wrestling career - which only got noticed after Steven left a flyer out.
stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,treetown1,16,Mon Jul 20 23:10:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting, we all assume Amethyst gets her hair from young Greg, but she could've also gotten it from Vidalia's long locks. I'm guessing a mixture of both."
stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,MonstrousGiggling,13,Mon Jul 20 16:26:36 2015 UTC,"Inspiration of style from Greg, motivation from Vid?"
stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,mothernaturer,7,Mon Jul 20 16:51:45 2015 UTC,Yeah! I feel like that works and makes sense. Greg is such a sweet guy where as Vidalia comes off as a badass who doesn't give a fu<k kind of like Amethyst.
stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,MonstrousGiggling,6,Mon Jul 20 16:55:16 2015 UTC,"you can swear here haha, and yeah I can't imagine amethyst having anyone to give her drive to do anything before Vidalia. their relationship is so so cool."
stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,mothernaturer,12,Mon Jul 20 17:00:05 2015 UTC,She had long hair before either of them were born.
stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,AlyxRice,5,Mon Jul 20 17:04:39 2015 UTC,Wait a minute... is that... has that picture been a foreshadowing of Historical Friction THIS ENTIRE TIME?!

stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,BlowsForJs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:39 2015 UTC,They're probably assuming Mayor Dewey is one of the guys in the picture.
stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,kidkolumbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:57:11 2015 UTC,I think that's on the same level as Pearl liking pie earlier.  It's not going to ruin the show if that picture is fake.  I'm also inclined to believe they forced Amethyst to age up for that picture for whatever reason.  Probably because people know children and sharks don't mix.
stevenuniverse,3dy3p8,kidkolumbo,8,Tue Jul 21 02:58:07 2015 UTC,"This art style is ridiculously cute. Looks like it's been drawn in crayon.  And I love Vidalia acting like a cool big sis to Amethyst! I seriously cannot get enough of these two, they are TOO GOOD"

stevenuniverse,3dzfw4,galvanicmechamorph,3,Mon Jul 20 20:15:46 2015 UTC,Why do all the Sardonyx flairs look identical here and in the post but in the flair selection box they're different?
stevenuniverse,3dzfw4,Tobl4,3,Mon Jul 20 20:25:20 2015 UTC,"I wish I knew. As far as I can see the flairs aren't defined any differently from any of the other flairs. They're each given their own name and refer to their own flair, but they don't return a different emote."
stevenuniverse,3dzfw4,mediumdeviation,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:10 2015 UTC,"That would be because you use an attribute^=""value"" selector which matches every link whose href-attribute starts with ""#su-sardonyx"".  It wasn't a problem before because the long emotes (garnetsmile) came after the shorter one (garnet) in the stylesheet, overriding the shorter emote's image. You could fix that by moving the selector for ""#su-sardonyx"" further up in the stylesheet and making sure to always place shorter names before longer ones, but that's really just a workaround. The proper way of handling this is to switch all selectors for specific images to attribute=""value"" selectors.  Edit: flairs aren't affected, so I switched the language to emotes."
stevenuniverse,3dzfw4,Tobl4,4,Mon Jul 20 20:57:43 2015 UTC,"Great. It's fixed, so the Sardonyxing may begin."
stevenuniverse,3dzfw4,mediumdeviation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:34 2015 UTC,You'd want the start with selector because then you can extend emotes with postfixes

The BetterPonyEmote extension uses them, and since /r/mylittlepony uses prefix selectors the postfixes are backwards compatible (ie. they have no effect on the emotes for regular users, but still show up as they should without the postfix)"

stevenuniverse,3e1jvw,Gandalf_the_Gangsta,12,Tue Jul 21 06:26:48 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the negativity people have towards the teaching in this episode is not that it was dangerous, not the physical aspect, but the mental aspect. How Pearl not only taught her to respect and trust her as a teacher, which would indeed be fine, but that her life, comparatively to Steven's, held no worth. That the only value she had was as his guardian, and she was to seek death before risking failure."
stevenuniverse,3e1jvw,A_BEAUTIFUL_PONY,3,Tue Jul 21 08:26:50 2015 UTC,"Actually that meshes well with Pearl's own mindset, Eastern culture, and warrior culture as well. To us, as outside observers from a society that celebrates every individual as important and life as the most sacred of all things, yes, the mindset that Pearl is instilling in Connie is reprehensible. But from the perspective of a warrior, it's simply life. You live and die on the battlefield. The only thing you can hope for is that your death is for a good cause. Training that mindset into Connie would help keep her focused on the mission, which as far as Pearl's intentions went was to protect Steven. Similarly, in most Eastern cultures the individual is typically not considered important. It's far more collectivist, as evidenced by their religions placing less of an emphasis on moral decisions and more on fulfilling your role in society. For a warrior on the battlefield, the ""I am nothing"" mindset is completely fitting, because as far as they're concerned they as an individual are nothing."
stevenuniverse,3e1jvw,FedoraFerret,2,Tue Jul 21 13:58:58 2015 UTC,"That is the point I was trying to address. For a swordsman, especially a chivalrous one, this is the mentality. Most swordsman do not last very long. If Connie were taught caution, she might have abandoned her liege. Loyalty is often held above one's own life, and dying with honor is better than living in shame.  That's also why Connie knows how to fight. However, Pearl did not teach Connie recklessness. Connie is an accomplished Swordsman, and Garnet has had somewhat of a biased opinion of Pearl. Also, Connie isn't completely infatuated with Steven. Luckily, that's not something you can teach."
stevenuniverse,3e1jvw,Edymnion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:50 2015 UTC,"This is a greatly distorted view of western knightdom.  Chivalry as we know it today did not really exist then.  Knights having undying loyalty to their liege was also generally not a thing either.  A knight was in service to his liege in the same way a modern security guard is in service to their company, aka because they are being paid.  As a rule of thumb, medieval western knights were mercinaries, they fought because they were paid to fight, not because of some spiritual cause or oath they took.  Heck, that paid relationship is where we get the modern notion of the knight in shining armor and the black knight from.  That armor was extremely expensive and rusted easily.  When not in use, they would coat the armor in black oil to prevent rust.  A black knight was a knight with no pay that couldn't afford to properly care for his armor, who left the armor black on all the time, and as such was more likely to turn to banditry.  The knight in shining armor was rich or in the service of a wealthy lord who could easily afford his armor, so much so that they'd be able to polish it.  At no point was a swordsman considered worthless, in fact they were highly prized and sought after, if they were any good.  Most fought for money and saw the possibility of dying in combat as an occupational hazard.  Virtually none would have thrown themselves in front of an arrow for their king unless they were being well paid to do so."
stevenuniverse,3e1jvw,chipperpip,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:13:15 2015 UTC,"Connie's training outfit put me in mind of Gohan's training with Piccolo during DBZ, which physically made Pearl's look like a cakewalk.  That said, I agree with A_BEAUTIFUL_PONY that the main issue with Pearl's training was the mental aspect; Connie is too young to be indoctrinated with such a nihilistic battle philosophy, especially not for Steven's sake, as he wants a friend and partner, not a meat shield."

stevenuniverse,3e136a,BlueRoanoke,4,Tue Jul 21 06:54:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if this was all at least partially canon.  The fact that Hinduism derives from India I think also has the potential to be significant.  I can't speak for all Westerners, but Hinduism, as well as Indian culture in general, does not seem to be thoroughly studied or well understood by many people.  Because of that, even linking some of the simplest tropes that would be head-bangingly obvious to someone in the know feels creative and fresh on our side of the fence.  Last time I saw this executed so well was ATLA which, in addition to grafting cultural aspects and mythology from various Asian cultures, tipped its hand by writing everything in the show in Chinese.  Which…now that I think about it, I'm going to write a separate post on how Steven Universe might do a little of the same  because there really, really might be something there.   I think the a caste system is absolutely an aspect of gem culture, though I don't know if the roles translate over perfectly.  Also, I would not be surprised to find more than four levels when we start to learn more about this stuff (since gems have been shown to have more than 4 distinct powers).    Your proposal that more hands is a symbol of power is an interesting one.  I've really only seen the argument that the number of appendages represents closeness (or alternatively, that the appendage that becomes more prevalent than usual reflects the disagreement in the relationship).  If multiple appendages is a sign of lack of closeness, then Garnet is an especially close fusion.  However, if multiple appendages are a sign of strength, that also means she's an especially weak one as far as fusions go.    On an unrelated note, Siddartha was the most recent Buddha?  Didn't he live well before the Common Era?  Has there not been a new Buddha since?       I'm off to read too much into what probably isn't an inscription in the temple, thanks for the information and inspiration!"

stevenuniverse,3e136a,shadowknuxem,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:54:13 2015 UTC,I took a class on comparative religions and I find this to be very true. It seems the show has taken a lot from other cultures and westernized them. I first thought of that when I saw Opal and how she looked fairly Hindu.

stevenuniverse,3dyvgu,LordAnon5703,14,Mon Jul 20 22:14:57 2015 UTC,I think they thought she was basically brain dead due to the crack in her gem.
stevenuniverse,3dyvgu,CosmicBadass,6,Mon Jul 20 23:38:36 2015 UTC,I don't think so.  I remember them saying the found the mirror at the Galaxy Warp as is.
stevenuniverse,3dyvgu,xespera,16,Tue Jul 21 03:43:28 2015 UTC,"I thought every gem was a Gem. They fight corrupted gems but the implication was that they once were sentient, self aware and intelligent. They BECAME corrupted. Pearl has a line for that somewhere in Season 1 trying to explain things to Steven.   The Crystal Gems bubble them until they can find a better solution, but some got shoved into tech to power it. The Crystal gems Believed there was no sanity, no self-awareness left in them, but the shock they have at Lapis isn't that the gem ONCE had intelligence, it was that the gem STILL had intelligence. That Lapis was still alive in there, still self aware. Still awake, thinking, trapped, alone"
stevenuniverse,3dyvgu,miradasuelle,8,Mon Jul 20 22:09:55 2015 UTC,"They mention in the little school Gem short that if a Gem is trapped in an object, it cannot reform. So...that's important?"
stevenuniverse,3dyvgu,xespera,7,Mon Jul 20 23:27:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the way they put it my interpretation was ""If there isn't room for the full grown entity to appear, then it won't appear"", so confining it in a bubble makes it too crampt for the projected body to manifest.   Additionally, putting it in a mirror or pillow, or using it to power something, would also block the reforming... I think"
stevenuniverse,3dyvgu,Doctursea,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:04 2015 UTC,You guys all seem to be forgetting that every gem has been a certain size or below if they turned into something so large gems are probably not sentient

stevenuniverse,3dyvgu,Coyt,9,Mon Jul 20 21:52:25 2015 UTC,"Wait so... CAN Gems ""die""? Those forced fusions makes me think no, even if a Gem is ground to dust each particle still has a consciousness like how the split up gems were hands and feet. But I guess they can reach a point where they can't regenerate by themselves? Are all Gems that have ever been broken still hanging out in some purgatory, unable to reconstruct themselves?"

stevenuniverse,3dyvgu,edrudathec,8,Mon Jul 20 23:42:10 2015 UTC,What if a broken/cracked/not-fully-dead gem is used on homeworld to power gem tech using what little power it has left?

stevenuniverse,3dyvgu,pluckydame,2,Tue Jul 21 00:39:48 2015 UTC,Fossil fuels aren't derived from sentient creatures. The organisms they're derived from are infinitely far from our evolutionary equals. So gems using gems to power their stuff is definitely different than using fossil fuels.

stevenuniverse,3dyvgu,DuesCataclysmos,7,Mon Jul 20 22:50:27 2015 UTC,"Well we already know that Gems can be created for singular purposes. Amethyst for fighting, Pearl for servitude, I wouldn't be surprised if even Ruby and Sapphire were created for their respective powers, I mean an eternal flame (baby) is quite useful.   Since diamonds are the rarest of precious gems on earth it wouldn't be a stretch to say that the 4 Diamonds created all kinds of lesser rarity gems as power sources, tools, and even weapons (see the little shard on Jasper's electric prod?). These are some ruthless beings, just look at their fusion experiments, so I wouldn't put it past them that they would just see lesser gems for their uses rather than any sort of personal freedom."
stevenuniverse,3dyvgu,Sylocat,6,Mon Jul 20 23:47:10 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting these gems have a standout ugly shape (which the storyboard artist definitely put effort into illustrating), so it's possible that ""imperfect"" gems were used in tools and power mechanisms rather than letting them manifest into sentient beings. It's akin to how Nazi Germany and Spartans, among other societies that strived for ""purism"" in health , treated newborns with defects. If this all rings true, we may get our first idea on why Rose preferred Greg didn't know her history too deeply (assuming the ship is Rose's)."

If you look, all of the center gems look like have a cracked part or piece missing. However, lapis was found at the warp pad so I believe there may be more to her story. I also think they have advanced past only using gems to power things. (They might still sometimes)"

Except for Bar Rescue and Home Improvement channel, reality TV is on for background noise and talking points when friends are over. Discovery and History channel are now travesties of what they've used to be: ie Shark Week's a joke and the epitome of what the channel has become and History is too busy doing pseudo drama bullshit and alien theories.

stevenuniverse,3dyx78,TokenToken2,2,Tue Jul 21 01:09:24 2015 UTC,"Which makes me wonder why she uses a spear...usually one handed... I mean yeah Samurai had spears but honorable combat, at least the one on one kind, was always done with a sword. I understand that this is so Connie can wield Rose's sword with Steven later on as Stevonnie but I can't recall any time that Pearl used a sword outside of practice."
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,Wetmang,10,Mon Jul 20 23:55:40 2015 UTC,"Probably because her spear is her proper gem weapon, making it more versatile (the size changes, she can channel her power through it to fire energy blasts... and apparently bullets, they work as throwing weapons, etc) and she can replace them whenever needed. Whereas swordsmanship seems more like a personal interest of hers, and her sword collection seems to just be a bunch of conventional human weapons.  I figure it's a bit like a soldier having swordsmanship as a hobby: they enjoy it and they might be pretty good at it, but when they actually have to fight they'd rather have their rifle."
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,ToastyMozart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:15:16 2015 UTC,"I would think that Pearl would want to teach Connie the more battle tested weapon since Pearl has replaced her sword, protecting Rose, with a Spear. Especially since the only reason she's teaching Connie is to protect Steven so you would think she would teach Connie the weapon that has been most successful for her. But again we have to have Connie use Rose's sword later on so it makes sense in a story telling sense."
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,Wetmang,5,Tue Jul 21 00:21:50 2015 UTC,"Spears are pretty well battle tested, they were the principal weapon during human conflict for a long while because of their simple design, long reach, and thick row and file capability."
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,McDaioh,4,Tue Jul 21 00:33:01 2015 UTC,"Not to mention it was much easier to learn to use effectively than a sword, and most armies consisted mostly of untrained or barely trained peasants."
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,Noir_Bass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:56 2015 UTC,Exactly
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,Wetmang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:35:31 2015 UTC,Swords are the most romantic weapon. They were not the most practical or common for most of history.
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,detroitmatt,4,Tue Jul 21 02:20:11 2015 UTC,"Well, her spears are her gem weapon. She can create them at will, they grow and shrink as needed, and she seems to be able to fire some kind of projectile from them. They're very versatile.   In sworn to the sword we also see her with a sword in her flashback/projection, and there are a lot of weapons left in the strawberry fields, suggesting that a lot of gems weren't using their gem weapons (which disappear when  the owner does). So either there are some situations where a gem might not want to use her gem weapon, or not all gems have weapons. Maybe she had to earn her spear, or learn how to summon it somehow. So she learned to fight with swords first, but now that ability is less useful because her spear is better than any sword she can get."
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,Mr_Mars,3,Tue Jul 21 00:15:26 2015 UTC,"It seems that almost all non-gem weapons seem to be less effective, convenient, and versatile than gem weapons. It would be an interesting story to see how Pearl earned her weapons but the struggle of Steven using his gem weapon seems to be unique to him as Amethyst remarks at how effortless it is to summon her weapon, something that still puts a strain on Steven even though he knows how to summon it.   So you have to wonder why or how Gems came to use these single purpose, can't fire projectiles or multiply or increase in size, weapons if they are so inferior to a Gem weapon that is so effortless to create. Rose's sword makes a bit of sense since she doesn't have a weapon but it seems unique that her gem weapon is not actually a weapon where as all other fighting implements we've seen are actual weapons by nature."
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,Wetmang,3,Tue Jul 21 00:29:39 2015 UTC,Pearl has to fight the Corp alot. /s  Her gem weapon seems to be a spear. She is probably stuck using it in most situations so she just used her spear instead of a sword.
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,tatooine0,5,Tue Jul 21 00:11:58 2015 UTC,Or something else.  She made everything disappear and knocked them down when she disarmed them.  Considering that she was losing it emotionally - that makes it even more scary - not less.

Second, Steven heals with spit, not tears.  Third, I don't know about immediately, he would probably be in shock at first, and I don't think he'd even think to try it right away.

Initially she thinks she must find something to protect and be useful for, Garnet and Amethyst, protecting Steven, being of use to the group. But what Garnet did in Friendship is show Pearl that there isn't anyone to serve anymore. Their empathy for the shared experience of being the outcasts of society makes them strong and by finally acknowledging that, Pearl can finally let go of the grief of failing her Daimyo and embrace what they are, Ronin."

stevenuniverse,3dyx78,PaladinWiggles,7,Mon Jul 20 21:47:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure rules of momentum work for Pearl, she could be able to stop on a millimeter.   Technically she can still stop fine within a millimeter while obeying rules of momentum. It just implies her ""muscles"" (rock/hard light muscles) are very very strong."
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,Dawnofdusk,2,Tue Jul 21 01:06:41 2015 UTC,"As far as momentum goes, Sardonyx was able to pause with her giant hammer right before she hit the last block of the communications tower to make that comment about sometimes being known to smash etc... so I don't think it's too far-fetched to guess that Pearl can stop short very quickly in a similar manner."

stevenuniverse,3dyx78,MatttheM,6,Mon Jul 20 17:58:07 2015 UTC,"I think Pearl's intent was probably to hit Connie's sword with enough force to knock it out of her hand, rather than to hit Connie herself."
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,Thechynd,5,Mon Jul 20 21:54:48 2015 UTC,"The answer is NO. COnnie was in perfect position to block/parry that hit. Her sword was up, she saw the hit coming, all she needed to do was just turn her wrist about an inch, at most, and she would have been in the most perfect position to strike at pearl where she had no guard."
stevenuniverse,3dyx78,VengefulJan,8,Tue Jul 21 00:08:54 2015 UTC,seems to me like Connie could have blocked it anyway; she moved aside so Steven could block it so she must have seen it coming in some capacity  and I'm not saying she could block a full force swing from Pearl but I don't think Pearl would have tried to hit her full force anyway

stevenuniverse,3e1og9,mophram,5,Tue Jul 21 07:22:16 2015 UTC,"Pennsylvania is called the ""Keystone State"" because it was in the middle of the United States' original thirteen colonies. It's the state's real-world nickname, and here are the rest of them (take note of everything in bold).  Also, after thinking about it, it's pretty clear that there's only one state that could really be the location for Steven Universe, since Keystone is ""the next state over"" and there's only one state near it with a significant amount of coastline solely overlooking the ocean. Steven and the Gems... live somewhere in New Jersey. This could be supported by the fact that, in Political Power, Mayor Dewey references ""Ocean Town"" which has a very similar name to a city to the south in the very same state (Ocean City, New Jersey)... so I'd say it's very likely that they live somewhere in or near a parallel version of Atlantic City."

In our world, Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia all have coastlines and both MD and DE border Pennsylvania.  Edit: also we learn in Keeping It Together that Fish Stew Pizza has a 443 area code which, in our world, is a Maryland area code, used primarily in the Eastern half of the state."

Like, I've been into that show for ages and haven't found a community that tosses around GF references so casually and actually gets them while also being into another awesome show (unlike the GF sub which is exclusively for GF and so tends to be more serious and biased at times about the show. Not a bad thing, but the references are pretty straightforward there. I do love that SU is referenced a lot there though, heehee).   It's like I'm talking with a friend about a different subject and they just casually throw in a GF reference. On the GF sub it's the same with SU. I just love this, Means a lot to me seeing as I have nobody to talk to about both SU and GF irl. Now I can be both serious and joke about both shows on either sub.  The problem is, I got so used to this cross-referencing I try hard to restrain myself from making SU/GF references on other subs. Home is where I can cross-reference things. :P"

The main difference is with the Watermelon Stevens they weren't fighting Lapis, they were fighting Steven. At full power and with her plant constructs Rose might have been as strong as Lapis or much stronger. Steven at full power could probably take Lapis by himself."
stevenuniverse,3e0lx5,Opt1mus_,3,Tue Jul 21 02:19:11 2015 UTC,Also I'm pretty sure if there was more than one Jasper like gem the Crystal Gems would've been screwed. I'm.sure other warrior gems at Homeworld have way more experience fighting other gems   That is a good point Garnet and Pearl are out of practice of fighting thinking gems and Amethyst only fight corrupted gems.

More than likely this idea of coming to earth as invaders, realizing the worth of humans, and trying to redeem themselves would be applied to all the Gems rather than just trying to shatter the God-Like image of Rose. I think all the CGs have some level of compensation they owe to the earth BUT I DO think you've got the right idea that Rose's hurt was the deepest of all and that her sacrifice to create Steven will be seen as the greatest act of redemption amongst all the CGs. It may not have the cathartic Shakespearean fall-from-grace of Rose's image as a God-like being but it will probably emphasize that it was Rose that started everything and she has the greatest burden to bare."

Also, ever since the SDCC extended theme, Yellow Diamond is a character that is making my hype levels super high.  What are you hoping will happen the most?  Probably a Lapis redemption because Lapis is literaly doing an eternal tug of war with Jasper under the sea. My hopes were high until we got the extended theme with Jasper holding Lapis by the arm, so I don't know how a redemption is gonna work. Keep my hopes high, but very unlikely.

Yellow Diamond: I needed someone who would do as I told without question,someone who I had no use for, someone disposable. Peridot: Is that what you think of me? Is that what I am to you? A pawn?  Yellow Diamond: Exactly. You actually thought that you were useful to me? Ha! You're not even worth my time. You can just stay on that planet. (ends transmission)  Peridot: (Crying) I can't believe that all this time she was just using me. Go ahead clods destroy me. I ain't any use to anyone. Just end it for me already.   Steven goes to Peridot to comfort her  and slowly the other Gems join in and Peridot is forgiven. In other words Peridot finds out she means nothing to Yellow Diamond and is hurt by the fact that she doesn't and her fellings are swayed  on how she feels about the Crystal Gems.  Way 2 is basically the same but Yellow Diamond comes to earth . Peridot isn't captured, but she tells Peridot that she was a pawn in person and Peridot runs off and comes back to help the gems fight Yellow Diamond."

YD not really giving a shit about her, but only about the info she has or the Cluster.  Cue Steven to come over, give her a hug and say she never really needed YD anyway, she kept the Gems on their toes all by herself.... :D"

Off the bat, it's unclear if R/S are different from a pre-fused Garnet or not, like, if R/S/Amethyst is different from Garnet/Amethyst, at the moment, but as it makes no difference in my end point, I'll refer to this just as R/S instead of a distinction between Garnet or the two separate.  R/S/Amethyst/Pearl=Alexandrite.  So, remove Amethyst or Pearl...  R/S/Amethyst=Sugilite.  R/S/Pearl=Sardonyx.  So, take any of them out of the equation for making Alexandrite, and we get a different fusion."

As a kid I grew up with the Disney classics - Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White etc. etc. and in a good 97% of the cases I hated, hated the singing. I was like, 'yeah, okay, can we get back to the plot now?'.   In SU surprisingly I don't mind it one bit, I love it. I think it's because almost all songs provide a very real insight into the characters singing them or they focus our attention on what the author is trying to say in the episode. They have a purpose and they're catchy as heck, I guess that helps me love them."
stevenuniverse,3e2ut7,fwurpo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:10 2015 UTC,I actually wanted an idea that you can play real songs in the soundtrack to tell how the character's thought. Or like an AMV.
stevenuniverse,3e2ut7,just4thelolz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:14 2015 UTC,It's going to be hard because each character usually has a specific intrument that plays during their song and a whole lot of times in the background.

My guess is that eventually, probably either at the end of this season or some point in the next season, Peridot realizes that humans and Earth aren't so bad (likely due to Steven) and she ends up becoming tech support for the Gems, either living in the temple with them or maybe living in a space pod or something."
stevenuniverse,3e0axm,RySenkari,3,Tue Jul 21 00:20:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for Peridot's redemption it kinda lives and dies with Steven."
stevenuniverse,3e0axm,JemAndTheHologramz,6,Mon Jul 20 23:44:25 2015 UTC,My personal favorite theory is that she'll continue to pester the Crystal Gems but they'll ignore her to focus on more important things. Like she's not even threatening anymore.  There's a comic on tumblr that explains what I'm getting at but I can't find it right now. It's honestly a hilarious idea.
stevenuniverse,3e0axm,ItsJustJoss,5,Mon Jul 20 23:48:39 2015 UTC,"Also, to add to your Homeworld theory, remember what happened when Peridot's peribot lost its leg? She crushed it. If that is any indication of how Homeworld treats injured gems, well........Peridot lost a leg(foot) didn't she?"

stevenuniverse,3e0axm,Vittali,4,Mon Jul 20 23:51:45 2015 UTC,"Yes it would!  Edit: Perhaps that will be Peridot's redemption moment! Yellow Diamond goes to destroy Peridot with the same look on her face, BOOM! Enter the Crystal Gems to save her!

stevenuniverse,3e0axm,littlebigcheese,5,Tue Jul 21 05:16:45 2015 UTC,The first comic just made me feel bad for Peridot.
stevenuniverse,3e0axm,Emptymoleskine,4,Tue Jul 21 00:04:02 2015 UTC,I think the reason she lost her foot is so we can distinguish her from other Peridots...
stevenuniverse,3e0axm,Sadi_Reddit,2,Tue Jul 21 00:39:07 2015 UTC,Pearl cracking her Gem or ripping it off her body would just leave it for Steven to heal.  Crushing it with a hammer (or in a crusher) seems more irreversible.  I suspect Peridot wont die unless she gets caught in one of her own devices.

stevenuniverse,3e13ee,WesternImmortal,3,Tue Jul 21 03:36:56 2015 UTC,Jasper predating fusion is interesting but I don't think it would make a lot of sense. I think fusion existed as long as gem-kind has. The Jasper and Greg theory makes a lot of sense though. I agree with that she will definitely be different after Malachite.
stevenuniverse,3e13ee,pjoneill,2,Tue Jul 21 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"Wow, both of those are really interesting ideas, and you clearly put a lot of work into making this flow well!  We must have Jasper and Greg.  The world needs it.  Though I don't think anything romantic is likely to happen as a result of Jasper's size, I could see Greg giving her some unexpected compliment (e.g. big people give good hugs) that throws her for a loop and leads to some awesome character development.  My one concern is that Greg definitely tries to not be where he's not needed, and there would need to be circumstances in place for Steven to let Jasper near his favorite dad.  She's need to already be into her arc before she could get to know Greg, and he could help her finish it.  On a side note, another character that Jasper could learn from is Connie, because she isn't even a gem, but her strength comes from practice and experience.  Even though Jasper is super bulky, I don't think gems lift, so she'd probably be perplexed by this skinny little human who made herself for formidable exclusively through practice.    I also really like that proto-fusion idea.  It's pretty clear that whether it's just a design choice or not, Jasper is a) made to look and act like Amethyst, b) dichromatic in a show where everybody else is monotone rainbow, and c) she has serious history/beef with fusions.  One thing that would interest me to see is that I'm not sure how she could be two gems more loosely melded together than amethyst (gems which are presumably the same size as amethyst's components), and yet her gem is so much smaller than amethyst's.  I'm really not well versed in any form of science, and I know there are a couple exceptions (e.g. ice), but last time I checked,, condensing something made it smaller.  Oh god.  I just realized something.    Jasper's gem is the smallest one in the show.    She's overcompensating     XD"

Connie is 100% human and Steven is 50%, so they became a tall 75% human 25% gem with (as far as we know) mostly human features.

(also he's a deep fried cinnamon bun, leave him be! :3)  The human characters are necessary to the less sci-fi side of the plot, that portrays Steven growing up as a normal kid in a normal city, forming friendships with other human beings. Several adult characters have said things along the lines of ""Ah you're Greg's kid!"" or ""So you're Steven!"".... it shows that despite Steven having never met these people, they already know who he is thanks to being mates with his dad. The writing is much more organic this way... so yes, I think it is kinda important where these characters go.

There is a reason why Garnet says, ""That's why the people of this world believe in."" The character have their own set of flaws that make them unique, and that's why I don't hate character in SU, even Ronaldo. The characters that we don't know anything about, like Suitcase Sam, is a great way in keeping the story alive. We know that we will learn more about the characters.

Only... I think for the most part, the episodes that centre around the 'secondary' Beach City human characters just objectively aren't as good. There's always exceptions - I thought Onion Friend was hilarious, for example - but it feels like most of them are just 'nothing' or one-note characters. Now, it's odd, as if you've got characters you're only going to use once or twice a season, you can do really major stuff with them that you can't with a regular character.  That said, one of my friends loves Ronaldo, so who knows."
stevenuniverse,3dzti9,Casaham,3,Mon Jul 20 21:36:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. IMO, the best human non-Greg non-Connie episode we got was probably...Jeez, Historical Friction, I guess? Maybe Joy Ride, but I would argue that that's not purely human since they find Peridot's escape pod.  I don't know, maybe the human episodes are really good, but we just don't appreciate them as much because we don't like the characters as much? But personally, I think that episodes like Joking Victim, Island Adventure, Horror Club, KBCW, Rising Tides/Crashing Skies are good. Some of them are just alright.

stevenuniverse,3dzti9,Emptymoleskine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:49:17 2015 UTC,Joking Victim and Island Adventure are two episodes that I really can't enjoy because of the focus on character relationships that mean nothing to me.  Even if they are telegraphing behaviors we may see later in the Gems - and the settings ideas and the song are GREAT - the lack of a crucial important event for Steven loses me.  When we see Pearl being creepy with Garnet even if Steven appears not to understand the implications and following outrage it MATTERS to Steven.  Watching Lars and Sadie be awful to each other has less impact on Steven and means less to me too.

IE they represented or contrasted with Steven as the hero of the show.  Ronaldo remains problematic that way.  He just isn't based on anything real to me and he doesn't have a genuine relationship with Steven.  Oddly enough, Onion JUST 'got real' when Vidalia gave him her rocker-chick mom mellow greeting as she chatted with Amethyst.  So unreal Ronaldo could shape up very fast at any moment and become a full-on worthwhile Steven Universe character.  I love the dreamy environment of Beach City and like the idea that we may eventually kind of know every face that we recognize in group shots of the town.  That makes the environment seem that much more real.  And it also takes advantage of the fact that in animation, you can draw characters who are voiced by mega-stars in the background whenever you like.  Every 'extra' can potentially have his day.  I liked the Pizzas.  I like Connie.  I like the Fryman family - with the exception of Ronaldo.  I am getting less tolerant of Dewey rather than more but thought Jamie was a hoot and have always liked the cool kids.  Lars was kind of a horrible person, so that got old.  Making Sadie 'horrible' too did nothing to redeem Lars.  But I still like the Donut shop scenes."

stevenuniverse,3dzti9,Triximancer,5,Tue Jul 21 02:13:29 2015 UTC,"The minor characters exist to serve the stories of the Gems/Steven/Connie/Greg, not really to be a focus on their own.

stevenuniverse,3dzti9,ItsJustJoss,4,Mon Jul 20 21:34:01 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm hoping. I just want to see more sides to the supporting characters as the show goes on, and maybe even bridge together the human and Gem sides to the story. I also believe this will happen eventually, I'm just surprised that 65-ish episodes in, we still know so little about these characters."
stevenuniverse,3dzti9,goticosuave,5,Mon Jul 20 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"Remember, we aren't even a half of the way through the total episodes ordered. There will be plenty of time to develop them in their own time. Personally, I am about ready to get more backstory on Lars, and more of Sadie as well. We know practically nothing about Lars, and we have seen Sadie's mom, but don't know anything else about her.  You do raise a good point, about Buck Dewey and the issue he has with his dad. That would make a full episode in itself. I also want to know a little bit more about the Pizza family (is that their last name, or have they just not given them a last name, like with Onion's family?)"
stevenuniverse,3dzti9,Silgrenus,4,Mon Jul 20 22:10:56 2015 UTC,"Oh man, join the club. I've been waiting on some Lars backstory since his first prominent episode."
stevenuniverse,3dzti9,Silgrenus,3,Mon Jul 20 22:15:58 2015 UTC,"i guess people don't like those episodes because they usually don't bring anything new to the main plot. with more and more things on our plate people are becoming anxious to see the main plot developing.  each minor character takes the spot at his time. sure we know little about sourcream, but we already know a lot about sadie, buck and jamie, for example. and i do think vidalia was a step in the right direction, being the first human to actually be connected to the gems besides steven. maybe if we start to see more of these, the minor characters relating with the gems, they could be managed somehow on the main plot and then we can have little bits of plot in minor character centered episodes"
stevenuniverse,3dzti9,cafwcp,3,Mon Jul 20 21:59:13 2015 UTC,"They're important because Steven's race is important. He is literally mixed-race, as opposed to human mixed-race people who are arguably part of a social construct.  Garnet says that even the Crystal Gems don't know what Steven needs. Greg says that he can't help Steven with his magic, most of the time.   Steven needs to spend time with the non-Gem characters so as to remember that he isn't just a gem. He's the first and so far only human gem to ever exist. He needs to remember his other roots as well.  So in terms of them being less dramatic, I agree. There's not much. But the thing is, that is why we fell in love with SU in the first place. Too many serious episodes, and the show will be crushed under its own weight, like Adventure Time. The Stevenbombs have been great for Gem and major plot storylines. But I think now, a few episodes are going to be needed for more human storylines, even if they are as insignificant as helping Ronaldo getting a boy/girlfriend or something."

None of the minor characters are very deep or interesting, some being annoying cough ronaldo cough and others just having little to no impact to me. I look at many characters, and the show wants me to care, but they don't give me a reason to care.   The reason these characters are unimpressive is because they aren't built upon. Jamie and Vidalia are the only minor characters I actually like, because they're emotions and thoughts have substance. Everyone else is just... a face. They're better than a lot of other shows minor characters, but still meaningless to me mostly."

I think these episodes are important to understanding Beach City as a whole.

That, and at the end of the day this is a show where they 'always save the day' and saving Lapis is a very definite save the day event.  I also definitely reckon she'll be involved in the show escalating villains upwards from Jasper. The CGs were little match for Jasper and Peridot, what're they ever going to do against Yellow Diamond and homeworld without Lapis.  Idk though, I could see her getting a sad fate, but not a fate that'd remove her from the show. Whatever that means."

Anyway, it said there that fusions will always be fusions. Meaning, Garnet will always be a fusion of a Ruby and a Sapphire, Opal will always be a fusion of a Pearl and an Amethyst, etc."
stevenuniverse,3dyt5u,nixlheimr,12,Mon Jul 20 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I doubt the explanation was from any one on the staff, though. That would mean they were overtly acknowledging that multiple characters per gem actually exist, something the show has only implied so far (even if heavily).   I'm not sure how to work out the math exactly, but if Garnets/Opals/Malachites/etc. were always fusions, the amount of single gems must be very small. Or it might not be possible, at all. I'm not sure. Maybe someone can help with the math here...I think this is a ""combinations"" problem.  I think we have 7 known non-fusion gems...  Ruby  Sapphire Amethyst Pearl Lapis Jasper Rose Quartz  Even if we were to restrict fusion to only pairs (two gems), there are 21 possible ways to combine these characters into separate distinct fusions (assuming I did the math right). The number only grows when you consider the fact that it is implied that as many as 5 gems can fuse at once (The temple, in ""Alone Together"" when Garnet, Pearl, Amethyst, and Steven were practicing fusion).  It might not seem like a lot but when there are only a few hundred gems names out there (at most), something doesn't seem right..."

stevenuniverse,3dyt5u,gemmath123,4,Mon Jul 20 19:06:21 2015 UTC,"Assuming /u/nixlheimr's rule that ""fusions will always be fusions"" holds true, we can mathematically determine the greatest possible number of single gems, or gems that cannot be further unfused.  Given a number x of single gems, 2x -1 is the total number of fusion formations between them. (For example: 2 gems, like Ruby and Sapphire, have 3 possible formations; while 3 gems, like our Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl, have 7 possible formations).  Assuming that the total number of possible formations equals the number of gems given title by mankind (Which Wikipedia puts at ~130), maths can determine the greatest possible number of single gems in the universe.  2x = 130  log₂ (130) = x  which puts x, the greatest possible number of single gems in the universe, at... 7.022. Hm.    Where did we go wrong? The math is sound. Like, if our ~7 gems were named A through G, that's a LOT of combinations to consider: AB, AC, AD...ABD, ABE, ABF... BCDE, BCDF, BCDG... Yet, in truth, the folly lies with our earlier assumption   ...that the total number of fusion formations in the universe equals the number of gems given title by mankind.   In truth, gem names are just that - names, attributed by man to entities of nature. Hell, new gems are still being discovered--they aren't bound by any strict finite number like elements are. So if the series ever ""resorts"" to using gems not yet named/discovered by man, it's not a copout. It's the option of greatest scientific probability.  TLDR? don't consider the number of gems named by man equal to the number of possible gems in the entire universe"
stevenuniverse,3dyt5u,shadowknuxem,3,Mon Jul 20 22:41:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughtful reply!!! And the math help!!! So there IS something afoot if we restrict ourselves to the assumption that human named gems and fusions will always be fusions. Nice to see that intuition more formally expressed.  And that's a good point, the gem list from which new gem types can be drawn from is not set in stone (puns!!!). The show can also come up with new gem types that are alien to earth.   However, I think this all leaves the original question of this thread very out in the open. Instead of ""going wrong"", I would say you just expressed a limitation of the assumption that all fusions will always be fusions. It seems very implausible unless there is an additional explanation like the one you proposed, additional ordinary minerals being used to supplement the list, or the trail I think I've sniffed out...that our known fusions can also occur as single gems."
stevenuniverse,3dyt5u,HypnoticPeaches,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"The only flaw with that logic, is that, even thought there are 21 different fusions that could occur, odds are we won't actually see 21 fusions. With all the characters we have seen, so far we've only seen 7 fusions. The pool of gem names only shrinks for each character shown.  This does run into an interesting situation where if fusions are always fusions, fusions that are completely different could share the same name, which goes against the mass produced theory as we've basically assumed that all gems that share a name are basically clones."

However I think you could make a special fusion with say 2 Sapphires and 1 Ruby that would still be a Garnet but possibly be called ""Blue Garnet"" that would be both more powerful and heavy on the Sapphire characteristics.   This sort of messes with the theory that more stable fusions are smaller and more humanoid though. If Lapis and Jasper were best buds would they form a tiny 2-armed Malachite?

stevenuniverse,3e15gh,beem0b0t,3,Tue Jul 21 04:03:50 2015 UTC,Upvote for Keystone Motel. I love everything about that episode (except for Pearl being sad). We got more Ruby and Sapphire. We got to see more of their powers including Ruby's weapon. Ruby's voice and animation were hilarious and expressive. The argument made sense and I could see where both of them were coming from. Greg continues to be the perfect dad. Steven continues to be empathetic and kind. And the resolution was the gayest thing that has ever been on Cartoon Network. Best episode ever.

That was the episode a lot of pieces fell into place for me and how the characters formed themselves in my mind. Steven's VA finally decided to pitch up his voice into the one we know today, and the concept of fusion blew my mind. I didn't believe they could pull off something that DBZ did so well, but they made it even better. They focused it not on fighting but as a study of what the participants felt about themselves and each other.   A really well rounded episode, and a good one to start some one off with if they are super stubborn about watching tv."

Mirror Gem because of the introduction of a new Gem and the tense atmosphere of the episode in total. It was unusual and left you so confused. Especially when the Gems found out about that, and when Steven ran away, wow. Overall, it was amazing.  Steven the Swordfighter was great also. When Pearl got stabbed, my mouth dropped open and I almost immediately started crying. It was so powerful and it happened so suddenly, that it was hard to take in all at once. I also loved seeing how Amethyst and Garnet react around each other without Pearl in the picture. They are actually really funny together.  And last but not least Rose's Room. Rose's Room was a fantastic episode. First we get a completely new experience to Steven and myself, and then we get to see the mystery of Rose's room. It was a great mix of mystery and creepiness.

stevenuniverse,3dzfhl,just4thelolz,8,Mon Jul 20 20:12:22 2015 UTC,This is how i imagine it could go down.  Peridot finds a way to seperate gems back no matter if fusion or otherwise. The crystals find out about this and thwart her. But in the process Peridot puts the seed of possibilities into Pearl's head. Pearl in turn ask if the process can bring back someone who gave up their form (i.e. rose) without harming the host. Peridot lies or does not know if it can or not. Pearl then begins to ponder in private for awhile. All the while trying to both think if its possible and how to hide this from garnet. This would have worked perfectly into the story if it was done at the beginning of pearl and garnets falling out. That way it could have seen like pearl was only trying to make amends. Either way Pearl sides with Peridot and works to extract rose from steven. Boom evil pearl.

Ruby is fiery and acts on impulse while Sapphire is cold and composed, and I'm guessing the way she acts around Ruby is sort of unique, based on her personality she'd seem distant and aloof to everyone else. How did these two get to love each other?  Seeing as there's already a strong theory that homeworld gems were each made for and assigned a function, my personal favorite theory is that they were made for completely different things and were forbidden to contact each other, somehow found each other and had a Romeo and Juliet - style romance, then joined Rose in her rebellion in order to be together, showing their defiance through fusion, another thing considered taboo on homeworld.

Sapphire was from the nobility, in charge of running things from the surface (future vison would be really useful for that) while Ruby comes from manual labor caste that lived deep underground, or inside volcanos."
stevenuniverse,3dx0if,mateogg,5,Mon Jul 20 14:44:27 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I support that Ruby/Sapphire Romeo and Juliet style romance theory. Rebecca Sugar said that there is going to be an episode explaining how they met and I'm so excited to see it."
stevenuniverse,3dx0if,miriamak,4,Mon Jul 20 15:54:46 2015 UTC,The being polar opposites thing is actually good though. They're the yin to each other's yang.
stevenuniverse,3dx0if,EggheadDash,4,Mon Jul 20 15:33:32 2015 UTC,"True, they balance it out while being in a relationship as Garnet, but how did they get here? They're so different I couldn't imagine them getting along at first, much less loving each other. Of course they probably learned to accept each other's differences and that opposites attract, but it seems to me there's a strong chance they could have hated or at least not understood each other at first.   Just makes their story all the more interesting. :P"
stevenuniverse,3dx0if,Le_random_user,2,Mon Jul 20 16:58:13 2015 UTC,"Call me old fashioned, but I'm sort of hoping for the good ole ""they hated each other and then they became sort of friends and then they fell in love"" trope. Maybe I'm reaching, but the way that they were arguing in Keystone Motel seemed kind of...normal to me? Even Ruby saying, ""You were right! You're always right!"" suggests to me that they have argued a lot in the past.  Plus, it makes a lot of sense to me, given their radically different personalities and the fact that Garnet talked to Jamie in Love Letters. Personally, I think that it would make sense if they went through that old trope and then Rose sort of played matchmaker? Like, Ruby was just some rando gem who fought alongside Rose just because she believed in the cause, and Sapphire was sort of a ""future vision"" advisor or something. There was a lot of tension between the two, but Rose saw that the two of them had underlying feelings for one another and encouraged for them to fuse. Or, maybe they just got to know each other on homeworld, and Garnet is the one who fought alongside Rose all of that time."

stevenuniverse,3e0oik,RoseBladePhantom,6,Tue Jul 21 01:33:03 2015 UTC,"I think that if we had episodes that were 20+, it wouldn't be as good as our current time.  20+ episode shows always have a commercial break inbetween, and it really doesn't keep your attention if it's any longer than 11 minutes. Plus, cramming in everything into a smaller number really makes the episode more powerful and suspenseful.  I'm not one of those to downvote something that I disagree with. I respect other's opinions."
stevenuniverse,3e0oik,Entomoligist,6,Tue Jul 21 01:35:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think their current running time is the sweetspot, they give us just about enough to get our fix and also look forward to the next episode.  I don't really have much criticims for this show, it's one of the few shows where I can see the people producing it actually know what they're doing"
stevenuniverse,3e0oik,Roler42,3,Tue Jul 21 01:38:47 2015 UTC,"It's been pointed out to me that the ""Omg it's Rose!!!...JK IT'S A MAN DRESSED AS ROSE OMG LOL"" gag is transmisogynistic and now I feel icky over it.  My only criticism is honestly Steven's terribly narrow and naive view of Gem history, gem war and what Homeworld even means if Peridot succeeds. I get it he's a child, he's able and smart enough to know when to put Lars in his place when speaking ill of Rose and to get Ruby and Sapphire to stop being angry just to be angry. He's a kid and can't be asked to understand something so hard to explain, but it seems like it's just a big joke and adventure to him. He sang a song about understanding it because he got hurt, but now he seems to be back to ladida let's go get Peridot, oh golly gee she got away, bye Peri! Unless he knows Peridot really sucks at her job."
stevenuniverse,3e0oik,AlasPoorBenedick,2,Tue Jul 21 02:11:52 2015 UTC,"The gag of Rose with someone other than Rose's face has been used in almost an exclusively transmisogynist way and that's kind of a downer. Also, the emphasis of ""always end on a joke"" really hindered Jailbreak, since ""They are so bad for each other."" right after Malachite happened was too soon.   That's it tho."
stevenuniverse,3e0oik,eulerhopepunk,4,Tue Jul 21 01:42:45 2015 UTC,I hope at some point they use that Rose face gag to show Steven having internal conflicts about Rose. Like maybe Rose turning around and she has Steven's face.  Another situation could her turning around and it be Yellow Diamond.
stevenuniverse,3e0oik,EternalKoniko,3,Tue Jul 21 02:30:36 2015 UTC,"How exactly is the gag transmisogynistic? I'm not trying to argue, I've just never heard the term used before now and, after looking it up, am trying to understand how this is an example of it."
stevenuniverse,3e0oik,negativegravity,2,Tue Jul 21 02:53:39 2015 UTC,"Using Uncle Grandpa or Greg's face on Rose as a joke reinforces the idea that women with facial hair are meant to be jokes, and while it's not as bad as I might have made it out to be, it's still oddly out of place in a show like SU."
stevenuniverse,3e0oik,eulerhopepunk,3,Tue Jul 21 02:55:39 2015 UTC,"I see. Forgot that Uncle Grandpa did it, too.... Nah, I understand. That's definitely something I'd expect to see in UG, but not in SU."
stevenuniverse,3e0oik,negativegravity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:01:01 2015 UTC,"I can see the point, but I think it's more about how goofy/ugly (sorry, Greg!), that those two look. Not that they were men. And I think there'd be a lot more criticism if they used an 'ugly' female."
stevenuniverse,3e0oik,eulerhopepunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:10:42 2015 UTC,"I agree to the first part, and I absolutely don't think it was intentional. It's just an after effect of the joke, most of all, and honestly when it happened I lost my shit. I trust the Crewniverse with this kind of thing, but Uncle Grandpa is a repeat offender with nasty ""man in a dress"" jokes so I'm significantly less willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Edit: Fixed some formatting."
stevenuniverse,3e0oik,eulerhopepunk,2,Tue Jul 21 07:13:09 2015 UTC,"Well, in my honest opinion, Uncle Grandpa is lazy comedy. I'm not surprised to hear they've done that joke often. And I still, don't think even UG intends to offend anyone. LBGT has only recently began such public, widespread acceptance. (And even now a lot of people are still intolerant and ignorant.) I don't think everybody sees the man in a dress as transmysoginistic. (A word I've only heard today.)   I just think it's more like ""Hey, wanna know what's funny? A man wearing a dress! Right?! Cuz men wouldn't normally wear dresses!"" And I can see the offense and how outdated a joke like this is in today's society, but I just think it's stupidity/ignorance, not malicious jabs."
stevenuniverse,3e0oik,baltosaa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:23:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think everybody sees the man in a dress as transmysoginistic.    That's why I'm makin' posts informing people of it, even if it's just people on a Reddit thread. Hanlon's razor is definitely in effect for the Crewniverse and Uncle Grandpa, and I think Alder's razor is too, because these things do have very visible effects on kids, the target audience for both shows.   I don't think it's intentional malice, far from it, but it's still a thing that happened and ignoring it won't make it not a thing that happened."

stevenuniverse,3e0oik,Mangulwort,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:54 2015 UTC,"I think all the humans are part idiot. No offense to them, but even the Mayor is a clown. I think it's just a really chill version of Earth. People just don't care about the Gems when they could be doing their own thing like steal collectible Guys, or trying to fit in with some cool kids. Of course, Ronaldo, just chooses to obsess over something close to the Gems, but hardly ever interacts with Steven's space family. Everyone's just in their own little world. Notice nobody really gave a shit until Peridot's arrival, and even then they're concern was short-lived  And as far as U.N, F.B.I, and the sorts, they're probably as goofy the rest of Beach City. Maybe one day they'll try to capture the Gems, maybe they'll succeed, but their incompetence is already apparent if they let them roam for two centuries.  tl;dr: Beach City is a small isolated town, people aren't the brightest (or they're extremely chill.) on this version of Earth, everyone is too wrapped up in their own world to care about the Gems unless it directly interferes with their life."
stevenuniverse,3e0oik,Arehandoro,2,Tue Jul 21 07:16:28 2015 UTC,I think Sugar mentioned in her AMA that the Government are aware of the Gems but have now just sort of accepted it's best to approach with caution and let them be.

stevenuniverse,3dwc8e,giraffe196,10,Tue Jul 21 02:21:44 2015 UTC,This does raise a question though.  Where would Lapis go when she finally escapes from Malachite and is friends with our baby gem again?  Would she just live in the ocean? Hang with the gems? Keep away from the gems? Work in Greg's carwash (she's make a great carwasher!)?
stevenuniverse,3dwc8e,Wasabi-beans,8,Mon Jul 20 07:00:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is why I'm kind of scared for her.  I mean, i don't think she'll exactly join the team, her relationship with the CGs isn't that good and she doesn't care for earth. So there's two solutions I could see Rebecca come up with: either, under the current circumstances, keep her busy with something else the way right now she's Malachite, or, well... You know... Sort of kill her off. Like, she's not a main character but we know enough about her to feel sad if she'd die. Knowing the show this wouldn't be too much of a stretch, and it's one of two logical ways I see things going, the other being temporary.   I really hope this won't happen, but I fear it will."
stevenuniverse,3dwc8e,Le_random_user,3,Mon Jul 20 08:50:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe she'll be Lapis Lazuli, the Water Witch!  Defender of the seas and scourge to all landlubbers!   Except Steven, whom she sees as an innocent little boy with a floaty donut tube thing around his belly."
stevenuniverse,3dwc8e,Wasabi-beans,6,Mon Jul 20 09:12:47 2015 UTC,"That's actually something I never thought about. The only problem is that she doesn't seem to like earth, and I don't think she'd stay here if she had the choice. Only she really has nowhere else to go. This is why she seems to me so perfectly set up to be the next one to go.  Although imagining a scene where she'd just live in the ocean and Steven would come visit her is just adorable. Heehee."
stevenuniverse,3dwc8e,Le_random_user,3,Mon Jul 20 12:46:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, I mean, she went back to homeworld and she was ""abused"" by homeworld, so I gues her trust in homeworld is a bit damaged and she may become a neutral to the (or join the) crystal gems, who knows...."
stevenuniverse,3dwc8e,Malthazar,4,Mon Jul 20 12:26:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but where would she go? She can't just be a background character like the Beach City residents. Joining the Crystal Gems would take a lot of building up trust, as Lapis seems very wary of them and almost seems to hate them. Plus, I don't see this show adding another member to the Crystal Gems, especially Lapis whom they don't exactly trust. I mean, they've been this way for thousands of years since the rebellion and are all sort of united by Rose Quartz and her decision to fight for earth, they all seemed to look up to her, not to mention the immense amount of time it took to build up trust between them, assuming they started off neutral towards each other. Lapis never knew Rose, we don't know her position in the war, but we do know she's not exactly friendly with the CGs.   Homeworld doesn't seem like an option either for Lapis, so unless she'll continue being trapped somewhere there's nowhere she can go. I don't really see her staying on earth if she had the choice, eg. At the bottom of the ocean by herself, she even called earth a ""miserable planet.""  So, there's only one logical decision left for her story to go. She's sort of secondary and has a generally traumatic story arc, it would fit in well with everything that has happened so far, though I'd be really sad if things were to turn out this way."
stevenuniverse,3dwc8e,Le_random_user,2,Mon Jul 20 12:43:44 2015 UTC,"wow... that was deep xD but yeah that could happen, but I secretly hope that Lapis becomes one of the crystal gems, or at least stays with steven and the crystal gems"

It's fetishistic/ism or exploitative. Most promotions of visible lesbianism are not respectful representations; they're typically a rating's grab or similarly downplayed because they're not considered sexually intimidating the way exploring male sexuality is.
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Emptymoleskine,4,Tue Jul 21 08:20:48 2015 UTC,I think that viewers would simply believe that fusion was a less 'love' related metaphor and would see all of the relationships as being about teamwork and cooperation.  Close male couples are a staple in fiction.  Without stopping to declare them 'gay' even pronouncements about Ruby and Sapphire's 'love' would be taken as a metaphor for agape or something.   I think if the genders were reversed people would never have bothered to ask questions about gender and relationships and sexuality because they would not have felt as 'challenged' at the onset.  So having a male Garnet suddenly talk about love in season two would strike people as religious metaphors until the kissing scene in Keystone Motel.  If the genders were reversed and it was 3 Jims and a Baby - you would be stunned at how long it would really take for anyone to even question the relationships between the 'Jims.'  Would Keystone Motel have been the shark jump moment?  Possibly.  But who knows.  There are a LOT more shows out there with all male characters dominating the action.  I think it would have gotten more support from the onset to be honest.
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,McDaioh,6,Tue Jul 21 00:30:29 2015 UTC,"I think if the genders were reversed people would never have bothered to ask questions about gender and relationships and sexuality because they would not have felt as 'challenged' at the onset.   My thoughts exactly. I'm going to sound like a nerd right now, but as someone who has watched A LOT of shounen anime, I can tell you that there would obviously be people who would ship the shit out of male CGs. Mostly by younger teenage girls. However, without Word of God confirmation, it would be assumed, even by the shippers, that the relationships were purely platonic.   The show probably would attract a much wider male audience. Despite the fact that I think the show appeals to everyone, some people still can't really wrap their heads around a show with a cast full of women not being a ""girl show"". From that standpoint, it would receive more...balanced support, I guess? You would have people who just watch the show for what it is, and then a group of people who watch for that Homoerotic Subtext™. Unfortunately, I think there are many people who shun the show as it is now just because it ""panders"" to PoC/the LGBT community. If it had an all-male cast and the messages of sexuality and gender were a little less overt, it would be on par with Adventure Time in terms of broad appeal and fandom."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Emptymoleskine,3,Tue Jul 21 01:16:44 2015 UTC,"i disagree, the show highlights the fact that the gems are sexually compatible with one another on multiple, pre-jailbreak occasions. the show would have never gotten off the ground or would have caused outrage because, as said above, visible gayness is less accepted than visible lesbianism."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Emptymoleskine,3,Tue Jul 21 00:56:32 2015 UTC,"Seriously, could you imagine the sugalite dance with men? People would have burned Rebecca Sugar's house down."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,ItsJustJoss,2,Tue Jul 21 01:07:23 2015 UTC,"I have to say - the reality does not actually agree.  Will & Grace was not a show that featured lesbian characters.  Lesbians are not really given the degree of acceptance that people think they are given.  Most 'lesbian' relationships in pop culture are thrown in to tease that a woman who will END UP being straight might be freaky enough to have been bisexual.  That is NOT the same as 'greater visibility' and it isn't the same as 'greater acceptance.'  Stoner Amethyst and super-hot Garnet would be coded as being kinda cool with how flamingly gay Pearl is.  In a gender swapped show -- there would be a HUGE love triangle ship set of for Getting Steven's 'mom' hooked up with the right Dad.  Garnet would be the obvious best Dad -- but stoner Amethyst would have actually shown himself to actually LIKE Gregette.  No amount of same-species affection would register with viewers for those two.  They would be revised in viewers heads as straight for Stephanie's mom.  Nothing Garnet says to Jamie-girl would change that.  Everyone would be writing 'yeah - Jamie, Garnet and GREGETTE 4EVER!'  A gender swapped Pearl would probably not be all that successful.  People would just love to hate him and no one would defend him because he would be so over the top.  Then again - a few rewrites and let Neil Patrick Harris have at it and you might have a breakout effeminate gay male super-hero character.  For all of Pearl's personal problems and drama and cleaning and screaming and mothering - she did kill a LOT of people and she is just enough of a badass to be kind of cool."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Emptymoleskine,2,Tue Jul 21 01:08:48 2015 UTC,"that seems reaching, this show is really really gay, people would be in positive denial to say that male-coded gems are just platonic."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Emptymoleskine,3,Tue Jul 21 01:38:07 2015 UTC,Yes. and the denial would still be in place at this stage of the show for every character except Pearl -- who would be clearly recognized as very gay -- and possible Ruby and Sapphire.  I think people would still consider Garnet and Amethyst and all the Homeworld Gems to be probably straight and not even challenging as potentially gay seeming characters.
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Emptymoleskine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:07 2015 UTC,"Will and Grace was a show for adults. Aired during what was considered a more mature time of the day. I think when we start to look at what representations have been perceived as acceptable to children, lesbian relationship are more likely to be excused as sisterly...remember that whole Ruby/Sapphire controversy about whether or not they were sisters and not lovers when jailbreak aired?"
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Emptymoleskine,4,Tue Jul 21 01:23:15 2015 UTC,"But there have been a LOT more 'gay men raising kids' coded stories than the opposite.   The ONLY complaint that lesbians are more accepted really reflects is in terms of kisses being used to get ratings.  When gay men complain that lesbians get more acceptance because women kissing has been accepted when men kissing has not -- they are ignoring that 'lesbian kisses' being used as a ratings stunt rather than actually having lesbian characters doesn't really count as representation.  While this is a true example where 'lesbian' presence has been greater -- it has almost ALWAYS been decoded as 'not really' and is not actual 'lesbian representation.'  Just women kissing.  From Jody in Soap to Will on Will and Grace - actual gay male characters have been prominent characters in TV for a long time.  Coded gay male characters are ABUNDANT in every level of entertainment.  Including kids shows.  I do think that Ruby and Sapphire would actually be considered to be 'not real people' in a gender swapped Stephanie Universe.  The one eye and their overall fire-anger, cold-emotion visuals would make people say they are 'just Garnet's emotions - not people' and this would be used as the excuse for why the 'gay' kiss isn't really gay.  In a gender swapped Stephanie's Universe, Pearl would be the only one seen as gay.  It would just be accepted that all other male Gems were uninterested in that sort of thing or looking for women among humans, etc.  Amethyst being ready to 'go there' to form Opal would have a very different 'Ame's just down with everything' vibe."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,doublebloom,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:50 2015 UTC,Admittingly I could see the uninterested in sex thing happening. Like with the all male race in dragon ball z.
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Emptymoleskine,2,Tue Jul 21 01:55:00 2015 UTC,I think Keystone Motel (if not Ruby and Sapphire's reunion in Jail Break) would definitely be the shark jump moment if they were male coded.
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,doublebloom,6,Tue Jul 21 00:34:28 2015 UTC,"Or people would think it was hilarious.  It might have been seen as the 'ohmigodHoYAY' episode that people would ask themselves if they had really watched.    Ruby's being masculine while shooting flames and burning stuff would be interpreted as 'just trying to distract us from how uncomfortably gay and effete Pearl is.'  [I'm rethinking my response here and adding a retraction.  The episode might actually have been hilarious, brave or awful.  I dunno.]  Considering how cool, badassed and well liked a Male Garnet who loved little Stephanie would be - the whole arc might be seen as an after-school special style 'very special' week about gay panic and internalized homophobia.  And it might even be seen as being an overtly 'safe' way to show someone flipping out over recieving attention from an obviously gay coded character due to a fear of being latently gay.  And the very special and reassuring message in the end is that 'ha ha of COURSE Garnet isn't GAY - no worries - he is so strong and manly.  But he WAS 'just gay enough' to briefly want to punch Pearl in the face for 'doing fusion wrong.'  [I am starting to think that a gender swapped Steven's Universe might actually have been pretty awesome.  But Pearl would probably get a LOT MORE hate as a Felix Unger type of character.  Everyone would ship Gregette with Garnet though.]"
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,doublebloom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:48:31 2015 UTC,"You could have said something similar if it weren't for the love letter episode that made it clear that the Garnet fusion was romantically based. Instead the anger would be Pearl's lesbianism ruining the ""sisterly love"" that ruby and sapphire had."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,doublebloom,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:41 2015 UTC,I think that in a genderbent world people would read Ruby and Sapphire as gay and Pearl as gay.  But they would be reading Garnet and Amethyst as straight and 'good dad' material for Stephanie's mom.  And they would definitely be called Stephanie's Gaylian Dads.  The lack of non Gem male representation would have been noted and complained about earlier that the unbalanced gender of Beach City was noted.  People would have FREAKED OUT over Pearl teaching Conner fencing.  That probably would have gotten the show canceled...
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,doublebloom,2,Tue Jul 21 01:20:54 2015 UTC,"representation   Lol could you imagine a male garnet saying ""three's a crowd""? And the whole garnet walking out of the ocean all sexy?"

Shows get cancelled for being too popular with female demographics all the time. Women as a demographic are already underrepresented/misrepresented in fiction, more so for gay women so I don't think that the gems being male would have impeded the show's success in the slightest. That's just myopic."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Sadi_Reddit,3,Tue Jul 21 01:07:40 2015 UTC,This is the truth.
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Sadi_Reddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:02:09 2015 UTC,"I dont think its myoptic to recognize that certain types of characters representations dont happen for specific demographics. For example, you are right about the fact that, in general, there are fewer female (gay or otherwise) representation in both adult and childrens shows. However, in childrens shows there have been quite a few lesbian-coded relationship because lesbian relationship can be easily written off as sisterly."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Emptymoleskine,5,Tue Jul 21 01:30:48 2015 UTC,"...Well writing off two lesbians as having a sisterly relationship is homophobic lol. And there are plenty of situations where two male characters are read as romantic by some viewers and read as brotherly by some others in other media. I think it's myopic to suggest that gay women (not fetishized, not sexualized for straight men's consumption) have an easier time existing in media than gay men. That's just ridiculous."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Emptymoleskine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:46:31 2015 UTC,"If you take sexualization out of the picture, then I think your argument is valid and a fairly good point. But the fusion dances have been sexualized. Alot."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,miradasuelle,4,Tue Jul 21 01:50:14 2015 UTC,"Not really. Dancing is dancing. You might be conditioned to look at the movements and call it sexual but it's not. Fusion isn't sex, isn't an allegory for sex, doesn't resemble sex. I HATE that shallow interpretation of fusion. Intimacy takes many forms! Sex is not the paramount form of intimacy! Aside from any of that, you've seen how Ruby and Sapphire fuse. All they do is hug. They don't even have a dance. Steven and Connie fuse too and I highly doubt we're supposed to get the impression that they had metaphorical sex. This is a kids show no matter how much those of us who aren't kids enjoy it."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,McDaioh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:06:55 2015 UTC,Thata my point. Fusion isn't suppose to be sexual but it has been sexualized by the mainstream when even a hint of lesbianism was suggested. You are absolutely right that fusion is only suppose to be a simple representation of a variety of relationships.
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Militron,4,Tue Jul 21 02:16:17 2015 UTC,"Well that's because lesbians are hypersexualized. Which gives the /illusion/ that they have an easier time being visible in mainstream media, but being fetishized is not being represented!"
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,addisonavenue,2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:28 2015 UTC,That is a good point. It would be like saying Africans had better representation in the past than other minorities because blackface existed.
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Aemort,2,Tue Jul 21 02:32:22 2015 UTC,Well it would be like saying bad representation is satisfactory. I wouldn't compare it to blackface because anti-black racism and blackface are not a thing of the past in any capacity.
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,Emptymoleskine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:36:33 2015 UTC,No.  You are now jumping from blackface to 'blacksploitation' as concepts.  Blackface is when a white actor paints his face and that can not be fairly considered to be 'representation' on any level.    The B-'exploitation' movie level of representation has more validity when being accepted or dismissed as anti-black or racist because it played to stereotypes but at least employed black talent.     When talking about gay representation both of these concepts fail to make sense because gays and lesbians have been able to 'hide in plain view' in entertainment.  Having a straight actor play a gay character doesn't discount the character's gayness or delete the representation.  Having the CHARACTER suddenly revised and revealed as 'totally-hot and hetero' is what invalidates the 'sweeps-lesbian kiss' from counting as 'greater acceptance for lesbian representation.'

stevenuniverse,3e0egr,nhs325,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:06:03 2015 UTC,"This.  Also when they want to sexualize a female they might show her having had a girlfriend in the past, etc.    Steven Universe REALLY broke new ground with the Pearl and Rose sexy fusion flashback scene.  We've seen the scene metaphorically before: straight male woos sexy hot woman who even had a girlfriend once.  What we HAVEN'T seen in mainstream media is the GIRLFRIEND being the character who isn't disposable.    The fact that Pearl is closer to being a protagonist for the show overall over Greg or Rose made that sexy fusion dance scene a first.  Because the 'lesbian eye candy' has always been a stunt rather than a character in the past.  Being used for a ratings bump isn't the same as representation."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,farllen,3,Tue Jul 21 13:05:10 2015 UTC,"Also - you have to realize a gender-swapped Steven Universe would be about a little girl.  It would be a girl's show.  All of the 'gay' stuff would be probably seen as making fun of the male-super-hero genre, etc."
stevenuniverse,3e0egr,addisonavenue,4,Tue Jul 21 02:15:31 2015 UTC,I for myself can say I would not enjoy it as much with all the genders reversed. For example Greg would be Stevens Mom and the Dad would be missing. A single Dad gets more sympathy than a single Mom. etc...

stevenuniverse,3e1eth,DeebsTheRed,3,Tue Jul 21 05:28:53 2015 UTC,"3 that come to my mind are:  Bubble Buddies, Serious Steven, Lars and the Cool Kids.  After that, you can start back at episode one, as many things from the early episodes do come around later in the season. I would also mention that this show probably (at least in my opinion) does a better job at being a collective experience rather than an episode-to-episode show. Essentially, the show is greater than the sum of its parts (and to understand that is to watch it all)."
stevenuniverse,3e1eth,TheRandomCities4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:40:26 2015 UTC,"That is perfect selection, thank you so much! It hits on all the major parts of the show.

stevenuniverse,3e1eth,johnwharris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:58:09 2015 UTC,"The thing is, most of these episodes I wouldn't put in the top third.  I think people need to be shown a stand-out episode as their first or you risk them thinking this Steven Universe thing isn't anything special.  But also, you don't want to give too much away!  The maximum impact of something like On The Run or Rose's Scabbard will only be felt once you know the characters really well, which demands watching some ""normal"" episodes first.  In that sense the show is set up really well, because most of the first half of the first season are ""normal"" episodes, just Steven interacting with the Gems and the boardies.  There are things, when you're telling a story, that are much better shown than told.  The key relationships in Steven Universe are all like that, particularly how much the Gems love Steven and vice versa.  Note: <i>the Gems have never said ""I love you Steven,""</i> but you still know they do.  That's a thing that only watching a number of early episodes will demonstrate."
stevenuniverse,3e1eth,Scalpels,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:06:29 2015 UTC,"I suggested these five earlier today. I still stand by them. Picking which two to drop would depend on the type of person you're showing them to.   S01E02: Laser Light Cannon. It introduces the Gems and Greg pretty well. Plus you get a hint of Rose. The actiony bit near the end is good. S01E07: Bubble Buddies. Introduction of Connie who becomes important later. Plus this is a good introduction to Gem monsters. S01E08: Serious Steven. This one is a good taste of the Lore and raises lots of questions that have yet to be answered. S01E09: Tiger Millionaire. A good humorous episode with a good introduction of Amethyst's issues without being too heavy. S01E12: Giant Woman. Interpersonal conflict, catchy song, great finish, aaaaand it introduces fusion."
stevenuniverse,3e1eth,johnwharris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:56:11 2015 UTC,"Laser Light Cannon's a good one.  I actually think Serious Steven isn't a great intro because so many things shown in it look like throwaway details, just background dressing.  It's only later that you realize that very little in Steven Universe is really thrown away, that nearly everything has a reason."
stevenuniverse,3e1eth,johnwharris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:17:11 2015 UTC,"I made a big post about this a couple of weeks ago, I'll just link that rather than fill the thread with essentially the same thoughts all over again.  Summary: Early episodes can turn off a new viewer expecting just another Cartoon Network show, but are ultimately crucial to see.  It's generally okay to see out of order, but there are some plot threads that suggest certain episodes be seen before certain others.  (Like, Lion 2 before Rose's Scabbard.)"

Now, you can get around these limits - by layering sprites, or by JIT background modification (e.g., copy the negative areas of the sprite to a background tile, and set the background tile behind the sprite appropriately) - but doing so limits other things, consumes memory, and eats up precious cycles.  Hell; if you're willing to do pixel tricks, you can do some wacky shit."

The Gems technically do not have any ""inherent"" gender, so they identify whatever way they prefer, and gems in general seem to prefer to skew towards ""feminine"" traits, although ""feminine"" and ""masculine"" are most likely not terms gems even use in the first place."

Since the gems are genderless, they decide to appear as feminine by human standards. But at the end of the day there is no boy or girl with them, just gems and pronouns.   Ruby and Jasper are the most masculine in comparison to everyone and the fusions. Pearl and Sardonyx can pass for genderfluid/androgynous."

For Acts 1-5 I would have considered it one of the greatest works the internet ever produced, but then Act 6 came along and shit all over everything. Despite my bitching though, I'd give it a shot.

Not to mention the only time she ever tried to kill the Gems is when she explicitly told them to leave her alone and they did not. Not to mention I think she does care about Steven's well being but doesn't understand that certain things will physically hurt him. She sees he has a gem and a weapon so I'm sure she didn't know that leaving him on the water tower would be dangerous.  She's been trapped in a mirror for thousands of years and knew him for one day.

Rose didn't need any protection from Pearl and would have been actively hindered by the sudden need to protect Pearl after she gets herself poofed for the umpteenth time. Steven didn't need protection from Jasper; Garnet had already beaten her. All Lapis had to do was say 'no'.

She's childish and has no sense of social etiquette. Rather than talk to people she prefers to simply express whatever emotion she is feeling on the surface.  Lapis has done bad things, but has attempted to reconcile. She put the ocean back when Steven healed her, she thanked him for being the one person who actually listened.  We don't fully know Lapis's story. The fact that she was bubbled for thousands of years and forgotten has led her to understandably feel resentment. She is fond of Steven, expressing a desire to continue fighting Jasper at the cost of her own freedom and life (""Let me do this for you"").  Ruby is simply the personification of the id.

All of the other fusions seemed to be good meshes and then suddenly we get a freaking magician. Like none of Sardonyx's components have anything close to a tuxedo, why the heck is she wearing a tuxedo?"
stevenuniverse,3dy0cm,Themeguy,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"this isnt mine its /u/ParanormalInstigator   So, as we take a step back from this latest Steven Bomb, a lot more can be made clear about the nature of Garnet and Pearl's relationship than could be previously understood. We knew Pearl clung to Garnet for strength before this, and we knew Garnet seems to project a too-cool-to-care attitude, but her reason for it was hard to determine. Now with Friend Ship in the rear view mirror the nature of their relationship becomes much more clear: it was built of mutual deception. While Pearl's deception is brought more directly into the light by her act of sabotage to form Sardonyx, it is just a part of a pattern. Pearl projects an air of team spirit while really feeling little worth for herself and really acts in her own self-interest in order to fulfill her fundamental craving for approval. The approval she uses to pump up her constantly deflating sense of self-worth. Garnet's deception is less obvious but becomes clear when you examine her discussion with Pearl. She is less strong than she lets on. She feels inner turmoil but she hides it not because she is too cool to let it bother her -- but instead because she does not trust her teammates to be able to see her as vulnerable without breaking down themselves. Whether or not this assessment is true is irrelevant: it is a deception, a facade, a face. The relationship was built of deception. And remember, fusions are just representations of relationships. This is why Sardonyx loses her third eye, second sight is supposed to pierce through deception, but the deception is mutual, so the third eye must be lost and symbolically blinded. This is also why Sardonyx is a magician: her relationship is entirely an illusion, as much a sleight of hand as any magic trick. The sense of self-worth and self-indulgence is just an act, a play, a show. She's the ultimate magician, because she herself is the trick. Now you see her, now you don't, and it was all sleight of hand the whole time. Sardonyx returns after the deception has been shed, but her boisterousness is gone. The illusion still exists, but it is waning and being replaced by something more significant: understanding."

In Keystone Motel this trend continues, with her stomping off to boil the pool, and then destroying everyone's breakfast in the diner.  The only reason people love her is because she's gay.   As much as I love representation and such, I think this sub is a little shortsighted when it comes to liking/disliking characters.

She also shows that she really cares about Sapphire and Steven by immediately swallowing that anger when she realizes she's hurt them. She also shows that she can be a smooth-talking charmer when she wants to be.

stevenuniverse,3dy0cm,Silrain,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:20 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind that these are just the reasons I know off the top of my head, these may be stupid and there may be more..  Steven Universe so far has stayed very faithful to gemmology and science as well, so for Rose to be pink diamond; A: she would have had to have lied to every one or B: The Diamonds are just a title, which implys there aren't any actual diamond gems, and I don't buy either of these explanations. (To be honest this is my main gripe with the whole theory).  Another point of information is the difference in power level. Jasper seemed to think she could ""beat"" Rose into the ground (not stab with the destabiliser, but physically overcome), while Peridot and Lapis seemed to be more afraid of yellow diamond than they where of Jasper, and although there could be a hundred explanations for this (such as the homeworld gems not knowing Rose, or gems not actually choosing their leaders based on strength, despite all the evidence we have with that they do) I think its more likely that Rose just isn't on the level of the diamonds.  The way the fandom came up with the theory seems silly too me also. I think there is a diamond authority, with white, blue, yellow and pink members but other than that there's nothing remotely solid to suggest that Rose is the Pink Diamond. People looked at the fresco in ""Serious Steven"" and labelled each of the gems presented as different diamonds, even though they have what looks like the same gem in multiple panels and this show often uses colour in weird symbolic and unrealistic ways. In ""Sworn to the sword"" we see statues of all three remaining diamonds, while the fourth is destroyed. No this could be either that they're trying to hide Pink diamond's true identity, or it could just be really subtle story telling to show that Pink Diamond has been destroyed, and considering there's also two diamond-authority symbols with the Pink shattered and broken, I think it's the later."
stevenuniverse,3dy0cm,detroitmatt,4,Mon Jul 20 18:49:15 2015 UTC,"Rose would not have to have lied to everyone. The gems (and possibly Greg if he understands the significance of the Diamonds) would have just had not to tell Steven. Which considering they didn't even tell him they were aliens until Space Race at the earliest, and didn't fully explain the nature of the gems until the season 1 finale, is perfectly plausible."
stevenuniverse,3dy0cm,Silrain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:08:20 2015 UTC,"But Jasper also called her Rose Quartz multiple times, whichever way you spin it it's incredibly unlikely she's belongs to the diamond species of gem."
stevenuniverse,3dy0cm,detroitmatt,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"Pink Diamond leaves the diamonds and starts calling herself Rose Quartz. Jasper has respect for her as a general, and on top of that would probably not call her Pink Diamond, which would seem to me disloyal to Yellow, Blue, and White, so out of respect for Rose's tactics and of loyalty to the Yellow Diamond, Jasper (and probably the rest of Homeworld) call this traitor Rose Quartz. Makes complete sense."
stevenuniverse,3dy0cm,Silrain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:23:47 2015 UTC,"Yes it makes sense, but now you've made overly complex and it doesn't stand up to Occum's Razor."

stevenuniverse,3dy0cm,Silrain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:16 2015 UTC,"Garnet being a fusion would have also failed Occam's Razor by your criteria.   Nope, it was the most simple explanation that fit all the criteria.... Sorry I was trying to use the classical meaning of ""Occum's Razor"".   What simpler explanation is there for the evidence we've seen?   Rose not being Pink Diamond. One of the pieces of evidence that people seem to miss is that several of the Diamond insignias in ""sworn to the sword"" have the pink shattered, indicating that Pink Diamond was destroyed out right, not just changed.  Also BTW I meant that making up a complex reason Jasper calls her Rose is failing occum's razor, not just everyone lying to Steven.  Also can I just point out that on one level the crewneverse has to simplify their plots for young children, and often remind them of plots like the gem war in ""The Return"" and Lapis in ""The Message"". IMO Rose being P Diamond would be too attention taxxing with no definite emotional payoff.  Also Rose lying about her identity discounts the story of them trying to change what it means to be a gem in the context of earth. They go from invaders to protectors, and Rose instead of trying to change what it means to be a diamond/gem royalty simply lies about who she is (to Steven, someone who doesn't even know what it originally meant to be a diamond)?"
stevenuniverse,3dy0cm,detroitmatt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:00:50 2015 UTC,"I think Garnet not being a fusion is simpler than Garnet being a fusion. The insignias were smashed because they were the symbol of a traitor. I think if pink diamond had just died, it would be less likely they would smash her insignia. They would probably stop using it on new ones but keep it on old ones as memorial. When a person dies we don't destroy all traces of them.  I think rose turning her back no good world means more because she had more to lose. Again, she may not have even lied to the cgs, the cgs just haven't told Steven.  Occam's razor is ""all other things being equal, pick the simplest explanation"", not ""if there's a good alibi, it's not that one because an alibi is complicated."""

stevenuniverse,3dy0cm,Silrain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:24 2015 UTC,"That doesn't have to mean that Rose is the pink diamond though, that just means the real pink diamond would have had to die in between before the rebellion and the current day."

Jasper is literally headstrong, but she's also very animalistic and predatory thus the focus on her nose.  Lapis has no trust in her own abilities; she literally can't see her powers, so one could say she suffers from backwards thinking. She's also a character who had clearly been betrayed at some point.

stevenuniverse,3dz13c,Militron,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"I think Amethyst's is fine representing her heart, and as for Rose, maybe the gem being on her stomach has some relation to her being destined to bear a child or something.  For Lapis, it could represent her desire for someone to have her back? Someone whom she can depend on and who can depend on her (this person she found in Steven). As for Jasper, that's a tough one.  The best I could think of relates to the expression of ""turning your nose up at something/someone"", which can mean ""to not like something because you think it is not good enough for you"". Probably not, but I can't think of anything else for her."

stevenuniverse,3dysvx,nixlheimr,5,Mon Jul 20 17:11:48 2015 UTC,"That sort of thing happens a lot. Shows are cut to fit in with the audience. SU is a PG rating in America, which means its for an older child audience which lets it get in quite a few things you wouldn't normally expect.  Other stations buying in shows may buy it in for a lower audience. As its a cartoon you would assume it's for a younger age range, and so it would be cut accordingly. It's less about countries, more about what station buys it and what age they are aiming it at. It wouldn't be impossible for another channel to pick up SU and recut it if they decide it should be aimed at say, the 6-10 age range, for example.  Most famously, Australia bought Doctor Who as a show for children (as opposed to the 'for families' basically PG rating it had in the UK), and so ended up cutting tons out of it, and ironically the Australian censor clips are all that survives of some 60s stories!"
stevenuniverse,3dysvx,MatttheM,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm, Australia seems to be notorious for cutting up shows. I read somewhere before that the Australian version of Adventure Time also had a lot of stuff cut out, even with the PG rating (we have almost the same version here).

stevenuniverse,3duftx,Rabid-Duck-King,29,Mon Jul 20 03:27:27 2015 UTC,If someone can make this with crazyface legless Peridot and dream Lapis with her eyes leaking  I will be grateful forever
stevenuniverse,3duftx,Deramor,11,Sun Jul 19 18:33:32 2015 UTC,That would be a heck of a Steven dream. Cute Lapidot picnic but then Peri disassembles explosively and Lapis starts crying out of her pores.
stevenuniverse,3duftx,poktanju,29,Sun Jul 19 19:07:31 2015 UTC,"Ok. It was a pain in the gem, but I found the original. I know there's a watermark and all, but a link is still not that hard to track down. Under normal circumstances, it shouldn't have taken any longer than the time it took to reupload it to imgur. That said, Beauty Snake doesn't have a ""next page"" button, and so I had to manually enter the URL for every page on her tumblr to check for it and she posts all the time and I just had to keep doing that until I gave up and tried reverse image-searching it, and I found it... via pinterest.  In short: Please don't reupload to imgur. Just link directly to the artist. Unless the artist is Beauty Snake, in which case I completely understand"
stevenuniverse,3duftx,StenDarker,7,Sun Jul 19 19:55:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry i did not link to the original. I thought Imgur was the preffered website to use for gifs/pictures. Considering there was a watermark i thought it would be okay. Good on you for linking the original though, and thanks for not throwing a tantrum :]  (pst, beautysnake does have a next page button at the bottom of the site!)"
stevenuniverse,3duftx,StenDarker,9,Sun Jul 19 19:58:39 2015 UTC,"...and there it is! I swear that didn't load before...  Anyway, gifs work just as well on Tumblr as they do anywhere else for most of us. Besides, Lapisbot will put it on imgur anyway if anyone needs it. With the water mark, there's proper attribution, so it isn't really a problem. Just a matter of convenience. I know I'm more likely to follow someone on tumblr if I can just click on a link instead of typing it out. Better for artists. Better for lazy people like me."
stevenuniverse,3duftx,EliteMasterEric,4,Sun Jul 19 20:17:28 2015 UTC,I want a plugin like RES has to disable subreddit style but for Tumblr I hate the ones that have annoying music or no back button and it would make me so happy.

stevenuniverse,3dwemt,Pigeon_Barf,8,Mon Jul 20 02:24:14 2015 UTC,"Oh aye: Steven Universe is just a great, great show for kids and adults.  Steven breaks away from traditional gender roles, not in a dismissive rejection but rather acceptance of his true strengths as a healer and peacemaker.  What's more, people of all walks of life, races, genders, and sexualities seem to show up in the world of Steven Universe, and while these things are not ignored they are not the sole focus of the character.  Garnet is technically two very small female-pronoun-using characters in love, and that's a huge part of her. She's also a caretaker and a leader who has spent many years trying to remain apart in order to project strength, having to come to terms with allowing herself to be vulnerable so that she and all the Crystal Gems can grow and become stronger.  Greg is an old ex-rocker who ended up running a car wash and lives in his van, yet his love for Steven is undeniable.  Over the years he managed to instill some truly great values in the kid, and he's always been willing to risk himself in the face of strange and terrifying dangers for Steven.  Vidalia is a mother whose husband is constantly absent, with two kids by two separate fathers both equally difficult in different ways.  She's not judged for these things, but rather is able to inspire and aid her immortal magical friend due to the strength, humor and relative grace with which she handles her situation.  In short, this is a children's show that really does seem to show people from very different backgrounds, with very different lives and situations coming together and learning to respect one another.  What's more, it's not done in a cutesy, unbelievable manner but actually includes much of the friction you would expect from real people.  All aided by Steven, a character with the immensely remarkable ability to empathize with and try to help even his greatest enemies (literally, as he even seemed worried when Peridot was possibly hurt)."
stevenuniverse,3dwemt,Zammin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:17:47 2015 UTC,"You know, your description of this show makes me realize that I think it's a lot like the old Teen Titans to me: A ""kid's show""  that might be about action, but mainly focuses on the interpersonal dynamics of a team of people brought together from different backgrounds.  Teen Titans certainly is not as revolutionary in its portrayal of relationships, but I used to like how conversations in it often felt genuine in how many episodes stress the importance of opening up to one another in some form."

stevenuniverse,3dwemt,Taco_Cannon,0,Mon Jul 20 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"The show may have some feminist themes, but the show never adresses them. None of the characters talk about it. It's not remotely explored by the story. Hell, look at the origional post, 7th image. ""Hetero- and Cis-normative gender roles"". When does the show actually look into that buzzword laden crap? Never, that's when."
stevenuniverse,3dwemt,Taco_Cannon,3,Mon Jul 20 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"You're right that the show never mentions these themes, but they still have a theme that's important.  Nutritious foods never directly show you their nutrient content but they are there.  And precise names are needed for these nutrients in order to be accurate, much like the same way a categorization of genders, their meanings, and their positions in society make sense."
stevenuniverse,3dwemt,TheMightyBarbarian,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:28:28 2015 UTC,"Nutrition and chemicals are a hard science, feminism is not. The scientists are the experts when it comes to nutrition, feminists are just another voice in the fray when it comes to gender, everyone has their beliefs, and there's almost no provable right answer. It warrants discussion, but maybe a little more separated from media like Steven Universe."

Hundreds of monsters becoming, um, persons, Gems everywhere, in all colors and sizes, crying from happiness, hugging each other, then repairing the ship and returning to Homeworld to overthrow the government and stop their plans to predate on planets filled with life.  I got kinda sappy here, but wouldn't it be beautiful?

stevenuniverse,3dxe2x,sushiitaco,8,Mon Jul 20 09:29:02 2015 UTC,"I would feel really mixed. Like it's very bittersweet. I was thinking that the show should end more like Steven growing up years after whatever events take place (I think it will extend further than simply defeating Yellow Diamond since there are probably other higher ranking members and the end result of the show connects homeworld gems with earth rather than making them stay away and then rebuilding gem culture) and his life and however he ended up rather than Rose basically dying. I mean, I think your ending is great tbh but it's...a kid's show. I feel like they wouldn't leave the last scene to a birth/death."

stevenuniverse,3dwfhd,scaredog20,3,Mon Jul 20 03:19:21 2015 UTC,Sapphire can't become numb to her friend's dying.

Despite her stoic demeanor she always worries about her friends and is determined to keep them safe

No microtransactions or anything, buy the game and you get a full well-made game which constantly changes, lots of upgrades, lots of challenges, lots of enemies and some really awesome settings.  Music could've been better I guess, but it was still good for a mobile game."
stevenuniverse,3e02ra,Emc73,3,Mon Jul 20 22:43:57 2015 UTC,It's basically a Mario & Luigi style RPG. It's definitely worth more than the measly three bucks they charge for it.

The only reason why the gems couldn't catch her yet is that she is also very lucky. I love her.  And she is so loved because she is very entertaining to watch, so in the end that outweighs the bad things she did in the minds of her fans (like me).  Also there is the fact that we don't know if she was actually involved with the fusion experiments or just collecting some data about them under someone else's orders. And yes, she tried to kill the Crystal Gems, but let's keep in mind that they tracked her down and attacked her. Peridot didn't go after them."

stevenuniverse,3e025i,Scalpels,3,Mon Jul 20 23:50:11 2015 UTC,"She's entertaining and fun, unlike jasper, who is kinda... normal. She's a typical villain, Jasper. Looks down on everyone, is hypocritical in order to achieve the power she needs to defeat her enemies, etc etc. Peridot is fun, interesting, and very different from the average villain.

stevenuniverse,3e025i,DrCaesars_Palace_MD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:37 2015 UTC,I wonder what the crewniverse will do with Jasper if she is ever unfused from Malachite. I don't think they'll leave her as such a default villain after an experience like that.  Remember that Pearl could feel the bond that Ruby & Sapphire have when they were fused. Perhaps Jasper can feel Lapis's loneliness and pain.
stevenuniverse,3e025i,Scalpels,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:18:39 2015 UTC,I think it's safe to say from Chille Tid that at least for now Jasper does not feel even the slightest amount of sympathy for Steven or Lapis.

But they didn't, for some reason, so they have to go the route of making the Crystal Gems turn into idiots who forget about their own powers every time she slowly hovers away on her ridiculous helicopter fingers.

The good way to write that in is to either make the difficulty in locating her rather than catching her once they've found her, or give her an ability that makes it plausible for her to keep escaping. The lazy way is to make the Crystal Gems get suddenly stupid in her presence."
stevenuniverse,3e025i,ACoolSkeleton,2,Tue Jul 21 00:40:27 2015 UTC,"I think she adds a little comic relief into serious episodes.

Pearl just needed the most development to get into that state, and Garnet needed some help learning how to correctly deal with these situations.

stevenuniverse,3dyn8b,Emc73,3,Mon Jul 20 16:45:17 2015 UTC,I hope/it's implied that she might move into finding validation from within and learn to consider other peoples feelings and reactions to a higher degree.

I have seen it used a lot lately, is it just a phrase people have coined for a rapid release of 1 episode / day for a few days in a row?  For actual on topic: I think it was all just to show that Pearl has serious gem-related conflicts surrounding her self-doubt of ability in fighting, also possibly some sort of theory that she isn't a crystal gem? A pearl isn't really a gem (by comparison, not like the rest at least) I've always wondered if they would ever go into that. Sugar could have just called her diamond and sort of achieved the same sort of ""look and feel"" to pearl. Or even just quartz."

Granted, with the latter, we'd be beating a dead horse."
stevenuniverse,3dyn8b,TheStorm117,2,Mon Jul 20 16:44:41 2015 UTC,I think Steven learned more about the root of Pearl's instability.  (She really isn't 'cut out' for a life of isolation and warfare.  She doesn't just miss her people and long for Rose's guidance -- she feels misplaced.)  The only thing that really changed for Pearl was that.  That and the discovering that just 'getting fused' didn't only fail to undo her anxiety and tension -- it pushed her over the edge.  Amethyst developed a LOT.  Garnet was shown to be refusing to adjust to her status as the teams leader. The speed with which Pearl messed with Ruby and Sapphire's agreement indicates that Garnet's need for social isolation and an introvert's down time are a requirement for protecting their relationship.  While this wont interfere with her being a mentor to Steven and a visionary alpha warrior for the team -- it does make her need to be socially withdrawn and even inattentive of others reasonable.  She really should be allowed to step down as the team leader.  Even Amethyst could come up with priorities and team goals and stick to them better than Garnet.

There seem to be fixed locations within it that are connected physically (as seen in Together Breakfast) and via more esoteric paths (like the pools seen in Secret Team). There also seem to be more dynamic spaces, like the room we saw in The Test which the Gems reconfigured for Steven. It's unclear whether or not that space always existed.  It's safe to assume that every combination of Gems has a room associated with it, though some of those rooms may be ""empty"". Perhaps it's only when a room is frequently used that it becomes ""fixed"", and connects to the rest of the temple. Ruby and Sapphire's rooms may have drifted away through disuse."

stevenuniverse,3dxtai,Wasabi-beans,18,Mon Jul 20 12:31:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty obvious. Gravity Falls has had a four month hiatus where everything has been discussed to death. There's been one new ep which while exciting, didn't add THAT much to discussion.  SU meanwhile has had a TON of new eps that have introduced a ton of new lore and characters and interesting theories.  Really, the solution to the gravityfalls subreddit is uh, more official content."
stevenuniverse,3dxtai,MatttheM,3,Mon Jul 20 12:49:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of people are just now getting into SU so there is a lot of excitement for the new people. Also the Bomb format kind of frontloads everything, if GF gets an episode every week and we have to grind out a 5 week hiatus things might even out."
stevenuniverse,3dxtai,Triximancer,2,Mon Jul 20 12:40:47 2015 UTC,"For starters, I think the fact that we are hot off a Steven Bomb helps a lot.  Gravity Falls, for all its amazingness, isn't really in a good place with regards to air dates atm.  I think another thing to consider is that while both shows are incredible stories that inspire lots of speculation and fan work, they each inspire different kinds of speculation (fan work's pretty consistently good in both but that's probably not what you meant).  We know there are secrets in Gravity Falls, and we know that these secrets are foreshadowed in codes, shown in single frames, and teased in the background, so people comb through the episodes and catch a ton of the hints (Hirsch indicated that the author had to be revealed early because half the internet knew by the end of the first season).  But at the same time, I think Gravity Falls' particular method of story telling puts it a a disadvantage when it comes to speculation.    The first reason is that, aside from Bill, all of the main characters are human.  We know there's an element of unreality that's looming over our heads, but it's not as present as it is in Steven Universe, and so the teases tend to be more significant than say, making people wonder why Amethyst likes motor-oil sandwiches.  With a detail like that, your guess is as good as mine as to whether they put it in because it's good character development, whether it says something about the gems as a whole, or just for a quick laugh.    The second is that, while Gravity Falls had the Author of the Journal and Bill for people to speculate over, Steven Universe has Lapis, Peridot, Jasper, Yellow Diamond (and the diamond authority) and all the corrupted gems.  We know less about each of them than either Bill or the Author, especially post Tale-of-Two-Stans, and each has some really important details about both their past and their present that everyone wants to know about.  That results in more mysterious characters overall, giving the fans more room to speculate on each of them, and more leeway to do so, since we have less evidence to disprove the more hair brained hypotheses.    Anyway, that might not be the reason, but that's my personal best guess.  Good luck!"
stevenuniverse,3dxtai,BlueRoanoke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:44:40 2015 UTC,"something that occurred to me with regards to the difference between speculation (pre author knowledge) in GF vs SU is that the shows reveal in opposite directions.  In GF, we tend to learn about what things or people do (the author, the portal, etc) before we learn what they are, which means the mysterious part tends to be what or who is doing this thing.  In SU, the first thing we learned about each character was their name, but we are still learning what Peridot can do with her robot hands, for example, so the speculation is more on who the characters are."

stevenuniverse,3dxtai,Chezzymann,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"Some aspects of SU actually thrive better when there is a lull.  Fan driven Peridot builds on itself when given the chance. It is as if SU has left some of its toys out before retiring - and the fans get to play with them, especially Peridot, until the show comes back.  I suspect that Gravity Falls theories are most fun to unpack after an episode.  So the energy would peak right after a good episode. For Peridot, Jaspis and the whole AU Homeworld Gem thing - the longer we have between seeing them on the show the more freedom fans have to develop their own thing."

She waited for Pearl to snap at her for being obnoxious, but the other Gem remained still and silent, lost in her own little world.    They came down in a burst of light. Amethyst looked up to Pearl, but her grave expression didn't disappear as they landed. Amethyst turned to look. Her body stiffened. She'd been told about it, of course.

Landing zone 4, or LZ4 as it will be called, was still receiving supply ships when the insurgency of Rose Quartz was well underway. Still not ready for early kindergarten deployment a massive detachment of anti-homeworld forces were approaching. Lacking military support from command and the already diminishing interest of The Diamond Authority only a few squadrons of gem skirmishers were sent to protect the assists of LZ4. Although LZ4 had promising regions of possible Gem production only a few insemination drills were sent out for testing. With insurgent forces on the move and only a handful of reinforcements, the Gem commander made a risky decision.   With a few drills gone for testing in the mountains around LZ4, Commander Pyrope ordered that the drills not yet allocated be driven straight in the ground around base camp, effectively creating a solid, albeit porous, defense against Insurgent forces. Not even as the last drill finished laying its foundation the attack commenced.  Over the hilltops and peaks the insurgents advanced, led by fusions of all different colors and strengths. Even as the fusions dismantled and cast the drills into the sea, commander pyrope stood her ground and ordered her troops to defend at all costs. Fervently the pearl and peridot engineers called for help to the high command, but the risk of losing established kindergarten bases in landing zones 3, 5, and 8, were to great and refused any requests of reinforcements.   What then happened was astonishing even to the few who survived to escape to homeworld. Commander pyrope surrendered and conceded to lieutenant Obsidian the largest and most powerful of the fusions sparing the lives of many gems, for a moment. Pyrope then asked for Obsidian's hand in forgiveness, which was granted in mercy, as was the doctrine of rose quartz if an enemy surrendered. Pyrope then thrust her self onto Obsidian, twisting and convulsing, and in the confusion pyrope willed her self to fuse with obsidian.   The result of this fusion was unimaginable, a twisted monstrosity that blackened the sky with its size. The fusion, unnamed as of yet by gem theorists, used its immense power to flatten the ground around it with an energy blast. Thousands upon thousands of gems laid dormant or shattered at the epicenter of the blast, which stretched for miles around the blast. The few gems on the outskirts still fighting were rumored to grip each other and protect even enemies from the great explosion. Those who survived ceased fire and went there separate ways after see the twinkling sea of gems that lay before them.   Reports state that Capital ships tracked Pyrope and still maintain that Pyrope was still intact but dormant in some unsettled lands between LZ3 and LZ8.   Recent reports from resettlement expeditions say that pyrope is active but unable to achieve physical projection. Peridot #54 has been sent to investigate."

The personality of a fusion is primarily based on the personality of the constituent gems, but the mood of the fusion is dependent on the emotions and reasoning behind the fusion, and the current mood/emotional state of the constituent gems.  We've seen that to some extent, the personalities of the constituent gems remain as distinct aspects of the fusion.  These get expressed when the constituent gems have a different emotional response to stimuli.  But before they defuse, we see that this alters the fusion's behavior -- that is to say, the emotional state of the constituent gems affects the fusion even while they're still fused."

stevenuniverse,3dtyoz,robbiebojangles,4,Sun Jul 19 14:44:10 2015 UTC,"Steven gets along with all of them, though. Whenever he sees any one of them needs a bit of Steven-time he figures out what to do for them. Also I really loved his voice during this moment. ""That's when we'll get her."""
stevenuniverse,3dtyoz,fennric,5,Sun Jul 19 15:07:20 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, they all definitely get along with Steven! But these two are a fair bit closer in age. More of the kids of the team... although Amethyst seemed more like a mum to him in Onion Friend."
stevenuniverse,3dtyoz,robbiebojangles,3,Sun Jul 19 15:14:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm, yeah I would agree that she is relatively closer in age to Steven but that's by like what, a couple thousand years? Not much parity there. That being said, Amethyst does represent the 'eternal child' trope/archetype so I can see where you're coming from there. I have this vision that the next big story arc will see the core group we've come to love be separated - I think Steven and Amethyst could really come into their own when and if that happens."

stevenuniverse,3dtjn3,TylerTheDragon,2,Sun Jul 19 19:01:27 2015 UTC,Back in the days when I liked My Little Pony I remember there being a sizable amount of the Japanese audience arguing that the dub wasn't as good as the English version. I was actually kind of surprised that those kind of arguments were still a thing over there.
stevenuniverse,3dtjn3,Fruitbat3,5,Mon Jul 20 00:04:04 2015 UTC,Japanese dubs probably have better voice acting than english dubs as the animation industry is so much bigger in japan   could be wrong though   thats my problem with English dubs though voice actors sound really forced and not very good a lot of the time some dubs are pretty legit though (my favorite being the k-on dub for this scene alone)
stevenuniverse,3dtjn3,Alexwolf117,18,Sun Jul 19 12:55:52 2015 UTC,"Subs are situational. I don't like having to be forced to constantly stare at the screen just to read dialogue. Also the Japanese language seems to use different inflections when they speak so it sounds like they're super angry even when they're talking normally sometimes. It's just very weird!   So for me it comes down to what I started watching the anime in since it is very hard to swap languages halfway through, and if the English dub is exceptional or not. If it is unbearably unprofessional sounding I just turn it on in Japanese.   It is kind of a generalization to call all dubs ""forced"" since many of them sound fine and more realistic than the high pitched rubber duck voices some animes give to their entire female cast."

But seriously, I'd be interested in seeing the changes and choices they made with the Japanese voices and translations.  Does anyone know where to find these episodes?  It sounds stupid when I say it like this, but ideally I'm looking for an English subtitled version of the Japanese dub... of a show that was originally in English.    When I see it typed out like that, I feel pretty stupid, but you get my point, right?  You understand my reasoning.  I... I'm not stupid or crazy.  I'm not."
stevenuniverse,3dtjn3,Rex_Ivan,3,Sun Jul 19 19:23:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, the most I can say about the Japanese dub is ""better than the other way around."" The lip syncing seems good, and the actors actually put in the effort. Even when the casting sounds off, the actors at least sound like they care."
