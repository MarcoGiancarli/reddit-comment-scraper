macdemarco,3e4xyb,Dancing_Shell,5,Wed Jul 22 00:05:49 2015 UTC,"This was an interesting interview to me! I like the freshness of it. Maybe I'm a pleb, but I haven't seen one where they talk about the future of post-Another One Mac. I'm excited that he wants to put out music rapidly like how artists did in the 70's. He's certainly up to par, and I'm excited for the future. He was the first new artist I gave a chance to, and I feel it was a great choice. Thanks for posting, OP!"
macdemarco,3e4xyb,MatteKudasai9,2,Wed Jul 22 03:15:25 2015 UTC,"You are not a pleb. Mac is refreshingly honest here. Like actually honest, not the bullshit response like ""Yeah its great, everythings just great."""
macdemarco,3e4xyb,Rumsquall,2,Wed Jul 22 03:31:44 2015 UTC,"Haha you're not a pleb. I agree, I hadn't seen/read an interview where Mac speaks more in-depth about his life/music post-Another One. Happy to know you're digging Mac and his music and it was my pleasure!"
macdemarco,3e4xyb,fatso_2000,-2,Wed Jul 22 03:57:02 2015 UTC,kinda the same old shit he's always asked in most interviews
macdemarco,3e4xyb,Rumsquall,4,Wed Jul 22 02:21:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I felt that the interview was a good reflection of what position Mac is in both with his music and in his life."
macdemarco,3e4xyb,hahaijoinedreddit,3,Wed Jul 22 02:57:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, to add to this, Mac is more honest with his intentions and feelings toward things (people's preconceptions, stardom etc.) in this interview than from what I've seen."
macdemarco,3e4l7v,fatso_2000,5,Tue Jul 21 22:26:09 2015 UTC,"I still can't get over how quickly he has aged, must be the high consumption of cigarettes. He looks really weathered now, compared to just 5 years ago."

macdemarco,3e5la0,hrpoodersmith,2,Wed Jul 22 03:18:04 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. All I've heard are the singles he's released so far. I'm trying to ration them as well, but it's so hard. I don't want to be tired of any of the songs on the album by the time it gets out. It's just tough not to listen to ""No Other Heart"" on repeat, though lol.   So pumped for the vinyl to come in. I've heard ""Without Me"" is really good, so I'm excited for that. I just enjoy hearing the album sequentially. I feel as if there's always  subliminal reasons why the songs are ordered the way they are. Hyped for this album, can't wait!"
macdemarco,3e5la0,MatteKudasai9,2,Wed Jul 22 04:26:46 2015 UTC,I'm not with you unfortunately and I wish I had waited until the actual release (kinda). Took away some of the excitement I had behind the album. Still satisfied though.
macdemarco,3e5la0,Rumsquall,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:35:20 2015 UTC,why even bother to reply if you aren't waiting?
macdemarco,3e5la0,cmurda26,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:27:05 2015 UTC,It's all good! figured there wouldn't be too many around this sub who were waiting
macdemarco,3e5la0,cmurda26,2,Wed Jul 22 04:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'm actually still waiting too. For some reason getting a legit copy of the music instead of some seedy rip is just better to me. Plus, Mac is one of the musicians I really enjoy spending money on."
macdemarco,3e5la0,viceroy90,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:35:22 2015 UTC,"I was planning on waiting, but someone on here sent me a message with a direct link to it. I caved, but have been loving it. I still got the special edition LP's coming my way and im pumped to play it on my record player. Also excited for just the instrumentals."
macdemarco,3e2r90,SHAUNXCARSON,4,Tue Jul 21 14:45:00 2015 UTC,hahaha the rammstein cover (shit crowd tho)
macdemarco,3e2r90,aspl,3,Tue Jul 21 16:51:33 2015 UTC,Yeah that had to be the worst crowd I've ever seen at a Mac show holy shit!!
macdemarco,3e2r90,Rumsquall,3,Tue Jul 21 17:18:38 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they are robots programmed to show emotion for the first 3 seconds of each song.
macdemarco,3e2r90,jlmmlj,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:56 2015 UTC,its in Jakarta what do you expect!
macdemarco,3e5ny8,ThatCricketJim,4,Wed Jul 22 03:41:22 2015 UTC,"What's with the hate on the covers? They're just having fun on the stage, it's hard touring everyday playing the same songs and set list. Band is fine as it is"
macdemarco,3e5ny8,throwawaynoop,3,Wed Jul 22 04:12:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm a minority here, but I really like the whole band from Pierce, Joe and Andy.  They really have these odd yet fitting personalities on and off stage. I enjoy their antics, and I think they fit Mac's demeanor well.       I never thought Pierce was a bad bass player, either? I'd like to say I have a good ear for bass, I love Mac's bass in his songs, and I've never been disappointed with his playing. I wish it was a bit louder sometimes like live Paul McCartney and Wings style, but I wish everyone had louder bass live. I've also never heard him ruin a cover. He does the high register vocals sometimes, but I think he does pretty well. They're just jamming.      My thing, I guess, is that if Mac still plays with them, he must be fine with their playing. He writes the songs and the music by himself, if one of these days he wants new members to back him up, by all means. But he seems happy with what he's got, and I have no complaints."
macdemarco,3e5ny8,MatteKudasai9,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:22:10 2015 UTC,that was actually the first thing i thought when i heard no other heart.. i'll be pleasantly surprised if pierce can play that one properly live
macdemarco,3e5ny8,dewg0ng,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:00:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seems to be an unpopular opinion around here but I can't  stand Pierce on those covers. I just don't think it's funny or fun at all. Just really jarring. I'd much rather hear goodbye weekend or robson girl...also listen to I'm a man on RNRNC then try and listen to pierce sing the chorus with mac...kills the song for me."

macdemarco,3dzn9d,haminspace4,2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:41 2015 UTC,It's strange that they've released nearly all the tracks apart from 'a heart like hers' and 'without me'
macdemarco,3dzn9d,hazabaza9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:10:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, half the album is already out as singles pretty much"
macdemarco,3dzn9d,kippman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:08 2015 UTC,Wow that bass line on the chorus is tasty.  If it was a little slower it would be GREAT for live shows.

macdemarco,3e16df,MatteKudasai9,6,Tue Jul 21 04:04:42 2015 UTC,"Probs not because Mac released it on his bandcamp, not on captured tracks"
macdemarco,3e16df,IAMYourFatherAMAA,6,Tue Jul 21 04:40:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, the plot thickens. Great point, dad."
macdemarco,3e16df,so0o,8,Tue Jul 21 06:50:52 2015 UTC,"Probably, because Mac is their cash cow."
macdemarco,3e16df,PerceptionShift,4,Tue Jul 21 04:38:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they'd definitely make a ton of cash from it."
macdemarco,3e16df,vector_kid,3,Tue Jul 21 06:50:29 2015 UTC,They released his demos on every format so I'd say nothing is really out of the question as far as CT and Mac go.

macdemarco,3drv2h,bravelittlemicrowave,2,Sun Jul 19 07:33:30 2015 UTC,agreed
macdemarco,3drv2h,zeke_24,4,Sat Jul 18 23:38:15 2015 UTC,Special K is incredible. I love this collection. I think this is a sign of what's to come.
macdemarco,3drv2h,pocketbunny,3,Sun Jul 19 04:30:53 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the new music and lyrics on Another One. But that classic trippy mac is preset on Some other ones and I LOVE IT! Another one reminds me of Elton John/Billy Joel. I like that a lot, nothing like ""2"" or ""Salad Days"", but good to see him evolving."
macdemarco,3drv2h,viceroy90,2,Sat Jul 18 22:41:00 2015 UTC,It's awesome he can move away from his sound that everyone gets to know so well it's refreshing that he can keep it funky fresh
macdemarco,3drv2h,fatso_2000,3,Sun Jul 19 02:08:08 2015 UTC,"man it's just simply amazing, every song has some fucking chill vibe that i love, i think all of these songs fits well in a video-game, idk why haha especially in young coconut, the synth just reminds me of super mario bros"
macdemarco,3drv2h,robertdewiro,2,Mon Jul 20 15:48:45 2015 UTC,Yeah maybe something like Hotline Miami. I can see young coconut on the soundtrack to that game.
macdemarco,3drv2h,Rumsquall,5,Mon Jul 20 19:57:46 2015 UTC,"They stand on their own as instrumentals imo. They're maybe a little too much George Harrison guitar toney to have lyrics, but I'm satisfied."
macdemarco,3drv2h,Rumsquall,3,Sat Jul 18 21:28:08 2015 UTC,Yes very George Harrison. But why does that tone equate no place for lyrics?
macdemarco,3drv2h,youthcanoe,0,Sat Jul 18 22:40:19 2015 UTC,They'd garner a larger audience and more people would notice I guess?

macdemarco,3drv2h,Nakyi,2,Sat Jul 18 21:35:57 2015 UTC,"haha I'm not surprised to find out yellow magic orchestra is a japanese band. Mac seems to have a hankering for japanese synth-type music, e.g. Chamber of Reflection's use of the melody from Shigeo Sekito's The World II. He has also mentioned one or two other Japanese bands he used to listen in his interview with Nardwuar."

macdemarco,3dh8wp,kippman,11,Thu Jul 16 06:47:35 2015 UTC,"It's always been there as kind of a back-mask to his music and I don't think it's a new thing by any means. It's what makes his music genuine for me at least that he's not just trying to make a catchy tune, but he's got something to say/teach. I'd say the new album is the mostly lovey-dovey, not especially ""soft"". That being said, I'm ready for what's next from him. Another One was something he needed to get off his chest, kind of a pit stop, but I think there are better things to come..."
macdemarco,3dh8wp,Rumsquall,3,Thu Jul 16 17:20:48 2015 UTC,"i kinda liked how he held back from writing songs like this for 2 and swayed that way a bit for salad days but for this just gone all out love and emotion! so glad hes wrote these songs, the whole albums amazing and hes amazing."

macdemarco,3d7dbm,ellioup,2,Tue Jul 14 02:24:51 2015 UTC,I doubt it's Some Other Ones since he said it was recorded on the 4th through the 8th. It could be the instrumentals you get when you pre order the album on Itunes.

macdemarco,3d5fcx,Rumsquall,3,Mon Jul 13 18:02:09 2015 UTC,"No need to spend money. Do you have Operator and Analog in Ableton? Just flip through presets, find something close to what you're looking for, and tweak after that. Over time, you'll figure our what settings make what types of sounds. That a little reverb/chorus will help.  Also you could look for synth samples, look for a Yamaha Dx7 samplepack maybe? Really most synths are pretty versatile, you can get a pad sound from any synth (they'll all have their own character). I believe Mac has a DX7 though. Also google 'AfroDJMac', I believe he has a DX7 instrument rack for very cheap, like under 10 bucks probably."
macdemarco,3d5fcx,anxiety_quest,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:10:22 2015 UTC,use free vst synths. there are a lot of janky amateur ones out on the web that sound pretty sick. if you download a few of them you'll probably be able to get a nice mac piano sound in at least one of them.

macdemarco,3czf1t,matthewmora,9,Sun Jul 12 05:23:38 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that the OP is making reference to the fact that in one of his recent songs, Mac tells people to come by his house and he'll make them a coffee... And that's what really happened after that! Or maybe the OP's just saying random stuff.."

macdemarco,3d0930,hrpoodersmith,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:27:17 2015 UTC,It was Mac's first time playing in Adelaide so I had not met him before. Being ontop of his shoulders was great though my balls were nearly crushed on several occasions :)
macdemarco,3cy65o,janjostine,4,Sat Jul 11 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"I cannot stop listening to Onion Man. Mac needs to add some lyrics, elongate the solo and turn this into a real song. It's so damn good."
macdemarco,3cy65o,Cletus_Van_Dam,3,Sun Jul 12 04:27:45 2015 UTC,The Without Me melody reminds me of the Goodbye Weekend melody

macdemarco,3cyenq,kidsincatacombs,2,Sun Jul 12 09:22:37 2015 UTC,Agreed!

macdemarco,3cyenq,jramjram,2,Mon Jul 13 03:14:46 2015 UTC,"I really do enjoy Just to put me down and A heart like hers. The lyrics meander as well as the song itself. Fitting for the title, ""Just to put me down"" and perfect for a lazy sunday. The fade out at the end is icing on the cake.  A heart like hers answers the question ""Just to put me down"" asks. Very well put together album."

macdemarco,3cyenq,Blugrass,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:02:12 2015 UTC,Without Me! Sounds like nice slow burner to be played at a prom
macdemarco,3cztjj,kippman,2,Sun Jul 12 07:27:12 2015 UTC,"I love his slide playing. It sounds great in his other songs like Boe Zaah. I'm not totally sure, but does anyone know if the solo in Robson Girl is him going crazy on the slide? Sounds like it but not totally sure. And ""The way you love her""? don't think there's slide in that song"
macdemarco,3cztjj,liamPwalsh,-1,Sun Jul 12 14:30:09 2015 UTC,"There's no way that lead guitar in the introduction of ""The Way You'd Love Her"" isn't slide. I'm pretty sure you can hear him play it in the promo video.   On Robson Girl I think he's just wailing on which we frets his fingers hit, in some parts however is sounds like those higher parts resolve to an open tuning so he might be sliding it."
macdemarco,3cztjj,jonjonman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:13:40 2015 UTC,It's a pedal effect/whammy dude. Def not slide.
macdemarco,3cztjj,billmeister123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:40:01 2015 UTC,"I think he means when he changes note, not the wobbly whammy effect"
macdemarco,3cztjj,jonjonman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:07:25 2015 UTC,OOOO- could be then. I'm not sure. Hm...
macdemarco,3cztjj,notmacdemarco,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:12:20 2015 UTC,The lead in way you love her is definitely not slide.
macdemarco,3cztjj,notmacdemarco,2,Mon Jul 13 05:15:23 2015 UTC,Fairly sure its a synth.
macdemarco,3cztjj,billmeister123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:15:23 2015 UTC,"There is definitely a slide used on Onion Man on the lead guitar part, not sure about The Way You'd Love Her though, it sounds like a mix between him sliding his fingers down the fret, and a slide being used to do it, not sure. (no the wobbly sound though, that's either done with a whammy or pedal)"
macdemarco,3cztjj,Rumsquall,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:06:56 2015 UTC,Kind of upsetting to hear you think that lol. He's just sliding his finger to the note and bending it back and forth very quickly.
macdemarco,3cztjj,notmacdemarco,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:05:52 2015 UTC,I should clarify I was referring to Onion Man and not Way You'd Love her.
macdemarco,3cztjj,muddydoubletrouble,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:34:33 2015 UTC,oh is that what it's called? I always thought it sounded pretty groovy
macdemarco,3cztjj,EndersToi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:06:49 2015 UTC,"I definitely dig the use of slide on Onion Man.  However, I'm fairly certain the riff for The Way You'd Love Her is Mac using the tremolo arm on his stratocaster."
macdemarco,3cztjj,Blugrass,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:51:42 2015 UTC,"Actually, that would make more sense. I keep for getting Mac is a strat guy now. He sure as hell made it sound slidey though. Cool lick!"

Besides both being artists, Shamir is a big fan of Mac (as you noticed from the videos lol) and cites Mac as one of his inspirations (read that in an interview).

macdemarco,3cs1nl,kippman,14,Fri Jul 10 08:46:04 2015 UTC,"He doesn't care about leaks, he said in an interview it's nice to hear what the fans think before pitchfork and others tell the fans what to think about the lp."

macdemarco,3cs1nl,jbp1993,2,Fri Jul 10 09:10:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember seeing an interview when salad days leaked and if anything, he was glad. He also hates the control labels have over when/where the music is exposed. There's an acoustic Let Her Go video in which he tells a guy from his label to fuck off if he gets mad about playing it pre release. I'm sure if anything he's more so relieved by it but who knows what's changed in the past year.  Regarding the salad days leak, I get this sneaking suspicion that Mac had something to do with it."

macdemarco,3cpw40,stevendalt,3,Fri Jul 10 15:29:50 2015 UTC,I'm sure Mac realized that the guy had to have downloaded the album to be able to hear the song. I don't think he would mind too much though

macdemarco,3cmm27,Cletus_Van_Dam,14,Thu Jul 9 03:40:27 2015 UTC,if he doesnt want people showing up at his house... he should really not give out his address in the last song haha
macdemarco,3cmm27,Hesher1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:04:00 2015 UTC,Which song does he say it in? That's ballsy.
macdemarco,3cmm27,Hesher1,6,Thu Jul 9 15:40:57 2015 UTC,"its in the last track of the new record, which is why some people made it out to his house for a cup of coffee.  (Which i'd personally be a little unsure on going because since the record isnt officially out, I feel like its a dead giveaway that we heard the record before we should have because of the leak..)"

macdemarco,3cmm27,againamind,2,Thu Jul 9 06:52:31 2015 UTC,Ya I'm wondering that too. But I guess he's not there a lot of the time due to touring anyway.
macdemarco,3cmm27,workaccountoftoday,2,Thu Jul 9 05:43:41 2015 UTC,I hope mac invests in a security system
macdemarco,3cmm27,theelmsmusic,8,Sat Jul 11 00:41:59 2015 UTC,does nobody click macs location on instagram?? it almost always takes it to his house on the maps. When hes home from tour and he posts on instagram his location is almost always there and if you just click it you can see it
macdemarco,3cmm27,duff_pais,2,Thu Jul 9 20:41:18 2015 UTC,yea man i thought the same thing. recently almost all (not yesterdays post) his locations are on bayfield.
macdemarco,3cmm27,swaggypreme,3,Sat Jul 11 04:29:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty ballsy that Mac just gave out his address like that, but if you're savvy and/or a big enough Mac fan, you can easily find/already know his address. He's been pretty transparent about it for a while. I remember he received a call from a Comcast representative while he was doing an interview on some podcast, and the Comcast rep openly said his address while the podcast was being recorded. Mac didn't care enough to have it edited it out.  Also, maybe he's trolling everyone and is moving soon, haha."
macdemarco,3cmm27,pharoahfawcett,2,Thu Jul 9 20:05:27 2015 UTC,"this is super random, but from what you would guess... what would the price range be for a house like that, in that area  i'm leaving the nest pretty soon and with no plans for education currently i just kinda wanna run and get away to a house exactly like that"
macdemarco,3cmm27,MagicRhythmLizard,3,Thu Jul 9 07:36:20 2015 UTC,its looks super small. as far as floor to roof proportions
macdemarco,3cmm27,cboogie,3,Thu Jul 9 08:11:55 2015 UTC,Are you looking in Rockaway specifically or just in general? Because this in now way will be a gauge for anywhere else's real estate or rental market.   Have you ever been to Far Rockaway? It's a pain in the ass to get to and not that secluded. Car or train you are looking at least an hour to get to anywhere worth hanging out at. Despite being less than 5-10 miles away as the crow flies. And if you are going to live there I hope you have nothing against Russian people cuz they run that shit.   But if you are planning on living on water rent before you buy to get a feel for it. It's cold as fuck in the winter and flood insurance is a pain in the ass which is surely required for this property.
macdemarco,3cmm27,pharoahfawcett,2,Thu Jul 9 10:29:16 2015 UTC,"just in general, would like to go to somewhere that's like, this level of shitty, near a bigger city... no idea how tho"
macdemarco,3cmm27,swaggypreme,3,Thu Jul 9 10:38:14 2015 UTC,zillow.com estimate  homes.com estimate  And supposedly according to Zillow the house was built in 1925.

macdemarco,3ckynj,MarryMe_StVincent,2,Wed Jul 8 20:12:22 2015 UTC,Can someone please PM me with a link or somewhere where I can listen to this? Can't find it on Youtube (I ordered the vinyl LP so I don't feel so guilty).

macdemarco,3ckynj,1337LEGIT,7,Wed Jul 8 21:14:04 2015 UTC,What is the address Mac gives us at the end of the last track? I doubt he lives there
macdemarco,3ckynj,Captain-Carbon,13,Wed Jul 8 21:04:28 2015 UTC,"He does, I'm a bit obsessed with mac so I remember when he made his new domain, you can whois which gives the information of the registrar... I looked up the address on google maps and it looks like the house on his instagram. Basically, he just doesn't give a shit lol"
macdemarco,3ckynj,0xISAAC,7,Wed Jul 8 21:06:50 2015 UTC,This guy is incredible.
macdemarco,3ckynj,Captain-Carbon,2,Wed Jul 8 21:34:30 2015 UTC,"and if you check out the street view image, you can see the same house in Ducktails' new video, which is shot there (you can see mac's guitar on the wall in one scene)"
macdemarco,3ckynj,willtard,2,Thu Jul 9 00:37:36 2015 UTC,He's been geotagging his address on instagram for the past few months and the google street view pictures look the same as his instagram pictures.
macdemarco,3ckynj,Caldwell35,8,Thu Jul 9 06:44:33 2015 UTC,"I can't decide whether I want to upvote and/or download this, after all this is a considerably early leak.   I'd obviously love to listen to his new EP but Mac is one of the few musicians that I want to support. Whilst I imagine he makes a decent living, he comes across as so down to earth and he goes the extra mile with some of his releases. E.g. releasing instrumentals, demos and free music such as the stream that he provided on Bandcamp today."
macdemarco,3ckynj,aguycalledjack,9,Wed Jul 8 19:52:29 2015 UTC,"You can still download it and support him, just buy some of his albums or preorder it. I think they make more money off touring than they do sales, though."
macdemarco,3ckynj,0xISAAC,5,Wed Jul 8 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a very good point. I guess the majority of people who use this subreddit are going to support Mac anyway."
macdemarco,3ckynj,aguycalledjack,4,Wed Jul 8 20:30:20 2015 UTC,"Aye, I pre-ordered the special edition and preordered it on itunes, but I'm so impatient so I just downloaded the leak :)"
macdemarco,3ckynj,0xISAAC,3,Wed Jul 8 21:05:38 2015 UTC,"As have I, just had my first listen and it's so great, so summery."
macdemarco,3ckynj,aguycalledjack,5,Wed Jul 8 21:20:44 2015 UTC,Nobody is stopping you from purchasing the LP / seeing a show when it's released man!  I totally understand what you are getting at though.
macdemarco,3ckynj,billmeister123,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"Leaks are always gonna happen, press and other industry folks get the album early for review purposes. It's already out there regardless of whether you listen to it or not, so just express your support in other ways."

macdemarco,3ckynj,jonjonman,2,Fri Jul 10 02:24:30 2015 UTC,"If any of y'all are Tame Impala fans, Currents leaked a few days ago, too. Anyways, I've been listening to Mac since about 2012 or so. Whenever 2 came out. I loved Salad Days, but the releases I've heard from Another One have left me underwhelmed. I want Mac to change his sound up a bit. I don't dislike it, but it's getting predictable in my opinion. Side note - listening to the BBQ playlist and it's gravy."
macdemarco,3ckynj,Rumsquall,3,Thu Jul 9 00:04:30 2015 UTC,Currents is so good!!
macdemarco,3ckynj,Nomadzord,2,Thu Jul 9 05:01:26 2015 UTC,"Try to think of it as a brief diary entry for Mac. Yes, we enter the world of Mac Demarco, but it's a much more somber, bitter place than we're used to. That's why I think you like his BBQ playlist more; we see the playful and quirky side to Mac we're used to, not the sad and burning atmosphere of Another One."
macdemarco,3ckynj,janjostine,2,Thu Jul 9 06:57:21 2015 UTC,I think I'm going to mix the bbq playlist with Another One to make a full album. I think it would work well.

macdemarco,3c27tg,MatteKudasai9,3,Sat Jul 4 15:47:53 2015 UTC,"There is a Kickstarter for a Brooklyn vinyl factory that Captured Tracks will employ. Not only will ""sold out"" Mac albums hopefully be a thing of the past with an independent vinyl factory at the disposal of Captured Tracks, but if you put in $35 into their kickstarter, you can choose one of three Captured Tracks colored vinyl. One is Mac DeMarco's ""2.""     They're goal of $100,000 is currently only at $40,000 with 7 days left, so who knows if all of what I said will happen, but at this point that's your best shot. I wouldn't pay more than that ever for a Mac album. CT will surely repress them because he's getting more and more popular, and they're usually for very cheap. I have Salad Days and I'm in your exact spot of wanting 2, so our best bet is to fund their kickstarter! I'd love for CT to have faster pressing times for their vinyl. On Brooklyn Vinyl Factory's Kickstarter video, they said some of these labels have a waiting time of upwards of 6 months before their orders of represses of processed and shipped to them.   I've also been scouring the web for the albums as well, and they're either grossly expensive or unavailable."

macdemarco,3buosk,companysOkay,4,Thu Jul 2 08:22:20 2015 UTC,"It sounds like a cheesy organ setting on some cheap synth. It could easily be a digital patch on like an old Yamaha/Casio consumer grade keyboard. I think he owns a sequential pro one. If you wanted to recreate it you would just use two sine wave oscillators, one tuned an octave higher than the other. There is a really slow pitch LFO on the patch for my kind of woman, it gives the synth this fucked up and out of tune sound. The organ/synth lines he plays are also only monophonic.   If I had to guess it could be a pro one, it can easily make that sound and its monophonic. I'm sure there's a little delay on the synth, he uses varying amounts of delay on lots of his tracks. I know he owns a space echo."

You're probably right on the money, but the kickstarter page said some companies have a waiting list of over 6 months to get reissues of their albums. If this vinyl factory gets funded, who knows when Captured Tracks will get the reissue of 2. It also begs the question as to whether $35 is worth it when if the album gets reissued, it would be around $18-$24, I believe. I don't think it's a bad deal to get a sure thing colored pressing of 2 by December. Time will tell, though."

Everyone was selling their rack gear to get a Mac Pro and the waves plugins. None of them were mine. I sold them for a studio I was working at. I have fond memories of some of the presets on the midiverb. The value of most gear comes and goes. I bought a Juno 60 15 years ago for $200. I sold it three years ago for $900.

macdemarco,3anjis,8bigfoot8,3,Mon Jun 22 01:57:22 2015 UTC,Around the beginning of the year
macdemarco,3anjis,Rumsquall,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:14:47 2015 UTC,"Andy was playing that strat for a while like in this KEXP Preformance Mac also used a Fender Mustang for a while like in this Video  I think Mac's been using the start for all of 2015 and maybe a bit of late 2014. He retired his old guitar because he said strings were breaking too often. It's now hung up on a wall in his house, you can see it in the teaser for Another One"
macdemarco,3anjis,BoboTheClown1029,3,Mon Jun 22 06:58:14 2015 UTC,"That guitar Andy is using isn't a strat, notice it has a telecaster headstock. I think its called a fender bullet?"

macdemarco,3anjis,EarlESquirt,5,Mon Jun 22 20:35:40 2015 UTC,I know there may be some inspiration for his and Kiera's rocky relationship stuff in his songs but I think he's also trying to change the perspective of his lyrics and just writing ambiguous love songs that can mean anything to the listener. And I'm not gonna say that some real experiences couldn't have inspired some lyrics but I think for tracks like Another One and The Way You'd Love Her he's trying to speak from a third person POV. The Way You'd Love Her is about loving someone but they don't know and he's talking about the way you WOULD love her. He's just trying to make stuff so you can put your own experiences and thoughts into it and I think that's way cooler than assuming it's all about him.

macdemarco,3aol62,Tyrone-asaurus,2,Mon Jun 22 06:24:17 2015 UTC,If you don't have Microverb IV you can just crank up the reverb on your amp
macdemarco,3aol62,BoboTheClown1029,3,Mon Jun 22 06:50:47 2015 UTC,and throw in in some chorus/vibrato from time to time
macdemarco,3aol62,JonestheSpaceCat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:26:01 2015 UTC,Not sure about Rock n roll Nightclub but I'm pretty sure that for ying yang he used a Fender Twin Reverb amp with reverb and overdrive.
macdemarco,3aol62,Portamento,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:26:31 2015 UTC,"A lot of his guitar/vocal sound on RnRNC Comes from tape machine pitch/speed changes, he used the same stuff as Ying Yang but moved away from distortion"
macdemarco,3aol62,fatso_2000,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:48:30 2015 UTC,"Ying Yang's (MakeoutVideotape) guitar is mainly just a shit ton of reverb on a shotty old guitar. Mac said himself that he didn't mess with pedals back in the day and went solely with settings on a Fender TwinReverb. Rock and Roll Night Club probably doesnt have any chorus, it's mainly him lowerring the pitch control on his Reel to Reel; so its hard to emulate. He might of used the Alesis Microverb IV on RRNC but I doubt it."
macdemarco,3aol62,Rumsquall,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"there's no distortion on Ying Yang, I had his sound perfectly on my friends twin reverb. All you do is LITERALLY crank every single nob to 10 except for the master vol of course, and you have it. Everyone think mac was this super genius at the time but he also didnt know what he was doing, he wanted what ever aspiring musician wanted his guitar to sound like which was just loud rock"

macdemarco,3a89n1,fatso_2000,3,Thu Jun 18 04:22:32 2015 UTC,"O wow! Didn't know that about the full album on Youtube. It is a pretty great version honestly. Not sure what it's called, but I love when Mac does the whole mouthing (not sure if that's the word) the ""shred solo"" at 2:16 in the NME video. In his live performances, mostly the acoustic ones, he tends to add the improvised ""mouthing"" to some of his songs, I'm assuming to make up for the lack of some instrumentation, which I find pretty funny and charming lol"
macdemarco,3a89n1,fatso_2000,2,Thu Jun 18 06:30:22 2015 UTC,Oh man I love it too it's really unique and creative! But of course those are the two big reasons we all love Mac !

macdemarco,3a4d5t,marrsquire8389,2,Thu Jun 18 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"The song is sung directly to the listener in the 3rd person.

You know, like how when you're talking with someone and you kind of sarcastically say ""heh heh, must be the case of the x, eh?"" just out of jest?

macdemarco,3a3hq1,Dancing_Shell,2,Tue Jun 16 23:04:41 2015 UTC,"I was going to mention that, but I thought it was for original music only, not covers. If I'm wrong, perhaps it should be made more clear that the thread is for covers too? I think it wont do much though, and it might be a bit better to have a rule that music should go in that thread or it's deleted??"
macdemarco,3a3hq1,againamind,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:23:02 2015 UTC,I think there should be a rule or its deleted. This way people will actually post covers where they're supposed to go.

It's always nice to hear people's stories about how artist's music has helped them in their lives. Thanks for sharing.  Relating to Mac's life, do you have any specific links to performances where Mac's said ""my previous girlfriend""? Just wondering 'cause I always thought the rumors about him and Kiki breaking up were just that, rumors. Didn't know he's actually mentioned it in concerts."
macdemarco,39vcys,Dancing_Shell,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:43:07 2015 UTC,"(Not op) 42 minutes in, he mentions it. But yano, relationships have their ups and downs... he also said Kiera died in an interview before so it could just be a joke."

Always thought that they had always been together and the rumors kinda came from nowhere."
macdemarco,39vcys,Dancing_Shell,2,Mon Jun 15 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"there's quite a few performances of him saying 'a girl I used to date' or 'my previous girlfriend' during together.

macdemarco,39vcys,theelmsmusic,6,Tue Jun 16 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"feel the same way, im not the type to get personal but it creeps me out that i was having doubts about me and my girlfriend working out, were still together but i always feel that sometimes it can end really quickly, another ones lyrics are brutally relatable"
macdemarco,39vcys,dewg0ng,3,Mon Jun 15 03:01:11 2015 UTC,"sad wistful contemplative mac is really refreshing, hope more of the record follows the same vibe. another one might actually end up as my favorite track of his"
macdemarco,39vcys,Rumsquall,2,Mon Jun 15 04:28:42 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I never put two-and-two together about Mac, Kiki, and these new songs. When I heard the rumors through the pipeline it kind of hit me hard (about them apparently splitting). Its not even that its some kind of celebrity romance that I oogle over, it's coming from a guy who's work I love, and that work is largely about this one girl. Kind of felt like his past songs were a little cracked. Puts a new meaning to these new songs that never crossed my mind. thanks."
macdemarco,39vcys,floatingpaper,2,Mon Jun 15 04:47:41 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people can relate to the lyrics ""must be another one, must be another one she loves."" I love this song.   For me, it just reminded me of when I was super infatuated with someone and did all I could to try and be with them. All the while, it was 'another one' she loved.

I've saw in some interviews that they only spent the day in L.A together to film it too which adds to the fact that he didn't contribute musically to it.  (also listening back i can't hear guitar, just distorted keyboards, bass, and synth)"

I was living in San Diego at the time making a 1.5 hour commute every day, back and forth, so I needed something new to listen to. At first I didn't get how this could be his favorite album of the year. But after a few listens, I absolutely fell in love with how chill the album was. I fell in love with Blue Boy and played it on repeat. But Brother really spoke to me. I was really homesick at the time, I hated my job and living in San Diego.

Checked out the music video for My Kind of Woman, loved the video and the song. Downloaded Rock and Roll Night Club, dug it a lot, and the love for Mac and his music grew increasingly from there. :)"

I decided to check out a few if his songs (I think Ode to Viceroy and Freaking Out the Neighbourhood) but I remember that I didn't like it very much at first. I also ended up missing his gig. Now I kick myself every time I think about it, but I hope I can see a show in the near future."

macdemarco,39v13a,Bennettjamin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"I followed Captured Tracks because of Beach Fossils and read a blurb about this new artist Mac DeMarco. Heard ""Baby's Wearing Blue Jeans"" and loved it.   A few months later (Sept 2012) saw he was playing San Diego Music Thing (similar setup to SXSW) and went to go see him. He was playing before Pinback and they would not let us in to see him because people lined up outside had special tickets for that later headlining show. I was pissed, said that made no sense for the artist performing before the headliner (not as an opener) and convinced them to let me in if I promised to leave right after. Saw him with probably 20 people, he seemed bummed by the resultant turnout, but made the best of it. Fell in love with his live stage antics and the new stuff which would be on the album ""2""."

Sitting there smoking and listening to demarco until the sun came up and the sunrise in the water was super cool, Macs music really adds that extra feeling to make things a memorable moment."

macdemarco,39even,naughteee,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:54:34 2015 UTC,What is the track around 16 minutes?
macdemarco,39even,PerceptionShift,3,Thu Jun 11 11:19:04 2015 UTC,"Conan Mockasin's ""I'm the Man Who Will Find You"". Check out his albums Forever Dolphin Love and Caramel, apparently both were of fairly big influence on Mac"
macdemarco,39f8p3,Caldwell35,21,Thu Jun 11 09:21:06 2015 UTC,"Not really cool to shout at a human being ""show your ass"" like he's some sort of animal... Love Mac and everything but some of his fans are cringeworthy."
macdemarco,39f8p3,srekcornaivaf,8,Thu Jun 11 14:54:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's kind of stupid kids think Mac will do a bunch of crazy shit just because he stuck that drumstick up his ass once."
macdemarco,39f8p3,camrn,9,Thu Jun 11 19:06:50 2015 UTC,"i always cringe when people bring that up in interviews, cos he's so clearly sick of talking about it"
macdemarco,39f8p3,vfox95,6,Thu Jun 11 20:03:46 2015 UTC,"Shows are bad too. It's a lot of people yelling stupid ass things related to Mac.  ""FUCKIN MONKEEEE""  ""IS ONLY SMELLZ"""
macdemarco,39f8p3,MarrianneAndMe,2,Fri Jun 12 00:13:03 2015 UTC,i'm seeing mac for the first time in September. insanely excited but dunno what the crowd's gonna be like.
macdemarco,39f8p3,vfox95,3,Fri Jun 12 00:14:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure where you are but I saw him in Vancouver this year and last year and last years show was a lot better, mostly because of the cooler crowd. Felt more like one big hangout. This years there were a lot of shit heads shoving people from behind, throwing crap, screaming stupid stuff. I'm gonna see him again in October and I really hope it's not like that. I'm not sure if that's just Vancouver, though."
macdemarco,39f8p3,MarrianneAndMe,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:21:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah his fanbase is largely bullshit and only like him for the wackiness and the ""weirdness"" of his sound. A lot of the kids that listen to his music (just what I've seen in person and online) only like him because they think it's cool to like something that's ""weird""."
macdemarco,39f8p3,Rumsquall,2,Fri Jun 12 21:03:58 2015 UTC,No way i was there! Best show I've been to and it was sold out!
macdemarco,39bbi1,staniks,6,Wed Jun 10 16:29:57 2015 UTC,He's been sick apparently! He does look rough.. Great performance still though
macdemarco,39bbi1,dangranger92,6,Wed Jun 10 16:51:47 2015 UTC,wayyy better than the studio version for me actually.

macdemarco,39h974,iimalteaserii,0,Fri Jun 12 14:09:18 2015 UTC,ran them through my line 6 into a tascam us-122 L and then into logic :p
macdemarco,39bixb,Caldwell35,15,Wed Jun 10 17:19:58 2015 UTC,Better Call Mac
macdemarco,39bixb,ryanthemovieman,4,Wed Jun 10 17:28:58 2015 UTC,Ayy
macdemarco,39bixb,BeanRaider,4,Wed Jun 10 20:48:31 2015 UTC,Lmao
macdemarco,39bixb,FlumFlum,7,Thu Jun 11 03:37:08 2015 UTC,"yall should watch that show, its pretty sweet"
macdemarco,39bixb,theelmsmusic,4,Wed Jun 10 20:38:21 2015 UTC,"as someone who's never seen bcs, that actually had me fooled for the first 10 secs"
macdemarco,39bixb,vfox95,3,Thu Jun 11 02:27:50 2015 UTC,I guess it does kinda sound like something mac could make
macdemarco,39bixb,BasedLeon,3,Thu Jun 11 01:32:11 2015 UTC,this is pretty clever

macdemarco,39bab4,billmeister123,2,Thu Jun 11 01:08:06 2015 UTC,here's a v. rough one i made in 5 minutes
macdemarco,39cegf,theelmsmusic,5,Wed Jun 10 20:40:26 2015 UTC,I dont think he's using the Alesis anymore. He's using a shit ton of chorus pedals combined with that shit-colored Strat and a Princeton reverb amp giving it that creamy Garcia tone. A cock-raiser fersure. ]  Edit: There's also a reason he told everyone he used the Alesis... he's not going to use it anymore?
macdemarco,39cegf,Rumsquall,3,Thu Jun 11 00:08:59 2015 UTC,shit-colored Strat Lmao
macdemarco,39cegf,camrn,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:14:44 2015 UTC,"Really not enjoying that strat, wish he still rocked the Teisco, or at least the Mustang )-:"
macdemarco,39cegf,GraphicNomad,2,Thu Jun 11 19:36:22 2015 UTC,"I preferred the Mustang out of all his guitars, sucks he only used it for a short while."
macdemarco,39cegf,camrn,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:52:40 2015 UTC,It does sound like a whammy bar and he talked about in an interview how he wanted to mess around with an whammy bar so maybe it doesn't sound too much like the microverb
macdemarco,397mz6,hercesa9,8,Tue Jun 9 21:03:25 2015 UTC,thats lame. I remember when I saw Mac some girl was asking him to fight her and I don't think even as a joke. Some people get aggressive when excited I guess
macdemarco,397mz6,DojoDaniel,9,Wed Jun 10 01:31:28 2015 UTC,"Now it makes more sense why in the BBC Radio interview Mac said he got weird vibes there, that it seemed like a whole bunch of people wanted to legitimately fight him..."
macdemarco,397mz6,Dancing_Shell,4,Wed Jun 10 02:05:01 2015 UTC,"nah that was at parklife in manchester, field day was chilled out"
macdemarco,397mz6,agorroth,2,Wed Jun 10 08:24:29 2015 UTC,"Ohh alright, my bad."
macdemarco,397mz6,Dancing_Shell,5,Wed Jun 10 15:18:58 2015 UTC,fuck those guys
macdemarco,397mz6,zeke_24,2,Wed Jun 10 07:49:30 2015 UTC,"Was there, my girlfriend; a longtime Mac skeptic was won over by the gig and the vibes the band threw out during the set. It was a great show  I get the feeling that the stuff was not thrown to intentionally strike or hurt the lads, just people wanting to be a part of the show. Here's some shit to fuck about with sort of thing. The atmosphere was laid back, slightly oddball and lets have a damned fun time. I hope they did too.  In other news, what the fuck were they upto at Parklife in Manchester?!"
macdemarco,397mz6,punksfirstbeer,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:32:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd also like to know
macdemarco,397mz6,laurenzaccio,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:47:50 2015 UTC,lol! cool meeting him. He seems like a genuine nice guy
macdemarco,397hlz,ConfusedCarp,4,Tue Jun 9 20:28:21 2015 UTC,If Mac gets 27-club'd by anything its gonna be the common cold. Guy is always sick as shit.
macdemarco,397hlz,Rumsquall,2,Wed Jun 10 06:26:27 2015 UTC,jesus mac sounds like hes having a hard time on the vocals
macdemarco,397hlz,theelmsmusic,8,Tue Jun 9 20:39:42 2015 UTC,"He said in the beginning of the interview - ""feeling a bit under the weather."""
macdemarco,397hlz,Dancing_Shell,2,Tue Jun 9 23:53:18 2015 UTC,Might be sick or tired.
macdemarco,397hlz,camrn,2,Tue Jun 9 22:52:29 2015 UTC,probably a morning session after a night of drinking?
macdemarco,397hlz,fatso_2000,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:43:36 2015 UTC,Yeah he sounds like he had a rough night before hand
macdemarco,397b7c,RLZNT,4,Tue Jun 9 19:47:18 2015 UTC,Thank you.
macdemarco,397b7c,_Negrodamus_,3,Tue Jun 9 20:20:00 2015 UTC,Certified shred at the end of that track
macdemarco,397b7c,Iceman1192,4,Tue Jun 9 21:38:19 2015 UTC,"Shoutout to Jerry Garcia for the hot licks, RIP Jerry."
macdemarco,397b7c,pharoahfawcett,2,Tue Jun 9 21:49:10 2015 UTC,"oh god. i no longer have high hopes in any way for this EP. if these are the defining tracks, then i'm really disappointed. i say this as a big mac fan. i'm seeing him a second time inOH MY THAT GUITAR SOLO, WOW THATS VERY PLEASANT I LIKE THAT A LOT  well that solo made it better but these last two tracks have been mediocre as all hell. crossing fingers that he doesn't fade into irrelevancy/keep putting out garbage tracks/get so popular that everyone bandwagons on and we all forget about him in two years."
macdemarco,397b7c,Rumsquall,4,Wed Jun 10 04:56:59 2015 UTC,"I'm upvoting you because this track is a bit lazy in it's creativity. That being said, these tracks do hint at something refreshing in terms of Mac's sound on this album. It's a much more of an auburn, funk-fest than Salad Days or 2. They have a warmness that I've seldom seen in Mac's repertoire as well. I think as a whole piece of art, Another One will be a step in the right direction and an overall raunch-fest that will definatley get a few cocks in the air."
macdemarco,397b7c,lackofkneecaps,2,Wed Jun 10 06:38:42 2015 UTC,"Lets be honest, mac writes at least in part pop hits. His lyrics are catchy but nothing groundbreaking. Unfortunately this stuff is a little stale. Love macs sounds but can't help but feel if hes gonna stick so close to a formula that he went with before he shouldn't be releasing new stuff this much. Im all for new mac, but if hes not switching things up at least slightly it kinda discounts all of his music"
macdemarco,397b7c,Eeevanbro,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:30:21 2015 UTC,"I was pretty bummed out about this the first time I heard it, but after a few listens it actually becomes a lot easier on the ears, the only part that really bothers me is the synths in the chorus. I know everyone wants more synths in the new album, but they seem almost forced in this song or they could have at least been done a lot better. From the sounds of it the new album sounds more like easy listening rather the songs with deeper meaning he had on Salad Days. Overall it's an easy song to listen to and it doesn't require much thinking which is good in its own way. As a side note holy fuck Mac kills it on guitar on this track"
macdemarco,397b7c,DisruptiveOnion,2,Wed Jun 10 04:33:17 2015 UTC,"wow, those synth chords are my favourite bit aside from the guitar solo, but fair enough dude :)"
macdemarco,397b7c,theelmsmusic,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:30:17 2015 UTC,Anyone notice how the song's progression and solo are pretty much the same as the song the stars keep on calling my name?
macdemarco,397b7c,hazabaza9,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:23:02 2015 UTC,"i saw the video of him playing it live in the back of a cab, 4th fret capo and the fingering is pretty similiar"

macdemarco,399ati,hurricaneman1,5,Wed Jun 10 04:36:47 2015 UTC,"Mac basically admitted he ripped him off, on the Salad Days vinyl on the pic of his studio there's a piece of paper taped to a locker that says ""Thanks to blah, blah, blah, and Shigeo"""
macdemarco,399ati,camrn,6,Wed Jun 10 06:36:54 2015 UTC,"For those that don't know, the chamber of reflection music video has listed Shigeo in the credits. Mac also mentions Shigeo as one of his inspirations in alot of the interviews he does"

macdemarco,396b3n,Fjel,11,Tue Jun 9 15:50:59 2015 UTC,"Oh fuck Andy is in Tonstartssbandht? I knew Mac used to live with the guys in the band but I didn't know Andy was one of the two brothers! That's awesome as shit! Tonstartssbandht is pretty cool, if you haven't heard them check out their album An When.   I wouldn't doubt he'd leave for it as they've already done a few tours including a really successful one in Europe. One of their songs was in Palo Alto and they've been catching some success anyways. They're a great band and put out a ton of music. Can't blame him for skipping out since Mac tours all the time. Wouldn't say he's so much like Pete because Andy already has some touring and success under his belt with his band, but then again theyre not that different."
macdemarco,396b3n,PerceptionShift,8,Tue Jun 9 16:04:48 2015 UTC,I was there + I thought he was just kidding because his guitar wasn't working for the whole set
macdemarco,396b3n,agorroth,7,Tue Jun 9 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"Hey yeah I was there at field day on Sunday and saw Mac. The guitarist was having loads of problems with his guitar / amp setup, and I was pretty sure he was joking when he said it was his last show because they couldn't get it working for like the first 25 minutes (although your website may have said that, but it's in a diff language for mee)"
macdemarco,396b3n,oifella,4,Tue Jun 9 21:19:35 2015 UTC,"I was at field day and it's definitely not true, he was 100% joking when he said it as he had a few guitar problems, but they where all chill about it. he even sang his guitar solo"

macdemarco,396b3n,GraphicNomad,3,Wed Jun 10 06:32:34 2015 UTC,In The Shower is one of the smoothest albums I've ever heard
macdemarco,396b3n,abusedwa1rus,3,Sat Jun 13 03:38:36 2015 UTC,"That's dope, but also a bummer, because I was just warming up to Andy, and it seems like he really loves playing w Mac, unlike Pierce sometimes haha."

macdemarco,3943eh,FlumFlum,8,Tue Jun 9 03:10:59 2015 UTC,BAH GAWD THIS IS ALREADY A FAVORITE
macdemarco,3943eh,CarlsInTheHouse,6,Tue Jun 9 03:30:09 2015 UTC,"This was the song I was looking forward to hearing the most and I'm truly digging the instrumental work; it's pretty damn catchy. The vocals, however, are pretty lack luster. I think it has the potential to be way catchier than it is. The reason everyone loved Salad Days so much was because the hooks were crazy addictive.   My only other gripe is the singing during the solo. That solo is good enough to be stand alone. Also, it cuts out at the end (maybe it was just the version the BBC was given) but it should've probably faded out or something along those lines.  All that aside, I'm really liking it and currently listening to it on repeat. I enjoy it more than the first song from Another One and I hope the rest of the album sounds similar to this."
macdemarco,3943eh,C-Money25,4,Tue Jun 9 17:47:25 2015 UTC,Great find my man! Your thoughts?
macdemarco,3943eh,jbp1993,7,Tue Jun 9 03:35:27 2015 UTC,"its catchy, but the synth part is sorta weak. One of macs best solos id say, super sweet"
macdemarco,3943eh,jonjonman,7,Tue Jun 9 03:42:20 2015 UTC,Do you guys think this album is about to leak soon?
macdemarco,3943eh,ajr418,5,Tue Jun 9 05:11:57 2015 UTC,"I fuckin hope so, looks like radios + press have it."
macdemarco,3943eh,L-Boy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:15:40 2015 UTC,"No doubt, its only a matter of time!!"
macdemarco,3943eh,ajr418,2,Tue Jun 9 08:35:11 2015 UTC,why do you think it'll leak so early? I know salad days leaked months in advance but you would think macs management (or whoever handles that kind of stuff) would be extra careful this time around about it leaking?
macdemarco,3943eh,L-Boy,3,Tue Jun 9 18:17:29 2015 UTC,"Almost any time that a CD is pressed this early, its bound to leak considerably earlier than the release date. Plus, I don't think Mac's management nor Mac himself care all that much wether it will leak or not, because it happens to a lot of artists, plus if they were really concerned about it being leaked, I don't think it would have been pressed this early. Just my opinion, but I mean we've already seen 1 song from it, I think it'll only be a matter of time until we see the rest."
macdemarco,3943eh,ajr418,3,Tue Jun 9 18:42:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize the CDs were pressed until I saw the thread about it a couple minute ago, so you're probably right in saying that it'll leak soon. and yeah, probably not, Mac fans seem like the kind of people who buy the album anyway. I pre ordered it on iTunes the day it was available but I would jump at the chance to hear it 2 months early"
macdemarco,3943eh,Fjel,2,Tue Jun 9 19:36:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah if it leaks I wouldn't be able to help myself from listening, but I'd definitely still buy a copy."
macdemarco,3943eh,screamadelica_,10,Wed Jun 10 08:43:54 2015 UTC,"Man i was so exited for this song, but if i have to be honest it's kinda weak. It's very repetitive, and the vocals are kinda boring. I loved The way you'd love her though."
macdemarco,3943eh,Horney-horner,4,Tue Jun 9 10:52:21 2015 UTC,"agreed, i was really hoping for an EP of chamber of reflection-esque songs, still happy macs about and making music that makes him happy though :)"
macdemarco,3943eh,penismonkeylover,0,Tue Jun 9 11:55:38 2015 UTC,Dude! that exactly what I thought when Salad days came out. He needs a more down beat album and Chamber of Reflection was the perfect model for it.
macdemarco,3943eh,Puzzular,4,Sat Jun 13 05:54:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, shame the solo has the vocals over it too, because they aren't his best"
macdemarco,3943eh,paparoni63,2,Tue Jun 9 11:50:28 2015 UTC,"agreed. after hearing that solo in the making of another one video i was really excited to hear the final product. his falsetto is really off here, though, and it's covering up what would be a great guitar solo."
macdemarco,3943eh,Spaghetti_Head_Man,3,Tue Jun 9 21:35:52 2015 UTC,The little synth chords in the background remind me of the piano in the really old songs they put in Fallout for some reason.
macdemarco,3943eh,alexodam,3,Tue Jun 9 04:56:33 2015 UTC,Mac on BBC 6 Music. Hopefully they play him regularly when his new album comes out.

macdemarco,3943eh,ProfDuude,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:40:22 2015 UTC,I was really hoping we'd get more fun solo's like this on the album. Lovin this tune so much. He's just full out having fun with the guitar on this one.
macdemarco,3943eh,Portamento,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:49:26 2015 UTC,The solo is dope af but this song was kind of disappointing for me honestly. It felt so empty up until he starts the solo. The chord progression is too simplistic for how little is going on in the song and then the piano comes in sounding completely disconnected from the rest of the song. Eh :(
macdemarco,3943eh,Rumsquall,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:41:58 2015 UTC,Anyone know why it got taken down?

If you don't like it, who gives a fuck?  Either listen to it or don't.  It's not like he's put out 15 albums and is in his late 30's doing the same thing over and over again.  He's only had, like what, three full-albums?  Give the guy a break.  This was a great track."

But fukkit, this sub is so positive so yeah, fuck yeah Homeshake!  I drove 3 hours to a breakfast bar to see Homeshake and Juan Wauters and it was totally worth it. The set was good and then I got to shoot the shit with Pete for a bit. I bought the special edition of In the Shower and he was like ""thanks dood this is going right into the gas tank!"". Signed the poster too, which apparently is a self-portrait by his girlfriend. She did the cover art for ITS and I think the tape too.

I think 2,000 is a perfect amount specially if this album rules, besides its not a full length LP so it's not as wanted as others I guess, maybe they just haven't all been purchased.."
macdemarco,38ubs3,fatso_2000,2,Sun Jun 7 12:52:15 2015 UTC,"I was surprised that it was 2000, since that's really not that much of a limited edition, especially compared to how limited CT's records can be.   Nevertheless, I'd rather there be more than less. Really the concept of artificial scarcity is bullshit so I'm not gonna be upset if I expected it to be like 500 and then it was 4x that. I wish the other albums had 2000 special editions pressed, I would have been able to nab the Salad Days one then.  The more the merrier, ya know?"

macdemarco,38r8t7,bminus02,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"yeah, i posted this link to show the similarities, not to say how mac copied him. Im not sure if you understand what the fuck inspiration means, if you're inspired by macs music, does that mean that youre gonna go make the EXACT same music as him? No. If you're inspired by him it means that you're gonna make music because you know that he did make music too, given the shitty budget he had when he started makeout and RNRNC. So, if you know he can make good music on a ok budget with less than average equipment, it inspires YOU to make music you think is good given your budget. Make sure you understand what you're saying before you jump the gun and post something."
macdemarco,38r8t7,Rumsquall,0,Sun Jun 7 21:30:05 2015 UTC,That's the thing though is that he is completely copying his persona. He talks about it a lot. That way of crowd control is really effective at charming people. Mac's appearance and chillness elevate that.

macdemarco,38hyxa,kenthewolfboy,5,Fri Jun 5 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"Because this subreddit turned from people who were well informed on the band and actually offered interesting observations, to people from tumblr latching on to the cult of his personality. Then there's all the fucking awful covers constantly being posted and old content re-hashed. Plus most of you guys display this sort of hero worship towards him and try to use his humour, it's embarrassing."
macdemarco,38hyxa,regularhuman1,3,Fri Jun 5 02:16:33 2015 UTC,"Valid points. I'm trying to figure out how to control the amount of covers that is posted, i'm thinking of doing a thread similar to the own music threads but the problem is i can only sticky one thread at a time, which is a pain in the ass Any suggestions are welcome though, i'm always trying to make this place better and for it to not turn into some weird circlejerk type thing!"
macdemarco,38hyxa,kenthewolfboy,3,Fri Jun 5 16:41:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly man, I think the sub would benefit from no longer allowing people to post covers or their own music."

I'm not a hipster, I'm just someone who knows how to use a subreddit properly, meaning that I check if things are posted before I go ahead and post them (by using the search bar), and if not, I stop and think, will people have seen this? You don't get people on other fan subreddit's joining up and then going omg check out my cool cover guys, or asking dumb shit like 'where can I get a hat like mac's??' I'm not pissed off at him being famous, I am annoyed at how lame his fanbase is though, it deters from his music because it puts more of a spotlight on his personality."

macdemarco,38fv7r,ShaqsHouse,2,Wed Jun 3 23:03:06 2015 UTC,"i dont own a vinyl record player so i cant tell you about that, but for your DAW (so garageband, for instance) you should download a software called Reaper. Its very easy to use, just takes a bit to get used to and it is so much better than garageband. it says you have a trial version, but you never really have to pay for it at all. For mics, youd be fine with getting a Shure SM57, that mic is amazing for the price given, and mac used it to mic his guitar amp for 2, salad days and RNRNC. For drums, download Addictive Drums 2, its the best free real sounding kit i found, and it works great with reaper."
macdemarco,38fv7r,theelmsmusic,2,Thu Jun 4 00:23:13 2015 UTC,"I'd second getting the SM57, it's a total work horse!"
macdemarco,38fv7r,dangranger92,2,Thu Jun 4 09:11:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah you should get an SM57, and maybe a Focusrite 2i2 as an interface"
macdemarco,38fv7r,Fjel,2,Thu Jun 4 16:44:49 2015 UTC,"You'll get a lot further calling them turntables instead of vinyl record players. And you should check out /r/vinyl for the beginners guides and also use the search function for the thousands of threads about what beginners brands are good to go. As always I rexommend used gear over new but if new is your only option you can still get a solid and proper turntable setup for $300+. And also Crosleys are never good. They get a lot of bashing but they do really suck. I started with the equivalent of one years ago and I can hear it's wear on my early records. Better to not have records than to have a Crosley, especially with how expensive records are getting."
macdemarco,38fv7r,PerceptionShift,2,Fri Jun 5 05:37:08 2015 UTC,"if you dont feel like using an interface you can get a blue snowball mic, they just plug directly into usb and their sound quality is more than serviceable for what it sounds like youre looking for. in terms of drum tracks i'm lazy and i like to use a free drum machine program called hammerhead, you can find it online along with a multitude of preset tones for use with the program aswell."
macdemarco,38fv7r,dewg0ng,2,Fri Jun 5 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"The cheapest starter tables that are commonly recommended are the Uturn Orbit (~$200) or the Audio Technica AT-LP120 (~300). Each have their tradeoffs and, if it were me, I'd shoot for the AT. If you like the look of the Uturn better then use the builder to get the cueing lever and slip mat. You'll also need the preamp unless you have a stereo or receiver that accepts phono level inputs. Let me know if you've got any more questions."
macdemarco,38fv7r,so0o,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:15:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks! They both look pretty good, so I'll just dedicate a little more research between the two. Now I understand how the tables themselves work, but I'm a little confused about preamps and the phono level input compatibility, if you wouldn't mind explaining those for me of course"
macdemarco,38fv7r,so0o,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"Sure. CD players, MP3 players, etc. output signals at ""line level,"" which is simply some standard level of loudness. Turntables are much more sensitive instruments. The audio signal here is generated by a magnetic pickup that senses the movement of a stylus as it tracks the groove in a record. This process results in a much quieter output signal that's referred to as ""phono level."" A preamp takes this phono signal and amplifies it to line level so that it can be properly amplified by your stereo. There's a little more to a preamp than that, such as  equalization and loading, but that's the gist. Vintage receivers generally have these preamps built in, since turntables were the standard music player of that era, but newer stereos don't always accept phono inputs so you have to buy a preamp if your stereo doesn't. The LP120 has a preamp built in so you don't have to worry about it if you get that one. The uturn doesn't have a built in preamp so you will have to buy a separate one if your stereo doesn't have phono inputs."

macdemarco,38azu7,cardenaldana,2,Wed Jun 3 03:54:23 2015 UTC,the thing about mac is that all his songs are catchy...even this song is super catchy hahaha
macdemarco,387gl3,fatso_2000,2,Tue Jun 2 11:57:46 2015 UTC,"Great question. For the first time the other day I was attentively listening to his drum sound and are dry as hell. His snare sounds like your head is inside the drum. I don't know what mics he uses but I'' guess. I know he has an RE20 and those are great on kick drums. You get a real good punch and isolation since it rejects so much off-axis signals. Snare to me sounds like a dry sm57 maybe one on top and one on bottom? Overheads I have no idea. Personally I like AKG c414's if I am in a studio that has them. But I don't own them.   In my band's practice space I have a MXL 990 on the kick, a 991 on the snare and the pencil mics from this Nady drum mic package. I think my practice drums sound better than shit I recorded in studios with much better mics. I do light EQ and compression on them and push some of the snare into an aux channel which is hosting an impulse reverb to make a faux room tone. Pretty basic but it works for me."
macdemarco,387gl3,cboogie,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:30:29 2015 UTC,"Bro, can you elaborate on how to use the RE20 on kick drum? You meant only using the pre-amp?"
macdemarco,387gl3,Vovoir,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:29:43 2015 UTC,Maybe I was not clear but I am referring to an electrovoice re20 mic.

macdemarco,387gl3,Vovoir,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:52:36 2015 UTC,"Thought that too, but in Pepperoni Playboy he has the snare and bass on a separate track to the cymbal. Unless he recorded that in two takes"
macdemarco,387gl3,penismonkeylover,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:20:59 2015 UTC,"A little late, but on the teaser video for the new album he was using a condenser a few inches above the kick drum, which captures a pretty phat sound."
macdemarco,387gl3,yadingus_,0,Sat Jun 6 02:45:55 2015 UTC,I was thinking his too. Maybe he uses drum samples to get that punch the one mic couldn't deliver.

macdemarco,384694,theelmsmusic,5,Mon Jun 1 18:54:52 2015 UTC,I don't think that's what synths mean
macdemarco,384694,throwawaynoop,2,Mon Jun 1 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"What would you call the ambient noise in the background of Sherrill? I'd say it sounds pretty similar to a synth playing the root note of the progression. (I'm just curious, not trying to sound offended)"
macdemarco,384694,iEvn,0,Mon Jun 1 22:33:37 2015 UTC,I always thought those background noises were more natural effects from the analogue mixing rather than synths. When I think about synths I'm usually thinking of a synthetic sound you would find on a lot of keyboards.
macdemarco,384694,throwawaynoop,5,Mon Jun 1 23:53:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm also positive that he uses keyboards/synth on my kind of woman and sherill quite clearly.
macdemarco,384694,hazabaza9,3,Mon Jun 1 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they're just effects, not synths."
macdemarco,384694,camrn,2,Mon Jun 1 19:59:51 2015 UTC,"Well yeah there are synths used on his older stuff too (most notably on My Kind Of Woman which has a synth throughout the whole track) but on Salad Days he began experimenting with them and using them as the forefront of the instrumentals, which is what people usually mean when they mention him using them.  (Also Blue Boy is on Salad Days)"
macdemarco,384694,billmeister123,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:42:58 2015 UTC,I'm almost certain the weird wavy type sound in Sherill is a guitar running through a rack for effects. My Kind of Woman definitley has some keys. The sound you're referring to on Me and Jon sounds like vocals pitch shifted down with lots of reverb. I don't think he uses any keys on RnRNC
macdemarco,384694,regularhuman1,0,Tue Jun 2 18:07:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're synths, Chambers and Pieces are just explicitly synth. Example of Synth he used on 2....not effects"
macdemarco,381y0n,SlinkySlinkster,3,Mon Jun 1 07:05:33 2015 UTC,"Hey,   I got to sit in on Mac's press conference at Primavera Sound on Saturday, some of which I've typed up into my review above.  You don't have to click the link though, you can read it here as well.  There’s no doubting that the guy has charisma, his on stage chatter is part of what has got him so many fans, but it was during these thirty minutes in front of the media that it really shone through. He went into detail about his money stating that now that he has more than he ever thought he would, he still doesn’t buy proper things like clothes and stuff. Instead he opts for really useless things like those inflatable guys whose arms flail about, of which he confessed he has more than he would care to admit.  There was also a tale of how his bassist and guitarist had recently woken up to find one of them being jacked off because he was having a super hot dream. Faux threats as he revealed “that fucking kid that won those shoes never fucking paid. I got his address though. I know he lives in San Jose!”. As well as some details about his forthcoming EP with Mac stating that ""this time, all of the tracks are love songs and they're all very important to me"". He also revealed that there are currently no plans for a fourth record any time soon, blaming it on the fact that he “used to be at home a lot and could do a lot more writing. But for eight months of the year we’re touring now"".  Just thought you may like to know!  Cheers :)"

Realised it was him and joined the crowd waiting for a moment to say hi. In hindsight it all felt very weird, he was just a regular guy, and I lined up after countless selfies to just shake his hand..  My friend asked if he was sticking around in the morning for a surf with us, and he just gave us his email and hotel number and said swing by. Unfortunately we had to leave early morning, and I'm kinda glad cos it would've seemed intrusive.   If I had the situation again and there was a big crowd around him, I wouldn't really bother, but if it's a few people, don't be intimidated or star struck and just say hi. He's a real nice guy"

macdemarco,37vcnr,ldw468,15,Sat May 30 18:34:09 2015 UTC,"I grew up listening to a lot of Dad-rock (Kinks, Beatles, Nilsson, Lennon, McCartney, Hendrix, Steely Dan) and have always kind of wanted some kind of new/modern music that encompasses those artists while also putting a new spin on it. Mac's music is exactly that. My comedic taste have always been very Tim & Eric/Good Neighbor and its obvious Mac's humor encompasses those guys, so his personality has also been a strong reason I've kept my attention to his music and career. His use of YouTube to write songs is also something very modern and new."
macdemarco,37vcnr,Rumsquall,7,Sat May 30 20:09:25 2015 UTC,How does he use YouTube to write songs? I've not heard about this.

My group has always been in love with Mac, singing every one of his songs like in the middle of the class :D So, about his usage of Youtube to make songs... I'd recommend you watch Pepperoni Playboy, a documentary about Mac, his band, his life, how he makes music and how we're a bunch of retards by not buying a mixer and doing like him. At one point of the vid, Mac opens up Youtube on Ryan Paris - Dulce Vita, ""a classic"" from the 80's and tells us in a complex way, his understanding of the song, really cool. Later on he fucks a pinball machine with Brother playing on the background. I'd also recommend you to watch MacDemarco vs his mom, doing a trivia and MacDemarco's What's in My Bag... If you really love Mac, just watch those and thank me later. Bonus: Watch Dave Fuck - Backer :)"
macdemarco,37vcnr,penismonkeylover,2,Sat May 30 22:24:31 2015 UTC,"think he sort of uses youtube like a crate digger. just finds melodies, not samples"
macdemarco,37vcnr,amaralski,3,Sun May 31 09:14:07 2015 UTC,"Last spring when I got into him I was in kind of a tricky patch in my life. I had changed majors twice in the past year, I was getting used to living at home again, and I was set to work two summer jobs I hated. A friend sent me Freaking Out the Neighborhood on spotify one night and the rest is history. I listened to 2 and Salad Days almost every day for the next like 4 months."
macdemarco,37vcnr,cmurda26,2,Mon Jun 1 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"His music and its message at times sits with me and strikes personal notes.  I'm in college while working a dead-end job I hate, and some of the licks in his songs contain this apathy for everything that I feel a lot. Like on Goodbye Weekend or Dreamin', those subtle licks that roll along in the song seem so perfectly uncaring. It's hard to describe i guess. I think Mac's music feels like the soundtrack to my life at times.  I really, really fucking appreciate Mac and I'm glad I discovered his music. He's helped me conceptualize a lot of problems I've had."
macdemarco,37vcnr,GGGareth,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:21:21 2015 UTC,"I started listening to Mac around 3 or 4 months ago. I was in a real weird place at the time and under a lot of stress with college and shit. One night I listened to Salad Days and couldn't believe I had let it slip over my head for so long. After that I saw the video of him performing Still Together with kiki on his shoulders, and after watching Pepperoni Playboy I was sold for life. Any, everything has been going a lot better since I've started listening to Mac. I think it's real important seeing him outside his music. He comes across as so comfortable in is own skin and it's just encouraged me to be myself a lot more. Maybe it's something that comes with age but for now it's going great. I'm really looking forward to hearing Another One. Sweet sweet summer jams, just around the corner."

macdemarco,37trjo,Caldwell35,3,Sat May 30 09:11:14 2015 UTC,Yes! Can't wait
macdemarco,37trjo,_tarasbulba,2,Sat May 30 11:44:49 2015 UTC,Yesss I'm so excited. I went to the forum show in November and loved it so hopefully it won't disappoint
macdemarco,37trjo,secret__tunnel,1 point,Sat May 30 15:28:33 2015 UTC,Yes! On the guestlist :D
macdemarco,37trjo,al3xhanc0ck,1 point,Sat May 30 11:23:09 2015 UTC,What! How did you get on the guest list?
macdemarco,37trjo,al3xhanc0ck,4,Sat May 30 11:44:14 2015 UTC,"Mac stage dived, my leg was caught under where loads of people had fallen over and got injured, Mac came and saw me in the medic room and took me and my mates backstage. Unfortunately we had to leave quite quickly to catch the last train so mac said if we email him we can get on the guestlist for his next London show. So that's what we did! I was so star struck it was surreal. Really looking forward to this show!"
macdemarco,37trjo,shingleding900,2,Sat May 30 14:12:14 2015 UTC,thats wild man haha congrats on the injury i guess.
macdemarco,37trjo,al3xhanc0ck,1 point,Sat May 30 17:07:03 2015 UTC,Haha it was definitely worth it although I did think my leg was gonna snap the way it was bending!
macdemarco,37trjo,billmeister123,0,Sat May 30 17:39:31 2015 UTC,"That's crazy man! It sounds mean, but it was great that you were hurt. I'll try and put myself in a precarious position when he's stage diving so i'll get the same treatment! Does he always meet fans after the show or is it just because you were in the medical room?"
macdemarco,37trjo,al3xhanc0ck,2,Sat May 30 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"hahaha oh man don't injure yourself, i'm sure you will get the opportunity to meet him regardless, he usually hangs out outside the venue after show, well he did last year anyway not sure if he still does ."
macdemarco,37trjo,vfox95,1 point,Sat May 30 20:42:26 2015 UTC,Yeah man he said he usually meet the kids after the show but didn't that time because he met us. I guess it depends on how he's feeling tbh man so I don't think you should actually put yourself in harms way because he may not even visit anyone. It was just a set of great coincidences I think

macdemarco,37lmow,againamind,3,Thu May 28 17:14:11 2015 UTC,I dig all the detailed references to Mac's music videos and Pepperoni Playboy even though it looks like Pete was drawn in instead of Andy lol
macdemarco,37lmow,Dancing_Shell,1 point,Thu May 28 17:46:33 2015 UTC,I think the guy on the left is Andy and the guy to the far right is Joe
macdemarco,37lmow,Rumsquall,1 point,Fri May 29 10:44:50 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that be weird looking at this poster if you were Mac? Like seeing completely of what people's perception are of your character in one picture?

macdemarco,37oqh1,drlemon,6,Fri May 29 05:14:43 2015 UTC,You could use Spotify.
macdemarco,37oqh1,camrn,-5,Fri May 29 05:27:06 2015 UTC,"I don't use spotify, it's bad software  EDIT: But yes, you're right, hence why I feel so bad about asking."
macdemarco,37oqh1,camrn,4,Fri May 29 05:30:01 2015 UTC,"Could you explain why it's ""bad software""?"
macdemarco,37oqh1,Not_an_Author,-4,Fri May 29 05:37:24 2015 UTC,"I don't find it a positive user experience, especially considering I would mostly use it on my iPhone, where, without premium, it is not intuitive or necessarily possible to play a song- you have to shuffle a playlist or an album."
macdemarco,37oqh1,ProfDuude,5,Fri May 29 05:40:09 2015 UTC,"Well, getting premium will get rid of that problem and also help support the artists (although minimally; buying their records/merch is the best way). If you're a student it's 5 a month, definitely affordable for most people."
macdemarco,37oqh1,camrn,-2,Fri May 29 06:56:36 2015 UTC,You aren't wrong but again the software itself isn't pleasant to use.
macdemarco,37oqh1,billmeister123,2,Fri May 29 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"Personally I find spotify great. Buying premium deals with all the problems you listed. Plus spotify has all of macs solo stuff, including the demos. Worth imo."

macdemarco,37csoy,ConfusedCarp,6,Tue May 26 20:40:23 2015 UTC,That's so cool. Are homeshake good live?
macdemarco,37csoy,PerceptionShift,13,Tue May 26 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was sick. I just kind of approached him outside while I was smoking and started talking about music and stuff and we ended up talking for an hour or so. He even pulled out a Mickey of Rum and shared it with me haha. They were amazing live. You know how Mac albums are fairly chill, but he gets faster/rowdier live? Homeshake wasn't like that at all. They sounded exactly like their recordings live. (Not that one is better then the other, just different). But it was cool to just vibe out and feel mellow to such a chill live band."
macdemarco,37csoy,Hippieluver,5,Tue May 26 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"chowder seemed a little faster when i saw him live, still very chill"
macdemarco,37csoy,PerceptionShift,2,Wed May 27 04:34:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're real cool n chill live. Saw them at a breakfast bar in Missouri with Juan Wauters, which you could tell they were like ""we're playing at a fuckin breakfast bar in Missouri"" but they still had a good set and i shared some kicks with Pete for a sec and was glad to see him get the full 20 of my $20 for the special edition LP.  They played a fair bit of new stuff which is real cool and Juan told me the release date for the new record which Im pretty sure he wasn't supposed to.  Final verdict: chillest show I've ever been to"
macdemarco,37csoy,Cletus_Van_Dam,1 point,Wed May 27 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"Well fuck, what's the release date man? That tease is not even fair"

macdemarco,37csoy,BasedLeon,5,Tue May 26 18:05:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's a joke. Mac's gotta be aware that people are watching everything he's in and picking up on subtle shit and what not. This is like the whole ""mac and kiera are broken up"" thing."
macdemarco,37csoy,Dancing_Shell,3,Wed May 27 00:07:07 2015 UTC,"Pete's the man, I'd love for Homeshake to play down here in SoCal but the only places I've seen are NY and Canada"
macdemarco,37csoy,Rumsquall,2,Wed May 27 00:37:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I live in the UK I think it'll probably be a while til homeshake come and all the Mac shows get sold out very quickly. I feel you.
macdemarco,37csoy,Dancing_Shell,2,Wed May 27 21:58:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of sure that Peter is the one who Mac is FaceTiming in the another one promo video. The part where Mac says, ""you hear that? That's Mac piano bitch."" And then I'm assuming Peter is the one that replies, ""ahh I remember it like it was yesterday, you were practicing you scales."" Either I'm right and Mac and Peter are still ""blood brothers"" (as Mac said before) or I'm wrong and they have grown distant."
macdemarco,379z32,gccobra,5,Tue May 26 01:58:20 2015 UTC,"That was a really well-made documentary, I'd like to see more like that!"
macdemarco,379z32,Euphiletus,2,Wed May 27 00:30:28 2015 UTC,I find the past few interviews we've gotten of Mac shows a more mature side. Hes still got that care free attitude as always but he seems more serious about explaining what he's doing and how he's doing it now. It's nice to see him go more in depth then before.
macdemarco,379z32,againamind,1 point,Wed May 27 16:19:49 2015 UTC,I wish he could come again someday. I couldn't see him the two times he came to Chile because I used to live too far away.

Idk if it's just because Captured Tracks hasn't repressed them since the last time they did about 2 months ago. I only see one copy of both Rock and Roll Nightclub and 2 for high price on eBay right now. For Salad Days, Amazon has good prices like someone already mentioned. Try emailing Captured Tracks about the other two albums and see if they're actually out of print forever now."

macdemarco,3790zs,Dancing_Shell,2,Thu May 28 00:28:25 2015 UTC,You could also try /r/vinylcollectors and see if anyone has any copies they're willing to sell or trade.
macdemarco,3790zs,KlokaCola,2,Mon May 25 22:28:58 2015 UTC,"Last thing I heard about RnRNC is that CT is caught up in trying to fix the situation regarding the two missing tracks. Apparently if you ordered through them you can get a 7"" of the missing two. I emailed about it since I bought it from a store and never got a reply.  I'd bet RnRNC will see a repress some day because of the plant fuckup. Don't see why they wouldn't repress the others, they're pure money and they even pressed the demos. Gotta say I'm real happy I bought up all three last year."

Sorry, just a bit confused about what you meant and yeah, you're totally right and same here about already having bought all 3!"

macdemarco,36z53q,nwwazzu,6,Sat May 23 10:23:06 2015 UTC,"As someone whose at least known about him from when he was with makeout videotape, actually bought all his records, seen him in concert a couple times, and has even gotten to chat him up after a show. The Mac man is seriously appreciative of any support whether he's making money at all, he doesn't seem to really care. The man lives for playing music and he's a super down to earth. Point is don't get upset over the ""fanboys/girls"" who, you're right, probably haven't supported him in any real way, but trust that he appreciates it all the same.  Jah bless."
macdemarco,36z53q,chill_man,1 point,Sat May 23 11:07:36 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, and the man is a saint. I know money isn't the focus for him, but at the end of the day, his work wouldn't exist in the capacity that it does today if it were never for sale. Thus, it's only right that people who appreciate it should not only be buying it, but buying it responsibly, only from those amongst whom Mac is the main proprietor."
macdemarco,36z53q,P1zzaBagels,5,Sat May 23 11:55:39 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, (it was me who posted the picture of the shirt) but here some thing from my point of view -   I've bought his records - except Salad Days, I'm yet to find a vinyl copy - I've bought Makeout Videotape via band camp.   I've looked before for a Mac shirt, and there are not many. And, if there are, they're pretty expensive... Not including postage to those of us who live in the middle of nowhere (places where Mac doesn't even tour, I'm in the Highlands of Scotland) so it's tricky to get stuff.   That being said, I'm buying a ticket to a gig of his which is 150 or so miles away later this year. Do they sell shirts at his shows? I don't know. But if they do, I'll be buying one anyway.  But this also makes me think of things like the 'Wonderful World of Mac DeMarco' vinyl box set.   Someone put all the tracks up on this sub and I downloaded it. I haven't bought it. I haven't put ""money in his pocket"". Does that make me a bad fan? I can't afford the damn box set, I can't afford to get it sent overseas etc.   But, the music makes me happy. I absolutely fucking love Mac. I'm sure that even though he's not making money from file-sharing, he's happy that he's making other people happy."
macdemarco,36z53q,ShaqsHouse,2,Sat May 23 11:27:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah they sell shirts; I went to two shows a couple months apart, and there were shirts exclusive to the second show (a specific run of his tour) that weren't at the first, so no doubt I had to pick one up. Also, bring a little extra cash because at least at both of the shows I've been to, they had all of his records and even the cassettes, so that should help in your Salad Days hunt haha"
macdemarco,36z53q,P1zzaBagels,2,Tue May 26 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's awesome. Thanks!"
macdemarco,36z53q,ShaqsHouse,1 point,Tue May 26 19:46:35 2015 UTC,"You're a GREAT fan in his opinion mate if you love his music, and I totally agree that there ain't much out there in terms of good official merchandise. I hate the ""mad magazine"" shirt they have on the site quite frankly, but I'm tempted to buy it still because I DO want a mac demarco shirt. The reason not much is available is simply because the label cannot afford to produce loads of shirts and incur all of those overhead costs. Putting together a world tour is expensive as tits, especially if you're a label not many people have heard of. The main thing I was trying to drive home in my post was that we need to be aware as fans and not put our money in the wrong hands if we want to obtain anything related to Mac Demarco and his brand.   Edit-  Yes they do sell shirts at concerts, exclusive ones you can only get from shows. That's the traditional way to buy band merchandise anyway--at the show."

macdemarco,365hf6,EddyForeskin,1 point,Sat May 16 12:44:12 2015 UTC,I've think that it's just from redlining the cassette multitrack he recorded on? It would explain the quality of the whole recording haha.

macdemarco,35z76f,willison1096,7,Thu May 14 19:15:51 2015 UTC,"it sounds like there might be some weird samples thrown in there on RNRNC and Ying Yang, maybe a full kit (hi hat/bass/snare/hi-lo tom/ride-crash) on a couple songs.  But I think on most of the RNRNC songs, and all of Ying Yang, and definitely all of Bossa Yeye he's playing standing drums- snare, a cymbal and a floor tom and some other percussion thrown in there. That drum set up shows up on The Stars Keep Calling My Name I think too- It sounds like he's killed the resonance of the tom with a shirt or something and then EQ'd/mixed the bass on that mic up a bit to get more of a bass drum vibe.  If you listen closely to the fills on RNRNC and Stars Keep Calling My Name you hear that drum being rolled on a couple times in a way that the full kit songs don't.  When he plays fills on other songs like Robson he doesn't have the toms open either, kinda like Come Together.  He's also doing lots of sexy compression and pitch stuff too."
macdemarco,35z76f,relaxedfitkhakis,1 point,Thu May 14 23:29:27 2015 UTC,"I came to say standing kit as well, Makeout Videotape used that set up extensively, so it isn't much of a stretch to assume it's the same for RNRNC as it's around the same sort of time period, there's definitely a tambourine thrown in the mix too. I imagine there's a lot of varispeed manipulation thrown in there on RNRNC as well, along with recording at a slower IPS or maybe even using lower quality tape, which could explain why the drums sound the way they do."
macdemarco,35z76f,memorium,2,Sun May 17 15:47:18 2015 UTC,"I think on RNRNC they sound so strange because he seems to have slowed the whole tape machine down so the pitch is all weird. However, on 2 and Salad Days I think the guitar tracks are slowed but the drums seem normal. Ying Yang to me is just lo fi so the drums are just badass, his set up sounds like a kick drum, snare and tambourine/hihat basically!"
macdemarco,35z76f,hazabaza9,1 point,Thu May 14 21:34:35 2015 UTC,I swear I remember in his AMA he said he used a drum machine thing for some of his tracks (might not be from Rock n Roll Nightclub tho) because the neighbours were pissed off with his drumming (haha)?

macdemarco,35rqch,Lingua_Franca2,17,Tue May 12 23:27:57 2015 UTC,"So in March, Pierce and Joe stayed with us at our place while they were going through to SXSW. I brought up the chance that we could hang with them when they play with Mac at Levitation in Austin, Texas. We kept in touch and he submitted the request. We were given the deluxe wrist bands from them for free and after one of the best shows I've been to, Pierce got us backstage and we hung with the dudes! We got trashed off of free Dos Equis and just had some major chillage with Mac. We had our moments, and then we had some more, and it was great.   At one point the chest ran out of beer so Joe and I went on a raid to other bands' ice chests and got a few from Fat White Family. That wasn't enough so we did a daring attempt on the Flaming Lips' trailer only to be met with a metric fuck ton of people hanging in there. Surprisingly, the security apologized to US for not having enough beer on hand at that time, refilled our ice chest, and gave me two more free drink vouchers on the stipulation that I don't steal beer from the other bands.   A lot happened and it was all a great time, honestly one of the coolest nights of my life. And to top it all off, Mac gave me a pair of new $100 Converses that he didn't want! It was everything I had hoped for and so much more!"
macdemarco,35rqch,jonjonman,12,Tue May 12 23:38:23 2015 UTC,Damn man. Sounds amazing. And the shoes? Mac is the nicest fucking rockstar ever.  Jeez
macdemarco,35rqch,Rumsquall,3,Wed May 13 00:23:11 2015 UTC,Cool post and thanks for following through! I have a question though. Did they seem genuinely interested to hang with you guys or did it seem like they were just kind of paying their debts :D?
macdemarco,35rqch,jbp1993,2,Wed May 13 02:24:38 2015 UTC,They genuinely chilled. Joe and Pierce knew us so we had a reunited point and just had a great time. We plan on chilling again when they go through Tuscon later this year!

macdemarco,35q2ie,anomynoms,1 point,Wed May 13 05:05:49 2015 UTC,"Great! Except I think the chord you're looking for in the chorus (the one after the C#m7) is an augmented C chord (C, E, G#) with an open D under it, and the G# (on top) leading up from an F#. Weird I know, but it seems to sound right. I'm no good at tabs, so I'll just write:  Open D string, ring and pinky on 5th fret, pointer/middle getting that F# to G# on top. And I think an Amaj7 is actually played after that, but a regular A works too. All of this relevant to the capo on the 4th fret, of course."
macdemarco,35q2ie,BeanRaider,1 point,Wed May 13 23:13:24 2015 UTC,I'll have a go at that when I'm home after work and make the changes to tab!
macdemarco,35lqav,staniks,13,Mon May 11 15:17:56 2015 UTC,"I like it. I can't say I love it, but I've been jonesin' for new Mac and this will do."
macdemarco,35lqav,JDBringley,6,Mon May 11 15:23:02 2015 UTC,"Same here. Solo at the end was awesome though. I'm really anticipating ""I've Been Waiting For Her"", it sounded awesome in the promo video."
macdemarco,35lqav,Cletus_Van_Dam,4,Mon May 11 16:22:57 2015 UTC,"Is that the one with the ""Jerry Garcia"" solo?"
macdemarco,35lqav,CarlsInTheHouse,2,Mon May 11 17:42:00 2015 UTC,"Haha I think so. The one where Mac is recording the vocals and keeps singing ""Believe meeee"". Some great person on youtube did a little loop so we can get an idea of what it sounds like and I love it."
macdemarco,35lqav,Cletus_Van_Dam,2,Mon May 11 20:42:27 2015 UTC,"That sounds pretty good. I'm really looking forward to hearing the entire album. The song I was referring to is called ""Just Put Me Down""."
macdemarco,35lqav,CarlsInTheHouse,12,Tue May 12 04:14:16 2015 UTC,"Sounds a little filler-ish for a single, definitely a grower though.  edit: knew it, love it already"
macdemarco,35lqav,vfox95,7,Mon May 11 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know what I was expecting but something took me by surprise. This is definitely a grower, each time just gets better."
macdemarco,35lqav,PeterTheFirst,2,Mon May 11 16:39:04 2015 UTC,"agreed. didn't really dig it on the first listen, and now it's on repeat."
macdemarco,35lqav,photric,8,Wed May 13 00:41:20 2015 UTC,Why is the panning so damn weird?
macdemarco,35lqav,Cuntosaurus,1 point,Mon May 11 19:11:08 2015 UTC,"That's the thing that makes me enjoy this song a lot less. The drums completely panned to the right ear is so annoying, especially with headphones"
macdemarco,35lqav,GraphicNomad,10,Sun May 24 07:29:45 2015 UTC,This song is giving me those classic Mac vibes
macdemarco,35lqav,ProfDuude,2,Mon May 11 16:10:57 2015 UTC,"i thought that then realized what is ""classic mac""? With 3 (available) projects and none really sounding that similar to each other what would you consider ""classic mac""?"
macdemarco,35lqav,adamsandleryabish,3,Tue May 12 04:03:57 2015 UTC,Chorus pedal. It sounds like everything is underwater. Love song.
macdemarco,35lqav,ProfDuude,2,Tue May 12 14:11:44 2015 UTC,Yeah it felt like a song from Salad Days with the feel of a song off of 2.
macdemarco,35lqav,MiStOrHoTsHoT,3,Mon May 11 16:50:31 2015 UTC,"I got some Rock and Roll nightclub vibes, musically."
macdemarco,35lqav,spookyscaryskeleton2,6,Tue May 12 08:49:13 2015 UTC,"I just saw him at austin psych fest last night, the new song comes out today and tour is extended, best 24 hours of my life."
macdemarco,35lqav,Hibew,5,Mon May 11 16:03:06 2015 UTC,"I dig it. Going far in his jangly/detuned aesthetic, I really like it. 4th bar of the verse is so whacky"
macdemarco,35lqav,willison1096,4,Mon May 11 16:04:12 2015 UTC,"wow this is amazing. The only song i wanted to hear off the album first hand was this song, and its so groovy you cant help but smile. The man is a master at music and this song proves it"
macdemarco,35lqav,camrn,3,Mon May 11 20:33:06 2015 UTC,Lmao just yesterday I was thinking if Mac would release a single from the album soon.
macdemarco,35lqav,Aesop_Socks,3,Mon May 11 17:46:50 2015 UTC,Loving this right now. People have high expectations of Mac. Dude has been on a never ending tour and he still dropped a mini album. Lets be happy he's putting out new music.
macdemarco,35lqav,Pigfloop,2,Tue May 12 00:27:55 2015 UTC,Oah sick!!
macdemarco,35lqav,burritodude17,2,Mon May 11 15:30:33 2015 UTC,digging it
macdemarco,35lqav,iwikmu,2,Mon May 11 15:31:53 2015 UTC,It's something like RnR and Salad Days.
macdemarco,35lqav,jbp1993,2,Mon May 11 16:49:31 2015 UTC,It's sick.
macdemarco,35lqav,ShineOnYouFatOldSun,2,Mon May 11 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"love, Love, LOVE IT!   More please!"
macdemarco,35lqav,nidenikolev,2,Mon May 11 22:02:20 2015 UTC,That solo is pretty sick!
macdemarco,35lqav,BeanRaider,4,Tue May 12 08:50:49 2015 UTC,"Not really impressed at all by this. I mean, it's not a bad song, but come on... We've heard II and Salad Days and this is just kind of boring. I really feel that mac hit his groove with songs like ""chamber of reflection"" and ""passing out pieces."" I'm kind of bored hearing the same recycled sounds in a different key. Have a feeling that this mini-LP is going to be disappointing because it seems rushed.  I wanna hear more experimentation with synth sounds!"
macdemarco,35lqav,viceroy-boy,1 point,Tue May 12 04:09:02 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't synthy, but in a lot of interviews he's been in he was talking about how he's blown loads of money on new synthesisers, so maybe the rest of his album will have synths on."
macdemarco,35lqav,chil7,2,Fri May 15 17:22:35 2015 UTC,my ears have been transported to this little place i like to call heaven
macdemarco,35lqav,eggsmith,0,Mon May 11 16:53:47 2015 UTC,"This one is pretty good, but I'm expecting a lot more from the rest of the album. If you remember, the song ""Brother"" was the first recorded single released for Salad Days, which was just an ok song compared to many other tracks on that album. Hopefully more good things to come!"
macdemarco,35lqav,pharoahfawcett,8,Mon May 11 17:21:20 2015 UTC,No it was Passing Out Pieces
macdemarco,35lqav,jbp1993,1 point,Mon May 11 17:23:28 2015 UTC,"like the lyrics, i was afraid it would he'd be bland desimilarco by now but this was pretty good. just wish he would shake up that sound a little more pleaaaaseee"
macdemarco,35lqav,Larsamin,5,Mon May 11 18:18:26 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with him keeping this sound. Don't get me wrong I think it's cool when he's tried different things (Chamber of Reflection is probably my favorite Mac song) but when I listen to Mac DeMarco it's just because I want some good tunes, not ground breaking shit."
macdemarco,35lqsn,unEquals,11,Mon May 11 15:21:44 2015 UTC,"I just discovered this artist last month and I'm absolutely in love with his music, i didn't even know there was a sub for him."
macdemarco,35lqsn,Ryan7074,9,Mon May 11 16:11:15 2015 UTC,Welcome friend
macdemarco,35lqsn,srekcornaivaf,3,Mon May 11 18:53:45 2015 UTC,Thanks!
macdemarco,35lqsn,Ryan7074,12,Mon May 11 19:14:10 2015 UTC,"Really was hoping to hear at least a slight departure from his ""easily listening songs"". Aside from the synthesizers on Salad Days, I feel like that entire album and this song all sound like they could be outtakes from 2.  I get that he has a style, and I love his style. just sharing an honest opinion.  Viva la Mac!"
macdemarco,35lqsn,PersonWithASelf,6,Mon May 11 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"I heard in a few interviews he said that he's been really getting into his synths, and plans to use them heavily in another one. so i hope that that means we get to hear some new interesting songs along with stuff like this, y'know classic mac."
macdemarco,35lqsn,cooperJEDI,1 point,Mon May 11 18:17:40 2015 UTC,for sure dude! and I of course didn't mean this song release makes me not excited for the new album. i'm really excited for it... maybe some other songs will be really synth heavy. we'll see!
macdemarco,35lqsn,PersonWithASelf,2,Mon May 11 18:19:30 2015 UTC,oh me neither i've been listening to this on repeat for the last hour
macdemarco,35lqsn,cooperJEDI,2,Mon May 11 18:22:16 2015 UTC,"I also want Mac to move away from his soft rock style, but it's because I loved Salad Days so much, not because I disliked it. I think he mastered the sound on that record. No he needs to move forward, I think, either going deeper into synths or in a new direction entirely. Even if he doesn't I'll still probably dig Another One, I just won't be as excited for it as I would otherwise."
macdemarco,35lqsn,hahaijoinedreddit,5,Tue May 12 04:08:23 2015 UTC,"i'm getting moderate MV vibes from this, and I dig it. also dat guitar solo @ 1:50."
macdemarco,35lqsn,bee-juice,6,Mon May 11 16:13:55 2015 UTC,Omg. He's coming to Houston. Yeeeaaahh boiii
macdemarco,35lqsn,Obviouslynotafaggot,3,Mon May 11 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"Anyone near Milwaukee should see him at the Pabst. It's an old Vaudeville theater that's been restored.   Also, it's a huge theater for him to headline. I absolutely cannot wait.   Plus, really cheap beer."
macdemarco,35lqsn,Shut_Up_Dude,2,Mon May 11 22:01:20 2015 UTC,Has anyone else seen that Another One has just disappeared from the Australian iTunes?

macdemarco,35icoa,jabacn,3,Mon May 11 13:05:27 2015 UTC,Pierce should sing more. :D
macdemarco,35icoa,iwikmu,1 point,Mon May 11 13:23:55 2015 UTC,He did this at psychfest because mac couldn't get his guitar going the entire set. I was pretty upset with the set overall. Wasn't high enough I guess.
macdemarco,35icoa,MontyG58,1 point,Mon May 11 21:27:33 2015 UTC,"Dude, that set was great. You didn't like when Pierce did the Troll 2 ""Oh my Gooooooooooooooood"" thing and everyone joined in, creating this huge droning chant thing that lasted like 40 seconds? Or how they covered Reelin' in the Years? Or how Andy was being super patronizing to the crowd, but in a fun way? I've seen Mac before and they were as good this time as they've ever been."
macdemarco,35icoa,DeanPortman,1 point,Tue May 12 13:01:40 2015 UTC,You couldn't even hear Mac half of the time and he was messing with his guitar every single song because his background was way louder than him. And he was patronizing the crowd because the crowd was getting annoyed with all of the sound difficulties.
macdemarco,35icoa,MontyG58,1 point,Tue May 12 14:11:44 2015 UTC,"True, there were some sound difficulties. Like Pierce's bass was waaaay louder than everything else. Anyway, maybe me glazing over that is a testament to how well they can carry a show despite technical difficulties?"
macdemarco,35icoa,DeanPortman,1 point,Tue May 12 16:04:55 2015 UTC,It was definitely still entertaining I guess I'm just upset because I blew a lot of money just to see Mac and all we got was like 7 songs that you could barely hear him on. His solos were amazing because he was the only one playing so the background wasn't interfering.
macdemarco,35fbbb,jbp1993,17,Sat May 9 20:15:33 2015 UTC,I was there and I'm positive that it didn't happen. Julian simply gave a shoutout to Mac around the same time they played last nite.
macdemarco,35fbbb,randomenchilada,3,Sun May 10 04:17:53 2015 UTC,That make me feel better about leaving on Friday during the strokes. I was so pissed when I got to the fest yesterday and everyone was talking about Mac playing with them.
macdemarco,35fbbb,pandassrkewl,3,Sun May 10 12:57:23 2015 UTC,"You know, I thought it was pretty weird that it didn't happen, considering pitchfork and others were reporting it. And now, they edited the post now that they've found the full video, and it's obvious as hell Mac isn't up there. Agnes even reposted this too!! Everyone got me excited for nothing :/"
macdemarco,35fbbb,jonjonman,5,Sun May 10 17:48:07 2015 UTC,"Damn, it didn't happen. Oh well, still cool he got a shout out."

macdemarco,35723p,ShaqsHouse,3,Fri May 8 20:23:41 2015 UTC,I'm excited for the song at the end of Instagram post. The melody reminds me of Everything Means Nothing to Me by Elliot Smith

macdemarco,354y8f,h_h_heathen,18,Thu May 7 03:32:23 2015 UTC,"might be an unpopular thing to say but i'm not a big fan of his playing style. maybe it's just that i got so used to homeshake's sweet licks that andy doesn't do much for me. idk, to each their own i guess."
macdemarco,354y8f,iamscot,10,Thu May 7 12:52:53 2015 UTC,"Can't lie, I miss Pete too, but Andy seems like a sweet guy. I was just really struck by Andy's creativity with the delay pedal/maybe some other pedals for this performance. Granted, I'm no guitar aficionado."
macdemarco,354y8f,iamscot,5,Thu May 7 17:49:20 2015 UTC,"I guess it's all about personal preference, y'know? I suppose that any time there's a line-up change in a creative project the fan base is going to be divided. I definitely admire andy as a guitarist, he's very good, I just prefer pete :)"
macdemarco,354y8f,Blade686,6,Thu May 7 18:13:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah same here. I love Andy and I've fallen in love with Tonstartssbandht and Andy Boay over the last year but I think pete just fit better with Mac's sound. I think Mac likes that he isn't the only attention grabbing performer now, though. Pierce will dick around a bit but Pete mostly just stood off to the side, playing those sweet licks in a foggy haze."
macdemarco,354y8f,iamscot,3,Thu May 7 22:20:53 2015 UTC,"Amen, brother.   edit: /sister. Sorry, I was channeling what I thought Mac would say in that situation."

macdemarco,354y8f,ubermencher,1 point,Sun May 10 13:34:37 2015 UTC,"while I kind of agree, it's not that big of a deal. I rarely listen to them live, so most of the time I'm getting straight up Mac.   think I remember mac saying something about how they take live shows as fun/a laugh and don't really care about perfection more about having a good carefree time. to have andy messing about in his solos or even his style accommodates that attitude  just for perspective - to play the same set list of songs over and over must wear a band down to some extent. having this new dynamic to their songs must be refreshing for them at least"
macdemarco,354y8f,harrythemay,2,Fri May 8 10:46:42 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. Pete had the perfect ""sloppy shredding"" style. I feel like Andy tries to do the same sloppy thing but he just doesn't have the chops/know-how that Pete had. I think the reason he falls short is because, Mac uses a lot of weird jazzy suspended chords in his songs and Pete knew how to use those chords in his solos. Andy's solos contain more straight major or minor chords with a few out-of-key notes sprinkled in in an attempt to get that sloppy slacker sound Pete nailed, but it just doesn't sound right."
macdemarco,354y8f,iamscot,5,Thu May 7 15:16:26 2015 UTC,"Andy absolutely has the chops, he just is trying to push the sloppy fun aspect most of the time. Listen to Tonstartssbandht if you want confirmation"
macdemarco,354y8f,PersonWithASelf,3,Fri May 8 00:31:08 2015 UTC,Here is Andy's cover of a Sean Nicholas Savage song called 'Misery Mountain' (listen to the original to hear the complete difference too.) He definitely has the chops.
macdemarco,354y8f,eggsmith,-1,Fri May 8 00:49:44 2015 UTC,"well put my man.  it's super dumb of me to point all this out though cuz i did just shell out like 20 quid to go see him in september, when he will no doubt still have andy with him. w/e, as long as pierce is there it's all gravy"
macdemarco,354y8f,jonfromdelocated,4,Thu May 7 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"lol. he also played ""How soon is now"" by the smiths, or at least teased it for a second there. neat!"
macdemarco,354y8f,eggsmith,4,Thu May 7 21:16:47 2015 UTC,"I'm tellin ya, he's like the greatest guitarist in the world"

macdemarco,351ijo,Haydenb28,6,Wed May 6 09:36:26 2015 UTC,I think it would be just a LP/CD/maybe cassette thing. I don't think it will be on itunes since its already on bandcamp but who knows.
macdemarco,351ijo,BasedLeon,3,Wed May 6 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as far as I know, the only thing that's been said is that there's going to be a reissue. Haven't announced through what medium. One of Mac's friends who's retouching the album cover mentioned it first on instagram."
macdemarco,351ijo,Dancing_Shell,2,Wed May 6 12:04:48 2015 UTC,"I was doubting whether it is actually happening because it was Mac's friend who posted the picture but Captured Tracks re posted saying 'what is this?' Implying that they don't know about it, and it will be down to them what Mac releases I'd think?"
macdemarco,351ijo,hazabaza9,2,Wed May 6 19:14:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah but he posted a video and implied that he has his own record label. video Note the description says June 2015, if you go onto his channel it says ""THURSDAY FRIDAY RECORDS"" that links to a page with the video embedded."
macdemarco,351ijo,aspl,1 point,Wed May 6 20:48:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I saw the videos but they are old videos from when it was initially released and he has a label apparently but Mac will still have a contract with CT and they wouldn't wanna miss out on the money of a reissue.
macdemarco,351ijo,hazabaza9,2,Wed May 6 21:31:28 2015 UTC,"Yah but Makeout Videotape is separate though, so surely they don't have a contract over that work since I don't think it's just macs work? Also if it helps, I'm friends with him on facebook and he posted asking for pictures of mac from the makeout videotape days... which is also how I got hold of that picture of him I posted a while ago on here :)"
macdemarco,351ijo,aspl,1 point,Wed May 6 22:05:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah maybe so, I still think captured tracks will have the say as they're the bigger label (more money etc) than whoever released Makeout Videotape. Captured tracks have also put out Only You on vinyl around the time 2 got released."
macdemarco,351ijo,hazabaza9,1 point,Tue May 12 18:28:49 2015 UTC,"Hmm, dunno. I suppose we'll see in a few months time :) Maybe chaz is now working for Captured Tracks, or he's involved in the process? Eitherway, I'm still psyched since I love MV so I can't wait for it to be on record!"
macdemarco,351ijo,aspl,1 point,Tue May 12 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fingers crossed they release something.  I'd love any MV on vinyl!"
macdemarco,351ijo,hazabaza9,1 point,Tue May 12 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"I think it would be unlikely that Makeout Videotape come under Mac's contract, from what I can tell Captured Tracks mostly work with new artists."

If I didn't see this link from an exclusive Mac Demarco source I would have no clue as to what or who this poster was for"
macdemarco,34ucuu,diltay,4,Mon May 4 22:20:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Although, if I saw that tooth-gap I'd just assume it was Mac."

macdemarco,34nzoy,Dancing_Shell,5,Sat May 2 22:36:28 2015 UTC,One of the first serious interviews I have seen of Mac.
macdemarco,34nmrp,iimalteaserii,1 point,Sat May 2 20:36:15 2015 UTC,"Nice man. I've been playing guitar in a very amateur way for the past few years (mainly power chords and just basic stuff, writing my own little riffs nothing major) but I've since started trying to learn all the proper chords. ""Only You"" is a great song to start with, as the progression is all pretty basic and easy to follow but that C minor chord is a pain in my ass."

macdemarco,34g20q,dangranger92,3,Thu Apr 30 21:27:29 2015 UTC,Don't go tellin me how this boy should be leading his own life
macdemarco,34g20q,BasedGodIsJesus,19,Fri May 1 05:51:21 2015 UTC,I do love the part where he just whales on Robson Girl
macdemarco,34g20q,Hesher1,4,Thu Apr 30 22:35:56 2015 UTC,"At first I thought that one was weird, but I shortly came to really like it! The guitar all throughout that song is stellar."
macdemarco,34g20q,ShaqsHouse,3,Thu Apr 30 23:26:51 2015 UTC,"that was actually my favorite song by mac when i first started listening to him, because it was one of his more actual rock n roll songs, just how noisey and rough it was, loved it and still do!"
macdemarco,34g20q,KlokaCola,2,Fri May 1 06:11:31 2015 UTC,There's an awesome part in the solo where he's hammering away on the guitar but you can still make out a sweet melody in his chords.
macdemarco,34g20q,howdyeveryday,2,Fri May 1 06:19:30 2015 UTC,"It's such a good song, I remember hearing it and thinking how the hell he came up with the guitar part. While we're on the topic, anybody have any ideas where the name ""Robson Girl"" came from? I've always wondered"
macdemarco,34g20q,gccobra,3,Fri May 1 19:28:00 2015 UTC,My impression is that Robson is the name of a street where a girl is from. Maybe she was hard to reach cause her daddy was hella strict.
macdemarco,34g20q,aspl,10,Sat May 2 01:16:09 2015 UTC,This solo Pete does live for Let Her Go is crazy.
macdemarco,34g20q,ShaqsHouse,6,Thu Apr 30 21:32:13 2015 UTC,Pete's style complements Mac's so well. These two are gold together.
macdemarco,34g20q,preikestolen,3,Fri May 1 01:31:18 2015 UTC,"I watched the whole set, it was awesome! Let Her Go solo was sick."
macdemarco,34g20q,ShaqsHouse,5,Fri May 1 05:50:55 2015 UTC,"the solo at the end of ""Because im a Boy"" is pretty tight"
macdemarco,34g20q,preikestolen,3,Thu Apr 30 21:15:54 2015 UTC,"Not really a song, but live, this is my favourite. They usually do covers of songs, and this is my favourite by far :D The taking care of business solo-y bit btw"
macdemarco,34g20q,ShaqsHouse,3,Thu Apr 30 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"hmm, never seen joe with short hair"
macdemarco,34g20q,jbp1993,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:38:26 2015 UTC,"During ""I'm A Man"" in the same set, Mac and Pete slightly mess up the solo, and it's awesome"
macdemarco,34g20q,Derpabo,4,Fri May 1 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"Stars Keep on Calling My Name probably, but that beginning to the non-demo version of Annie gets me everytime."
macdemarco,34g20q,MiStOrHoTsHoT,2,Fri May 1 00:33:37 2015 UTC,"Lonely Shredder, the demo version of Ode to Viceroy, as well as Harrison Ford Escort, the demo version of Freaking Out the Neighborhood, are two of my favorites off that demo tape."
macdemarco,34g20q,Tokentime96,2,Fri May 1 05:58:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, but parts of the ""Annie"" intro remind me so much of SRV"
macdemarco,34g20q,Tokentime96,1 point,Fri May 1 19:42:19 2015 UTC,Yeah no doubt.  I could listen to the first 30sec on repeat haha.
macdemarco,34g20q,jyyack,3,Fri May 1 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"The ""Ode to Viceroy"" solo was what got me hooked on Mac, and even though it's (arguably) his most recognizable song, it's been my favorite since then. Also, I love the way Pete plays this version of ""RNRNC,"" it's one of the cleaner ones I've heard (not that the sloppy ones aren't any good). Mac and the boys just shred"
macdemarco,34g20q,shingleding900,2,Fri May 1 19:48:17 2015 UTC,Moving Like Mike is pretty dope
macdemarco,34g20q,GupNasty,3,Thu Apr 30 23:52:51 2015 UTC,Definitely! I also like the solo in Me and Jon Hangin On

macdemarco,34djz0,zeke_24,6,Thu Apr 30 07:41:40 2015 UTC,my two favorite artists of the past couple years. glad the hear they were hanging at coachella.  do a collab already! i dont even know what it would sound like...probably pure sex.
macdemarco,34djz0,moodyfloyd,2,Thu Apr 30 14:42:19 2015 UTC,haha. That would be a amazing song. Jizz-Jazz psychedelic-ish?? I would totally be down for that. I would love to see them together on stage.
macdemarco,34bz2l,Rumsquall,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:50:41 2015 UTC,Mac kind of looks like Tim Heidecker in this

macdemarco,34ci9x,Dancing_Shell,13,Thu Apr 30 01:25:13 2015 UTC,pretty sure its just his second release as mac demarco
macdemarco,34ci9x,eggsmith,13,Thu Apr 30 01:45:46 2015 UTC,"yeah id agree with this, i dont think mac is too big on creating album names. His titles are simple, pretty sure he named the new album another because it is... another one"
macdemarco,34ci9x,willison1096,6,Thu Apr 30 01:52:53 2015 UTC,"I think its just an homage to the many bands in the 70s who would name their 2nd album ""2"""

macdemarco,3487hb,pharoahfawcett,4,Wed Apr 29 15:36:17 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I've had a hunch for some time that Mac leaked it himself. Call me crazy, but hear me out. That free album gained him a lot of fans, and attention, leading to a very successful international tour. I feel if it weren't for the leaked album, he may not be as known as he is."
macdemarco,3487hb,_Negrodamus_,3,Wed Apr 29 03:08:39 2015 UTC,"thats what i thought too but didnt wanna say it...i mean who else would leak it am i right? plus in interviews hes kind of stunned when they ask about the leak, kinda looks guilty"

macdemarco,3487hb,anjrou,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:57:32 2015 UTC,"Also he said in an interview that he resented having to do a ""catchy"" song like Let Her Go, and it was the only song missing from the initial leak. I feel like he could've easily released the album himself for that reason."

Seemed like a few people either thought being pushed around was a personal attack or that the goal was to thrash everyone around you with a beer and a lit ciggy. Such are the woes of a growing fan base, I guess. Maybe next year, if he's back in Van, I'll try to catch it from a further distance, though I did get a good handfull of Mac's gooch when he was crowd surfing."

macdemarco,33ho8z,aspl,2,Wed Apr 22 16:33:27 2015 UTC,Mac did say something about it in his AMA. I wouldn't get too high hopes for it happening though.
macdemarco,33ho8z,Kjeng,2,Wed Apr 22 18:41:44 2015 UTC,It's definitely being put out by CT
macdemarco,33e9nq,viceroy-boy,8,Tue Apr 21 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"Seeing him tonight in Eugene, Oregon, then tomorrow in Portland. Saw him this summer in Seattle, and probably gonna go see him again at Outside Lands this summer. That's 4 times in 12 months. Hey Tony"
macdemarco,33e9nq,poop_dat_corn,2,Tue Apr 21 22:48:07 2015 UTC,I'll be at the show tomorrow!
macdemarco,33e9nq,preikestolen,5,Tue Apr 21 23:14:19 2015 UTC,"I drove down to NYC the first weekend of college just to see him at CT5. I also drove to Montreal twice that school year to see him - a total of 30 hours driving haha. Also, the first time I saw him, my family and I just happened to be on vacation in LA when he was playing the Echoplex so of course I made my dad drive me. Seen him 6 times total"
macdemarco,33e9nq,eggsmith,3,Tue Apr 21 22:25:26 2015 UTC,"Saw him both nights when he played the Fonda in Los Angeles. Was real happy too, because night 2 was a lot more rambunctious and he played rock and roll night club, yeah baby."
macdemarco,33e9nq,jonjonman,3,Tue Apr 21 22:39:55 2015 UTC,I went with my friends band on tour and they opened up for Mac two states away... Saw him play once and hung out with him for a few hours. He got us a hotel room!
macdemarco,33e9nq,BasedLeon,4,Wed Apr 22 01:57:19 2015 UTC,"When he played two shows in one night in Chicago, I went to both.  It was a great 5 hours of Mac."
macdemarco,33e9nq,Shut_Up_Dude,3,Tue Apr 21 20:50:44 2015 UTC,he opened for Julian Casablancas here in Seattle. Then closed out another show later that night & best believe i hit both.
macdemarco,33e9nq,MiilkyJoe,2,Tue Apr 21 22:06:21 2015 UTC,"Saw him at the Metro in Sydney one night, and then at a festival the next day.   Was a mac-gical few days."

macdemarco,335pnt,TooManyBoxes,3,Mon Apr 20 01:45:25 2015 UTC,Aww yeah.
macdemarco,335pnt,iwikmu,12,Mon Apr 20 13:09:12 2015 UTC,"im personally really excited for one of his songs that we heard through the instagram post. i think the lyrics were ""just to put me down"" followed by a catchy little melody right after. i hope he does more fast music, when he said it was gonna sound more like 2, im guessing its gonna be a bit faster with the same tone as salad days"
macdemarco,335pnt,willison1096,3,Sun Apr 19 20:37:15 2015 UTC,"really reminded me of some john lennon yoko ono band type stuff, sounds so smooth. wrapping up the summer with fresh mac is going to feel so great."
macdemarco,335pnt,viceroy-boy,9,Mon Apr 20 16:54:10 2015 UTC,"i'm hoping for more of a crispy sound, kinda like 2."
macdemarco,335pnt,gccobra,7,Sun Apr 19 21:10:39 2015 UTC,"Even though he said it's going to be more like 2, I hope that still means this albums gonna include some more synth tunes. Nonetheless, I'll be super stoked for whatever he releases. Maybe some of the synthy sounds from SD mixed into the more rocking vibes of 2? I just figured there'd be more synths since he's acquired so many and he said he would put them to use for the upcoming album."
macdemarco,335pnt,Dancing_Shell,8,Sun Apr 19 21:41:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I thought. If there's even one track that sounds like Chamber/Pieces, I'll be happy."
macdemarco,335pnt,XDMacintosh,3,Sun Apr 19 21:43:35 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, synth is what hoping for in his next album."
macdemarco,335pnt,cregger,4,Mon Apr 20 00:22:00 2015 UTC,rock n roll nightclub style. with synths. wonky and psychedelic... yet catchy. alot more funky.

macdemarco,335pnt,leavehouse,4,Mon Apr 20 19:45:16 2015 UTC,I feel like things are gonna get interesting in the steely dam sort of way
macdemarco,335pnt,cmurda26,3,Mon Apr 20 05:10:07 2015 UTC,Something that sits perfectly in-between 'My Kind of Woman' and 'Chamber of Reflection' is all I ask for.
macdemarco,335pnt,willison1096,3,Mon Apr 20 10:10:32 2015 UTC,When did he actually have time to record? Hasn't he been on tour since Salad Days dropped?
macdemarco,335pnt,LG34-,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:51:32 2015 UTC,december or something. he had to have enough time to buy those inflatable things infront of his house lol
macdemarco,335pnt,SpectacularRainbows,2,Mon Apr 20 20:40:11 2015 UTC,"i really want more stuff like chamber of reflection, i absolutely love the '80s' sound and the synths"
macdemarco,335pnt,viceroy2,2,Tue Apr 21 01:51:11 2015 UTC,"As much as everyone is saying they want some sound from 2 or Salad Days, I'd like to see him expand his sound and continue to grow.  If I want to hear 2 I'll listen to 2."

macdemarco,32wb16,eggsmith,14,Sat Apr 18 21:50:13 2015 UTC,Wow I'm super excited. That also coincides with a plausible release for the Makeout Videotape reissue. Though I'm not surprised they won't be playing them soon
macdemarco,32wb16,Barnables,6,Fri Apr 17 06:50:14 2015 UTC,I just saw that. THAT'S AMAZING!! That's one of the best MV albums for sure. It's like we get two in one. It's christmas.
macdemarco,32wb16,viceroy-boy,3,Fri Apr 17 06:54:42 2015 UTC,It'd be sweet if they also did like a double EP 1xLP disc of Heat Wave and Eating Like a Kid. I personally don't care much for the other ones except for Ying Yang lol
macdemarco,32wb16,jadborn,3,Fri Apr 17 07:00:22 2015 UTC,But Bossa Yeye (the acoustic one) is so good!!

macdemarco,32wb16,iimalteaserii,7,Fri Apr 17 07:08:53 2015 UTC,"He put his ear up to my phone and listened for a while, I expected him to stop after a few seconds but he seemed to like it. Then he said it was dope. He's such a fuckin nice guy. It was a real nice group. Usually there's a lot of younger kids just crowding around him and going nuts, but there were only like maybe four other chicks hanging out and everyone was pretty mellow. I'm glad I caught him at the right time! :)"
macdemarco,32wb16,depression1017,3,Fri Apr 17 07:22:15 2015 UTC,Sounds like an ideal Mac concert. thank you!

macdemarco,32wb16,depression1017,2,Sat Apr 18 02:51:59 2015 UTC,That's interesting about CT not being crazy with him playing new stuff live. I saw DIIV twice last year and both times they mostly played new material.
macdemarco,32wb16,burritodude17,5,Fri Apr 17 15:47:55 2015 UTC,Maybe because he's their big artist?

macdemarco,32f55q,Rumsquall,4,Mon Apr 13 07:55:29 2015 UTC,I feel kinda bad for Tyler considering Mac has hinted (from what I've gathered) a kind of resentment toward Tyler for plopping his shitty fan base in mac's lap.
macdemarco,32f55q,Dancing_Shell,5,Tue Apr 14 00:04:23 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, what interviews make you say that?"
macdemarco,32f55q,Rumsquall,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:22:50 2015 UTC,"Seen a lot of interviews with the guy, so I can kinda pick up when certain things erk him. It's just the way he says it in this interview kind of triggered that thought. Link  Edit: I also think the fanbase of Tyler makes the whole scene more about the vanity of it all more than the music, hence the ridiculous amount of selfie-thirsty teens sporting the same clothing as mac."
macdemarco,32f55q,Dancing_Shell,6,Tue Apr 14 03:37:54 2015 UTC,"Haha I've seen/read pretty much all interviews with him so that's why I asked. I did see that interview but I'm not really sure if I would say he's gathered a resentment towards Tyler because of his fans, but idk. I just thought he thought it was weird like he said in the interview, but that overall, he's cool with it. But yeah, he might be bothered by the kinds of fans you described rather than Tyler himself, I would say, and is maybe just trying to be nice about the fans."
macdemarco,32dt9a,kenthewolfboy,9,Sun Apr 12 23:34:50 2015 UTC,Physically* Weakest crowd everrrr
macdemarco,32dt9a,GupNasty,9,Mon Apr 13 00:12:50 2015 UTC,"That set kinda weird to anyone else? Andy's guitar was way to quiet, Joe's ride cymbal was blown out the first couple tracks, and Pierce's bass popped a lot. Next week he's gonna play some new songs I'm tellin you guys!"
macdemarco,32dt9a,Rumsquall,13,Mon Apr 13 00:20:49 2015 UTC,That's festivals for ya. Especially ones where the design/aesthetic/fashion comes first
macdemarco,32dt9a,eggsmith,2,Mon Apr 13 00:57:04 2015 UTC,Yeah that's pretty sad. That being said no other acts were that fucked from what I've seen of the festival's performances.
macdemarco,32dt9a,Rumsquall,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:04:52 2015 UTC,i watched 'Jungle' and i dug it a lot but there were a few songs where they had a siren noise which i listened to on their studio album and it was not supposed to be even half as loud as it was on the live stream. sound issues like that are bound to happen
macdemarco,32dt9a,moodyfloyd,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"Jack White's set was quite fucked. His guitar wasn't nearly loud enough, the bass and drums dominated and one of the mic's didn't pick him up at all."
macdemarco,32dt9a,ShineOnYouFatOldSun,2,Mon Apr 13 15:13:41 2015 UTC,"Andy's guitar sounds like it's just not mic'd up properly, the stars keep on calling solo is barely even picked up."
macdemarco,32dt9a,hazabaza9,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, I thought his guitar cable became unplugged and he just kept playing; the audio mixing was definitely at fault.  One cool thing I noticed though was how happy the band, especially Mac, looked throughout the majority of the set. Call me biased, but I still feel like they all stood out from most of the other acts"
macdemarco,32dt9a,ShaqsHouse,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:53:56 2015 UTC,You really think?
macdemarco,32dt9a,rhanzlikusaf,3,Mon Apr 13 02:51:39 2015 UTC,"I saw a good majority of the acts on the stream and there were never so many missteps as Mac's set. I should point out though that they had been on a 1-month hiatus from each other as a band, so that might have something to do with it."
macdemarco,32dt9a,Rumsquall,7,Mon Apr 13 04:20:37 2015 UTC,Mac took out half the crowd with that crowd surf hahah also Eric is the best hahah killer solo
macdemarco,32dt9a,burritodude17,5,Mon Apr 13 00:16:17 2015 UTC,Eric Andre's dildo solo was... interesting
macdemarco,32dt9a,BasedLeon,4,Mon Apr 13 00:21:38 2015 UTC,"It felt a bit short for a set, it was a bit more than half an hour. But still, if I was there I would've enjoyed it a lot."
macdemarco,32dt9a,Killer_man,5,Mon Apr 13 00:25:18 2015 UTC,Where's the video of this set?
macdemarco,32dt9a,tshirt_with_wolves,2,Mon Apr 13 02:22:09 2015 UTC,mac played at 3pm and the archived stream from today starts up at jenny lewis going on stage at 4 or 5 pm.  No idea if they plan on uploading any of it.
macdemarco,32dt9a,DyedInkSun,2,Mon Apr 13 04:30:52 2015 UTC,hahaha his crowd surf was so bad
macdemarco,32dt9a,letempsdelamour,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:38:50 2015 UTC,Anyone else disappointed Mac's sweet sweet Kira didn't come out on the last song for the shoulder ride? Haha I was.
macdemarco,32dt9a,Butthole69ass,3,Mon Apr 13 00:39:35 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that only happened once, I don't think it's a regular thing."
macdemarco,32dt9a,geoff_,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:35:40 2015 UTC,No. He did it at pitchfork and he did it when he toured in Europe. Watch his live performances
macdemarco,32dt9a,Butthole69ass,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:37:06 2015 UTC,did it at bonnaroo 2013 too

macdemarco,32dt9a,KenNoisewater_PHD,-3,Tue May 5 03:23:25 2015 UTC,Not sure about you guys but i kinda don't like Andy. Just generally seems generally like a creep
macdemarco,32dt9a,sonoffuck,7,Mon Apr 13 02:56:49 2015 UTC,Andy is the shit.
macdemarco,32dt9a,willison1096,5,Mon Apr 13 02:59:19 2015 UTC,"Andy is a good addition to the band, but during coachella especially in freaking out the neighborhood it was evident that he didnt take the lead part too seriously. I just feel like peter had a better feel for most of the mac songs, considering he was part of the band way longer than andy"
macdemarco,32dt9a,MiStOrHoTsHoT,2,Mon Apr 13 03:56:20 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think Peter had Mac's songs down pat, and with him and Mac playing together for so long, they also had great chemistry."
macdemarco,32dt9a,Rumsquall,2,Mon Apr 13 04:56:49 2015 UTC,To the creep thing I would say is part of his look. But yeah he was acting like a jack-ass most of the set. Still funny though.
macdemarco,32dt9a,maybeimaleo,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:24:56 2015 UTC,"I want to like him and I sometimes find him funny, but when I saw him at Bumbershoot he talked over Mac and kept making really obnoxious comments. He's a good guitar player, but it's Mac's show."
macdemarco,32f1rm,willison1096,20,Mon Apr 13 07:04:06 2015 UTC,About macky being a bad bad boy.
macdemarco,32f1rm,Lcar210,5,Mon Apr 13 08:40:50 2015 UTC,"The lyrics are pretty straightforward. Mac is a drunk who likes to get silly sometimes, and people are wasting their time if they think they can change him."
macdemarco,32eibp,GadgeKLY,9,Mon Apr 13 03:19:38 2015 UTC,"he plays it sometimes, but not all the time. in one interview he said that during a tour one of his pianos got stolen, and that piano had that significant passing out to pieces sound, so thats a potential factor"
macdemarco,32eibp,willison1096,5,Mon Apr 13 03:54:51 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Cheers for the insight dude
macdemarco,32eibp,thefamoushipster,6,Mon Apr 13 04:07:00 2015 UTC,He played it live when I saw him last summer

macdemarco,32d1qv,kippman,4,Sun Apr 12 19:44:12 2015 UTC,Did he bump coke at the beginning or was that joke?
macdemarco,32d1qv,Rumsquall,4,Sun Apr 12 21:30:49 2015 UTC,"Looked like a joke to me but who knows, it was a while ago. He's said on more than one occasion that he's not into drugs other than tobacco and coffee."
macdemarco,32d1qv,nonex,2,Sun Apr 12 22:35:55 2015 UTC,You're being down voted because you're killing people's imaginary version of him.

macdemarco,32aprh,Derpabo,3,Sun Apr 12 07:49:08 2015 UTC,It was from when mac played at the Fillmore in San Fransisco. I see them on ebay pretty frequently
macdemarco,32aprh,Judge_Who_Approves,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:54:58 2015 UTC,How much do they typically go for?
macdemarco,32aprh,BeanRaider,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:41:39 2015 UTC,I got mine for a steal of $15! It was going up for auction on eBay and I was luckily the only bidder.
macdemarco,32aprh,BeanRaider,2,Sun Apr 12 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"Nice timing, I've had a look for a couple of his posters on ebay and the one you have isn't up at the moment but there are some other nice looking ones up for sale."
macdemarco,32aprh,kippman,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:53:39 2015 UTC,Does anybody know the names of the artists who do his poster work? This one says Chris Cohen but I'd like to know more
macdemarco,32aprh,zeke_24,2,Sun Apr 12 19:52:35 2015 UTC,"Chris Cohen is who opened in that show. He has got good music. Looking at my poster, which is identical for I got it at that show, i don't see any signature on the cover."
macdemarco,327sx9,BeanRaider,6,Sat Apr 11 09:34:01 2015 UTC,The basic chords are.....  Verse G/Em/Am/D  Chorus C/Bm/Am/G  Sounds like on this version the minor chords are minor 7ths on most of the go arounds.
macdemarco,327sx9,cboogie,6,Sat Apr 11 12:03:49 2015 UTC,Sorry if it's no help but tried tabbing the chords for you  Capo 3rd fret  E - 022100 / G7 - 302300 / F#m7 - 242252 / B7 - X24242  Chorus  A - 577655 / G#m7 - 464474 /  F#m7 - 242252 / E - 022100
macdemarco,327sx9,Eeevanbro,2,Sat Apr 11 23:11:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, and to the others who commented :)"
macdemarco,327sx9,ButterLettuceFantasy,2,Sun Apr 12 23:00:22 2015 UTC,this probably won't be very helpful but when I wanted to learn this song i just watched the video a bunch and figured out the chord shapes and played around with it until it sounded good
macdemarco,326sbf,Rumsquall,3,Sat Apr 11 01:47:48 2015 UTC,Also I completely fucked up that date...APRIL 12th!!!!!!!  Angel Olsen is playing next sunday at 1pm

macdemarco,322m6h,eggsmith,2,Fri Apr 10 06:12:28 2015 UTC,Maybe your friend was thinking of the instagram video that mac posted which had quite a few snippets of his new album.
macdemarco,322m6h,gccobra,3,Fri Apr 10 02:43:33 2015 UTC,"Nah, she said they specifically emailed and said since they fucked up, they were adding extra ""sneak peaks"" from the new album."
macdemarco,322m6h,STEALTHM0UNTAIN,3,Fri Apr 10 02:46:21 2015 UTC,Do you mean 'Sneak Peek'?

They're an extremely influential group and a lot bigger on a cosmic musical scale than mac. Count yourself lucky you get to see both those bands in one night!
macdemarco,323kxk,doggiebowlracecarcat,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm just really stoked on Mac haha  I understand what you're saying about Belle and Sebastian being bigger on a musical scale, but personally, I just haven't really taken the time to extensively listen to them, and I can only recognize maybe three of their songs. I'm not trying to discount them or their talent, because I do like the songs I've heard, but I suppose I just anticipated that Mac was headlining because of how great of a show he puts on.  Regardless, I swooped on a last minute ticket, and I'm seeing them tomorrow!"

macdemarco,31xdxk,PersonWithASelf,10,Thu Apr 9 17:29:17 2015 UTC,Would be something Captured Tracks might do but I don't think he'd be interested in releasing his own stuff. Someone asked him in that google hangout if he would do a collab with Vans and he was completely disinterested by the idea.
macdemarco,31xdxk,GadgeKLY,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:46:16 2015 UTC,He already did. There is a video of him going shopping in a Vans store and trying on shoes. There's a big Vans logo graphic after the video. I'm too lazy to find it.

macdemarco,31i17k,IM_GONNA_SHOOOT,5,Mon Apr 6 02:20:26 2015 UTC,Mac in the mastering studio with several new songs
macdemarco,31i17k,eggsmith,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:02:46 2015 UTC,well it could just be an EP. we'll have to wait and see
macdemarco,31i17k,bravelittlemicrowave,2,Mon Apr 6 05:32:22 2015 UTC,This is a shit job I did on my iPhone and I know the size of the picture is really fucked up and not the greatest. Heres a link to an unedited version I cropped

macdemarco,31cssm,chriss234,7,Fri Apr 3 21:58:27 2015 UTC,literally peed in my pants when i saw this

macdemarco,31cssm,Dancing_Shell,13,Fri Apr 3 22:18:12 2015 UTC,"Aww. They kinda sound a lot like songs from Salad Days. Which isn't necessarily bad, but Salad Days already sounded a lot like 2. I mean, I'm all for mid-tempo chillrock, but how about changing things up? How about including some of that oompf from RNRNC or the live shows?"
macdemarco,31cssm,eao,9,Fri Apr 3 22:08:12 2015 UTC,Agree with you but I wouldn't lose all hope. This sounds like only 3 songs tops. My bet is the rest of the album are synthy mind-fucks.
macdemarco,31cssm,Rumsquall,3,Fri Apr 3 22:38:40 2015 UTC,"was immediately like ""more of the same""  but even then, same is still good"
macdemarco,31cssm,antiSeptics,3,Sat Apr 4 02:20:48 2015 UTC,Haha dude I wouldn't make any opinions based on a 5 second instagram video... wait until at least a single comes out.
macdemarco,31cssm,eggsmith,2,Mon Apr 6 02:07:53 2015 UTC,"True, but from what I can glean I think he's mixing up the song structure a little more"
macdemarco,31cssm,so0o,2,Sat Apr 4 06:29:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm honestly a bit bummed by these samples. I'm afraid he's veering off into a direction I can't follow. I want live RNRNC sounding shit, the stuff that got me into Mac. Up tempo rockin shit."
macdemarco,31cssm,tom-the-cool,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:41:12 2015 UTC,"I dunno I think he likes to save that exclusively for his shows. listening to Mac on tape and live are two different Macs I guess, to be honest you could say that for any artist with a head on but what do I know"
macdemarco,31cssm,GupNasty,1 point,Mon Apr 6 08:51:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was my first impression as well. The one with the piano is somewhat refreshing, though. Gives me a Ryuichi Sakamoto vibe just ever so slightly. And I know Mac's into him so hopefully we hear some new influences on the album."
macdemarco,31cssm,GringoM2,3,Fri Apr 3 22:53:24 2015 UTC,i got so hype when i saw this

This sounds unreal i just hate how were probably gonna have to wait awhile before it drops on the internet but who knows, might just want to release it earlier than everyone expects."

macdemarco,31cssm,Rumsquall,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:30:07 2015 UTC,"My guess would be...September. Salad Days was recorded in November, released in April; that's a five month gap."
macdemarco,31cssm,jonjonman,5,Fri Apr 3 22:14:22 2015 UTC,yeah but he's past the writing stage and it's already being mastered so he's probably had it recorded for a month or so.
macdemarco,31cssm,Rumsquall,3,Sat Apr 4 04:14:26 2015 UTC,Didn't it leak way early though? I wasn't a Mac listener at that time.

macdemarco,318w1l,Rumsquall,3,Thu Apr 2 22:47:47 2015 UTC,Fucking full video was up for a while and then taken down by the official channel. I should have ripped it :(

macdemarco,318w1l,billmeister123,2,Fri Apr 3 02:57:04 2015 UTC,bless!
macdemarco,318w1l,jonjonman,3,Fri Apr 3 17:48:40 2015 UTC,He used to do this like right after the album came out and it was incredible. Wish he still would
macdemarco,317ipt,Dancing_Shell,2,Thu Apr 2 16:43:18 2015 UTC,mushrooms haha
macdemarco,317nqt,willison1096,2,Thu Apr 2 17:19:20 2015 UTC,"Nope. You need a tape machine, a TwinReverb/VibroChamp vintage fender amp at least..."

Im eventually gonna get a mic in the summer when i have the money but right now its just no vocal intrumental songs. I just dont really know what genre my music falls into"
macdemarco,317nqt,DojoDaniel,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:05:11 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty sick! You won't need something as pricey as a twin reverb.. I reckon all it needs is a crisper bass (just my taste though) if you're trying to get onto the mac vibe. His demos aren't so much crisp but in his album the bass really is a massive underlying part of his songs I reckon.
macdemarco,315zdm,KlokaCola,5,Thu Apr 2 06:38:46 2015 UTC,really happy that shes really all i need was included. one of my fav mac songs live
macdemarco,315zdm,comicalkyle,4,Thu Apr 2 22:28:45 2015 UTC,sick! now i dont have to wait so long to finally complete the itunes album lol

macdemarco,313nb5,BromanEmperor,5,Wed Apr 1 20:19:40 2015 UTC,Tempted to buy it but I'll get reamed on shipping which means I end up buying more records to make it worth it and then I can't make rent. Fuck I probably shouldn't buy it.
macdemarco,313nb5,MiStOrHoTsHoT,6,Wed Apr 1 20:26:40 2015 UTC,Sure.... like 4 days after I buy the repress.

macdemarco,310gqv,DojoDaniel,7,Wed Apr 1 03:44:01 2015 UTC,New guitarist Andy uses a 12 string Dan electro which is pretty siack too
macdemarco,310gqv,Dancing_Shell,7,Wed Apr 1 03:57:39 2015 UTC,Super rad of you to take the time to compile/organize this. Thanks.
macdemarco,310gqv,bremerrr,3,Wed Apr 1 04:56:14 2015 UTC,"This is sick man, thanks for doing this!"
macdemarco,310gqv,nonex,3,Wed Apr 1 10:28:54 2015 UTC,"Nice!  The Fostex A8 is his old 8 track quarter inch reel to reel. 2 was done with it. Salad Days was done using a Tascam 388, also an 8 track quarter inch reel to reel.  When I first heard Cooking Up Something Good, I knew I was listening to an A8, I've got one ;-)  As for the 388, I'm working on fixing one of those right now. The mixer and recording unit is combined. It's a nice piece of gear."
macdemarco,310gqv,PersonWithASelf,3,Wed Apr 1 12:02:31 2015 UTC,"GUITAR: PRetty sure it's a Teisco. Check 'em out. There kinda all over ebay and Craigslist. Make basses, too. Def worth peaking at if you're interested in a unique/cheap guitar!"
macdemarco,310gqv,super_modified,2,Wed Apr 1 18:24:49 2015 UTC,Really surprises me that he doesn't use any compressors!
macdemarco,310gqv,super_modified,2,Wed Apr 1 12:17:31 2015 UTC,"i read he tried using the same compressor which tame impala used, but it didn't quite match his vibe and he guessed that the tape machine compressed the drums and stuff enoughalready so.. i guess thats why"
macdemarco,310gqv,penismonkeylover,2,Wed Apr 1 13:02:51 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah i think that was on his AMA? Makes sense, shocks me that a tape machine can do that much to alter the sound though. It's cool!"
macdemarco,310gqv,Sodense69,2,Wed Apr 1 13:05:40 2015 UTC,"yeah man, makes me really want to buy one. I'm also just really hopeless at all the computery ableton/logic shit so I reckon an 8 track and old school effects is the basic mans music maker"
macdemarco,310gqv,i_just_sharted_on_u,2,Wed Apr 1 13:19:13 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he has/uses alesis microverb 3 and possibly a 1 as well (on top of his krks)
macdemarco,310gqv,Rumsquall,2,Wed Apr 1 16:16:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this!  Does anyone know how he has the Fostex setup with the Allen & Heath?  You can see him splitting individual signals (Guitar, Bass, etc.) in the Pepperoni Playboy video and I was curious to know how he did this.   (Starts at 12:31) https://youtu.be/JStLz_vkEm8?t=12m31s"
macdemarco,310gqv,genericman423,2,Wed Apr 1 16:26:59 2015 UTC,"I think each track is run back through the mixer from the tape and then output to speakers, headphones, an interface, etc (depending on what you want). The particular model he has can record 4 tracks at a time and output 8 (I think...), so if each part is recorded to its own track then they can be controlled separately using the individual track controls on the mixer."
macdemarco,310gqv,Killer_man,2,Wed Apr 1 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"yeah, isn't that how all Tape-decks/mixers work?"
macdemarco,310gqv,gccobra,2,Wed Apr 1 20:57:08 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/xgSSwXj.png  just like this
macdemarco,310gqv,Killer_man,2,Wed Apr 1 19:37:15 2015 UTC,"The guitar is a Teisco, don't know the model, but it is pretty beat up. I think the pickguard is made of cardboard and the neck is from another guitar, probably a Danelectro."
macdemarco,310gqv,companysOkay,2,Wed Apr 1 23:27:46 2015 UTC,Im pretty sure the neck is a Mosrite
macdemarco,30wp2m,Fjel,28,Tue Mar 31 09:11:11 2015 UTC,Well he's definitely made it now. Glad to see to see the band is still keeping it weird even on a show like Conan. Love the no shirt on Andy.
macdemarco,30wp2m,idontdojack,18,Tue Mar 31 13:20:08 2015 UTC,and Andy's still not wearing a shirt..

macdemarco,30wp2m,Butthole69ass,4,Tue Mar 31 13:21:10 2015 UTC,How long has Mac had this new guitar? Has he been using it a lot lately?
macdemarco,30wp2m,la-blakers,5,Tue Mar 31 10:46:06 2015 UTC,"He seems to be jumping around a lot these days, he was using a Mustang for awhile there, then a Gibson SG and now he's on the Strat"
macdemarco,30wp2m,DrWangerBanger,5,Tue Mar 31 12:54:51 2015 UTC,Quite the branch out for a guy who only used one guitar! Does he still use that old one?
macdemarco,30wp2m,la-blakers,7,Tue Mar 31 13:40:12 2015 UTC,He said in an interview that strings kept breaking on his old one so he just has it hung in his house now or something.
macdemarco,30wp2m,hazabaza9,6,Tue Mar 31 14:11:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't know for sure, but I haven't seen a single video with him using that guitar ever since he started branching out."
macdemarco,30wp2m,DrWangerBanger,3,Tue Mar 31 13:50:54 2015 UTC,He's probably just going to use it for recording now
macdemarco,30wp2m,hadag,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:04:55 2015 UTC,it looked like it still had a tag on the pickup selector? or it might just be something macs thrown on there :)
macdemarco,30wp2m,screamadelica_,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:56:11 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it's tape to hold it in the neck position, or what ever position they want to keep it in. I assume so they don't knock it into something else while playing."

macdemarco,30wp2m,eggsmith,0,Wed Apr 1 06:14:37 2015 UTC,"I agree about the solo. I miss Pete, he nails that sloppy/dissonant thing. When Andy does it it feels out of place."

macdemarco,30ydjd,jackieclay,4,Tue Mar 31 23:04:54 2015 UTC,"Once he's done with this tour he'll probably take some time off and then record when he's ready. He only took about a month to record 'Salad Days', so hopefully soon!"
macdemarco,30ydjd,hrpoodersmith,3,Tue Mar 31 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"He made Salad Days November '13, but he and the label had agreed on April 1st of 2014 to release the album. I'm assuming since his tour ends late July, he'll make the album sometime shortly after that and release it early 2016, but idk, this is just going off from what I know of Salad Days' release and assuming he's gonna record again when he's on break and not while on tour."
macdemarco,30ydjd,Dancing_Shell,3,Wed Apr 1 02:32:04 2015 UTC,Still hoping for some synth action by mac on his next project
macdemarco,30ydjd,friedclams,4,Wed Apr 1 02:57:36 2015 UTC,He said it was likely his next project would be more synth based in an interview I read somewhere. Just because he recently bought a ton of old synths.
macdemarco,30ydjd,BasedGodIsJesus,1 point,Wed Apr 1 07:05:37 2015 UTC,He said that on his AMA here.
macdemarco,30x09v,genericman423,2,Tue Mar 31 11:56:46 2015 UTC,"I know it was on the London Show video. Looks like a 1970s Made in America by the body and oversized headstock. He's got something over the pick-up selector, so I can't see what pickups he's using."
macdemarco,30x09v,hazabaza9,2,Tue Mar 31 16:54:19 2015 UTC,He had it on that video he made for his London show but that's the first time I've seen it?
macdemarco,30u887,jonjonman,12,Mon Mar 30 19:24:45 2015 UTC,He did Still Together on Eric Andre but that was a complete goof so who knows.
macdemarco,30u887,iamscot,10,Mon Mar 30 19:49:58 2015 UTC,"Probably Let Her Go, especially since that was basically written just to be played on TV."

macdemarco,30u887,GupNasty,7,Tue Mar 31 08:56:12 2015 UTC,Oh hail yaaaaa. Mac finally getting some shine.
macdemarco,30u887,geoff_,6,Mon Mar 30 22:44:45 2015 UTC,Is this his first TV appearance? (I'm excluding Eric Andre lol)  I think he'll play Let Her Go.
macdemarco,30u887,BoutLove,5,Mon Mar 30 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah his first major tv appearance, I think hes still going to lick someones butt though."

macdemarco,30u887,Fjel,2,Tue Mar 31 09:02:39 2015 UTC,is he talking with conan or just playing
macdemarco,30tnme,MiStOrHoTsHoT,8,Mon Mar 30 16:53:16 2015 UTC,30 bucks for 2? I'm still buying it but yeesh. Is it that rare? edit: I now officially have all LPs and the Wonderful box on vinyl :)
macdemarco,30tnme,jonjonman,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:26:33 2015 UTC,I'm sort of wondering the same thing. Maybe they saw how much they're going for on Discogs and just set the price that way.   Or they know us schmucks will pay that much for it regardless.
macdemarco,30tnme,Pigfloop,3,Tue Mar 31 14:43:30 2015 UTC,I bought Rock n Roll Nightclub last October and it still hasn't come.

macdemarco,3067vc,Dancing_Shell,0,Tue Mar 24 22:23:56 2015 UTC,Yea 150 dollars a ticket :|  I'm talking like a concert with just him.
macdemarco,3067vc,Dancing_Shell,3,Tue Mar 24 23:24:45 2015 UTC,And how about Florida too? :( i find that a lot of artists and bands in general dont come to FL. Too far south?
macdemarco,3067vc,youthcanoe,3,Tue Mar 24 22:45:17 2015 UTC,Well imagine if you're a artist and you want the most people to come to your shows. So you would pick the most populated areas with the most surrounding towns. Florida is a needle dick state with the only good thing is miami
macdemarco,3067vc,Dancing_Shell,2,Wed Mar 25 00:32:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get you. I pretty much meant South Florida (Miami), but even with Miami, not many artists within the realm of alternative/indie come to the city. I think part of it has to do with the bands/artists not having large fan bases here in Miami, but idk. For being such a big city, it's a lot less common to have an alt/indie artist play here."
macdemarco,3067vc,Rumsquall,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:35:38 2015 UTC,Former south Florida resident here. Almost nothing ever came to the Tampa area. Usually had to drive to Orlando and still barely any indie acts came that way. Was such a bummer.
macdemarco,3067vc,KlokaCola,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"It's so true. I guess I'm a bit luckier leaving near Miami, but even then, the amount of indie acts that come to Miami is so sparse compared to every other major U.S. city. :/ I probably shouldn't complain too much tho, at least some acts come by and I don't live in the middle of nowhere."

macdemarco,300wnb,nappi,3,Tue Mar 31 16:25:07 2015 UTC,"I've ordered tons of stuff from them, and I've never had an issue. Granted, I've only ever pre-ordered stuff from them so I'm always getting copies from the first pressing and I'd imagine they're more on the ball with brand new releases. They're probably more focused on getting new things from other artists facilitated at the moment and thats why stuff like Salad Days is getting put on hold. I know its probably really annoying but just keep in mind that they're still a small indie label and they put out tons of records so they may get sidetracked."
macdemarco,300wnb,BLogue,2,Mon Mar 23 19:25:01 2015 UTC,Do they have a phone number?

macdemarco,2zus35,eggsmith,4,Sun Mar 22 03:03:20 2015 UTC,"The only good thing about Vice at this point are some of their youtube documentaries and there HBO show is pretty good. The rest of it is all just desperately trying to be edgy by coming up with convoluted ""I don't give a fuck"" responses to everything that's even mildly popular. They're so obsessed with being ~counter-culture~ that it's just embarrassing. Their article titles are always like ""My experience doing bath-salts with some trans-strippers in an auto-shop in a village in Ukraine"" and it's the shittiest clickbait ever. Vice is honestly 10x more cringeworthy than Buzzfeed, at least they're not pathetically trying to be hot shit."

I agreed to go, naturally, and I was not disappointed. As they were playing an awesome set, they paused and asked on stage if there was anyone that could let them crash at their place. Without hesitation, both me and my roommate offered up our house and it was set right then and there! They came to our place, Pierce, Joe, and the other member in the band Simon. They were all awesome dudes! We drank, exchanged stories, and had pizza at 2:45 in the morning. Before they left in the morning, Pierce gave me his e-mail to get us backstage at a festival he's playing with Mac!   Hopefully this is just part one of the story"

""In your song “Freaking Out the Neighborhood,” are you apologizing for anything in particular? I am. That’s about the family. A lot of songs are about the family on the album. I did a karaoke set in Montreal last spring, and I ended up getting really, really drunk. All my clothes came off, beer got poured over me, percussive instrument tools found their way into my butt and my friend took a video of the thing. I thought it’d be funny, but it goes on YouTube and my aunt sees it, and my whole family. And they were not too pleased. My mom was like, “Mac—what’s going on?” My aunt freaked out and thought I was smoking bath salts. I didn’t present some song to say, look, I’m sorry… it was all clear before. They understand that I’m just a bit of a goof. But I thought it’d be a fun thing to write a song about, so I did."""

""  http://www.irlmag.com/mac-demarco/  I know this isn't exactly what your looking for but im pretty sure he has answered it in either the google hangout vid, ebay ama, reddit ama, or in pepperoni playboy.

I hope to post some jizz jazz song goodness on here once I can.   You really have to like that thin Mac Demarco sound to appreciate how it sounds. I've never been more excited than when I strummed out the Viceroy intro on it. It sounded sooo good, and that was only out of the shitty Fender amp that came with the Starcaster. I can't wait to get my hands on a Deluxe Reverb. It has some fret buzz, but I can always work that out later."
macdemarco,2y36x3,nutsackhairbrush,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:49:29 2015 UTC,"i dont get trying to copy his tone. its not some killer tone or anything. you can get 90% of the way there on a squire and a fender amp with chorus and reverb. no big secrets. shitty guitar into semi shit reel to reel machine. i think he goes out of the way to make his tone ""shitty"" to take the focus off of the whole equipment circlejerk that guitarists have. garage rock is not supposed to sound pretty and polished.  having said all that shit, i like that you made this guitar your own."

macdemarco,2y36x3,FMONZO27,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:34:16 2015 UTC,right on man. its all about finding something that limits you and makes your sound unique.  i bought a gretch for 150 of some dude on craigslist. i couldnt find a serial number and it just says electromatic on the the head. ive looked all over for guitars like it and taken it to many guitar  techs and no one has ever seen a guitar exactly like it. i think its a prototype built in the 80s when gretch first moved production to asia. it isn't very versatile but i got good at making it make the sounds i want it to make. in the end i think that's all that matters. i like it way more than my much more expensive american made strat.

It's a great midi controller too, I think it's even velocity sensitive but I've never been able to prove it 100%. It's like the convenience of a drum machine but with the performance aspect of real drums. And they're cheap and common. Runs off batteries too which is cool.   If you have more money you should check out it's modern descendant the SPD-S which has programmable samples among other cool new features.

macdemarco,2wle0c,tshirt_with_wolves,3,Fri Feb 20 22:33:01 2015 UTC,I bought one. Stoked!
macdemarco,2wle0c,jonjonman,2,Sat Feb 21 21:41:41 2015 UTC,"They released 100 more full Wonderful World of Mac fan club boxes yesterday!! I was on the website refreshing like crazy and it was going slow as hell. I finally got through and grabbed one. I guess I'm starting a vinyl collection.... I've been wanting to for a while though anyway. Anyone have first timer advice on cheap record players, etc?"
macdemarco,2wle0c,so0o,7,Sat Feb 21 23:56:35 2015 UTC,"If you have to cheap go vintage. Don't buy a Crosley, Pyle, Jensen, or any other cheap turntable because they will literally destroy your records. Cheap turntables tend to track at a heavier weight that will wear away the grooves in your records each time you play them until eventually they will sound all staticy from all the damage done to them. Probably the cheapest new turntable that I could recommend would be the Audio Technics LP120 which clocks in at $200 USD. If you go vintage you can do well for $100 if you keep your eyes peeled on Craigslist. Vintage direct drive TTs are better than vintage belt drives because they're far less likely to have problems with them and you shouldn't have to do any work to get them up and running. Pioneer and Technics are two good brands to look out for. You can hop on over to /r/vinyl to learn more but beware that sub is toxic as hell. The community there is negative as hell, which is why I un-subbed, but the sidebar has a lot of good info about getting started. Have fun with vinyl!"
macdemarco,2wle0c,jonjonman,1 point,Sun Feb 22 00:23:34 2015 UTC,Wow good know thanks for all the info!! It bums me out when subs get like that :/

macdemarco,2wle0c,tshirt_with_wolves,-2,Sat Feb 21 21:28:52 2015 UTC,No I'm complaining because I paid more to get these instalments monthly when they've pretty much all come in bulk anyways. Also we were promised cool goodies not shit like balloons and stickers that a lot of us could make ourselves. They were also promised as super limited so its lame as fuck that someone can just buy them all now for cheaper than they were when i got them when they first came out. So fuck you because you don't even understand the situation. Idiot.
macdemarco,2wle0c,apojrple,5,Sat Feb 21 23:07:35 2015 UTC,"They made 100 more only. It's still ""super limited"". Don't buy it if you don't want it."

I went to one of his sideshows too and I'm glad I did just because it was longer, but both were really good. Also saw benjamin booker, pond, fka twigs, caribou, flying lotus and banks. Missed a bunch i wanted to see because of clashes which sucks"
macdemarco,2v5e8m,mattcrick,1 point,Sun Feb 8 02:47:22 2015 UTC,"Funny, I was considering making a post about that exact show! I actually thought he was throwing his shoes to people in the crowd, but that may be only because he was trying to throw them on the stage but didn't throw them hard enough. The crowd seemed more disciplinary nearer to the back where I was. Anyway, that show, and the festival, was amazing. It was my first time seeing Mac live, and I was sure he'd be a cool guy, and he was. Andy can shred pretty well too. And he also appeared at Connan Mockasin's set once again. Not a large amount of making out this time though"
macdemarco,2v5e8m,kenthewolfboy,1 point,Sun Feb 8 03:40:29 2015 UTC,"I was pretty close to the stage and he was definitely trying to throw them back towards the stage. Yeah even the part I stood was fine, it was just right at the front where it seemed crappy.  Yeah they're all so good live. Didn't get in early enough to see Connan but I thought that would have been good. Apparently in Brisbane Mac got a bunch of people on stage for his set so I was hoping for something like that at melbs. Still good though"

macdemarco,2uyjcp,CommodorePython,1 point,Fri Feb 6 23:58:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah and what was interesting is ( unlike me), he grew up in the post napster, ipod, spotify era - so I realised it's just normal if you're a muso of his age to give stuff away for free - there never was an alternative -(which is pretty stupid of me not to realise - but I didn't think about it)."

I'm usually a fucking hater of everything because everything always seems to do it on purpose to suck, but someone showed me the album Salad Days a few months ago and I really can't express how I felt. I proceeded to find and listened to everything this guy ever released, and it was all (without exception) incredible.     At first I was listening and enjoying it, I didn't mind that the guy was 20 something years old, because I'm myself a similar age, but out of the fucking pops and generic rocks of today, something had blossomed with this guy. He's a character that I can't really pinpoint what he's after, and in his way he seems to want to leave some great music and memories. I can't say no to that. I love what Mac DeMarco represents. And he's pretty fucking awesome himself as well."
macdemarco,2uyjcp,PinkBirdtron,4,Fri Feb 6 07:03:41 2015 UTC,"I've met him three times, and he's a fucking nice dude. When it comes to the music, I would completely agree. Not some sorry soul sucker looking for fame. He's a real ass dude. Never seen his music portray assholishness. He's a jabroni for sure, but an asshole...I don't think so.  Love you Mac, God bless."
macdemarco,2uyjcp,jonjonman,1 point,Fri Feb 6 07:19:33 2015 UTC,Watching a lot of interviews with him I noticed a lot of people that interview him try to get him to be bad ass - or do something controversial -  like drinking games to get drunk or try to get him to kiss the interviewer - which is fine - but he's also a nice guy with some really interesting stuff to say about music.
macdemarco,2uyjcp,laikamonkey,4,Thu Feb 12 05:55:22 2015 UTC,"That's awesome man. His fan base and this subreddit have some of the coolest people ever. And its a bunch of young kids, similar to Macs age, who make music in their rooms. Its fucking great."
macdemarco,2uyjcp,slowitdown,3,Fri Feb 6 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"I woke up one day and I was 40, but I still totally love his music.

macdemarco,2uyjcp,maxferg1,2,Thu Feb 12 05:51:15 2015 UTC,I'm just old enough to be his father - but I totally agree his sound and songwriting is really freakin awesome. I researched a lot about him and found we were both into similar music - and you can hear some of these artists in his music the strongest one for me was Haruomi Hosono one of the founding members of the amazing groundbreaking Yellow Magic Orchestra - we spoke about this stuff but it didn't fit in the interview. Worth listening to if you like his stuff

macdemarco,2uj6xy,keysy_,2,Mon Feb 2 17:05:39 2015 UTC,"I think the drums are way too quiet. Not sure how you recorded them or programmed them but they sound like they're barely being picked up by the microphones.   If you're going for a direct cover: Whoever did the drums did a decent job at playing behind the beat (not sarcasm). The vocals are good. Good job on getting the pitch LFO patch right for the synth pad. The lead synth is too loud. The bass is too quiet, not sure if there is a bass.   It doesn't sound like it was recorded to tape but it sounds like you tried to go for the lo-fi tape sound. How did you record and mix this song?"
macdemarco,2uj6xy,nutsackhairbrush,2,Mon Feb 2 20:18:30 2015 UTC,"I used ableton but was really trying to go for a tape sound, yeah. The levels could use some work; admittedly I'm new to this and not great at mastering. Thanks, though; I'll work on it!"
macdemarco,2uj6xy,jonjonman,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:55:15 2015 UTC,Have any tips for the lofi sound?
macdemarco,2uj6xy,jonjonman,1 point,Tue Feb 3 06:44:00 2015 UTC,"Modulation and detuning is very helpful. I have decent equipment but sometimes just opt for camera mics to sample in demos and stuff. If you're going digital, the free vintage synth VST's are pretty fun, and some of them are really fucked up. I usually mic up amps rather than opting for a virtual one, too.  In general, don't worry too much about external noise making its way into the recording.  Please note that I'm hardly an expert, I just like mucking around with sounds."

macdemarco,2udzkv,mattcrick,2,Sun Feb 1 07:10:41 2015 UTC,"Sad he didn't get any recognition for either 2 or Salad Days. But god am I glad he isn't at that 'peak' in popularity. I'm glad there isn't any saturation of his music on the radio or around the young crowd in my circle. His Metro show had a completely different demographic than Oxford in 2013, and it was the only real sour note of a fucking awesome show, the 'peak' would only make it worse. Just hope he keeps rolling as he is right now."
macdemarco,2udzkv,srekcornaivaf,5,Sun Feb 1 23:03:20 2015 UTC,"Good point on his shows having different demographics, saw him in 2013 twice and the crowds were there to enjoy his music. None of that pushing and shoving shit to get to the front to see Mac, it was people having fun. I saw him last year twice at the same venue 6 months apart and the crowds had 2 completely different vibes. Honestly it's the tumblr crowd that really bugs me, because they are all their for their own social status and more focused on getting pics of Mac for their blogs than they are there to enjoy the music. Also fuck everone who calls him ""Maky D"" that shits annoying and stupid. I'm sorry for ranting, I've been holding this in for a while."
macdemarco,2udzkv,GadgeKLY,7,Sun Feb 1 23:37:32 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I hate to sound like a pretentious dick with the opinion, and by all means I probably am being a dick, but it's just a distinct observation I made. Just a bit disorienting going for an awesome crowd, to rocking up and seeing 300 15-year olds all trying to mimic Mac.   I'm whinging too much, but fuck the worst part was Mac ended the main set with an awesome, kinda funky rendition of Still Together, leapt off for a crowd surf and two things happened: the whole crowd swarmed him and wouldn't let him move for awhile (holding on to his overalls) and while he surfed a bunch of kids started a 'pit of death'. Like, fuck, really? There's funky, sexy, mellow music being played and you cunts are being fuckwits.   /endrant, see ya next time Mac."
macdemarco,2udzkv,keysy_,3,Sun Feb 1 23:43:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was at the show too, and I agree the kids were really annoying and dumb. But I guess we all have to remember that this show would've been one of the highlights of these kids lives so far, I mean theres not much else they can get to see at their age. We were all that age once and, despite the absence of tumblr, we were all obsessed with bands like Weezer, Blink 182, Linkin Park, (I don't know what your tastes are but you get the idea), etc. So its pretty cool that Mac is that kind of artist for these kids.   But don't get me wrong, if there was an all age sideshow I would've jumped at it. His set at Laneway made up for it though. He had heaps of other artists on stage having fun, he kissed Conan, and Angel Olsen and I caught eyes and sung Still Together to each other. Still were a lot of fresh 18 year olds there that were pretty annoying but wasn't as bad. Those kids all will grow up eventually, but for now its nice they have someone like Mac to scream and go crazy for, much better than having a bunch of sad, emo teenagers moping around."

macdemarco,2udzkv,so0o,1 point,Tue Feb 3 05:37:11 2015 UTC,"Ahh, right!  Was a fantastic set. He finished off with an incredibly tight rendition of ""Still Together"" and jumped into the crowd midway. The several thousand people under the tent all swarmed towards him. He wasn't moving around much and collapsed down into the crowd a few times as everyone was trying to grab him/pull him down. Some of my friends had fallen to the ground and people were stepping all over them in order to get closer to the guy.  A few of my mates and I had their phones damaged/gained some nasty injuries, but it was still the best live show I'd been to in a while."

The chorus is basically the same as salad day's C into G6. The high ""meeeeeee"" at the end of the chorus is with that Dm something chord you began with.

She said the image shows on the monitor to the entire line waiting for prints and people looked at her like she was crazy when they saw it.  They were all getting family portraits and stuff printed.

I was going to upload the picture by itself but didn't want anyone to steal it. Redbubble water marks all the work you put up, and makes it hard for people to steal your work. It gives you the option to still just view the image it self, which is what I wanted.  Sorry if you feel like I'm slapping you with an advert to my shit, I just had a good chuckle making this and figured I'd share it!  Bless and take care this holiday season! <3"

macdemarco,2qdum9,psuedohigh,4,Fri Dec 26 01:06:35 2014 UTC,Sounds like they just messed up and put two copies in. Definitely not a standard.

macdemarco,2prqt1,slickmustache,2,Fri Dec 19 07:58:47 2014 UTC,"It reminds me of those articles in magazines that are like ""Celebrities are just like you and me... They put gas in their own cars! and look theres Johnny Depp buying a new shower curtain!! WHAT!?"""
macdemarco,2prqt1,billmeister123,5,Fri Dec 19 08:00:44 2014 UTC,"This is the most unnecessary and stupid article ever. Seriously - who the fuck cares about his mom (no offense to Mac´s mom). This just goes to show how horrible his fanbase has gotten the past year. He´s like an indie Justin Bieber in terms of fans... its kind of sad. Watching recent interviews, he looks like he´s growing a bit tired of it, as well as always having to keep up his ""persona"". Don´t get me wrong - I love his music and he is a funny guy, but its really getting out of hand.   Not complaining about you posting it, I´m just ranting at the people who would actually write this."

macdemarco,2prqt1,jonjonman,1 point,Fri Dec 19 14:40:53 2014 UTC,It's because she is mc'ing at a festival in australia and a lot of people wont know who she is. It's a shitty article but that is the reason behind it.

macdemarco,2pogsd,Amoeba95,2,Thu Dec 18 22:40:14 2014 UTC,"He should make a list of all the songs his band doesn't know how to play/doesn't give a shit about, and then the fans will rally and form a perfect cover band, then Mac can do a ""rarities"" only concert."

macdemarco,2plzia,KlokaCola,2,Wed Dec 17 22:06:31 2014 UTC,"Fuck yes! Got it. Can't believe they just restocked today and it already says ""only a few left."""
macdemarco,2pkik5,Khemikooligan,2,Wed Dec 17 11:55:31 2014 UTC,"Don't buy it. There are so many repeated songs in this series that I get more and more bummed out with each new release. Now that they've been ripped to mp3 there's really no need to drop $100+ on this thing. Here's the list of the songs so far:   Only You Eating Like A Kid Cooking Up Something Good (2x) The Stars Keep On Calling My Name (3x) Me And John Hangin' On Ode To Viceroy Together (x2) Freaking Out The Neighborhood Wicked Game (Chris Isaak cover) Salad Days (2x) Let Her Go (2x) Brother Rock 'N' Roll Night Club Treat Her Better Let My Baby Stay   That's 15 unique songs across 21 tracks. To put that in perspective, over 1/4 of the releases have been repeats. That's a pretty high number.   On one hand I'm really psyched that they've releseased live versions of songs like ""Together"" and ""Rock 'N' Roll Nightclub"" that have an entirely different sound than their recorded counterparts. On the other hand, I'm bummed that they didn't release more in the same vain like ""Baby's Wearing Blue Jeans"" or ""She's Really All I Need"". I mean, seriously, compare these two: Album - Live. This is the stark contrast I expected they were trying to capture with this 7"" thing, that's why I bought it.  And as for the ""goodies"" that came with the 7"" club... There's a cassette mixtape that's mixed so poorly that it's basically unlistenable, there's a couple of art prints of drawings by Mac, and there's a Mac DeMarco branded condom. I could've done without these if it meant more selective vinyl releases.  /rant"
macdemarco,2pkik5,so0o,0,Thu Dec 18 23:54:21 2014 UTC,They won't.
macdemarco,2pkik5,kenthewolfboy,2,Wed Dec 17 12:13:06 2014 UTC,"Why not? The product page specifically says it's off sale ""Temporarily"" and that when all of the 7""s are released they will put the entire collection back on sale for a higher cost"
macdemarco,2pkik5,kenthewolfboy,3,Wed Dec 17 12:52:56 2014 UTC,I just thought they would be a very limited thing and sort of hoped they wouldnt be available for resale because then they arent as special. To answer your question though id say the 5th instalment will be out sometime in Jan.
macdemarco,2pkik5,PersonWithASelf,1 point,Wed Dec 17 13:58:05 2014 UTC,"From what I gather they are still limited, the page on Captured Tracks says there will only be 700 made but above that there is a notice saying that orders for it have been put on hold until all of the 7""s have been released. I imagine they would just say that it is sold out if all 700 copies have been bought, then again, maybe they are doing something different. The page just says:  ""We’ve temporarily closed the sale of the Mac DeMarco club. They will not be available for sale again until all the 7″s series are complete and will be sold at a higher cost. Stay tuned, we have something special in the works""  And it's the last bit about ""something special"" that makes me wonder if maybe they will re-release it as a 12"" or something."
macdemarco,2pkik5,so0o,3,Wed Dec 17 14:08:33 2014 UTC,"From what I can gather from my corespondence with them, something special is packing them all in a specially designed box that house the 7's and the special gifts. I hope they sell them for a lot, no offense to you u/Kemikooligan, but like u/kentthewolfboy said the won't be as special otherwise."

macdemarco,2p77j5,jonjonman,3,Sat Dec 13 20:42:51 2014 UTC,"It's always interesting to see his old interviews because he always says something like ""not the tighest set"" or ""it was pretty rough""  when asked the question ""how was the set??"" Not sure if he was just not as confident back then, or maybe not totally happy with his bandmates, but just something strange I've always noticed when digging through old videos."

It's just arpeggios of C, F, G7(?)  e |-----------------------------------------------|  B |------------1----------1---0------------------|  G |---------0---------2-------0------------------|  D |------2--------3---------- 3------------------|  A |---3-----------------------2------------------|  E |----------------------------3------------------|   So the last piece would be the chorus, which is probably also the hardest.  Basically the base structure of it is an Am7 chord with things added/removed here and there:  e |---0-------0--3-------0-----------------0---0------------------|  B |---1---3----------0---1--0--1--3--0-----1-------1-----------0--|  G |---0------------------0-----------------2----------2--------0--|  D |---2------------------2--- -------------2-------------2-----3--|  A |------------------------------------------------------------2--|  E |------------------------------------------------------------3--|   That last bit, with the Am and the G7 is the part I'm least confident with.  I will say that the second time you play that bit, instead of the G7 I like to play:  e|--3-----------------------------------|  B|--3-----------------------------------|  G|--4-----------------------------------|  D|--------------------------------------|  A|--------------------------------------|  E|--------------------------------------|    If you want a better tab in general, but a fun song to play and pretty challenging (in one spot), here's my tab for Annie.  I adapted a tab some other guy wrote and added the ""I'm going down..."" breakdown in there, which I'm pretty proud of."

macdemarco,2ofycu,pocketbunny,2,Sun Dec 7 00:14:56 2014 UTC,Wonder why he ditched his mustang
macdemarco,2ofycu,kenthewolfboy,2,Mon Dec 15 04:41:55 2014 UTC,"He like JUST got that thing. Said he went into a guitar store and ""literally bought the most expensive guitar I could get for fun"" or something in an interview haha. The SG weirds me out, because I never associate that type of guitar sound with jizz jazz. Usually shitty old strats etc. But I guess ""sound"" depends more on the pedal/amp since he's getting the same sound?"
macdemarco,2ofycu,strumpanirumpan,2,Mon Dec 15 06:23:51 2014 UTC,"Oh thanks man. It just looks hella weird. the humbuckers do make a difference in tone but it's not that much. It's not a guitar that fits his personality, the quirky shitty guitars or that mustang like really gave off this mac vibe. I just wish he was playing the mustang still."

macdemarco,2ntfur,anxiety_quest,5,Sun Nov 30 11:08:50 2014 UTC,"I agree, it seems like he never turns it off. His show revolves around making people feel awkward but even in his own interviews he relies on this same kind of comedy and it comes off really obnoxious (see his appearances on Conan, AOTS, Pete Holmes, etc.). I can see why he never succeeded as a stand-up.  That said, his show is fucking amazing."

It's down by campus, I find myself being there often, it's got this place called the Buffalo Exchange that everyone loves even though it's overpriced, it's got Ken's Donuts, the NiceKicks and it's got Antone's Records there as well.

So I'll assume you're Australian and mention that if you get a pack with say 20 or 50 cigs, you might have to resize it a little to match that packet! :)    And if you have a copy of Photoshop in your possession, here is a link to the .PSD file for the template: https://mega.co.nz/#!8gJQBYAD!P20vh-MJ2oU-Jjyb12emr6QydrZ034D_plR5aSjAWKI    Bless <3"

macdemarco,2lwuir,Rumsquall,1 point,Tue Nov 11 02:48:57 2014 UTC,Try a 432Hz instead of 435Hz(?). That's is how it is on Dreamin' so thats probably where you want to be.
macdemarco,2lwuir,RedditIsAwesome888,1 point,Tue Nov 11 00:07:35 2014 UTC,"He pitches his guitar down, then pitches it back up in editing.  Thats why it never sounds right played along with the albums."
macdemarco,2lwuir,hazabaza9,1 point,Tue Nov 11 02:13:43 2014 UTC,I find that they are all different because he doesn't seem to de-tune the guitar but actually the whole pitch of the song on the tape when/after recording.
macdemarco,2low59,MasterHaines,3,Sat Nov 8 18:12:27 2014 UTC,"I really hope it'll have the studio demo of 'Rolling Like A Dummy' on it.   Other than that, I imagine it'll have something to do with the '2 Demos' - as far as I know that was only released on vinyl and cassette.   Or, maybe it's to coincide with the '7"" Club' thing - perhaps all the tracks from that will be put to CD?"

macdemarco,2low59,cieran,3,Sun Nov 9 05:33:16 2014 UTC,hmm thats what i thought... kinda pointless tbh. especially releasing it on the same day as alex calder's lp is kinda weird. captured tracks wyd

I believe those are the correct notes in general, though, in the verse, the notes I indicated to be held over are chosen kind of willy nilly. Just the general rhythm as well.   I believe the progression for the ""noise solo"" goes something like (these are all bar chords):    G G G G C C C C x2 Em Am7 Em Am7 Em Am7 D D D D"

macdemarco,2lemsc,DeanPortman,1 point,Wed Nov 12 02:25:05 2014 UTC,"Oh, the tablature is located underneath the bars containing musical notes.

macdemarco,2lemsc,hazabaza9,1 point,Wed Nov 12 02:52:00 2014 UTC,I've had a try aswell and figure it's in an open tuning like Dreaming and that's maybe why they don't play it live? I'll have another listen and see if we can crack it!
macdemarco,2lemsc,BobisBadAss,1 point,Thu Nov 6 12:47:35 2014 UTC,"I've noticed that alot of songs are in open D like Dreaming, Eating Like A kid and Because I'm A Boy. So maybe youre on to something here.  They use so much chorus on some of their tracks so trying to distinguish any scale that they are playing in gets really hard, but at the same time the chorus makes it sound so much more mezmerizing.  Kinda like being car sick :P"
macdemarco,2lemsc,ShaqsHouse,1 point,Fri Nov 7 02:53:10 2014 UTC,Figured it out guys. I'll label the chords I know off the top of my head by name in parentheses. But it will all be in tab. Here we go.  From big E to little e in Standard tuning this is the chorus/opening:  xx5556 xx5555 xx2223 xx2222 (D7)xx0212  Then the verse does this three times:  (normal G)320003 x02030 (D7)xx0212  Then the last bit of the verse does something like this once before going back into the chorus:  (Em)022000 x02230 (D7)xx0212

After show we hung out with the man himself outside for a good hour and a half or so just chilling and talking. Mac is gonna let me show him out to some good Greek food in the city sometime (if he was being genuine, but either way it completely made my day/week/month/year/lifetime).

macdemarco,2lcwjo,GoldieLox1024,2,Wed Nov 5 16:19:23 2014 UTC,Was there too. One of the best live shows ever. I need video of that asap.
macdemarco,2lcwjo,Fantasysage,2,Wed Nov 5 15:44:09 2014 UTC,"So I made the mistake of bringing a coat and wearing glasses and a hat last night at the show at Terminal 5.   And so towards the end when Mac was crowd surfing I found myself in an interesting predicament.   So he's crowd surfing and I think to myself, ""it would be kind of cool to say I held up Mac DeMarco"". Boy did I get my wish. I notice him getting closer. Closer. Then in the blink of an eye he was on top of me. My glasses went one way, my hat the other. And I dropped my coat to use both hands to keep Mac up.   The next few minutes were a real blur (excuse my terrible blind person joke). But I eventually found my glasses and hat, then my coat (which had my vape and wallet in). Thankfully nothing was broken.    But hey, at least I got to hold up Mac DeMarco. Man was he sweaty. I think he lost a shoe to in the process."

macdemarco,2lcwjo,reallystickyglue,1 point,Thu Nov 6 16:21:17 2014 UTC,"Yea, I just wasn't expecting the crowd to be so rowdy. When I saw Mac open for Dr. Dog it was a lot more mellow, maybe because it was outside and a little older crowd.   But the worst part was I didn't even need a coat. I thought it was going to be cold out. Not the case in the slightest."

macdemarco,2l8n3h,BoeZaah_420,3,Tue Nov 4 07:33:01 2014 UTC,Yeah they're all shot on old VHS cameras which shoots to tapes. I used to do the same and then to digitalise them I'd playback the footage on the screen and record it with my digital camera.

macdemarco,2l8n3h,BoeZaah_420,2,Wed Nov 5 10:19:57 2014 UTC,It gave me the look I was going for and was the easiest and quickest method for me with the resources I had.

I don't know the exact setlist, but I remember him playing Ode to Viceroy, Blue Boy, Cooking Up Something Good, Annie, The Stars Keep Calling My Name, Still Together, Brother, Let Her Go, Let My Baby Stay, Treat Her Better, and Chamber of Reflection. I may be missing a few but those are the songs I remember him playing. He had the crowd cover lead guitar on Ode To Viceroy. Such a fun night."

macdemarco,2ktcv3,cocopuffschan,1 point,Thu Oct 30 20:16:04 2014 UTC,Sounds like a Digitech Whammy pedal. Same pedal Tom Morello used in RATM and Audioslave to get those weird dive-bomb sounds. I'm not 100% sure but it sounds like Pete uses this same pedal to get a lo-fi sound on some of his guitar parts on The Homeshake Tape. Specifically in the song Don't Try you can hear that the rhythm guitar has a harmony that's a couple of octaves down and kind of warbly which is characteristic of the Whammy.
macdemarco,2ktcv3,so0o,1 point,Fri Oct 31 03:05:41 2014 UTC,"Peter definitely has a Boss Harmonist, which he sometimes uses on his voice, he might be using it on his guitar there though"

Just go out back after or try to talk to some staff. Usually the band will be around beforehand, too. Got to talk to Pierce that way and I saw Joe and got to meet Mac after the show.  Word to the wise, if you do get to meet him don't fanboy all over him. He's a laid back dude and unless you're a hot chick just relax. Talk to him like a normal person, not the dude we all obsess over. Just something like ""hey man great show, my buddy couldn't it think I could grab an autograph or something?"""

That doesn't mean that you're wrong, but I have heard Mac talk about John Lent and how he's been mentioned in several songs, so I only assumed Johnny's Odyssey was about him."

I don't think he deserves that ""Fuck that no talent ass clown"" because he is where he is (signed and playing shows and shit) for a reason. It's just a matter of not appealing to us, in my opinion.

macdemarco,2jcti0,bminus02,1 point,Fri Oct 17 16:16:53 2014 UTC,"totally. i think a lot of things in my post got misconstrued, but that's part of the fun about text only internet posts. i was ranting in a negative way hoping more people would respond that way. ""Fuck that no talent ass clown"" was supposed to make people think of Michael Bolton from Office Space, talking about Michael Bolton. I figured it was a fun ""joke""/quote to use at the end of my overly negative rant, so I threw that in. Granted, noone realized it was a joke, maybe i should have put it in quotes, but yeah you're right no need for it. I did appreciate a lot of these people's posts, prolly yours the most cause it didn't bash me (haha!) but yeah, I'm an ass hole"

macdemarco,2ibufu,cocopuffschan,2,Sun Oct 5 22:23:07 2014 UTC,"It's an effects processor that can add reverb, delay, other effects like flanger; etc. Most guitarists prefer foot pedals for that sort of thing. Typically you'll use a foot pedal to live-control a rack unit anyways. Rack units are usually only used in studios."
macdemarco,2ibufu,a_surreal_goat,1 point,Mon Oct 6 08:27:17 2014 UTC,"It's also called a digital signal processor.  I can't identify the Yamaha (sorry), but in the album 2, Mac said he used an Alesis Microverb 4 so if you're going for some of his sounds you could probably find them from that unit. Found that info here."

macdemarco,2i3spg,pprrssmm,-1,Fri Oct 3 18:17:48 2014 UTC,how does it sound like odd future? it sounds like 70's japanese synth music... not everything with synths and a drum beat is fucking odd future

macdemarco,2ghmc9,golden_death,2,Tue Sep 16 14:18:31 2014 UTC,"sorry, I know this is old but thought I would reply anyway.  My number one recommendation if you haven't already done it would just be to get an interface and a mic and go for it.  There is a lot of trial and error but before too long you will be getting results that you are pleased with.  Reaper is a good free program to get started with if there aren't already ones that come with the interface you get.  Also, Gearslutz and TapeOp (free subcription!) are invaluable resources for learning about recording techniques and whatnot.  I have been recording by myself for years and the results are available at www.goldendeath.com  All the best to you!"

macdemarco,2g6qg7,jimismachinegun,3,Fri Sep 12 16:57:22 2014 UTC,I think Peter is trying to focus on Homeshake more. He has a new album coming out soon and probably wants to be around to play shows for that and not touring with Mac.

macdemarco,2g6qg7,ThatCricketJim,5,Fri Sep 12 19:58:37 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the info. It's interesting hearing stories about Mac and his band.  I'm not really surprised they are into partying, I have the feeling Mac is going to get pretty wild without kiera around to ground him.  It will be interesting to see what effect that has on his song writing. As for pete possibly not being into the drugs as much, I can definitely see it being really shitty to be around.  I'm envious you got to chill with him in a setting like that even if the experience was a little dark."

macdemarco,2g6qg7,eattherich_,2,Fri Sep 12 21:38:08 2014 UTC,"Mac's band is very much a rock n' roll kind of band.  Easy sleazy music full of party vibes, the way he does cover songs in a jokey kind of immature way.  All of this enables them to do drugs and party much harder than any other band because they can get away with it.  They've gotten lucky with the audience they've attained but the drugs don't help songwriting much.  Dan Aykroyd on SNL and drugs:   The cocaine was a problem. Not for me, it was never my favorite ... but it was around a lot, and it was affecting the work, the performance, the quality of the scripts ... wasting time, and that was bad.   Mac has been looking like a bloated corpse in recent interviews and media appearances.  All that alcohol and hangovers."
macdemarco,2g6qg7,coffeman3,2,Fri Sep 12 21:58:45 2014 UTC,"i remember in the narduar interview they talked about how he did shrooms but i thought he wasn't into drugs or anything, he said he barely even smoked weed."

Although it does seem like they've broken up, who knows, they could be trolling, but unlikely. But even if they're broken up, these things happen. It's life. Let him worry about it, not you."
macdemarco,2fyhr6,thisrawspine,9,Thu Sep 11 20:30:54 2014 UTC,"You know, it's unfortunate this subreddit is following the man's relationship like the kardashians or real housewives are followed by a different demographic. That being said, his songwriting will likely be affected by the state of his relationships. I think will will see a much more mature Mac over the course of his next few years/ albums. I welcome this, as his goofy band will get tiresome and gimmicky. Mac is a kid with an unusually large talent. I see him rising above the slag and assuming his place as a great songwriter, among the better men."

macdemarco,2fyhr6,CoopCooperberg,5,Wed Sep 10 02:34:13 2014 UTC,"If you watch macs google hangout session someone says ""don't dump Kiera for Angel Olsen"" and it gets awkward for a second.

macdemarco,2fyhr6,Bigcrotchhoagiez,4,Wed Sep 10 13:09:04 2014 UTC,"Mac's mum posts heaps of shit about kiki on facebook and how much she loves her. Plus if you went to or watched a show you would know they make shit up all the time and talk about how Pierce is gonna be a daddy, etc. Pretty safe to assume they are still dating. And for the people who complain about getting into his private life this is a subreddit devoted to mac... what else would you like to talk about, it isn't like there is always a constant flow of new music to discuss."
macdemarco,2fyhr6,kenthewolfboy,-1,Thu Sep 11 08:12:27 2014 UTC,"there are plenty of cool things to talk about and share other than ""omg noooo sweet kiki and mac."" you have to realize they deserve privacy and they don't owe you anything. how hard of a concept is it for this subreddit to understand that they have real lives? And saying ""i wrote this about my girlfriend at the time"" isnt really in mac joke format like white chocolate. just because you fucking added his mom on facebook does not give you superior insight either, people stay acquaintances after relationships all the time"
macdemarco,2fyhr6,aspl,2,Thu Sep 11 19:12:28 2014 UTC,"It appears so, if you watch this concert around the 42 minute mark he sings the verse about kiera and refers to her as his ex. But you never know, could be bullshit since he did also say she passed away in an interview."

He didn't refer to her as his ex, though I can see why you'd ascertain it that way. He's saying that he's been in more relationships than Kiera and just worded it awkwardly. In another performance of Still Together (or was it the Google Hangout video?) he says that Kiera had only had one boyfriend before him.  But what do I know, they could have very well split up  ¯_(ツ)_/¯"
macdemarco,2fyhr6,aspl,2,Tue Sep 16 13:02:37 2014 UTC,"Just after that he said ""the girl he was dating previously"", i.e Kiera? Fuck that's confusing, anyways, peace am sleepy :)"

macdemarco,2fexsb,srekcornaivaf,2,Thu Sep 4 02:20:57 2014 UTC,Just stick around once his set ends. 2 months ago in LA he literally finished playing walked down to the barrier and started signing everyones stuff! I've also heard he sometimes just hangs out outside the venue couple hours before just smoking. I've luckily met the man 3 times and hoping I get to meet him again at a show in November! Good luck!
macdemarco,2fexsb,moodyfloyd,2,Thu Sep 4 07:21:38 2014 UTC,"it isn't hard. as another said, he smokes outside a lot.  in cleveland he was just chilling on the back wall by himself during one of the openers. 10 mins later i saw a bunch of girls taking pics with him off to the side of the stage.  he seems to be all about fan interaction so just dont be shy"

macdemarco,2f6znw,chil7,7,Tue Sep 2 02:57:05 2014 UTC,People hear how crazy and wacky Mac shows are so they try to be all random and goofy to impress him or something. Really annoying to see.
macdemarco,2f6znw,North_Easy,3,Tue Sep 2 04:59:47 2014 UTC,Saw him at FYF this year and it was pretty sad to see him crowd surf and the crowd just grabbing and pulling on him
macdemarco,2f6znw,friendlessvirgin,5,Tue Sep 2 06:18:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah it can get pretty bad. He's got a cult like following but from what I've seen and heard he doesn't like the stardom because of crazy fans. I got to meet him after a show and he seemed happier to hear me say ""hey man I love your records, great show"" than the people drooling over him."
macdemarco,2f6znw,North_Easy,1 point,Tue Sep 2 13:47:28 2014 UTC,Can't blame him. I'd hate that too. Mac is too much of an easy-going guy for that shit.

macdemarco,2eif51,pocketbunny,1 point,Mon Aug 25 15:43:17 2014 UTC,Updated original post with verse chords
macdemarco,2eif51,pocketbunny,1 point,Tue Aug 26 06:09:20 2014 UTC,"Sorry for the late response and I'm sorry it is incomplete.  I'm pretty sure the song is in CMaj with the the verse chords being C Am G E E and the chorus being Dm Am Dm Am then two chords maybe F G? Sorry, I only got to sit down with it for a few minutes. The bass line pretty much follows the chords, so bass line for the Dm AM part of the chorus is D E A. It is hard to play along with the record because it sounds like he modulated the pitch.  This should be a good starting point though. Good luck."

macdemarco,2azaed,Billobatch,5,Thu Jul 17 19:15:46 2014 UTC,"He did the same kind of set in St Louis. He still managed to put on a hell of a show despite the lack of his band. Really got people hyped up and kept passing a bottle of whiskey around the crowd. He got nice and tipsy and just had a great time with the crowd. Everyone was singing along and he took requests and was super friendly the whole time.  Also someone gave him a Viceroy cigarette pool noodle which he loved. He also made a remark after The Stars Keep on Calling My Name, saying he wrote the song about Montreal, which he called ""a real shithole,"" and said ""there's an awful lot of French people around there...""  He got the crowd really riled up during the closer Still Together and staged dived three separate times. The last time he went all the way to the back of the pit and on his way back to the stage he was drinking a pbr tall boy and gave someone a high five, all while on his back.   People ended up flooding the stage to dance with him while the lead singer of his opener played his guitar and the bassist from the opener played a simple drum beat. The stage was full and his mic got knocked out so he stood at the front of the stage with like 50 people or more, and motioned for all people cheering to shush and then he thanked everyone for coming out.  At first, I was a little disappointed it was just him and his electric guitar, but I was still into it singing along and then after I left I started reflecting and thinking, damn that was actually a really great show.  TL;DR-Mac Demarco rolls with the punches and has charisma, and he's super friendly. I really think he's going to get super big if he keeps it up, but that could be me fanboying like a large amount of the rest of the audience.  Saw Modest Mouse and Mac Demarco in the last 4 days; it's been a good week.  Edit: Found a video of him doing Still Together with the flooded stage. Video cuts out about when he's starting the final surf. As you can tell it's pretty chaotic by the end; thought for sure security was gonna get involved haha:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsjM1xHe0sE"

macdemarco,2asclf,internetjohn,2,Tue Jul 15 19:21:44 2014 UTC,I think that just means you would pay more if you waited and bought your tickets at the door.  Sold out is sold out.
macdemarco,2asclf,CoopCooperberg,1 point,Wed Jul 16 05:28:17 2014 UTC,Yeah at this point all OP can really do is go down to the show and hope to find some scalpers. There will usually be people selling an extra ticket or something for not too expensive.

macdemarco,2arm7m,North_Easy,5,Tue Jul 15 19:33:37 2014 UTC,"Wow what a terrible interview. You can almost feel how uncomfortable Mac is by how short his answers are.

I wish she'd have just stopped with the ""tee hee im hitting on him during an interview"" thing after like 3 questions. It just got annoying. It was 80% about her."

macdemarco,29je4x,ZapoiBoi,5,Tue Jul 1 07:10:38 2014 UTC,"Hey, I went to see Mac while he was on tour in New Orleans. During the opening bands set he was just standing on the side of the stage talking, taking pictures, passing out cigarettes to anyone and everyone. Then, after the show, he sat on the edge of the stage and talked to people some more. In conclusion, try and get there early and keep your eyes peeled."
macdemarco,29je4x,doireallycare,3,Tue Jul 1 05:26:48 2014 UTC,"just went around to the back of the venue (beachland ballroom) a couple hours before the show and he was just there smoking and sitting around his tour van. hung out for like 10 min, helped him put a new bumper sticker on his van, chatted some, let him be after a short while."

macdemarco,25wxmx,LayOnTheLawn,4,Mon May 19 03:45:03 2014 UTC,Check out his old band Makeout Videotape if you haven't already! Peter Sagar (Mac's guitarist) also has his own solo project called Homeshake.
macdemarco,25wxmx,nggrlvr,1 point,Mon May 19 03:54:38 2014 UTC,Yeah -- I've checked out that stuff too! So great!
macdemarco,25wxmx,nggrlvr,2,Mon May 19 03:55:36 2014 UTC,I've got to ask - where is the similarity between Ween and Mac? I was told to check them out before because his style sounds like theirs and I don't find a similarity at all... What are some songs that remind you of him by Ween?
macdemarco,25wxmx,moodyfloyd,1 point,Mon May 19 04:00:58 2014 UTC,"""Rock and Roll Night Club"", ""She's Really All I Need"", ""Ode To Viceroy"" and a few others are pretty ween-like.  Ween being my favorite band, I've been listening to them them for my entire life actively. You really gotta know the ins and outs of both Ween and Mac's discography to hear the similarities.  If you want to get on the path of Ween, (which I totally recommended) start with ""Chocolate and Cheese."""
macdemarco,25wxmx,lukesnickers,2,Mon May 19 04:09:03 2014 UTC,I'll agree with that. Freedom of '76 is such a Mac sounding song. They're very similar artists once you start listening to both of them a lot.
macdemarco,25wxmx,lichenforest,2,Mon May 19 04:38:23 2014 UTC,"Not to mention that Mac is a HUGE inspiration on me.  I've actually started working on a neo-psycadelia project. It doesn't really sound like Mac's music, but still. I'm usually discouraged when I do this type of thing because I know how limited my resources are. (Mainly because I'm 14 and can barley play any instrument) But seeing how Mac goes about things when recording and playing music just makes me smile and think to myself, ""This looks super fun and I can totally do it if I really wanted to!""  Thank you so much, McBriare Samuel Lanyon ""Mac"" DeMarco."

macdemarco,25agvs,CSRoss,1 point,Sun May 11 17:09:33 2014 UTC,I'm no musician but in my opinion the vocals don't sound very good. I think its the fact you try to use so many so maybe try removing a few of the vocal tracks and sticking a little more to the original. It also sounds like you added some kind of effect like a slight echo (I think its just on the vocals but I can't tell). Besides the vocals all the instruments sound great. Just fix and/or work on your vocals and it will turn out to be a great cover. (Sorry the comment is a little late)

macdemarco,22coo6,fusrodalek,3,Mon Apr 7 00:37:06 2014 UTC,"Nope, tricky getting around the lot it was held at. Saw him sitting sidestage in between sets but after he walked off he seemed to disappear into the abyss."
macdemarco,22coo6,yvchen,2,Mon Apr 7 01:56:18 2014 UTC,"Oh that sucks, better luck next time you go see him!"
macdemarco,2275i9,nonex,7,Fri Apr 4 15:47:32 2014 UTC,"I saw him two nights in a row in Ohio and after the Cleveland show, Mac and the boys came back to my friend's house to drink beers and smoke cigs 'til the wee hours of the morn. So who's jealous now? ;]"
macdemarco,2275i9,slowitdown,4,Fri Apr 4 16:25:06 2014 UTC,"dang that's fuckin sweet. two nights in a row, were you in oberlin? i was at that show, it was awesome even though the sound sucked."
macdemarco,2275i9,yvchen,2,Fri Apr 4 17:59:39 2014 UTC,"Yep, went to the CLE and Oberlin shows. I'm glad I went the second night, Rock 'N Roll Night Club live was amazing!"
macdemarco,2275i9,slowitdown,3,Fri Apr 4 18:08:03 2014 UTC,"You win, you win :)"
macdemarco,2275i9,slowitdown,3,Fri Apr 4 18:02:37 2014 UTC,"It was very surreal, sitting at a dinner table, talking and laughing with Mac and the guys. I was kinda drunk and fanning out a little bit, hopefully I didn't make too much of an ass of myself."
macdemarco,2275i9,Lets-Tessellate,3,Fri Apr 4 18:16:24 2014 UTC,What was the new set list like? I'm gonna be seeing him sometime this summer and I'm stoked. Hopefully its a nice mix of 2 and Salad Days with Rock and Roll Night Club and of course all the covers they play.
macdemarco,2275i9,slowitdown,1 point,Sat Apr 5 14:41:04 2014 UTC,You've got the gist of it although they didn't play any covers. Actually they might have played one for the encore in Cleveland but I didn't recognize what it was. They played Rock and Roll Night Club during the encore at Oberlin the next night.
macdemarco,2275i9,fusrodalek,2,Sat Apr 5 20:05:53 2014 UTC,"He hasn't been doing the Limp Bizkit, ZZ Top and all the regular covers. He's been covering Johnathan Richman recently."
macdemarco,2275i9,moodyfloyd,2,Sun Apr 6 05:10:11 2014 UTC,i was hoping he was serious about not having a place to stay
macdemarco,2275i9,slowitdown,1 point,Sun Apr 6 16:09:22 2014 UTC,Did he say something about it at the show? I couldn't really hear that well because I was so close to the stage.
macdemarco,2275i9,moodyfloyd,2,Sun Apr 6 16:16:25 2014 UTC,"At one point the bassist said 'we need a place to stay tonight' sort of jokingly, then a few songs later Mac said 'we were serious about needing a place to stay'"
macdemarco,220m43,chil7,2,Wed Apr 2 14:55:24 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I agree with everything Fantano says, but I'd rate it more of a 7ish than a 5. It meets more than baseline standards, but never quite comes through all the way. There are no tracks on the same level as Viceroy/My Kind of Woman/Robson Girl unfortunately."
macdemarco,220m43,DeanPortman,3,Wed Apr 2 15:47:51 2014 UTC,"I agree. I still love the new album, but ""2"" was more solid."

macdemarco,21x4o1,enricohenryhank,10,Tue Apr 1 13:13:20 2014 UTC,"Hey, Mac's little bro Hank here. Personally I like this album a lot more than ""2"" as a whole. It's nice to listen to from start to finish, and I find not too many albums do that for me, his previous ones didn't. And I'm glad that's it's not too much of a departure from ""2"", he's making music that he wants to make, and it sounds great! I feel like if he all of a sudden tried to evolve, and change up for a new album the songs wouldn't seem as sincere, or real. To me at least. As a brother I'm proud, and as a fan I'm very happy with Salad Days."
macdemarco,21x4o1,chil7,6,Thu Apr 3 21:27:59 2014 UTC,"Is the song ""Brother"" about you?"
macdemarco,21x4o1,enricohenryhank,10,Mon Apr 7 03:30:59 2014 UTC,"No, after taking one listen to the lyrics I'm positive it isn't."
macdemarco,21x4o1,moodyfloyd,2,Tue Apr 8 23:17:14 2014 UTC,"Yeah in my opinion Salad Days really does flow well, heck even when it leaked back in February and i gave in and listened to it it still flowed with Let Her Go missing, its great how he kept a constant style while also keeping each track unique!"
macdemarco,21x4o1,jonald,6,Fri Apr 4 20:37:26 2014 UTC,"I can't get into full length discussion right now, love the album...but to comment on the concert last night...  Most intensity came from the popular tracks off of '2,' I assume due  to lack of familiarity with salad days, but it sounds good live. I really like passing out pieces live, and I hope if his sound goes in any other specific direction, that is the one.  Also, they must have repressed Nightclub because they had a ton on vinyl last night. Snagged that and salad days.  this doesn't need to be said but GO TO HIS SHOW ON THE SALAD DAYS TOUR. You won't leave disappointed.  Also, clevelanders suck at crowd surfing. Struggled to keep Mac up at times too."
macdemarco,21x4o1,GupNasty,5,Tue Apr 1 14:13:04 2014 UTC,the crowd last night at the beachland was fucking vile
macdemarco,21x4o1,BLogue,4,Tue Apr 1 21:19:24 2014 UTC,"Been listening since the leak. Been listening to Mac straight for the past 3 months ever since I discovered his music. A triple shot of mac demarco you could say. I really dig Salad Days for what it is, but I think I prefer 2, and may even venture to say that it has much more longevity than Salad Days. With that said, can't wait to see this man tomorrow!!!!"
macdemarco,21x4o1,BLogue,2,Wed Apr 2 02:32:14 2014 UTC,"Yeah imo 2 has had more longevity than Salad Days for me too, that album became like an addiction when i first started listening to it, was one of the only things i listened to for about 2 months!"
macdemarco,21x4o1,kittensmittens69,3,Fri Apr 4 20:36:16 2014 UTC,"Great album!  I think my favorite track would have to be ""Goodbye Weekend"", although ""Blue Boy"" and ""Passing Out Pieces"" are close contenders.  I find myself skipping a couple of the tracks however.  I think ""Let My Baby Stay"" drones on a little too much, could probably be a minute shorter than it is.    I don't think ""Let Her Go"" added much to the album either.  Having listened to the leak with ""Let Her Go"" not included, it flowed quite well, and didn't feel like a track was missing.  I found it interesting though that the Pitchfork article mentioned that Mac didn't even want to do ""Let Her Go"", and the leak didn't have that song...almost as if the leak was the album in the form that Mac originally intended.  Ending the album with a groovy instrumental I thought was a very brave move, and it pays off beautifully.  I find myself looking forward to this last track, and it brings completeness to the album in a way that a ""normal"" song might not have.  8/10 on the album overall!"
macdemarco,21x4o1,mattcrick,4,Tue Apr 1 15:40:38 2014 UTC,I'm glad I found someone else who finds Goodbye Weekend to be the best track on the album. None of my friends agree
macdemarco,21x4o1,doireallycare,2,Wed May 21 04:06:56 2014 UTC,So good.  Just makes me happy every time I hear it.
macdemarco,21x4o1,fusrodalek,2,Thu May 22 00:16:18 2014 UTC,That makes three of us!
macdemarco,21x4o3,moardownboats,7,Tue Apr 1 13:13:21 2014 UTC,"I'm probably reading too much into this, but I find it interesting that Mac didn't want to do the song ""Let Her Go"", and didn't want it on the album.  The album leak a month or so ago didn't have the track Let Her Go...makes me wonder if that leak was Mac's way of saying ""This is how I really wanted the album to be"".  Again, I may be reading into it too much, but it's something to think about."
macdemarco,21x4o3,BLogue,3,Tue Apr 1 15:32:04 2014 UTC,"he played it last night, and based on the response by the crowd, it is easily one of his most popular songs on the album at this point in time.  not that this discounts your theory, but just something i thought i could add."
macdemarco,21x4o3,moodyfloyd,2,Tue Apr 1 15:51:17 2014 UTC,"Hmm, yea I guess if he truly had disdain for this song he wouldn't be playing it live.  Good point."
macdemarco,21x4o3,BLogue,2,Tue Apr 1 16:01:53 2014 UTC,"I could be totally wrong as I don't fully remember where I read it but I'm pretty sure I read in an interview that he just didn't want to put it on the album because it needed a filler and that he'd prefer to not try to push it as a new song. I don't think he dislikes it, he just wanted to leave it how it was and not have it a ""Salad Days"" song."
macdemarco,21x4o3,fusrodalek,2,Tue Apr 1 20:58:32 2014 UTC,"Then again, Mike Sniper of CT pushed for a ""commercially ready"" song that could be televised/put on radio and I think Let Her Go was birthed from that idea. Perhaps Mike suggested it be put on Mac's setlist to ""test the waters"", so to speak. Also Mac's said he's super bored of playing the same tracks live so I don't think he'd oppose playing any Salad Days tracks live."
macdemarco,21v6x8,billmeister123,2,Mon Mar 31 22:03:38 2014 UTC,his old stuff going as mold boy is great too btw https://moldboy.bandcamp.com/album/mold-boy-memory-resolve

macdemarco,21whn2,dunbridley,2,Tue Apr 1 06:11:54 2014 UTC,"This was originally written back the '70s and I can see where you hear some similarities. Dunno if Mac is into pop country from back then but I think it's a great, catchy-ass song."
macdemarco,21whn2,Saltyduckbutter,1 point,Tue Apr 1 17:36:57 2014 UTC,"Ahh, good find. Hearing Still Together really triggered something in my brain with a long forgotten relationship with brooks & dunn (forced not chosen)."
macdemarco,21t75a,fusrodalek,1 point,Mon Mar 31 06:46:45 2014 UTC,"well on his video ""test press"" you can see he has a recorded version of it (a demo most probably) so there is a version out there that is recorded, but if he will ever release it is another story, maybe it will come out with the wonderful world of mac demarco 7"" club or something, who knows!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EotfFUD95ro"
macdemarco,21t75a,billmeister123,2,Mon Mar 31 19:08:04 2014 UTC,That'd be tight. I found this song through the test press video.
macdemarco,21q03f,mattcrick,4,Sun Mar 30 03:22:40 2014 UTC,"It's Makeout Videotape off the album Ying Yang. If anyone hasn't checked out makeout videotape, do it. It's different than the Mac we all know now but it's still great.   It was from a few years ago when he was living in Vancouver (I believe) with Alex Calder."
macdemarco,21q03f,fusrodalek,0,Sun Mar 30 05:30:15 2014 UTC,"So if it's Makeout Videotape, then how come it's credited as Mac Demarco?"
macdemarco,21q03f,billmeister123,3,Sun Mar 30 06:24:45 2014 UTC,"Poor titling, I guess."
macdemarco,21q03f,billmeister123,1 point,Sun Mar 30 08:02:25 2014 UTC,"Because Makeout Videotape was Mac Demarco and Alex Calder. I guess someone was either confused and recognized Mac in the video, saw someone else s video labeled that way, or they thought more people would watch if it was credited as Mac.   So while crediting it as Mac Demarco isn't technically wrong, it'd be like crediting a Pink Floyd song as David Gilmour."
macdemarco,21q03f,ratfinkprojects,1 point,Sun Mar 30 21:45:23 2014 UTC,"Well actually Makeout Videotape was pretty much just Mac, sure Alex helped out occasionally but most of the time it was just mac recording, Alex just played in the band for live shows etc."

He doesn't just have great songs fall out of his asshole, he sits down, smokes a few packs of cigarettes and makes them happen."

It was interesting to hear him talk about how people know so much about him from his music because how much goofy personal Mac-ness he puts into it just from styling around, and he doesn't even realize how much of his life is actually in his music. Also didn't know Salad Days was about his 6 month transition since the move to New York, seriously, what an interesting guy."

macdemarco,1xkwp6,billmeister123,5,Tue Feb 11 03:17:10 2014 UTC,I feel like Mac is the type of guy who is overzealous in sharing his album and it fell into wrong hands.
macdemarco,1xkwp6,DyedInkSun,4,Tue Feb 11 21:03:51 2014 UTC,"Definitely evident in the way Mac introduced new songs live; he was saying stuff like ""my label's been telling me to keep quiet but my new album is called salad days and it comes out April 1st."""

I had braces, but we both used to have that trademark gap tooth of his. He looks a lot like our dad, and me like our mom. Not too much actually. Once in high school (where I was almost arrested for being underage), but I got to see him twice here in Calgary about a year ago. Since I'm busy training and touring with Ballet, and him being a rockstar I only get an opportunity every now and then.   Here's a picture of us and our Mommy when they visited me in Calgary at Christmas"
macdemarco,1wcbzr,doireallycare,3,Tue Jan 28 04:34:46 2014 UTC,"I've been having a great couple of days, and this just made it better. Thanks for taking some time to talk to us. We're all huge fans of your brother. Would you like to name drop your Ballet so we can see you?"
macdemarco,1wcbzr,doireallycare,7,Tue Jan 28 04:41:21 2014 UTC,"Yeah no problem, I'm on Reddit all the time so it's no bother. I currently go to the School Of Alberta Ballet, which only really performs in Calgary, but occasionally I do small roles for the company Alberta Ballet. Nothing extravagant, usually no dancing involved. Next year I'm most likely going to be attending Royal Winnipeg Ballet, and auditioning for professional companies. Gotta keep up with my brother, he's setting the bar ridiculously high haha."
macdemarco,1wcbzr,doireallycare,4,Tue Jan 28 04:52:45 2014 UTC,It's cool that you have your own thing too. Ever thought about asking Mac if you could dance around on stage for a hometown show?
macdemarco,1wcbzr,nonex,5,Tue Jan 28 04:57:47 2014 UTC,"Nah that's not really how I roll haha. Besides I don't live at home anymore, I'm close, but the family is in Edmonton, a 4 hour drive from me."
macdemarco,1wcbzr,racthel,2,Tue Jan 28 05:12:10 2014 UTC,"Ah. Oh well, thanks for coming talk to us."
macdemarco,1wcbzr,billmeister123,3,Tue Jan 28 05:13:49 2014 UTC,Anytime!
macdemarco,1wcbzr,BLogue,7,Tue Jan 28 06:00:08 2014 UTC,"Dude, awesome of you to stop by!  I started this sub after discovering Mac over on /r/ween when someone posted a link to Cookin' Up Something Good.  There was a sound about that song that resonated with me and after meeting your bro at a show in Ottawa, it all clicked. Turns out he's using a Fostex A8 reel to reel for his recordings, the same machine I had used for years and years when I was recording music. I could hear the frikken warmth and character that is particular to that 1/4 inch 8 track.  And on top of that he was living in my old neighbourhood in Montreal in Mile End. How cool is that?  You should be proud of your freak of a brother, he's ooozing talent and charisma. He should write a ballet for you one of these days. I'd pay to see that."
macdemarco,1wcbzr,elldrick,5,Tue Jan 28 13:30:52 2014 UTC,"Yeah no prob, I'm an avid redditor, so I was curious to see if he had a following on here. He's one hell of a guy. I am proud of him! I never thought he would actually do well in this industry because he's so fucking weird (he's been like that since the day he was born), but people seem to love it! Haha. Yeah maybe one day we will work together, but we both have gone down very different paths, so I don't see it happening for a while."
macdemarco,1wcbzr,BLogue,5,Tue Jan 28 20:50:48 2014 UTC,HI HANKLE
macdemarco,1wcbzr,adga77,8,Tue Jan 28 04:48:36 2014 UTC,Hey Heather <3.
macdemarco,1wcbzr,fusrodalek,4,Tue Jan 28 04:53:08 2014 UTC,You brother is dope! I really look up to your brother and his tunez
macdemarco,1wcbzr,constantmeow,7,Tue Jan 28 06:51:19 2014 UTC,He's a pretty crazy dude.
macdemarco,1wcbzr,Koaty,4,Tue Jan 28 20:43:01 2014 UTC,what is the craziest thing you witness your brother do?
macdemarco,1wcbzr,hank_kingsley,15,Tue Jan 28 20:45:59 2014 UTC,"Other than the whole drumstick thing, I don't have a certain event in mind, more like a collection of typical Mac mannerisms and stuff. For example, I love to take baths, always have. When we lived together he would bust into the bathroom and take a massive shit, while serenading me with guitar as well. It pissed me off to no end.   Other times I would come home and he'd be butt naked playing guitar, filming a music video, or just chilling. He always made my friends uncomfortable too, all of them have a ""Mac story."""
macdemarco,1wcbzr,Koaty,3,Tue Jan 28 23:36:30 2014 UTC,"The whole drumstick shenanigans was the bases for the song "" Freaking out the neighborhood"" is that correct?  What is the full story about the Drumsticks? I have only heard rumors about it.I take it your mother did not enjoy that story to much. How was her initial reaction to finding out about it?  Haha I can only imagine growing up with Mac that must have been a real riot. Though I feel your pain older brothers really like to piss off younger siblings."
macdemarco,1wcbzr,tristans88,8,Wed Jan 29 06:50:44 2014 UTC,"I think so, but I'm not too sure. He pretty much went to someone else's show, got really drunk, and just happened to have backing tracks of his own stuff (and beautiful day) with him. People started taking his clothes off, and once you're naked what do you do? Shove a drumstick up your ass obviously! It was a really small show, there were only a few people there. My mom was worried he was getting into bad crowds and things, but I helped her realize that Mac's just a crazy dude that does weird shit haha."
macdemarco,1wcbzr,modernfuturist,3,Thu Jan 30 19:53:22 2014 UTC,Did you really rent out Mac's pocket pussy to a lot of your friends? sounds hilarious!
macdemarco,1w3a9f,billmeister123,3,Sat Jan 25 03:47:23 2014 UTC,"I want to hear a studio version, or at least a full band version so badly."
macdemarco,1w3a9f,doireallycare,2,Sat Jan 25 04:09:09 2014 UTC,"April 1st brother, its gonna be a hard wait :("
macdemarco,1w3a9f,fusrodalek,2,Sat Jan 25 22:10:50 2014 UTC,Been waiting for that full band since the acoustic set. C'MON MAN
macdemarco,1vuez8,fusrodalek,2,Wed Jan 22 11:41:34 2014 UTC,Dreams. They're trying their fucking best to come true.
macdemarco,1vuez8,Saltyduckbutter,1 point,Wed Jan 22 22:59:03 2014 UTC,"Well, my speculation has been officially shot dead. Mike Sniper of Captured Tracks just told me no collabs just yet."

macdemarco,1vuez8,Koaty,1 point,Thu Jan 23 00:27:47 2014 UTC,"I don't think so dude, but it would be really awesome."
macdemarco,1vrqne,billmeister123,2,Tue Jan 21 16:28:35 2014 UTC,Any details on when this is coming out?
macdemarco,1vrqne,nonex,2,Tue Jan 21 17:12:21 2014 UTC,April 1st!
macdemarco,1vrqne,Koaty,2,Tue Jan 21 18:45:59 2014 UTC,New Mac and new Howler announced on the same day. I'm in heaven.
macdemarco,1vrqsj,billmeister123,1 point,Tue Jan 21 16:29:54 2014 UTC,Youtube link
macdemarco,1vrqeu,billmeister123,3,Tue Jan 21 16:26:22 2014 UTC,So happy he's still using that old Fostex A8 reel to reel for recording. It's totally part of his sound.
macdemarco,1valyg,moodyfloyd,1 point,Wed Jan 15 19:00:39 2014 UTC,"also from the same website, a link to an interview with mac and he plays a few new songs"

macdemarco,1rw7yl,link3988,2,Mon Dec 2 06:06:22 2013 UTC,I'm on the wrong continent! Did you take any pics?
macdemarco,1rw7yl,nonex,1 point,Mon Dec 2 16:09:35 2013 UTC,"I took a couple, but they were before I moved closer to the stage so they are kind of far out. I can upload after work."
macdemarco,1misxv,moon-milk,3,Mon Sep 16 19:49:31 2013 UTC,"unbelievably cool, funny, and charming dude. some girl asked who he was and he said ""hi, i'm mac. i'm 23. and i have this case of beer, would you like one?"""
macdemarco,1misxv,nonex,2,Mon Sep 16 19:49:49 2013 UTC,Totally awesome. Dude is oozing charisma. Did he play a show in the area?
macdemarco,1ly4y6,nonex,1 point,Sun Sep 8 01:47:57 2013 UTC,Just found this sub. Can't believe I missed this :(
