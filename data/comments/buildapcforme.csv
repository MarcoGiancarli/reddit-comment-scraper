Check the benchmarks for your build first. This will give you the possible frame rates for your desired resolutions.   Now take fps and multiply by the resolution.

Well an upgrade for the cpu is necessary if you want to play most modern games. This i3 is my recommendation, but in many games you could probably get away with an overclocked g3258. The games you listed aren't particularly cpu intensive, so that's a viable option. But it wouldn't be a bad idea to get sometime a bit more future proof in case a game comes out that you want to play. In any case the core 2 duo isn't going to get anywhere nowadays. It's only got 2 cores. And they're slow, impotent cores. Maybe if we were talking a well overclocked core 2 quad or core 2 extreme."

buildapcforme,3e4wx2,THE_TRUE_ANOMALY,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:58:02 2015 UTC,"I chose the i7 over the i5 because you mentioned you will be doing streaming.  If you want to stream at good quality and high bitrate, you'll want to opt for the i7 over the i5.  I also chose the unlocked version because the only reasonably priced mobo that would work well with a white color scheme is the mobo I chose..which happens to be a Z97, which allows you to overclock.  I figured even if you might not want to overclock now, you might want to do it in the future.  Better to have the option than not at all.  Also included a CPU cooler if you do decide to overclock.  Easier to install now when the parts are separate than to take apart your computer in the future just to install it.  An all white theme would not be possible unless you want to spend a lot more money on just aesthetics. It will basically perform the same but ALL white components  come at a premium.  I feel like the parts I chose will go well with the white color scheme.  Nothing out of place.

One for the engine, and one for everything else. It claims to use up to 32 cores, however in reality it uses two cores + a bunch of others for tiny tasks. Jumping from an i5 to an i7 will see 0-2% performance boost. It has been tested constantly, and very, very few (single digit) games get anything out of hyperthreading."

buildapcforme,3e32a5,twogbsd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:57:58 2015 UTC,He didn't mention the GPU in the reusing any parts section so I completely missed it. Editing the build now.
buildapcforme,3e32a5,Zarzuh,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:16 2015 UTC,You forgot to add Micro Center as an option for your build. That moterhboard is kind of slacking and might not give the best overclock. 16 GB's of RAM is a waste for gaming and will not affect performance. I'm pretty sure it's easier and safer to just pirate Windows than buying it off a user on reddit. Going with a 100% legitimate copy from a retail store is the best option.

Try stress-testing the pc though just to check if everything works fine and advertise it as a nice pc to do day-to-day tasks as browsing the web and etc. because it won't handle new games that well.

SSD: Have the same one, love it, Samsung makes great SSDs. HDD: WD Caviar Blue's are great drives, especially for the good price. GPU: Awesome new card that is similar (if not better) than a 970 for the same price. Case: Decent case, usb 3.0, rather basic design, good for the price.

buildapcforme,3e44dc,Abazors,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:11:08 2015 UTC,"Tower, OS, Monitor (over 60hz, preferably with speakers but not necessary), keyboard (mechanical, maybe backlit, also not necessary)   144 Hz monitor + mech. keyboard is going to be $500-$600. You're going to be using much of your budget on your peripherals. Just making sure you understand that. You will likely not have enough graphical power to adequately use 144 Hz on modern games without a 980/980 Ti.

buildapcforme,3e447u,Sr_wild,5,Tue Jul 21 20:24:36 2015 UTC,Do you understand what Hackintosh involves? It is not simply plugging in components.

You will more than likely have to put in hours of troubleshooting and tutorials before you can get a Hackintosh machine running smoothly. It is also not very cheap.

RAM has no performance affect on gaming. LinusTechTips proved this here. He also compared DDR3 to DDR4 here with no performance difference. RAM is RAM, MHz and latency mean absolutely nothing in this scenario.  You sacrificed performance for hyperthreading and an aftermarket cooler which will have minimal affect on gaming performance. The GPU should be the most important part of any gaming PC."

It costs the same as the one I had in before, but it supports overclocking more, so if you choose to upgrade to a 4690k or something similar in the future, you'll be able to take advantage of that. It also has more RAM slots, so you could upgrade to 32 GB, as opposed to a max of 16 GB on the H97 board. Other than that, it's basically the same board but with a bigger form factor.

Want to have a 30% buffer room or else it's going to be running at 80% at load @ 850W  which isn't great for the life of the PSU.

At his budget, he can definitely afford it and you basically have all the parts necessary to allow for overclocking.

Since you aren't overclocking the Fury X is a better pick. As of now, the Fury X performs on par with the GTX 980 Ti, but it's a card with very new tech, and there are already drivers rolling out that greatly improve performance. AMD cards are weird, some improve with time, and it seems that the Fury X is one of these cards.   CrossFire also scales better than SLI, so in a dual card configuration, without overclocks, the Fury X is the better pick. (Benchmarks here and benchmarks here)  TL;DR: For your use, dual Fury Xs > dual GTX 980 Tis.  Another reason why I went AMD is because it allowed me to save some money by using an H97 board and a Xeon instead of a Z97 and an i7. SLI needs a Z-series board, which is more expensive. Since you aren't overclocking, a H97 and a Xeon will perform identically to an i7.   If you want to game on three high res monitors, your frames won't be fantastic. Another reason why I went AMD is because of adaptive sync. During your relatively low frames, you'll encounter some problems, which are alleviated by adaptive sync.   NVIDIA has adaptive sync as well, called G-SYNC, but G-SYNC monitors are roughly $200 more expensive than their FreeSync counterparts. Three FreeSync monitors will provide the best <60fps experience at $600 cheaper than the NVIDIA option.  I also changed the keyboard from the other comments' suggestions. Corsair keyboards are overpriced, kind of low quality (for the price), and their logo looks like a tramp stamp. Cooler Master makes more solid keyboards at a lower price.  EDIT: When you get automatic downvotes for suggesting AMD :)))))) even though you cite why it's better for this situation"
buildapcforme,3e1mb2,kht120,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:55:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would go with AMD if AMD supported the NVIDIA shield. NVIDIA also has kind of been a dick lately to the gaming community with TressFX being available for AMD and NVIDIA, but Hairworks only for NVIDIA. While I know this is very bad business practice and I know the gaming community thinks NVIDIA is literally Hitler or something like that, I know that I can't immediately change any of this and I'll just go with what runs the most games best."

You could downgrade the GPU to an R9280X and use a smaller HDD to save some money. CPU not overclockeable, but IMO it's not worth it anyway.  It has a small Samsung SSD for the system, and 8GB of memory. You do not need more, probably even 4GB would work (another opportunity to save a little)  Monitor is not included, neither are keyboard or mouse. Parts are good quality, nice case for the price. The way it is now it should be good for games with higher demands than you listed at high settings. So it's pretty future proof, insofar as that's possible.  Not sure how this works for you in Portugal, most stuff you can probably get from Amazon, but if you order it all from a single German internet shop they will probably ship it for 15 Euros or so. The site I linked to allows you to calculate what's cheapest for you, ordering from a single vendor or multiple vendors with more shipping costs."

buildapcforme,3e1zd4,EdwardTennant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:12:17 2015 UTC,"Depends. If you have a powerful enough system and are gaming a lot, 144hz. But this PC may not be able to push 144fps in all games. 1440p is better for more screen space as you have more pixels. If you have the money, go for a g-sync monitor. These have variable refresh rates so you don't get any screen tearing."

buildapcforme,3e1o1q,al4nw31,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:55:24 2015 UTC,650W is plenty for the build..850W is a pretty unnecessary expense.    What are you basing the reviews on the mobo from?  I don't bother trusting PCPartPicker ratings that much anymore.  They're not always accurate.
buildapcforme,3e1o1q,AwkwardCow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:01:40 2015 UTC,"As to the first, it's not because of the wattage that I swapped the power supply, I swapped because the build quality of the G2 series eclipses that of the NEX series. I am basing the reviews of the motherboard through reviews on Amazon and Newegg. I usually do not pay too much attention to PCPartPicker reviews as well."

buildapcforme,3e1o1q,AwkwardCow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:14:23 2015 UTC,"Ah, don't look at that tier list too strictly. The NEX is perfectly acceptable in mid-range applications, and has scored considerably well on many of the reviews that it has received. It has significantly better construction than some of the other power supplies in the same ""tier"". However, in a build like this, you want something that you know will not blow out the components, as a safety precaution."

buildapcforme,3e1o1q,AwkwardCow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:21:12 2015 UTC,"Yup, by the way, extra wattage in a system means less heat and load on the PSU, which also can give the PSU extra lifespan. So if you absolutely have to throw in a crappy PSU, just throw in some extra watts to keep the PSU load fairly light! And yes, the PSU is absolutely essential to keeping the components safe!"

buildapcforme,3dzbpy,Thonatron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:02:58 2015 UTC,It's a nzxt h440.
buildapcforme,3dzbpy,Thonatron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:24:50 2015 UTC,"Updated based upon the case and with some changes. I assume all of the h440s are probably the same in build design.  I wanted to change that pentium but there's not really a ton of play-around room in the budget. Either way, it will definitely handle CS:GO and GMod at peak performance on stock speeds plus you can OC the hell out of it with that cooler when you decide to get on that. You might want to consider upgrading to an i5 somewhere down the line, either a 4440 or a 4690k or something in between, depending on your price range. The 270x will do the job. It's pretty equivalent in terms of performance to the 750ti in the previous build, but the 750ti has a much lower power consumption. This motherboard does NOT support SLI though so you won't be running two 750ti cards on it. It does support crossfire however if you wanna buy a second R9 down the road. The choice of one over the other really depends on who you ask I believe, they will both run your CS:GO and GMod with fantastic performance on 1080p though. Feel free to switch one out for the other. The board also supports USB 3.0 headers and overclocking. Switched the PSU out for a somewhat cheaper NZXT branded one with a higher wattage one that's also fully modular with 80+ bronze certification. Changed the RAM to a slightly cheaper brand. Cooler and hard drive stayed the same.  Edit: typos  Plus, that PSU is white and the mobo is blue, I didn't bother with any kind of color scheme because it would push certain parts of the build over the budget to get picky about colors.

buildapcforme,3dzs5u,SkillerChamp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:34 2015 UTC,"Something I can contribute to, finally. I built my PC in Dubai as well btw and the place to get everything you need would be Al Ain Centre. Just google it to get directions. Many stores there, with different prices, you can haggle most of the time. Prices are sometimes lower, same, or higher compared to the price in dollars. Depends on some parts, I know for a fact that my h100i was cheaper in AED than in USD. For CPU you might want to go i5 4690 since you don't intend to overclock, pair that with an h97 mobo and you have a great backbone for cheaper than overclockable counterparts. Further than that I can't make anymore recommendations as I am not very experienced at putting systems together. If you can get away with it I'd use a TV as a monitor in order to maximise performance of your PC, I didn't do that, but my budget was a bit higher than yours. A GTX 970 would be the ideal graphics card of choice here, or its AMD counterpart the 390. I'd recommend a 600-700 watt PSU to give you headroom to run cards in sli should you choose to do that down the line. Ram should be about 8gb, my personal recommendation would be a one stick configuration so its easier to upgrade to a larger capacity by just adding another identical stick. I am not sure how well you can stick to your black/red theme as the reference cooler on the CPU is blue, and I don't know of any coolers that are black or red or even both. While you might not necessarily need it, the hyper 212 evo is an inexpensive and great cooler that may improve the overall aesthetic of the inside of the build while providing better temps and lower noise. That's all I can offer you in advice, its up to someone more experienced than me to generate a build for you, either applying my rec commendations or doing their own thing. Good luck mate."

The only differences are the CPU and motherboard. The first build has a 4790K while the second build has a 4790. The only differences are that the 4790K is overclockable and has a 400 more MHz over the 4790. Having the capability to overclock in the future will be very beneficial in the next four years or so and the extra 400 MHz will add a slight boost to rendering performance. The first build has a motherboard that is more appropriate for overclocking while the second build has a motherboard that isn't made to overclock. If you're willing to spend an extra ~$50 I would definitely go with the first build.

The GPU I picked runs off an Nvidia Kepler chip and is freaking expensive, although it fits the budget. You can try to get one used, professionals change their rigs quite often and these cards can be had refurbished on ebay.  I picked a very good monitor from Dell, IPS panel, LED backlight, 1440p, very bright, matte screen, comes with a color calibration certificate. I have this monitor and it's beautiful. Also backlit keyboard from Logitech for those long dark nights, an ergonomic wireless mouse from Logitech and a Space Mouse for CAD. Trust me you will love this thing. The bigger ones with more programmeable buttons are even better but freaking expensive (320 USD), although sometimes you can get them used on ebay for about 100 bucks. Got mine like that (refurbished).  I put in a Quad-core Xeon on a Z97 board with Intel ethernet (better than Realtek). Many people recommend the Xeon over the i7, the difference is that the Xeon has no onboard graphics and is not overclockeable.  500 GB SSD is good for the system and as a workspace, while the 2TB is for data backup / music / videos. Add extra HDDs as needed.  Noise level: Ultra-quiet.  Fanless PSU with 7 years warranty, quiet CPU cooler, stealthy and quiet black case, a Noctua PWM case fan added on for additional quietness. It can run as low as 300 rpm and is inaudible even at 700 rpm. There are two 140 mm fans in this case already, so this is optional.

buildapcforme,3dy9e9,lol_alex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:22:36 2015 UTC,"If you head over to r/buildapc, there's a ton of videos linked in the sidebar. Everyone can build a PC. Take your time, follow the instructions, go step by step.  It is really easy to do with a Philips screwdriver and some common sense and reading the mainboard manual. The last one tells you where all the cables need to go.  I do it this way:   install the drives. No tools required in your case. install the mainboard. Add CPU, CPU cooler (don't forget thermal compound) and memory to it first. Easier to do outside the case. Be sure to touch something metal to ground any static charge in your body before touching electronics. install the GPU. put the power supply in. Four screws in the back of the case and you're done. cables. I do power cables first, they tend to be harder to route but are also pretty rugged, while Sata cables are delicate little things with tiny plugs that I do last.   You have a 24 pin and a 4 or 8 pin power cable to the mainboard. Your GPU needs a PCI Express power cord directly from the PSU. Each drive needs power. That's it. You have a modular power supply, which means you only plug in the power cables that you need, not all of them. The sockets on the PSU are clearly marked and only fit in their proper place in the right orientation.  Route all the cables behind the mainboard tray (behind the right-side panel), the case allows for it and it makes for better airflow.  Fans (case and CPU) plug into the mainboard, as well as the small twisted-pair cables from the case: power button, reset button, front USB, hard disk and power LED plugs. Your mainboard manual tells you where those should go. The colored cord of the two is always plus while white is ground. Important only for the LEDs. The buttons don't give a damn.   Finally, SATA cables. From each drive to the mainboard. Nothing you can do wrong there. Nowadays windows doesn't even require the boot drive to be plugged into SATA port 1 anymore. connect monitor, power cord, ethernet, keyboard and mouse. Power it on and go straight to the BIOS menu. Most things should be visible there (drives, fan speeds, suchlike. If some hardware does not apppear, it either has no power or no data connection. Set time, date and restart. install windows. Easy. With an internet connection it will in most cases download current drivers for your hardware. If not, you have the CD that came with the mainboard. Sometimes the ethernet driver is the one that Windows bitches about, which in turn prevents it from downloading all other drivers lol. get a certified driver for your GPU. Depends on your CAD program. Solidworks for instance supplies certified drivers from their homepage, some just recommend a certain driver release that is proven to work (might not be the latest one!)   If you need to troubleshoot, we're here."

buildapcforme,3dy9e9,lol_alex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:53:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but you are completely missing the point.  You are comparing the GPUs based on framerates at a certain resolution, something a CAD user couldn't care less about. We care about polygons and double digit precision. CAD users tend to stare at non-moving pictures with great detail ;-)  A gaming GPU sucks at CAD, and vice versa. The tasks they perform could not be more different, google it.  I have dual SLI GTX 970s at home but they are easily outperformed in CAD by the old Quadro FX 1800 I have in my workstation at work, which is 4 years old. The CAD software doesn't even recognize my GPUs as CAD-worthy and refuses to avtivate surface rendering."

buildapcforme,3dxzuf,Osmarov,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:04:52 2015 UTC,"I went with two builds, they difference is in the graphics output. One has one fast high resolution monitor, the other one has two slightly lower resolution monitors. Because of the lower resolution you could theoretically even downgrade the GPU but I didn't do that. Both builds have a red/black theme. I really enjoy paying attention to esthetics so if you prefer me to pay more attention to output I could probably make something looking less awesome but with the option of a small second monitor in build 1.

I went with not overclocking CPU, in the second build there is room to change this. The CPU cooler is definitely up for the task, so it could be an interesting option but in sense of gaming performance you won't gain much from it anymore so I decided to save you some money instead. CPU Cooler: I went with a custom water cooling kit. This is a really good water cooling kit and it fits in the red theme that I picked for you. If you're not comfortable with a custom water cooling kit it can be changed to an all-in-one cooler but this will definitely look cool and there are really helpful guides on the internet to install this. Motherboard: Really great motherboard for the price! Best motherboard that is not Z97 (which is really only useful when going for overclocking. And nice red/black theme, which I picked for you. Memory: What can I say, memory is memory. Really the only thing in real world performance that matters is the amount. And maybe you want it to look nice. I choose these sticks so the red would work with the red and black theme. Storage: A slightly bigger SSD so you can install the few programs that you use often on there. And a big drive to allow for a lot of storage Video Card: Best single card out there, with a really great cooler as well. Since I picked the custom water cooling kit for you you could in principle also get a water cooling kit for the GPU (especially in build 2 there's budget for that) but I liked this option better for now. Case: You said you had a preference for this case and it's a really good case so I kept it. Power Supply: Powerful and high quality power supply. It's also fully modular so you could look at resleeving your power supply cables to look even better. Keyboard: I don't know much about keyboards but this one had good reviews, but in any case try them out, see what feels nice for you. Mouse: I personally really like this mouse but once again it depends on your preference. Monitors: In build 1 it's a 1440p 144Hz monitor that will be high frequency (and G-sync) for shooters like BF4 while also having a nice high resolution. The second build has two 1080p monitors, one 144Hz and one 60 (this because in the first build there was no more money for a second monitor). Since you'll only be gaming on the 144Hz 1080p monitor you might even be able to downgrade the GPU to save some more money but this GPU will give you enough power for years to come for that setup for sure (while others might start struggling at some point)     Hope you like it and If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask."
buildapcforme,3dxzuf,Osmarov,2,Mon Jul 20 14:51:50 2015 UTC,"The first build looks gorgeous. I definitely enjoy aesthetics too, however I have had the bane of an awful laptop for around 4 years now - output is everything!! What are the benefits of that particular 980 Ti you listed?"
buildapcforme,3dxzuf,Osmarov,2,Mon Jul 20 21:21:07 2015 UTC,"Best air cooler, so best overclocking potential. Disadvantage is that it's 3 slots wide. And the looks I like but some people hate it."
buildapcforme,3dxzuf,Osmarov,2,Mon Jul 20 21:52:25 2015 UTC,"Changed build 1 to include a better PSU, 2 memory sticks instead of one (because I think it'll look better and it only costs slightly more) and a second screen by going to a slightly cheaper version of the first screen (but with similar stats).

buildapcforme,3dv7ff,MrMorninWood,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:54:10 2015 UTC,What benefits does a six core have over a dual core?   Whats a thermal compound and what does it add that the previous build doesn't?
buildapcforme,3dv7ff,thatguyonfacebook,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:59:46 2015 UTC,more cores is better and allows you to run programs more easily.
buildapcforme,3dv7ff,MrMorninWood,0,Sun Jul 19 21:04:34 2015 UTC,"The 6 cores vs 2 cores allows the CPU to run 3x as many threads, however games won't take advantage of more than 4 threads, and the Pentium is on a very good upgrade path, so you can upgrade to a dual core i3 (Which is hyper threaded, which basically splits the core in half to make 4 threads though it just beats the 6 core for slightly more complicated reasons) or quad core i5 which are generally agreed to be the best for gaming.    Thermal paste is what connects the CPU and the CPU cooler, and allows the heat to transfer. The thermal paste comes with cpu cooler, however aftermarket thermal paste is generally better.

You know that a component's not going to be good when it costs the same as a party size Doritos bag.   In all seriousness though, that is by no means a 480W PSU. If you want to know how much power a PSU really delivers, check how many amps it has on the +12V rail. The 480W model has 16A of +12V, meaning it delivers a nice 192W max power.  Now, if you try to load it beyond this 192W max point (which even low end PCs will do, btw) it will immediately explode, like, literally EXPLODE. When this happens, 99% of times it will take your other components with it, fry your GPU, motherboard, CPU, RAM, literally anything in your PC that's wired up to it. Is that $20 savings over a better EVGA, Corsair, Coolermaster, etc. PSU looking so appealing now?   There is nothing wrong with Logisys as a brand, their cases are decent (once you detach the preinstalled PSU) and their higher end PSUs are OK. I'm still wary of them, though, because of all the stigma that's attached to their lower end units."

buildapcforme,3dxiu8,WordOfMadness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:41:23 2015 UTC,"There are a few ways you can build at $1000. The first is to go with an i3, then spend as much as you can on a graphics card. The other is to push for the i5 CPU, but have a slightly weaker GPU. One will give you better performance in the short term, the other will be a longer lasting platform for future GPU upgrades. The final option is to spend another $100ish and get the best of both worlds.   Here is a rough list I've laid out, it's with the i3 + 960 setup, but the similarly prices i5 + 270 combo is tagged on the end of the list as well. This build comes in a little under budget, at around $950 including shipping and all the rest, so spending a bit more to get both the i5 and 960 (or a 380 if you'd prefer) might actually be worth some consideration.   These decisions would also depend on your desire for the SSD. That's another $100 for a reasonable 120GB model, so you'd be sacrificing something to fit it in unless you stretch the budget a little. If you're mainly playing the lighter games you list, and just want a little boost in general system responsiveness and loading times, then it might be worth a look. But if you were also hoping to jump into more intensive games, then spending more on the parts that impact gaming performance might be a better choice."

If he really prefers one over the other you could also just take two of that particular one. I added a watercooler as well but I would seriously recommend a custom water cooling kit if you want your rig to look nice. I've added the 980ti in 3-way SLI but there's room for a fourth... You could also go for the FuryX, it really depends on the game and how optimized it is which one will work better. I've made it the inno3D one because I think it's the nicest but apparently it's not (yet) available in US so I just played around with the Euro price...

buildapcforme,3dx04c,Osmarov,3,Mon Jul 20 11:21:06 2015 UTC,A while back top of either/hardware or /buildapc 2way crossfire furyx was found to have a 15% improvement on sli 980ti. The difference increased even more with 3way. http://www.pcper.com/reviews/Graphics-Cards/AMD-Fury-X-vs-NVIDIA-GTX-980-Ti-2-and-3-Way-Multi-GPU-Performance the scaling difference between the 980ti and the fury x was repeatedly mentioned with the fury x having better scaling.

buildapcforme,3dx04c,Sundays_evening,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:53:33 2015 UTC,"Lol that's the same source that I used. It's true that the furyx scales better than the 980ti, but in general what I see from that article is that if the 980ti is better for a single card it will still be better for dual and vice-versa. Wouldn't necessarily recommend one over the other in total performance in that way. Scaling is way better, but performance is still depending on the game and how optimized it is."

It'd be better for you to wait until 29th of July and buy a copy of Win 10.  This rig is overclockable because it is cheaper to overclock after a few years than to buy a whole new platform(CPU+MOBO and probably RAM). Of course some will say that in this budget you should go for X99 platform but you wouldn't really notice the difference and in my opinion it would be just a waste of money.   I will try to explain what and why I proposed for this rig. CPU The i7-4790K is currently the best CPU for LGA1150 platform so it is an easy choice. Cooler This is one of the best CPU Coolers on the market. I have the Dark Rock Pro 2 version and I am very satisfied with it. MOBO This motherboard is not the most expensive you can get but it does the job well and there is no need to overpay. RAM 8GB should be enough you can add another 8GB later SSD 250GB for OS, programs and a few games. Samsung SSDs are considered the most reliable. HDD 1TB for games, music, photos and movies should be enough. You can always change for 2TB version. Video Card 980Ti is one of the best cards on the market. 6GB of VRAM will be enough for 3 monitors. EVGA version is slightly OC'd ;) Case Nothing fancy just simple black case. Silent and well made. PSU Fully modular made by Seasonic which is one of the best PSU manufacturers. Monitors 3 FullHD Benq monitors. If you need anything more just specify your needs :) Keyboard Really comfortable keyboard made by Logitech. Mouse I think right now it is the most popular one on the market. I personally use Razer DeathAdder(Black Edition) but Logitech is just more flexible. If you need any of those MMO mice I would recommend Logitech G600(this is based on what my friend's who play LoL and Dota use I don't play MMO games) Headphones Those headphones are better than most of the ""gaming series"" headsets from Logitech, Razer or Steelseries. But not as good as Sennheiser(or other audio gear manufaturer) headphones + good microphone combo.  EDIT Forgot about RAM :P"

And it seems like you don't know how to build the pc, so inet is just doing it for you(You can remove that if you want to build it yourself)  If you want to overclock in the future, you should add Cooler Master 212 EVO for a economic aftermarket cooler that lowers your temperature alot, or you can add a better cooler if your budget has the reach and you feel like you might want to OC alot in the future.  The i7 you need for streaming. 970 is just a great freaking card despite the ""3,5gb"" VRAM.  You could go for a more expensive GPU if you can afford it, but 970 is fine for 1080p gaming atm.  16gb RAM maybe isn't necessary, 8 might be enough but just to have the reach I would go with 16gb.  If you want a cd-reader, you could add that too, but nothing I care about.   If you want more than 1tb space, you can add 2-3TB HDD instead.  You could add windows if you want.   Since you are playing CS:GO, you would probably want to go for a mechanical keyboard, but it's up to you which one.  Personal preferences...

I know this isn't short but don't want to spread wrong information.   Anyway, to be honest I don't know the exact workings on a GPU buy what I do is just read a lot of benchmarks and check the  minimum and average fps of a lot of games. After that I kinda decide what's best and what's worse and etc.    Though I know that VRAM helps for things like more anti-aliasing and playing on higher resolutions like 2560x1440p or even 4K. The kind of VRAM is also important (GDDR5, DDR3 and the new HBM in the R9 Fury cards) where the best of them would be HBM, second and most common GDDR5 and something you should avoid that is found on lower-end GPU's is DDR3. Though DDR3 is good for normal RAM.   The clockspeeds of GPU's also is a factor in performance though that can be a bit conflicting as some have lower speeds but more VRAM and other factors influence performance too.   Best thing to do is just check benchmarks for the games you'd like to play and see what's the best in your price range. Good luck on it!"

Wasn't sure how much you wanted to spend on the monitor. For a mouse I personally have the Razer Naga 2014 which is very nice. Lots of buttons. For a keyboard I have the Cooler Master Rapid-I which is expensive (about £90) but is very good to use. For speakers I just have some logitech £50 5.1 speakers (2 desk ones and a floor bass). headphones, the plantronics gamecom 780 are nice but I'd advise going to a place where you can try some on.

buildapcforme,3dv06w,stapler8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:23:31 2015 UTC,"While I would like to advise that, I am not particularly well-versed in Microcenter deals, as I don't live anywhere near one. The most I could find was this and those don't seem to fit in this price range.  As for the PSU, the estimated power draw of the system with the R9 280 under normal load is around 400W. To ensure that the PSU can properly supply enough power if the system goes under heavy load or anything happens, I left some room. I have a 550W PSU with an R9 280 and an i5-4440 myself and am glad I had that size because it made me feel better about adding things like an SSD because I knew the PSU could still power everything."
buildapcforme,3dv06w,xANDREWx12x,2,Sun Jul 19 20:38:03 2015 UTC,"I think you need to learn about PSU rails.  An R9 280 system draws about 305W total.  A low-end EVGA PSU such as this one can provide 30A over the 12V rail. That's more than enough to power the entire system, and will be fine for an R9 280.  The 5V rail is next and needs to power the CPU. 18A over that rail is way more than enough, providing 90W of power.  The 3.3V rail is used for drives, fans, etc, and has 17A to be provided. Way more than enough for as many drives as you could want.  You can run a R9 290X off a decent 500W unit."

I imagine reliability is critical here. If this truly is for production use, I would expect purchasing it from a well known vendor (HP, Supermicro, etc.) but to each his own.  The only choice for primary components is a Xeon with a server-grade motherboard and ECC memory. 8GB of memory should be enough for 10-15 users logging on simultaneously but if you need more, you can add more. The board has four DIMMs total.   Moving on, there's the 120GB Intel enterprise-grade SSD for the operating system and software. To compliment that are two 2TB Constellation drives (Enterprise grade) for data storage which I suggest running in RAID1.  Arguably the most important thing is the power supply. The unit I picked out is using the highest quality Tier 1 components for maximum dependability.  The case is small and sleek but has very good airflow. The fan filters will keep it running clean and cool as long as you remember to regularly clean them out. Last, there's the simple and inexpensive GPU for your viewing (Xeon's don't have integrated graphics) and the DVD-ROM. Let me know if I'm missing anything."

I included Windows 7, a decent 1080p monitor (it is a bit on the small side, but I use a 21.5"" myself and it's not nearly as small as it's cracked up to be), and a good keyboard from a reputable brand.  The CPU cooler is more about temperatures than noise, but you can always toggle the fan speeds to make it quieter. With this cooler, I would actually recommend overclocking the CPU (to 4.2GHz or so) in order to avoid bottlenecking the video card, because it is a bit weak on single-core performance.   Same for the GPU cooler. It's more temps than noise but you can toggle the fan curve. Also the GPU comes pre-overclocked so you don't have to do that yourself.  I chose the case mainly because it has two fans preinstalled in a push-pull configuration which helps with cooling. It doesn't look too bad and it's reasonably small.   The PSU is a good one from a very reputable brand and provides enough wattage to sustain the build with headroom for overclocking.   I hope you like it!"

I spent a little extra for the 80+ Bronze to help your old folks' power bills.   Wireless KB with mouse. The build doesn't have Bluetooth capability and these were the only ones I could find that weren't ridiculously expensive.

If it's a somewhat significant difference I'll go with it. I'm willing to expand my budget a bit if necessary. But if the difference is negligible then I might was well go with the few hundred dollar cheaper option.  Edit: I can go beyond the budget I put if it makes a significant difference. I just need something that'll play games like GTA V in 4K. So if my budget is too low then I'd appreciate a recommendation of any price.

If you do want XFire/SLI the 260x is the only option between the two. I have no experience in Dual Setups but just make sure the PSU is capable of handling two cards & the rest of your system. I always recommend a stronger single GPU setup purely because issues can arise with games. But for a budget card the 260x is a great choice :)"

buildapcforme,3dt87e,chopdok,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:12:09 2015 UTC,"3 most important parts of the gaming rig is GPU, CPU and PSU. GPU is pretty straightforward - the better one you have, the higher you can push resolution, graphical fidelity and get better framerates. CPU is also very important - you need a CPU that is at least good enough to not bottleneck your GPU, also, unlike previous years, where CPU was not that important, where you could pair a low-end CPU with high-end GPU and get decent performance, can't really do it for the newer games. Those days are over, Witcher 3 for example is very CPU heavy, can take advantage of up to 8 cores, and in Novigrad area for example - no matter how you overclock your i5, even to 5 GHz - it will not be enough to get stable 60 fps. Only i7 quad-core can withstand Novigrad fish market and deliver 60 fps (if you have the GPU for it of course). So CPU is also important for gaming, starting from 2015. Ideally, you want both to be good, but GPU is still a bit more important. So, in a proper gaming rig, GPU is the most important and expensive part, CPU is 2nd most important, ideally no more than 2x cheaper than GPU.   PSU is also extremely important and commonly overlooked part. You don't want to cheap out on it too much, because it is all that stands between your PC and its death by power surge.

I know it won't be top of the line and it will be more expensive than doing all this, but it's easier for her and there's more assurance on her part. If something breaks in her Dell, she can bring it back and have them fix it. If something breaks in this, she's pretty much SOL. And anything from best buy will get her what she needs.

buildapcforme,3dt2jx,Abazors,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:46:59 2015 UTC,I saw an AMD processor with 8cores go for like 150 or 200. Anyone know about that? What's the difference between the amd 860k 3.7ghz and the Intel i5 4690k 3.5ghz?
buildapcforme,3dt2jx,theRealLegendM8,2,Sun Jul 19 06:03:33 2015 UTC,"The 860k is a budget/lower end CPU for gaming. The i5 4690k and lower i5s is the best performer for gaming at the around $190 price range. You can't really compare clock speeds between two different architectures/chips.  8 cores will do better in applications that use them such as streaming, video editting, etc. A strong quad core chip will do better in today's games.  Get a R9 390 as it is slightly better than the 970 but has more vram. You'll have to check PSU requirements, I'm on mobile and too lazy right now.   You can save about $70 by having the stock cooler and a non overclock able i5."
buildapcforme,3dt2jx,theRealLegendM8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:10:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, it definitely helps. I don't think I'm gonna overclock it anymore.   http://pcpartpicker.com/p/PRp9Hx Does this build seem good? I would like the two 4 gig RAM"
buildapcforme,3dt2jx,theRealLegendM8,2,Sun Jul 19 07:25:13 2015 UTC,"No problem. Honestly with a R9 390 or Gtx 970, you shouldn't have any problem hitting 60+fps on most games with a stock i5 and overclocking would mostly be an option down the road when it gets older.  Definitely consider the 390 tho, if you got the 970 at maybe $285 then I can see the value. But at $10 more, you're getting the same/better performance and over double the vram"
buildapcforme,3dt2jx,theRealLegendM8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:28:45 2015 UTC,Could I still get by on modern games with an msi gtx 960 instead of 970? Or an r380 instead of the 390?
buildapcforme,3dt2jx,theRealLegendM8,2,Sun Jul 19 07:59:19 2015 UTC,"Sure you can, you'll have to be playing them at medium/some high @ 60fps on graphically intensive games.

buildapcforme,3dsxt9,Abazors,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:27:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! A few questions though.   What exactly is overclocking? Is it just playing games that are to much for your PC? Why the choice of the GTX 970 instead of the R9 290X? I've seen some people saying the 970 is better or the 290 is better. Just curious on what the differences are :)
buildapcforme,3dsxt9,Abazors,2,Sun Jul 19 06:40:38 2015 UTC,"Overclocking is pretty much just setting your CPU or GPU to a higher clock speed than what you buy it with, so basically you are making it run faster and hotter to get more performance out of it. As for the 970 vs 290, both cards have very similar performance and pricing. I personally recommended the 970 because I own one and I absolutely love it."

The RAM, Mobo, and GPU are all blue and should go well with the white S340.

buildapcforme,3drsxd,theRealLegendM8,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:37:26 2015 UTC,"honestly, neither. getting an i7 over an i5 nets you nothing for a gaming pc, the only difference is hyperthreading, and games don't make use of that. and a higher clockspeed, but for 100$ that would net you maybe 3fps more.   You already have a gtx970 in this budget and 100$ more isn't enough to get a gtx980, so you would be paying 33% more for a slightly improved version of the same card.  I would go for a bigger SSD or just keep the money and use it for a new keyboard or mouse or just buy some new games."
buildapcforme,3drsxd,theRealLegendM8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:34:52 2015 UTC,"Games do make use of hyperthreading, look at battlefield 4 for example.   But you are correct, for gaming there is more or less a negligible difference."

There's also a gtx 760 for $142 right now which I think is a great card for the money. If you don't mind buying refurbished gpushack.com sells a 7950 boost (same as r9 280) for $120. Here's a replacement kit for the ram.
