Indiemakeupandmore,3e3m07,ilovecats1305,7,Tue Jul 21 18:20:50 2015 UTC,"I think that everyone should own Tiny Manticore. It's a gorgeous neutral brown eyeshadow with a very subtle blue shift. Great for all occasions. Another great one is Choose Wisely  - champagne gold with a green shift. Perspecto-Illusion is my favorite eyeshadow ever, so check that out too.  EDIT: Silver Apple is also totally amazing and beautiful - more cool toned than Candied Apple though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e3m07,sillybits,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:37 2015 UTC,Another vote for Perspecto Illusion! You can't go wrong with that one.
Indiemakeupandmore,3e3m07,SirWaffalot,3,Tue Jul 21 18:59:13 2015 UTC,"I love Candied Apple it's awesome! (:   I don't have much experience with them, but two of my favorites (besides Candied Apple) are Impsy a burgundy purplish color with a lot of gold glitter and Elitist a gold color but it has some bronze in it and it is really quite nice for work/school. (I guess I really like gold colors.)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e3m07,smiletorismile,3,Tue Jul 21 18:48:10 2015 UTC,It depends on you skin tone and what colours you like. A few favourites of mine are:   The Wayward Prince Time Lost Kitten Mittens   I have medium light skin with warm undertones.  FYI FF makes really nice blushes as well and they have an eye primer (though I haven't tried it myself).
Indiemakeupandmore,3e3m07,i_am_a_cyborg,2,Tue Jul 21 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"Tiny Manticore and Cosmic Owl are some of my favorites of theirs, and they also have some really gorgeous highlighting colors, like Perspecto-Illusion."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e3m07,normalcypolice,2,Tue Jul 21 19:25:51 2015 UTC,"My two favorites from FF are The Masquerade, which is a purplish grey with pink duochrome , and Alpine Skies, which is a pale taupe with a really strong turquoise duochrome. So I would suggest those if you have any interest! They're both super beautiful."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e3m07,miraclesystem,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:46 2015 UTC,"I think Secret Shiny is a really unique color, and a lighter duochrome, which I think is a bit hard to find.  I really like it because I think my collection is a bit sparse on lighter colors, so it provides good variety for me."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,herownhero,9,Tue Jul 21 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"Oh shit I just tried Fluffy Green Tea yesterday (had previously swatched but wore it all day yest) and it is AMAZING. I can still smell it on the shirt I wore yesterday. It's gorgeous real green tea (manuka tea, not matcha, and NOT like spa/bamboo/candle green tea either), mixed with the softest but somehow most potent marshmallow EVER. Fades to a gorgeous marshmallow that lasts all day. I now need EVERYTHING of theirs that has marshmallow in it.  Creamsicle smells like an orange creamsicle, duh.  Boo Boo Lemon Noel is a great foodie creamy lemon that's potent- I have both this and SS Chiffon and while I love the delicate nature of Chiffon, BBLN is way more potent and long-lasting.  Cinderella's Carriage is a really cool pumpkin cream/coconut cream pie scent. I have it in the body butter but I know lots of people who love it in other forms too!  Paper Butterfly is a mainly white amber and osmanthus blend, but the osmanthus ends up smelling like a mix of light florals and peaches, so it's lightly fruity and gorgeous.  There's one called Hawaiian Cake that people rave about, but I have not personally tried. It's pineapple, coconut, and cake.  I did NOT love any of the ice cream scents, Sugar Cookie, or Waffle Cookies. They were a bit plasticky or bland on me."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,lgbtqbbq,2,Tue Jul 21 16:26:42 2015 UTC,Are the marshmallow notes similar to Solstice Scent's?  I have been in love with their marshmallow note and am on the lookout for similar scents!
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,Aiota,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"Hmmm...I would say they are not quite identical, but I LOVE them both. SS is my favorite company (tied with Nocturne Alchemy) and Rose Mallow Cream, Nightgown, and Smoky Mountain Mallow are all favorites of mine. The Cocoa Pink note is intoxicating and fluffy in a similar way, but unique. I adore them both and if you like one I bet you'll enjoy the other!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,lgbtqbbq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:33 2015 UTC,Oh man Cocoa Pink has just moved way up my list!  Thank you! :)  I got to try all of the marshmallow/cream scents!
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,Aiota,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:13 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of trying their coco mango butter (I love the formula of this!) in Marshmallow Fireside, which I'm hoping actually smells like Bath and Body Works candle version. Have you tried it? I was thinking of Hawaiian Cake, but I already ordered Pool Party from Sixteen92, so I think I'm covered on the tropical cake front. The Fluffy Green Tea sounds wonderful too!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,LiberVix,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:48 2015 UTC,"Haven't tried Marshmallow Fireside, but I've heard great things about it. Like I said, I didn't realize how magical their marshmallow note was but I would absolutely blind buy anything with marshmallow from them now...  I think Hawaiian Cake sounds identical to Pool Party, so I'm with ya there. I'm so glad I wore FGT yesterday- the weather was hot and muggy and somehow it was the perfect fresh but sweet gourmand!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,lgbtqbbq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:30 2015 UTC,"I will definitely put FGT on my next order to sample- I'm loving Seaside Picnic which also has that light, fresh gourmand thing going on, so it sounds like it might be up my alley."

Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,PhyrraNyx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:06 2015 UTC,Naughty Pumpkins and Cinderella's Carriage are both so good!
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,elephantabate,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:34 2015 UTC,They smell sooo delicious.
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,PhyrraNyx,2,Tue Jul 21 18:55:30 2015 UTC,"I love what I've tried from them so far. I got Something Wicked, Berry Iced Tea, Lime Agave Stiletto, and Green Fairy :)  I really have to recommend Lime Agave Stiletto. It's like a margarita topped with cotton candy, so yummy. Green Fairy is a very cool scent, with a lot of green tea notes. Berry Iced Tea and Something Wicked are very nice fruity perfumes, i don't think they're incredible or anything."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,Zannahquinn,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:41 2015 UTC,"I really like Kailua Beach (Bask in the dreamy tropical notes of Hawaiian White Ginger, azure tinged ocean water, ice cold coconut milk with a delicate touch of Oahu red pulmeria blooms). In fact, I'm planning to order more items with that scent.  I also enjoy Lost Coast (The breathtaking location where majestic misty mountain ranges meet the emerald waters of the Pacific Ocean. Japanese golden pear juice, red ginseng root, dew covered lily of the valley, pristine edelweiss mountain flowers, ozone, salty ocean air, sun bleached driftwood and newly clipped peppermint leaf).  I wasn't as crazy about Tokyo Market (it doesn't smell bad, but it's overly sweet for me), and Strawberry Basil Margarita was a bit artificial to me. That's not to say I hate them, but there are definitely other scents I prefer. You say you like vanilla foody scents, so it's quite likely you might enjoy them! I tend to prefer scents that you find in nature or atmospheric scents."

I haven't been able to find comparisons of MHCakes and MHCookies...and for some reason I have an anxiety that I'll buy one when the other is better, just because they seem so damn similar. And it doesn't seem right to buy both. I LOVE foodie almond scents."

Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,SUBARU17,2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:20 2015 UTC,"I really like The Un-Red. Buckets of bloody orange juice, sweet vanilla, bourbon vanilla, sandalwoods and ambers.  It's sort of a sexy creamsicle scent, and it needs more love.    I also really like the ""Black"" blends, like Black Marshmallow, Black Noel (mixed with a BBW Vanilla Bean Noel dupe), and their BBW dupe of Marshmallow Fireside. Black is two types of rich amber resins and a little something more and to my nose, does not play well solo. It's really harsh unless it is mixed with other things, but mixed with anything soft or creamy, it's divine.   ETA: I've had great luck with their EdPs; I get them in ""Smell Me Across Town"" strength, and a little dab will do ya. I also really like the conditioners, with my favorite being the argan (fine, thick, oily hair)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,elephantabate,2,Tue Jul 21 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, Black Marshmallow smells great :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,SirWaffalot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"Are you planning to buy their bath products? If you are, I found that a lot of times, the more subtle notes get lost so you can expect a more ""simple"" sort of scent. I've only tried 11 scents from them and out of the ones I tried, I think you'd like Cake on Mondays (delicious cinnamon cream). It contains cinnamon though, and some people find that they're allergic to it.   Here are quick reviews of the other scents I tried in case you're interested:   White Sugar - This one has that searing artificial sugar scent in it, but the most prominent scent is this delicious strawberry shortcake sort of scent. Country Kitchen - I don't know what happens but this smells really clay-like. You know that clay-like smell of plain oatmeal that doesn't have sugar/syrup/cream/cinnamon added to it? Just plain oats. Not the creamy oats of your imagination but actual oats? Yup. Smells like that. Winter Breakfast - Just chocolate. A rich, milk chocolate instead of those cheap, artificial chocolate powder, but still just chocolate. Can't smell anything other than rich, milk chocolate. Haunted Carnival - This just turns into that overly sweet, burnt caramel popcorn sort of scent. The burnt caramel bit is a bit piercing to me, but one of my friends think it smells great. Apple Popcorn Balls – This is just apple. It's plain artificial green apples. Vanilla on the Rocks - It smells like plain vanilla, only there's a strong waxy smell to it. I'm guessing the waxy smell is the smell of the unscented Soulmate Hair Rescue Treatment though. Just Breathe - There's that cotton-ish smell I associate with baby rooms, only there's florals in this, making it smell like a baby's room after someone just placed a fresh bouquet of flowers inside. Tahitian Monoi Cake - The scent makes my brain confused...it's a floral yellow cake scent, and I'm not sure if I want to eat it or decorate my house with it.  Footprints In The Sand - I got this in linen spray version and it changes a LOT.  In the beginning, it was like gumdrops and liquorice (that tends to smell a bit medicinal to me), with the slightest hint of lemons. After 3 months, I got the coconuts and it smells more like a coconut-lime cocktail. After 6+ months, the lime part got stronger, so now it smells like a beachside lime spritzy cocktail, with some coconut in it.  Violet Mallow – powdery violet ""conditioner"" type of scent. I actually like it, but kind of makes me think of a conditioner salons popular with older women would use.    I'm still procrastinating on writing my review, but if you want quick reviews of any products, let me know. I'll do a quick review if I've tried it :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,eraser_dust,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:05 2015 UTC,Agreed- My first Cocoa Pink order was haircare products and all the scents I chose veered into plasticky territory. Whereas the majority of the scents in the alcohol-based perfumes were lovely.
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,lgbtqbbq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:13 2015 UTC,"I just recently got my first order from them and did a big First Impressions review HERE. From the scents I've tried, the bath and body products do become a little one note and simplistic, but the perfumes were more complex than I expected, a welcome surprise.   I am really loving Seaside Picnic right now- it's light, sweet, airy, and has a really realistic cotton candy note. My other favorites from my order were Wildwood Boardwalk, which has an interesting combo of yeasty pretzel notes, sweetness, and hints of florals, and A Day at the Beach, which is mostly tanning oil and coconut, but very fun and summery. I'm plotting another order soon!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,LiberVix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:35 2015 UTC,"To be honest, their perfumes last about as long as a sneeze on my skin, but I've repeatedly bought Black Kittens (& Black Kittens In The Pumpkin Patch) in hair products because it's wonderful."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,sihaya09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"Here are my favorites. Based on your likes, you might enjoy them too.   Black Marshmallow: You love sweet things like sugar cubes and white lace. But sometimes you need to be a little naughty. Try this new “foody sexy” blend of sweet marshmallow fluff and rich ambers for a dessert you won’t forget.   I get marshmallow and amber. It's a good scent for night, I think. I wasn't too impressed by the CP marshmallow note on its own (though it still is nice!), but this blend is great.    Cœur de Vahiné (dupe): soft and feminine, complex yet not overbearing.  Notes of bergamot, orange, peach and passion fruit; with middle notes of cinnamon, rose, jasmine, Tahitian Opuhi petals; ending on dry notes of sandalwood, vanilla pods and musk. This is a wonderful general purpose scent.   This is a soft, velvety, fruity, sandalwood-y scent to me. I like sweet scents, but they can be kind of overwhelming in the summer; however, this one isn't. I've been wearing it a lot lately. It kind of reminds me of the Hanae Mori Butterfly sample I used to have.    Spiritueuse Double Vanilla (dupe): Made just for CocoaPink by our perfumer! Beware of imitations, we have the original! Based on Guerlain’s famous vanilla. This duplication is high quality and made with notes of pure vanilla, real benzoin extract, frankincense, spices, cedar, pink pepper, bergamot, and ylang-ylang.   I get vanilla with pink pepper. While some CocoaPink blends can smell candy-ish, this one smells more sophisticated. It's definitely more of a cold weather scent, I think."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e33wn,badluckbelle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:31 2015 UTC,I loved Frosted Eyelet (very edible vanilla!) and Black Kittens (musky vanilla with some soft citrus lemony goodness).
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2mr8,makaronn,4,Tue Jul 21 14:08:28 2015 UTC,"This is a stock scent, but I'm a huge fan of Brambleberry's Lychee & Red Tea. All you have to do is mix it at a 1 part stock scent to 2 parts carrier oil (fractionated coconut, jojoba, etc), and you have your perfume oil. It's super cheap at $6.98 for 2oz!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2mr8,eraser_dust,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:26 2015 UTC,I have some good reading for you: https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/3926xn/custom_perfumes_from_haus_of_gloi_epically_epic/? :D Hope it helps!
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2mr8,12oo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:06 2015 UTC,"I actually read that before making my post, but thank you anyways! I was hoping to maybe get a custom like she did but I'm not sure what other notes I'd pair with lychee since I want a straight up lychee perfume."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2mr8,lgbtqbbq,13,Tue Jul 21 14:50:19 2015 UTC,"Hello! I saw this thread this morning but was on my way to work so I hadn't commented yet. Then /u/12oo mentioned me and I was summoned.  So the problem with lychee is it's VERY much a top note. It's fleeting on its own and pretty rare as a standalone. I had a lot of issues finding even mainstream perfumes that used predominantly lychee. That's why both customs I made were a mix of fruits, because I know from experience that a single note fruit will fade extra fast.  I would say the pear and mangosteen were successful to varying degrees. The pear supplemented the rich opaque creaminess that I associate with lychee (which to me is very much a sweet creamy fruit, not a sour or watery one). But the mangosteen really helped to bring that South East Asian/humid tropical fruit scent in.   I will say I don't think either would have been successful alone, but you can always try the custom option from Epically Epic without the mangosteen.   The reason I used notes like cream, tonka, and musk is purely for longevity. I stressed to both perfume houses that I wasn't interested in a perfumey blend, I wanted straight lychee. But you can't capture straight 1 thing by using only that 1 thing. You have to try to guess other notes that will bring characteristic/typical nuance to the note you are interested in, without interrupting the flow and making your nose go, ""Huh?? What's that?"" That's why I didn't use vanilla, because it's far too standout for my nose. Tonka and cream, along with a gentle musk, were more light, airy, and neutral in smell. If I just ordered a lychee + nothing else fragrance, then it's almost certain it would smell ""thin"" and weak, and probably not last too long!  Like you I am perturbed that most lychee options are blends of teas or other food + lychee. Lychee + red tea is NOT the same as just lychee, dammit!! But for me, these custom blends were the truest to what I wanted without sacrificing practical features, like throw and longevity. Good luck!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3e2mr8,12oo,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm hmmm you might be able to ask a perfumer directly if they have any recommendations as well, since they are more familiar with how their own notes and accords work than others. That is always an option I'd consider if you can't figure out an existing blend to buy!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2mr8,12oo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:11 2015 UTC,"Oohhh that sounds like a good idea! Do you have any stores that you'd recommend for custom perfumes?

Indiemakeupandmore,3e1v5f,eraser_dust,3,Tue Jul 21 08:54:32 2015 UTC,"Oof, for my case, it's:    Cotton Candy. (This can either turn into baby doll plastic, or a nose-burning 'pink' scent which vaguely smells like sugar burning under a hot sun. The only time I ever get lucky is if it's a perfume that imitates cotton candy frosting!).  +Chocolate (Believe it or not, I sometimes get plasticky/vinegar scents from chocolate notes. As a rule, I never blind-buy chocolate-scented fragrances!).  +Pine (Can either go as lovely, refreshing pine--or extremely bitter, medicinal stuff that clogs up my nose!)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e1v5f,MageLocusta,3,Tue Jul 21 12:16:32 2015 UTC,"Vanilla: becomes ""darker"" Chocolate: becomes ""darker"", slightly smoky, and/or sour Coffee: becomes more bitter and sour Leather: becomes floral. (I don't know how the heck this happens) Honey: becomes less gourmand wine: amps up and sweetens   That's it I think. XD Everything else stays more or less the same on me."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e1v5f,bekobekodesu,3,Tue Jul 21 12:51:02 2015 UTC,So I changed birth control a while back and my skin chemistry went nuts. My HG perfume HoG Komodo changed from smelling like grown up candy to potpourri on me. Things are starting to settle down so in going to go through my collection again and then destash soon.   I'm not really sure what my skin's doing now but it used to turn ambers powdery and leather to plastic.

Indiemakeupandmore,3e1v5f,lgbtqbbq,3,Tue Jul 21 18:15:09 2015 UTC,"Notes that often work really well on me that can also BETRAY me. In parentheses I'll note which perfumes have been awesome for me and which have been not great. When I say love I mean my skin does well with it, and hate means my skin fucks it up. Don't mean to be rude, I don't ""hate"" any of my perfumes really :)   Honey- can turn ""powdery"" or plasticky (my skin loves SS Smokewood Apiary, and hates Smelly Yeti Not the Bees) Cream/Milk- can turn sour (loove HoG ""Sweet Cream"" note, hate Possets Cream) Vanilla- can go plasticky or cloying (love most vanillas, including all SS EXCEPT Cenobite) Coffee- can turn plasticky and too ""neutral""/totally disappears (love HoG's coffee note in customs, hate SS Cafe Mallowmel, NA Egyptian Caramel Coffee, and OHWTO Barista! I got the worst luck with coffee, man.) Violet- can turn too much like old-fashioned makeup/face powder (love OHWTO Aravine, mixed with fruits and darker florals, hate in SS Violet Mallow, too sharp and powdered) Lavender- can disappear or become too simple (love NA Pharaonic Nocturnal, hate almost all Possets lavenders) Patchouli- can be delightfully minty and earthy, can also turn too ""musty""/dusty (love in Alchemic Muse Razzouli and SS Jack & The Devil, hate in NA Hessonite & most others!)"

Cherry: Almonds or cough syrup   Violet: can go too powdery and overwhelming  Strawberry: sweet, fresh jam or bitter funk (looking at you, HoG's Ruth)  Currants: Pretty much always cat pee"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dzjhd,CorvusCorset,13,Mon Jul 20 20:18:37 2015 UTC,"Today I'm trying out ""Queen of the Damned"" from Smelly Yeti, so I thought I'd do an eye look to go with the perfume =) This perfume is inspired by Drusilla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and is described as ""flowers in a graveyard.""     Corvus Cosmetics Mademoiselle: base shadow Corvus Cosmetics Cherie: transition color My Pretty Zombie Epistaxis: crease color My Pretty Zombie Fresh Scab: darken the crease Corvus Cosmetics Atargatis: main lid color Corvus Cosmetics Thessalonike: add dimension to the lid Wet n' Wild Fergie primer NYX eye shadow base in black L'Oreal Voluminous Carbon Black Blinc Amplified mascara NYX Micro Brow Pencil in Black ABH Brow Powder Duo in Granite Dreamworld Hermetica foundation in Arianrhod II Cloud Bite Agave lip mask in Champagne   My flower of choice was the rose, and I wanted to bring in the graveyard theme by using silver/grey to represent headstones and statues. Atargatis was especially perfect for this because it has green sparkles to contrast with the red and incorporate grass into the look. Thessalonike is a nice dirt gray, and Mademoiselle and Cherie are both from Corvus' ""The Roses"" collection. Since Dru is a vampire, I thought it fitting that the reds are both inspired by blood (Epistaxis means nosebleed).    Do you like daisies? I plant them, but they always die. Everything I put in the ground withers and dies."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzjhd,_roodrallec_,2,Mon Jul 20 20:19:15 2015 UTC,I love everything about this. Well done!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzjhd,aumerle,5,Mon Jul 20 20:36:21 2015 UTC,"I love this look! I never would have thought to put the red in the crease, it looks super wearable. Also I love Drusilla so everything about this is perfect."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzjhd,dictura,4,Mon Jul 20 20:46:33 2015 UTC,I love Drusilla and I love this inspired look! I would have never thought to pair a grey with green sparkle with reds but it is really lovely.

How did you find the formulas for Dark Matter Makeup? I know when I initially heard about the brand, there was some patchiness, but she recently reformulated AFAIK..?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e0b7b,pondicus,2,Tue Jul 21 01:56:17 2015 UTC,"In my swatches you can see that galileo applied really patchy over the normal primer. Aside from that one I seriously love the products I got from dark matter. My boyfriend helped me get these swatch photos with a real proper camera and I'm still figuring it all out and didn't quite capture some of the shifts, but the colours apply and look awesome in person. I'm also really digging her primer, and I showed the matte colours over it to show that her claim on the site about it working well for all finishes is true."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e0b7b,pondicus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:11 2015 UTC,"That's really great to hear! I've always had my eyes on DMM eyeshadows, because the shifts and shade selection seem really beautiful. It sounds like Dom took on the initial feedback and made her stuff better all round :)  Yay for new camera!!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e0b7b,bambikai,2,Tue Jul 21 02:03:58 2015 UTC,"loving those Dark Matter shades! and some of those HW ones too....   Is the Darling glitter glue better/less sticky/less of a pain in the ass than PE? I used to love PE but I've got off of it lately and I'm looking for a good alternative, any suggestions would be awesome!   also thanks for all the swatches :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e0b7b,bambikai,2,Tue Jul 21 10:26:53 2015 UTC,"I prefer PE over GG for using on my eyes, but I find both a pain in the butt and I used GG for these swatches since I'm trying to use it up before it goes bad. I find PE less gooey/wet so it's easier for me to use. I've actually been using the primer from dark matter makeup, it's really good at showing shifts/effects while still being easy to work with. It also has the bonus effect of playing well with mattes so you can blend easily over it. It's not very wet so I apply it, blend it out and put colour right on without having to wait for the texture to change."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e0b7b,pomicosmetics,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:10:49 2015 UTC,that sounds awesome and exactly like what I need/looking for! thanks :)

Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,SirWaffalot,7,Mon Jul 20 21:34:58 2015 UTC,Lip swatches are up on the website now.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,gorgossia,7,Mon Jul 20 23:50:16 2015 UTC,Is it just me or do some of the arm swatches look super patchy/streaky?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,SPACECATSTHEMEWSICAL,6,Tue Jul 21 01:23:31 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it's b/c she was trying to get a large swath of skin? Still, it does make me hesitant to hop on them w/o reviews. The lip swatches look pretty good though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,Pookabbit,10,Tue Jul 21 02:21:00 2015 UTC,I'm betting it is. If I try to swatch a huge bunch of skin like that with any of my liquid lipsticks they'll get streaky like that. Even my insanely pigmented Celebrity Skin does it. It's super difficult to maintain even opacity when you spread out the amount on the wand over such a big area. Things thin out and it inevitably gets a little patchy.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,luminous_delusions,4,Tue Jul 21 02:50:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I was thinking. I hope she offers sample sizes, but I'm not sure how the formula would hold up in an eppendorf tube with constant exposure to air."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,SPACECATSTHEMEWSICAL,4,Tue Jul 21 02:31:18 2015 UTC,They do...
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,Crystalzi,5,Tue Jul 21 02:05:26 2015 UTC,"Looking at the swatches, do you guys think Infinity resembles the Catalyst lip theory? I love that colour but I'd prefer it in a matte liquid formula...  EDIT:  They're only $8.50!!! So much for indecision."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,paisleypunk,4,Tue Jul 21 03:21:42 2015 UTC,looks like similar colours to the cosmos lipsticks
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,zebratwat,6,Mon Jul 20 21:32:11 2015 UTC,They do. I wonder if she's planning to expand later but started off with these colours due to their popularity in the lipstick form.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,starward-,3,Mon Jul 20 21:57:57 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think I see Supernova in infinity and maybe DNE is close to one of the reds but other than that I don't see much of a match"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,BreeAZ,4,Tue Jul 21 01:56:24 2015 UTC,now that swatches are up they definitely don't look the same. I was just going by the photo of the tubes.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,zebratwat,3,Tue Jul 21 02:02:20 2015 UTC,"I feel ya, I'm digging that blupley one."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,BreeAZ,2,Tue Jul 21 02:06:45 2015 UTC,Yeah looking at the lip swatches they don't look much alike.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,starward-,4,Tue Jul 21 04:48:11 2015 UTC,I know it might be silly but I really like that these have caps that are flush with the tube. I feel like some of the ones where the cap isn't flush doesn't look as nice. I'm hoping that I like these as much as I liked the Cosmos lipsticks!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,mightymai,4,Mon Jul 20 23:17:08 2015 UTC,"I want 3/5 of them, but I feel like I should buy one first just to test the formula to see if I like it and I don't know which one to choooooooooooooooose :("

Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,electricbetsy,4,Mon Jul 20 21:53:21 2015 UTC,She's in NY.  The only reason why I remember this is because I was so excited to find a shop in my own state and because it would get to me in like two days.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,radiant_eclipse,2,Mon Jul 20 22:13:32 2015 UTC,if it's NY that makes me happy! I think that'd be like... 9 my time?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,NorthwestTreeOctopus,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:26 2015 UTC,"If you are in PST, then yes! EST to PST is a 3 hour difference."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,FelidarSovereign,2,Mon Jul 20 23:36:21 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah!  She lives in my borough, so I could technically go to her studio and pick it up before USPS can even attempt to mess things up."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,infamousjoe,2,Tue Jul 21 01:27:06 2015 UTC,"Haha I'm a little farther but I could definitely do the same.  Though, that would be pretty awesome if you could go pick them up.  I think femme fatale does that with everything they sell."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,infamousjoe,3,Tue Jul 21 02:20:30 2015 UTC,"Welp, I ordered the Infinity one. The others are just too dark for me right now and I've been on the hunt for more work-friendly colors. I don't really have many mattes, so I hope this works out well.  I also ordered a mini contour stick and the brow theory in light brown, since I've been waiting for the sale to get those! And now to wait. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,singinginthecar,3,Tue Jul 21 04:46:52 2015 UTC,How long does the sale last for?

Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,Crystalzi,2,Mon Jul 20 21:45:27 2015 UTC,Hmmm I am preparing my wallet...but these do look quite warm toned. I wonder if a few have a cool edge to them? Either way I'm gonna be on it (I've been looking for a reason to buy LE) but it'll depend in the tones. Kudos for this new collection though!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,katycups,2,Mon Jul 20 21:52:57 2015 UTC,Anyone know how much it is?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,SpinelessLaugh,2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:04 2015 UTC,I feel so dumb you guys. I just placed an order and in my excitement it didn't occur to me to check their FB for a discount code (it's BDAY btw). Should I ask if it can still be applied or just go ahead and place a second order and request for the first one to be cancelled? I'm way too trigger happy when it comes to lipstick D:
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,unthriftyloveliness,2,Tue Jul 21 04:24:04 2015 UTC,Email her and see if she'll apply it for you. It can't hurt to ask.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzs03,FelidarSovereign,2,Tue Jul 21 04:25:49 2015 UTC,"Yup, just did. Hopefully it doesn't pose more trouble than if I were to just re-do it."

I was going to destash it for the longest time, but today I randomly put it on and IT'S AMAZING.  I don't even think it smells that different from when I first tried it, but for some reason now I absolutely love the scent and I have no idea what I was thinking when I decided to destash it.  It makes me want to hold on to the other perfumes that I'm not crazy about right now to see if I change my mind later!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e1ric,lgbtqbbq,4,Tue Jul 21 12:31:33 2015 UTC,I loooove Blackberry Buckle. You are so right about hanging onto perfumes. I have had several experiences where I pull out old bottles to organize into a swap pile and end up keeping them :D  I haven't tried this yet but I assume Blackberry Buckle will also work well layered with rich vanillas. Sort of like putting a scoop of ice cream on a plate of pie!
Indiemakeupandmore,3e1ric,seagullofhealing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:03 2015 UTC,Hnnnngggg one can never go wrong with ice cream!  Can you recommend some of your favorite vanillas?  The more easily obtainable the better - I've been wanting to get my hands on NAVA's Crystalline to no luck.
Indiemakeupandmore,3e1ric,lgbtqbbq,3,Tue Jul 21 17:06:21 2015 UTC,"NAVA Moonstone and Pyramid Vanille are both amazing, and still available I believe!! If I had to pick one, I'd pick PV because it's stronger and more layerable. Moonstone is sooo gorgeous alone but a little wispy/ethereal so it gets lost when paired with stronger scents. PV also needs to rest for a few weeks. It's a combo of like 10 different vanillas, so it smelled ""jumbled"" to my nose at first. Nice but disorganized/overwhelming. I couldn't believe how much I loved it after it chilled in my drawer for a month, though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e1ric,Linxi015,6,Tue Jul 21 17:09:15 2015 UTC,It's funny you say that because I got it about two months ago and was like Holy Blackberry. I'll have to get it out again and sniff it. Maybe layering it with Arcana's Yellow Cake would mellow it.
Indiemakeupandmore,3e1ric,smushmallow,7,Tue Jul 21 21:33:31 2015 UTC,"I'm trying out Solstice Scents Russian Caravan today. It's fruity smoked tea and leather, and it smells like I imagine the office in A Young Doctor's Notebook would smell--smokey and sweetly medicinal. I don't like it much, but I can't stop sniffing myself. It reminds me of something, but I can't place what it is because I keep picturing John Hamm and Daniel Radcliffe."

Maybe it's anosmia or skin chemistry but this one sits really close to my skin, so I'm adding a bit to my hair to see if it lasts longer. Dont vanish on me, please!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e1b98,firephly,8,Tue Jul 21 04:51:57 2015 UTC,"Oh! I got a couple!   First and foremost, I adore Posset's Sex in Heaven. It's a very realistic coconut scent which goes from thick and creamy to dry and fluffy with fine granules of sandalwood warming it right up. It's a very clean sandalwood/coconut scent and it's great to use if you're constantly stuck commuting in the sweaty and non-ventilated subway system.   There's also Cocoa Pink--I haven't had it as a perfume oil, but I got a sample of their sugar scrub in Banana Coconut Cloud Pie. It's EXACTLY like my family's vintage banana-cream pie recipe (icebox style!). It's a very cooling, sweet scent that smells like thick coconut cream, coconut flakes, and custardy banana cream with soggy vanilla cookie notes. I recently received it and I can't stop huffing my tiny sample jar! It's a shame because I purchased 6 vials of their variety of cotton candy/spun sugar scents, and none of them turned out well--but their coconut/banana scents are on par! It's a great surprise because in the past, I usually get banana scent notes which turn thick and plasticky on me. But Cocoa Pink is such a success on my skin chemistry, and as a sugar scrub, it stays sweet and refreshing (and the coconut was also the star in the fragrance).   I've only recently realized my love for strong coconut smells, but I hear that Arcana and NAVA make decent coconut scents (like Nocturne Alchemy's Coconut Santalum, and Coconut Cockatoo). I think this blog called More Tea, Wesley also reviewed one of Arcana's coconut-scents (well, coconut...and a whole lot of nice-sounding notes along with it) called Namaka (Coconut, vanilla bean, rice milk, golden amber, watermelon, banana leaf, aged patchouli, and lemongrass). And eraserdust (in her blog Working with Monolids) did a review on a Cupid the Archer fragrance which has coconut. So hopefully this info is helpful!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3e2lta,RoseGoldStreak,7,Tue Jul 21 14:00:37 2015 UTC,It just has a learning curve i think. I dont find using loose shadows takes any longer than pressed either.
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2lta,zebratwat,3,Tue Jul 21 14:03:24 2015 UTC,I definitely agree that it is a learning curve. As well as taking into account your general clumsiness (if you have any). Pressed has less chance to spill but if that is not an issue for you I could see why loose could be just as speedy :).
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2lta,karasunflower,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:16 2015 UTC,"I definitely had to factor in my natural clumsiness at first but didn't find it hard to get used to using loose eyeshadows, and now they don't take any more time than pressed!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2lta,sea-weed,7,Tue Jul 21 16:43:17 2015 UTC,"I think the ""harder"" comes from the increased chance for fallout and (sometimes) the need for a sticky base:)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2lta,electricbetsy,5,Tue Jul 21 14:03:45 2015 UTC,"Personally, I have way more experience with loose shadows than pressed. Both take me about the same amount of time nowadays. You do need a stickier base, especially with the duochromes that take a bit more work to get them to stand out. I don't see more fallout than some of my pressed ones (Looking at you, UD Ammo glitter), but that may be because of how I use them both. Lots of tapping off the excess.  And honestly, you don't need 6 shadows to be doing it right either. I often use just one or two. One especially for my more duochrome colors or the lazy days. I don't think I've ever used more than 4 colors on a look. More doesn't always mean better. Sometimes all you need is one really cool looking duochrome to make a complete shadow look."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2lta,ivyday,4,Tue Jul 21 16:40:52 2015 UTC,Duochromes are brilliant for quick one shade looks!
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2lta,sea-weed,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"I think more complications can come up, ie overloading your brush, fallout, baggies, etc. I started out using loose and just recently ran a brush over a cheap drugstore pressed shadow, and a lightbulb went off in my head as to why people prefer pressed. You're probably doing things very right!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2lta,birbvice,2,Tue Jul 21 14:18:10 2015 UTC,"I've been using loose for so long, I forget that it can be hard for people to transition from pressed to loose. I <3 loose shadows."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2lta,whereismydragon,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"I struggled at first because it was so different from pressed, but now, I find it way easier!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2lta,krysiefishie,2,Tue Jul 21 14:59:46 2015 UTC,"Like other people have said, I think there is just a learning curve.  I struggled a bit with loose when I first started using it, not because it was any harder, but just because it was new.  When you think about it, since most mainstream brands only do pressed (or did when I was growing up), most of us learn on pressed shadows.  There's definitely a learning curve there, but it is somewhat masked by the fact that we are also just learning make up in general.  We expect to have to practice before we start getting the right looks.  When we switch to loose, we don't expect the learning curve again, so it is more frustrating.  We expect to have the same skills with loose as we do with years of practice on pressed right away.  Naturally, this isn't the case and it takes us longer at first.  You can't really expect to have the same results immediately with something new as you do with something you have lots of practice on.     Once we get the practice in, however, I don't think either medium is inherently easier or harder to use than the other."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2lta,surly_elk,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with previous comments, about the learning curve. For me, it's especially interesting because I wasn't into more complex eyeshadow before I got started with indies so my learning has involved loose shadows from the get go. I'll be honest, I don't notice a significant amount of difference between how I apply loose vs pressed but I'm not doing eyeshadow every day."
Indiemakeupandmore,3e2lta,mallowleaves,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:44 2015 UTC,I find in general I like loose shadow better because it's easier to apply and the colors are my bold/vibrant. That's one of the things I loved when I got into indie makeup.
Indiemakeupandmore,3e14m6,Mua_wannabe_,2,Tue Jul 21 03:48:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm...I usually avoid sharp citrus scents (no idea why, I guess it's my own taste that's the issue!). Possets does do lemony  citrus scents (but I can't find any that has the notes you've mentioned!), and I hear from their forums that her lemon notes are varied and good (so you might find something as sweet and zesty as lemon skittles!).   I also know that Acorns and Alchemy does a few decent scents (and are very evocative), but I've never tried their lemony scents either. However the tea-tree notes are great! So you might like A&A's Artemis (which has lemongrass, sage and vanilla--sadly no peppermint or tea tree), Bliss (Lemon, peppermint and 'sweet basil'), and Enchanted Forest (rosemary, lemon, grass, tea tree, pine).  The downside of these two companies is that they often give out leaky sample vials. But in my experience, they both make great quality perfumes!"

And it's also kind of metallic, and there's a soft something that smells a bit like ""plastic that was sticky with orange juice and it all got burnt"" when the scent is barely there anymore, after like eight hours, so that's probably the fresh Barbie scent. What the notes I can smell are, I have no idea..."

I know certain leather notes will turn into that plastic smell that reminds me of new plastic stools (maybe fresh Barbies to you). Oh, and I also discovered that some natural pineapple perfumes produce this ester scent that smells ""balloon-ish"" to me. Those are the only plastic scents I can think of."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dzydk,_roodrallec_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:26:29 2015 UTC,"Lippie  I think I'd basically dupe Morgana Cryptoria Troll Repellant/Nyx.  I only have one photo of myself wearing it, but it was night time and I used a very awful phone camera.  The photo makes it look very pink, but in person it was a lovely bright magenta with a strong violet shift.  You can see /u/PhyrraNyx's swatch and review here for a better idea.  I went through, like, two tubes of it.  There was a third, but it disappeared.  It was too good for this world.  It probably looked awful on my skin, but I don't care, I loved it lots.  MC has been on hiatus for a long time, and I wasn't impressed with the formula of their Black Friday lipsticks, so I am devastated that I will never find another like it.  If I could, I'd get something similar made.  A long-wearing lipstick in duochrome colors, which I know are hard for that format, but OH PLEASE.  I don't need fancy packaging, although I would like it if the freakin' label sticker stayed on properly.  Those tiny ones on the bottoms of tubes always disappear!  Perfume  I'd like to make a fragrance after my grandma. Rather than basing it on notes, I think I'd just throw out several memories, which happen to be food-based.   She was the type of person who would make everyone's favorite dish for dinner, even though that meant extra work.  My father has this (to me, disgusting) memory about how his favorite food as a kid was spaghetti on mashed potatoes. Apparently, when she moved here from Kansas, she fell in love with Mexican seasons and Asian spices. So she made everything spicy. This is why my dad has an abnormal tolerance for spicy food - like, the kind where you probably need to sign a waiver so that the restaurant is not legally responsible for injuries.  When she made lunches for her kids, they were extremely spicy for most kiddy palates, making their food untradeable in the cafeteria black market.  Like, my idea of ""too spicy"" is his mild. In her downtime, she baked! It was usually experimental, and often very delicious. I remember her carrot spicecake best. It was like carrot cake, but from heaven. She used to bake for people in her neighborhood all the time, and made up reasons why they deserved cake - HURRAY YOU MOWED YOUR LAWN! I AM SORRY MY CAT BEAT UP YOUR DOG!  YOUR HAIRCUT LOOKS FABULOUS!  She did not write down recipes so after she died, it all went away. She collected porcelain cat figurines. Her hair turned white early - like, in her late teens, early 20s - so she dyed it red.  Like a badass villain.   So, maybe carrot cake, spices, tomato (leaf), cold porcelain...? I dunno. Something warm and cozy because grandma's kitchen, but also not a straight-forward gourmand so I could wear it.  I'd give it her name, Voncella."

I only messaged them after I didn't get my order for over 2 months (international shipping makes me very patient), but I got a pretty fast reply. Unfortunately, it was a stock message they send to everyone. They did finally send me my order about a week or two after that though. I was initially impressed with the customer service because it sounded like they're taking responsibility for their mistakes, but when I find out that this was a deliberate business strategy instead of a one-off mistake...not cool."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dykts,ichikoa,14,Mon Jul 20 16:15:17 2015 UTC,"The great thing about indie perfumes is you can try a bunch of samples! You just missed the swap threads but you can probably still message the people who posted because chances are they have those things available still.  I recommend that because for a total newbie, it might be better to try to snag a bunch of samples from diff companies from one person (flat rate shipping) than trying out a bunch of perfume houses at once! Just easier on the wallet.  That being said, some companies with IMO easy to love, beginner scents that offer sample packs are the following:  Solstice Scents  Alkemia  Possets  Alchemic Muse  Nocturne Alchemy with a caveat- (tied with SS for my favorite, BUT the site is hard to navigate compared to the others, so maybe hold off on that until you feel more comfortable navigating different perfume notes/families)  Some of my personal favorites for ""beginner""/crowd-pleaser perfumes:   Alchemic Muse Nightshade (soft powdered sugar and lavender with a bit of chocolate, but not too much) Alchemic Muse Pomona (fresh fruity pear and lavender) Solstice Scents Smoky Mountain Mallow (smoky sweet marshmallow) Solstice Scents Sycamore Sugarworks (banana-pear pastries) Solstice Scents Astral Temple (orange that fades out into a beautiful ginger, vanilla, amber scent) Possets Dance with Me (perfect hybrid of grapefruit and vanilla)   In general I find SS does well with gourmands (food smells), woods, spices, and smoky notes. Alchemic Muse has great fruit floral blends and realistic food smells. Alkemia has scents that skew more ""mainstream"" in their appeal, a lot of well blended florals, musks, spices, and woods. Possets excels at deceptively simple but complex scents- anything they do with vanilla is great. Also their aquatics/fresh scents are quite good. Nocturne Alchemy is amazing for incense, resin, woodsy, musks, and vanillas. But again I think of them as more ""advanced"" both because of the price (slightly steeper than other suggestions) and the un-navigability of their site, which makes them challenging for someone who isn't 100% set in her perfume tastes yet :)"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dykts,chdeks,2,Mon Jul 20 20:55:40 2015 UTC,Nope! No chocolate either. Just smokey marshmallow. It layers well though so you could easily layer with a cookie scent to get a smores thing going!

Cocoa Pink has a scent called Sugar Cookies that is a plain cookie-type smell. It's not my favorite because it's very subtle. I think you could find a more gingersnap-like cookie scent that would give you a graham-cracker feel. I love Philtres #4 by Arcana, it's like the perfect gingersnap cheesecake scent."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dykts,QoSN,2,Tue Jul 21 20:05:39 2015 UTC,I do this too! :) People are usually very pleased because it's stuff they wanted to clear out anyway.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dykts,lgbtqbbq,5,Tue Jul 21 20:10:09 2015 UTC,"For specific recommendations:    My favourite clove scent is The Whispering Woods from Sugar and Spite. It's mostly clove sweetened with brown sugar on a fresh woodsy base.    The de Ceylon from Alkemia, which is part of their layering collection and is a lovely black tea scent. Madam Pearl, also from Alkemia, smells like vanilla and spiced black tea to me. Sarawen also just came out with an entire tea collection that I've been wanting to try.    My favourite vanillas are from Possets. Lou Lou's Soaps, Scrubs, & Scents also has a great Vanilla Lovers' Collection."

Black Marshmallow - You love sweet things like sugar cubes and white lace. But sometimes you need to be a little naughty. Try this new “foody sexy” blend of sweet marshmallow fluff and rich ambers for a dessert you won’t forget.      Cinderella’s Carriage – What did Cinderella really wish for? We think it was this blend of Coconut Cream Pie with Marshmallow Meringue, Sweet Pumpkin, Spiritueuse Double Vanilla, and Vanilla Bean Noel. We think this is the REAL reason the prince fell in love, who could resist Cinderella in sexy foody?      Fluffy Green Tea- We took our fabulous Green Tea and blended it with Marshmallows.      Mad Hatter Cookies Noel – Almondy sweet mad hatter, sugar cookies, marshmallow frosting, and Vanilla Bean Noel.      Marshmallow- Creamy rich whipped marshmallow sugary whiteness. No almond or toasty notes. This is a perfect scent for all vanilla lovers. Excellent for layering. BESTSELLER!      Marshmallow Cake on Mondays - This scent has it all. It is our bestselling Cake on Mondays scent blended with marshmallow. Do not let the name fool you; this is still a Cake on Mondays scent only a bit softer and sweeter.  Original Cake on Mondays lovers will fall in love with this new updated version."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dykts,Estridde,5,Tue Jul 21 00:56:23 2015 UTC,"some tea and marshmallow based perfumes you might like:     Possets High Tea - at first this really smells like Lipton iced tea but it calms down into a more classic black tea scent. Notes are: Tea, lemon, sugar, milk, linens.   sixteen92 The Tea Party - notes are Vanilla almond birthday cake topped with Earl Grey buttercream.  Limited edition for July and August, samples are available but limited stock. It's part of their birthday sale and there are also coupon codes based on how much you spend. If you check out their page here the codes are there.   sixteen92 also has Cloven (general catalogue) which has clove as well as other spices. Notes are: Balsam, Fossilized Amber Resin, Vanilla Absolute, German Blue Chamomile, Cinnamon, Cardamom, Clove, Damascus Rose, Neroli.   TenThree labs has an entire marshmallow based set of perfumes here  Haus of Gloi has Elevenses (general catalogue) which is a black tea and citrus blend (notes: Fluffy little orange cakes, sugar coated toasty almonds and a wee steaming cup of black tea). The samples appear to be sold out right now but they also have a number of bath and body products in the same scent.     For marshmallow, it pops up a lot in seasonal fall releases. Sixteen92 had Toasted Marshmallow last year which became a fan favorite, and Haus of Gloi Smores is also pretty good.  Arcana uses marshmallow in blends from time to time, your best bet would be to join a decant circle  since the blends can be quite complex and you may not want to start out blind buying a bottle.  For vanillas, Nocturne Alchemy Vapothecary (NAVA) is often recommended.  Getting samples can be tricky so check out decant circles for NAVA as well."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dykts,ishotthepilot,3,Tue Jul 21 00:46:20 2015 UTC,"Actually, as someone who went from spray perfume to indie perfume oils - throw out everything you thought you knew. Start over.  I used to hate pretty much everything that wasn't heavy incense and spices, because they smelled so artificial and headache-inducing. (I still wish that department stores wouldn't force me to walk through the perfume section before getting to everything else; all it does is put me in a bad mood and make me 200% less likely to buy anything).   Now? I'm game for almost anything. I'll wear florals, greens, aquatics, you name it. If it sounds good I'll try it, and it's very rare that a perfume doesn't work on me - more often, it just doesn't jive with me at that moment (or I'm having to seriously chop down the fullsizes wishlist). I have a much easier time picking out individual notes, and they just work on me so much more often.   For vanilla-heavy perfumes, I'd suggest Firebird Vanilla Amber or Almond Milk; Vanilla & Woodsmoke is another option but I haven't tried it yet. BPAL has Snake Oil (which gets better with age, but I'm not sure how the vanilla goes) and Dorian (which is a very boozy, sugary vanilla to me) that I've tried and...well, check the vanilla tag on the site to see all of their vanilla scents, because there's probably a lot more than those two."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dykts,smushmallow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:45:15 2015 UTC,"I thought I hated perfume before indie scents. I have chronic migraine that is easily aggravated by scents. Mainstream perfumes wreaked havoc on me, and I had swore off everything from scented lotion to scented laundry soap.  However, I bought some indie eyeshadow samples from the exchange last fall, and the person included some scent samples, and I was hooked! Holy cow, I was blown away with how real some of the scents are. Nothing like the alcohol and floral heavy scents that dominated the market, or the fruity bubblegum scents that were so cloying I though my head was going to explode (I'm looking at you weird orange vanilla Hello Kitty perfume).  I recommend buying a sample pack of things that sound good. Most brands offer packs, and they are a great way to get a feel for the notes. Everyone's skin chemistry is different, and each shop will have its own take on a particular note.  I feel like vanilla scents are done well in the indie world, but vary depending on the shop. I snagged a bottle of Arcana's Two Fingered Ballet, which is my ride or die vanilla. I love it.  Tea scents, are harder for me. While Darling Clandestine's /r/hugofdeath is wonderful for me, Blooddrop's Interlude did not!  /r/hugofdeath notes: intense black tea infused with a trio of fruits—strawberries, blackberries and sweet red apples—grounded with vetiver and ginger and tonka bean. On the skin, I get the fruit first, and the tea in the dry down. Love it. Not to heavy or sweet, not to dry. Hnng.  Interlude: Black tea, vanilla pastry, and strawberry jam. This is straight up black licorice on my skin. So sad."

Probably in that order. I haven't tried many of the amazing-looking Australian brands because shipping is so high (I'm in the US, and a single bottle from Pieta's Polish would cost me $30 with shipping.

If the products are good, their names won't affect my decision to purchase them, and if the names make someone else happy—well, that's awesome, and I'm glad it's out there for them to get excited about.  I can't think of any Discworld-inspired eyeshadows besides the ones /u/girlbyseaside just mentioned, but Literary Lacquer has a Discworld-inspired nail polish, and The Lady Varnishes has a whole collection of them.

Indiemakeupandmore,3dzjmo,eraser_dust,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:31:55 2015 UTC,SEA = Southeast Asia ;)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzjmo,NorthwestTreeOctopus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:37:32 2015 UTC,SEA = South-East Asia XD  I think there's tons of IMAM-ers in Seattle though! You're so lucky you live there...you guys get really awesome seafood!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzjmo,eraser_dust,2,Tue Jul 21 02:48:51 2015 UTC,"lol, welp! still wish I coulda gone! I dream of making a trips out there.  Seattle's nice. Seafood is a HUGE plus for me. I think I'd go crazy if I wasn't able to get fresh fish."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzjmo,NorthwestTreeOctopus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:56:43 2015 UTC,"Don't head to Jakarta, Indonesia then :P  Getting fresh seafood here is so tough, fresh seafood here is way more expensive than anywhere else ($25 for 1 small uni sushi, $200 for 1 lobster). T.T  If you're ever heading to Indonesia though, let me know! I can help you plan your trip :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzjmo,eraser_dust,2,Tue Jul 21 03:03:16 2015 UTC,$200 usd for a lobster? Now that makes me feel like such a cheapskate when I pass on 7.99 lobster tails!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzjmo,eraser_dust,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah..it's crazy here. Oh, and even if you're paying that much, it's not guaranteed to be fresh. My bf took me for fine dining, I got oysters despite everyone warning me not to....I puked all over him. He still stuck around so he's a keeper XD"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dzjmo,ThirteenDream,2,Tue Jul 21 04:17:16 2015 UTC,"Aw man, wish these were available to buy!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dz1aw,PhyrraNyx,2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:33 2015 UTC,YES! Glad i am not the only one obsessed with this scent. I am totally planning on getting the dry oil spray and more. It's so amazing!  My personal other summer scent is Mermaid lagoon. Have you checked that one out yet?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dz1aw,NorthwestTreeOctopus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:26 2015 UTC,I haven't tried that one! I've thought about it though because the description is perfection.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dz1aw,NorthwestTreeOctopus,2,Mon Jul 20 18:38:22 2015 UTC,it really is great. you should try a dram of it in your next order ;) so worth it
Indiemakeupandmore,3dz1aw,NorthwestTreeOctopus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:39:04 2015 UTC,I'll put in a request for it :) I just placed an order a little bit ago to buy perfume sprays of Hawaiian Cake and Cinderella's Carriage and requested Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream and Tokyo Market. I decided I NEEDED to have the spray version of my favorite roll ons.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dz1aw,rusrslythatdumb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:05 2015 UTC,have you has the perfume sprays before? I'm considering it
Indiemakeupandmore,3dz1aw,lgbtqbbq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:21 2015 UTC,"I have 3 of them! I have the Daisy dupe, Honey I Washed the Kids, and Coeur de Vahine. They're all alcohol based and I think they last longer because of the atomizer."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,StarryWayfarer,15,Mon Jul 20 13:23:29 2015 UTC,She has a livejournal page for news and stuff.  You can shop for her stuff at:   The Rhinestone Housewife  Pretty Indulgent  Her eBay Store  The Soapbox Co
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,frumperbell,5,Mon Jul 20 13:33:59 2015 UTC,"Ok this is a very arbitrary question but I've been wondering forever, do the products actually show up in her eBay store for anyone? Everyone always links to the store but for me it always says there's no products, instead I go just straight to ""items for sale"" from their profile. But yet everyone always links to the store, so I continue to wonder, am I missing something?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,12oo,5,Mon Jul 20 14:47:39 2015 UTC,"Make sure you go through ebay.com.  They technically don't ship internationally, so any other country url extension (.com.au, etc) will return no hits.   It's a super pain, coupled with how much the listings and cart design themselves change between areas. >>"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,Saffrin,3,Mon Jul 20 15:14:17 2015 UTC,"I always go through eBay.com haha, my acct is originally American so if I go thru .uk or .au eBay acts like I don't have an account. >3> I don't mind clicking on the ""items for sale"" link instead, it's just always confused me why people link the shop! I guess it is an eternal mystery ."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,12oo,3,Mon Jul 20 15:42:31 2015 UTC,"Strange.  If I go through .com.au, it pretends nothing exists, but it works fine under .com. Though I have no idea which one I signed up under originally."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,Saffrin,3,Mon Jul 20 15:48:02 2015 UTC,"That's weird, there are definitely listings.   I recall you not being in the US and I think Arcana's eBay doesn't ship outside the US unless you message them, so maybe that's why?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,homicidalunicorns,3,Mon Jul 20 14:57:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe I dunno haha, it always looks like this for me so I've been confused for ages.  Edit: Nope changed primary address to my US one, still nothing. I must be going crazy..."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,12oo,4,Mon Jul 20 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"That's bizarre, it even shows different follower counts. Mine shows 158 followers. STRANGE INTERNET HAPPENINGS"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,homicidalunicorns,6,Mon Jul 20 15:01:59 2015 UTC,ARCANA EBAY GHOST WOOOOOOOO
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,12oo,2,Mon Jul 20 15:05:04 2015 UTC,You're definitely being haunted.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,frumperbell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:37 2015 UTC,omg it even has categories i'm so jealous i can't see it now
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,12oo,2,Mon Jul 20 17:33:49 2015 UTC,... I didn't even notice. Usually I eBay on my phone.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,frumperbell,2,Mon Jul 20 18:05:20 2015 UTC,"Try hitting ""see all items in this store"""
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,ThirteenDream,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:44 2015 UTC,"I've done that multiple times, it just still gives me ""no items found"". I've ever tried doing it after setting my default address to my US one. Maybe it goes by ip address? (~)/ It's not the biggest deal like I said lol, it was just something I have been confused about forever so I thought I'd ask."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,12oo,2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:39 2015 UTC,Very strange.  If you logged off and deleted cookies it shouldn't.  Maybe if your IP is in another country.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,ThirteenDream,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:43 2015 UTC,"My IP is in Finland lol so that's why I think it maaay be something to do with it. It's a Mystery, gang!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,12oo,2,Mon Jul 20 19:47:05 2015 UTC,Lol.  Weird.  Ebay is a strange one.  A lot of algorithms go into search result rankings and such so I wouldn't be surprised
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,ThirteenDream,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:54 2015 UTC,I can see all of the items in the eBay store and my IP is Canadian. So who knows?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,swimmingmonkey,2,Mon Jul 20 21:24:33 2015 UTC,Change your shipping and product location to the US and it should appear! I'm in Australia and always have this problem in my eBay app. I have to hit Watch on items via the browser version before it shows up in my eBay.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,pondicus,2,Mon Jul 20 22:26:19 2015 UTC,Thanks! So excited to explore her Apples Crave collection. RIP wallet
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,elephantabate,2,Mon Jul 20 13:36:56 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping this collection expands/returns come fall. I have quite a few of them, and really love this set."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,bluemistress,4,Mon Jul 20 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"You can get their perfumes through their eBay store (arcana_soaps iirc) or through their stockists, Rhinestone Housewife and Pretty Indulgent. The stockists tend to have more variety than the eBay store, I think. Each of the three options sometimes has perfumes the other ones don't, so if you're looking for a specific perfume and you can't find it in one of them, check the other two as well!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,randomactsofbadness,2,Mon Jul 20 13:28:30 2015 UTC,Yes! Thank you so much. <3
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,12oo,2,Mon Jul 20 13:31:59 2015 UTC,"Also, throw some recommendations at me!  Not a fan of floral/powdery.  Anything else is fair game :D"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,homicidalunicorns,4,Mon Jul 20 13:32:33 2015 UTC,"Puppy kisses!  It's creamy, minty, and fruity.  Which sounds weird, but is oh so perfect.  I would suggest stalking the swaps here to get samples, or posting a request for samples on the mega thread.  Also Ajevie does a decant circle when new releases come out that you may try as well."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,ustrinanongrata,4,Mon Jul 20 14:28:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you don't mind some light reading, try paging through More Tea Wesley, Amanda has done a whole month's worth of Arcana reviews, so she's really got quite a bunch! Not all of them are still buyable, but many of them are from the General Catalogue or are still available. (Also Astrid's Diadem, which the review I believe says is no longer available, was brought back and is now in the general catalogue.)   My favorite Arcana is Holy Terror. If you enjoy resin-y, incense-y, burning Catholic church type scents, it is amazing."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,homicidalunicorns,2,Mon Jul 20 14:42:58 2015 UTC,"If you're okay with moderate amounts of lavender, Puppy Kisses and Bonfires at Dusk. It's not really noticeable at all in my bottle of Puppy Kisses (which is part of why I'm destashing it) and the scent is instead minty and creamy and soft. Bonfires at Dusk is just so, so good. Charred dark herbs and wood and non-floral lavender and a barely creamy beeswax bringing it all together.  Filthy Viking is nice if you like really minty, cold scents."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,elephantabate,2,Mon Jul 20 15:00:32 2015 UTC,Oh my glob those sound wonderful. I'm in trouble haha.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,Saffrin,2,Mon Jul 20 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm curious. I don't really get any mint out of my Puppy Kisses. The most detectable note for me is an almost vinegar scent (I'm assuming it's the balsam?). Is it like that for you? I don't really like that note at all whatever it is which is why I want to destash mine"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,emmian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:13:40 2015 UTC,"I definitely don't get any vinegar, just creamy mint."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,elephantabate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"For me I think it is the bayberry going sour on my skin. I know this blend has a lot of fans, but I think I now exactly what you mean.    I usually like bayberry, and maybe it is another note entirely, though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,bluemistress,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:21 2015 UTC,"I hardly get mint from it, either. It's there at the start, but fades away into the more woody, sharper notes."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dxyoy,elephantabate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"It was mostly sage and mint on me, but it wasn't my cup of tea either so I destashed."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,uponaworld,26,Mon Jul 20 02:49:40 2015 UTC,Thank you for splitting the release times because I hate not sleeping.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,jujicakes,4,Mon Jul 20 02:59:40 2015 UTC,Absolutely no problem at all!! We wanted to make sure it was available to different time zones :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,MynameisHolix,16,Mon Jul 20 03:00:27 2015 UTC,My body says YES! But my wallet says NO!!

Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,Saffrin,2,Mon Jul 20 04:20:21 2015 UTC,You could sell your soul! o.o
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,Boobtape,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:48 2015 UTC,As tempting as that is I think I'll just make this my birthday present for the year :) since it should ship just in time for it (and I can totally justify it that way)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,Boobtape,8,Tue Jul 21 02:46:28 2015 UTC,What's happening with the international boxes as you have a polish company in the box?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,Saffrin,7,Mon Jul 20 12:02:40 2015 UTC,Great question! Leesha's Lacquer is actually making a cuticle oil for the box so that we don't have to worry about shipping nail polish overseas :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,girlbyseaside,8,Mon Jul 20 12:03:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's a bit underwhelming to get a cuticle oil instead of a polish as a potential international buyer."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,girlbyseaside,11,Mon Jul 20 12:56:07 2015 UTC,There won't be any polish included in the box at all! Everyone will be receiving cuticle oil. We didn't want international buyers to think we were excluding them!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,ferbrat,4,Mon Jul 20 12:57:58 2015 UTC,Oh! That makes more sense thanks for clarifying :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,ferbrat,6,Mon Jul 20 12:59:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely no problem :) If you have any other concerns as an international buyer, please let any of us know. We tried to make this box as friendly as possible."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,Calm_Sapphire,3,Mon Jul 20 13:00:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Me again! I checked out the FB page, and the list of companies differs? Here lists HW, but the FB page lists their specific bath and body company.   Are people to expect makeup or bath/body products from Christine?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,tightslacks,4,Mon Jul 20 13:07:22 2015 UTC,"I was unsure if Hello Waffle had announced her bath and body company when I posted this announcement so I wrote HW instead of Sunsets and Seas Bath! But you are correct, the box will have an item from her bath and body company rather than her makeup company!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,kstinasunflower,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:17:26 2015 UTC,Should we expect soaps or cosmetics from you? :D
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,kstinasunflower,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:47 2015 UTC,There are plenty of great companies up there that specialise in cosmetics! I am doing soap :)

Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,girlbyseaside,6,Tue Jul 21 18:01:55 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness, this sounds amazing!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,girlbyseaside,6,Mon Jul 20 03:04:23 2015 UTC,It's so exciting!!!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,normalcypolice,5,Mon Jul 20 03:11:07 2015 UTC,Yes. Exactly :).
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,normalcypolice,6,Mon Jul 20 03:12:38 2015 UTC,Ah! What a great idea to try something from a lot of companies at once.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,normalcypolice,8,Mon Jul 20 03:08:41 2015 UTC,Yeah! We also thought it'd be a great opportunity to do some holiday shopping too. Split up the box and share with friends and family!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,krysiefishie,6,Mon Jul 20 03:11:20 2015 UTC,Oh yes!!! This sounds so cool!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,normalcypolice,2,Mon Jul 20 03:11:28 2015 UTC,Counting down the clock
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,krysiefishie,4,Mon Jul 20 03:15:12 2015 UTC,Haha! Yes.  I just marked it on my Calendar.  Are all the release times in EST? :]
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,normalcypolice,3,Mon Jul 20 03:18:01 2015 UTC,"They are! I only marked the one, sorry about that!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,krysiefishie,2,Mon Jul 20 03:19:39 2015 UTC,"Oh that's alright! I tend to assume EST, thankfully despite be currently not live in that timezone, I grew up in it so the time conversion is still pretty engrained in my head."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,CorvusCorset,2,Mon Jul 20 03:27:35 2015 UTC,That's such a cool gif...

Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,Kayleemarie1994,6,Mon Jul 20 17:32:54 2015 UTC,Are we revealing the theme of the box?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,RhinestoneHousewife,5,Mon Jul 20 03:19:15 2015 UTC,You can definitely reveal! I said it was holidays past :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,MistressBats,5,Mon Jul 20 03:20:08 2015 UTC,"My brain must have not noticed that. Anyway, we're all doing things inspired by various holidays that have some sort of personal significance - mostly winter type holidays, as far as I can tell."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,Caitir,4,Mon Jul 20 03:26:50 2015 UTC,"All winter type for this box!! :)   I think the holidays we have confirmed are Hanukkah, Christmas, Three Kings Day, and Chinese New Year!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,Caitir,2,Mon Jul 20 06:12:00 2015 UTC,I had a couple parties in NOVEMBER to avoid this whole issue.

Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,NoodleFarts,5,Tue Jul 21 04:42:00 2015 UTC,I will be moving between the preorder and the actual arrival. Will it be possible to update the address after ordering?

Some of that is the risk of a mystery box of awesomeness, I know!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwhdq,Calm_Sapphire,4,Mon Jul 20 17:02:36 2015 UTC,"All of the products being offered in the box are being made exclusively for The Indie Memory Box. That being said, it is up to the individual brand owner if they wish to sell extras that did not make it into the box. Even so, if they were to sell extras, they would most likely be priced at retail value instead of the wholesale price that we are able to offer with the box :) I hope that answers your question well!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dx95w,Boobtape,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:45:54 2015 UTC,It's really nice! It smells masculine because of the mahogany but I wish I had used something else instead of chocolate since I can't smell it at all in the scent.

Indiemakeupandmore,3dx95w,chocolatebundtcake,4,Mon Jul 20 20:47:24 2015 UTC,"I got a few scents in my sample pack that seem winter-y  White fox, Winter Dove, Grey's Cabin, and Smoky Mountain Mallow.  I reeeeallly wish I hadn't used up all of my Sixteen92 Toasted Marshmallow because I think it would be great layered with the Smoky Mt. Mallow to cut down on some of the smokiness.  I'm going to try Smoky Mt. layered with Snowshoe Pass and see how that goes.  Fall/winter need to hurry up!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dx95w,KalmiaKamui,6,Tue Jul 21 01:30:05 2015 UTC,"Midsummer Dream Apothecary Thumbelina.  Probably the truest to note list perfume I've ever tried.  I never thought I'd like a marshmallow scent, but the creamy, vanilla-y marshmallow in this is to die for.  Has way better longevity than the other dozen-ish MSDA scents I've tried, too.  It's really too bad this one isn't in their general catalog."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dx95w,Aiota,5,Mon Jul 20 14:54:40 2015 UTC,Solstice Scent's Chantilly Cream.  <3 It is my go-to scent and I love to slather it all over myself!

Agh it's SO hot, I spent the weekend being hot and muggy and blach so I needed something kind of refreshing and light. This is a really nice musky white floral, almost aquatic from the heather, but predominantly a fresh sweet magnolia and muguet. Muguet is lily of the valley, and I know there are probably folks who find it old lady-ish (it's a very traditional perfumey note) but I love it. It's slightly heady but also kind of fresh and green without being grassy.  The perfumer notes said that this is what they imagine the flowers around Bilbo Baggins house would smell like. I think that's quite accurate, so instead of sitting in a hot office today working on a Monday, I'm pretending I'm sitting in a cool dark hobbit hole with a tankard of cider and some seed cake."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dx95w,lgbtqbbq,3,Mon Jul 20 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"And now I decided to layer a bit- added some NAVA Egyptian Musk for some more sweetness, and some Cocoa Pink Fluffy Green Tea. Fluffy Green Tea is TO DIE FOR delicious. It sounds incongruous, and the ""green tea"" that a lot of people use is citrusy, but this is perfectly real green tea leaves + beautiful marshmallow. I want to try more of Cocoa Pink's marshmallow-heavy scents!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dx95w,gottapoopy,3,Mon Jul 20 13:33:58 2015 UTC,Do they smell similar?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dx95w,emmian,2,Mon Jul 20 14:01:40 2015 UTC,"I'd say fairly similar. Ra's definitely is sweeter and has more vanilla while Sycamore has more spice. I feel like I could ""dupe"" Ra's by layering NAVA Crystalline or Pyramid Vanille with Sycamore."

I don't know what sweetbriar is but from this scent I have to think its a small berry or sweet grass. Okay I looked it up and it's a shrub? I don't know what's smelling sweet and berry like in this but it's kind of overtaking all the light woods. This isn't at all what I expected, not bad, but not exciting.

I haven't worn it in a few months, and had forgotten that my bottle is more clover than floral, so that was a little surprising. If you like fresh, true to life ""meadow during spring"" scents, this is it.  I then promptly accidentally pulled a nearly all-nighter reading (V.E. Schwab's Vicious, v good), so I figured I'd wear something that would keep me awake and alert. Arcana Filthy Viking has the added bonus of smelling cold on a hot day. The juniper is strong on my skin, but the mint is in no way shy, and thankfully isn't too pepperminty or sweet. The wood note lies below those, grounding the scent. This would be awesome on a romantic/sexual partner, but I'm perfectly happy wearing those sorts of scents on my own. Nice switch up from my usual florals."

Train Delay is a sweet coffee (a coffee perfume that doesn't go bitter on me) that for some reason reminds me of a craft type store around Christmas time. In the bottle, Thunder made me think of aloe vera with lidocane in it (I'm not really sure why I decided to try it out first considering that) that turns into wet honeysuckle on my skin. I think this might be lovely layered with Supercell."

I don't get a heady patchoulli, but more herbal/green scent mellowed out by dark vanilla making it almost smoky. Quite interesting.    Left hand: NAVA Vanilla Necropolis - Did not get to apply enough for me to critically smell it, but it is a non-foody vanilla. There are hints of rose and amber in this one too. This would have been perfect as the spotlight scent today, too.    Vanilla Necropolis Gentle cool breeze from outside, My house is fucking hot and humid inside 80 degrees and cloudy, Ants, ants, ants, everywhere! Their death sweet, slow, and steady"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dx8qv,pondicus,5,Mon Jul 20 07:57:06 2015 UTC,"Sarawen is one of my favourite perfume brands! I've had nothing but positive experiences with the owner and her products. Personally I don't get the whole ""Yankee candle"" thing from any of the scents but everyone is different. I've tried a few from your list:     Greenwood Maiden - Fruity and floral. I can really smell the blackberry and gardenia but there is enough sandalwood to make this a little earthy too. To me it smells like an overgrown garden beside a cottage in the middle of the woods. Lady Nightingale - Creamy white floral with a soft, pear-like fruitiness and a hint of vanilla. Makes me think of a super fancy dessert on a clean tablecloth that is covered with lush white flowers. Very elegant-smelling. Tea with Watson - True to description: a masculine gourmand. Black tea and tobacco sweetened with slightly burnt-smelling caramel and a hint of cake. The bay rum keeps it from being too foodie or feminine.  Wayward Son - From the description I was expecting this one to be a strong scent but on me it's an almost fresh-smelling skin scent. Almost smells like a person, not a perfume, if that makes sense. Paper and very faint hints of sweetened coffee blend into musk and sandalwood.  Ranger - This is one if one of my favourite masculine scents because the leather and cypress are present and very, well, ""manly"" smelling but they're not in your face and are softened beautifully by the floral element. The sandalwood grounds everything together. This is like a masculine version of my favourite Sarawen scent, Shieldmaiden."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dx8qv,weepy,2,Mon Jul 20 17:25:53 2015 UTC,Oooh this sounds really promising - thank you so much for sharing! I'll have to sit on my list a bit longer and see how I feel about the sampling.

Potion Master was my surprise favorite of the samples I ordered (great masculine scent), but I probably use Pixie Dust the most because of its light sweetness. I use it to soften harsher perfumes sometimes. The ones I tried had decent longevity, maybe 6ish hours? It depends on the notes though."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dx8qv,i_am_a_cyborg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:20:04 2015 UTC,No prob! Just spot tested Piemaker - it doesn't smell like pie. The cakepie is a lie! It smells lightly of berries though I couldn't tell you which ones. The tuberose seems to be coming through for me more than the other notes so I'm not sure I'd have classified this as unisex. The musk and amber are definitely still present though; not really sure what apple spice is supposed to smell like - apple? Cinnamon? The sillage is very low.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dx8qv,i_am_a_cyborg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:47 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... Apple cinnamon scents in perfumes seem so overdone I feel, but that may be because I'm so spoiled by Arcana hahah. I may scratch this off my list - came for the tuberose and left because of the apple pie (hah, what did I expect!)  Thanks so much for spot-testing though! I really appreciate it :))"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dx8qv,whereismydragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:17 2015 UTC,I actually can't smell any apple or cinnamon which is why I was confused about its inclusion on the note list. it might just make it a little sweeter smelling? So if you want tuberose then this may actually be a good one to try!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dx8qv,whereismydragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:59 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I'm so indecisive. I'll sit on it and decide whether or not to include it when I hit Checkout ;p"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dx8qv,misosoup122,2,Mon Jul 20 22:23:46 2015 UTC,"I've ordered from her about 4 or 5 times now and haven't had any problems. I really like lots of her perfumes.   I've only tried a few those scents: Piemaker, Queen of the Seas and Tea with Watson. Tea with Watson is a cozy scent that would go well with reading a book. Queen of the Seas was nice (I haven't tried it in a while) and Piemaker was okay (I only tried it once and them forgot about it).   The brands that work well for you work well for me too.  My faves (mostly not masculine though):   Dorian Shieldmaiden Valiant Heart Isis Ravish Georgina Undying   I can't wait to hear how the Outlander perfumes smell."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dx8qv,misosoup122,2,Mon Jul 20 16:50:02 2015 UTC,Yeah... I just realised my whole list is pretty masculine HAHA. Thanks for your list! :3  What did you like about Shieldmaiden? I'm umm-ing and ahh-ing over this one.  That stupid book didn't put me to bed til 2am last night! I have work today!! Dammit Jamie!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dx8qv,Sylph_14,2,Mon Jul 20 22:22:17 2015 UTC,Shieldmaiden is a mixture of femininity and strength. It smells like a warrior woman.  This guy kept you up all night?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dvyb6,ferbrat,4,Sun Jul 19 23:58:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review! I'm crazy about aquatics, so I bought all the aquatic decants from Ajevie. I've always known Possets as the vanilla/gourmand company, but actually they seem very great with aquatics. I like ALL the aquatic ones I got from them, including the ones from GC."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dvyb6,candiedorange,3,Mon Jul 20 01:01:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the reviews! I was interested in Hay Wain based on the notes, so I'm happy to hear that it worked so well for you. The grapefruit and lily of the valley sound like an absolutely lovely pairing."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dvyb6,MageLocusta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:02:01 2015 UTC,It's pretty long lasting on me. I'd say a good 6 hours. It really is an amazing scent :).

Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,mermaidunicornhybrid,4,Mon Jul 20 01:20:05 2015 UTC,"Mine does that in the same area, but otherwise it's good. I think maybe it's a little too thin? Or maybe thinner than the other mattes. I have Kitten and it doesn't do that.  I was going to be messaging Fyrinnae before I do my review of it to see what they thought might be the problem. If it didn't leave that little area on my lips more sheer it would be perfection.   Edit to add it only looks to sheer on my bottom lip in the same area as yours. I don't have any problems on my upper lip."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,toxidlotus,4,Mon Jul 20 01:25:08 2015 UTC,"what's weird is that my Kitten DOES do this... I do have super pigmented lips though, so that might be part of it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,electricbetsy,2,Mon Jul 20 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"Same, bottom lip is the problem! I think I might have gotten a dud, because Dorian said it was supposed to be more the consistency of white glue and mine is runny :( I was just wondering if I'm the only one."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,toxidlotus,2,Mon Jul 20 01:29:07 2015 UTC,Oh really? Mine is runny too. I will have to email them then and ask about it now rather than later! Thank you for mentioning that!

Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,PhyrraNyx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:17:36 2015 UTC,That's what I want! It wasn't drying until the third coat (which any matte product would be) but I'm only packing it on so thick because I want the pretty blue to show!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,toxidlotus,6,Mon Jul 20 14:58:56 2015 UTC,What I've found works best for color changing products on my lips is to line and fill in my lips with a similar lip pencil. Then layer the matte liquid lipstick on top.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,PhyrraNyx,2,Mon Jul 20 02:04:15 2015 UTC,"I think that would help. Could you recommend a lipliner to go with this? I was thinking MAC nightmoth, but mine ran out and now I'm 100% CF and won't repurchase."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,toxidlotus,3,Mon Jul 20 02:08:51 2015 UTC,Yes I would like to know what lip pencil you'd use with it too.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,PhyrraNyx,3,Mon Jul 20 02:14:05 2015 UTC,I would use OCC Black Dahlia. Love it to bits!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,PhyrraNyx,2,Mon Jul 20 03:44:23 2015 UTC,Thanks!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,Kirena,5,Mon Jul 20 03:52:25 2015 UTC,I would use OCC Black Dahlia. I highly recommend the OCC pencils as they're cruelty free and vegan. You can get them from Nordstrom (and Nordstrom is having their current anniversary sale right now. You can see me wearing Wizardry with Black Dahlia here.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,miraclesystem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:44:50 2015 UTC,Oooo great match!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,cocytusg,2,Mon Jul 20 03:56:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I honestly find the OCC pencils to be indispensable because: 1. they are comfortable enough to wear on their own like a lipstick 2. they work perfectly as lip liners 3. they work well with a wide variety of colors      They're my #1 favorite lip pencil, with UD's 24/7s #2 and Colour Pop #3."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,Dorian_Gray_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:59:59 2015 UTC,"I use MAC Nightmoth. Wizardry is a very thin formula, so having a dark lipliner helped avoid patchiness for me."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,cocytusg,4,Mon Jul 20 04:30:50 2015 UTC,"Mine does the same, and is very runny. I actually just tried it again today after shaking it for a very long time and there was no improvement."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,starward-,3,Mon Jul 20 01:51:30 2015 UTC,"My Wizardry behaves as if I'm applying a dark watercolor on my lips: thin, dark, and drier than I'm used to. If I don't have a chapstick or something on underneath it, it dries my lips something fierce. Applying something over it for moisture kind of muddies the whole thing. It doesn't have a strong duochrome like an eyeshadow: I think that effect appears more between the build-up's cool shimmer and the bright pink stain that develops beneath it.  Edit I just looked. Mine applies thinner/redder on the meatier section of my bottom lip too: picture at bottom of album.  It looks like mine behaves like yours, but I love it. It makes my lips look plumper (although I guess I don't really need that, but whatever)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,starward-,4,Mon Jul 20 02:32:08 2015 UTC,"Mine applies thinner/redder on the meatier section of my bottom lip too   Yep, that looks like the colour change. If you hold the tube up to a lamp, it'll look vibrant pink. The base hue alone is a somewhat dull burgundy. We test each run before bottling, so the isododecane must have kept thinning them (it's not supposed to!) afterward. This particular shade might feel overly dry due to its dry colourant ratio. Volcanic is about the same. Feel free to email us on this!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,Dorian_Gray_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:50:25 2015 UTC,"I thought it was the duochrome, but this post made we wonder if our lips are just weird or something. But I love my Wizardry. Luff. I've grown to love how dry it is because it makes my lips look awesomely textured. I really have nothing against this lovely little gem.  :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,Dorian_Gray_,2,Mon Jul 20 21:11:15 2015 UTC,"I do find Wizardry needs a bit of babying to work. I have to shake mine before using as it does settle really quickly and I find instead of swiping it on as I would with a doe foot normally, I have to kinda pat it on to stop it from going patchy if that makes sense?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw7fv,Dorian_Gray_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:04:26 2015 UTC,"I ended up doing that and it worked really well on my top lip, but nothing could help with my bottom lip. It's like they're made out of different stuff, I swear! Maybe my lips are just haunted."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dw8cr,badluckbelle,3,Mon Jul 20 16:18:26 2015 UTC,"I really like CocoaPink's Voluptuous Body Butter. They have a few orange/mandarin scents (though I haven't tried them).

Indiemakeupandmore,3dw8cr,imamelf,2,Mon Jul 20 01:55:02 2015 UTC,Blood Orange looks right up my ally! Do you have any experience with their body butters?

Indiemakeupandmore,3dw8cr,antiernan,3,Mon Jul 20 20:14:21 2015 UTC,"I've never found a true orange scent. Pacifica's blood orange is super sweet on me, and everything else seems to contain vanilla or something else that weighs it down. I once walked past a woman in the mall who smelled like a fresh orange. Not orange perfume, not orange juice, an orange. I'm forever kicking myself for not stopping her and asking. I'm trying to get a true orange scent in my line, but it's incredibly hard."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dw8cr,Abbygoat,2,Mon Jul 20 13:50:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Orange-vanilla scents have this tendency to smell like play-doh on me so I've been searching for a true orange since forever. One day, I hope :("

Indiemakeupandmore,3dwpnk,marashade,11,Mon Jul 20 04:07:38 2015 UTC,"I think it is important to give their customer service a chance to respond, because accidents do happen. I think a lot of people will say that its important to go to the brand, because maybe there was an issue. They can't fix something if they don't know about it. Now, if this happened to me multiple time, with the same brand, then I think it would lead to me being less likely to go to that brand in the future. If you are going to basically promise something to a customer, you should deliver. I do understand that a lot of times GWP are limited quantity, but I think in that instance, a note or alternative should be included."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwpnk,krysiefishie,15,Mon Jul 20 04:13:26 2015 UTC,"It has happened to me in the past, even with some of my absolute favourite companies; mistakes do happen. Due to the fact that it was advertised, then yes you have a right to the ""free sample/gift"" but it's not a deal breaker for me. It is disappointing, but not enough to damage my opinion of the brand/s. I usually get distracted with all the pretty products I'd ordered...  I had a GWP promo that was not included in my order, and I emailed the owner to ask if she would hold the GWP for me until my next order to save her on shipping it to me (a single full size to Australia, what a waste of time and effort) and when my next order came, she included two extra FS shadows and a lip sample for me to say thank you. Sometimes it's worth it to show a little kindness and understanding, brand owners are people too."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwpnk,Kirena,6,Mon Jul 20 04:24:26 2015 UTC,"For me, it would 100% depend on what the free thing was. Like, if I made a Shiro order and didn't get a sample baggie, whatever, nbd, I have too many sample baggies anyway. But if it was a larger item, I'd definitely mention it, especially if it was a promotional item or something."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwpnk,ponyproblematic,5,Mon Jul 20 11:44:11 2015 UTC,"It can and does happen, because there are people packing your order and people make mistakes :) most companies are quite apologetic and willing to make it up to you if you let them know. It would only be a deal breaker for me if they responded badly."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwpnk,whereismydragon,3,Mon Jul 20 06:45:36 2015 UTC,"This actually happened with my shiro anniversary order. They forgot the free anniversary color and a couple sample baggies. I debated against emailing but the samples that were missing were actually the ones I was most excited about haha, so I just did it. Caitlin responded the very next morning and had it shipped out right away! And she gave me even more samples and let me pick out the ones I got! I was super impressed and it makes me love shiro even more for their great CS."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwpnk,winnermn,3,Mon Jul 20 22:43:28 2015 UTC,"I emailed BB last night, and she responded this morning. She was super nice and gracious, and offered to send them along. Yay!

Indiemakeupandmore,3dwpnk,eraser_dust,5,Tue Jul 21 01:39:41 2015 UTC,"I definitely sympathize because on one hand, the freebie may have been the final push to convince you to buy the product. On the other hand, since it's free, it seems too much to ask for it. For me, I treat it the same way I'd treat the issue of it were a mainstream company, while keeping in mind that indies don't have the ability to take too many losses. I'd email them about it, but I don't expect them to be able to ship just one free sample over.   I've emailed LE before about a missing GWP which was the reason I ordered in the first place (it was a brand new colour). I mentioned I didn't mind waiting for my next order, but Jane actually sent a full-size of it immediately. With international shipping. I was impressed!  On the flip side, I've also had an email about a missing sample get ignored. It was a bit disappointing, but I knew the owners were going through some growing pains and I've had way more orders go right, so it didn't bother me too much.   Blackbird's known for great CS though, so I'm sure your issue would be resolved :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dwl4k,sparklebombs,21,Mon Jul 20 03:23:40 2015 UTC,The general rule of thumb is to look up the company name in the search to see if tons of people have encountered sketchiness. I've had good experiences with everyone I've bought from because I've made sure to avoid obvious scandals.

Off the top of my head I'd say:   Eccentric Cosmetics. Femme Fatale Cosmetics as you'd have access to a pretty big range of both products. Darling Girl Cosmetics   I can't really think of many more that offer both products? A lot of places just do eyeshadow. There is absolutely no shortage of companies that make eyeshadow and are good companies, lol. Also most indie eyeshadows are $1-2 to sample and $4-7 for a full size."

So far I have yet to have an unpleasant experience. Some of the things I've done before purchasing from a brand include:   searching this sub reddit to see if there are any recent issues (personally I kind of skim past issues if they occurred more than 3 years ago unless it was something extremely hazardous or unethical) google the brand plus ""customer service"" to see if there are any reviews that might indicate an issue google the specific shade I'm interested in to see a variety of pictures across different skin tones check the Facebook/Instagram/reddit account associated with the company. I don't expect a brand owner to have a super active presence, but a long period of inactivity online to me is a yellow flag. This mainly applies to companies that don't show up in my first three methods use PayPal. This is a personal preference, but you have the option to open a PayPal dispute in a worse case scenario.   Again, this is my method that I used when first discovering indies a few months ago. So far I've tried about 8 or so brands without any issues."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dvnfz,singinginthecar,32,Sun Jul 19 22:25:12 2015 UTC,"One thing on the packaging options: There are few for most small indie companies. Most people don't have the funds to purchase the 10,000 - 20,000 minimums from manufacturers in China/Taiwan for specialty packaging (estimate about .20-.50 per container plus freight costs for the cases, and it's easily a few thousand dollars) without taking out a business loan. Plus, a lot are downright flimsy, and indie owners usually have to request or purchase samples of containers to test from various companies to settle on one which works for their needs. Even if high volume quality packaging is possible, there are always going to be defective ones in the cases, usually not found out until they are filled or received by the buyer (I say this from experience - about 1 out of every 100 of our new mattes tubes has a hairline crack at the top)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dvnfz,Dorian_Gray_,3,Sun Jul 19 23:03:20 2015 UTC,That does make sense. Thank you for sharing that.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dvnfz,rekhiebaby,3,Sun Jul 19 23:08:19 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but were they shipped in a bubble envelope or a box? Maybe you could request shipping in a small cardboard box (small priority boxes are usually $5.25 in the US) for your next orders? I imagine most owners can accommodate this request.   I've been lucky and nothing I've bought so far has arrived broken. I have received defective lipstick/balm tubes and leaking shadow jars, but that's a different. Hope this gets resolved soon!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dvnfz,rekhiebaby,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:30:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm, they were all in envelopes! I wonder if that's why. I know that one of them admitted they were having some issues with their packaging that was happening to everyone, so I don't think that the envelope was the problem in that situation. With another item, the handle of the gloss tube cracked the second time I used it (it was never dropped and I'm not hard on my makeup). But that's something to consider for my next purchase, so thanks!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dvnfz,Ananda_Beauty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:33:01 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Sounds like faulty packaging then! Some indie brands have better packaging than others, particularly for lip products."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dvnfz,FelidarSovereign,2,Sun Jul 19 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"I've found lately (the past year) that the quality of packaging overall that I'm receiving has varied a tremendous amount in quality, like another owner mentioned, little cracks in more than just a few pieces, or I order 200 lip balm tubes and only get 180 lids! I'm not sure what's going on with suppliers, but there seems to be some issues with what is being made available to some of them.   This is definitely not an issue with every supplier, or with every type of packaging item, just to be clear, it's just happened more to me lately in this last year than in the 6 previous years ."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgf9,starward-,7,Sun Jul 19 07:57:57 2015 UTC,"..I don't even LIKE blue/purple lips, but these pictures have me contemplating my Alkahestry mini and that tube of clear gloss I never use.."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgf9,tangledThespian,2,Sun Jul 19 09:18:15 2015 UTC,Doooooo it!! And post the results here for all of us to enjoy :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgf9,tangledThespian,4,Sun Jul 19 09:22:15 2015 UTC,"Nah, you already did that! And as pretty as it is, I'd never wear it out.  ..I DO have quite a few reds and browns from Shiro, though.. And those lovely freebie samples I've never opened. Hm. This requires further thought."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgf9,tangledThespian,3,Sun Jul 19 09:27:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'd recommend using a baggie over a jar since it's way easier to just snip a corner and use it as like a funnel into the tube (does this make sense?) presuming you're using the whole baggy. IIRC, stuff with more oxides make for more opaque glosses which is why colours like Women's Weapons turn out so well! And I want to see the results either way, it's always fun looking at swatches on different people :D"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgf9,tangledThespian,3,Sun Jul 19 09:30:02 2015 UTC,"It makes sense, don't worry. XD I DO have Women's Weapons, if in mini size. How much product would you say you used for your gloss?  (Oh god, this is going to end with me running to Ulta for more gloss tubes, isn't it?)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgf9,toxidlotus,2,Sun Jul 19 09:53:59 2015 UTC,"I had used my sample before, but it was still quite full. I would recommend adding slowly, stirring, and then if you're happy with the colour you can stop. I think it's better to be safe than sorry cause you can always add more but you can remove it once it's in there.  (And probably. A lovely Redditor actually got me more clear gloss since it was on sale here and I couldn't find any at my local stores. Can't wait for our meetup when I can get my hands on them!)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgf9,sarkata,4,Sun Jul 19 09:57:11 2015 UTC,"So jam in color until I can't see through the tube any longer. Gotcha.  (Ah well. If I do go gloss happy, I'll do my best to document the results. Be warned: I can't take pictures to save my life.)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgf9,p_iynx,2,Sun Jul 19 10:00:05 2015 UTC,"Haha it's cool, my photos sucked too, but I couldn't resist sharing them with the sub :) I'm excited to see your combinations!!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgf9,p_iynx,4,Sun Jul 19 10:22:03 2015 UTC,So I am quite partial to Shiro's Alkahestry and decided to pour my sample into a clear gloss I had. It combined really well into the gloss and I'm really happy with the result. It worked out well because I'm impatient and so I didn't have to wait for international shipping and I won't lie it was also much cheaper than getting a custom gloss considering conversion and shipping. However this gloss formula isn't as good as the Shiro ones I have tried (though I certainly don't have an extensive collection or anything) and it feels somewhat gritty if I rub my lips together and settles into lip lines somewhat as soon as it's applied if I'm using it on it's own. All in all though I would definitely try this again (and actually am grabbing more clear glosses while they are on sale so I can have play with some other lip safe shadows!)  Editing to add something I forgot and to say I included the last two photos for completeness but they are copied over from my EC liquid matte swatch album so apologies if you have seen them before!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgf9,MissMamphs,3,Sun Jul 19 08:04:24 2015 UTC,Ugh this is so pretty. I think I'm gonna have to get this in a custom gloss eventually. It's so nice on its own and so pretty over everything else.

I took his joke literally and was pleasantly surprised with how it turned out. I have some Serious breakouts going on and it's hardly noticeable.

Indiemakeupandmore,3dtb31,Dorian_Gray_,19,Sun Jul 19 06:32:33 2015 UTC,"Looks great! That's quite a nice around the house look. :]  Have you gotten a chance to dabble in other colour cosmetics?  I'm just going to inject one thing: Neither the Zinc or Titanium are actually giving you any actual SPF. You'd have to apply it practically as thick as wall spackle to get any real sun protection, so be sure to still use sunscreen underneath. Zinc Oxide is still a great base ingredient, as it's not as ""chalky"" as TiO 2, and less of an opaque whitener."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtb31,toxidlotus,3,Sun Jul 19 06:42:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I did notice that Titanium Dioxide is chalky and can make blending slightly difficult, I'm still trying to figure out the best formula. I'll get it down soon tough. And, one of many goals I set for myself this year was to get better at my makeup application, so I actually wear make-up most everyday.. Quite a change from my two days tops. I didn't know that they wouldn't work as spf, darn.. I wonder how the do that with some powder foundations. Hmm.. I always wear sunscreen anyways, It's been integrated in with my face washing routine for years now. Thanks for your input! I'm learning so much."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtb31,eraser_dust,2,Sun Jul 19 07:08:59 2015 UTC,"Technically, the ratings for powder foundations are going by a very large amount of product, and assuming it covers thickly and evenly like a creme, which powders do not do. Some powder foundations may have chemical sunscreens in them as well, which offers slightly more reliable protection. Have fun!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgop,pondicus,13,Sun Jul 19 08:02:36 2015 UTC,"Today I wore Sixteen92 Mellifera. It doesn't get talked about much around these parts, but it was personally my first love from this brand. My 5.5ml bottle of the old formula is about halfway and I'm frantically trying to use it up, so I can get the 10ml rollerball in the new formula for easier application.  Notes are:   Wildflower Honey Accord (not vegan), Violet, Jasmine Sambac, Vanilla Infused Sugar, Sandalwood   I've never been a huge fan of violets, but in this combination, it gives it an odd freshness that I didn't quite expect amidst the creamy feel of all the other notes. And having it grounded by sandalwood also helps a lot."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgop,beautifulmess7,2,Sun Jul 19 08:23:53 2015 UTC,I have a sample of mellifera that I just got. I may have to try out today. Your description sounds lovely.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgop,pondicus,2,Sun Jul 19 13:40:34 2015 UTC,Definitely try it! I do hope it works as well for you as it has for me :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgop,beautifulmess7,5,Sun Jul 19 13:56:48 2015 UTC,"Okay, so for me I got honey in the face when wet. Seriously, I've never smelled a more true to life scent. That mellowed and faded into a creamy vanilla with some other quiet notes in the background. It's not quite candy, not quite floral, all creamy sweetness without being foody.  I'm not sure how to characterize this on my skin, but it's definitely pleasant and interesting."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dtgop,pondicus,3,Sun Jul 19 15:28:15 2015 UTC,"Yes! This is exactly what I love about Mellifera. It's got the sweetness of Black Sugar, but it's much more mellow and mature with the honey and the violets. Keeps it from being candy sweet.  I love hearing how scents feel on other people - thanks for sharing :)"

It starts out smelling like that sweet hazelnut, vanilla coffee, but it's drying down to a heavenly creamy vanilla coffee with a hint of nut. Yum.  I plan to try on a few Possets Summer scents today, to decide if I need to pick up any while she's having a sale. I was really surprised at how much I loved The Swing (The pinkest of pink creations. Raspberry and frothed vanilla milk, add a blush of peach and you are the toast of the court. Foody, frilly, sweet, and fabulous.), so I will retest  that one (sometimes I love scents one day and then on another day I'm like meh) and Summer (Mucha), Bikini Girls of Sicily, and probably Landscape in Suffolk. I've decided upon retesting that I don't need full sizes of early faves The Windmill (weird but good, I doubt I'd wear it that often) or Sunflowers (a lovely green honey scent, but I have enough honey scents so i don't need a full size)."

I used to watch a lot of Heidi of the Swiss Alps (the anime cartoon!) and whenever I had burnt bread, I  used to imagine myself as Heidi when she and her grandfather would toast their bread over a crackling fire at night).   So today, Tahitian Vanilla now completely reminds me of vanilla syrup, butter and an actual campfire, with a breeze that smells vaguely like coconut.

The florals are the typically heavier sort of florals that smells musky and velvety, but somehow, they're made light as if they were candied. The creamy base isn't plain vanilla and I can't seem to figure out what it is, maybe it's coconut.  After about 10 minutes, the florals got even lighter and smells like the lightest, powder dusting of florals. Mixed with the creaminess, it reminds me of lighter versions of Nanette Lepore scents.  When it starts drying down on me at about 50 min, I get mostly an old wood mixed with the kind of florals that reminds me of floral offerings in Hindu temples, mixed with a metallic sort of sweetness."

My standard is no animal testing at all, which means for me that brands that sell in China are out. But brands owned by larger brands that do test aren't-- I want to vote with my dollars, so showing parent companies that people will spend it specifically for cruelty free products is how I do that, and YMMV. It's really important to me.   Organic, not as much, but a nce bonus.  As far as PETA goes, a lot of people don't know how horrifically awful they are, partially because they were so good at marketing in the 90's and the 00's. The average Jane doesn't know that they run some of the highest kill ""shelters"" in the US. I would want to inform the brand, frankly, and see what they have to say about it. But part of that is wishful thinking for me-- buying CF can already be limiting for some products, and I want the ones I can buy from to be well informed."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dta0v,RhinestoneHousewife,14,Sun Jul 19 18:27:04 2015 UTC,"For me, only buying from brands in line with my own values is doubly important with indies. With an independent brand, typically a one person operation, I know that my money is going far more directly to that person and their associated causes, as opposed to being diffused throughout a corporation. I'd be making a conscious choice to directly support something I don't agree with.   In the end for me, values > pretties."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dta0v,solarcompany,11,Sun Jul 19 07:54:01 2015 UTC,"The beauty of indies is that there are so many options, you are sure to find a brand/owner that has very similar values to you.  I personally prefer Leaping Bunny over PETA, but I know people who strongly agree with the policies and actions of PETA. To them, I may not be doing enough in regards to animal cruelty. Conversely, I am strongly opposed to the sexualizing and objectification of women in the advertising used by PETA (in addition to their fairly ""radical"" stances on pet ownership, shelters, etc).  But then again, I know I've alienated some customers with high-level policy stances my brand has taken (my support of the Personal Care Product Safety Act, increased oversight in my industry, environmental regulations, etc) as well as the more ""nitty gritty"" business practices such as the percent of sales to microloans and environmental causes, B Corp certification and the like, my membership in the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics and EWG Skin Deep Database, etc.   While these are organizations, positions, and beliefs I strongly hold, you may not feel the same way.  With more and more companies adopting social causes and becoming more ""human"" by holding their own ""corporate beliefs"", it brings a whole new meaning to the ""vote with your wallet"" idea. Nowadays every transaction you make more than likely has a social or environmental impact, and depending on your viewpoints, that impact may be positive or negative.  Just as others in this thread say they would not purchase from a company that supports anti-LGBT groups, you have the freedom to not only chose not to support brands which fund causes you disagree with, you can also voice your concern like you are here!  Businesses, whether we like it or not, are focused on the bottom line - profit (unless they're a social business, in which they would focus on the triple bottom line - people planet, then profit, but I digress). So if you want them to adopt positive and beneficial policies and practices, vote with your wallet and tell them why you have cast your vote against their product/policies/beliefs.  It was consumer demand and popular movements that created the field of ""conscious capitalism"", and that very consumer demand is what will force more businesses to do good lest they be supplanted by a responsible competitor and subsequently be relegated to the history books."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dta0v,whollyhemp,7,Sun Jul 19 17:13:21 2015 UTC,"Ugh, PETA.....yeah, I won't support anyone who endorses them.  I would also pass on a company that was against LGBT rights."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dta0v,RhinestoneHousewife,4,Sun Jul 19 14:10:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of PETA because of the splinter groups that have killed puppies. I do love Leaping Bunny. I only buy cruelty free beauty products. I support Humane Society International, Leaping Bunny, & Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. I do think that some part of PETA tries to do good by maintaining a cruelty free brands list, but they also do a lot of bad.      ETA: Like mentioned below, it disturbs me that they think no one should have pets. I think it's better to talk about responsible pet ownership, getting your pets spayed / neutered / microchipped, adopting pets, and being good pet owners. Some pets would never be able to survive out in the wild. As an example, my standard poodle Phaedra has Addison's Disease. Because of her disease she would have died at about 2.5 years of age 'in the wild.' Because I take her to get a shot every 6 weeks, she's able to live a long and happy life.

That means that PETA has deemed their products ethical. Which is good, whatever your views of the organization is.   I'm vegan and really like animals. I'm not a huge fan of PETA because of how their marketing exploits women, but they've have an overall good effect on the well-being of animals and I respect that. I'll never give them my money, though, and prefer to support organizations like WSPA. I won't buy a product unless it's vegan and cruelty-free, because my makeup hobby isn't worth the suffering of animals."

I would never knowingly buy from a brand that supported PETA, and the fact they have that on their website at all makes me wonder about them; but being supported by PETA is not really something companies have control over and means they are cruelty-free, which I care about. It's not ideal, but it isn't nearly as bad."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dta0v,singinginthecar,2,Tue Jul 21 14:30:39 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends. I'm not sure what you have to do in order to be supported by PETA. Do you have to pay a fee or something? In that case, I wouldn't really want to use a brand that did that. If there was no exchange of money, then I wouldn't see it as a big deal.  I do prefer Leaping Bunny and I generally do my own research to see which brands are cruelty free. I couldn't give two shits whether a brand says it's organic or not because that usually means nothing."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dt9bn,h_p_bitchcraft,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:53:18 2015 UTC,":) Sadly not, I can't for the life of me make scented candles... It's too much of a money pit for me to get right as much as I'd like to correct my mistakes"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dt9bn,Abbygoat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I've been making bath bombs for a while, and any scents that are good but not bath-y enough (if that makes sense) typically go into candles. But they're jar candles and I already have the supplies, so it's not a money suck. I really love the way yours look though. I might have to branch into pillars soon, just for my own home use!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dt9bn,h_p_bitchcraft,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:25:49 2015 UTC,Pillar candles are awesome! It's a little tricky trying to get the wick centred but they're so worth the effort.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dt9bn,Abbygoat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:47:30 2015 UTC,Awesome! I'll have to give it a shot.

I've made some decent jar candles on girls weekends"". Then I saw your gorgeous artistic candles.

Indiemakeupandmore,3dt9bn,Riotbettyx,3,Sun Jul 19 18:46:05 2015 UTC,"Going off a suggestion I found here recently, I ordered from Copper & Kraft for the first time. I'm so happy that I did! I wanted to get some safer soy candles because the bf always gets onto me about traditional candles being bad for our cats. I checked out this shop because they have a great clearance section, so I didn't feel like I was investing a lot if I didn't like them and could sample more scents and sizes for less. I placed two orders a day apart and asked for combined shipping if possible. The shop owner replied almost immediately (even though it was like 2AM!) and not only combined shipping, but also refunded shipping overages and had my order shipped the next day. Everything arrived safely packaged, with samples and a coupon. The candles all smell wonderful and are true to their descriptions. While the products themselves are lovely, the quick TAT and wonderful customer service are what really sold me."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dso2a,ariadneee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:47:29 2015 UTC,"Absolutely :) np holding County Fair until tomorrow.  Here are my impressions of those Arcanas (I have half a blocked nose, so take these with a grain of salt!):  Velvet Underpinnings soft vanilla and creamy chocolate underneath a very realistic cracked pepper note. The pepper is definitely ""on top"" of everything else, and it fades away on the skin after a little while. The drydown is sweet without being cloying (tempered by the cocoa/spice from the pepper?).   Sthenno smells cozy and complex. It's sort of gourmand-y (I guess from the coconut) but it's not straight up food. The amber is warm rather than powdery or spicy."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dso2a,Stone_Conqueror,2,Sun Jul 19 07:34:15 2015 UTC,"Ooh thanks so much! For sure Sthenno then :) I am going to bed soon, but will pay/let you know about County Fair & VP tomorrow!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dsf4p,Abbygoat,16,Sun Jul 19 00:30:16 2015 UTC,"I prefer individual listings for products. Often I like to shop by opening a whole bunch of tabs and then closing them as a narrow down what I want. I do really like for there to be a master list of fragrances, though. Queen Bee Trading Co on Etsy is a good example of how I like things laid out (she has all her scents listed under ""policies"")."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dsf4p,TRexpert,4,Sun Jul 19 00:44:42 2015 UTC,"I was seriously just looking at her shop! I didn't catch that she put the master fragrance list in her policies, but that's really clever. I appreciate the input!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dsf4p,SCurry34,3,Sun Jul 19 00:48:58 2015 UTC,I do the same thing and close tabs to determine which to keep. And I agree that there should always be a master scent list! I copy paste them into word and delete the ones I don't like to narrow it down. :)

Indiemakeupandmore,3dsf4p,tightslacks,10,Sun Jul 19 01:32:34 2015 UTC,"Fragrance shopping is tough on Etsy, because there's no convenient place to stick your master list (and I neeeeed a master list). I say create a master list somewhere. Anywhere. Then link it in all your listings for easier viewing. Link it in your shop announcement as well! Make it easy for people to find.  Also, for more convenience: I like what PBSW does - they list all the notes in the title so that when you hover over the listing, it shows you what it says in the alt text. This allows me to easily glide over everything and see what I might possibly like without having to hoard tabs."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dsf4p,emmian,3,Sun Jul 19 01:50:38 2015 UTC,"Master list is 100% happening! Everyone has mentioned it, so I am on it :)  Forgive my ignorance, but what does PBSW stand for?

Indiemakeupandmore,3drtwg,smushmallow,3,Sat Jul 18 22:07:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed! It's definitely heavier on the green than the florals, but I still consider this the epitome of spring in a perfume!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3drtwg,justalittlejen,6,Sat Jul 18 23:05:56 2015 UTC,"If you can find it secondhand, BPAL's Passionate Shepherd to His Love is my quintessential ""springtime in a meadow"" perfume. It just smells like green clovers and newly blooming flowers and ugh it's so good. I actually wear it constantly during winter.  If you're into more floral-y florals, I also like Possets' Lavender Corset. It's super pretty- the lilac is the emphasis, and it's very fresh. The lavender joins in a little during dry down, but not too much.  OHWTO's Dandelion Wine is similar to Passionate Shepherd, but they're closed at the moment.  Paintbox Soapworks' Crickhollow Cottage is another I like, though it's less fresh and more perfume-y. Also, a seasonal release.  Edit ages later: Oh, if you like the smell of dirt, Haus of Gloi's Ploughman for sure. Very springy dirt scent, if that's even a thing."
Indiemakeupandmore,3drtwg,homicidalunicorns,6,Sat Jul 18 21:21:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess it depends on what spring smells like to you!   A lot of the Bastet's Garden at Nocturne Alchemy smell really fresh to me and Lilac Kobalt (lilac and vanilla orchid) is the first that comes to mind.   Lilacs always remind me of spring!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3drtwg,RhinestoneHousewife,2,Sat Jul 18 22:41:39 2015 UTC,I've been looking for a good lilac scent. The last one I picked up was really sweet and didn't smell like lilacs to me. Is it strong in Lilac Kobalt?
Indiemakeupandmore,3drtwg,smushmallow,3,Sat Jul 18 22:57:14 2015 UTC,Oh my gosh....it's the BEST lilac scent I've ever tried.  It's like laying underneath a lilac bush in spring.
Indiemakeupandmore,3drtwg,RhinestoneHousewife,2,Sat Jul 18 22:59:27 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh, that sounds heavenly. I'm ridiculously excited right now. Thanks! =D"
Indiemakeupandmore,3drtwg,smushmallow,2,Sat Jul 18 23:23:28 2015 UTC,Oh I've been dying to find a realistic lilac note. The most perfect spring smell EVER.
Indiemakeupandmore,3drtwg,blueskiesandsun,3,Sat Jul 18 23:32:57 2015 UTC,"Omg you need to try Possets Lavender Corset. It's almost entirely fresh lilac, with just a hint of lavender under that."

BPAL Endymion is also a go to for me, and it is predominantly rose, pear, and white musk. Super refreshing. Another one I would try if you can find it is BPAL Venus Verticordia (Fickle dandelion florets dancing through honey-drenched wildflowers) which is such a beautiful fresh wildflower kind of scent. It is sweet and fluttery and strangely nostalgic. It came out earlier this year in their Lupercalia collection which is why it might be a touch difficult to find!  ALSO, I'd keep an eye out for reviews of the new Summer Elegance collection from Possets. I've yet to test anything thoroughly, but a lot of those literally scream spring to me!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,blueskiesandsun,7,Sat Jul 18 14:44:57 2015 UTC,"I will do! I did want to be a part of the town hall but real life got in the way, just glad it's, returning"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,karasunflower,2,Sat Jul 18 14:47:57 2015 UTC,It brought me back to this sub (actively)!  I decided to pop back in and saw the thread.  It got me excited about indie perfumes again since thats pretty much the only indie area I shop in.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,sea-weed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:29:14 2015 UTC,Preach
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,sea-weed,8,Mon Jul 20 14:21:41 2015 UTC,"Good stuff, thanks for your hard work guys!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,starward-,4,Sat Jul 18 13:06:59 2015 UTC,Thank you for the support!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,sea-weed,6,Sat Jul 18 14:07:55 2015 UTC,This is great. Thank you for making this post so easy to read :). I'm excited to see how these changes will affect IMAM
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,starward-,5,Sat Jul 18 13:21:34 2015 UTC,"I'm glad it's easy to read, especially with all the information on there! We're all excited for the changes as well and look forward to see how they'll benefit the sub. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,sea-weed,7,Sat Jul 18 13:48:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing all the interesting data from Town Hall and addressing everyone's concerns.   I still think you guys are doing a kickass job.  :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,starward-,6,Sat Jul 18 15:39:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Your kind words really mean a lot to us. :)    And data is awesome! At one point, we were thinking of having charts and whatnot, but that might've been a bit too much lol."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,mjolnir_mooncup,7,Sat Jul 18 15:58:42 2015 UTC,"Nah, charts are always cool!  :D"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,a_wild_dena_appears,5,Sat Jul 18 16:03:37 2015 UTC,Aren't they??? It would've been kinda funny seeing pie charts or bar graphs. XD
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,benoit_balls,4,Sat Jul 18 18:13:08 2015 UTC,"CHARTS!!  I just made some quick ones for fun. Charts are cool! (Sorry they're just in a google doc because I seriously cbf with imgur right now, my internet connection is a bit messed up and imgur is soooooooo slow)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,seashells_15,2,Sun Jul 19 11:43:16 2015 UTC,"Oh man, they're simple but beautiful!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,seashells_15,2,Sun Jul 19 12:30:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry they were quite basic, though maybe for the next town hall I will put up some swanky graphs. Actually how cool would gif graphs be? The kind that are animated to increase when you open them (does what I'm saying make sense? I'm sure there's a word for this but it escapes me right now). Sorry not sorry I'm spamming you with graph talk :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,daisyismydog,2,Sun Jul 19 12:43:15 2015 UTC,That would be so cool!  Plus since you guys will be holding Town Hall every couple of months it'll be interesting to hear how the data changes over time.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,smushmallow,3,Sun Jul 19 13:03:06 2015 UTC,"Good point - we have all the data saved from this one so we can definitely do some comparisons, thank you for the great suggestion!"

We'd much rather hear concerns directly rather than users feeling upset or participating less because they didn't like a recent change :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,Carlyscat,12,Sun Jul 19 00:40:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the change in the brand owner rules! I really like the 3 week span, as owner life can mean I have nothing to do one week, and working 14 hour days the next. This is the perfect medium :)"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,NorthwestTreeOctopus,5,Mon Jul 20 02:34:14 2015 UTC,"Awesome feedback, thanks team! Way to tackle concerns about communication head on with a detailed and comprehensive post :)  I'm curious to know how the product specific flair tags will interact with the disclosure flair tags? Are the existing flairs getting scrapped to accommodate the change?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,wakenda,7,Sat Jul 18 16:01:11 2015 UTC,still a work in progress but we're working with the idea of having disclosure for every type of product. we'll have to see how it looks and if the list is too long we may change it.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,bambikai,4,Sat Jul 18 16:07:21 2015 UTC,"Cool, I'll look forward to seeing what you come up with :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dq9v8,imamelf,9,Sat Jul 18 16:19:33 2015 UTC,I think these changes are great and I appreciate the explanations behind the decisions. Thanks for this follow-up post!

I have and love Isabella, and everything I hear about rose mallow cream sounds amazing, but just like Isabella to me. They have very different sets of notes though, so I'm really curious to see how they compare!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ds3q7,lisaplusplus,3,Sun Jul 19 20:55:01 2015 UTC,Rose Mallow Cream is more foodie and sweet. Isabella is more musky and a bit lighter (I think the tea freshens it up).

Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,a_wild_dena_appears,9,Sat Jul 18 17:33:30 2015 UTC,I'm gonna say Hello Waffle The White Queen eyeshadow.  I already know it looks beautiful on eyes but I think it'd be pretty cool on the cheeks and lips too and would make for a pretty ethereal monochromatic look!   Otherwise maybe Darling Girl Tartlette blush.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,sea-weed,2,Sat Jul 18 18:18:01 2015 UTC,I think that would be really awesome!! Perfect for winter time!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,sea-weed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:31:48 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking too!  Very ice princess.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,BreeAZ,8,Sun Jul 19 12:35:57 2015 UTC,"I read this question and immediately made a  ""Pifffffff"" sound with my lips while looking at my collection. It would be a tie between FF's Candied Apple, or Shiro's Doge.   I feel like Candied Apple will be a better blush, but Doge would be a better highlight. Hard question, I like it!   *On second thought Candied Apple all the way; brows, eyelashes, blush, lips and eyes."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,SirWaffalot,15,Sat Jul 18 17:55:52 2015 UTC,"This is horribly biased but I would use June Bug all over. It looks good as a gloss and a blush and it started out as an eyeshadow haha.   For other brands, maybe Positively Peachy by DG? It was a GWP but it's a lovely light peach colour. Or Perspecto Illusion from Femme Fatale. That would make the most gorgeous face highlight."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,why_42,5,Sat Jul 18 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"Dawn Eye's Mossy Mauve. It's complex applied wet or over sticky primer on the eyes, and it looks great as a lip tint and a blush. I already use it as a blush so often that I'm planning on getting an extra jar so I can mix it in with some transparent powder so it's easier to use."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,PhyrraNyx,5,Sat Jul 18 18:42:01 2015 UTC,"I would try using Notoriously Morbid Osteomancy - I'd put it on my cheekbones, eyes, and mix with a lip balm for my lips. I'd mix in a tiny bit with a foundation to give it a luminescence."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,badluckbelle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:23:07 2015 UTC,I love the idea of adding it to your foundation! I might have to try that just for fun!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,badbluemoon,5,Sat Jul 18 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"Shiro Little Bird. I would use it for definition on my crease, as a blush, and as a gloss. I have the gloss and wore it today, actually.   Another option would be Shiro's Women's Weapons, which I would use as a liner, gloss, and maybe, if applied very lightly, blush."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,homicidalunicorns,4,Sat Jul 18 20:05:50 2015 UTC,Shiro Punch Punch Pork.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,wcatie,3,Sat Jul 18 20:19:39 2015 UTC,"Blackbird Juliet. It's a bomb eyeshadow, it would be a great blush, and it'd probably be a super sweet lipstick, too.  ...man, I should try it as a blush some day."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,Flewtea,2,Sat Jul 18 21:25:18 2015 UTC,"Just confirming that Juliet is an AMAZING blush and lip color, I use it all over as a one look pretty frequently! Definitely give it a try.   I also do this with Vintage too :x Also pretty amazing all over but you definitely need a light hand applying it as a blush!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,chupacabratwist,3,Mon Jul 20 23:56:26 2015 UTC,Blackbird Fire Pledge. I definitely could use it as blush an eyeshadow and I bet I could use it lightly as a lip color too.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,infamousjoe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:02:38 2015 UTC,"I LOVE fire pledge, I bet it would make an awesome lip color!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,Laurensics,2,Sat Jul 18 23:28:14 2015 UTC,"I found that Blackbird Gravity worked pretty well as a lipcolor, blush and eyeshadow and it would perhaps be dark enough to foil and wear as an eyeliner."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,CiaoBonefish,2,Sat Jul 18 22:22:03 2015 UTC,"This actually got me thinking really really hard!  I'd rather go for a more wearable lip color, so I'd choose Notoriously Morbid's Palmistry blush, which is a matte red.  It can make a great lip color, blush, and I can probably swing it as eyeshadow too."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dr4vn,Costumiere77,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:31:57 2015 UTC,"Shiro Women's Weapons, it's a gorgeous blush, lip gloss, and eyeliner. It's a really dramatic look though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,Ttypo,3,Sat Jul 18 07:00:42 2015 UTC,"Do you find any issues with them going on patchy? I use them over UDPP and I love the colours and the matte finish is gorgeous, but I can't get them to apply nicely most of the time."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,lilaregenbogen,3,Sat Jul 18 15:22:36 2015 UTC,"I've never really had any experience using primers so I can't really say. I used to have the Lorac Behind the scenes eye primer (that came with my lorac pro palette) but avoided using it because I felt like it caused my eyshadows to become patchy.   Maybe give the eyeshadows a try without primer? I've never had a problem with blending BB eyeshadows on bare skin! I moisturise my eyelids with an eye cream and let it settle for a while before applying any eyeshadow. If your eyes are still ""wet"" in any way due to any products on your lids you will get patches so make sure you allow it some time to ""sink in""."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,Flewtea,2,Sat Jul 18 15:37:18 2015 UTC,I have the same issues. What I've mostly settled on is dusting just a tiny bit of color all over then going back over it. I think the patchiness comes from the same thing that makes them so long lasting--they're kinda sticky. When I first mentioned this problem someone else (speak up if it was you!) mentioned dusting a bit of shimmery color over the top to cover the unevenness. It works and looks great but of course isn't matte anymore.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,LILY_LALA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:56:21 2015 UTC,"Seconding the ""try without primer"" idea. That's how I always use these."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,PhyrraNyx,3,Sat Jul 18 22:33:52 2015 UTC,This just makes me anxious for my order to get here :) Thanks for the swatches.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,uponaworld,3,Sat Jul 18 19:37:01 2015 UTC,This is such a gorgeous photo that shows off these shades magnificently. I've been on a low/no buy for awhile but I'm planning on getting some blackbird as soon as I'm off it :))
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,celeryxstalker,3,Sat Jul 18 22:35:57 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I've been wanting to try these for so long! The pigmentation looks incredible. How do you find the blendability with these? Some of my pigmented mattes are a little hard to blend :/ Edit: Also, are these loose or pressed? Thanks for the swatches (:"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,THE_DINOSAUR_QUEEN,2,Sat Jul 18 23:22:21 2015 UTC,I've never had any trouble with blending these eyeshadows :) they blend like a dream for me! That being said I don't use primer so can't really comment on the blendability (is that word? Haha) of them with primer. Honestly I don't feel like they need a primer as they are lovely just on bare skin!  I have them all in pressed form as they're really easy to carry around in my magnetic palette I got from Book of Shadows on etsy :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,karasunflower,2,Sun Jul 19 02:11:07 2015 UTC,"So pretty, and they all look super wearable. Some of the colors I have I love but barely ever use--I can see all of these having a place in an everyday look."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,CorvusCorset,2,Sat Jul 18 13:17:42 2015 UTC,Lucid looks so pigmented :) especially since these swatches are no primer.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,karasunflower,2,Sat Jul 18 13:24:35 2015 UTC,I found Lucid to not be very pigmented when applied. Not really black either
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,Ximmyy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:08:13 2015 UTC,It is really pigmented! And surprisingly easy to work with even though its a matte :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dps32,toxidlotus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:29:26 2015 UTC,That is good to know. I've heard that Blackbird mattes blend nicely.

Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,princess-ismya,7,Fri Jul 17 20:19:37 2015 UTC,"Whoaaa I was wondering if the site wasn't doing them justice, your swatches are beautiful! The collection theme is vague, but I feel like Shiro might be trying to tiptoe around trademark issues, which I've felt vaguely concerned about (for indies) in the past so that's a good thing I guess."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,birbvice,14,Sat Jul 18 01:30:15 2015 UTC,"Caitlin was sweet enough to send me some samples of her newest collection to try out ahead of the release. I do want to be transparent and let everyone know I did NOT pay for these but all she asked was that I test them out for her. I will be doing a more in-depth review along with some eye-swatches to be posted next week, but here's the quick opinion.  Over-all I loved it. A few of them, like Eeeny, Meeny were a little patchy but buffed out beautifully (over a sticky primer) into metallic-like duochromes as you can see in the photo. Come Play With Me, had similar problems and reminded me of ""No Men"" in that it ended up with a metallic ring around the outside and a slightly matte center if you patted it on. Again, if you buff it, it becomes smooth and something else entirely.   That said, most of them were very easy to work with. I loved the range of colors and the trade-mark opacity and saturation that has made me a fan of Shiro's work since I first found her over a year ago. I found many colors in this collection to have some of the most chameleon-like qualities I've ever seen in Shiro's eyeshadows."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,sunzilla,2,Fri Jul 17 23:58:57 2015 UTC,"I've always found that make-up is so difficult to judge from photographs. I don't think I did the eyeshadows justice but I'm glad you enjoyed them and I'm glad I was able to give a second perspective to the site photos.   I always think Shiro's make-up is so much prettier IRL than in photographs. The same is true most good indie brands, though. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,girlbyseaside,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:30:13 2015 UTC,Gotta take a look at the rest of your blog and check out your lovely swatches. My only regret is I stay away from Femme Fatale due to being in the U.S. and those shipping costs! Your camera appears to capture their duochromes so well! ;-;  I adore your candied apple look.

Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,GlaDos00,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:09 2015 UTC,What brushes or tools do you use to buff the shadows over PE like that?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,emilypandemonium,4,Sat Jul 18 00:06:10 2015 UTC,I usually do the application with my fingers unless I'm doing detail work.  For buffing I'll use a brush that is wider with flat sides like either of the two large brushes on the right from this set: http://www.sephora.com/smoke-machine-smokey-eye-brush-set-P377122?skuId=1469386  For my eyes I will sometimes use the Sonia Kashuk c7 brush if I need something a bit smaller. There are smaller ones out there too for detail work.   I sometimes alternate between using the brush tip to buff and the side of the brush to do a smear-pat until I get the sheen right.   A couple of tips. Wait for the sticky primer to dry before you start buffing. Make sure you've applied an even layer of the shadow and patted it all into place before hand too.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,Fluffcats,3,Sat Jul 18 00:24:57 2015 UTC,I am very intrigued by buffing as well. Thank you for the more detailed description of your process. I have never tried this technique but I definitely will be tonight.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,kazaanabanana,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"I just figured it out myself as I was playing around with some eyeshadows. It doesn't work on all eyeshadows. I tried it on Toadstool, for example, and it really didn't do anything magical. I think it depends on what type of mica is used."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,CiaoBonefish,2,Mon Jul 20 01:24:04 2015 UTC,I was curious about this too. Thanks for the tips and swatches!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,noribun,2,Sat Jul 18 01:00:58 2015 UTC,"I'm slightly confused by the buffing... So you pat the shadow down firmly and then do you swipe a brush across it to get the sheen? Or is it more circle motions? I don't know why, but I'm having a hard time picturing this in my head. lol"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,pruplecat,2,Sat Jul 18 03:58:42 2015 UTC,"I pat everything into place to get it to stick evenly to the primer. Then, you can do circles or back and forth buffing. Whatever works for the area you're working in. If you've ever polished a shoe, it is similar only you're using a smaller brush and you're buffing way more gently so you don't hurt your skin.   Give try it out on your arm a few times with FPE and see what works for you. It might work with other sticky primers but I haven't tried with anything other than Pixy Epoxy."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,SpinelessLaugh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:25:29 2015 UTC,"Ahh, this makes much more sense to my little brain. lol I don't have and PE, but I do have another glitter glue I can try it on. Thank you for your help! :3"

Come Play With Me is very pretty, too, though it sounds a little tricky to apply.  What are your favorite shadows from this collection?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dnwbm,frumperbell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:39:56 2015 UTC,"Goodness, I like so many of them. Personally, Ha, Ha... is one of my favorites but I love a mustard-gold. It is very pigmented and smooth and would probably work great over almost any primer. Very easy to work with.  I really do love ""come play with me buffed"". It is a bit trickier but is so pretty once you get that gold to shine and it casts this blue-green-grey undertone. It reminds me of sunlight on seafoam-green waves. I keep getting images of the really old anime version of the little mermaid from the 70's or 80's.  I haven't tried it on my eyes yet, it may clash with my coloring but I'm keeping my fingers crossed it doesn't do weird things to my complexion because it is so darn pretty.   Honestly, I like them all but ask me again after I post some of the eye-swatches later next week. Sometimes what I love on my arm doesn't always work on my face."

Both are quite sheer, though Dream Orchid is more sheer than Witchberry.  Dream Orchid gives a more subtle dewy look.  Witchberry gives a bit more shimmery of a finish (though not super sparkly).  Also, the Dream Orchid sifter does not leak like crazy... I just added a sample size to a full size jar and didn't feel like popping out the sifter. :P"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dpw38,ariadneee,3,Sat Jul 18 08:59:11 2015 UTC,Has anyone tried Lyra from the Arcana Summer Constellations collection? I've only found a couple of short reviews and I want to hear some more opinions!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dpw38,ribbonprincess,3,Sat Jul 18 09:05:49 2015 UTC,I've tried all except Lacerta and Piscis Australis. Which would you like reviewed?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dpw38,ariadneee,2,Sat Jul 18 12:48:20 2015 UTC,"I'd love to hear what you think about Cygnus, Lyra and Ophiuchus :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dpw38,ribbonprincess,6,Sat Jul 18 12:57:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sure!   Cygnus is all roses on me- from beginning to end. Very lovely roses, maybe a tad sweet from the frosting, but I mostly just get rose. It hugs pretty close to my skin- which makes it a nice, wearable rose floral, in my opinion. I might try layering it with Arcana's yellow cake oil to get more of the smell I was hoping for from it.   Ophiuchus I don't have much to say about except that all I get from it is patchouli. My skin amps  it and I can't stand the smell and I barely put any of this on and all I could smell was patchouli until the next morning (put it on before bed). It might be lovely on people who handle patchouli better though.   Lyra is really hard for me to describe, but it's absolutely lovely. There's some non-gourmand-y sweetness in there from the vanilla. A coolness and smokiness from the woods and oudh. A little bit of muskiness too. When I put it on, I definitely smell like I'm wearing perfume rather than, say, smelling like apples or something. It reminds me a lot of sixteen92's Paper Moon or Talia if you've tried either of those.   And just for the hell of it, I'll include the two other I've tried because I like them a lot!  Draco when you open the bottle is strait up crisp, freshly cut up apples. On my skin the cognac comes out a little bit to add some depth to it, without really smelling to strongly of actual cognac. I get maybe a little tea from it, but not much. Mostly I just a lot of apple, which seems to be grounded well by the other elements to keep it from getting too sweet. I think it's way more of a fall scent.  Delphinus is  my favorite in the collection. It starts out as a sweet, peachy-lime scent that is super bright and perfect for summer. Then magically it morphs to smell exactly like vanilla ice cream, maybe with a touch of coconut in there. My skin loves vanilla and will happily turn anything it can into vanilla, so it may stay more coconut-y on other people. But it's just such a fun, summer scent."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dpw38,AliceInPlunderland,2,Sat Jul 18 13:23:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this! I hope I didn't choose wrong though- I totally blind-ordered Cygnus hoping for rose-infused cupcakes/soft rose frosting, but now I'm wondering if I should have snagged Delphinus instead! Either way, thanks again for the awesome mini-reviews! <3"

You've absolutely confirmed I need Lyra, and as a crazy patchouli lover I want to see how Ophiuchus goes on my skin. Delphinus wasn't on my radar before your review, but it sounds so gorgeous I think I need to track down a decant to test out. Thank you again!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dpw38,ashlya,3,Sat Jul 18 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"Lyra... is interesting. Wet, it smells like cough syrup, while my fiance said that it smells like an energy drink (ex. Red Bull). Upon my skin, the cough syrup smell dies down and it transforms and becomes a bit more of a sweet woody floral, if that makes sense. My skin unfortunately amps up sweet scents, so it got a bit too sweet for me. :x"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dpw38,ariadneee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:11:33 2015 UTC,Oh you make Lyra sound very intriguing! I love how much scents are influence by skin chemistry. Did you try any others from the collection? What's your favourite?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dpw38,blueskiesandsun,3,Sat Jul 18 23:20:47 2015 UTC,"I have Oph and Lyra.  Lyra is veeeeeryyyy oudh-y on me, to the point that I couldn't get anything else out of it. It reminded me of DC Tyto in that way. I swatched it, and eventually scrubbed it, and it was still very obvious to my nose, so 10/10 for longevity!   Ophiuchus is my soulmate scent, and I actually bought a back up bottle. It's creamy and sweet in a not-food way, with almost a peach-like note. It makes me think of sitting on a front porch in Georgia sipping sweet tea as the sun goes down. Lovelovelove."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dpw38,ariadneee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:20:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your impressions :) I think I like oudh - I had Tyto and I enjoyed it, but I swapped it away because it had no longevity on my skin.

I don't have swatches but I can take some pictures tomorrow and do a test run for all that stuff if you'd like. However from memory it's  moderately opaque once you get through the oil and I would say maybe light brick. I usually wear it with liner and blotted but if you want it heavy a lip brush is necessary and it definitely transfers.

Indiemakeupandmore,3dp20h,beautifulmess7,2,Sat Jul 18 02:16:53 2015 UTC,I need some wine!  Glad you enjoyed your Friday night.   I'm waiting on my Christmas in July box from AFK. It will be my first order from them. I also have an order in to Ajevie's July Go and Summer Simplicity circles.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dp20h,Missyypoo,13,Sun Jul 19 00:16:09 2015 UTC,"I am waiting on orders from Shiro and Fyrinnae.... Nothing huge, but they're my first indie purchases, so Im pretty excited!! :)"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dp20h,amaijala9792,10,Sat Jul 18 04:07:25 2015 UTC,"Guys, I have so much stuff coming... My AFK Summer box shipped yesterday, along with my Ten Three and Black Violet perfumes. I also have Baroque and Femme Fatale orders that will get here eventually and samples of all of the Sixteen92 birthday scents + Black Sugar. And now I'm really tempted to make a CYO order from  Fortune Cookie Soap because I know I like their lotion formula and I have some good scent blend ideas.  The Perfect Breakfast (trying to think of a better name for this one, if anyone has any suggestions)   50% Buttermilk Pancake 25% Marshmallow 25% Coffee   Mermaid Laundry   50% Sally (one of their discontinued scents that I absolutely adore, a very nice lightly sweet clean cotton-y scent) 35% Aloha Vanilla (mango, vanilla, coconut, lotus) 15% Sea Kelp (salty ozone, watery greens, white musk, vetiver) this one might end up being changed   But I really probably shouldn't get them... but I want them...  Edit: I'm especially excited about my AFK box because I somehow decided to get a full size and I can't wait to see what's in it. I've seen two spoilers so far and I hope I can keep the rest of it a secret from myself because surprises are fun. I'm also quite excited to add to my Baroque blushes and finally get to try FF and smell like cake."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dp20h,Star_Gazer04,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:49:43 2015 UTC,"I thik Perfect Breakfast sounds great!  Maybe ask to make sure that the pancake scent has a bit of saltiness to it too, would you add maple to that as well, or just stick with marshmallow?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dp20h,amaijala9792,2,Sat Jul 18 02:55:51 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the pancake blend already has maple syrup in it :)

Indiemakeupandmore,3dp20h,kazaanabanana,9,Sun Jul 19 02:39:42 2015 UTC,"I've been naughty lately.    Sixteen92   Ordered about 6 hours after the anniversary scents went up and the only one I wanted wasn't even listed on the site anymore. Lame. I ended up getting full sizes of Eternal Return, Paper Moon, and Theda, along with mini lotions in coconut custard and the peach sorbet scents. Also grabbed a hair detangler in Paper Moon.   Hello Waffle   Totally an impulse purchase although I'd been sleeping on a couple of the items for a while. Grabbed halflings of June Bug, Lavender Cream, and Likes Matte(r) along with a Midna sample and GINGER KITTIES   Shiro   Of course I had to order from the launch today. In addition to ordering a full size of the setting powder, I picked up Cage Free Turkey (AHHHHH) and samples of Come Play With Me, Eeny, Meeny, Miney, BURN!, Let's Use ALL the Colors!, Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha., and My Mind's Telling Me No.    Fyrinnae   Last impulse purchase of the day since I saw that Kitten was in stock. I also got a full size of It Beautifies! along with samples of Confidence and Zanzibar."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dp20h,themakeuplife,3,Sat Jul 18 03:19:06 2015 UTC,Yay It Beautifies is one of my Fyrinnae favorites. The formula is perfection.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dp20h,cooltrainersarah,3,Sat Jul 18 03:24:49 2015 UTC,I received it as a free sample in a previous order and I was hooooooked. It doesn't even need PE to just glow and application is so smooth.  You obviously already know this but I just have a lot of feelings about this eyeshadow.

Sixteen92: A summer sample set, a GC sample set (Black Sugar, La Llorona, Hellebore, Grimm, and Salem), a FS of The Awakening because I love the lotion I have in it, and samples of The Afterparty and The Masquerade Party.

Alkemia was having a close-out sale of some items with damaged labels, so I bought a Whoops! bottle of Caveau des Innocents. Also did the 3 for $30 deal and got Sandscape, Sun Dried Laundry in a Summer Rain, and a brand new limited Edition featuring 18 types of ginger, Asarum. Can't wait to try that one!"

I'm still thinking about Sixteen92's birthday collection. I really want to snag a lotion, but there's no more in stock for the scent I want. Not sure if I should take advantage of the 20% off discount now, or wait until it goes back into stock.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. Knowing me, I'd probably end up getting nothing."

Cafe Mallowmel was also a disappointment on me...it seemed like a no-brainer bc I love coffee, and SS can basically do no wrong. But yeah I get a weird ""fresh air"" scent mixed with the initial milky coffee, then it turns to mostly a weird fresh air/ozone mixed with total melted plastic. I wish it weren't so for both of us :("

I would caution that when looking at swatches, look for several different places.   There are quite a few bloggers that always seem to get absolute perfect results and it can be frustrating when the polish doesn't look like that when you get it.   Other than that, there is a Facebook group for reddit polish girls, and there are several indie polish Facebook groups where you can buy and trade or get news on what's coming up!!  If there are any weird question, pm me!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3douoq,sihaya09,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:32:11 2015 UTC,"My favorite base coat is actually the Rainbow Honey All Your Base. My favorite top coat is GlitterDaze Super Smooth Top Coat. KBShimmer's base and top coat are pretty nice too.      I will say that base coats and top coats seem to be one of those things that one will work REALLY well for someone and won't work well at all for another.       Zoya Remove is a great prep for the nail before you paint - just wipe your nails down with it and it will remove any oils and make your nails ready for gorgeousness.      There are so many great nail polish brands out there that my local friends here were like 'but where do you even begin?' You can find even more listed at places like Llarowe (where I've ordered from many times). If you want amazing swatches, my friend Lisa's blog Cosmetic Sanctuary has a ton."

I find that cinnamon tends to be the culprit in most cases. And necks seem to be the most sensitive spot...my friend never had a cinnamon reaction until she tried a cinnamon conditioner, which made her neck start burning up and exploding in red blotches. Same case as you –the rest of her body's fine, it's just her neck that's having a reaction.  Thanks for the review btw!"

I wasn't personally a fan of that trend (liked my Sauv Blanc's without that note).    This happened about the same time Chardonnays and many wood aged reds were so oaky it was like drinking lumber in a glass.  Not real sure this is common now."

My scent memory of ""fireworks"" may be really different from many other people since in a past life I used to work with the big stuff (cannons, squibs, etc).    The melon note disappeared pretty quickly on me. Which made me kinda sad, since it was a really nice note.  I have a feeling that on a different day, this scent is going to behave very differently.  It was quite a morpher on this wearing.  Hope this helps."

Also used a Detrivore blush.   And because I really miss being at the ocean and diving this summer... Layered Firebird Saltwater with Black Violet Sea Goddess."

I used Fyrinnae Nordic Angel for my blush (forever and always) and Blackbird magic powder in green. Lastly for my perfume I layered Arcana Cygus with Smelly Yeti Broody Guy because while I love Cygus wet it gets sort of powdery after a while and I thought cake might help.

I love it, it smells like a warm cup of chai next to a crackling bonfire, after a whole day spent baking birthday cakes.  I know it doesn't sound like a typical summer fragrance, but for me I have a lot of family birthdays in June, and we've spent many nights celebrating them around beach bonfires with a warm drink and a bit of cake."
Indiemakeupandmore,3douyf,fairyrebel,2,Sat Jul 18 06:38:25 2015 UTC,"Spice scents mingle really well with creamier gourmands, I've found. Another spice scent I love to layer with is Sycamore Chai from Solstice Scents!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3douyf,lgbtqbbq,4,Sat Jul 18 20:39:46 2015 UTC,"I love layering to get extra mileage from my scents. :) Some of my favorites are:  Sixteen92 Southern Gothic + Alkemia Midnight Garden - Heady heavenly summery scent with a lot of white floral.   BPAL Shub-Niggurath + BPAL Dorian - Gingerbread and creamy sweet vanilla.  Arcana Fanning the Fur + BPAL Snake Oil - Hard to describe. Sweet but kind of incensey. Almonds, dark vanilla, coconut milk, whiskey, spices, lots of woody balsam.  Alkemia Patchouli Cacao + BPAL Port-au-Prince - Dark cocoa and spiced rum. Boozy chocolate, 10/10 do try.  Sixteen92 Hellebore + Sixteen92 Grimm - Grimm pulls out the earthy, dark qualities of Hellebore. To go in the opposite direction, I add a drop of Alkemia Midnight Garden to Hellebore, to bump up the white floral."

Indiemakeupandmore,3douyf,Absinthe42,3,Sun Jul 19 02:31:29 2015 UTC,"Layering combos I've liked recently:   Arcana Apples Crave Vanilla + Nocturne Alchemy Egyptian Musk- I like combining two delicate perfumes because then they don't get lost in each other. Egyptian Musk adds something a little extra to the almost silvery Arcana. I feel like it warms it up and also makes it last longer. Nocturne Alchemy Green Tea Crimson + Solstice Scents Chiffon- This green tea is bright and a little tart, so Chiffon smooths it out with the marshmallow/cream notes and gives it a silkier feel. Alchemic Muse Chiquita + Alchemic Muse Nightshade- awesome combo of sweet desserty banana and powdered sugar/lavender. Alchemic Muse Loukoum + SS Astral Temple- The amber and vanilla in Astral Temple helps mitigate the initial sharpness of Loukoum, which comes from the lemon and mint. Smells like an even more pillowy/powdered sugar marshmallow when compared to the original alone (Loukoum alone smells first like lemon mint rose, then fades to slightly herbal rose jelly)   I have a lot of single note oils from fragrance oil suppliers (from a months-long foray into mixing my own oils, which got shunted aside for work and personal reasons) so I've been layering single notes with my normal indie blends.  Favorites so far:   Blood Orange (single note) + Solstice Scents Attic- this yields a striking orange cedar scent. The sharpness of the cedar in Attic is both complemented and smoothed out by the tart juicy Blood Orange.  Sassafras (single note) + Nocturne Alchemy Pyramid Vanille- like a creamy spicy, slightly earthy and not entirely foodie root beer float. This sassafras note is less syrupy, more root-y, like birch beer or old skool sassafras soda. Blood Orange + SS Astral Temple- another great success with the blood orange note. Astral Temple's orange note is like dusty dried orange peel on me, so this adds a fresh layer that I enjoy. Strawberry Jam (single note) + SS Blossom Jam Teacakes- to me the jam in BJT is very dark, like raspberry or blackberry. The strawberry jam note I have is brightier, more candied, and strongly strawberry. Like Smuckers jelly. The combo is a little smoother and less ""dark"" than the original BJT, maybe a touch brighter."

They're great when I'm too lazy to do a complicated eye look and they're great as a base under my loose shadows.  Most of the time I use Matte Brown as my base.

I keep the two together in my collection since they go so well together. They both have this hydrated look to them that I just love and the taupe makes the look come out very natural. I've tried other taupes, but I just prefer this particular tone on me along with the finish that it has.  I also use my Physician's Formula Matte Quads for when I'm playing around with new colors. They have cool (Quartz Quartet), neutral (Canyon Classics), and warm (Classic Nudes) palettes so no matter what kind of look I'm going for, it's really easy for me to find a matte crease and highlight shade that will go with it. Really helps me figure out new eye looks."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dnox6,karasunflower,2,Sat Jul 18 03:35:00 2015 UTC,I love wearing Haus of Gloi's Imp with Marc Jacobs Daisy Dream -- I love fruit scents and they work really well together. 8)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dn81k,lizziejo82,16,Fri Jul 17 17:19:35 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say, because it varies a lot from blend to blend-- an orange perfume from the most long-lasting place won't last longer than, say, an amber or patchouli-heavy blend from a middling range. Some scent families (usually those found in the top notes) burn away quickly, whereas darker musks, resins, woods, and heavier vanillas (base notes) will last foreverrrrrr, even in lower concentrations.  That said, Solstice Scents lasts a long time on me (but is overwhelmingly strong to me for the first three hours), and a lot of their blends tend to be resin/woods heavy, which helps.  BPAL lasts a long time on me so long as it's not a citrus-heavy blend."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dn81k,sihaya09,9,Fri Jul 17 17:33:50 2015 UTC,"BPAL, Solstice Scents, Possets, in that order.  I don't personally have much experience with SS but people tend to rank them #1 or 2 for longevity and throw."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dn81k,homicidalunicorns,7,Fri Jul 17 17:25:04 2015 UTC,"For me BPAL is #1 for strength and longevity, by a wide margin. This is not necessarily a good thing though. I only need a perfume to last 8 hours instead of 2 days...  I usually get around 8 hours from Possets, Solstice Scents, Haus of Gloi. Something like Smelly Yeti smells great but lasts only  about 2 hours on me."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dn81k,ZeroDagger,2,Fri Jul 17 18:01:55 2015 UTC,"I noticed that about BPAL too! I only have Lemon Scented Sticky Bat but it lasted a whole day on me, and lemon scents so rarely last more than three hours or so!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dn81k,CrimsonQuill157,6,Sat Jul 18 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"I'm still trying a lot of different brands, but so far Alkemia has blown me away with their longevity and throw. Everything I've tried from them has been long lasting without losing complexity. Pretty damn impressed."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dn81k,Boobtape,5,Fri Jul 17 17:34:37 2015 UTC,"Solstice Scents, Nocturne Alchemy, and Possets.  That being said, these companies all have some perfumes where the top note fades quickly and the base persists, but some stay ""true."" Citrus, fruit, and some florals will always dissipate faster. Musks, woods, spice, and vanilla tend to have a lot more staying power, in most brands. I have especially found Solstice Scents sticks around FOREVER. If I don't shower, I can smell the perfume on me after 48 hours."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dn81k,lgbtqbbq,2,Fri Jul 17 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"I'm seconding this.  On me, the order is Nocturne Alchemy, Possets and Solstice Scents. All of these houses tend to leave a trace through the next day on the vast majority of the scents I've tried."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dn81k,Sakecat22,4,Sat Jul 18 17:18:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on the fragrance from what I've found, but Arcana, Lou Lou's, HoG, Possets, and SS generally have good throw and longevity with my skin chemistry. As much as I passionately love DC, a lot of the scents are soft/whisper distance types and/or need frequent reapplication. YMMV, but this is totally fine for me because some of them with higher boss levels would probably be too much badassery for random people around me. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dn81k,AliceInPlunderland,5,Fri Jul 17 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"Arcana and Solstice Scents are the longest lasting on my skin.

DC's Cloudswing lasts forever on me, as does Aequitas, but some of the others (florals in particular) don't last long at all."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dn81k,chocolatebundtcake,2,Sat Jul 18 00:19:01 2015 UTC,I think it's really important to keep in mind the specific blend and your skin chem can play a huge role in how long a scent lasts/how much sillage it has.  With that said I find HoG has probably the longest staying power on me but I'm still a relative newbie to perfumes!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dn81k,starward-,2,Sat Jul 18 00:22:48 2015 UTC,"Arcana, BPAL, Nocturne Alchemy/VAPothecary, and Possets all have blends that can last nearly all day on me. There are many other indie companies that carry scents that last long too, but these companies seem to have the highest track record for me. Hands down I think Arcana scents have lasted the longest."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dn81k,damonkitty,2,Sat Jul 18 00:39:20 2015 UTC,"Alchimia Apothecary lasts ages on me and has great throw (not too much, not too little). Reeeaaally wish I had stocked up before they got rid of most/all of their general catalogue"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dmkp6,Floofulls,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's way more banana-y in the tub than it is on the skin.

Indiemakeupandmore,3dmkp6,splat-blam,4,Fri Jul 17 16:14:17 2015 UTC,"Great reviews! The shipments came so quick! Here are some of my thoughts:   I loved Blueberry Pie in scrub and oil. The PB was a little flat for me...it needed a little more sweet crust scent or something to me, a little stale smelling. I also could have LOVED more blueberries - always more blueberries lol (Blueberry scents are my absolute favorite) Boca Chica didn't do it for me (Scrub/PB)- I think it was the gardenia that through me off, I expected more tropical fruity and got more floral. Probably will destash  Sugga - was really nice in PB form was very nice crisp clean scent. Did anyone else get like a lighter Zazz feel from it? The HoG lemon goes straight up Lysol for me, but I do like lemon in general.  Trippy Hippy - I regret only getting the 1 PB of this, I actually loved it. The straight up natural lavender smell was perfect."

I'm also pleasantly surprised by how much I like Boca Chica. It's very summery and lovely. Definitely one of my fave Reverie releases to date!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dmkp6,reallysaucy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:02:23 2015 UTC,Just got my order today and I agree with your review about Sugga. The scent is very spot on with the description. I got it in the scrub and pb.  I also got Trippy Hippy (scrub and pb) which smells like a straight up French lavender with a smidgen of green patchouli. I like lavender but I'm hoping the vanilla gets stronger with some curing.  Thanks for your review!

Also last night was the eve of the beginning of my period, which is always uncomfortable (cramps/backache) + emotional (general craziness becomes focused crazinessx100)  But on the bright side I have been layering my perfumes like crazy and getting a lot of use out of them. I've also been testing my samples from past orders to see if my first impressions can be trusted. It seems in most cases yes, except with Solstice Scents. If I hated an SS scent immediately, chances are I'll love it after it ages. I probably adore about 70% of all SS, am ok with 20%, and dislike 10%. But I tested Lavender Vanilla and Owlcreek Aleworks today (both which I said meh to initially) and they are great.  Lav Vanilla is EXACTLY like lavender ice cream. Somehow the combo here is making me think real actual ice cream.   Owlcreek is a super buttery nutty caramel. Spicy and crunchy almost, like nut brittle. Delicious. I bet this would layer well."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dntsq,i_am_a_cyborg,3,Sat Jul 18 01:32:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Sunflowers is a green, floral honey with a hint of spice. I have quite a few good honey smells already, but not one like this. I didn't get Sea of Ice, but Hay Wain was quite nice. I couldn't stop smelling Windmill on myself; it's so interesting, I was trying to decipher it with my nose."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dntsq,SirWaffalot,3,Sat Jul 18 02:29:16 2015 UTC,"My week was super weird. Bluesfest was awesome and I got to see Mariana's Trench, Chance the Rapper, Keith Urban and Dallas Smith in concert. Unfortunately I fainted in the middle of the crowd during Kanye so I didn't get to see Iggy :( I also almost fainted the week before and I've been overly exhausted so I'm worried something is seriously wrong. I have a doctor's appointment on Monday and my lovely bf is driving me to Toronto at this very moment (because I do not want to chance fainting at the wheel :|) so hopefully I'll have answers soon. =|"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dntsq,montycuddles,3,Fri Jul 17 20:21:49 2015 UTC,Feel better!! I fainted once at a football game and it sucked. Apparently heat + low iron + low blood sugar = bad times.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dntsq,SirWaffalot,2,Fri Jul 17 21:21:26 2015 UTC,Thank you! I think it might be low iron actually (and it was really hot at Kanye) as I've been eating steaks all week and feel a bit better haha!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dntsq,NorthwestTreeOctopus,3,Fri Jul 17 21:26:59 2015 UTC,Up your vitamin B intake too! I found that worked for me when I had my own fainting spells going on.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dntsq,montycuddles,3,Fri Jul 17 21:30:42 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that too. I actually take a vitamin to make up the difference since I don't eat red meat or pork."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dntsq,gottapoopy,3,Sat Jul 18 01:58:32 2015 UTC,"It was a stressful work week because we are short-staffed and one of the guys was too lazy to do his work, so I had to take some of the slack. Been working more than 10hrs/day and I don't even get paid overtime.    To make it worse, relationships at home needed work. Good thing we straightened things out and agreed on a lot of things. There's only one last thing that I need to figure out, which is to travel as a couple or as a group. I don't know if it's better if we should travel as a couple since it's our first major trip, or if we should include his sister, whom he expects to share the same room the whole time. She invited herself and he said yes.    Thank god for the good smells. Some of them are very uplifting and therapeutic."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dntsq,i_am_a_cyborg,2,Sat Jul 18 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"What? You are supposed to share a room with his sister on your first trip together? That seems a bit un-private. I think it would be okay to travel with other people, but having your own room as a couple seems kind of important."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dntsq,gottapoopy,3,Fri Jul 17 22:56:45 2015 UTC,Yeah he said he's expecting the sister to be with us in the whole trip (including sharing a room) cause it would be weird to kick her out or make her feel like the third wheel.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dntsq,montycuddles,2,Sat Jul 18 01:35:22 2015 UTC,"How long is the trip? I could probably suck it up and share a room for a couple of days, but I generally prefer not to share my room unless it's with someone I'm dating. Plus for me it would be awkward to share a room with someone else because I plan to have sex in vacation, but I know that's not an issue for everyone. Hopefully you guys come up with a solution!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dntsq,montycuddles,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:36:46 2015 UTC,I would fee the same way honestly. Plus your first vacation with someone tells you a lot about them! You never truly know someone until you see how they handle lost luggage

I bought garnets, citrines, labradorite, moonstone, grossular garnets, hessonite, and a strand of truly SPECTACULAR tunduru sapphires. I also bought all the wax and fragrance oils I need for my candle tins and sketched up the six or seven scents I'd like to offer.  Today, I did a full-scale assault cleaning of my office and studio, and cleared out my walk-in supply closet of the mountain of boxes threatening to take over.  And tomorrow I plan to get outside-- a long hike at Antietam, and dinner somewhere in Harper's Ferry!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dntsq,montycuddles,2,Sat Jul 18 04:38:13 2015 UTC,"I pretty much have the option to go into the office or work from home. Sometimes it's a lot less distracting to be at home because I can just zone out and work on excel, instead of talking to coworkers."

I make my own now, and just add their perfume as a scent to it, but if I want to treat myself to a luxury I'll buy theirs.  I think your review of zazz got cut off though.   There's a picture...but no writing. I'd love to read your review of that as well!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dm0p4,randomactsofbadness,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:07:23 2015 UTC,Oh! The review of Zazz must not have saved for some reason. I just put it back in there. It was not my thing at all! I do like the sugar scrub though. I reckon I will get the full size once I run out! Although your idea of making your own and adding the scent to it is a really good idea. What do you use to make it? I made one once but it was literally just olive oil and sugar and was so messy.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dm0p4,-drbadass-,2,Fri Jul 17 11:25:24 2015 UTC,"I think you can also get the scrubs in Aether, which is unscented, and maybe add scents to those."

It's all good, I'm sure we have an equivalent - I just did some googling and have learned so much already about them, haha. I'd assumed they were savoury as crackers here are pretty bland and generally used for dips. I didn't realise graham crackers were biscuits! They seem really similar to McVities digestives."

For indies, I wore Solstice Scents Kitchen for the scent because it's been bloody freezing and that's a warm scent that makes me happy, and I can still smell traces of it twelve hours later. My lips were my beloved Fyrinnae Vixen, and the eyes...  I was using some of my newly arrived My Pretty Zombie shadows! I used Fresh Scab in the outer and inner corners, and Brisket all over the lid (with some gel liner for my wing and a gold shadow on the lower lashline). Fresh Scab is a stunning matte dark red that's hugely pigmented, and Brisket - wow. Brisket is a red colour with an intense gold lean that you can't see at all, but I'm completely in love with it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dlq9q,sarkata,2,Fri Jul 17 10:26:09 2015 UTC,I'm getting better at doing things other than just lips! I actually just placed a sneaky eyeshadow order without a single lip product

Indiemakeupandmore,3dlq9q,gottapoopy,3,Fri Jul 17 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"Im walking on a beautiful smelling cloud! Opened up a bottle of SS Cascade of Gold. It was giving me a very warm feeling as I applied this. I was able to pick out sandalwood and something spicy and incensy in it. I would think this scent is better for fall or winter, since I would normally associate summer with florals, fruity, citrus scents. Nevertheless, it's a very well blended scent where the different notes complement each other. It doesnt smell one-sided or flat.    On my eyes I am using HW Savior of Sailors as a liner. Because it has a dark base, I didnt need to put my gel eyeliner underneath. The metallic blue pops out really nice when foiled too.    EDIT: OMG WHY DO I SMELL LIKE A GUY!? CASCADE OF GOLD YOU BETRAYED ME!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dlq9q,greenchipmunk,2,Fri Jul 17 12:07:09 2015 UTC,I wore Two Finger Ballet combined with Cocoa Pink's Butterscotch Marshmallow Frosting lotion the other day. I smelled like a glorious cloud of sweet vanilla.

Indiemakeupandmore,3dlq9q,lgbtqbbq,2,Fri Jul 17 16:16:13 2015 UTC,"I'm so beat. I went home early from work yesterday because I was just bleary and exhausted and feeling ill. I thought I'd feel better today but...I do not at all. So I'm wearing Solstice Scents Shadows in the Night, which is kind of suiting my darker mood but also perking me up.   SitN smells like bayberry and spruce, just like a Christmas candle but with no spice. It’s not an overly green evergreen scent, more like the sap and the needles made into tea or something like that. Romanticized, fragrant, but not like literally standing in the woods. The peppermint gives that cold feeling though, and the sweet amber and Edge of the Night base make for a fairly round scent, which is surprising considering the evergreen notes, which generally read “sharp.” I would say overall this is a lovely, almost fruity green scent with the beautiful Edge of the Night amber base smoothing it out. I love this even if we're in the middle of summer. I bet I'll wear it a lot in December! It's also quite unisex, so would be a great cologne."

My coworker also handed me a bottle of lavender lotion from her sister's company called Green Girl Basics. She does have a website, but it looks to be down for the summer :( The lotion was fabulous! It smelled of lavender essential oil plus the dry down was not greasy on my hands. It was a great lotion for work since I am on a computer all day.

Indiemakeupandmore,3djqlp,blonderuby,3,Thu Jul 16 21:52:13 2015 UTC,"yes thank you for giving these quick reviews! I've got Boss Fight on the way, but opted out of Arylide since it sounded pretty floral.  If it's green I might need to add it to my wishlist..."
Indiemakeupandmore,3djqlp,-drbadass-,2,Thu Jul 16 23:13:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review! I put in an order for Arylide earlier this week and I'm so, so excited to get my hands on it! Oh! as a sidenote about aryllde! Evonne told me that proceeds from it are going to help support someone very close to her, so yay good causes too! :D"
Indiemakeupandmore,3djqlp,Pookabbit,2,Fri Jul 17 01:42:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for these reviews! I ordered them earlier today. These are the first reviews I've seen.
Indiemakeupandmore,3djqlp,AgentKG,2,Fri Jul 17 03:56:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, I want Arylide so badly! Maybe I'll go a little outside of my low--buy to replace Serpentina and grab it. Thanks for the reviews!!!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3djqlp,makeupaway,2,Fri Jul 17 05:41:46 2015 UTC,Ooh I ordered both but you've got me all excited about Arylide too :) I'm very curious as to what my nose will find in there!
Indiemakeupandmore,3djqlp,ishotthepilot,2,Fri Jul 17 06:09:04 2015 UTC,Well fuck me sideways--I was doing so well avoiding these and now I need them!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,surly_elk,35,Thu Jul 16 16:39:51 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile, so please excuse formating!   While I was deployed last year, anytime I got a chance I would order from Darlingclandestine since I absolutely love her perfume oils. The last time I ordered though was around Christmas time.   I mentioned to Evonne how her fragrances reminded me of home and how excited I was to get home to my indie packages when the deployment would finally be over. She asked for my APO address and asked if there were any American goodies that I missed. Since we were allowed to receive packages I gave it to her.   She sent me my order, along with an item I had ordered a few weeks prior (and refunded me the shipping on that previous item, as it hadn't shipped out yet anyway), and sent me a TON of candy, my favorite being the peppermint candy Junior Mints. She even stamped her signature shark on the package with a little hand - drawn American flag and a word bubble that said ""Come home safe!""...I cried. It was so awesome and meant so much that she would do that for me. I love the indie community so much, and am still an avid collector of Darlingclandestine perfume oils!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,sentimentmachine,4,Fri Jul 17 00:16:09 2015 UTC,Awww that's an amazing story!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,montycuddles,2,Fri Jul 17 00:48:35 2015 UTC,This just melts my heart so much. <3
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,AliceInPlunderland,14,Fri Jul 17 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"My Haus of Gloi parcel was stolen from my front steps. They replaced it, despite it being in no way their fault (I only alerted them because I was concerned that it have never been delivered and wanted to confirm they shipped it out). And they apologized that they were out of some of the scents I had purchased. What?! That much niceness upsets my world view... and I'm Canadian."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,mermaidunicornhybrid,30,Thu Jul 16 19:20:06 2015 UTC,"For me, it is a recent experience I had with Blackbird Cosmetics.  The fault was ALL MINE.  I made an order without checking the TAT, and about a week after, I realized that the order would likely arrive the day I left for vacation.  And nothing says ""Please rob this house the owners are not home"" like packages left on the front porch :(  So I contacted the owner and asked if she could either send it to me via 2-day mail (which I would gladly pay for) or if she could wait a few extra days to ship it so that I would be home.  Maleah wrote back and said she could actually pop it in the mail that day (a Saturday) so it would get to me in time with regular post.  I didn't get a shipping confirmation, and a few days later, the owner wrote me again.  Her basement had flooded, so she wasn't able to get the order shipped out Saturday as intended.  Instead, she was shipping it via Priority 2-Day so it would get to me on time and covered the extra herself!  I was blown away by the fact that she went the extra mile to get my package to me even though she was dealing with a flood!  tl;dr:  I totally messed up an order, contacted the owner, and she sent my package via express shipping even though her basement was flooded."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,laceandhoney,15,Thu Jul 16 16:52:12 2015 UTC,"Not sure where you live, but you can put your mail on hold with USPS. It's free and easy; I do it all the time when I go on vacation. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,LILY_LALA,2,Thu Jul 16 18:56:24 2015 UTC,You can also schedule deliveries for pretty much every package service with their websites.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,Flewtea,3,Fri Jul 17 06:07:56 2015 UTC,"I made an order about two weeks ago, when her TAT was stated at 2-3 weeks. I unexpectedly got an email last week saying that because she'd expected to get things out in 7 days and it would take an extra day, she wanted to include a free full-size. I wrote her back about some samples I'd been considering but that nothing was necessary, since she was well within TAT. Order got to me a few days ago with the extra samples, totally unnecessary but very nice. And a really cute little crown ring that my toddler promptly claimed."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,FinalAccountForMe,12,Fri Jul 17 18:24:14 2015 UTC,"Shiro, my first indie order. I ordered 4 intertubes and I had no idea it was common for indie products in that type of packaging to not twist back down. I finally noticed the problem by twisting Insanity Wolf . . insanely high, twisting it to go down, and not looking as I put the cap on. So I e-mailed Caitlin with pictures of all four, the product broken from the platform and twisting mechanism, and she e-mailed me back within a day, two at the most, and she kindly and professionally offered to replace all four.   I had just wanted to let her know about the problem, perhaps receive an explanation and/or instructions on how to fix it, which she also gave me! I felt replacing all four was too much, so we settled on four empty replacement tubes, instructions on how to melt and pour the intertubes and another Insanity Wolf. I would also find 4 more eyeshadow samples and more candy. She has maxed out her customer service level and is really going for an exalted reputation for her company.   TL;DR - Twisted Insanity Wolf out too far, noticed all my intertubes wouldn't twist back down, e-mailed Caitlin, was stunned by her impeccable customer service, received replacements and even more eyeshadow samples and candy."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,mermaidunicornhybrid,4,Thu Jul 16 18:58:45 2015 UTC,Caitlin is seriously the best. She helped me put together a bday present for my friend!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,FinalAccountForMe,0,Thu Jul 16 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"I can't agree more, I couldn't have personally thought of a better introduction to indies. She really doesn't seem to just put up with almost all of her customers, but enjoy them. That seems like a lovely and thoughtful gift, your friend is lucky."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,vidiuk,9,Fri Jul 17 08:30:16 2015 UTC,Definitely my Alchimia custom scent experiences. I had a couple very particular scents I had wanted to create as gifts last Christmas. I had described what I was looking for and some notes I was considering. Erin and I emailed back and forth around 20 times discussing which notes would work well and which might not or which might overpower the others. I was very happy with some unexpected suggestions and the scents were fantastic! I can see why she had to make this a premium offering going forward because all of that for $15 was pretty amazing.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,AngelsHaveTheTardis,8,Thu Jul 16 18:58:44 2015 UTC,"Ellie from Dreamworld is amazing. Nearly every time I order she includes a note and little present for my daughter. She even remembers her name! Now my little one has her own Dreamworld lip product collection, and they're all crazy colors. She loves them!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,blonderuby,6,Thu Jul 16 23:09:08 2015 UTC,"I think my best, also most recent, indie CS experience was with Haus of Gloi! I placed a pretty late order for my mom for mother's day, then realized I was moving out of my dorm in a week and a half so I kind of needed it to ship fast, and they replied super quickly and shipped it the next day. It arrived in time for mother's day and way before I moved out, and they upgraded one of the mini lotions I ordered to full size (and it happened to be my mom's favorite one)!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,Tuffette,6,Thu Jul 16 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"Kheimistrii - I'm in love with her Mr Freeze scent but it's a seasonal offering. There were only small sizes listed so I messaged her on the off chance there were any regular sizes left or upcoming. She said no so I stocked up on the small sizes. About a week later & a day after my order shipped, the larger sizes were in stock. I messaged my concern about the mix up, being as polite as I could and not asking for anything in return (I work in customer service so I know about demanding customers!) She messaged right away apologizing & let me know she was shipping me a full size whip'd body wash AND a lotion! So besides the fact that her products are amazing, her kindness & going above & beyond has made me a loyal customer!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,ishotthepilot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:04:13 2015 UTC,jealous! i was also curious as i've never seen full sizes of Mr Freeze when I looked! That is very awesome.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,CorvusCorset,20,Fri Jul 17 02:47:55 2015 UTC,"Corvus Cosmetics! In my first order,  the free sample was missing from my package. I told Noel (not really expecting anything), and she gave me a 15% off code. As soon as the Merewif collection came out, I ordered it and the sample that I never recieved. The 15% off happened to cover the cost of that sample, and I thanked her again. She put extra samples and candy in that order too =)    I'm not affiliated with Corvus Cosmetics, we just happen to like the same genus of birds"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,mermaidunicornhybrid,6,Thu Jul 16 16:43:17 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I like your disclaimer.  You should ask the mods to make a flair!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,CorvusCorset,3,Thu Jul 16 17:05:20 2015 UTC,"Flair-- ""totally not affiliated with Corvus Cosmetics"". Fantastic!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,meriendaselgato,2,Thu Jul 16 19:21:49 2015 UTC,Yes please
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,ichikoa,4,Thu Jul 16 19:50:39 2015 UTC,"Ellie from Dreamworld Hermetica is a saint. I've mentioned elsewhere on IMAM my sample-ordering experience where she sent me an email almost instantaneously to help me find my shade.  When I was ready to order a bigger size and had settled on a shade, I was upgraded to full size from the munchkin for free because she didn't want to delay my order any longer (although it was far below the stated TAT), which was SO generous. When I got it I realized I had received the wrong shade. I emailed her and she was really apologetic and nice, and sent me the right shade (also in FS) straight away.  She's always been generous with samples, and is just a generally sweet person to deal with. I had some trouble with foundation application because it is a bit drier than the Meow I have been used to, but I found a way to make it work because of how much I like Ellie, and because the shades are great. (For those interested, I just applied more moisturizer than I used to for a better finish.)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,shriekingmauve,4,Thu Jul 16 20:38:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't had a bad experience yet.    I find fyrinnae goes above and beyond with any issue. And usually it's my ""oh shit I forgot"" error. Darling girl used to take custom orders. She was a delight to work with.  Aromaleigh took great care in communication with me when I asked her questions to help me with what I was looking for."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,iskindoffunny,5,Fri Jul 17 00:36:27 2015 UTC,"I ordered a lipstick and a balm from Preen, and before it arrived, I got a message from Jen saying the balm might be grainy because of temperature fluctuations in transit, and that she'd send out another as soon as the batch was ready (regardless of whether it was grainy - it was). The fact that she came to me about it really impressed me.   Also, I always get a kick out of seeing ""Thanks again Kellie!"" (bolded emphasis mine) when I order from Fyrinnae. Like, d'awh, they remembered haha"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,SUBARU17,6,Thu Jul 16 19:01:32 2015 UTC,"In my enthusiasm and love for my new My Pretty Zombie eyeshadows I twisted the cap back on really tight, completely my fault and a really dumb thing to do but I could not for the life of me get it off again. I emailed Andrea about it and not only did she send me a replacement of the one I couldn't open, but another full size eyeshadow. I was really surprised that she'd send me a replacement much less a free eyeshadow."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,singinginthecar,3,Thu Jul 16 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"I missed a one-day Altitude Soap Co. sale (I worked a 12-hour shift and my time zone is different). I asked the owner if I could buy something with the coupon, and she made a unique code for me to use. I never asked a brand to do this before, and I don't beg to use expired coupons at a store. I thought it was worth a try so I went for it. The worst anyone can say is no, right? Otherwise, I think it's above and beyond when any brand sends free samples. Those take time to make and cost monies too."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,ferbrat,3,Thu Jul 16 18:24:19 2015 UTC,Aromaleigh.  I ordered the night before the site hack and she still sent out my order within the quoted TAT even though she couldn't access any order info for a couple of days.  I was just really impressed by that and I promptly ordered more!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,whereismydragon,3,Thu Jul 16 22:38:10 2015 UTC,"I've had lots of good CS experiences with indies, but the ones that stand out would have to be Fyrinnae and Darling Clandestine.  I got an order from Fyrinnae some months ago, and I'd ordered a full size of Romantique. Prior, I'd ordered a small size of it. The color was rather different between the sample and the full size- the sample was noticeably more pink. I didn't think too much of it, since I was after that golden sheen, but did post the difference in my post about my order. A mere couple hours later, I was contacted by u/Dorian_Gray_, who asked if I'd emailed Fyrinnae about the color difference. I told him no, since I didn't think it was a big deal. He somehow managed to track my order down from the small amount of information available in my picture, and sent me a replacement full sized Romantique! He told me that they cooked the mixture a bit longer to make the pink more prominent, which is what I wanted. If that's not going above and beyond, I don't know what is.  I've had many interactions with Evonne from Darling Clandestine, and they've all been positive. I've had two packages from her go missing (one literally vanished into thin air), and she replaced both, even though I didn't ask her to. She's also given me great recommendations for scents she thought I would like."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,CrossedWires,3,Fri Jul 17 00:40:05 2015 UTC,"Probably Femme Fatale Cosmetics. I ordered a Shiro gloss and a Shadow Magic primer. It didn't ship for several days, but their TAT was pretty long at the time, so I honestly wasn't bothered. The day it shipped I got an email and a $5 store credit from Sophie saying she knew it was still within TAT, but for such a small order to take so long to be shipped, she felt like she wanted to give me something extra for my patience :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,THE_DINOSAUR_QUEEN,5,Fri Jul 17 07:33:46 2015 UTC,"Mine was with Pam from Girly Bits Cosmetics.  I had a bottle of polish with some undissolved pigments which left the odd little streak of colour on my nails as I painted them.  Not a huge issue, they weren't widespread and an extra coat would cover it up no problem.  I originally purchased the polish from Llarowe.  I emailed Girly Bits directly to check if this was normal for that shade.  She said it wasn't. All she asked for was a Llarowe order number and then sent a new bottle directly to me instead of getting me to go through the distributor that I'd originally purchased from.  I've also had a great experience with Shiro.  I am from Canada and shipping here is a little pricey.  However, I have a friend in the states who was coming back home for Christmas.  There was a great sale that I wanted to take advantage of and send to my friend in the states to bring back in her suitcase, however, the TAT was too long and the order wouldn't make it to my friend before she left.  I emailed explaining the situation and my order was expedited so I could save on shipping costs. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,Taynaynay,6,Thu Jul 16 16:57:15 2015 UTC,"Mine was probably with Shiro. I ordered a gloss with flavoring, then realized that the flavoring would likely irritate my usually-dry lips. I emailed Caitlin asking to make the gloss unflavored instead. Not only did she respond super-quickly, but she offered me a free shadow sample of my choice to make up for the $1 I'd spent on the gloss."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,Zannahquinn,5,Thu Jul 16 17:21:11 2015 UTC,"Probably Hello Waffle. She closed the shop for a few weeks and then opened with the newest collection she has out. I, excitedly wanted to make my first HW purchase so I got up early in the morning to buy the stuff I wanted when she first opened shop again. Later that day I looked here on indiemakeup&more and saw some discount codes I could have used and completely forgot to add my GWP. I contacted her asap and she responded... SO QUICK. She refunded me the code I could have used and let my choose my GWP. I was so thankful for the help. She is also so great when you are curious to see where you are on the waitlist for the monthly subscription."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,sea-weed,4,Thu Jul 16 20:30:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure this is super exciting, but my favorite eyeshadow from Darling Girl (Tragic Romance) got discontinued, and Susan let me buy a full jar even though it wasn't on the website. I was pretty thrilled :) it's so gorgeous"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,Estridde,4,Thu Jul 16 16:44:33 2015 UTC,I have to go with Shiro.  During an exchange I wanted to gift my partner the GoT collection eyeshadows but was cutting it really close in terms of the shipping deadline because she and I live in different countries.   I emailed Caitlin about my predicament and she rushed the order through AND included samples of the glosses from the set.  My exchange match was very happy and so was I!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,eraser_dust,4,Thu Jul 16 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"AFK, it was my second indie eyeshadow order ever and my first time trying out really adventurous colors. I mentioned on here that I was really excited about my order and I'd wished I got a sample of an eyeshadow I saw a swatch of. They asked my order number and sent me a free full size of that eyeshadow, Suicidal Bastard. It's become one of my favorite eyeshadows. I'm so ordering from them again once I have the money to."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,RhinestoneHousewife,5,Thu Jul 16 20:02:33 2015 UTC,"Ajevie, hands down. I keep switching addresses so I need her to email me before sending out decant orders and she does it without fail. I've also ordered from her so many times, and she never screws up at all. Her decants are also amazing –she lists out the brand name, the year the perfume's from, the perfume name & the notes. It makes collecting perfumes so much easier.   TL;DR: Ajevie is freaking awesome."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,TheLittleRed,-1,Fri Jul 17 03:29:35 2015 UTC,She's a great decantress!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,Tuipie,2,Fri Jul 17 14:16:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely Shiro!  I forgot to add flavors (or rather, I thought I didn't want any until I read on imam how bad they smelled without flavoring) to my two lip gloss orders, and I only emailed them about it a week or so after the order had been made. Caitlyn offered to add the flavors for free! :)  at the very least, I expected the order to take an extra week or so before it was sent out, but it seems they've finished the order in less than two weeks from the initial order date! <3 Thank god, since I was scared my lipgloss wouldn't arrive before I went on my 3 week vacation--but rather, it should arrive with several days to spare:)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,Calm_Sapphire,2,Thu Jul 16 19:59:16 2015 UTC,Life's Entropy! My Supernova lipstick disappeared in the mail (first time that's happened to me).

Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,riobh,2,Thu Jul 16 22:20:49 2015 UTC,"Shiro! Four of us had done a combined order because of the flat rate international shipping. We had got quite a bit and when it came two samples we had ordered were missing. No big deal and understandable. I emailed Caitlin and she gave me three options; refund of the missing samples, mailing them to me no charge, or include them in my next order and add free shipping.   She's awesome. She's so quick to offer solutions, even to problems that aren't her fault."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dis85,PhyrraNyx,2,Fri Jul 17 04:41:49 2015 UTC,"I had a really good customer service experience with Fyrinnae a while back. USPS, as is their wont, was mucking about with my package. The tracking claimed that it in Washington for a week and a half. I posted about it here and the owner sent me a reply really quickly, which was really good :) I emailed them and they refunded the difference in shipping, which was really good of them, and sent out a replacement really quickly. However the very next day after I had emailed them the package that was believed to be lost arrived! I told them and offered to return it, but they said I could keep both packages, which was honestly real good of them. They really went above and beyond.  Another good CS experience I had was with Life's Entropy. This time it was Royal Mail who lost it in London of all places. She said that she usually wouldn't send out replacement packages, since my order was pretty small she would replace it for me. Since she didn't get my first email she offered to put in some extra samples, which was really nice of her :D  Preen was really good to deal with, too. I, along with some other folks had problems with the lipstick not twisting down. She was really quick to respond, and offered me a replacement, even through my order was ages ago. :)"

So I emailed Cara and she got back to me in just a few minutes with a code just for me to use! Then, when my package came in, she had upgraded my GWP to a full size even though my total would have meant a sample size instead.

Turns out, the palette was probably damaged during shipping (these weren't supposed to be exposed to high temps.   I was offered a refund, store credit, or another palette. I picked store credit because I did like their glosses, and another palette would likely face the same issues. She gave me an extra $5 in store credit! O:"

Dawn is an extreme sweetheart. I placed my first order when she was having issues with the Paypal cart and some items not showing up as in stock for people. I emailed her instead, and she was very helpful through my whole order. She even included four free samples, even though my order total was only a little over $10. My second order involved many products that I intended to use for an exchange. I ended up ordering two of some samples because I wanted one for myself and my exchange partner, and after I placed my order, she emailed me to ask if I wanted them in the same baggie or separate! I thought it was super helpful and considerate.  I've also not ordered from Dreamworld Hermetica yet, but I've emailed Ellie about color matches, and she has been super nice and responds within a day with many suggestions for me. Definitely on my list.  Darling Clandestine is also one of my faves for personal CS. She included a shoutout to the mascot of my HS alma mater on one of my packages since we live so close to one another. I was so jazzed."

Then when it was restocked, Angela emailed me to let me know before announcing the restock, so I would be able to grab it! I ordered, and within less than two hours it had shipped. Honestly, I don't know how she does it. Even after new releases her shipping and response time is always super quick.

Indiemakeupandmore,3di0pq,AelisAndura,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:01:22 2015 UTC,I am ABSOLUTELY loving the cupcake!
Indiemakeupandmore,3di0pq,teacupocean,2,Thu Jul 16 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"Yes! Ordered Chignon, Cupcake, and Raspberry Rose. I can't wait to try them all, especially Chignon!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,sea-weed,10,Thu Jul 16 08:02:24 2015 UTC,"What would Howl (of Moving Castle notoriety) wear?  Judging from the state of his bathroom shelves when Sophie tried to clean them I feel like he'd have lots of cool cosmetics, toiletries, and fragrances to dive into before going out to steal hearts."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,mallowleaves,15,Thu Jul 16 13:39:09 2015 UTC,Howl would get so into the Asian skincare kick holy shit. He would have one of those 25 step routines that takes two hours. And all the oils from Garden of Wisdom. And sheet masks. Sooo many sheet masks. (Sophie sometimes doesn't even wash her face before bed and Howl is HORRIFIED and keeps trying to buy her fancy skin stuff that she keeps not using) I could go on but I think this is starting to get off topic hahaha
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,sea-weed,4,Thu Jul 16 18:24:10 2015 UTC,YESSSSSS.  He's got at least ten different bottles of essences and you're not kidding about the sheet masks!    Sophie's indifference to skincare truly pains him and he's forever tucking tubes of Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence sunscreen into her apron pockets in the hopes she'll use 'em before she goes out to tend to the flowers.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lisaplusplus,2,Thu Jul 16 18:35:11 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha oh my god YES! Howl would be such a skincare junkie, staying with all the latest niche trends. Snail slime Howl."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lisaplusplus,8,Fri Jul 17 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"First thing to come to mind is BPAL Oberon: Orchid, white musk, and bergamot wafting over juniper berries, with a gentle touch of soft, earthy patchouli.  It's a really interesting unisex scent -- green and herbal, but in a clean, refined way, with a hint of something spicy.  A tiny bit of sweetness, but not sweet enough to be a feminine scent at all. I totally imagine  this scent on some interesting, magical, sort-of-androgynous weirdo person like Howl."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,sea-weed,3,Thu Jul 16 14:09:16 2015 UTC,"This is perfect!  I can totally picture him dabbing this on, picking up his guitar, and departing whilst humming.   Also I really want to try this!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lisaplusplus,2,Thu Jul 16 14:12:21 2015 UTC,"It's a good one! At face value, it's perfectly wearable on a day-to-day basis, but I categorize it in my head as a perfume for weird, interesting or intellectual occasions, like a day exploring the woods, or a day touring old used bookstores...so it hasn't actually gotten a whole lot of use! The type of weird indulgences that are a part of the days when I would want to wear this sort of seem like a part of who Howl is all the time :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,sea-weed,2,Thu Jul 16 14:29:08 2015 UTC,I do the same thing with fragrances.  Certain ones end up filed in my brain as perfect for particular moods and occasions and when I choose them it's because I want to feel like That Kind Of Person on the day.   I agree that every day is likely this kind of day for Howl and the scent description just suits him perfectly!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,Boobtape,3,Thu Jul 16 14:33:28 2015 UTC,Haha in my mind I would have some components from BPAL Jareth mixed in with some herby greens.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,thatonemedic,3,Thu Jul 16 15:23:44 2015 UTC,He did wear perfume if the book... Something with hyacinths I thought?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,hufflebee,5,Thu Jul 16 22:19:57 2015 UTC,What would Luna Lovegood wear?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lgbtqbbq,8,Thu Jul 16 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"I think of pale aquatics for Luna- something like Moon Goddess from Alkemia (A magical elixir of narcotic florals - datura, night-blooming cereus, and white poppy enfolded in a aquatically luminous blend of water musks, delicate cucumber, and the palest melons.) or Nocturne Alchemy Blue Topaz (A beautiful Blue Musk blend of aquatic musks and oceanic pine but not the 'ocean' staple of salt and sea, but of mermaids and mermen, perfume for a fantasy musk of Atlantis.)  I guess I think of pale blue colors because of Ravenclaw/her light coloring and musky aquatics because of her hazy dreamlike observations and comments!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,Palindr0mic,3,Thu Jul 16 23:13:39 2015 UTC,"Seconding the aquatics, but also I think she'd get a real kick out of some of the lighter more floral weird and wonderful scents. And totally something with lavender in, because lavender makes me think dreamy.  eta makeup wise I think she'd be a big fan of colours like Shiro's Finklestein and Geek Chic's Morningstar. Those kind of pale, gently shimmery shades. Maybe NM's Gamonbozia (? I can't spell it)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,troispartrois,4,Fri Jul 17 09:12:17 2015 UTC,What would the March sisters from Little Women wear?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,amaijala9792,2,Thu Jul 16 16:33:52 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I've seen the movie and the book is on my to-read list, so this is going off of my fairly old memories of them. Meg would like the lighter mattes from Blackbird and lighter scents like Paper Dolls and Two Finger Ballet (though quite a scandalous name). Jo would obviously like to delve into the book themed scents and some leather and tea scents. Maybe some shimmery neutral shadows too. I think Beth would like floral perfumes and be into neutrals with a twist. Overall subtle but with a little flair. Since Amy is artistic, she'd be the most adventurous in the color department, though still subdued. I think she would be into the lighter fruity perfumes.  Now I really want to watch that movie again.."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lgbtqbbq,2,Fri Jul 17 00:07:45 2015 UTC,"Jo would wear Library from Solstice Scents (Leather Bound Books, A Carved Rosewood Mantle, Dying Fireplace Embers, Wood Wainscoting, Cedar Shelving and Aged Paper) because it's a unisex, bookish smell.  Meg would wear Solstice Scents Rose Mallow Cream (Moroccan Rose absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute, Marshmallow Fluff, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk) because she loves luxury and pretty things, but is very loving and kind so it's not a pretentious or too-froofy smell.  Beth (RIP) would wear Solstice Scents Lavender Vanilla (Lavender Essential Oil & Sweet Creamy Vanilla) because it's quiet and inoffensive.  Amy would wear Solstice Scents Black Forest (Agarwood, Nagarmotha, Tobacco, Chocolate, Red and Black Cherries, Hay, Sandalwood, Whipped Cream & Pink Pepper) because it's quite attention-seeking and beautiful. It's also sweet in a kind of spoiled (dirty) way, which I think describes her.  Sorry I just love Solstice Scents :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,Boobtape,2,Fri Jul 17 18:29:34 2015 UTC,What would the xenomorphs from Alien wear?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,frumperbell,6,Thu Jul 16 11:43:22 2015 UTC,BPAL's Gore Shock.  They'd consider it the greatest foodie scent ever.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,Boobtape,2,Thu Jul 16 12:58:43 2015 UTC,Oh wow the notes in that sound amazingly weird. I might have to try and find that just for sniffing's sake.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,mallowleaves,5,Thu Jul 16 15:24:35 2015 UTC,I totally thought that this said Animorphs and had a whole thing ready to go before I realized. I guess xenomorphs might be less into blue eyeshadow than andalites hahaha
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,Palindr0mic,2,Thu Jul 16 18:30:43 2015 UTC,I wanted to say glitter for a laugh and now I can't get the image of a glittery xenomorph out of my head.  If xenomorphs wore eyeshadow though I'd totally go for Unholy from Femme Fatale. It's a green-pink shifting black.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,thewindupbirds,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:15:17 2015 UTC,So glittery~
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,thatonemedic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:00:02 2015 UTC,Supernova Sway!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lisaplusplus,2,Thu Jul 16 22:18:05 2015 UTC,Any of the Disney princesses?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,hermeownie,5,Thu Jul 16 14:12:33 2015 UTC,Snow White would love to smell like HoG's Olde Cider Haus!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lisaplusplus,2,Thu Jul 16 14:22:20 2015 UTC,"Oh this is a good one! The apples are a straightforward reference, but also it sounds like sort of a sweet, cozy smell with the vanilla and hay (which fits her character), and then the name is sort of perfect too because Snow White is a German tale!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,sea-weed,5,Thu Jul 16 14:36:48 2015 UTC,Rapunzel would wear Fyrinnae Rapunzel Had Extensions and sigh at the label.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lisaplusplus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:47:29 2015 UTC,"Awww! Yes, she would!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lgbtqbbq,5,Fri Jul 17 16:30:12 2015 UTC,"Jasmine would wear Loukoum by Alchemic Muse, it's a gorgeous citrusy mint rose marshmallow...just like actual Turkish Delight  Merida would wear Sixteen92 Eternal Return because of the bright fierce greenness  Mulan would wear Solstice Scents Smoky Mountain Mallow because it's sweet but a bit masculine, and it also has lapsang souchong tea  Belle would wear Library by Solstice Scents for the obvious reasons  Aurora/Briar Rose would wear Nightshade by Alchemic Muse because it's lavender and powdery soft chocolate, very soothing and sweet and sleepy  Tiana would wear SS Foxcroft Fairgrounds because it's a little outdoorsy but smells mainly of powdered sugar and donuts, a lot like beignets  Kida from Atlantis (aka the best Disney movie ever) would wear something aquatic and interesting like SS Tenebrous Mist  (non-Princess Princesses)  Megara would wear OHWTO Aravine because it's sexy and purple and slinky, fruit and floral  Esmeralda would wear Whispers in the Night by SS, it's a spicy sexy jasmine amber  Tinkerbell would wear Possets Linden Tea because it's fluffy and honeyed and green"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lisaplusplus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:50:48 2015 UTC,"These are all absolutely perfect. Also, I don't know why, but the idea of why smoky mountain mallow would be good for Mulan makes me really want to try it!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,adragonisnoslave,3,Fri Jul 17 21:23:46 2015 UTC,Ariel would love OHWTO Sea Legs!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,sea-weed,2,Thu Jul 16 14:15:34 2015 UTC,Ariel would have a sentimental attachment to Black Violet Sea Goddess.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lisaplusplus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:45:57 2015 UTC,"hah, perfect!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,blueskiesandsun,3,Thu Jul 16 14:38:04 2015 UTC,"Rapunzel would love HOG Zazz, Merida would love Solstice Scents Covered Bridge!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lisaplusplus,2,Thu Jul 16 14:31:00 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh, Zazz would be perfect for Rapunzel! She's young and sweet and girly and excitable -- ""zazzy and not overcomplicated"" from the scent description is sort of a perfect description for her, but I can also see her using this everyday as a ""I'm gonna slather this all over my arms and be the person that I smell like today and make all my dreams come true!"" kind of scent.   And covered bridge is great for Merida too! Some green scents are cleaner, more floral, or girlier than others, but CB sounds like it's all about a ""deep in the forest"" interpretation of green."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,adragonisnoslave,2,Thu Jul 16 14:49:50 2015 UTC,"What would anyone in the Dresden Files wear? Points for Lea, Lash, Molly, Tera, or Harry. Or Thomas."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,PhyrraNyx,2,Thu Jul 16 14:23:25 2015 UTC,"Molly would wear Fyrinnae Velociraptor, Inappropriate Popsicles and Birb of Paradise in her more rebellious days. More recently I can see her wearing Wizards' Wedding Cake and Serene Highness.      I could see Thomas using Luxury as a liner."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,Laurensics,2,Fri Jul 17 03:38:52 2015 UTC,"What would the women of Dragon Age wear? Shale, Cassandra Pentaghast, Leliana, Josephine Montilyet and all the other awesome women."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,hermeownie,4,Thu Jul 16 14:32:00 2015 UTC,"Hermione Granger would be a huge fan of Madcap Garden because it has strong tea notes, and at the same time is very ""bright"" ;)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lgbtqbbq,3,Thu Jul 16 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"Arya from ASOIAF would wear Riverside Hayride from Solstice Scents. It's a damp, dirty floral scent that makes me think of a highborn girl who has been roughing it for the last several years."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,Estridde,2,Fri Jul 17 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"The Thing on the Doorstep by H. P. Lovecraft's Asenath Waite would totally wear (if anything since it's a dude in a girl's body, but whatever) Darling Clandestine's Mishigami."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,Palindr0mic,2,Fri Jul 17 00:16:30 2015 UTC,"I think Tonks would like Beauty Queen and Pipsqueak from Smelly Yeti, bright bubbly smells just like her. And she'd be all over duochromes, all of the duochromes, and things like NM's Changling lip colours."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,Palindr0mic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:27:20 2015 UTC,"What would the Jurassic World characters wear? (Owen, Claire, Barry, Blue, Indominus Rex etc)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,lgbtqbbq,3,Fri Jul 17 09:16:42 2015 UTC,"Owen would wear Nocturne Alchemy Eternal Egypt Anniversary because it's a little earhty, a little aquatic, musky, and super manly and sexy.  Claire would wear Silver Ginger by Possets because it's restrained and smooth and elegant but ginger (duh)  The dinosaurs would wear shit from the new Nocturne Alchemy dinosaur collection :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dhecq,Palindr0mic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:25:25 2015 UTC,There's a dinosaur collection?! Welp so much for saving money this month. Noodles are a balanced diet right?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,zebratwat,12,Thu Jul 16 02:26:39 2015 UTC,"This just reminded me that I want to smell like a cherry limeaid, specifically from Sonic."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,krysiefishie,4,Thu Jul 16 02:41:45 2015 UTC,"we don't have sonic here. You should try Alchimia apothercary's magma, it's a strawberry lemonade type scent, reminds me of red jolly ranchers."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,normalcypolice,4,Thu Jul 16 02:45:57 2015 UTC,I've been meaning to make a cherry limeade scent! It's one of my favorite summertime drinks.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,krysiefishie,2,Thu Jul 16 17:36:07 2015 UTC,Doooo it! I would be sure to buy it. I want to be a cherry limeaid.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,normalcypolice,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:01:14 2015 UTC,The dollar store sometimes sells the frozen ones and they're SO much better than the Sonic variety.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,krysiefishie,3,Thu Jul 16 18:11:07 2015 UTC,"Oh I will have to keep an eye out! It's super hot today so I could use a little refreshment. I don't know if you partake in alcoholic beverages, but cherry limeaid margaritas are life."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,normalcypolice,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"I do not! But it's a great flavor combo, so that makes sense."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,birdsnbacteria,2,Thu Jul 16 11:26:37 2015 UTC,"I have Mojito from Lou Lou's, it's really nice! The mint in it is spearmint which makes it nice and sweet against the sharpness of the lime. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,birdsnbacteria,5,Thu Jul 16 18:01:46 2015 UTC,I'm sure you've heard of Sixteen92's Theda? Supposed to smell like sangria and it's my personal favorite of their summer collection.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,-drbadass-,5,Thu Jul 16 02:31:05 2015 UTC,"mmm that description sounds delicious. I'm hesitant though because I've never had a sixteen92 scent work for me, they all either give me a terrible headache or have one strange note amped up too much."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,QoSN,3,Thu Jul 16 02:46:32 2015 UTC,"Oh no, that's too bad! Well maybe not that one, then :/   Good luck with your search!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,-drbadass-,8,Thu Jul 16 03:01:16 2015 UTC,Smelly Yeti Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is citrus and mint.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,Estridde,3,Thu Jul 16 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"It's lemon, though, not lime. I still think it's a fantastic scent, all the same! Unicorn collector is similar-- it's bubbly and tangy."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,all_FloatOn,3,Thu Jul 16 03:52:44 2015 UTC,It's still a drink-based scent though :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,homicidalunicorns,3,Thu Jul 16 03:55:35 2015 UTC,"I can't believe I didn't think to try this, I have a sample sitting untried in my pile"

I owned the sample for months before I tried it for whatever reason then proceeded to nearly burn through the sample in a little over a week. The dry, tart champagne scent is fantastic with the peach. The tartness fulfills my need for something lime-ish without having any lime."

Like an ice mermaid lightly boozing it up.  Edit: As for other fruity drinks, BPAL Bon Vivant comes to mind. It's fizzy (like, really fizzy smelling) strawberry champagne."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dgj9a,lithiumjuliet,2,Thu Jul 16 03:25:24 2015 UTC,"sea of ice sounds really awesome. I think I'm more interested in bon vivant, may need to get my hands on this."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,ariadneee,5,Thu Jul 16 02:36:59 2015 UTC,"Haus of Gloi's Samhain is anise-heavy and smells pretty strongly like licorice to me, with a bit of dry dirty leafiness. It was discontinued last year, but there are bottles floating around and for all I know they'll reformulate it this year."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,homicidalunicorns,5,Thu Jul 16 02:15:59 2015 UTC,If you can find them  Blooddrop - Creepy and Crawly -  Black licorice and vanilla marshmallow.  Possets Nessun Dorma - Caramel cooked to a sugary stage and wrapped around a core of old fashioned night-black licorice.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,valachase,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:19:59 2015 UTC,"Adding that to my Possets ""to try"" list for sure, thanks!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,valachase,2,Thu Jul 16 02:27:15 2015 UTC,I think I have a few black licorice scents I can decant you. PM me an address and I'll send some your way.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,shriekingmauve,5,Thu Jul 16 16:24:12 2015 UTC,"Arcana Genteel (Aniseed, 2 vanillas, dry amber, sugar, and cashmere musk with wisps of fine sandalwood and cedarwood.) is my favorite anise scent. It's soft and sweet, and fades down to a really interesting vanilla type scent. The anise is present, but it's not holding you down and punching you in the face. It's more... caressing your face lovingly. I actually don't even like anise, but I really enjoy Genteel.  Eta: Aaand now I see where someone else posted before me, but this took a long time to type on my phone so I'm leaving it haha"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,-drbadass-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:26:33 2015 UTC,OK I think I definitely need to sample Genteel!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,lgbtqbbq,5,Thu Jul 16 06:09:19 2015 UTC,Haus of Gloi also has Absinthe which is GC.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,Adonaea,5,Thu Jul 16 03:26:48 2015 UTC,"I like Black Mallow from Solstice Scents, it's fluffy anise sprinkles (if you've ever had the Dutch treat) + soft marshmallow.  For a bright, herbal anise, One Hand Washes the Other Absynthe is awesome, pungent, super green and zingy. It has peppermint, anise, and lemongrass, and I would say it's balanced but heavy on the anise. Love this one.  Another good one from OHWTO is Mercantile, which is dried cherries, dried tobacco and tea, and black licorice. Smells very strong and true, like old fashioned chewy hard licorice mixed with dried fruit and Dr. Pepper.  OHWTO is closed at the moment but both scents are general catalog. Black Mallow from SS is available and it's GC too.  Alkemia Trick or Treat is a super complex licorice gourmand with notes of orange peel and brown sugar as well as patchouli and vanilla. But it's sweet and on the skin it's not jumbled or bizarre or sharp. Just sweet and spicy. Very Halloweeny."

But it's sweet and on the skin it's not jumbled or bizarre or sharp. Just sweet and spicy. Very Halloweeny.   Trick or Treat is my favorite scent ever! But just FYI on my skin the tonka note overpowers everything after awhile. After a few hours it smells like tonka with a licorice base.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,buttersunset,3,Fri Jul 17 02:51:15 2015 UTC,Arcana's Genteel is a really nice aniseed scent!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,eraser_dust,2,Thu Jul 16 02:16:13 2015 UTC,That sounds amazing.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,RhinestoneHousewife,3,Thu Jul 16 02:26:50 2015 UTC,"For liquorice I can recommend Common Brimstone's 'All is Vanity': iris root, liquorice, gardenia, tuberose, baby powder  I got straight up liquorice from it (and unfortunately I don't care for liquorice), so if you want a sample to try I can send it to you :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,krysiefishie,3,Thu Jul 16 04:48:09 2015 UTC,"Let me see if I still have Alkemia's Seduction Cacao. It's liquorice & chocolate. BathSabbath's None More Black Licorice actually smells like black liquorice. PM me your address on Mon when I'm back in Indonesia. I hate liquorice so much, they're yours for free."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,-drbadass-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:41:46 2015 UTC,I would be more than happy to remove the offending items from your presence :P
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,krysiefishie,2,Thu Jul 16 10:27:38 2015 UTC,Rhinestone Mummy also has some licorice and aniseed.  http://www.therhinestonehousewife.com/products/product-detail.php?iid=136  And Absinthe by Arcana:  http://www.therhinestonehousewife.com/products/product-detail.php?iid=5
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,-drbadass-,2,Thu Jul 16 02:40:51 2015 UTC,"I have the scent Interlude from Blooddrop and it is supposed to smell like black tea, vanilla pastry, and strawberry jam, and it's straight up licorice on my skin. So sad for me, possibly good for you."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,starward-,2,Thu Jul 16 02:43:53 2015 UTC,I think Blooddrop's black tea note just does that - I have Kelpie which is cocoa and black tea and it definitely has a licorice vibe.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,starward-,2,Thu Jul 16 03:10:38 2015 UTC,"It made me so sad, because I love the notes and hate the perfume. I blind bought a FS bottle in a destash."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,starward-,2,Thu Jul 16 03:11:33 2015 UTC,I'm not really into the idea of licorice perfume but I do like Kelpie - it's weird but something about it makes you keep smelling it.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,QoSN,2,Thu Jul 16 03:27:45 2015 UTC,Haus of Gloi has Absinthe which I'm not sure if you have tried but is one I love?
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,QoSN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:45:11 2015 UTC,Ohhhh that sounds promising!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,weepy,2,Thu Jul 16 06:18:03 2015 UTC,I think it's a really realistic scent! If you want to try some I can maybe decant some of my sample for you? (I say maybe cause I'm not 100% what the fill level is and how much I actually have left). I know conversion is total shit right now so if you wanna try before you buy I'm happy to enable!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dggqq,Sakecat22,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:25:48 2015 UTC,I can totally swap you some Shiro eyeshadow samples for a decant. I'll make you a list of what I have when I get home!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dfs4m,mightymai,4,Wed Jul 15 22:45:19 2015 UTC,"Mai! Your hair looks super cute! AAAH.  Okay, aside from that, I have the newer packaging, and I'm not a huge fan of the eyeliner applicator (it takes longer to apply, plus eyeshadow gets on the provided brush), but at least it minimizes spillage. That dropper vial is still being used for the ChromaGlows (and I apply them exactly the way you applied the Liquid Stardust here), but yesterday, I spilled half of my vial while applying it. BOO.  Overall, I like both formulas, but neither packaging floats my boat."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dfs4m,sihaya09,2,Wed Jul 15 23:22:17 2015 UTC,Thank you!!!  I was thinking about the packaging too. I wonder if it would work in packaging with a reducer like this http://www.qosmedix.com/pages/product/131/29610/Reducer-Natural-for-29607.aspx so it would be shaken out and it wouldn't spill as readily
Indiemakeupandmore,3dfs4m,sihaya09,3,Wed Jul 15 23:29:28 2015 UTC,"That would be AWESOME for the ChromaGlows, definitely!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dfs4m,mermaidunicornhybrid,2,Wed Jul 15 23:33:56 2015 UTC,"I have been trying to do videos for a while now and here's my first one on an indie product. Feel free to give any constructive criticism, things you think would make it flow better, etc!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dfs4m,mermaidunicornhybrid,3,Wed Jul 15 22:46:14 2015 UTC,"I love your blog! I found that you weren't as emotive in this video as you come across in your writing. I felt like I wasn't seeing any personality. That said, your info is awesome and you spoke clearly and concisely (which feels like a rarity in vlogs!)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dfs4m,toxidlotus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:48:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the feedback! I seriously appreciate it so much. I think I'm a little stiff right now since I'm still getting comfortable in front of the camera (I'm only just starting to look at the lens instead of the viewfinder haha) and I'm hoping to be a little more natural as I get more comfortable. I'm a little cautious about rambling, which might make me a little less emotive but I'll definitely work to find a balance between brevity and personality!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dfs4m,mermaidunicornhybrid,2,Thu Jul 16 04:02:48 2015 UTC,"I was actually really impressed with now NOT rambly you were. I would have just been spouting nonsense, likely."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dfs4m,mermaidunicornhybrid,2,Thu Jul 16 04:04:09 2015 UTC,haha thanks so much! I do have general information written down on a writing pad that I refer to so that helps keep me on the straight and narrow. I am hoping to keep my videos around 5 min or less so I can be sure to give enough info but don't overload people (plus shorter videos are so much quicker to do close captioning!)
Indiemakeupandmore,3dfs4m,sihaya09,2,Thu Jul 16 04:08:48 2015 UTC,Your hair is adorable! I've seen these swatched and the color you have is the one I want most. It's such a pretty color. Your video review was really clear and the lighting was good. You could definitely tell you were wearing it on your eyes. =] Good job!

Indiemakeupandmore,3df17y,12oo,4,Wed Jul 15 20:34:28 2015 UTC,Yes hello hi I do believe I need that corpsey grey green for reasons
Indiemakeupandmore,3df17y,kazaanabanana,3,Thu Jul 16 00:38:23 2015 UTC,That's the only one I want from this collection. I think I'm getting to the point where my collection is large enough that I just don't need anymore.
Indiemakeupandmore,3df17y,Absinthe42,8,Thu Jul 16 01:35:28 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to feel the same way re: having enough eyeshadow. I will probably pick up a couple of samples in addition to the grey green one (my mom wants the bright purple, and I'm partial to the red and mustard gold shades), but I'm not OMG OMG DROOLING over this, you know? Especially since I feel like Shiro's formula, while good for many of their finishes, isn't the best in the indie world."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df17y,kazaanabanana,6,Thu Jul 16 01:40:22 2015 UTC,"This. I quite like the looks of the purples/reds...but I didn't immediately go 'wow' like I often do with Fyrinnae, for example. I was bowled over by how much I liked the Avengers collection from Shiro...but this one isn't getting me. Maybe it's the fact that they all seem to be matte/matte-ish? Not as bombastic as the duochrome or glitter bomb? Meh- more for everyone else! Shiro is still my first real indie love:)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3df17y,katycups,7,Thu Jul 16 04:42:34 2015 UTC,"I pretty much feel the same way. I've been lukewarm about pretty much everything Shiro is putting out, and I just think it's because I have SO MUCH."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df17y,Absinthe42,3,Thu Jul 16 02:09:51 2015 UTC,I'm kind of hoping it'll be lip-safe because I really really want that as a gloss (I feel like it'd be disgustingly unflattering but I'm into that).
Indiemakeupandmore,3df17y,pyjamasquid,2,Fri Jul 17 03:30:02 2015 UTC,Ohhhh I really hope this is what I think it is

Indiemakeupandmore,3df17y,blushbby,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:33:04 2015 UTC,"I feel like it could totally be a Harry Potter collection! The mustard and red look like Gryffindor colours. There's a dark green for Slytherin. The light blue with lavender duochrome could be ""Patronus"". The purple could be for Dumbledore. The rosey neutral could be inspired by Hermione."

Indiemakeupandmore,3de5a6,jo_maho,3,Wed Jul 15 15:48:32 2015 UTC,"Hi guys! This is my first ever indie haul, from Shiro. This is also my first ever photo/link post, so I apologize if it looks funky/if I'm not doing it right.    So far I've only tried out ""Doge"" and ""I Tried"" over my Milani eye primer, and I already love them 10 times more than my non-indie shadows!! Caitlin threw in ""Master of Whispers"" and ""Filth"" as freebies - she obviously knew I was on the search for some good purples. I have the Gelato Beach gloss on right now, and I have to say, I am super impressed with the color and formula. This is an incredibly flattering shade, and it isn't even remotely sticky but seems to last a long time, for a gloss! I got the pink frosting ""flavoring,"" and it smells great.    I decanted all of my samples into (sanitized!) bead jars, as you can see. Since I'm still totally new to indies, I figured this would be the easiest way to start using them. If you have any advice or constructive criticism, please let me know!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3de5a6,hermeownie,2,Wed Jul 15 15:54:21 2015 UTC,That's awesome! Shiro was my first haul too and I'm still addicted to them and their amazing quality! What shade is your favorite?
Indiemakeupandmore,3de5a6,Mseeeee,5,Wed Jul 15 15:51:47 2015 UTC,"I love ""I Tried,"" I don't have anything else like it in my collection - it really is a true rose gold! But I'm also really excited to try out ""Cognitive Recalibration,"" it looks like such a gorgeous, rich color."
Indiemakeupandmore,3de5a6,Mseeeee,2,Wed Jul 15 16:19:26 2015 UTC,"Congrats! I have I Tried and Doge as well and absolutely love them! I Tried is a bit too metallicy/shimmery to get away with at my internship, but I love it when I'm at school. I use a little bit of Doge every day and seeing the label art on my counter makes me so happy! If you're on a purple kick, I recommend He Loves His Hammer as well. I haven't tried the other purples you have, but that gives me a pretty wash of color when I don't feel like going all neutral for at work. When I'm at school, I love doing a little gold like Mockingjay on the inside corner of my eye, He Loves His Hammer on the lid, and a darker purple on the outside corner (usually A Push in the Right Direction). I love Shiro so much :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3de5a6,smearedgoth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:51:57 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the recommendation!! I saw He Loves His Hammer and I almost added it to this order - I'll have to put it on the next one. Basically all of my beauty budget is going to Shiro next month, too lol. I'm on sort of a low-buy, but now that I've tried these out I feel like I need a few more in different color families! And I definitely need a couple more of the lip glosses - do you have any Shiro lip colors that you love?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3de5a6,SCurry34,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"And the samples are only a dollar too! My personal favorite eyeshadow from Shiro is Glowstick of Destiny which looks kinda meh on the site but it is fabulous! I have warm undertones and light blue eyes so it looks like it wouldn't work but the moment you put it on with primer or Pixie Epoxy, you get this really strong wonderful golden duochrome to pop out. My mom doesn't like crazy colors on me, but she loves this one and was really surprised to see that it's an ice blue color in the bag. I do more eyeshadows than lip products but I do have A Girl and A Cat tinted balm which makes my lips a nice berry color and smells like cookie batter heaven but is patchy and slidy on my lips. I'm jealous of people who can pull them off because most pics I see of them are wonderful. I also have a custom gloss in Mushroom which is being discontinued soon and it's a very nice metallic-y coppery red on me. I haven't really tried any other glosses yet!"

The FB hasn't been updated since a few days after my order was made and my FB message hasn't been responded to. I did finally try to contact them through the shop page as well (no response yet but it was today), but I'm concerned about the lack of activity."

Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,i_am_a_cyborg,6,Thu Jul 16 00:27:55 2015 UTC,I just checked some FB posts (I thought I saw a month TAT on there) and they said the TAT was around two months (that was in April) and would remain so for a while. I think I'll hang in there since I've already waited so long.

Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,i_am_a_cyborg,4,Wed Jul 15 23:07:00 2015 UTC,"They are more of a light detangler. Of course, they smell fanatastic. I can compare them to BV Phyto Mist and Cocoa Pink Ends with Benefits which I think are more conditioning. So it depends on whether you want a light detangler (then they are great) or a more conditioning spray (go for Black Violet or Cocoa Pink)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,pondicus,2,Thu Jul 16 01:05:59 2015 UTC,Ooh what flavour do you have? I was thinking of getting one in either Grimm or Black Sugar when my giant camellia oil bottle is finished aka it is so forever-taking.
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,i_am_a_cyborg,3,Thu Jul 16 02:54:25 2015 UTC,"Lolita, and I got the Sea Salt Spray in The Orchard Keeper. I got those scents because they are nice ones to use in my little girl's long tangly hair."

Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,sincerelysabby,3,Thu Jul 16 03:14:56 2015 UTC,I just got a sample of their Grimm perfume and I must say it's one of my new faves. I love it!
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,pondicus,2,Thu Jul 16 06:02:08 2015 UTC,"Ooh is it very earthy on you? I heard it's a non-sweet version of Paper Moon, which is what I'm kind of looking for."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,sincerelysabby,3,Thu Jul 16 06:04:58 2015 UTC,"Yes! It's like I've been rolling around in nature without being grassy. Just a sorta deep, but light naturey scent. It also has a tiny bit of chocolate scent that doesn't make it sweet but adds to the deepness of the scent. I feel like I'm deep within some woods on warm day!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,ltdaaanicecream,2,Thu Jul 16 06:47:54 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I am definitely looking for something lighter. How long lasting is the scent? Thanks for your help!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,ltdaaanicecream,2,Thu Jul 16 03:38:44 2015 UTC,Cool! Can't wait to hear your thoughts. What scent did you pick up?
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,sincerelysabby,2,Thu Jul 16 04:28:11 2015 UTC,"I have it in Blood and Honey as well as Southern Gothic. I like both because the scents are pretty mild, but I'm a lover of all things honey so B&H is my number one! The back of my head is always a rats nest and these do a pretty good job at letting me get through the knots without being to heavy on my hair."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,ltdaaanicecream,3,Thu Jul 16 06:00:30 2015 UTC,Mmm Blood and Honey is so drippy good! I definitely have to try one of these; thanks for sharing your experience.

I was hesitating whether to even ask about this and chocked it up to slow international shipping (I'm in the U.S.), but upon checking out a few other threads here I'm starting to get worried. I'm not even sure what to do in this scenario, since there is no tracking on sample packs and I've never had an issue with shipping from them or any other indie company before. If anyone has any advice, I'm all ears!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,unthriftyloveliness,2,Wed Jul 15 23:57:26 2015 UTC,"No, I haven't yet! I was planning to, I just wanted to gauge whether I was just being a worry wart or not. Thank you, though.    edit: Also my only worry about contacting the post office is that the package has no tracking, thus I don't know what they can tell me... /is totally a worry wart -_-"
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,gottapoopy,3,Thu Jul 16 00:06:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, still check with your local post office. I ordered during the presale too and I got my order a long time ago (CA based). I also had shipping issues where it supposedly had the wrong forwarding address. It took them an extra week to deliver. Best bet is to work with USPS and inform Sophie too."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,unthriftyloveliness,2,Thu Jul 16 01:05:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll do that tomorrow! I'm glad you got your order and thanks for this! Hopefully I can get some answers from USPS..."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,toxidlotus,2,Thu Jul 16 02:00:51 2015 UTC,My packages usually take up to a couple of weeks from Femme Fatale to get to me once they ship. It might still be in transit.
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,unthriftyloveliness,2,Thu Jul 16 00:17:54 2015 UTC,"could be! It's been about five weeks though, but that is entirely possible and I really hope that's the case because the pretties..."

I mean, I've been hemming and hawwing over whether I should because I kept thinking, ""I'll give it another week.""

I'm in Canada and my package took over a month to ship to me. I emailed the owner about it and 2 weeks was supposed to be the norm so she sent me out a replacement package, but that too took a month to arrive. So long shipping times can happen even if they say its 'unusual'. Still, I'd email Sophie just in case :)"

Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,unthriftyloveliness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:05:16 2015 UTC,"Update: I just called the post office and they gave me a line about things being stuck at customs for months on end and how there's really no way of knowing without a tracking number. Granted, I led the conversation by telling them I didn't have a tracking number... Should I call back later and just ask if they have anything under my name/address? I also just emailed Sophie about it, so fingers crossed.  This combined with a screwed up Etsy order (ordered a t-shirt, shop was closed before it shipped, got to me but the design was wrong, emailed the store owner and was promised a replacement but have gotten zilch, emailed again and have been met with radio silence so I just filed a claim on etsy...) have stressed me out a little bit this week. But I'm hoping at least this can be resolved easily."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,Calm_Sapphire,5,Thu Jul 16 19:15:37 2015 UTC,Just curious - anyone get their Christmas in July orders from AFK yet? I'm really excited for mine.

Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,liebeliebe,6,Thu Jul 16 06:58:05 2015 UTC,"Can someone please explain how to order from Arcana? There's 3 different sites (and eBay?), but do they all have different scents? Which one is the best price? (I'm located in the U.S.) :0"
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,Sixkitties,5,Thu Jul 16 02:59:37 2015 UTC,"So, arcana sells wholesale, meaning that they don't have their own site and only sell bulk through distributors. So what the distubutors has is stock from their bulk order.their eBay page is directly through them and usually whatever they have left from the bulk orders.  As for who sales it cheapest... I don't know. I think they're  all pretty close. Shipping might be different per place though. (:  Edit: here's their list, I believe there's a few more places (Rhinestone Housewife), that also sells their items."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,liebeliebe,3,Thu Jul 16 03:16:15 2015 UTC,Thank you!! You helped so much :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,kadytheredpanda,6,Thu Jul 16 03:29:37 2015 UTC,"I ordered a full size Shiro gloss with my last order. When it arrived, it was leaking a little even in the shrink wrap, but let it slide because it did arrive on a very hot day. It's still seeping if the tube is even slightly put at an angle. Pretty certain I've got a defective tube. Is there anything I can do besides replacing (it was the Nic Cage COTM one), or should I just try and keep it upright?  I've contacted Shiro twice in two weeks with no answer"
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,montycuddles,5,Thu Jul 16 03:43:29 2015 UTC,I'd say contact them through a different format if you haven't yet (such as Facebook or Instagram). That really sucks you haven't gotten am answer. It sounds like they've had some quality control issues with their glosses lately. :/
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,electriczero,5,Thu Jul 16 04:11:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not a perfume person but whenever I see perfume threads on here people are all like ""it smells like this and this with a note of this, etc."" and I'm just sitting here being very impressed. How are you guys able to tell all the scents that go into the perfume? How did you guys get so knowledgeable about this?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,homicidalunicorns,6,Thu Jul 16 06:29:21 2015 UTC,"I tried a lot of different things, and try to smell different things IRL, like plants at a garden store or essential oils in health food stores.  You can really only gain experience through practice, and it helps to try different perfumes that share one or two notes, or to find a scent that's very strong on one note- it'll help you recognize that note in other scents. This happened to me with Possets Death. It has a strong vetiver note, which before I'd always been puzzled by, but since trying it (and falling totally in love) vetiver has been way easier to notice.  That said! Some scents are just really well-blended, and it can be really difficult to pick out individual notes if they're not intentionally emphasized. For those, I go by feel. This feels floral, this feels fruity, this feels woody. Some notes also give off feelings of coolness or warmth, and that can be helpful too."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,birbvice,5,Thu Jul 16 14:31:04 2015 UTC,"I was 100% against perfume before I got on here and was lured in, so I didn't know any scents. As someone still fairly new to the world of perfume, I'd say it's easier to gain experience once you try perfumes and look at the notes -- like ah, this really weird plant smell might be rhododendron. Also, I pay more attention to smells I encounter now. I may have also wandered around a Yankee candle store and a Bath & Body Works shop smelling everything (now I know teakwood and jasmine!!). A non-indie friend told me to try a bunch of perfumes in department stores.   I feel like it's harder to learn/imagine new smells than new sights, sounds or tastes, which is why actually trying things is important."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,elephantabate,5,Thu Jul 16 07:07:57 2015 UTC,"Practice. Smelling lots of scents, researching notes, and being interested enough to care. For me, it's passion driven. I've been at this for umpteen years, so it becomes second nature, although I occasionally have to look up an uncommon note to see how it is supposed to smell so I can find it in a blend.    Over time you learn what works with your skin. If you have a perfume you do like, look at the notes, and try others with some notes in common. In time you learn that some notes nearly always, or never, work for you, and others are great.   But yeah, ultimately it's a matter of being able to predict what will work, and as with any prediction, there is a margin of error. It just has to be worth it to you to try it, and if it's not, that's OK too. :)    I actually find the same think about makeup. Even with opacity, so much depends on lighting and skin tone that it's hard for me to determine if it would look nice on me. I'm also not as brave with color, so I look at the challenge pics and think, ""this is awesome!"" and go back to perfume."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,j-dusk,2,Thu Jul 16 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"I realized the other day that I was kind of trained for it from when I was as young as 12 or 13 and my wine-loving parents would have me smell their wine and describe the scent. Or they'd describe it to me and then have me sniff. It wasn't a big leap to go from identifying fruits and woods and such in wine to being able to pick out similar notes and textures in perfume. When I was younger I also habitually sniffed flowers, candles, spices, lotions, basically everything. When I was a kid and my mom took me into a bath & bodyworks or anything similar I was a pain in the butt because I had to smell EVERYTHING.  Mostly though, it's a matter of experience with trying a note several times in different perfumes until you recognize it. There were a lot of notes I wasn't familiar with when I started trying perfume, but after smelling them a few times in various blends, I was able to pick them out. Shared notes between blends are helpful.  Even if there are a lot of unfamiliar notes, a vocabulary for scent can help. For example, I'm not great at identifying florals outside of a few obvious ones. But I can describe a floral as smooth, sharp, dry, sweet, dewy, humid, creamy, waxy, powdery, leafy, green, spicy, heady, etc. Sometimes I'll look up a note to see how other people describe it, and I'll figure out what I'm smelling that way."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,stubbytuna,4,Thu Jul 16 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for it, but I have a question that's been kind of bugging me so I'll try my luck here!  I recently got into perfumes, all I own is summer stuffy from sixteen92 and I want to expand my perfume horizons so to speak. I like grasses, jasmine, patchouli, sandalwood, and aquatic or musky type scents - though not all together probably. I'm also really into my Paper Moon and Theda samples.  So back to my questions: I've been eyeing Posset's Seascape because it sounds really interesting but I'm wondering how ... obvious the cannabis scent is? Coconut + aquatics sounds awesome, I just don't want to smell like a grateful dead concert and I don't think you can buy samples. Does anyone have experience with this perfume? Also, if anyone has any recommendations of perfumes I should try, I'd love to hear it. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,homicidalunicorns,5,Wed Jul 15 20:30:09 2015 UTC,"Seascape: The reviews on the Possets forum have been really positive! One talked about the cannabis note specifically, saying it worked more to give the scent a slight earthy/woodsy undertone."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,stubbytuna,3,Wed Jul 15 20:39:00 2015 UTC,Ooh! I was hoping it would be a grassy/earthy tone but I've never had a cannabis perfume so I wanted to make sure. I'll definitely read the reviews on the Possets forum. Thank you!
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,homicidalunicorns,3,Wed Jul 15 20:49:00 2015 UTC,No problem. Their review forum has been super helpful for me.  And welcome to the scented kingdom~
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,rekhiebaby,2,Wed Jul 15 20:50:19 2015 UTC,"I tried it out the other day and posted my first impressions in another thread. I like the cannabis a lot and it doesn't smell like weed, or even something earthy like patchouli to me. Oddly enough, there's a bit of a plastic smell at first, but that dies down and the coconut comes out a lot. The aquatic notes aren't very present on my skin, but I think they tie the coconut and cannabis together quite well. I'm probably going to grab a bottle of this once I test my decant some more, but so far so good!  edit: spelling"
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,stubbytuna,2,Thu Jul 16 01:15:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting! Admittedly, I have no idea what to expect with cannabis listed as a scent so that's what I was wondering about. Sounds like it's a lot more interesting/complex than I originally thought.  Sounds like a really good scent, I'm thinking I'm going to pick up a bottle. Thanks for your help!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,rekhiebaby,3,Thu Jul 16 01:19:13 2015 UTC,"No prob! The coconut is quite sweet and less nutty, at least on my skin. There should be more reviews of the Possets Summer collection in the next couple weeks once people get their decants from Ajevie."

It looks great on my NC35? sister, I haven't tried it on my eyes. Wayward Prince is lovely but the base color barely shows up on my eyelids, I need to try it over a glitter glue. I'm like NC30 and olive but my eyelids are pigmented. I want to try Seven Lost Lords because the base color seems similar but slightly darker.  Also, I have the same problem as you with RHE, it makes me look like a pastel disco ball and while that sounds cool it's not exactly a great eye look lol."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,pondicus,3,Thu Jul 16 02:29:37 2015 UTC,"I'll have to try Sunfire - I gave away my sample of it, thinking it's be too pink on me, but the gold is beautiful!   The Wayward Prince on me looks like the twin of my other FF love Rampage - which is great, but I was gunning for that gold sheen :(  I'll check out Seven Lost Lords in the meantime - the AUD dollar being so terrible against the USD means I'm more likely to throw my money at FF. Yay?  Booooo to pastels :(( Our skintones just don't like it!"

I'll see if I can get a picture of Sunfire on me, tomorrow, if you want. :)   What primer do you use? FF's is really good, it brings out the duochrome without making it as strong as a glitter glue. The gold sheen is visible on me with their primer and gg, but not so much the base color.  Ugh, exchange rates, my country's currency has been losing value this past year or so. FF is the most convenient indie shop for me too, at the moment, so yay FF!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,CiaoBonefish,2,Wed Jul 15 23:51:08 2015 UTC,"My skintone is somewhere between NC25 and NC30, and No Men Like Me is more of a lighter goldish color on me. It's too light for me to wear personally. Not sure if that helps you when it comes to seeing if it will work with your skin tone, but I thought I would mention it. It is a crazy duochrome though, if not a bit finicky to work with."

I've always loved your FOTDs :)  I've had my eye on No Men Like Me for ages, so I might just bite the bullet and get a sample at least.

Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,unthriftyloveliness,2,Thu Jul 16 01:31:25 2015 UTC,I also just thought of Fyrinnae's Shenanigans. It's a gold flash over a darker base so maybe that will work better?

Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,iAsymptotic,3,Thu Jul 16 06:15:59 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty acne-prone and want to get some hair oil (I have thick, frizzy, wavy hair), but am afraid it will break out my cheeks/neck where my hair touches it. I was looking into Haus of Gloi and got pretty overwhelmed with the amount of available fragrances, I have no idea which one to pick.  Any advice or recommendations?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,lgbtqbbq,8,Wed Jul 15 22:11:29 2015 UTC,"Regarding your breakout issues: You should always patch test things like coconut oil because they are simple to find and if you find you are allergic/sensitive/it causes breakouts, you can avoid all coconut-oil heavy products in the future (this is an example bc coconut oil is problematic for many AND HoG contains it.)  So smear some coconut oil around your hairline and see what happens. Look up patch testing in the /r/SkincareAddiction sidebar.  There are a ton of ingredients in the hair oil though, so you can't do that for every ingredient. If i were you I'd buy a bottle of Aether, test it out, and then it will be easily swappable (it's unscented.) I have Aether and it works well; I mix it with whatever perfume I want that day and it becomes a custom-scented hair oil.  If you are not a switch it up all the time person, then just ask yourself if you enjoy your hair smelling fruity, vanilla, woodsy, floral, or like a dessert. Narrow down accordingly."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,starward-,3,Wed Jul 15 22:39:01 2015 UTC,"I'd tend to agree with /u/lgbtqbbq that patch testing is your friend! But if it helps my skin is rather prone to breaking out in response to new products and I've never had an issue with hair oils but I do take the less is more approach. If I completely slather my hair in oil and leave it on for a day or two (I'm jobless right now, so I can actually just soak my hair in oil for funsies) I do notice I will get some breakouts on my neck near my hairline."

Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,QoSN,3,Wed Jul 15 22:39:44 2015 UTC,Could someone give me the pros and cons of solid perfumes vs oils?
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,rekhiebaby,5,Thu Jul 16 03:36:21 2015 UTC,"For me, solids are more portable but there is less throw and development of the scent on the skin. For those who don't want their perfume noticeable (or as noticeable) by others, solids can be a good choice.   Bottles of oil have the potential to leak in your purse/bag depending on the packaging, plus the glass bottles can break. The throw and longevity is generally greater and you will probably notice the scent changing and becoming more or less complex as it wears."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,electriczero,2,Thu Jul 16 04:14:57 2015 UTC,What brush do you use to apply a loose blush? (I'm new to indie makeup.)
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,teenadee,3,Thu Jul 16 06:25:55 2015 UTC,"What's worked for me personally is a duofiber stippling brush - anything that looks like this, basically. It helps you to avoid picking up too much color, and really helps to buff it into the skin!  I also saw a comment somewhere that said someone used a really fluffy tapered blush brush like the Real Techniques one, but tapped the end of the blush very lightly into the powder, tapped the back of her hand to knock some of the pigment off, and then applied it as normal."
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,sincerelysabby,2,Thu Jul 16 06:47:40 2015 UTC,Are there any shimmery eye shadows that aren't super glittery? While all the shadows I see are very lovely in color I think the glitter just doesn't scream adult everyday wear to me. I think it also irritates my eyes a little. I do like a little shimmer and a teeeeensy bit of glitter is okay~
Indiemakeupandmore,3df5ou,capnsexypants,9,Thu Jul 16 06:29:32 2015 UTC,I've found that Baroque does very nice shimmery eye shadows that aren't glittery. Good Doggy and Death of Marat are the ones that come to mind for me as being shimmery and not glittery!

Out of the ones I own (those three are on the way now), Shiro's No Men Like Me is a nice matte gold, and I find Beyond the Fence also a bit more low-key."

Indiemakeupandmore,3dejoq,PhyrraNyx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:23:39 2015 UTC,I was actually really surprised how heavy the lime is in Nacre. I was expecting a white floral with a light twist of lime but I'd classify it as a lime perfume with white floral in the background. The floral is getting a bit heavier as it ages but it's stayed a true lime scent to me. I'm really not big on florals so I was pleasantly surprised with Nacre. And Arcana's lime note is my favorite so far :)

Indiemakeupandmore,3ddrux,Pastel-Princess,10,Wed Jul 15 14:05:10 2015 UTC,"You'll want a primer and a glitter adhesive for the best effects, especially if you have duochromes.  Short Version: Order Pixie Epoxy or Glitter Glue, but in the meantime, try ELF glitter glue. Also get a primer; I suggest Wet N Wild for something super affordable yet very good.    Long Version:  For adhesives: definitely still get Pixie Epoxy/Glitter Glue, but maybe pick up ELF's glitter glue? It's decent, not great, but it's cheap and will be a good holdover while you wait for your P.E. to arrive. I would say that Too Faced Glitter Glue is closer to Pixie Epoxy/DG Glitter Glue; from what I've read, the Shadow Insurance is more of a primer than an adhesive. If you make a DG order, I suggest ordering the Superstar Serum as well; it's great for foiling for liners, and her turnaround time is long (so you might as well order it now)  As far as basic primers, since you definitely need one, here are some popular non-indie ones: Urban Decay Primer Potion, Too Faced Shadow Insurance, NARS Smudgeproof, Wet N Wild Fergie ""For my primas"", and I think Milani has one as well. I personally have the NARS and Wet N Wild ones, and I like them. I prefer the NARS one for matte looks, and Wet N Wild for anything with shimmer or glitter (as it's much stickier). There are a few indie primers as well; Fyrinnae, Eccentric Cosmetics, Femme Fatale, Darling Girl, and probably some others that I'm forgetting."

Indiemakeupandmore,3ddrux,tinyknives,3,Wed Jul 15 17:46:50 2015 UTC,"Another vote for the WNW Take On The Day primer; it's by far the best I've used.

I really do love Aromaleigh shadows over NYX eyeshadow base in Nude, it's the least finnicky and it works well on capturing all the sparkles. I don't wear a lot of glittery shadows but NARS eyeshadow base is amazing for a lot of my duochrome shadows, especially ones from Femme Fatale and the like. It's also the only product that will survive a night out for me without creasing/fading. It's expensive but luckily I'm kind of a hermit and don't need my eyeshadow to last 10+ hours on a regular day. :P   I usually use Wet N Wild if it's a regular day, it lasts through work which is really the only thing I care about. I've also heard great things about the ELF glitter glue as well, doesn't hurt to give it a shot!"

I found mine at Target.  WnW's Fergie primer's another good DS option.  I'm not sure if it was LE or not, but there was a glitter version of it as well.    My HG primer is NYX HD primer.  I have oily lids that are prone to creasing and it keeps everything put, all day, full stop.  Milani's eye primer is supposed to be very good too.    Another option is Maybelline Color Tattoos.

Indiemakeupandmore,3ddrux,dramatic___pause,2,Thu Jul 16 04:05:06 2015 UTC,"My everyday primer is Nyx HD shadow base. If I'm doing my full face, meaning I'm doing something fancy with my life, I tend to mix the Nyx HD and some Urban Decay Primer Potion. UDPP is super long lasting, but it dries too quickly for me to use by itself, so I usually mix the two half and half to give it some longevity.  For the glitter, unless you get a glitter adhesive, patting on the shadows or using a little bit of water (I sometimes clean brushes with a baby wipe between colors, and that's enough water for my purposes) helps to keep the sparkle prominent."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddrux,teacupocean,2,Thu Jul 16 21:56:11 2015 UTC,UDPP Sin and Original are my go to primers lately. I'd like to try the Nars primer at some point.
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddrux,dartigen,2,Fri Jul 17 01:30:43 2015 UTC,"I was using NYX HD, but for no reason you can't buy it in Australia and it's a total PITA to buy online. (I emailed them to ask if it was ever going to come out here and they basically said ""you already have the other primer"". Not really an answer...) It was good with everything but Blackbird mattes - but Blackbird mattes don't play nice with any of the primers I've tried, so that's not really an issue. I wasn't a fan of the doefoot applicator though - especially not when the tube started to run low.  I'm using  Smashbox Photo Finish 24 Hour now. It's still not easy to get (for no clear reason, Smashbox isn't stocked by smaller Mecca outlets) so I try to get an extra tube every time I go to Melbourne just in case, but it works well enough - it won't do much for a lot of Fyrinnae's shadows since they're so finicky, but most other duochromes will show up just fine over it. It does have to be used very sparingly though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddrux,themakeuplife,2,Fri Jul 17 07:09:54 2015 UTC,The best adhesive primer you'll find in stores is going to be Too Faced Glitter Glue at Sephora or Ulta. It's similar to Fyrinnae Pixie Epoxy or Darling Girl Glitter Glue. If PE is in Stock at Fyrinnae I'd say order it online instead! It's cheaper and you'll be supporting indies that way. Turn around time with Fyrinnae is usually pretty short.

I've been living paycheck to paycheck for some time, which is fine when you're 20 but I'm almost 24 and I kinda want to start thinking about ~the future~ and all. Plus, I've gotta get my wisdom teeth out, and that's $1500  So now I limit myself. My last purchases were from HoG, and I treated myself to an Aromaleigh Purchase for my birthday. And really, now I only buy things I can't live without--I'm probably going to grab a full size of sixteen92 Princess Party because that's my aesthetic but after that--nada.  The real thing for me right now is looking at my bank account and going ""Oh shit, I have$2000!"" That's killer. I like that a lot."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,bratchny,4,Wed Jul 15 13:49:26 2015 UTC,That is awesome!
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,DrogonUnchained,4,Wed Jul 15 13:53:14 2015 UTC,"It's so awesome. It's more or less going back down to $400 (my starting point) after the wisdom teeth go, but I've also got a months worth of summer paychecks (~$500 a week) to save back up. Now that I know I can do it, it's a lot less daunting."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,ashlya,3,Wed Jul 15 14:28:37 2015 UTC,"Oh mans, the joy of seeing money in the account is awesome. I'm also at that stage where it's like, ""I need to get my shit together."" I can't afford a house if I don't save!    One thing that I do is have some funds automatically pulled from my account after pay day. That way, the money's going to my savings and I can see how much is left that I can either use to pay bills or use as spending money. It seriously helps a lot!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,forespent,3,Wed Jul 15 15:35:03 2015 UTC,I love being able to look at a bank account with extra money in it! It feels great :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,homicidalunicorns,4,Wed Jul 15 14:09:12 2015 UTC,"It officially started about a month ago, but unofficially a few months? I sucked at it, though.  It's been okay. I've found that as I spend less (or nothing) on perfume and makeup, I gravitate towards spending on other things, but that's more a reordering of priorities. Instead of buying perfume or makeup despite already having varied collections, I put some of that money towards upgrading my wardrobe or towards travels. I did break it recently for the HoG Reverie, but only bought 2 things, one of which was a staple replacement (hair oil).  I'm forcing myself to go through ALL of my untested perfume samples (I only have about 20 left!)  and test + review them in-depth. No blog or anything, just reviews in ScentBase notes (slowly switching over to Evernote just for safe keeping). Going through them has really helped with:   Figuring out exactly what notes and scent genres I like and dislike, and what brands I mesh with. Forcing me to be brutal in my culling and choosy in my purchases- if I don't love a sample, it gets destashed. If I love it but don't LOVE it, I keep the sample around but don't upgrade. Then I don't upgrade immediately, but sit on it for a few months to see if I still feel the same way. Decluttering, obviously. In addition, seeing everything I've bought and not found worthy in a giant destash spreadsheet is helpful in a ""jfc why did I buy all of this"" way.   Also, instead of spending destash money on more shinies, I put most of it straight into savings. That's been nice."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,katycups,4,Wed Jul 15 13:57:48 2015 UTC,"Well done on the perfume samples! I still have a tonne just sitting there gathering dust. Plus, I like the way you talk about shopping your perfume collection as a sort of project- finding what you do/don't like! Then, it's less of a chore to wear everything to create empties, and more or a fun, rewarding activity! Kudos!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,katycups,5,Wed Jul 15 14:18:17 2015 UTC,"I had been on a low buy for about two months, and I think it went fairly well. What I've found is that setting a makeup budget really doesn't work for me, I just try to convince myself that just a little more is okay, that I will hold back next month, and then BOOM no money.   Instead, I've made a small list of things I really want that are coming out soon that I have permission to buy (like the Baroque Tortall collection), but just in moderation. I have a small wishlist that I keep updating and you would be amazed at how often I out something on there, then realise a few days later I want something else. Really helping with my impulse purchasing!  Unfortunately, my low buy coincided with finally getting into Hello Waffle Visage. I say unfortunately only because the dollar (AUD) is awful right now and I'm on a low buy, I'm stoked to get more Waffle products! I suppose I can only use this as a motivator: no buying eyeshadows, some are already coming!  Finally, I encourage everyone to start writing a list of expenditures. As I said, budgets don't work for me, but I was amazed to see just how much I was really spending on makeup and beauty products each month. It creates perspective!  My new goal is to try and somehow wear a blue or a green eyeshadow a few times a week. I have a tonne of those bright colours just sitting there unused. Maybe inner corner for the lighter ones, and lower lash liner for the others? Must make some empties."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,Inquisitions,4,Wed Jul 15 14:23:59 2015 UTC,"I officially began my low buy at the end of June. I'm moving to a new city as my SO got a job there, but I will not have a job when I get there, so that's first on my list It's been rough. I even added the Sixteen92 birthday sample set into a shopping cart, then sadly exited out. I browsed the exchange thread, even going as far to type out the things I wanted, then sadly exited out. No cheats yet though! At this point I just keep tell myself that if I buy something I will be spending rent money, not leisure money."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,mallowleaves,3,Wed Jul 15 15:41:02 2015 UTC,"My low buy has been on since May and it's going about as I expected? Maybe a little better; I still have a little extra money in my savings. My summer classes are finally over so I can focus on getting a job and then I'll have more wiggle room to spend on pretty things. But this has given me the chance to really consider my collection and how I want to build it (aside from lipstick, my current stash is pretty small) so I'm looking forward to carefully planned purchases and spreadsheets everywhere. Ah, bliss.   Also I've caved recently on perfume but man it's so good I can't bring myself to regret it. Super motivated to find that job though, that's for damn sure."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,bratchny,3,Wed Jul 15 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"At first I was on a low-buy, with the only caveat being I would only buy from sales but apparently every damn store I love decided to have a sale in July.   So now I am trying to start a low-buy where I am going to make a list of 15 items I know I want, if any of those items go on sale I can buy them during my LB otherwise I need to wait until September. The only other exceptions are: skincare, replacing empty HG products and a new foundation (I have a sample of the YSL Touche Eclat and I will probably break down and buy it, it's one of the nicest things I have ever put on my face)  I have 3 orders coming and they all seem to have fairly long TAT's so hopefully getting a package here and there throughout the next month or two will make it a bit easier to walk away from that checkout page."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,katycups,4,Wed Jul 15 13:42:41 2015 UTC,"That's how I see it: long TAT really works for me because I know there is something coming. Hey- maybe this will work out really well, because you go on a low buy until Black Friday, then give yourself a little wiggle room at your favourite stores!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,bratchny,3,Wed Jul 15 14:28:20 2015 UTC,I like how you think!
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,stubbytuna,4,Wed Jul 15 15:38:41 2015 UTC,"I do something similar!! I have a list of things I want to buy, and I can only buy what's on the list. I limit the list to 25, I have about 16 things on it right now. The item needs to be on the list for at least two weeks before I buy it, and usually by that time I'm not as interested and know I can wait until the end of my low-buy.  I'm in the same boat, except I JUST started to get into perfumes so there's a bunch of perfumes I want to try and it makes it hard. :c"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,SuffragetteCinci,2,Wed Jul 15 20:17:04 2015 UTC,"I started my low buy about two weeks after I started getting more seriously into makeup, as soon as I realized it would take years to go through the makeup I had already purchased.  This applies primarily to eyeliners and eye shadows, which I go through at a snails pace and the variety of temptation is greatest.  It's been two years since I bought my nyx taupe blush, using it as my primary daily contour I am just now starting to hit pan.  It would drive me absolutely crazy to have a bunch of makeup sitting in my drawers that I know I couldn't ever get the full value out of.  I am a pathological cheapskate."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,bratchny,2,Wed Jul 15 13:42:50 2015 UTC,"I hate being wasteful so I can feel you on that one. Although, I am mostly concerned with my cream and liquid formulation stuff and not so much my powders because they rarely go bad and can be easily and effectively sanitized."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,Jeffica,2,Wed Jul 15 13:51:48 2015 UTC,"I started my low buy in January, I knew a few valentines things were coming up so that's be the last things I buy. Once February was done, ive been on a strict no buy.    Its been pretty hard. There's been so many sales and new collections that have came out but I know I don't need anything.    A really useful thing ive started doing is ive catalogued what products make me insta buy, then go look if I have anything similar and how often I use it. It turns out ill buy purple anything and foody scents. The fact is though, I rarely wear purple and everytime I fall in love with foody scents, I end up hating them and they sit collecting dust :( I also have a jar full of things that are nearly empty/half empty and have days where I just use products from the jar. Everytime the jar is emptied, I'll look at what's been used up and how much I enjoyed using it up, or how looooong it took to get rid off it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,wakenda,2,Wed Jul 15 15:05:22 2015 UTC,"I officially started my low buy in late June. I gave myself two planned purchases and two ""floating"" purchases for the month, which is actually turning out to be a really sustainable amount for me. So far I've made one of my planned purchases (TTL's All Kill collection) and one of my floating purchases (during Leesha's Lacquers' 4th of July sale, with both a discount and a gwp), and I'm feeling really good about it. I'm planning on buying from Life's Entropy's anniversary sale later this month, but so far nothing has caught my eye for my final floating purchase, so unless something new is released I probably will just have the three this month, which makes me feel really good. Plus, I talked myself out of Sixteen92's birthday collection, so yay for that too!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,sillybits,2,Wed Jul 15 15:15:12 2015 UTC,"No buy since July 8th. No desire to spend so far. I made a spreadsheet of all my current makeup and perfumes and bath/body products with the original price and the price I paid for them, which is a really great way to see just how much money I've spent on it all. I also keep a perfume spreadsheet of what I like and dislike, including a destash list. Being organized with what I already have is a great way to assess if I really need more (I definitely don't). I have a few full size perfumes I want to buy, but they're general catalog items which makes it really easy to wait. I am going to try to get rid of ALL my destash items before I buy again. If I can't do that, then I'm at least holding off until Yule collections come out."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,aumerle,2,Wed Jul 15 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"I've been on an unofficial low buy since May, and I've been doing okay. Previous low/no buys failed because I would crack for flash sales/very LE items or spend all my money in makeupexchange. Since school ended, I've been building up a HUGE destash pile, which is good and helps me see how much stuff I don't use. This time, I gave myself permission to buy from specific sales (Arcana decants, Blackbird, HoG Reverie, LE), but I did fall off the wagon a bit. My $40 BodyNeeds order was okay, but I probably won't use the products much at all. I also have Visage every month. Typing this out, it's probably less of a low-buy and more of a curated wishlist. It's also helped to realize what other experiences I want to have rather than makeup-- my boyfriend wants to travel in August so I should be saving for that instead of buying five more hair oils."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,ashlya,2,Wed Jul 15 15:50:30 2015 UTC,"I was on a low-buy for awhile but then I fell right back into the rabbit hole when I started blogging. Now I have to go back on a low, or maybe no-buy because I'm going to be moving out to an apartment with the fiance and we need to buy furniture, plates, pans, cleaning supplies - literally, almost everything. I'm going to be hurting for cash for the rest of the year... :(    However, one thing that I find helps is shopping my stash! I've been getting myself to use more of my shadows and I'm falling in love with them all over again. Plus, I have enough to last me YEARS. I have also yet to finish a perfume, so my collection can last me awhile. If anything, I should only buy decants unless I can justify a FS besides just wanting it.    Wish me luck!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,gottapoopy,3,Wed Jul 15 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"Oh good luck! Moving is a pretty big milestone and it's good that you are keeping your expenses to a minimum with makeup!    If it helps, try to buy home goods through several rounds over the course of a couple of months. Do your research on the things you'll be buying too - good home deals pop out in January / February! If you buy everything at once, you might end up buying things that you ""think"" you need but you might not use it. This has saved my butt over and over (I been been moving every year for the last 7 years)! Wish you both all the best :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,TRexpert,2,Wed Jul 15 20:07:30 2015 UTC,"I usually follow a strict budget for all discretionary spending, but I gave myself double the amount to spend for my birthday month (June) in exchange for a no-buy this month. And I spent some money while traveling last week, so it's going to extending into a low/no-buy for August.  It's been pretty easy so far, actually. I made a big spreadsheet of all my perfumes and holy crap, I have a lot. So I'm going to be working on using stuff up for a while instead of buying new things to try all the time. There are definitely some perfume samples I have that have been barely tested, which is really silly."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,unluckyfolk,2,Wed Jul 15 16:31:29 2015 UTC,"I've technically been on a low-buy since February, but I've been on and off the wagon. I'm usually pretty good about being frugal, but I've been stressed out at my job lately and I've been turning to retail therapy :( I do try and stay conscious of what dupes I may already have to stave off the impulse buys though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,theywerecones,2,Wed Jul 15 17:52:45 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm on an unofficial lowish buy the last couple of years. I have so much stuff that it's been shifting my mentality to using what I have instead of desiring new stuff so much.  I've been trying this out for the last couple of weeks. I am forcing myself to use a different indie eye shadow every day until I get through my entire (mostly sample) collection. I use a different color every day and a cream color for the inner corners and browbone highlight/blending. It's been a really great practice, and I truly have a more aware idea of how much stuff I have. I'm wearing Shiro Smashing Pots today. Only 40+ more eyeshadows to go!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,superpoultry,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:34:35 2015 UTC,"100k+ in student loan debt is no fun! :( When I first went down the indie rabbit hole, I was buying ALL the things. My student loans started entering repayment a month ago and that was a huge reality check for me. I looked at my collection as a whole and started destashing a lot of the full sizes and colors I would probably never wear. I've also come to the realization that I'll never finish a full size of anything so I've been sticking to samples and minis as well. I now have a pretty small collection of about 20 eyeshadows/various makeup items and perfumes that get regular use.     Cataloging and destashing everything has really put into perspective how much money I've spent on everything over the past year! I also keep a ""wishlist"" of things with the prices and sit on them for a while before I make any purchases (I limit them  to once a month; $15 or less altogether). It also helps to ask yourself--""Will this purchase buy me a memory or an experience? Or is it just another superficial item that I really don't need?"" For example, I spent a bit of my savings going to Comic-con last week but it was worth it just for the memories with friends. It's been tough but I'm holding on!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,QoSN,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:43:22 2015 UTC,"I've been on a low-buy for a couple months. I really want a custom perfume, and since that's a huge cost I've had to cut down on any other purchases. I'm not spending any less, I'm just trying not to throw my money at everyone so I can spend a lump sum in one place. I caved yesterday and got some 1692 samples, including two of the birthday scents, because dat sale tho. That's the only purchase I've made aside from one of the payments to my custom perfumer, so I'm proud of that!   The most helpful thing for me has been engaging in Sunday swaps. I get to try new things and the only thing I pay for is shipping."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ddf5v,ichikoa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:54:14 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think low buys are too bad. No buys are way harder.    unsubscribe from any email or blogs that will be tempting.  same with youtubers limit time on forums as to not get roped into sales and new products. Side note: I usually have pretty good control to not be tempted by new things. I'll say ""ob man I need that now"" but in reality I... I put things I want on a spread sheet and leave them there. If I forget about them they get deleted. If they haunt me they move to spread sheet level two.  this list goes out to friends and family for birthday and holiday gift ideas. They usually find it to hard and give me money lol."

I'm not broke at all but my husband has keeps reminding me that no one needs 63 perfumes.  I've broken my no buy on a couple of Sunday swaps and I've asked for samples when it was my birthday, he was less than impressed when I bought 53 samples, I recieved countless gift of disappointment from him.  I will be on a low buy for sometime now, possibly even for the next 12 months!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dbbcv,wakenda,2,Wed Jul 15 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The shadows have been sitting around collecting dust (I have too many lol), so I figured it would be good to use them more!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dbbcv,wakenda,3,Wed Jul 15 02:32:21 2015 UTC,Red and gold is such a great combination!

I think I just kept asking her if she could make it more pigmented and it ended up like a lipstick haha.

Indiemakeupandmore,3dbzj9,floral__green,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:22:21 2015 UTC,So I love that custom balm! Or really custom lipstick!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dbzj9,littlesnow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:15:55 2015 UTC,"What a lovely red on you! With that kind of opacity though, are you able to apply it directly from the tube or do you use a lip brush?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc4dl,tsunshun-,3,Wed Jul 15 02:55:57 2015 UTC,I really love the Fyrinnae formula. I get so many compliments if I whip out Wizardry or Volcanic.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc4dl,PhyrraNyx,2,Wed Jul 15 05:51:32 2015 UTC,Yes those are exactly the colors I'm thinking of purchasing!
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc4dl,Great_Perhaps,3,Wed Jul 15 16:35:35 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried the NM ones, so I can't make a comparison, but I'm completely addicted to the Fyrinnae liquid lipsticks. The colors are amazing."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc4dl,mermaidunicornhybrid,3,Wed Jul 15 09:00:09 2015 UTC,"EDIT: So I actually checked and I don't have NM, I have Darling Girl. Woops.   I have both Fyrinnae and DG. Fyrinnae is almost definitely ""better"" BUT I like DG more. Let me explain: Fyrrinae is much closer to a traditional matte liquid. It goes on (fairly) opaque, it dries down quickly, and goes matte. From there, it's on pretty darn good. My gripe with it is that it can be drying (I have VERY dry lips) and it's hard to get it fully opaque because it's so liquidy (I can't get the wizardy duochrome to show up). DG, on the other hand, apples a lot more like a ""normal"" lipstick. It dries but doesn't ""shrink""-- you know what I mean? It doesn't latch onto your lips. You can smudge it. You can get it on your coffee cup. But it reapplies nicely, no worrying about moving the ""dry"" product underneath, and it fades nicely back to your natural lip, rather than the patchy fading I get with most liquid lipsticks.   Long story short, if you want a dramatic colour, get Fyrinnae. It will last better. If you want a natural colour, get DG. It will feel nicer (and since it's so natural it won't look awful when it starts to fade).   Also, if you want something that is like shellac, try Pretty Zombie (put down the pitchforks! They're good lipsticks!). It actually my all-time favorite formula, although it is a bit drying too. It just has the staying power to let me get over it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc4dl,Dorian_Gray_,2,Thu Jul 16 03:56:37 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound quite right; they ought to be nearly as thick (but a different type of composition obviously) as white school glue. If they're really oily/thin, it has separated. Sometimes storing it on its side then shaking well will help. If it's an ongoing issue, please feel free to email us and we can look further into it. :]"
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc4dl,mermaidunicornhybrid,2,Thu Jul 16 06:13:39 2015 UTC,"White school glue? Yeah, it's a lot more watery than that. I'll try shaking it and get back to you."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc4dl,miraclesystem,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"Mine is also extremely liquidy, to the point that even after shaking it up for a long time I can't really use it. I haven't been able to use it successfully even once yet :("
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc4dl,12oo,2,Sat Jul 18 18:11:07 2015 UTC,"Fyrinnae's are nice and lightweight but they do tend to transfer somewhat and can smudge, so that is something to consider."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc4dl,brainfilth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:31:20 2015 UTC,"Darling Girl's Pucker Paints are soooo gorgeous! They're a medium consistency, not overly thick or thin, texture is smooth and soft and they apply like a dream. The shades I have (Teddy Bare, Enchanted Orchid & Teddy Bare) are all opaque in one swipe but if you do want to layer them you can as they take a little longer than most to dry. What I like about these most is that they don't have that dry chalky feeling once they set down to a matte finish. The product doesn't settle into lines or make your lips look like the Sahara but because of this they're not transfer resistant. On me they last around 5-6 hours with no touch ups, maybe 4-5 hours if I've eaten."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc4dl,infamousjoe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:42:23 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried many, but Notoriously Morbid is my favorite right now, hands down.  Every other liquid matte lipstick (or matte lipstick in general) has dried my lips out and made them peel.  NM's Mystic Mattes dry super quickly after applying and don't dry out the lips throughout the day, which I like.  They also come in duos as well, so if you're looking to try more colors, then that might be an option to look into."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc4dl,meagantron,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:03:38 2015 UTC,"I did a blog post on a bunch of liquid lipsticks!   Fyrinnae is way more liquid than I thought it would be, and was a little drying on my lips. I also love some of the cool colors they have come out with  LE has fantastic solid colors, but they dont stay very well  My favorite indie one so far is probably NM's which I didnt review on the blog yet, because I havent posted anything in months. I think it has about the same staying power as Fyrinnae, but I like the feel of it more, personally. Their changlings are also to die for."
Indiemakeupandmore,3db68y,sihaya09,4,Tue Jul 14 22:29:37 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be a creeper but...the hair, the lip color, the general look...you have something good going on there ;)"

(I don't think it's a dupe, I think it just sort of happened, as things do.)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,amaijala9792,13,Tue Jul 14 21:31:25 2015 UTC,"Of course I don't mind, thank you for sharing! :D  I can't believe it's been (just about, almost, pretty much) a year! <3 you guys, and I hope you all enjoy this fun little collection ;)   By the way....There's also a sale launching tonight when this collection goes up!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,vanityclaire,8,Tue Jul 14 22:34:32 2015 UTC,I just wanted to say THANK YOU for making your birthday release so well thought out! I usually struggle with knowing whether to order samples or full sizes of scents because I don't want to risk loving something and then it selling out. I really appreciate the way you've planned the release (and the clear way you've carried it across to us customers).   So excited for the release! Congrats on one year! :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,laceandhoney,5,Wed Jul 15 00:50:52 2015 UTC,"Yay! Thank YOU! <3   And yep, I'm the same way -- I always do the ""ugh but it's LE, should I get samples? What if it sells out!?"" existential crisis, and then by the time I'm finished arguing with myself everything is sold out and I get nothing D: I figured this would be a better strategy :D"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,vanityclaire,3,Wed Jul 15 00:57:25 2015 UTC,Is it going up at midnight tonight?

Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,vanityclaire,2,Tue Jul 14 23:10:29 2015 UTC,I need all of these! How long will the sale go?
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,so_obviously_a_Zoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"The promo codes going live tonight/tomorrow will be valid through 7/19 but there will be more sales and discounts throughout the birthday month (7/15 - 8/15), including some flash sales :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,vanityclaire,2,Wed Jul 15 00:55:02 2015 UTC,The Tea Party sounds AGGGHHH so good! Is the Early Grey pretty prominent or kind of hidden?
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,koalatycontrol,3,Wed Jul 15 02:11:44 2015 UTC,"I would say it's more of a top note (after all, frosting does go on top and should always be eaten first ;)). I definitely get tea and bergamot in the top, and it dries down to a fluffy almond vanilla cake. Sort of similar to our Almond Tea Cakes lotion in perfume form, but with more cake! ;)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,vanityclaire,3,Wed Jul 15 03:04:41 2015 UTC,Oh. My. Goodness. Almond Tea Cakes is literally the perfect almond scent to me. I have a great need for this Tea Party perfume now...
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,CiaoBonefish,2,Wed Jul 15 07:39:13 2015 UTC,Perfect! Can't wait to add this to my collection :D
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,koalatycontrol,2,Wed Jul 15 03:21:53 2015 UTC,"(I know I'm way early, but I already have the page open and am refreshing periodically.)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,koalatycontrol,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:26:04 2015 UTC,Will there be sample sets like seasonal releases?
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,surewhynot123,2,Wed Jul 15 01:20:11 2015 UTC,"There will! Unfortunately not as many as usual, though. I made enough concentrate to last the month these will be available but not for both samples AND full bottles, so I am limiting sample sets to avoid running out early :) I will have both sample sets and individual samples available for these, but quantities will be limited. They also will unfortunately not be available in the create your own sample sets for this reason."
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,vanityclaire,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:25:43 2015 UTC,What do you think the chances are that the lotions will still be in stock after the samples go out?  Do they usually sell out as quickly as the perfume oils?
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,radiant_eclipse,2,Wed Jul 15 05:14:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I only made one batch of lotions in the birthday scents, and while there are a few left they are almost gone in most of the scents :( I will see what I can do about another batch but that probably won't be able to happen until after the sample restock, which will be sometime next week. Sample packs are sold out but there are still individual samples available of all of the scents currently :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,vanityclaire,3,Wed Jul 15 05:31:55 2015 UTC,"Damn! I was holding off on getting the lotions because I want to try the scents first (and I ordered enough I think, made good use of your sale code :P) but tea party was the lotion I was most interested in since I love almond tea cakes."
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,doramajoo,2,Wed Jul 15 13:21:41 2015 UTC,"How about we plan to do it this way: I will hold off on the second batch of lotions until after July 31 so that if you want to try one in a lotion you should have time to grab one after you guys have gotten your samples :) My batch sizes for lotions are pretty small, so I knew these would sell out but I didn't quite realize how fast! Sorry about that!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,vanityclaire,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:31:46 2015 UTC,Oooh that'd be awesome! I'd love that.
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,doramajoo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"That's okay!  Thanks for letting me know!  I had already grabbed a sample pack and was going to wait to see which ones I liked for a lotion.  I ended up putting in a second order (I noted the # for the first in the comments) because I don't want to miss out due to my total lack of control and love for all things cake scented.  They were eligible for different codes due to the price difference so I was wondering if they could be combined in that regard.  If not, I understand.  I don't want to be a pain in the butt or have you go out of your way if it's too much work to do so :P"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,radiant_eclipse,6,Wed Jul 15 06:19:54 2015 UTC,My God you guys are quick on the draw. Remind me to never get in a duel with you unless we're dueling for some of that Tea Party I was too slow for
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,2percent_unicornmilk,2,Wed Jul 15 06:35:37 2015 UTC,"Same, I got caught up in watching scream and forgot. :( I want the chocolate one too, but don't want to pay for shipping one one item and I am not sure I want to chance a full size blind!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,Dahlianeko,4,Wed Jul 15 06:44:59 2015 UTC,"I wish these came in forms other than perfume oils! I prefer gourmand scents in body products, so I'll be passing, but these do sound great"

Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,pondicus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:51:03 2015 UTC,"Psst, she has them in lotion form too! Only full sizes though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,foriamtheugliestprey,2,Wed Jul 15 03:54:12 2015 UTC,This is excellent news! I got my first ever Sixteen92 order literally yesterday and I want more :D
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,radiant_eclipse,6,Wed Jul 15 15:01:32 2015 UTC,"Is it wrong that I want to eat all of this, in addition to smelling like it?  I'm definitely going with samples since my skin can pull the oddest notes the forefront and totally warp things, but I think it's likely that at least two will re-ordered in full sizes if they're still available.  The Masquerade Party sounds absolutely incredible.   edit:  Can anyone offer their toughts on the detangling mist?  My curls will seriously tie themselves in knots while I sleep, so I'm always on the hunt for a good detangling spray."
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,doramajoo,3,Wed Jul 15 03:38:59 2015 UTC,"Looove it. It works well. It's very light in scent and how it feels, doesn't weigh your hair down."

Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,frumperbell,3,Tue Jul 14 22:09:37 2015 UTC,"I really want the full size set, but I'm supposed to be on a low buy.  I'll just have to settle for samples.    For now."
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,LiberVix,6,Tue Jul 14 23:50:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, that release was serious business. I don't get paid till tomorrow, so I just had to watch it all slip from my eager fingers, helpless. I want a full size of Masquerade Party (I'm still in full summer mode but  it sounds so good), Pool Party, and maybe Tea Party. Hoping for restocks soon!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,vanityclaire,4,Wed Jul 15 13:37:48 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I'm sorry!!! I know that feel!   FYI I just did a quick inventory (napkin math ftw) and was able to stock a few more of just about everything this morning. I....don't know what I expected. I really didn't think everything would sell out so fast! D: I may need to reevaluate my batch sizes and maybe get a second batch of these brewing so I can offer more of everything -- I'll have to work on that today :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,LiberVix,4,Wed Jul 15 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, no worries! That's just the way the cake crumbles sometimes (see what I did there?!) I'm sure I'll get my goodies sooner or later :) Congrats on a year, it seems like you've been around much longer!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,Ansitru,4,Wed Jul 15 14:11:18 2015 UTC,"Damn. So up until the release of the fourth one, I reckoned ""This is good, so far here's only one I really want. Look at me being a responsible adult and budgeting and not just impulse-buying.""  And then she released the fifth one. Chocolate and coffee. I will now need to pick one, to still stay a responsible adult who stays within her budget. Help."
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,Bloop_Monster,3,Wed Jul 15 15:10:01 2015 UTC,"I definitely need The Tea Party (and maybe a sample of The Masquerade Party). This will be my first Sixteen92 order, I'm excited!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,blushfanatic,3,Tue Jul 14 21:42:09 2015 UTC,I really want most of these. :)

Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,Absinthe42,3,Tue Jul 14 22:04:30 2015 UTC,"Welp, looks like I'll be making my first order soon. Tea and Masquerade parties, come to me! Tea Party actually sounds like it's full size worthy."
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,PhyrraNyx,3,Tue Jul 14 23:20:56 2015 UTC,I need the Pool Party
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,jujicakes,3,Wed Jul 15 01:33:46 2015 UTC,Sounds like another round of collection samples for me! Possibility of needing a full size of Tea Party is nearing 100% though.

I am probably gonna hold off, however, 'cause I've already filled my low buy indie quota for the month, and I already have something similar. Looking forward to reviews, though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,sihaya09,2,Tue Jul 14 22:26:28 2015 UTC,Of course I went and placed a first order today. slaps forehead  Well. Looks like I'll just have to place another. MUST have Masquerade Party.

Plan to get samples of all except princess party. Me and orangey smells do not mix. Crazy excited for pool party! I've been searching for something similar to a pineapple upside down cake.  Edit: Just went ahead and got the collection sample pack. I figure if I really don't like The Princess Party I can use it for swap collateral in the future. Had to get a sample of Shadow Show too, been contemplating that for a while. I am SO excited to smell these!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,Palindr0mic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:16:24 2015 UTC,Bummer. :( I have a really hard time adjusting to getting up that early.  My roommate used to do that shift and she hated it because she coudl never get her sleep cycle right so she switched to a night shift and seemed to like it much more.  Go to bed! :P

Indiemakeupandmore,3day9p,Tuipie,2,Wed Jul 15 20:40:06 2015 UTC,"Gah! The sample set sold out last night, so I bought individual samples.... and one of THOSE sold out as I was checking out. But I didn't realize they'd be restocked so soon so I panicked and bought what I could. Now the sample set is back in stock! I emailed last night because the cost of 4 samples = the cost of one sample set, which is what I want. IDK if I should place another order and see if the first one can be canceled, or just cross my fingers and hope that she sees my email before my order is packed.  Edit: She emailed back, hooray for customer service!"

My indies are: Blackbird Beau in my crease, Fyrinnae Moonchild on the whole lid and on my cheeks and nose as a highlight, Preen Mourning Dove on my lips. My skin looks on point today so no foundation. I am also sampling Possets Hwah-Tes Mouse because it was hot and humid while I was getting ready and I wanted a cool musk scent and was curious about the cat nip note. It is cool and fresh as expected but the cat nip isn't detectable. I wouldn't order a full size."
Indiemakeupandmore,3dcxrl,foriamtheugliestprey,3,Wed Jul 15 13:07:49 2015 UTC,I'm wearing Sixteen92 Grimm. I smell like wet leaves and chocolate which I didn't think I'd like but I really do.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dcxrl,lacqueratorie,3,Wed Jul 15 14:59:22 2015 UTC,"I am wearing most of my first Sixteen92 order right now in order to decide if I want any full sizes.

Indiemakeupandmore,3dcxrl,lgbtqbbq,2,Wed Jul 15 21:42:47 2015 UTC,"Yesterday I wore Rose Mallow Cream in the afternoon/evening and got raves from both my BF and my dad. They looove gourmand perfumes, dad's favorites are Pink Sugar and PurpleCat Creatives' Toasted (which I don't think I have anymore but it smells just like French Toast.) BF likes anything chocolatey or pastry-like. The only perfume he hates is Violet Mallow because it's too sharp and floral. Anyway they both liked it. My mother hates gourmands and sniffed my wrist and said, ""Still too sweet for me, but I like it. Smells like how Marie Antoinette would smell.""   Today I'm testing Arcana Apples Crave Vanilla and I like it. It smells like the apple component of some apple cinnamon tea I drank last night. Aquatic/watery apple juice with a warm sweet gourmand underpinning, which I assume is the vanilla. It's predominantly a silky, perfumed apple, which I really dig. I love it a lot more than Possets Washington, which I tried again after loving a year ago, but now smells REALLY spiced and kinda dingy sweet to me.   Also Arcana sent me a sample of Delphinius from the summer constellation collection and I'm angry because I love it and I didn't want to love it. It's peach and key lime, and I have 2 peach perfumes I love so I DONT NEED THIS. But the key lime...swoon. I wish this were stronger on the lime, and I could justify getting it. But dang if you like peach scents, this is a great option."

Oh, also the usual: Meow cosmetics foundation, Pumpkin and Poppy contour, Fyrinnae Hollywood sorcery setting powder. And Sugarpill Tako and Candy crush to round out the eyes.  And Solstice Scents White Fox, my current obsession. I'm trying to use up my samples, but I keep falling in love with them and wanting the full size. Danger! Danger!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3dc8gh,adragonisnoslave,3,Wed Jul 15 03:36:17 2015 UTC,Nah. If you just push the edge of the side over to the side it'll pop up. If that makes sense. lol  Edit: alternately if you hold the lid and kind of roll it to the side it'll pop up.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc8gh,vanityclaire,4,Wed Jul 15 03:56:11 2015 UTC,Stop trying to pull UP - just bend it to the side. Opens up no problem.
Indiemakeupandmore,3dc8gh,forespent,4,Wed Jul 15 12:56:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, as others have mentioned -- mine don't need to be wiggled or pulled. Just bend the top to the side and it pops off.

I find it fades down to a really nice red wine scent after I've been wearing it a while.  I haven't tried Darling Clandestine Inked yet, but I've been meaning to.

Barrel and bottle aged, with a smooth and spicy hit mid-palate. Hints of Dagon's tarry black incense and clotted blood complete this well-rounded, robust indulgence.)"

I don't want a lychee blend, I want to be able to detect the pure fruit in a stronger way! Black tea- I've been disappointed that many black tea scents I try are so fruity or more like white tea. I wish I could find more that are pure, not tempered by lemon or floral notes. Pear- I find the pear a lot of people use blends into the generic background fruitiness of many perfumes. I enjoy HoG's pear note, it blends well in customs in my experience."

I just really want someone to combine a new book note with coffee and caramel and make a ""bookstore"" scent. Maybe ""cold air"" as a top note that dissipates quickly so it's like you're walking out from the cold weather into a warm, cozy bookstore with a coffeeshop. Unf. Okay, I'll stop now.  I've had Frostbeard's Bookstore candle in my Etsy cart for months now, and I haven't quite pulled the trigger as $16 + shipping is an awful lot for a candle.   Edit for spelling, because I'm a moron and ignore red squiggly lines."

I mean, it's cool as like.. an atmospheric scent. Like, I want to wear it if I'm reading Harry Potter... not so much in public or even just around the house. Essentially what I'm trying to say is that a sample vial of a musty old bookstore will last me years."

I know rosemary probably won't be popular - it smells amazing (especially once it gets warm), but it can turn soapy very fast when you're up to your elbows pruning it. (Or when you fall into a hedge made of it.) But it's a really good, sharp green note.  I find it very hard to find more herbal green scents in general; most of them come off very floral.   I'm surprised I haven't seen many Earl Grey heavy scents, or balsam-heavy scents. Honestly, those two together would be enough for me. (I kind of want an Earl Grey scent on its own - note with cake or biscuit notes, just straight-up steaming hot Earl Grey. Considering how big and enduring a fandom Star Trek has, it really surprised me that I couldn't find anything like that.)  I've also always tried to find a perfume with that sort of hot sand/feathers smell that birds and lizards have, but either it's really not a popular smell or it's too subtle.   I also wouldn't mind some more savory gourmands, but not to wear. The people next door had a barbecue last night, and all I could think was 'this would've been so helpful when I had the flu and didn't want to eat'. General cooking/baking scents, like melting butter or gently frying onions and mushrooms, caramelizing pumpkin and sweet potato..."

Indiemakeupandmore,3daibk,TheLittleRed,2,Wed Jul 15 03:29:26 2015 UTC,"I've got DC Hellbender, which has saffron in it somewhere, and I've got 2 more perfumes with saffron in them which haven't shipped yet. Honestly I'm not even sure I know what it smells like but I just feel like I want to be a person who wears saffron perfumes."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,tightslacks,15,Tue Jul 14 14:13:07 2015 UTC,"Very interesting top-level view of the indie world! It seems pretty accurate though, at least from a general point of view, given how frequently the top few brands are mentioned / recommended on the subreddits.  I think it would be fun to do this periodically just to see how things stack up!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,steenface,5,Tue Jul 14 15:16:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely! I'd be down to do this again in a few months, to let newer brands settle in :D It's fun to see how all the trends change."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,sihaya09,9,Tue Jul 14 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"I'm really surprised that BPAL didn't make the formal list, considering BPAL is more widely known in general than most of the other companies on the list.   Then again, I hadn't heard of at least 5 of these companies before I joined IMAM earlier this year, and I've been buying indie since 2004. I'm glad that I do know about them now, of course (and have purchased from several since joining), but I think the subreddits sort of create their own culture around certain brands, too."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,doramajoo,7,Tue Jul 14 18:29:30 2015 UTC,"BPAL definitely has a bigger following than probably almost all of those companies, but they aren't very popular within this sub I've found.   And BPALers seem less likely to branch out to other companies."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,sihaya09,9,Tue Jul 14 20:45:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I find this sub is kind of fast-paced? Is that the word I'm looking for? That's kind of why I wanted to do this - get an idea of what's really popular right now. Brands come up, get really hyped, then are forgotten when the next new thing pops up. But there are those tried and true brands like Fyrinnae and Shiro that probably won't get knocked off the top anytime soon."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,sihaya09,2,Tue Jul 14 21:31:11 2015 UTC,I agree.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,doramajoo,5,Tue Jul 14 22:49:13 2015 UTC,"I think that's funny because about half of the companies I have tried, I've tried because I heard about them on BPAL.org!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,sihaya09,6,Tue Jul 14 22:21:59 2015 UTC,I feel like people in this group don't have the patience to get invested in BPAL? A lot of the reviews I've read are people getting imps and being disappointed and not wanting to put in the effort to go through their extensive catalogue.  I've seen also a lot of people who feel BPAL is expensive / don't want to get imps via the secondhand market to start (the forum being intimidating or whatever).
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,CiaoBonefish,2,Tue Jul 14 22:40:33 2015 UTC,"I can see that. I used to be a BPAL diehard, but the reason why I started branching out is because a lot of the scents started blending together for me. Still, about 3/4 of my favorite perfumes are BPAL, so."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,doramajoo,2,Tue Jul 14 22:48:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say BPALers are less likely to branch out. I know plenty of people who love BPAL who also love other companies! I agree that they don't get a ton of love on this sub though.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,CaptainCatbee,4,Tue Jul 14 21:57:58 2015 UTC,"I would say compared to this sub I know way more people in the BPAL community who are BPAL only or are very limited with exploring other options, but I'm speaking mostly of perfume."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,speaksincolor,3,Tue Jul 14 22:38:54 2015 UTC,"BPAL gets mentioned an okay amount here, but it's big enough that I don't think a lot of people even consider them indie anymore."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,eraser_dust,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people who are into BPAL stick fairly exclusively to the BPAL forums for discussion purposes, even if they wear other brands listed here, because it's a very well established and active community. None of the other companies have message boards that are so extensive."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,steenface,21,Fri Jul 17 03:16:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's best to do a separate survey for scents & make up. I think the indie cosmetics facebook group may have made the ""top brands"" cosmetics heavy."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,eraser_dust,11,Tue Jul 14 14:30:00 2015 UTC,"But the subreddits are for both cosmetics and perfume/bath products, so it makes sense to keep it all on one survey. (I'm not on the FB group so I can't speak to that.)  I mean, if people want to drill down into the data further, then sure, separate surveys can be done but I think this was pretty neat to see."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,elephantabate,6,Tue Jul 14 15:19:53 2015 UTC,I thought about that but I wanted to view a broader range of all top 5s across the board.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,Flewtea,0,Tue Jul 14 14:34:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm...maybe to even it out, maybe post the survey in a perfumes facebook group as well? Then maybe it'll balance things out."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,PhyrraNyx,8,Tue Jul 14 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"Is there one? Honestly, if there aren't many perfume brands on the list, then it indicates that the indie community is makeup-heavy in general. Many of the brands taken from Facebook are not popular here and didn't make it to the top 20."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,jujicakes,6,Tue Jul 14 14:41:01 2015 UTC,"I find that what is popular varies heavily by which group you ask. Half of these aren't on the radar in other groups I float around in, while others not on the list at all are heavily talked up.   Anyhow, this was fun, thanks for doing it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,PhyrraNyx,6,Tue Jul 14 16:31:23 2015 UTC,What other groups do you partake in? I can make a longer list and hit those up next time as well! I figured I'd hit up the bigger groups that I knew of so I'd get a larger sample but I can definitely broaden the sample groups.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,forespent,3,Tue Jul 14 16:33:16 2015 UTC,Could you post a separate top 20 of here vs facebook? I'd be interested in seeing the difference between communities and seeing the other brands.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,PhyrraNyx,2,Tue Jul 14 15:25:59 2015 UTC,"I wish! Unfortunately all the data is in the same sheet! I was able to pick apart a few from Facebook only because of the brands they listed are exclusively popular there (and I posted there before imam, so I saw a few of the live results early on but can't separate out the answers posted later). I wanted to collect fast, cumulative data so I didn't think ahead to that! For the next survey I'll see about making separate ones for Reddit vs. Facebook, definitely.   Maybe every six months?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,catgirl1359,3,Tue Jul 14 15:31:30 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised Life's Entropy and Darling Girl are so low on the list. Also, that Silk Naturals didn't even  make it.       When I think about what i see in terms of this forum, I think it's probably pretty accurate."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,PhyrraNyx,6,Tue Jul 14 17:36:48 2015 UTC,I can see DG being low based on the always long TAT :/
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,catgirl1359,3,Tue Jul 14 21:26:28 2015 UTC,"It's funny, I feel like DG and NM have long TAT, but I'm always happy when I get them in the mail, so it's not a big deal to me. And for Fyrinnae, they always say a long TAT, but it's never that long. Yet other companies when they say they have a long TAT and I'm waiting, I'm like, it's been 3 weeks already!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,PhyrraNyx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:37:09 2015 UTC,I feel the same way about Darling Girl!
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,catgirl1359,4,Wed Jul 15 14:42:26 2015 UTC,"Silk Naturals was barely even mentioned! And these are just the current trends. When LE opens again, I'm sure they would rocket back up to the top."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,PhyrraNyx,2,Tue Jul 14 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"I always have to remind myself that there are so many more people interested in indie brands than are seen on reddit, too. This was a great informal survey :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,catgirl1359,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see very little SN live on here. They're one of my face brands. They're a bit more ""mainstream"" though I guess. A lot of dupes and more ""safe"" colors. Great quality though!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,PhyrraNyx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:14:29 2015 UTC,I do think of them as offering a lot of great staple products and shades and their clones are awesome.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,catgirl1359,2,Wed Jul 15 00:49:13 2015 UTC,"Yup. Not hating, they just aren't ""indie"" in the really unique and out there way that others are. Their naked dupes are to die for though! And their poppies!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,catpuff,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:13:06 2015 UTC,"If you haven't tried them yet, their velvet matte lipsticks are excellent. I'm also a fan of their Vit C Peptide serum. With their eyeshadows, I love the formula but I find they almost all seem to lean warm-toned on me."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,catpuff,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:30:10 2015 UTC,I love the matte lipsticks! Such a great formula!  Too bad about their eye shadows. They do have a lot of warm toned neutrals but I've found some that are kinda cool as well as nice purples and such. But everyone's skin makes things look different I guess.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,KalmiaKamui,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:49:41 2015 UTC,"I do like their eyeshadows, I just find that they pull warm on me. Some products that say they're neutral pull warm on me too. It's definitely because of my skintone."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,mermaidunicornhybrid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:22:26 2015 UTC,Yeah that's too bad.  Btw I just noticed your username. I love your blog!

Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,QoSN,2,Sat Jul 18 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"I'm really curious to know how you ranked the brands! Did you give a point to a brand every time it showed up in someone's top 5 list , or did you rank them by the number of times they were mentioned as #1?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,FellowFresno,6,Tue Jul 14 19:40:43 2015 UTC,"The former. I wasn't considering anyone's responses in any type of hierarchy, so every brand mention had equal footing! The spreadsheets counted how many instances of each brand there was and I sorted it from most mentions to least."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d97kl,ThirteenDream,2,Tue Jul 14 19:47:16 2015 UTC,"I like that method, because it's really hard to actually rank the brands."

Indiemakeupandmore,3d8fcz,starward-,2,Tue Jul 14 09:01:38 2015 UTC,"So I wanted a completely red eye look, and I loved the results! The brighter red in my inner corner is TKB's matte red pop and I used Crimson Fury from Femme Fatale on the rest of my lid. I applied over Eccentric Cosmetic's eyeshadow primer and used a mainstream mascara. My only complaint is that I found the matte pop a little hard to blend (which I'm sure is evident in the photos) but I love how vibrant it looked!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d8fcz,wakenda,2,Tue Jul 14 09:03:32 2015 UTC,I love red eyeshadow and I think this look really works on you! It's neat the way you can pull off an all red look without eyeliner. I'm a little jealous!
Indiemakeupandmore,3d9zzb,PhyrraNyx,3,Tue Jul 14 17:38:24 2015 UTC,I just have to say that I love the way you do swatches. Thank you so much! I use your swatches of pigments a lot to see whether or not I will like them :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3d9zzb,peanut_jam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:49:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the kind words! I feel like, especially with indies, I need to use primer (though people have bitched about me using primer). to show off the complex shades. Since most indies are loose, I feel like you get great pigmentation. This isn't always the case with mainstream shadows. Recently I reviewed a NARS palette that I bought and I did not use primer and the eyeshadows were patchy and skipped when I applied them. When I tried using them on primer they weren't any better."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d9zzb,peanut_jam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:54:39 2015 UTC,I totally agree with using primer! I never wear eyeshadow without primer. I recently got fyrinnae's PE and it is the shit. I don't know why I ever buy mainstream shadows-- indie companies do it so much better!
Indiemakeupandmore,3d9zzb,themakeuplife,2,Tue Jul 14 20:19:15 2015 UTC,Pixie Epoxy is a holy grail for me. It's amazing. I also like the Darling Girl Glitter Glue and recently the Notoriously Morbid Shadow Bind.      Indies definitely make the most complex shades :)

Not every look needs extra sparkle."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d907g,wakenda,13,Thu Jul 16 06:19:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't been very vocal here recently and just started getting back into indies. My all-time favorite perfume is Seven Veils by Deep Midnight, which is ""a completely intoxicating blend of earthy Madagascar vanilla, velvety orchids, white florals, the softest musk, sweet golden amber, spices and exotic resins."" It makes me smell like an island princess and I love it.  I recently got a bottle of Arcana's Goofy Foot and it reminds me SO MUCH of Seven Veils, even if the notes aren't similar. The notes are ""fresh coconut and cardamom with green notes of spearmint, fresh basil, and one drop of vetiver grass."" It's very herbal-y in the bottle but, on the dry down it's a bit fruity and minty and definitely has that same island princess vibe."

They're like delicious smelling sisters!     I used Zazz pumpkin butter last night after my shower and put Dollface on my wrists so I fell asleep in a pink champagne cloud. There were just little hints left this morning, so I put on Unicorn Collector for something bright on a rainy day."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d907g,greenchipmunk,6,Tue Jul 14 16:00:05 2015 UTC,You could add Arcana Stawberries Crave Rhinestones and OHWTO Raspberry Ginger Ale or Bubbly to that list!

I'm looking forward to trying some HoG balms with different scents. Epically Epic Root Beer Float Lip Balm. Oh my god, I love this.

Ten Three Labs Salve Sticks in Holiday Spirits (Eggnog) and Cranfairy (Cranberry). Technically I lost the Cranberry one, so I didn't exactly finish it, but the end result is the same. I like the formula. Cranberry was a better scent for me than Eggnog, but they both were holiday and aren't around anymore anyways. They're a good multipurpose formula for me. I can wear a thin layer during the day or pile it on before bed. I'm also super close to finishing up my Monkey Bum Face (brown sugar) salve. That one is a very gourmand warm brown sugar scent, almost like brown sugar and maple oatmeal. I'll keep getting salve sticks, but none of these scents are ones I would repeat."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d8b2p,adragonisnoslave,6,Tue Jul 14 11:02:04 2015 UTC,Holy lord. The only lip balm I've EVER finished was a Strawberry Banana Chapstick! Kudos!!
Indiemakeupandmore,3d8b2p,wakenda,5,Tue Jul 14 14:10:57 2015 UTC,"I'm a total lip balm addict. Back before I got into indies I would literally finish a mint chapstick a month and would lose a bunch too. Now with my precious indies, I keep better track of them (I've only lost the one so far), and that means they actually get finished!"

Notoriously Morbid Coffin Kisser in Bradbury's Banana Pudding: This was my first NM Coffin Kisser, but it won't be my last. Leaves my lips super moisturized, is easy to reapply without getting goopy, and the scent was so delicious and comforting. Looking forward to repurchasing this when the Coffin Kissers are available again in the fall! Haus of Gloi Emulsifying Scrub in Milkmaid (mini): Love Haus of Gloi's emulsifying scrubs, and this was no exception. I could definitely smell the milk, along with the sweet pea. Different but still refreshing. Smell Yeti perfume oil in Slayer, The (sample): Smells like a fruity cocktail with lots of orange. A fun, fruity scent. Sixteen92 lotion in Blood Orange and Vanilla (mini): Smelled just like the name, and I love the lighter formula.  Haus of Gloi Whipped Soap in Komodo: Love the formula, not so much the scent. The mango smell was great, but the dragon's blood and resin wasn't pleasant for me."

Indiemakeupandmore,3d8b2p,birdsnbacteria,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:14:56 2015 UTC,I'm glad I asked! I love green apple but I was hoping for the berries to be more predominant. It's a great note list but the black currant and blackberry was what really caught my attention to begin with.

Indiemakeupandmore,3d8b2p,homicidalunicorns,3,Tue Jul 14 20:59:48 2015 UTC,"Since the last post:   Haus of Gloi whipped soap in Odette. Thank god. If there was ever a scent made to be a soap, Odette is it. It's straight up laundry and dryer sheets, so definitely something that works as a cleansing fragrance but not so much as something I enjoy. Sad, though, as it's my last HoG whipped soap and, aside from no whipped soaps during summer, I'm forcing myself to use up a Purplecat whipped soap I got last year. It's so hard. Re-buy HoG WS? Not sure, the formula is almost too soft for me. I've heard good things about Kheimistrii's, so I might try them next. Haus of Gloi full size pumpkin butter in First Blush. Love pumpkin butter, meh on smell. Fruity scents just aren't my thing, no matter how hard I try. Re-buy PB, yes, but in Aether so I can apply perfume after.   Almost done:   Haus of Gloi lip balm in Lavender Pumpkin. Smell was nice, balm formulation is meh. 2nd best of all the ones I've tried but I don't like using it as a straight balm, just as a lipstick base, as it's too waxy for me. It does more for my lips than, say, NM's Coffin Kissers, but that's not saying much. Re-buy, no, and I have another untouched one to use up.  Ten Three Labs salve stick in The Bubbler. Not a huge fan of the flavor (champagne lip balm consistently tastes buttery to me?? Had the same problem with a champagne HoG balm last year), but unf, dat formula. Best I've ever tried, indie and mainstream. It's glorious. It makes my lips feel amazing, it lasts overnight, it makes lip flaking an uncommon occurrence. Re-buy 100% yes, HG all the way. Possets Napoleon & Josephine sample. Guys. This is the BEST true rose perfume I've ever tried. BPAL's London is 2nd, but N&J is still miles ahead. It's not a shy, soft rose like Possets Robert Burns. It's not sweet like Possets Silver Roses. It's not dry or woody, like Haus of Gloi's Rose City. It's not spiced, it's not fruity, it's not powdery at all. It's just an explosion of fresh, glorious, juicy rose, just plucked from a rosebush. This has become my second place ""I don't know what to wear so I'll just wear this"" perfume this summer. It's amazing. My only issue is that it only lasts ~3-4 hours on me, which is why I haven't upgraded yet. I will next time I purchase from Possets, though, because I have yet to find a better rose that also lasts on my skin. Re-buy, yes, duh, as a full bottle."

In lotion it's a remarkably bright but creamy fruity smell- like peaches with lychees and nectarines, swathed in something creamy and fluffy but not sugary. Just a gorgeous light fruity scent. The EDP is very similar, though it initially has that ""bite"" from the alchol, but that dissipates quickly. I noticed with my Eternal Return EDP that the notes were somewhat muted compared to the oil, almost like the scent became more mainstream and less realistic. I would say this isn't as dramatic in Theda (compared to the lotion) and it still smells like straight fruit, not a fruity-ish perfume. The EDP formula does seem to smooth out the scents though and make them pop less...hmm not sure if I'm describing that well."

As of this morning we are on Day 3 of the War of the Feeder.  Though I morn the loss of my indies, the auto-feeders are still in place AND WILL REMAIN SO.

One morning around 430/5AM we wake up hearing our chickens screaming. My mum runs out to the coop and find a possum eating one of the chickens. She ran over to our neighbor, knocked on the door and asked him if he had a pistol. He hands it to her without a question and she runs to the chicken coop.

The nice things about possums in terms of things in a crawlspace is that they don't destroy wiring/insulation, they eat bugs and pests, rarely carry disease, and they don't stick around.  So I was able to get it out without any fuss.  My friend had a raccoon in a crawlspace, and those buggers DO NOT LEAVE when they set up shop.  The only way he could get it out was to put a boom box beneath the house and blast talk-radio non-stop (raccoons don't like the sound of human voices).

I have been eyeing it for a while and was super stoked to get it.   I am beyond obsessed with BL so this was perfect.  I had never tried anything from this brand before and I was a little disappointed to be honest, I don't think this quad is worth the 40$ price tag and probably won't be making further purchases from them. They did blend and apply nicely but it's lacking a little pizazz.   I used all the shadows in this quad plus nyx milk for the purple and the inner corner. Please ignore my patchy dry skin. I opened this package at 10pm after taking a nap and just HAD to play with the colors."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d4xts,savahontas,12,Mon Jul 13 15:46:25 2015 UTC,"40$ price tag   That DOES seem pretty high! I see what you mean about the blending but I think it works since it reads as intentional for the theme. I don't know that they'd be very good for day to day, though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d4xts,dellaluce,3,Mon Jul 13 15:59:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I would never pay 10$ each for these little shadows alone but they're sold in the BL package so it's gimmick alone that got me.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d4xts,cowbundles,7,Mon Jul 13 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"the power of marketing!  probably pricier because it's an actually licensed collection from a huge game with a lot of money (and legal teams) behind it. but even their normal shadows are $7.50 with zero sample offerings and even that's a bit offputting from an ""indie"" (even though they're getting pretty big now) outfit."

Indiemakeupandmore,3d4xts,kstinasunflower,2,Mon Jul 13 16:38:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I added the glitter last second because I figured why not. It's gross as hell but I just licked a small shader brush and quickly applied it to my lower lash line. I washed my face immediately after doing this, normally I would've used eye drops or something to apply it. I also would've added way more glitter but meh"

Haus of Gloi's Ruth (spring LE) is another strawberry/patch blend, buuut you should know that it is infamous and widely hated. Personally, I found it fine (if not my thing), so clearly YMMV.

Indiemakeupandmore,3d6iqv,CiaoBonefish,6,Mon Jul 13 22:23:50 2015 UTC,I'm thinking maybe I should have tried Peaches Crave True Love for my peachy vanilla scent. Because that milk note in Peaches Crave Vanilla soured on my skin
Indiemakeupandmore,3d6iqv,Inquisitions,3,Mon Jul 13 23:18:25 2015 UTC,+1 to PCV souring on skin.  I think the sweet milk note combo in this one is just bad for us. I think I might put mine into the destash pile for next Sunday.

Indiemakeupandmore,3d6iqv,Inquisitions,2,Mon Jul 13 23:40:56 2015 UTC,I've let it rest for 2 weeks with my decant open and it has slightly improved..? I'm in denial.   How is Apples Crave Orchards? It sounds really spicy apple cider by the description. I've got my eyes peeled for Apple Craves Cake though.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d6iqv,pondicus,5,Mon Jul 13 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I debated with letting mine rest, but it just turned so awful on my skin I couldn't imagine a world where it worked haha  Apples Crave Orachards starts out really strongly of apple cider, it really mellows out later on to more woody, green notes (I guess that's the hay?), and the apples fades, but never disappears. It is definitely a fall scent.. but I don't let scents tell me when to wear them, so for me it's year-round"

Indiemakeupandmore,3d6iqv,pondicus,3,Mon Jul 13 22:48:36 2015 UTC,I totally agree with you about Peaches Crave True Love - that one was more peach/vanilla to me than Peaches Crave Vanilla which smells like instant peaches and cream oatmeal with my skin. It makes me sad that I blind bought PCV instead of PCTL!
Indiemakeupandmore,3d6iqv,JuliaArcana,3,Mon Jul 13 22:41:36 2015 UTC,"Yes! I love the smell of peach oatmeal, but True Love is more of a true peach and vanilla scent. I wish I could get a hold of a bottle of it, but alas I doubt I ever will be able to."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d6iqv,JuliaArcana,3,Mon Jul 13 22:48:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the collection! I'm still envious of everyone who got a delicious creaminess on Peaches Crave Vanilla on their skin.   Such a shame Peaches Crave Paws didn't work for you! I don't get the cough syrup at all - just a very refreshing peach scent.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d6iqv,curlymama,2,Mon Jul 13 23:43:31 2015 UTC,Nose and skin chemistry are a curious thing! I'm glad that Paws worked for you though! That is what is great about a collection like this though. There is a little for everyone.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d6iqv,curlymama,4,Tue Jul 14 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reviews! Just FYI, in all of the Cravings collections, I use multiple examples of the predominant note. IOW, the Apples Craves included spiced apples, fresh apples, apple cider, etc. There were quite a few different peaches at play in this collection, although I totally respect the fact that your nose disagrees. Again, just FYI. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d6iqv,MageLocusta,8,Tue Jul 14 00:56:14 2015 UTC,"I know that they were all different, and I hope I didn't give the impression that they were all the same! I mentioned in my review that some were more tart, others were more sweet, others were more fresh etc. (and it is amazing that you can do that really) When I mentioned in my review about variety when it comes to the peaches though, I meant that many of these had peach as the star player. To me a peach perfume is still a peach perfume. Does that make any sense? I have no idea, but it is really crazy how different everyone's ""nose chemistry"" can be!"

Inspired by the Tortall Universe created by Tamora Pierce, the Universe collection will be split into 5 parts. Each part will be a sum of each set of books, and of course we're going to start with Alanna!  I went with 5 parts because the universe is so expansive, that it was either I leave out a lot of stuff, or I release a LOT all at once and that would be overwhelming! There will be eight eyeshadows in part 1, which like I stated above will cover 'The Song of the Lioness', 4 books in the Tortall universe. You can expect sneak peaks later this month!"

At the end of the month I also want to try a few minis of the new EDPs from Solstice Scents- namely Manor, White Feather, and White Fox.

It's amazing how much better/easier my low buy is when I just have two goals instead of not buying anything at all or having a budget. Plus, the excitement is palpable:) I plan on hopefully buying the baroque stuff pressed too!"

Any brands I currently own are on my worksheet wishlist awaiting the end of my low buy. (Seriously Ten Three Labs, I'm coming for you.. soon...)  I also ordered some of the Arcana Constellation decants as a reward for not doing the Peaches/Strawberries Crave, Possets, or Violette Market circles. Which probably isn't the best reward system..."

Indiemakeupandmore,3d6mrc,sillybits,2,Tue Jul 14 13:35:46 2015 UTC,"So I recently bought 2 full size Wiggle perfumes and was immediately overcome with guilt (I can not afford that shit man, but damn it I can't resist the Wiggle!); thus a No-Buy. I'm trying to wait until all the Yule collections come out. I'll be wanting to try some of perfumes from HoG (Rosy Cheeked!), as well as some BPAL items (hoping they bring back scents like Rose Red and Peacock Queen). The Autumn collections usually don't call to me whatsoever so it's easy for me to hold off from buying. But winter scents really slay me. I'll also probably pick up some Alkemia full sizes and maybe a CYOA from Alchimia! Luckily I'm totally set for makeup."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d6mrc,i_am_a_cyborg,2,Tue Jul 14 00:31:50 2015 UTC,Rosy Cheeked is my favourite HoG yule scent. I wore it a lot to go xcountry skiing.

When she does? BPAL all the way. BPAL everything until she comes back here in May next year. (It'll probably take me until August to review them all.)  Basically, if they don't do flat-rate international shipping or their flat-rate is super high, it's going to have to wait until August. (So Shiro, Fyrinnae, etc. are probably fine. It's really only BPAL, Arcana and Firebird that I've had that problem with so far.)  Unless by some miracle the AUD stops being so friggin' low compared to the US dollar. We're down to $0.74 now."

Most of the ones I've tried are good in one coat, self-levels, and dries quickly. Tristam and Saint George are gorgeous dark holos that are subdued enough for work/school. I'd also recommend Percival if you want to look like you drink the tears of men for breakfast."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d6mrc,LILY_LALA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:09:48 2015 UTC,"YES. It's just so...classy. Lady of Shalott! Partly for the poem, partly because I love the color.

(Best is one of the best nail polishes I've tried period--Essie Bobbing for Baubles; I know, I know the rest of the Essie line isn't nearly as good, but that one's a one coater/looks perfect on my skin.)  #1 under sunlight, but I'm not pleased with how it can get fabric impressions an hour after they've been painted. :< But definitely one of the best. I'm seriously tempted to order more! I mean, it is my birthday today.   Do you use a base/top coat? I used to but...I'm also a lazy butt whose just restarting her collection. I'm indecisive on this. D:   OHHH. Which ones do you have? And I was looking at St. George, Dragon, Prosperpine and Tess to try and figure out which I'm supposed to get. UGGGGGGH. SO PRETTY. I might get one of those and a red. Then....I don't even know."

I think it's worth treating yourself extra nice today :DD  I've never had the patience for a base coat, but I do use a quick drying top coat (Out the Door brand). I just bought a peel-off base coat since I hate the process of removing nail polish. I'll let you know how it works with the polishes once I get my hands on it. :)  St. George is the one I wear the most often; it's a lovely green that's dark enough to be flattering on yellow/olive skintones. Dragon is warmer and actually does look reptilian-y. Tess looks black in most lighting so it might be too similar to Lady of Shalott. What about the more neutral colours like Sleeping Palace or Dorian Gray?   I wish I could help with narrowing it down, but I'm still tempted to buy everything even though I don't wear polish that often D:"

I'm kind of afraid to trust the ones on the Llawore site--they don't seem accurate to the polishes I got. And I actually have a bad habit of really bold nail colors, so sure! Recommend me some neutrals. :D You mentioned Percival as a good red right? Would you say it's warm at all? That's kind of what's making me hesitate over that one. :x   HAHAHA.

Indiemakeupandmore,3d6mrc,honeycombpaws,2,Tue Jul 14 23:30:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think St. George is warm, I find it actually leans cool on me. This is similar to what it looks like for me. Harlowe & Co tend to have good swatches on their site, so you can check there too for the other colours. Percival is a very in-your-face brilliant red ;)  I'd say it's a true red, not leaning warm or cool. Gloriana, in comparison, would lean quite warm.

Indiemakeupandmore,3d64fd,i_am_a_cyborg,6,Mon Jul 13 22:06:52 2015 UTC,After much drama with formatting my review is posted haha.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d64fd,mjolnir_mooncup,6,Tue Jul 14 00:52:43 2015 UTC,"I got a bunch and I think they are waiting in my mailbox! Most excited for the aquatics!  Edit: got a bunch of decants from Ajevie, not full bottles.  Edit 2: First impressions:   The Windmill at Wijk - The vanilla and amber are most present, I'm not getting the marine note on dry down. This went powdery on me.   edit: more of the wood (oak) came out and this kind of reminds me of Jo Malone's Wood Sage and Sea Salt (emphasis on kind of, I haven't smelled Wood Sage & Sea Salt in a long time and could be way off base). The powdery amber faded quite a lot and this smells better now. However, I'm not sure waiting 45 min-1 hour is worth it.  Pendant Mask - I was really excited for this one but there's something really off about it. It's very strong on application and gives me a cocoa vibe. On dry down it's quite sour and a bit woody; I think the sourness comes from  the musk. Not all musks work for me but I'm usually ok with the other notes in this blend.   Sea of Ice: Whoa men's cologne. Smells like Davidoff Cool Water and mint gum or mouthwash. The citrus comes out a lot more on dry down, but I still get a mouthwash and men's cologne smell.   edit: the mouthwash, citrus, and mint smells have faded quite a bit, but it's still a generic men's aquatic cologne type scent to me.   Seascape: Much better than the other aquatics so far, but the cannabis gives this plastic-like smell. The coconut balances that out quite well for me. I do like this a lot and might grab a full bottle.  edit: The cannabis mellows out quite a bit and the sweetness of the coconut comes out. Some might find the too unisex or cologne-y, or might find the coconut is too sweet, but I love it. The coconut seems to be same one in Silver Coconut from last year. My fave so far but I have another 6 to test out tomorrow and Wednesday.  Hortus: Very floral. I don't get any poopy jasmine at all, which is good. This is a pure floral blend that smells like a mainstream fragrance. This isn't as heady or heavy as HoG's Narcosa or Alkemia's Midnight Garden, and I don't really get strictly white florals, more of a generic floral smell. I like this and think it would be great for someone who loves mainstream floral perfumes or for layering.   edit: a lot of the floral vibrancy has died after 30-45 minutes, which is disappointing. I don't like this now, it smells very flat and reminiscent of some other Possets duds I've sampled in the past."

For the record, I got decants of Girl with a Watering Can, The Swing, Très Riches Heures, and Hay Wain.  Edit: They arrived! Super late in the day. Like 5-7 hours later than usual. But I'm not complaining. If anyone wants first impressions, let me know."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d64fd,badluckbelle,2,Mon Jul 13 21:08:01 2015 UTC,"first impressions, please!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d64fd,lynxpoint,7,Tue Jul 14 00:14:10 2015 UTC,"Alright then! So these are my first impressions, the perfumes haven't had time to rest, etc. Also, these are my ""notes"" so the writing is kind of choppy, please excuse it...  Girl with a Watering Can (Renoir): Extremely realistic pastry scent (evocative of the scent and ""texture"" of an actual pastry). Kind of like some of the Solstice Scents gourmands, maybe similar to Owl Creek Aleworks minus the stoutiness. The same ""pie crust"" note that's in Pippen Pie. Not overwhelming for summer/warm weather despite having the potential to be.  The Swing (Fragonard): Juicy raspberry, slightly candy-like, like raspberries dusted with sugar. Fruity, with not much else going on. Becomes slightly creamier as it dries. Then it's sharper. Then it mellows out again.  Très Riches Heures (The Limbourg Brothers): Almost exactly like Girl with a Watering Can, but fruitier? It smells pretty much the same in the vial. Becomes more distinct when dry. Slightly irritating to skin (only slight, slight stinging on my inner wrist, but people with really sensitive skin might want to avoid it). Also not overwhelming, though one might expect it to be.  Hay Wain (Constable): Grapefruit, like that in Dance With Me, with floral base. Floral notes comes out more as it dries, but the grapefruit is still pretty strong on my skin. Basically Dance With Me, but less vanilla and more flowers.  I wonder how these will change once they've rested for a couple of weeks!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d64fd,badluckbelle,3,Tue Jul 14 00:43:53 2015 UTC,thank you! Girl with a Watering Can sounds especially delicious.

There are already a couple reviews up on the Possets review forum, and it'll be great to hear more.   Summer (Mucha) is one I'm particularly excited to hear more about, and reviews of the ""marine vanilla"" of The Windmill at Wijk can't come soon enough."

Hoooly crap. I love Napoleon & Josephine on its own because it's the best, most glorious and juicy rose I've come across, but giving it a dry, woody base? Fantastic. TOTR lends it more depth and staying power, and the overall effect is just lush.   I ended up destashing my sample of TOTR, but if Possets released some hybrid of it and N&J it would be mine faster than the USPS gods could send it.  Brands need to make more woody florals. They're awesome."

Indiemakeupandmore,3d56l0,Bloop_Monster,3,Mon Jul 13 21:59:26 2015 UTC,"PICK ME! PICK ME! I would want to do a look inspired by the Blackbird Julep - super delicious, pink, and full of berries!    Just curious, why is it being limited to 5? I know you can't make it super huge since that would take a lot of work on your part to put together the album, but since it's a category that doesn't have a limited number of options I feel like it should be a little bigger.    Or maybe it could be options like rum, vodka, tequila, scotch/whiskey, champagne, etc. and the chosen participants will be assigned one of those and do a look based off a cocktail that uses it?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d56l0,amaijala9792,2,Mon Jul 13 19:56:36 2015 UTC,"I chose 5 because last time was 7 and it was a bit tricky for me to organize people. A few submissions were late, and there was some miscommunication among the collaborators. It's just easier to organize fewer people. Also, I think this is something that EVERYONE can participate in once the megathread is posted, since the possibilities are infinite.   The album itself isn't actually a ton of work-- it takes about an hour to track down the images, save them to my computer, upload them to imgur, add descriptions, and it would take less time if I wasn't so fanciful with my descriptions. I think it would still take almost as long if there were 5 as if there were 10. The time consuming bit is mostly keeping track of people, making sure everyone chosen has confirmed they're going to do it, hasn't forgotten, gets their looks in on time, submits their product lists, doesn't post to IMAM before the megathread, stuff like that."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d56l0,frumperbell,2,Mon Jul 13 20:06:18 2015 UTC,"Will the future ones also be limited to 5 then? Like Wonders of the World, months, Greek/Roman gods, Dr. Who, etc. Is there any way we can help you? I'm sure most of us would be willing! :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d56l0,savahontas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:33:43 2015 UTC,"I think 5 or 6 is a decent default, with once that have a logical number being whatever they are (lol months). I suppose we could make are rule that if the first 5 are comfortable with adding more, I could draw X more names. That's something they'd have to discuss, because it would require them taking more responsibility for eachother."

But people that purchase these thinking that they will be opaque will be very dissapointed. The responsibility falls on the shop owner to accurately portray the true opacity of the products"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d5r0q,tippyx,2,Mon Jul 13 19:46:09 2015 UTC,The formula is still pretty hard and waxy. I ended up remelting some of my samples to mix in coconut oil to make them apply easier.

Indiemakeupandmore,3d5r0q,cocytusg,8,Mon Jul 13 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"The colors in the shop aren't anything groundbreaking either. And if the formula isn't ideal, it's going to be hard to compete."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d5r0q,cocytusg,4,Mon Jul 13 23:24:44 2015 UTC,"If I want to wear one of my Gloryhawk samples for a day, I have to keep the sample in my bra to keep it ready-to-go warm. I don't have quite the same issue with my full-sizes: rubbing the stick over my lips (a lot) eventually loosens up the formula and it performs better for the rest of the day.  I had been very hopeful for Delphine, but once able to finally build it up a bit on my lips, it was obvious that the formula was just too waxy: it looked clumpy and unflattering. I loved my Alisandra sample, but the full-size I ordered was not the exact same product: subtly different enough to be a bit disappointing."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d5r0q,PhyrraNyx,2,Thu Jul 16 02:24:21 2015 UTC,"Did you have issues with the consistency of the full sized lipstick?  Edit: Oh lord, I can't read.

Indiemakeupandmore,3d5r0q,emmian,3,Thu Jul 16 02:26:45 2015 UTC,"I'd say reformulation is needed. The wear-time is very short and formula is too waxy. Left alone for a couple of days in a dark, dry, air-conditioned room, all of my Gloryhawk samples and full-sizes kind of dehydrate themselves. My full-sizes ended up blooming a bit and giving me a scare."

Indiemakeupandmore,3d5r0q,LILY_LALA,5,Mon Jul 13 19:23:03 2015 UTC,I wonder if there's any difference in the pigmentation with the full bullets? I know that even with Kae Q (whose lipsticks are super pigmented) I could barely get any color off some of the Besitos.    I wouldn't want to buy a full-size lipstick to find out though.

I have Arcana Apples Craves Apples and it is BEAUTIFUL, but not quite what I'm looking for.  The notes for Be Delicious are:   Top - green notes, violet leaf, apple, grapefruit and magnolia.  Middle - tuberose, lily of the valley, rose and violet.  Base - sandalwood, amber and musk."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d3s5y,homicidalunicorns,7,Mon Jul 13 10:05:30 2015 UTC,"Arcana Avalon doesn't quite remind me of Be Delicious (though to be fair the last time I smelled it was probably 5+ years ago), but you might like it anyway! It has a nice balance between floral and green apple.   A harmonious blend of fresh apples, green herbs, and wildflowers   OHWTO is closed at the moment, but they have a good apple note. Lucky has no floral notes and to me is primarily grass and apple, but the apple is strong so you might like it:   Crisp, juicy red apples, tart granny smiths, and rolling, endless green hills    As for ones I haven't tried:  If you're able to get your hands on it, Arcana Apples Crave Flora is a floral apple with some citrus and a woody note. The reviews I've read have been positive.    A fresh blend of Fuji apple, tropical Tiare blossm, tuberose, bergamot, orange flower, and a touch of vintage patchouli.   OHWTO Apple of My Eye has been described as a very green apple-floral:   Bushels of apples, bouquets of lilies and carnations and sweet peas, green clover, sensual and exotic musks, a splash of champagne and a little candy, to boot.   OHWTO The Girl Who Waited might also work, and the few reviews I've seen have described it as primarily a light green apple.   Crisp apples, Raw honey, Lilacs, Cedarwood, Soft leather, and Vanilla cream.   Possets Washington State's notes might sound heavier than you're looking for, but a forum review describes it as juicy, fresh, and a ""greeny floral"".   Apples, sweet briar rose, a honey accord, incense"

I also tested BPAL's Poisoned Apple a few days ago and it's another interesting one though, despite the name, not as apple-y during dry down as others."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d3s5y,pondicus,3,Mon Jul 13 21:40:04 2015 UTC,"I have not had the balls to dip into BPAL, because it sounds so overwhelming (as pee the usual excuses hahah).

I'm around NC 15-20 and I find this type of color really compliments my fair Asian skin tone.

Beautiful but not worth the price unless you have money to burn.  I like Gardenia Crimson from Nocturne Alchemy, it's a very realistic, uncloying gardenia.  Also Nightgown from Solstice Scents. It's a little foodier not fresh-plant-y because of the white chocolate and vanilla base but the tuberose in it is to die for. It's probably my favorite white floral scent ever, though I'd never characterize it as fresh. Definitely silky and voluptuous."

The honey in 1692 Mellifera I found to be very realistic and light, not cloying.  I did just peek at their catalog though and it says the wildflower honey in Mellifera isn't vegan while the wildflower honey in Blood & Honey is, so that could make a difference. Smelly Yeti's is vegan, for the record."

This blend was beautiful and atmospheric and really wearable. Cocoa Pink alcohol-based scents are very long-lasting with powerful throw, especially their florals.

Indiemakeupandmore,3d3w95,mermaidunicornhybrid,2,Mon Jul 13 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"Oh dang you will love this then. I just copied my review from when I received it:  I like this, it’s a dry elegant floral, a lot like walking through a flower garden with tons of fragrant blooms. I smell the rose strongly, and the jasmine. The jasmine is very true to life, which I love. Tuberose is definitely there, lending its characteristic heartiness and I do detect the zesty/bitter orange blossom. The rose dies down the quickest and the jasmine and tuberose form the heart of the fragrance, All of these notes are favorites of mine, so I was bound to like it, but even if you are unsure about some of them, this would be a non-threatening fragrance for a floral-hater to sample. It’s a little heady but still breezy, reminding me of the scent of flowers on a warm summer evening. Not artificial or too complex, just a few realistic floral notes."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,eraser_dust,11,Mon Jul 13 01:21:00 2015 UTC,"I disregard descriptions unless they're actually describing the scent and aren't just flowery prose like ~this is a scent capsule of my fifth birthday, it was Election Day and in the starry morn the brown owls sang~. There's nothing wrong with perfume prose, I just prefer to also have a note list or at least a description of how the scent itself feels.  A description that's like, idk, ""A haze of X warms the core note of Y as Z flits around the edges"" is great, because that's useful in knowing how a scent might unfold.  Note lists on their own can vary in usefulness, since some fragrances are just really well-blended and you may not be able to even pick individual notes out of the final result. Something you normally hate may mesh really well with the other notes. Even so, I tend to still stick to ""what do I know I like/dislike"", as it's just easier.   I've really discovered note preferences through trial and error, especially after figuring out the specific scent genres I prefer. Florals are A+, for example, but lily, violet, and gardenia are not, and it took me ages to figure those out."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,homicidalunicorns,12,Mon Jul 13 01:43:00 2015 UTC,"I know this is unlikely to make me friends, but when a collection is based on pop culture I pretty much always avoid it, no matter how tempting the notes are. I feel that the inspiration lacks personal creativity (and hence it is boring to me), and besides, I like my own internal impressions, and don't need version #24 of various fans' interpretation of how sexy a sociopathic character smells to them.    That being said, I'm not opposed to people using their favorite show or book or manga or whatever else to inspire their offerings; it's just different strokes.   edited: crap spelling"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,elephantabate,4,Mon Jul 13 02:25:17 2015 UTC,I agree. I completely avoid any fandom collections especially if it's something I just don't get.

Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,j-dusk,4,Mon Jul 13 01:43:36 2015 UTC,"I think licorice as a scent is really polarizing because licorice as a flavor is really polarizing. I know a couple people who LOVE licorice, but many more people who think it's disgusting. I don't think I know anyone who's neutral about it. I've seen a few people say they love licorice scents, so they must exist.  Personally, licorice is one of very few things I've tasted that I have strongly viscerally hated and have wanted to claw off my own tongue to stop tasting (and I'm an adventurous eater so there's been plenty of opportunity), so I avoid the scent like the plague because it reminds me too much of it. Anise is also really iffy.  edit: and I'm laughing now because the two people who posted after also said they ""LOVE"" licorice. I envy you! It drives me up the wall when I can't learn to appreciate a flavor and it's obviously not meant to happen with me and licorice, because I try it every couple years and am always filled with mega-regret."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,montycuddles,3,Mon Jul 13 02:08:12 2015 UTC,"How you feel about licorice is how I feel about pineapple. I want to like pineapple. I actually have a lot of pineapple stuff (purse, printed shorts, canvas, etc) because I think it's an adorable fruit. But I cannot stand the taste or smell. Ugh. One time I was at a bar and my coworker got all the girls some stereotypical fruity pineapple based shot and rhe guys shots of Fireball. I traded for the Fireball."

I also have a similar reaction to bitter almond/amaretto, which is a shame since I actually love almonds."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,j-dusk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:24:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm, most of the red vines and twizzlers I see are the red kind, and those usually don't actually have licorice flavor, though red vines might have a bit because I find them pretty nasty. Twizzlers are usually strawberry and I'm fine eating them. It's just the black licorice that I avoid like the plague.  The only other food I think I have a similar reaction to is dirt-cheap vodka/whiskey. And anise, and fennel, which have a very similar flavor profile to licorice. I can tolerate anise in a chai blend but when it's prominent I side-eye it the whole time like I expect it to suddenly murder all other flavors and choke me with its licorice-ness."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,cuculine,3,Mon Jul 13 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"I like licorice.  Can't stand eating it usually, but it's so good to smell in perfume!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,lgbtqbbq,3,Mon Jul 13 02:02:30 2015 UTC,I LOVE licorice and anise. Both the candy smell and the fresh plant smell. I like absinthe too. My dad loves eating old-school Dutch black licorice and my mom has a beautiful Guerlain anise perfume so maybe I get it from them :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,TheAnglican,2,Mon Jul 13 02:22:05 2015 UTC,Solstice Scents Black Mallow is a really pretty licorice scent softened with marshmallow - a favorite for both my Mom and me.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,normalcypolice,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:59:51 2015 UTC,"I actually like it sometimes, in small doses in more herbal and green blends."

However, I love to drink Jager and will mix it with just about anything. So apparently the scent is fine with me? I haven't tried it in a fragrance yet, but now I'll be on the lookout for one."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,crazyradiosquirrel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:51:48 2015 UTC,I love anise. Partly because I enjoy licorice but mostly because my family always makes pizzelles (anise waffle cookies) at Christmas so the scent has tons of good memories associated with it.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,RhinestoneHousewife,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:53:51 2015 UTC,"I LOVE it!  I love to smell like it, eat it and even drink licorice tea.   Licorice is a great natural anti-viral too.     Licorice and anise are two of my favorite notes in perfume and it's true.....people generally love it or hate it but few are ambivalent about it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,faithlessdisciple,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:23:16 2015 UTC,ok so I am the odd one out here. I could drown in anise and be happy.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,hankdiggles,2,Mon Jul 13 07:24:11 2015 UTC,"I do exactly the same thing as you. Flowery language does nothing for me, just tell me what the base/mid/top notes are! I also dislike the same things as you (except for mint and honey, they both work well for me)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,beautifulmess7,2,Mon Jul 13 08:46:18 2015 UTC,"I have a few hate notes as well.  Incense smells make me gag, and I really dislike coffee (the smell and the beverage). I don't know about patchouli, but I think that's another no for me, partially because my husband despises it. I also don't like licorice or anise.   I was intimidated by leather and thought I wouldn't like it. Then I tried Lou Lou's Leather Whipped Fruits, and fell in live. It's one of my absolute favorites. The saddle leather is perfect, and takes me immediately back to childhood hanging out in the barn with my grandpa and learning to ride horses. The fruit lightens it and adds a pretty note.   On the other hand, I thought I would like gourmands, but I actually hate most heavy, foodie scents. Chocolate notes are yuck on me, I didn't like several cookie scents I tried, and cheesecake went way sour. Arcana yellow cake is nice and lighter than others, but I have to layer it with some fruit.   Most fruits are wildly successful on my skin. I avoid banana, coconut, and cucumber scents. I also dislike most floral because they tend to read old lady on me, but I love white flowers like tuberose, and honeysuckle and lavender are beautiful on me. Orange blossom smells like death on me, but oranges (especially blood oranges) are divine.   It's weird how skin chemistry and scents work."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,lgbtqbbq,11,Mon Jul 13 11:43:12 2015 UTC,"My first way to narrow down what I want is I consider the brand.  Possets, Solstice Scents, and Alchemic Muse are all automatic yeses...I'll try a sample even if the notes sound suspect, and if the notes are up my alley, I'll blind-buy full-size. I find if your tastes are aligned/your expectations upon reading a notes list are matched to the perfumer of a brand, you can more faithfully try their stuff out because you have a reference point.  Next, I look for notes that I don't have in my collection. I was looking for a great banana scent for a while, and found it in Alchemic Muse Chiquita so now I ignore banana-predominant scents, as I have something to do that duty.   After that, I will consider notes I love but that I already have represented in my collection, maybe just blended with other interesting notes. I love rose for instance, and have a great cold earthy rose, NAVA Victoria, but would consider a sweeter candied rose if I came across one, because I love the note enough and would consider it distinct in a way.  Finally I consider how well a perfume may layer with the other perfumes in my collection. If a perfume is really complex, filled with tons of notes, and seems like something I won't wear all the time, I'll usually ignore it, just because the one day I wear it in three months isn't worth it. If I can't work it into a regular rotation, either alone or layered, it's not really fun to have in my collection."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,lgbtqbbq,4,Mon Jul 13 02:26:50 2015 UTC,"Based on your favourite brands, I'm guessing you like the boozy sort of vanillas? Siberie's caramel/vanilla notes reminds me of SS' vanilla notes if they're not going sour on me (SS' vanillas tend to go sour on me too T.T)!  Oh, and I encountered an awesome sweet candied rose scent before! ZOMG Smells' Anna! Copy pasting my previous review:   Omg this starts off so gorgeous! There's honeysuckle and a sweet, candied sort of rose. It's different from my favourite honeysuckle-rose combo though (MDA's Rapunzel has it). The rose here is velvety and candied, and it's heavier on the rose. It's also more creamy rather than fresh & grassy.  The rose does get heavier with time, and there's hints of powderiness. It gets a bit too sweet at times for me, but my skin does amp up sweetness and I still like it overall. This is definitely a scent you either love or hate.  TL;DR: Creamy, candied rose.   And I find it interesting you avoid really complex scents! I love them because I'm too lazy to layer!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,mjolnir_mooncup,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:40:14 2015 UTC,"Actually weirdly NOT a fan of boozy vanillas. SS vanillas pull musky and fluffy on me. I kind of hated Cenobite, have a full-size but I'll be sending it to my BFF who loves it and used hers up.  Anna sounds gorgeous, and I love that it's not fresh/grassy. I tried SS Rose Mallow Cream but it was too simple, and seemed to be heavy on the mallow but light on the rose :)  I like some complex scents but...lately I've been sooo all about that layering life. It's helping me get more mileage from my collection and avoid buying new stuff :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,lgbtqbbq,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:43:00 2015 UTC,Possets is the same for me. My top ten is mostly Possets right now including a few scents I never thought I would like but got as free samples and loved (Betsy!).
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,mjolnir_mooncup,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:35:15 2015 UTC,Ooh Betsy sounds gorgeous. Possets The Damned Flower was that way for me (also got as a free sample).  Also your name is amazing...

Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,montycuddles,10,Mon Jul 13 02:40:11 2015 UTC,"I keep several things in mind:   Perfumers often have more than one source for any component, so approaching it like ""I don't like [Brand]'s (specific note)"" is not always helpful, and largely meaningless between brands.  It sucks to figure out which blends share what specific note you like, since you can't assume that every time they say (note) it's the same one between Blend A and Blend B. Additionally, don't assume any description is complete. What you are given are key notes, not ingredients lists. Nor are you necessarily able to smell all the key notes (which sometimes are there to just affect other notes). Plus, skin chem always changes. What you hated last year might not be the same this year, especially if you go through anything that definitely affects bodies (eg: pregnancy is the common example). I have a lot of perfume so I really need to be intrigued and I will be more ruthless in my choices.  Any reason not to be interested will be noted as a mark against purchasing.  So, yeah, there are lots of arguments for being open minded and trying everything, but it's in my favor to be discriminating and that's okay.   I decided to go through Possets Summer of Elegance to write out my elimination process:  4 Seasons Summer: The combo of bamboo, green shoots, and water immediately marks this as probably not.  I know from experience that I am selective about my green/aquatic perfumes.  And I have a personal distaste for bamboo as a note.  It never smells like the real thing!  Plus, incense is there too and while I am not anti-incense, I am wary of it.  Bikini Girls of Sicily:  Love the inspiration.  Initially promising with its mentions of myrtle honey, jasmine, pomegranate, and coumarin, I see the mention of bitter almond.  I don't like cherries, or almonds, or bitter.  But I am interested in expanding my perfume horizons so this is ADVENTUROUS MAYBE.  Birth of Venus:  Noped out as soon as I saw something about aquatic backdrop.  Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose: None of the notes alarm me.  A fresh garden scent, by its description, but I think I prefer real gardens to soliflores or garden perfumes anyday.  Low-priority maybe.  Dutch Adonis:  Initially pulled in by the name, I noped out when I saw violets, which I have grudgingly come to believe smells AWFUL on me.  Both Opus Oils and Arcana violets do this, and the OO one was too recent for me to try again.  And cumin can be very sweaty BO.  Too bad, I love masculines!  Flying Horse: Love the inspiration, but once again, there's that bamboo.  Worse, there's also ginger. Bleh.  Girl With A Watering Can: Some sort of gourmand. I am not really a fan of literal gourmands.  Plus that child in the painting is creepy.  NOPE.  Hay Wain:  Grapefruit is an iffy note on me, but I loved The Countess, a grapefruit-musk from Georgetown, so seeing it is not scary.  Plus I see it's paired with a supposed non-cupcakey vanilla (yay).  The crystal musk is my big risk here, but this is my ADVENTUROUS PROBABLY.  Hortus: I have no idea what ""fringe tree"" smells like and the other notes seem harmless, so this is CURIOUS PROBABLY.  Landscape in Suffolk:  Nothing exciting in the notes, but it looks lovely. If it hadn't been for my disastrous choices from Georgetown, I would have bought a half-bottle, I think.  I think it just registered as MAYBE IF SOMEONE ELSE HYPES IT.  Leda and the Swan:  I don't like strawberry scents. They smell so childish and air freshener on me.  I already own two strawberry scents I hardly wear.  Noped.  Luncheon on the Grass: Melon, skin musk, grass, and tea sounded curious, but also hard to imagine.  I remember Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, from Yule, was also a curiously messy blend with melon in it that just smelled like a weird melon.  Prior experience with this company makes me nix this one.  Mayan Queen Bloodletting Sacrifice:  I'm petty.  This is Lady Xoc, a Maya royal.  So right away, the naming puts this at a disadvantage.  I see the notes mention incense and, well, I have enough incense that I rarely wear.  Morning Walk: Like I said, picky with green smells. Pass.  Olympia: I have a thing where I just gotta keep trying hawthorne, I don't know why.  So automatically, this makes the list for decants.  Pendant Mask: Iffy. White florals, sandalwood, and musk are great, but in my experience, frankincense is overpowering and I don't need more incense.  WAIT FOR REVIEWS.  Portrait of Jane Small:  I love peaches, but this was released when I was feeling weird about deliberately abstaining from the Arcana Cravings release.  Timing issue.  Portrait of Mrs. Abington:  NO CAKES.  My perfumery Edna Mode motto, only instead of capes it's cakes.  Sea of Ice:  Okay, so I have that aquatics aversion, but mint and green tea ice cubes and birch intrigue me. This is an Adventurous Maybe.  Seascape:  Noped out when I saw the cannabis.  Ship of Fools: I like leather smells, but citruses are actually kind of a deterrent (I blame them for that room freshener impression). But nothing exciting, so this is a no.  Summer: The only iffy note is the ginger.  Seriously, eff ginger.  But I can't avoid ginger forever, and I'm willing to try new scents.  So Adventurous Maybe.  Summer (100% Natural):  Honestly, I skip Possets' natural stuff.  They're priced affordably, but if I wanted an all-natural, I'd probably go to a brand that specializes in it.  Plus it lists a bunch of citruses and mint and that's it. The longevity would be like a traditional eau de cologne, which are intentionally short-lived because they're supposed to refresh, and IMO refreshers are best in sprays, not oils.  Sunflowers:  Nothing wrong with this scent, I just don't need a honey scent right now.  If reviews persuade me, that's okay too.  The Duchess of Goya: There's that ginger again!  Ugh.  I like spices, but turmeric and cardamom and pepper and ginger?  Nah.  The Great Clod: This sounds lovely.  One of my first indie loves was KleanSpa Fig & Fern, so I have a fondness for fig + greens.  On the PROBABLY list.  The Swing:  Fragonard's art was considered extremely sexual and The Swing was no exception.  (Basically, it is HILARIOUS that Disney's Frozen shows Elsa and Anna's palace displaying this painting so prominently, let alone the scene where Anna mimics the pose.)  Considering the origin of the painting, I was hoping for something more sexy and am disappointed that it sounds too foody and pink.  The Windmill at Wijk:  VANILLA!  Okay, so it's ""marine"" vanilla, whatever that is, but it's described as dry, not an aquatic.  So YES VANILLA for me.  Tres Riches Heures: Too foody, and too vague for me to try it in spite of that.  Water Lilies:  Aquatic is the big mark against it.  And I don't like that painting.  Petty, sure, but there are innumerable perfumes in the world, so I will do anything I can to narrow it down.  So out of this release, I am only interested in a fraction of them. It's further reduced by budget, but I lucked out and managed to be around for Ajevie's decant circle, so I bought 4 decants. :)  I go through a similar process for every collection."

There's a different leather in Bee Tsar than there is in any of my other perfumes. It's more subtle, I think. And I've noticed differences between a few Possets blends that have caramel - it's not always the same character of caramel.   Also, super interesting to see your elimination process. Also, I didn't know that Olympia existed and since it's the name of my hometown I am VERY INTRIGUED."

I have Captain Peroxide, but though it's changed since I received it, it's become this smoked sugar musk smell on my skin that isn't bad, but is definitely too sweet for my everyday tastes."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,elephantabate,2,Mon Jul 13 05:44:24 2015 UTC,"Yup! It's still a fairly sweet perfume (for a cologne) but it is very much NOT Captain Peroxide. Totally different leather and tobacco. The honey is pretty similar to NOT THE BEES, though. But less honeysuckle."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,montycuddles,9,Mon Jul 13 05:52:13 2015 UTC,"The story involved in the descriptions can make or break the decision if I'm on the fence, but otherwise, it's notes. After years of sniffing and the hundreds of indie scents I have tried (ETA: I have 200-300 full bottles, and countless samples, not to mention what I've swapped off), I have a pretty good idea of whether or not I will like something, just not exactly how much I will like it.     Knowing what notes I like, work with my chemistry, and in conjunction with each other (to my nose) has been a matter of experience. It takes time, IMO."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,ninebythree,6,Mon Jul 13 02:11:55 2015 UTC,"I look at notes and see if it has a few notes I love. Then it goes to my ""maybe"" list. After that, I check to see if there are any notes I can't stand (pineapple) and nix it. The remaining scents for that brand are googled, and I read reviews if they are available. I actually dislike super long scent descriptions with ambiguous notes. I don't mind a narrative that sets the mood, but I still prefer to see a couple of main notes. I also avoid cinnamon and some ""spicy"" scents because I have super sensitive skin."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,normalcypolice,6,Mon Jul 13 03:41:24 2015 UTC,"I'm still new but if the description sounds like something I would want to close my eyes and smell then I'm game. Although I've realized that maple is a little too much for me, even if it is delicious!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,blueskiesandsun,3,Mon Jul 13 01:36:29 2015 UTC,"I typically go based on reviews + notes. Since now I make perfume, I know what notes I like more than I used to when I first started buying indie perfumes. Back then it was much more about what sounds good based on notes + descriptions.   The thing is, no perfume description is going to say ""It's amazing, but you personally, Abby, you will hate it."" I've gotten a few things based on general POETRY (ooh, crushed leaves! Dirty oil and leather!) and while it might be interesting and accurate, I know what I wear regularly and that is fruits and gourmands, with occasional ventures into other types.    I haven't yet decided on a definitive YES and BLEH note list are for me, since it's more art than science. If it's herbal, I often like it to be paired with lemon. If it's fruit, I often like it to be a bit creamy or sparkling. If it's a dessert, I probably want it in general. Chocolate perfumes have less success for me than cinnamon perfumes. Cinnamon oil doesn't disturb my skin too much, though I always keep an eye on how much it's diluted.   The most recent perfume buys for me have been total successes. The FS bottles I have are great and I reach for them all the time, and I've had a lot of fun working through samples. I'm trying to be more moderate with spending these days, but I will admit -   I bought Invidia purely because it was Hieronymus Bosch themed. I will not deny it. I am a weak, weak woman. Thank goodness Arcana works well for me when I make these rash FS blind buys."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,rekhiebaby,3,Mon Jul 13 04:36:05 2015 UTC,"When I first started playing around with Indies, I went 100% by description. I ended up with about 10 samples that were not my taste at all, and 3 that worked. From there I figured out what I liked and what I didn't, no matter how beautiful the description is!  I have notes/tags that I look for (tea, creamy, fresh, skin-like, honey, coffee) and some I avoid (Orange blossom, oudh, most food)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,LiberVix,3,Mon Jul 13 01:36:01 2015 UTC,"I go by notes as well. There's a handful that my nose rejects including violet, red musk, heavy patchoulis. I typically dislike notes that my skin amps so hard they drown out the rest of the scent, which I why I tend to avoid red musk. Descriptions can sway me; I like Arcana's a lot because they are short and very well-worded. I also like Darling Clandestine's but I do wish Evonne would include more clues as to the notes."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,LiberVix,3,Mon Jul 13 03:15:05 2015 UTC,"I should know better, but I can be a sucker for a description. I've been let down a few times, but there are some companies that I feel usually deliver. Meaning, the descriptions are long and detailed, but they do smell as described. Particularly, I think Solstice Scents is quite adept at explaining a scent both as a beautiful story, creating a scene, emotional mood, etc., and also does an exceptional job at describing the technical aspect of the scent from cold sniff to dry down. I know her Manor Collection was one of the first that really tugged at my heartstrings- I am enthralled by old houses, secret, hidden places steeped in memory, and I was amazed at how well the descriptions captured the scents, and I was quite satisfied by how the words translated into reality. So- anything super atmospheric, unusual, or emotionally evocative like that is going to capture my attention. I like scents that make me feel something.  I'm also always on the lookout for good thunderstorm/petrichor scents, and scents with dirt, tea, orange blossom, carnation, green notes (ivy, grass, etc.), salty aquatics, ginger, cardamom, pumpkin, leaves, peony, hyacinth, honeysuckle, coconut, lemon cake, carnival scents, apple, white musk, lots of things I'm likely forgetting.   Death notes are few and there have been exceptions- but I tend to avoid super fruity scents with strawberry, peach, grapefruit or cherry, and civet or strong jasmine."

It was special to me because growing up my parents would often take me on tours of old historical homes on vacations, and Manor reminded me exactly of the smells of those homes (so you're quite right!), that sweet, dusty smell that was so mysterious and a little melancholy, is just magical to me. I sampled it in my very first order from them in 2011- and I knew I would be a fan for life after that :)"

Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,mjolnir_mooncup,2,Mon Jul 13 01:46:01 2015 UTC,"I look for notes and sets of notes that either I like or sound like really interesting combinations. For example I recently blind bought Possets Issota and Sigismundo because I was really intrigued by the combination of sandalwood and banana.   If the notes aren't really listed, I have to go by the description or reviews.  While I do enjoy a good theme, I won't buy perfumes just because I like the names or themes."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,dellaluce,2,Mon Jul 13 01:50:48 2015 UTC,"I used to pick by what I thought I liked, a good description, and/or a good name. Now I just go by notes I like or an interesting combo of notes, though I can still be swayed by a good name or description."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,beautifulmess7,2,Mon Jul 13 01:53:47 2015 UTC,"So let's say a new collection is released, I go through every scent and immediately rule out anything that is either a) a gourmand b) a soft white floral or c) something fruity or ""mixed drink"" like, because my style tends toward goth/minimalist and all my clothes are black, sweet and femme isn't my style. This usually narrows it down a lot since these types of scents dominate most collections, especially in the spring and the summer. I'm left with incense/smokey, autumn, earthy, patchouli, humid florals, greens, and aquatics and all the overlaps. When I get free samples I try every single one, even if they have notes I don't usually like (except dry rose scents trigger migraines), and in this way I find some unexpected notes that I like in some GC scents. As I have tried over 200 scents, my acquisition has slowed because there's not a lot I don't have a dupe of at this point. If something has an interesting note that piques my curiosity or uses a common note in an uncommon way I'll try it. I recently ordered 7 blind FS scents from two companies that I not only loved, but was excited about 6 of them."

Especially if it's a concept that I love. 9/10 times I skip any introductory description and go straight to the meat of it.  Most of my decisions are based on notes. How many notes are notes I love (eg. ginger, sandalwood, etc), like, or don't usually get along with. There are some notes that are total dealbreakers (eg. lilac, linen) - I can't afford to keep spending money on notes that are very unlikely to work for me. This is usually just preference and at this point I have a pretty good idea of what I like and don't like, or what my skin chemistry doesn't like (or amps to hell and back). When I started, I read a LOT of reviews to have a better idea of how the notes would turn out together, as well as words that appealed to me in reviews or the description - spicy, dark, gothic, unisex, etc.  However, now that my collection is pretty big and I'm trying to cut back on perfume spending, I look mostly for things that would be unique in my collection. I'll pass on anything that looks too similar to things I already have (edit: except... gingerbread), and I'll zoom in on unique note combos, ""weird"" scents, and categories that are underrepresented in my collection (like fruits).  So, thought process: how many notes here do I like or love, are there any notes likely to cause a problem, does it look like the type of scent / overall effect of the notes in combination will appeal to me (doesn't matter if it has ginger if it's aiming for ""clean""), does it look like anything I have already, and does it fill a need in my collection."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,greenchipmunk,2,Mon Jul 13 02:32:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of times I am willing to take a bigger chance with 'atmospheric' scents than I am with other types of scents. Some of my favorites are carnival inspired or library inspired. I just got one that's supposed to smell lake-y. I relate to that. When I look for perfumes I like, I like knowing the notes that make up a scent, I am more likely to order from them if they're clear and not flowery descriptions. As for notes, that's just been trial and error. I've found things I like and ones I can't stand. I know mushroom anything is going to smell like roadkill on me and leather is going to smell glorious. I have an idea for the types of scents I like. If something is interesting enough, I'll get a sample if I can and see if it's worth getting more."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,RhinestoneHousewife,2,Mon Jul 13 02:39:46 2015 UTC,"I love a good description, but always try to balance it out by glancing at the notes. That said, a great name with a sentimental connection will always get my attention as well, but I still try to balance that urge to buy by studying notes and reviews of posters with similar taste if possible."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,RhinestoneHousewife,2,Mon Jul 13 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"The notes, for me. I like a theme that will remind me of food or events or places but overall I just look at the note list and go ""...hmm, yes let's try that""   I know I don't like florals, and from there I just go with what sounds good for me. Sometimes I'm wrong. If something sounds interesting but risky I might take a chance."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,RhinestoneHousewife,2,Mon Jul 13 03:03:45 2015 UTC,"I think about my look and attitude after all my makeup and clothes are sorted. I think of my perfumes in attitude classes, for the most part. So I ask myself: am I badass, soft, whimsical, edgy, classic, glamorous? My collection is moderate, big enough for selection, small enough that I know what's in it.   So, let's throw a few of my collection in categories:  soft, feminine   Solstice scents heat of the night (or something of the night? Solstice scents labels always fade on me quickly) Haus of Gloi Troika   Edgy (for lack of a better term)   Darling Clandestine the one with the stairs on the label Solstice Scents Cellar   Respectable   Darling Clandestine Serpentina   Sharp, sophisticated, a touch androgynous   Darling Clandestine Maudlin and Bedlam Solstice Scents Library Solstice Scents Covered Bridge (also kinds of edgy because I like dirt) Haus of Gloi Horseman   Fresh, Outdoors, Natural   Haus of Gloi Insalata Nocturna Solstice scents Outpost Darling Clandestine Gram Negative (smells mossy to me)   Fun, Desserty   Haus of Gloi Honeysuckle Lemon Curd Solstice Scents Damn. The one that smells like root beer and popcorn Solstice scents Lemon Ginger Creams   So yeah. There's a sample. I've been drinking and it's been a huge, tiring, happy and sad weekend. I'm off to bed."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,emmian,2,Mon Jul 13 05:56:19 2015 UTC,"I have a mental list of notes that just plain don't work (jasmine, patchouli, incense, and cinnamon) as well as notes that I don't really like (cake batter, pastry, girly florals, heavy musks, and cardamom). These are all based on trial and error. If any perfumes have a note from the first list, it is most always a no go.   On the other hand, if a perfume has berries, apples, peaches, almond, tea, or ginger, I would most likely try it depending on the other notes.   I also look at the store and read reviews. If it is a store where I have had a lot of success finding perfumes, I am more apt to try scents that are out of my comfort zone. If it is a shop where I may have had only one or two that worked, I am more leery about trying new things."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,RhinestoneHousewife,2,Mon Jul 13 13:17:29 2015 UTC,"When I was new to indie perfume, I went all by theme and description!

I mean, Tolkien wrote there too. The cafe/pub he kept writing in accidentally became my favourite hang out place, and I only realized Tolkien wrote there after I left Oxford XD  Maybe it's because Lewis Carroll based a lot of the scenes from places in Oxford? You can even see the dodo that inspired him in one of the museums. You can also see the secret door Alice's dad usually use to get in and out of the dining room, which inspired the rabbit hole in the story."

Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,elephantabate,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:24:22 2015 UTC,"For me, when I first try out a brand, I usually ask the shop owner to pick the scents for me so I get a great selection of scents that represent the brand. Once I'm familiar with the brand, this is how I decide:   Check out if there's any scent reviews from people with the same skin chem as me.  Check out the scent types that I think the brand does really well (fruits for Arcana, vanillas & citrus for Possets, gourmands for BathSabbath, etc.) Avoid reading the description because I'm a sucker for beautifully written prose and will buy everything that way. Snack so I'm not hungry and pick my perfumes based on what my stomach wants. Look out for the notes I like and see if there are any notes I'm iffy with (amber, patchouli, incense, osmanthus) and basically flip a coin to decide whether or not the iffy notes are worth risking.   As for deciding on what notes work for me, I now look more at what notes from what brand works for me. For example, vanillas and caramels are awesome and I love them, but certain types of vanillas and caramels can go sour on me. Vetiver sometimes turn into mung beans on me too.   When I really don't know how the notes smell like, I sometimes google ""[note] smells like"" and then try to imagine it from the descriptions I find through google."

Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,RhinestoneHousewife,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"I am relatively new to indie scents, and it's a little overwhelming to think about. I've never really been pig into perfume, although I love to smell good. I was really nervous because blind buying is scary and because scents can be a migraine trigger for me, I have to be careful.  That being said, I reached to scents that a) contain notes that I know I like already and b) have names or descriptions that resonate with me. My first two perfume from this past winter were Sixteen92 Red Velvet Hot Chocolate and Coconut Creme Hot Chocolate. The scents are nice, but a little too syrupy sweet for me. This made me think that I wasn't a fan of chocolate scents, so those are the only two I got.  I have a cat named Selkie, and when I saw HoG had a perfume named Selkie, I had to get it. Turns out I have an affinity for aquatic scents, and my husband wants to smell like a pirate. Win win. I saw that there is another company with a Selkie perfume too. Gonna have to get it.  I tend to scan the names of perfumes, and then look up the notes. I blind bought A Wizard's Fable from Alchemia Apothecary before the store closed, and I dunno how I feel. I love Harry Potter, don't love half of the scent.  Vanilla and tea notes work well with my skin chemistry. I found this by chance and managed to snag Two Finger Ballet and /r/hugofdeath, two full size blind buys I don't regret. I bought Blooddrop Interlude around the same time, and I do regret that.  I think for the most part, it is a matter of trial and error for me. Which reminds me to start wearing some of the scents I have that I haven't tried. I'm hooked on smelling good. I can't stop. I won't stop."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,elephantabate,3,Mon Jul 13 01:34:16 2015 UTC,I have Arcana's Erzulie's Soft Kiss pretty much just because I have a cat named Erzulie.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,RhinestoneHousewife,3,Mon Jul 13 02:21:08 2015 UTC,"That's a perfect reason. In fact, it might be the best reason. When Selkie came in the mail (the perfum, not the kitty) I was so excited."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2p5j,elephantabate,3,Mon Jul 13 02:22:04 2015 UTC,"Right!?! Now I don't feel so alone. My kitty is in her last days, so a scent with her name (even if it isn;t my favorite) still gives me warm fuzzies."

Certain areas lean towards certain fragrance families, and at different times of year- cinnamon and clove and other spices are SO common in the US in winter, but an article I read once said that overall the US prefers ""clean"" and inoffensive (lol) smells, so notes like linen or orange blossom (HoG Odette comes to mind). Brazil, on the other hand, is super into everything fruity all the time.  I wonder if scent anthropologists exist. There must be at least one in the world."

Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,teenadee,2,Mon Jul 13 05:10:12 2015 UTC,"From this place. Fast shipping, good prices. My only complaint is I got the 5ml rollerballs and I'm pretty sure some of the rollerballs were definitely under 5 mils. I filled up a couple using bottles from HoG and Possets (which look to be the same size bottle, so 6ml) and I still had a good third left in the bottle when I was done. That was filling up the rollerball almost to the brim. So I definitely recommend 10ml ones!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,doubleosepti,7,Mon Jul 13 13:59:33 2015 UTC,"I use a variety of Real Techniques and elf brushes (both the $1 and the $3 variety) to apply my makeup.   Regarding the elf brushes, there are some decent eyeshadow brushes in the $1 category, but $1 face brushes should be avoided at all costs, as they are extremely scratchy. The $3 blush brush and powder brush are quite soft, however, and I haven't had any problems with shedding.   I really like the Real Techniques fine liner brush for applying shadow as liner. My method, in case anyone is curious: shake a small amount of eyeshadow on the lid of the jar, put a drop of contact solution on the back of my hand, wet the brush so that it's not too wet, and mix the wet brush with eyeshadow in the lid of the eyeshadow jar. Then, just wipe out the excess, which is usually pretty minimal."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,badluckbelle,3,Mon Jul 13 02:18:31 2015 UTC,"The $3 elf complexion brush is FANTASTIC. Although I don't contour/highlight, it's really good for blending out blush (I apply blush by picking some up on my finger and smearing it on my cheeks where I want it, then blending). It's also ridiculously soft.  Also, sort of random, but have you considered using Darling Girl's Superstar Serum to make liquid liners out of shadows? I've heard it works really well, but I've never tried the contact solution method so it may work just as well."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,THE_DINOSAUR_QUEEN,3,Mon Jul 13 14:12:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion! I have thought about it, but so far the contact solution method is working well (my liner lasts throughout the day and doesn't smudge), so it doesn't seem worth it. Plus, I know that the contact solution won't irritate my eyes.   If someone were able to demonstrate Superstar Serum works much better, I would consider it. But for now, I prefer my cheap method. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,badluckbelle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:54:55 2015 UTC,"That sounds really cool, actually--now I wish I had contact solution so I could compare the two, since I'm getting an order of Superstar Serum in today. Do you have any pictures of the contact-liner that I could see?"

Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,THE_DINOSAUR_QUEEN,3,Mon Jul 13 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"Here's Shiro Maiden Queen as a liner. The left swatch is over bare skin and right one is over UDPP. Primer isn't necessary, but it makes the color a little more vivid and, as you can see, prevents the shadow/liner from seeping into the tiny lines in my hands and blurring."

Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,badluckbelle,5,Mon Jul 13 16:40:40 2015 UTC,I quite like the Sonia Kashuk Small Eyeshadow Brush for my loose eyeshadows. The shape is small enough that it can easily fit on my eye and the natural hair bristles means it holds onto powders way easier.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,mightymai,3,Mon Jul 13 00:17:06 2015 UTC,"I like the $1 ELF brush more than the $3 one. The $3 C is perfectly fine, but the $1 is smaller and easier for me to control. I use it for shade application, highlight, and quick shading (though the $1 ELF crease/blending brush helps a lot too)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,kadytheredpanda,4,Mon Jul 13 01:47:03 2015 UTC,"For packing on color I use a couple of cheapo brushes I had laying around, from a set I got ages ago at Forever 21 iirc. They're synthetic, super flat, and fairly thin. I've found they're perfect because they grab onto color and lay it down over Pixie Epoxy flawlessly. I have a larger one and a smaller one that fits just right into tube-shaped samples too. I also have brushes from ELF, Real Techniques, EcoTools, but my go-to brushes for indie shadows are those Forever 21 brushes. And for blending into the crease I actually really like the Sonia Kashuk fluffy blending brush. Just got the MAC 217 and love it, but the SK brush gives a bit more of a diffused look imo, which I like personally."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,unthriftyloveliness,3,Mon Jul 13 02:34:32 2015 UTC,My go-tos are the MAC 217 for crease work and a duo fibre brush for blushes. Duo fibre brushed make applying indie blushes a dream since some can be so pigmented. I like using dense eyeshadow brushes for lid colours since it reduces the chance of fallout (Sigma has some pretty good ones but I can't remember the names right now).
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,SirWaffalot,3,Mon Jul 13 00:28:06 2015 UTC,"I've had really great luck with the two fluffy blending brushes from the Real Techniques eye set. They're synthetic and to an amazing job of blending! I actually plan on picking up a few more! For packing on color, I have a couple elf shader brushes that are super densely packed. I prefer the studio line, but I have a few of the cheaper ones that work well."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,krysiefishie,3,Mon Jul 13 00:44:27 2015 UTC,"I've had good luck with the brush that came with the first Naked palette for packing on lid colors.   The ELF crease brush is super great, too. I have one that's managed to become a little tapered, and I haven't managed to find one like it again. It's perfect for the lower lash line, the inner corner...and yes, the crease.   Also the glass wands that Smelly Yeti uses for their full size bottles are A+ and I really wish more indie perfumers would use them."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,kazaanabanana,3,Mon Jul 13 01:26:11 2015 UTC,"I use the RealTechniques blush brush with my indie blushes and I find it's quite good! Because it's tapered the way it is, I can just pick up a little swirl of blush on the end, pat it on where I want it to be most intense, and then blend it around. :) I've also been using just a clean cheap duofibre to soften/blend my blush/highlight/contour when it looks a little too in-your-face."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,dictura,3,Mon Jul 13 03:05:36 2015 UTC,"I use....my fingers. ohthehorror But in all seriousness, I use my fingers to pat on loose eyeshadow when and where I want more payout, usually the center of my lid or inner corner. I use the Sonia Kashuk eyeshadow brushes, I like the black handled brush for lid color, the white handled medium shadow for everything (it's an unsung hero, it can pack, blend, and detail depending how you hold it, zomg), and the white handled large crease brush for blending harsh lines. Then I use a private label/qosmedix crease brush for my crease, an extra long tapered crease brush for all over blending, and a pencil brush for my outer v.  Edit: wording"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,blackdustbelt,2,Mon Jul 13 08:48:58 2015 UTC,"For eye-shadow, I like using the brush that came with my Naked 3 palette :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,nixedreamer,2,Mon Jul 13 02:32:16 2015 UTC,Coastal Scents brushes. I've found that they work way better for me than the elf ones (the $1 ones) I had.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d2gup,savahontas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:56:01 2015 UTC,A brush like the third from the left on the main picture of this set is awesome for packing on color IMO: http://www.amazon.com/EmaxDesign%C2%AE-Professional-Synthetic-Foundation-Cosmetics/dp/B00FZKB51S/
Indiemakeupandmore,3d3s5w,lgbtqbbq,6,Mon Jul 13 08:00:20 2015 UTC,"So I just got my Sixteen92 package that USPS was apparently holding hostage (yay!) which means the sweet /u/vanityclaire who was very concerned about all the delays can relax about my order at least.  I received Eternal Return as a perfume oil sample in my last order, and fell in love. So I ordered the EDP because I wanted longevity and throw. I'll do a mini review because I'm wearing it now.  On first application (spritz) it's got that characteristic alcohol-woah-nose-tickliness that you get from conventional perfumes. That settles down quickly. Initially it was a ""flatter"" version of my beloved E.R. oil, a little muted and green and planty but not rich like the original. The longer it sits on my skin though, the more the other components surface and I get the sweet and savory earthiness I loved in the original. It might be still slightly less complex than the oil...I almost feel like it's smoothed out and more sophisticated but less realistic? But at first it was like 50% as complex, now it's basically 85%-90% to my nose. So that's acceptable to me. I smell more of the peat moss, galbanum, and something like honey which I didn't get in the original. Less sun-warmed oak than last time, and now that I think of it it could be the beetroot pulling sweeter on me and giving me that honey feel. Also the throw is WAY magnified, so that's AWESOME. I can smell me without sniffing my wrists!!!!  If i hadn't already purchased Guerlain Vetiver for my dad for Father's Day I would buy him a bottle of this. It's JUST perfumed enough that your average Joe/Jane won't be like ewwww dirty garden, but rich and complex and funky because it's not just straight cologne/perfume. This would be gorgeous on a dude. I will be sneak-attack spritzing mine with this furr sure. [edit] Now I've been wearing it for about an hour and it definitely is smoother than the perfume oil- much more like a mainstream scent. It smells a very much like Hermes Jardin Sur le Nil, which is great. I can't tell if I want to get this in the oil version too, because that one seemed more...juicy and overflowing with ripe green plant scent. This is almost too sophisticated...  I like this EDP formula a lot. Solstice Scents is releasing EDPs this month too and I have a feeling I'll be ordering a few of those."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d3s5w,jujicakes,2,Mon Jul 13 15:38:14 2015 UTC,Today I'm wearing:   Darling Clandestine KelahWhirl Pumpkin and Poppy Oak Bark
Indiemakeupandmore,3d3s5w,aquariustbh,2,Mon Jul 13 15:41:15 2015 UTC,"Today I tried Blackberry Buckle from OHWTO. Usually I love their fruity scents, but something about this is not working on me. When I smelled it out of the bottle and wet on my skin, it was like a delicious pastry with blackberries. Then it settled, and smelled like Trix cereal, super powdery and artificial. Currently, it smells like medicine."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d3s5w,lgbtqbbq,2,Mon Jul 13 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"Aw nooo I looove Blackberry Buckle. It can be a little sharp/deep so you might try layering it with either another pastry scent, a strong creamy vanilla, or something with a mellower fruit, maybe a creamy strawberry or raspberry if you have it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d3s5w,aquariustbh,2,Mon Jul 13 16:42:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for these suggestions!! I layered Sixteen92's Wicked with it, which comes across as super vanilla on me, and it smells a lot closer to what I imagined."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d3s5w,lgbtqbbq,2,Mon Jul 13 20:55:05 2015 UTC,"Already commented but I've been slathering myself with my Sixteen92 lotion minis that I got and I LOVE THEM ALL. I got Root Beer, Coconut Custard, and Blood Orange & Vanilla. The Root Beer is earthy and sweet and more long-lasting than its hair spray equivalent. Blood Orange & Vanilla is bright and citrusy and smooth. Coconut Custard is perfectly uncloying toasted coconut flakes and cream. None of the scents are terribly strong or long-lasting. I can smell them well on initial application,  but they fade to a whisper. I will probably wear my Theda lotion which I already had with my new Theda EDP, and I think I'll pair The Grass Harp lotion (got in a swap) with Eternal Return EDP. I think the lotion formula is great and though they aren't enough scent alone, they'll be great for layering."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d3s5w,-drbadass-,2,Mon Jul 13 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"eyes: HW Timeline, it's been a while since I put this on. Foiled it with DGSS. It does apply a bit sheer when foiled so I had to apply a few layers.    Perfume: DC Grace. Idk, I'm tired and I need something comforting. I just realized that I'm getting a lot of the oud, as well as a good amount of hot, sharp ginger.  For some reason I forgot this had oud in it. I forgot to grab Hellbender today (for more gingery goodness) so I'm not sure what I'll do when it wears off.  I only have Homespun and Cloudswing with me which are a lot brighter.    And more: just got this shirt from Etsy and I'm loving it!"

Not sure how I feel about it, part of me likes it but it also smells like vinegar and 7up had a baby. I think I prefer the oil format because it smells less sour on my skin and a bit more floral."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d3s5w,j-dusk,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:39 2015 UTC,"BPAL Ogun today. It's a warm summer day but I didn't want anything too light, and I figured Ogun had melon, so. Well, the dark tobacco and honey are definitely making this feel a bit heavy for today. I also think this might be too sweet for me. I like it, but it's almost cloying."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d3s5w,amaijala9792,2,Mon Jul 13 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"Decided that I shall not obey the ""Dark Lip in the Fall"" rule and wore MAC Cyber with indies on the rest of my face.

I smelled fresh (as if I just got out of a nice cold shower) in the middle of the day amidst a bunch of super stinky geeks at Comic Con. That's how ""fresh"" this was to me.    It's light enough as a morning scent but the musk stays for the rest of the day and this becomes on of those ""my skin but better"" scent (or at least I'd like to think of my skin to smell this delicious). I love that the pear was kept light and dainty, similar to smelling the ripe fruit, without exaggerating it and having it turn into a heavy high school mean girls perfume. Can I get this in lotion, hair oil, soap, shampoo, conditioner format please"

From top to bottom - Riot dupe, Salem dupe, Cashmere dupe.   I only have sample sizes of these so I can't speak of the full sizes. The formula reminds of the MAC matte lipstick formula, perhaps a bit less matte but pretty much just your standard creamy matte lipstick. Not super drying to me, but also not moisturizing, not a Chapstick or anything. With a wear time that is typical of a creamy matte lipstick. Don't order from this company if you are expecting a dupe of limecrimes formula, this is not a liquid to matte formula. I don't own the limecrime versions of these colors so I can't speak to how close of dupes they are but I mean I'm happy with them and they're close enough for me!   All in all I had a positive experience with this company, no shipping issues, I didn't have to contact the company, received my order on time, happy with the product I received. I know some people have had negative experiences but I just wanted to put my two cents in about my positive experience. So I'd recommend to order with caution I guess."

Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,speakstruth,9,Sun Jul 12 17:38:28 2015 UTC,Just a heads up - the hair oil is already listed under the general hair oil listing (just scroll down in the scents).  My shopping is already done and the release hasn't even officially started yet :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,veryearlyriser,2,Sun Jul 12 18:25:36 2015 UTC,"Woo, thank you for noticing that and sharing! :D"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,benoit_balls,2,Sun Jul 12 18:34:58 2015 UTC,Thank you! I just wanted hair oil so this was great to know!

Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,Floofulls,2,Sun Jul 12 19:05:28 2015 UTC,"Trippy Hippy is screaming my name. I was just telling a friend this, but I have a weird relationship with lavender- I'm not a fan of it on its own, but when paired with interesting notes it's AMAZING. Arcana Bonfires at Dusk is a really good example.  That, plus patchouli and vanilla is always an amazing combination and I say that as someone who doesn't like patchouli at all."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,solar-storm,2,Sun Jul 12 17:53:02 2015 UTC,Aaah. I LOVE blueberry and I have not found a good blueberry scent so I must try this. I've been loving lavender too. so Blueberry Pie and Trippy Hippy for me.

Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,benoit_balls,2,Sun Jul 12 19:03:00 2015 UTC,Eep! My first Haus Reverie :) I kept it simple though--just perfume samples of Sugga and Blueberry pie :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,bekobekodesu,3,Sun Jul 12 19:26:06 2015 UTC,"Aw man it ALL SOUNDS SO GOOD! Gotta get me some Sugga, Boca Chica, and Blueberry Pie!  Wondering! If I can snag some, would anybody be interested in splitting a Sugga or Boca Chica hair oil?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,benoit_balls,2,Sun Jul 12 17:40:43 2015 UTC,I'm willing to split for the hair oil!
Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,bekobekodesu,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:53:32 2015 UTC,Killer!! Which one are you most interested in?
Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,snoralax,2,Sun Jul 12 18:18:15 2015 UTC,I'm honestly fine with either since both of them have notes I really enjoy. But for hair oil I'll probably go for Boca Chica since it has the floral notes in it to make it more suitable for the hair.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,hellatkk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:32:05 2015 UTC,"Yay, got Boca Chica and Sugga! Just lemme know what you might like :)"

Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,pwnyanthem,2,Sun Jul 12 17:58:33 2015 UTC,I have no idea sorry! I do know that the full sizes tend to be smaller than their regular or seasonal products.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,Floofulls,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:01:09 2015 UTC,"Good to know, thank you!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,hellatkk,2,Sun Jul 12 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"The pumpkin butters and scrubs have always been just one size- kind of a halfling between sample and full sizes. I know I have some sample size perfumes of past reverie scents though, so those may be available as both."
Indiemakeupandmore,3d15ex,retroquirk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:45:15 2015 UTC,They did with the last couple Reveries (for the perfume oil)!

Happy they're offered in in-between sizes - I can never finish full sizes of anything but bath products, but I feel like minis are just a touch too small. 4 oz is a good middle ground!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d1gn6,sentimentmachine,3,Sun Jul 12 19:10:38 2015 UTC,Blueberry pie already gone... Guess they made the choice to purchase even easier this time! XD

Indiemakeupandmore,3d1gn6,Dahlianeko,3,Mon Jul 13 00:00:16 2015 UTC,The hair oil can also be used on your legs after a shower/shave! It makes my legs feel so silky. I'm almost done with my Odette bottle!

Indiemakeupandmore,3cze7f,Ohmyenvy,3,Sun Jul 12 04:11:36 2015 UTC,I think this month might be my favorite Visage that's come out so far! I wonder how the highlight will compare to Golden Veil in terms of how it looks on the skin. The sheen looks gorgeous!
Indiemakeupandmore,3cze7f,ashleemalfoy,2,Sun Jul 12 13:12:25 2015 UTC,"Just from looking at them and not swatching side by side, awoke at dawn is much more rosey. Golden veil is much more of a true gold where awoke at dawn has a rose gold look. I'll test today if they show up differently on the skin."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cze7f,therealbayonetta,2,Sun Jul 12 15:18:17 2015 UTC,That packaging with the star charms is so precious! How is the opacity of the lip color?
Indiemakeupandmore,3czfip,PeopleInMyHead,3,Sun Jul 12 04:26:17 2015 UTC,These are the new colors that where released during the anniversary sale on July 1. I must have been one of the first orders because it said the TAT was a month and I had them in 10 days. I'm really excited about all these new colors especially Everything Looks Better On A Meat Hook which kind of reminds me of the infamous blue brown color in the Wet N Wild Comfort Zone palette. I haven't gotten to actually wear them all yet. I bought them all in full size along with 4 others. The sale was too good to pass up. At this point my MPZ collection has surpassed any other indie or non indie makeup I own. I have around 20 full size eyeshadows and 2 full size blushes not to mention how many samples I have. I have a problem with MPZ because I haven't found a color I don't want yet.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cynhu,kadytheredpanda,2,Sun Jul 12 02:45:13 2015 UTC,"You say you need to work on your application but seriously it is already quite good, blending could be better yes but the wing is sharp and the whole line looks steady even up close.   Did you use tape or did you go free handed?   Anyway props, I like the result : )"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cynhu,rinacee,2,Sun Jul 12 08:21:17 2015 UTC,Thanks! I free-handed but used the elf makeup remover pen to clean up the parts that went wonky.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d035u,hollivore,5,Sun Jul 12 10:14:53 2015 UTC,The only indie companies I can think of in the UK do perfume/soaps or nail polish.  Making pencils is very hard and I honestly don't think there are truly indie stores that make them. You're probably  better off going with a niche brand like Illamasqua.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d035u,whereismydragon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:24:34 2015 UTC,There's some UK eyeshadows too :-)

Indiemakeupandmore,3d035u,txteva,2,Mon Jul 13 07:18:32 2015 UTC,That's an... interesting ingredients list there.

Indiemakeupandmore,3d035u,whereismydragon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:02:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that does sound odd although it seems to be in a number of eyeshadows e.g. NYX"
Indiemakeupandmore,3d035u,txteva,4,Mon Jul 13 10:51:00 2015 UTC,I assume you want something on the cheaper side? I don't think there is one but if you want a decent white I have had good results with the Barry M waterproof pencils. They are about £4.   It's not white (more of a cream but still fairly light) but my favourite creamy kohl that lasts is Illamasqua's Vow.
Indiemakeupandmore,3d035u,Boobtape,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know any indies but you should try the nyx jumbo pencil in milk. Its matte and very opaque, I use it on my waterline, as a shadow base, as a highlight, its amazing."

For those of you new to our Reverie items, I'll give you some details on what they're about, how long they're around, etc. Reverie products are very small, very limited batches of products released with no restocks. Once it's gone, it's gone! Sometimes I'll have some ideas running around in my head and if we have time between major holiday releases, we will put out a round of whatever I create. Sometimes a Reverie scent will become so popular that we will bring it back, depending on demand and sometimes it will even go General Catalog as was the case with our hugely popular Cozy Sweater.   On to the goodies! We have some new stuff and one returning scent...  Sugga Brown sugar, lemon zest and benzoin. (Bubbling scrub, Pumpkin butter, Perfume oil, Hair oil)  Boca Chica  Rich gardenia blossom, red mandarin, coconut cream and ripe banana. (Bubbling scrub, Pumpkin butter, Perfume oil, Hair oil)  Blueberry Pie Simple! Pie crust and blueberries.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,j-dusk,49,Sat Jul 11 12:04:43 2015 UTC,"I like the updated rules for Sunday Swap threads. It makes it much more clear what can be posted outside the main thread, and I've noticed a lot less clutter emerging outside of that thread. I'm fairly neutral on the comment scores being hidden for a few hours. I didn't like it being hidden for 24 hrs because it felt like too much was being hidden, like we didn't trust each other as a community and I had to secretly whisper ""good job"" to people. I haven't paid enough attention to notice what 3 hours has done for people in terms of downvoting. I like the monthly introduction thread. I think it makes this sub feel more welcoming. I think the low participation on ""How Indie are You Today?"" is partially to do with the way the thread is phrased. Scent of the Day was specific - what are you wearing, and is there any particular reason for it? It encouraged people to share reviews and talk a bit about their day (eg. I have a big meeting today and I'm stressed so I wanted something comforting like vanilla). How Indie Are You Today just asks the title question and asks for a pic or to ""let us know what indies you're wearing."" Answering the title question is an issue because a. it's very repetitive (""I'm completely/very/half/not very/only a little indie today"") and b. it feels competitive (if I'm only wearing perfume, does it mean I'm not indie enough?). I felt kind of weird because the only indies I wear are perfume, but I didn't want to say ""I'm barely indie"" every day when I'm not even wearing non-indie makeup. Nor do we want to alienate people who still like using a lot of mainstream products. Even the second question just prompts you for a list, which is what I mostly see there, and it's not very engaging. I'm kind of confused as to why SotD didn't turn into Indies of the Day with a similar ""What are you wearing and is there any special reason?"" Because you could just as easily say ""I'm wearing __ because it's a bold red lip that makes me feel like a badass, and I paired it with _ and _ to keep my eyes neutral and the focus on my lips."" That's much more interesting to read than a bulleted list, and tells readers a lot more about the products, making it helpful. Then you can read through the thread and go ""hey I love bold reds I should check that out."" Okay, ending this ramble. I haven't seen an issue with throwaways being used for abuse. Generally I've seen them used when someone wants to voice a controversial opinion and is afraid of getting a downvote brigade. I think it's important to hear out controversial opinions and I think banning throwaways could inadvertently censor them."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,19,Sat Jul 11 15:41:16 2015 UTC,"You're spot on with the How Indie Are You Today thread.  The phrasing feels very competitive, and it doesn't really allow for interesting discussion in the community. I posted once or twice, but have felt like if I don't have a bunch of indie products to list my contribution will not be good enough.    Right now the thread feels like a search for ""the indiest of them all"" or something. I don't want to be the loser who only used a few, or feel bad or pressured that my shampoo and conditioner and foundation and mascara and whatever else isn't indie.   Then if I do have a decent amount of indie stuff on, saying ""Very, yay!"" and listing a bunch of products is boring.  I am even bored with my own post by the end.  I stopped opening the thread because what's the point? The comments are sparse anyway, and it's difficult to start a real conversation. I just skip it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,lisaplusplus,10,Sat Jul 11 19:07:24 2015 UTC,"thanks for sharing your thoughts. I think you brought up some really good points on everything you mentioned. I especially like the exact issues you pointed out for the ""how indie are you threads"", it's become pretty obvious this needs to be changed."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,SurreptitiousSerpant,5,Sat Jul 11 15:51:05 2015 UTC,"Totally agreed about the ""how indie are you"" phrasing. I never participate bc my answer everyday would be ""not very- one perfume, no makeup."""
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,FellowFresno,29,Sun Jul 12 17:47:28 2015 UTC,I'm just going to add that I also really miss the scent of the day thread... I've tried to participate in the replacement thread but its too all over the place and inactive.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,cuculine,8,Sat Jul 11 15:06:27 2015 UTC,this is a common concern throughout the thread and something we are definitely considering changing. thank you for your feedback.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,FellowFresno,5,Sat Jul 11 15:33:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! We're going to be reviewing the daily thread again. But in the mean time, we are thinking of bringing in more recurring threads to the discussion calendar which can include one for perfumes."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,19,Sat Jul 11 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"I tend to lean slightly anti-regulation in general, so in IMAM that seems to translate as well.  I don't really like hiding the comment scores, banning throwaways and the increasing limits on post content.    Specifically for throwaways- what's the difference from just deleting inappropriate comments?  That way if someone needs anonymity to make a (legit) point, they still can.  ETA:  I love weekly Sunday swap day, and think the rotation is a good compromise.  While about 20% of it repeats week to week, I enjoy looking every week.  I know there is the other sub and MUE but the more casual nature of swap day makes it easier for me to buy and to swap.  I still MUE but it's not worth it for 1-4 things..."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,glitterwrists,4,Sat Jul 11 16:09:23 2015 UTC,"Throwaways have often been created to make accusatory, rude or inflammatory comments, with a handful created to post controversial topics. They rarely have any liability compared to an account that the user invested more time and effort in. Of course there are a few exceptions, but this is what we have seen for the most part, especially in emotionally-fueled threads.    The moderation of throwaways is the main point of discussion with banning just being an idea that has been thrown around. We can set certain criteria for accounts posting in the sub regarding account age or comment karma for example. The question then will be what criteria will be best suited for the sub of our size?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,eraser_dust,17,Sat Jul 11 16:44:51 2015 UTC,"I know I and several others made accounts just to participate at IMAM, even if we're not involved anywhere else on Reddit.  If there had been an age or comment karma rule back then, I would not have joined the community.  At that point, we'd have to decide if discouraging new members is worth deterring throwaways.  Personally, I do not think so."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,rekhiebaby,18,Sat Jul 11 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"I understand, I just don't agree.  It's a cure that's not worth the cost, IMO."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,homicidalunicorns,13,Sat Jul 11 16:49:41 2015 UTC,"Agree. Why set account age and comment requirements? As a new person just finding this sub that would make me feel excluded. This should be a welcoming place for everyone.  Deleting inflammatory or harassing comments seems like the best course of action to me.  It works everywhere else, why wouldn't that be enough here?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,toxidlotus,13,Sat Jul 11 19:12:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think the issue is not necessarily whether the accounts are established or not, but the rude comments or the unfounded claims they may make. I think removing rude or inflammatory comments and cracking down on providing proof for claims against companies will serve that purpose just fine."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,3,Sat Jul 11 17:07:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think banning throwaways are the way to do it, even though I've encountered crazy throwaways. The thing is, reddit's been around for so long that some people have 1 year old throwaways too. I've been harassed by at least 2 accounts that look like throwaways, but they're old throwaways. What made me think they're throwaways is the fact that they're created over 6 months ago to post a post in bullying sort of subs (don't want to advertise them), then go inactive for months until they started harassing. The accounts are also no longer active after they're done harassing me and the mods deleted their posts.  Its so difficult to identify throwaways that way, so I don't think I'm for banning them."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,toxidlotus,20,Mon Jul 13 01:17:26 2015 UTC,"I might be risking some down votes, but following my short convo with /u/PhyrraNyx below, I'm curious what people think about sales posts.  I'd personally like a weekly thread (with flair) where people can post about sales they've come across. I'd be okay with banning brand owners from posting to conform with the self-promotion rules. I think /r/MakeupAddicts has/had a thread like this but that sub isn't very active and focuses on mainstream cosmetics.   I know there are people who don't want much focus on buying, which I do understand. Participation and inclusion in this sub should not be associated with buying all the things. I also want to sub to remain a safe and comfortable place for those on a budget/low buy/no buy.  I'm not readying a campaign for such a thread, I'd just like to hear other opinions and perspectives :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,PhyrraNyx,10,Sun Jul 12 05:24:45 2015 UTC,"I also forgot to note! Starting this coming Wednesday, we'll be having a monthly low/no-buy support thread! :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,homicidalunicorns,6,Sat Jul 11 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! It'll be nice to have a home bubble of support, since many people (including myself) on no/low buys either don't go to MUR or don't want to cut IMAM out."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,homicidalunicorns,7,Sat Jul 11 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who sometimes needs the kick in the butt to be reminded to not buy EVERYTHING, it'll be nice to have a indie-focused no buy/low buy support thread here in IMAM :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,otterhugs,18,Sat Jul 11 22:58:06 2015 UTC,I like the sale posts. Personally I think the community should have better post flair so we could add links to the sidebar to filter them. Doing that would allow people to see what they want to see and ignore things they don't want to see like sales posts.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,rekhiebaby,5,Sat Jul 11 23:36:15 2015 UTC,"Agree. I like the post flair idea, and I think a weekly sale thread or sale flair could make it easier for those of us who still have lots to explore in the indie world."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,mallowleaves,7,Sat Jul 11 22:19:35 2015 UTC,Post flair would probably be helpful to a lot of people.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,mallowleaves,5,Sat Jul 11 23:45:29 2015 UTC,This sounds like a great idea.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,8,Sat Jul 11 23:47:11 2015 UTC,"There's really no reason right now why people couldn't start a weekly sales post. We had a really great user /u/ashhole613 who was always on the ball with posting sales, I was really disappointed that she ended up leaving because of downvotes. As with a lot of our problems, we really can't control downvotes and it's unfortunate that people end up leaving or not sharing those types of posts because of it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,daisyismydog,10,Sun Jul 12 03:05:23 2015 UTC,"While in theory I really like the idea of a weekly sales thread, in practice it unfortunately has serious flaws- namely, IMAM is a fairly active subreddit and things get buried quickly. I'm part of one or two other subs that do weekly sales threads, and one is far less active than IMAM. The thread still gets buried within two days and it's annoying to have to sift through other posts to find it.  I totally agree with you on the sub remaining a welcome place for people on low/no buys! Lately there's been a bit of a shift, I think, from rampant NEW THINGS BUY BUY BUY consumerism to more thoughtful purchases and discussions thereof, and it's been really lovely. I hope it continues!  Edit: I should clarify that I do also disagree with banning brand owners from self-promoting- while IMAM's current self-promotion rules are a little messy, I like the interaction with owners."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,daisyismydog,5,Sat Jul 11 22:07:49 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind me asking, do you have any suggestions for how we could clean up the self-promotion rules? We were trying to make things clear with our updates to those rules but if they still seem messy we'd love to know how we can improve them :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,8,Sat Jul 11 22:09:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was specifically thinking of the post minimum for brand owners. Other than that, I'm totally fine with the guidelines- I'd actually thought the blogger post limits were still in effect, so joke's on me for not actually having read that wiki page in a while.   The owner post/comment minimum just seems a bit excessive to me- 7 over 2 weeks isn't a lot, but it can be if you're preparing a release, generally busy, or just dealing with life. It indirectly requires owners take IMAM into account when scheduling sales or releases if they want to post announcements themselves or just post their own brand's content.   I'm pretty far from a brand fangirl (and my concerns with this really aren't just ""wah we're making poor owners do stuff"", I promise), but I think we sometimes seriously underestimate the traffic of IMAM and the degree to which our subscribers make up some brands' customer bases. If most of an owner's business comes from here and they haven't been as active as they're required to be, they might reconsider doing things like flash sales, or reschedule releases entirely.  It puts them at a disadvantage, and at the same time also disadvantages us. If they can't post, then we as their customers may not receive notice of a sale or release, and this in turn leads to less content (hauls, swatches, reviews, discussions, etc.).  I do think the rule is helpful to some extent, and would be against totally getting rid of it as it has seriously helped diminish self-promotion without participation, and encourages owners to be more integrated with the community. It just needs reworking.  Unfortunately, I don't have any sort of clear solution to the problem, aside from ""at your discretion and judgment"". It's tricky, for sure, to have to figure out the line between spam and self-promotion, and to make sure owners that DO fulfill the requirement aren't just shitposting to fill a quota. I think you guys have done a good job so far with finding balances in rules (e.g., comment hiding period). :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,floral__green,3,Sun Jul 12 01:47:26 2015 UTC,"These are some really great points, and the owner guidelines is definitely something we'll be discussing as a team because we've gotten a lot of good feedback from everyone in this thread. I agree it's a tough balance though, and we don't want to make any feel discouraged from posting here but we do want to stop spam, or people just dropping in to flog their brand and then disappearing until the next time they want to generate buzz (not that I'm accusing anyone of having done this!)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,10,Sun Jul 12 02:25:40 2015 UTC,"Technically Reddit rules for self promotion follow a 1/10 ratio where for every one post or comment you're using to promote yourself you should be contributing 10 other non promotional comments or posts. I think the time limit of two weeks is what could make the rule hard on brand owners, if they're following Reddits 1/10 rule (where maybe 7/10 or something are in IMAM if you guys want to do that) i wouldn't have a problem with them posting promotional stuff even if their non promotional comments/posts happen over the course of several months. I agree with the rule otherwise though in regards to not counting posts/comments that happen on the same day and limiting it to two a week/four a month."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,kieratea,4,Sun Jul 12 03:45:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think about the thread getting buried, thank you for bringing that up! That would be problematic and defeat the purpose. I remember a couple Black Friday threads got buried last year.  I also agree that the shift in culture has been refreshing. I love that there are more reviews of products and discussions lately.   I also like owner interaction and feel that we haven't quite reached comfortable rules for brand owner posting yet."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,4,Sun Jul 12 04:36:18 2015 UTC,"Personally, I love sales posts. But some have mentioned that it could get a bit spammy and promote the ""BUY BUY BUY"" mentality. It also won't capture any flash sales, and then there's the thing with brand owner self-promotion. Maybe we can start with a user-generated post and see how it works out from there?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,SirWaffalot,15,Sat Jul 11 22:39:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of people on here-I preferred the Scent of the Day thread. It honestly kind of bugs me that it was changed; I understand why, but it was started by a user. I'd just rather see that as a daily thread than have the mods try to come up with some new compromise. I mean, I'm all for more discussion threads but for some reason I just feel strongly about the Scent of the Day thread. I miss it.   Other than that, I think the other changes (sidebar and wiki, Sunday swap, owner post guidelines) went pretty well, though to be honest, I haven't noticed much difference either way. I really don't care about the indie angels program.   I still feel like there's a weird mentality towards blogs on here and the only reason it continues to bug me is because to me, it feels like there's an unwritten rule about it that I took way too long to fully understand. I'm still not sure how or if that's something that can be addressed but I wish there was some kind of support for blogs on here. Also could just me overthinking things but figured I'd throw it out there.   Oh and have we discussed at all whether or not brand owners should be allowed to be mods? I don't remember there ever being an official announcement or anything and I would just like to say that I feel VERY strongly about having a firm rule against brand owners as mods. (Thinking back, I'm realizing that we basically got a new mod team before any real discussion could probably take place but hey, no better time to bring it up than now.)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,daisyismydog,6,Sat Jul 11 22:09:42 2015 UTC,"The overwhelming response to the brand owners as mods discussions was that it was a strong no go. /u/daisyismydog also pointed out that it is against reddit's terms to have a mod with a conflict of interest like that so we will not have brand owners join the mod team. We've noticed the strange attitude towards blogs as well, I'm not really sure exactly what the issue is or how we can fix it, so any insight from anyone would be great. As far as scent of the day, feedback is almost totally in favour or changing it back, and it hasn't gone unheard."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Ansitru,4,Sat Jul 11 18:05:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, thanks for the clarification! As far as the blog thing goes, I remember hearing that there was some reluctance to have an indie blog section in the sidebar due to up-keep so maybe a quarterly post about blogs? Not just which blogs are out there but favorite tutorials or looks you've tried to replicate? Something that doesn't just promote the blogs but helps start a discussion about their content."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,worldwidethrowaway,7,Sat Jul 11 18:12:53 2015 UTC,I think that's a pretty good suggestion! I'll chat with the other mods about some of those ideas being put into the discussion calendar.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,5,Sat Jul 11 18:54:02 2015 UTC,"Just to add on to what /u/zebratwat has said, while initially we didn't want to have external links in the wiki, we did get a lot of feedback re blog links and we do actually have a link to /u/clever-nom-de-guerre's blogger roll call post in the wiki which is found here. I do really like the suggestion about a post with having favourite tutorials or looks you've tried to replicate!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Ansitru,3,Sat Jul 11 19:09:07 2015 UTC,"I like that idea.  I've found some good blogs on here, and the content and tutorials are often invaluable. The amount of effort and care put into a quality post is astounding to me.  I've got a few blogs, although neither of them are makeup rated, and they do take up a lot of time and brain space.   I think the weird vibe around here is the mod/ blogger overlap.  That's where things can get a little muddy to some people.  There have been questions raised about mods wielding power to promote/ favor their monetized blogs (though I believe the one in question wasn't directly linked in the wiki, had been there a while, and hasn't earned much money).  Then there's the question of whether it's okay for a mod blogger to get free product because they are visible and influential in the community."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,26,Sun Jul 12 02:03:47 2015 UTC,"Sidebar - I'm glad to see a more streamlined sidebar! Thanks for working on it. I do think that the ""FAQ"" section might be better placed under ""New to the Sub/Indies?"" rather than ""Subreddit Rules"" though. Wiki - The wiki is off to a great start too! I haven't read all of it but I took a quick look at some of the new content (although I know some pages have been rewritten too). The guide to cosmetic (gram) jars is a bit unclear in one area: "" If each mineral product was distributed based on the product's weight, there will be discrepancies in the amount of product one receives."" The ""amount of product"" can be measured by either volume or weight so it would be best to specify which. I would also add that some retailers use the same jar for both minis/full sizes but the fill level is different. Comment score hiding - I personally haven't noticed any positive change from the comment score hiding and would still like it removed. If anything, it seems like people can be heavily downvoted while the score is hidden but the numbers go back into the positives once the appropriate hours has elapsed. New discussion calendar - The ability to adjust the time zones is great. ""How indie are you today?"" - I personally think the name is somewhat strange (something like ""Daily products"" seems less campy to me) but I like the idea of a forum to share what products you're using daily. I've seen bath & body products, clothing, etc. and I think it better reflects the diversity of indie products that people are using. Indie Angels - I am not convinced it did anything in the first place so I am fine with the removal. I do think there should be another program in place (with a different, more obvious name) that recognizes consistent contributors of quality content. Sunday Swap - One of the reasons I chose a specific date (1st) when posting the proto-swap posts is because some people voiced concerns that specific days (Sat, Sun, etc.) consistently didn't work for them due to other responsibilities. IMO, unless there's some variability there will likely always be some discontent over which day is selected.  General feedback - I think Meta posts should be done more frequently (monthly) to allow for better subscriber/moderation team communication."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,eraser_dust,5,Sat Jul 11 20:35:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback! You made a great point about the sidebar and the cosmetic jar wiki guide. We'll have them revised. With the hidden karma, it's definitely up for discussion and hopefully more people will chime in with their thoughts on it.    We have discussed if we should even have another program in place of the Angels program, but the biggest concern is whether it will remain relevant months after implementation. Do you have any suggestions on how we would go about it if we implement a new program?    Regarding Sunday Swap, it was set up for the weekends since that's when most people are available. If the swap thread falls on a weekday, that would be a bit rough for the working demographic in the sub. Aside from the working demographic, there are also the students. While it may be summer break for many students right now, once classes are in session, they're usually during the weekdays, which means less time available for swaps.    The mod team will continue to communicate with the sub on a constant basis regarding any topics we have up for discussion as well as any changes we will be making. Everyone's input and suggestions are always welcomed. Please don't hesitate to send us a mod mail regarding any concerns as well!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,RhinestoneHousewife,14,Sat Jul 11 13:27:56 2015 UTC,"Sure - I think the Valued Advice Givers program on /r/femalefashionadvice has remained relevant for a while. It promotes quality content and periodically has posts rewarding newer members for their contributions (which not only rewards contributors, but makes new users aware of the program and possibly inspires them). Users have compiled numerous guides and inspiration albums. Given the decision to expand the wiki and resources available on the sidebar, I think a program that encourages such submissions would remain relevant.   Yep - I totally get why the team chose a weekend, and that's also part of the reason I originally had exchange posts on Saturday. Believe me, I gave large amounts of thought to the subject of when to post. I just wanted to point out that there's going to be discontent unless there's some rotation--there's always going to be someone who works weekends.    I know mod mail is always there, but I think having a regular forum to discuss concerns is extremely important. The ability of other subscribers to weigh in, for example, isn't something that mod mail allows. IMO the quarterly schedule isn't sufficient for a subreddit of this size which is evident by the increasing number of meta posts submitted by users."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,worldwidethrowaway,13,Sat Jul 11 14:34:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I used to work all weekend on the farm. I'd miss out on all the Sunday swap threads unless one was posted after I got off work. Even then, I was too tired and fall asleep the moment I got home.   I know I'm not the only one. Many people work retail/food service and odd jobs, so making the assumption that people have weekends off is quite a big statement to make. I realize this number of people is minor but they exist!  I agree that if there were a numerical schedule, everyone would get a chance at getting to the swap thread. I don't know, just my two cents. Then again, Sunday swap does has a great ring to it and is memorable, so everyone who wants to destash automatically knows when they can do it. In that sense, a numerical schedule could be hard to pull off because a fraction of people will be available and it'd be hard to remember which days the thread is going to occur. It'd have to be a memorable pattern, like multiples of 5, or a Fibonacci sequence.   Oops I rambled. Uh, tl;dr not everyone is available on weekends so that's something to be considered.   Edited for overall flow"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Flewtea,7,Sat Jul 11 14:55:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with the fact that weekends are also hard for those who work or have family events that one shouldn't reddit during.  Maybe twice a month on like the 1st and the 15th?   Everyone should be able to remember easy dates and even you post before work, everyone should have the patience to wait till after work for a response"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,worldwidethrowaway,7,Sat Jul 11 14:48:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Or even more regularly occurring ones so even more people get a chance? (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30?) If that's the case, posts should stay inside the megathread without exception."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,2,Sat Jul 11 15:11:33 2015 UTC,I really like this idea as it would also coincide with paydays for a lot of people.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,worldwidethrowaway,7,Sat Jul 11 15:18:42 2015 UTC,Apologies on my part with the statement regarding the working demographic! I have worked in the food service industry before and understand that are people who work on the weekends as well. The statement was made based on traditional work hours (9-5) and school schedule.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Ansitru,8,Sun Jul 12 13:21:05 2015 UTC,I understand! Just trying to point out that a 9-5 is quite a privilege these days.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,25,Sat Jul 11 15:17:47 2015 UTC,"Just poking my head in but I really liked having scores hidden. I used to get downvoted into the negatives a lot for completely innocent comments and that pretty much disappeared once scores were hidden. I do like that they decreased it from 12 hours to 3, the former was a bit excessive."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Ansitru,12,Sat Jul 11 15:19:41 2015 UTC,"Speaking of excessive, it was actually twice that (24 hours) previously :P I didn't realize some users had been experiencing positive benefits from comment score hiding, and it still might be something worth keeping around in that case!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,16,Sat Jul 11 13:59:19 2015 UTC,"I tend to notice the opposite. My comments tend to be downvoted while the scores are still hidden, only to be upvoted once the scores are public.   It's worth keeping if it affects people positively, though!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Ansitru,10,Sat Jul 11 14:05:20 2015 UTC,I also notice the opposite :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,worldwidethrowaway,5,Sat Jul 11 15:15:29 2015 UTC,"I've seen the same thing... Someone sneak down voting people while the votes are hidden, then after the three hours people in the community coming in to get scores back to the positive.  Three hours isn't that bad, though, definitely better than the ridiculous 24 hours.   Is the theory that people have a herd mentality, so if we keep scores hidden that will somehow discourage people from ""jumping on the bandwagon?""  Was that really a terrible problem?  These are serious questions because before these new rules came into place never really noticed a lot of heavily downvoted comments like you see often in more controversial subs."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,6,Sat Jul 11 16:25:29 2015 UTC,"I have noticed downvoting on my own comments before the score-hiding too, even if I didn't post anything controversial (in my opinion). One that springs to mind, for instance, is when I mentioned paypal's policy on using ""Friends&Family"" for payment (you can get fined for that) when someone wanted to compile a good manners-guide when swapping /destashing.   I felt like that was pretty important info, yet got quite some downvotes for it for some reason. Luckily they were evened out a bit, but still."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,2,Sat Jul 11 18:48:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's odd sometimes. I've noticed downvotes on really bland comments I've made, even one asking a swapper if CA was Canada or California."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Ansitru,2,Sat Jul 11 19:44:03 2015 UTC,I noticed this too...that's why I had tons of 0s when the scores were hidden for 12h.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Ansitru,11,Sat Jul 11 20:08:29 2015 UTC,It seems to happen to a lot of brand owners.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,TheAnglican,9,Mon Jul 13 01:09:57 2015 UTC,Can I agree completely with all of this?   I really agree about the comment hiding and indie angels. I would love to see an 'angels' program that takes into account users helpfulness though. Similar to ffa's valued advice givers.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,seashells_15,6,Sat Jul 11 14:22:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, maybe just some flair noting their knowledge and perhaps expertise so perfume hoarders don't get messaged with questions about Fyrrinae."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,frumperbell,11,Sat Jul 11 20:29:17 2015 UTC,"All right, my two pence on the ""How Indie are You"" versus ""Scent of the Day"" are as follows:  I lurk a lot more than I post, but I did occasionally post in the SOTD threads but have mostly stopped since the thread shift. I wear barely any makeup ever, so if that's what the thread focuses on, it's not particularly relevant to me. I do use a lot of other kinds of bath and body goodies, but not every kind of thing every day like I do perfume. If I see ""Scent of the Day"" as the thread title, I'm much more likely to take the time to post. And I like the idea of telling a bit about why you chose a particular scent for that day.  I'm not up in arms about this or anything - just pointing out that my contributions would likely be more consistent if the auto-generated format reverted back to SOTD."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,PhyrraNyx,2,Sat Jul 11 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input! We will be revisiting the daily thread based on all the feedback. At the same time, we're thinking we can implement weekly threads addressing different product categories on different days of the week. That way, there can be a thread on makeup, one on perfumes, one on bath & body products, etc. Instead of a SOTD, there can be a Scent of the Week of sorts. This might provide a nice medium instead of having a daily post on just perfumes."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,zebratwat,20,Sat Jul 11 20:44:04 2015 UTC,"Hey mods!    My main thoughts are on the How Indie Are You post. I've been feeling uncomfortable with the change from the Scent of the Day posts. I really enjoyed them when the original user started posting them, and /u/zebratwat's observations that everyone who used to participate is no longer doing so are troubling. I would be really happy if we reverted back to the Scent of the Day daily post, with credit given in the post prompt to the original user who started them. I think that, given the fairly low participation in the How Indie Are You posts, it's possible we don't need a daily WAYW-type discussion for makeup at this time. My personal feeling is the Scent of the Day posts sprung up organically and saw a ton of participation because they were fulfilling a specific need.   I suspect another issue is that the How Indie Are You prompt might actually be too broad; I think for things like this we might see more participation with a narrower discussion topic. If you want to keep it as an all-encompassing post, it might be better to have specific questions in the prompt (""What indie makeup are you wearing? What indie perfume are you wearing? What indie bath and body products have you used today?"") and indicate users can answer as many or as few as they like.  I think adding text to the comment box was a great idea, but I don't think it's totally working on mobile because the text pretty clearly extends below the lower bounds of the box. I'll send you guys a screenshot of how it looks for me rather than getting into the nitty gritty here! I'm excited to see the changes to the role of the mods and I'm looking forward to seeing how that affects the feel of the community :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,PhyrraNyx,17,Sat Jul 11 21:22:44 2015 UTC,I agree with not needing a daily WAYW thread. If they pop up organically then that's one thing but it has seemed a bit forced lately with it being scheduled the way it has been.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,elephantabate,4,Sat Jul 11 14:50:54 2015 UTC,"I agree that we have seen a decrease in participation due to the change so the daily thread is definitely up for discussion. We can maybe do a recurring thread schedule where each day of the week is dedicated to a different product category?    With the comment box text, I'll have to fix that. The image repeats itself, so it gives the illusion of having more text than it really does. Thanks for pointing that out!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,karasunflower,12,Sat Jul 11 15:04:07 2015 UTC,"Or maybe specific topics to get our creative juices flowing? Ie: favorite orange eyeshadows, best soap bars for x skin type, hg contour powders."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,toxidlotus,2,Sat Jul 11 15:31:44 2015 UTC,"I like this idea - favorite X eyeshaows, etc."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,oochin,2,Sat Jul 11 17:23:57 2015 UTC,This is a great suggestion and definitely something we'll consider!
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,8,Sat Jul 11 20:03:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the consideration and response! I do feel scents are a unique case and warrant their own daily thread, but you've gotten a bunch of feedback on this so I won't belabor the point ;) I also like the idea of a different product category each day of the week!  One more thought - I've been reviewing the wiki and it looks great! My only suggestion would be to add photos to the jar size section (which was a fantastic addition btw) for folks who do better with visuals :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Bloop_Monster,4,Sun Jul 12 02:32:12 2015 UTC,Funny thing is that I've been thinking the same thing re images in the wiki! I'm planning an order with TKB sometime this month so hopefully I can get photos up there soon. :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Boobtape,5,Sat Jul 11 16:53:58 2015 UTC,That sounds perfect! I was trying to think of a way to show jars without favoring any particular company and I think you've got the perfect solution there :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,mjolnir_mooncup,11,Sat Jul 11 17:00:21 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have commented about missing the old SOTD thread when it was replaced by the HIAY thread, but I actually really miss the old Friday FOTD thread. I liked that it was a ""look you've done this week"" thing, rather than a ""what are you wearing today"" thread. I take pictures of my make up on a near-daily basis, but I usually write them up and edit them later. I almost never share them on IMAM, because I honestly don't feel particularly comfortable posting FOTDs here unless there's a specific reason to share them. I don't feel like the more random FOTDs (as opposed to something like a holiday look or a response to a dare or a challenge) are that welcome. I liked that the Friday FOTD thread gave me a little sheltered space to go through my blog posts from the week and pick out my favorite look to share with the people inside the thread who were actually interested in it, since FOTDs outside of that thread are always downvoted.  In general, I feel like the new mod team is implementing changes that are going in the right direction, but I still think there's a disconnect between mods and uses in this sub. Several times throughout this thread people have mentioned that they feel like a specific concern is being dismissed by the mods. Usually the mods have jumped in to say ""we're not dismissing your concern,"" but without actually showing how the concern is being addressed. Sometimes it seems to me like you guys (the mods) expect us to just trust that our concerns are being addressed behind the scenes, without enough transparency to know that that's actually happening. I personally feel like having more meta threads like this would help it feel like we have input. Maybe every month is too often, but what about every other month instead of quarterly? Recently the tone in the sub feels like it's shifting in a more positive direction, and I think part of that is that we've had more meta posts than usual lately, which allow concerns to be brought up regularly, rather than simmering under the surface until they turn into resentment. People care a lot about this sub, and it means that things can get emotional. Having a more frequent outlet for sub feedback seems like it would be good to me."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,smushmallow,4,Sat Jul 11 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input wakenda. Based on the all the feedback we've received, we will be revisiting the daily thread and will be looking to implement more recurring threads that are more product specific. In this case, a version of Friday FOTD can be one of the thread topics. However, there has been a decline in the participation in Friday FOTD which was one of the reasons why it was combined with SOTD. Do you have any suggestions as to how it can be revamped to encourage more participation and quality posts?    Regarding the concerns that have been brought up in Town Hall, especially with one of our mod's status, we will be addressing that in the follow-up meta post which will list the feedback we have received here, our thoughts on them, and the solutions we have come up with. These are things that the mod team as a whole need to discuss and we don't want to make any ""empty promises."" The mods each have differing views on certain topics and we work as a team, on equal footing, where we throw ideas and thoughts around before coming to any decision.    Monthly meta threads are a good idea right now when there are so many changes to be made. However, once things start settling down, it might be a bit too much IMO. A bi-monthly meta post, as you've mentioned might be a better solution in the long run.    What I'm going to say next is my own personal thoughts and does not necessarily reflect the other mods' views... In general, there will always be a disconnect between the mods and the sub, primarily due to all the different views and opinions. One example is the owners vs consumers mindset that has been going on in the sub. There have been concerns raised that the sub is not geared towards consumers and that the mod team favors the owners. But there have also been concerns raised that the sub and the mod team are not owner-friendly and that there have been too many restrictions on brand owners (as you can see in this Town Hall discussion). As mods, it's our role to take into account every input and concern and try to come up with a middle ground between all the conflicting views. This also takes into account what the mods have seen in the subreddit and the reports received. Because of that, while we can only try to decrease the disconnect, it will never truly disappear. Please note that we plan to be as transparent as possible regarding the changes we'll be implementing and I hope this will show in the meta threads. There are a lot of factors to consider and in the mean time, I do thank everyone for their continued patience and support you have shown us."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,mjolnir_mooncup,4,Sun Jul 12 14:48:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how to encourage participation in a FOTD thread. I know that I try to look at and comment on most if not all of what gets posted to do my part to encourage participation. Personally, I don't mind it if it's a smaller group, if those are the people who are really interested in participating. In general I wish people responded in more depth to FOTDs, but I don't know how to encourage others to do it, beyond just commenting myself.   I'm really glad to hear you're planning a follow up to the town hall. Hopefully that can avoid the problems of people not feeling heard that came up after the survey. I'm glad to hear you'd consider a bi-monthly meta thread instead of quarterly as a compromise once things settle down a bit.  I think balance in this sub is so tricky. Just curious, why do think the mod/user disconnect is always going to be there? Does people having differing views make it hard to tell which are most prevalent? If so, it seems to me like that might be a point in favor of more frequent town halls."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,toxidlotus,4,Sun Jul 12 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"Apologies for the late response. I was at a family event most of the day.    With the FOTDs, I think there's also that fear of showing one's face to the public, even though it's online. So in a way, it's connected to how comfortable people are. That then brings to question how we can make the sub more... ""friendly"" or welcoming... I'm kinda rambling now since I'm still not sure how we can go about this. But I do love seeing FOTDs! I wish there are more and can only encourage people by commenting on their posts.    Regarding the disconnect, as I've mentioned, this is primarily due to all the different views and opinions in the sub. We also have different parties with different interests (consumer, owner, blogger, etc). In a perfect world, we can discuss an issue and come to a decision that will appease all parties. Unfortunately, that's not always the case.    Let's take the consumer & owner situation again for example. These are two parties that are part of our community - both subscribers and participants in many of our sub's discussions. However, both have very different reactions to the mod team's actions. Whenever claims are made, independent of which party is making the claim, the mod team requires proof of evidence to be provided with the claim. If one makes a claim, they need to back it up. If a claim is made without any proof of evidence, we will remove the post/comment until proof is provided.    Now, when we pull claims without any proof made against brand owners, we receive backlash for ""favoring"" brand owners and not giving consumers a voice. When we pull claims without proof made against consumers, we receive backlash for being ""anti-brand owner."" Now, if proof is provided with the claim, we'll leave the post alone, but then we receive backlash from the party the claim is made against for allowing such a post to stay. With every action the mod team takes, there will always be someone who does not agree with it and the topic of the disconnection between the mods and the sub will be brought up. Now this is just an example regarding the views of two parties. We're also not throwing in bloggers to the mix.    Frequent town halls can be a solution to get all these different views together and talk it out rather than letting it simmer under the surface. It will be something to bring up with the rest of the mod team and see what they think of it as well."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,blueskiesandsun,4,Sun Jul 12 18:32:58 2015 UTC,"I totally agree about the FOTDs. There was a post about it over on imamdiscussion a while back, about how FOTD posts are pretty much always downvoted more than other types of posts. That's why I think having the protected space for people to share them without starting their own thread makes sense. For me, it's not an issue of sharing my face, which I do all the time. It's more of a fear of posting too much and getting backlash for being a blogger. And FOTDs are the easiest types of posts for me to not share because they get the most downvotes.  I see what you mean about the backlash and accusations of bias you guys get for posts with claims in them. However, I'm a bit curious about what you mean by claims against consumers. I'm not sure if it's true that I've never seen one, but I can't bring one to mind. Can you give me an example of when something like this has come up in the sub?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,randomactsofbadness,4,Mon Jul 13 00:44:29 2015 UTC,"I think one thing that would help with participation is to change the day the FOTD thread takes place. I was the one who suggested FOTD Fridays (because who doesn't love alliteration), but it often was eclipsed by Friday Free Talk. Just with the nature of rotating the post time, most Fridays I never even saw the FOTD post because it was up for eight hours while I slept and FFT was the stickied post once I was awake.  It might also be cool to tie in a challenge aspect to the FOTD thread each week. For example, to try a bold or unusual lip color, to randomly select two eyeshadow colors, or to try a new technique, etc."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,mjolnir_mooncup,21,Mon Jul 13 06:00:59 2015 UTC,"I do like the idea of 1 day a week for swapping / selling off items in your stash (whether it's saturday or sunday doesn't matter to me). However, I would love to see people sharing when companies are having sales, like a flash sale, anniversary sale, etc, whenever that's going on so we don't miss out."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,mjolnir_mooncup,13,Mon Jul 13 06:35:18 2015 UTC,"I really miss postings about sales (including those by brand owners), but I know some folks didn't like it so most people stopped posting them. I understand the concerns about consumerism and I don't want this sub to come off as buy! buy! buy!, so I'm not sure what the solution is.  As someone who doesn't use Facebook much at all, I really appreciate sale info."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,3,Sat Jul 11 19:29:20 2015 UTC,I appreciate it too. It seems like the answer for everything is a scheduled thread but perhaps a weekly Sales from X-X Dates thread that can be updated throughout the week? You could check it if you are looking it buy or ignore otherwise. Or flair for them like we have with destashes?
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,mjolnir_mooncup,5,Sat Jul 11 19:52:02 2015 UTC,"Facebook kind of sucks anyways. It doesn't show me updates from the pages that I'm following all the time, so I sometimes miss it if stuff is only posted to FB."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,3,Sun Jul 12 04:10:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I really hate how I have to go hunt down brand pages I'm interested in.  They never show up in my feed but all the dumb reposts from people I barely know pop up just fine :/
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,worldwidethrowaway,3,Sat Jul 11 20:00:01 2015 UTC,Same issue :(
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,ltdaaanicecream,3,Sun Jul 12 00:02:06 2015 UTC,"on the desktop version there is an option called ""pages feed"" which will make your news feed only show posts from pages you follow. I never miss anything now that I browse that once a day. Although I do know not everyone has time for that."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Molliver,2,Sun Jul 12 00:22:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll have to investigate. I always do the sort by 'most recent' rather than 'top posts' but I have to do that every day. so annoying.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,emmian,2,Sun Jul 12 01:26:18 2015 UTC,"I made a ""list"" on FB that shows me all updates from pages I added to it so that I would have a workaround to hunting crap down every time FB decides to hide stuff I want to see. Needing to do this is definitely one of the reasons FB is subpar for this sort of thing."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,emmian,2,Sun Jul 12 01:35:48 2015 UTC,"As long as it isn't coming from the brand owner, I love seeing sales posts. Especially considering how much makeup I own I really need the temptation of sales to get me to try a diffefent company. Also I like that in sales posts there is a link the their shop, Facebook, or something along those lines. Because truthfully I have internet ADD and tend to forget to Google shops I heard about."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,i_am_a_cyborg,10,Sun Jul 12 03:29:14 2015 UTC,I miss posts about sales too.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,frumperbell,12,Sun Jul 12 12:33:23 2015 UTC,"Sidebar/Wiki- I like the new versions of these a lot! They're certainly easier to navigate, and I learned a bit from the wiki, so I can only imagine the help it would give to a complete newbie. Hiding of comment scores- Tbh, I don't feel like this did a lot. I noticed in some threads, some comments would be heavily downvoted (for no apparent reason) but then spring back up into the positives when the score was unhidden. If we must keep it, I'd recommend the three-hour version instead of the 24-hour version because we're a slower sub, but not that slow. Self-promotion guidelines- Again, a good idea imo. I don't think there were that many owners that overdid it, but it's good to have stricter rules in place to prevent the sub from becoming the mecca of PSAs from brands. Swap guidelines- Yessss. I know that they're popular, but it was good to cut down the number of tiny swap posts that cluttered up the board.   Every other issue I'm pretty much neutral on, but generally, I think we need to have more big meta discussion posts like this. Maybe make it a monthly thing? The big issue that led to this was the perceived lack of mod/user communication, so having a regular place to voice comments/concerns would really help. Even if there's nothing that anyone has to say after a while, I think it's a good plan going forward.  I will have to say, I think most of the changes have improved this sub. I see people less afraid to post ""unpopular opinions"", but also less general drama, so I think we've reached an equilibrium...for now!  edit: formatting..."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Absinthe42,6,Sat Jul 11 22:15:07 2015 UTC,I second having discussions like this monthly.  The current schedule is far too infrequent.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,mjolnir_mooncup,4,Sat Jul 11 15:17:34 2015 UTC,"thank you so much for sharing your thoughts. I'm really glad you have liked the changes and clarifications we've put in place. We certainly want everyone to feel free to share their thoughts in an open forum like this. Monthly may be slightly too frequently, but it's something we are definitely considering."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,KalmiaKamui,10,Sat Jul 11 19:53:17 2015 UTC,"an idea I had for a possible recurring thread is something like an Indie Wishlist thread for people who are on low/no-buys (or anyone who wants to join). It would be similar to the current Whatcha Haulin thread except, well, no actual hauling involved. I always do this on my own to cope with no/low buys so I thought it might be fun."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,frumperbell,5,Sat Jul 11 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting idea, we'll definitely take that idea on board to discuss when we review the recurring threads! In the meantime, feel free to post it yourself; we always welcome user-generated discussion posts :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Calm_Sapphire,23,Sun Jul 12 06:58:24 2015 UTC,"Moderation of throwaways - whether throwaways should be banned from the sub   Bad idea imo, people already get enough hassle if they post negative things. Not being able to use throwaways would just make it worse.  Indie angels had potential to be so much more but as it is, unless you revamp it there's no point having it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,toxidlotus,46,Sun Jul 12 07:12:26 2015 UTC,"I don't usually like to get involved in this but I just want to put it in writing that I don't like the change from ""Scent of the Day"" to ""How Indie Are You"". Firstly Scent of the Day was a thread started by users and it continued to be popular that way until it was made permanent. Why try to fix something that wasn't broken? I don't understand why there cannot be a perfume specific daily thread? There are plenty of scent hobbyists here, evident by the fact that ""Scent of the Day"" came about organically. I think that smashing it together with a Face of the Day kind of thread dilutes the original purpose, a discussion area for perfume lovers. It gives me the feeling that a) scent hobbyists who aren't that into make up aren't as important as members of this sub b) perfume is in the ""and more"" category of this sub and should remain a background element. Whereas indie perfume might have started out as an ""and more"" it has become an important part of the indie experience and should be treated as such."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,cuculine,14,Sat Jul 11 16:54:43 2015 UTC,"I'm really new here and the only thread I've been around for is HIAY, but I'm only here because of indie perfumes. I was actually a little disappointed that there wasn't a specific scent of the day thread, so I'm all for this becoming a thing again! I would be interested in it including indie bath products, because they usually have scents that people like to describe, but like a lot of other commenters, I really only get excited about the makeup posts that have pictures. I also really like another commenter's idea of an ""if I like_, then I might like_"" thread. That sounds fantastic. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,3,Sat Jul 11 12:39:16 2015 UTC,"Welcome aboard! I am incredibly dedicated to indie scents and have tried over 200 at this point so if you ever have a question, I'm here for you :)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,Laurensics,7,Sun Jul 12 01:00:16 2015 UTC,I kind of agree. I'd rather have perfume and makeup separate there. It's kind of a messy mashup with it all clumped together. It's annoying to go through everything if you're just looking for one or the other.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,PhyrraNyx,6,Sun Jul 12 01:04:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your feedback! We combined the Scent of the Day thread with the Friday FOTD thread to create a medium that allows people to talk about all indie products - not just makeup or perfume - on a daily basis. Examples include indie bath products, hair oils, and even skincare.    That said, we have also been talking about implementing more recurring threads to our discussion calendar. One of the things that came up was recurring threads for specific product categories (makeup, perfume, skincare, etc). The thread structure is open for discussion since we do want to improve the post quality of recurring threads. Do you have any suggestions on what else we can discuss regarding perfumes? Maybe include a perfume support of sorts since perfumes can be a bit intimidating for some?"

I think its a fun discussion, and is really useful for those just getting into indie perfumes. It could also work for cosmetics too! Maybe 2x per month, one for color/one for scent?   Edit, sorry about weird formatting, not sure what I did!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,TooMuchElectric,5,Sat Jul 11 13:17:19 2015 UTC,I second this.  I may not always comment (which I should really start doing) but I always read those posts to find new things to try.  Whether it's perfume or makeup.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,5,Sat Jul 11 13:21:26 2015 UTC,"Haha, it's okay! But yeah, that's a user-generated post. It would be a great idea to implement that since we do get a lot of ""Find me something similar to [commercial product]"" posts. After looking over the calendar, maybe have it on Fridays?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,10,Sat Jul 11 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"Perfume support sounds nice. I would participate in that. I would rather have a ""scent of..."" day, week, something thread back but if that's not something the mods are open to I would try to be active in whatever perfume threads you decide on. Perhaps a ""Favorite _____ scent"" thread (fave incense, cake, mixed drink etc) like once a month."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,2,Sat Jul 11 13:31:53 2015 UTC,Maybe a weekly thread? We can have recurring threads for specific product categories for each day of the week. :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,14,Sat Jul 11 14:54:54 2015 UTC,"But I would just like to reiterate that SOTD was started by users, then it was made into a automatic thread. I think this is important because it shows there was (and still is, I think) a demand for a separate/specific perfume discussion thread on a regular schedule. We were participating in it regularly but now what we started has turned into something else completely. HIAY is not filling that need."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,13,Sat Jul 11 15:34:05 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why there is so much mod resistance to this, especially when it was started by users and was active (much more than the current one) and people want it back"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,kstinasunflower,9,Sat Jul 11 17:57:07 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why this even happened in the first place. What was the appeal of making a ""more broad"" of the day thread at the expense of a well loved specific one? I see the excuse that a SOTD and a FOTD would be ""too much""...but in a sub where we have lulls every once in a while, what's the problem with having a few different structured discussions going on? The funny thing is I predicted this when SOTD became popular, I thought to myself ""Uh oh people are going to start thinking the scentophiles are taking over and try to bring it back to mostly make up"", maybe this is that. I'm not sure."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,6,Sat Jul 11 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Maybe they thought a broader thread would have more participation, or make everyone feel included? The wording and removal of a well-loved thread just caused the opposite. Now it's like they can't just admit they were wrong and put it back the way it was.    I'm not even much of a perfume user, but as a newb I liked seeing different perfumes discussed.  Plus, we have plenty of makeup only topics.  What's wrong with a little perfume love?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,blushfanatic,12,Sat Jul 11 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"Haha. It's interesting, because I actually love the change. I think it would be too much if we had seperate threads for them both."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,RhinestoneHousewife,37,Sat Jul 11 20:13:55 2015 UTC,"I was all for the change, but after combining them it seems everyone who was active in the scent of the day threads stopped participating. I'd rather have two lively threads than one dead one."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,20,Sat Jul 11 13:57:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this. ""Scent of the Day"" generated a lot of discussion between posters, while the new version of that thread is mostly a product list. I enjoyed participating in SotD regularly, but rarely post in the new thread because.. well its pretty dead as you said."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,RhinestoneHousewife,20,Sat Jul 11 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"I am also someone that mostly stopped posting once it switched from scents only to HIAY. I stopped because I also am not as into makeup as perfume right now and agree with Absinthe42 that lists of products without a look isn't that exciting. I loved the scent post because I liked seeing people review/describe new scents, and I realize that might still happen in HIAY but I don't care to scroll through make-up posts to find the scent-related ones."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,homicidalunicorns,3,Sat Jul 11 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough, I appreciate hearing the honesty about why it isn't working out."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,25,Sat Jul 11 16:36:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. The scent threads would usually get to 30-40 comments every day and the new threads barely make it to 10 some days. Also, the scent threads were way more likely to have people include reviews of perfumes and how it worked with their skin chemistry. With the HIAY threads I usually just list products and occasionally will include a review."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,homicidalunicorns,7,Sat Jul 11 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention, I also vary my perfume far more often than my makeup so I enjoyed it for that reason too."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,SirWaffalot,3,Sat Jul 11 14:54:12 2015 UTC,"This. I have much less variety in my makeup than I do in my perfume, so I don't really want to report the same makeup items again and again."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,RhinestoneHousewife,3,Sat Jul 11 15:01:28 2015 UTC,"I do the same thing.  I wear a different scent every day of the week (sometimes 2 or 3 since I burn through them so fast or I'm washing my hands and moisturizing a lot).  Makeup though, I go through periods where its everyday or periods where my skin hates me so I'll I use is lip balm."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,23,Sat Jul 11 15:56:26 2015 UTC,"I am one who has basically stoped, and a lot of it is because, if I can be completely frank without someone getting offended, I just don't care bout what makeup people are wearing today if I can't see how it turned out. I don't want that to seem mean, I just get frustrated when something sounds really pretty but have no way of knowing what it actually turned out to be."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,wakenda,10,Sat Jul 11 17:53:40 2015 UTC,"I am definitely less active in the new HIAY thread because I see far more FOTD type responses and I just don't feel like the group of posters who used to make SOTD such a great thread are there anymore. There's less participation overall. It feels a little like yelling into the void now when I do post, whereas before it was a true discussion thread about specifically perfume."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,PhyrraNyx,8,Sat Jul 11 16:20:12 2015 UTC,"I stopped participating when the change was made.  To be blunt, I don't give a shit about FOTD type threads.  The scent of the day posts were often full of discussion and mini-reviews.  I would always post a few words about whatever perfume I was wearing."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,worldwidethrowaway,13,Sat Jul 11 17:50:09 2015 UTC,"I've been in and out all day and commenting on other threads.  I just wanted to add two more things:  1) I'm glad that this thread has stayed so positive.  I feel like on the whole there's been a marked decrease in drama and that when it does pop up, its handled very well.  2) I personally think the new brand owner posting requirements are unnecessarily restrictive.  I do think some kind of guidelines are necessary as there are some brand reps that use this sub just for self promotion.  Thing is, its really obvious, to me at least, which owners actually care about being a part of the community, and which owners show up once in a blue moon only to pimp sales."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,beautifulmess7,3,Sun Jul 12 02:35:41 2015 UTC,I'm glad you feel like there's been less drama!  And thank you for the feedback about the brand owner requirements. It's something we're definitely going to discuss as a team because there's been alot of great points raised in this thread for us to consider!
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,glitterwrists,6,Sun Jul 12 01:50:36 2015 UTC,"Regarding having a sales post and other things - with the craziness reddit has gone through in the last week (firing of mods, CEO stepping down, etc) they did change the rules and there can be now two stickied posts at the top of a subreddit. So instead of some threads getting buried before everyone can see them maybe they can be stickied?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,worldwidethrowaway,5,Sun Jul 12 03:50:57 2015 UTC,"Reddit has definitely been crazy lately, but that's awesome to know about the two sticky posts!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,sea-weed,13,Sun Jul 12 17:15:52 2015 UTC,"So far I agree with the majority of people here. I like the new sidebar. I think the ""How  Indie are You Today"" really should go back to scent of the day. I think people are pretty comfy posting FoTD posts, but you could also just add a ""Makeup of the Day"" or something if people really want that.  Also about the post flair. I would love to see the implemented so we could have links in the sidebar to filter posts."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,obliquepeach,7,Sun Jul 12 17:37:39 2015 UTC,"The feedback has been mostly consistent regarding the HIAY v Scent of the Day, so it's definitely helpful for us. The only concern that has been posted regarding having a SoTD and a MoTD post would make it seem very cluttered; but as it has been said, we really welcome all feedback and suggestions.   Thanks for your comment!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,glitterwrists,19,Sat Jul 11 22:18:16 2015 UTC,"I like the weekly swap/sale threads, or at least more frequently than monthly.  I do think we could switch off days, perhaps on a biweekly basis, so that folks can have a chance to post/search on other days.  Sunday in the US is no longer ""weekend"" for a lot of IMAMers, after all. YES TO CHALLENGES.  Downside: I think these challenges would have to be planned ahead of time so people can participate.  But I think this might invigorate the sub a little - people seem to love challenges since it gives them a goal. Regarding the split between Indies Of the Day and SotD: I understand the ire that a user-created idea was broadened like that, but I also agree there's a growing rift between Perfume IMAM and Makeup IMAM, and that makes me sad.  Perhaps there could be a SotD post as well as INDIE CHALLENGEFEST 5000!!!! for the broad appeal?  I notice that, while some folks vary their FotD, it's not EVERYONE who gets to do so (I assume because work/school have guidelines about colorful makeup). Unrelated: Personally, I like the &more questions we sometimes get, regarding hair care or marshmallows or wallets or candles.  I think a lot of folks feel tapped out on makeup and perfume, and there really isn't a single place to go to discuss other handmade/small business products.  While I do think the bigger overall sub focus is on makeup/skincare/perfume, I would gladly welcome maybe a monthly thread about the &more stuff.  Like, for hauls posts, I never know whether I should talk about other indie purchases - I have in the past, but infrequently - and I wonder if other users do the same.  The random ""what other non-cosmetic indies do you like?"" posts always get fairly big, so I know we're all nerds there's some interest."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,sunzilla,10,Sat Jul 11 23:42:46 2015 UTC,"Yes! Yay for the ""and more"" threads. I'm excited about seeing them become part of the rotating schedule."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,tightslacks,6,Sat Jul 11 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"We are thinking of setting up more recurring threads so one that has come up are weekly threads that address different product categories on each day of the week. That means there can be a thread on makeup, a thread on perfumes, a thread on baked goods/candy (my personal fav), a thread on jewelry, etc. Hopefully that can serve as a medium for everyone.    With the weekly sales thread, we haven't even thought of having it rotate between days, so that can be an option. People will have to keep track of the schedule though, so that might pose a problem for some. It's definitely up for discussion though.    And indie challenges are fun! We hope to have a post up about it soon! :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,rrrrrrrrrryyyyy,3,Sat Jul 11 22:14:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed with the ""And more"" I love Jewelry, homewares, candles and lots of other indie stuff, and I love hearing about it from others."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,adoorbleazn,14,Sat Jul 11 20:24:56 2015 UTC,"Indie Angels: I would love to see this revamped into something else. I feel like it had so much potential but will definitely need to be enforced better if it comes to fruition once again. Flair tags: This is a no-brainer. Do it! The sub will be better organized aaaand more colorful. Throwaways: There's really no way to avoid throwaways but I like the idea of an account age limit for participation, even if it's as short as a week (or less). It'd give new users a chance to become acclimated with the sub via lurking during that time, plus eliminate any newly-made throwaway accounts. Of course, this wouldn't stop anyone from pulling out their trusty alt account but again, there's no all-encompassing solution to this problem. Many users have suggested better moderation and deletion of harassing comments - here's where I think Indie Angels can come into play and help to alert mods of anything suspicious, or perhaps swoop in and let the offending user know that they should rephrase their comment. Just a thought. Sunday Swap: I have no opinions on this, other than what I've stated before. Scheduling conflicts will always be an issue. Why not endorse /r/IMAMsales? I've never used it because it's not widely used. We could keep swaps/destashes off this sub and move them over there, essentially. Swap threads are very often downvoted so heavily that I feel that many people find them annoying and cluttering anyway. Owner guidelines: I wanted to make a note about this as well, being that I'm a brand owner and all. I'm 100% on board with having posting rules, but I feel like they're a little too strict. I participate a lot on IMAM now because sales are slow and I have a lot of time on my hands. However, when sales pick up and I'm stuck under a pile of invoices and lipstick and shipping envelopes, I barely have the time to comment much (though I do make it a point to participate when I have free time!) You have to give some to receive some, but a little more leniency would be nice. It would be easier if it was 4-5 posts instead of 7 or do a trade off: if owners have posted 1-2 discussion threads in the last month. What does the community think?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,adoorbleazn,9,Sun Jul 12 07:05:31 2015 UTC,"I have posted to /r/IMAMsales.  It's a good sub, but I don't think it's a complete substitute for the weekly swap here.  There are a few reasons I say that:    Verification pictures are required for everything. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it is time consuming.   It requires making a name tag, snapping pictures in decent light, picking the best shots, creating an Imgur album, and, if you're feeling fancy, formatting your post so the picture is linked next to each item.  Again, it's great for buyers but cumbersome if you're feeling lazy about doing all of that.  It can feel like too much trouble to post if you're only looking to get rid of a few things.  There's not as much consistent traffic, and you can't really plan to have as many eyes on your post on a set day (with Sunday swaps I can  have everything wrapped up and ready to go Monday morning instead of spread throughout the week or whenever random people wander into /r/IMAMsales).  Although requests can be made in /r/IMAMsales, it is less intimidating to make them in the Sunday Swap thread, and again... more eyes on one set day.    TL;DR Sunday Swap is easier, more casual, and great for quick swaps and requests  As for the brand owner guidelines, I can see what you mean.   I hadn't thought about the 7 comment participation requirement in depth.  I don't know how my times I comment in a given week. Having to count up 7, especially a busy time, could certainly seem like too much or like homework or a penalty.    Maybe lowering it to 4-5 comments or having discussion posts unrelated to the brand/store count for more could help with that.  Without some sort of an empirical standard for participation, like X number of comments/posts, I don't know how we could differentiate owners who are part of the community and those who primarily use it as unpaid advertisement, though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,SPACECATSTHEMEWSICAL,4,Sat Jul 11 19:44:18 2015 UTC,"Eep. I didn't know they had that many rules. That's definitely a huge roadblock for someone lazy like me who wants to unload a few things quickly and move on.  Regarding 3 and 4, I figured having IMAMsales affiliated officially with IMAM would fix the ""not as many eyes"" problem. If people had no other choice but to shift over to the other sub, many more eyes would take a looksee!  I'm also taking under the assumption that IMAM mods would have a hand in IMAMsales if they decide to endorse it. That's something, of course, that both parties would have to agree on.  Again, a total offhand comment! I LOVE having Sunday Swaps here on IMAM but it seems to be a much more hassle than it's worth, so I thought I'd offer a solution that could might maybe work.  Re: Owner guidelines, I'm glad I brought it up! 7 comments in 2 weeks doesn't seem like much, but I don't really want to count every comment I make before I post a self-promo. I participate a lot here regardless so it won't matter much to me, and I don't think it's fair for brand owners to promote without contributing, but I believe the guidelines could be looked over again."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,worldwidethrowaway,5,Sat Jul 11 21:06:17 2015 UTC,"They didn't have that many rules at first, but as the sub grew they added them. The verification requirement was added not too long ago.   That's a good point.   If there was a link posted from here to there as a reminder on an automated schedule it could drive more eyes there on a regular basis.   You bring up a good point about intertwining the subs, though.  I wonder if mods here would want or could handle also moderating there. If not, as a mod I might feel uncomfortable promoting another subreddit that I don't have a hand in and telling the community it's the best bet.   I also love Sunday swap for the lazy factor.  Browsing one big thread is faster, I can de-stash a few things, or make a casual request.    I do think limiting posts outside of the thread is a good step because they can be annoying. The new guidelines are great, but maybe we could take them one step further. Maybe if a big list has already been posted on /r/IMAMsales it shouldn't be allowed to be cross-posted as a new thread here, too. Rather, the poster should link to their IMAMsales post.   Or the same requirement (I think it's more than 30 items?) for having your own post here could be changed to having to be posted to /r/IMAMsales and linked in the main Sunday swap thread At that point, your list is so long you pretty much can't be lazy anyway.   I'm only one voice in any case, but that's my 2 cents.   I agree with you on the owner thing. I Iike seeing owner's participate, and I don't want anyone to feel penalized for being an owner or like they can't promote here u less they have unlimited time. It is a balancing act to find the right compromise."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,imamelf,5,Sat Jul 11 21:59:36 2015 UTC,You basically hit the nail on the head with our feelings on imamsales. It was never discussed with us upon creation and we have had zero input in what goes on over there. We do not want to be held responsible if things go wrong somewhere we can't control.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,glitterwrists,10,Sun Jul 12 18:06:38 2015 UTC,"/raises hand again  Why not an IMAM-run sales sub? I brought up affiliating IMAMsales despite the fact that I'm not even 100% comfortable using it (but thought it could be a quick solution regardless, devil's advocate and all). It seems like everyone is on the same level of discomfort about IMAMsales, but I've spoken to a few people on the side who are into the idea of having a separate sub for indie makeup sales regardless! Would the IMAM mods consider running a separate sub?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cwm2n,rrrrrrrrrryyyyy,10,Sat Jul 11 22:02:53 2015 UTC,"Just on a personal level as a user, I also find the Sunday Sales to be such a large and fun part of our sub that I'm not sure outsourcing to another sub is a good idea.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,chocolatebundtcake,29,Sat Jul 11 02:14:07 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see more people go crazy with their everyday makeup. It would be amazing to walk down the street and see lipsticks that are bright, bold, dark, or duochrome. Or eyeshadow that's an almost editorial-level of uniqueness. Maybe this is more common to see in cities and fashion minded places. I understand most people have to have SFW makeup for various reasons, but I hardly ever see it even on campus where students basically have the freedom to do anything and everything to express themselves. Even in the art department there's maybe a couple of girls besides me that wear a bold lip to class.   I was hoping the Hunger Games craze would help this along. The Capital's makeup and fashion was fantastic and completely out there. But I guess we're not ready for this :("
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,why_42,8,Sat Jul 11 03:19:10 2015 UTC,"I agree so much! Where I live just wearing lipstick is considered bold and out there. Even at the makeup counter I worked for, a red lip was getting real crazy. I just want to wear metallic gold lipstick, is that too much to ask?!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,surewhynot123,10,Sat Jul 11 04:20:54 2015 UTC,"I love walking into Sephora and seeing the MUAs wearing OCC RX or some other blue lipstick. It's sad to think of red as crazy, because red is a staple, classic shade. You should definitely wear gold :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,PhyrraNyx,4,Sat Jul 11 05:04:13 2015 UTC,"You should definitely wear the gold! The more we wear our unusual stuff the more people will start to think it's kinda normal. Gold can be so subtle and classy, instead of being alarmed people will probably think about how stunning it is."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,why_42,3,Sat Jul 11 06:30:56 2015 UTC,"Gold lipstick sounds amazing! Makeup is pretty rare where I live too, so if I even wear a 'normal' colour to go to the store, everyone stares."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,skelezombie,7,Sat Jul 11 11:49:56 2015 UTC,"Thirded. I wore Fyrinnae Ominous - which basically looks like a desaturated purple on me - and got so many weird looks that it put me off of wearing it again. Hell, I get weird looks wearing Women's Weapons - which is a pretty normal colour honestly.   But then again, I'm in a country whose women's magazines are blown away by the concepts of contouring, primers and brow gels, and still think it's a good idea to put lip balm under your lipstick. So I probably shouldn't be surprised. (God, they're going to have an aneurysm when they discover purple blush and duochromes...all the magazines here are one to three years late on literally every trend.)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,dartigen,5,Sat Jul 11 06:33:01 2015 UTC,"I've actually found that some lipsticks (I'm looking at you, Too Faced Melted) work better with a little balm underneath, especially on lips like mine that are constantly shedding like snakes. But I totally agree on magazines being super behind the times. I always get excited to look at the makeup sections if I'm in a waiting room and there's magazines on hand but I always realize I already know this stuff..."

My professors actually ask me if I'm sick when I'm not wearing a black / green / blue / other bold colored lipstick. :p  ETA: and when I wore Fyrinnae's Graffiti out a week or so ago, an elderly couple complimented me because they felt that it was a great summer-color and more people should have the guts to wear it. So I'm definitely all for creative make-up!"

In all seriousness, I would like the next trend to be more lips that are natural looking - but have an ever so slight shimmer of something unusual. That way you can get away with at work, but it's still something fun and amazing."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,NorthwestTreeOctopus,3,Sat Jul 11 04:11:57 2015 UTC,Oooh I love that idea! Like the tiniest shimmer of blue/violet/rainbow loveliness.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,judeismycat,26,Sat Jul 11 11:31:02 2015 UTC,"By ""duochrome"" do you mean one single-hue highlight on top of a base shade, or a highlight which changes colour? The first is fairly common, but usually has a more subtle effect, and the latter (like our Wizardry - the turquoise shimmer changes to a bright pink-red, base stays the same) is more costly to make, and in some cases requires a considerable amount of the effect colourant(s), probably making the process cost-prohibitive for some companies.  It also depends on the base product: lipgloss and other transparent suspending bases like nail polish, show all sorts of layered colour effects well. But solids  like lipstick, not so much, so production is sometimes a lot more involved. So that may be why such products aren't very widespread.  I'd like to see more bold, multi-coloured eyeliner. Like dark purple fading into reddish-black, or green and gold. Or perhaps just heavy taupe liner for people who can't go around alarming their boss/patients/students/dog/hamster."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,Dorian_Gray_,3,Sat Jul 11 03:37:31 2015 UTC,I am definitely going to try your eyeliner idea. This can be a real easy way to get some more color in my everyday!
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,Feorea,3,Sat Jul 11 06:09:37 2015 UTC,"Duo/multichrome eyeliners would be amazing, but difficult to make. At least, in liquid - most duochromes seem to lose a lot of their colour and shift when mixed with foiling mediums. It could be possible in a pencil or gel though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,dartigen,7,Sat Jul 11 06:29:12 2015 UTC,"We had a few in our Inks liners years ago. But unless you're covering a large area, the effect is lost unless looking up-close. It's the drying that ruins this with water-based liners and foiling mediums, I think. If you take a dry brush over the line after it dries, it should fix it and bring the highlight back up."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,Dorian_Gray_,3,Sat Jul 11 06:53:31 2015 UTC,The joys of having monolids...I can go with ombré liners and it still doesn't look too dramatic :P

Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,PhyrraNyx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:03:12 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more along the lines of Wizardry or Volcanic.  I'd be willing to pay more since they cost more to make, but I can see how they could also be cost-prohibitive for some shops."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,Dorian_Gray_,6,Sat Jul 11 06:41:57 2015 UTC,Would a sheer pink or peachy highlight (like a translucent eye shadow) over the blush help?
Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,misosoup122,5,Sat Jul 11 06:56:21 2015 UTC,Peach highlight over purpley mauve blush would be sooo pretty.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cvcxo,Millyish,3,Sat Jul 11 06:57:56 2015 UTC,I've found purples can be more wearable when blended into your contour!

So this ends up half super pretty scent half SOAP. BPAL London: Rooose. The description is spot-on. It's a dark but juicy rose. That's pretty much it. It doesn't last very long on my skin and for straight roses I prefer Possets Napoleon & Josephine, as it's a little lighter and has more throw. BPAL Wicked: Lovely. It's myrrh, jasmine, and rose, but none of the notes stand out too much, and overall just mesh really well together. The jasmine doesn't stink, the myrrh isn't overly incense-y, and the rose isn't smacking you in the face with its petals. Just a smooth, soft floral. BPAL Crossroads: Starts out waxy with moss and a bit of dry soil underneath, quickly morphs into a moss-heavy scent with something almost syrupy but not sweet underlying it. Hard to describe. Not my thing, but interesting."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cw7hi,Ansitru,2,Sat Jul 11 12:22:08 2015 UTC,"I've been trying my DC-perfumes one by one and today it was Carny Wedding's turn.   From the cold sniff, I got barbecue sauce. Straight up honey-bbq sauce. So that was odd. Still, I reckoned it might be a morpher like the ones I'd tried before and put it on my wrists.  Bad idea, as I mostly got butter and smoke from the way it behaved on my skin, in a not-so-good way. Does anyone have experience layering this, perhaps? Because as it is, I had to wash it off and put on Mordeboobs instead. :c"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cw7hi,Estridde,2,Sat Jul 11 15:23:00 2015 UTC,"I like wearing it with perfumes with seaweed/driftwood notes, like DC Mishigami or Scent by the Sea Winter Beach. That being said, I didn't get any barbecue out of mine and the butter note smells almost like a creamy, lightly smokey butterscotch so I don't know if that would work for you."

Femme Fatale Crystal Guardian went on the inner half of my lids, with Shiro Cake on the inner corners. Liner was Shiro Women's Weapons with Darling Girl Superstar Serum. It was a new combination of colors for me, and I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone.   I'm looking forward to seeing the reformulated version of Crystal Guardian!

Indiemakeupandmore,3cuxzl,chupacabratwist,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:12:45 2015 UTC,I have it in the hair oil actually and I love it at first but it turns into a kind of musty smell after a while so I haven't tried other forms for that reason but perhaps I should. HOG doesn't seem to have the best success rate with skin chemistry though :/

My Arcana shopping list is getting really long though and I fear for my wallet. Can you smell the rice wine note clearly? I'm intrigued by the prospect of smelling like a sake bar...
Indiemakeupandmore,3cuxzl,Estridde,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:50:01 2015 UTC,"to me it smells more rice-y and creamy - it's a very ""light pink"" scent if that makes any sense. It's not too citrus-y to me but I sometimes have trouble smelling citrus notes strongly. Julia typically lists the most prominent notes first, so I don't think the rice wine should be a large component."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cuxzl,Estridde,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:58:18 2015 UTC,"It does make sense; I usually give my impression of scents as a colour too, but in my case it's partly because I can't filter out the individual notes very well. Rice is pretty much my favourite food ingredient, so I think that would make a lovely comfort scent."

I said somewhere the other day that ichigo daifuku mochi would be a great perfume (red beans, strawberry, mochi), but I haven't seen anything related to Asian desserts at all besides milk tea (of which there are several).  However, you can probably find some scents similar to chiffon cakes and honey castella I bet, since there are a number of lighter cake scents with all different kinds of notes.

It definitely won't scent your whole house, but you'll be able to smell it in the same room.  It arrived looking the same as it does in the pictures in her shop.    I haven't tried any others, but I did look into a few different shops.  Shipping tends to be very expensive though, which is why I'm hesitant to try more. I found https://www.candlesbyvictoria.com/, which looks awesome, but I have never tried them.  Shipping would be almost $10 for me, and I'm not willing to pay that much in shipping for a candle.

My personal favorite scents from these are Peaches Crave Beaches (smells like a pina colada but with peaches instead of pineapple!) and Peaches Crave Vanilla (smells like the peaches that come out of the can, but in a super good way!)  I also really love First Blush from Haus of Gloi, but this is a scent from their Valentines collection, so you might have to look through destashes to find it.

So Arylide would be a light/ethereal plumeria + leafy scent. I don't know what sycamore smells like but I don't know what a lot of things smell like! Fragrantica says woody and earthy, plus I think plumeria's supposed to be more sweet and 'tropical.' So that's already tropical flower + a deeper dirtier 'green' which I feel like I don't see around much, so I'm definitely interested.   For Boss Fight I see for the 'fancy' side: chypre and amber and teak + the crushed cranberry. For the 'wild/weird' side: white mushroom, (ozone?), wet linen/fabric, and smoke/fire. So I would also go for calling it unisex there, and worth taking a risk on as I know everything else will blend together well, and Evonne tends to make me like notes I didn't think I liked ;)"

It smells like walking through the woods the day after a rainstorm. And considering we've only had, like, four days of sunshine here, I'd say it's appropriate. :P"

They should be here any minute and it's making me not be able to concentrate on my work. Hence, redditing.   Edit: they're here! I got samples of Mad Cow, Red Rover, Lavender Cardamom cookies, she added a sample of Native, which I already had and loved, no complaints, and a FS of Flowering Meadow (looks like she forgot the other FS of FM, but I sent her an email, I'm sure everything will work out and honestly, she could replace it with any of these and I would be thrilled). I SMELL SO GOOD RIGHT NOW!!!"

Alkemia Bohémiens en Voyage: Indian tobacco leaf, dried orris roots, freshly cut hay, sultry golden amber, rock rose, the subtle muskiness of sun warmed skin and buckskin suede, and a sweet kiss of wild sugar cane.  BPAL Peach Moon: Dew-covered peach blossom, white tea, moonlit musk, night-blooming jasmine, ho wood, and chrysanthemum.  Darling Clandestine Cloudswing: Lemongrass and vanilla and resiny wood and marigolds and new-mown clover and sun.  Haus of Gloi Narcosa (getting the most wear out of this one, loooove it): A thick haze of tonka and black vanilla, three jasmines, tuberose and ylang ylang.  Sixteen92 Eternal Return: Peat moss and damp garden soil, tomato leaf, beetroot, grass, herbs, lavender spikes, galbanum, sun-warmed oak bark.  Sixteen92 The Orchard Keeper (doesn't last on my skin so I mixed my sample into some unscented HoG hair oil): Night blooming jasmine, peach, apricot, pink pepper, sandalwood."

Indiemakeupandmore,3ctomi,lgbtqbbq,3,Fri Jul 10 18:16:22 2015 UTC,"SS Cameo- almond/rose/yellow cake with hints of ginger and citrus. Super mellow and creamy and foodie SS Blossom Jam Teacakes- not similar to Cameo at all, though they sound alike. Smells like raspberry jam and cake slathered with the richest sweetest fondant frosting and a hint of earthiness like black tea or strawberry leaves Alchemic Muse Pomona- Really light and playful mix of lavender and pear. Smells just like Mrs. Meyers Lavender soap to me, which is my favorite fresh scent of all time. Almost mainstream in its appeal, but a little more special. Alchemic Muse Orange Blossom Tea- Very realistic orange blossom and black tea scent. Fresh and astringent. Nocturne Alchemy Santalum White- A beachy, white driftwood version of their original santalum (pure spicy sandalwood). Smells billowy and wispy like wearing a white gauze dress on a beach at sunset. Possets Linden Blossom Tea- Honeyed green linden floral. Super sweet but green at the same time. Quite perfumey, I would say it's less ""fresh"" and more honeyed. Possets Dance with Me- All-season IMO but the grapefruit-vanilla comes alive in warm weather. Soft and sweet but never cloying. Possets Bear Lake Shake- Could see this working for autumn layered with a spice scent but it's pure raspberry cream on its own. Cocoa Pink Dreamsicle (Creamsicle?)- Awesome orange creamsicle scent if you're into that. Nocturne Alchemy Pharaonic Diurnal- Crazy-clean grapefruit, sandalwood, and amber. Smells like throwing open the windows when spring-cleaning and letting in freshness and sunshine."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ctomi,homicidalunicorns,2,Fri Jul 10 18:20:48 2015 UTC,"My samples of BPAL 51 and Possets Napoleon & Josephine have been well-loved this summer. Definitely upgrading to bottles when they run out.  Never thought I'd like a primarily fruity perfume, but 51 is lovely and smells like it could be a higher end mainstream perfume. Napoleon & Josephine is a straight up rose explosion. Not quiet, subtle rose or sweetened or spicy rose, just ROSE. It's wonderful. Only problem is longevity; my skin eats it within two or three hours."

Indiemakeupandmore,3ctomi,elephantabate,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:38:39 2015 UTC,"I totally get you, most of mine are more traditionally autumnal as well!    Wiggle: Manora This scent is a blend of cool black tea and various sweet creamy notes. Because I tinker a bit compulsively, I added little hints of lotus and coconut to round out the gourmand nature of the fragrance.  (This is discontinued, I fear.)    Sweet Anthem: Lizie Dirt, Immortelle, Neroli, Oakmoss, Petit Grain, Tomato Leaf  (Also disconned?)    Arcana: Peaches Crave Vanilla    Wylde Ivy: Sandcastles reminiscent of a vacation beach house windswept with cool fall beach breezes. Not a typical water scent by any means, this scent is fresh, sweet, and dreamlike blend of Coconut, Ginger, and Citrus fruits    Blooddrop: Merci 99. It's a ""thank you for purchasing"" gift with no notes listed, but it's an iced tea sort of thing, lovely.     Moonalisa: Tea Reader This is a blend of four teas, Earl Grey, Orange Pekoe, Green and Black Tea oils, lemon, a slight hint of pastry.    Arcana: Vampire's Garden the sweetly herbaceous scent of freshly turned earth, blood oranges and staked tomato vines under a midnight sky    HoG: Honeysuckle Lemon Curd Rich lemon curd with a touch of fresh honeysuckle    HoG: Apothecary Old books, bubbling concoctions, herbs and creaking floor boards! A pure essential oil blend of: Lemongrass, rosemary, blood cedar, sweet basil, lavender and the tiniest drop of vetiver.    I just packed up all of my perfumes so I can put in new shelves to contain them, but I am sure there are more. Mostly though I wear autumnal scents and wait for cool weather. :)  Edited to add the HoG"

Indiemakeupandmore,3cul3v,PizzaPizazz,4,Fri Jul 10 22:14:21 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for an exact dupe, I would reccommend just Googling ""Chocolate Amber dupe."" Here is one example of a fragrance that claims to be an exact dupe. I've never tried the shop so I can't recommend it, but the product looks like it's probably just a stock oil, or a stock oil mixed with a carrier oil/alcohol, so it would likely will be close to the original BBW fragrance. Many shops on Etsy will have Bath and Body Works dupes.  If you want to save money, you could just buy the fragrance oil wholesale and dilute it with a carrier oil such as fractionated coconut oil.   If you're looking for an original scent as opposed to a stock oil dupe, I can't give much advice, as I haven't tried a lot of chocolate perfumes. However, I adore Sixteen92's Mexican Hot Chocolate. It is a very realistic chocolate scent with hints of cinnamon and pink pepper. Unfortunately, it is only part of the winter collection, so it's not available right now. I've also heard great things about Smelly Yeti's Supermom, so that might be another option.   I'm sure plenty of users here will have other recommendations."

Indiemakeupandmore,3ctpk3,toxidlotus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:40:33 2015 UTC,I still consider myself a total n00b  at all makeup stuff so this might sound really stupid to you and everyone but... I was scared of this primer at first. It stays soft for a looong time (like the texture of very soft lip balm) so you can push it around even when its loaded with shadow. However it doesnt stick to itself much so it doesnt crease or wear away throughout the day. This is very hard to explain..... but I've thickly coated my lids and patted on glitter and it lasted all day without spreading out.  Before this I have only tried cheapo drugtore primers and a very old mary kay primer from my mom but ive learned to work with this Eccentric primer and it's pretty great. I think? Its like a glue stick that never fully dries it just gets squishy... like I said im a noob and only taught myself without any input.

Indiemakeupandmore,3ct36z,NurseChansey,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:42:33 2015 UTC,So glad I waited on getting the summer scents cause I'm all over this. I wonder how long their availability will be though?
Indiemakeupandmore,3ct36z,surewhynot123,3,Fri Jul 10 16:29:53 2015 UTC,It will be available July 15 - august 15

Indiemakeupandmore,3ct36z,LatinaAphrodite,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:29:28 2015 UTC,Never tried or heard of Sixteen92 before. That description alone has got me convinced they're at least half-way decent. LOL
Indiemakeupandmore,3cttgy,Absinthe42,2,Fri Jul 10 18:48:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, so USPS lost my package for two days, and I was very upset, and it was supposed to get here tomorrow. I went to check my mail, and surprise! Yayyyy!  Okay, first of all, how amazing is Mermaid Cat? I got it for being in a private group. Seriously, I'm in love. My camera stinks and made the teal shift look silver but I SWEAR its the most gorgeous blue teal shift I have ever seen.  The Thirteenth Gift and He Was No Frog are the standout favorites for me. TTG is like a more pink version of Rapunzel Had Extensions when applied over PE. I think it and Mermaid Cat are going to be BFFs.   I love green, and Calliope is my favorite muse (yes, I'm dorky enough to have a favorite), so that shadow was a slam dunk for me. LOVE. (Side note, if anyone has a Calliope hand mirror they don't use and are willing to part with... Just saying.)  My free sample was Melpomene, and WOW. This is going to be the prettiest eyeliner ever once I foil it, my blue eyes will be positively luminescent.   I also ordered two hand mirrors, one in Euterpe (muse of music? Fuck yes) and the Mermaid one, and they're just as gorgeous as I thought they'd be. I'm sorry I didn't photograph them. I got a little excited.   Overall, this order, aside from USPS failing yet again, was a 12/10, will absolutely buy in the future. I want full sizes of pretty much everything but Rusalka, because it pulls reeeeaalllyyy blue on me, which emphasizes my jaundice like undertones a little too much for my liking haha."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cttgy,adoorbleazn,2,Fri Jul 10 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"I have such high hopes for Mermaid Cat! Every swatch picture I've seen so far has made the shift looks silver, but every person who's swatched it has called it teal-- so I'm pretty sure I need to see it in person and all cameras are the devil. My order has actually already arrived, but I'm out of town so I have to wait until Monday before I can take a glitter bath D':"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cttgy,THE_DINOSAUR_QUEEN,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:36:11 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a shade you have to see in person to get the full effect. Have you ever seen Geek Chic's Sexy In Suspenders? Mermaid Cat is literally the exact same type of shadow, except rose gold and teal instead of tan and light blue."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cttgy,adoorbleazn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:06:50 2015 UTC,"They're all so pretty! Just wondering, when did you place your order? I placed one on the 27th and haven't gotten a shipping email yet."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cttgy,THE_DINOSAUR_QUEEN,3,Fri Jul 10 23:10:35 2015 UTC,My order was placed on the 17th and shipped on Monday.
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,Typical-Geek,25,Fri Jul 10 11:34:11 2015 UTC,"Reddish base with a green duo chrome -- I'm pretty sure the reason the bags look different is because it depends on how much of the base rubbed into the bag, but they should look the same in application?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,dahliasmiles,7,Fri Jul 10 11:49:15 2015 UTC,I agree. No Men Like Me has a similar look to it when you see it in the bag versus in a jar because it looks really gray in the bag
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,CeeCee221b,11,Fri Jul 10 12:07:25 2015 UTC,"I think in general, the full size will give you the best idea of what is supposed to look like. Samples can sometimes be slightly different due to how much of some pigments stick to the bag."
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,hybbprqag,7,Fri Jul 10 14:37:28 2015 UTC,Do they look different swatched?
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,TRexpert,8,Fri Jul 10 13:31:47 2015 UTC,One of the baggies is like the full size another is more red.
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,considerthelilies,3,Fri Jul 10 14:06:26 2015 UTC,"I've got a sample and a mini of Baker's Boy that are different swatched. (I've never posted swatches, so I'll get around to it one of these days!) Even my husband could tell they were different, and he's not always very good at colors. :D"
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,beautifulmess7,3,Fri Jul 10 14:21:07 2015 UTC,"The sample I had looked like your second, more red sample.  I got mine from the anniversary sale.  I don't have it anymore because it was a super orange-y red that looks horrible on me."
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,luminous_delusions,6,Fri Jul 10 17:06:53 2015 UTC,"It's a red-orange with a slight green shift. Like others said, the baggies look different because different amounts of the the red base have stuck to the plastic."
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,salapeno,2,Fri Jul 10 13:49:59 2015 UTC,My sample looks like your first one. Its from about December.
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,dartigen,2,Fri Jul 10 12:31:40 2015 UTC,"Jars and sample baggies can be highly deceptive, especially with colours that have sheens or shifts. There's another colour in the same collection that looks camo green in sample baggies, but goes on dark brown (Salt & Stone, I think?).   I have two sample baggies of ILaM, one I received last year and one I received from the anniversary sale this year. They look very different in the bags, but they apply pretty much identically."
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,ichikoa,7,Sat Jul 11 06:40:59 2015 UTC,Honestly? Sounds like a quality control issue.
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,cocytusg,13,Fri Jul 10 17:46:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, ""quality control issue"" is kind of what I associate with Shiro's glosses at the moment.  :/  I have not been seeing good things lately."
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,Hirenkei,6,Fri Jul 10 18:49:51 2015 UTC,"It sucks because I love how non-gloopy they feel, but the dark colors are so ridiculously streaky that I pretty much just use them as stains. My Red in my Ledger looks entirely different from their website swatch too...Not even close! I keep seeing mess ups in people's orders posted here too."
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,cocytusg,2,Fri Jul 10 19:06:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever seen a review of Red in My Ledger where the owner was happy with it: I think it's been streaky for everyone. The only way I can wear mine is if it's over a waxy lip base to keep it from settling.  Other than that, I've been happy with the other glosses I have from them except for the Nic Cage easter gloss. Completely sheer. I ended up mixing in some eye shadows to give it some color.  I love their formula and texture and I adore most of the glosses I've gotten from them, but I've been seeing so many inconsistencies lately that makes me too nervous to try them again at the moment.  :("
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,Hirenkei,2,Sat Jul 11 03:16:20 2015 UTC,"I actually love mine BUT the color is ridiculous and is just so damn different from everyone's I've ever seen... Mine is a very very deep red-purple color. The picture on Shiro's site makes it look almost brown toned? Idk. When I first opened it it was a horrible streaky mess, but I left it alone for awhile and both the color and streakiness changed. It's a lot less streaky now and it darkened up so much. But still streaky enough for me to think twice about bothering to use it. :( It sucks because I really love the formula. It reminds me of the Kevyn Aucoin lip gloss I have...and that's like 30$!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,breviloquent-,4,Sat Jul 11 04:29:15 2015 UTC,I got a lipgloss with a completely different swatch to what it was online and messaged Caitlin twice and never got a response. Gave up after that
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,cocytusg,3,Sat Jul 11 03:20:16 2015 UTC,"Whoa, that's the first time I've heard of just not getting a response from Shiro.  :/   I'd say try again: if she hears of it, Caitlin typically does as much as she can to remedy an unhappy situation."
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,breviloquent-,2,Sat Jul 11 23:24:48 2015 UTC,Yeah the issue is that i brought it off the FFC site because im in australia and i honestly dont think its worth the effort for her or myself :( Planning on just giving it away to a friend :(
Indiemakeupandmore,3csdla,savahontas,2,Mon Jul 13 06:46:33 2015 UTC,I think the middle one is wrong. OP does the one on the left match the full sized?
Indiemakeupandmore,3ctayl,PhyrraNyx,2,Fri Jul 10 16:32:59 2015 UTC,Brujah as in as Vampire the Masquerade?  That geekiness combined with that positive of a review clearly means I should get it :D
Indiemakeupandmore,3ctayl,MistressBats,4,Fri Jul 10 22:57:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's just Bruja as in witch, but yeah it does remind me of Vampire the Masquerade :) That's still one of my all time favorite RPGs"

I sincerely hope that LCL makes more lipstick shades because the formula works really well for me. It's comfortable and it clings to the lips. I finally have a really cool, edgy nude shade in Bruja (it looks like a dirty pink taupe on me) and I love the deep fuchsia / magenta of Cinderhella. I also made a video for youtube for it to spread the word about this awesome cruelty free and vegan company :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,tippyx,8,Fri Jul 10 17:20:35 2015 UTC,"Haus of Gloi's Twice is Nice is a realistic cookie scent. The description is: Buttery sugar cookie, with shavings of creamy coconut and topped with toasted almond slivers."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,badluckbelle,3,Fri Jul 10 17:57:07 2015 UTC,Thirding! Straight up coconut cookies. It's AMAZING.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,hellatkk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:14:51 2015 UTC,Yes! It's one of those scents that really evoke the texture of the thing it's supposed to smell like.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,hermeownie,3,Fri Jul 10 17:36:12 2015 UTC,Agreed!
Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,readsinbed,2,Fri Jul 10 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, Supermom is great. Smells like a straight up warm mug of hot cocoa and then chills down into a chocolate chip cookie scent after a little while."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,eredria,5,Fri Jul 10 21:24:32 2015 UTC,"I had a custom scent made by Epically Epic Soap from Etsy. The notes were almond, brown sugar, marshmallow and cinnamon. It smells just like heavenly cookies. The cost was $12 for the custom."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,Linxi015,5,Fri Jul 10 20:47:39 2015 UTC,Epically Epic does AWESOME customs doesn't she? I have a great green tea one and another lychee. Did you do any others besides the cookie one? :)

Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,surly_elk,2,Fri Jul 10 18:47:46 2015 UTC,Fabled Fragrances Dia de Los Muertos smells like snickerdoodles and Hansel and Gretel is gingerbread-y.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,Estridde,2,Fri Jul 10 18:32:00 2015 UTC,"I concur with Hansel and Gretel by Fabled Fragrances. It's a very creamy, smooth dark gingerbread scent (and I swear I smelled mint in my sample). It's very work-safe and nice!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,The_Crites,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:27:36 2015 UTC,It has a slight mint chocolate chip note in it! It is a nice one. I think they do gourmands exceptionally well.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,Estridde,2,Fri Jul 10 23:02:12 2015 UTC,"I know this may be down to personal skin chemistry, but Darling Clandestine's Circassian morphs from chocolate chip cookies to sweet latte to milk chocolate on me, which is delicious and I can definitely recommend it. A bonus is that the solid version has a creamy undertone to it.   Smelly Yeti's Supermom is also pretty fantastic, as it's straight up hot chocolate in a bottle. The ample vials are also cute as hell (not that that should count, but it's definitely a plus in my book)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,Ansitru,2,Fri Jul 10 19:39:44 2015 UTC,"Man, I am so sad(for me lol) you get that from circassian! All I get is a small bit of chocolate and a LOT of what smells like a Catholic Church lol."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,Dahlianeko,2,Fri Jul 10 21:16:10 2015 UTC,"Oh no! D:  Though, if it's any consolation, I had expected Circassian to be more heavy on the coffee-note. So while I do love how it morphs, I'm still in search of my perfect coffee-scent."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cthe0,Ansitru,2,Fri Jul 10 21:32:11 2015 UTC,"If you like coffee and chocolate, try HOG vice! It smells like a coffeehouse/Frappuccino to me."

It's a bit over our initial budget, but the building, location, and the space seem to be worth it! We have expressed our interest and hopefully all goes well. What's left to do is to meet the owner in person, complete the paperwork, and see if I need to go through any board approval. I'm getting overly excited and have been going crazy online with IKEA, Bed Bath & Beyond, Target, and Amazon. With furniture & appliance shopping and figuring how to make use of the space in the apartment, it's like playing SIMS, but in real life! XD    The only downside? I'm going to have to be on a low-buy for a long time... :x      Edit: Breaking Benjamin & Thousand Foot Krutch are going to be playing here in Sept!!!! I'm so damn excited right now.

Indiemakeupandmore,3csrvl,surly_elk,5,Fri Jul 10 18:20:29 2015 UTC,"I had an indie nightmare last night.  In my dream, I was sitting on my best friend's couch in Denver.  I went to open up my current make up obsession, my matte palette from Blackbird...only to find that all the shadows were completely crushed!!!  Naturally, make up spilled all over the couch.  I rushed to clean it up, but it was too late.  My two best friends went outside and wouldn't be friends with me anymore.    The only upside is that in my dreamland, you can fix crushed shadows with just water because they already have a ""binding agent"".    I'm dreaming about make up.  I think I may have a problem."

I noticed that Sorceress looks identical to Ten Three's Heartbeat Bridge in the tube, so I went to swatch them-- and the minute I opened Sorceress, a volcano of liquid lipstick exploded from inside the tube and ruined my pants.

I have the funds but I don't think I should purchase anything for a while. Might cancel my active subscriptions, too. Checking in to /r/MakeupRehab ASAP!

It's hard to think that this happened to real people and while intellectually, I understand that the Cultural Revolution happened, putting faces on it makes me tear up. It's also one of the things never talked about in my family and I hope none of my family members had to experience it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3csrvl,surly_elk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"I know quite a few people who experienced the Cultural Revolution (GCR), including one whose father was a top General and in Mao's inner circle during the Communist Revolution then was disgraced and imprisoned during the GCR.  Then he was taken from school and sent for re-education in the countryside (where he met his later wife).  Fortunately, because he is a genius at languages, he was one of the very, very few allowed to return to college (to study middle Eastern languages).  Now, he is one of very few people in the world who can read Cuneiform (Ancient Babylonian).    One of the things that is very interesting is how the GCR shaped the face of Chinese politics even to this day.  Tian'anmen went down the way it did really BECAUSE of the GCR because there is a heightened fear and distrust of student-led protests or movements in China that comes straight from a fear of returning to the chaos of the GCR.  It was a bad time, most certainly, but I do feel like it gets a bit over-dramatized by ex-patriot anti-Communists who have left the PRC and sort of play up the West's Fear of the Reds.  I say this because 1.  The first-hand accounts I have been told by people I know well are significantly more tempered and 2. It certainly was not worse than the Japanese Occupation/rule of Chiang Kai-shek (30's-40's), the Chinese Civil War (ended in 1949), or the Great Leap Forward (1954-1961).  And you rarely get memoirs on those.  As China continues to open up, I wonder if we will get non-expat accounts of the GCR."

On the upside, I had a fabulous last-minute dinner party for him and his co-workers last night that ended with me destroying them all at poker after the kids went to bed.  Yay! I also made a big bag of little polymer clay teeny-tiny tree stumps, mushrooms, and ""houses"" to go on top of a set of fake nails I've been painting for a fairy garden nail design."

My mail order pharmacy sent out the prescription late, and though they should have arrived Wednesday, there was a mixup with delivery, so long story short two days without meds = minor withdrawal that manifested in wanting to sleep all day.  ...Also, it's super good that I went on a perfume/makeup/bath & body (minus hair) no buy, because 4th of July weekend hit me hard. Necessary purchases, promise. I'm 1) going back to Curly Girl Method (curls already happier!), thus new hair products required and 2) in the process of rehauling my entire wardrobe. More than half of what I own is remnants from teenagerhood, so replacements are necessary.  End result: 6 orders that have yet to be delivered, 5 made in the last week. Bras, eShakti dresses, jewelry, and hair stuff from CurlMart, Sweet Curls Elixirs, and a destash. Oy vey.  Guess I'm definitely going to be destashing again on Sunday."

The only real bad thing that happened is as soon as I got home from sephora, I came down with a stomach bug of some kind! It could've even been heat stroke, it was 34C yesterday, which was insane considering I live in Canada. Still recovering from yesterday, does anyone know of some good foods to eat with an upset stomach? I have celiacs disease so that limits my options."

I love my internship but I also want to get off my no-buy, you know?  Otherwise my co-worker and I are going to this event where they have a yoga class at the zoo tomorrow so I'm really excited for that (I think I made a friend?!). I'm spending today trying to work on the whole getting a job thing and planning on going swimming later.

I have been unable to use my body too much for health reasons for most of the year so I'm super excited to be able to put it to work again!

(No air conditioning here, plus I have low tolerance for heat, so I SUFFER beyond 85F.)    Other than that, my diploma apparently does not arrive until three months after grad, and there are jobs I can't apply to with just a transcript to prove I have the degree I claim to have.  In fact, I noticed an error on the site because one page says the diploma is sent out six months after graduation.  When I contacted them, they merely thanked me for letting them know and that it's had that error for a while now.  Um. Are we keeping the typo for nostalgic purposes? Why is the error still there?

Shadow is terrified of fireworks so last weekend was awful. We have doggy sedatives left over from our move, so I gave him some of those on the fourth. Which basically meant he was high and scared. When it came time to go outside (side note: they now go issue BY THEMSELVES in the fenced years, my fucking FANTASY came true!), I said, ""come on let's go out!"" trying to sound happy. He stopped and looked at me, flattened his ears, and emptied his bladder all over the kitchen floor. Didn't even lift his leg, just let it go. Then slunk away. Poor puppy I felt so bad.   And then our Ridgeback has this weird thing where he throws up every other month or so. We've done vets and tests and lots of money and changed his food, etc. He used to puke and poop blood out of nowhere, my fiancé and I would freak the fuck out and take him immediately to the vet's. It started to get to a point where it would happen and right after, he'd get super excited because that meant a car ride. Luckily he doesn't do the poop thing anymore (we were starting to think it was either the water or mold in our ceilings in NC) and it's been much better, but he's still thrown up a couple times since our move. He's usually pretty good about throwing up on the floor (as opposed to the couch or bed) but he had a big accident Tuesday morning. Puked right on the end of the bed at 4 in the morning. Have you ever tried to untie a duvet cover while simultaneously try not to get puke on the rest of the bed or your hand? I can now say I have. And because we have a big down (alternative) comforter, I got to go to the Laundromat the next day. Ugh I loathe the Laundromat.   In other news, we're going to a street fair tomorrow!

That said, though, everybody does have about six weeks to drum up the karma they need! :) If participating is something you would like to do, I don't think it's out of the reach of even newer members around here... 300 may seem like a lot, but it comes pretty quickly  :) And I always love seeing your comments, Sabby! :)"

Random exchanges are pretty much all stalking (though some people make alt accounts to contact their exchange partner)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3crec5,Millyish,5,Fri Jul 10 04:22:55 2015 UTC,Maybe have a little questionnaire to fill out so your partner can get an idea of your interests?
Indiemakeupandmore,3crec5,Absinthe42,6,Fri Jul 10 05:56:32 2015 UTC,"This is an awesome idea! Last year I think someone put together a list of suggested questions and posted it for it for others to use, it was great :) I think we should definitely include something like for people who might want to use it!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3crec5,drawsincolor,4,Fri Jul 10 06:00:49 2015 UTC,"Sounds like an good idea, for example, you know what colours your partner likes more, or what kind of cosmetics ( eyeshadows vs lipstics for example )."

I wasn't sure if it was actually doing anything.  First up for perfume testing: OHWTO's Besos del Sol. Pretty, but it's time to finally admit that gardenia is one of the few florals that don't work for me. Every indie perfume with it has smelled slightly (or very) antiseptic to me.

Every scent I've gotten has exceeded my expectations.    Mist Becoming Rain - ""Rainwater, mist drenched hazel wood, meadow grasses, sage blooms, orris root, ozone, grey amber."" Wild Swans At Coole - ""An enchantingly fae blend of sweet flag, orris root, fen violet, wild autumn orchids, blue moor-grass, blackthorn wood, drying ferns, dried sedge grasses soaked in dew, and veils of mist parting over lake water."" La Sirena - ""A mesmerizing spell of oceanic aquatics, saline seaweeds, and garlands of fresh Tiare flowers offered to the sea. Hauntingly elusive."" Desiderada - ""The exquisitely simple beauty of an evening stroll on a warm June evening. Fresh honeysuckle blooming under a rising full moon, ivy vines, dew dampened grass, riverbed clay, old barnwood, and earthy vetivert root. "" Woods On A Snowy Evening - ""Freshly fallen powder snow, juniper berries, hemlock pine, white needle balsam pine, flat cedar, camphorous evergreens, and icy aquatic elements."" A Roll In The Hay - ""A delightful summertime romp with dried hay, fresh green grass, early summer wildflower honey, vanilla grass, vanilla leaf, and wild poppy. "" Mesnée d'Hellequin - ""An uncivilized tangle of balsam pine, cypress needles, cedar bark, teakwood, vetiver root, galbanum, lichen, moss, dried leaves, damp earth, and forest fungi."" Gaea - ""Forest loam under warm spring sunshine, new ferns poking up through decaying leaves, maple sap flowing over lichens, mosses and wet stones at the edge of a vernal pool.""

Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,LatinaAphrodite,3,Thu Jul 9 23:46:42 2015 UTC,"No problem! The ones that are ""incense-y"" are ones where the description clearly said something like ""dark ambers"" or ""musk"". Looking the above ones up, I tried to stear clear of those. That's what you have to look out for I think. I also tried to not include ones that out right said ""patchouli"" or ""sandalwood"" or anything like that.   Again, I mostly order fruit and sweet oils from Alkemia and I've never had trouble with them being musky unless it said it included musk in it. So yeah. :)"

Wild swans is a sweet, powdery blue scent, desiderata is mostly floral, roll in the hay is all hay and honey, woods on a snowy evening is minty, cool evergreen, and mesnee is also a cool, almost minty tree scent. I actually really like most of these scents, so totally try them out if they appeal to you, but ""mist becoming rain"" and ""vert sur le ver"" are probably the closest to what you sound like you're looking for with the first request!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,lgbtqbbq,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:42:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I was thinking about doing a sample pack to try a handful and your comment definitely helped me narrow down my choices.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,lgbtqbbq,2,Fri Jul 10 21:09:48 2015 UTC,"No problem! I've tried probably about 2/3 of all the alkemia scents, so let me know if you have any questions about any of them when you're picking out stuff for a sample pack :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,lgbtqbbq,3,Fri Jul 10 21:14:14 2015 UTC,"Sixteen92's Eternal Return reminds me of a wet garden being warmed by the sun after a storm. It's earthy, fresh, and super damp. Gorgeous. I'm waiting on my EDP but that was my impression from the oil.  Can't help you with the ocean because I'm not into literal aquatics sorry :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,lgbtqbbq,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:07:05 2015 UTC,"I agree, I love Eternal Return, I think I'm just being picky and looking for that specific damp, petrichor smell; Eternal Return focuses more on the garden aspect, less on the rain. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want to smell like the air after a summer sun shower?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,ZeroDagger,2,Thu Jul 9 23:24:20 2015 UTC,"This is a bit reaching-for-it because I admittedly have little experience with fresh/water smells, but I tried SS Riverside Hayride the other day and while it wasn't my cup of tea for everyday, it was a gorgeous watery dirt smell with the crispness of carnations. It smelled like...the back of an expensive flower shop, where you're surrounded by dampness and a hint of floral. It's way less ""garden"" than Eternal Return, but may be a tad heavy on the dirt...I think you should try it though, the dirt is not like smelling a handful of dirt, it's the scent of wetness wafting off of a dirt road."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,chocolatebundtcake,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:50:22 2015 UTC,"That may not be the scent I'm looking for, but it sounds like a scent I need...I mean, want."

Happy to send them free if you just want to pay for shipping. If you're USA it's probably easy enough, int'l would be trickier :)"

Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,pondicus,4,Fri Jul 10 00:51:12 2015 UTC,"Alchimia Apothecary has a Petrichor perfume.  You could maybe try layering it with something else to get the thunderstorm effect?  It pretty much smells like rain.  They also have one called Thunderstorm, but it has the ozone element you don't want."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,pondicus,5,Fri Jul 10 00:51:52 2015 UTC,"Alchimia Apothecary has a few you may be interested in: Tsumani, Tugboat, and Thunderstorm (I call them the three T's)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,-drbadass-,3,Fri Jul 10 01:05:27 2015 UTC,"I like Lou Lou's The Mermaid's Seashell for ocean! I don't smell much floral, tbh.  Mostly just a sandy, salty beach! Here it is"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,ThirteenDream,3,Fri Jul 10 00:25:45 2015 UTC,"In oceanic aquatics, I see BPAL R'lyeh and Cthulhu mentioned a lot. See if you can get them in a destash if you're not in the US (their international shipping rates will be the death of your bank account).  BPAL Sea of Glass is definitely aquatic, but with sweet white florals; it's more along the lines of a tropical scent, so not really what you're looking for.   I wonder if anyone does an aquatic single note? I know Demeter does, but they don't carry them in oils, and I don't think a spray would layer too well. (And they're not exactly low-cost either.)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,LiberVix,3,Fri Jul 10 09:22:18 2015 UTC,It is important that I own a perfume called Cthulhu. Thank you for informing me that this exists.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,LiberVix,2,Fri Jul 10 15:31:10 2015 UTC,"For scent 1 you might like Solstice Scents Foxcroft, it smells like a rainy day to me and it definitely has a bit of the green you're looking for as well"

Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,Estridde,2,Thu Jul 9 23:24:50 2015 UTC,"Darling Clandestine's Gram-Negative, which is similar to Sixteen92's Supercell with the greenness, might fit your Scent 1?  Sixteen92's The Awakening smells a lot like ocean saltwater to me. Like the afternoon after a long swim at the beach and your skin is all salty. Darling Clandestine Mishigami smells like a deep lake as well with a bit of sandiness."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cqczo,panlymancakes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:37:03 2015 UTC,"Excellent, I will definitely check those out because, as I said, I was super intrigued by Supercell but too slow to nab one. Thanks :)"

Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,herownhero,24,Thu Jul 9 16:59:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a slatherer.   Wrists, behind the ears, collarbone and  occasionally in the crook of my elbows and on my shoulders if I'm going sleeveless and it's not an overpowering scent.   I prefer little bits of it all over rather than a ton on places like my wrists where I just don't get the duration of wear that I do on other places. Maybe due to handwashing."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,salapeno,7,Thu Jul 9 17:46:03 2015 UTC,Guilty of slathering here too. I try not to slather too much when I'm going out though since people are sensitive to smells.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,SirWaffalot,3,Thu Jul 9 19:04:28 2015 UTC,"Another fellow slatherer here. Wrists, all up and down both arms, behind my ears, my neck, and my collarbone. I use perfume oils mostly and sometimes I'll even do a light spray of a brand perfume over it if it compliments the oil. And I've never been told I have too much perfume on,having both a boyfriend and a mother who get absolutely sick if they pass by a stranger who's wearing too much perfume. So yeah. The trick is to be delicate and paring, but getting the right spots, I think. I am always told by people I hug that I smell really good. lol"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,LatinaAphrodite,5,Thu Jul 9 23:06:30 2015 UTC,"Some perfumes require just a dab, in which case I'll do a bit on the wrists. If the perfume is more light with less throw, I tend to slather from wrist to elbow, because I find the scent carries well if I have it on a larger surface area. If I really want to ""smell myself"" I'll put some on my throat/collarbone area."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,lgbtqbbq,5,Thu Jul 9 17:04:40 2015 UTC,I apply it to my wrists and the hollow of my neck.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,PhyrraNyx,4,Thu Jul 9 17:55:02 2015 UTC,"Usually a small dab on each wrist, and a dab in between the boops. If the scent i'm wearing isn't very strong or I just really love it, I'll also do a dab on the inside of each elbow."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,hannahpancakes,3,Thu Jul 9 18:54:18 2015 UTC,"Well this morning I accidentally cover my hands on Two Finger Ballet. Normally, just a dab on each wrist, behind my ears, and at the base of my throat."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,krysiefishie,4,Thu Jul 9 17:22:41 2015 UTC,"My wrists and my collarbones! I just dab it on one wrist, rub those together, then rub those on my neck/collarbones."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,nighttvales,4,Thu Jul 9 17:39:26 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, I start with the wrists and inner corners of my elbows with a dab. If perfume is lighter or I really want to tell the world about this wonderful amazing scent, then I put it on my chest (between the boobs) and on my neck (under the ears). More or less depends on the lasting power and sillage of the perfume. I haven't tried it on my hair yet, but for ""special"" occasions, I like praying perfume on my nape. Hugging and cuddle time is so much better."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,gottapoopy,4,Thu Jul 9 17:43:51 2015 UTC,Wrists and neck. I generally dab it on each wrist then run it on either side of my neck.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,smearedgoth,3,Thu Jul 9 19:29:49 2015 UTC,"Right between my breasts; amount depends on the silage, day, mood, whether or not others have to suffer my company.  I never do wrists because it wipes/washes off so quickly, and not near my face because it can be too strong for me, but the warmth and scent wafting up from my chest is perfect."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,elephantabate,3,Thu Jul 9 20:51:53 2015 UTC,"Wrists and neck usually. I will apply to the crook of my elbows, but I find the skin there is waaay more sensitive, and certain perfume oils will give me a burning sensation. Maybe perfumes with cinnamon? I never remember to keep track of which ones do it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,thebabypanda,3,Thu Jul 9 19:13:26 2015 UTC,"also a slatherer.   inner wrists, outer wrists, behind the ears, collarbone, inner elbow, and if it's date night, behind the knees."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,lynxpoint,3,Thu Jul 9 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"I start by dabbing in the crooks of my elbows, then dab what's left on my wrists and ears. I find that perfumes throw a lot stronger when I apply inside my elbows. I don't slather though. If a perfume isn't detectable with a dab, I don't bother. I have never tried applying between the tiddies though. I need to try that today."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,tightslacks,3,Thu Jul 9 21:36:37 2015 UTC,"Wrists, cleavage. Depends on the strength of the scent, but two swipes wrists, one swipe cleavage."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,bshaurette,2,Thu Jul 9 18:56:43 2015 UTC,"Normally the collarbone, but from now on I'm trying on the wrist first.  I tried something from a local boutique that left me with some interesting red lines sticking out from my blouse."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,AelisAndura,2,Thu Jul 9 19:16:31 2015 UTC,"I slather too. Inside and outside of wrists, inside of elbows, base of my throat between the collarbones, behind the ears and behind my knees. Sometimes I'll just dab it on the back of my neck at the hairline instead of behind my ears."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,toxidlotus,2,Thu Jul 9 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"Just a dab on each wrist and behind each ear. Used to do my collarbone as well, then I noticed it turns pink within a few minutes of contact. :("
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,intoyourskin,2,Thu Jul 9 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"With my HoG perfumes that have tremendous throw on my skin, usually just the wrists, or if I want to smell myself more, a little on my neck.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,2Srivitq,2,Thu Jul 9 20:38:22 2015 UTC,"I put it on my wrists and a little behind my ears. Just a few swipes on both wrists. If I'm not wearing long sleeves I'll put a bit on the crooks of my elbows.   Does anyone notice scents smelling off in certain places? If I try to put some on my neck or chest I always notice they tend to ""go bad"" - the scents get bitter and unpleasant. It's weird (and annoying!)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,msraindrop,2,Thu Jul 9 22:39:50 2015 UTC,Just the inner wrists. I like the option of smelling or not smelling my perfume so it's perfect.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,timsgirlfriend,2,Thu Jul 9 23:43:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely a slatherer. Wrists, boobs (dab on each), behind the ears, base of neck (both sides)... Sometimes also in the crook of my elbow too, and in my hair, if it's a subtle scent or I really, really like it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,DrogonUnchained,2,Fri Jul 10 00:14:00 2015 UTC,Crooks of my elbows and each side of my neck.  I never put it on my wrists since I wash my hands so much.  I use just a little bit on each area.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,chocolatebundtcake,2,Fri Jul 10 00:53:01 2015 UTC,Wrists mostly but sometimes my neck as well.    How much I apply depends on the blend.  Some with greater sillage I tend to apply less of but a lighter scent I might slather.  :-)
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,RhinestoneHousewife,2,Fri Jul 10 01:00:47 2015 UTC,I find scents last longest in the crooks of my elbows so I dab there using my wrists and rub what's left at the base of my throat and behind my ears (I like being able to smell what I'm wearing when I turn my head--and also people who hug me get a chance to smell me too).
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,weepy,2,Fri Jul 10 01:18:28 2015 UTC,"I feel obliged to put my two cents in as someone with fragrence allergies: i dont think you should be smellable until within arms reach or closer. If youre slathering maybe check in with close, honest, friends often about how fragrant you are. I often have to leave an exam room bc a person smells so strongly. A coworker of mine is guilty too and never notices until I mention it. Im sure you beautiful people smell lovely and I wish I could appreciate it, but thank you for being considerate of strangers! From my sister Ive learned one tiny touch of oil on the neck is enough for most scents. To me, perfume is a personal trait, until I step into your personal space I shouldnt sense it. It should be discovered, not announced."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,smittenkitten04,3,Sun Jul 12 02:44:12 2015 UTC,"It depends on the perfume. If it's really strong, like Sixteen92's Salem, I put just a teensy bit on my wrist. If it tends to fade quickly I like to put a little on my hair (rub wrist on hair) but for the most part I dab from the wand (if applicable) or press my wrist to the bottle and upturn it, and apply it to both wrists and under my neck."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cp1kb,normalcypolice,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:03:28 2015 UTC,"In summer I usually do a dab at the base of my neck and then a dab on each wrist and in the crook of each elbow. In winter, I'm wearing long sleeves so I do a dab under each side of my jaw and then at my back hairline. I usually put any perfumes I'm keeping into roll-on bottles - I buy them from eBay, they're quite cheap and range from fairly plain to quite decorative ones.  (I have learned the hard way to not put perfume oils anywhere that my clothes haven't touched It took me ages to figure out where the weird reddish stains were coming from on my shirt sleeves...turns out, yeah, BPAL Dragon's Blood, being bright red, tends to stain.)"

They don't come in a palette as they're sold as singles, but I keep mine in an empty MAC pro palette. I did have to stick magnetic tape on the bottoms to make them stick to the MAC palette. Z palettes might be differently magnetized?  I can try to do some swatches when I get home - I just got my most recent order and have eight total to swatch.  I think Uponaworld Cosmetics also has some pressed palettes, but the color selection seems very very similar in many of the quads so I haven't tried them."

Indiemakeupandmore,3co416,lgbtqbbq,2,Thu Jul 9 16:24:41 2015 UTC,You are making me blush. I just try to be honest. What's odd is that it doesn't smell remotely sunny in the vial. It smells like a beautiful cake but it's all creamy sunshine on the skin!
Indiemakeupandmore,3co416,lgbtqbbq,2,Thu Jul 9 16:45:13 2015 UTC,"Forgot to say if you love ginger but are sensitive to ""sharpness,"" try out Possets Silver Ginger. It's impossibly smooth and soft but still distinctly a ginger scent. It's one of my favorites."

Like smelling actual wet driftwood on a hot sandy beach. Not sharp at all.   The perfume oil was very musky and very sharp. Smelled really strong and a bit unpleasant. Glad this was just a sample.   The bubbling scrub was closer to the perfume oil, but not as sharp. The pumpkin butter was closer to the whipped soap, but with a weird extra muskiness and a slight tang.   I love the whipped soap, hate the oil, and am kind of meh about the rest."

The perfect ""my skin but (summer) better"" scent. I don't get much of the cannabis, although it may be lending itself to the earthy tone of the coconut in the drydown. This isn't an uber sweet coconut perfume."

I might just get a few samples from the General Collection just to see if her green/earthy scents are okay with my skin!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3co6vt,hill78,2,Fri Jul 10 10:29:46 2015 UTC,I love Seascape so much. One of the few scents I packed for my vacation. I would be happy to send you a little sample if you want.

Possets is in my top 3 companies and I went to Georgetown so...I wanted them to be awesome. The Seductive Jesuit is still my favorite perfume name of all time tho.

Indiemakeupandmore,3clp3e,dankybong,7,Wed Jul 8 21:50:39 2015 UTC,This is my very first time swatching for anything other than my own viewing. These are all 13 of my Shiro shadows. It's more for reference and not really a review but I will add this: I love Shiro. Ive been beyond happy with every shadow I've ordered. These are all swatched over Eccentric Cosmetics high intensity shadow primer in translucent. Enjoy!  The shadows are:  1) Moon Prism Power  2) Angry Cuccos  3) Maiden Queen  4) Lingered in Twilight  5) Detrivore Nocturnal  6) Detrivore Hermaeus Mora  7) Doge  8) Ziggy  9) Mother of Dragons  10) Skull Kid  11) He Loves His Hammer  12) Alkahestry  13) Scarlet Witch

Indiemakeupandmore,3cmyhz,speakstruth,2,Thu Jul 9 13:43:30 2015 UTC,I haven't ordered from her. I did a bunch of swatches for her website a long time ago and I still have all the colors. She was supposed to send me more to swatch like a year ago but I never heard anything from it. She's on my Facebook but she's not extremely active.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmyhz,thewindupbirds,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:55:39 2015 UTC,"While I was waiting for my last order and trying to find a way to contact her, I posted to her Facebook to see what was up. Shortly after, she took down all of the ""posts to page"". Fun, horrifying times.  Did you get to swatch that Twisted Mattes Orchid? That eyeshadow looked lovely."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmyhz,kadytheredpanda,2,Thu Jul 9 15:28:16 2015 UTC,Nope. I was looking forward to swatching them too. Any of the line swatches on the website are mine. I don't know why she just kinda flopped on her business. She should have just closed up shop or something if she didn't want to do it anymore. Did you ever get your order?
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmyhz,krysiefishie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:03:18 2015 UTC,"Nope. There was a point where she started to offer a refund and I said I'd rather wait for the order to arrive, and she was the one who basically said, ""No, let me just give you a refund to forget this whole thing.""    She gave up on the order before I did. That baffles me. And her website is still up, although pretty much all venues of communication to or from her are no longer available. I feel like I'm missing something here."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmyhz,PhyrraNyx,2,Thu Jul 9 19:46:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, really?! I wonder what's up with that. I know she was never really popular but she should still shut down the website if she doesn't plan on sending out orders. I know she was making soaps not too long ago but I'm not sure if she was selling them. That sucks though.  I did swatches of my mint colors with pink/red shifts/glitter. I'll upload it to imgur tomorrow. There were some kind of close colors but no exact matches."

Pyewacket Cat is a very warm, sweet, buttery vanilla, and it makes me think of a cake-scented candle, with a generous squeeze of something like lime that I'm guessing is the green musk. Pretty sure I'll be destashing this. edit: Late drydown is actually oddly smoky, so it's better, but I'm still not sold.  Rook started out with lots of almond, shortbread, and a bit of smokiness, and dried to a whole lot of clove and woodsmoke, very dry and spicy. It's not remarkable, but I like it."

Today I am sampling Olympia from Possets summer collection. This is different than my usual favorites and when I first put it on I thought I wasn't going to like it because its very clean, fresh, a little soapy. The longer I wear it though the more I adore it. It smells like clean skin right out of a bath. It is sexy in that powdery, intimate kind of way.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cmnj3,neutral-milk,12,Thu Jul 9 02:24:08 2015 UTC,"Notes to stay away from (potentially):  vanilla  amber  caramel/chocolate/food notes  tuberose  violet  almond  banana  honey  Notes to look out for:  vetiver  moss/oakmoss  peat/earth/dirt  flower stems  bamboo  mint  tea  cucumber  melon  Obviously this isn't a definite guide. There are certainly ""fresh"" perfumes with amber for instance, or really heavy powdery ones with tea in them, but just as a general rule, the top list of notes are commonly found in heavier more powdery perfumes, and the bottom list has notes commonly found in fresh aquatics.  Anything described in the indie world as green/fresh/aquatic/earthy would be a great start. I think you'd love Solstice Scents Riverside Hayride (carnations, water, dirt, and leaves), but you'd probably hate Nightgown (tuberose, gardenia, white chocolate, vanilla).  I generally hate aquatics but the one I tried recently that was AWESOME, even to my sensitive nose, was Alchemic Muse Ostara. The notes list: The eternal embodiment of spring pays tribute to you with a mix of hyacinth blossoms, myrtle, and wild heather fused with the soft green foliage of moss and ivy, gently grounded by a warm and earthy base of clove, cinnamon, and myrrh.  I didn't smell any spice in it, only gorgeous fresh floral hyacinth, myrtle, heather, and a gorgeous mossy ivy scent and something like a clear mountain stream.  EDIT GOD how could I forget my favorite fresh/earthy scent? Sixteen92 Eternal Return!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3cmnj3,catpuff,9,Thu Jul 9 21:35:04 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for a cooler more earthy/ watery scent? Clean and fresh but not citrusy   Yay, we have very similar taste in perfume, except that I also really like citrus scents. I recommend the following:  Unfortunately, I don't think Possets is a good brand for the type of scents you're looking for. They specialize in gourmands more than anything else, so their scents have very similar personalities. Possets is one of those companies that cater to a very specific type of customers, I think... because their catalog is more focused on musks, gourmands, powdery floral, and incense, whereas other companies' catalogs are more diverse and have little of everything (eg. Haus of Gloi, Sixteen92).  For scent recommendations:   Darling Clandestine Mishigami (very popular one, it's a summer limited edition) Haus of Gloi Ploughman (spring limited edition) Haus of Gloi The Brier's Path (summer limited edition, currently available) Haus of Gloi Selkie (very popular one but it's a spring limited edition) Midnight Gypsy Alchemy's Agua (currently on sale) Midnight Gypsy Alchemy's Tierra (currently on sale) Midnight Gypsy Alchemy's Viento (currently on sale) Solstice Scents Tenebrous Mist Solstice Scents Hand of Darkness Solstice Scents Covered Bridge (if you like mossy forest scents) Solstice Scents Foxcroft (if you like the smell of cool autumn air and damp leaves) Solstice Scents Riverside Hayride (similar to Covered Bridge but has carnation in it)   For note recommendation:   ozone driftwood moss bamboo dirt leaves grass clover"

I kind of loathe gourmands and despise vanilla: sometimes if they're in a perfume I like, I'll be like ""Ugh, okay, whatever"", but I am never joyous to know that they're there.   The samples I got from Solstice Scents were all very earthy or antique. ""Moss Covered Bridge"" smelled exactly like a sun-warmed wooden bridge. ""Library"" smells like a dusty library with a bunch of old leather bounds books and a wingchair, slightly warmed by filtered sunlight and kind of smoky, but with the bitey edge of color setting in. It's nasal magic. And the reviews I've heard here about perfumes from there with ""wet stone"" as a note have been very positive about smelling that stone. It's like hermit/witch-in-the-woods perfume. Love it.  Another favorite I have is ""Men Who Walks As Trees Amongst Their Fellows"" from Ten Three Labs. They basically combined all of their tree oils into one perfume. I'm waiting rather excitedly to receive ""Thunder"".  Aromaleigh recently came out with perfume called ""RUSALNAYA"" from Alchimia Apothecary for a collection. All of its notes are watery and murky (and water lilies and other aquatic plants, so not sure how strong those are), and it's been getting good reviews."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cm6g2,eraser_dust,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:56:55 2015 UTC,"I love BPAL's 2009 O! It makes me feel cuddly though, but chocolate and honey tends to make me want to curl up in bed and pig out on my own because I'm a pig who hates sharing sweets.  I think you'd like MGA's Chocolate Mystique then. It's now my favourite chocolate scent, and smells like rich, gourmet, milky dark chocolate with the richest almost floral fragrance."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm6g2,i_am_a_cyborg,2,Thu Jul 9 01:05:56 2015 UTC,"Haha!  I have that one. It's so nice, but it doesn't last very long on my skin. And yes, it smells like rich, milk chocolate and I want to eat it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm6g2,eraser_dust,2,Thu Jul 9 01:09:14 2015 UTC,"Aww! Yeah, I find that every natural perfume I try doesn't last that long on my skin. No idea why."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cm6g2,smearedgoth,5,Thu Jul 9 00:53:53 2015 UTC,Sixteen92 Grimm smells like a man I want to rub myself on. It's mossy and earthy with a tiny hint of chocolate that works so well with the other scents.  Violette Market's After Dark is sexiest cotton candy scent I've ever found. It's a perfect naughty date-night scent.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm6g2,lisaplusplus,2,Thu Jul 9 02:14:09 2015 UTC,Darling Clandestine Rivet smells pretty naughty to me! :)  Anything cotton candy.  Sticky ;)  BPAL Smut
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm6g2,eraser_dust,2,Thu Jul 9 03:19:07 2015 UTC,"I think BPAL snake oil is the sexiest scent I own. It's not necessarily naughty, but it's dark and rich and unabashedly sexy. It needed to sit a few months after I got it to get to that point though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm6g2,eraser_dust,4,Thu Jul 9 21:10:50 2015 UTC,"Supernova Sway actually makes me feel feminine and happy! Anyway, for me it's:   DC's Inked: It smells like a threesome. DC's Squander: Masculine apples. I find it intoxicating on my bf, but it gives him a headache :( HoG's Ploughman (bubbling scrub form): a loveable douche you just can't resist MGA's Earth & Wild Roots: That hot moment before you hook up Sweet Anthem's Red Queen: Hot trysts with a hot guy (or masculine leaning woman) in the Beauty & The Beast library. Deconstructing Eden's Delauney: It's the guy you want to marry. (too safe for you btw, /u/catpuff) Deconstructing Eden's Black No. 1: Willfully drowning yourself in sin Just plain Sumbawan Oud: It's so intoxicating. I love it. I smear it on my bf whenever I could ambush him."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm6g2,BlumeKraft,2,Thu Jul 9 00:43:29 2015 UTC,"Oh I totally forgot to mention Squander. It smells like Inked + red apple for me. it smells soooo sexy too.  On my wishlist:   Deconstructing Eden Black No. 1 and other DE scents MGA Earth & Wild Roots   I've only tried Ploughman in perfume, but I'm curious how it smells in other products. I noticed that there are certain scents that smell so amazing in emulsions and pumpkin butters, but not in perfume."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm6g2,speaksincolor,2,Thu Jul 9 00:52:36 2015 UTC,The perfume works for you?? I'm still aging it hoping it'll work for me! I don't know why it becomes really sweet and sugary as soon as it hits my skin :(  I'm still hopeful though...soon. It will smell good soon.

I'm hoping it'll do the series justice unlike the movie.  Also, immediately after that, I looked through my collection to see which books I lost during the move and bought em all on Amazon to reread :D"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,blonderuby,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:14:06 2015 UTC,"it looks amazing, i'm so happy! I think Netflix is gonna do it right, although I did love the casting of the original movie, Emily Browning as Violet was perfect. but yesss the series is also on my summer  reread list, I'm so pumped that attention is being brought back to the series!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,infamousjoe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:23:23 2015 UTC,"Haha I see a trend of Netflix series far surpassing a lot of tv shows out there.  I wonder how the format is going to be though.  Will it be a 13 episode series with each episode following one book?  I followed the series as it was being released back then so I was pretty confused by the end (also why I want to just reread it all in one go).  Hopefully they won't drag the series out super long, maybe two episodes per book?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,blonderuby,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"i'm hoping it's either 2 40-minute or maybe just one hour long episode per book? although i feel like they'd have to be longer near the end of the series? i dont know, but it'll be cool to see later books turned into episodes  and getting deeper into the story since the original movie only covered bits and pieces of the first few books. and I'm interested to see if/how they narrate it since Lemony Snicket has such a unique voice for his stories."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,infamousjoe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:14:55 2015 UTC,"Oh that's true, the later books were a lot thicker!  I definitely wouldn't mind those being split up into several episodes.  It's funny because I usually hate when Hollywood does that to movies (splitting up the last one into two parts to make money).  The movie definitely condensed several books and made up its own ending.  DID NOT LIKE.  Also about Lemony Snicket, I wonder how they'll insert the random stuff about Beatrice lmao."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,blackdustbelt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:44:08 2015 UTC,"That last book was sad as fuck :'(   Edit: I hope they keep the voice over as a series of letters, with Beatrice's voice assisting at the very end."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,infamousjoe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:38:43 2015 UTC,"Wait wait, Beatrice has a voice at the end?  Yeah, I need to reread those ASAP.  I do remember being sad at the last book, but the last time I read it was years ago and I was still pretty confused over everything lmao."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,blackdustbelt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:20:42 2015 UTC,"It's a follow up book called the Beatrice Letters. It basically ties up the series, and IMO should be included in the main series, since you really can't figure out the ending without it.   Edit: it's not really a book. It's a short collection of letters duh. And it is quite confusing without the other books for reference."

A rose scented perfume that references Bobby and Minh's hobby (although to Minh, jock straps smell better).  It's always sunny in Philadelphia: Green Man green eyeshadow. I don't care how literal it is, I need it. Mantis Toboggan eyeshadow - brown with a green duo chrome. Electric Dream Machine - Dennis's grey spandex costume is the perfect color. Not Like A Bird at all - blue and black birdlike shift (sorry Dee). References to American Badass, Rickety Cricket, Kitten Mittons, Nightman, Froggy, Wild Card, and Diaper Time/Dancing Man also need to happen.  Um yeah...I'm kind of obsessed with those shows."

Camp Jellyjam would smell like a bunch of berry jams, fresh tennis balls, and the faint scent of moss and wetness.  The Haunted Mask could smell of something rubbery with something green perhaps? Amber and resins.  ...I may have just watched the trailer, yes.  Edit - added more ideas heheheh"

I wanna smell like an alien neon-colored forest from The Beast from the East (though I don't know how the hell anyone can make a perfume that would evoke that!)  The Werewolf of Fever Swamp would be pretty easy though. It'd smell like swamp water (like what Love Potion Perfumerie does), gassy green notes, earth (maybe a few berries strewn around here) and the sinister edge of grey fur.   Plus there's Deep Trouble (my fave book as a kid) which could either pay a homage to the gawjeous mermaid (sweet pink notes mixed with blue-green aquatics), the sinister shark or the dark murky depths of the ocean itself (plus the bright red ~poisonous coral~ which might be Dragon's Blood at the beginning of the fragrance).

Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,gorgossia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:03:15 2015 UTC,I feel like Invisible Monsters doesn't get talked about a lot as a whole! There was the whole movie disappointment a couple of years ago. It's my favorite Palahniuk story (possibly tied with Rant).

Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,gorgossia,0,Thu Jul 9 19:56:46 2015 UTC,Maybe it will pick up popularity now that trans issues are more in the public eye? And also seriously hoping the movie gets done eventually :( David Fincher or bust!!

Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,NorthwestTreeOctopus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:45:52 2015 UTC,You HAVE to start with phantom blood! It's part 1 of JJBA. If it has this opening. you are watching it correctly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF54qXoqF6k  After that is battle tendency which has my favorite - Joseph Joestar young.  Then go into Stardust Crusaders. All episodes are out so you can binge watch! It's amazing! After star dust crusaders all you got is the manga. so sad.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,DeusExMchna,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:11:02 2015 UTC,Wait but where can I watch them? Are they all on youtube at a goodish quality? Ahh it looks so cool from all the stuff I've seen on tumblr!
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,solarcompany,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:16:14 2015 UTC,"Youtube has a dubbed version. If subs are more your thing, they're all available on Crunchyroll.   Edit: Just kidding- the youtube version is the adaptation, which is... not that great."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,DeusExMchna,2,Fri Jul 10 02:01:18 2015 UTC,Are the dubs good dubs or 4Kids level of dubs?
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,solarcompany,3,Fri Jul 10 02:07:46 2015 UTC,"It takes a lot of doing to be 4Kids level! The version on youtube is an OVA adaption of the manga that was made in the 90's so it's a bit dated compared to the subbed version on Crunchyroll, in addition to being quite different. It starts several volumes into the series (as opposed to the subbed one which starts at the beginning). It's not that bad, but I would watch the subbed version.   (Sorry if I'm being unclear, it's been a while since I've thought about this!)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cmktf,Phonemenon,2,Fri Jul 10 02:18:03 2015 UTC,"The OVA dub is really...well, it's good for a laugh!  If you're just getting into JJBA, I'd definitely recommend starting off with the first part (Phantom Blood), which was adapted in 2012, rather than the more popular and prominent third part (Stardust Crusaders) that gets talked about a lot. They are releasing a dub for the new series -- it was just announced at AX this past weekend -- but it won't be out for a little while, if I recall correctly. Honestly, the original Japanese voice work is really great. It has its OTT moments but they're so good and it matches so well with the overall tone of the series.  Crunchyroll has the entire series subbed right now, but KissAnime also has the entire series subbed in HD, if you'd like an alternative.  Finally, the manga has eight parts total, only three of which have been adapted, and the fourth part hasn't been greenlit yet, so if you find yourself hankering for some more Jojos, there's that too!"

I didn't try her hair oil so I can't comment on that, but I got a six pack of samples (which are HUGE!) for less than $20. I tried her deep treatment, curl cream, a couple curl gels and a flax spray, and I'm really impressed so far! It's pretty cool because you can choose whichever product you want in any scent you want and then customize it with different add-ins like oils and curl enhancers depending on what your hair needs. I love the deep conditioner and the crazy curly gel, they make my hair so light and bouncy and happy. Definitely worth checking out!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm86l,WyldeKat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:28:08 2015 UTC,"Ooh, during the 4th of July sale I ordered the flax/okra gel, deep treatment, and the curl cream (which I added stuff to, though I can't remember what...). I've heard good reviews on the Naturally Curly boards, but tbqh I am biased and find positive IMAM reviews even more convincing. Thanks for the mini review!  How was the TAT? Reports have varied quite a bit on whether it's accurate or not."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm86l,homicidalunicorns,2,Thu Jul 9 03:00:59 2015 UTC,"Well I ordered on June 9th and my order shipped on June 17th, which is pretty good for 6 products that were custom made. I've been meaning to do an in-depth review but haven't gotten around to it yet - glad I could help :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm86l,WyldeKat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:48:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm curious about the sample pack now. Do you find anything greasy at all? How much product do you find yourself using?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm86l,WyldeKat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:27:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely not greasy! I actually added argan oil into most of my samples and I'm wishing that I'd added more! I have shoulder length super thick  frizzy hair and I'm only using a teeny tiny amount.  I've gotten 4 uses out of my deep trwleatment so far and I'm only halfway through, and I haven't even made a dent in my other samples over the last 2 weeks. The samples are massive too, like the same size as some FS products I've bought for $15-20 a piece. I'm definitely going to be ordering again. I'd recommend the deep treatment, curl cream, and crazy curl gel for sure, and the flax spray is a great alternative to hairspray if you don't need the super-hold."

I really like the Crystal Lime Kisses (super fresh limes and sweetness), Coco Beach Baby (peach and coconut), and Ultimate Creme Brulee (homemade vanilla pudding). I didn't like the Verbena and Berries scent, smells like old lady shampoo :(  Coconut Mango and Coconut Nectar are nice too.  I really like coconut...."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cm86l,homicidalunicorns,8,Sat Jul 11 11:45:37 2015 UTC,"Here's me yesterday after applying only Haus of Gloi's hair oil after a shower.  I have 3a, medium-course, medium-high porosity, very, very dense, bra strap length hair, and live in a pretty humid place with high summer dewpoints. So, frizz. All day erryday.  I was worried that the hair oil wasn't doing anything for me, so last shower I used it without any other products post-shower. SHINY LOVELY NO FRIZZ HAIR. The one thing it doesn't do is help with curl definition (as you can see), but I wasn't expecting it to.  That said, I use a lot. This time I used 1.5 droppers full, and easily could have used more without looking greasy or having my hair be weighed down. Other people, however, can't exceed the recommended few drops without turning into Snape. YMMV."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm86l,LILY_LALA,3,Thu Jul 9 02:38:06 2015 UTC,Right?! I can never figure out how four drops are supposed to work.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm86l,homicidalunicorns,2,Thu Jul 9 19:30:11 2015 UTC,Holy crap I love your hair! Looks like it worked really well on you. Do you find it doesn't work as well if you use it after a shampoo?

It's a pretty lightweight hair oil, thankfully.   Its place in my current routine is after a leave in (woo, chronically dry hair) and before a gel (yay definition and hold)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm86l,homicidalunicorns,2,Thu Jul 9 03:36:13 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I've been using HoG hair oil (in Troika, mmmm) with no gel. How do you use gel without it going crispy? Do you use it when damp or dry?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cm86l,StealthyUltralisk,2,Thu Jul 9 18:35:15 2015 UTC,"I only apply a medium hold (so less/no crunch) gel when my hair is soaking wet. That seems to help. While my head is upside down, I squish in just enough to coat my hands. That amount is really just because my current gel can easily be overdone; with others I'd definitely use more. At some point I'm going to experiment with raking it in, but this seems to work really well.  Also, high five for Troika hair oil twins."

The hair oil does a great job of keeping the frizz at bay and my hair generally feels healthier and the ends aren't as dry. I'm less than halfway through my bottle, which I've had for about 8 months. The scent I have (Twice is Nice) isn't super strong, which I appreciate.  I've also tried CocoaPink's anti-frizz, which I really like. Again, I'm not sure how it would work for curly hair, but it's certainly at least as effective as any drugstore products I've tried, and leaves my hair super silky after about 24 hours. My only problem is that the scent (Mango Coconut...or is it Coconut Mango?) can be pretty strong and fills the whole room, but it does dissipate after a while. CocoaPink's new packaging is also so cute..."

Indiemakeupandmore,3ckqki,tortoiseshell0,8,Fri Jul 10 03:00:36 2015 UTC,"First of all, it's true what I've heard about her customer service - flawless. When I placed the order for 15 samples, I totally blanked and forgot to copy the list of what samples I wanted from Notepad to the order comment section. Within an hour she had messaged me and very sweetly asked if I had a list I'd like, or if I wanted her to choose for me. I apologized and gave her my list and all was well.  Not only that, but I ordered Sunday night and got it today, with the addition of two free samples. Basically I'm saying the owner of Alkemia is a wizard.  So far my favorite is Memorium, but I need to let my nose rest until I can dive into the rest. Anyone have any thoughts about the others I ordered? (Hopefully you can make out the names.)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckqki,tippyx,5,Wed Jul 8 17:57:45 2015 UTC,Alkemia is amazing. Complex scents and really fast processing and shipping. Also the shipping cost for 5 samples to canada is super reasonable compared to most other places

Mist Becoming Rain and A Roll in the Hay are two of my very favorite perfumes!   She excels at green/wet scents--if you like Mist Becoming Rain I would suggest trying Moss Maiden (wet green) or Mesnee d'Hellequin (dry green and AMAZING after aging for a few months) or Wilde Swans at Coole (wet green and floral). I'm also guilty of telling everyone to try Antares--it is lovely on it's own but I love layering over all sorts of other smellies.
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckqki,ZeroDagger,3,Wed Jul 8 19:52:46 2015 UTC,She excels at green/wet scents   YES this!!! I just got Sea Goddess (only available at the Soap Box Co) and it is amazing! I wish I had the vocabulary to describe it...
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckqki,crazyradiosquirrel,3,Wed Jul 8 22:18:16 2015 UTC,"I loved Sea Goddess in the bottle, but it was one that did not work at all on me. Straight to sunscreen/powder--same as almost every ocean scent I've tried. There's some note in every one of them that just does not agree with my skin."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckqki,chdeks,2,Wed Jul 8 23:10:28 2015 UTC,"Sea Goddess is my absolute favorite, it smells exactly like incense and wet stone on me. Weird, but I'm in love with the scent... I'm sorry it didn't work well on you:("

Indiemakeupandmore,3ckqki,kstinasunflower,2,Thu Jul 9 01:35:52 2015 UTC,"Alkemia is my favorite indie perfume company! I actually just ordered all of her spring 2015 releases (I believe all of them? I might have to check again :x). I take every opportunity to spout this, but Antares is my holy grail perfume; it smells so high-end and still manages to be a wonderfully comforting scent to me.  The only ones of yours that I've tried are La Sirena and Salome, though I haven't given the latter much of a chance yet. Let me know what you think of La Sirena! It's a very lovely ""blue"" scent that rings as authentic to me, as I'm from a shore area. I've been coveting Vixen and Pumpkin Strumpet too...perhaps next time!"

Even though she wasn't able to access the order information for a couple of days, she STILL sent out my order within the posted TAT. They shipped about four days after the website was hacked. I was just extremely impressed by that (and I'm really enjoying the shadows I got)."

Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,frumperbell,14,Wed Jul 8 17:22:14 2015 UTC,"I don't blame 1692 at all when this shit happens to my orders. I see it camp for a couple days up where she is, then it travels for a couple days to where I am and makes a complete tour of all USPS facilities in my city, then goes out for delivery, wait never mind they got tired, back to USPS, then finally delivers to me.   I could daylight drive to her location and back 15+ times in the amount of time it takes a package to get from her to me, and it's 100% because Texas USPS employees are apathetic shitheads who refuse to do their jobs.   Except for my friend's mom who works hard (and has only criticism for her coworkers' work ethic) and Asian American George Clooney who tries so hard to make up for his coworkers at my branch. But can't, even though he is beautiful and talented, because they are just that bad."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,timsgirlfriend,6,Wed Jul 8 19:09:50 2015 UTC,If you want to you are always more than welcome to arrange a pickup if you're nearby! I sometimes scratch my head when I see packages that are going to destinations that I could literally walk to take 4-5 days to be delivered. How much wasted gas is that? I guess they want us all to feel like we are getting our ~$3 worth out of the shipping charges.
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,vanityclaire,3,Wed Jul 8 19:26:53 2015 UTC,Oooh...I'm in Dallas. I will have to remember this when I end my low buy.

Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,timsgirlfriend,12,Wed Jul 8 21:34:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing! And ugh, yes, this has been such a nightmare. This is FAR from the first time this has happened (March ice storm never 4get), but this is probably the largest group of packages affected, as well as the longest USPS delay I've seen so far (some of these were sitting in ""pre-shipping"" status SIX DAYS after they were mailed). It really grinds my gears that I PAY for tracking (it is part of what we all pay for when we prepurchase shipping labels online) yet apparently USPS ""doesn't have to"" do its job and scan them in, and that's something that I've been told by multiple USPS contacts. The number of people I have talked to about this is staggering (it includes the Postmaster as well as the U.S. Postmaster General's office itself) but guys. They don't care. They just plain don't care, and it's so infuriating. I looked into getting a UPS account, but I refuse to charge you guys $9+ to ship one sample. That just isn't going to happen in this lifetime. I'm so salty about this :|"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,vanityclaire,5,Wed Jul 8 17:59:55 2015 UTC,"So sorry you're dealing with this! And I feel so bad for you for having to call USPS. I had an order go wrong, tried to contact USPS and turns out, for international people, you have to call them at a US number. How the hell does that make sense? I tried telling everyone I got passed on too that I was making an international call and they still put me on hold for ages and gave me non-answers. I'll never call USPS again."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,eraser_dust,7,Thu Jul 9 00:52:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the USPS ""customer service"" center is located in one of the seven circles of Hell. I would seriously not wish a USPS phone call on my worst enemy. I was once on hold for two hours.   And, speaking of international calls....Guess who we US residents have to call when an international shipment goes missing? Yep, USPS. And guess what they tell us? ""Call Canada Post (or Royal Mail)."" And guess what Canada Post/Royal Mail tells us? ""Call USPS."" :| It's like the Twilight Zone."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,vanityclaire,2,Thu Jul 9 01:10:25 2015 UTC,"lol! To be fair, this kind of thing happens frequently enough that I'm always ecstatic when I call customer service and the first person I talk to can fix my issue.  I've once gotten bounced between 3 countries after my checked in luggage got broken into, and the thief stole underwear and my external hard drive. Been 2 years and there's still no resolution, with the airline concluding that they're not at fault even though I had to get a new luggage because the zipper got damaged."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,eraser_dust,2,Thu Jul 9 01:18:02 2015 UTC,I called Amazon once after a major screwup with my order. They were so nice and so helpful that I actually wondered if I'd accidentally called the wrong number and someone was just trolling me. It's sad that good customer service is so rare that it surprises us when it happens :(
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,vanityclaire,5,Thu Jul 9 01:46:27 2015 UTC,"I love Amazon, their customer service is AMAZING. I bought an Ottlite lamp over a year ago from Amazon, right? There's a plastic button which started being a pain to push on and off after a few months, and now I have to really jam it in to turn it on. I checked out Ottlite's site which said their products have a 2 year warranty. Awesome! I emailed them, and they wanted me to cut the power cord and send them a picture, and then pay $9 for them to send me a new one. Wtf kind of warranty is that? I didn't break it, it's defective (lots of people having the same problem) and I use it every day to do my makeup. So I'd have to wait weeks for a new one.   Emailed Amazon, just generally asking if they could do anything, and they refunded me, no questions asked. I got Amazon Prime for the first time this year, too, and it's the best."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,rusrslythatdumb,6,Thu Jul 9 10:45:26 2015 UTC,"One time I dropped off a ton of orders at the post office and instead of scanning them as received, they accidentally scanned them all as delivered :(  So I had a ton of customers freaking out thinking their stuff had been delivered to the wrong place etc. Of course nothing could be tracked after this and USPS just told me to wait it out -_-"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,Marsandtherealgirl,2,Wed Jul 8 22:41:20 2015 UTC,"I've had some issues with our local post office here in Ohio. Just our mail carrier, I think. We ended up making three separate complaints in a month's time before anything happened, and that's probably only because my sweet, patient boyfriend finally got loud. This is such a frustrating thing to have a legitimate complaint and be met with nobody being willing to do their $#&*%($# jobs. I hate that so much. :(  But, on the plus side, I really want to place an order with you now because you're awesome and invested in what you're doing! I'm browsing your site, and I might have just freaked out to see your ""I Saw Goody Proctor With the Devil"" perfume because The Crucible is my absolute favorite play. omg. Spaz. I JUST NEED TO GET PAID."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,girlpeeg,12,Wed Jul 8 20:11:30 2015 UTC,"This shit makes me crazy. I had to learn the hard way (DC Falloween 2014, never forget) that if your package goes missing and was never scanned in at the post office, they won't even open an investigation, they'll just tell you the shipper scammed you. Normally I have a huge amount of sympathy for overworked USPS staff but the comment about not even having to scan in packages really pissed me off. Godspeed Claire :/ I'm crossing my fingers everyone gets their stuff!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,rekhiebaby,3,Wed Jul 8 17:51:52 2015 UTC,Mine did the exact same thing.
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,elephantabate,2,Wed Jul 8 19:15:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for letting us know! I recently had an order sent out and it got scanned this morning, so we will see.  But honestly, I've had the absolute worst package luck for the past month with USPS. It doesn't matter where I order something from-- if it's out of state, it travels across the country and plops into a couple random states for a week or two before it gets to me First-Class. If it's within my state, it just takes forever to move or even gets delivered to someone else's house (in the case of a usb cord I ordered!) I even had a replacement item ""overnighted"" to me and it took four business days within my state! I wish there were another way around this that didn't cost an arm and a leg.  :("
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,StrangeLady,5,Fri Jul 10 04:58:31 2015 UTC,"I was just going to post about my shipping experience! The two times I've ordered from sixteen92, there's been a weird hold up at one of the post offices in Texas that lasts several days. I didn't think about it the first time, but the second time I thought it was really odd that the same thing happened."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,shushbow,7,Wed Jul 8 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"That's so awful :( I really hate this. I just want everyone to get their orders!!!! Arrrrgh. I feel like a broken record talking to USPS (when they actually answer the phone, that is).   Do me a favor (and this goes for everyone affected) -- if you notice a holdup like the one you described (packages sitting at sorting centers and taking multiple days to move what is essentially a few miles down the road) can you guys shoot me a screenshot or send me your tracking number so I can grab one? I am trying to get as much evidence of this as I can, from different dates/batches of orders so that I can....I don't even know yet. Maybe fly to DC and knock on the door of the postmaster General? I'll figure something out, but the more evidence I have of these shenanigans the more ammo I have when and if I do ever get someone to listen to my desperate pleas."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,vanityclaire,4,Wed Jul 8 19:05:30 2015 UTC,"I had a similar problem every time I have ordered (twice), where it just hangs out in Texas for a couple of days.   I'm still waiting on a couple of EDPs I purchased to be shipped but when they do and if the same issue happens again, I will send you screenshots/tracking numbers/etc as well, if you would like.

Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,Flewtea,2,Wed Jul 8 19:17:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah my Sixteen92 order sat for a week before moving at all and now it's been stalled with the last update on July 3! It was supposed to arrive July 6 by USPS's own estimation and it's still not here :_(   It ""departed"" Dallas on July 3. Maybe USPS in TX is especially wack because I've received packages from FL and NYC much quicker than this.  Thanks /u/vanityclaire for letting us know what's going on. This isn't your fault but taking responsibility to do the due diligence to inquire and check on the packages is a great sign that you care about your customers. How frustrating from your operations perspective and for your customer service. I JUST WANT MY ETERNAL RETURN EDP, USPS LET ME HAVE IT."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,lgbtqbbq,4,Wed Jul 8 18:38:34 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely TX USPS being lazy pieces of shit. I've done some swaps via other subreddits recently and you would not believe the speed with which the person sending me stuff gets into Texas. But when I send stuff out from the state? It takes for fucking ever to get where it should be going. And just like Claire, I rarely ever get more than one scan on the damn things.  And USPS still has the fucking gall to whine about how they're always losing money and shit. Gee, I wonder why?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,luminous_delusions,3,Wed Jul 8 21:31:52 2015 UTC,"This is so beyond frustrating, I'm so sorry :( Please believe me that issues like this legitimately keep me up at night. I work really hard to get orders out as quickly as I can, and then to have USPS basically crap all over me and my customers is just unacceptable. It makes ME look like the asshole who ""forgot to mail stuff"" and makes YOU guys have to wait extra long to get your orders. And it sucks.   With very very few exceptions (and those have been due to things like ice storms, holidays, or the day after my dog died :'() when you guys get a shipping confirmation email your packages are either picked up or dropped off the same or next postal business day. This does unfortunately exclude Saturdays, as even though this is technically a postal business day, there are no USPS offices within a 20 mile radius of me that are open on Saturdays. So...yeah. TL;DR I'm sorry and I'm trying to fix it :("
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,vanityclaire,4,Wed Jul 8 19:23:12 2015 UTC,"Hey hey hey please don't be too upset. I commented in a Rant/Rave thread earlier this week and was probably unfair in my judgment- if my order sits in ""pre-shipment"" it looks like you printed and didn't bring to post office, so you understand that is the conclusion that is reached without other info :)  Your products are great, you put a lot of thought and professionalism into your store and service, and USPS is widely known to be a buttface institution.  I've only ever heard raves about your products and service and I remember when you first opened your shop and how impressed I was with the site and products. This is my second order and I'm only bummed I don't have it in my grubby hands yet. First order was fantastic!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,lgbtqbbq,3,Wed Jul 8 19:29:13 2015 UTC,"if my order sits in ""pre-shipment"" it looks like you printed and didn't bring to post office   Yep, this is exactly what it looks like, and you have every right to be annoyed by that. I would be annoyed, too, and this is a big part of the reason I'm so upset by all of this -- hopefully driving orders a few miles away to a different post office in a different zip code will fix things. I'll miss the one nice lady at my post office but I am willing to bet that the problem will remedy itself once I find a post office that understands that things actually need to be scanned in. :|"

Indiemakeupandmore,3ckm7w,lacqueratorie,2,Wed Jul 8 20:47:48 2015 UTC,"It's so weird, for like two weeks (ending early last week) nearly all of my packages were having the same issue - they would only get as far as ""Picked Up"" and then just...nothing. My mail guy is really cool (we've actually become friends! How many times can you say that?!) so I know it wasn't him (he goes out of his way to make two stops at my shop during the busy season - when he's the most busy as well!), but dealing with the USPS when things go wrong is a royal pain.  It's a great service with very competitive rates and the fastest delivery on the good days - on bad days I wouldn't wish a trip to the USPS or a conversation with 1-800-ASK-USPS on my worst enemy."

I've been waiting on an order myself and had to keep telling myself to be patient on the shipping status because of the holiday - sure enough, it finally updated past ""label created"" a week after I received an email with the tracking number. This is my first time ordering from them, but Sixteen92 is also wary enough of the issue to detail this sort of info on their FAQ page as well, so I wasn't as concerned as I might have been, otherwise.

I agree on Salem and I have a half bottle of Funhouse coming (because leather and smoke!). I haven't tried FF yet.  I like:   Solstice Scents Library -  This one is really sexy, but too heavy for summer wear for me. SS Black Leather, Red Lace -  It's a mix of naughty and nice. SS Violet White Leather -   The leather in this one is really soft. Darling Clandestine's Tapadero - It's leather, sage and roses. It's so bright and one of my favourite scents ever. (Inked, Aragon, and Rivet are also good DC leather scents) HoG Ploughman - sexy and clean Sixteen92 Sacre Coeur - incense, wood, and leather Deep Midnight One Enchanted Evening - vanilla and soft leather   I got Smelly Yeti Bee Tsar and Arcana Strawberries Crave Kink, because leather, but I'm letting them age/rest.

I can update you after I give it a real test. It's been too hot here for strong leather. From initial impressions, I think it will be a good one.  The sage is noticeable to me, but it's like it's well blended into the other notes. Leather and roses can be very heavy, but I think the sage lightens/brightens it up."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,lynxpoint,2,Wed Jul 8 19:37:22 2015 UTC,How strong is the sage in it?
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,lynxpoint,3,Wed Jul 8 19:44:02 2015 UTC,"on my skin, it's pretty strong at first, but then mellows out to a fresh, earthy rose and leather, with just hints of sage. i really like it!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,Fluffcats,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:52:43 2015 UTC,"Hm, I may need to try a sample of it before diving in. Sage gets a strong on me and it makes me a little weary. Thanks!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,starward-,2,Wed Jul 8 19:56:01 2015 UTC,"no problem! it is my very first perfume from Darling Clandestine, and it's safe to say i will be ordering more."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,starward-,2,Wed Jul 8 20:03:58 2015 UTC,"I just got Carny Wedding and Mishigami from them two days ago, it was my first order. I really like their scents so far and am more than willing to give some of their other scents a try!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,salapeno,2,Wed Jul 8 20:06:47 2015 UTC,"i've also tried Inked, which is really sultry and sexy, i can see what all the hype is about. my only complaint so far is that they don't last very long on me, maybe 2-3 hours tops. then again, most perfumes don't last all that long on me, unfortunately.   have you had any issues with silage or longevity?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,mallowleaves,2,Wed Jul 8 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"The sample of Carny Wedding I received was a solid and I honestly don't know if that makes a huge difference, but it only lasted about three hours on me. The sillage was  good on both as long as they lasted. I think Mihigami made it at least six hours on me that I know of and held up pretty well. It might not have been the most potent perfume, but it was subtly noticeable."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,salapeno,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:47:59 2015 UTC,Is the sage in Darling Clandestine Tapadero... really sage-y? That was my one reservation with that scent.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,mallowleaves,2,Wed Jul 8 19:43:34 2015 UTC,Not much sage on me at all. It actually smells just like risque haha. But I think risque might be a little more musky on the drydown
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,salapeno,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:28:52 2015 UTC,"I've only tried Risque in PB form, but I love it. I think I really like leather notes, which is weird because I actually don't much care for leather on it's own."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,starward-,6,Thu Jul 9 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"It's from spring, but Haus of Gloi Ploughman is my favourite. It's so springy and earthy and smells like gardening.   Along the same lines, I just got my sample of Alchimia Apothecary's Equestrian Homestead and it totally smells like all the good parts of horse stables (leather, straw, hay, saddle soap, cedar shavings) with none of the horse poop. It is divine."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,cuculine,3,Wed Jul 8 19:20:14 2015 UTC,I would kill for a horse/stable perfume that actually incorporates horse poo tbh
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,starward-,3,Wed Jul 8 23:38:12 2015 UTC,I would too.  I would stay home and huff my wrists and sigh.   And then wash it off before going out because I'm pretty sure no one would understand.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,Sylph_14,2,Thu Jul 9 02:56:13 2015 UTC,I know! I might just spray a pillow with it hahaha. I'm glad someone else understands!

Possets Arrival of the Queen of Sheba - overall a ""furry"" vanilla with suede, but while I do detect the leather/suede, others don't so YMMV.  Possets Bar Sinister - I consider this more green vanilla, but leather is a note  Possets Stewart - Woody musk, but again with the leather note."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,j-dusk,3,Thu Jul 9 05:24:03 2015 UTC,"Madame Scodioli's Sentinel smells like straight up leather and metal to me. I really like the leather note in some of Alkemia's perfumes as well, especially Deadwood and Highwayman."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,weepy,3,Fri Jul 10 03:36:02 2015 UTC,"Arcana Philtres #3 doesn't actually have any leather notes in it, but I definitely get a leather feeling from it. The notes are: Three musks, Haitian vetiver, blackseed oil, nutmeg, molasses extract, grapefruit, apricot, peach, and darkest vanilla.   I don't care for leather scents, but I don't actually mind this one. It almost reminds me of the leather interior of a BMW. Which is weirdly specific in a way that probably won't be helpful, I know, but...  However, there aren't many reviews for it, and none of the reviews I've seen mention it smelling like leather, so ymmv"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,dartigen,3,Wed Jul 8 21:44:30 2015 UTC,Bpal Fighter. Leather and metal. For those days when floral and aldehyde just won't do.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,MageLocusta,2,Thu Jul 9 02:55:22 2015 UTC,"Sixteen92 Sacre Coeur, I don't really like leather otherwise :P The leather in it has definitely mellowed out over time though.  If you really like leather, I'd also recommend DC Rivet."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cl1dq,MageLocusta,2,Wed Jul 8 20:17:34 2015 UTC,"My favorites are Sixteen92 Sacre Coeur (smoke, leather, resins, woods), BPAL Iago (musky smoky leather), and DC Rivet (leather and beeswax, a bit simple for my taste but very nice). I also remember HoG Horseman having a nice oiled leather scent, but it was a bit cologney for my taste. Alkemia Devil's Dandy has a fantastic leather scent, very sexy, and I think they have a leather single note so that might be worth a try."

I love neons, especially green, and  I love holos. The formula is great and lasts really long on my nails.   2: Digital Nails, Highlander/Sassenach duo--ok I cheated. this is two polishes. but its a set. on my favorite fandom and they are GORGEOUS. purple with red shimmer and gold holographic. again, love the formula.   3: ILNP, Music Box--turquoise holo...are you seeing a pattern?   4:ellagee, Gallifrey Falls No More--multichrome, Doctor Who.   5: carpe noctem cosmetics, Taupey Tips--my favorite neutral. and of course, holo."

Indiemakeupandmore,3ckg03,laceandhoney,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:13:55 2015 UTC,On a roll and my polish collection is small lol;;
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckg03,laceandhoney,3,Wed Jul 8 23:01:05 2015 UTC,"I own a TON of indie polishes, but there's a few I find myself coming back to again and again.    Polished by KPT Nightcrawler - KPT is the queen of thermals; nobody does them like her. I have probably over half of her thermals, but this is the one I've used the most. It's many things at once: subtle, sheer, dramatic, duochrome - it's warm state is a shimmering, shifting purple-blue, and it's thermal sensitivity is perfect with my temperature, leaving me often with a gradient resembling ink-stained fingers. Picture Polish Vampire - it took me a while to perfect how to use this, but now that I've figured it out, I've used nearly half the bottle. It is my perfect vamp shade. A deep blood red, and the jelly formula adds depth and dimension that sets it apart, giving it an almost ruby-like quality. I ALWAYS get compliments when I wear it, more than any other polish I own.  A England holos - what can I say that hasn't been said? I don't even have a favorite color. I just fall for A England all over again every time I apply it. I don't know how they get the formula the way they do, possibly dark magic, I don't care. I can often get away with a single coat. I can be rushing out the door, slap it on, and it will come out amazing. Black. Magic. I swear.  Digital Nails Supernova - it's gaudy, it's tacky, it's an explosion of giant in your face sparklefest; I don't care, I will wear it forever and ever. This polish is ridiculous and I love it. I've never encountered a polish as unapologetically GLITTERY and SPARKLY and stars-are-exploding-in-your-face as this polish and Supernova, don't you ever change. You honestly have to try this polish in person. It's a living breathing sparklefest; cameras aren't advanced enough to capture it's unabashed insanity. Hare Polish Bury the Hatchetfish - I've worn this one very rarely, only a couple of times. I just think it's so pretty in the bottle; whenever I'm going through my polish I take it out just to look at it. It has this murky and luminescent thing going on that draws you in. Somewhere out there is a muggy jungle planet just waiting to be discovered by Captain Kirk; it's sky is a sweaty purple, it's plants are exotic and strangely hued, amidst magenta-tinged palms lies a lake and it's waters are Bury the Hatchetfish."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckg03,speaksincolor,2,Wed Jul 8 19:04:01 2015 UTC,"I swear, I tried to get my hands on Bury The Hatchetfish FOREVA before I gave up.  I have Supernova. I HAVE SEEN THE INSANITY.  Have you tried KPT's Mars Escapade? It's GORGE. I love it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckg03,PhyrraNyx,2,Wed Jul 8 19:12:43 2015 UTC,"I actually JUST removed it from my nails last night to apply KPT's Ophelia's Love! Mars Escapade is awesome. I'm not usually a pink polish fan, but the green shimmer makes that polish.   I didn't realize Bury the Hatchetfish was still so hard to get! It was one of the first indie polishes that I had to 'fight' for - the first time I waited for a timed release and snatched it up. If it makes you feel any better, I find Hare Polish's formula to be a bit on the gloopy side, so I end up having thick layers when I use it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckg03,lgbtqbbq,2,Wed Jul 8 19:22:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not much for glittery jellies, so luckily, that saves me from a lot of Hare's stuff."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ckg03,PhyrraNyx,2,Wed Jul 8 19:24:43 2015 UTC,"I just sprung for the crazy shipping costs of a bottle of Glass Coffin + one other from that collection from a UK seller who still had it in stock because it looks so glorious in pictures.  Mine aren't always the same 5, but right now they are:   Pretty Serious Kasimir - Deep warm purple shimmer with flakies. This has a great formula and depth of color. Pretty Serious Khephri's Amulet - emerald with gold shimmer. This one glows, and again has the same glorious formula that I've come to expect from PS. Rainbow Honey Konpeito - adorable, miniscule pastel stars.  Rainbow Honey Tiny Ruby - my favorite red glitter in my collection because it has some holographic and gold glitter scattered in. Pretty Serious The Pink One - Glowy neon pink shimmer. The best neon pink ever."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cky4r,birbvice,7,Wed Jul 8 18:43:13 2015 UTC,"BPAL Coyote! It's one of my favorites simply because it smells so much like my beloved dog, Beau. The warmth of doeskin, dry plains grasses and soft, dusty woods warmed by amber and a downy, gentle coat of deep musk.  Darling Clandestine has My Lady Ser, which smells like a horse stall if you like that kinda thing. For Strange Women Winter Kitty and  Haus of Gloi Snow Wolf are supposed to be reminiscent of snow-covered fur,  though they just smell ""bitter cold"" to me.   I've found scents containing oakmoss remind me a lot of my cats. Black Violet Oakmoss Gown and Sixteen92 The Heart is a Lonely Hunter are good ones. Bonus side effects include kitties following you all over the house and wrapping themselves around your ankles (they go gaga for Sixteen92 Penny Dreadful, as well)."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cky4r,catrocket,3,Thu Jul 9 01:47:14 2015 UTC,"Coyote sounds so comforting!! And omg, I haven't worn perfume near my bird yet...although I'm a bit doubtful she'll care for any of it. It's so cute that your cats like specific scents!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3cky4r,-drbadass-,4,Thu Jul 9 14:53:16 2015 UTC,I would love to find a scent that smelled like my bird. I loved smelling him all the time also and miss the smell terribly.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cky4r,eraser_dust,2,Wed Jul 8 22:23:52 2015 UTC,"Darling Clandestine has a few - Don Gato (GC) is supposed to smell like a cat lying in the sun, Dewlap Valentine (GC) was made in honor of an iguana.    A ""feather"" scent is DC Tyto, which was unfortunately LE.  It's supposed to smell (partly) like owl feathers, and it does give off a musky birdlike impression. I think it's mostly due to the oud in the blend, so maybe looking for that in other scents might help.  I've also seen it pop up a few times in destashes."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cky4r,eraser_dust,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:22:28 2015 UTC,"They all sound great, especially Don Gato. I'm bad with notes so it's good to learn that oud might be a key."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cky4r,-drbadass-,4,Wed Jul 8 22:31:35 2015 UTC,"It depends what oud it is :)  I went on an oud sniffing spree and oud smells can range from truffles (the mushroom), bitter Chinese medicine (it is used for Chinese medicine), to an Arabian palace. The Arabian palace is obviously the perfumer's favourite and it's the one I got Evonne.   If you can get Tyto, it's definitely a great deal. The only reason that scent is so affordable is because my dad's friend is the main supplier for Indonesian oud, so I could get her the oud that typically costs $200+ for 3ml for a fraction of the price. It's still expensive, which is why I was surprised Evonne didn't raise her prices. I don't think she made much money out of Tyto, but she just enjoyed working with oud >.<"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cky4r,lgbtqbbq,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:58:27 2015 UTC,"This is excellent info because to be frank, I have no idea what oud smells like. And that was nice of you, and of Evonne -- Tyto seems to have had a nice journey from start to end!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3cjv93,SirWaffalot,7,Wed Jul 8 14:09:27 2015 UTC,I've never replaced a blush or eyeshadow since I have so many but I'll replace stuff like primers and foundations that I know work well with my skin. Though I did replace my Shiro Doge since my dog ate the first one.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cjv93,stubbytuna,13,Wed Jul 8 14:32:20 2015 UTC,"Your dog ate Doge? Oh man, that's funny. I mean it's sad but I am amused by that...of all the shades to eat..."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cjv93,whoadangjamie,4,Wed Jul 8 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"It depends on how much I loved the color to begin with. I hardly ever repurchase a shadow, mostly because I have too many and don't get through them. It also depends on if you wind up collecting makeup or if you want to only have unique products."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cjv93,lgbtqbbq,2,Wed Jul 8 14:27:09 2015 UTC,"I've never repurchased an eyeshadow because I've never used one up fully. Even MAC Club which is my favorite eyeshadow...I've had and used it for 7-8 years now and it's still not gone. I replace my blush, because I have an HG that works fantastically and is cheap (Wet n Wild Pearlescent Pink.)  I've repurchased the same mascara several times but I don't love it so I'm looking to switch. I buy it because I know what to expect, even if it's not HG.  I sometimes repurchase foundations...but a lot of times my skin needs have changed by the time a new bottle is necessary. For instance, I repurchased Bare Minerals original foundation for about 4 years running, then I switched to MAC Face & Body and repurchased that 3 times, alternating with Chanel Vitalumiere repurchased twice, then I bought UD Naked foundation but by the time I used it up I hated it, so I never repurchased. Sometimes things continue to work, sometimes they don't!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cjv93,AelisAndura,2,Wed Jul 8 15:36:40 2015 UTC,"I like to buy small packages for my makeup when I can so that when it's gone I can try another one.  Sometimes if I'm not really into one though I'll hand it off to my little sister (21 and excellent with eyeshadows) so I can try something new. Not blush though.  I have found my holy grail of blushes and if they ever stop stocking it, you'll find me curled up in a ball in my makeup room."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cjv93,RoseGoldStreak,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:52:35 2015 UTC,"Hi, so I replace primer/foundation as it runs out, I just replaced my mascara after 6 months (that was too long--it had gone off) and for that I got a sample size one because I can't justify buying full size when they really need to be replaced every 3 months. Eyeshadow I hang onto. I just ordered a replacement for my MDMA blush because there was a sale and I will run out within the next month or so (I use it every freaking day)"

I have a sample of Amenti III that I love but it's a bit too light already and I'm going to get tanner as the summer goes on. Since DWH isn't reopening for awhile, I can't get the next shade up so I'm looking for another solution. I'd also be interested in any products I could use to make the shade I have darker."

My best guess is a wax discolouration (if candelilla wax is overheated, it can take on a dark yellow tint- but that won't affect all final products), and dye lot variation is possible, too. But this shade has been out for years, we've only heard of a significant variant issue four times previously, so no telling how many actual problems there have been."

This only happens to my full size ones (BBT and Crystal Violet). It's sometimes better if I store it lying down opposed to standing up. Any tips for mixing it back together?
Indiemakeupandmore,3cjv93,whoadangjamie,2,Wed Jul 8 15:49:56 2015 UTC,I assume they're similar to the OCC lip tars in that you just need to flip it in the opposite way it was before and it'll remix itself. I think it only needs about 5 minutes before it's remixed if you let gravity do the work. Otherwise you can just smush it around to remix the pigments.

Even so, Peaches Crave Vanilla and Peaches Crave Trance are definitely up there.   I plan to do more reviews of other available scents soon. I have some that are long gone, but I figure ones people can actually find are generally more useful."

There are some Arcana scents that I really wish were still around! Did you ever try Skipping Vespers?

Spot on with the pie association for Apples Craves Apples though! That was my feel as well, but the more I sniffed it in the bottle and on my skin, the more I could pick up all the other apple notes in it - I think this one will age incredibly well in a few months.   Nyx and Paws have been my favourites so far along with Strawberries Crave Summer. Paws has immense throw on me though - it punched my sister in a face one morning as I was getting ready and she was in the next room. Eep.  Thank you so much for your reviews :))"

I think the sharpness of Paws is what I like about it actually - the mint might be giving off that effect. Such a shame it didn't work for you!  That's what my sister said re: Apples Craves Apples! She asked if I just got raw apple juice and I was all, ""GURL, NO."" The top note definitely has the lightly spiced pie connection to it, but after time, you can pick up other apple bits to it after a time.

It makes me want to go get a bag of gummy fruit, the ones that are half peach and half that white color and gorge myself."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,jo_maho,13,Wed Jul 8 02:31:44 2015 UTC,"I have fine, thin and sort of oily hair too! Well, oily scalp but dry and colour treated everywhere else.  For indie shampoos, I've tried:   Chagrin Valley Honey Beer & Egg shampoo bar – crazy drying for my hair. My hair feels like plastic immediately. I tried letting my hair get used to it, but after 2 weeks, I gave up. My hair ended up getting oily faster than before, and I'd get oily hair within hours instead of a day. Cocoa Pink's Princess Poo – very gentle but doesn't get rid of my oiliness enough. It's so gentle though, that you can use it without conditioner and your hair will be perfectly fine! It's my HG shampoo when I go diving and need frequent washes. Fortune Cookie Soap's shampoo bar – I liked it at first, but then realized that without an intense conditioner, it makes my hair plasticky. Not as bad as Chagrin Valley's though. Same thing happened when I stopped..my hair got oily faster. Lathers & Lights Olive & Honey shampoo – this is my HG shampoo now. I don't know why, but my hair just loves this. It keeps my hair bouncy and oil free the longest, without drying it out. When I switch shampoos, I noticed my hair doesn't feel as nice. Now I bring a bottle whenever I travel.   For indie conditioners, I've tried.    Black Violet conditioner – about the same level of moisture as a light conditioner (L'Occitane's and most hotel conditioners), so it wasn't moisturizing enough for me. I prefer recommending this  unscented base  with the same exact ingredient list as this conditioner though. It's $5.50 only for 1lbs and you can add whatever scent you like. Chagrin Valley Shampoo Bar: Butter Bar Conditioner – it's supposed to be hair conditioner and natural shampoo combined, but it's just as drying as the normal shampoo bar. My hair couldn't take it. Cocoa Pink Argan Therapy Creme Conditoner – my HG conditioner. It's pretty runny in texture but holy crap it can moisturize. It's as good as my L'Oreal hair masks, only it comes in cooler scents. LOVE. Cocoa Pink Shine Sweetie conditioner – it's as moisturizing as a good conditioner, but not intense enough for me. Way more moisturizing than BV & Moona's though. Fortune Cookie Soap conditioner bar – If you have the patience this is amaaazing. It countered the dryness of the shampoo bar so well, I never noticed how drying that shampoo bar is. I think this may be one of the most moisturizing conditioners ever. Unfortunately, it takes forever to melt enough for you to get the product on your hair, so you have to be really patient. Soaking it in water to soften it up kinda helps get the product on your hair faster, but you do waste a lot of product that way. TMI time, but I normally warm it up by gripping it under my armpit for about 5 min before I take a shower.  Lathers & Lights Brilliantine Cream – not moisturizing at all. My hair ended up drying out with this. Same level of moisture as Moona's, less moisturizing than BV's. Moonalisa's conditioner – not moisturizing at all. My hair ended up drying out with this. Same level of moisture as Moona's, less moisturizing than BV's.   For leave-in conditioners/hair oils:    The Scented Tree hair oil – it's too heavy for my hair and gives me Snape hair, but I fixed it by adding Cyclopentasiloxane as per /u/Dorian_Gray_ advice. It isn't as moisturizing as my usually intense routine, so my hair felt dryer. May work for normal hair.  Cocoa Pink Argan spray – still not as good as my normal routine, but comes closest to it.  Lather & Lights leave-in conditioner – had 0 effect on me. Tried it on my sister who never dyed her hair, had 0 effect too. Also keeps leaving sticky residue everywhere.   Haven't tried indie deodorants so I can't help you there. Hope this helps!  EDIT: Bolding my recommended products  EDIT2: Just remembered another product"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,eraser_dust,2,Wed Jul 8 04:29:09 2015 UTC,"Oh no you didn't like The Scented Tree's hair oil? Argh I love it so much, now I feel bad sorry! How long between washes do you get with L&L's shampoo?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,starward-,2,Wed Jul 8 10:29:11 2015 UTC,"Nooo! Don't feel bad! You're awesome to get it for me! I just have really fine, thin hair so I learnt that most hair oils don't work on me!  For L&L, I can go through 2 days without needing a dry shampoo/washing. It's pretty great since I usually need a wash after a day with most shampoos!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,eraser_dust,2,Wed Jul 8 10:55:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I think our hair is quite different! I'm really interested in trying an indie shampoo but honestly I haven't ordered yet purely because I'm cheap and that international shipping is killer. I'm saving this comment in case I do pull the trigger though!
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,starward-,2,Wed Jul 8 11:17:59 2015 UTC,Looks like I need to decant you some of my shampoos... :P

Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,starward-,2,Wed Jul 8 13:05:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much!! This is amazing! You've done so much work finding your HGs. I will definitely try the Olive & Honey shampoo, and the Cocoa Pink Argan conditioner. I was noticing that Cocoa Pink lets you customize scents for most of their products, do you have any that you'd recommend?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,eraser_dust,3,Wed Jul 8 12:02:06 2015 UTC,"My favourite is Cake on Mondays, which smells like creamy cinnamon. Make sure you don't have any cinnamon allergies though! My friend discovered her cinnamon allergy the hard way and that's how I got my first taste of Cocoa Pink XD  I haven't tried too many Cocoa Pink scents, but here's a quick review of the scents I tried:   White Sugar - This one has that searing artificial sugar scent in it (like Aquolina's Pink Sugar), but the most prominent scent is this delicious strawberry shortcake sort of scent. Country Kitchen - I don't know what happens but this smells really clay-like. You know that clay-like smell of plain oatmeal that doesn't have sugar/syrup/cream/cinnamon added to it? Just plain oats. Not the creamy oats of your imagination but actual oats? Yup. Smells like that. Winter Breakfast - Just chocolate. A rich, milk chocolate instead of those cheap, artificial chocolate powder, but still just chocolate. Can't smell anything other than rich, milk chocolate. Haunted Carnival - This just turns into that overly sweet, burnt caramel popcorn sort of scent. The burnt caramel bit is a bit piercing to me, but one of my friends think it smells great. Apple Popcorn Balls – This is just apple. It's plain artificial green apples. Vanilla on the Rocks - It smells like plain vanilla, only there's a strong waxy smell to it. I'm guessing the waxy smell is the smell of the unscented Soulmate Hair Rescue Treatment though. Just Breathe - There's that cotton-ish smell I associate with baby rooms, only there's florals in this, making it smell like a baby's room after someone just placed a fresh bouquet of flowers inside. Tahitian Monoi Cake - The scent makes my brain confused...it's a floral yellow cake scent, and I'm not sure if I want to eat it or decorate my house with it.  Footprints In The Sand - I got this in linen spray version and it changes a LOT.  In the beginning, it was like gumdrops and liquorice (that tends to smell a bit medicinal to me), with the slightest hint of lemons. After 3 months, I got the coconuts and it smells more like a coconut-lime cocktail. After 6+ months, the lime part got stronger, so now it smells like a beachside lime spritzy cocktail, with some coconut in it.  Violet Kisses – cream and powdery violets. It can smell like a mainstream conditioner for more mature women, but something in it makes me feel nostalgic so I like it.   Hope it helps!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,eraser_dust,3,Wed Jul 8 05:11:32 2015 UTC,"L&L are pretty open about using stock scents for their scents (I don't mind it since their products are made from scratch), so if you want to give the scents a go before committing to a full size, you can easily buy sample amounts for most of the stock scents.   I find that like most stock scents, some scents are great, some scents can go really artificial/smell like mainstream drugstore shampoos. I think a lot of fruit scents would have to be blended with something else to get that realistic fruit magic Arcana does so well."

Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,homicidalunicorns,7,Wed Jul 8 08:34:22 2015 UTC,"CocoaPink makes both shampoo and conditioner. I haven't personally tried them (and my hair is the opposite of yours anyway) but have read excellent reviews, particularly about the Princess Poo (yeah, I know) shampoo.  Lathers n Lights also makes hair products, as does Silk Naturals (to a far lesser extent).  If you have wavy or curly hair (or straight, probably, but they're marketed towards wavy/curly), Sweet Curls Elixirs has received good reviews (though not here). THAT SAID, after looking into it, there are also quite a few complaints of them going well over their TAT.  As for hair stuff that's not shampoo and conditioner:  Hair oils/similar stuff, if you're interested in those: Haus of Gloi's is really popular (and my hair eats it). I know, you have sort of oily hair, but they recommend only using a few drops. Black Phoenix Trading Post (sister to Alchemy Lab) does hair glosses. Theirs has silicones, however, if you're avoiding those.  Hair mists, whatever that entails: Alchemic Muse makes one, Sixteen92 makes two + a hair oil, and Epically Epic also joins the hair mist club."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,rusrslythatdumb,4,Wed Jul 8 03:24:49 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI, Cocoa Pink (finally) renamed Princess Poo. It's now called ShamPink."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,colettecupcake,3,Wed Jul 8 14:59:53 2015 UTC,Awww I thought Princess Poo was a cute name.
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,rusrslythatdumb,2,Wed Jul 8 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"Except it's another word for poop, which isn't what I want to think of while adding my hair. ;)"

Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,surly_elk,2,Wed Jul 8 17:21:57 2015 UTC,"I use Cocoa Pink!  I also have oily hair!  The Cocoa Pink shampoo does have a bit of difficulty with oil.  It really makes your hair nice, but it takes A LOT of product I find to get all the oil out especially near the scalp.  To be fair though, I only actually shampoo my hair every 3-4 days, so there is a lot to get out by the time I am washing.    HoG hair oil is my one true love.  I have so much Zazz oil stockpiled that if the apocalypse happens and hair oil suddenly becomes currency, I will be set for life.  I use it two ways:  as an alternative to gel/product for braids/twists/updo's or in the ends of my hair only in lieu of a conditioner."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,surly_elk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:53:42 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks so much! It seems like Cocoa Pink is pretty popular. Do you have a favorite scent that you use with it? And I'll definitely have to check out the HoG oil - I've been eyeing their pumpkin butters for weeks now, so maybe I'll order an oil too. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,Estridde,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"I'm a ginger fan and I don't tend to like gourmands so my favorite Cocoa Pink scent is Lorelei's Song.  It's a really clean scent, I think, and while a guy wouldn't choose that scent, it's not overwhelmingly feminine either.  I would say it's just slightly on the feminine side of unisex.  It's also rather neutral, so it doesn't clash with anything else I'm wearing.  I also love White Seashells a lot.  It's very summery, and I love grapefruit."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,nekocorner,5,Wed Jul 8 16:09:28 2015 UTC,"Bunny Butt Apothecary has the best deodorant I've used as someone allergic to antiperspirant. Their deodorant is the best working I've found after trying well over a dozen indie and non indie deodorants. It smells great, it doesn't irritate my skin, has a smooth texture, and lasts about 8 hours. It's well worth the price and one of the few products I just can't go without."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,Estridde,6,Wed Jul 8 03:43:41 2015 UTC,"I love this deodorant but do want to note that it uses the same base as Queen Bee, which iirc has it for cheaper. I order mine from Bovine Bubbles but I'm getting to the end of my stash and will probably just order the base and containers and melt some down myself. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,nekocorner,3,Wed Jul 8 06:39:08 2015 UTC,I've gotten Queen Bee (two different times from them) and it hasn't worked as well or the fragrance has been too strong and it actually caused a rash on my skin. I suspect it was the fragrance I was reacting to.
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,AngelsHaveTheTardis,5,Wed Jul 8 15:29:40 2015 UTC,"Aw sorry. :( I have super sensitive skin so I feel your pain. As I said, I'm planning on getting the base and just melting it down myself (with no fragrance because again, sensitive skin) but it's good to know Queen Bee might not work for me in case I get lazy."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,SUBARU17,3,Wed Jul 8 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"Same. Queen Bee deodorant was fine on me for about 6-ish months, and then OMG HORRIBLE RASH.   I'd recommend using it with caution."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,eraser_dust,4,Wed Jul 8 16:41:25 2015 UTC,"Future Primitive Soap's 3 in 1 whipped soap is great as a shampoo. Black Violet's hydra conditioner was my favorite (silicone/dimethicone free), but it was sadly discontinued. Thankfully, Ten Digit Creation has the same formula (albeit in a jar instead of a bottle).  I hear good things about CocoaPink's conditioners as well."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,SUBARU17,3,Wed Jul 8 04:07:39 2015 UTC,"If you like that formula, here's an unscented base that has the same exact formula. You can just add in a scent you like and voilà!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,StarlitDreams,3,Wed Jul 8 16:21:35 2015 UTC,"Indie shampoo wise I think Lathers & Lights and Toadstool Soaps make my favorite shampoos (Lathers & Lights also makes my favorite indie conditioner: Brilliantine Cream.)  In terms of deodorant my current favorite is actually Meow Meow Tweet's Baking Soda Free Deodorant (which has a pleasant--and light--citrus smell) which you may or may not like since it comes in a jar. Good news? It sinks in quickly and definitely does its job (if I manage to sweat with it on, I don't smell at all and I go back to being dry--and scent free--again soon afterwards). Routine Cream is also pretty solid. Live Beautifully makes a great deodorant stick as well."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,greenchipmunk,2,Wed Jul 8 08:04:43 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks! Do you have a favorite scent for your Lathers & Lights products? I think I'm going to give them a try. And I've heard really good things about Meow Meow Tweet! I am trying to get used to the jar packaging with Schmidt's, but I use so many skin care products on my face in the morning that I feel like I'm washing my hands constantly as I'm getting ready as it is. I'm trying to make my routine go a bit faster, but keep using natural/quality products."
Indiemakeupandmore,3ci666,greenchipmunk,3,Wed Jul 8 16:05:07 2015 UTC,"No problem! Sweat Pea is totally my weakness for Lather & Lights scents and Flannel Pajamas is also a pretty good (light) standard.

I tested it out yesterday and so far, it's pretty good. It smells like strong lemongrass and the scent lasts all day without turning into the funky body odor masked by a scent smell.   I also love their soap as a shampoo bar and a body bar. It doesn't strip the oils off my skin at all.   The only other HG hair products that I have are from Cocoa Pink. Their Argan therapy conditioner, Shine + conditioner, and Anti-Frizz Serum are all fantastic. My hair is short, thick, and curly though."

Indiemakeupandmore,3chvh3,Ajevie,6,Wed Jul 8 01:02:14 2015 UTC,I wonder if that's why two bubbling scrubs I had came rock hard. It wasn't super hot where I'm at but it was there. Though they mentioned it might be a quality control issue. Does anyone know if there's a way to fix the bubbling scrub?
Indiemakeupandmore,3chvh3,reallysaucy,5,Wed Jul 8 01:52:15 2015 UTC,I once had a bubbling scrub come so firm that it was difficult to scoop out.  A little bit of hot water in the shower helped to loosen it right up!

This was before I had reformulated my moisturizers to be less susceptible to heat fluctuations, and to ""solve"" the problem in the short term I ended up filling packages with dry ice and warnings all over them saying like ""HEY THIS ISN'T JUST MOISTURIZER THERE'S ALSO DRY ICE IN HERE"" handwritten in sharpie all professional like.  Boy was that a fun couple of months haha.  Kind of unrelated, but I just love the indie community, when something like this happens the brand takes to their FB immediately with a complete explanation and everyone is just so understanding - it's beautiful :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,DuckfatPopcorn,15,Tue Jul 7 16:24:12 2015 UTC,This brand and a few other etsy/insta new store have been accused a lot of repackaging.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,Minkatte,5,Tue Jul 7 23:54:40 2015 UTC,"The cream lipstick that was a cashmere Dupe lacked longevity. I found the same with the highlighters.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,ladycoleopterist,2,Tue Jul 7 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"Oh this is too bad, I've been eyeing her dupes on Instagram :("
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,daisyheartsvw,-18,Tue Jul 7 21:48:03 2015 UTC,"I know from personal experience that she's not very professional in communication, but to put a PSA out saying ""Do not order"" is a pretty big statement to make. Has your friend spoken to the owner? And given them time to respond? Yes half filling a tube is shoddy, but mistakes happen and packages get chucked around by USPS all the time, so I don't think you can blame the mirror on her. All I'm saying is, I think we should be reasonable before we tell people to avoid a company."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,Taynaynay,60,Tue Jul 7 21:38:37 2015 UTC,"The owner responded but hasn't offered a refund or any compensation for the wrong item. My friend started a convo with her on instagram but once she suggested moving it to etsy, the seller stopped communicating altogether."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,singinginthecar,21,Tue Jul 7 17:35:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, completely cut off ties with the customer? That should actually be the biggest red flag to not buy from a company."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,j-dusk,49,Tue Jul 7 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"Every single thing about that order was wrong. I can understand one thing happening, but to send out the wrong color only partly full and leaking and then refuse to offer a refund is not acting in good faith. This is exactly when I want to see this sort of warning.  Implying that she isn't being reasonable is rather insulting.  If you don't find this info helpful, feel free not to read it.  Some of us do."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,Flewtea,-3,Tue Jul 7 20:59:01 2015 UTC,"and then refuse to offer a refund is not acting in good faith.   In all fairness, if I have my timetable right according to what OP said in a comment below, this was posted when they were still in active communication with the shop owner, meaning there hadn't been a refusal of refund or resending yet. Unreasonable? No. Jumping the gun a bit? Arguable."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,olfactorybulb,32,Tue Jul 7 19:20:02 2015 UTC,"Considering the other poor practices, I think she's being quite reasonable. It's not like her saying to avoid it puts some sort of compulsion on you and she's given plenty of evidence for why."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,bratchny,5,Wed Jul 8 15:34:19 2015 UTC,"I'm very glad that OP made this post as it is extremely important information for potential customers to have. Having said that, I too take issue with the wording of the title. The idea of blacklisting a company has caused some contention in the IMAM community and I don't think we should be acting as an authority on what brands should (or should not be, in this case) be ordered from.    There is enough information and evidence in this post to make most people think ""Oh HELL no"" about ordering from GiveMeGlow. If an informed person still wishes to order from them then they should feel free to do so."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,bratchny,5,Tue Jul 7 19:15:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I would change the title to ""ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK"". I was upset at the situation and worded the title incorrectly."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,missmisfit,27,Wed Jul 8 16:03:38 2015 UTC,"It was based on one order but it doesn't make sense to me that it could get messed up this much. She ordered item A. Item B was sent. The item was packaged incorrectly so much that it was under-filled, it leaked, and the mirror broke.   My friend contacted the seller, who was responsive on Instagram, but when she suggested they move the conversation to Etsy where there's more transparency and Etsy can intervene if necessary, there's radio silence on the seller's end. It's not right and this was posted with my friend's permission so that other indie lovers aren't faced with the same issues, should they choose to order.  We've all gotten duds with indie orders. That's par for the course if you can't physically test something in person. But if something were to go wrong with any order from a reputable company, the owners of these companies would try their best to fix the problem, instead of giving excuses or not even bothering with communicating with the end user."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,vidiuk,34,Tue Jul 7 20:12:31 2015 UTC,Why do you feel the OP has to keep justifying their opinions do you? The friend had a really bad experience and they are warning others. People can decide for themselves based on this if they want to buy from this store. End of.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,missmisfit,17,Tue Jul 7 20:17:33 2015 UTC,"Around 9am. It was rapid fire responses on Instagram and then when she mentioned Etsy, she went silent. Still no response and it's 3:30pm Central."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,Taynaynay,-27,Tue Jul 7 22:08:17 2015 UTC,"That is perfectly normal for e-retail. I answer emails within 24 hours (business days only). And have received much slower responses from Ulta, Overstock, and Amazon, all of which have at least a dozen people responding to emails. I don't know this business owner but not even giving her 24 hours before attempting to destroy her livelihood? That's ice cold.   Additionally I see one error and that was that the color was mis-picked. The post office clearly broke it until it was leaking causing stickiness and a decrease in product. What makes you jump to the conclusion that this was all malicious?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,arrpix,33,Tue Jul 7 20:30:30 2015 UTC,"Whoa, wait a minute. I didn't think I was giving the impression that the owner was doing this maliciously. My whole argument here was that in this instance, coupled with the previous discussion that I referenced in my post above, this seller was not as reputable as one might think.   She has over 1,000 feedback since opening in January of this year, which is a red flag to me. She admits to taking photos of other people's products and claiming them as her own. She's been rude to other buyers in previous conversations. I don't feel that she's putting her best foot forward when it comes to being an honest Etsy shop and standing behind the fact that she made a mistake. She doesn't seem to want to own up to her faults.   It just seems a bit odd to me that, when asked to move the conversation to the website in which she sold the product in question, she suddenly stopped talking. Especially since she's posted on her Instagram a few times since then."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,trinaluna,-8,Tue Jul 7 20:44:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't think I was giving the impression that the owner was doing this maliciously.   That's absolutely ridiculous, that is exactly what you have done."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfvuu,missmisfit,6,Tue Jul 7 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"malicious  intending or intended to do harm   How did you get that from my post? Where did I say that the seller purposefully, intentionally, and hatefully did this to my friend's package?  I also did not set out to do this maliciously. I wanted to put the word out that this company is not honest or transparent. A good business is a business that does everything it can for the sake of the customer. This includes shipping the product the customer ordered, packaging the product correctly, owning up to mistakes, and communicating every step of the way.   If a company cannot, and will not, do even one of these things, this is not a company that I will do business with. I presented evidence, and it's up to the readers of IMAM to form their own judgments based on what's been presented.  If I could, I would change the title to ""ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK"" but I was upset about what happened to my friend and worded it incorrectly."

Indiemakeupandmore,3chjt0,i_am_a_cyborg,3,Tue Jul 7 23:48:44 2015 UTC,"Cygnus is really lovely, but you have to like rose.

Arcana's honey notes really vary for me. Love Her, Love Her, Love Her is wonderful in the bottle, but the honey is not good on my skin, and it makes me sad."

I need to give it a full day test insted of a couple of hours on the arm, but after those couple of hours it was still quite present. Lower sillage overall, or maybe it's that it somehow comes across neutral, scent-wise, instead of announcing its presence? It wears closer to the skin on me."

You may find more reviews if you search for Sassy Minerals instead of Lauress!  $7-10 is a normal non-sale price for indie blushes IMO. Not sure if Lauress ones are bigger which is why they're pricier, you'd have to do a gram per dollar comparison. I do remember that they come in those lovely short, wide jars though. Great for swirling a blush brush in the lid."

Here's my impression of the things I've tried from the Elemental Collection:   Agua Thoughts: I smell creamy vanilla, lavender, and chamomile with a slightest touch of berry...?! It's sweetly herbal but not pungent or medicinal. Tierra Thoughts: Creamy sweet vanilla (it's mouthwatering), light touch of cedarwood and juniper, and vetiver. I don't get patchouli. Slightly woody but not a dark, damp, smoky wood. There's no vanilla in here, so I think it's coming from labdanum. It's very elegant and beautiful. Viento: I smell vanilla in here and it's yummy! I think it's the benzoin, which also smells like vanilla to me. I also smell clary sage, a touch of lemon grass, slightly slightly woody and fruity undertone. It's the hardest to describe."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,nekocorner,17,Tue Jul 7 19:59:47 2015 UTC,"Agree. I think most of us have our preferences when it comes to specific types of products. Maybe some of us love color for eyes, but couldn't care less about lipstick. Others stay neutral for eyes, but have an overwhelming urge to collect ALLTHEBLUELIPSTICKS! Personally, I almost never use nail polish, stay away from all colored eyeshadow (except taupe duochromes, because taupe), have about 5 lipsticks.... But I have a bit of a hoarding problem with perfumes. Seriously, if I could afford to not destash, I'd have about 200 and counting.   Scent is my thing, and I'd be somewhere between amused and annoyed if my partner tried to tell me I should like XYZ more so my interests were more balanced. Amused because at least you care enough to learn about it, annoyed because it isn't your body to put makeup on."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,blueskiesandsun,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:14:24 2015 UTC,"I just thought she might like indie scents and indie 'X' and I don't know anything about it. How the did I annoy you? (and it would seem, every other poster.)   edit: however I'd be curious to know what indie perfumes are cool, but, hell."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,blueskiesandsun,13,Tue Jul 7 20:29:43 2015 UTC,"You didn't annoy me, but I would be annoyed if my SO was in your place. That's just me. I understand what you're trying to do, and it's sweet in a way, but cosmetics and scent are so subjective, it's comparable to you directing what type of clothes she wears.   Maybe, if you want to help her expand her hobbies, suggest you guys try geocacheing or hiking or wine tasting or something together. That way it's less you managing her personal hobby and more experiencing/discovering new hobbies together?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,nekocorner,23,Tue Jul 7 20:45:07 2015 UTC,"Gosh, I haven't really spent a lot of time thinking about why I wanted to get my wife into other kinds of makeup. I just thought it'd be more stuff she likes. What she is 'allowed' to do never entered my thoughts.   I'm just looking to turn her on to some new things she might like. I don't consider myself interested in makeup per-se. I just thought it'd be a natural extension of things my wife likes and so I lurked here to see if there are any common products/lines/things. I buy polish for my wife all the time-she prefers them to flowers. However, I was hoping to surprise her with new stuff, a new passion.  I've at times had other people get me into things I wouldn't have discovered/thought I liked otherwise.  I guess I'll know if my post gets downvoted whether I'm completely off base."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,surly_elk,12,Tue Jul 7 20:14:49 2015 UTC,"I don't even mind the number- it's the ratio that's off. I'm really trying to get her into other make up. Trying to get her into other colors and stuff. Yeah, I buy things I think would look good on her, but so far, abject failure.   So I think what a lot of people (including me) are responding to is this part of your post. You've already bought her stuff you thought she might like, but she's either expressed no interest, or a negative response. At this point, it seems pretty clear that nail polish is her thing & she's actually not that interested in other forms of cosmetics. Even though those hobbies might seem related, that doesn't mean they actually are - I, for example, haven't painted my nails in about a year, whilst my eyeshadow and lipstick stash is overflowing.  Since you're into fountain pens (and I am too), I'll give you an example that might be better understood by you. I really, really love gold-nibbed fountain pens. I like the flex, I love the variety of FP inks I can buy, I love how they feel in my hand compared to cheap ballpens. But I've tried probably half a dozen steel-nibbed fountain pens at this point & hate them all. They're both fountain pens, right? But the steel nibs are much harder than gold nibs, they're scratchy, they don't flex enough to offer a good feel when writing. I've given them a really good shot but I hate them. Some people prefer flex or semi-flex nibs, some people prefer harder nibs. Some people prefer stubs, some prefer EF. & to an outsider, they all just look like fountain pens. It's sorta like that."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,surly_elk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:05:18 2015 UTC,"I don't get the analogy- I mean, who likes steel nibs after you've had a gold nib?  d-;  Yeah- overall I get it. But, to borrow another posters analogy- you wouldn't be offended if your SO bought you a brush pen? a dip pen? Went to another forum and inquired about buying you stationary? Anyway, it's all good. My wife already laughed at my post here. Anyways it's nice to hear from a fountain pen addict."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,princesstelephone,11,Tue Jul 7 21:29:59 2015 UTC,"Cosmetics are a tricky area when it comes to new things.  Liking bold nail polish isn't the same as liking bold eye shadow.  Also, it can be offensive to receive them as gifts without a professed interest.  For example, if my SO got me nail polish (I paint my nails every now and again, but it's not my thing), I'd wonder if he was trying to suggest something to me about the state of my nails.  Getting someone new make up when they didn't ask for it can be seen as an insult to their current make up.  Also, in my experience, people who do not wear make up can be really terrible at selecting make up for others.  If you're not into make up, you'll probably just grab the colors you think are cool.  Well, that doesn't take into account skin undertones/tones, personal style, lifestyle, etc.  Bold lips are really nice, but you may not get a lot of wear out of a green lip if you work in a formal office, for example.    Basically, getting someone make up when you don't like make up and they don't like make up is a really tricky situation.  It's not one I would recommend, personally."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,Dorian_Gray_,9,Tue Jul 7 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"Noted, and thank you for the very kind tone. (Tone, lol, see what i did there? ;-) Yeah- to be honest I know the skin/tone/undertone thing is a thing, and no- I don't know how it works, at all.   Honest, I like her makeup addiction (niche tho it be) I thought I was going to surprise her with a bunch of new stuff and she'd be happy and stuff. No, I didn't think I'd be offending or insulting her.   Yeah. I'm going to show my wife this whole post. She will enjoy laughing at me. So, I got that going for me."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,i_am_a_cyborg,5,Tue Jul 7 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"Anytime!  Also, keep in mind that she may need certain tools to use certain products.  Duochromes and glittery eyeshadows are amazing, but without a sticky base, they don't really work as well.  I love loose shadow, but I think it can require a more extensive brush collection to manipulate well.  Loose blush can be hard as well, and many people recommend using a stippling brush (especially for Fyrinnae blushes).  Just throwing this out there, because if she doesn't own a lot of makeup, I doubt she owns a wide assortment of tools :)  There have been several products that I have HATED until someone told me I just didn't have the right tool for it/was applying it wrong.  Tools can make or break whether you like a product sometimes!  Personally, I think pressed mattes are the most forgiving, then loose mattes, then satin finish, then glitter shades, and finally I think duochromes are the hardest to master (mainly because they require both strong eyeshadow and sticky base technique).  But that's by no means scientific.  I might just suck at duochromes."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,nekocorner,4,Tue Jul 7 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"Huh, tools. I never thought about that. Or, rather I have, but thought it's so specific I'd never buy her the right kind of brush/whatev. Strong eyeshadow and sticky base . . . see that's interesting. I think she'd like learning new techniques. She knows all kinds for nails, I don't know if she does for . . blushes? sticky base technique? I'll ask her. Thank you."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,nekocorner,4,Wed Jul 8 00:03:25 2015 UTC,"Was wondering the same thing. As a subscriber to /r/makeuprehab, I would give anything to feel the way your wife feels about makeup, and probably have $10k more in the bank."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,-drbadass-,7,Tue Jul 7 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"I like my wife's hobbies. I'd rather blow money on her makeup. I was looking for things she might like if she knew about it. Trying to surprise my wife. Somehow, I now feel like an asshole."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,-drbadass-,19,Tue Jul 7 20:27:54 2015 UTC,"No need to feel like an asshole - your intentions are good, but perhaps either approach or phrasing was off. You're trying to encourage your wife to expand to more things she may like. However, she may also have no interest. If you come across as, ""I want my wife to like makeup because I want her to wear more"", that will be perceived as domineering. I could try to get my hypothetical boyfriend to wear suits more, but buying him a gift certificate to a nice clothier would probably have better results than buying a set for him or outright saying he needs to wear them more just because I like them (speaking of which, most indie cosmetic companies have GCs, a couple of those wouldn't hurt and she could just pick out a few things, and if there's no further interest, then you know).  Alas, I think we of the XY realm have a bit of built-in difficulty when it comes to shopping for others. She's pretty fortunate to have someone supporting her interests, though!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,Sigh_No_More,3,Tue Jul 7 21:36:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Also, I only just noticed your flair. Several people have recommended your products, congratulations on your own business. :-) Pity your website is down atm, but it looks like the kind of thing I'd like to surprise her with. Underground indie stuff.  My wife wears suits, and makeup beyond nail polish. I just banged out my OP as it came to mind. Phrasing. Ah well. And sure, I admit I'd like to see her in more colors and stuff. It's not that she doesn't like it. We'll go to Sephora's or Macy's and she'll let the makeup people do 'wild' kind of clubby/modely/couteur kinda things. (admittedly at my prompting) and invariably I buy a few things for her. She says she likes it. I'm not even trying to curtail her polish habit, I wanted to get her hooked on new stuff. (and win some kisses/credit.) Anyways- cheers. PS- hi-five for the Oscar Wilde reference."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,toxidlotus,18,Wed Jul 8 01:29:28 2015 UTC,"This is a really weird request. I mean, if she's not really interested in other types of makeup, that's her choice and she seems to be comfortable with that. There's no obligation among people who like makeup to have balanced collections, or examples of every type of product.   I mean, even on this sub and /r/makeupaddiction, people have certain types of products that they like more than others and will have more of those. For example, some people really like perfumes, or lipsticks, or some people like to collect blushes. No one really looks at their collection and realizes, ""Oh I bought 4 new blushes, better buy some lipsticks to balance out my collection"".    It would be like if your wife posted for help saying ""My husband really likes pens, but I want him to have nice pencils and markers too. He doesn't really seem interested at all, how can I get him to change his mind? I've tried before with some stuff that I've bought him, but he wasn't interested. Are there any really awesome pencils and markers that everyone likes?""    I'm not trying to be rude or combative, just trying to make sure I'm explaining myself.  There's nothing wrong with her interests or collection, and anyway, there aren't really any ""miracle products"" that would create interest that isn't there at all.  edit: after reading your reply to another comment, I think what you're asking is what else someone who likes nail polish would be into, rather than having a ""balanced"" collection. There's definitely lots of options for samples from indie companies, but we'd need some more info, like if your wife actually has a preference for other products or colors."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,toxidlotus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:16:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you, you were very polite and kind. I'm seeing the error of my ways. My wife is a non-redditor, but she is now reading this whole debacle (I sent it to her) and yes yes, my wife agrees with you all, and yes, she is laughing out loud at me.  For what it's worth, I wouldn't be offended at your marker/pencil analogy even if I didn't like them. (now, if she bought me some brush pens- I always wanted to try those.)  Sorry- your kinder view of me is incorrect, I wasn't trying to 'balance' her collection like colors or anything, although I did use that analogy. I just thought I'd turn her on to a new passion, and I failed to appreciate how niche you all seem to be. I read about the people who like scents VS eye shadow VS lipstick etc. got it. I'm quitting now."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,ravensashes,8,Tue Jul 7 21:05:01 2015 UTC,"Don't be too hard on yourself - it sounds like you felt you were getting her nail polish all the time and you wanted to switch it up a little, and maybe she didn't get interested in other things because you didn't know what to pick. But she seems to be ok with how things are, and that's ok, and you seem to be supportive of that too."

This is kind of where the analogy breaks down, I think. While makeup is definitely a hobby/passion/art form for many people, it is also tied to appearance and self-esteem (especially for those who aren't passionate about it). There's a long history of women being told/shown that they need to wear makeup in order to be attractive.  By buying somebody a bunch of makeup that they aren't interested in, it can come off as seeming like you don't like how they present themselves or you don't think they look good.  I'm DEFINITELY not saying that's what I believe you think (because it seems very clear to me that's not the case), but I'm just trying to explain why it can come off as kind of offensive to some people, where other hobbies wouldn't."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,ichikoa,5,Wed Jul 8 01:55:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, this.   they need to wear makeup in order to be attractive   But also in order to be considered professional, find employment, etc., and women who wear makeup frequently face judgement for a variety of reasons as well."

But there is no beer you could give me to make me get ""into"" beer.  It's great and all, but it's not my jam.  There are a lot of great products out there.  Blackbird Cosmetics' pressed matte shadows are currently my favorite thing and very accessible.  Rapunzel Had Extensions by Fyrinnae is something I think everyone should own.  Fyrinnae has a wide variety of bold shades as well, and their formulation is great.  However, none of them are going to get your wife interested in makeup if it's just not her thing.    I have 80 million eyeshadows and about 10 nail polishes.  I'll try a new polish if something really catches my eye on here, but I'm probably never going to be as into it as I am with makeup.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,considerthelilies,2,Wed Jul 8 00:00:50 2015 UTC,She should check out Lorraine Loots' work! Super tiny artwork she might be interested in.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,ichikoa,3,Wed Jul 8 00:27:34 2015 UTC,"Her nail art looks awesome!   Like others have said, we all kind of have our specific interests. It's like, some one is a movie buff, but they prefer a specific genre of movie. Some people are all about the ""slice of life"", while others are all about ""drama"" or ""mystery"" or ""Horror"". You're wife sounds specifically interested in nails.  If she likes limecrime (drama aside),  I would suggest Fyrinnae for eyeshadows. They have a lot of very beautiful complex bright eyeshadows (don't forget to snag pixie epoxy! it really helps the eyeshadow stick!). I believe Fyrinnae is Vegan just like Limecrime ""claims"" to be. Fyrinnae has a ""wait time"" of a billion years on their site, when it is up, as they are often ""down"" while they are madly trying to fill out orders. However the wait time is never as long as they say it is. I usually get a shipping notice within 3-5 days and since I live across the country I usually have my package within 5 days of the shipping notice. Location OR If You are looking for lipsticks. (and I am quite the cheerleader for this company...so this is completely bias) I suggest Limnit. Limnit it Vegan and has 19 colors of lipstick. From very everyday to very bold, bright, and surprisingly wearable colors, which means even a yellow lipstick can look oddly good. She is on etsy and her shipping is excellent and quick. My shipping experience with her has been 48 hours she ships and I get my package within two shipping days (I am only a state away from her). Location VA Aromaliegh, I cannot vouch for all of her products, but I can for her satin eyeshadow formulas. I will say she makes really ""wearable"" shades, meaning they can fit a lot of skin tones. She also fills out orders really fast. I had my package within a week of ordering. Location SC Darling Girl Cosmetics, Again I can only really vouch for a handful of eyeshadows colors. I really really like her stuff. My absolute favorite colors are Fairy Floss (might depend on skin color) and My little pony, both excellent formulas. However the down side to Darling Girl is that the wait time is real. I have waited as long as 3-4 weeks to get an order, she is the only one fulfilling the orders so it can take a while.  location TX Femme Fatale is a great company, Though I only purchased a few eye shadows from them, and the only one I liked so far was Candied Apple (which is like their mascot shade). It can take a while to get an order from them since they are located in Australia. I still got my order within 2 weeks. Also they have beautiful nail polish :D   I wish I could do nail art, but my nails fall apart at the mere suggestion of polish (crack, peal, dry out, ect) and i've literally tried everything.

I never wore it before 3 years ago. But I got a lot of advice and encouragement and that made all the difference.   I didn't read your post as you trying to force your partner into things you want but more like you paying attention to her interests already and wanting to provide encouragement in other aspects since she clearly already owns  ALL TEH NAIL POLISH. Which means you have a very small chance of buying her one she doesn't already own.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgq7k,SUBARU17,3,Wed Jul 8 00:53:23 2015 UTC,"It's nice that you want her to try new things but yeah, I'd feel either bad or confused if my boyfriend really wanted to get me into hair products because I like makeup. Bad because I'd think he hated my hair, confused because if he likes my hair I'd have nooo idea why he was trying so hard if it isn't something he likes and not something I've shown much interest towards. Does that make sense? Like people trying to get you into music they like makes sense, since they like it. But if it was music they knew nothing about and we're trying super hard to make you get into it, I'm sure you would be super confused, haha.   But I get your idea, you know polish is something she loves but she has so much of it. You want to keep getting her things she loves, but she has so much of what you know she loves you want to get her into something different so you can get her new things she loves. That's how I read into it. It's a pretty cute thought to me. Is she into any fandoms? There are themed collections if you would want to get her some makeup involving something you know she loves, like eyeshadow that is legend of zelda themed or tinted lip balm that is Miyazaki themed. Then you can see if the makeup brings her joy without it being entirely out of left field, since it is themed on something she likes!"

Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,agrumes,5,Tue Jul 7 21:28:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I realised I made a big mistake getting my glosses unsecured. The metallic smell of the pigment is really strong and gross. I find it doesn't last long upon application though and I think I've gotten used to it I over time.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,zebratwat,11,Tue Jul 7 16:20:31 2015 UTC,unsecured   Unsecured glosses haha

Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,CeeCee221b,6,Tue Jul 7 18:16:13 2015 UTC,Typing on phones is painfully frustrating lol. From now on I'm only buying secured products :p
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,zebratwat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:33:01 2015 UTC,It's the only way to ensure that they don't get stolen en route to you!
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,whoadangjamie,7,Tue Jul 7 16:34:36 2015 UTC,"You're smelling the pigments, which sadly can be quite unpleasant for some people.  My custom glosses are all unscented but one and just smell kind of metallic to me with a hint of cocoa. You can maybe add in a flavoring oil, but those tend to mess with the opacity of the gloss. Many people have experienced that, myself included. My custom opaque Starlord gloss for instance, is barely moderate in opacity  with it's flavoring while I've definitely seen other's with the same color but no flavor be far more opaque."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,luminous_delusions,3,Tue Jul 7 18:22:49 2015 UTC,"The unscented glosses definitely have a strong scent to them, though I wouldn't characterise it as blood or stale cocoa. Mine smell quite plasticky."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,nekocorner,2,Tue Jul 7 15:59:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know about a sour scent, but my unscented Seven Minutes In Kevin has a faint smell of cocoa butter (but kind of plasticky). Maybe contact Shiro and see if it's gone bad or something?  I don't know if there's much you can do - there are places where you can get lip-safe flavorings online, but adding it to the gloss now could ruin the opacity (plus the recommended amount would be absolutely tiny for a single lipgloss).   If you haven't used it much (or at all) and haven't had it for long, you might have some luck destashing it so you can get one that is flavored."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,dartigen,2,Tue Jul 7 16:03:52 2015 UTC,My unscented gloss - Women's Weapons - smells like tires. It's nasty.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,adragonisnoslave,3,Tue Jul 7 16:19:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately I was very disappointed that the unscented actually isn't unscented at all. It's very stale cocoa for me, too. And I hate cocoa, so my one unscented gloss gets no love."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,beautifulmess7,6,Tue Jul 7 16:57:47 2015 UTC,"When I first purchased my custom gloss, I opted for unscented with the belief that it wouldn't smell or taste like anything, too, which was alright by me. But it absolutely has a musty, unappetizing scent. Unfortunately, there's nothing anyone can do about the scent of the ingredients--except adding flavoring oil. It's a lose-lose, man."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,clever-nom-de-guerre,2,Tue Jul 7 18:20:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. I know better for the future. I just wish the listing was really clear that unscented is really cocoa butter, metal, and pigment scent."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,beautifulmess7,0,Tue Jul 7 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"Ha. Not a Shiro gloss, but this just happened with my HoG Hair Oil."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,LILY_LALA,8,Tue Jul 7 18:43:03 2015 UTC,"""Unscented"" in this case just means that no ingredients to add a scent were added, not that it would literally have no scent at all..."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,SpinelessLaugh,3,Tue Jul 7 20:58:08 2015 UTC,She really should clarify though. Reading through this thread there are a bunch of people who bought custom glosses that smelled horribly. The custom glosses are expensive and I think not only should there be disclaimers for shadows that will produce smelly glosses there should also be a big disclaimer that adding scents messes with the opacity of glosses.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,brebrehayy,2,Wed Jul 8 04:01:40 2015 UTC,"I've ordered a couple with past orders, tried different flavours, etc, and they all smell awful. I literally never have worn them again because it's THAT stinky and gross. :/"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,Neonatalnerd,4,Wed Jul 8 17:24:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it smells awful. The actual scent should be noted somewhere."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,beautifulmess7,2,Tue Jul 7 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"My unscented Shiros do smell pretty chemically, but I don't smell them once I'm wearing them."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,cocytusg,2,Tue Jul 7 16:44:17 2015 UTC,Team Rocket is my all time fave Shiro eyeshadow!  Would love to see a swatch of your gloss!!    You might be able to add a little bit of Stevia *sugar replacement * to it.  Test a little out on your hand before adding it to your tube.    OR  Just go the easy route and contact Caitlin ;)
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,smearedgoth,2,Tue Jul 7 16:44:25 2015 UTC,"Seconding others experiences with a plasticky, stale, clay-like scent from the unscented glosses. You may just be sensitive to the smell. If you contact Cailtlin, she will likely refund or replace, but if you get another gloss, opt for a scent. I chose unscented because I'm not fond of the artificial, sweet scents she offers or the flavoring diluting the color...which means I'm SOL. Another option is to add a flavoring oil to it, though that would require going out of your way, or destashing it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,clever-nom-de-guerre,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:13:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe the scent used went bad? Try contacting Shiro, I've heard they can be pretty understanding about that kinda thing."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,Squaresotron,-1,Tue Jul 7 15:48:41 2015 UTC,"It didn't. As other commenters have said, the iron oxides in the particular shade tend to give the gloss that smell. I have a custom gloss in Steve O'Lantern that is the same way."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,kazaanabanana,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:02:58 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, okay.   I feel like I should mention that when I read this post there were none of those comments that you mentioned."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,Squaresotron,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:24:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for posting this! I was considering ordering with no Scent since I heard they can effect opacity, but I won't do dried blood lol."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,Crystalzi,2,Wed Jul 8 02:17:03 2015 UTC,"If you're thinking of re-ordering - I've heard that the mint scent can mess with opacity. The strongest one I've tried is Pink Frosting or the scent that was used in Blood of My Enemies (both of them can easily be smelled by people in the front seat of a car if I open it while sitting in the back) so either of those should be strong enough to cover up the oxide smell.   Be careful with cinnamon oil - cinnamon scents and flavorings are notorious for causing allergic reactions, especially on sensitive areas like the lips."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfp3r,dartigen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:14:19 2015 UTC,"That's just unfortunately one of the ingredients in the color. I can't remember which one it is off the top of my head, but Caitlin specifically mentioned it once."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cg0xa,adragonisnoslave,6,Tue Jul 7 16:59:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I ordered from them a little while back and had a very positive experience. I ordered two lip elixirs and a glitter, and got a sample glitter for free.  The glitters are awesome. Bright, esy to apply, they didn't migrate on my face, and were easy to remove. Can't really ask for more!  The lip elixirs are really opaque, but didn't last long if I ate or drank anything, so you'd need to carry them with you. They also have a plasticky kind of smell, so if you're sensitive to that kind of thing, I wouldn't recommend them.  Overall, I had a great experience! If you're nervous about colors, search Instagram for the glitter elixirs hashtag. There are a ton of reviews from random people who have ordered."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cg0xa,Absinthe42,2,Tue Jul 7 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the feedback and kind words! As for the smell, some people didn't like the peppermint so I toned it down quite a bit, but I personally prefer the stronger peppermint. So I'm kind of at an impasse. I may do a poll to see the preferred smell/taste of lip products. I believe the hemp oil is the culprit of the somewhat plastic smell you are experiencing."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cg0xa,Minkatte,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:54:25 2015 UTC,"I love the peppermint! But I like when lip products tingle, so I get why other people may not like it.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cg0xa,Minkatte,3,Wed Jul 8 09:44:37 2015 UTC,"Heya! Owner here! honestly I have no idea how to use photoshop, and all swatches are done individually and taken with my nikon d3200 and amazon ring light. I'm actually really flattered that you think they look photoshopped, I really try to put time into having a correct swatch for every product I sell, so I feel like that means I'm not doing too badly!   As for ingredients, all lip elixirs are hand made so I do like to think there's love in every one.. I am deeply sorry if that makes you uncomfortable, but everything else you see in my ingredients list is exactly what goes in to them :) no weird hidden ingredients. Although I have debated with the idea of adding a preservative (I know oil products don't need them by themselves, but just in case little bits of water or food gets transferred to the doe foot during application) but am not sure how people would react to it. I will probably be taking a poll on instagram to see how everyone feels about it first."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cg0xa,Minkatte,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:49:56 2015 UTC,"Weird... I'm sorry, I could have sworn that I saw a picture on your instagram that said it was a concept pic and it looked identical to the swatches on your website. I must have misunderstood, or maybe it wasn't yours? That is my bad, sorry. Probably what I get for drinking and IGing ;)   Personally, I'm not a fan - but I understand. Thanks for the clarification!"

For using shadows as liner, loose, because it's easier to mix with PE or whatever I'm using."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cgbik,ananananaaaaa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:45:25 2015 UTC,Glitter glue? Is it s glittery primer?
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgbik,nekocorner,3,Tue Jul 7 20:40:20 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's a glue (sorta like a primer, but thicker) that you apply thinly on your lids when you want an eyeshadow to stand out (especially if it's glittery, because it holds everything quite well).   If you have a duochrome eyeshadow that you apply over bare skin or regular eye primer and you think ""meh, this duochrome sure seemed more vivid on the website"", then it will probably look that vivid over pixie epoxy.  It's a pretty cool product, but it has a learning curve. It's very hard to blend edges, and it takes a few tries to understand how little it's needed.   I'm kinda rambling, let me check if I find a blog post or something on reddit that can explain this with pictures and pretty things :)  EDIT: Check this post by IndieKnow and this by Phyrra. They explain how glitter glue works and show how to apply it ;)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgbik,sunzilla,3,Tue Jul 7 20:56:51 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer pressed or fully loose shadows because I think I get more control that way. I have to break up the clumps in Fyrinnae's newest formula with a brush, which means I get too much product on the brush, and it applies fully opaque, so I don't get to play around with texture quite as much - I tend to like to start soft and build up colour where I want it, and I can't quite get that effect with Fyrinnae's shadows anymore. Having said that, I still love their shadows & colours & use them ALL THE TIME, I just have to use them in a way that suits the formula. :P  Fyrinnae's pressed shadows were FANTASTIC & I really hope they bring them back... someday."

Pressed eyeshadows are much easier to work with when you're travelling, but I find it hard to get an even and thin coat on my brush without wasting too much product when I tap the excess. stares at my 3 year old Naked palette    I like fully loose pigments, but I find that I need a sticky base for these for the most part, especially on the duochromes. If not, then I end up with a patchy base and tons of micro-glitter."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgbik,LILY_LALA,2,Tue Jul 7 19:06:37 2015 UTC,I prefer pressed since it travels well. I would prefer loose if they would magically not fly and spill everywhere. I know it's not possible from the law of physics though.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cgbik,lgbtqbbq,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:38:06 2015 UTC,Less is more.  You are likely losing a lot of product because you're using too much.  I take a little onto the brush and bring it to the cap of the jar or a mixing palette something non-stick and tap my brush out.  The key is also to press the loose shadow into your eyelids and not sweeping it on like you would a pressed shadow.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgbik,whereismydragon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:47:43 2015 UTC,For mattes I prefer pressed (also cuz I tend to travel with them) but for everything else I prefer loose. I find it's easier to pack on shadow in loose form.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cgbik,kstinasunflower,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"Semi-loose because it tends to give more pigmentation than loose. Pressed is most preferred- it's easier to travel with and mix colors, something that is difficult to quickly do with loose without accidentally mixing one color into another's jar. You could tap each powder onto a clean surface to mix, but I am lazy when it comes to makeup."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cgbik,rekhiebaby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:37:04 2015 UTC,I prefer pressed. I have a lot of loose but I never take them anywhere. My makeup bag lives in my car so it gets jostled around a ton and I've had too many bad experiences with the jars loosening and leaking powder.  I wish I could buy Blackbird pressed shadows but I bought them in the original loose formula and it would be so dumb to have them both in my collection when I only wear eyeshadow maybe 10% of the time.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cgbik,chocolatebundtcake,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:11:23 2015 UTC,It's really about how much time I have. If I'm in a hurry pressed is more convenient. Otherwise I will try to rush and have a big eyeshadow mess. If I have the time loose/slightly clumpy eyeshadow can be nice because I find you waste less and have more control of how much gets on the brush.

It mainly has to do with the jars, especially when shadow gets on the outside of the screw top and kicks up when I open or close the jars. Even sifters can be irritating once enough product gets trapped on top of the sifter and you have to remove it, scoop the shadow back in, then replace the sifter. I think I prefer mattes in pressed form so I don't get too much product on my brushes since I mostly use mattes in my crease."

Pressed shadows are also a bit more convenient when traveling I find.  I haven't tried pearls yet... intriguing.

Production costs have gone up since the USD has risen - suppliers may be US-based and charge USD. The amount of money in one's bank account didn't change, but the buying power sure did.   The cheapest shipping from FF to a Canadian customer is $6.50AUS, which is currently a hell of a lot cheaper than shipping from the US. But even $16AUS is not that bad, since with the exchange rate, shipping is averaging around $10CAD when coming from the US."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,LILY_LALA,-1,Tue Jul 7 20:40:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks.   I have a question though. When FF says that GSD is taken out at checkout, what do they mean? I can't seem to see a difference in price."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,swimmingmonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:44:04 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing GSD is their sales tax that they have to charge Australians, but is not charged to customers from other countries. It's been a while since I ordered from FF, so I couldn't tell you how exactly it's done."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,LILY_LALA,-1,Tue Jul 7 20:47:35 2015 UTC,"Well, the product pages say that they include the GSD in the prices and that for non-Australian addresses they take the cost out during checkout. But I couldn't see a difference in price, so I'm confused.  Thanks though! :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,swimmingmonkey,3,Tue Jul 7 20:51:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, I just made a test cart to check. Once I logged in and my information was registered as Canada, the GST was dropped - on the product page, it was $17.05, but on the checkout page, it said it was $15.50."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,-drbadass-,2,Tue Jul 7 21:00:17 2015 UTC,"so I just compared polish prices from a few different companies from FF's site vs their own and there are ones which are cheaper on FF, and ones that are slightly more on FF (like maybe $1-2). Some of the more expensive ones were from US stores, so maybe there were additional costs involved in importing them? Or they might be from a newer collection with higher prices.  But overall the actual prices were not that different."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,i_am_a_cyborg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:04:19 2015 UTC,"No, that's only for buying polishes, which cost a lot to ship from anywhere, so if I buy polishes it's a big order to make it worthwhile. Just cosmetics ship for around $6 IIRC."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,LILY_LALA,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:55:45 2015 UTC,Ah. Americans are definitely spoiled by our postal system then. Apparently it's only like $4 to get polishes shipped in the US.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,pondicus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:02:14 2015 UTC,Massively spoiled. The lowest tier for domestic parcel post from one state to another is $7.40 in Australia :/
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,LILY_LALA,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:41:35 2015 UTC,...they have different rates for different states?
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,pondicus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:42:31 2015 UTC,"Depends on how far it goes! Usually neighbouring states start around 7.40, but it can go up to $10 depending.  I wish I could offer my destash buddies international tracking, but that starts at $20 for the smallest parcel or $14 for a large envelope :("
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,12oo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:53:49 2015 UTC,"It's $16 aud, keep in mind, which with conversion rates is about the same for a lot of us to buy from the US. My last order for 3 Femme Fatale polishes plus shipping was like 30 euros. That works out to 10€ per bottle of FF polish. It's a really good deal actually."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,LILY_LALA,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:19:42 2015 UTC,Okay. I'll still look at that as over $10 in shipping. Which is about double what it should cost for shipping in the Us. I just made a order from Llawore instead and the shipping cost was just over $4 for four bottles of polish. I only spent $31 in total. 10€ seems expensive as hell to me. I think of it in costs of really yummy gelato though. That was incredibly cheap in the Eu.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,12oo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:27:50 2015 UTC,"It IS expensive as hell...but most of us outside the US have no choice for it, as US brands are the norm, so seeing it doesn't phase us. My point was for me in the EU it's not so bad when I look at the overall cost vs what it'd cost to import polishes from the US, i.e. ILNP is like $12/bottle plus $12 shipping. I was trying to explain how to some of us we pay that much shipping each time no matter what, because you seemed surprised, but it's reality /shrug"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,LILY_LALA,2,Wed Jul 8 22:48:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I was definitely surprised at the cost--I mean, I guess it makes sense for something coming from Aus, but wow.   Does the EU levy taxes on imports too?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfd0k,12oo,2,Thu Jul 9 03:41:55 2015 UTC,"They do if it's over 22 euros for me, which is another nice thing about the AUD rate. Three bottles of Femme Fatale's polish come under that rate for me, so no tax!"

It needs two coats for full opacity, but it's comfortable and non-drying on (as far as matte liquid lipsticks go) and seems to wear pretty decently. It's not transfer proof, but it transfers without removing the colour from your lips. They're now in adorable little tubes but they still have apparently 6g of product. Can't wait to wear it out and about, and to receive the new ones! How could I resist a matte dark green?"

Indiemakeupandmore,3cdd5d,beautifulmess7,3,Tue Jul 7 15:16:28 2015 UTC,Another vote for Organic Blueberries! Definitely one of my favourite blueberry fragrances (and I have a few).
Indiemakeupandmore,3cdd5d,ariadneee,2,Tue Jul 7 03:35:09 2015 UTC,Care to expand on that? :) I've been looking for more blueberry fragrances!
Indiemakeupandmore,3cdd5d,ishotthepilot,3,Tue Jul 7 18:51:53 2015 UTC,"I'd love to! I really like patchouli and berry combos and Organic Blueberries is my favourite blueberry/patchouli blend. I also have Violette Market Penny Candy Smoked Patchouli and Wild Blueberry, but IMO it's too heavy on an artificial blueberry note without the complexity and depth of OB.   Arcana Miss Skiffins is an exceedingly pretty, creamy gourmand. It really is evocative of blueberries/blackberries and heavy whipped cream. As it dries down, a bit of musk and honeycomb smooth out the edges of the fruitiness. I don't usually like milky/creamy notes, but the balance between ripe tart berry and soft cream works really well.   I've also tried OHWTO Black + Blue, which is good for scratching the berry itch but a bit too jammy for me. SS Blueberry Muffin Batter (discontinued) was spot on and very delicious - it's sold out but it's a stock fragrance you should easily be able to find elsewhere.  Haven't tried but want to: OHWTO Bluebell (Blueberries and Lychee fruit, Clover, Lilies, White Musk, and Zucchini Blossoms), HoG White Blueberry (Blueberries awash with white vanilla sugar, cream and a sprig of white thyme), Arcana Avaricia (blueberries, salal berries, pomegranates, strawberries, and red currants over a base of creamy musk and white amber).  I know I'm forgetting heaps, my perfume collection is so disorganised I'm just doing this off the top of my head. I'll update if I remember anything essential!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cdd5d,ariadneee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:03:34 2015 UTC,"Amazing, thank you!!! I will probably just dive right in on a fullsize of that Organic Blueberries then, sounds like exactly what I want! The darn Body Shop has a perfect fresh green blueberry but I want to buy indie lol.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cdn66,wakenda,2,Tue Jul 7 08:58:58 2015 UTC,"Although it looked really vibrant on my hand, the color doesn't actually apply too vividly - I think that's because the glitter cools down the pink base.

But absolutely packed-full with blue sparkles."

It makes me think of pink apples in particular. Very happy I blind-bought a full-size! I was worried it might be a little too dark and more suited to autumn, but the black tea keeps it light and there's hints of pineapple dancing around the edge. I can still smell hints of it on my wrist this morning. Lacerta - This one is weird in a good way. It morphed a ton on my skin. It was a really juicy strawberry-watermelon in the bottle which reminded me of Bubblicious gum. The fruits were more balanced once on my wrist, and I could smell something green-ish (the opium? the scales?) as well. The opium seemed to take over for awhile. The musk came out later and it smelled fruity again. Lingering sweetness on my wrist now."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cej4i,j-dusk,2,Tue Jul 7 21:42:43 2015 UTC,"Testing BPAL Grief on one wrist, Deep Midnight Mandarava on the other.  Grief is a nice pure floral, though the only flower I recognize is lily of the valley. It started sharp but smoothed out. Pleasant but not remarkable.  Mandarava is sweet but spicy, with some kind of floral and something that reminds me of dragon's blood - red and resinous. A bit of fig, too. I like it wet but dry it's a little soapy."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cej4i,lgbtqbbq,2,Tue Jul 7 16:46:45 2015 UTC,"Just my usual EE lip balm, then I layered SS Astral Temple and Alchemic Muse Loukoum for perfume. The amber, ginger, and orange of Astral Temple really softens the initial sharpness of Loukoum and I get a nice foodie lemon-rose with a soft base. It smells very exotic and complex, like a plate of a bunch of different flavors of Turkish delight. Mmm.  EDIT I think I need to add more Loukoum because it faded to mostly Astral Temple within an hour. The ladies at Chipotle were like SOMETHING SMELLS DELICIOUS when I walked in (and duh I was like, well you work in Chipotle so...) but then one said yeah it smells like Xmas, and the other said, oh yep eggnog. And I was like OOH THAT'S ME. But yeah. Realize that no matter how careful you are to layer something to perfection...everyone around you will pretty much say ""Xmas"" or ""vanilla"" or ""flowers."" :D"

It's quite a bitter citrus (like the rind or the peel), so I think it needs to sit.  Strawberries Crave Lucy on the other arm. It started out as a tart and sweet, fruity smell, with a bit of an herbal scent underneath. Now,  it smells like black licorice sweetened by a bit of fruit (I know it's strawberry and pineapple but my nose just gets a bit of fruit). It's subtle and I like the licorice, but I think this needs to rest too.  Nyx and True Love smell really good (I dabbed them on yesterday) though I thought True Love smelled musky and dried down to a syrupy smell. Nyx smelled like spicy, thick honey with a trace of lavender. I didn't get any fruit from it, but it sure smells good.  Apples Crave Apples smells like spicy apple pie to me."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,speakstruth,16,Tue Jul 7 00:31:22 2015 UTC,This is my favorite sub and I am sad to see it go. But I get it. Even a price increase wouldn't cut down on the huge amount of time this has to take. She does all of this by herself. I'd rather her do what she thinks is best than take the risk of quality suffering because she's trying to do too much.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,yousoldtheworld,9,Tue Jul 7 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"So if you check out Aromaleigh's fb page, the owner commented on why Ephemera is being discontinued, you can read the whole post here.    Basically, she said that the cost of the box would have to be increased by around $10-15 to be profitable, and she already had subscribers complaining that the cost was too high. The price of the sub would then be closer to $30 a month, and while it may have been nice to poll customers for interest in a price increase, it's still on the higher side for a sub box.    She also said that there was a significant time cost as well, something like an extra 15 hours per week on average, in addition to the usual 50-60 hour work week, that she used to spend on leisure and new collections, etc. Hope that clears up some of the questions.    I do think Ephemera was one of the standout indie sub boxes, and it'll be sad to see it go.  But I'm also excited to see the new collections and  products that will be available now that she has more time to work on those.  Maybe we'll get to see Galactic part 2 this year after all!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,-drbadass-,2,Tue Jul 7 22:23:33 2015 UTC,"40 hours is what it takes to be full time in the US. Assuming she works on her shop five days a week, that's 10 hours a day for 50 hours a week. And with an extra 15 hours on top of that...  I recently got the June Ephemera box from a sale on this subreddit and really like it. So well thought out and the usual great products. The others look really nice too. But if it's costing Kristen money and that much extra time when she's already working so hard, I can see why cancelling something so nice is perhaps best for her. There are other series that she works on like the Goddess of the Month and Menageries too, so it's not like she's completely stopping monthly offerings either"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,kadytheredpanda,4,Wed Jul 8 05:24:03 2015 UTC,"So 50-60 hours was what she said in her post was a typical work week for her - should have made that more clear. And yeah, after reading the post, I felt like the time issue was probably equal to the financial issues that she was having while running Ephemera. But it sounded like the ideas she had for future Ephemera would still show up in some form in the future."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,-drbadass-,0,Wed Jul 8 05:45:52 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, I understand. Was just breaking that down for everyone for reference. Even if she raised the prices there's still that time factor. Even if you enjoy doing something, too many hours of work is too many hours of work. Not just physically, but mentally. Burnout is a huge possibility.   Yeah, it'd be interesting to see if any or what will show up later."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,kadytheredpanda,7,Wed Jul 8 07:55:51 2015 UTC,"Noooo.... My heart. I just subscribed and will be receiving my first box this month. Although I do understand her situation, I was so excited for a monthly package from AL. On the other hand, AL is the one company whose new products I look forward to all the time!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,niniram12,3,Tue Jul 7 00:37:07 2015 UTC,They were coming out with new eyeshadow collections pretty often before Ephemera started! Maybe the owner is clearing some time to work on more of those!
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,infamousjoe,8,Tue Jul 7 00:40:15 2015 UTC,I'm actually really really sad about this :(  I ended up really loving the amount of detail that goes into the boxes and looked forward to it every single month.  They were hinting at something cool in September's box too (hopefully it's being incorporated into August's box or something).  I was hoping the prices would just increase if they weren't making a profit because I would gladly pay a bit more for that one :'(
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,niniram12,4,Tue Jul 7 00:40:16 2015 UTC,"I second the motion for an increase in cost hehe. Seriously though, I would gladly drop other subs just for this one!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,evolutionofafoodie,4,Tue Jul 7 01:27:22 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking too. Or at least restructure it so it was making a profit. Seems silly to cancel 150 guaranteed sales each month in hopes that they will instead buy the Menagerie or other products.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,infamousjoe,2,Tue Jul 7 01:02:18 2015 UTC,"As much as I like the lace and little colored worms, if cutting those could mean a profit for them, I'd gladly do away with them.  I do like the Menagerie sets, but they feel different somehow.  I like the surprise and the details put into the boxes and the little note is the icing on the cake."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,nilbogprincess,2,Tue Jul 7 01:52:54 2015 UTC,What a sudden loss of income! It would have been good to put out the idea of a price increase to subscribers prior to making the decision to pull the service. Even though I am international I would have stayed on for a price increase.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,kawaiimeows,6,Tue Jul 7 10:10:15 2015 UTC,"Well considering she's not making any money off of the subs, that doesnt really matter."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,kawaiimeows,7,Tue Jul 7 16:16:30 2015 UTC,"I mean, she already explained on Facebook just how much more she would have to charge, plus she also said the time factor was huge. Its not as simple as all these bloggers of IMAM who are apparently experts at business are making it out to be. If she wants to put her time in to more lucrative projects, people should really just respect that."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,istva,2,Tue Jul 7 19:42:22 2015 UTC,"This makes me so sad! Her box was the only thing I really looked forward to each month in the mail.   I understand why she's cancelling but that makes me so sad. I hope she'll release more fun collections because I really loved the tesla and mucha box. Maybe it's just me but I've noticed she hasn't had as many collections since doing this? Atleast not as many as Aromaleigh use to have in 2014.   Either way, I'll just have to spend that money each month in her shop instead. She's my favorite indie company for 'consistency' when it comes to overall aesthetic and quality."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cd979,rickrolled1492,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:05:08 2015 UTC,"I think she's done a lot of new collections this year. I recall a star nymph one, blade runner, lupercalia, flower nymphs, galactic, and the monthly shades/sets, too. That's got to be about 100 new colors- I'm probably forgetting some.   I think the sub had to be too much for her to do on top of it all the rest. It sounds like it's been a 60-80 hour work week since she began ephemera, and not making money on her work on the box after all is said and done.   I feel you on the overall aesthetic and quality. I love it and last month's rusalka menagerie was gorgeous- I'm excited to see what she does for medusa."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cc0wy,riobh,3,Mon Jul 6 21:57:27 2015 UTC,"That review was really good, OP! I agree with the points you made there.  I only brought Mourning Dove - while I like the colour it was settling into lip lines after a while. I have very dry lips, so take that into consideration. I experienced the same problem with the tubes - it wouldn't twist down after being twisted up. I gave it a few wee stints in the microwave which only fixed the problem only for a time :/ It's not a bad product, mind you - once the issue with the tubes is sorted I'd happily buy more. I brought mine ages ago, so I doubt I'll be able to get a replacement, meh. It still works okay."

Those colors are so pretty but there seems to be a lot of issues with the product so early on. Combined with the formula and having to apply them with a lip brush, I think I'll wait a bit before trying them myself."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cc0wy,lesballoonssportif,13,Mon Jul 6 19:52:30 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I don't think any of the colors I've tried need a lip brush, and that includes Power to Bite, the HW Visage color that is very similar to Frigatebird.  However, every one I've tried yet has detached from it's twisty thing and can't be twisted down.  I contacted Jenn about Power to Bite when it happened and she sent me a replacement when I put in an order for some of the other colors.  I do hope she works out the issue, because these really do seem like a spiritual successor to my beloved Performance Colors lipsticks.  I hope she expands her color selection once she fixes the packaging."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cc0wy,singinginthecar,8,Mon Jul 6 20:23:08 2015 UTC,"The formula is definitely a personal thing - some people will love it whereas it's not my favorite. Applying with a lip brush isn't a personal deal breaker, but I can see how it can be a deterrent for people who don't usually reach for them."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cc0wy,gorgossia,2,Mon Jul 6 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"I bought the sample pack (so really have to apply them with a lip brush anyways). Just have to try varied bunting but I am really enjoying the formula. It does lean dry, I think, but as a liquid lipstick lover this is not a problem at all. Often I barely felt it on my lips. However, this is more my preference compared to formulas with too much slip. Just depends what you look for!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cc0wy,infamousjoe,5,Tue Jul 7 02:09:17 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the bolder colors because I didn't buy any of them, but I have not needed to use a lip brush for the lighter neutrals. I think this formula works very well for those sorts of colors. I'm not sure I would buy something dark in this though."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cc0wy,BigDamnHeroesSir,2,Mon Jul 6 20:50:06 2015 UTC,I have three full sizes and I don't think any of them require a lip brush for application.
Indiemakeupandmore,3cc0wy,benoit_balls,3,Tue Jul 7 00:08:30 2015 UTC,"Wonderful lip swatches!  Bullfinch looks really pretty on you, but screams a much brighter orange on me for some reason.  I'm usually at a loss of what eyeshadow to wear with it :x"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cc0wy,infamousjoe,3,Tue Jul 7 01:57:37 2015 UTC,"I'd use my go-to neutral: A champagne-y gold on the lid, something mid-brown in the outer corner, and a slightly darker than flesh-tone shade in the crease. Even if it's a brighter orange on you, that should work."

This has been addressed for all current and future stock, so it shouldn't be an issue for the slim line tubes moving forward, but for any already placed orders, it is very important to me that everybody is enjoying a fully functional product."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cfu4j,someguyinanambulance,5,Tue Jul 7 17:49:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think so? None of my suppliers have promotions, and it doesn't really seem to be common practice amongst wholesale suppliers.  If you're just ordering small amounts for personal use, it'll be so cheap that you won't need promotions. (Seriously. The sample bags from TKB are more than enough product to make a few eyeshadows with them.), and if you're doing it to open a store, you'll just have to factor it in to your startup costs."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cfu4j,whereismydragon,-2,Tue Jul 7 17:53:01 2015 UTC,I like TKB because they have small sizes. I tried Amazon but they're too big. Mind sharing some ideas about other suppliers? :3

Indiemakeupandmore,3cb889,smearedgoth,7,Mon Jul 6 15:37:08 2015 UTC,"Alchemic Muse Carnival is grapefruit and cotton candy. It smells sooo good, I have a 5ml bottle and the lotion.   Fabled Fragrances Le Cirque is strongly cotton candy and a little caramel apples and popcorn. I enjoy it a lot because it's sweet with the other subtle carnival scents in the background.  Sixteen92 Shadow Show's primary scent is the kettle corn, but has a really nice cotton candy note. I like it when I need a little less sweet carnival scent.  Violette Market, of course, has the cotton candy scent. I haven't tried it, but I own Midway and After Dark. Midway ended up being really complex on me with distinct real cherry, something sweet and fried, and cotton candy. But I know some other people didn't get that so much. After Dark smells a little more like a 'real' perfume than any other scent I own. It has a lovely cotton candy scent to it while seeming sexy and mature."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cb889,12oo,2,Mon Jul 6 17:43:15 2015 UTC,"VM's Cotton Candy smells nothing like cotton candy imo. It's sweet and vanillaish and a bit like the base of Aquolina Pink Sugar to me and overall nice, but just not a true cotton candy scent at all."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cb889,Zannahquinn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:20:44 2015 UTC,"Yeh, like I said, I don't really know, not having tried it. I do find their cotton candy note in the ones I do have to be pretty true, however. I suspect their Cotton Candy is more of an inspired by cotton candy sort of thing, eh? I wasn't planning on getting it. I think if I am buying more of any, it's the non-cotton candy Funhouse. It smells like Starbuck's frappuccino Cotton Candy, but that's because of the raspberry, not actual cotton candy."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cb889,Estridde,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"Yea i think so too, i dont hate it but i was a bit sad it lacked the actual cotton candy scent, which was why id bought it."

The bubble gum note ends up smelling like bungeoppang on me for some reason when it's first applied, but mellows out to a gorgeous scent after it's been on for a while. It's not bad when it's first applied either, I just have a strong scent association with it and it makes me hungry! The throw is crazy on it for me, my boyfriend could smell it from across the room when he first got home after I'd had it on for five hours."

Under the Big Top - Confection of sweet blue and pink cotton candy, a drop of black sugar, aged Vanilla syrup and a few rich drops of five year old aged Amber resin from the NA Studio. A perfume tincture of Black Saffron aged in an old wooden Egyptian mahogany barrel.   I know the first has the funnel cake, but had to mention it :x"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cb889,MageLocusta,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:52:30 2015 UTC,I've been SO WANTING the Under the Big Top for months--but I keep worrying that it won't work on my skin XD. Is the UtBT fluffy and airy at parts? Or just really delish and sticky?
Indiemakeupandmore,3cb889,lgbtqbbq,2,Tue Jul 7 09:55:22 2015 UTC,"The cotton candy note is definitely fluffy - you can smell it separate from the sticky vanilla syrup; so much love for this scent!

That's the best IMO, even better than their Pink Sugar (which was a stock fragrance so you can find it elsewhere.)  On second thought, even though it is a stock scent, it's generally a can't-go-wrong one, and it's a classic. I know Queen Bee Apothecary stocks Pink Sugar in a multitude of products. I had it in the deodorant and it smelled great, but I prefer using unscented products + just perfume nowadays."

Lou Lou's on Etsy has a couple different cotton candy scents as well, but hers are single notes she blends into others (or soaps), so I've had to request the cotton candy oils on their own before. I have her Pink Fluffy Candy and Blue Cotton Candy and love both. :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cb889,itsahhmemario,3,Mon Jul 6 18:17:46 2015 UTC,"I love carnival and cotton candy scents too!  So far, my favorite is Foxcroft Fairgrounds.  I've also tried:  Violette Market Midway (from a few years ago; smells like cheap cherry car air freshener on me), OHWTO Carnivale (very generic/not complex just ""sweet"" smell), Alchimia Apothecary Everything Floats (good, but not as good as FF and longevity is not great), and Alkemia Calliope (decent, but not complex and longevity isn't great).    I found Enchanticals perfume on Etsy, and they seem to have a few different carnival scents.  Has anybody tried them?  They have a ""Krazy Karnival Side show Freaks"" collection."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cb889,MageLocusta,2,Mon Jul 6 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I LOVE Alkemia's Calliope because it's a real 'crunchy' cotton candy scent. The only problem  though is that pink sugar smells tend to go plasticky on me.   I haven't tried Enchanticals' carny scents yet (but SOON! I'm getting their 'Fat Lady' perfume sample in a couple of weeks, so I will leave a review about it) but I do like how Enchanticals give a lot of 'texture' to their scents. The only 'issue' I'd find is that when she makes a sweet smell, it is very, VERY sweet (like their Gluttony perfume, which while goes like ""deep, dark blueberry>cinnamon>HOLYHELL THIS BUTTERCREAM NOTE IS MORE SUGARY THAN BETTY CROCKERS'>fluffy light spongecake"").  Granted, Enchanticals also does perfumes that are work friendly (like Wynter, and Mermaid's Cove). So I think it depends on the fragrance. I constantly heard great things about 'Fat Lady' so it might not be too sweet!"

I think the cotton candy in that is really realistic, and it's got a lovely creamy citrus thing going on too. It's sweet but not too sweet."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cb889,Zannahquinn,2,Mon Jul 6 17:39:10 2015 UTC,HI!!  I am so happy that you love them!  :)  Thank you for the rec!

Violette Market's Taffy Pull and I think there was a old scent pure cotton candy it was named Fairy Floss I think? It was divine. I couldn't do their Funnel Cake scent, it was all plastic coconut on me.  BPAL's Midway Resurrected is nice for an overall carnival scent (I can't wear the original version it goes plasticky on me).  The truest funnel cake/fried carnival perfume was Good Judy's Pumpkin Fritters and Heaven and Earth Essential's Funnel Cake."

I only tried CO's Loki, which DEFINITELY has a realistic and 'textured' blue cotton candy note (though it's more billowy, like a very thickly-packed cotton candy landing on your face). Is the spun sugar note kinda like that or different?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cb889,laceandhoney,2,Tue Jul 7 09:54:26 2015 UTC,"Lou Lou has a Blue Cotton Candy and a Fluffy Pink Candy. I've only tried Blue Cotton Candy, and unfortunately it turned really powdery on me like most sugary scents do. But on my sister it lasts all day is smells very much like cotton candy. Her sample sets are super cheap and huge so I think it could be worth a shot. (PS also get Spiced Pear Cake because it's the best thing in the world)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3cb889,golddiglett,2,Mon Jul 6 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"This one might pique your interest:  Violette Market Haunted Clown Car  With notes of creamed strawberry, black flecked coconut, orange sherbet, boozy vanilla bean, black cherry accord, smoke-infused cotton candy, marshmallow fluff, and ghostly images howling in laughter as old rubber tires skid across the dusty circus arena leaving a trail of machinery oil."

The ""Love"" category is actually my top 3% perfumes. Like would be more of my top 25% of perfumes. Ok's (formerly ""Meh""...""meh"" sounds like I hate it, when I could find it nice, just boring) somewhere between 40-75% and anything below goes to the destash pile."

I've never tried it, but that is their line of product without any fragrance added to it, and they make it for both the butter and the emulsion.

Indiemakeupandmore,3cb96g,lisaplusplus,2,Mon Jul 6 16:03:58 2015 UTC,"Lots of bath and body supplier companies have body butter bases. You can buy in bulk (1 lb at a time or more) and divide into smaller jars.

Indiemakeupandmore,3caxkt,itsahhmemario,6,Mon Jul 6 14:10:54 2015 UTC,"This isn't really a way to salvage them so much as a way to use them up anyway, but I've started putting some perfume that's gone a little off in my hair while it's wet, as it seems like you're a little less likely to get all the complexity of the perfume oil from your hair, so the overall impression of the perfume comes across a little bit without any of the sharpness that's developed in the oil.  This will probably totally depend on whether the scent has just changed and gone sharper or has actually gone rancid, but I've been able to use up some perfume that I've otherwise stopped wearing this way."
Indiemakeupandmore,3caxkt,lisaplusplus,2,Mon Jul 6 14:31:10 2015 UTC,That sounds like a good idea! I'll try that today with some. Thanks!

Indiemakeupandmore,3caxkt,Saffrin,4,Mon Jul 6 19:28:00 2015 UTC,Do you mind sharing what brands still smell great after 11-13 years? Perfume oil longevity is something I've been worried about recently- I love my collection but it's not worth it to keep buying stuff that'll go off in 1-2 years for me.
Indiemakeupandmore,3caxkt,j-dusk,4,Mon Jul 6 14:50:12 2015 UTC,"I have over 500 oils and only this small handful has gone off so I think you are ok for the most part. I think it has to do with the base, as far as I know, if it has a jojoba or fractionated coconut oil base it lasts longer. I was hasty in my writing of 'many companies' because really I only have BPAL that is that old and smells great, except for some of my floral very aged ones have gone a little sour and weird but not totally off.  edit: I actually think many of them smell even better aged, as long as the base holds up. For example, I'm wearing some old Arcana scent today and it's even better now in my opinion."
Indiemakeupandmore,3caxkt,sihaya09,3,Mon Jul 6 15:00:09 2015 UTC,"Yup! FCO is apparently near infinite if stored properly, with jojoba coming in a close second.   Grapeseed oil only has an expected shelf life of 6-12 months, with most other oils sitting on 1-2 years."
Indiemakeupandmore,3caxkt,lgbtqbbq,2,Mon Jul 6 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"Good, I remembered correctly! :) That's good to know about grapeseed oil. I think I will now seek out perfumers that have FCO as their base because I am so slow to use up my perfumes. It's wonderful to know they can last so long."
Indiemakeupandmore,3caxkt,poor_violet,3,Mon Jul 6 19:14:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know a lot of people think BPAL is overpriced, but man, that stuff holds up well. I got a hold of an imp of Scherezade that's about 10 years old and oh my god. It's the best thing I've smelled."
Indiemakeupandmore,3caxkt,j-dusk,3,Mon Jul 6 15:11:36 2015 UTC,"I have four or five bottles from 2004-2005 and they smell as good, if not better, than they did fresh."

Indiemakeupandmore,3caxkt,Stinkysnarly,2,Mon Jul 6 19:19:15 2015 UTC,This is encouraging. I just found my stash of imps from circa 2009 that I had left in my parents house and haven't opened any for fear of rancidity.
Indiemakeupandmore,3caxkt,ishotthepilot,2,Mon Jul 6 16:41:36 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I still consider those on the 'fresh' side! :) Funny anecdote, once on the forum someone had found a stash of bpal bottles that had been living in their car for years unbeknownst to them. It had gone through many seasons and they couldn't vouch for the smell but were giving them away in case you were curious and you just had to pay shipping. I got a few that I had samples of and surprisingly they smelled the same! That's years ago now and I keep those bottles separately from the rest of my stash and they still smell great. So basically I think bpal is very durable and ages amazingly well for the most part. I find it kind of magical."

Taxi Wallets [with a recycled version if that makes it cooler]:  I don't own one, but a friend does, and it's held up pretty well and looks nice.  Leonie Saliba:  Okay, so technically there isn't one listed in her store, but maybe you can ask if she still makes them (assuming you like the look).  I have bought one of her bags and it was nice (everyone always asked about it).  JooJoobs wallets: No experience, but they look solid, and if quality is there then that is a good price for leather.  Whym wallets: Haven't personally tried, but it's on my wishlist?  Art + Leathers:  Also on wishlist.  Nancybird Wallets:  Pricey, but some styles are on sale so hey.  Mywalit: Hoping to get one for the holidays.  LOOK AT ALL THE COLORS ohmygod.  Not exactly indie, but still.  Cleobella Mexicana Wallet  FashionABLE Heta Wallet  Edit  Forgot Queen Bee makes wallets too.  I have a bag from 4-5+ years ago and it is still going strong."

I happily own some napkins I purchased there a few years back (although it's shameful, because I'm a hobby sewist and know how to make napkins), and this wallet. However, after taking a look around the shop, it seems like the wallet prints have gotten less exciting over the years. I think he/she/brand owner uses upcycled fabric, so it may be that his/her latest thrift store find was a bust. The wallets have interfacing sewn into them to provide structure. If you're hard on your wallets, though, you may want to get something with a heavier weight, like canvas or leather."

Most from that collection were very evocative scents and had leather, spices, aquatics, etc.. I have never tried any from Lost at Sea Part II. I've been buying Violette Market for years (back when it was Midsummer Muse) and run circles as well, I can say I've really liked a lot of her oils. I actually regret that I rehomed most of my bottles a few years ago when I needed to desperately downsize and now I can't find much of it. Having said that, I haven't tried anything new for maybe three or so including newer State Fair scents like Penny Candies etc."

Indiemakeupandmore,3cabdj,itsahhmemario,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:09:50 2015 UTC,"Sure! The company has some inconsistencies sometimes which made me a little less confident to be honest, nothing major at all just a few things here and there that I observed. I can't say how the oils are now, but back 3 or 4 years ago, I enjoyed them."
Indiemakeupandmore,3cabdj,eraser_dust,5,Tue Jul 7 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried the Lost at Sea collection, but I've tried Violette Market in general. I noticed that with Violette Market in general, I definitely need to buy decants because there's 2 radically different qualities I encountered. The Victorian Magic Autumn collection were amazing quality and I appreciated the quality even in the scents I hated.  The State Fair was a bit more mixed. I noticed that the Penny Candies/Cotton Candy scents tend to smell like room spray/car perfume even when they don't smell like candy. The non-Penny Candies/Cotton Candy scents tend to smell more like good perfume.   I noticed that she has 2 pricing tiers ($20 for 5ml or $10). Maybe she adjusts the quality according to the price? Or she could also be simply testing the market and doing 2 price tiers for that reason."

This smells green floral on me. I don't smell the vanilla or musk at all. My skin amps up the peach and grapefruit a lot. I wish I can smell the musk cause that would make this blend more rounded instead of the high pitched notes that fade right away. I will let this sit for a while and try it again.

Indiemakeupandmore,3c9ct3,ThirteenDream,3,Mon Jul 6 02:59:05 2015 UTC,I forgot to include Cameo! Definitely a spring-summer gourmand!
Indiemakeupandmore,3c9ct3,lgbtqbbq,7,Mon Jul 6 03:54:04 2015 UTC,"Chiffon- beautiful light fluffy lemon scent. Reminiscent of a lemon bar or lemon chiffon pie. Not cake-like at all but still definitely a gourmand, fresh and light and sugary.  Chrysalis- grassy green bitter orange blossom  Blackburn's Parlor- Creamy chocolate vanilla banana split with delicious waffle cones. Compared to other more spice/cake heavy SS gourmands this has a spring/summery sweet feel.   Smokewood Apiary- Seasonless IMO, but the light smoke + pure honey is very summery especially if you layer it with the right stuff.  Nightgown- one of my favorites, no matter the season, but the pillowy white floral character definitely suits a hot-weather nighttime feel. It's exotic and sultry, though not so much that it couldn't be worn during the day."

Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,blueskiesandsun,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:36:28 2015 UTC,Seconding Kraken as a liner! I really liked it with a peachy/corally/neutral shadow look. I paired it with Shiro Little Bird and Fyrinnae Rapunzel Had Extensions. I should try people too.
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,glitterwrists,2,Tue Jul 7 11:24:38 2015 UTC,"If you have unscented dryer sheets (or use wool balls like me), lavender vanilla is wonderful for a load of towels or bed linens."
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,Bloop_Monster,2,Mon Jul 6 05:56:01 2015 UTC,"I LOVE this idea! I have a few perfumes that smell so good but just aren't ""me""... But if I can make my blankets smell like SS Kitchen......"
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,SUBARU17,2,Mon Jul 6 12:21:18 2015 UTC,Try wearing Kraken as a liner!
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,SUBARU17,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:17:32 2015 UTC,"That's a really good idea, I'll have to try that!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,dartigen,3,Sun Jul 5 23:23:01 2015 UTC,Maybe not NEW new....but mixing a sample vial or 1/8 dram of sample perfume oil with 2 oz of unscented lotion would be nifty. I've read on IMAM about people doing it. Also perfume oils in scent warmers (with a little water or unscented wax to keep it from burning/crusting on the plate).
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,SUBARU17,2,Mon Jul 6 04:00:57 2015 UTC,"I actually need to buy a scent warmer, but I've been dying to try this. I have quite a few perfumes I think would work so well as room scents."
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,dartigen,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:03:12 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, you are right. I don't like spicy scents on me, but they're great on a warmer."
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,eraser_dust,2,Mon Jul 6 04:09:00 2015 UTC,"I've used the little aromatherapy diffuser thingies (like this one; mine is a lot less pretty and turns off automatically when it's out of water) with perfume oils. They work pretty well, but you don't need to use much at all - maybe 1-2 drops at the most."
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,eraser_dust,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"Pooh, good to know only a couple of drops. Thank you-- I've seen that diffuser at my doctor's office and I was wondering where to buy it."
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,kazaanabanana,2,Mon Jul 6 21:02:50 2015 UTC,"I've seen them in homewares shops, pharmacies and some dollar-store type places here in Australia, they're usually $40-$60. I wouldn't buy one online, simply because they're plug-in appliances - best to try to get one from your country to make sure that it has the right plug type and voltage."
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,eraser_dust,2,Tue Jul 7 09:21:02 2015 UTC,"I use Dawn Eyes' Kartini as an eyeshadow, highlighting blush and lip product :P"
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,rinacee,7,Mon Jul 6 01:21:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, use it as a perfume then :P  What about as a nail colour? It would be gorgeous as a nail polish."
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,kazaanabanana,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:05:39 2015 UTC,I should do that! No idea why I haven't!
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,rinacee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:58:39 2015 UTC,"Post pics if you do, I'd love to see it!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,rinacee,3,Mon Jul 6 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'm so thrilled that I got Kartini as a sample in one of my Dawn Eyes orders. Versatile, gorgeous, and a great feminist wrapped in to one shadow!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,LILY_LALA,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:56:06 2015 UTC,Yay! Glad you like the colour!
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,LILY_LALA,2,Mon Jul 6 02:58:21 2015 UTC,"My current favorite eyeshadow is Fyrinnae's Zanzibar.  I have only used it as liner so far, and am not afraid of bold looks, so any suggestions would be lovely! My current favorite perfume is probably Hey, McFly! from Smelly Yeti.  Not usually a fan of scents with vanilla notes in them, but the root-beeryness helps! Would love an interesting combo suggestion!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,ferbrat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:51:08 2015 UTC,"Teal and orange double liner, perhaps? With one on the top lash line and one on the bottom."
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,ferbrat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:52:47 2015 UTC,Ooooh yes. That sounds fun!
Indiemakeupandmore,3c8mhw,ferbrat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:26:42 2015 UTC,"I'd use Zanzibar for a colourful smokey eye. I think it would look really awesome paired with a darker green like Shiro's Lingered in Twilight.   And how do you feel about fruity perfumes? For Hey, McFly! I think it would be really interesting paired with something very strongly fruity, maybe even one of the Arcana craves?"
Indiemakeupandmore,3caa3j,marashade,6,Mon Jul 6 09:33:29 2015 UTC,"I have not, though putting ""Calypso Cosmetics review"" into Google pops up a load of issues with missing orders, etc."
Indiemakeupandmore,3c7v36,nightbiscuit,11,Sun Jul 5 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"This is beautiful but if I could make a suggestion, it would be much more helpful if you could move the product list onto the imgur album or even edit your photos so a name is by each color. It's tough to keep track of a pretty color and flip back and forth to see what it is. Lovely swatches though!"
Indiemakeupandmore,3c7v36,smittenkitten04,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:19:30 2015 UTC,Completely understand...Next time!
Indiemakeupandmore,3c7v36,smearedgoth,2,Sun Jul 5 19:25:27 2015 UTC,amazing swatches! Could you please tell me what colour that teal is?  Thank ya :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3c7v36,smearedgoth,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:37:19 2015 UTC,"The super sparkly teal is Geek Chic's The Lure, from the Hannibal collection :)"
Indiemakeupandmore,3c7v36,Pookabbit,2,Sun Jul 5 19:43:01 2015 UTC,ohhh thank you!  I really need to check them out! :)
Indiemakeupandmore,3c7v36,AngryCoffeeGirl,2,Sun Jul 5 19:47:48 2015 UTC,"Lovely swatches! thank you for sharing them :D I feel you on the eczema though, blergh on it! Mine has recently decided that right under my right brow is the perfect place to manifest >.<"
Indiemakeupandmore,3c7v36,FizzingWhizzbees,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:24:15 2015 UTC,Such a bummer!! My dr has me taking bleach baths. PM me for commiseration <3
Indiemakeupandmore,3c7v36,whereismydragon,2,Mon Jul 6 02:59:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the beautiful swatches! I just love the name ""Haunted Ballroom."" Fyrinnae's product names always seem kind of random (in the best way!) but it's oddly appropriate for the shade. Also, I think I have to have Colonel..."
